# Chapter 62: The Reconnaissance Squad

"Lingao." Beiwei murmured, holding Russian-made infrared binoculars. The image was somewhat fuzzy, but the general outlines were clear.

Beiwei had traveled extensively across China. From perfectly preserved Pingyao in Shanxi and Fenghuang in Hunan to ancient cities reduced to foundation traces—he'd seen all kinds of old fortifications. But a county seat like Lingao was a first: oval-shaped, longer east-to-west than north-to-south. Figuratively speaking, like an olive.

The entire county seat faced south, backed against Gaoshan Ridge, facing the Wenlan River. Here the river curved from south toward northeast, forming a bend that embraced the city walls. "Using the river as moat"—no separate moat needed.

By eye, the walls were roughly 7 meters high. Very short perimeter—Beiwei estimated around 1.5 kilometers. Small but well-fortified: each gate had watchtowers, apparently with cannon positions; walls were entirely brick-clad. The Ming invested heavily in urban fortification—even this remote small county was formidably defended. Beiwei recalled a tourism visit to an ancient city site in the Universe's Greatest Nation: their so-called "city walls" of rocks and mud slapped together weren't even as high as his elementary school's fence; their city gate looked like a railway underpass. Truly worthy of the Universe's First Great Nation, which had supposedly traveled the world spreading civilization's sparks to the Four Ancient Civilizations before retiring to a peninsula.

*(Note: When first built in early Ming, Lingao's walls were only 1 *zhang* high. During Jiajing era, to resist *wokou*, walls were raised to 2 *zhang*, watchtowers added, and walls brick-clad.)*

Through infrared binoculars, he could see the walls lined with bonfires and lanterns, soldiers patrolling back and forth—apparently tight security. But even someone with no study of ancient warfare could spot major defensive weaknesses in the gates. East and west gates sat at the "olive's" pointed ends, completely exposed with no flanking cover—attackers could concentrate on the gates without worrying about crossfire from the flanks. The south gate, facing the Wenlan River, was at the most prominent point of the "olive's" midsection.

Outside the east gate, vague structures were visible but completely dark—lifeless. Over the Wenlan River south of the south gate stretched a long multi-arch stone bridge—the Linjiang Bridge, built during the Yongle era by Vice-Magistrate Lu Sheng on the foundation of the Yuan-dynasty Taiping wooden bridge. It had nine arches.

*(Note: Also called Wenshui Bridge; repaired during Qing, raised and widened in the 1950s, used until the late 1960s, demolished in 1970.)*

"Looks like the county already knows we're here." Li Jun said quietly.

"No talking. Stay alert." Beiwei adjusted the binoculars' focus.

At dusk, Ma Qianzhu had found Beiwei, ordering him to lead a small reconnaissance squad upriver inland, pushing straight to Lingao's walls.

"Move as fast as possible to the county walls. Monitor the town's activity." Ma Qianzhu instructed. "Surveying along the way is not your mission."

Upon receiving orders, Beiwei immediately drafted three just-rested Military Group personnel and one from Communications. They selected essential equipment, prepared briefly, then departed after nightfall.

"Your mission isn't combat. Focus on monitoring. Don't kill unless necessary."

Given this mission, the squad wore camouflage. Besides rifles, they brought a scoped Saiga-308, infrared binoculars, and a 2-watt radio.

Night cross-country might challenge ordinary people, but not soldiers—especially equipped with low-light night-vision goggles. The slight difficulty: they had no map of this timespace's Lingao. Judging position during movement was hard. So Beiwei decided to follow the river—according to current timespace's geographic data, following the river upstream 12 kilometers reached the county seat, with landmarks like Bairren Rapids as reference. Combined with compass and map reading, even without a guide, they wouldn't get lost.

On normal roads, 12 kilometers was a 3-hour walk even for civilians. Currently pathless, but the staff reconnaissance trip had shown the Wenlan's banks had no complex terrain—4 hours maximum.

Actually, they moved faster than expected. With night-vision in use, the squad marched along the river without rest. In 3 hours, they'd spotted Lingao's lights.

They selected a small hill across the river—a copse of mixed trees positioned between the south and east gates, overlooking the walls across the water. Excellent for monitoring both gates. The squad built an observation post and spread snake-repellent powder around. September nights in Lingao were already cold; dew was heavy. They erected small rain-cape shelters and began rotating watch.

"Captain, Command on the radio. They want a situation report." Li Yunxing, serving as radioman, reported.

"This is Beiwei at the radio."

"This is Ma Qianzhu at the radio. How are things?"

"Good. Recon squad reached Lingao at 21:12, lunar September 1st." Beiwei checked his watch. "Currently observing."

"Current Lingao situation?"

"On alert. Approximately 20 personnel patrolling and standing guard along the south wall from west to east."

"Continue monitoring. Report any developments immediately. Over." Ma Qianzhu ended the call, glancing at the ship's clock—9:30 PM. Over ten hours since D-Day T-time. They'd unloaded massive quantities of material and equipment; the beach base had taken shape. The current camp could resist attack by several hundred local armed forces. But reports from everywhere weren't optimistic. Basic building materials were critically short; most facilities built with great labor were temporary. Many essential civilian installations couldn't be established.

Local contact: zero. Though Military Group perimeter guards had found extensive signs of human activity, they hadn't yet encountered any locals. The beacon-tower lookout spotted occasional sail traffic at sea, but Changgong Bay—Lingao fishermen's main fishing ground—had no boats at all. Clearly the alarm had scared them off.

At the first day's summary meeting, many Committee members felt the original "turtle strategy" was too conservative. D-Day events proved that staying holed up in Bopu Port hindered base development. Current state, according to Wang Luobin, was a death spiral: no building materials → can't build production base → no production base → can't produce building materials → no building materials. Breaking this cycle required rapid expansion—establishing an industrial base in a suitable location.

The recon squad's report showed locals were panicking, only closing their gates for self-defense—no attack on the transmigrators forthcoming. This was the perfect opportunity to rapidly expand control and upgrade the base.

The meeting decided: at dawn tomorrow, dispatch a second reconnaissance squad to survey and assess nearby terrain and resources.

"We also need to send a route-survey team to survey and design the Bopu–Bairren Rapids highway." Wen Desi's colored pencil drew a line on the map's transparent overlay. "We'll survey, design, and build simultaneously. Except for essential personnel and equipment to continue unloading, throw all labor and machinery into this project. Try to connect the two locations within three to four days. By D+5, we can begin construction at Bairren Rapids."

"Both survey teams will need Military Group protection, right?" He Ming asked. "Military Group requests activating ten militia into active service."

Wen Desi frowned. Manpower was already stretched thin; once road-building began, labor would be even scarcer. But Military Group was indeed overstretched—twenty-one people handling land and sea security and observation. After a full day without rest, four had been sent scouting; the others were still at towers and posts—snatching only catnaps.

"Fine, you can have the people." Wen Desi made his decision. "Two guards per survey and route team." He glanced at He Ming. "That's workable?"

He Ming nodded: "No problem. The organization has a labor shortage now. Military Group personnel will also participate in work when not on duty."

"You're exhausted from a full day of guarding."

"Bai Yu, Zhao De, Chen Haiyang and I discussed adjusting Military Group's duty schedule—everyone on guard duty must contribute 2 hours of labor daily. I'll lead by example."

Dawn gradually lightened. D+1's morning arrived upon the First Reconnaissance Squad. Everyone wore camouflage cloaks; dew had soaked them through.

Through binoculars, he watched city-wall personnel yawning as they took down and extinguished lanterns. Torches had died, trailing wisps of blue smoke in the dawn light.

The vague structures outside the east gate visible at night proved to be temples and such. Open ground surrounded the city—extensive wilderness interspersed with some rice paddies and scattered village clusters.

Wei Aiwen slowly crawled to Li Jun's observation position. "Li-ge, let's make a move."

"What do you want to do?"

"Storm the county seat."

"Just the five of us?" Li Jun glanced at the three sleeping under the camouflage shelter. This kid Wei was a real left-deviation adventurist.

"We've got five semi-autos. Afraid of some primitives? Rush in, spray some bullets, they'll all run."

"Then go put on a raincoat first."

"Why?"

"Dressed like us, we'd definitely be taken for demons and doused with dog blood and feces."

"..." Wei Aiwen had known it was impossible anyway. His real motive was wanting to fire his weapon. After getting the SKS, he'd pestered for a Russian R14 scope, then bugged Beiwei for practice. Yesterday during guard duty he'd "dry-fired" dozens of times; now he was itching to test his marksmanship.

Their talking woke Beiwei. "Forget it. The Committee's mission is reconnaissance, not combat. Reckless shooting would expose our intentions. Besides, this mission is partly reconnaissance, partly training the team. Weren't you so exhausted on arrival you collapsed and slept half the night before waking?"

"I covered half your shift, you know. Remember to pay me back next time." Li Jun said. "I'm over thirty—night shifts are murder on the body..."
