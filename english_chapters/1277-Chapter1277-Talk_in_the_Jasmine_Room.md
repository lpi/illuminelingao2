# Chapter 1277: Talk in the Jasmine Room

On the second floor, there was also an entertainment room which was a sand table simulation room, equipped with three types of sand tables: naval, land, and amphibious warfare. Combined with exquisite terrain models and weapon models, various military sand table games ranging from simple war chess games to highly simulated war chess deductions could be conducted. This was the place where military otakus were most enthusiastic about coming.

At this moment, the large recreation room and the sand table room were brightly lit, with laughter and conversation coming from time to time. Wu Nanhai did not disturb the Senators inside and went directly to the private room on the third floor.

The third floor consisted entirely of separate salon private rooms—similar to small and medium-sized meeting rooms. There were 8 rooms in total. They were salon private rooms prepared by the teahouse for Senators to hold private and departmental gatherings. Since opening, Senator societies often gathered here for entertainment on holidays: The Indigenous Rights Protection Association and the Women's Federation frequently held meetings here. Although the Flying Cloud Club had its own place, it sometimes held small gatherings here. Occasionally, some Senators brought capable naturalized subordinates from their departments here for relaxation as a reward.

The private rooms here were specially designed with good soundproofing and privacy, and various food and beverages were supplied. The waitresses were all D-grade or below maids selected from the General Office who had undergone good training. The waitresses serving on this floor all had jade pendants hanging at their waists, making a pleasant tinkling sound when they walked—reminding the Senators in secret talks that a waitress was approaching.

Thoughtful and meticulous service gradually made this place a main venue for private exchanges among Senators, the core zone of "lobbying" activities.

Wu Nanhai looked at his watch and first entered the Agricultural Committee's frequently used private room, the Milk Vetch Room: several Senators from the Ministry of Agriculture had been playing "Legends of the Three Kingdoms" here for a long time, while a few other Senators sat on the sofa smoking hookahs and using laptops—the teahouse private rooms were among the few entertainment venues with all-day electricity and sockets.

Several people greeted him, and he acknowledged them one by one. Only then did he sit down at the small bar in the salon. Seeing him sit down, the maid serving at the bar poured him a glass of "Hehui" brand gooseberry wine brewed by the Agricultural Committee's winery without waiting for his order, according to his preferred ratio: a few ice cubes, one-third wine, then filled with soda water, and also brought out a dish of salted peanuts as a snack to go with the wine.

Wan Lihui was sitting next to him, squinting his eyes and smoking a hookah—he didn't inhale the smoke, just enjoyed the atmosphere. After exhaling all the smoke in his mouth into smoke rings, Wan Lihui said: "Old Wu, what do you think of the report my brother made in Jeju?"

Since Wan Lihuang went to Jeju Island to "grind the dungeon", he had been busy promoting the cultivation of potatoes, citrus, and Chinese cabbage on Jeju Island. Recently, he also started promoting alfalfa cultivation on Jeju Island to adapt to the needs of the island's animal husbandry. Agriculture was booming, especially potato planting. The first batch of potatoes sown in the early summer of 1632 ushered in the first bumper harvest of this crop on Jeju Island in October.

Although Wan Lihuang only conducted trial planting in the standard village farm fields near the three cities of Jeju, extremely considerable yields were still achieved—the original yield per mu of potatoes was astonishing, and modern potatoes could reach more than 2 tons per mu. Although Wan Lihuang didn't have chemical fertilizer in hand, he knew that plant ash could be used to replace the potassium fertilizer potatoes needed most, and he brought good seeds from another spacetime. Coupled with modern field management models, the average yield per mu of potatoes in Jeju Island still reached 900 kilograms. Even by the standards of the old spacetime, this level was enough to pass the passing line.

The large harvest of potatoes once left the caught-off-guard local naturalized cadres "not knowing how to store them". Potatoes had a high water content and would rot if not processed and stored in time. Fortunately, there were many mouths to feed on Jeju Island. Under Feng Zongze's instruction, potatoes were distributed as the main ration for refugees.

In addition to using simple stewing and roasting methods, a variety of potato products were also specially developed, such as potato pancakes, potato cold noodles, potato kelp miso soup, and other foods with potato as the main ingredient. With the assistance of a wide variety of seasonings and other vegetables, the refugees even felt that they ate better than the previous relief dry rations for every meal.

Naturally, Feng Zongze looked at this special envoy of the Agricultural Committee with new eyes, showing great high regard, and praised the inexperienced Wan Lihuang until he was dizzy and didn't know north from south.

Encouraged by this situation, Wan Lihuang proposed: the potato planting area on Jeju Island should be expanded by 200%, with two sowings per year.

As a result, what Jeju Island needed was not just potato seedlings. Expanding the sowing area required a larger seedling breeding base, facilities for processing and storing harvested potatoes, and more fertilizer—not just potassium fertilizer, but also nitrogen fertilizer. Even for local chemical fertilizers and local pesticides, a special production factory was needed—these all involved expanding the Agricultural Committee's basic investment scale on Jeju Island. He also proposed setting up a seafood processing plant locally.

Wu Nanhai drank his wine: "Little Wan, you came just in time. I have carefully read your brother's report. It's very well written! It's great that he is so enthusiastic about agricultural affairs on Jeju Island—Old Feng also wrote me a letter, praising him a lot. It's not easy to make such a splash in less than a year on Jeju Island!"

Hearing the leader praise his brother severely, Wan Lihui couldn't help feeling a warm current in his chest and hurriedly said: "He is still relatively young..."

"Being young is good. Young people should go out and venture. Don't worry about the technical support mentioned in the report. I have arranged for someone to compile a 'Jeju Island Agricultural Production Reference Compilation' using materials transferred from the Great Library, which will be sent by the liner next time." Wu Nanhai thought while speaking that your brother acted as the bird that sticks its head out for Feng Zongze. Those projects in the report were probably what Feng Zongze wanted most.

"I have also tried my best to arrange the various materials he applied for. Among the short-term trainees graduating from the agricultural technology class this time, 10 are specially arranged to go to Jeju Island, so tell Little Wan not to worry and just go ahead and do it."

"Thank you, Old Wu." Wan Lihui nodded, feeling a bit embarrassed thinking about the idle talk he had with his brother before—Wu Nanhai was really a kind person. His face burned slightly.

"What's there to thank? It's all for work." Wu Nanhai said, "By the way, there are another 10 students majoring in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine in this batch of trainees. The allocation is sending 6 to Nick, and your brother keeps 4 for himself—don't let Nick take everyone away. This island is not just for raising horses; other aspects of breeding will also be developed—breeding stock will be sent soon. These people have also received primary medical training. Whether it's people or livestock getting sick, they can handle it. Although the skills are a bit rough, they are still more professional than the local doctors of this spacetime."

"I will, I will." Wan Lihui nodded excitedly in succession, seemingly seeing a bright future for his brother's dungeon grind. Having said this much, he felt it was a bit difficult to bring up the matter of a few more projects—after all, Old Wu had been generous enough, but he couldn't not mention it, so he hesitated and said: "Do you think the projects mentioned in the letter are possible?"

Wu Nanhai gently tapped the cigar on the Jingdezhen brush washer from Jiangxi that served as an ashtray, letting the long ash fall, before saying: "These projects should all be launched. But the finance department says this year's capital construction investment has been used up, and it has to be arranged in next year's budget. It is said that next year's budget is a bit tight. Our agricultural sector must unite and strive for it." He specifically emphasized the word "unite".

"Didn't they say they got more than a million taels of silver from Zheng Zhilong?" Wan Lihui was somewhat disbelieving.

"When cannons roar, ten thousand taels of gold are spent. The spoils of war are considerable, but the money burning is also fierce. I heard that Old Ma and Cheng Dong's faces turned green when the military expense reimbursement bill came out this time." Wu Nanhai described it vividly, as if he had seen it with his own eyes, "Besides, there are many places to spend money now. And I heard that there will be a currency reform next year, which is another huge sum of silver spending..."

Wan Lihui figured out the flavor now. Wasn't Wu Nanhai using "emphasizing difficulties" to indicate that there was "no money to do" the projects his brother wanted to launch?

"So, it's very difficult?" Wan Lihui decided to probe Wu Nanhai's real thoughts.

"Try our best to strive for it. Our agricultural sector and the Ministry of Light Industry must strive for this piece." Wu Nanhai said categorically, "But you also know, when it comes to the Senate reviewing the budget, various departments will have another famine fight. It's hard to say whether it can be passed exactly according to the budget we submitted."

This statement was still very flexible, equivalent to saying nothing. Wan Lihui was quite disappointed. Wu Nanhai felt the timing was about right and said again: "I have another idea about this matter, and I want to communicate with you..."

Sending away Wan Lihui who was eager to go back, Wu Nanhai came to the reserved Jasmine Room. on the sofa in a corner of the salon, several Senators from the finance sector he specifically invited today had all arrived. Wu Nanhai made a gesture, the waitress brought drinks and snacks, and they immediately cut to the chase and started chatting.

This was the reason he specifically instructed Chuqing to reserve the Jasmine Room today: he wanted to discuss with several Senators from the finance sector: proposing to the Senate to allow state-owned enterprises to issue stocks and bonds. The specific case was to issue Ministry of Agriculture Agricultural Development Bonds and non-cumulative preferred stocks of various directly affiliated enterprises throughout Hainan Island and the Guangzhou region.

The so-called preferred stock, simply put, gave shareholders special rights to receive company earnings in fixed dividends prior to common shareholders and to receive remaining assets prior to others during company bankruptcy liquidation. However, shareholders generally could not participate in the company's business activities. In reality, it was a form of raising funds through debt.

Wu Nanhai prepared to issue non-cumulative preferred stocks, which only distributed dividends based on the current year's profits. If the company did not manage well in the current year and could not distribute dividends, the undistributed dividends could not be accumulated and could not be paid later. It was equivalent to a corporate bond that did not promise annual interest.
