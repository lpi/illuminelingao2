# Chapter 39 - Aftermath

Chapter 39 Aftermath

The rescue operation brought endless topics to the bored Transmigrators. It injected a stimulant into this long and boring preparation work. The few people who participated in the operation were grabbed by people every night after work and asked to tell the story they had repeated hundreds of times. Bei Wei, Ran Yao and Lin Shenhe shone like three new stars rising in the night sky. Wherever they went, people came to greet them, and even people they didn't know called them brothers.

After a comprehensive check-up in the hospital, the doctor's conclusion about Wen Desi, who was sent to the hospital with great care by many people, was that he was much healthier than others. Although some things were lost, they were just insignificant items. The most valuable ones were nothing more than President Wen's stab-proof vest and electric shock device. Someone romantically wondered if the stab-proof vest would become the Heavenly Silkworm Treasure Armor in the legends of Jianghu. Someone even whimsically suggested the Executive Committee wholesale "Heavenly Silkworm Treasure Armors" - ten thousand taels each.

The Executive Committee's mood was not so optimistic. Of course, they were not worried about any treasure armor or electric shock device. The stab-proof vest couldn't stop bullets, and the electric shock device was just a plastic shell when the battery ran out. It was the behind-the-scenes message brought out by this kidnapping.

The things searched from the killed bandits were odds and ends, silver, copper coins, flints, tobacco pouches, everything. The most valuable was a letter. The content was plain and uninspired: nothing more than asking for peace, asking if the entrusted goods had been sold, etc. But the signature was actually "Zhou Rui of Min'an bows".

If not for the arrival of the Imperial Capital Time Travel Party, young history graduate student Yu Eshu - note not young history scholar, this letter would probably have slipped by like this. Student Yu told the Executive Committee after reading it that this Zhou Rui of Min'an should be the "adopted son" of Zheng Cai (some say clan nephew), a clan brother of Zheng Zhilong.

The so-called "adopted son" was a common business mode among Chinese maritime merchants at that time. Sea trade was risky. Rich and powerful families raised some adopted sons to brave the wind and waves to trade at sea, while their own biological sons could sit at home and enjoy the fruits. Some people became "adopted sons" because of debt. The social status of these adopted sons was not high, equivalent to commercial semi-slaves - lifelong professional managers, and not allowed to change jobs. The Zheng family kept a large number of such "professional managers". Later, Zheng Tai, the famous revenue officer under Zheng Chenggong, was also such an adopted son.

Zheng Cai, in modern terms, occupied a major leadership position within the Zheng Zhilong Group for a long time. Although this person belonged to a side branch in the Zheng family, after Zheng Zhilong surrendered to the Qing and was taken away, the Zheng Group was leaderless for a time. He could fly his own colors and retreat to Xiamen to contend with Zheng Chenggong. His power was quite considerable.

This bandit leader surnamed Wang had a letter from the Zheng family's professional manager on him, and many messages indicated that they were people from the Minnan area. The shadow of Zheng Zhilong emerged clearly.

Forging a feud with the Zheng family, the largest maritime group in China in the late Ming and early Qing, before formally starting the time travel, this matter was not very fun.

Yu Eshu said to the worried Executive Committee members: This is unfounded worry. In the late Ming, pirates on the sea surface of Guangdong and Fujian were as many as hairs. Excluding the Zheng family group, there were ten or twenty groups of pirates/maritime merchants that historians can name now. Nameless small pirates, maritime merchants who got greedy at the sight of wealth and made a snatch anytime and anywhere, plus the Dutch, British, Portuguese... simply a paradise of the law of the jungle. For Transmigrators to gain a foothold in Hainan, they must beat them all into submission. Making enemies with whom, sooner or later, is the same thing in the end. Such figures who are both merchants and pirates don't care if you have a grudge against them or not. If there is money to be made, they will come to interfere. If you don't have strength, you will be robbed by them. Peaceful trade relations are completely built on the deterrence of each other's force. So hitting them this time is not bad. At least let them know that Transmigrators are not to be trifled with, so they won't be so unscrupulous in the future.

Although so, in order to guard against possible retaliatory actions by the Zheng family, the Executive Committee still carried out a level one alert in the Guangzhou stronghold. The housing was rebuilt, fences and anti-theft doors were installed, and a number of fire extinguishers were reserved.

Xiao Zishan went to visit Gao Ju and roughly informed him of the passing of the event. Master Gao was astonished - didn't expect Australian maritime merchants to have this hand, resolving this matter cleanly in this unfamiliar place. After the incident happened, although he also sent sedans and mule carts for their use at Xiao Zishan's request, he had been holding back a bit, unwilling to help fully - originally planning to wait for them to come for help after the ransom letter came, so he could sell a big favor.

Unexpectedly, this group of Australian maritime merchants was so tough! He couldn't help but be greatly annoyed. When Xiao Zishan asked him for help, he agreed profusely.

Using the excuse that that house was easily attacked after this incident, Xiao Zishan proposed to buy another house. Gao Ju had no choice but to agree. Fortunately, the matter of buying the house was still handled by him. The Australians seemed not to have lost trust in him. So he patted his chest repeatedly, saying he could even pay for the house - counted as a gift to comfort Master Wen. Xiao Zishan said "not to be repeated" a few times and accepted it with a smile.

Speaking, Master Gao took out a list again and handed it to Xiao Zishan.

Opening it, it listed: ten thousand paper-rolled tobaccos, two hundred niello lighters, thirty oval mirrors, two hundred powder box mirrors, two full-length dressing mirrors, various novel Australian goods without limit.

"This is?"

"Alas!" Master Gao sighed, showing a very painful expression on his face, "It's a little filial respect from me in the capital. Urgent use. Can brother send it within ten days?"

"Easy to say, easy to say." Xiao Zishan agreed profusely. These were not rare things. Except for cigarettes, going to the small commodity market once for the others would be enough. However, this filial respect was really not small. In terms of trade amount, Master Gao had to pay almost twenty thousand taels for the goods. Who is so awesome?

Xiao Zishan thought that if he could connect with such a powerful figure through Master Gao, there might be opportunities to use it in the future. So he deliberately said: "We naturally have to bring some novel objects over. Don't know what hobbies the big boss in the court has? Wouldn't it be better if we cater to his likes?"

"Many thanks, worthy brother," Master Gao smiled bitterly, "Novel goods naturally must be had. These things are what they specified."

Truly fucking corrupt. Xiao Zishan cursed in his heart. Accepting bribes is not enough, still demanding bribes, and demanding bribes with specific names of things.

"Need so many?" He pretended to be surprised.

"Not many. The two in the palace, twenty-four yamen, grand secretaries of the cabinet..." Gao Ju muttered and stopped again, "Forgot worthy brother is not a person of Great Ming. Saying these may not be clear."

Xiao Zishan listened very carefully. The level of this gift giving was really not low. Does Gao Ju have such great energy? Intending to probe, he asked quietly: "Is this lord who made the list the Nine Thousand Years?"

Gao Ju was startled, hurriedly looked around, and seeing no one else, whispered:
"Be careful with words! Not the Factory Duke, but another one." He asked back, "How does worthy brother know the name of the Nine Thousand Years?"

"Coming to Great Ming for so long, know a little about Great Ming's affairs." Xiao Zishan put on an air of "I know more than I say" meaningfully, whetting his appetite fiercely.

Gao Ju indeed took the bait: "Brother, you also know what business brother I do," he sighed, "Being able to do this business peacefully until now is all thanks to the blessing of a Eunuch Yang in the palace."

At that moment, he roughly talked about his relationship with Eunuch Yang. Nothing more than Eunuch Yang being his backer. The matter of sharing spoils was naturally not mentioned. Xiao Zishan could guess it - this kind of relationship, as long as one is Chinese, no one can't imagine it. Even if you say again that it is a pure friendship relationship, it's useless.

"But now Eunuch Yang is not as good as before in the palace." Gao Ju lowered his voice again, as low as a mosquito, "Not liked by the Factory Duke."

"This batch of objects is to curry favor?"

"Dare not say curry favor. Burning incense on four sides, asking for peace is the best lot." Gao Ju wiped the sweat on his forehead, "Eunuch Yang and I are actually one body. No matter how much it costs, I have to do my best to serve."

"Brother understands."

"There is one more thing, also ask brother for help," Gao Ju arched his hands.

"Easy to say, easy to say." Xiao Zishan thought his face was so sincere and his tone so earnest, could it be borrowing money?!
"Recently I have a troublesome matter. Silver money might not circulate well..."

Damn, really afraid of what comes what. Xiao Zishan was still nodding and smiling, but the smile began to stiffen.

"...Want to trouble worthy brother to mediate with the several shopkeepers in Australia. Can we change to settling accounts once a month? If you can mediate, brother I will be endlessly grateful, and there will be another reward."

This is wanting credit, and unexpectedly wanting to bribe me. Xiao Zishan thought, Gao Ju proposing this condition is not excessive in any space-time. Most enterprises in the 21st century would laugh in their dreams: monthly settlement placed in monthly settlement 60 days is already a recognized rule. Merchants in Taiwan are still striving to promote 120 days. And foreign merchants trading in China in the early 17th-19th centuries could only settle accounts one or two years after entrusting goods to Chinese merchants, and often couldn't settle the accounts, causing many conflicts in Sino-foreign trade.

The problem is that their time travel trade is to raise money as soon as possible. Credit will increase the instability of collection. The Executive Committee may not agree to this matter.

He suddenly realized that from just now, Master Gao had been manipulating the conversation, using his curiosity to lead the topic to this step by step - this old fox!
"Could it be that worthy brother is in a difficult position?" Gao Ju saw his expression change and knew the matter was difficult.

"This matter needs to be discussed at length." Matters having reached this point, he could only deal with it perfunctorily, "Only to owe goods, there must be a clear reason, so we can evaluate whether it is possible."

After hesitating for a moment, Gao Ju told everything about Yang Tianliang coming to Guangzhou to discuss building a living shrine for the Nine Thousand Years with him.

"This living shrine was originally easy to discuss. Spending five thousand taels of silver would be enough. But Eunuch Yang's meaning is to be 'grand and magnificent', and also to mobilize the merchants and people of Guangzhou. The cost of this matter inside and outside probably won't be less than seventy or eighty thousand taels." Gao Ju's face twitched slightly, obviously extremely painful.

Xiao Zishan's knowledge of the living shrine of the Nine Thousand Years came entirely from "The Tombstone Inscription of Five People" in middle school. He had no concept of whether a living shrine for Wei Zhongxian had been built in Guangzhou, nor was he interested. But this matter still had to be reported to the Executive Committee as soon as possible, to let Yu Eshu see if there was any value to utilize.
