# Chapter 39: Aftermath

The rescue operation gave the bored transmigrators endless material for conversation—an adrenaline shot into the long, dull preparations. Every night after work, the participants were collared and asked to retell what they'd already repeated hundreds of times. Beiwei, Ran Yao, and Lin Shenhe shone like three rising stars in the night sky. Wherever they went, people came to greet them; even strangers addressed them as brothers.

After a comprehensive hospital examination, doctors concluded that Wen Desi—delivered with much fuss and care—was healthier than everyone else. Though he'd lost some items, they were insignificant. The most valuable were Director Wen's stab-resistant vest and stun gun. Some romantics wondered if the vest might become the legendary "Silkworm Treasure Armor" of *wuxia* tales; others fantasized that the Executive Committee could wholesale "Silkworm Treasure Armors"—ten thousand taels apiece.

The Executive Committee's mood wasn't so optimistic. They weren't worried about the armor or stun gun—the stab vest couldn't stop bullets, and a stun gun without battery power was just a plastic shell. What concerned them was the intelligence gleaned from the kidnapping.

Items found on the dead criminals were miscellaneous—silver coins, copper cash, flint, tobacco pouches—but the most valuable was a letter. Its contents were mundane: greetings, inquiries about whether entrusted goods had been sold, and so on. But the signature read: "Zhou Rui of Min'an, bowing."

If not for the arrival of the capital's transmigration-faction member, the young history graduate student Yu Eshui—note, not a young history *scholar*—this letter might have been overlooked. After reading it, Comrade Yu informed the Executive Committee that this Zhou Rui of Min'an was probably one of Zheng Zhilong's cousin Zheng Cai's "yinan" (sworn adopted sons/servants).

So-called *yinan* were common in Chinese maritime merchant circles of that era. Overseas trade was risky, so wealthy families kept *yinan* or *yi'er*—adopted sons/servants—to brave the waves while their biological sons stayed home and enjoyed the profits. Some became *yinan* due to debt. These adopted sons had low social status—essentially commercial semi-slaves, lifetime professional managers who weren't allowed to change employers. The Zheng family maintained many such "professional managers"; the famous official Zheng Tai under Koxinga started as such an *yinan*.

Zheng Cai, in modern terms, had long occupied a major leadership position in the Zheng Zhilong conglomerate. Though a collateral branch of the Zheng family, after Zheng Zhilong surrendered to the Qing and was taken hostage, the Zheng group was temporarily leaderless. Zheng Cai had carved out his own territory, retreating to Xiamen to contend with Koxinga. His power was considerable.

This Wang surname ringleader carrying a letter from a Zheng family manager, plus many indications they were from southern Fujian—Zheng Zhilong's shadow clearly emerged.

Making enemies with the largest maritime power of the late Ming/early Qing before even properly starting the crossing—this wasn't funny at all.

Yu Eshui told the worried Committee members: this was groundless worry. The waters off late-Ming Guangdong and Fujian teemed with pirates. Besides the Zheng faction, historians could name at least a dozen or twenty pirate/merchant gangs, not counting nameless petty pirates, merchants who'd seize opportunities, plus the Dutch, English, Portuguese... a veritable jungle-law paradise. If the transmigrators wanted to establish themselves on Hainan, they'd have to beat them all into submission. Making enemies with anyone—sooner or later—was all the same. These merchant-pirates didn't care whether you had a grudge or not: if there was money to be made, they'd get involved. Without strength, you'd be robbed. Peaceful trade relations existed entirely under mutual armed deterrence. So this battle wasn't bad—at least now they knew the transmigrators weren't to be trifled with. Perhaps they'd be less reckless in the future.

Even so, the Executive Committee declared a first-level alert at the Guangzhou base to guard against possible Zheng retaliation. They reinforced the housing, installed barriers and security doors, and stockpiled fire extinguishers.

Xiao Zishan visited Master Gao and gave a general account of events. Master Gao was astonished—he hadn't expected the Australian merchants to have such capabilities, neatly resolving the situation in an unfamiliar place. After the incident, though he had sent sedan chairs and mule carts per Xiao Zishan's request, he'd been holding back from full assistance—planning to wait for the ransom letter and have them come begging, so he could earn a big favor.

He never expected these Australian merchants to be so formidable! He was greatly annoyed. When Xiao Zishan asked for help, he immediately agreed wholeheartedly.

Xiao Zishan, citing the risk of future attacks on the residence, proposed buying a new property. Master Gao reluctantly agreed. At least the purchase would still go through him; the Australians didn't seem to have lost trust. He thumped his chest and offered to cover the property costs—a gift to steady Master Wen's nerves. Xiao Zishan said "Just this once, just this once" several times as he graciously accepted.

Then Master Gao produced a list and handed it to Xiao Zishan.

He opened it: Paper-rolled tobacco, 10,000 units; niello lighters, 200; goose-egg mirrors, 30; compact mirrors, 200; full-length dressing mirrors, 2; assorted novel Australian goods as available.

"What's this?"

"Ah!" Master Gao sighed, his face showing extreme reluctance. "It's a tribute I owe in the capital. Urgent. Can you deliver it all within ten days?"

"Certainly, certainly." Xiao Zishan readily agreed. These weren't rare items—except for the cigarettes, the rest could be found at a wholesale market. But this tribute was substantial—the total trade value would run to nearly 20,000 taels. Who was this important?

Xiao Zishan thought if such a powerful figure could be connected through Master Gao, it might prove useful later. So he said deliberately: "We'll naturally bring some novelties. May I ask about the great personage's preferences? We could cater to his tastes—wouldn't that be better?"

"Thank you, brother," Master Gao smiled bitterly. "Novelties are certainly welcome, but these items were specifically requested."

*Really damn corrupt.* Xiao Zishan cursed inwardly. Not just accepting bribes but soliciting them—and specifying exactly what to demand.

"Who needs so much?" He feigned surprise.

"Not that many. Two in the palace, the Twenty-Four Bureaus, the Grand Secretariat ministers..." Master Gao mumbled, then stopped. "I forgot—brother isn't a Ming subject. You wouldn't understand all this."

Xiao Zishan listened carefully—the gift recipients were quite high-ranking. Did Gao Ju have such connections? Wanting to probe further, he whispered: "This person making the list—could it be the Nine Thousand Years?"

Gao Ju startled, looking around nervously. Seeing no one, he answered quietly:

"Careful! It's not the Depot Lord, but another. How does brother know the Nine Thousand Years' title?"

"We've been in the Ming long enough to learn a thing or two." Xiao Zishan adopted an air of deep meaning—"I know more than I'm saying"—baiting his curiosity.

Gao Ju took the bait: "Brother knows what trade I'm in." He sighed. "That I've conducted business peacefully all this time is thanks to a Eunuch Yang in the palace."

He briefly explained his relationship with Eunuch Yang—essentially that Yang was his backer. The profit-sharing details he naturally omitted, but Xiao Zishan could imagine—any Chinese person would guess. No matter how "purely friendly" one claimed such relationships to be.

"But now Eunuch Yang's position in the palace is much worse than before." Gao Ju lowered his voice until it was barely audible. "He's not favored by the Depot Lord."

"So these goods are meant to curry favor?"

"I wouldn't dare call it favor-seeking. Burning incense in all directions, praying for safety—that would already be the best outcome." Gao Ju wiped sweat from his forehead. "Eunuch Yang and I are essentially one body. No matter the cost, I must show full devotion."

"I understand."

"There's one more thing I need brother's help with." Gao Ju clasped his hands.

"Of course, of course." Xiao Zishan thought his expression so sincere, his tone so earnest—surely he wasn't about to ask for a loan?!

"Lately I face difficulties. Cash flow may become tight..."

*Damn it*, exactly what he feared. Xiao Zishan kept nodding and smiling, though his smile was stiffening.

"...I'd like to ask brother to negotiate with the Australian shopkeepers—could we settle accounts monthly? If you could arrange this, I'd be extremely grateful, and there would be compensation."

So he wanted credit—and even wanted to bribe him. Xiao Zishan thought: Gao Ju's proposal wasn't unreasonable by any era's standards. In the twenty-first century, most businesses would be ecstatic—monthly settlement was considered generous when 60-day payment was the norm, with Taiwan businesses pushing for 120-day terms. And in the seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries, foreign merchants trading in China often had to wait one or two years after consigning goods to Chinese merchants before getting payment—often failing to collect at all, causing many Sino-foreign trade conflicts.

The problem was that their crossing trade aimed to raise funds quickly. Extending credit would increase collection uncertainty—the Executive Committee might not agree.

He suddenly realized that from the start, Master Gao had been manipulating the conversation, exploiting his curiosity to steer it toward this topic—the old fox!

"Is brother troubled?" Gao Ju noticed his changing expression and knew it was difficult.

"This requires more deliberation." Having come this far, he could only stall. "For credit, we'd need a clear justification before we can evaluate."

After some hesitation, Gao Ju explained about Yang Tianliang coming to Guangzhou to discuss building a living shrine to the Nine Thousand Years.

"The shrine itself would be manageable—spending perhaps five thousand taels would suffice. But Eunuch Yang wants it 'grand and magnificent,' and wants to mobilize Guangzhou's merchants and commoners. The total expenses could run to seventy or eighty thousand taels." Gao Ju's face twitched slightly—obviously pained.

Xiao Zishan's knowledge of the Nine Thousand Years' shrines came entirely from the middle-school text "Record of the Five Men's Tomb." Whether Guangzhou had ever built a shrine for Wei Zhongxian, he had no idea and no interest. But this needed to be reported to the Executive Committee quickly, for Yu Eshui to assess any strategic value.
