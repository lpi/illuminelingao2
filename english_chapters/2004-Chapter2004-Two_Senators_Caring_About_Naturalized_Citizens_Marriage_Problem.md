# Chapter 2004 - Two Senators Caring About Naturalized Citizens' Marriage Problem

"This, so many prisoners in Fu You Di [Fu Bo Army Labor Camp], surely can have suitable ones right." Du Yibin asked not dying heart.

"Saying want to find, then definitely can have ones meeting your condition. But this number fear is far from enough—Especially according to your plan: Every person allocated two... even three wives..." Seeing this strip honestly speaking Ran Yao was relatively surprised.

With gender ratio of manpower under Senate control now. Let alone two wives. Monogamy cannot be achieved. This Senator Du is generous. Giving two at once! Let alone prison basically doesn't have so many "Female prisoners meeting condition." Even if having. Also impossible to arrange so.

"There are two more methods. Finding Portuguese going to Goa buying Indian females over. 21st Century Indian female status is very low let alone 17th Century. Big deal spending some more money!"

Going overseas "Buying Wives" for naturalized citizens this matter was proposed by different Senators in different occasions. As for purchasing location from Vietnam, Japan, Korea such near neighbors. To Southeast Asia region, India all had people proposing. Still people suggesting buying from Europe and Middle East region...

But these "Human Instrumentality Project" all didn't get passed because of huge cost. Some conducted small scale experiment. But once truly started executing. Planning Agency found compared to needed population. Transport capacity mastered truly insignificant. Most key problem is wanting to traffic population must arrange agents locally. When European trafficked black slaves initially. Must rely on local slave traffickers to supply "Source." Since having "Agent," must leave rich profit for Agent. Otherwise who would go doing this both hard and risky dirty work.

Besides these miscellaneous economic reasons. Still people thought doing so was artificially manufacturing "Mixed Blood." Would cause naturalized citizen second generation becoming impure "Hua Xia Seedlings"—Anyway. Controversy huge.

"...In addition is widows of Guangzhou Pure Chaste Hall—Keeping widowhood is extreme waste of resource! Thinking again such Chaste Women in whole Guangdong Grand Region definitely not few. Must mobilize them to marry people. I believe they definitely also willing."

Although Ran Yao not quite certain if "Chaste Women" were "Definitely Willing." But "Widow Remarrying" was always policy advocated by Senate. He having this thought also counted not wrong.

Ran Yao frowned saying: "Now many naturalized citizens have no wives. You allocating two three wives to these disabled personnel in one breath now. This influence fear not too positive."

"So I hope is small range unpublicized wedding. Even newspaper need not report. At most coming as finding wives for former Fubo Army disabled retired soldiers. They disabled daily life very inconvenient. Later having children then won't it tire those women sick. Arranging two to three wives for them is also meaning of mutual helping. Still same sentence when we striving for world this special situation needs special handling. Those small sections need not mind. Otherwise those cadres in rural area acting simple rough at every turn should have entered labor camp long ago. Although not doing marriage certificate. But several Senators going to happen to be host witness this face placed here. They won't divorce easily also won't care about so-called title. Similarly regardless Fubo Army National Army or Police. All can handle several Collective Weddings. Affiliated Senators go a few more acting as witness host. How those Hainan Guangdong natives will think. Pipe eating pipe drinking also helping finding wives. Then willingness to be naturalized citizen speed will rise in geometric number. Just Lingao still has not few natives unwilling to shave hair. I think only one unhappy is matchmaker. Earned money less."

This speech of Du Yibin seven ups eight downs made Ran Yao laugh. He felt this young man before eyes courage commendable. Also had heart to do things. But consideration inevitably too ideal.

"You so generous. Planning Agency will eat you surely—Let alone your family same clan Ms. Du will definitely hit up door." Ran Yao shook head saying. "Saying so. Giving disabled soldiers finding wives matter. Civil Affairs Department did in 50s. Back then was doing for Volunteer Army disabled soldiers—Basically were heavy disabled personnel receiving disability life allowance life unable to take care of self. That time Civil Affairs Mouth found wives for them in rural area. Saying wives. Actually was life-long nursing worker. Didn't give them two wives each either. You doing so. Equals doubling current disability subsidy. Planning Agency wants to eat you. Wudaokou has to peel your skin.

"This, era distinct—Several wives not important. Anyway if female prisoner number not enough I plan to raise a proposal in Senate. Putting matter of importing female slaves on schedule. But women of Pure Chaste Hall must be allocated to me continuously..."

"Proposal you write. Delete clause of two wives per person—Too transcending reality. And influence not good either. Solving spouse problem for disabled naturalized citizens is 'Virtuous Governance.' You doing so becomes sneaky matter. Already acting no propaganda function. Giving people excuse again—We happen to advocate 'Monogamy'."

"Another one can count as Life Secretary—Nanny..."

Ran Yao thought you face slapping also too fast. Directly giving Senate embarrassment. This proposal cannot go on General Assembly discussion would be shot. He originally wanted to perfunctory few sentences herewith sending him away. But thinking he was also good heart wanting to solve problem for disabled naturalized citizens. Then patiently said:

"Expense? This is a big sum of money!" Ran Yao said. "Female Prisoner or Female Slave. All ordinary women. Not saying emotional problem. Which person likes living a lifetime with a disabled man? Now disabled naturalized citizen wage is self warm full no obstruction. Wanting to raise family feed mouth then hard. This economic status simply cannot keep wife! People all have legs. Arriving time giving you a walking away. Where do you find them? Don't say two wives. Just one wife must give considerably big economic subsidy to keep them. Civil Affairs and Finance both won't pass."

"This is matter condemning people's heart..."

"Condensing people's heart also has cost." Ran Yao laughed. "As for proposal of purchasing females from India or random where to solve naturalized citizen marriage problem I approve. Prioritizing solving marriage problem for disabled naturalized citizens I also approve. You proposing I can co-sign." Ran Yao laughed. Feeling he quite cute. "Female prisoner need not think. No play. As for women of Pure Chaste Hall—This matter I don't oppose. But cannot make decision. You find Liu Xiang to discuss."

"This engaging IT ghost ideas quite many. Thinking of hitting female prisoner idea is for saving money right." Ran Yao watched him leave. Shook head. Smoked Early Sunny Edition Cigar. This was limited edition. Du Yibin didn't smoke—Looks like specially bought to "Public Relation."

Du Yibin ran in Guangzhou for several days. Met quite a few Senators. Also sent memorandums to various sides. Seeking support. Clear responses very few. Finding wife for disabled naturalized citizens this matter counted everyone supporting. But specifically to how to find. Obviously various sides all unwilling to invest resource. Finally also only a Senator named Wang Jun responded his initiative of "Solving Marriage Problem for Naturalized Citizens."

This Senator Wang was one of several Soy Sauce Senators dispatched to Guangzhou in Two Kwang Strategy. According to rule had a pile of titles. Among which most main title was "Mechanical Industry Ministry Chief Engineer"—This was special title for Engineering Senator not holding administrative post.

Senator Wang presence in Lingao very low. Out of Mechanical Industry Ministry basically no one knew him. Also no administrative post. This wasn't he willing to be Soy Sauce or ability too low. Truly his major and current stage productivity disjointed too big.

His major was: Automotive Electronic Construction and Maintenance. In the juncture of Steam Engine Doing Big Doing Special had no his business. Going to Vehicle Factory helping he knew nothing—Because he actually engaged in electronics. That gang of Power Mouth stood him wanting let him help a bit. But he was Low Voltage. High Voltage knew not a fart. Borrowed here today. Borrowed there tomorrow. Did everything. Nothing proficient. Conversely became Mechanical Mouth Panacea style important figure. Currently main work was taking several naturalized citizens maintaining tractor, vehicle and engineering equipment etc. brought from crossing time. Taking consider learning fixing Steam Engine too.

After Two Kwang Strategy started. Invested large amount of inland river motor vessels—Maintenance of Steam Engine, Gearbox, Boiler used by these vessels became a heavy burden. Senator Wang then was sent to Guangzhou. Doing mechanical maintenance work in Henan Island Temporary Shipyard.

This work both heavy and very important. Senator Wang busy for several months. Almost never entered Guangzhou City. Work heavy let it be. However he always felt self staying in "Forgotten Corner." Pondering whether engaging a "Project" to manifest self presence in Guangdong.

Just thinking this problem. "Disabled Naturalized Citizen Marriage Problem" memorandum of Du Yibin sent to his hand—Senator Du disregarded three seven twenty one. Every Senator in Guangdong was distributed a copy.

Senator Wang like other Senators. "Consistently Valued" solving naturalized citizen marriage problem. But towards Senator Du's specific solution didn't catch cold [not interested].

"Female prisoner, female prisoner. Where come so many female prisoners. Also one person matching two wives. Too exaggerated!" Wang Jun thought. "Still buying foreign women comes more realistic."

He always felt strange. Why slave trafficking activity of Kwark Jones in Southeast Asia only limited to male. Obviously could load a part of women too. Women similarly good labor force. Whether agriculture or industry. All need large amount of female population. Used to solve naturalized citizen marriage problem one move two gains.

As for language barrier problem. Wang Jun felt this wasn't problem. Could big deal marry first. Then cultivate emotion—21st Century still had Mail Order Bride trade.

Suddenly he thought when accessing workers in shipyard. Workers said local natives had quite interest in naturalized citizen workers. Often came to inquire their income and marriage status.

"Right. Still need to base on local solving!"
