# Chapter 2783: The Capital (Part 135)

"The young lady is from a small humble family and cannot stand fright." Granny Shi said "understandingly," "This old body won't go to her place anymore, to save everyone from difficulty and her from fear!"

"True, save trouble." Liu Qi'er actually felt somewhat apprehensive in her heart, because Xu Yong came a few days ago and had already lectured the servants of the whole residence very severely, even the two young ladies were spoken to.

Don't look at how she spoke disrespectfully about the teenager "whose hair hasn't grown even," but power doesn't lie in age. One sentence from the teenager could make her couple's buttocks bloom (be beaten), and further lose this good job of managing in the Zhou residence.

It was just that Liu Qi'er was still thinking about Granny Shi's "Imperial Secret Medicine," plus usually the couple used small favors in the residence to win over the servants up and down so they were submissive, so she felt somewhat secure (relying on support/unafraid).

If it weren't for Xu Yong questioning separately this time, and asking particularly trickily, originally it would have been watertight.

But Xu Yong couldn't squat in the residence every day. As soon as he left, Liu Qi'er reverted to her old ways. You Rong disapproved of Xu Yong's "rectification" even more. Ever since she hooked up with Pan Cheng'an, it was the time when they were stuck together like glue and lacquer; how could she be willing to accept such constraints. Therefore, she instigated the Liu Qi'er couple to continue interactions with Granny Shi.

Granny Shi chatted with Liu Qi'er for some time. seeing the time was about right, Liu Qi'er went out for a circle, came back, and waved to Granny Shi.

Granny Shi understood, immediately got up, followed Liu Qi'er through the backyard, and entered from the side door. Inside was a small skywell (courtyard), which was the skywell for the north side room of the east wing. From here, one could directly enter the east wing room where You Rong lived, without passing through the courtyard gate and the yard, so it wouldn't disturb Yui living in the west wing.

Compared to the wing rooms fully exposed in the yard, the side room was more hidden and quiet, so it was mostly used as a bedroom or small study. This was Yui's (Note: You Rong's) "small study."

Naturally, Yui (Note: You Rong) didn't read and write here, and Zhou Newton hadn't reached the age of reading. This "small study" was the place where she specifically spoke confidential words and stored important items.

Upon entering, Granny Shi first curtsied and said with a face full of smiles: "Good day, Miss!"

"Good day, Mama!" You Rong also had a face full of smiles when seeing her, "Mama, sit." After speaking, she ordered tea to be served.

"This old body just drank in Sister-in-law Liu's room, Miss don't bother." Granny Shi declined and sat down, saying: "This old body brought the medicine for replenishing Qi and nourishing blood that Miss asked for last time." Saying so, she took out the medicine packet from the bundle.

Liu Qi'er was an old hand at serving; knowing they wanted to talk confidentially, she hurriedly retreated and closed the door.

You Rong was still worried. Hearing the side door outside sound, she got up, opened the room door to look, and saw the backyard side door was closed. Only then did she retract her body, close and latch the room door, return to Granny Shi's side, and without distinguishing guest and host or high and low, sat down beside her and asked: "What news from Master Pan?"

Seeing her anxious, Granny Shi couldn't help laughing secretly in her heart. But she deliberately kept her in suspense, saying leisurely: "News there is none..." Seeing You Rong reveal a disappointed expression, she continued, "But there is a letter." After speaking, she took out a letter from the bundle she carried.

You Rong was overjoyed, hurriedly took the letter and opened it to read. She came from a background of Yangzhou Thin Horse (courtesan). Although her talent was limited and she didn't have the skill of composing poetry and couplets, she was literate in reading and writing. As she pulled out the letter paper, she felt a faint fragrance, which was exactly the study incense commonly used by big households.

She was familiar with this incense since childhood. Ever since she arrived at Master Zhou's place, this Master Zhou was uncouth and unrefined; these refined tastes of the study were completely absent in the house. Instead, many messy gadgets were added. The things You Rong learned through ears and eyes actually didn't find any use.

Smelling this familiar fragrance at this moment, she unconsciously had mixed feelings. For a moment, she was in a trance.

Seeing her daze, Granny Shi hurriedly reminded: "Miss, look at the letter."

You Rong then realized she lost her composure, her face feeling slightly hot. She hurriedly unfolded the letter paper, which turned out to be a Ten Bamboo Studio letter paper. This paper did not come from the local southern paper shop, but was "private paper" from Jiangnan, with good material selection and fine production, most elegant and fresh.

This Master Pan was not only rich but truly peerlessly elegant.

You Rong's heart thumped heavily. Originally, the illicit relationship with this Pan Cheng'an was just to comfort the loneliness in the deep boudoir. But gradually, it made her secretly give her heart to him.

On the letter paper was a stroke of beautiful Regular Script. It was the first time You Rong received Pan Cheng'an's letter. She had discernment; seeing this calligraphy, although somewhat artisan-like, one could see effort had been put into it. She couldn't help praising secretly.

The letter had no header above and no signature below, appearing very careful. The content inside was nothing special, nothing more than pouring out the bitterness of lovesickness. He didn't deliberately use flowery language to show off literary talent. A few words, simple and plain, but revealed various affections, hooking her romantic thoughts.

Immediately she put away the letter and whispered: "Sorry to trouble Mama."

"What words are these!" Granny Shi was an old hand of many years; seeing her expression, she knew there was ninety percent certainty. She said, "Master Pan said it's inconvenient to write some words in the letter, only asking this old body to pass a message, saying he misses you tightly, now doesn't think about tea and rice, only thinking of meeting Miss again..." Saying so, she took out a small box from the bundle and stuffed it into her hand. She whispered:

"This is what Master Pan gave you! He dares not give too conspicuous items, afraid of bringing you trouble. This is a pair of Australian seawater pearl earrings, most precious, yet inconspicuous to wear."

You Rong opened the mother-of-pearl box. Inside was a pair of pink pearl earrings, simple in style yet exquisite. The light pink pearls were not big but flowed with light and color.

You Rong had seen many good things, but it was the first time she saw such beautiful pearls. she was stunned unconsciously.

How was this "inconspicuous"? It was simply dazzling!

Leaving aside the gold material used on the earrings, just this pair of pink walking pearls (round pearls) would cost at least several hundred taels of silver in the big jewelry towers of the Capital.

Thinking of that Master Zhou, she had served him for these years and nominally gave birth to a son for him, counting as a "meritorious minister." Except for a box of jewelry "dowry" from Master Wang when she came, he had never given a single piece of jewelry.

Although Master Zhou made many fun and useful little gadgets, these things were just playthings or household items.

You Rong sighed and said: "This gift is too expensive." saying so, she hesitated instead.

Granny Shi received Pan Cheng'an's silver and whispered: "This little thing counts as nothing. heard that Master Pan is a son of a big household in Jiangnan, with countless family assets..."

"True, he is a person from Jiangnan. After a year or half in the Capital, he has to go back just the same?" You Rong couldn't help sighing.

Granny Shi smiled slyly: "Could it be that Miss wants to be a long-term couple?"

You Rong then realized she slipped up and hurriedly said: "You want to die! What nonsense are you talking!" After speaking, she hurriedly stuffed the box into her hand, "If you talk nonsense like this, don't come again in the future!"

Granny Shi chuckled and said: "Count it as this old woman's big mouth, should be beaten! Should be beaten!" saying so, she slapped her own mouth lightly twice. But she still put the jewelry box on the kang table and said, "This is Master Pan's heart. Miss just keep it as a memento. Master Pan won't stay in the Capital for too long either..."

This sentence hooked You Rong's state of mind. she hurriedly asked: "What? He is going back to the South?"

"Yes, he is originally a person from Jiangnan. Coming to the Capital to broaden his horizon. Just as Miss said, after a year or half, he has to go back?"

"How..." You Rong was anxious. For a moment, her heart was in a mess. There was reluctance to part, regret, and an indescribable state of mind, as if it were a Golden Millet Dream.

"Why going back so soon?"

"My good Miss!" Granny Shi slapped her thigh and said, "Master Pan has been in the Capital for more than a year. Originally he was going back South last autumn, but the ice froze early and the tribute grain boats couldn't sail, so he was delayed until now. Seeing that the river ice will melt in March, naturally he wants to go back."

You Rong was speechless, feeling lost for a moment.

Seeing the heat was enough, Granny Shi whispered: "What Master Pan can't let go of most is also Miss. He wants to have a parting gathering with Miss, wonder if Miss..."

After speaking, she peeped at You Rong.

You Rong unconsciously bit the handkerchief in her mouth, hesitating for a long time before saying: "It's just that the residence is not like before now..."

"Is it that little brat?"

"Yes, he is the follower of my Master's apprentice, originally a trivial miscellaneous hair not fit for the table," You Rong said hatefully, "It's just that now this apprentice is also highly regarded in front of Master Wang, so he also follows to tyrannize. When he came a few days ago, counting that he still considered this bit of incense burner relationship (old ties), he left some face. Otherwise, roughly he would drag both me and Yui out to listen to the reprimand!"

"So that's how it is." Granny Shi pretended to be disappointed, "If so, it's better not to go. Master Pan said, Miss yourself be careful, don't easily involve in danger..."

You Rong did not answer, pondered for a moment again and said: "Where does Master Pan make the appointment to meet, still Ganlu Nunnery?"

"Yes." Seeing her eyes determined, Granny Shi knew she made up her mind, secretly delighted in her heart, and whispered, "There is at least one month before the river ice melts."

"Okay. You come again in three days." You Rong whispered, "I naturally have a way to come out then."

"Okay." Granny Shi was overjoyed, "I'll go tell Master Pan right now. Is there any preparation needed?"

"You tell Master Pan..." You Rong instructed a few sentences. Granny Shi listened and nodded repeatedly, saying: "This old body understands!" After speaking, she was about to take her leave. You Rong stopped her:

"Where is the medicine I asked you for last time?"

"Look at this old body's memory!" Granny Shi laughed, "Brought it all but forgot."

She took out a small bottle from the bundle and said mysteriously: "Take one pill of this thing beforehand, take one pill immediately afterwards, take another pill the next day. Take for three consecutive days. Guaranteed no trouble."

" If there is trouble, you will have killed me!" You Rong spat.

"Miss rest assured, people who have taken this old body's medicine, if not thousands, are hundreds. Never had a blunder!" Granny Shi said fast with smiling eyes, "This old woman only hates that I didn't get this good recipe when I was young..."
