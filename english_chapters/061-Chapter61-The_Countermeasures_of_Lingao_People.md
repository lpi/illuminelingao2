Chapter 61 The Countermeasures of Lingao People

The news that the "Australian bandits" were building roads spread to Lingao County seat, causing panic among the officials and gentry.

County Magistrate Wu Mingjin convened an emergency meeting.

"These bandits are actually building roads!" Wu Mingjin paced back and forth in the hall, "What do they want to do? Attack the city?"

"It must be so." Liu Dalin (a retired official, local gentry leader) stroked his beard and analyzed, "If they don't attack the city, why build roads? They must want to transport siege equipment."

"Siege equipment?" Wu Mingjin shivered, "Could it be... Red Barbarian Cannons?"

Red Barbarian Cannons were the most powerful weapons at that time. If the bandits really had this thing, the small city wall of Lingao would definitely not be able to withstand it.

"We can't sit and wait for death!" A squire shouted, "We must take the initiative to attack!"

"Attack? How to attack?" Wu Mingjin smiled bitterly, "Our soldiers are few and weak, and can't beat them at all."

"Use harassment tactics." Liu Dalin suggested, "Send militia to harass their construction site at night, destroy their tools, and ambush their personnel. Make them unable to build roads smoothly."

"Good idea!" Wu Mingjin's eyes lit up, "Just do it!"

So, Lingao County organized a "Harassment Commando Team" composed of local militia and brave men. They carried bows, arrows, machetes and torches, and quietly approached the construction site of the Transmigrators at night.

However, they underestimated the vigilance of the Transmigrators.

The Transmigrators had already set up strict defenses around the construction site.

Searchlights swept back and forth, illuminating the surroundings as bright as day.
Sentries held guns and patrolled with police dogs.
Barbed wire and traps were also set up in the grass.

As soon as the harassment team approached, they were discovered by the sentries.

"Enemy attack!"

"Bang! Bang! Bang!"

Gunshots rang out. The harassment team members fell in a pool of blood before they could get close to the construction site.

"Run!" The rest of the people fled in panic.

The first harassment operation ended in failure.

However, the people of Lingao did not give up. They changed their tactics and began to attack the logistics supply line of the Transmigrators.

They dug trenches on the road, set roadblocks, and attacked the transport convoys of the Transmigrators.

This caused some trouble for the Transmigrators.

"These locals are really annoying." At a regular meeting, Xi Yazhou complained, "Like flies, buzzing all the time."

"We must teach them a lesson." Wen Desi said coldly, "Let them know that we are not easy to mess with."

So, the Transmigrators decided to launch a "Sweeping Operation".

They sent the PLA to sweep the villages around Lingao, confiscating weapons, arresting the leaders of the harassment team, and conducting "public trials" of those stubborn anti-Australian elements.

Under the strong suppression of the Transmigrators, the resistance forces in Lingao were quickly suppressed.

The villagers began to realize that these "Australians" were not ordinary bandits, but a powerful force that could not be defeated.

Some smart people began to change their attitudes and tried to cooperate with the Transmigrators.

"If you can't beat them, join them." This became the survival rule of many Lingao people.
