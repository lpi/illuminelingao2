Chapter 25 Weapons Issues

With the materials brought back by the North American Branch, the arsenal of the Transmigrators was greatly enriched.

In the warehouse of the training base, crates of guns and ammunition were neatly stacked.

"AR-15 rifles, 200. 5.56mm bullets, 50,000 rounds."
"Remington M870 shotguns, 50. 12-gauge shotgun shells, 10,000 rounds."
"Glock 17 pistols, 100. 9mm bullets, 20,000 rounds."
"M1911 pistols, 50. .45 ACP bullets, 10,000 rounds."
"Various sniper rifles, 10."
"Night vision devices, bulletproof vests, tactical vests..."

Looking at these modern weapons, Xi Yazhou couldn't close his mouth happily.

"Developed! Developed!" He kept rubbing his hands, "With these, we are invincible!"

However, Ma Qianzhu poured cold water on him again.

"Don't be happy too early." Ma Qianzhu picked up an AR-15, "These are good guns, but they consume ammunition too fast. 50,000 rounds of bullets, sounds like a lot, but in a fierce battle, a few minutes of shooting is enough to consume them all."

"And," he pointed to the sophisticated parts of the gun, "The structure of these guns is complex and maintenance is difficult. In the harsh environment of the Ming Dynasty, sand, dust and moisture are their natural enemies. Once broken, we don't have spare parts to replace."

"So," Ma Qianzhu concluded, "These modern weapons can only be used as 'killer maces' for special operations or emergency self-defense. Our main equipment still has to be those simple, reliable and easy-to-produce weapons."

"You mean... SKS?" Xi Yazhou asked.

"Yes, SKS." Ma Qianzhu nodded, "SKS semi-automatic rifle. Simple structure, reliable operation, high accuracy, and uses 7.62x39mm intermediate power cartridges. This cartridge is moderately powerful and easy to produce."

"More importantly," Ma Qianzhu added, "We have a full set of production drawings and tooling for SKS. We can mass-produce it in the Ming Dynasty."

"Okay." Xi Yazhou agreed, "Then equip the main force with SKS. Special forces use AR-15."

"Besides rifles, we also need cold weapons." Ma Qianzhu said, "In close combat, cold weapons are sometimes more effective than guns."

"Machetes? Bayonets?"

"No, I mean spears." Ma Qianzhu said seriously, "Spear array is the nemesis of cavalry. In the Ming Dynasty, we will face a large number of cavalry charges (such as the Qing army). A neat spear array can effectively stop them."

"Also, crossbows." Ma Qianzhu continued, "Crossbows are silent and smokeless, suitable for sneaking attacks and hunting. Moreover, crossbow bolts can be recycled."

So, the weapon configuration plan of the Transmigrators was finalized:

Main force infantry: SKS rifle + bayonet + spear + grenades.
Special forces: AR-15 rifle + pistol + sniper rifle + night vision device.
Militia/Police: Shotgun + revolver + crossbow + machete.
Heavy weapons: 12-pounder Napoleon cannon + Congreve rocket + mortar (simple version).

This was a "mixed" configuration combining ancient and modern, Chinese and Western elements. It took into account both firepower advantage and logistics sustainability.

In order to let everyone adapt to these weapons as soon as possible, the Military Group organized intensive shooting training.

"Bang! Bang! Bang!"
"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"

Gunshots and shouting echoed over the training base all day long.

Under the strict training of instructors, the shooting skills of the Transmigrators improved rapidly. From rookies who flinched at the sound of a gun, they grew into fighters who could shoot accurately.

Especially those female comrades. They were somewhat resistant to guns at first, but after training, they found that shooting was actually quite fun, and it could give them a sense of security.

"I hit the bullseye!" A female team member jumped up excitedly holding a pistol.

"Not bad." The instructor nodded, "Practice more, and you can protect yourself in the future."

Besides shooting, they also practiced bayonet fighting, grenade throwing, tactical movement...

Sweat soaked their clothes, and skin was worn out, but no one gave up.

Because they knew that on the battlefield of the future, these skills were the capital for saving lives.
