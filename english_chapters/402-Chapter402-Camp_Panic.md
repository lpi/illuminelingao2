# Chapter 402 - Camp Panic

"Of course we stand with the soldiers. They're the ones shedding blood and sweat for the transmigration enterprise. We cannot let their hearts grow cold!" Ma Qianzhu didn't hesitate. "But I understand what you mean—our own backsides aren't clean either." He gave a mocking laugh. "To be honest, none of this would be a problem if you people weren't constantly cozying up to feudal landlords."

Wu De gave a dry laugh but said nothing. Ma Jia also maintained a diplomatic silence—he always stayed out of topics with political overtones.

"Since we can't carry out direct confiscation-style nationalization, let's go with compensated nationalization instead. For servants who perform well and are willing to work with us long-term, we'll pay to redeem their freedom." Ma Qianzhu finished his complaint and continued.

Wu De nodded—this was probably the only way to satisfy both sides.

Only then did Ma Jia offer his opinion: "Adopting a redemption system causes relatively little damage to both parties' interests. The price of redemption should be set at different levels based on the servants' age and sex, referencing market prices to establish uniform pricing."

"Don't let those landlord gentry haggle," Ma Qianzhu said. "We must set a maximum price cap. We won't accept things like a girl priced at one hundred taels."

"Strictly speaking, this is a form of compulsory redemption—the master has no choice but to agree. The redemption price is essentially symbolic," Ma Jia said.

"What about runaways—"

"We naturally won't get involved with runaways. We'll just consider them free people. Otherwise what would we do—send them back to their masters?"

"Of course not," Wu De said. "For runaways from other places, as long as they become part of our system, we won't acknowledge their former servitude status."

"As for local runaways," he continued, "we'll help them redeem their freedom as you just described."

"We could set a statute of limitations—say, one year. If the master comes to claim them within one year, we'll pay to redeem them according to policy. After the deadline, their servant contracts become void," Ma Jia said.

"That's good—well-reasoned and justified." Wu De expressed his approval.

"As you wish. As long as our red flag flies over Bairren City, you can set whatever legal provisions you like," Ma Qianzhu said indifferently.

Ma Jia left the Executive Committee compound and returned to the farm's coffee house. The members of the Law Club were buried in their files—some flipping through books, others writing documents. Occasionally someone would put their heads together to discuss something. The tables were piled high with scrolls of paper, folders, ink bottles, unwashed pen nibs, inkstones for grinding ink—dip pens were now dipping traditional pine-smoke ink bought from Guangzhou. The modern and the traditional had achieved a perfect collaboration here.

Empty kvass jugs, wine bottles, cups, clay ashtrays stuffed with cigarette butts, and plates with food scraps were scattered everywhere. It looked like a garbage dump.

"Everyone's working hard!" Ma Jia called out in greeting. "How's progress?"

An Xi replied, "Almost done. Just a few more documents to wrap up."

"Everyone push a bit harder. Those merchants have been stuck in Bopu for over a week now. Let's finish up so they can be on their way." Ma Jia encouraged everyone while pouring himself a small glass of rum, tossing it back in one gulp.

"So the Maritime Law was officially approved?"

"Yes, it passed. Not easy!"

A small cheer arose from the people buried in their work.

An Xi said: "Today everyone was worried as they worked—if it hadn't passed, or if major revisions were required, a lot of what we've already done would have been wasted."

"There were some modifications and adjustments, but mostly within our expectations," Ma Jia said. "There might be some minor changes needed in places. The five-masted ship case will need some revisions." He pulled a document from his briefcase. "There are about twenty-odd changes."

"Alright, we'll correct them right away."

Ma Jia nodded. The stimulating effect of the strong liquor had raised a sweat all over his body, followed by a wave of exhausted weakness. The three consecutive hours of article-by-article debate over the Maritime Law in the Executive Committee meeting room the night before had left him completely drained. Many Executive Committee members had vehemently opposed certain provisions.

He had anticipated that matters involving the redistribution of interests would never pass easily. Some department heads might not directly oppose it themselves, but they would surely send people to vigorously "open fire." If he lost during the hearing phase, there would be no hope for the subsequent vote. So before the meeting, Ma Jia had mobilized all members of the Law Club to conduct mock Q&A sessions for every possible objection from each department.

"We must absolutely avoid being stumped by questions at the meeting, and our answers must be completely logically sound," Ma Jia had said at the preparatory meeting.

Fortunately, when it came to logic and argumentation skills, law school graduates still had certain advantages. Their preparation had been close to perfect, but there were always talented people in the world—and the transmigrator collective was no exception. At the meeting, Ma Jia could tell that several committee members had come prepared with their own high-caliber advisors backing them. If he hadn't done his homework thoroughly, Ma Jia wouldn't have dared say he could have held his own in this internal debate.

Until the final vote count was announced, he hadn't dared say his proposal would definitely pass.

The merchants and sailors who had been rescued from the five-masted ship and temporarily detained in Bopu had spent seven or eight days in anxious uncertainty. After landing, they had been treated reasonably well—someone had taken them to bathe and change clothes. They were housed in a large rectangular building. Large buckets of ginger soup had been brought over to help ward off the chill. Their personal belongings had been returned intact. The only downside was the crowded conditions—many fishing boats had come to shelter from the recent storms, so a building meant for twenty people now housed more than forty. They were also provided two hot congee meals a day. The rice was rough-milled but free of any impurities, and they could eat as much as they wanted.

Apart from using the latrine, these people weren't allowed to leave the building. Sentries guarded the door. Anyone who wanted to use the toilet had to get a "toilet tally" from the sentry.

Even when they could go outside, all they could see was a brick-paved courtyard. The courtyard contained several similar buildings, all apparently full of people. Bamboo fences surrounded the yard, densely covered with thorny climbing vines. The main gate to the courtyard was likewise guarded by sentries who lit bonfires at night. The overall feeling was that of a large prison.

In reality, the place they were staying was the Bopu Port Detention Center, specifically for accommodating fishermen, sailors, and merchants who were temporarily stranded due to storm shelter, shipwreck, or similar reasons. Concentrating them in one location for management was done for quarantine and counterintelligence purposes.

This state of affairs made them very uneasy. Could it be that they had become "fat sheep"—that these people who had rescued them from the pirates were themselves another band of pirates? Looking at the soldiers outside carrying bird-shot guns, this seemed possible. Contemplating such a terrible prospect, some lamented their ill fortune. Some small peddlers calculated that being robbed by pirates had already caused them severe losses—if they were now extorted for ransom on top of that, they would be ruined. They spent their days sighing and groaning.

They had already learned from the people managing the temporary detention center that they were in Lingao, under the control of the Australians. The reputation of the Australians had spread somewhat along the Guangdong coast these days. Most people knew that their goods were often of exceptional quality, but who would have expected their fighting prowess to be so formidable! The thought of not knowing how these people from overseas would deal with them left the survivors feeling anxious. Some tried to pay for information, but to no avail—neither the overseers inside nor the sentries on guard paid any attention to bribes. Their refusal to accept bribes and their silence only made everyone more anxious.

Then, one early morning, the breakfast they received was particularly good. Besides the congee, which was mixed with plenty of fish and shellfish, vegetables were also added. After they finished eating and the workers cleaned up, someone came to tell them to gather their belongings.

"Um, Old Chen, what's happening that we need to pack our things?" someone asked.

"Good news. Congratulations to everyone." The man called Old Chen was named Chen Zhonghuan, one of the older immigrants who had arrived in Lingao in the first batch of mainland migrants after D-Day. Because he was originally a fisherman, his household registration was placed under the Bopu Commune. Chen Zhonghuan had fallen seriously ill shortly after arriving in Lingao—he was on the brink of death when doctors from the Health Department saved his life. From then on, he regarded the "Australians" as his benefactors and became extremely enthusiastic about everything. Being old and frail, Wu De had given him a leisurely job specifically managing the port's temporary detention center.

But his words turned everyone's faces ashen. Chen Zhonghuan thought of himself as something like an innkeeper, but these people saw him as a jailer. In prison, the word "congratulations" was the last thing you wanted to hear—it usually meant you were about to be sent to meet your maker!

Making it worse, this morning's breakfast had been especially sumptuous. This had originally been Wu De's kindness—to give these victims of pirates a good meal before departure so they would leave with a favorable impression of the transmigrator collective. But they interpreted it as a "final meal" before execution. The room immediately descended into chaos, with some crying, some screaming, and some fainting on the spot. Chen Zhonghuan stood there in bewilderment, waving his hands: "What's gotten into all of you? You'll be heading home soon—what's there to cry about?"

The words "heading home" only deepened the misunderstanding, and the scene became even more chaotic. Despair is contagious. This group had barely escaped with their lives at sea and had spent the days since their rescue in constant anxiety about their fate. Now, hearing they were about to be executed, all the accumulated pressure erupted at once. Following someone's sudden shriek—
"I don't want to die!"—cries and screams filled the room.

"No one's going to die—" Chen Zhonghuan was startled, wondering how things had come to this.

But no matter how he shouted and explained, his voice was drowned out by the clamor of dozens of people crying and screaming. Chen Zhonghuan was so frightened he quickly called in the soldiers standing guard outside the door. The entrance of soldiers with gleaming bayonets only made those inside even more desperate—everyone thought the killing was about to begin. Some simply knelt on the ground motionless, ready to receive the fatal blow; others hurled themselves against the walls; still others grabbed whoever was next to them and started fighting. Weaker people were trampled underfoot, letting out agonized screams. Some were already bleeding... The scene was complete chaos.

"This is bad! It's a camp panic!" The sentry who had entered was none other than Huang Ande. After returning to Lingao with Liu San, Wu De saw that he was tall and strong and had a military background, so he had him return to his old profession. Huang Ande took things as they came; he was now an educational soldier receiving training at the new recruits' training camp. Today happened to be his day to stand guard at the detention center.

"A what?" Chen Zhonghuan asked urgently.

"It's a camp panic!" Huang Ande, being a former soldier, knew how terrifying this was.

The so-called "camp panic" often occurred in military camps or prisons—places where many people were packed into small spaces with high stress levels throughout the group, on the verge of a collective breakdown. Once someone screamed from a nightmare, it often triggered a chain reaction, sending the entire group into a hysterical state that could lead to people killing each other, with countless casualties—the consequences were extremely severe.

Huang Ande had witnessed a camp panic while serving in Shandong. Once it got out of control, even generals and commanders on the scene couldn't suppress it—let alone a few soldiers. With just these few people, there was no question of stopping it; charging in would probably only get them killed!

"Quick, get out." Huang Ande quickly pulled Chen Zhonghuan out the door. The other sentry also hurried out, his face pale.

Huang Ande fell back with the others about a dozen steps. He took a bullet and percussion cap from his belt and loaded his weapon in one smooth series of motions—this loading procedure, broken down into twenty-five steps, was something he practiced more smoothly than any of the other educational soldiers in this training class.

With his loaded rifle in hand, he calmed down somewhat. Remembering the emergency response training he had received before taking up guard duty, he shouted to the still-dazed Chen Zhonghuan:
"Quick, go ring the alarm bell!"

"I'm on it!" The old man's legs suddenly became nimble, and he actually jogged off.

The educational soldier standing next to him was fumbling to load his rifle, failing repeatedly to fit the percussion cap.

"Don't panic!" Huang Ande said, trying to calm him. "What's your name?"

"Qian—Qian—Duo!"

"Sounds like you don't have much money at all," Huang Ande joked.

"Right, right. Just a poor man." Qian Duo's nerves steadied somewhat, and he finally managed to fit the percussion cap. "What if they rush out? Should we shoot?"

"Don't worry, they won't rush out." Huang Ande knew that during a camp panic, people typically fought each other in place and rarely ran around.

Then the alarm bell rang. The detention center was not far from the quarantine camp. An infantry company stationed there with riot control equipment heard that something had happened and immediately dispatched an infantry platoon.

Huang Ande could see from a distance more than thirty men in rattan helmets and rattan armor, carrying bamboo rods and rattan shields, marching toward them in formation while chanting slogans. Chen Zhonghuan hurried over and began gesturing and explaining to the officer in charge.

"Attention! Tear gas ready!" Under a platoon leader's command, a squad holding single-use grenades ran up and deployed in a line.

"You can't use tear gas!" Huang Ande had learned in weapons class that they were loaded with pepper powder and were classified as "non-lethal" riot control weapons. But a camp panic wasn't an ordinary riot—using them wouldn't just fail to disperse the crowd; it would cause even greater chaos. He rushed over and, in his agitation, forgot the military salute he had learned, instead dropping to one knee before the platoon leader. "Sir! You mustn't use it!"

The platoon leader was startled: "Who are you?"

"I'm one of the sentries here." Huang Ande waved his hands urgently. "This is a camp panic! If you fire tear gas in there, things will get even worse. A lot of people will die!"

Seeing the platoon leader still hesitating, Huang Ande shouted: "I was a soldier before and I've seen this! The only thing to do is rush in and suppress it directly!"

The platoon leader wasn't from the Ming military and didn't know what a "camp panic" was, but seeing Huang Ande's grave expression and hearing him say that tear gas would kill many people, he ordered them not to fire the tear gas and instead sent men in directly to suppress the situation.

"Two by two, grab one person and drag them out at a time," the platoon leader directed.

With the riot infantry's rapid intervention, the disturbance in the detention center calmed down within ten-odd minutes. But the tragedy had already occurred—three people had been severely injured in the chaos, and almost everyone had been hurt to some degree.

Wu De hurried over and watched the blood-covered wounded being carried out, his face turning pale. This was the first time they had encountered such a bizarre incident.

Chen Zhonghuan was so frightened he dropped to his knees before Wu De: "Officer Wu—Chief Wu—I didn't say anything, I swear—"

"Get up." Wu De waved his hand. "This isn't your fault."

"Thank you, Chief." Chen Zhonghuan quickly got to his feet.

"Were you the one who said it was a camp panic and that we shouldn't use tear gas?" Wu De walked over to Huang Ande.

"Yes, it was me—"

"You're a soldier!"

"Yes! Educational Soldier Huang Ande! I was the one who said it!" Huang Ande quickly recalled what he had learned in recruit training—head up, chest out, speaking loudly.

"How did you know this was a camp panic?"

"I used to be a soldier in Shandong. We had a camp panic in our camp once! I witnessed it."

"Good, your handling of this was excellent!" Wu De said to the cadet beside him. "Tell Wei Aiwen—Educational Soldier Huang Ande handled a crisis appropriately. Give him a merit for this!"

"Thank you, Chief!" Huang Ande said loudly, rendering a somewhat awkward military salute.

Jiang Qiuyan also came rushing over. As a psychologist, he was very interested in "camp panic," this group psychological phenomenon. Of course, there was a practical element to this interest as well: the transmigrators' military forces were growing larger, and the quarantine camps constantly held thousands of people. If an incident like a camp panic occurred, the consequences would be unimaginable.

As soon as he arrived, he pulled Chen Zhonghuan, Huang Ande, and the others aside to ask about the situation. He also questioned several participants—these people had been completely drained by their earlier outburst and lay limp on the ground. Now that they had heard the Australians had no intention of killing them, they were finally able to let their hearts settle. But none of them could clearly describe what had happened in that moment—their minds had gone completely blank.

"It was caused by excessive psychological stress," Jiang Qiuyan said. "A concentrated release of accumulated pressure."

"Psychological stress? We've been giving them good food and drink since they came ashore."

"Good food and drink, true, but people in an unfamiliar environment still easily accumulate stress. And the living space was a bit too crowded." Jiang Qiuyan said. "I'll give them some opium tincture and let them have a good sleep, and they'll be fine."
