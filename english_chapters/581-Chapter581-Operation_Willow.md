# Chapter 581 - Operation Willow

Saoye had never encountered officials who refused money before. He was so astonished he forgot even to call for the sedan chair bearers to resume. Advisor Han quickly gave the order, and the party finally set off again.

Once the sedan chair entered the city, there were no obvious Australian traces within the county town. However, looking closely, Australian handiwork could be seen: the recently paved and leveled main street, for instance, and the drainage channels still being dug on both sides.

What surprised Li Luoyou was the degree of cleanliness here. Not only were there no stagnant muddy pools, no scattered garbage, but even the usual urine and excrement in wall corners were entirely absent—things you couldn't avoid even in Guangzhou. Let alone a remote little county like Lingao.

Shops along the street were few—a few general stores, teahouses, and such. The shops weren't large, but their frontages were neat and clean. Li Luoyou could tell these buildings had recently been renovated, walls not just whitewashed but brickwork repaired.

The county town seemed quite deserted, though the atmosphere was peaceful and calm. Li Luoyou wondered: how did Lingao's county magistrate get along with the Australians? Could he really be cowering in the yamen playing deaf and dumb? Such composure was quite impressive!

Lingao County town was small. After barely two or three hundred paces, the sedan chair turned onto a cross street and arrived at Runshitang's premises. The sedan chair didn't enter through the main gate but turned the corner through a side gate, carried directly to the second reception hall. Stewards and servants were already waiting to receive them.

The carrying poles were removed, the armrests taken down, and Saoye hurried forward to lift the sedan curtain.

"Greetings to Master." The receiving stewards and servants immediately kowtowed.

Li Luoyou saw that Runshitang was quite substantial, and the servants conducted themselves with the manner of a great household, which pleased him somewhat. The complete lack of hierarchy among the Australians' staff had irritated him greatly.

Li Luoyou's arrival had already been reported to the Executive Committee by Liu San. This merchant's basic information had been added to the intelligence department's files after Liu San's visit to Foshan. It was later upgraded in priority due to his large-scale iron purchases in Guangdong. However, Li Luoyou's file remained fairly simple. The transmigrator collective had no intelligence sources on the mainland besides the Guangzhou and Leizhou stations.

After the establishment of the External Intelligence Bureau, they conducted a supplementary investigation of important native figures whose files had been created during the Intelligence Committee era. Li Luoyou was among them. The Guangzhou Station collected much material about him from various public sources, and gradually this person's profile became clearer.

The External Intelligence Bureau didn't know the exact depth of Li Luoyou's relationship with the Later Jin, but they at least knew he had trade relations with Later Jin-controlled territories, and these relations weren't superficial.

"Consider, everyone, what does this Li Luoyou sell?" Yu Eshui said. "Liaodong goods. Especially ginseng. Someone who can trade ginseng definitely has influence in the Later Jin regime."

After Nurhachi raised his banner, the Later Jin placed extreme importance on ginseng as a medicinal material, even establishing a special official, the "Wor-huo-da Zhang-jing," specifically to manage ginseng collection, storage, and sales—it was their main export for purchasing various goods from within the passes, its importance comparable to oil for Gulf states.

For Li Luoyou to trade ginseng, he must not only have certain connections within the Later Jin but must also be colluding with local military families at the various Liaodong border garrisons. Otherwise, with the court banning Liaodong trade, he couldn't possibly transport goods back and forth over such great distances.

In other words, gaining Li Luoyou's cooperation would be equivalent to opening a Hainan-Liaodong trade route. Trade and intelligence networks could thereby be established.

Moreover, Li Luoyou wasn't merely an adventurous Liaodong trader—he also possessed extensive commercial networks within the passes. The transmigrator collective could greatly leverage his connections to establish their intelligence and commercial networks.

Previously, the transmigrator collective hadn't expanded their mainland networks. Manpower shortage was one factor, but lack of local contacts and unfamiliarity with the territory were also problems. Ancient local societies were quite closed; without local connections for introductions and protection, outsiders had great difficulty establishing themselves. Though Gao Ju's influence was extensive, outside Guangdong he was only useful in the capital—elsewhere he was insignificant.

They weren't in a hurry to reach the capital, but Jiangnan was a region the transmigrator collective urgently wanted to penetrate. In the collective's future plans, Jiangnan would be their primary market for selling goods and procuring materials.

Jiangnan's rice, cloth, and silk in particular were trade commodities the collective coveted, and the region's flourishing commerce provided an ideal market for the collective's financial services.

Thus, while Li Luoyou was still in Foshan awaiting departure, Lingao's various departments had already begun mobilizing for this.

Though they didn't yet fully understand Li Luoyou's purpose in coming, his objective in visiting Lingao was obviously to do business. And the most likely business possibility was weapons and munitions.

The External Intelligence Bureau had learned that Li Luoyou was lobbying the Governor-General and Governor's offices in Guangdong, hoping to cast cannon for the government. His visit to Lingao was probably for similar purposes—after all, the transmigrators were known for their "formidable firearms."

But within the transmigrator collective, there was little enthusiasm for exporting weapons. While arms dealing was the most profitable trade, it consumed the collective's "strategic materials": metal and coal. With both in short supply, large-scale exports were hard to accept.

As for the technological gap and the possibility of Ming or Later Jin copying their weapons, the Industrial Department felt there was no need for excessive concern. Given the level of Lingao-manufactured weapons, hand-crafted imitation was virtually impossible. At most, copies might look similar in appearance and structure, but the gap in materials quality and processing standards would degrade the copies' performance to very low levels.

The final decision was to avoid mentioning weapons first, and instead try to sell him other industrial products. These could be distributed nationwide and to Liaodong through his channels. A money-making opportunity—Li Luoyou surely wouldn't refuse. Especially since the transmigrator collective hoped to use his commercial network to promote their financial product—Delung Bank bills of exchange—to major cities, then roll out the collective's currency when the time was ripe.

All this depended on Li Luoyou's impression of the transmigrator collective. A special working group was therefore established to handle him, composed of temporary personnel from Intelligence, Political Security, Trade, and Administrative departments. The operation regarding Li Luoyou was codenamed "Operation Willow."

The person chosen to lead "Operation Willow" was Liu San. Li Luoyou had come to Lingao through the Yang Runkaitang-Runshitang connection. Liu San was both an Elder and a Runshitang shareholder, as well as Yang Shixiang's sworn brother, and had once met Li Luoyou. Whether from principle or personal connection, having him make contact was most appropriate and convenient.

Liu San received all intelligence materials on Li Luoyou. To avoid over-stressing his sworn brother, he wasn't told about "Operation Willow." Liu San thought it better to let contact occur naturally—best if the other party made the first move, to gain some initiative in negotiations.

Yang Shixiang was already waiting in the flower reception hall under the eaves. After they met, there was naturally a round of courtesies and polite phrases about "long admired" and "honored to meet." Li Luoyou inevitably complimented him on "reviving the family business." This was Yang Shixiang's proudest achievement; the flattery naturally hit the right spot. He'd been curious about this merchant introduced by his cousin: the cousin's letter only said the visitor was very curious about the "Australians" and hoped to tour Lingao, incidentally seeing if there might be business opportunities with the Australians.

Though his cousin's letter was vague, Yang Shixiang knew his cousin wouldn't specially write to him for just an ordinary merchant. This person must be very important—possibly even a government official.

Yang Shixiang saw the man was about forty, medium height, long face with a short beard, with the air of a prosperous gentleman. But looking closely, his gaze was quite sharp—a man who'd weathered great storms.

Yet at first sight, he had a strange sense of familiarity, as if he'd seen him somewhere before. He wondered about this secretly. Seeing the servants had already served tea, he asked: "Has the guest room for Master You been prepared?"

"Yes, Master You will stay in the East Guest Courtyard," the steward quickly replied. "How should the red-haired gentleman be accommodated? Please instruct us, Master."

"Please have him rest in the East Guest Courtyard for now." Yang Shixiang had already known from the letter that a red-haired merchant would be coming.

The East Guest Courtyard was newly expanded by Runshitang. Since Runshitang prospered, visiting merchants and colleagues had increased. The original guest quarters weren't sufficient, so this new one was built specifically for honored guests. Five rooms wide with front and rear wing rooms—enough to accommodate Li Luoyou's entire party. Furnishings and supplies were complete.

Li Luoyou's trunks and luggage were checked off item by item by Saoye and sent to the guest courtyard for arrangement. Li Luoyou also brought four types of Foshan local specialties as meeting gifts.

The gifts weren't too substantial—to show friendship—but weren't light either, since he was unfamiliar here and would be imposing on his hosts for everything.

"Master You, this is too generous." Yang Shixiang felt somewhat uneasy; for their level of acquaintance, the gift was rather lavish.

"No matter. I'll certainly be troubling Manager Yang for assistance." When Li Luoyou saw that irrelevant people had withdrawn from the flower hall, leaving only himself and his counterpart's personal servants, he spoke:

"My surname isn't You." Actually, he'd met this manager before, as well as Liu San—though it had been a brief encounter. There was no need to hide his true identity from them. "My surname is Li. Liaohai Trading in Guangzhou is my establishment."

"So it's Master Li the Great Merchant! My apologies! My apologies!" Yang Shixiang was greatly surprised. Everything suddenly clicked into place. Wasn't this Master Li the great merchant he'd seen at his cousin's banquet when he'd gone to Foshan with his sworn brother?!

He hadn't paid much attention to this great merchant's background before, but as Runshitang's position in Guangdong's pharmacy circles rose, he'd learned a bit about this influential figure. This man was quite legendary in Guangdong merchant circles. As a youth in Macau, he'd been an errand boy for the Portuguese and learned fluent Portuguese. Later he went to Liaodong to manage the family business. When Guangning's garrison was abandoned, he'd fled from Guangning, barely surviving the harrowing journey. The Li family's century of Liaodong property was lost overnight. Returning within the passes, relying on the remnants left in the capital, he went south to Guangdong to do foreign trade business. Within barely ten years, he'd rebuilt the family fortune, becoming a renowned great merchant in Guangdong.

That Li Luoyou traded Liaodong goods was an open secret in Guangdong merchant circles; officialdom naturally knew as well. With just money, without some backing and means, he couldn't peacefully enjoy being a wealthy gentleman.

"My visit has several purposes I'd like to request help with." Li Luoyou came straight to the point, not at all hiding his intentions.

"Of course, of course." Yang Shixiang nodded thoughtfully. This Master Li of Guangdong's merchant circles had come under an alias; there must be important matters. And these matters likely involved the Australians. Thus one must be cautious.

Beyond being careful, he couldn't help feeling a small sense of pride. As he'd once been, tending to this half-dead little pharmacy, how could he have dreamed of a great personage like Li Luoyou coming to pay him a visit!

But for such a person to suddenly venture alone to Lingao to visit him, the matters to discuss were surely no small thing.

"I'd like to meet with the Australians, and I hope Manager Yang can act as intermediary."

Yang Shixiang felt quite hesitant. This wasn't unexpected, but the Australians in Lingao numbered a thousand if not five hundred—which ones did he want to meet? If he wanted to meet major leaders like "Director Wen" or "Lord Ma," Yang Shixiang wasn't sure his sworn brother's word would even carry weight.

"I'll do my best." Yang Shixiang nodded. He decided not to reveal Liu San's true identity for now. Better to consult with Liu San first before deciding.

That very evening, he sent for Liu San and conveyed Li Luoyou's request.

"This brother dared not promise him first, nor did I say you're Australian. This matter is of great importance and must be handled cautiously." He specifically reminded Liu San that Li Luoyou might well be a government agent sent to probe Lingao's situation. He might also be here to negotiate something on behalf of the government.

"At that banquet in Foshan where we first met Li Luoyou, there was an official present."

Liu San naturally knew about this—not just knew, but knew this official was a Jinyiwei probationary centurion. But there was no need to tell his sworn brother; it would only frighten him.

"Brother's advice is wise," Liu San said. "Since he wants to meet with us, you may promise him."

"I don't know the Australian hierarchy. What level of person does this Master Li want to meet? What if he wants to meet your major leaders?"

"I'll handle that myself." Liu San said. "If he wants to meet Director Wen, I'll convey the request. Whether to meet or not is another matter."

"Good." Yang Shixiang nodded, then added: "Brother should notify your colleagues to devise a response strategy." Yang Shixiang warned him, "With you building cities and training troops here like this, the court will get involved sooner or later. If a large army arrives, there'll be devastation. You should plan ahead."

Liu San was unconcerned, only instructing him to host their distinguished guest well. As for Liu San himself, he'd be staying at Runshitang frequently going forward. For convenience, he hoped Yang Shixiang could allocate a quiet, out-of-the-way courtyard with easy access for his use.
