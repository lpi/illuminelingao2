# Chapter 432 Education Foundation

Wang Ci was satisfied with the various sponsorships and systems proposed by Xiong Buyou. However, he made it clear: the school's curriculum must be decided by the Academy Head, and the Crossing Group could not insert their own books for teaching. Xiong Buyou readily accepted this point. In his view, Moli Xuan Academy had absolutely no connection to the Crossing Group's future educational endeavors—they could teach whatever they wanted. For the Crossing Group, the reopening of Moli Xuan Academy was itself a victory. At least in form, they had completed a collaboration with Lingao's local intellectual class.

From the perspective of ordinary common folk, since the scholars who were always talking about benevolence and righteousness could accept sponsorship from the Australians, why couldn't they, the little common people? China's scholars had always been regarded as models for society. Their allegiance often influenced many classes.

Before the opening ceremony even ended, a group of raggedly dressed *tongsheng* squeezed in front of Liu Dalin and Wang Ci, earnestly expressing their fervent desire to study and advance, moving both men to tears. Xiong Buyou, however, made a malicious comment about the scene:

"Hmph, they're definitely here looking for free meals."

But that was fine too. People looking for free meals were generally not difficult to handle. Xiong Buyou didn't concern himself with their specific enrollment matters. He had already agreed with Wang Ci that three slots in the academy would be reserved for the Crossing Group—one of which was for Zhang Xingjiao.

As for the other two, the Crossing Group had not yet selected suitable candidates. The personnel from the Social Work Department responsible for this work believed that sending young people back to an academy concentrated with traditional values before completing their thorough brainwashing was dangerous—there was a risk of counter-brainwashing.

As for Zhang Xingjiao, due to his hatred, he had already completely tied himself to the Crossing Group's boat. When attacking the Gou Family Manor, his hands had been stained with the blood of the Gou family members—he couldn't go back now. He could only wholeheartedly work with the Crossing Group.

Wang Ci had some misgivings about letting Zhang Xingjiao come to study, but thinking that all this was provided by the Australians, it was inconvenient to object. So he agreed.

After the ceremony ended, those who attended the opening received a commemorative gift. The gentry, including several provincial graduates and county officials, each received a rattan-covered thermos bottle—this novelty was treated by everyone as a treasure. The ordinary scholars received 50 Yuan in Circulation Vouchers. Everyone was already very familiar with the uses of this paper currency. As for Liu Dalin, he had originally resolved not to accept any gifts, but the gift presented made him unable to refuse.

It was a wheelchair. It was carefully manufactured by the Manufacturing Committee's machine factory. Apart from not being able to fold, it was structurally identical to modern wheelchairs. Family members could push it, and he himself could roll the wheel rims to move forward. To reduce weight, it used steel wheel rims and hubs, and locally produced ball bearings were installed on the axle—the quality wasn't great, but it worked. The ball bearings greatly reduced the friction on the axle, making rolling require much less force.

The only drawback was the lack of rubber, making the ride somewhat "hard."

This thing truly hit Liu Dalin's sweet spot. Though there were plenty of servants at home, moving around always required two servants to help carry the chair, which was quite inconvenient. Now, with this wheeled chair that could move freely forward and backward, it undoubtedly brought great convenience to his daily life.

Liu Dalin tried sitting in it. Whether moving forward or backward, or turning left and right, it was impressively convenient. The onlookers marveled one after another. Liu Dalin secretly praised in his heart: *No wonder they say the Australians "have marvelous skills and excel in all crafts." It's truly well-deserved.*

He could refuse gadgets like thermos bottles, but this thing was just too useful. So he accepted it. Xiong Buyou nodded to himself. That guy Wu Nanhai really had some tricks. His suggestion of giving a specially made wheelchair had indeed worked!

*Once you use our wheelchair, you can't do without our door-to-door service. The wheelchair needs to be oiled and the bearings replaced. In this space-time, apart from us, no one can help you with these things.*

Unexpectedly, after this wheelchair appeared, it also brought business opportunities. A gentleman pushed through the crowd and gave a deep bow to Xiong Buyou, who was grinning with delight. This startled him.

It was Liu Youren of the Liu Family Village from Jialai. The Liu Family Village was the only local major landlord participating in the Tiandihui. He had purchased the title of *jiansheng* and was considered a scholar, so he was also invited to attend the opening ceremony. For this, Liu Youren had even changed into a Confucian robe. However, this kind of clothing didn't match his rustic country squire appearance.

It turned out his purpose was to buy two more wheelchairs.

"My elderly parents are advanced in years. Their legs are weak, and they have difficulty moving. If you could kindly sell me two such wheelchairs, I, Liu, would be extremely grateful."

When he said this, several other gentlemen also squeezed forward, hoping to buy wheelchairs for their elders. Xiong Buyou hadn't expected this special product to have such business opportunities. He hurriedly announced there was temporarily no stock and that everyone should wait a few days. The East Gate Market would naturally have supply. The crowd was insistent and wanted to place orders with silver on the spot. Xiong Buyou thought that manufacturing a few wheelchairs probably wouldn't have any negative impact on Lingao's industrial system, so he accepted the orders—but didn't take the silver. How much to charge for them still needed to be discussed.

This unexpected interlude brought a perfect conclusion to the Moli Xuan Academy opening ceremony. Everyone was delighted. Liu Dalin's family members solemnly carried the wheelchair behind his sedan chair and majestically returned to the city. The gentlemen had their family members carefully hold the thermos bottles while they sat in sedan chairs going home. The *tongsheng* and *xiucai* clutched their Circulation Vouchers and hurried to the East Gate Market to shop—their wives and children had been talking about the many good things there for a long time. Those from the Nanbao area didn't need to, as these vouchers could also be used at the local Nanbao Mining Bureau's service store.

Wang Ci was excited and couldn't calm down for a long time, pacing circles in the courtyard of Moli Xuan. He very much wanted to compose a few poems and was racking his brain to select words and phrases. But Xiong Buyou interrupted his poetic mood—there were other details to discuss with him.

After some negotiations, both parties agreed to use Lingao's school lands as the capital of the "Lingao Education Foundation," with specific operations handled by the "Tiandihui" under the Crossing Group. Lingao County School would not collect any form of rent from the Tiandihui. The county school would not interfere with any form of development or utilization of the school lands by the Tiandihui.

In return, the Tiandihui would bear all the daily operation and maintenance expenses of Lingao County School, the Confucian Temple, and Moli Xuan Academy, including the various living allowances paid to *xiucai* and *tongsheng*. At the same time, the grain taxes owed by the school lands would also be borne by the "Tiandihui."

In other words, Wang Ci handed over the "perpetual tenancy rights" and rent collection rights of the school lands in exchange for the Tiandihui's full financial aid for the county school.

All these funds would be settled in Circulation Vouchers, deposited under the "Lingao Education Foundation" account at Delong Grain Shop. As for the foundation, it would be co-chaired by Tiandihui Chairman Ye Yuming and Wang Ci. Apart from regular daily expenses, any extraordinary expenses required the agreement of both parties before withdrawal.

After reaching the agreement, Wang Ci felt that the funding problem that had been troubling him was finally solved. He would never need to worry about funding again. As for the school lands, they were still under the county school's name; they were just "perpetually leased" to the Tiandihui.

For the Crossing Group, the Agricultural Committee was confident: the income from the school lands after using scientific farming methods would be sufficient to cover the regular expenses of the county school and academy. There might even be considerable surplus—even without surplus, the Executive Committee felt it was worthwhile, at least extremely helpful in winning over local intellectuals' hearts.

Besides Moli Xuan Academy, the repairs to the county school and Confucian Temple were also proceeding intensively. Before long, these repair projects were successively completed. And the allowances provided by the foundation caused the county school, which had been abandoned for a long time, to once again resound with the sounds of students reciting. The stipend students returned one after another. The foundation not only paid the stipend students the prescribed six *dou* of rice monthly subsidy but also had Wang Ci list the attached students and increased students from families with financial difficulties to study at the county school, also giving them six *dou* of rice. The Short Hairs, whose reputation among scholars hadn't been very good, suddenly became "Australians."

Having accomplished this, Xiong Buyou was in a very happy mood. He led his people out of the city and boarded the public ox-cart from the county's west gate to Bairen Castle. After a trial run of the ox-cart freight system, Shan Daoqian had also set up a simple ox-cart public transit system. Transfer stations were set up in Bopu and the East Gate Market, with temporary ox pens and vehicle repair facilities. Starting from 5 AM to 4 PM, departures were every hour. Several boarding and alighting stops were set along the route. They used large four-wheeled carts pulled by two oxen. The carts had seats and step boards for getting on and off, as well as folding canopies for rainy days. To accommodate local farmers who habitually carried large amounts of goods, luggage racks for hanging rattan baskets and loose cargo were also installed on the outside of the carriage.

These ox-carts were not only for Transmigrators to ride but also for natives. The fare was extremely cheap—one *fen* in Circulation Vouchers could take you from Bopu to the East Gate Market. As they built the School Land Manor outside the west gate, the transit route also extended to outside the county's west gate. The fare increased by one *fen*—two *fen* and you could ride to the county town. This greatly facilitated travel for people along the route.

The roads and ox-cart transit system gradually made the people of Lingao aware of what public services were—this kind of public service provided by the authorities for the benefit of all people was almost nonexistent in traditional Chinese society. Which was better, the public services provided by the Crossing Group or what the Lingao County Yamen did, was immediately obvious. The punctuality of the public ox-carts also slowly instilled the concept of precise time into the people's minds.

Unfortunately, the Crossing Group had not yet been able to manufacture clocks and watches, and thus couldn't further instill modern time concepts into the natives. Dr. Zhong Lishi's entire energy was focused on developing wireless radios—that was more urgent than clocks.
