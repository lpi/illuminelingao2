# Chapter 79: Lingao's Counterattack (Part 2)

The county's counterattack plan came primarily from Liu Dalin and Huang Shoutong—unwittingly forming the typical Ming pattern of civilian control over military. *Jinshi* Liu was deeply learned; influenced by late-Ming political turmoil, he'd read many military texts and had some grasp of overall strategy. Militia Commander Huang had years of front-line experience, having fought countless small-scale battles, well-versed in tactical command. The officials and gentry, seeing this arrangement, felt reassured.

From the scouts, they learned the pirates were encamped separately at Bopu and Bairrentou Beach. Scouts had seen women at Bairrentou Beach—indicating the pirates' main camp was there. Main camp meant headquarters should be there too.

Though many troops had gathered in the city, few could actually fight. Huang Shoutong, a local native who'd led militia for years, knew well which forces could fight and which only bullied civilians. The truly usable troops numbered only about one hundred of his own Huang Family Village militia, plus militia and retainers from a few local landlord-gentry households—barely 200 together. He planned to use these as combat troops to directly assault the pirates' command center, ideally killing several leaders in one stroke.

Some gentry questioned this strategy: wouldn't killing pirate leaders provoke crazed retaliation?

"In war, never harbor false hopes." Huang Shoutong stroked his chin-whiskers. "Once blades are drawn, fight to the finish. Don't think showing mercy earns retreat later—enemies will see you as weak and vulnerable, pressing even harder." He swept his gaze over everyone, naturally commanding. "Beat them until they hurt, until they're afraid—then they'll roll away on their own."

They decided on two-pronged action. The left column, with Huang Family Village militia as main force, would bring two *huzhun* cannons dismounted from the city walls, plus many fire-rockets and powder grenades—300 men total, personally led by Huang Shoutong, attacking Bairrentou Beach directly. The right column, led by Fu Bowen with over 300 men—mostly conscripted commoners—would carry many flags, horns, and drums to make a feinted attack on Bopu camp as diversion. To prevent pirates having scouts outside the city, both columns would depart together, appearing to march toward Bopu, then the left column would turn back halfway to surprise-attack Bairrentou Beach.

The two columns agreed: fire as the signal. The right column would attack Bopu first; then the main force would attack. Either column withdrawing would signal with smoke.

City garrison besides yamen runners: 200 men. The county archers and militia, owed wages too long, worried Magistrate Wu—he feared if left to guard the city and things went badly, they'd riot and plunder city and countryside. Village militia, he couldn't fully trust either. So he mixed them: militia, archers, garrison soldiers all scrambled together for city defense. Militia who didn't want to fight could only bribe the registrar; those with no money were driven off resentfully.

On the sixteenth of the ninth month, preparations were complete. In city streets, pots were set up for cooking. Many were eating their first proper meal all year—crowding around the pots, drooling, inhaling the aroma.

"Heavens, finally a full meal."

"Normally only get proper rice during harvest—these past two years, not even then."

"Weather's gone mad—Lingao getting frost!"

"Afraid this meal is our last."

"Don't speak ill luck."

County Vice-Magistrate Wu Ya brought several hundred strings of cash—departure bonus—plus twenty sets of newly quilted cotton armor. Such armor was easy to make but too hot for South-Sea weather, so rarely used—these were rush-produced. Huang Shoutong knew the magistrate was relying on him as bastion; deeply moved, he thanked him repeatedly, resolving to fight hard.

He summoned his second son. Huang Shoutong's second son, Huang Bingkun, was a county-school student, a *shengyuan*. Seeing his younger brother newly dead just days ago, his father now preparing for battle with a fight-to-the-death air—he felt deeply uneasy.

"Bingkun, your father goes to fight pirates today." He stroked his knee. "These pirates are fierce. I have no full confidence in this campaign..."

"Father—"

"Don't speak." Huang Shoutong said solemnly. "Your father is past fifty. If something happens, you and your elder brother needn't grieve too much. Your elder brother, though brave, doesn't like studying—not as clever as you. So I give only you this instruction: These ten-plus years, signs of chaos have grown in the realm. We're fortunate to be in a remote small county. But once great chaos comes, petty villains will seize opportunities to cause trouble. First, lead our sons to take up arms defending homeland. Second, follow Heaven's mandate!" He stared into his son's eyes. "Don't let reading too many books give you foolish loyalty and filial piety—understand?!"

"Yes! Your son understands." Huang Bingkun understood yet was confused, but dared not ask more.

"Soon you'll leave with me, then turn back to Huang Family Village on the way."

"Your son wishes to fight alongside father!"

"Foolish boy..." Huang Shoutong sighed deeply. "You're a *xiucai*. War is perilous. The Huang family cannot be without you!"

"But there's Elder Brother—"

"Your elder brother is a commoner." The old master donned cotton armor with servant help. "Magistrate Wu will eventually transfer out. Will the new magistrate remember our bloody service? Having a *xiucai* makes our words carry weight."

Hearing this, he finally understood his father's deep intentions—yet felt a hidden unwillingness.

Huang Shoutong instructed his son, then led the main force out of the city. On the road, he felt moved by Magistrate Wu's trust yet couldn't shake a dark premonition: these pirates who sailed on giant iron ships, who drove machines no human strength could match—they weren't the bandits and thugs he'd always dealt with. Their arrival perhaps meant many things would change utterly. He looked up at the sky—only faint clouds, yet to him, the sun seemed dim and lightless. Was this Great Ming realm truly facing great upheaval?

On the road, after splitting forces, he brought his troops to within two *li* of Bairren Rapids. On one hand, waiting for the Bopu feint to begin; on the other, listening to scout reports. He was determined: if Bairrentou Beach was currently undefended, he'd attack early even without Fu Bowen's signal.

Soon, scouts reported: the Bairrentou Beach pirates had all withdrawn into their camps; no one was moving outside. Huang Shoutong nodded—not unexpected. The enemy's scouts probably knew their movements already.

Waiting a bit longer, suddenly they saw smoke-fire signals from the Bopu direction. Knowing Fu Bowen had begun his attack, he rode his horse up a small hill.

"Fellow elders and brothers, we're about to charge the enemy lines. We're all natives here—generations have lived on this land. Here are our fields and houses, our ancestors' graves and shrines..." At this, he felt tears well up. "Today is the day we defend our homeland and serve the court. Everyone, follow me!"

With that, he spurred his horse, leading his mounted retainers as vanguard, galloping toward Bairrentou Beach. The militia split into two columns, following the dozen-plus riders in their charge. Cannon crews, ten-odd men each, pushed and pulled desperately to get the two *huzhun* cannons to the front.

He Ming, on the administrative-zone watchtower, had seen their assembly through binoculars. Now seeing dust clouds blotting the sky, drums rolling in waves, he knew the attack had begun. He grabbed his walkie-talkie to sound the alarm. Almost simultaneously, a piercing siren shrieked across Bairrentou Beach. Everyone stiffened—*the attack has started!*

"Group Leader He... Leader..." The arriving messenger was from the Communications Group, speech now unclear. "Bopu is under attack! Enemy is besieging Bopu!"

He Ming frowned. From the observation post's tracking reports, he'd known the enemy had split forces—obviously one had to be a feint. But both columns had similar numbers, both had many handcarts; now both had launched attacks nearly simultaneously...

"Tell Bopu to hold!" Bopu's defenses were much more complete than Bairrentou Beach; now with over 100 defenders including ten Military Group members, he felt holding shouldn't be a problem.

Rather, this was the command center. Construction had spread out, leaving many places to defend: the residential zone, equipment and vehicle storage, the power station, the newly completed administrative zone. Most positions had only two lines of barbed wire and one earth berm. How much fighting power these city homebodies who'd barely fired a dozen shots had—still unknown.

Huang Shoutong's forces charged to the trench edge, tossing prepared sandbags and brush bundles in, instantly laying a crossing path. Then gunfire erupted. Immediately, a dozen men around him fell—*pirate firearms are fearsome!* He ducked low, spurring his horse to gallop. Gunfire continued unbroken; men kept falling. He wheeled his horse, deciding not to attack the deeper pirate main camp but to concentrate on the nearest enclosure. He pointed his broadsword:

"Brothers, charge!"

The enclosure he'd chosen was precisely the administrative zone—newly completed, barbed wire only installed yesterday. Fifty people defended it, including ten Military Group members.

"Mengxian! You handle suppressive fire!" He Ming roared into the walkie-talkie. "Shoot the mounted ones."

Before he finished, a saber-brandishing mounted militiaman dropped from his horse with a gunshot.

"Damn—nice shot!" He couldn't help praising. This finance major who'd spent years at sports school practicing moving-target shooting really did shoot well.

By now, militia were surging forward like wave upon wave. Gunfire became chaotic. Those behind the barbed wire saw these men, each baring teeth and howling, waving all sorts of weapons as they charged—most transmigrators had been law-abiding citizens; forget shooting people, they'd barely seen a few street fights. Facing such a scene, they gaped in panic. After one shot, they froze—only scattered shots rang out.

"Shoot! You idiots!" He Ming grabbed an SKS rifle, flicked the bayonet out with a sharp swing, and rushed forward, kicking and shaking them.

Finally, volley fire rang out. The charging gray wave hesitated momentarily, then surged forward again. Other camps now opened ragged supporting fire. Most transmigrators were unfamiliar with shooting—many forgot to adjust sights before firing; others held down triggers, blazing away, quickly emptying their magazines.
