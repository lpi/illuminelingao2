# Chapter 1550 - Staying at the Inn

Zhuo Yifan returned to the courtyard and closed the door.

He smiled and cupped his hands to the group still in the courtyard. "Everyone, you've suffered on the road." He bowed deeply.

Since Guangzhou, these dozen people had kept straight faces, feigning the style of a wealthy household. For Zhuo Yifan playing "master," it was fine, but most were "servants"—several were famous figures in the martial arts world. Being ordered around all the way was bad enough; actually serving people was truly hard.

"We came deep into the dragon's pool for a life-or-death trade. What's a little fatigue and hardship?" The "steward" serving in the yard shook his head. "We only seek to strike true this time, not failing the trust of the lords and elders!"

"Above, we share the court's worries; below, we solve the people's distress," said another man dressed as a guard. "We can even sacrifice our lives; this bit of toil is nothing. Young Hero Zhuo, no need to be polite."

Among the "servants" in the yard, these two had the highest seniority and status. With their statement, others could only agree.

Zhuo Yifan bowed to the group again, then said to the "steward," "I'll trouble Uncle Wan with the room arrangements."

The "steward" was Wan Lifeng, known as "Chasing Wind Sword." He had been an escort in his early years, familiar with the travel styles of wealthy families. This was resuming his old trade. He nodded, "Rest assured, leave it to me."

Zhuo Yifan walked to the veranda. Several men and women stood there. One glance told him: only Hengshan Sect disciples remained in the main room.

The Hengshan Sect was entirely female, with somewhat "maverick" ways. Zhuo Yifan had seen plenty on the journey.

Zhuo Yifan stood at the door without entering—it was full of women; he had to avoid impropriety. Through the fine bamboo curtain, he said:

"Abbess, the clerk has left."

"Young Hero Zhuo? Please come in and talk."

"Yes."

Zhuo Yifan lifted the bamboo curtain and entered.

The "Old Madam" sat squarely in the center, female disciples attending on both sides. Though the room was cool, beads of sweat kept falling from the old woman's face and forehead. As the "Old Madam" wiped them with a towel, her bearing wasn't as "dignified" as before.

Posing as the "Old Madam" was none other than Abbess Miejing of the Hengshan Sect. The maids beside her were mostly young disciples of her sect.

Though living in luxury on the road, this Abbess had it hard: to hide her identity as a nun, she wore a heavy wig all the way, except when sleeping. After passing Guangzhou, the weather got hotter daily. Wearing a heavy, stifling wig wasn't pleasant.

"Young Hero Zhuo, please sit."

"Yes, thank you, Abbess." Zhuo Yifan was very respectful—the tempers of the Hengshan elders were somewhat eccentric.

"Is everything settled outside?"

"Luggage is delivered; everyone's quarters are arranged." Zhuo Yifan reported, "Abbess and your sect's disciples will stay in this main house. I'll have the luggage brought in shortly. I'll also tell the clerks you are fasting and order top-grade vegetarian food for dinner."

Miejing was expressionless. Hearing his arrangements, she only nodded. "You have taken trouble."

"Not at all. Abbess is an elder; this is my duty. I will go out tonight to contact Seventh Master and others. I will report to Abbess tomorrow when I have news."

Miejing nodded. "Go do it. I hear the Cropped-Hairs' lackeys are very formidable, like the Eastern Depot, and include many martial arts scum. Be careful in everything."

"Yes, I know. Please rest assured, Abbess."

Miejing nodded slightly and spoke no more.

Zhuo Yifan returned to the courtyard. Wan Lifeng had finishing arranging quarters: besides Hengshan disciples in the small courtyard, other women stayed there too. Men all moved to the large courtyard.

As for luggage, there wasn't much besides personal clothes and bedding. Only swords and weapons, hidden in boxes.

The large/small official chests filling a carriage mostly held bricks and rubble—purely for show. Though fake, Wan Lifeng dared not pile them outside randomly lest clerks get suspicious, so he tirelessly stacked them all in the side rooms.

After settling down, Abbess Miejing sent two disciples to deliver the fruits and the large jar of plum syrup sent by the clerk to the large courtyard for everyone to cool off.

The group, sweaty from moving boxes, ignored dignity upon seeing refreshments. They occupied spots in the shade or under eaves, sitting on the ground to eat and drink.

Zhuo Yifan was the leader; though junior in generation, his rank wasn't low. He yielded the stone table and chairs under the grape trellis to the team's key figures: Wan Lifeng, Sha Guangtian, and Meng Bofei.

These three were heavyweights in the martial arts world. Zhuo Yifan knew that relying solely on his master Daoist Baishi's prestige or the righteousness of "sharing the court's worries" wasn't enough to make them wade into this muddy water.

Zhuo Yifan only knew the mastermind was "Old Shi." Who this Old Shi was, he had no idea. But someone who could mobilize so many martial heroes must have immense power in both the court and the wild.

"What do we do next?"

"Wait for the opportunity." Zhuo Yifan said, "This is the heart of the Cropped-Hairs. Don't act rashly. Wait till I contact Mr. Sima, then we discuss. Uncle Wan—continue your role as steward. Though we close the door and are our own world, we must keep up the necessary rules and show no flaws. If a clerk sees and reports us, the big plan is ruined! Naturally, some colleagues will have to suffer a bit..."

"Yes, I know that." Wan Lifeng nodded. "Everyone has walked the *jianghu* for years; they understand."

"Do the style right. But don't overdo it. We are an old noble family. Don't act like nouveau riche."

The men laughed. Zhuo Yifan said to Sha and Meng, "Uncles, continue as guards. Watch the gates tight with everyone. Guard the door by day, post sentries by night. Especially Abbess's place—guard against strangers intruding. Her place is prone to slips."

The two smiled knowingly. Within the walls, the Abbess didn't need to suffer under the wig, but if seen, it would be news instantly.

"Unless necessary, don't leave the inn. Don't even leave the courtyard lightly. As for gathering news and scouting paths, wait till I meet Sima—they've been here half a month already."

The three nodded. Suddenly the doorbell rang loudly. Everyone startled and stood up with a swoosh. Zhuo Yifan waved his hand, signaling Wan Lifeng to answer.

People in the yard quickly cleared away fruits and teacups and hid in rooms. Sha and Meng stood by the veranda with hands at their sides.

The gate opened to reveal Li Xiaoliu holding a thick stack of papers, smiling apologetically. He came to notify about tomorrow's residency registration.

"...These are household forms. Since the Young Master and Old Madam will stay long in Lingao, by rules here you must register for temporary residency. It's the government's rule; please forgive us." Li Xiaoliu bowed and added, "Tomorrow residency police from East Gate Market Police Station will come to verify registration. Please stay in the inn and don't go out. To avoid missing official business and causing inconvenience."

Zhuo Yifan thought *These Cropped-Hairs talk big. A mere public servant has such pomp, casually daring to tell noble guests like us to 'wait for verification.' Who knows how they oppress the people usually.* He disapproved.

Indeed, Wan Lifeng frowned. "Filling out forms is fine; do as the locals do. But a petty public servant making our Young Master and Old Madam 'wait'—that's too..."

The clerk quickly said, "Steward! Can't say that. By the Chiefs' rules, one must go to the station to register. Our Young Owner exhausted great effort to get them to come here for verification; it's a special exception. You saw that family earlier—don't know how that will end."

"What's that female officer's background? To be so fierce?"

"Her? That's Lian Nishang, order police from East Gate Market Station. Most shrewish of all." The clerk grinned. "She's a nice person, just don't get any 'unresponsive' ideas about her."

"So they really want their female relatives to show their faces on the street and queue?" Wan Lifeng wanted to pump him for information. "It's just spending a few coins."

"Hard to say!" The clerk shook his head. "Bribery absolutely won't work. depends if my Owner can intercede with the station. In my humble view, unlikely!"

"Lingao's laws are so strict?"

"Yes, so I remind you: this isn't the Ming. Never violate Australian rules."

"Thank you, brother." Wan Lifeng fished a circulation voucher from his pocket and stuffed it to him. "Have some tea on me."

"Thank you for the reward, Steward." Li Xiaoliu smiled and bowed again, asking about dinner arrangements and if they needed carriages or rickshaws for sightseeing in East Gate Market.

"Arrange dinner according to first-class standards in the guest book. Our Old Madam eats vegetarian; prepare vegetarian food. No carriages needed for now. Tired from travel; we rest early today. Prepare more hot water tonight."

"Yes, understood." Li Xiaoliu smiled. "For hot water, the inn has hot water supply after dark. Just turn the tap."
