# Chapter 319 - The Pharmaceutical Factory

Strictly speaking, except for a small amount of local herbal preparations compounded by Liu San using local materials, most of the medicines consumed by Bairen General Hospital still came from stockpiled reserves, including physiological saline for intravenous infusion.

The medicine reserves were dwindling with use; no matter how much they economized, there would be a time when they ran out. If basic medicines could not be fully supplied, the Health Department would never be able to launch medical services on a large scale—with too few patients, both doctors and nurses had pitifully few opportunities to practice. All of this depended on the next step: the pharmaceutical factory going into production.

Shi Niaoren said: "As for long-term training, we have to start with basic facts, such as physiological phenomena, anatomy, botany, zoology, and Western pharmacology, to work out a set of theories. The goal is to establish a primary biology and medical system that is non-TCM. Besides short-term crash courses, we must synchronously conduct formal education. The next step will be to recruit medical and pharmaceutical students from those who have completed literacy training in schools for relatively formal education—these people may take ten years to teach, but they will be our future successors. As long as we recruit students, we need a set of basic theories; otherwise, how will they know what they are doing? Everyone should seize the time recently to draft a preliminary teaching plan."

Hippo said: "Therefore, priority goes to supporting the establishment of the education department and system. But it seems our education system is just preparing to be established. Also, isn't the cultural level of literacy students too low? To study medicine, one needs to be at least a high school graduate domestically. In the US, one must finish three years of science college first."

"Can't we recruit some interns from among the transmigrators?" Liu San asked.

"Good idea!" Shi Niaoren suddenly felt like he had discovered a new continent. Transmigrators were at least at high school level; learning medicine shouldn't be a big problem.

"Studying medicine is dry and boring; would these people have the interest?" Lan Yangyang expressed skepticism, recalling the miserable state of reciting books upon books in medical school.

"We can start looking among the girls first. Most of them are not in key positions, and women are emotionally richer; maybe they will be interested in things like healing the wounded and rescuing the dying."

Ai Beibei said: "This is possible. Last time, a girl did ask me how to become a nurse."

Hippo hurriedly said: "Being a nurse is too wasteful; let her become a doctor."

"By the way, how about that Hu Yicheng? He's being wasted in the Ministry of Agriculture's biological laboratory—a molecular biology major, tsk tsk, might as well ask for him to make medicine for us."

"Good. Make a list first to see how many people are suitable, and we'll focus on persuading them. Then place an ad in the *Lingao Times* to openly recruit interested people." Shi Niaoren tapped his notebook with his pen. "By the way, the recruitment poster should be accompanied by sexy photos of female nurses. Go check the general catalog of the AV library in the Great Library to see if there are such films; we can study them internally first..."

Ai Beibei laughed: "I won't participate in this study session; Dean, I'm asking for leave."

"Good, good," Shi Niaoren coughed, feeling he had misspoken and somewhat damaged his dignity. "Continue, continue—"

Ai Beibei said: "The educational background of the natives is indeed a bit low. I suggest starting with basic anatomy. Didn't the beginning of modern medicine originate from the interest in human structure during the Renaissance? Moreover, anatomy is visual education; students see what is there, enhancing persuasiveness. Once basic cognition of human structure is established, it will be easy to understand pathology and other subjects."

Hippo nodded: "This still belongs to crash-course education. They can be 'retrained' later anyway! Besides, in our lifetime, we will be in time to see the first batch of indigenous high school graduates. Another point is to break the superstitious thoughts of the ancients and their rejection of the modern Western medical system. Popularizing this is actually not difficult; we can refer to the methods adopted by missionaries in China in the past, extensively carrying out activities like civilian clinics and simple outpatient services. Delivering medicine and treatment to the common people. As long as the common people see the results, promoting modern medical concepts will be easy."

"Speaking of this issue, it involves the problem of medicines, consumables, and equipment again." Shi Niaoren sighed.

"Including surgery, it is also very difficult for us to carry out now," Hippo said. "No qualified anesthesiologists. I can probably guest-star, but this is not a long-term plan. Also, anesthetics reduce with use; we have to find substitutes."

Medicines and various medical consumables relied on the achievements of the chemical industry department, and required too much specialized equipment and special materials, including rubber, corrosion-resistant products, various catalysts, and reagents. Many catalysts were strict trade secrets of manufacturers.

"We can start experimenting with antibiotics," Zhao Yanmei said. "I'll try cultivating Kasugamycin, Oxytetracycline, and Aureomycin—the simple preparation of these antibiotics is relatively easy. After preparation, we'll use them on animals in the Ministry of Agriculture first. If the toxicity is safe, we'll do human trials clinically."

"Running a pharmaceutical factory requires many chemicals. I doubt when the chemical department can start large-scale production apart from refining coal tar. Some simple drugs or important drugs should still be accumulated slowly in the laboratory. APC can still be made using relatively rudimentary methods. During this period, being able to treat common diseases and war wounds, and check for common pathogens is enough. Plus making some plans and rules, etc. Other things are impossible for now." Shi Niaoren was quite pessimistic about this issue.

Liu San waited until they had discussed almost everything before speaking: "There is also the development and utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine." He took a breath. "I know many people have opinions about TCM. However, TCM still has many proven formulas that are effective. The preparation of Chinese medicine is also relatively convenient; the Health Department should pay attention."

"I agree with this very much." Shi Niaoren said, "I've wanted to talk to you about the pharmaceutical factory issue for a long time. Proprietary Chinese medicines are also a key focus of pharmaceutical production."

"Yes, we should try to duplicate some useful proprietary medicines. Like Zhuge *Xingjun San* and the like. It's a pity the formula for such a good thing as Yunnan Baiyao is secret." Liu San felt very regretful.

"Did the Ming Dynasty have Yunnan Baiyao?"

"No, it only existed from 1902." Liu San shook his head. "Most of the effective proprietary Chinese medicines we know completed their final compatibility and processing in the Qing Dynasty. Maybe we can buy Pien Tze Huang in Fujian."

"That's not bad." Hippo said. "It's a holy medicine for inflammation and antibacterial purposes in TCM."

"The effect is indeed good. People in TCM say it was a secret prescription of the Ming court that later spread to Fujian. It should exist now. When sending people to Fujian for procurement, we can ask around. If we know where it's made, we might as well kidnap the people back."

"We don't necessarily have to stare only at the proprietary Chinese medicines we know," Liu San said. "The Ming Dynasty should also have good proprietary Chinese medicines, just that we don't know them. It's best to contact the External Affairs and Intelligence Departments and use their relationships to collect some proprietary Chinese medicines. We can test them clinically to know if the effect is good or bad, and maybe find ways to improve them."

"Mm, mm." Shi Niaoren nodded in agreement.

"Also," seeing the Dean supported his words, Liu San spoke more, "we must ensure the supply of our Chinese medicinal materials. Manufacturing proprietary Chinese medicines cannot be done without the supply of raw materials. Typically, only the county town in Lingao has a medicine shop, and I've been to see it: the variety is incomplete. I asked around: except for a small amount produced locally, most of the medicinal materials they sell are imported from Qiongshan and Leizhou. The scale of the medicine shops here is too small; they haven't been to several major medicine markets."

Ai Beibei asked: "Didn't you specially open a herb garden in the farm?"

"Far from enough," Liu San said. "There are two thousand common Chinese medicinal materials on the medicine market alone. Many medicinal materials also need to undergo special processing. In addition, precious drugs like musk, ox bezoar, and rhinoceros horn are hard to buy suitable ones unless you go to the medicine market."

"You want to go to the medicine market to buy herbs?"

"Right!" Liu San nodded. "Whether I go or we send someone, it's better to buy and stockpile some precious medicinal materials as soon as possible. Now it's 1629, probably still considered a relatively peaceful time in the late Ming. As the world gets more chaotic later, the medicine trade might be interrupted."

"Good, I'll coordinate this matter. Strive to come up with a plan as soon as possible."

At the meeting, the establishment of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Instrument Factory was formally announced. This factory was jointly run by the Agricultural Committee and the Ministry of Health. Therefore, the rank of the factory director was higher, with Shi Niaoren and Wu Nanhai concurrently serving as directors. The executive director was Zhao Yanmei from the Ministry of Health, while the Agricultural Committee appointed Huang Dashan as the executive deputy director. Both of them happened to be working on bacterial strains.

The pharmaceutical factory was located on the riverbank not far from the farm. There was plenty of wasteland here, and it could borrow the farm's comprehensive infrastructure. Moreover, most of the biological talents among the transmigrators were concentrated in the farm, allowing for convenient sharing.

The entire pharmaceutical factory was regarded as a key department of the Transmigration Group and enjoyed the highest priority in infrastructure construction. To ensure constant temperature in certain production laboratories in the factory area, Bairen City's first air conditioning system was installed in the pharmaceutical factory.

This was the geothermal energy air conditioning originally proposed by Li Xiaolü. By drilling holes to a depth of more than ten meters underground and utilizing the constant temperature characteristics of the underground, using water as a heat exchange medium circulating between the underground and the building, it could achieve warmth in winter and coolness in summer—taking heat from the ground in winter and releasing heat to the ground in summer.

The principle was simple, but the entire system was extremely luxurious. Not only did it require digging wells over ten meters deep, but it also required manufacturing high-efficiency heat exchangers—made of brass. Just this copper made the Planning Committee's heart ache for a long time.

But the pharmaceutical factory was one of the ten key projects during the "First Five-Year Plan," a project Ma Qianzhu said must be launched even if they had to "pawn their pants." Fortunately, this amount of copper didn't require Ma Qianzhu to pawn his pants; it only caused protests from the Power and Telecommunications Departments whose resources were squeezed.

This project was launched amidst intense preparations, and the Machinery Factory began manufacturing relevant pipelines and equipment according to the blueprints.
