# Chapter 1342 Lushun and Zhenjiang

"I'll squeeze out some more from this batch of immigrants for you."

"What's the use of just getting some porters? I want people who understand technology and management!"

"This..." Yang Yun looked troubled. Skilled workers and management were in short supply everywhere.

"Then I'll figure something out. That's it for now. I'll go back and make arrangements to solve it for you as soon as possible. You should also put in some effort. Didn't you want to be Li Ka-shing? You've only just started."

"Get lost!"

Zhang Xingpei waved his hand, too lazy to banter with him. He hoped no new tricks would pop up tonight. Damn it, every time he just got a bit interested with his secretary, the taste of being interrupted by his apprentice shouting outside was really uncomfortable!

Arriving at Ma'niao Station, a shift train had just arrived. Inside were many temporary workers coming for the night shift, looking quite energetic.

Yang Yun didn't know that Dai Dehou was also rushing to the construction site under Mrs. Dai's exhortation. Although he had diarrhea several times after returning home and was a bit listless, his enthusiasm for work remained undiminished: life in Lingao was always getting better day by day.

Although it was already March 1633 in the Gregorian calendar, bursts of chill still invaded. In the first half of the 17th century, the frost-free period in Liaodong was so short that upland rice crops could barely be grown. Winter began in October, and spring hadn't arrived in March.

Xue Ziliang stood on the deck of the *Haitian* at sea, wrapped his cotton coat tighter, and raised his telescope to observe the distance. The mission of the *Haitian* this time was to scout the sea conditions along the way from Shandong to Lushun and the Yalu River mouth, including the weather and the freezing conditions of the ports along the Bohai Sea.

Operation Engine had largely concluded, and the Shandong aspect had entered the "aftermath" stage. The speed of large-scale refugee export had slowed down—carrying out the aftermath locally also required considerable manpower. The Three Prefectures of Eastern Shandong were originally not poor, it was just that the Ming Dynasty's sea ban policy artificially stifled the local economy. Now, after the rebels' tossing and turning, the Three Prefectures of Eastern Shandong were swept clean as if by a great flood from top to bottom. Whether it was the government, the gentry, or the local clans, all suffered devastating blows. Although devastated, it became a new world with great potential. The Zhaoyuan area controlled by the Qimu Island Detachment had already formed the prototype of the future Shandong Base.

For the Forward Command of Operation Engine, their mission had not ended. Since the battle lines deployed in the Ming Dynasty, Japan, and Korea were already very long, and the dispatched detachments that needed coordination were also widely distributed, a command headquarters capable of overseeing the overall situation and making timely responses and decisions was indeed needed. Therefore, the original Operation Engine Forward Command was reorganized into the Northeast Asia Expeditionary Army Command, stationed in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. It was fully responsible for coordinating and commanding all dispatch detachments and working groups in the Northeast Asia region north of Taiwan.

The first task of the newly established Northeast Asia Expeditionary Army Command was to open up trade and intelligence channels to Liaodong and Korea.

Although thanks to Operation Engine, a large amount of population had been obtained from Shandong, and the labor gap had been significantly narrowed, the urgency of obtaining population from Liaodong had greatly decreased. However, the hundreds of thousands of people in the entire Dongjiang Town were still important wealth attracting the Senate.

In addition, another more important purpose was to establish a strategic layout in the entire East Asia from the perspective of sea power.

Currently, the Senate's positioning for Shandong, especially the Dengzhou area, was a forward base for future operations against the Northeast Asian continent. As for Jeju Island, since the operations against Japan and Korea were still in the next step, its strategic positioning was only a transit springboard, additionally providing some auxiliary functions such as shipbuilding and animal husbandry.

As part of the Northeast Asian continent strategy, the Senate had long set its sights on Lushun and Zhenjiang Fort. Lushun Port, as a military port, was an excellent anchorage, and the terrain on land was easy to defend and hard to attack. Only a very small force was needed to control it.

The Senate had now de facto controlled Dengzhou. Controlling Lushun would be equivalent to controlling the entire Bohai Bay, achieving absolute convenience for trade and military maneuvering in the Bohai Rim region. Not only could they more effectively control eastern Shandong, but they could also further threaten Tianjin and Beijing. Their ability to interfere with the central hub of the Ming Dynasty would have a qualitative leap.

However, as a trading post, Lushun was far from Fuzhou directly controlled by the Manchus, and the roads were bad. The Manchus lacked ships, so its value as a commercial port was limited. The most ideal commercial port was still Zhenjiang Fort across the river from Korea.

At Zhenjiang Fort, they could not only trade directly with the Later Jin, but also threaten the Yi Dynasty regime of Korea. When necessary, this fortress could also be used to cut off the trade connection between the Yi Dynasty and the Manchus at any time—this would be a heavy blow to the Manchus who were extremely short of supplies.

Controlling Lushun and Zhenjiang Fort would allow the gradual establishment of intelligence connections with the Manchus. Currently, the Senate was basically in the dark regarding the situation on the Manchu side. Apart from digging through old papers in the Great Library, the intelligence obtained was all learned through merchants going to Liaodong. Especially from Li Luoyou's channel, they could roughly grasp intelligence with a lag of about half a year—this was unsatisfactory for the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, which was very sensitive to timeliness.

Another aspect was the Dongjiang Army. Currently, the Dongjiang Army was isolated overseas, and its logistical supplies relied entirely on sea transport from Denglai. After the Senate substantially controlled Dengzhou following the suppression of the rebellion, it was equivalent to mastering the supply route to Dongjiang, making the actual control of the Dongjiang armed forces possible in the future.

The current situation of Dongjiang Town was very poor. Although Kong Youde's troops did not defect to the Manchus as in history, the declining trend of Dongjiang was irreversible. When Mao Wenlong was alive, Dongjiang did not pose too big a threat to the Manchus. After Mao Wenlong died, Dongjiang fought amongst themselves, killing each other happily. Their internal vitality had long been greatly damaged, and they were even less of a threat to the Manchus.

According to historical data from the Great Library, the Manchus did not need to spend much effort to pull out this nail, and didn't even need many troops—not to mention the desperate situation of the Dongjiang Army like beggars, even in terms of numbers, Lushun only had a few hundred soldiers plus a few hundred households of military settlers.

The obstacle restricting the Manchus from pulling the nail, rather than the Dongjiang soldiers and civilians, was the logistical pressure of a distant expedition on the uninhabited Liaodong Peninsula. Between Fuzhou occupied by the Later Jin and Lushun, there were no forts or settlements. The army had nowhere to levy grain, and the road conditions were extremely poor. Therefore, the ideal mode of maneuver was to use naval forces—and the naval forces were a shortcoming for the Later Jin. The fact that Dongjiang was able to persist in the rear flank of the Later Jin for so many years had a lot to do with their use of the sea as a barrier and ships for maneuver.

Even if the Manchus took Lushun by land regardless of cost, without naval forces as maritime support, the Dongjiang troops scattered on the islands of the Liaodong Sea could organize sneak attacks at any time because they possessed ships, making defense very difficult.

In history, after the Three Shun Princes surrendered, availing of the mobility of the naval forces brought by the surrendered troops, the Manchus immediately took Lushun in 1633 and eliminated Dongjiang Town. Now, due to the Senate's intervention, the Three Shun Princes had been wiped out, and the Manchus had no usable naval forces, so the attack on Lushun had not started.

However, Huang Taiji would definitely pull out this nail by the couch, otherwise he wouldn't be able to enter the pass to plunder with bold assurance. For this primitive tribal regime built on the basis of robbery, not being able to rob meant starving to death on the bitter cold land of Liaodong.

The intelligence department predicted that although the Denglai rebels failed to surrender to the Manchus, after the rebels were eliminated, the various units of the Dongjiang Army, which had actually been significantly involved in the rebellion, would inevitably be in a state of panic. It was very likely that large-scale defections would occur in the near future, and Huang Taiji would definitely use such an opportunity to resolve Dongjiang Town.

The Senate was unwilling to let these hundreds of thousands of people go to the Manchus for nothing. Although Dongjiang Town didn't have many highlights in the battles against the Manchus, the military household soldiers who persevered on these barren and bitter cold islands were all people who had undergone the severest tempering. Whether acting as laborers or soldiers, they were excellent raw materials.

Therefore, the main purpose of this reconnaissance was to understand the sea conditions of several important ports and landing points on the north shore of the Bohai Sea, including freezing conditions. In addition to conducting reconnaissance on Lushun and Zhenjiang Fort located at the mouth of the Yalu River, the *Haitian* also had to conduct a comprehensive survey of the garrison, settlers, military strength, and people's livelihood on the various islands of Dongjiang in the Liaodong Sea, serving as the data basis for evaluating how to annex Dongjiang in the future.

"It can still freeze in March, I suppose this counts as rare..." Xue Ziliang put down the telescope. A gust of cold wind blew, piercing through his cotton cold-proof suit and making him shiver. It was already approaching noon, but the thermometer on his watch showed that the deck temperature at this time was as low as below zero, and the sails and cables on the ship had frozen.

Mao Shisan was a child of an ordinary military household in Dongjiang Town. His home was in Zhenjiang Fort. He was really too hungry, so availing of the slightly warmer sun in the afternoon, he secretly ran to the seaside, wanting to see if he could dig out a few seashells under the sand covered by ice shards. At worst, digging a few crabs and snails to fill his stomach would be good too. Since entering winter, he hadn't eaten decent grain for more than two months. Although this place was close to the Yalu River and he could catch some small fish and shrimp from time to time, various resources were also very tight. Especially going to the Yalu River to fish would occasionally lead to conflicts with Koreans. Originally, the Dongjiang Army was not welcomed by the Korean side. The wild vegetables around his home had basically been picked clean. Fortunately, there were patches of forest not far inland from here, so burning a fire for warmth was not a problem at least. Otherwise, the situation in Dongjiang wouldn't be much better than the refugees going to Qimu Island.

A few days ago, he heard people say that the former Vice Commander Li raised troops in rebellion in Dengzhou with old subordinates of Dongjiang, asking the Dongjiang Army to cross the sea to join him, and saying that as long as they went, there would be enough food and silver to take. Many young men in the military households were tempted, and quite a few got on boats to the islands, waiting for an opportunity to go to Shandong. The local officers didn't care either—nowadays, Dongjiang was in a state of 'father dying and mother remarrying', each person fending for themselves. Heaven knows when the imperial court's provisions and pay would arrive, and even if they arrived, it was hard to say whether they would fall into their own hands. If some people ran away, at least there woud be fewer mouths to feed.
