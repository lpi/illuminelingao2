# Chapter 796 – The Australian Lifestyle

Such people naturally attached great importance to socializing with figures from officaldom. Although a Trial Centurion of the Embroidered Uniform Guard was a low-ranking official, he was a locally influential figure. Adhering to the principle of "worshipping at every temple," Huang Shunlong had always been quite ingratiating toward such characters. When the Assistant Magistrate spoke to him, he immediately agreed wholeheartedly.

The interpreter called for a two-bearer sedan chair from outside, had Li Yongxun sit in it, and led the way to Huang Shunlong's house.

Huang Shunlong lived in the Chinese residential area of Macau. The sedan chair was carried directly to the entrance of Huang Shunlong's storefront. Lin Ming looked doubtfully at the dimly lit shop front, where two robust Kunlun slaves stood guard at the door holding short clubs.

On the way, the interpreter had boasted about Master Huang's luxurious lifestyle. Lin Ming hadn't thought much of it: since Huang Shunlong was in Macau, foreign goods were naturally accessible to him as a local advantage. However, the variety of foreign goods was limited to those few things—even the "Australian goods" that had risen in popularity in recent years, he had seen many of in Foshan.

"Master Lin, please come inside," the interpreter whispered.

Led by a short, dark-skinned Kunlun slave, the group passed through the shop front and a long, semi-dim corridor. Li Yongxun felt a little afraid and leaned tightly against Lin Ming, a scent like orchid and musk wafting faintly from her. Lin Ming, who was originally supporting her arm, took the opportunity to put his arm around his sister-in-law's waist. Beneath his hand, her waist was soft; he kneaded gently with his fingers, and his sister-in-law only made a few "mm-mm" sounds. He was instantly delighted, wishing this corridor would never end.

The corridor exit opened into a very neatly manicured fountain garden. It wasn't large, with a small fountain in the middle dripping water droplets. The ground around the fountain was paved with mosaics inlaid with various patterns. Surrounded by lush flowers and trees, there was an exquisite little pavilion.

High walls and buildings surrounded the garden, isolating everything from the outside world, making it very quiet.

Huang Shunlong welcomed them in the pavilion. He was dressed brightly and had a dignified bearing. With his professional sensitivity, Lin Ming saw at a glance that there were at least a dozen violations of sumptuary regulations in his attire from head to toe. Even in Guangzhou, where court dress regulations were treated as waste paper, it wasn't this exaggerated. Macau was indeed a land of barbarians.

Huang Shunlong was very warm, inviting them to "freshen up" first and stating he would invite a doctor immediately.

Servants came to attend to their washing and changing. Lin Ming had his sister-in-law dress as a man only to avoid unnecessary trouble, not to hide her gender. Now in someone's private residence, there was naturally no need to continue the disguise. The clothes brought by the maids were all brand new, with exquisite material and tailoring, which satisfied Lin Ming greatly. The invited doctor examined Li Yongxun's foot and concluded there was no major problem; applying a medicinal patch and resting for a few days would suffice.

The welcome banquet was set in the garden pavilion. High walls blocked the cold wind, and the pavilion was surrounded by Persian velvet carpets of various colors woven with different patterns. Two braziers on the ground burned high-quality hardwood charcoal mixed with exotic spices, filling the pavilion with rich fragrance and a spring-like warmth.

The tables and chairs were all woven from rattan, but in styles Lin Ming had never seen—dainty and beautiful. As it was winter, the seats and backs were padded with thick cushions made of Nanjing velvet felt, very comfortable. Li Yongxun looked around curiously, examining the rattan round table from top to bottom.

Seeing no high-stacked display dishes or sugar sculptures on the table, Lin Ming knew this was a family feast. If it were a formal welcome banquet with "three cuts and five offerings," he really couldn't handle it. Wealthy merchants' family feasts were known for their exquisiteness. Seeing the scene Huang laid out, this meal would likely have many extraordinary aspects, and he couldn't help but look forward to it.

Sure enough, the dishes served were different from Cantonese cuisine. The flavor was quite peculiar, rich and fragrant, with a somewhat cloying sweetness. Both Li Yongxun and Lin Ming were trying such flavors for the first time. According to Huang Shunlong, this was Folangji cuisine, cooked personally by his wife.

"This crab is sea crab, meat extracted, seasoned with cheese..." Huang Shunlong spoke with assurance.

The wine served was Guangzhou's most fashionable "Scholar Unrivaled." Lin Ming used to buy this wine frequently for northern colleagues; anyone coming from the north to Guangdong on business would buy a few boxes to take back as gifts. Sometimes they even sent letters asking him to buy it for them. Lin Ming often had to send people to Guangzhou to buy this wine. Sometimes for important figures or urgent needs, he had to pay out of his own pocket—Gao Ju wasn't a small fry from whom he could demand gifts—costing him quite a bit. Of course, the taste of "Scholar Unrivaled" was pure and crisp, truly incomparable to ordinary local spirits. ever since Wang Zunde's "campaign against the bald ones," the "Scholar Unrivaled" supply was cut off, and its price skyrocketed. Lin Ming rarely got to drink it himself now.

"What is this stuff? Why is it bubbling?" Li Yongxun looked in surprise at the orange water in the glass cup, releasing strings of fine bubbles from the bottom.

"This is Australian water, most cooling and thirst-quenching."

Li Yongxun took a sip, her expression complex: "It tingles, and it's very sweet. Tastes like tangerine."

"Precisely, this is tangerine-flavored Australian water," Huang Shunlong laughed, clapping his hands. "This item is extremely rare locally. If it loses it gas, it's not tasty."

He explained that Australian water most feared losing its gas—without it, it was just fruity sugar water. So packaging used special thick glass bottles, corked and tied tight with iron wire. Every 12 bottles came in a partitioned wooden crate. Transported over a long distance, the price was expensive. But it was indeed a wonderful item for relieving heat and boredom, very popular among the Folangji.

Next, a servant brought a large porcelain pot. Uncovered, the pot was full of oily, red liquid. Lin Ming looked closely: floating in it were snow-white fish slices and yellow eel backs, with soybean sprouts at the bottom. Floating in the oil soup were some bright red, small eggplant-like fruits. A rich, strange fragrance wafted in the air.

"This dish is an overseas flavor, quite unique," Huang Shunlong laughed. "Only the taste is extremely punchy."

"It seems to use a lot of Sichuan pepper." Sichuan pepper was a common spice in Ming cuisine.

"Correct," Huang Shunlong nodded. "Besides Sichuan pepper, there is also foreign pepper from the West."

Everyone raised their chopsticks. Lin Ming felt an extreme spiciness in his mouth. This sensation was completely different from the numbing spice of Sichuan pepper. The snow-white fish meat, seasoned this way, had a unique deliciousness. His appetite surged, and he ate several chopstick-fulls in a row. Li Yongxun, seeing the bright red lantern-like fruits floating in the oil soup, struck fast as the wind. Before Huang Shunlong could stop her, she stuffed a pickled chili pepper directly into her mouth.

"You can't eat—" Before his voice fell, Li Yongxun let out a scream. Her mouth felt like it was on fire, her throat numb and choking. Tears and snot ran down her face as she sneezed a dozen times. The maids hurriedly passed water and towels. She drank four or five cups of soda before finally stopping.

"What is this!" Li Yongxun was gasping for breath, almost unable to speak from the spiciness.

"This is a pickled chili pepper," Huang Shunlong said. "It's used for seasoning, not for eating."

Lin Ming was very interested. Through casual conversation, he learned this was "Heavenly Kitchen" pickled pepper from Lingao. A common item in "Australian cuisine." Huang Shunlong spoke enthusiastically about "Australian cuisine." After eating it once at the Violet House in Guangzhou, he never forgot it, specially sending a cook to Lingao to learn the craft, bringing back recipes for a dozen dishes and four or five dim sum snacks.

"Australian cuisine?" Lin Ming wasn't unfamiliar with Australians or Lingao goods. The head manager of "Yang Run Kai Tang," Yang Shiyi, was very familiar with him. One of his cousins opened a medicine shop in Lingao and asked him to sell several patent medicines in Guangdong in large quantities; business was incredibly good. When drinking and chatting with Lin Ming in their spare time, Yang would often talk about the situation with his cousin. Though hearsay, it gave Lin Ming quite a bit of knowledge about Lingao.

"Exactly. Although Australians are overseas barbarians, their various enjoyments are no less than our Great Ming's," Huang Shunlong said, his conversational interest high seeing the hospitality suited the esteemed guest's taste. "Take this Australian cuisine, many dishes are things I'd never even thought of!"

Lin Ming responded perfunctorily while eating and drinking, but his ears listened carefully to every word Huang Shunlong said. He felt this Manager Huang seemed to have a rather close relationship with the Australians in Lingao. So he began probing indirectly—he surmised that since the Australians had defeated the government troops and reached the gates of Guangzhou, they would inevitably be enemies of the Great Ming, and future wars were likely. Lin Ming was very mindful of Australian affairs because of this. If one day the Court launched a great army to suppress the bald ones, and he was an "Australia expert," he could hope for military merit and promotion.

Huang Shunlong intended to curry favor, and Lin Ming did his best to obliging. Their conversation became increasingly congenial. Huang Shunlong was in high spirits, personally toasting Lin Ming. As the wine took effect, their conversation became more relaxed.

"Manager Huang must have many dealings with the Australians."

"There were some business dealings in the past," Huang Shunlong knew who the other was, so he spoke cautiously. "Not much recently. They have many novel goods—all best-sellers—unfortunately, I'm not in Guangzhou, so the benefit of selling Australian goods has been taken by Official Gao."

"Does Manager Huang know someone named Guo Yi? I heard he's the Australian head in Guangzhou."

"Guo Yi? Of course I know him." Huang Shunlong nodded. "Who doesn't know the famous Proprietor Guo! He has no property here, but his people frequently come here, specifically to buy Folangji goods." He took a sip of Scholar Unrivaled. "Speaking of which, it's strange. Folangji people here usually buy more than they sell—but since the Australians came, they specifically want their things!"

Actually, Huang Shunlong's relationship with Guo Yi was far more than simple acquaintance. Although Huang Shunlong's importance in the entire Lingao economic system had greatly declined, his smuggling channels still allowed small-scale import and export of goods to Guangdong during the economic blockade against Lingao.
