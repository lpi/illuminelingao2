Chapter 27 Gao Qing's Troubles

While the Transmigrators were actively preparing, in the Ming Dynasty, Gao Qing, the servant given to the "Australians" by Master Gao, was having a headache.

Gao Qing was an honest and timid man. He was originally a tenant farmer of the Gao family. Because he couldn't pay the rent, he sold himself to the Gao residence as a servant.

He worked diligently in the Gao residence and never caused trouble. He thought he would live like this for the rest of his life.

Unexpectedly, Master Gao suddenly assigned his whole family to those "Australian masters".

"Australians?" Gao Qing had never heard of this place. He only saw that these new masters had short hair, strange clothes and strange speech, not like people of the Central Plains.

"Are they Japanese pirates? Or monsters?" Gao Qing beat a drum in his heart.

However, Master's order could not be defied. He could only take his wife Gao Xian and two children (daughter Gao Colgate - wait, Gao Colgate is definitely a transliteration spoof, likely 'Gao Lujie', and son Gao Di) to move into the new house bought by the Australians.

At first, Gao Qing was very afraid. He was afraid that these new masters would beat and scold them, or even eat them.

But after a few days, he found that these new masters were surprisingly easy to get along with.

They never beat or scolded servants, spoke politely, and ate together with servants (although the table was separate).

What surprised him most was that the new masters gave them very generous treatment.

"Monthly rice, one picul. Monthly money, one tael of silver. Meat every three days, new clothes every quarter..."

When Gao Qing got the first month's salary, his hands were trembling.

One tael of silver! In the Gao residence, he had to work for half a year to get it! And here, it was just a month's wages!

"Master, is this... is this real?" Gao Qing couldn't believe his eyes.

"Of course it's real." Xiao Zishan smiled, "As long as you work hard, there will be more in the future."

Gao Qing was moved to tears. He secretly swore in his heart that he would be loyal to the new masters.

However, good times didn't last long. Troubles came.

Steward Yan of the Gao residence found him.

"Gao Qing, how are you doing over there?" Steward Yan asked with a fake smile.

"Thanks to Steward's blessing, everything is fine." Gao Qing replied cautiously.

"Master misses you very much." Steward Yan changed the subject, "Master wants you to help keep an eye on those Australians. See what they do every day, who they meet, and what goods they transport..."

"This..." Gao Qing was in a dilemma.

On one side was the new master who treated him as kind as a mountain, on the other side was the old master with accumulated power. He couldn't afford to offend either.

"Don't worry." Steward Yan tempted, "Master won't let you work for nothing. As long as you report on time, there will be rewards every month. And, Master promised that if those Australians leave in the future, you can still return to the Gao residence."

Under Steward Yan's coercion and inducement, Gao Qing wavered.

He began to secretly observe the every move of the Transmigrators and report to Steward Yan periodically.

"They bought a lot of grain..."
"They transported many strange iron boxes..."
"They often gather in the room for meetings..."

Gao Qing did these things with fear and trepidation. Every time he took the silver from Steward Yan, he felt that the silver was hot to the hand.

He felt that he was a traitor, a person who betrayed his master seeking glory.

"Wife, I... I feel uncomfortable in my heart." At night, Gao Qing said to his wife Gao Xian.

Gao Xian was a shrewd woman. She had long seen through Steward Yan's tricks.

"You fool!" She poked Gao Qing's forehead, "Those Australians are doing big things. Can they not know your little tricks? If they find out, our whole family will be finished!"

"Then... what should I do?" Gao Qing panicked.

"From now on, you report less, or report some irrelevant things." Gao Xian instructed, "Don't offend Steward Yan, but don't sell out the new masters completely. Leave a way out for ourselves."

"I... I listen to you."

Gao Qing nodded, but the big stone in his heart was not put down.

He lived in contradiction and fear every day, fearing that one day the incident would be exposed and bring disaster to his family.

Until that day, Xiao Zishan found his wife...
