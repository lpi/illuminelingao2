# Chapter 695 - Pearl River Estuary Task Force

The Navy would be responsible for executing this operation. The specific operational area would cover the entire Guangdong maritime region, with the Pearl River Estuary as the focal point.

"The objective of this military operation is to create as much disturbance and chaos as possible in the Pearl River Delta region. Therefore, we must not only organize bombardments but also conduct small-scale landing operations to sabotage and strike targets on shore." Chen Haiyang explained the campaign determination. "Our strike targets are primarily government facilities; we will try to avoid hitting civilian targets. However, if we encounter resistance from local armed forces, we will conduct comprehensive annihilation operations against them."

In principle, vessels at sea would not be seized unless they were government naval warships, or if the other party engaged in provocative or aggressive behavior first.

"Because of this operation's unique nature, ships participating will be equipped with more Marines than usual and will carry additional Army artillery needed for landing operations."

"If we conduct this operation, warships will have to enter the Pearl River." Meng De stood up to ask. "We know nothing about the Pearl River's hydrological conditions in this timeline. We're unclear about the shoals and tidal conditions."

"No, we have a very clear grasp." Xu Ke said. "Do you think the ships of Gaoguang Shipping and our Navy's transport vessels haven't conducted hydrological surveys during their many trips to and from Guangzhou?"

"So we have enough Pearl River hydrological data for captains to use?" Meng De had spent quite some time in the hospital and sanatorium since the five-masted ship rescue incident.

Xu Ke stated: The External Intelligence Bureau's intelligence database contained much such information, which was currently being compiled by a concentrated team. Soon the Navy would receive unprecedentedly detailed data on the Pearl River Estuary's hydrology and navigation channels.

"Navigation conditions in the Pearl River waters are excellent. Even the Sacred Ship could travel from the estuary up to Guangzhou. The small and medium-sized sailing ships we mainly use won't have any problems. So water depth isn't a concern—plus, this is 400 years earlier than the 21st century, so sedimentation in the Pearl River is much lighter."

Chen Haiyang said: "The Pearl River channel is still quite complex. especially since landing battles will involve near-shore waters, so we'll arrange for some native captains familiar with the Pearl River channel to participate."

Although everyone had strong confidence in their technological superiority, experienced naval officers still had significant concerns about this Pearl River Estuary campaign. This wasn't just because of complex hydrological conditions in the estuary and river, hidden shoals, and unregulated channels; large and medium-sized seagoing vessels relying primarily on wind power would find both navigation and maneuvers like turning around difficult.

When the British Navy attacked Guangzhou during the Opium War, they mainly used paddle steamers as towing vessels to tow sailing warships and bombardment vessels for mobility.

"We temporarily don't have paddle steamers, but we have Daihatsu landing craft." Chen Haiyang said. "Daihatsu boats have good mobility and can barely manage towing duties. Additionally, they can transport Marines ashore and provide escort."

Wen Desi disagreed: "How did the British fleet get to Bai'etan during the Opium War? Their hydrological data wasn't necessarily more than ours, yet they sailed warships of several thousand tons to the gates of Guangzhou. Even without data, using small boats to sound depths and place channel buoys as we go is enough. At most, we'll sail a bit slower."

"To ensure this blockade and harassment operation, the Navy will establish a Pearl River Estuary Detachment." Li Di began reporting the fleet composition in the plan.

The detachment's warships would primarily be Special Service Vessels—that is, modified traditional Chinese-style two-masted and three-masted ships. Some Special Service Vessels would carry reduced ammunition to transport as many Marines and cannons as possible.

Sixteen Special Service Vessels and eight fast single-masted patrol boats would form the armed fleet, with another twenty Special Service Vessels incorporated to transport Marines and supplies. Considering the Pearl River Estuary was 500 nautical miles from Lingao, the *Big Whale* and several specialized supply ships were crucial.

In the operation's initial phase, the Navy would first establish a temporary fortress on Hong Kong Island as a logistical supply and rest base for the Pearl River Estuary Detachment.

Leaving aside Hong Kong Island's future commercial value, its location just outside the Pearl River Estuary, with excellent harbor and certain freshwater resources, made it an ideal base for the naval detachment. The transmigrator group was isolated in Hainan, their maritime power at the westernmost edge of the Guangdong-Guangxi waters, with little influence over the entire Guangdong coast. Once they occupied Hong Kong Island and established a permanent detachment and naval base, it would mean a powerful presence right outside the Pearl River Estuary. Every move would affect Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta region. This would not only control Guangdong's foreign trade but also protect their own shipping routes.

Of course, this move would likely be seen by Liu Xiang as a challenge to his maritime hegemony in Guangdong. However, the General Staff and Intelligence Bureau estimated: even so, Liu Xiang might not dare to immediately open full hostilities with the transmigrator group—Zheng Zhilong was still watching him. If he committed full force to attack the transmigrators, Zheng Zhilong would absolutely not miss this good opportunity to pincer him with the transmigrators.

Li Di expressed concern: "But the Pearl River Estuary is his territory after all. It's his base of operations; he won't back down easily!"

"If he wants war, we'll wipe him out completely," Chen Haiyang said. "We'll have a showdown with Liu Xiang sooner or later. It's inevitable."

That said, Liu Xiang's strength was formidable, and the Pearl River Estuary waters were where his fleet frequently operated. Compared to the scattered Ming military camps and outposts on shore, it was entirely possible Liu Xiang would use numerical superiority against the Detachment.

The Navy's plan was: if such a situation occurred, use Hong Kong base as a pivot point to firmly attract Liu Xiang's main force near the Pearl River Estuary, then launch the Navy's main force from Lingao to deliver a devastating blow. The plan even prepared for deploying the Sacred Ship for combat if necessary.

The Detachment sent to the Pearl River Estuary would be personally led by Chen Haiyang. There were plenty of naval transmigrators willing to be fleet commander, but most just barely knew how to sail. Having swallowed a bunch of naval knowledge whole, God only knew if they had digested it. So the Executive Committee and Navy, after repeated consideration, decided it was better for Chen Haiyang to lead the fleet personally. At least he was a real naval officer.

"I actually feel a bit incompetent," he said. To this day, his entire sailing record was serving as a ship captain. His concepts of commanding a sailing fleet in combat came almost entirely from books and Wen Desi.

Modern naval officers like Chen Haiyang didn't know much more about commanding Age of Sail warships than Wen Desi did—after all, both their knowledge came from naval history books.

"Coordinator Wen, do you want to accompany the fleet?"

"Of course, I'd be happy to." Wen Desi agreed readily.

"That's great. I felt the burden was too heavy. Never handled a wind-powered fleet."

"I haven't either. We're in the same boat anyway." Wen Desi stroked the beard on his chin. "Which ship do you plan to choose as flagship?"

"Ling-Special 11. It's a three-masted large Guangdong ship, nearly three hundred tons, the largest in the task force. It has many cabins and can accommodate the headquarters. Will you join me on this ship?"

"Alright." Wen Desi nodded. Though nearly three hundred tons, it was actually a very small ship. Even large European sailing ships like the *Götheborg*, displacing over a thousand tons, had very limited internal volume. Once packed with sailors and supplies for a voyage, the environment wouldn't be great. But it would only take a few days to reach Hong Kong Island. Then they could set up headquarters directly on the island.

Shi Shisi licked his fingers with satisfaction—a bad habit the naval officer training class had never managed to break. Of course, someone who went to sea young and drifted everywhere couldn't have perfect manners. His naval officer uniform front was stained with grease. A sumptuous lunch made him feel drowsy.

Shi Shisi no longer showed many traces of his pirate past. His body, though strong before, used to have poor posture, head always tilting to one side. Now drill training and systematic physical exercise had greatly improved his mental outlook and physical posture. He had become fit and proportionate, hair and beard trimmed clean.

He wore a dark blue naval officer uniform, the new summer style. Besides using a cotton-linen blend for breathability, the standing collar had been changed to a small open collar—Army and Navy officers all found wearing standing collars in summer stiflingly hot.

Shi Shisi was now a Navy Lieutenant—commanding a squadron of Special Service Vessels. He had learned how to command a squadron to deploy formation at sea: most crucially, the whole squadron forming a line ahead to fire; how to seize the windward position in naval battle; how to grasp the best firing range and timing.

He had never thought naval battles could be conducted this way. he knew a bit of the tricks before, but no one had ever summarized them so accurately and meticulously, explaining clearly in text. If he couldn't understand the text description, there were plenty of diagrams and model demonstrations to improve his understanding.

He learned semaphore, learned how to judge target distance and speed... finally he learned salute rules, learned how to eat and speak as a naval officer... Naval training and red tape had gradually made Shi Shisi unrecognizable to himself.

However, such days made him feel very happy—because Shi Shisi knew he was now a "high-status" person. As a pirate, no matter how many men and ships you had, you were still just a bandit. Didn't sound resounding enough.
