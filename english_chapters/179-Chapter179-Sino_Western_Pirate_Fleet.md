# Chapter 179: The Sino-Western Pirate Fleet

"What's strange about it?" Wu De was puzzled.

"Shipping people specifically to die—that's strange." A voice came from ahead.

Wu De was gnawing a crab when he noticed extra feet in front of him. Looking up, a plump white man stood there. Left hand held an empty lunch box, right hand a jumbo stainless steel spoon. Both eyes were fixed on the roasting crabs.

"Smells amazing!!!!!" Seeing Wu De look up, the fatty blurted out.

"What? Want some?" Though he didn't know the visitor, fellow transmigrators were brothers.

"Sure, sure!!" The fatty wasn't shy, plopping down and extending his lunch box.

Wu De served him half a crab. The fatty took the box without a word, burying himself in eating.

"You're here to join the fun?" Ma Qianzhu apparently knew the visitor. "Zhu Cailao really doesn't know what's good for him."

The fatty chuckled, licking his lips. "Director, you already said it's strange. Don't try to outwit me."

"But this time we really captured a lot of Zhu Cailao's stuff. That's what makes it strange."

"Old routine. Fang Yi and the little princess used Wu Sangui's weapons to infiltrate the palace."

"That's what I think too." Ma Qianzhu pulled out an interrogation transcript. "Most of these prisoners were temporarily recruited, not veteran pirates. If Zhu Cailao's really attacking after losing to us, he should know our strength. Sending these cannon-fodder newbies makes no sense."

"Pirates aren't regulars. They don't mark their weapons with insignia." The fatty observed.

"Someone's trying to stir up trouble." Wu De said.

"Correct." The fatty continued eating crab. "Who wants to provoke conflict between the transmigrators and Zhu Cailao? Liu Xiang and Zheng Yiguan both could. If Zhu Cailao and the transmigrators fight a major battle, they benefit."

"So who is it?" Ma Qianzhu seemed to trust this fatty greatly.

"How would I know?" The fatty shrugged. "If I had to guess, I'd say Liu Xiang."

"Why?"

"I'm guessing."

Ma Qianzhu nearly fainted. The fatty chuckled several times, swallowed an oyster, smacked his lips, then continued:

"Actually, doesn't matter which one. Here's my guess: the real attack is coming soon."

Ma Qianzhu jolted. The enemy wouldn't simply send 400 men to die just for a false message. There must be more to come. Recalling the radar-detected fleet, he reached for his phone.

Before he touched it, a crisp gunshot rang through the night sky.

Ma Qianzhu and Wu De leaped up, tensely watching the shot's direction.

"Hey, what's your name?" Wu De turned to ask. He was quite curious about this visitor.

"Siluo... Siluo Moningbai'er." The fatty mumbled with half a crab in his mouth.

"Siluo Moningbai'er? Never seen this person..." Wu De was confused.

Then realization struck. "Oh, so you're the famous... pleasure to meet..."

"Please, no pleasantries. Fame is a burden." The fatty sighed with fake sincerity. His sharp eyes had already snagged another oyster. Tongue curled around it—swallowed. Then he slowly rose, patted his belly, said "Thanks for the hospitality. You're busy, I won't disturb," and left.

"Then... goodbye." Wu De had no mood for politeness now. He hurried inside to grab his Type-56 semiautomatic.

The fatty tapped his lunch box, humming "Old Bear's lucky today, Old Wolf's buying chicken..." as he departed.

SHIT, Xue Ziliang couldn't help cursing in English. In the infrared binoculars' eerie white night, six ships were clearly visible. One was obviously not Chinese.

Hours earlier, Bei Wei had called, ordering his recon detachment to conduct a foot patrol along Bopu Harbor's beach. Intelligence suggested possible nighttime maritime infiltration.

Xue Ziliang took this seriously, especially direct orders from Bei Wei. He knew well—without Bei Wei's favor, he'd still be an "off-the-books" nobody. Having been in this group long enough, he deeply understood "regular" versus "temporary" treatment. Now that he was "regular," he had to work hard. Xue Ziliang now understood "background issues."

Long-Range Reconnaissance HQ—every department was inflating its rank now, like the Health Team recently renaming itself Health Department, so the recon unit wasn't immune—was at Bairren, but Bei Wei had stationed a four-man detachment each at Bopu, Damei Village, and Salt Field Village for daily patrols and training. He and Xue Ziliang rotated through for guidance.

Besides Xue Ziliang, this four-man squad had no military experience. Actually, Bei Wei thought veteran age was too old; unless they were recon specialists, they lacked flexibility. He preferred selecting volunteers from twenty-somethings. After months of training, though not quite recon-level, these young men far exceeded typical fresh boot-camp soldiers.

They carried three SKS rifles. Xue Ziliang had a Remington 870 shotgun—he found the SKS too long for recon work. As a former American, his greatest frustration was equipment shortage. Plenty of quantity, but almost all unfamiliar. Except for Glock pistols and Remington shotguns, the transmigrators' most common infantry weapon—SKS and Type-56 semi—were foreign to him. Even an AK-47 would be better; he'd used those.

Take night vision equipment. In his US Marine Corps Force Recon days, this was basic gear. Even his garage at home had better equipment. Now the whole squad had just one starlight scope and one Russian infrared binoculars—he disliked Russian gear. But this was already excellent allocation. Night vision equipment, though plentiful initially, couldn't be replaced or repaired. Planning Committee controlled it strictly.

Coastal searching on foot was exhausting but effective. Overcast sky, no moon or stars, horizon barely visible. Though radar provided approximate coordinates, every kilometer he stopped to scan the sea with binoculars.

After two hours of coastal trekking, the search team reached Longhao Bay's end. If coordinates were correct, the fleet should be nearby. Next binocular sweep—sure enough, ship silhouettes appeared across the strait.

Good at hiding, he noted, unconsciously chewing before realizing he had no gum. These six ships were concealed in reef shadows on a starless, moonless night. Without *Fengcheng's* radar, visual observation alone couldn't have spotted them, much less positioned them.

Ship speed was extremely slow. Xue Ziliang checked his watch and started calculating—under 2 knots. That foreign ship's sails clearly weren't fully deployed. Suspicious.

"Brother Xue, something wrong here?" A team member whispered. Xue Ziliang's straightforwardness and skill had earned the young men's respect.

"Be weirder if there wasn't." Xue Ziliang muttered. He radioed Bopu and began reporting:

Six unidentified vessels sighted. Based on hull types, preliminary assessment: five smaller ones are Chinese ships; one is a Western warship—three-masted, approximately 400-ton displacement. Chinese warships have no broadside gun ports. Bows and decks carry 4-6 cannons. Western warship has 12-16 gun positions on open deck.

"There's a dinghy!" Xue Ziliang's binoculars caught a small boat.

Eight people inside. The binoculars showed swords and matchlock muskets. One at the helm, four rowing, two at the bow setting up matchlock fork rests—pretty primitive. The last held something rolled up. The dinghy advanced cautiously, paddling only occasionally. He could now clearly see: the item-holding sailor carried a plumb line, constantly measuring nearshore water depth. This meant the enemy planned to bring ships very close, using cannon fire to support landings. Simple rowboat troop transport wouldn't need depth sounding.

From the dinghy's trajectory, the pirates obviously planned landing from Lingao Point side—not Bopu's main entrance, presumably less defended. As for that inconvenient beacon tower, the pirates clearly didn't take it seriously, unaware of the 12-pounder cannon atop it.

Gentle breeze on a silent night. Only waves lapping shore, making splashing sounds.

A ghostly sailing ship slowly approached—the Spanish galleon *Countess of Scarborough*. Behind it followed five smaller Chinese hard-sail vessels.

The moon emerged from clouds, pale light.

"Damn this moon!" Spanish Captain Aragonés grumbled from the poop deck. He'd been slowly cruising across the strait half the night, approaching the channel centerline only near midnight. Moonlight would reveal ship silhouettes. According to rumors, those strange Easterners had many strange muskets that fired extremely far. He didn't want to risk it.

"Are those Orientals all asleep?" Aragonés murmured. Through his spyglass, the harbor remained calm. Except for some lights, nothing unusual.

"Captain. Rear ship Captain Liu is signaling to ask whether to begin the attack."

"Understood." Aragonés smiled with a trace of contempt. These stupid Orientals could only fight on land. They didn't deserve to be called sailors. At sea, he was confident *Countess of Scarborough* alone could defeat all of Liu Xiang's warships. If not for Dutch pressure reducing Spanish influence along the Chinese coast, why would he cooperate with a second-rate pirate like Liu Xiang?

He watched the dinghy through his telescope. So far, no signals indicating insufficient depth. Soon he could confidently sail very close to shore, using concentrated cannon fire to support the landing pirates. Those legendary strange muskets, however powerful, couldn't match 16-cannon broadsides. *Countess of Scarborough* carried 32 guns—quite formidable even in European waters.
