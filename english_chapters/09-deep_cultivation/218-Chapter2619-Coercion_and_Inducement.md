# Chapter 2619: Coercion and Inducement

The gentry didn't expect Zhang Xiao to estimate Jiujiang's fish fry production in such a way, all startled. Guan Boyi said, "Parent Official has eyes like torches. Student admires."

"Then do you know how many fish fry the West Sea can produce annually?" Zhang Xiao asked again.

"Student doesn't know."

"Twelve billion." Zhang Xiao said. In fact, in the more than ten years after the founding of New China and before the development of artificial breeding technology, the annual catch of fish fry in the Guangdong section of the West River was about five billion, and the Guangxi section about seven billion. But under the backward production conditions of the late Ming, being able to catch three or four hundred million fish fry annually was already quite considerable.

Although the gentry didn't know on what basis Zhang Xiao concluded the West Sea could produce so many fish fry annually, judging from his accurate calculation of the annual catch of this township, the credibility of the number he said was extremely high.

Song Guowei said, "Although West Sea can produce many fish fry annually, catching fish fry relies entirely on 'Fishery Masters' watching the sky. It is truly hard to increase production further."

Zhang Xiao imitated the tone of ancients and said, "Generally for taking fish fry, from March to August, at sunset, watch lightning legs high in a certain direction, then know no rain in a certain direction, water in a certain river won't rise; lightning legs low in a certain direction, then know rain in a certain direction, water in a certain direction rises. If rising, then certain fish fry arrive. Those from Liu, Qing, Yue take three *xun* (ten-day period), two *xun*; those from Nanning take two *xun*, one and a half *xun*. The rest have different speeds. I also know from Wuzhou down to Jiujiang section, flood season starts early and ends late. The proportion of bighead and silver carp liked by Jiujiang villagers is higher than other tributaries. Silver carp accounts for about 5% to 10%, bighead carp 1% to 10%."

This Australian Magistrate was actually so clear about the fish fry catching of this township. The gentry momentarily didn't know what medicine Zhang Xiao sold in his gourd. Zhu Bolian, the patriarch of the Zhu clan, said, "Since Parent Official knows the method of loading and catching fish fry, you should know this township indeed relies on heaven to eat."

"Good 'relying on heaven to eat'," Zhang Xiao pointed to the tent roof with his fan and said, "Now the Great Song Senate is Heaven. Jiujiang villagers can load and catch fish fry; could it be that villagers of Zhaoqing and Fengchuan cannot?"

Hearing this, many people couldn't help shivering. Jiujiang Township's fish fry monopoly catching right, in the final analysis, relied completely on government policy, not some irreplaceable natural endowment. Zhang Xiao's words truly poked their vitals, short of writing the word "threat" on his face.

The scene in the marching tent cooled down instantly. Huang Xiyin knew both sides were testing each other, so he didn't interrupt. After a long silence, seeing the timing was right, Zhang Xiao said slowly, "Old Gentlemen, it's not that this County doesn't speak martial ethics to bully elderly people. Today there is a good business deal. Wonder if those present are willing to give face to this County."

Guan Boyi said, "Parent Official plans an outlet for us; naturally we must support with full strength."

Zhang Xiao said, "I prepare to propose to the Guangdong Region to find a treasure land to build a National Level Freshwater Fish Artificial Breeding Base."

"Artificial breeding?" The gentry present all widened their eyes in disbelief. From ancient times to present, fish were caught from rivers, lakes, and seas. Even fish fry were gifts from God. Never heard of any artificial breeding.

Zhang Xiao asked mysteriously, "Have you noticed that fish fry bought in some places last year were not produced in Jiujiang?"

"Uh, heard slightly."

"Correct. Those fish fry were exactly the test batch produced by my Senate when conducting technical tackling in Lingao," Zhang Xiao was somewhat proud. When doing technical tackling, fish pituitary hormone was needed to stimulate parent fish to ovulate. He handled the extraction and preservation technology of the pituitary gland. He continued, "Artificial breeding is the literal meaning. In the future, fish fry will all be produced from fish fry farms, no need to go to rivers to catch anymore. Within two years after the base is built, fish fry production will increase at least ten times on the basis of your existing catch, and a hundred times within ten years."

Foreign fish fry naturally made gentry feel faintly uneasy, but this new Magistrate really had a big tone, actually boasting to increase fish fry production ten times, a hundred times. What they didn't know was that after breaking through freshwater fish artificial breeding technology in the 1960s of the old timeline, by the 70s Jiujiang already reached a production of 70 billion tails, not to mention the 500 billion scale before the Senate transmigrated.

"It's just that now the North has constant natural disasters and smoke of gunpowder rises everywhere. How can so much increased fish fry be sold?" Someone asked worriedly.

"Saying this, you present don't have confidence in how long my Senate's red flag can be planted?" Zhang Xiao's words carried some contempt.

"Dare not!"

"Grass people absolutely have no such intention!"

"Then you don't need to worry about sales at all. Within ten years, my Senate will definitely sweep the world. Wherever the Fubo Army's steps go, the Senate's fish fry will be sold there. Wherever there are fish ponds, there must be artificial fish. Even Borneo separated by heavy oceans can be reached." In Zhang Xiao's planning, Jiujiang would become the fish fry breeding center of the whole country and even radiating the entire Southeast Asia, just like in the old timeline.

"Not only this," Zhang Xiao got up, fanned a few times, and said, "Senator Li traveling with me also plans to build a Sericulture Improvement and Promotion Base at the same time, fully exploring the resource endowment of the Pearl River Delta, letting local raw silk participate in the international trade system. You should understand what this means." Li Yao'er went out for inspection today, so Zhang Xiao talked about the silk industry on her behalf.

"Sericulture improvement?"

"Those present presumably all know that silk is a big industry of Guangzhou Prefecture. Yue Satin and Yue Yarn are famous far and near, selling overseas. Pity, ah pity. The quality of Yue Satin is dense and even, its color bright and lustrous and smooth. However, it must be woven with Wu Silkworm silk. If woven with local silk, it is dull and lusterless, color also not obvious. Only feasible within Yue borders; distant merchants don't take it."

Zeng Xingxiang said, "Parent Zhang truly knows the products of this township like the back of the hand. Correct. Woven with native silk is called Silk Yarn, price also cheap. Foshan Yarn is also woven with native silk into patterns, all using printing blocks. Raw silk easily splits; cooked silk easily fuzzes. Jiujiang cocoons and Longjiang cocoons are both inferior."

Precisely because of the problem of local silkworm seeds, silkworm silk quality was far inferior to Jiangnan, so much that local famous silk workshops had to purchase Lake Silk as raw material to produce Yue Satin and Yue Yarn. The so-called Gambiered Canton Gauze (*Xiangyun Sha*) was also an invention of the early Republic of China. Villagers of Minle Village, Xiqiao, improved the loom, applying small jacquard and manpower pulling flower method, creating a new variety with twisted eye openwork circles. At this time, more than forty years had passed since Chen Qiyuan opened the first machine filature.

The reason Chen Qiyuan's filature could seize a part of the international market was entirely relying on the cocoon market to select cocoons, sending high-quality cocoons to machine filatures for processing through higher technical means, naturally strengthening the competitiveness in the international market. While inferior cocoons were sold to operators of foot-tread reeling machines and hand reeling machines to reel silk, their products were put into the local silk weaving industry. From the perspective of the whole sericulture area, the quality of silkworms and mulberry didn't change at all, so cocoon quality naturally had no improvement to speak of. This was the true situation of modern Yue Silk improvement.

In other words, without the appearance of machine filatures, Guangdong native silk basically couldn't enter the eyes of East and West Ocean merchants. Before the Daoguang era, international trade didn't stimulate the sericulture industry in the Pearl River Delta region much.

Zhang Xiao continued, "Fish, silkworm, mulberry; everyone's family business is tied to this. To complete this great cause, building a new-style primary school and an agricultural technology school as support is also needed."

If ordinary people heard this, they would have wept with joy long ago, kowtowing to thank imperial grace. But these "human spirits" of the Ming Dynasty had many twists and turns in their bellies. Their doubts, in modern words, were "So, what is the price?"

Guan Boyi stood up and said, "Parent Zhang thinks thoughtfully; truly the rebirth parent of us. Wonder how we can repay?"

"Repayment is unnecessary, but as I said before, must follow our rules."

"Willing to hear details."

"Relevant industries must be managed as companies. Whether fish fry breeding company, or silkworm seed company, or schools, all will have the Senate providing personnel and technology. Those present willing to participate provide ponds, land, and funds. Each clan carries out corporate transformation, using clan property as start-up capital. Profit will be distributed as dividends according to shares after deducting funds needed for expanded reproduction. Considering clan property is owned by the whole clan, then male adults in the clan should reasonably all hold shares. Company operation must comply with the regulations of the Great Song *Company Law*. Accounts executed according to new accounting standards. Finance and Taxation Bureau sends people to audit regularly..." Zhang Xiao then proposed the Senate's set of requirements for corporate transformation of clans. Playing conspiracies and plots, this group of modern people was definitely not the opponent of gentry. The Senate also disdained to play mind games with them. With powerful military force as backing, if fighting, fight with open cards; if playing, play open stratagems.

The news revealed by Zhang Xiao was more shocking one after another. Gentry momentarily didn't know whether to be happy or worried. Happy that this Magistrate Zhang seemed to have a special affection for Jiujiang; worried about "must follow our rules."

"This... Can we be allowed to go back to discuss with clansmen before replying?" Guan Boyi asked.

Massive information made them unable to think it through. After all, the change was truly too big, simply earth-shaking. Others also followed to propose going back to seek clan opinions. Although they were heads of clans, they couldn't dispose of clan property at will.

"Good. Give you three days. Three days later we go to Longjiang and Longshan." Zhang Xiao answered readily, implying gentry elsewhere were all waiting to get on the Senate's boat. Besides, letting them take this opportunity to carry out clan reform was giving them face. If refusing face given, the Senate had plenty of ways to deal with them.

The gentry all understood the implied meaning in Zhang Xiao's words. After all, they firmly heard more or less that clans in Xiangshan already carried out so-called corporate reform, and were publicized everywhere by Australians as models. If not agreeing, this huge benefit would probably fall elsewhere.

"Parent Zhang rest assured. There will be a reply within three days."

"As for the advancement path of scholars you proposed, the Senate also has considerations on this matter. Soon Nanhai County Educational Inspector will come locally to preach education policy. Answering doubts then, everyone can speak freely—just that the Great Ming's imperial examinations won't exist anymore in the future."
