# Chapter 2574 - Heated Debate (Part 2)

Liu Dalin picked up his teacup, used the lid to push the tea leaves aside, took a sip to moisten his throat, and also to calm his emotions. Only then did he speak: "Everyone thinks the Bōbō Army is invincible in attack and unstoppable in battle because of their powerful firearms—one cannon devastating dozens of li. This is truly seeing only the leaves and missing the forest..."

"Does Mengliang have a different view?"

"Indeed," said Liu Dalin, seeming to return to that afternoon many years ago when the Australians first held a public funeral. Wu Ya, the county vice-magistrate who had changed into commoner clothes and cap to blend in with the onlookers and investigate, came back and vividly described the scene to him.

"...No theater troupe's gongs and drums, no Daoist priests' grand rituals, no women's mournful wailing. The honor guard soldiers marched in precise formation, carrying rifles in ranks. As the bugle fell silent, two drummers led the way, the military drums beating slowly. Two black horses of a breed never seen before—tall and magnificent—pulled a black four-wheeled artillery carriage at a slow walk. On the carriage rested a simple unadorned wooden coffin. The horses' hooves struck the flagstones, keeping time with the slow drumbeat. Everything was unprecedented. Nothing could better express mourning and grief. The atmosphere was so intense Wu Ya could barely breathe.

"At a command, seven soldiers simultaneously raised rifles to fire into the air, three volleys in succession. The crisp gunshots echoed around the hillside. All around was silence. In that silence, the mournful bugle sounded again, twenty-four notes playing slowly. Everyone present was moved to tears.

"As earth covered the coffin, Elder Wen Desi personally read the eulogy..."

Having finished this story, Liu Dalin was still moved: "Who would have thought that such an elaborate funeral was prepared for an unknown common soldier?"

"It was really just for a dead soldier?" The classmates present all voiced the same doubt in unison. They had never heard this story from any "Australia-expert," and it seemed quite incredible.

"I later specifically sent someone to verify. The name carved on the gravestone was Li Shisan," Liu Dalin said.

"At first it was just buying a horse's bones for a thousand gold pieces to buy hearts," someone sneered. "I don't believe every Baldy soldier who dies in battle gets such a funeral."

"If you mean exactly identical, indeed not," Liu Dalin said frankly. "But when military personnel are buried, there are always complete ceremonies. Four times a year, soldiers and students sweep the graves and lay flowers. Year after year, season after season. I ask you: in our dynasty, leaving aside common soldiers, even those who've risen to the rank of General or Commander—does the court show such respect after their deaths?"

Everyone fell silent. The court didn't think much of military men. Death in battle just meant routine condolences—posthumous honors were quite thin. As for annual tomb-sweeping, that could only depend on family and friends.

"Support in life, burial in death. Then soldiers will fight—this is the natural order of things." Liu Dalin said. "In my humble view, the most ingenious feature of the Australian military system is the existence of the Soldiers' Committee."

"Soldiers' Committee?" Everyone struggled to keep up with the new terms constantly emerging from Liu Dalin's mouth.

Liu Dalin explained: "The system established by the Senate is based on equality for all. The Bōbō Army has Soldiers' Committees at every level, composed of several men elected by all soldiers. For all matters concerning soldiers' interests—clothing, food, housing, transportation—they have supervisory and investigative authority. If a commanding officer embezzles funds, harms soldiers' rights, or abuses soldiers, the Soldiers' Committee has the right to appeal to higher-ranking officers or even the military headquarters. Once verified, the officer will be severely punished."

Due to late Ming custom, most scholar-officials studied some military texts. Whether Sun Wu, Bai Qi, Han Xin, or Wei Qing, Huo Qubing, Zhuge Kongming—throughout history those who used troops like gods enforced military discipline like mountains and would behead offenders to establish authority. Generals who shared hardships with common soldiers were rare indeed. As for "subordinates challenging superiors"—that was outrageous rebellion. The saying went: "When commoners sue officials, even the innocent are guilty."

Zhao Xunru couldn't help voicing his doubt: "What Mengliang describes is truly unimaginable. If soldiers routinely lodge complaints, officers have no authority. How then can military orders be enforced? How can enemies be defeated in battle?"

But He Wuzhou said: "Brother Housheng is mistaken. Mengliang's meaning is that in deploying troops and charging into battle, soldiers must still obey officers' orders. Anyone who violates battle orders or cowers before the enemy still cannot escape military law."

Liu Dalin nodded: "The Two Guangs are frontier regions of great importance, yet military administration has fallen into decay. The ranks are depleted, and Guangzhou is especially severe. But this isn't unique to Guangzhou—the entire realm is the same. Why? Military farming colonies were originally an excellent ancient method of both cultivating and defending. Yet military colony commanders in the capital and provinces care only about enriching themselves. Some seize monthly wages, some press soldiers into private labor and commerce, some use levies to deduct monthly stipends, some reduce cloth rations on pretext of drills and supplies. Soldiers wear rags, eat gruel, have no medicine when sick, no coffins when dead. They swallow their resentment in silence with nowhere to appeal. The colony lands in Chaozhou were famously fertile, yet most were secretly occupied by garrison officers or seized by powerful households. Colony supervisors extorted tribute money from soldiers and engaged in corruption. How could soldiers not go hungry? Since the Zhengde reign, military ranks have become degraded and despised by society. Capital officials in ministries and censors, provincial military supervisors and military-civil governors all pile pressure on them. The Five Armies Command Office is like a useless appendage, officers treated like errand boys. When Li Sunchen [Li Boxiang] entered the Hanlin, he immediately changed to civilian registration, avoiding any mention of his military household origins. Brother Longyou knows my words are true."

Actually, when Zhu Yuanzhang established the military household system, he didn't treat military households as degraded status like the Later Jin and Southern and Northern Dynasties. Military households, besides the burden of military service and garrison administration, were no different from civilian households. There was no discriminatory policy. Many Ming officials came from military household backgrounds—most famously Zhang Juzheng.

But the military household system, through long operation, suffered from heavy oppression and burdens. With mass desertions and concealment, the court either conscripted criminals into the military or forced civilian households to register. Gradually, military households' social status declined precipitously. Civilians were unwilling to marry or associate with them. Though nominally commoners, they were often no different from base-born.

He Wuzhou's expression changed slightly at these words. Li Sunchen was his fellow townsman. After becoming Minister of Rites in Nanjing, at the public military household burial ground of Great Army Mountain, Li built walls around it and decorated the gate with "Minister's Ancestral Estate"—to distinguish himself from the common military households. Only during Qingming festival through the tomb-closing period each year would he open it for other military household surnames to enter and pay respects. This was precisely because military status was so low that the Li clan couldn't wait to erase traces of their origins.

More critically, He Wuzhou himself came from military household background. Everyone present understood that Liu Dalin hadn't named him directly but spoke of Li Sunchen to preserve this classmate brother's dignity.

"Indeed so," He Wuzhou wiped his brow and answered.

Liu Dalin continued: "In the Bōbō Army, officers and soldiers are equal. Officers may not humiliate soldiers—otherwise there's the Soldiers' Committee to file complaints. Military marriages are protected by law. If some rake seduces a soldier's wife, the Senate severely punishes him. Soldiers earn two yuan monthly, not passing through officers' hands. Pay is distributed face-to-face with no deductions. Meals are all supplied by the military. Each year, summer and winter uniforms are issued, two sets each. The military has special army doctors to treat illness for free, all with miraculous healing abilities. Support in life, reliance in illness, burial at Jade Hill when dead. As Sunzi said: 'Which ruler has the Way? Which general has ability? Who has heaven and earth's favor? Whose laws are enforced? Whose troops are stronger? Whose soldiers are trained? Whose rewards and punishments are clear? By these I know who wins and who loses.'"

How could these scholar-officials not know that the Ming garrison system had long since collapsed? They'd had to shift to recruitment, yet soldiers' enlistment and discharge had no mature system. Military social status was low, and soldiers lived by the sword's edge. In Ming armies, wage arrears were common. Soldiers wouldn't fight, desertions were frequent. Some would collect pay from one army then go join another to collect again. As the saying goes, "Good iron isn't made into nails, good men don't become soldiers." Good families would never send their sons to be common soldiers. Criminals, paupers, rogues, bandits, and drifters enlisting became the norm. Soldiers and bandits were indistinguishable.

But Chen Zizhuang had to admit that Ming's circumstances were completely different from the Baldies'. Even knowing the Australian military system had its merits, there was no way to emulate it.

He immediately said: "Though the Australians have a ruler, they call him a 'figurehead.' Figurehead means 'not real.' All power rests with the Senate. Isn't this just Cao Cao holding the Emperor hostage to command the lords? The Australians' so-called 'equality for all'—this is unprecedented upheaval in three thousand years, no different from the collapse of rites and music in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Can father and son be equal? Filial piety is the root of virtue, the source of all teaching. Our bodies, hair, and skin we receive from our parents—we dare not damage them. This is how filial piety begins. To establish ourselves along the Way, make our names known to posterity, and thereby bring glory to our parents—this is how filial piety is completed. Filial piety begins with serving parents, continues with serving the sovereign, and ends with establishing oneself. Of the three thousand crimes under the five punishments, none is greater than unfilial conduct. Those who intimidate their sovereign recognize no superior; those who disparage sages recognize no law; those who are unfilial recognize no kin. This is the path to great chaos!"

Yao Dian also agreed with Chen Zizhuang's view: "I've heard that the people of Lingao mostly violate human order, knowing no clan relations. If they have resentments they cannot contain, they take up clubs and beat each other at will—do they distinguish elders from juniors? Those people are ignorant of propriety and righteousness. Though born of the same womb, they feel like strangers from Hu and Yue. Though living under the same roof, they pass like travelers on the road. They calculate the tiniest profit and abandon the deepest affection—do they know brotherly duty? All this comes from thin customs and corruption of human relations—grave harm to morality. The Australians call themselves Song descendants. 'Crooked Prime Minister' Wang Anshi's reforms loudly proclaimed 'Heaven's changes need not be feared, ancestral ways need not be followed, men's talk need not be heeded.' The *Veritable Records of Emperor Shenzong* assessed the New Faction as 'falsely claiming to continue, openly slandering and deceiving, exhausting false praise on Xining reform ministers.' Later ages all considered that Song's fall was the fault of employing petty men. Who are these petty men? Ding Wei, Cai Bian, Zhang Dun, Wang Anshi, and their ilk. Ancestors are the source from which our bodies emerged—established at birth and unchangeable. Honoring ancestors means carefully preserving ancestral teachings. Establishing clan leaders, clarifying genealogies, makes everyone know their origins. Setting up clan fields and charity estates gives all widowed, orphaned, poor, and weak clan members something to rely on—this is how to unite the clan. This is a thousand-year legacy of clan law. Now the Australians practice evil laws, wanting to destroy our clans, scatter our people, transform Xia into Yi. Their hearts deserve death!"

Though the words were grandly righteous, they all understood clearly: the reason the Australians viewed clans as thorns in their eyes was that one shouldn't let others sleep soundly beside one's own bed. The Australians wanted to establish a Qin-First-Emperor-style system with laws reaching directly to the grassroots, unable to tolerate vast local powers within their domain.

Imperial statecraft had always been "outwardly Confucian, inwardly Legalist." The Australians' actions, to scholars, weren't anything novel. Yet though Qin did ultimately unify the Six States, it also left the historical lesson of "falling after only two generations." The Han dynasty nominally "honored Confucianism exclusively" but actually practiced "outwardly Confucian, inwardly Legalist"—essentially a correction of Qin-era politics.
