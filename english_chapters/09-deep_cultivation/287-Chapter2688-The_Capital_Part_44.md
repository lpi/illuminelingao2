# Chapter 2688: The Capital (Part 44)

The expression on Mr. Zhou's face became increasingly disappointed; it could be seen that his mood also became very bad.

After a long while, he said: "Master Wang, I want to go look at all the places the Shorn-hair Thieves passed through. Can guides and guards be arranged?"

"This is easy. Wait for me to arrange it." Wang Yehao saw his expression changing unpredictably, from surprise to disbelief, then to fear, loathing, disappointment... It seemed Liu Sha's words had taken effect.

Originally, these matters were not fabricated out of thin air either. Wang Yehao had long seen that although Hearthstone Immortal seemed cynical, spoke without knowing weight or propriety, and was a bit greedy for money and lecherous, essentially he was a "kind-hearted generation."

Just looking at his attitude towards bondmaids would tell; ordinary people, regardless of high or low status, hadn't been this good even to their formally wedded wives, let alone bondmaids.

In one sentence, Hearthstone Immortal was a soft-hearted and kind "Useless Good Person."

To make him continue to follow himself dead set on the ground [devotedly], without defecting to his Australian accomplices, only sowing discord would work.

The Shorn-hair Thieves' arson and looting outside Guangzhou City this time actually helped him a hand invisibly.

"The Shorn-hair Thieves have now established a title and proclaimed an era." Wang Yehao said, "This matter is troublesome!"

Sea bandits and roving bandits were not rare; the Court could suppress or appease them. But if they established a title and proclaimed an era, it meant they wanted to stand as equals against the Court. Even though the roving bandits in the Northwest had monstrous power, they only called themselves certain Kings or Generals, still using the Great Ming's era name, and had no dynastic title.

Mr. Zhou naturally understood this principle too. Immediately he asked: "They founded a state? Called what?"

"The Shorn-hair Thieves call themselves descendants of the Song, flying the banner of 'Australian Song' [Ao Song]. However, sometimes they also call themselves the 'Great Song Australian Temporary Court.' Externally they call themselves the Fubo Army."

Mr. Zhou, whose face was originally dark, suddenly revealed an expression of being unable to suppress laughter. Seemingly finding it very laughable.

"What about the Era Name?"

"They say it's 'Common Era' [Gong Yuan]..."

"Common Era?!" Hearthstone Daoist slapped the table and stood up. "Worshipping foreign things!"

"What?" Several people were stunned.

Hearthstone Immortal then explained that the so-called Common Era was the calendar used by Red Hairs and Franks, circulating in various Western countries.

"So that's how it is." Wang Yehao became more confused. What relationship did these Australians have with Westerners? If handled poorly, they might be colluding with foreign oceans; one could not be imprudent!

"This is strange indeed." Jin Wenchi said in a low voice: "Raising troops to carve out territory, falsely borrowing the name of a former dynasty's remnants is common. It's just unheard of to add a prefix before the dynastic title; isn't this clearly stating one is not the legitimate line? 'Great Song Australian Temporary Court'—this can barely be counted as a title."

"In the lowly one's opinion, there must be a profound mystery within." Liu Sha's divination instinct began to display. "The National Dynasty [Ming] stands on Fire Virtue, and the Former Song was also Fire Virtue. Attacking Fire with Fire, how can things be accomplished? Therefore, the Shorn-hair Thieves added an 'Ao' [Bay/Inlet - Water radical] character, desiring to turn to Water Virtue. Hearing that Shorn-hair Thieves esteem black and blue in attire, presumably there is also this consideration."

"Yes, nowadays their external proclamations mostly call themselves 'Fubo Army'; besides citing Ma Yuan's old allusion, it is probably also taking a Water Virtue."

Wang Yehao didn't judge, asking: "What does Mr. Zhou think?"

Mr. Zhou had a face full of blankness; even Zhou Lezhi could see the Teacher knew nothing about this. But in order not to reveal timidity, he still nodded pretending to be deep:

"En, this, Master Liu speaks very reasonably. That... Was Former Song also Fire Virtue? I thought it was Wood Virtue."

"Has the Teacher not heard the phrase 'The Inflamed [Fire] Song rose, receiving Zhou's abdication'?" Liu Sha had a face full of astonishment.

Mr. Zhou really couldn't remember the source, but seeing everyone's expression seeming to be that only he didn't know, he was embarrassed to press further, laughing embarrassedly.

"These Shorn-hair Thieves establishing a title and changing the era name already shows a heart of insubordination." Wang Yehao sighed with emotion. "It's just that Guangdong suffered this calamity, living souls blackened [suffering], mountains and rivers broken; for a moment and a while, there is no power to suppress again!"

Jin Wenchi understood the Master's mind best, saying: "Nowadays we can only endure without releasing, waiting for the Shorn-hair Thieves to confuse themselves [fall into chaos]. It's just regarding the Shorn-hair Thieves' inside information, we don't know much..."

Liu Sha laughed: "What is difficult about this? The lowly one has a ready-made person here, originally a Lingao local, who fled back from Regional Commander He's campaign to Lingao. He knows the Shorn-hair Thieves' situation clearly."

"There is still such a person?!" Wang Yehao was somewhat surprised. "Where is the person?"

"He ran back daring not to show his face; nowadays he is muddling along in a *Doukou* [Beggar's Den]. The lowly one sent a few people to stare at him. If Master wants to ask, just catch him here anytime."

"You go get him and settle him down; don't frighten him." Wang Yehao instructed. What he needed most now was someone who understood the Thieves' Situation.

After Gou Chengxuan escaped from Liu Sha's palm, he hardened his heart, found a *Doukou*, paid respect to the *Dagu* [Boss], and counted as joining the local Beggar's Gang.

With the protection of the Guandi Temple's forces, his status as a runaway was no longer a hindrance; the government wouldn't come to cause trouble. Because he was of scholar origin and knew writing and ink, he was kept by the *Dagu* in the *Doukou* to do some clerical matters; days passed quite comfortably. Gradually he wasn't so guarded anymore.

Unexpectedly, this day on the street he was bundled into a sack by someone, stuffed into a sedan chair in darkness, and carried for unknown distance. He feared greatly in his heart, deeply afraid it was Shorn-hair Thieves' people coming for revenge.

Waiting until the sack was untied, he came out to look and found himself already in a hall. Standing facing him was that fortune-telling Daoist!

Gou Chengxuan panicked. This Daoist grasped him without letting go initially, and now specially tied him back... What heart did he harbor?

"Don't know Sir's honorable surname and great name?"

Another man's voice came leisurely. Gou Chengxuan then discovered there were still several people sitting in the hall.

Looking at their appearance, there were youths and middle-aged men, all dressed as gentry or scholars; couldn't make out the background. But the person speaking was older in age, bearing and manner different from ordinary people; obviously was an official, and a big official at that.

Gou Chengxuan's brain turned fast, knowing the comer was not an ordinary robber—he had nothing now, and wasn't some handsome youth; as long as not Shorn-hair Thieves, anyone was easy to talk to. Immediately he settled his spirit, cupping his hands: "Student Gou Chengxuan. Don't know Sir..."

"Since you call yourself Student, presumably you are also a scholar. Why mix in a *Doukou*, keeping company with beggars?"

This question counted as touching Gou Chengxuan's sore spot; he couldn't help sighing long: "Not hiding from Sir, Student was originally also a Licentiate who entered school, with slightly meager property at home. Alas, the family suffered a calamity, thus falling to this."

"Oh, since so, you speak for us to hear."

Gou Chengxuan increasingly felt the old man before him was unfathomable. He had already determined the old man must be a big official, and didn't look like a Shorn-hair Thief. Immediately, he told the story from beginning to end: how Shorn-hair Thieves landed in Lingao, Gou Family Village was attacked, he and his father became fish that slipped the net escaping to Guangzhou, later how they split up to act, how he defected to Regional Commander He's command to scheme for the campaign against Thieves, and then how defeat happened in Lingao and he fled back.

"...You say, Gou Family Village, the whole village was slaughtered?" The old man hadn't spoken yet when a young advisor-looking man next to him interrupted in surprise and asked.

Gou Chengxuan looked carefully; he didn't know this person, not knowing why he cared so much about Gou Family Village.

"Men and women, old and young, not one left. Student's uncle, several aunts, were either killed or committed suicide. The clan's old and young were all slaughtered; even maids and servants were not spared. Pity my Gou Family Village, four to five hundred mouths up and down, were killed cleanly; only our father and son, master and servant, four people escaped..."

Thinking of himself originally being the Grand Master Gou who called wind and summoned rain, bullying men and dominating women in Lingao County, now reduced to a beggar in a *Doukou*, the flight, contempt, insults, injuries during this period... all kinds of bitterness welled up in his heart, involuntarily crying loudly.

The advisor who asked questions had a face full of compassion, sitting down blindly as if lost.

The old man, however, was calm and composed, saying: "Since your father also escaped, and there are two followers, where are they all now?"

"My father took one servant, originally all in Danzhou, contacting righteous men, preparing to respond to the Heavenly Army. The other one originally followed me to Lingao; currently whereabouts unknown..."

The old man obviously didn't know where Danzhou was. Another middle-aged advisor by his side whispered a few sentences, and he nodded. Gou Chengxuan felt the other party had meaning of appreciation; the heart fire that was originally extremely dark burned up again like dead ashes reigniting.

"Speaking so, you have hatred with the Shorn-hair Thieves."

"Irreconcilable [cannot live under same sky]." At this moment Gou Chengxuan was completely sure the other party was the Shorn-hair Thieves' enemy; speaking became increasingly resolute.

"Now the Court's campaign against Shorn-hair Thieves failed; Shorn-hair Thieves' power is monstrous. How should it be handled?"

Gou Chengxuan was stunned: these words faintly had the meaning of government affairs inquiry; this old man was not simple! He thought for a moment and said: "Endure and wait for opportunity, to watch for Shorn-hair Thieves' internal chaos!"

Wang Yehao was secretly surprised: "Endure and wait for opportunity" was not rare; with the current situation in Guangdong, one had to endure even if not wanting to. The so-called waiting for opportunity was just a pretext for playing the grandson. But the latter sentence showed real substance.

"Why does Sir feel the Shorn-hair Thieves will have internal chaos?"

"Master doesn't know; these Shorn-hair Thieves are different from ordinary bandits..." Gou Chengxuan immediately explained that Shorn-hair Thieves were all Senators; although Wen and Ma were called bandit chiefs, in terms of status they were just members among Senators. "...Among Shorn-hair Thieves, long have there been people dissatisfied with Wen and Ma stealing authority. At the beginning of landing, originally Shorn-hair Thieves had a crowd of a thousand; later due to unfair distribution of women, they killed each other; only then did it fall to only remain a few hundred Senators."

"So that's how it is." Wang Yehao twirled his beard and pondered; it seemed this "watch for Shorn-hair Thieves' internal chaos" was not an empty phrase. At this moment, he unconsciously valued Gou Chengxuan a few points more; after all, up to now, no one could provide such detailed and accurate news yet. In comparison, this Hearthstone Immortal instead knew nothing about this... Thinking of this, he involuntarily glanced at Mr. Zhou.

Hearthstone Immortal's expression at this moment was like having eaten a fly. One only saw him ask slowly: "Did they really fight over women?"

Gou Chengxuan said with absolute certainty: "Can this be fake? Everyone in Lingao knows!" Although not knowing why this advisor cared so much about this matter, seeing it was about Shorn-hair Thieves' ugly scandals, Gou Chengxuan instantly got spirit, adding oil and vinegar again, finally saying: "In order to protect themselves, Wen and Ma sent many people everywhere to search, buy, and loot women for their lewd pleasure. Invading the Pearl River this time, they looted many women again..."
