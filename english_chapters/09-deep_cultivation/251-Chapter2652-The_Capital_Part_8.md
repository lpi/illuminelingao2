# Chapter 2652: The Capital (Part 8)

The woman nodded but did not answer.

Li Rufeng continued, "There is a broken tree by the roadside. The bandits must have waited for Master Leng's carriage to arrive, then pulled down the broken tree to block the path of the carriage and horses. Archers on both sides fired together to kill the guards. After succeeding, they pulled the broken tree away and took Mister Leng and the draft horses. But they left the carriage and the corpses on the spot."

Robbing and killing a carriage on the official road in broad daylight—ten years ago, this would have been a fantasy, but now it was a common occurrence. Passersby mostly dared not intervene even if they heard the sounds of killing and cries for help.

The woman said, "Since Mister Leng's corpse is not on the scene, he is most likely still alive. Go back and immediately interrogate the servants of the Leng residence carefully to clarify the sequence of events. If we are a step late, I'm afraid they will be detained by the government office as witnesses."

Li Rufeng felt like he had stepped into an abyss, falling endlessly into infinite darkness, sinking, sinking.

If it were a simple kidnapping for ransom, it would be easy to handle. Whether spending money to settle it or tracking and rescuing him, neither would be too difficult—such bandits had routines. Following the "tongues" and "bird listeners," plus various connections in the capital, they could always find clues to track them down.

But judging from the signs at the scene, the comers were obviously not ordinary kidnappers, but had acted with intent.

If so, their action after capturing Manager Leng would be to hide. In this vast Northland, finding a person was like looking for a needle in a haystack. The possibility of successfully rescuing Leng Ningyun was less than ten percent. If Leng Ningyun was kidnapped by enemies to the mountainous areas north of the capital, there would be no possibility of rescue.

The problem was, they still didn't know why Manager Leng had suddenly appeared on the official road to Haidian—except for going to Tianjin every month, he almost never left the capital in these years. Moreover, he would always inform "Heliansheng" to dispatch escort masters for protection when going out.

Even Wu Kaidi didn't know his whereabouts. This was too strange!

The problem was, Leng Ningyun was not a rash young man; he was known for his caution and care on ordinary days. Li Rufeng really couldn't imagine what could make him take the risk to go out.

Li Rufeng glanced at the woman beside him. Currently, the only escort masters within the establishment in the capital were himself and that woman. Female escort masters were rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, whether in the Great Ming or Lingao, and Golden Phoenix Liao Sanniang was the leader among them.

He sucked in a big breath of cold air gloomily. It was too far. They couldn't wait for the Senate's rescue. In this world where the Senate's arm couldn't reach, there was only them.

Shuntian Prefecture Judge Liu Yike, draped in a sable cloak from outside the Pass, was still shivering from the cold—the north wind on this main road was chilling to the bone. He pulled down his eye veil, looking at the busy Fast Squad bailiffs and the Wanping Magistrate standing aside with a dull face knowing nothing, and felt a secret fire in his heart—what was this surnamed Leng doing running out of the city in such cold weather!

Delong's people were already at the scene. Needless to say, their news came even faster than the Shuntian Prefecture Yin; they probably arrived as soon as the city gates opened. Of course, Judge Liu did not mean to blame them. After all, Delong had never missed his share of the "Three Festivals and Two Birthdays" gifts over the years. This little face still had to be given.

The coroner had finished filling out the corpse form. Subsequently, the Wanping Magistrate came to ask: Could the corpses be allowed for Delong to claim back?

"Let them sign a bond and claim them back, but do not bury them for the time being," Liu Yike instructed. "Just in case someone else wants to examine the corpses."

"Yes."

"Also, send all the physical evidence seized at the scene to the Shuntian Prefecture Yamen, and pull the carriage back to Shuntian Prefecture for inspection." Liu Yike was eager for this field survey in the wild to end quickly; he could hardly stand the freezing cold.

Returning to the Shuntian Prefecture Yamen, Liu Yike reported the survey details to Zhong Kai one by one and sent over all the physical evidence collected from the carriage and the corpses.

"The carriage has also been brought back; it is parked in the stable."

"Were there people from Delong at the scene?" Zhong Kai asked.

"They also arrived. The corpses have been claimed back with a bond."

"Master, we should summon the witnesses..." the private secretary reminded.

Zhong Kai pondered for a moment but said, "No hurry. Let's wait a while."

After all, this was a major case, and the interrogation would involve a wide range of people. Witnesses were the "ATM machines" for the clerks and bailiffs. Once summoned to the case and locked into the detention room, they would be exploited at will. It was common for a victim's family to be ruined or lose their fortune over a homicide case.

Neither Zhong Kai nor Liu Yike cared whether Delong or the Leng family would be ruined or lose their fortune. But Delong had been in the capital for several years, accepting deposits from too many high officials and nobles and handling many remittances. If it suddenly collapsed because of this case causing operational turnover failure, the consequences would be unimaginable. Even someone as upright as Zhong Kai had to weigh the consequences and give Delong a buffer to make arrangements.

Moreover, judging from Liu Yike's survey, nine out of ten chances were that this was not done by ordinary thieves; there were likely certain powers involved behind the scenes.

Using the power of Shuntian Prefecture to investigate would be constrained by all sides and might not be able to clarify the case. On the contrary, it would be more convenient to let Delong spend money to hire people to investigate the case themselves. With their financial power and social network in the capital, this was not a difficult task.

In the living room of Heliansheng, several core members of the Beijing Station sat facing the two leading escort masters of Heliansheng. Dim light penetrated through the willow-leaf lattice of the partition door, pulling out rays of oblique light. Countless floating dust particles drifted in the light, making the air appear turbid and oppressive. The air pressure in the room was terrifyingly low; only an occasional cough revealed a trace of vitality.

Li Rufeng's body was pressed against the back of the officials' hat chair. His left hand rubbed the beard under his chin, and his right hand rested loosely on the armrest, the two walnuts rolling in his palm rubbing against each other continuously, making a creaking, grating sound.

After a long silence, Li Rufeng looked at Wu Kaidi, staring dead into his eyes, and said slowly, "Old Wu, we of Qiwei have handled errands for the Senators not once or twice. We are all close attendants and have never made a mistake. This is Beijing City, the center of the world, a heavy ground of the metropolitan area. It has strategic advantages and solid defenses. The city prohibitions are the strictest. There is the Wardens' Office of the Five Wards during the day and the Patrol Battalion at night, patrolling ceaselessly day and night. The various wards and alleys in the city also have military patrol stations, each with heads and firemen to maintain order. Although the Great Ming is currently in decline and there have been quite a few disturbances and thefts in the capital recently, as long as one does not leave the capital, there will absolutely be no major blunders. Bandits dare not strike inside the city for this very reason."

Li Rufeng coughed and continued, "Therefore, the rule of the Beijing Station is that if Master Leng leaves the city, he must first notify 'Heliansheng', and extra personnel must be added for travel. But today, I didn't receive any message, and..." Li Rufeng paused here before continuing, "Mister Wu is Master Leng's shadow; why didn't you follow him today?" Li Rufeng's tone was faint, so faint it had no emotion.

Wu Kaidi felt quite uncomfortable being stared at by Li Rufeng. Hearing these words, he couldn't help bouncing up from his chair, his face iron-blue as he protested, "What? Escort Head Li, do you suspect me?"

Before Li Rufeng could speak, Liao Sanniang smiled gently from the side and interjected, "This tea smells so fragrant; it clears the heart and removes fire. Only you two, please." Her voice was raspy, carrying a trace of charm. After speaking, she ignored the others and picked up the teacup to take a sip herself.

Putting down the teacup, Liao Sanniang's expression tightened. She said solemnly to Li Rufeng, "I naturally understand the fire in both your hearts, but do not let family members resent each other. If Mister Wu truly had the heart to sell us out, this escort agency, this draft bank, and this large mansion with several courtyards would have been confiscated long ago, and our heads would have been displayed in the West Market long ago. Would we still need to wait until today?"

Wu Kaidi said from the side, "Sanniangzi is fair."

Li Rufeng snorted coldly and spoke no more.

At this point, Liao Sanniang stood up leisurely from her seat. She was twenty-five or twenty-six years old. Even indoors at night, she still wore a cloak that almost dragged on the ground. On her long oval face were a pair of slender phoenix eyes, and a few pale white pockmarks dotted the bridge of her nose. Her seven-*chi* body was even taller than many men, giving everyone present an indescribable sense of pressure.

After standing up, Liao Sanniang looked around at everyone, paused, and then continued, "With this incident happening, what is the first thing everyone here thinks of?"

The few people present were all stunned. They looked at each other, but no one spoke.

Liao Sanniang giggled and said, "Let me say it openly for everyone. What you are all plotting in your hearts is *Tao Zhi Yao Yao* [fleeing/escaping]."

As soon as these words came out, the faces of everyone present changed. Immediately, a Beijing Station member stood up and shouted loudly, "Liao Sanniang, what nonsense are you talking about here!"

Liao Sanniang sneered and said, "Assistant Manager Xiao, just now when you left home, what did you instruct your page boy? What about packing up? What about rolling up the bundle? What about Delong's silver?"

Everyone's eyes suddenly became strange, all looking at that Assistant Manager Xiao together. At the same time, the colors on their faces changed, obviously showing they all had things on their minds. Assistant Manager Xiao's face flushed red instantly, and he shouted sternly, "Slut! How dare you practice the ways of the Factory and Guard!"

After pausing for a moment, Assistant Manager Xiao thought of something, and his face suddenly turned pale. He trembled, "You, you are from the Political Security Bureau!"

There was a commotion among the people in the room.

Liao Sanniang walked to the hall door and looked through the half-open door crack into the courtyard. The branches and leaves of the ancient tree in the courtyard were sparse. The autumn wind was bleak, shaking down a patch of autumn leaves.

Liao Sanniang wrapped the cloak tighter around her body and muttered to herself, "The weather has turned cold; one leaf reveals the autumn."

After finishing her soliloquy, she turned around, shook her head at Assistant Manager Xiao, and said, "Assistant Manager Xiao is overthinking. Qiwei is Qiwei; it is not Political Security, nor Military Intelligence. It is just that being in a dangerous place at an extraordinary time, one must use extraordinary means." After speaking, she paced slowly as if no one else was present. Everyone's gaze moved slowly with her figure.

Liao Sanniang continued, "Losing a Senator is something that has never happened since the Great Song established the state in Lingao. To the Great Ming, I fear it is equivalent to losing an Imperial Prince. This is a hole as big as the sky; even if Goddess Nuwa came, she couldn't fill it. No one can shoulder this responsibility. It is unknown if we will all be dragged out and shot. It is true that everyone is afraid; wanting to survive is also human nature."

Hearing these words, sweat appeared on the foreheads of everyone present.
