# Chapter 2507: Burning the Tower (20)

Hearing this point, Xue Tu looked at Wooden Stone with doubt in his eyes and said, "Why does Daoist Wooden Stone boost the morale of the Kun thieves and dampen our spirit?"

Wooden Stone glanced at Xue Tu and said indifferently, "Does Brother Xue think he has seen the general trend clearly? You do not know that straddling two boats sometimes allows for leeway to advance or retreat, but sometimes it leads to relying on neither side and falling into the river. Sometimes, even after boarding a boat, one gets knocked into the water by a bamboo pole. The key is not which boat you step on, but which boat's seat you have bought."

Speaking to this point, Wooden Stone Daoist returned to his seat, poured himself a cup, took a sip of wine, and signaled Yun Ting with a glance.

Yun Ting took out a stack of papers from his bosom, handed them over, and said, "Brother Xue, please first take a look at this item."

Xue Tu took the papers suspiciously. It was a document. The document was handwritten in extremely spirited small regular script of the Yan style. Following Australian writing rules, it was written horizontally from left to right, with punctuation between sentences. The title at the top boldly read "Guangdong Key Bandit Intelligence Notification." Just seeing the title conditioned Xue Tu to jump in fright. Xue Tu hurriedly gathered his focus to read carefully. The text read: "During the transitional period since the recovery of Guangdong, due to the collapse and absence of grassroots political power and government armed forces in some areas, a large number of local armed forces have swarmed up, occupying hilltops, building fortified villages, raising private soldiers, recruiting unruly people, forming gangs, bullying men and dominating women, burning, killing, and looting. Some usurping Ming gentry, united with illegal armed elements, establish networks in the countryside, spread rumors, organize riots, destroy and commit arson, willing to be used by the usurping Ming government to provide strategic coordination for a possible future counterattack by the usurping Ming. Now, these landlord and bandit armed forces have become a tumor under our Australian Song regime that must be removed. Based on this, the Senate has researched and decided to adjust the strategic deployment within Guangdong in the near future, slowing down the pace of expansion to protect the fruits of victory. Maintain a powerful high-pressure posture on key strategic nodes to deter the usurping Ming puppet army, while simultaneously turning the spearhead to strike at internal hostile elements. The Senate proposes the strategic guideline of 'Consolidating the Core, Basing on Key Points.' In key areas away from main traffic lines and towns, relying on the support of core areas, establish several strong important base points. Through establishing base point base areas, radiate outward, giving newly established local governments strong support. And strictly define the area according to the base point base areas, eliminating the passive situation of being attacked front and rear and seeing enemies in every bush. Form a situation of using points to lead lines, lines to lead patches, and patches to lead areas. In the near future, central financial appropriations will be inclined towards military projects in a planned manner. Organization of suppression work will proceed gradually. The key arrangements are as follows..."

The more Xue Tu read, the more alarmed he became. When he turned to the last two pages, he found that the paper changed to Australian paper, the font changed to Imitation Song, and the printing method changed to the Australians' mimeograph. The red seal at the end was also the round seal commonly used by Australians. This could absolutely not be forged. He looked at Wooden Stone with questioning eyes. Wooden Stone nodded and said, "Correct. These two pages are original. Unfortunately, for these two pages of paper, Second Brother Yun's hidden line within the Kun thief government was pulled out. I'm afraid we won't be able to get such secret documents in the future." After speaking, he sighed and shook his head, appearing very regretful. Xue Tu withdrew his gaze, forced himself to calm his mind, and continued reading. The more he read, the more horrified he became. Cold sweat dripped continuously from his forehead. His hands trembled gently, drops of sweat falling onto the paper. The paper rustled with the trembling of his hands. When he saw the column "Great social harm, key strike targets, list of representative bandit leaders, feudal Daoist sect heads," he saw his name impressively listed. Xue Tu's heart couldn't help but skip a beat. He forced down the uneasiness in his heart, steadied his mind, put down the document, and said, "The Kun thieves have harbored rebellious hearts for a long time. Since I am enemies with the Kun thieves, this matter was long within Xue's expectations. It is nothing."

Wooden Stone smiled again and said, "Brother Xue presumably still harbors a shred of extravagant hope, vainly attempting to preserve his life and family property. But you do not know that submitting to the Imperial Court is fine, but if you submit to the Kun thieves, then your death date will arrive immediately!"

Hearing this, Xue Tu raised his head abruptly, staring straight at Wooden Stone, and said, "I still hope the Daoist will teach me."

Wooden Stone Daoist said, "You see Liu Xiang submitting to the Kun; did he have a good end? Originally he commanded hundreds of responses with a single call. Now he lives under another's roof, scolded at will by others. His foundation is at sea, not on land. Now the Australians have taken his ships, scattered his people, and completely incorporated them into the shipping company. He barely preserved the status of a rich man, yet he still has to suffer the Australians' day and night surveillance, daring not to move rashly. The Australians also absolutely do not entrust him with external assignments, only confining him in the one-acre three-cents land of Lingao, sitting dryly looking at the four-sided sky. This is still a regional powerful man who held tens of thousands of people and ships in his hands. If Brother Xue wants to submit to the Kun, even if you collect these few Daoist sects, is your power that great? Do you have that capital to bargain with the Kun thieves?"

Wooden Stone Daoist added, "Liu Xiang can more or less still share a dry stock in the shipping company, counting as having something to rely on. He also has some maritime trade routes and can serve as a counselor for the Kun people. The Kun people arrived floating on the sea; they value this kind of person most. Liu Xiang also understands the times, so he was preserved. Brother Xue, do not think that because you call yourself king and tyrant on these three mountains and five strongholds, you can forget yourself in satisfaction. Brother Xue still needs to look clearly at yourself. Weigh yourself; do you have the weight of Liu Xiang? If you submit to the Kun, what can you get? This poor Daoist observes Brother Xue's past conduct and knows Brother Xue is a man of lofty aspirations, never willing to be under others. Submitting to the Kun is not to preserve personal safety, but to bring honor to your wife and shade to your children. But what talent does Brother Xue have that the Kun people value? In the final analysis, what you are good at is nothing more than using Daoist magic and divine powers to fool ignorant rural people, coercing them for your own use. What is this called? With the Kun thieves, this is called organizing feudal superstition activities; it is a factor of social instability. Keeping it is only a scourge, of no benefit. You can neither be an official nor a general. Speaking of closeness and distance, compared to the officials and clerks examined and taught by the Kun people themselves, the difference is like clouds and mud. Brother Xue is worthless in the eyes of the Kun thieves. Initially, they might rope you in slightly, but over time, if Brother Xue makes the slightest move, it will immediately be a disaster of killing the body!"

Xue Tu frowned tightly, listening numbly, speaking no more. His face hardened into a block, only his expression changing between green and white.

Yun Ting interjected from the side at this time: "Worthy Brother Xue is not an ordinary mortal. Since entering the *jianghu*, you have harbored lofty ambitions. It is said that the old Marshal did not intend to pass this Heavenly Soldier Daoist Spirit Society to Worthy Brother Xue back then. Worthy Brother Xue fought for it with his own ability. If Worthy Brother Xue were truly modest and polite, the one sitting here today would be the old Marshal who was still healthy and in his prime a few years ago. How would it be Worthy Brother Xue's turn? With this competitive and aggressive nature of Worthy Brother Xue, under the hands of the Kun people, you will inevitably have a hard time getting a good death."

Xue Tu suddenly raised his eyes, staring dead at Yun Ting, and said, "What did you say?"

Yun Ting did not dodge, sneered, stared back at Xue Tu, and said, "Walls have eyes, partitions have ears. Each person knows clearly in their heart what they have done. It's just that everyone pretends not to know. Don't make it so we have to speak openly."

Xue Tu's breathing gradually became rapid. His hands slowly clenched into fists, and his face also turned cold.

Yun Ting spoke to him no more. He only took out two more items from his bosom, threw them on the table with a *snap*, and said indifferently, "Worthy Brother Xue, take a look and see if you recognize these items?"

Xue Tu picked up the items on the table. Looking closely, it was as if he had been struck by lightning. His heart was completely cold. Of those two items, one was a Daoist Spirit Society name card and divine talisman, and the other was an Australian work ID. Both items were stained with dried black-purple bloodstains. Xue Tu remembered sending close disciples to contact the Australians that day, but they went and never returned. This matter had always been a sickness in Xue Tu's heart, never dared to be spoken to anyone. It only tortured him every late night when all was quiet, making him unable to sleep, thinking wildly all day. He hadn't expected to see them here today. His face was immediately full of uncertainty. His eyes turned, but he found that not a single one of the trusted aides he had arranged was by his side.

Seeing this, Yun Ting sneered secretly to himself and said, "Worthy Brother Xue need not worry. This matter is already finished, only rotting in the bellies of us three. Worthy Brother Xue should not harbor other thoughts. Young Master Liang and I have planned for several years, inquiring openly and secretly. We probed and learned that Worthy Brother Xue's past anti-Kun and killing thieves activities, assassination of various village liaisons, robbing the Reasonable Burden, and other matters have long been known to the Kun people. The Kun people's factories and guards have collected a mountain of brother Xue's crimes. Words like 'not killing is insufficient to appease public anger' have leaked out. With such deep hatred, could it be that Worthy Brother Xue still expects the Kun thieves to dissolve previous ill will? That is truly too naive. Moreover, this time the Kun people failed to recruit. Given the Kun thieves' disposition, they will inevitably suppress painfully in a few days. Worthy Brother Xue must set your mind. Now there is only this one retreat path. Do not mistake yourself again. Worse than straddling two boats is not being able to stay on even one boat."

After Wooden Stone Daoist finished speaking, he took out a letter from his bosom and said solemnly, "Brother Xue, this poor Daoist has here a recommendation letter personally written by Governor Xiong. It promises that Brother Xue can be substantively appointed as a guerrilla general at the very least. If military merit is established, being given a lieutenant colonelcy is not impossible. It is also promised that if Guangzhou Prefecture is recovered in the future, Brother Xue need not leave his native land and can lead troops to guard it himself. Brother Xue, merit, fame, and wealth are within easy reach. What you want, the Kun people will not give, and cannot give. Only the Imperial Court can give us what we want. If Brother Xue insists on walking that wrong path and turning his face, I'm afraid it will hurt our harmony. Do you think Second Brother Yun and I are people who don't leave a backup move? This letter is absolutely not a forgery. It has Governor Xiong's official seal on the back. Brother Xue can examine it carefully." After speaking, he handed over the letter.

Xue Tu took the letter with both hands. He read it silently for a long time. Finally, he let out a long sigh. As if his tendons and bones had been removed, he slowly collapsed into the round-backed armchair. He stared blankly for a long while, then suddenly pushed the armrests with both hands, stood up, and shouted loudly, "Since it is so, that man surnamed Li absolutely cannot be kept. Men!"

As soon as his voice fell, a big man pushed open the door and entered, clasping his hands to listen to the order. Xue Tu said, "Pick a few dozen hard hands. Immediately go chase that Li Jian and Li Baiqing of Old Li Village. You must take the heads of that uncle and nephew. Go and return quickly!"

Yun Ting said from the side, "Little brother is untalented but had some foresight, thinking ahead of Worthy Brother Xue. I have already sent more than ten people to chase and kill first. It is better if Brother Xue is willing to send more people to assist. You and I combine forces; we must make it so that Li Jian cannot escape justice."

Xue Tu turned his head and glanced at Yun Ting, nodded, the expression in his eyes extremely complex.

Wooden Stone Daoist and Yun Ting looked at each other, knowing in their hearts that the last nail had finally been driven down.
