# Chapter 2493: Burning the Building (Part 6)

Zhao Manxiong asked: "Are there any new reports on the situation of the Master Stone Group?"

"There are some," Wu Mu said. "I will report to you separately in a while."

"Thank you," Zhao Manxiong said. "Please continue."

That person asked again: "If there really is an armed gang, the nature of the matter changes. We should eliminate the threat as soon as possible. If there is no evidence, we can send someone to infiltrate the Liang residence for a 'Black Bag Job' to save time collecting evidence and quickly arrest Liang Cunhou, breaking the situation directly through key figures, then use follow-up evidence to corroborate his crimes."

Just as Wu Mu was about to speak, Zhao Manxiong took over the conversation directly and said: "Do you mean framing and planting evidence?"

The participant opened his mouth but couldn't speak.

Zhao Manxiong nodded and said: "Everyone has their own views. Bring them up; I think it is a good thing. Doing things should be like this—speak freely, discuss whether it works or not later. But here, I do not agree..." He glanced at Wu Mu, and Wu Mu hurriedly said:

"This is the Section Chief of the Second Section of the Guangzhou Branch Bureau."

Hearing this, the Section Chief of the Second Section immediately stood up.

Zhao Manxiong signaled him to sit down and said: "I do not agree with this approach. Here I want to say a few more words about why I disagree."

As he spoke, he scrutinized the naturalized citizen commanders present. They were all very young, generally under thirty, mostly wearing epaulets of Level 1 and Level 2 Commanders. One or two had even put on the rank of Regional Deputy Commander. Most of these people had joined the Political Security Bureau since its inception, and some were recently recruited graduates from schools. They could be counted as elite soldiers and capable generals in the Senate's political security system.

Precisely for this reason, he felt it necessary to say more.

"Our Political Security Bureau is a violent organ. Because of the special nature of our work, the Senate has granted us many powers. But we are also a law enforcement agency with strict discipline and must follow the law. We know someone is dangerous; we can control him secretly to reduce danger. This may consume a lot of material and manpower and delay a lot of time, but should we break the rules we set ourselves because of this? Remember, our mission is to ensure internal security and maintain the dignity of the law, which means we have to face our own people. If we rely on framing and planting evidence to obtain the legitimacy of law enforcement, what is the difference between us and the Eastern Depot or the Brocade Guard (Jinyiwei)? Where is our foundation for law enforcement? Not to mention that when the Eastern Depot and Brocade Guard arrested criminals, they also had to get arrest warrants issued by the Ministry of Justice before they could act. This rule was not completely destroyed until the Wei Zhongxian era. I believe everyone has seen what happened to the Ming Kingdom that wantonly destroyed rules."

He slowed his tone as he spoke: "shortcuts are always easy. Once accustomed to simple methods, they often become precedents. If we rely on such means for detection in the initial stage, what about five years later? Ten years later? After the formal founding of the nation? What kind of institution will we degenerate into? A demon that turns pale at the mention of it, relying on unscrupulous means to pry into secrets and fabricate false cases? I don't know what the Political Security Bureau will become in fifty years, but in the hands of Director Wu and me, I hope it can retain a bottom line. Black Bag Jobs like various thefts, kidnappings, assassinations, and honey traps must be used with extreme caution. They cannot be implemented without my approval. I want to see this case in the Political Security Bureau's training materials ten years later, not lying in a black file in some unknown reference room, never seeing the light of day." After finishing, he waved his hand at Wu Mu, signaling to continue.

Wu Mu continued: "Through the above behaviors, we can see that they have been engaged in activities to subvert the Senate's regime secretly. However, they themselves do not possess such impactful destructive power, so they can only collude with external forces. According to the briefing from the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, the Ming Kingdom is preparing for a large military operation against Guangdong. Once the offensive is launched, it will be the opportunity for these anti-Song forces to erupt. On one hand, they pretend to be polite and compliant with us; on the other hand, they prepare behind the scenes. When the war breaks out, these people will coordinate with the usurping Ming army, leading the way for them, providing intelligence, launching various attacks in cities and countryside, carrying out sabotage operational activities, and organizing rebellious riots, creating a rear area full of beacon fires for us. I have to say, this Liang Cunhou did a good job. He almost exerted his personal ability to the limit. But even if he accomplished everything he wanted to do, it would not affect our overall situation, though it might bring us no small trouble and loss. Regrettably, he was exposed too early. His layout is obviously far from complete. This allows us to nip the hidden danger in the bud. And he is destined to act finished." After finishing, Wu Mu threw the chalk in his hand into the wastebasket next to him with a *pah* sound, then clapped the chalk dust off his hands, kicking up a cloud of dust.

Zhao Manxiong looked silently at the document in his hand. There were as many as seventeen gentry families involved in the Liang case, many of which were aristocratic families with multi-generational heritage. It could be imagined that once the curtain was lifted, the shock brought to Guangzhou would be no less than a magnitude 8 earthquake, far exceeding the Witchcraft Murder Case.

He exhaled gently, his gaze moving to the header of the document, where a line of large characters was printed: "Operation Code: Harvest."

"Harvest"—what a beautiful word. Golden rice fields, dark-skinned farmers stroking full rice ears and smiling...

But words appearing on the bureau's documents, no matter how beautiful, would only leave a cruel feeling. Who knew how many people would lose their lives and how many people's lives would change forever with the conclusion of this case.

Zhao Manxiong looked at the distant sky. Dark clouds were dense; it was going to rain in Guangzhou again.

The evening sky was gloomy and deep. Gathered dark clouds poured fine rain threads onto the human world, covering the empty Liang residence with a layer of sparse coldness and desolation.

Liang Cunhou sat alone in the Qiyu Pavilion (Perching Rain Pavilion). In the center of the round stone table in front of him were four small dishes of side dishes, a white glazed holding pot, and a wine cup in front of him. A cup was placed upside down on a tray to the side, and a Sichuan fan lay beside the table. He slowly lifted up the holding pot. The wine poured into the cup in front of him like a stream. Liang Cunhou picked up the wine cup, rubbed and rotated it gently on his fingertips, then drank it all in one gulp violently. There was no sweet aftertaste in his mouth, only full bitterness.

Behind him came Liang Yuanfu's low voice: "Eldest Master. The Old Master, Old Mistress, and Mistress in the countryside sent someone to pass a message, saying they are settled in the countryside. The family members are all safe; everything is going well, without any inconvenience. The local Australians also make no trouble. They also said specifically for the Eldest Master to take care of his health, think broadly about everything; there are always ways to resolve things. Even if we can't go on in the city, the family can calculate days by farming and reading in the countryside, worshipping ancestors and teaching grandsons, and can always get by. There are no other instructions." Pausing slightly, he hesitated and said again: "Miss Yue Wan has been here for a long time, saying she wants to kowtow to the Eldest Master. Does the Eldest Master want to see her? It's just that she is a mistress kept outside; without summons, she cannot come to the door. I fear it doesn't conform to the residence rules..."

Liang Cunhou shook his head slightly and said: "Call her in. Rules? There are no rules anymore. The rites and music in this place are ruined, let alone within a family."

"Yes."

Just as Liang Yuanfu was about to withdraw, Liang Cunhou suddenly asked: "Is your mother's malaria better?"

Liang Yuanfu was stunned and hurriedly said: "Last time I got Australian medicine from Yu the Third. It worked after taking it."

"Back then, Second Uncle had this disease and also begged for special medicine from the Australians, which resolved the water and fire crisis. Speaking of which, the Australians are not entirely useless."

Liang Yuanfu sweated slightly on his back, bowed, and responded: "Yes."

Liang Cunhou didn't continue but said: "You go."

Looking at the receding figure of the inner residence steward, he hooked his finger gently. A middle-aged maid appeared from behind the curtain.

"From today on, Liang Yuanfu is not allowed to enter this courtyard again."

After a long while, Yue Wan, holding an oil-paper umbrella in her plain hand and shrouded in the rain curtain, walked slowly following the guide maid, like a court lady walking out of a painting. With lightly swept moth eyebrows, elegant makeup, beautiful dress, and graceful figure, she moved her lotus steps lightly into the long corridor, like a wind-blown spring willow swaying between wind and rain.

Walking outside the Qiyu Pavilion, she saw Liang Cunhou sitting quietly in the pavilion, his back looking lonely and desolate. Yue Wan walked silently into the pavilion and curtsied behind him. Standing for a moment, she reached out her hand, stroked Liang Cunhou's shoulder gently, and said softly: "Young Master, Wan'er is here." looking behind him, she added: "Young Master, your hair bun is loose. The maids are so careless on duty! I will re-braid it for the Young Master." Saying this, she took off the headscarf for Liang Cunhou, loosened his hair bun, took out a wooden comb, and gently combed Liang Cunhou's long black hair, murmuring in her mouth: "First combing for a harmonious union of a hundred years; second combing for a hall full of children and grandchildren; third combing for growing old together with white heads; fourth combing for hearts united forever. When mother married, grandmother combed her hair like this. Only now, no one combs my hair for me anymore."

Liang Cunhou did not turn his head but gently held Yue Wan's right hand holding the comb with his hand, stroking it gently. The two leaned against each other silently like this, feeling the unspoken tenderness.

After quite a while, Liang Cunhou slowly said: "Gone, all gone. Gone is good; gone is clean."

After a pause, he muttered to himself again: "But, can one get away?"

Liang Cunhou squeezed Yue Wan's hand tightly and said: "Wan'er, aren't you leaving?"

Yue Wan chuckled lightly and said: "If I wanted to leave, why would I come? I am the vine wrapping around the tree, the water winding around the mountain. Since meeting the Young Master, my life's destination has been tied to the Young Master alone. Where the Young Master is, is my resting place. They left; I will walk this journey hand in hand with the Young Master."

Liang Cunhou couldn't help smiling and said: "Aren't you going to persuade me?"

Yue Wan said: "Persuade what? The Young Master already has a definite number in his heart. The wise do not speak; the knowing remain silent. No need to persuade, and cannot persuade."

Liang Cunhou looked up and laughed loudly: "Good! The one who knows me is Wan'er. Those are the very words. Since things have come to this, there is no need to make that young son and daughter attitude. One should reflect a loyal heart with faint jade blood, only generously going to justice."
