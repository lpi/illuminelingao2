# Chapter 2493: Burning the Building (Part 6)

Zhao Manxiong asked, "Any new reports on the Master Stone Group?"

"Some," Wu Mu said. "I'll report to you separately afterward."

"Thank you. Please continue."

The same participant spoke again: "If there really is an armed gang, the nature of this matter changes. We should eliminate the threat immediately. If we lack evidence, we could send someone to infiltrate the Liang residence for a 'black bag job'—save time on evidence collection, arrest Liang Cunhou quickly, break the situation through the key figure, then use follow-up evidence to corroborate his crimes."

As Wu Mu opened his mouth to reply, Zhao Manxiong cut in directly: "Are you suggesting we frame him and plant evidence?"

The participant's mouth opened, but no words came out.

Zhao Manxiong nodded. "Everyone has their own views. Bring them forward—I think that's a good thing. This is how work should be: speak freely, debate whether it works afterward. But here, I disagree..." He glanced at Wu Mu, who quickly supplied:

"This is the Section Chief of the Second Section, Guangzhou Branch Bureau."

The Section Chief immediately stood up.

Zhao Manxiong gestured for him to sit. "I disagree with this approach. Let me explain why."

As he spoke, he studied the naturalized citizen commanders present. They were all young—generally under thirty—mostly wearing Level 1 and Level 2 Commander epaulets. One or two had even achieved Regional Deputy Commander rank. Most had joined the Political Security Bureau at its founding; some were recent graduates. They represented the elite of the Senate's political security system.

Precisely for this reason, he felt compelled to say more.

"The Political Security Bureau is a violent organ. Because of our special work, the Senate has granted us extensive powers. But we're also a law enforcement agency with strict discipline—we must follow the law. We know someone is dangerous; we can control them secretly to reduce that danger. This may consume substantial resources and delay considerable time, but should we break our own rules because of that? Remember, our mission is ensuring internal security and upholding the dignity of the law—which means we face our own people. If we rely on framing and planting evidence to legitimize enforcement, how are we different from the Eastern Depot or the Brocade Guard? Where is our foundation for law enforcement? Not to mention that when the Eastern Depot and Brocade Guard arrested criminals, even they required warrants from the Ministry of Justice before acting. That rule wasn't completely destroyed until the Wei Zhongxian era. I believe everyone has seen what happened to the Ming Kingdom when it wantonly destroyed its own rules."

He slowed his tone. "Shortcuts are always tempting. Once accustomed to simple methods, they become precedents. If we rely on such means for detection now, what about five years later? Ten years later? After formal founding? What kind of institution will we degenerate into? A demon that makes people pale at its very mention, relying on unscrupulous means to pry into secrets and fabricate false cases? I don't know what the Political Security Bureau will become in fifty years, but in Director Wu's hands and mine, I hope we can retain a bottom line. Black bag operations—thefts, kidnappings, assassinations, honey traps—must be used with extreme caution. None can be implemented without my approval. I want to see this case in our training materials ten years from now, not buried in some unknown reference room, never seeing the light of day." He waved at Wu Mu to continue.

Wu Mu resumed: "Through their activities, we can see they've been working to subvert the Senate's regime. However, they lack sufficient destructive power on their own, so they must collude with external forces. According to the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, the Ming Kingdom is preparing a major military operation against Guangdong. Once launched, that will be the moment for these anti-Song forces to erupt. On one hand, they play polite and compliant with us; on the other, they prepare in secret. When war breaks out, they'll coordinate with the Ming army—guiding them, providing intelligence, launching attacks in cities and countryside, carrying out sabotage, organizing rebellions—creating a rear area consumed by fires of chaos. I must admit, Liang Cunhou has done impressive work. He's pushed his personal abilities nearly to their limit. But even if he accomplished everything he intended, it wouldn't affect our overall situation—though it might cause us considerable trouble and loss. Regrettably for him, he was exposed too early. His preparations are obviously far from complete, allowing us to nip this threat in the bud. And he is destined to fail." Wu Mu tossed the chalk into the wastebasket with a sharp *pah*, then clapped the dust from his hands, sending up a small cloud.

Zhao Manxiong studied the document silently. Seventeen gentry families were implicated in the Liang case—many aristocratic houses with multi-generational heritage. When the curtain rose on this affair, the shock to Guangzhou would rival a magnitude 8 earthquake, far exceeding the Witchcraft Murder Case.

He exhaled gently. His gaze moved to the document header, where a line of large characters was printed: "Operation Code: Harvest."

*Harvest*—what a beautiful word. Golden rice fields, dark-skinned farmers smiling as they stroked full ears of grain...

But words appearing on Bureau documents, no matter how beautiful, left only a cruel feeling. Who knew how many would lose their lives, how many lives would be forever changed by this case's conclusion.

Zhao Manxiong gazed at the distant sky. Dark clouds gathered thickly. Rain was coming to Guangzhou again.

***

The evening sky hung gloomy and deep. Gathered clouds poured fine threads of rain onto the human world, draping the empty Liang residence in sparse coldness and desolation.

Liang Cunhou sat alone in the Qiyu Pavilion. Before him on the round stone table rested four small dishes of side dishes, a white-glazed pot, and a wine cup. An upturned cup sat on a tray to the side, and a Sichuan fan lay by the table. He slowly lifted the pot. Wine streamed into his cup. He picked it up, gently rotating it between his fingertips, then drained it violently in one gulp. No sweet aftertaste lingered in his mouth—only bitterness.

Behind him came Liang Yuanfu's low voice: "Eldest Master. The Old Master, Old Mistress, and Mistress in the countryside sent word. They're settled safely. The family is well, everything proceeding smoothly, without inconvenience. The local Australians are making no trouble. They specifically said the Eldest Master should take care of his health, think broadly about everything—there are always ways to resolve things. Even if we can't continue in the city, the family can live by farming and reading in the countryside, worshipping ancestors and teaching grandchildren. We can always get by. No other instructions." He paused, hesitating. "Miss Yue Wan has been here for some time, asking to pay respects to the Eldest Master. Does the Eldest Master wish to see her? It's just that she's a mistress kept outside—without summons, she cannot come to the door. I fear it doesn't conform to residence rules..."

Liang Cunhou shook his head slightly. "Show her in. Rules? There are no rules anymore. Rites and music are ruined in this land, let alone within a single household."

"Yes."

As Liang Yuanfu turned to withdraw, Liang Cunhou suddenly asked: "Is your mother's malaria better?"

Liang Yuanfu started, then hurried to reply: "Last time I obtained Australian medicine through Yu the Third. It worked after taking it."

"Years ago, Second Uncle had the same illness and also begged for Australian medicine, which resolved the crisis. Speaking of which, the Australians aren't entirely without merit."

Sweat beaded on Liang Yuanfu's back. He bowed. "Yes."

Liang Cunhou said nothing more. "You may go."

Watching the steward's retreating figure, he hooked a finger gently. A middle-aged maid appeared from behind the curtain.

"From today on, Liang Yuanfu is not to enter this courtyard again."

After a long while, Yue Wan appeared, holding an oil-paper umbrella and shrouded in the rain curtain, walking slowly behind her guide like a court lady stepping from a painting. Her moth eyebrows were lightly swept, her makeup elegant, her dress beautiful, her figure graceful. She moved her lotus steps into the long corridor, swaying between wind and rain like a spring willow.

Outside the Qiyu Pavilion, she saw Liang Cunhou sitting quietly, his back lonely and desolate. Yue Wan walked silently into the pavilion and curtsied behind him. Standing for a moment, she reached out and gently stroked his shoulder. "Young Master, Wan'er is here." Glancing behind him, she added: "Young Master, your hair bun is loose. The maids are so careless on duty! Let me re-braid it for you." She removed his headscarf, loosened his hair bun, produced a wooden comb, and began gently combing his long black hair, murmuring softly: "First combing for a harmonious union of a hundred years; second combing for a hall full of children and grandchildren; third combing for growing old together with white heads; fourth combing for hearts united forever. This is how grandmother combed mother's hair when she married. Only now, no one combs my hair for me anymore."

Liang Cunhou didn't turn his head but gently took her right hand—the one holding the comb—and stroked it softly. The two leaned against each other in silence, feeling the unspoken tenderness.

After quite a while, Liang Cunhou spoke slowly: "Gone. All gone. Gone is good; gone is clean."

After a pause, he muttered again: "But can one truly get away?"

He squeezed Yue Wan's hand tightly. "Wan'er, aren't you leaving?"

Yue Wan laughed lightly. "If I wanted to leave, why would I have come? I'm the vine wrapping around the tree, the water winding around the mountain. Since meeting the Young Master, my life's destination has been tied to him alone. Where the Young Master is, there is my resting place. They left; I will walk this path hand in hand with you."

Liang Cunhou couldn't help smiling. "Aren't you going to persuade me?"

Yue Wan said: "Persuade what? The Young Master already has certainty in his heart. The wise need no words; the knowing remain silent. No need to persuade, and impossible to persuade."

Liang Cunhou raised his head and laughed loudly: "Good! The one who knows me is Wan'er. Those are the very words. Since things have come to this, there's no need for youthful sentiment. One should reflect a loyal heart with blood as jade, and generously embrace righteousness."
