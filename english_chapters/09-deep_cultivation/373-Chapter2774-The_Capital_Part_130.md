# Chapter 2774: The Capital (Part 130)

Considered from this angle, the scheme seemed plausible. Wang Yehao still did not fully understand why Zhou Lezhi was so fixated on opening the port, though it presumably connected to "handling Kun Affairs." Zhou Lezhi's prediction was that in the future Imperial Court, ministers who understood the Kun situation and could manage Kun affairs would become highly sought after. Anyone who could seize the initiative in this domain would find their prospects limitless.

Wang Yehao remained skeptical. He had asked Zhou Lezhi several times whether this was written in the Book from Heaven, but Zhou Lezhi would only vaguely attribute the idea to his master's opinion.

Since it was not explicitly stated in the Book from Heaven, one could hardly call it inevitable. Yet the Book from Heaven had been written by Zhou Lezhi's master personally.

This logical puzzle left Wang Yehao thoroughly stumped; he could only maintain a stance of half-belief and half-doubt.

Still, he trusted the gentleman's powers of prediction. Despite his reservations, he had made corresponding preparations according to Zhou Lezhi's instructions. The first step was to gather impoverished disciples from his own clan and those of related families in his hometown of Jinhua to study Kun texts. Fortunately, Hangzhou was close at hand. Every book related to Kun Learning available at Wanbi Bookshop had been collected for the family school, where the disciples engaged in "self-study."

Speaking of which, the Kun were remarkably accommodating, as if they had anticipated that someone would want to teach themselves. Wanbi Bookshop actually carried a "Self-Study Series"—a set of several dozen volumes covering everything from astronomy to geography, mathematics, physics, various crafts, and agriculture. The books were not only illustrated but also written in accessible language. Even Wang Yehao had clicked his tongue in wonder after perusing them.

As for the results of this self-study, Wang Yehao could guess them well enough without looking—after all, the disciples did not even have a teacher. Fortunately, Zhou Lezhi had assured him that when Kun affairs first came under imperial management, there would inevitably be a chaotic mix of the competent and incompetent, with talents who understood Kun matters in short supply everywhere. Even those who had merely "self-studied" could still muddle their way into a position when the time came.

"Master said there is a process from quantitative change to qualitative change. As long as the numbers are large enough, a few genuine talents will always emerge."

These words seemed reasonable enough. Fortunately, the Wang family had money now. Though their various conspiracies consumed enormous sums, supporting a hundred or so disciples in comfortable idleness was a trivial expense. What if Zhou Lezhi's predictions proved correct?

"Now that you mention it, this does seem possible." Wang Yehao hesitated. "It's just that Wucheng is currently preoccupied with dealing with the Restoration Society. He probably has no interest in the matter of opening a port."

"We can only discuss it after Wucheng leaves the premiership in June," Zhou Lezhi said. "This also leaves room for Master to operate."

Once Wen Tiren left office, many initiatives he had promoted would likely be abandoned halfway. Better to wait until Zhang Zhifa assumed the position of Senior Grand Secretary before making plans.

"The most urgent task right now is stirring up public opinion for conquering the Kun." Wang Yehao laughed. "The more fiercely this wind blows at court, the more the Jiangnan gentry will support opening the port. Hahaha..."

Zhou Lezhi smiled knowingly. "Master speaks correctly."

Wang Yehao returned to his residence and immediately summoned Jin Wenchi to the study.

Compared to the Kun and Wen Tiren, he had a more pressing matter to address—one that concerned the future of both himself and his entire inner circle.

Jin Wenchi arrived at the study, but Wang Yehao found himself at a loss for how to begin. After a long pause, he finally spoke: "What does Sir make of the matter in December of this year mentioned in the Book from Heaven?"

This issue had become the paramount concern facing Wang Yehao's faction since the end of last year. When Zhou Lezhi had interpreted the Book from Heaven, he was startled to find his employer's name within its pages: Wang Yehao would be dismissed from the Ministry of War in December of the tenth year of Chongzhen.

Currently, the Ministry of War was effectively being run by Yang Sichang. Master Wang's official position was Right Vice Minister of War; he merely held a nominal title of Minister of War. But the matter of dismissal from office to live in idleness was written there in plain terms.

The reason for dismissal was that Chen Qixin, the Supervising Secretary of the Office of Scrutiny for Personnel, would report him and the Minister of Rites Jiang Fengyuan for recommending too many people indiscriminately during the selection of Hanlin and Censors. This impeachment would implicate Minister of Rites Jiang Fengyuan, Wang Yehao, Supervising Secretary Fu Yuanchu, Censor Yu Haoshan, and others—six people in total—who would be sent home to live in idleness. Supervising Secretary Sun Jin, Censor Li Youdang, and others—three people in total—would be demoted and transferred. Supervising Secretary Liu Hanhui, Censor Liu Xingxiu, and others—eleven people in total—would be demoted two ranks while remaining in their posts.

Beyond this, there was not another word. It was said that no further records of Master Wang appeared in the Book from Heaven after this event.

Whether it was the person involved or Zhou Lezhi, neither was willing to let his official career end here. Master Wang currently held the title of Minister of War and had served in important positions for many years. Whether in the capital or in the provinces, he possessed substantial political resources at his disposal. If he were dismissed to live in idleness, his influence would diminish considerably, and he would be reduced to playing the tyrant only within his home province—never mind plotting the "Great Cause."

Therefore, the dismissal at year's end had to be avoided by some means.

According to Jin Wenchi's thinking, since they knew the reason for dismissal, they simply needed to refrain from participating in this matter, or recommend fewer people.

Wang Yehao was a veteran bureaucrat and understood that matters were not so simple. In any bureaucratic storm, the dismissal of officials always had deeper underlying causes. Truth be told, the Ministry of War had achieved nothing noteworthy in recent years, and it was natural for the Emperor to be dissatisfied with him. Chen Qixin's impeachment was merely a pretext. One could hide from the first day of the month, but not the fifteenth.

"...This Chen Qixin is a villain who advanced through luck. He is nothing but a military graduate. Relying on a single memorial about the 'Three Major Root Diseases,' his words struck a chord, and he was immediately elevated to a noble position. Who would have expected he still had this trick up his sleeve!"

In the Ming and Qing dynasties, holders of military degrees were generally looked down upon, let alone someone like Chen Qixin, who was merely a military graduate of the third degree from Huai'an Guard. Because of one memorial, he had gained the Emperor's favor and been promoted to an important position like Supervising Secretary. Most ministers at court disapproved, viewing him as an opportunist. Wang Yehao shared this perception.

"Master means..."

"I cannot remain in this Ministry of War any longer." Wang Yehao pondered aloud. To avoid the fate of being dismissed to live in idleness, the only recourse was to seek a transfer as soon as possible. Not only was the Ministry of War currently plagued with troubles and prone to mistakes, but Yang Sichang—the Emperor's current favorite—had also arrived. If he lingered any longer, sooner or later he would be dismissed for some other reason.

"Master wishes to seek a transfer?" Zhou Lezhi asked.

"It's just that I haven't yet decided where to go. Can Sir help me devise a plan?"

"Regarding this matter, it would be more appropriate for Mr. Jinshi to plan for Master. However, in this student's humble opinion, the Six Ministries in the capital are not places for a long stay at present. If stability is the goal, the options are either to transfer to a sinecure or minor office in Nanjing, or to transfer to serve as a local Governor-General or Governor."

There were also sinecures and minor offices in the Capital, but the ranks of their chiefs were mostly too low to accommodate an official of the Primary Second Rank like himself.

If he did not seek advancement and only wanted to maintain his official position, the Six Ministries in Nanjing would be an excellent choice. The problem was that going there meant holding a mere sinecure—not much different from living in idleness.

"My intention is to transfer to serve as a local Governor-General or Governor. It's just that these positions are also difficult to hold!" Wang Yehao sighed.

By the tenth year of Chongzhen, the Great Ming had a total of ten Governor-General vacancies and thirty-three Governor vacancies. Among them, the Governors of Guangdong and Guangxi had not been appointed because both provinces had fallen; their duties were being performed by Xiong Wencan, the Governor-General of Liangguang.

Governor-Generals and Governors in the Ming Dynasty differed from their Qing Dynasty counterparts; their military responsibilities far outweighed their civil duties. These positions were often specially established in critical locations, areas with urgent military situations, or regions with turbulent public sentiment.

Among these forty-odd vacancies, only a handful of places—such as Southern Zhili, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, and Shanxi—could be called roughly stable. The remaining Governor-Generals and Governors either suffered from roving bandits or were troubled by barbarians; all were exhausted from constantly fighting for survival. Not only would the Court rage furiously if they lost a battle, but they might also perish on the battlefield themselves.

Places too far inland were not worth going to even if they were peaceful. The Wang Yehao faction now spanned both the Northern and Southern Capitals and had established arrangements in Northern Zhili, Southern Zhili, and Guangdong. If Master Wang's new posting were too remote and transportation inconvenient, it would become exceedingly difficult to coordinate their operations.

"...Among these places, Zhejiang is Master's native province, and many people are seeking Southern Zhili. Why doesn't Master consider Fujian?" Jin Wenchi suggested.

Fujian was quite stable. After Zheng Zhilong had swept away the maritime heroes, and subsequently the Kun had defeated Zheng Zhilong, the coast of Fujian had been peaceful. Only some mountain bandits and refugees occasionally stirred up trouble in the mountains, but none had grown into a significant threat. Because the province was almost entirely mountains and rivers with very little fertile land, its population was not large, and it was not a major transportation thoroughfare. In strategic terms, it was considered neglected territory.

Fujian had another advantage: the Kun had no interest in seizing it. Back then, after they had annihilated Zheng Zhilong's main force and broken through Anping, they could have occupied Zhongzuo and remained. Instead, they simply "looted greatly and returned." Later, when they attacked and plundered Liangguang, Fujian actually had few troops and horses to spare, yet the Kun only advanced as far as Xianxia Pass. This demonstrated their lack of interest in Fujian. Going to Fujian, though within arm's reach of the Kun, would actually be quite safe.

Currently, Zheng Sen was eager to find a way out. Regardless of whether the planned relocation of his garrison to Shanghai would ultimately succeed, the various branches of the Zheng family were objects that could be utilized.

"Fujian is peaceful, but it is extremely barren. Only the areas of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou enjoy any prosperity," Wang Yehao said, clearly unimpressed with this option. "The aristocratic families in Fujian all engage in maritime trade and now depend on the Kun for their livelihoods. If I went there to serve as Governor, wouldn't I just be inviting rebuffs?"

"Doesn't Master intend to handle Kun affairs? Since that is the goal, naturally the closer to the Kun, the better," Jin Wenchi replied. "When Your Excellency was Governor-General of Liangguang, you dealt with the Kun. These Kun are easy enough to handle, when it comes down to it."

"That is true." Wang Yehao nodded. "The Kun keep their word and are reasonable. If only they would submit to the Imperial Court! Sigh!"

"We can plan it slowly."

"It's just that there are no vacancies in Fujian right now..." Shen Youlong's term had not expired, and he had committed no derelictions of duty.

"What about Shandong?"

"Shandong is out of the question. Sun Yuanhua's domain there is a nest of Kun." Master Wang was already shaking his head. "Although I would be stationed in Jinan, Dengzhou and Laizhou concern Liaodong and are of the utmost strategic importance. I would have to deal with him constantly. If matters came to light in the future, I fear I would not escape implication!"

"Master, Shandong has Sun Yuanhua, who can guarantee peace throughout the entire province. Since the Rebellion of Wuqiao was pacified and Sun Yuanhua was reappointed to Dengzhou and Laizhou, Shandong has been the most stable among all the northern provinces. Whether dealing with local bandits or external roving bandits, as soon as Master Sun's troops from Dengzhou and Laizhou arrive, they are immediately annihilated. If Master goes to Jinan to govern through non-interference, and should the Imperial Court decide to handle Kun affairs, it would also be a favorable position—the one nearest the water gets the first drink."

Hearing this, Wang Yehao was moved. After careful consideration, he said: "Yan Jizu's term in Shandong expires next year."

Jin Wenchi understood the implication at once. "That would work well. Allow this student to devise a careful plan for the Eastern Host."
