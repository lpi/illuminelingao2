# Chapter 2774: The Capital (Part 130)

Thinking about it this way, it seemed possible. Wang Yehao didn't know why Zhou Lezhi was so obsessed with opening the port; presumably, it was related to "handling Kun Affairs." Zhou Lezhi's prediction was that in the future Imperial Court, ministers who understood the Kun situation and handled Kun affairs would become very popular. If one could seize the initiative in this regard, the future would be limitless.

Wang Yehao held a skeptical attitude towards this statement. He asked Zhou Lezhi several times if this was written in the Book from Heaven, but Zhou Lezhi vaguely said this was his master's opinion.

Since it wasn't written in the Book from Heaven, it was hard to say it was something that would inevitably happen; but the Book from Heaven was written by Zhou Lezhi's master personally.

This logical puzzle stumped Wang Yehao; he could only be half-believing and half-doubting.

He still trusted the gentleman's prediction level. Even though he had doubts, he made corresponding preparations according to Zhou Lezhi's instructions. The first thing was to collect many poor disciples of his clan and relatives' clans in his hometown of Jinhua to study Kun books. Fortunately, Hangzhou was close at hand. All books related to Kun Learning in the Wanbi Bookshop were collected into the family school, and the disciples "self-studied."

Speaking of which, the Kun thieves were really understanding, as if they knew someone wanted to self-study. There were actually "Self-Study Series" in the Wanbi Bookshop. A set of dozens of books, ranging from astronomy to geography, mathematics, physics, all kinds of crafts and agriculture... everything was available. Not only were they illustrated, but they were also easy to understand. Wang Yehao also clicked his tongue in wonder after reading them.

As for the results of this self-study, Wang Yehao knew just by thinking about it—after all, the disciples didn't even have a teacher. Fortunately, Zhou Lezhi said that once Kun affairs were handled, in the beginning, there would inevitably be a mix of good and bad, and talents who understood Kun would be lacking everywhere. So even if it was "self-study," one could still fool around for a position at that time.

"Master said, there is a process from quantitative change to qualitative change. As long as the number is large enough, a few talents can always be produced."

These words didn't seem wrong. Fortunately, the Wang family had money now. even though engaging in various conspiracies cost a huge amount, feeding a hundred or so disciples to eat idle meals was a trivial matter. What if it was really as Zhou Lezhi said?

"Now that you say it, it seems possible." Wang Yehao hesitated, "It's just that now Wucheng (Wen Tiren) is thinking about how to deal with the Restoration Society. He probably isn't interested in the matter of opening a port."

"We can only discuss it after Wucheng leaves the premiership in June." Zhou Lezhi said, "This also leaves some room for Master to operate."

Once Wen Tiren left office, many things he promoted would likely be given up halfway. It was better to wait until Zhang Zhifa took over as Senior Grand Secretary to make plans.

"The most urgent thing right now is to stir up public opinion for conquering the Kun." Wang Yehao laughed, "The more fierce this wind in the court is, the more the gentry in Jiangnan will support opening the port, hahaha..."

Zhou Lezhi smiled knowingly: "Master speaks correctly."

Wang Yehao returned to the residence and immediately summoned Jin Wenchi into the study.

Compared to the Kun thieves and Wen Tiren, he had a more important matter to deal with. It concerned the future situation of him and the entire small group.

Jin Wenchi was summoned into the study, but Wang Yehao didn't know how to speak for a while. After a long time, he said: "What does Sir think about the matter in December of this year mentioned in the Book from Heaven?"

This matter had become a major topic facing the Wang Yehao group since the end of last year. When Zhou Lezhi interpreted the Book from Heaven, he saw his employer's name with surprise: Wang Yehao would be dismissed from the Minister of War in December of the tenth year of Chongzhen.

Currently, the Ministry of War was actually being run by Yang Sichang. Master Wang's official position was Right Vice Minister of War, only holding a title of Minister of War. But the matter of being dismissed from office to live in idleness was written clearly.

The reason for dismissal was that Chen Qixin, the Supervising Secretary of the Office of Scrutiny for Personnel, reported him and the Minister of Rites Jiang Fengyuan for recommending too many people indiscriminately during the selection of Hanlin and Censors. This implicated Minister of Rites Jiang Fengyuan, Wang Yehao, Supervising Secretary Fu Yuanchu, Censor Yu Haoshan, and others, six people in total, to live in idleness; Supervising Secretary Sun Jin, Censor Li Youdang, and others, three people in total, were demoted and transferred; Supervising Secretary Liu Hanhui, Censor Liu Xingxiu, and others, eleven people in total, were demoted two ranks to conduct affairs.

Apart from this, there was not another word. It was heard that there were no more records of Master Wang in the Book from Heaven after this.

Whether it was the person involved or Zhou Lezhi, they naturally were unwilling to let the official career end here. Master Wang now held the title of Minister of War and had served in important positions for a long time. Whether in the center or local areas, he had a large amount of political resources to use. If he was dismissed to live in idleness, his influence would be much less than before, and he could only tyrannize in his own province. Not to mention plotting the "Great Cause."

So the dismissal at the end of the year must be avoided by some means.

According to Jin Wenchi's idea, since they knew the reason for dismissal, they just had to not participate in this matter or recommend fewer people.

Wang Yehao was an old bureaucrat and naturally understood that things were not that simple. In any bureaucratic storm, the dismissal of officials had deep-seated reasons. Speaking of which, there had indeed been no achievements to speak of in the Ministry of War in recent years, and it was natural for the Emperor to be dissatisfied with him. Chen Qixin's impeachment was just a pretext. One could hide from the first day but not the fifteenth.

"...This Chen Qixin is a villian who advanced by luck. He is just a military graduate. Relying on a memorial about 'Three Major Root Diseases,' his words hit the mark, and he was immediately placed in a noble position. Unexpectedly, he still has this hand!"

In the Ming and Qing dynasties, military subjects were mostly despised by people, let alone that Chen Qixin was only a military graduate of the third degree in Huai'an Guard. Because of a memorial, he gained the Emperor's favor and was promoted to an important position like Supervising Secretary. Most ministers in the court disapproved, thinking he was an opportunistic person. Wang Yehao also had this perception.

"Master means..."

"I can't stay in this Ministry of War anymore." Wang Yehao pondered. To avoid the fate of being dismissed and living in idleness, the only way was to seek a transfer as soon as possible. Not only were there many troubles and mistakes in the Ministry of War now, but Yang Sichang, the popular person in front of the Emperor, had also come. If he stayed any longer, sooner or later, he would be dismissed for other things.

"Master wants to seek a transfer?" Zhou Lezhi asked.

"Just where to go, I haven't planned yet. Can Sir plan a thing or two for me?"

"Regarding this matter, it is more appropriate for Mr. Jinshi (Jin Wenchi) to plan for Master. However, in this student's humble opinion, the Six Ministries in the center are not places for long stay now. If seeking stability, either transfer to a leisure office or cold yamen in Nanjing, or transfer to be a local Governor-General or Governor."

There were also many leisure offices and cold yamens in the Capital, but the ranks of the chiefs were mostly low and could not accommodate an official of the Primary Second Rank like him.

If he didn't seek advancement and only sought an official position, the Six Ministries in Nanjing would be an excellent place. It was just that going there would be holding a sinecure, not much different from living in idleness.

"My intention is to transfer to be a local Governor-General or Governor. It's just that this local Governor-General or Governor is also hard to serve as!" Wang Yehao sighed.

By the tenth year of Chongzhen, the Great Ming had a total of ten vacancies for Governor-Generals and thirty-three vacancies for Governors. Among them, the Governors of Guangdong and Guangxi were not appointed because the two places had fallen, and they were acted by the Governor-General of Liangguang Xiong Wencan.

Governor-Generals and Governors in the Ming Dynasty were different from the Qing Dynasty; their military color was far greater than civil work. They were often specially set up in critical places, places with urgent military situations, or places with turbulent public sentiment.

In these forty-plus vacancies, only a few places like Southern Zhili, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Shanxi, etc., could be called roughly stable. The rest of the Governor-Generals and Governors either suffered from roving bandits or were troubled by barbarians; all were tired of running for their lives. Not only would the Court be furious if they lost a battle, but they might also die on the battlefield.

Too inland places were not worth going to even if they were peaceful. The Wang Yehao group now spanned the Northern and Southern Capitals and had arrangements in Northern Zhili, Southern Zhili, and Guangdong. If the place where Master Wang took office was too remote and transportation was inconvenient, it would be very difficult to command.

"...Among these places, Zhejiang is originally Master's hometown, and there are many people seeking Southern Zhili. Why doesn't Master seek Fujian?" Jin Wenchi suggested.

Fujian was quite stable. After Zheng Zhilong swept away the heroes, and subsequently the Kun thieves defeated Zheng Zhilong, the coast of Fujian was peaceful. There were only some mountain bandits and refugees occasionally making trouble in the mountains, none of whom became a significant climate. Because the province was almost entirely mountains and rivers, there was very little fertile land, the population was not large, and it was not a transportation thoroughfare, so it belonged to abandoned land in strategy.

Fujian had another advantage, which was that the Kun thieves had no heart to seize it. Back then, after they annihilated Zheng Zhilong's main force and broke Anping, they could have occupied Zhongzuo and stayed. But they just "looted greatly and returned." Later when they attacked and looted Liangguang, Fujian actually didn't have many troops and horses, but they only stopped at Xianxia Pass. This showed that their interest in Fujian was lacking. Going to Fujian, although close to the Kun within a foot, was actually very safe.

Now Zheng Sen was eager to seek a way out. Regardless of whether the planned matter of moving the garrison to Shanghai could succeed in the end, the various branches of the Zheng family were objects that could be utilized.

"Fujian is peaceful, but it is very barren. Only the areas of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou are slightly prosperous." Wang Yehao obviously didn't look up to this place much, "The aristocratic families in Fujian all do maritime trade business and now rely on the breath of the Kun thieves. If I go to be the Governor, wouldn't I be asking for a snub?"

"Isn't Master going to handle Kun affairs? Since you want to handle them, naturally the closer to the Kun thieves, the better." Jin Wenchi said, "When your Excellency was Governor-General of Liangguang, you dealt with the Kun thieves. These Kun thieves are easy to deal with if you say they are easy."

"That is true." Wang Yehao nodded, "The Kun thieves have credit and are reasonable. If only they could obey the Imperial Court! Sigh!"

"Plan it slowly."

"It's just that there are no vacancies in Fujian right now..." Shen Youlong's term had not expired, and there were no derelictions of duty.

"How about Shandong?"

"Shandong is a no-go. Sun Yuanhua's place is a nest of Kun thieves." Master Wang already shook his head, "Although I would stay in Jinan, Dengzhou and Laizhou concern Liaodong and are the most critical. I would have to deal with him all the time. If things come to light in the future, I'm afraid I won't be able to escape involvement!"

"Master, Shandong has Sun Yuanhua, who can insure the peace of the whole province. Since the Rebellion of Wuqiao was pacified and Sun Yuanhua was reappointed to Dengzhou and Laizhou, the situation in Shandong has been the most stable among the northern provinces. Whether it is local banditry or external roving bandits, as soon as Master Sun's troops from Dengzhou and Laizhou arrive, they are immediately annihilated. If Master goes to Jinan to rule by doing nothing (govern by non-interference), if the Imperial Court wants to handle Kun affairs, it is also a favorable position near the water."

Hearing this, Wang Yehao was moved. He thought carefully and said: "Yan Jizu of Shandong will have his term expire next year."

Jin Wenchi understood tacitly and said: "This is also good. Wait for this student to plan carefully for the Eastern Host."
