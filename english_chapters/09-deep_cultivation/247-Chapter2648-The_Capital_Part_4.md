# Chapter 2648: The Capital (Part 4)

"Yes, the brand name is Chen Li Ji," Concubine Tian responded. "His family's medicines are all sold by Changchun Hall on commission."

Since Chen Li Ji entered into a joint venture with the Australians, the shopkeeper had originally wanted to open a branch in the capital to sell various patent medicines. However, the Senate was concerned that Chen Li Ji, being a Guangzhou brand, was quite famous. If the two sides were to go to war in the future, the branch in the capital might be difficult to preserve. Therefore, through the "Five Mountain and Sea Routes" channel of Runshitang, they secretly acquired a small pharmacy in the capital and renamed it Changchun Hall. While continuing to sell traditional herbal slices, it also sold various pills, powders, ointments, and pellets from Chen Li Ji and Runshitang on commission. Within a few years, it had become quite famous in the capital.

Every year during the Dragon Boat Festival, the palace would prepare peace-of-mind medicines to present to the Emperor and the high-ranking consorts of the harem. These were nothing more than cooling medicines like Bezoar Resurrection Pills and Purple Gold Ingots to deal with common summer ailments like heatstroke, colds, and diarrhea. Among them was also the Plague-Repelling Powder supplied by Changchun Hall.

Chongzhen was originally somewhat annoyed that the Hair Rebels' medicine had spread so widely, but then he thought that the Hair Rebels' objects were already everywhere in the capital. from the harem down to the common people, everyone had come into contact with Hair Rebel goods to some extent; these peace-of-mind medicines were nothing in comparison.

Reasoning that books like *Notes on Pacifying the Hairs* and *Guide to Hair Rebel Affairs* all mentioned that the Hair Rebels were "so intelligent they were nearing demonhood" and "omnipotent," he secretly felt regret in his heart. If only these descendants of Hua-Xia who had drifted overseas could have been used by the court from the beginning! What worry would there be about the Roving Bandits not being exterminated or the Eastern Barbarians not being pacified!

"Wang Zunde misled the country!" he muttered, his expression severe, startling Concubine Tian. She didn't know who Wang Zunde was, but causing the Emperor such thunderous rage would definitely lead to no good end.

She dared not say much and only accompanied him silently at the side. After a long while, the Emperor suddenly asked, "Noble Consort, let me ask you: does your father have property in Guangzhou?"

These words were like a thunderbolt from a clear sky. Concubine Tian trembled in her heart. Although her knowledge of her father's property situation was limited, she knew quite a few things about her warm family members doing evil deeds outside relying on the status of "Imperial Father-in-law."

If it were an ordinary matter, the Emperor would just laugh it off if he knew. But with the addition of the word "Guangzhou," it was greatly ominous. It seemed he suspected her father of colluding with the Hair Rebels.

Back then, under someone's instigation, her father had sent family servants to Guangzhou, saying they were going to acquire a property. Later, not only was it not accomplished, but the servants sent there also died inexplicably in Guangzhou. At first, Concubine Tian didn't take it to heart, but she later learned that the property her father coveted actually belonged to the Hair Rebels!

It was said that for this matter, Guangzhou City was once in an uproar. The Tian family spent a lot of effort to smooth things over.

Because of this past event, Concubine Tian was particularly wary of anyone mentioning the relationship between the Tian family and Guangzhou. this matter had passed for several years; why was it suddenly brought up by the Emperor again?

Could it be that Cao Huachun and the others were putting eye drops in for her family? Whether it was her or her father, their relationship with the eunuchs was passable, and the usual courtesies were all observed—there was no animosity between the two sides. Could it be the censors outside?

While speculating on the Emperor's state of mind, she said carefully:

"Your Majesty, this bondservant's maiden family was originally in Shaanxi, and later moved to Yangzhou. Guangzhou is remote, and we have no relatives or friends there. It is beyond our reach; how could we acquire property there?"

Chongzhen did not know that his beloved concubine's maiden family had such a past with the Hair Rebels. His question was originally unintentional, simply wishing to learn more about the Hair Rebels. Concubine Tian was family, and compared to the formal replies between him and his ministers, she would be more candid.

"I see that there are many Australian goods in the Noble Consort's palace, which is why I asked," Chongzhen said. "Although the Hair Rebel goods are mostly strange techniques and excessive ingenuity, there is no lack of items that benefit the country and the people. It is just a pity they cannot be used by the court!" After speaking, he seemed quite regretful.

Concubine Tian looked at Chongzhen's intention and it seemed he did not excessive detest the Hair Rebels. She was extremely intelligent and knew the Emperor probably had thoughts of pacifying and recruiting the Hair Rebels. However, she knew the Emperor's temperament well; such matters could only be proposed by ministers after "speculating" his wishes.

"Your Majesty, please be at ease. No matter how formidable the Hair Rebels are, surely they also have a heart for fame and profit. As long as they are restrained by this, how can the heroes of the world not enter Your Majesty's trap..." Concubine Tian comforted him gently.

The Emperor smiled bitterly. "If it could really be so, that would be good!" He already had a plan in his heart at this moment, and felt much more relaxed. He whispered, "Didn't the Noble Consort say she obtained a fine flower-and-bird painting to show me?"

The next day, shortly after lunch, the Emperor summoned Wu Mengming, the Commander of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, to the Wuying Hall and asked him if he knew of the "Divine Physician Zhou" who had been very famous in the capital recently.

The Embroidered Uniform Guard's surveillance in the capital was the most rigorous, with numerous eyes and ears. From the moment this Divine Physician Zhou made a name for himself in the capital, the Embroidered Uniform Guard had noticed him.

"There is indeed such a person. His name is Zhou Lezhi, and he claims to be from Shanyin County, Shaoxing Prefecture, Zhejiang. He is now renting a room at Chongxiao Temple to practice medicine."

In ancient times, most doctors did not have fixed clinics causing them to travel around ringing bells to solicit business. If business was good in a certain place, they would also rent a house to practice for a short time, often in temples or Daoist monasteries.

"Chongxiao Temple, isn't that the Zaohua Temple in Baizhifang?"

"It is exactly that place."

Chongxiao Temple was a famous great temple in the capital. Because of the jujube orchard with over a thousand jujube trees northeast of its Sutra Library, where the flower fragrance was like honey in early summer and the fruits were red as clouds in late autumn, it was known as a wonder of Chongxiao Temple at the time.

"How long has this person been in the capital? Apart from practicing medicine and selling drugs, has he done anything else?"

Wu Mengming wondered what kind of trouble this Divine Physician Zhou had caused to be noticed by the Emperor. Since some of his relatives and friends had also received favors from this Divine Physician Zhou, he intentionally protected him and reported, "He entered the capital in April of this year. Usually, he sits in the clinic or goes out for house calls. In his spare time, he also goes out for excursions. He has a wide circle of acquaintances, mostly relatives of patients reciprocating his kindness for curing illnesses."

"Do you know which family is his backer?"

Wu Mengming dared not conceal it. "It is Minister of War Wang Yehao."

Chongzhen nodded, reasonably satisfied with Wu Mengming's answer. He then asked, "Has Master Wang had any dealings with Master Tian of the Embroidered Uniform Guard recently?"

This question was truly difficult to answer. Wu Mengming instantly started sweating on his forehead. He thought for a moment and reported, "Because someone in Master Tian's family fell ill, Lord Wang recommended him to go. Apart from this, this humble official has not seen any other dealings between them."

Actually, Wu Mengming was fudging the truth here. The relationship between Wang Yehao and the Imperial Father-in-law Tian had not just become warm recently. It should be said that starting from April when Zhou Lezhi entered the capital, Wang Yehao had used this Divine Physician to establish a connection with the Tian family. Divine Physician Zhou had started seeing patients and making house calls for the Tian family half a year ago. The relationship between the two was now much closer than in the past. To be honest, Wu Mengming did not quite understand Wang Yehao's sudden fawning over Tian Hongyu. Ministers mostly "kept a respectful distance" from "Imperial Relatives" like the Tian family; very few were willing to associate with them. Wang Yehao had already reached the rank of Vice Minister of War with the title of Minister in the court and had served as a Grand Coordinator in the provinces. It could be said he had reached the peak of his official career. It was hard to understand why he suddenly thought of currying favor with the Consort's relatives. After all, the Emperor was not someone easily swayed by pillow talk.

Fortunately, Chongzhen did not pursue this question further but turned to another topic. "Has anyone from Assistant Commander Zheng Sen in Fujian come to the capital recently?"

This baffling question stunned Wu Mengming. He didn't know who Zheng Sen was. Although an Assistant Commander had a high rank, it was merely a military position in a Guard. Without other duties, it was basically equivalent to an empty title for a military man. There were several hundred such people in the Great Ming; how could Wu Mengming remember them all?

Perhaps Chongzhen himself felt that asking this way was inappropriate, so he added a sentence: "He is the son of the late Vice Commissioner-in-Chief Zheng Zhilong..."

Speaking of Zheng Zhilong, Wu Mengming naturally knew him. He hurriedly reported, "This humble official does not know about this matter. I will report to Your Majesty after sending people to investigate and clarify."

"Go quickly to investigate and report back to me. This person probably came to the capital from Fujian," the Emperor said.

Wu Mengming left the palace and returned to his yamen, immediately sending out his detectives to inquire. Within a few days, news was sent back that there were indeed several Fujian officials who had come to the capital. Some were there to report to the Ministry of Personnel after their terms expired; others were there on official business. However, these people had nothing to do with the Zheng family. It wasn't until they inquired at the Fujian Guild Hall in the capital that they learned there was an Inspector from the Zhangzhou Coastal Defense Vice Prefecture yamen in the capital on business.

An Inspector was an insignificant petty official in the Vice Prefecture yamen. Generally speaking, it was unlikely for such a person to be sent to the capital on official business. The detectives also learned from the people at the Fujian Guild Hall that he had not gone to any government office to handle affairs, nor had any officials come to visit him. However, this person went out every day and had extensive social connections in the capital.

"What is this person's name?" Chongzhen asked after hearing Wu Mengming's report.

"His name is Qian Taichong."

"Which year's examination graduate is he?"

"It is said he is a National University Student from the Nanjing Directorate of Education."

Chongzhen thought, *That makes sense*. If he were from a proper civil service examination background, it was unlikely he would run errands for a youth like Zheng Sen who was in such an awkward position. This person was probably a private aide Zheng Zhilong had promoted in the Fujian officialdom back then.

Now he was eager to know where this person had gone and whom he had met in the capital. Zheng Sen sending him here clearly hoped to gain the Emperor's support. He wanted to see which important officials in the capital this youth far away in Fujian regarded as powerful aid.

Wu Mengming dared not conceal anything and listed the officials this Qian Taichong had visited one by one. Chongzhen glanced at the list; these people were mostly of Fujian origin, and some were old connections of Zheng Zhilong and Zou Weilian.

Actually, Qian Taichong had also visited Cao Huachun and other eunuchs of the Directorate of Ceremonial, but Wu Mengming did not list them.

"What is he doing in the capital?" Chongzhen felt slightly strange. This Zheng Sen had already inherited the hereditary position, was not yet twenty, and had no examination degree; surely he didn't come for a recommendation for an official post. Moreover, he had been running around for a month or two and had seen so many court officials; evidently, there was a more important matter.

"This, your humble official has not found out," Wu Mengming bowed and reported. "However, your humble official has already arranged for people to watch him secretly. As long as Your Majesty orders, we can take him down for interrogation."
