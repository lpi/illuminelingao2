# Chapter 2648: The Capital (Part 4)

"Yes, the brand is Chen Li Ji," Concubine Tian replied. "His family's medicines are all sold on commission through Changchun Hall."

When Chen Li Ji had entered into a joint venture with the Australians, the shopkeeper had originally intended to open a branch in the capital to sell their various patent medicines. However, the Senate harbored concerns: Chen Li Ji, being a Guangzhou brand, had achieved considerable fame. Should the two sides go to war in the future, a branch in the capital would be difficult to preserve. Thus, through the "Five Mountain and Sea Routes" channel of Runshitang, they secretly acquired a small pharmacy in the capital and renamed it Changchun Hall. While continuing to sell traditional herbal slices, it also carried various pills, powders, ointments, and pellets from Chen Li Ji and Runshitang on commission. Within a few years, it had become quite renowned throughout the capital.

Every year during the Dragon Boat Festival, the palace prepared peace-of-mind medicines to present to the Emperor and the high-ranking consorts of the harem. These were nothing more than cooling remedies—Bezoar Resurrection Pills and Purple Gold Ingots—meant to address common summer ailments like heatstroke, colds, and diarrhea. Among them was also the Plague-Repelling Powder supplied by Changchun Hall.

Chongzhen felt a flash of annoyance that the Kun' medicine had spread so widely, but then he considered that Hair Rebel goods were already everywhere in the capital. From the harem down to the common people, everyone had come into contact with their wares to some extent; these peace-of-mind medicines were trivial by comparison.

Reflecting on books like *Notes on Pacifying the Hairs* and *Guide to Hair Rebel Affairs*, which all described the Kun as "so intelligent they neared demonhood" and "omnipotent," he felt a secret pang of regret. If only these descendants of Hua-Xia who had drifted overseas could have been employed by the court from the beginning! What need would there have been to worry about the Roving Bandits remaining unexterminated or the Eastern Barbarians remaining unpacified?

"Wang Zunde misled the country!" he muttered, his expression severe. The sudden vehemence startled Concubine Tian. She had no idea who Wang Zunde was, but anyone who provoked such thunderous rage from the Emperor would surely meet no good end.

She dared not speak further and simply remained at his side in silence. After a long while, the Emperor asked abruptly, "Noble Consort, tell me: does your father have property in Guangzhou?"

The words struck like a thunderbolt from a clear sky. Concubine Tian's heart trembled. Though her knowledge of her father's property holdings was limited, she was well aware of how her warm family members committed misdeeds outside, trading on the status of "Imperial Father-in-law."

Under ordinary circumstances, the Emperor would simply laugh off such matters if he learned of them. But the addition of the word "Guangzhou" made this greatly ominous. It seemed he suspected her father of colluding with the Kun.

Years ago, at someone's instigation, her father had sent family servants to Guangzhou, claiming they were going to acquire a property. Not only had the venture failed, but the servants sent there had died inexplicably. At first, Concubine Tian had paid it little mind. Only later did she learn that the property her father had coveted actually belonged to the Kun.

The incident had reportedly caused an uproar throughout Guangzhou City. The Tian family had expended considerable effort to smooth things over.

Because of this past event, Concubine Tian remained particularly wary whenever anyone mentioned the relationship between the Tian family and Guangzhou. The matter had passed several years ago—why was the Emperor suddenly bringing it up again?

Could it be that Cao Huachun and the others were putting eye drops in for her family? Yet whether considering herself or her father, their relationship with the eunuchs was passable; they observed all the usual courtesies, and there was no animosity between the two sides. Could it be the censors outside?

While speculating on the Emperor's state of mind, she answered carefully:

"Your Majesty, this bondservant's maiden family was originally from Shaanxi and later moved to Yangzhou. Guangzhou is remote, and we have neither relatives nor friends there. It lies far beyond our reach—how could we possibly acquire property there?"

Chongzhen had no knowledge that his beloved concubine's maiden family shared such a past with the Kun. His question had been unintentional; he simply wished to learn more about them. Concubine Tian was family, and compared to the formal exchanges between himself and his ministers, she would speak more candidly.

"I noticed many Australian goods in the Noble Consort's palace, which is why I asked," Chongzhen said. "Although most Hair Rebel goods are strange techniques and excessive ingenuity, there is no shortage of items that benefit the country and the people. It is simply a pity they cannot be used by the court!" He sighed with evident regret.

Observing Chongzhen's demeanor, Concubine Tian sensed he did not excessively detest the Kun. She was extremely astute and understood the Emperor probably harbored thoughts of pacifying and recruiting them. However, she knew his temperament well: such matters could only be proposed by ministers after "speculating" his wishes.

"Your Majesty, please be at ease," she comforted him gently. "No matter how formidable the Kun may be, surely they too possess hearts that desire fame and profit. As long as they are bound by this, how can the heroes of the world fail to enter Your Majesty's trap?"

The Emperor smiled bitterly. "If it could truly be so, that would be good!" By now he had formulated a plan in his heart, and he felt much more relaxed. He whispered, "Did the Noble Consort not mention obtaining a fine flower-and-bird painting to show me?"

The next day, shortly after the noon meal, the Emperor summoned Wu Mengming, Commander of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, to the Wuying Hall and inquired whether he knew of the "Divine Physician Zhou" who had become quite famous in the capital recently.

The Embroidered Uniform Guard maintained the most rigorous surveillance in the capital, with countless eyes and ears everywhere. From the moment Divine Physician Zhou had made a name for himself, they had taken notice.

"There is indeed such a person. His name is Zhou Lezhi, and he claims to be from Shanyin County, Shaoxing Prefecture, Zhejiang. He currently rents a room at Chongxiao Temple where he practices medicine."

In ancient times, most physicians lacked fixed clinics, causing them to travel about ringing bells to solicit business. When business proved good in a particular area, they would sometimes rent quarters for a short stay—often in Buddhist temples or Daoist monasteries.

"Chongxiao Temple—is that not the Zaohua Temple in Baizhifang?"

"That is exactly the place."

Chongxiao Temple was a renowned great temple in the capital. Northeast of its Sutra Library lay a jujube orchard containing over a thousand trees. In early summer, the flower fragrance was sweet as honey; in late autumn, the fruits hung red as clouds. This orchard was celebrated as one of Chongxiao Temple's wonders.

"How long has this person been in the capital? Apart from practicing medicine and selling remedies, has he done anything else?"

Wu Mengming wondered what sort of trouble this Divine Physician Zhou had stirred up to draw the Emperor's attention. Since some of his own relatives and friends had received favors from the physician, he intentionally offered a protective account: "He entered the capital in April of this year. Ordinarily, he sits in the clinic or makes house calls. In his leisure time, he also goes on excursions. He maintains a wide circle of acquaintances—mostly relatives of patients reciprocating his kindness for curing their ailments."

"Do you know which family serves as his backer?"

Wu Mengming dared not conceal the truth. "It is Minister of War Wang Yehao."

Chongzhen nodded, reasonably satisfied with the answer. He then asked, "Has Master Wang had any recent dealings with Master Tian of the Embroidered Uniform Guard?"

This question was truly difficult to answer. Sweat instantly beaded on Wu Mengming's forehead. After a moment's consideration, he reported, "Because someone in Master Tian's household fell ill, Lord Wang recommended him to attend. Apart from this, this humble official has observed no other dealings between them."

In truth, Wu Mengming was fudging matters here. The relationship between Wang Yehao and the Imperial Father-in-law Tian had not merely warmed recently. Since April, when Zhou Lezhi first entered the capital, Wang Yehao had used this Divine Physician to forge a connection with the Tian family. Divine Physician Zhou had been seeing patients and making house calls for them for half a year now. The relationship between the two families had grown much closer than before. Truthfully, Wu Mengming could not quite fathom Wang Yehao's sudden eagerness to ingratiate himself with Tian Hongyu. Most ministers "kept a respectful distance" from "Imperial Relatives" like the Tian family; very few were willing to associate with them. Wang Yehao had already risen to Vice Minister of War with the title of Minister at court and had served as Grand Coordinator in the provinces. One could say he had reached the pinnacle of his official career. It was difficult to understand why he had suddenly thought to curry favor with the Consort's relatives—especially since the Emperor was not someone easily swayed by pillow talk.

Fortunately, Chongzhen did not pursue this line of questioning further but turned to another topic. "Has anyone come to the capital recently from Assistant Commander Zheng Sen in Fujian?"

This baffling question left Wu Mengming stunned. He had no idea who Zheng Sen was. Although an Assistant Commander held high rank, it was merely a military position within a Guard. Without additional duties, it was essentially an empty title for a military man. There were several hundred such individuals throughout the Great Ming; how could Wu Mengming possibly remember them all?

Perhaps Chongzhen himself realized the question was poorly framed, for he added, "He is the son of the late Vice Commissioner-in-Chief Zheng Zhilong..."

At the mention of Zheng Zhilong, Wu Mengming immediately understood. He hurriedly reported, "This humble official has no knowledge of this matter. I will dispatch men to investigate and report back to Your Majesty."

"Go quickly to investigate and report back. This person has likely traveled to the capital from Fujian," the Emperor instructed.

Wu Mengming departed the palace and returned to his yamen, immediately dispatching detectives to make inquiries. Within a few days, word came back: several Fujian officials had indeed come to the capital. Some were reporting to the Ministry of Personnel after their terms expired; others had arrived on official business. However, none of these individuals had any connection to the Zheng family. Only after inquiring at the Fujian Guild Hall did they discover that an Inspector from the Zhangzhou Coastal Defense Vice Prefecture yamen was in the capital on business.

An Inspector was an insignificant petty official in the Vice Prefecture yamen. Generally speaking, such a person would be unlikely to be dispatched to the capital on official business. The detectives also learned from people at the Fujian Guild Hall that he had not visited any government offices to conduct affairs, nor had any officials come to call on him. Yet this person ventured out daily and maintained extensive social connections throughout the capital.

"What is this person's name?" Chongzhen asked after hearing Wu Mengming's report.

"His name is Qian Taichong."

"From which year's examination is he a graduate?"

"It is said he is a National University Student from the Nanjing Directorate of Education."

Chongzhen thought, *That makes sense.* Had the man come from a proper civil service examination background, he would be unlikely to run errands for a youth like Zheng Sen, who occupied such an awkward position. This Qian Taichong was probably a private aide whom Zheng Zhilong had cultivated within the Fujian officialdom years ago.

Now the Emperor grew eager to know where this man had gone and whom he had met in the capital. Zheng Sen's sending him here clearly indicated a hope of gaining imperial support. Chongzhen wished to see which important officials in the capital this youth, so far away in Fujian, regarded as powerful allies.

Wu Mengming dared conceal nothing and listed the officials Qian Taichong had visited one by one. Chongzhen glanced at the list; these individuals were mostly of Fujian origin, and some were old connections of Zheng Zhilong and Zou Weilian.

In truth, Qian Taichong had also called on Cao Huachun and other eunuchs of the Directorate of Ceremonial, but Wu Mengming had omitted them from the list.

"What is his purpose in the capital?" Chongzhen found this slightly strange. This Zheng Sen had already inherited the hereditary position, was not yet twenty years old, and possessed no examination degree. Surely he had not come seeking a recommendation for an official post. Moreover, the man had been running about for a month or two and had called on numerous court officials—evidently, there was a more important matter at hand.

"This, your humble official has not yet discovered," Wu Mengming bowed and reported. "However, your humble official has already arranged for men to watch him secretly. Should Your Majesty give the order, we can apprehend him for interrogation."
