# Chapter 2600 - Investigation (Part 23)

"But..."

"Hear me out, elder brother." Zheng Xiaoyu said quietly. "If you report them, at most you lose the drug-selling money. With the Senate's protection, your family's lives are guaranteed safe. That's first."

He Jun nodded unconsciously.

"Second, reporting allows you to redeem your crimes through merit. If you can also help the Senate investigate and solve this case, the Senate certainly won't pursue you—you'll probably even be rewarded. For your future business in Huizhou, elder brother, everything will go smoothly."

He Jun sat with head bowed, pondering for a long time. Finally, he looked up: "I'll do as you say, brother!" Then suspicion arose: "But brother, you sold me prescription forms. That's a major crime..."

At this point, Zheng Xiaoyu didn't hide anything. He smiled: "I, Zheng Xiaoyu, have always been a good cadre of the Senate—law-abiding. How could I do such things?"

"So that means..." He Jun was both alarmed and fearful.

"You guessed right." Zheng Xiaoyu said. "I was acting on orders."

"So that's it!" He Jun's head drooped in defeat. "Since that's the case, I entrust my entire family's lives and fortunes to you, brother."

"Count on me."

Zheng Xiaoyu gave such a firm promise not just to reassure him, but also because sworn brotherhood in medieval times was a serious matter. Though betrayals for profit certainly occurred, most were condemned by public opinion. Even for "work purposes," this moral commitment still had to be given.

He Jun's "voluntary surrender" brought the biggest breakthrough in the entire case. He Jun not only confessed all his dealings with Jubao Tang but also revealed much information he'd previously held back from Zheng Xiaoyu.

---

As they'd learned, Jubao Tang was the source of all such "Australian miracle drugs," with Quan Youde as the wholesale core. All drugs were distributed from him to second-tier wholesalers like He Jun.

There were over sixty second-tier wholesalers like He Jun, varying in scale. Most were peddlers without shops. But He Jun said—despite lacking business names—they specialized in "hometown networks," "mountain routes," or "waterway" businesses. Their distribution volumes weren't necessarily less than named major wholesalers like himself. Established wholesalers with names and shops like He Jun numbered over ten, mainly serving other provinces. Someone like He Jun mainly did Fujian business. His establishment alone could do over twenty thousand yuan in annual sales, with net profit around eight thousand yuan.

That was nearly fifty percent pure profit, Zheng Xiaoyu thought. No wonder they were willing to take such huge risks!

Such good business wouldn't necessarily have fallen to He Jun. After all, there weren't countless shops of his strength in Boluo, but there were quite a few. But when Jubao Tang first started recruiting distributors, most shops took a cautious, wait-and-see approach. Comparatively, He Jun had much more pioneering spirit. Upon hearing the news, though unsure if it was real, he still spent a hundred yuan to purchase second-tier wholesale qualifications.

At the time, everyone in his shop objected to his actions. Unexpectedly, the first batch sent to Fujian for trial sales sold out instantly. Lushi Powder really worked!

With such good news, He Jun rapidly expanded his purchasing volume, then sent people to develop the Fujian market, quickly securing Fujian distribution rights.

He Jun knew this Lushi Powder's effectiveness wasn't because Quan Youde had some secret formula, nor because Wanchun Quan's medicine was useful. It was because Australian drugs had been added.

He'd long heard Australian drugs were effective, but these drugs were not only extremely expensive but also extremely scarce. Boluo, supposedly Lingnan's largest medicine market, had almost no Australian drugs. Yet somehow Quan Youde had obtained Australian drugs through unknown means.

"You never inquired about the drugs' origin?"

"How could I not?" He Jun said. "With such a profitable business, who wouldn't want to replace him? Quan Youde was nothing compared to me before he made it big!"

But inquiries yielded nothing. Quan Youde's subordinates not only kept their mouths sealed tight—before long, the go-between who'd gone asking mysteriously died.

"...After that, I knew these people were all desperadoes. I never dared ask more." He Jun confessed. Though the other side was ruthless, he'd still managed to gather some specific information. He learned that Quan Youde's superior was a Daoist called "Mushi" [Wooden Stone].

"Daoist Mushi?!" Everyone in the interrogation room showed astonished expressions. Since the Guangzhou witchcraft case, this name had become known throughout the Senate's enforcement agencies, gradually exceeding even the Gou Er father and son.

"That's right. But I've only heard the name. I've never seen such a person." He Jun said.

Though he hadn't discovered the drugs' source, Lushi Powder business flourished. Later, Jubao Tang added multiple "Australian miracle drugs," each with different effects. Sales were very brisk, and He Jun made considerable money along with them.

"Since business was so big, why did you think of recruiting Comrade Zheng Xiaoyu? Who told you to try buying prescription forms?"

"It was Quan Youde." He Jun said. Shortly after Zheng Xiaoyu took up his Huizhou post, Quan Youde secretly summoned him, instructing him to try pulling Zheng Xiaoyu "into the water."

Establishing a Joint Clinic that could prescribe Australian drugs was just a pretext—also the personal benefit Quan Youde said was reserved for him. The key was obtaining prescription forms through Zheng Xiaoyu's hands afterward. As for why they were willing to pay high prices for prescription forms, He Jun didn't know.

"...They only said: as long as I could buy prescriptions, I'd get a ten percent discount on future purchases."

Compared to ten percent savings, one yuan per prescription form was really nothing.

Lu Cheng thought: pulling Zheng Xiaoyu into the water obviously meant their original extraction channel had developed problems! After all, they'd been doing this business for over two years, but pulling Zheng Xiaoyu in had only happened two months ago.

By pinpointing this timeframe and checking personnel changes in health sector drug-related departments, they could probably compile a list of suspects.

"Did Quan Youde say why he wanted you to recruit Zheng Xiaoyu?"

"He didn't." He Jun grew wary—this question wasn't friendly! He added some caution: "He only told me there was this money-making opportunity, asked if I was willing. I naturally said yes. So he taught me to approach Comrade Zheng, pull him into establishing a Joint Clinic..."

"There are several doctors in Huizhou. Why specifically target Zheng Xiaoyu?"

"He said this Dr. Zheng not only had excellent medical skills but was also head of Huizhou's health department—the most powerful. As long as he joined, everything would go smoothly."

Lu Cheng asked various questions about Zheng Xiaoyu back and forth, but nothing particularly special emerged. She felt slightly disappointed. She had a sense that Quan Youde's targeting of Zheng Xiaoyu wasn't without reason.

Still, from He Jun's confession, Quan Youde clearly had comprehensive knowledge of the Senate's cadre system and health regulations. Evidently, there was an inside source within the Senate's health department.

"How much do you know about Quan Youde as a person? Tell us everything you know." Lu Cheng said. "This is your good opportunity to redeem yourself through merit!"

"Yes, yes. I'll tell everything!" He Jun quickly affirmed.

What he said about Quan Youde was identical to what Peddler Qian had said, but he knew some additional details. He confessed that the Quan family's old residence was within Boluo county seat. But because the Quan family had made their living at the medicine market for generations, they also had a residence at the medicine market—servants called it the "new residence." He also said Quan Youde had purchased a farm estate in rural Boluo last year—reportedly in a very remote location, which few people had visited.

"Tell us about that Southeast Asian native."

Actually, He Jun knew far more about the "Kunlun slave" than he'd told Zheng Xiaoyu. Because Quan Youde had tried selling him "aphrodisiacs."

"Aphrodisiacs?" Lu Cheng asked in surprise. "Not fetus-changing medicine?"

"He never mentioned that. Just said aphrodisiacs."

This Southeast Asian native was somewhat famous at the medicine market's "ghost market" for selling medicinal wine. As a local "ground dragon," He Jun had naturally heard of him.

But aphrodisiac-type medicines, honestly, were rampant throughout the medicine market. Late Ming gentry were notorious for their extravagant hedonism, plus various "chamber battle" cultivation methods. The wealthy generally overindulged sexually. Market demand for aphrodisiacs and sex drugs was enormous.

Where there's demand, there's supply. The Boluo medicine market had such medicines in abundance—ointments, pills, elixirs, powders, and wines. Listed out, probably hundreds of varieties. Many appeared and vanished—even He Jun couldn't keep track.

"...But this Southeast Asian native's medicine was genuinely effective. Over time, even people in Huizhou prefectural city knew about it and sent people to buy." He Jun said. Only, this person appeared and disappeared unpredictably at the ghost market—not there every day, and with little stock. Whether you could buy depended entirely on luck.

Lu Cheng was somewhat confused because she couldn't yet connect "fetus-changing" with "aphrodisiacs." The concept of androgens was completely foreign to her.

But since such a Southeast Asian native existed and was connected to Quan Youde, it naturally needed investigating.

"How did this connect to Quan Youde?"

"This Southeast Asian native had been appearing here for five or six months. One day Quan Youde summoned me, asked if I was willing to distribute these aphrodisiacs. Said this medicine was from that ghost market Southeast Asian native—genuinely effective."

"Did he say, or hint, that the aphrodisiacs were related to Australian drugs?"

"No, he didn't." He Jun shook his head. "At the time, I just thought it strange. This medicine was always intermittent—why suddenly seek someone to distribute? So I asked Manager Quan. But he just looked impatient, only asking whether I was willing or not. He refused to say anything else."
