# Chapter 2498: Burning the Building (Part 7)

While speaking, Yue Wan had already re-tied Liang Cunhou's hair bun, secured it with a hairpin, and put the turban back on for him. Liang Cunhou gently touched the bun, stood up, and said: "Wan'er, sit. Today I will serve wine for you once." Saying this, he pressed Yue Wan onto the stone stool, placed an upside-down wine cup, and stood by Yue Wan's side. He carefully poured a cup for her, but poured too fiercely, splashing some out. Yue Wan covered her mouth with a handkerchief, giggling: "You little servant boy, so clumsy. If served like you, ten out of ten would be beaten out."

Liang Cunhou smiled and said: "Yes, yes, these clumsy hands and feet deserve a beating, deserve a beating." Speaking, he picked up the folding fan on the table and gently knocked on his own head three times.

After teasing for a while, Liang Cunhou seemed happier. He sat back at the table, drinking and chatting with Yue Wan. Time passed, and unknowingly the sky gradually grew dark, and the rain slowly ceased. At this time, the rain ended, and the clouds dispersed. The moon hung on the tip of the branch. The evening breeze blew gently, and birds chirped, making one feel thoroughly refreshed physically. After drinking for a while longer, Yue Wan said: "The Young Master sees everything too clearly. But in this world, what is most abundant is 'rarely confused.' Everyone is drunk, yet only you alone are awake, acting independently. If others cannot fathom your intentions, they will say you are meddlesome and ignorant of the times. You then give birth to so many grievances, becoming even more self-pitying and thus even more lonely. It should be that when others are drunk, you are also drunk; that is good. Whether it is the Chongzhen Emperor or Minister Wen, who being the Emperor makes what difference? Whoever comes, don't the common people still pay grain tax and perform corvée labor? With all your brooding thoughts, the court cannot see, the common people cannot understand; who will speak a good word for you? It is merely suffering yourself."

Liang Cunhou gave a self-deprecating smile and said: "I am just this stubborn and stupid; I cannot pretend. The Bald people have long been wary of me. The Australian factory guards pervade every opening. Recently, they secretly planted spies beside the residence, sending out reconnaissance riders in all directions. Those subordinates and lackeys outside, I'm afraid sooner or later it will be hard to escape the ears and eyes of the Bald Thieves. They also instructed the police, commercial tax, and health yamens to find excuses to disturb and provoke my Liang family's businesses every day; finding people related to my Liang family to make oblique inquiries, sow discord, threaten and bribe, causing my relatives and followers to betray and leave. Do not look at the strict defense of this mansion, isolated inside from outside; in reality, people harboring double thoughts already exist! You coming here, they will probably know about it this evening. Once you go back, inevitably Bald Thief factory guards will come to 'chat' with you! And I sit besieged in a city of sorrow with no plan. Other things aside, just my painstaking arrangements of recruiting death scholars, collecting Baldy intelligence, connecting with village worthies, and educating ignorant people are all going to flow eastward into nothingness. Viewed this way, once they obtain solid evidence, the Bald people will probably arrest and imprison me in a few days. I fear it will be hard to see the day the King's Master recovers the two Yue provinces."

Liang Cunhou raised his wine cup again, took a sip, looked into the deep night sky with a distant gaze, and slowly said: "The replacement of imperial power and the change of dynasties were originally just ordinary matters. Cathay has lasted for thousands of years; those who called themselves emperors and kings are countless! The glory and wither of one surname is not worth discussing! Only Confucianism has been passed down in one continuous line. Although Buddhism, Daoism, Legalism, Military Strategy, Agriculture, and others each have their strengths, ultimately it is external Confucianism and internal Legalism, aided by Daoism, supplementing and assisting each other, that's all. But the Australians are different. Although Australia also has great scholars, the School of Principle is not a prominent learning in Australia. The Bald people slight and neglect it. The Senate governs the country not following rites and teachings, not practicing benevolence and virtue. The Senators do not know self-cultivation and family regulation, are greedy and lustful, love ease, value trivial learning and utility. Their conduct is just stubbornly strong, leading to putting the cart before the horse and reversing heaven and earth. This is the track of the overturned cart ahead. If we do not support the dangerous situation and seek survival, in a few years, changing Xia with Yi, the world will be stolen by these overseas barbarians. If so, although Confucian learning in the world is not dead, it will be dead. Now Guangzhou Prefecture has fallen, and ten thousand horses stand mute. Thousands of scholars in the world all look sideways. At this time, it is exactly the time for us to sacrifice our bodies to relieve the disaster. No need to wait for others; we should rise up ourselves, choosing righteousness and complete integrity to be models, calling on anti-Song scholars in the world to respond with the same voice, gathering the power of the Nine Provinces to topple the Baldies and punish the rebels. The dynasty can be changed; the orthodoxy cannot be cut off. I, Liang Cunhou, have an iron backbone, shouldering morality and justice with both shoulders. I can only die; I cannot surrender."

After speaking, Liang Cunhou filled the cup with wine, stood up tall, raised the cup to toast the bright moon from afar, and chanted aloud:

"Singing the Liangfu Yin in sorrow,
Sounds like gold and jade striking the Shang note.
For ten years, Goujian planned to destroy Wu,
For seven days, Baoxu cried with a Heart of Chu.
Autumn sends new wild geese mourning the broken country,
Daytime walking hungry tigers gnaw in the empty forest.
The oath in the chest is deeper than the sea,
How can we let the Divine Land sink in the end?"

After finishing Zheng Sixiao's *Second Encouragement* poem, Liang Cunhou drank the wine in the cup in one gulp and said loudly: "Liang's power is only this much. I entrust the mountains and rivers to you gentlemen, to save the country from peril, waiting for future scholars." After saying this, he threw the cup in his hand into the pond in front of him. Coincidentally at this time, a long wind rose suddenly, rolling up his turban and robe sash, wrinkling a pool of cold water.

The night grew deeper and darker.

Inside the empty training ground, ten long tables were pieced together in pairs to form a long table bridge. The tables were filled with various equipment. Frowning, Wu Mu watched the action team members in front of him checking and debugging equipment. Various simulated scenarios were set up in the field, and groups of action team members entered the field for training from time to time.

Several heavy steel protective suits along with helmets were piled messily on the table. This was heavy assault protective equipment customized by the Police Bureau for the Storm Troop and Mobile Unit. Considering that the Political Security Bureau also had a large number of tasks to be carried out in city alleys or indoors, Wu Mu coordinated from Mu Min to get a portion of customized armor.

This kind of armor emphasized frontal protection. The core equipment consisted of a breastplate and a helmet. The breastplate was arc-shaped homogeneous steel capable of covering ribs and side flanks, with a thickness of about 2mm and a weight of about 4.5kg. It was spliced with lower abdominal armor as a whole, fixed to the inner cotton pad with steel nails, tightened by cowhide straps. There was a small piece of thin steel plate on the back to protect vital parts, connected with cowhide straps to improve back protection. The helmet was similar to later generations' motorcycle helmets, possessing a detachable steel faceplate, with a leather lining and simple bamboo and rattan shock-absorbing support structure inside.

Wu Mu had tried wearing it experimentally. In half an hour, it pressed his cervical vertebrae until they ached. Even the strongest soldier probably could not wear it continuously for a long time. The huge weight brought amazing protection power. Lead bullets, crossbow arrows, knives, and spears could hardly penetrate it. In the situation where enemies in the city generally lacked armor and firearms, almost all weapons in this spacetime were helpless against it during frontal assault. In limited alley battles and indoor assault trials, it achieved good results. Beside the protective suits, several canisters painted with red paint were smoke tear gas grenades filled with chili oil resin, which could make people unable to open their eyes and cause retching, coughing, difficulty breathing, etc., and cause a burning sensation when contacting the respiratory tract and exposed skin. However, due to the lack of protective equipment, they were rarely used.

Wu Mu then picked up a 1636 version revolver on the table and played with it. This pistol equipped with nitrated paper integrated cartridges exposed many problems after several years of use. Although loading was relatively convenient, there was much residue left, requiring bore cleaning after firing a few times. The most fatal thing was that the flame during firing occasionally ignited sensitive nitrated paper in adjacent adjacent cylinder chambers, causing accidental discharge and accidents. In addition, the size specifications of the 9mm Pai (Pi) bullet could hardly guarantee sufficient lethality under the propulsion of black powder. Therefore, the new version 1636 revolver changed the adapted ammunition specification to .44 Russian (11x25mmR) bullets. Although copper cartridge cases were not adopted, the original gas sealing device was improved, enhancing sealing. Reducing abnormal firing greatly improved lethality and reliability. However, this weapon was still barely satisfactory: especially the reloading speed and the problem of easy self-ignition during continuous firing were still not well solved.

But this was already the best weapon in his hand. Besides weapons, a batch of strictly controlled special equipment—flashlights—would be transported from Lingao in the near future. This would be the action team's greatest reliance for night combat. Although they had applied for night vision equipment many times, trying to compete for resources from the Senate's own son, the Special Reconnaissance Team, was obviously asking a tiger for its skin. He clearly remembered Zhao Manxiong saying with helplessness: Our resources are very limited; the Political Security General Bureau must endure. Wu Mu wanted very much to have his own special reconnaissance team to handle some extreme situations, but obviously, under such resource shortage, this was tantamount to a fool's dream. The only thing he could rely on right now was this action team that could be called crude.

Wu Mu moved his gaze to the training ground. A team was rehearsing assault tactics. They lined up in a five-person column. Except for the fourth member, all members used revolvers. The vanguard in the front wore heavy armor, holding a square steel small shield in his left hand and a pistol in his right hand. The second member served as a shooter to coordinate with the vanguard for assault clearance shooting. The third was the team leader, serving as the second shooter for supplementary shooting. The fourth member used two double-barreled shotguns for area killing support. The fifth member carried breaching tools as the rear guard.

They rehearsed formation changes and lateral deployment shooting while moving. Amidst the *ping-ping-pang-pang* gunshots, thick white smoke from black powder firing quickly filled the training ground, obscuring Wu Mu's vision. Lacking automatic weapons, facing the problem of how to ensure firepower continuity and firepower projection density at close range and short time, the solution of the Senate's various powerful departments was as simple as soldiers during the American Civil War: bring guns, bring more guns. Shotgunners carried two shotguns and two revolvers. Vanguards each carried two to three revolvers, while others carried four. This ensured that a five-person squad could fire over one hundred bullets continuously in one to two minutes under full fire conditions. However, as the number of shots increased, the smoke would also become larger and larger, which would lead to a cliff-like drop in shooting accuracy. But this amount of ammunition projection was already unrivaled in this spacetime.

Wu Mu sighed gently; he was a bit helpless. Even with the eldest disciple personally taught by a former ATF agent serving as the instructor, whose every move looked the part, the inferior equipment that was completely wrong for the job made the action team's drill lack any fluidity and aesthetic beauty to speak of. If criminals kidnapped a watermelon as a hostage, when the action ended, they could only harvest a handful of watermelon seeds. Wu Mu comforted himself with self-mockery in his heart: *Although we are rookie chickens, fortunately, our opponents are vegetable worms.*
