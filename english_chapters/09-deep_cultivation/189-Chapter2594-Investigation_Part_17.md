# Chapter 2594 - Investigation (Part 17)

Fortunately, before going undercover, he'd informed others of his whereabouts. Political Security people should be watching outside this shop day and night. If any emergency arose, as long as he could escape in time, he'd be safe once out the door.

With this thought, Yuan Shuzhi felt somewhat relieved. He ate when he should, slept when he should, and occasionally flourished his brush in the accounts room, writing some crooked poems and sour songs, putting on an appearance of contentment and enjoyment while waiting for events to unfold.

Zheng Mingjiang had waited nearly two months in Guangzhou with little progress. Every day when she opened her eyes, she asked if any new reports had come in.

Reports did come, of course. Under Lu Cheng's direction, the investigation team had roughly identified over fifty medicine peddlers who purchased from Jubao Tang. By tracking the peddlers' movements, they roughly knew where these drugs went—but this didn't help solve the case itself. They only knew these several "miracle drugs" had spread not just throughout Guangdong province but had also flowed into neighboring provinces like Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian. As distance increased and the number of resales grew, prices had multiplied several times. The best-selling Lushi Powder cost 300 fen at Jubao Tang; by the time it reached Xianxia Pass near Fujian, the price rose to one yuan.

Drug dispersal wasn't normally a problem, but this money not going to the Senate—that was a major problem.

To force the enemy to reveal their hand quickly, after consulting with Wu Mu, Zheng Mingjiang decided on a "startle the snake by beating the grass" tactic, using pressure to force the enemy into action.

The pressure had to frighten them without causing them to disappear entirely—the force had to be precisely calibrated. Zheng Mingjiang decided to have Cheka conduct a flying inspection of Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital.

In the seventeenth century, antibiotics' preciousness was unquestionable. Given their enormous medical value and monopoly by the Senate, they qualified as strategic materials. Cheka's surprise inspections of hospitals were routine, usually uncovering some problems and catching a few unlucky souls. But this gang had grown their "miracle drug" business so large without exposure—they must have some skill. So as long as Cheka's surprise inspection was like previous ones, the enemy would certainly take some preventive measures but wouldn't vanish—the profits were too large for anyone to let go.

"Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital is a major hospital with great influence." Wu Mu said. "Have you discussed this with your health sector colleagues? Director Lin and Elder Deng..."

"When I came, Dr. Shi gave me full authority. As for Dr. Lin and Section Chief Deng, they won't object either. After all, we're digging out parasites. Wouldn't it be better for the hospital once they're exposed?" Zheng Mingjiang understood his meaning. "The key is, from the transmitted intelligence, the enemy is obviously using prescriptions to extract our allocated drugs. Besides Lingao, the biggest allocated drug users are Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital and Joint Logistics."

Wu Mu nodded without speaking.

"Honestly, for quite a while I suspected Joint Logistics had problems. Joint Logistics has the longest chain, with small and scattered endpoints, mostly in unsupervisable states. Every link in that chain could easily obtain drugs. And Joint Logistics has the largest total volume. But..." Zheng Mingjiang pointed to a pile of Ten-Person Team reports. "In terms of convenience for embezzling drugs, though the Bōbō Army uses the most drugs, the endpoints are small and scattered. So it's unlikely to leak from endpoints. More likely from transit points like warehouses and transport lines. But such large-scale leakage would necessarily cause frontline troops to lack drugs. But from the secret battlefield reports written by the Ten-Person Team and the *Bōbō Army Internal Newsletter* compiled by General Staff's Political Department, there's no obvious reflection of drug shortages. Add to that the intelligence our undercover personnel obtained about enemies trying to buy prescription forms—we can now basically confirm the leaks are more likely occurring at various civilian medical endpoints."

"I see." Wu Mu nodded appreciatively. "But why do you think it's Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital?"

"No, no, I haven't concluded that yet." Zheng Mingjiang shook her head repeatedly. "But inspecting Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital has many convenient factors. Its management system is the most comprehensive. Criminals obtaining drugs from there would necessarily leave many traces. We might not have noticed these traces before, but now that we roughly know their methods, we can follow the trail of clues. As for those small medical endpoints, they might have problems too, but they won't be the main channel of drug leakage."

Thus, under Zheng Mingjiang's arrangement, Jin Zhijiao, head of Cheka's Guangzhou Committee, announced the start of a flying inspection of Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital's pharmaceuticals.

During the flying inspection, all medical records and ledgers stored at the hospital were extracted and transported to a unit at the Great World. Because the audit contents were far more complex than routine flying inspections, to verify these accounts as quickly as possible, besides Cheka's local auditors, a batch of auditors were dispatched from Lingao—almost all about-to-graduate audit training students. Several inspectors from the Guangzhou Tax Bureau were also borrowed to help.

Before starting the audit, Zheng Mingjiang first held a "mobilization meeting" in the large conference room—partly to alert everyone, partly as "professional training." Though Cheka routinely conducted audits and surprise inspections, this inspection differed from the past simple verification of whether accounts matched inventory. So Zheng Mingjiang planned to spend a morning explaining the audit's direction and key points to the inspection team.

For this meeting, Zheng Mingjiang specially prepared slides and also brought a large blackboard for supplementary explanations.

"...I won't elaborate on this operation's significance—it concerns controlled drug leakage issues." After briefly explaining the work content and relevant precautions, Zheng Mingjiang added: "Before we start formal training, I have a few words to say. Among those participating in this operation are many young people who've only recently started working. I want to especially remind them..."

Whether Cheka or Tax Bureau inspection departments, the staff were veterans with rich frontline audit and struggle experience. But Zheng Mingjiang wasn't confident about the newly-supplemented auditors. Most were young women who'd just started their jobs. From her limited work experience, the most common mistake such young women made was assuming—because they themselves were good people—that the person across from them was also a good person. They'd easily take the initiative to cover for the audited personnel, helping them square their accounts. Because in this process, they could only see the audited personnel. Being face-to-face with them could sway their emotions—if the other party was forceful, they might automatically defer; if the other party played coy, they might feel too soft-hearted. They couldn't see the abstract Senate's interests, couldn't remember the people under Senate governance they represented, and might even forget their job duties. To put it harshly, they lacked principled resolve, failed to uphold "serving the Senate and the people," resulting in dereliction of duty.

Therefore, Zheng Mingjiang specifically instructed the inspection personnel to promptly raise any irregularities they found. If uncertain, they could discuss and record—don't subjectively speculate about possible situations and let suspicious points pass.

"Don't get all sentimental with the audited personnel! This is struggle—life-or-death struggle with reactionary elements!" She spoke with murderous intent, slashing her hand downward with the air of chopping off heads.

"Now, announcing work discipline during the audit period..."

The audit work was conducted in several conference rooms within the unit. Staff ate and slept within the unit, with meals and necessities delivered by designated personnel. All documents, paper, and writing materials couldn't be taken outside without approval. National Army White Horse Squad guarded the unit door, permitting no unauthorized persons inside—and of course, they couldn't go out either.

Subsequently, Guo Huiwen distributed booklets to everyone: "This is a guide to diagnosing and treating common infectious diseases. Normal prescription dosages and treatment durations should fall within the guide's parameters."

Besides common accounting issues, Zheng Mingjiang introduced other matters requiring attention: for example, verifying whether hospital-registered medical record totals and prescription numbers corresponded with pharmacy dispensing ledgers and receipts; whether medical record writing, prescription issuance, and pharmacy registration times were consistent and matched; whether the age of archive papers and handwriting matched archive registration dates; whether medical record and prescription times matched the signing physicians' duty schedules; whether the number of hospitalized and outpatient patients at any given time was within bed and outpatient capacity; whether prescription drug quantities, treatment durations, patient visit frequencies, intervals between visits, time since last prescription drugs were fully consumed, mandated follow-up times, cumulative total medication, even household registration data showed any anomalies. If involving military personnel, this also included verifying correlations with unit designations, stationing times, relevant battle situations, and casualty and wounded compensation rosters. Each department and clinic's received drug totals, administered drug totals, current inventory, prescription issuance times, and pharmacy dispensing times also needed to be compared and analyzed against Lingao's historical shipping data—all data finally consolidated and compared against total data sent from Lingao.

Discovered problems were to be immediately transmitted to police and Political Security departments to facilitate external visit investigations and field surveys—for example, on-site evidence collection at hospitals with obvious problems, and household visit investigations of patients who visited frequently.
