# Chapter 2432: Sonia (IX)

The wing building may have been unassuming, but its interior decoration and facilities were more upscale than the main building. To ensure indoor coolness, not only did it have the same thickened exterior wall insulation as the main building, but an underground air-energy circulation cooling system was specially installed. Whether in scorching summer or "winter," the temperature here could always be maintained in a comfortable state.

For easy cleaning, floors and walls were all tile-covered. In the basement, there was even a small cold storage room with ammonia refrigeration for freezing and refrigerating certain specimens.

Sonia showed her pass to the guard at the entrance, then went to the changing room and put on a white lab coat, cap, mask, and a pair of indoor slippers. This was to prevent infection from bacteria or viruses carried by specimens.

There were no exhibition halls in the wing building—only storage rooms and workrooms of various sizes connected by corridors. As soon as Sonia walked in, she felt a chill. Unlike the busy exhibition hall, almost no one could be seen here.

She came to a specimen storage room on the first floor. Specimens "pending review" transferred from various places were kept here.

Several "apprentices" in the specimen room were busy around a table. Specimens wrapped in paper bags filled the floor and shelves.

"Teacher Suo!" As soon as she entered, one of her "apprentices" came to greet her. "You're finally here—there are too many specimens awaiting decision. We can't make up our minds."

"Hello, Dawen."

This female "apprentice" was named Ju Wenjing. Given Sonia's Chinese level, expecting her to correctly read "Ju" and "Jing" was a bit difficult, so she simplified it to just "Dawen."

Because she had another female apprentice named Ju Wenyi, that one was called "Xiaowen."

Naturally, they also didn't call her Sonia or the more cumbersome Sonia Lily Sharper, but simply and clearly "Teacher Suo."

Also present were several other Senators' apprentices. Among them, one apprentice made Sonia's heart beat faster whenever she saw him—she had never seen such a handsome man. A beautiful young man from the Caucasus Mountains, named Assavi Omshyan. Cui Yunhong found the name awkward to say and directly changed it to Cuixi.

Cuixi arrived in Lingao almost at the same time as Sonia. His appearance immediately caused a sensation among the Senators. The effect was probably not inferior to Sonia's spectacular debut. Even male Senators had to admit this young man's handsomeness. Reportedly, when Zhang Daochang later heard about this, he also revealed an expression of discontent.

Although Cui Yunhong doted on him, his social position was unavoidably awkward. After careful consideration, Cui Yunhong decided to send him to study natural history illustration. This way, at least he could establish some connections within the Survey Department. So Cuixi became Valentina's classmate.

Cuixi himself wasn't embarrassed by his status and was actually somewhat pleased. Later people learned that he had originally been selected by slave traders, planning to castrate him and sell him to Ottoman Turkish nobles as a eunuch. Now Assavi Omshyan could at least still exist in male form. Later, when he grew a full beard and his figure wasn't so beautiful anymore, his master would naturally release him—according to the customs of many Near and Middle Eastern countries, important men's "favorites" had a good chance of being promoted to general, minister, or other prominent positions.

At this moment, the Caucasian youth was sitting in front of several glass jars, carefully sketching something in his sketchbook. This young man had good painting talent. Trini greatly praised him, believing that with proper cultivation, he could completely become a professional artist.

Sonia followed Ju Wenjing to the table, on which several specimens were placed. Despite wearing a mask, a putrid and moldy smell still assaulted her nostrils.

All taxidermy specimens transferred here had to be stored in the basement's minus-20-degree ammonia refrigeration cold storage for 72 hours of ultra-low-temperature freezing before entering the specimen room. This was to kill any insects and eggs possibly existing on the specimens and suppress bacterial reproduction. Only then were they sent here for inspection.

At this moment, closest to her was a python postural specimen. This was a smaller-sized python, about two meters long, in a horizontal resting position on a tree trunk. The python skin already showed obvious signs of decay. Many places had been insect-eaten with holes of various sizes. The rice straw used as stuffing showed through these holes, all turned black.

Sonia picked up a bamboo probe and gently poked the specimen. The python skin immediately tore open a hole. She shook her head: "No use." She stamped "Destroy" on the card in red.

The next item was a mustelid animal. Sonia could tell at a glance this was Hainan's unique Hainan yellow-throated marten. She had been there when it was collected in Wanning. At the time, she had been delighted to collect this new subspecies unique to Hainan Island.

However, this Hainan yellow-throated marten specimen had many mold spots. In some places, the fur had fallen off in patches, and the skin also showed signs of cracking. Obviously, it had been poorly preserved. Sonia sighed, because the Hainan yellow-throated marten was very rare, only inhabiting large forests. To collect one required penetrating deep into the mountainous areas of Hainan Island's heartland.

Currently entering Hainan Island's mountains still carried certain risks. In the past, each time the survey team entered the mountains, they were escorted by the Li-Miao mountain troops—a major operation, one could say.

The yellow-throated marten was cautious and secretive by nature, good at climbing trees. It was the species in southern mustelids most fond of going up trees. The population wasn't large, and they were rarely encountered during surveys. Collecting one depended on luck.

She changed to a new bamboo probe, tested it, and felt the skin was still in fair condition—still somewhat elastic. She also didn't find any decay. As long as the mold spots could be removed, repair was still possible. She'd try to salvage and repair it. After all, collection wasn't easy.

"Keep this one. Repair it and it should still be usable."

The next specimen was a behemoth: a marlin. This was a marlin caught several years ago by the Navy's fishing team from Sanya. The specimen was about 4.5 meters in total length. At the time, Wang Luobin in Sanya realized this marlin could be made into a specimen, so he had the fish skin and fins completely stripped off, preserved with ice blocks, and sent to Lingao to be made into a specimen.

This specimen was generally intact, without mold spots, but was covered in dust. Visible to the naked eye were fish skin cracking, breaking, and peeling. In some places, fish bones were poking out. But upon touching, she found the fish skin was mostly intact, without signs of decay or insect damage. After simple repair, this fish could continue to be exhibited.

"This fish has the lightest problems." Sonia probed while speaking to her apprentices. "Specimens stored too long mostly have similar problems. The reason is nothing more than the skin being repeatedly shrunk and expanded under environmental humidity changes, ultimately causing the skin to crack and get damaged. Taxidermy specimen skin texture becomes thinner and more brittle. After drying, the skin's tension increases, lacking the toughness of living animal skin. After multiple wet-dry cycles, cracking, breaking, and peeling occur, causing skin deformation, color loss, and stuffing material overflow. See here—" she pointed with the probe at a fish skin rupture, "here there's obvious deformation. First deformation, then rupture. If not repaired quickly, these ruptured gaps will quickly expand, causing further insect damage or mold."

Dawen and Xiaowen nodded together.

"...So our repair is also simplest—as long as there's no skin weathering or decay, it can still be repaired. In a moment, we'll repair this marlin together."

The overall condition of the taxidermy specimens wasn't ideal. This was within Sonia's expectations. She had visited both Fangcaodi's specimen room and the Survey Team's specimen room—conditions were poor. Problems were certain.

Fluid-preserved specimens were in somewhat better condition. Although there was no formalin in the early days, small animals, plants, and insect specimens soaked in high-concentration alcohol at the time were roughly intact—most hadn't decayed or fallen apart. The only problem was that the alcohol in early specimens had all started turning yellow and cloudy. Theoretically, they needed to be replaced.

As for dry and wax specimens, conditions were wildly varied. Some were well-preserved, with flowers and leaves retaining complete color. Others were dried and shriveled, crumbling to fragments at a touch. Still others had already molded and spoiled. Some entire boxes of insect specimens, despite intact packaging with undamaged sealing wax, had already shattered and fallen apart inside.

Best preserved were the skeletal and fluid specimens sent from Bairen General Hospital. On one hand, doctors were more rigorous when making specimens—when conditions weren't met, they'd rather not make them. On the other hand, their storage conditions were much better than Fangcaodi's.

For the "apprentices," most were observing various human body parts and skeletons up close for the first time. The visual and conceptual impact was naturally very strong. Some timid ones initially didn't even dare to look and only approached after Senators' encouragement.

In comparison, Sonia was actually more accustomed to this—such collections were very common in Europe. Especially various "deformed fetuses" or deformed human fluid specimens or skeletons could often be sold for high prices and were treasured by collectors as "wealth" to show off.

However, the Australians obviously weren't too interested in collecting "deformed" things. Most transferred items were fluid specimens of human organs or diseased tissues.

These specimens were well-made, all soaked in high-purity alcohol or formalin. The vast majority were well-preserved. Only a small number showed tissue dispersion or liquid discoloration—these could be temporarily ignored.

Sonia looked while stamping cards, dictating relevant conditions and comments for Dawen to record. She estimated about half the damaged specimens were repairable. However, the Natural History Museum had too few staff. If Senators didn't come to help, actually only she and her two "apprentices" could work—and who knew how long repairs would take. In the basement, there was still a pile of animal specimens waiting to be prepared.
