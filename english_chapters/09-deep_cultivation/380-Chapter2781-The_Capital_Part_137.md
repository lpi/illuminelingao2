# Chapter 2781: The Capital (Part 137)

"Let me think about it," You Rong hesitated, "This is a big matter. I have to think about it carefully."

Wu Yan known this required slow grinding work and wasn't in a hurry to push her. She whispered: "Make up your own mind. There must be a long-term plan is all."

Chatting up to here, it was about enough. You Rong said she was a bit sleepy and wanted to take a nap.

"Just go to the guest room in the back to rest. It is quiet both inside and outside there; no matter how big the noise, it can't be heard." Wu Yan gave a mischievous wink.

You Rong's face blushed. The two got up, and You Rong led the way in front. Going out from the side door of the courtyard, there was a passageway. Walking not far along the passageway, there was a small door.

Pushing it open to look, it was an extremely small courtyard, three rooms. Inside the courtyard, there was another door, but it was locked.

When female relatives of big households came to burn incense and needed to rest temporarily, nunneries of some scale all had guest rooms prepared. Ganlu Nunnery naturally also had two such courtyards. Although the courtyards were small, they were arranged elegantly and cleanly, very quiet.

"I won't go in." Wu Yan laughed, "You go yourself. Just don't forget the time!"

You Rong nodded, but her heart was thumping wildly. Since Granny Shi acted as a go-between and completed the good affair here at Wu Yan's place, the two had met no more than three or four times. But every time left her with endless aftertaste.

It wasn't that she coveted the love between man and woman, but the past Master Zhou had very little taste. Although his attitude was amiable and the treatment was generous, he rarely talked with her and Yui on normal days. occasionally chatting, he also spoke some unintelligible crazy words. It was fine that Yui was illiterate, but she had studied somewhat, yet couldn't understand him at all.

This Master Pan was not only refined but also understood a little woman's mood better. A few words, a single movement could touch her heartstrings. This kind of comfortable and pleasant feeling couldn't be experienced at Master Zhou's place.

Pushing the door and entering. Inside the skywell (courtyard) was a flower bed planted with pear trees, now bare. The ground paved with tiles was full of Jiangnan flavor, swept clean. Standing under the eaves was exactly the lover she longed for day and night.

The two held hands, looked at each other and smiled; all love was unspoken.

Pan Cheng'an helped her list the door curtain and led her into the main room. The room had a fire wall, warm as spring indoors. A pot of New Year Peony was blooming brightly. In the center was a square table for four people, but only positioned with two fine rattan armchairs. On the table were twelve dishes of dried and fresh fruits and various appetizers for wine. On the red clay small stove, yellow wine was being warmed. The aroma of wine mixed with the fruity fragrance of the large basin of Buddha's hand citron on the table, making one intoxicated without getting drunk.

"This Wu Yan really knows how to enjoy!" You Rong laughed.

"This enjoyment of hers, even my home doesn't have such pomp," Pan Cheng'an laughed, "A wonderful point of winter in the Capital is this fire wall and fire kang. When heated up, the room is like spring. If it were in Jiangnan, damp and cold, one could only shiver."

"If it were me, I'd rather wear a silk floss padded jacket and shiver." You Rong laughed.

Pan Cheng'an smiled. Although there was no saying of "overthrowing a city and a country" (devastatingly beautiful) for men, this smile was enough to "fill carts with thrown fruits" (be extremely attractive). Just this smile made You Rong's heart thump wildly.

"Let's take off the outer clothes, drink a few cups together, and dispel the winter cold together." Pan Cheng'an said.

Immediately they took off the cotton robes and outer jackets. The two poured and drank together.

Private meeting between man and woman naturally had a secluded sentiment in it, especially in this freezing winter. Outside was covered with white snow, and the north wind whistled; inside the room, red clay stove, warm as spring, with fine wine and beloved partner by the side. It could be called ultimate joy in the human world.

One cup of wine down You Rong's stomach, her cheeks became rosy. Pan Cheng'an, however, had other intentions.

The You Rong in front of him, from the time she was introduced by Granny Shi, it had been three or four months. This private meeting at Ganlu Nunnery was also the fourth time. During this period, about one hundred taels of silver were spent.

Spending this much silver, naturally, required an excess return. With You Rong's appearance, taking her to Jiangnan for resale could fetch at least two hundred taels. But going through such great trouble, this little money simply couldn't satisfy his appetite.

You Rong was a rich family's concubine and had a son. Logically she would have a lot of private savings and jewelry. If he could persuade her to pack up and struggle off privately (elope), all of these could be obtained.

These days, he had understood the situation of You Rong and the Zhou family almost completely. Currently, the master's whereabouts were unknown, life or death uncertain. It was exactly the time when the future was vague and she was at a loss. This was a great opportunity to lobby her to elope.

Moreover, she revealed homesickness just now.

He pretended to be a person from Jiangnan originally just to set up an elegant and handsome persona, now it hit the mark by mistake. In this way, "eloping" also carried the meaning of "returning home," so You Rong wouldn't be so resistant in her mood.

Just thinking, he heard You Rong ask: "Master Pan is from Jiangnan; wonder which place?"

You Rong was from a Thin Horse background. Although short of social experience, her heart was very shrewd. Pan Cheng'an knew this sentence carried the meaning of questioning his background.

He was secretly delighted; in past interactions, she had never asked this.

If the other party regarded him as a dew marriage (short-term affair), a Southern Branch dream, there was no need to "get to the bottom."

It seemed "the groom" had affection, and the concubine also had intent.

Abductors (Kai Tiaozi) like Pan Cheng'an were chameleons. Their life backgrounds were several sets of fabricated ones, seamless when spoken, absolutely revealing no flaws. He said: "My old residence is in Jingjiang County, Changzhou Prefecture."

"Since there is an old residence, there is also a new residence then?"

"Yes, the new residence is in Wujin County. The old residence is in the countryside, the place is large, and there are farm estates and graves. occasionally one has to go to take care of them. The elders dislike the prefecture city being too noisy, so now they mostly live there."

"Since Master is a Changzhou person, the accent is not quite similar..."

No matter how smart Pan Cheng'an was, it was impossible to learn many dialects. Fortunately, he had an excuse long ago, saying: "My family is not native. Our ancestral home is Huguang. Grandfather's family was poor, so he went to Jiangnan to make a living, earning a family property. Thus we settled there. Until now, the elders and old servants in the family still speak Huguang dialect. I can't speak a word of it, but I can't speak this Jingjiang and Wujin dialect either... Hahaha."

"Master's Mandarin is spoken better than officials," You Rong praised, "Where does the Old Master hold a post?"

"Grandfather originally wanted father to study and enter officialdom, but alas, after studying for thirty years, he is only a Xiucai (Licentiate)..." Pan Cheng'an deliberately signed.

"Xiucai is the root of a Prime Minister; it is also not easy."

"Although my father didn't pass the Juren (Provincial Graduate) exam, the ancestral business in the family wasn't put down. So the family can maintain a well-off situation."

"If Master's family is well-off, isn't my place a destitute family?" You Rong laughed.

"There are many extremely rich families in Jiangnan; a family like mine can only count as a well-off situation."

"Yes, Jiangnan is really a good place." You Rong sighed, quite melancholy.

Pan Cheng'an knew she felt homesick, seized the opportunity and asked: "Is Miss a Yangzhou person?"

"Speaking of which, can't count as one. My family just had registered residence (Music Household registration) in Yangzhou. Actually, my home is in Xinghua County, Gaoyou Prefecture." You Rong nodded, "Parted for several years, don't know if the scenery is still as usual? Now the world is in turmoil of war everywhere..." After speaking, she showed worry on her face.

"Turmoil of war is true, but Jiangnan is always a blessed land." Pan Cheng'an comforted, "Xinghua is not far from Changzhou Prefecture, just across the river. If there are any letters or items to bring back, just give them to me."

"True, you are going back to Jiangnan." You Rong felt somewhat lost, "When will you go back?"

"Will set off as soon as the river ice melts." Pan Cheng'an watched her expression.

"Once gone, never to come back?"

"This... is also hard to say." Pan Cheng'an pretended to hesitate, "Coming to the Capital was originally to seek a future career. If there is an opportunity, I will still come in the future."

The meaning in the words was that there wasn't much chance to come again.

Although knowing this was a dew marriage, the two loved each other deeply in these few months. Now on the eve of parting, You Rong couldn't help feeling dejected and sad.

Pan Cheng'an said: "Speaking of which, I am also reluctant to part... Sigh!" He deliberately sighed a long sigh.

"What are you reluctant to part with?" You Rong asked knowingly.

Pan Cheng'an whispered: "Do you really not know?"

"I am not a worm in your belly, how would I know?"

The man sighed slightly, seemingly muttering to himself: "My heart, are you still unaware?"

You Rong pretended not to hear, only lowered her head and sipped wine shallowly. After a long while she asked again: "You have left home for so long, probably you also miss home."

"My wife is in poor health, and two children are also in childhood (tufts of hair), naturally I am worried." Pan Cheng'an said frankly. With his age and background, he couldn't say he was still single. "Fortunately, there is an old mother to take care of them at home, so I can still be at ease."

"Such a big family, you didn't acquire concubines by your side?"

"Concubines naturally exist, but both are women from rural backgrounds, unpresentable." Pan Cheng'an said, "They can only help manage housework. If something really happens, they have no opinions."

You Rong didn't speak. After contemplating for a long while, she suddenly said: "Coming to the Capital to seek a future career this time, is the matter accomplished?"

"Naturally it is accomplished." Pan Cheng'an revealed a proud expression, "Money can make ghosts push the millstone. Besides, what I sought was just a student of the Imperial Academy (Guozijian Jiansheng), not costing much trouble."

"Can let me see?"

"Why would I carry the appointment document from the Ministry of Rites with me? It's kept at Yun'er's place. If you want to see, I'll bring it next time."

"I'm afraid there isn't a next time..." You Rong muttered.

"Why?" Pan Cheng'an revealed a surprised expression.

You Rong immediately recounted Xu Yong's matter: "Looking at his meaning, I'm afraid the master family already suspected, just having no evidence."

Pan Cheng'an showed a nervous look—this was not feigned. He had inquired about You Rong's master family, absolutely a figure he couldn't afford to provoke. If really caught by the other party, his own little life would not be preserved.

"If so, need to make plans early to be proper." He said involuntarily.

"What plan does Master Pan have?" You Rong stared tightly at Pan Cheng'an's face.

Between electric light and stone fire (in a flash), Pan Cheng'an had already calculated clearly in his heart: Things having come to this, there was absolutely no reason to let go just like this. At worst, he wouldn't come to the Capital to "do business" for these few years.

Immediately he looked at You Rong with determined eyes and said: "My mind is decided, wonder what Miss thinks?"
