# Chapter 2643: Storm over Xiaoyao Market (Part 3)

Due to historical reasons, iron coins had very poor credit among people, very hard to circulate. After iron coin galvanized, degree of folks' acceptance difficulty could be reduced significantly.

As for anti-counterfeiting means, besides relief and galvanizing, only had a circle of convex rim preventing shearing edge. To reduce processing cost, didn't design milled edge preventing filing edge. Reason also very simple. No one Senator thought someone could rely on scraping iron filings on wrought iron to earn money yet not losing capital.

Anti-counterfeiting problem Senators universally not worried. When Senate Standing Committee asked Overseas and Ming Dynasty had or not possibility manufacturing fake currency, Mint's Senator Engineer confidently said:

"If they want to use one Yuan cost to imitate our One Yuan Silver Coin, they probably only need a few tons of lead or white copper, a few genius skilled craftsmen and hydraulic press designed by transmigrators.

"But if they want to use cost within one Fen, to replicate our One Wen Hard Coin made of steel iron, what they need is Senate, Cabinet, Ministry of Industry, hundreds of Industrial Senators and thousands of Industrial Workers as upstream downstream technical support. In short, need Great Senate and People."

"This is Kun Thieves' Tongbao Money (Circulating Treasure). Only started circulation previous days. One Silver Yuan exchanges one thousand Wen. This money doesn't have Australian Kun Note. All are Tongbao Money." Shopkeeper seeing Master very attentive to this Australian Tongbao, hurriedly came over to explain.

"All are Tongbao money? This is strange. Kun Thieves turned nature!" Li Guangyuan played with this new money in hand. Although knew this was only an iron money, value tiny to extreme, but money manufacturing excellent, comparable to best Yongle Money. Making people love not releasing hand.

Luo Heying smiled: "This is no more than an iron money. If Kun Thieves even want to haggle over this chicken feather money, their Great Kun Kingdom better close door rest business earlier."

Li Guangyuan instead asked: "This money now how to exchange?"

"On pier Kun Thieves' warehouse has exchange. Still is Fan Master's shops all can exchange. Merchants on market mostly take old Treasure Notes (Paper Money) to exchange."

Small amount paper money not durable, hard to count. Was "Paper Money" again. In common people's mind naturally not as reliable as this "Hard Coin."

"Any using old money to exchange?"

"Have, have," Shopkeeper nodded repeatedly, "Taking good money to exchange is not many. Mostly taking sand pieces, crab shells kinds of small money bad money to exchange. People taking Five Baht (*Wu Zhu*) to exchange are not many..."

Australians on this aspect were generous. Although wanting to look fineness weigh weight, as long as cast money, no matter what money, absolutely no rejecting, more or less always would exchange some new money.

Li Guangyuan pondered for a round. Didn't see out what conspiracy Australians had inside here again. Could only make unfathomable expression snorted a sound. Threw money back to apprentice, said: "Let's continue walking."

Street surface on Xiaoyao Market same as past. Had no special place. Today not meeting fair day. Peddlers came few. Street surface somewhat cold clear. He was also a famous figure locally. At this moment passing from street surface, shops' apprentices, shopkeepers one after another came forward to greet ask peace.

Since after Kun Thieves came, Master Li treated people usually also amiable quite a lot. If in past, attentiveness of some small shops he ignored completely. Now not only contained smile nodded head returning rite, occasionally also greeted a few sentences.

Luo Heying wanting to open shop on market, naturally was for Eight Immortals Society able to have a separate stronghold ear eye on market. This point two people hearts were both clear and clear. Mutually not speaking broken merely. Speaking to bottom, Eight Immortals Society was Eight Immortals Society. Li Family was Li Family. Right now although sleeping on one bed, dreaming dreams were different.

Big Pie drawn by Eight Immortals Society "King's Division South Down, Rectifying Supporting State, Glory Ancestor Shine Ancestor," Li Guangyuan wanted to eat. But he was also not that stupid. Relying on a few empty words then pulling team to go do with Kun Thieves—unless Great Ming Official Army entered Dongguan County City.

But he utilized Eight Immortals Society became "Heavenly King." Not only towards surrounding influence suddenly increased greatly. Prestige in Li Family Enclosure also reached peak. Face of Eight Immortals Society still had to sell.

Luo Heying actually clear and clear towards Li Guangyuan's mind. But, since ancient times getting on boat easy getting off boat hard. Benefit of Eight Immortals Society, Heaven Way League, not that good to take.

Two people each harboring ghost fetus (ulterior motives). Inspected various places on market. If speaking empty land, on Xiaoyao Market still had quite a few. But Luo Heying after looking all expressed not suitable. Two people turned Xiaoyao Market for a pass. Also didn't find satisfied one.

Leading apprentice mumbled secretly in heart. This Master Luo exactly wanted what kind of land? So picky. Also didn't say a Child Ugly Yin Mao (reason) out. Market was not big. No more than a street of half *li* long. Very fast arrived end. Here had a pier—this pier was originally none. After Australians came Fan Family just built here. To distinguish old pier on market, then called New Pier.

After New Pier repaired actually rarely had people using. Three five days also couldn't see a boat parking. Until recently, Australians started big civil engineering in Xiaoyao Market. Pier then prospered up. Daily had massive quantity boats parking, loading unloading goods.

New Pier walking West again, then bad a fence blocking road. Already arrived edge of market. "Big House" Australians built was just outside fence. Separated by a patch of river swamp with New Pier.

Li Guangyuan knew this place. Originally was a patch of river beach land. Later bought down by Fan Family used as Charity Cemetery (*Yi Zhong*) land. For tens of years didn't know buried how many bones down. Big day time no one willing to go.

Kun Thieves' "Big House" actually built on this patch of Charity Cemetery land? Li Guangyuan more or less somewhat surprised.

Only saw some Kun People wearing Australian style Duijin (buttoned) small jacket shouldering or lifting holding some objects, running on construction site. Had Kun person erected a small box with three long legs. Then carefully looked for half while lead weight hanging down from box. Only then stood up body. Head probing to near small hole in just center of that box side. Carefully looking at something. While looking, still while waving hand pinching gesture (mudra) dancing what talisman mantra. Far place had a Kun Person, shouldering a long wooden board. Shape like ruler. On wooden board painted lines of red color, black color one by one. This Board Ruler Kun Person following that Box Watching Kun Person pinching gesture dancing mantra, non-stop moved coming moved going. A moment not stopping either. Additionally bad a Kun Person, put a long strip wooden box on flat place. From bosom took out a small exquisite object again. Looked a few times. Then crawled on ground kowtowing that long strip wooden box. While kowtowing, while writing writing painting painting something on scroll beside body. This writing painting very careful. Still wanted to use that small exquisite object to compare occasionally. Still had some Kun People in hands actually holding some strange shaped guys. Sometimes looking at sky. Sometimes probing earth. didn't know doing what. Outside this group of Kun People, additionally had some Japanese Samurai head wearing iron bamboo hat, waist inserting Japanese sword guarding protecting at periphery. Idlers on Xiaoyao Market three three two two surrounded at far place watching. Sometimes joined head connected ear (whispered) a round.

Li Guangyuan was very amazed. Looked at each other with Luo Heying—This was doing what?

Shop Apprentice instead triumphant. Talked with fervor and assurance: "These all are Australian Feng Shui Gentlemen. Grave land Feng Shui of Xiaoyao Market is prosperous very much. Front and back produced three Cultivated Talents (*Xiu Cai*). Kun People definitely fell for this piece of Feng Shui Treasure Land. So circled occupying here. Moving all tomb caves grave lands here away."

Luo Heying let it be. Li Guangyuan was local person. Extremely clear about situation of Xiaoyao Market. This River Beach was Charity Cemetery land. Was burying place of lonely rely-less people. Let alone descendants prominent, even wife not necessarily had. Where came what Feng Shui Treasure Land. As for Cultivated Talents produced in Xiaoyao Market, also no which family's ancestral grave was inside Charity Cemetery land. This apprentice was outsider. Opening mouth actually was speaking nonsense.

However this apprentice was speaking more coming energy: "That three legged small box, is Thousand Li Yin Yang Box. Flat ruler that person shoulders, is Guiding Soul Summoning Board. Once Soul Summoning Board erects, then guides condenses souls of this radius one *zhang* (3.3m). Then use Yin Yang Box to distinguish carefully. If is place vicious ghost evil soul stationing then cannot use. This is Watching Qi (*Kan Qi*). That long box that person worships, inside has condensed Yin Soul. If earth peaceful Qi upright, that Yin Soul then steadily lies in just center. Eight winds not moving. If has evil filth making trouble, Yin Soul then wants to move towards direction. Just possessed magic power suppressing unable to escape merely. Small object taken out from bosom most spiritual clever. That is Western Eight Treasures Australian Compass. Don't look small one object, inside possesses heaven earth mystery. Lifting cover then can calm wind peaceful Qi. Breaking all blinding methods of ghosts demons. That person uses Yin Soul Box and Australian Compass cooperating, is Gazing Land (*Wang Di*). That written thing is also not kind object. Originally is Heaven Book Profound Scroll. Kun person magic power high strong writing writing painting painting on that Profound Scroll, is Making Formation Changing Feng Shui. Besides those magic tools held in Kun People hands..."

Li Guangyuan said secretly in heart: Truly a sect of nonsense! However very fast doubt rose in heart again: Maybe this Australians truly bad some evil art demon method. Otherwise short ten years effort, how could sweep Two Guangs from Lingao small county, tearing earth claiming King? Besides their many secret arts, conducting all were matters violating common logic...

Luo Heying while looking at Kun people watching Qi gazing land, measuring Feng Shui, while listening to Shop Apprentice speaking torrentially without stopping about Australian Sorcerers' knack. Only heard was cloud mountain fog cover. Half day couldn't touch head brain. Couldn't help inserting asking a sentence: "Inside here have True Kun?"

"True Kun? True Kun Fake Kun appearance all almost same. Also distinguish not clear." Speaking here, Shop Apprentice became more interested, "If can lean close, still have some differences. This True Kuns are all chest throwing belly folding (stomach out/proud), appearance imposing. Stature also higher a head than ordinary Fake Kun. Clothing on body also has difference. Although wearing similar not much difference, True Kun's clothes material workmanship all better some. Style also more some. If wearing not nondescript not class (weird/unique), must be True Kun undoubtedly."

Luo Heying couldn't help asking: "You again how know?"

Shop Apprentice proud said: "When Kun Soldiers just arrived, True Kuns came not few. Inspecting commercial sentiment market surface on market. Front shouting back crowding. People all called Chief. Small one saw not few. Current doing work strongly are all Fake Kuns. Wearing Iron Hat carrying sword guards are all Japanese Pirates under Kun Thieves command—Presumably have True Kun in camp."

Saying he pointed a place surrounded by earth wall bamboo fence at construction site side, "There is Kun People's camp."
