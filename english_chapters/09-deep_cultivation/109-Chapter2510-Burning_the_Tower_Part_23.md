# Chapter 2510: Burning the Tower (23)

Xu Tong cat-walked back about fifty meters. His body was also inserted with camouflage vegetation. Not much camouflage; this ensured that he wouldn't be caught by vegetation during high-intensity movement. Camouflage could not become a burden to action. He first sprinkled the dead branches in his left hand evenly on the road along the direction of advance, covering them with floating soil and fallen leaves. Then he chose a spot by the roadside with hard mud ground, soft green vegetation, and dense grass in the shadows to slowly lower his body. Moving in hard grass and withered grass would make rustling sounds. The greener and more tender the grass, the smaller the sound when moved. Soft-soled shoes stepping on moist hard mud ground would make almost no sound. And sound was crucial for concealment.

Not long after he lay down, the pursuers arrived as expected. They walked very carefully, trying not to touch suspicious fallen leaves and small stones. But when they passed the dead branch area, a dry branch was stepped on with a "crack." Wei Mingchen didn't take it to heart. There were many dead branches accumulated over the years in the mountain forest. Even a hunter couldn't avoid startling prey by stepping on dry branches and loose stones.

The footprints disappeared. Wei Mingchen squatted down, carefully looking for clues. The target's movement speed was very slow. If they also eliminated traces, the time until they were caught would only be shorter. Since this was the case, their doing so must have some intention. Maybe hiding or ambushing. He opened his mouth and said, "Search this vicinity, see if there are..."

Just as he was speaking, other swordsmen passed Wei Mingchen to continue forward, inevitably stepping on a dry branch again with a sound. Wei Mingchen immediately sensed something abnormal. Stepping on dry branches so frequently in a short time, there was only one possibility: early warning. Just as he was about to shout a warning, a scream of "Ah" came from behind.

Xu Tong maintained an absolutely static posture. His eyes could barely see the wild path ahead through the grass. Visibility was poor, very blurry. He remained silent. When he heard the first sound of a dry branch breaking, Xu Tong determined the bearing of the enemy's team head. When several shadows flashed successively past his eyes, he finally determined the number of pursuers: eight people, in groups of two, with intervals of about one and a half meters.

Xu Tong arched his body slightly, hands and feet bracing against the ground, biting the short knife in his mouth, like a spring compressed to the limit accumulating energy. His gaze stared tightly at the blurry figures in the team one by one. When the second sound of crumbing dry branch rang out, he finally saw the last enemy.

Xu Tong catapulted out suddenly the instant the last person turned his face to the other side. Without the slightest hesitation, the opponent was totally unprepared. Xu Tong performed two fierce stab attacks to the left ribs in succession, then immediately struck and disengaged. In almost an instant, he rushed out two or three meters. He didn't look back, nor did he care about the life or death of the stabbed person. He only knew that stabbing meant eliminating a threat. Several short arrows shot from hand crossbows flew past him. This kind of pitiful hand crossbow could only pose a threat to unarmored targets at close range. Accuracy would be completely lost if the distance was slightly further. And the few meters Xu Tong ran won that glimmer of survival.

Xu Tong kept his body low, holding the short spear made of the tree trunk tightly, running in the envisioned direction. There, a half-man-high tree stump had the last bamboo tube tied to it. The seal at the bottom of the bamboo tube had long been picked open, exposing a length of string. When passing by, Xu Tong yanked the string fiercely with his left hand. The bamboo tube spewed a trail of white smoke. A red signal flare soared into the sky from the smoke. At the highest point, a small parachute popped open with a snap, drifting down leisurely. Xu Tong glanced at the signal flare behind him in the midst of his busy rush. Since it was luring the enemy, there was no need to verify concealment. Hopefully someone could see it.

After pulling the signal flare, Xu Tong changed direction and began to run with all his might. Uninterrupted fighting made him feel his physical strength dropping severely. This affected his speed. He constantly adjusted his breathing, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth, attempting to stimulate his remaining potential and stabilize his emotions.

Chaotic roars and exclamations sounded behind Xu Tong, but these people were obviously fiercer than those Daoist assembly bandits. They were neither scared by the sudden sneak attack nor did they go to treat their fallen companion. Instead, they divided into three groups to intercept Xu Tong. Two two-man groups looked for routes from the flanks to circle forward and force Xu Tong to change his route of march. The three-man group behind approached quickly in a straight line.

Under the pressure from both flanks, Xu Tong had to change running direction frequently. This made his speed drop continuously. He panted violently non-stop. The sounds behind him got closer and closer. He quickly scanned the surroundings. Although the other two groups sealed his bearing and retreat, the terrain of the jungle also limited their movement range, making their distance from him not shorten, but actually lengthen. Xu Tong took a deep breath. He decided to gamble. He changed running direction and suddenly turned back to charge at the three-man group chasing directly behind. In the pursuers' subconscious, fleeing prey within visual range would give up resistance and flee straight away like a mouse exposing a fragile back when in absolute disadvantage. The pursuers' encirclement was formed, and Xu Tong showed signs of obvious physical decline. All this allowed the pursuers to build a subconscious strongman mentality of relaxing guard. Just needing to catch up and stab from the back would solve everything. Xu Tong wanted to seize this psychological prediction of theirs, catch them off guard, break their psychological advantage, and suppress them in momentum.

The three pursuing men didn't expect Xu Tong to have the courage to charge back. Startled by Xu Tong suddenly crashing toward them, rapid running prevented them from forming a three-man horizontal line, instead stretching into a single file column. The lead swordsman thrust a Qi Family saber, right foot sliding forward, left foot following, hands twisting inward with force, contracting abdomen, sending arms, stabbing swiftly at Xu Tong's throat. Xu Tong quickly adjusted posture, left foot stepping forward, left hand holding the front end of the short spear, right hand sending it forward, stabbing straight at the opponent's chest. At the instant knife and spear crossed, Xu Tong parried the short spear slightly to the left, deflecting the Qi Family saber's point, seized the center line, and stabbed the swordsman's left chest with one spear thrust. The percussion cap on the convex platform inside the booby trap fired under the impact of full-force stabbing. This was equivalent to a point-blank shot from a large-caliber rifle. The bamboo tube and the front end of the tree trunk exploded simultaneously into countless fragments spraying in all directions. The 11mm lead bullet directly tore the swordsman's chest, forming a cavity inside the human body. The lead bullet tumbled, deformed, and shattered inside the body, destroying internal organs. The main body of the lead bullet broke out from the back again, changing trajectory, flying past grazing the second swordsman's cheek.

The first swordsman was knocked down in one encounter. The two swordsmen behind were stunned by the explosion and ricochet, all retreating a step. Xu Tong's face was scratched by flying bamboo fibers, but he felt nothing. He threw away the tree trunk with its front end blown off and still smoking white smoke, picked up the Qi Family saber dropped by the first swordsman, strode forward, holding the saber with both hands, pressing straight toward the second swordsman holding a Japanese sword.

Xu Tong and the second swordsman raised swords over their heads with both hands almost simultaneously, each sliding their right foot forward one step. Same starting position, same saber momentum. Both used both hands to twist the blade inward. The blade drew an arc over the head, moving to the right side of his own head. Hands exerted force to strike with the saber. Two sharp saber lights flashed past in the last afterglow of dusk, chopping down fiercely at a 45-degree angle from right to left toward the enemy's left side simultaneously.

Two steel blades bit each other dead in the air with a clang, emitting a "creak" sound unique to metal friction that set teeth on edge. After an instant of stalemate, the tips of both steel blades broke simultaneously. Violent hacking, clean knife drawing. Where the blade light rose, it brought up a sky full of flying blood rain. The two people bathed in red blood mist crossed paths instantly. The spinning broken blades flew in opposite directions. One blade tip nailed into a nearby tree trunk with a thud; the other nailed into the mud nearby.

The swordsman stood with his back to Xu Tong. The hand holding the sword slowly dropped. He knelt down with a *plop*. There was a slanted, deep cut on his body from the left neck to the thoracic vertebrae. Arteries and collarbone were all severed by one cut, spurting fresh blood non-stop. He opened his mouth, spat out a mouthful of blood foam, and fell headlong into the dust.

Xu Tong slowly retracted his saber stance, carrying the bloodied broken saber, and looked coldly at the third swordsman. The swordsman was thoroughly awed by Xu Tong's two consecutive near-desperate instant kills. He retreated step by step, as if looking at a devil. Finally, unable to bear the huge pressure, he turned tail and ran backward.

Xu Tong breathed a sigh of relief lightly. Only he knew that the continuous fierce fights and flight starting from noon had exhausted all his strength. His hands trembled slightly non-stop, almost unable to grip the saber in his hand tightly.

Run, run quickly. This short window of time would be canceled out by the numerically superior enemy at any time. A good man is no match for four hands, not to mention he had to deal with seven or eight people!

Xu Tong dragged his exhausted body, running with difficulty in the direction he came from. He didn't know how long he ran. Too tired. Sweat blurred his eyes. He just wanted to close his eyes and fall down, sleeping deeply. But will still stubbornly supported him to try hard to keep his eyes wide open.

Finally, the body reached its limit. Even relying on perseverance was hard to support. He even felt he was starting to lose consciousness. Xu Tong gradually stopped. Couldn't run anymore, really couldn't run anymore. Does everything end here? Xu Tong threw away the broken saber, leaned his back against a big tree, slid down bit by bit along the trunk, and sat leaning on the tree roots. He pulled out the dagger with sore and soft arms, gripping it tightly in his hand.

After a while, through eyes blurred by sweat, he saw several figures. One of them grabbed the escaping swordsman, scolding him loudly. Seemed to be a leader. Afterward, five blurred figures approached him slowly holding weapons. Xu Tong grinned. These people were not bad. Not scared by consecutive blows. Establishing such strong courage probably took a long time.

The enemies stopped at a distance of less than ten meters from him, appearing very wary. They took out hand crossbows and fired several arrows at him continuously. One arrow grazed Xu Tong's left shoulder, but he felt nothing.
