# Chapter 2769: The Capital (Part 121)

"Where are this father and son now?"

"The last time I saw them was in Guangzhou. Afterward, I didn't know their whereabouts." Liu Sha said, "This Gou Xunli has now changed into monk's robes, with the Dharma name Haixiang. However, ever since you required monks and Daoists to register, he probably doesn't dare to operate under this identity anymore. But, he is definitely still in Guangdong."

"You are this certain?"

"He is completely useless in the Capital, so naturally he must stay in Guangdong. He is deeply involved in the affairs of the religious sects."

"What about Gou Chengxuan?"

"This person's whereabouts are unknown to this Poor Daoist as well." Liu Sha spread his hands. "He disappeared after Master Wang left his post in Guangdong. I don't know if he stayed in Guangdong or went elsewhere."

"Does this Monk Haixiang have an ordination certificate?"

"Where in the Great Ming do monks have ordination certificates?" Liu Sha sneered, "It would be strange if they did. However, he did burn ordination scars."

In the early Ming, the management of Buddhist and Daoist monks was extremely strict, and the procedures for becoming a monk were cumbersome. Such strict management resulted in monks and Daoists generally having no ordination certificates by the middle of the dynasty. exactly how many monastics there were became a messy account.

This piece of intelligence from Liu Sha, apart from explaining that the Gou father and son were still around, actually didn't have much significant meaning. Moreover, based on his description, compared to the "simulation portraits" seen in the archives in the past, the appearances of both men had undergone major changes.

"Daoist Priest, this news of yours is quite important. The Senate indeed has long wanted to eliminate the Gou father and son quickly. It's just that the appearances of these two are already vastly different from the past." Xu Ke was slightly disappointed. "I'm afraid even if he stood in front of me now, I wouldn't recognize them."

"I do have another piece of news that can help you capture this Gou Xunli."

"Oh?"

"Although this Poor Daoist is unclear about this person's specific location in Guangdong, the last place he went was Xiangshan County. It seems they are preparing some action there."

This was an extremely crucial piece of news. Xu Ke asked with interest, "Is the uprising planned by Master Liang waiting for the Imperial Court's grand army before launching?"

"This, this Poor Daoist is also unclear." Liu Sha shook his head, "Mr. Le strongly disapproved of Master Liang's uprising. He said that apart from sending many loyal and brave men to their deaths in vain, it had no other use."

"What about Master Wang?"

"He was indifferent." Liu Sha said, "Anyway, the losses would be Liang Cunhou's men and horses."

"So, ‘Old Stone’ has no intention of getting involved in this matter."

"Precisely." Liu Sha said, "Old Stone doesn't have many people and can't afford to waste them on this. Mr. Le's intention was for the various forces in Guangdong to hide; the teams don't need to be large, and definitely shouldn't establish strongholds. They should gather only when taking action. giving the Australian thieves a cold blow: killing a few Fake Australians, setting fire to Australian properties, kidnapping merchants attached to the Australians, ambushing cargo ships halfway..."

"Harassment." Xu Ke thought this Zhou Lezhi was really cunning enough; this was planning to wage guerrilla warfare!

"This Mr. Le of yours is truly a rare talent!"

"Who says he isn't? This Poor Daoist also admires him tight."

"I want to catch this Mr. Le now; do you have any methods?" Xu Ke smiled.

"This Poor Daoist has said, he operates alone; this Poor Daoist also does not know his whereabouts..."

"The Capital is only so big; presumably, he won't run around everywhere. There must be some places he frequents."

Liu Sha hesitated for a moment and said, "There is a residence Mr. Le used to live in that this Poor Daoist has been to. It's just that Mr. Le hasn't lived there for a long time."

"Where is it?"

"Right at the Wanggong Factory."

"Wanggong Factory?" This name was thunderous to the ears of all Senators. After all, that "Tianqi Explosion" as an "inconceivable event" had long callused their ears.

"Wasn't that place blown up?"

"After it was blown up, people naturally went back to live there. The land in the Capital is worth an inch of gold; how could there be vacant places? It's just that the markets haven't recovered to their former state yet."

"Where specifically?"

Liu Sha did not hide it either and described the orientation and appearance of the residence on the spot.

"Is anyone still living inside?"

"Mr. Zhou's two concubines and two children."

"Children? He has children?!" Xu Ke felt like he heard big news. "What are their names?"

"The older one is a girl, called Zhou Juli (Curie), and the younger one is a boy, called Zhou Niudun (Newton)."

These two names were given with extreme badassery. Needless to say, Zhou Lezhi was definitely a science and engineering man. He also married two wives; impressive, impressive.

"It will be easy to handle if he has family dependents." Xu Ke laughed.

Liu Sha looked at him somewhat strangely, and Xu Ke realized he had thought in the wrong direction.

"Does this disciple not go to visit his mistress-mother?"

"Mr. Le said it's safer not to visit them. With Master Wang looking after them, they won't suffer grievances."

"Are there any letters, notes, or similar things remaining in the residence?"

"None. Mr. Le took everything away; a total of three large carts of things."

"Where were they transported to?"

"Probably to Master Wang's residence. This Poor Daoist does not know the specific whereabouts."

Although Liu Sha spoke very certainly and had no need to deceive him, this Zhou Lezhi very likely still hid some important documents inside the residence. Just like the correspondence Liu Sha hid in his study.

A lonely visitor from another spacetime inevitably has a strong desire to confide, and nine out of ten times would not be resigned to letting his unique encounter vanish just like that. It was very possible he secretly left written materials.

As for his wives and children, for the sake of caution, it was best to control them too. While the children were small, the wives were adults. It was hard to say what this Zhou Lezhi had told them, or what they had seen.

"So, this Mr. Zhou had quite a few things in the residence at that time?"

"More than quite a few; it was several rooms full of objects."

"What kind of things were they?" Xu Ke immediately became interested.

"Mostly Australian goods." Liu Sha said that whether Zhou Lezhi was accompanying Wang Yehao to his post in Guangdong or staying in the Capital, he would send people to secretly purchase all kinds of Australian goods and some Australian books. These Australian goods were mostly unpopular Australian scientific instruments and experimental equipment.

"...He had a study room specifically where he had tables and cabinets made to order. It was filled with these Australian artisan tools. Every three or five days he would toss and turn in there for a while. He also told Wang Zhi and his apprentice to search for all kinds of weird and bizarre gadgets everywhere, sometimes getting their faces covered in dirt..."

At this point, Liu Sha couldn't help but laugh, probably recalling some amusing scene.

"Did he ever build any utensils?"

"He did. He drew many blueprints and made small models by hand. Asking craftsmen to make them resulted in very exquisite items, heavily leaning towards clever techniques and excessive ingenuity. He loved to discuss weaponry, speaking logically, and drew countless sharp weapons on paper. But when it came to actually making them, it was always 'this won't work' or 'that is missing.' Wang Yehao asked him to imitate the Nanyang Rifle's cartridges, he pushed it away saying he didn't know how; asked him to cast cannons, he said he wasn't good at casting. He did build a waterwheel on the Dongyang Farm estate, saying it was to blow wind for a small blast furnace to make steel. In the end, steel wasn't made either. That waterwheel was quite useful for hulling rice and grinding flour."

When Liu Sha spoke, his face was full of mocking. Xu Ke, however, felt a wave of desolation.

Putting himself in his shoes, being alone among a crowd of people who completely couldn't understand you, although controlling many resources, one couldn't turn the ideas in one's head into reality. Even if one was from a science and engineering background, knowing astronomy above and geography below, proficient in gunpowder, glass, and soap formulas... when actually starting to do it, only then did one discover the lack of too many preconditions and process details.

There wasn't a single person beside him who could help him implicitly; they might not even understand what he was saying.

This kind of terrible sense of loneliness and helplessness... Xu Ke thought, *Thanks to the Senate!*

"Were there books too?"

"Many, all Australian books. I don't know who you prepare to sell these printed things to; probably ninety-nine out of a hundred people can't understand them..."

"Did he write any books or notes himself? Apart from the 'Heavenly Book'."

"According to Wang Zhi: he wrote every night. After writing, he would teach his apprentice, lecturing late into the night."

Although Liu Sha didn't know what was written in the manuscripts, Xu Ke roughly guessed they were mostly various technology and military books, perhaps content similar to *Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms*. Essentially, not much difference from the various books published by the Senate.

...

The interrogation of Liu Sha yielded a large amount of valuable information, basically figuring out the hidden cards of the Old Stone group. Especially the intelligence on "Mr. Le," which could be called a breakthrough.

The most valuable intelligence was still clarifying the mastermind and the network behind the series of cases that occurred in Guangzhou since its liberation.

Overall, Liang Cunhou wasn't deeply involved in the Witchcraft Case, and even the Counterfeit Currency Case had little to do with him. But judging from the intelligence provided by Liu Sha, he was dead set on "doing something big." Once he succeeded, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Currently, it seemed the "remnants" everywhere had gradually merged after several years of turbulence, forming a group that was loose yet tightly connected.

However, their integration might not necessarily be a bad thing. Xu Ke thought, *At least it gives the Senate a chance to catch them all in one net.* Especially Liang Cunhou, who had always endured silently and resigned himself to adversity, leaving the Political Security Bureau unable to grasp any leverage on him. If there wasn't hard evidence to punish him by law, it would inevitably invite public opinion of "burning the bridge after crossing the river." This was also why the Political Security Bureau had only monitored and never acted over these years.

As for those gentry and nobles flying like moths to the flame, it was a perfect opportunity to administer a thorough cleansing. The remaining gentry and big households, although not necessarily loyal to the Senate, would at least not be potential threats plotting rebellion.

After this sweep of blood and fire, the situation in Guangdong would be completely stabilized.

In comparison, knowing that "Old Stone" was Wang Yehao was conversely not a very urgent matter. After all, this Lord Wang didn't have much capital; he relied entirely on "Mr. Le" who came from unknown origins. As long as Mr. Le was eliminated, the Old Stone group would collapse without attack.

The primary work next was to catch this Zhou Lezhi. Whether he was a transmigrator, a body snatcher, or a disciple, catching him would naturally make it clear.
