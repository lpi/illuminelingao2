# Chapter 2732: The Capital (Part 88)

Hearing "open for business," everyone breathed a sigh of relief. In the end, one's livelihood was most important. If the boss dared to reopen, it meant he had at least six or seven parts confidence. Otherwise, being sealed by the authorities was actually best for him as the owner. Only the staff below and the depositors outside would suffer.

"Since the Grand Manager says so, we'll prepare and open as soon as the seal is lifted!" Assistant Manager Xiao was very enthusiastic.

Assistant Manager Wei added, "Master, it's already Little New Year. Shuntian Prefecture has sealed their official stamps. Though unsealing our shop is just a word from Lord Zhong, the shop should really open after the fifth day of the New Year. After welcoming the Five Gods of Wealth, we'll prepare plenty of firecrackers and set off half a street's worth. First, to show our strength; second, to dispel bad luck."

Leng Ningyun smiled. "Do as you suggest. Let's have a lively New Year and lift everyone's spirits."

"Before reopening, there are several important things to do." Leng Ningyun slowly surveyed everyone. "First, sort out the depositor accounts. List all accounts over 5,000 taels and all anonymous accounts using only hall names."

Accounts over 5,000 taels were major depositors. Anonymous accounts using only hall names were mostly private funds of officials' and nobles' family members.

The former often involved tens of thousands; the latter, though mostly only a few hundred taels, had great influence. So both needed special attention.

"After compiling the list, visit each one before we open," Leng Ningyun instructed. "The goal is simple: stabilize them!"

Each clerk had several such "key customers." The bank also had a special fund for "maintaining relationships." When Leng Ningyun spoke, everyone immediately understood his meaning.

"But when you visit, you absolutely must not say anything like 'our funds are tight, please delay your withdrawals'—don't even hint at that."

Everyone was silent. They had to visit but couldn't reveal their purpose. How to manage that?

Though they had some "rapport" with customers, that rapport was very shallow, built purely on commercial interests. Everyone understood which was more important—thousands of taels of silver or their trivial "rapport."

Suddenly someone spoke up: "How about this—I have a few ideas for everyone to consider..."

It was the clerk surnamed Zhou. He was ordinarily unremarkable at the bank—just a middling employee.

Leng Ningyun said, "Go on."

"It's the year-end now. After the Laba Festival, every household and shop needs money—it's peak withdrawal season. We were sealed by the authorities recently, weren't we? Rather than wait for customers to crowd at the door demanding their money when we open, why not approach them proactively before we open? For merchants, tell them it's year-end, and because of the recent government seal, we couldn't open. If they need withdrawals, please give us a figure so we can prepare in advance."

This was a common practice during the three major festivals when funds were tight—for banks to give advance notice. It wasn't unusual.

"...Second, for those anonymous private deposit accounts that normally receive monthly interest—this month the shop was closed and couldn't pay on time. We'll calculate the interest, including an advance on next month's interest, and present it to them. Ask if they want cash or banknotes. Whatever they want, whichever house's notes they want, we'll pay immediately."

"Mm-hmm." Leng Ningyun nodded approvingly.

"When we proactively deliver silver, they'll probably ask about Delong's closure. I think we might as well take this opportunity to reveal something about the Master's kidnapping. First, it dispels the rumor that 'Delong is rebel property'—if it were rebel property, why seal it only to reopen? Second, that major bandits specifically kidnapped the Master shows he's the 'God of Wealth' in the capital. And that the Master returned safely demonstrates his power and capabilities in the capital."

As long as they stabilized the major depositors, scattered small depositors running on the bank would be no concern.

After the meeting, Leng Ningyun gave his final instructions and returned to the inner residence. It was already evening. Normally near New Year, the inner residence would be decorated with lanterns and festoons, fresh flower pots, New Year paintings, and new peachwood charms. But after Leng Ningyun's kidnapping, Hexiang and Yanhong, who managed the inner residence, had no heart for New Year preparations. Nothing had been done. The residence was cold and cheerless, without a trace of New Year atmosphere.

Hexiang and Yanhong received him at the inner gate. They hadn't seen each other for many days. Earlier, there had been only a fleeting glimpse; now, looking closely, both women looked haggard and worn. Yanhong even had a few strands of white hair.

So "turning white overnight" wasn't entirely an exaggeration.

Seeing him arrive, both women smiled and came forward to greet him.

"The Master hasn't had dinner yet, has he?" Yanhong asked. "Where shall dinner be served?"

"In the main room," Leng Ningyun said. "After the inner gate closes for the night, when Mister Wu, Mister Liu, or the two escort masters from Heliansheng call, let them through immediately, without delay."

"I'll give the order." Yanhong, who managed the inner residence's household affairs, immediately responded.

When they reached the bright room of the main building, dinner was already prepared. Though he'd rested for two days at the mule-and-horse inn, he'd been imprisoned for many days. Yanhong feared his stomach was weak, so the dishes were light. On the table were only four items: a large bowl of silver ear and bird's nest soup, a steamed egg custard, a plate of yam and pine nut and walnut cake, and a platter of steamed stuffed tofu.

Yanhong served him a bowl of bird's nest soup first. Leng Ningyun drank a few sips—not too hot or cold, sweetness just right, very pleasant. Since being kidnapped, he hadn't eaten such refined food for many days. One bowl down, he felt warmth return to his organs. Then came a rumble from his stomach—so loud both women heard it.

Hexiang smiled behind her hand. "This Wu Kaidi really doesn't know how to serve properly. These past days at the inn, what did he prepare for the Master?"

"Who had any appetite at the inn?" Leng Ningyun said. "Though I'd escaped danger, I was burning with anxiety." He took the rice Yanhong served him. "Now that things are settled, food actually has flavor." He ate a piece of stuffed tofu and smiled. "This stuffed tofu is wonderful—so versatile! Different fillings in a piece of tofu give different flavors, yet without losing the essential tofu taste."

Hexiang was pleased to hear him praise her work, and proud too. But she was more eager to know what Senator Leng planned to do next—after all, the Senate had been alerted, and apparently important Ming figures were involved. All this had to be reported.

Hexiang asked in Hakka, "Master, now that you're back, what do you plan to report..."

Leng Ningyun immediately shot her a look. Though using Hakka was safe—very few in the capital understood this dialect, and Yanhong, being from Beizhili, found Hakka as incomprehensible as a foreign language—still, speaking in dialect right in front of someone else was first, very rude, and second, might make Yanhong feel excluded.

A woman's heart was fathomless. Many small slights accumulated into resentment, and once that resentment became bitterness, it could be exploited by ill-intentioned people, causing incalculable damage.

He didn't respond to her question, only said, "I'm thinking of your salt-baked chicken—it's exceptional. Make it tomorrow."

"Yes, the Master enjoys it—nothing would make this slave happier." Hexiang realized her earlier action was quite inappropriate and quickly deflected.

But the three dining together obviously wasn't for reminiscing. Hexiang, as confidential secretary and telegraph operator, knew this perfectly well. So questions that needed asking still had to be asked—just without mentioning Lingao and the Senate.

"Outside, everyone's saying Delong probably won't open again. Some say the authorities will shut Delong down. Others say even if they don't, Delong is an empty shell—the silver was taken long ago by the Short... the Australians, and they'll collapse the moment there's a run..."

"Though these are rumors, they're not baseless. Our situation is indeed precarious." Leng Ningyun gave a general account of the external situation. "...Now I've thought of a decisive move. If it works, we can weather this crisis."

"And if it doesn't work?"

"If it doesn't, I'm afraid there'll be big trouble."

Hexiang and Yanhong's faces changed. Being around Leng Ningyun for a long time, they knew something about business and understood the consequences of a bank run. Moreover, this was the capital. Once a run became a panic, Shuntian Prefecture, the Five City Garrison, the Eastern Depot, and the Brocade Guard would all intervene. Delong would be devoured without even bones left!

Yanhong cautiously interjected, "You say we'll open when the market reopens, but including today, that's only six days. Master, while you're running around outside, what should we do at home?"

"Yes, whatever you need us to do, please just give the order."

Leng Ningyun thought: without someone like Felixue at his side, he couldn't take the "madam route," which was somewhat of a loss.

"No matter. Six days is enough to do a lot." Leng Ningyun said. "First is celebrating New Year."

"New Year?!" Both women were stunned. In this crisis, the Master's first thought was New Year.

"Yes, New Year." Leng Ningyun said. "I know you've been worried sick about me these days. Everyone's been in chaos, a scattered mess. Naturally, no one's had the heart to prepare for New Year, making this residence cold and cheerless. For people in business, this is a big taboo. Never mind outsiders—even Delong's people, the household staff, seeing this would feel disheartened themselves. How would they follow us?"

"I understand," Hexiang said. "We need to give people confidence."

"Exactly. In business, first you need credibility; second, confidence. If people see us disheartened ourselves, who would dare do business with us? Especially in the money trade like ours—we spend who knows how much on vain displays of face, all so people will say 'They have strength!' Otherwise, who would trust us with their real gold and silver?"
