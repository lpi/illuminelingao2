# Chapter 2732: The Capital (Part 88)

Hearing "open for business," everyone exhaled in relief. In the end, one's livelihood mattered most. If the boss dared to reopen, it meant he possessed at least six or seven parts confidence. Otherwise, remaining sealed by the authorities would actually have been best for him as the owner—only the staff below and the depositors outside would suffer.

"Since the Grand Manager says so, we'll prepare and open the moment the seal is lifted!" Assistant Manager Xiao declared with great enthusiasm.

Assistant Manager Wei added, "Master, it's already Little New Year. Shuntian Prefecture has sealed their official stamps. Though unsealing our shop requires only a word from Lord Zhong, we should really wait until after the fifth day of the New Year to open. After welcoming the Five Gods of Wealth, we'll prepare an abundance of firecrackers and set off half a street's worth. First, to demonstrate our strength; second, to dispel bad luck."

Leng Ningyun smiled. "Do as you suggest. Let's have a lively New Year and lift everyone's spirits."

"Before reopening, there are several important matters to address." Leng Ningyun slowly surveyed the room. "First, sort through the depositor accounts. Compile a list of all accounts exceeding five thousand taels and all anonymous accounts registered only under hall names."

Accounts over five thousand taels belonged to major depositors. Anonymous accounts using only hall names were mostly private funds belonging to the families of officials and nobles.

The former often involved tens of thousands; the latter, though mostly amounting to only a few hundred taels, wielded considerable influence. Both therefore required special attention.

"After compiling the list, visit each one before we open," Leng Ningyun instructed. "The goal is simple: stabilize them."

Each clerk had several such "key customers." The bank also maintained a special fund for "cultivating relationships." When Leng Ningyun spoke, everyone immediately grasped his meaning.

"However, when you visit, you absolutely must not say anything like 'our funds are tight, please delay your withdrawals'—don't even hint at that."

Everyone fell silent. They had to make these visits but couldn't reveal their purpose. How was that to be managed?

Though they had cultivated some "rapport" with customers, that rapport was exceedingly shallow, built purely on commercial interests. Everyone understood which weighed more—thousands of taels of silver or their trivial "rapport."

Suddenly someone spoke up: "How about this—I have a few ideas for everyone to consider..."

It was the clerk surnamed Zhou. He was ordinarily unremarkable at the bank—just a middling employee.

Leng Ningyun said, "Go on."

"It's year-end now. After the Laba Festival, every household and shop needs money—it's peak withdrawal season. We were sealed by the authorities recently, were we not? Rather than wait for customers to crowd at our door demanding their money when we open, why not approach them proactively beforehand? For merchants, tell them it's year-end, and because of the recent government seal, we couldn't open. If they need withdrawals, please give us a figure so we can prepare in advance."

This was common practice during the three major festivals when funds ran tight—for banks to provide advance notice. It was nothing unusual.

"...Second, for those anonymous private deposit accounts that normally receive monthly interest—this month the shop was closed and couldn't pay on time. We'll calculate the interest, including an advance on next month's interest, and present it to them. Ask if they want cash or banknotes. Whatever they prefer, whichever house's notes they request, we'll pay immediately."

"Mm-hmm." Leng Ningyun nodded approvingly.

"When we proactively deliver silver, they'll likely ask about Delong's closure. I think we might as well seize this opportunity to reveal something about the Master's kidnapping. First, it dispels the rumor that 'Delong is rebel property'—if it were rebel property, why seal it only to reopen? Second, that major bandits specifically kidnapped the Master shows he's the 'God of Wealth' in the capital. And that the Master returned safely demonstrates his power and capabilities here."

As long as they stabilized the major depositors, scattered small depositors running on the bank would pose no concern.

After the meeting concluded, Leng Ningyun gave his final instructions and returned to the inner residence. Evening had already fallen. Normally near New Year, the inner residence would be decorated with lanterns and festoons, fresh flower pots, New Year paintings, and new peachwood charms. But following Leng Ningyun's kidnapping, Hexiang and Yanhong, who managed the inner residence, had lost all heart for New Year preparations. Nothing had been done. The residence felt cold and cheerless, devoid of any festive atmosphere.

Hexiang and Yanhong received him at the inner gate. They hadn't seen each other for many days. Earlier, there had been only a fleeting glimpse; now, looking closely, he saw both women appeared haggard and worn. Yanhong even had a few strands of white threading through her hair.

So "turning white overnight" wasn't entirely an exaggeration.

Seeing him arrive, both women smiled and came forward to greet him.

"The Master hasn't had dinner yet, has he?" Yanhong asked. "Where shall dinner be served?"

"In the main room," Leng Ningyun said. "After the inner gate closes for the night, when Mister Wu, Mister Liu, or the two escort masters from Heliansheng call, let them through immediately, without delay."

"I'll give the order." Yanhong, who managed the inner residence's household affairs, responded at once.

When they reached the bright room of the main building, dinner was already prepared. Though he'd rested for two days at the mule-and-horse inn, he'd been imprisoned for many days prior. Yanhong feared his stomach had grown weak, so the dishes were light. On the table sat only four items: a large bowl of silver ear and bird's nest soup, a steamed egg custard, a plate of yam, pine nut, and walnut cake, and a platter of steamed stuffed tofu.

Yanhong served him a bowl of bird's nest soup first. Leng Ningyun drank a few sips—neither too hot nor too cold, the sweetness perfectly balanced, very pleasant. Since being kidnapped, he hadn't tasted such refined food in many days. One bowl down, he felt warmth returning to his organs. Then came a rumble from his stomach—so loud that both women heard it.

Hexiang smiled behind her hand. "This Wu Kaidi really doesn't know how to serve properly. These past days at the inn, what did he prepare for the Master?"

"Who had any appetite at the inn?" Leng Ningyun said. "Though I'd escaped danger, I was burning with anxiety." He accepted the rice Yanhong served him. "Now that things are settled, food actually has flavor." He ate a piece of stuffed tofu and smiled. "This stuffed tofu is wonderful—so versatile! Different fillings in a piece of tofu yield different flavors, yet without losing the essential tofu taste."

Hexiang was pleased to hear him praise her work, and proud too. But she was more eager to learn what Senator Leng planned to do next—after all, the Senate had been alerted, and apparently important Ming figures were involved. All this had to be reported.

Hexiang asked in Hakka, "Master, now that you're back, what do you plan to report..."

Leng Ningyun immediately shot her a look. Though using Hakka was safe—very few in the capital understood this dialect, and Yanhong, being from Beizhili, found Hakka as incomprehensible as a foreign tongue—still, speaking in dialect right in front of someone else was first, quite rude, and second, might make Yanhong feel excluded.

A woman's heart was fathomless. Many small slights accumulated into resentment, and once that resentment curdled into bitterness, it could be exploited by ill-intentioned people, causing incalculable damage.

He didn't respond to her question, only said, "I'm thinking of your salt-baked chicken—it's exceptional. Make it tomorrow."

"Yes, the Master enjoys it—nothing would make this slave happier." Hexiang realized her earlier action had been quite inappropriate and quickly deflected.

But the three dining together obviously wasn't for reminiscing. Hexiang, as confidential secretary and telegraph operator, knew this perfectly well. So questions that needed asking still had to be asked—just without mentioning Lingao and the Senate.

"Outside, everyone's saying Delong probably won't open again. Some say the authorities will shut Delong down. Others say even if they don't, Delong is an empty shell—the silver was taken long ago by the Australians, and they'll collapse the moment there's a run..."

"Though these are rumors, they're not baseless. Our situation is indeed precarious." Leng Ningyun gave a general account of the external situation. "...Now I've conceived a decisive move. If it works, we can weather this crisis."

"And if it doesn't work?"

"If it doesn't, I'm afraid there'll be serious trouble."

Hexiang and Yanhong's faces changed. Having been around Leng Ningyun for a long time, they knew something about business and understood the consequences of a bank run. Moreover, this was the capital. Once a run became a panic, Shuntian Prefecture, the Five City Garrison, the Eastern Depot, and the Brocade Guard would all intervene. Delong would be devoured without a single bone left.

Yanhong cautiously interjected, "You say we'll open when the market reopens, but including today, that's only six days. Master, while you're running around outside, what should we do here at home?"

"Yes, whatever you need us to do, please just give the order."

Leng Ningyun thought: without someone like Felixue at his side, he couldn't take the "madam route," which was somewhat of a loss.

"No matter. Six days is enough to accomplish a great deal." Leng Ningyun said. "First is celebrating New Year."

"New Year?!" Both women were stunned. In the midst of this crisis, the Master's first thought was New Year.

"Yes, New Year." Leng Ningyun said. "I know you've been worried sick about me these days. Everyone's been in chaos, scattered and lost. Naturally, no one's had the heart to prepare for New Year, leaving this residence cold and cheerless. For people in business, this is a grave taboo. Never mind outsiders—even Delong's own people, the household staff, seeing this would feel disheartened themselves. How would they follow us?"

"I understand," Hexiang said. "We need to give people confidence."

"Exactly. In business, first you need credibility; second, confidence. If people see us disheartened ourselves, who would dare do business with us? Especially in the money trade like ours—we spend untold sums on vain displays of face, all so people will say 'They have strength!' Otherwise, who would trust us with their real gold and silver?"
