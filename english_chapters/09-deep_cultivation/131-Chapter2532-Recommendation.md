# Chapter 2532: Recommendation

"Oh, Yan Junyan?" Zhang Xiao stroked his small mustache. Based on his previous experience compiling historical materials, Yan Junyan was an honest man. He served as the Prefecture Judge in Guangzhou for four years and had a very close relationship with the Chen Zizhuang family. When Yan Junyan presided over the prefectural examination in the early Chongzhen years, he promoted Chen Zizhuang's younger brother, Chen Zisheng, to the top of the list. Many members of the Chen family were his students. Chen Zizhuang also commented in detail on Yan Junyan's *Combined Drafts of Mr. Yan Yanshu's Successive Victories* and funded its family block printing and publication in Guangdong around 1629. When *Surviving Letters of Mengshui Studio* was printed, Chen Zizhuang wrote the preface for it. Others who wrote prefaces included Han Rizuan, Minister of Rites; He Wuzou, Grand Secretary of the East Pavilion; Lu Zhaolong, Supervising Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel; Lu Ao, Prefect of Zhaoqing; and Wang Yinghua, Vice Commissioner of Surveillance. Li Le, Supervising Secretary of the Ministries of Personnel and Rites, wrote the introduction.

*It's a pity. In the muddy and turbid world, I stand alone; worrying about the country, there are truly few people here.* The turbid officialdom of the Great Ming could not tolerate honest people. By now, Yan Junyan had probably been dismissed and returned home, planting beans under the Southern Mountain.

However, there was still a slight problem here. He remembered Kuang Lu, a close friend in Chen Zizhuang's circle, who fled to Guangxi because he offended Huang Xiyin. Even Liang Yuanzhu's pleading was useless. Given Yan Junyan's relationship with the Chen Zizhuang family, his friendship with Kuang Lu must not be shallow. If Huang Xiyin was truly good friends with Yan Junyan, he should have been lenient towards Kuang Lu. So, this old boy's words were a mix of truth dry falsehood, real and empty; he still had to keep an eye out.

As for Huang Xiyin, he was also an old acquaintance. This person was not originally famous in history, but because of "persecuting Kuang Lu," his reputation became prominent. This person served as the Magistrate of Nanhai County for many years. If he could surrender, he would be more useful than the newly appointed Guangzhou Vice Prefect in front of him.

Thinking of this, Zhang Xiao asked: "Then was the empty tax exempted in the end?"

"Replying to the Chief, the Prefect originally agreed to report to the Imperial Court to strive for the exemption of the empty tax. However, it coincided with Wang Zunde's campaign against Lingao. The shortfall in military funds was quite large. Not only was it not exempted, but a few more *li* were added to the land tax of each county. The land to make up for it was not just Nanhai County, but involved the newly generated land of Xiangshan, Shunde, and other counties. Lamentably, that Wang Zunde did not know the military might of the Great Song and ended up with the egg broken and the chicken flown, losing his wife and his soldiers." Wei Bifu couldn't help but sigh.

*Wocao!* Zhang Xiao secretly roasted in his heart. *So the military funds for Wang Zunde attacking Lingao back then came from here. This is all the Senate's money!*

He remembered something and asked, "Huang Xiyin was originally the Magistrate of Nanhai County. Where did he go when Guangzhou was recovered?"

Wei Bifu had been holding onto this matter for a long time. Why? Because Huang Xiyin did not "commit suicide" as most Senators thought. In fact, in the official archives, he was recorded as "whereabouts unknown."

Huang Xiyin did not commit suicide, nor did he formally surrender. Instead, taking advantage of the chaotic situation at the beginning of Guangzhou's recovery, he quietly hid in the countryside, preparing to find a way to return to his hometown after the wind calmed down. However, because the border was closed and he had family members, he couldn't leave even if he wanted to. Seeing that the Australian rule had been stable for more than two years, and his family was eating through their resources in the countryside and gradually couldn't get by, Huang Xiyin had the idea of "coming out of retirement."

It was just that coming out now was somewhat awkward; the Australians would inevitably feel his "motives were impure." Huang Xiyin thought about it and could only ask Wei Bifu, an "old acquaintance." After all, among the original Guangzhou officials who surrendered, his rank was the highest, and he was getting along quite well with the Australians now. Moreover, their friendship back then was not bad.

Wei Bifu was greatly shocked to see Huang Xiyin again after more than two years, thinking he had seen a ghost. After the reunion and a long talk, he finally learned that this Magistrate Huang also intended to "change strings and tracks."

"Brother Huang, isn't not that I'm lecturing you, but when the grand army entered the city two years ago, you should have just surrendered to the Senate with me! Now that more than two years have passed, you surrendering again..."

When Liu Xiang first entered the city, he employed all surrendering personnel as long as they had no major "historical problems." Although they generally weren't given substantive positions, they were at least given the title of Councilor and a monthly travel allowance, ensuring the whole family didn't worry about food and drink.

Going to defect now, leaving aside the suspicion of "opportunism," the Senate's rule in Guangdong was greatly stabilized, so whether they were willing to employ him again was a question.

"It was just this Little Brother being confused for a moment!" Huang Xiyin said, "Please, Elder Brother, mediate for me." After speaking, he presented a gift.

The gift was a set of fine gold head ornaments. Wei Bifu couldn't bear to part with this fine set of head ornaments, and thinking that Huang Xiyin had friendship with him back then, he agreed fully.

Although he agreed, this matter was not easy to handle. Wei Bifu had been waiting for an opportunity. Now that the Chief asked, it was a good opportunity!

"Master Huang did not commit suicide. He just feared the chaos of war, so he took his family to live in seclusion in the Nanhai countryside."

"Hid?"

"Exactly." Wei Bifu smiled. "He was also unwilling to go to the Ming State, so he spent his days farming and studying in the Nanhai countryside."

"How do you know?" Zhang Xiao suddenly asked.

"Some days ago, this student went to the countryside and met him in Jiujiang Town. At that time, this student was also startled, thinking I had bumped into a ghost in broad daylight."

"Haha, so that's how it is. I thought he was dead!" Zhang Xiao thought, *having this person is even better! And since he didn't commit suicide or go north, it's obvious he has the heart to "surrender to the Kun." Maybe he even specially came to ask this Councilor Wei in front of me. This is really sending a pillow when sleeping—coming at the right time.* He immediately said:

"In that case, I trouble you to make a trip for me. Say I intend to hire him as a Councilor of Guangzhou Prefecture to advise me in Nanhai."

"The Chief commands; this student naturally obeys!" Wei Bifu was secretly happy. He didn't expect this matter to be handled so easily! It seemed Chief Zhang really wanted to achieve something in Nanhai. "This student will set off to handle this matter tomorrow!"

"Mn, tell him not to have concerns. Since he is willing to come out, he should honestly handle errands for the Senate. If he is unwilling, I won't force him; let him stay in the countryside and be a law-abiding good citizen."

"Yes, yes, this student understands."

"However, since he is still in the countryside, I can only continue to trouble Councilor Wei to continue explaining this word 'Difficult' to me."

Wei Bifu thought that his response just now must have satisfied this new Chief quite a bit, so he stood up and said: "Guangdong lies at the intersection of barbarians and outskirts. Wild bandits are rampant, relying on mountains and blocking the sea, often initiating theft. There have always been many great bandits in Guangdong, and the atmosphere isn't peaceful. Merchants trading in Guangdong almost always fill the bellies of brokers; in small cases they lose their capital, in big cases they lose their lives. Therefore, Lingnan was previously regarded as a place of profit, but now it has become a ghost country. There were once six criminals like Li Yachao, gathering a gang and driving boats, killing people in broad daylight, robbing government messengers, killing and drowning three gatekeepers at the tower camp in broad daylight, and looting the assets of seventeen people. The thieves robbed from Qingyuan, went down via Sanshui, and no one dared to ask when they passed, until Shizhou Danxia where they were captured. The provincial capital is a place where people from five directions mix. Stick-wielding scoundrels from other provinces refer to names and colors [gangs/titles], secretly occupying local areas to cause trouble, and once reported, they scatter like birds and beasts; the government often cannot question them. Guangdong's terrain brings mountains and embraces the sea; the caves are most dangerous. The desolate and illusionary lands of sand islands have traces hard to fathom. Therefore, for decades, there have been demons establishing titles in the mountains and bandits raising flags on the sea..."

Speaking of this, Wei Bifu stopped. He suddenly realized that the Australians were also once the great bandits in his mouth.

"What's wrong? Continue." Zhang Xiao felt puzzled by Wei Bifu's behavior.

Wei Bifu looked a bit nervous, secretly glanced at Zhang Xiao's expression and saw nothing strange, then continued: "People cannot rest peacefully in sleep; merchants cannot go out on roads. Circling the mountains to the north, following the sea to the south, it is all pits and moats, totally boiling over."

"In your opinion, what is the cause?"

"The previous dynasty's sea ban was very strict. Provision ships entering and exiting must be checked by Xiangshan, must submit forms to the Municipal Office; there was no reason for obscure berthing. Yet over a thousand ocean thieves burst into the inland rivers. The local soldiers, sentries, and Municipal Office officials, seeing profit and forgetting harm, acted in collusion; this is bandits colluding with the government. There are also officials participating in smuggling. Because there are many bandits in Guangdong, some use catching bandits as a name to peel the skin of small people and suck the marrow of small people. They use the Yamen militia to point out bandits and incite bandits, implicate and blackmail, harbor and slaughter for extortion, fabricate accusations to cheat and harm—using every extreme method. Thirdly, bankrupt small people increase daily, turning into bandits. Official governance becomes dirtier daily, people's livelihood becomes harder daily. Looking for people to litigate but litigants are fewer daily; avoiding talk of bandits yet bandits are more daily. Seeking the cause, it is because local officials change robbery to theft to avoid punishment, intending to choose the light over the heavy to barely avoid impeachment. Not knowing that criminals who committed crimes deserving beheading or strangling only get sentences of exile, what scruples do they have? No wonder the more they hide bandits, the more bandits there are. As for the plot of using bandits to close cases, it is especially cunning: when a robbery case occurs, they implicate bandits from several cases to fill it; when one criminal arrives at court, they accumulate several cases before and after to enter it. Either instructing clerks to induce confessions or bailiffs to coerce and frighten. To the prisoner, it is death either way; admitting more or less adds nothing to the crime, so it's better to accept several cases to avoid whipping. The officials are happy to succeed in their scheme. They don't know that while officials can avoid punishment, thieves can also avoid investigation and arrest. What is especially strange is that families who are robbed do not report the case, using the excuse of ignorance. Once reported and waiting for investigation, it moves the demand for laborers and horses. If you want to satisfy their desires, then there is no leftover wealth after the robbery; if you don't give what they ask, they don't report based on facts. No wonder robbed families add bitterness to bitterness, swallow their voices and endure anger, unwilling to report to officials. And officials are exactly happy they don't report, thinking one less reported case avoids the burden of one case. How do they know that while the official has one less burden of a case, the people have the burden of countless robbery cases?"

Wei Bifu's answer satisfied Zhang Xiao. Prefectural and county officials hoped common people would fight lawsuits because officials and clerks could gain benefits from civil lawsuits. But robbery cases were criminal cases; many robbery cases meant poor local public security, which not only affected the official's reputation but could even lead to impeachment. Therefore, looking for people to litigate but litigants were fewer daily; avoiding talk of bandits yet bandits were more daily.

With the Senate's experience in suppressing bandits in Hainan, they would clarify the bandit's background information through long-term investigation before formal action. For example, before the first county-wide bandit suppression in Lingao, the Intelligence Committee had figured out the bandit situation in the whole county: thirty-eight bandit gangs with more than fifty people active long-term; seven with more than one hundred people. This did not include many home-based bandits who farmed usually and acted as bandits when things happened. Moreover, they strove to knock out criminal gangs at once to avoid falling into a boundless public security war.
