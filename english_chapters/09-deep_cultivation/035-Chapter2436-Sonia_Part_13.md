# Chapter 2436: Sonia (XIII)

"This gentleman's idea is quite good," Sonia said. "A small zoo, collecting those rare animals. This is an excellent idea!"

Collecting rare animals was also a small hobby of European upper class society from the 17th to 19th centuries. However, raising animals was even more difficult than making specimens. Rare birds and exotic beasts obtained with great difficulty, sent through countless hardships to nobles' courts and mansions, often died not long after being kept. At the time, there was no zoo science or systematic veterinary medicine, no experience whatsoever in artificially raising wild animals—mortality rates were very high. Even African lions, standard equipment for modern zoos, were difficult to keep alive in this era.

After arriving in Lingao, having seen all sorts of Australian "miracles," Sonia naturally felt the Australians must have unique expertise in raising animals too.

Then Senator Du mentioned in the letter that he had already "privately commissioned" VOC and BEIC merchants to collect rare birds and beasts from trading destinations during their commerce. After they arrived, the purchase funds would be personally borne by him, but he needed the museum's help with making specimens and raising them.

"Such generous donations we naturally accept with utmost gratitude..."

Ju Wenyi couldn't help reminding her: "Making specimens is easy to say, but raising animals—doesn't that need Senate approval? Where would we get the budget?"

"Oh, right, right, I forgot." Only then did Sonia remember she was just a researcher. The executive director was Cui Yunhong.

"Xiaowen, help me draft a reply. The gist is thanking him for his letter. I think this matter is very good. But it needs Senate approval. Otherwise we cannot accept animal husbandry—we also don't have dedicated animal keepers. All this needs to be applied to the Senate. Making specimens is no problem, as long as the animals he sends are suitable."

Ju Wenyi agreed, noting the key points in her pocket notebook. Sonia stretched her body: "I'm heading home. The wrap-up work is yours."

"Go ahead. The baby is waiting."

"She—she's not waiting for me at all. She's already weaned." Though Sonia said this, she still quickly packed up her bag and left.

Ju Wenyi and Ju Wenjing began tidying up the research room. Because no work had been done in the research room today, cleaning was easy. The two quickly finished work. The wall clock had already passed 6:30.

"Let's go eat."

The Natural History Museum had a very small establishment with no cafeteria. Naturalized citizen staff were issued meal subsidies to eat outside on their own. Fortunately, there were very many naturalized citizens earning wages locally, forming a large salaried class. A very developed tertiary industry had developed around them. The food service industry satisfying the most basic need of eating was rich and colorful in Lingao—the world's best, one could say.

These two "apprentices" working at the Natural History Museum, on the Senate's payroll, had an official rank of Administrative Level 14 Staff—the lowest level staff, receiving the lowest Level 29 salary. But as single women with no parents to support above and no children to raise below, living in "civil servant collective dormitories" without needing to pay rent, every penny they earned was their own to spend. Naturally, they wouldn't shortchange themselves on food.

"Today I want to eat something good. Go to the usual place?"

"Let's go to the usual place. But I want a different set meal—not grilled fish, I want meat!"

"I can't afford meat."

"My treat. Braised pork belly set meal!"

...

Although they had no blood relation, having been given these twin-style names and working, studying, and living together, they had naturally formed a best-friend relationship. If the Senate didn't prohibit sworn kinship, they would probably have sworn sisterhood.

Chatting and laughing while packing their things and about to leave together, Cuixi appeared.

"Where are you... going?" Cuixi had been in Lingao for quite a while, but his Mandarin was still halting.

"To eat. Why—you coming too?" Ju Wenjing teased. "Chief Cui gives you lots of pocket money, right?"

"Pocket money? Not little." Cuixi scratched his head, not understanding why she'd mention his pocket money. He still couldn't understand the joking tone. "But I'm not going to eat, and I'm not treating."

"Who asked you to treat, miser!" Ju Wenyi said.

"Senator Cui, is calling you over."

The two exchanged glances. What could Chief Cui suddenly be calling them for?

With anxious hearts, the two came to Cui Yunhong's office. The office had not only Chief Cui but also a man they didn't know.

"This is Senator Wang," Cui Yunhong introduced. "He currently works at the Nanyang Company. Do you know about the Nanyang Company?"

The two nodded. They certainly knew. People from that company had come to the Natural History Museum just a few days ago, requesting access to examine some mineral specimens.

But this person was actually a Chief? Looking at his clothes, he seemed no different from ordinary cadre staff.

"Senator Wang plans to transfer some people from our Natural History Museum to work at the Nanyang Company—he wants to understand some situations from you. This is a normal 'background check.' You can answer truthfully without any concerns. The interview records are confidential. Understand?"

"Yes, Chief." The sisters nodded immediately.

Wang Kai greeted them with a smile: "My name is Wang Kai. I've already learned about your situations from Comrade Cui Yunhong. Both young and promising, I must say." He looked at his watch. "It's very late today—I've delayed your dinner. How about this—my treat for dinner, and we can talk while we eat."

A Senator wanted to treat them to dinner alone! Ju Wenyi and Ju Wenjing couldn't help feeling flattered. It wasn't that they harbored any "wild ambitions of being selected by a Senator to become a life secretary"—just having eaten with a Senator was an honor naturalized citizen staff could brag about for a long time.

"We'll follow the Chief's arrangements," Ju Wenjing said.

Wang Kai had put considerable thought into how to investigate Sonia. He didn't want to ask the Political Security Bureau for help. Needless to say, Xiong Sang would certainly give him a comprehensive and thorough set of materials. But favors from the Political Security Bureau weren't to be casually owed. Just hearing Xiong Sang's single sentence—"We'll discuss these matters later"—was enough to make one puzzle for three or four days over what exactly it meant.

After much deliberation, he decided to do it himself. Fortunately, the Nanyang Company was currently recruiting. As a Nanyang Company executive, conducting background checks on future employees was at least justifiable. Using dinner as a cover for investigation would reduce suspicion.

The most common dining establishments for Senate cadres and staff were the "Public Cafeterias" found throughout the streets and alleys. Their grade was roughly equivalent to old-timeline box lunch shops: meat dishes paired with several vegetables, served with soup and rice or steamed buns. Lavish or frugal as you pleased. Didn't cost much and could fill you up.

The place Ju Wenyi and Ju Wenjing frequented wasn't a public cafeteria but a slightly higher-grade "set meal shop." The shop wasn't large. Besides fixed "set meals," there were also various drinking snacks, allowing for a few drinks.

Wang Kai followed their directions to this set meal shop. The shop wasn't crowded. He requested a booth-style private enclosure. Hearing they wanted meat, he generously ordered three double-combination roast meat set meals.

The sisters actually felt somewhat uneasy—the double roast meat set meal was one of the set meal shop's highest-grade options. Ju Wenjing said: "Chief, this is too extravagant."

"Not at all," Wang Kai said. "I'm taking up your dinner time. I won't be giving overtime pay—let you eat well at least."

"The Chief jokes," Ju Wenjing, being older and more experienced, said. "Chief, just ask whatever you want to know. Whatever we know, we'll tell you everything."

"Good. Let's talk after the food arrives." Wang Kai was fairly satisfied with this place. He had deliberately worn clothes commonly worn by naturalized citizen staff today to avoid attracting attention.

The roast meat set meal was quickly delivered. Roast goose and char siu double combination, served with white rice, a dish of vegetables, and a bowl of soup. Both delicious and good value.

"Eat, eat," Wang Kai said with a smile, while taking out a stack of documents from his bag. These were all Nanyang Company background check forms. Many naturalized citizen staff names were written—of course, these were all decoys. The one he really wanted to investigate was only Sonia.

Taking advantage of the two girls starting to eat and drink, their guard gradually relaxing, he ate a few bites casually and began questioning.

At first, he didn't ask about Sonia but about several ordinary museum staff. When questioning, his attitude was very casual—truly "talking while eating." The atmosphere was relaxed. Sometimes he'd crack a few small jokes, making the two girls giggle.

Seeing the atmosphere was right, he began shifting the conversation target to Senators' maids, asking about Valentina's situation.

"Her—her Chinese speaking is okay; reading and writing Chinese characters is basically blind," Ju Wenjing said. "Very good at painting."

"The person's a bit neurotic!" Ju Wenyi said.

Ju Wenjing glared at her. Ju Wenyi shrank her neck and said nothing more.

"It's fine, it's fine," Wang Kai thought the older one's vigilance was quite high. He said: "As I said earlier, these materials are all confidential. Besides, you as naturalized citizen staff honestly reporting issues to Senators is part of your duty. Nothing to be embarrassed about."

"Yes," Ju Wenyi hesitated for a moment, then said: "She, well, it's hard to say what's off about her. She's just especially lively, making a fuss about everything all day long, making faces when talking. When happy she laughs loudly; when unhappy she yells loudly—like having a mental episode."

"I think she's just too lively," Ju Wenjing quickly added. "She's actually quite nice. Once you get used to her way of talking, there's nothing strange about it. And when she's painting, she's not noisy at all."

Wang Kai pretended to scribble a few strokes on the paper, then asked:

"Has she ever said anything at the museum expressing dissatisfaction with the Senate or Senators?"
