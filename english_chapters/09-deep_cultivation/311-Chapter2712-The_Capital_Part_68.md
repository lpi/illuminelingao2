# Chapter 2712: The Capital (Part 68)

The Chongwen Gate of the capital was formerly called Wenming Gate, also known as "Hade Gate." Because the characters "Hade" were considered inelegant, literati often used the homophone "Haidai." After the Jingnan Campaign, Emperor Yongle Zhu Di moved the capital to Beiping and renovated the city walls. He extended the southern city wall outward, still opening Wenming Gate as a hub for boats, carts, and merchants. In the fourth year of Zhengtong, an outer barbican was added, and it was officially renamed Chongwen Gate. However, the common folk of the capital still called it Hade Gate.

In the thirty-first year of Jiajing, to strengthen the capital's defenses, an outer walled city (*Luo Cheng*) was added south of the capital. From then on, Chongwen Gate became an inner city gate. The newly built outer city covered a vast area; even through the end of the Qing Dynasty, there were still large tracts of farmland.

Chongwen Gate connected southward to the Grand Canal and eastward to Tianjin. Imperial tribute goods and daily necessities all entered through here. Being itself under the protection of the outer city wall, the market district around the gate area was especially prosperous.

The moat water was clear, with bridges over it and painted pleasure boats on it. Trees and flowers lined both banks. Green willows swayed in the wind, and red flowers invited the moon—thoroughly lovely. During the Ming Dynasty, it was even a scenic destination. Leaving through Chongwen Gate and crossing the moat, there was a dirt road not far away. It had no official name but was called Chongwenmen Outer Street after its location. In the Ming Dynasty, this was the capital's "Flower Market." Fresh flowers transported from Lugou Bridge, Caoqiao, and other places, along with various "imitation flowers" produced within the capital—paper flowers, silk flowers, velvet flowers, pith flowers...—all competed for attention here.

The Flower Market was held on every fourth day of the month. When Little Qian arrived at Chongwen Gate to meet his contact, it wasn't a market day, but the streets were still bustling. Farmers from the southern suburbs and within the outer city brought vegetables, fruits, chickens, ducks, and fish and shrimp harvested from various waters to sell here every day. Although this was technically inside the city, the tax checkpoint was at Chongwen Gate, so selling goods here meant merchants and farmers paid less tax.

Little Qian wasn't visiting the capital for the first time. Like Min Zhanlian, he was a *Jianghu* wanderer from the north and south. He was arrested and imprisoned during the "Parasol Umbrella" case. After suffering a bit in prison, he was recruited by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and became a member of the Special Operations Team. He was from Hejian Prefecture in Beizhili and had worked as a servant for others in the capital when young, so he was very familiar with the local customs. He had a baby face that made him look young; everyone called him "Little Qian," though he was actually in his mid-forties.

He set out early from Zhangjiawan, disguised as a servant from a wealthy household running errands, riding a rented healthy mule. He covered the sixty *li* in a day and entered the southern city towards evening, quietly taking lodging at an inn on Chongwenmen Outer Street.

Early the next morning, Little Qian changed his attire, disguised himself as an out-of-town peddler, and headed for the Juchun Garden Teahouse.

Chongwen Gate was both a tax checkpoint and a major thoroughfare. Inns, restaurants, teahouses, porter guilds, and cart-and-horse stables lined both sides of the street.

He arrived at the bridge outside the moat but didn't cross into the city. Instead, he walked east along the river. After just a few *li*, he saw a Daoist temple called Taiping Palace, commonly known among the people as Pantao Palace (Flat Peach Palace). The scenery around here was beautiful, a sightseeing destination of the capital. Since it was the depths of winter, there were few tourists, making it somewhat desolate. But the Juchun Garden Teahouse by the dirt road in front of the temple was still bustling with voices.

There were quite a few teahouses on this street, but this was the largest. The teahouse owner was also surnamed Qian—a renowned "ground worm" (*fudichong*, a local fixer) outside Chongwen Gate, familiar with both legal and underworld circles.

The teahouse was a two-courtyard compound. By the road stood a tall gate frame with a shop sign; below hung a row of green-painted wooden plaques with various famous teas written in ink: West Lake Longjing, Pre-Rain Maojian, Sparrow Tongue Cloud Slice... However, most people in the capital weren't particular about tea; these teas were more for show.

A rush-mat awning was set up here, with a dozen scattered tables and benches. On one side were two brick stoves—one constantly manned by a worker baking sesame flatbreads, the other holding two large copper kettles steaming away. Whenever the water boiled, a whistle sounded that could be heard down the street.

Past the open-air seating, the three-room main hall was the front room, with slightly more refined tables and chairs than outside—only people of some status sat there. As for the back room, that was the domain of scholars, elegant guests, and officials; ordinary people didn't go there.

Even though it was midwinter with biting wind, people still sat in the open-air seating. These were mostly laborers or passing peddlers, sitting by the stove's warmth to rest, drinking a bowl of hot tea and having a flatbread to fill their stomachs—all for very little money. They would fill their bellies and continue making a living.

Little Qian passed through the rush-mat awning, climbed the steps, and lifted the thick cotton door curtain. A wave of hot air mixed with sweat, incense, meat, and tea—all sorts of smells—hit him in the face. Immediately after came the clamor of voices, rushing into his ears like a tide.

He had just entered when a waiter came to greet him:

"The gentleman's face is new! Is this your first time at Juchun Garden? How many..."

Little Qian said unhurriedly, "Find me a quiet seat. A pot of jasmine tea, two cups. Also, bring two flatbreads." He tossed out a string of copper coins.

Teahouses had all sorts of people from all walks of life, so the waiter's eye was the sharpest of all. With one glance up and down, he already knew. He called out and led him to a single table in a corner near the back door.

Little Qian swept a glance. The three rooms of the front hall were already more than half full. Most people who came to teahouses to drink tea were like the drinker whose mind is not on wine. Some came to chat and kill time, some to discuss business, some to mediate disputes, act as go-betweens, arrange marriages, broker deals, or trade pawn tickets... The teahouse also had many people who made their living there every day: fortune-tellers, fruit sellers, traveling barbers, singers—all sorts, bizarre and colorful.

He filled both teacups with tea, slowly sipping the jasmine and eating the flatbread. He quietly observed the patrons in the hall and those coming and going. Teahouses were places where people came and went, dragons and fish mingling. The location of Juchun Garden meant most customers were passing travelers stopping to rest. Especially in these three front rooms—a place to set up tables and entertain all comers—his unfamiliar face wouldn't attract attention.

Before long, a cart driver wearing a felt hat and a sheepskin jacket walked over. He gave a slight bow and asked in a thick Shandong accent, "Are you the old customer who came to hire a cart yesterday?"

Little Qian nodded slightly. "You're from the cart service? I'm not traveling far; I need someone who knows the local roads well."

"Yes, exactly. Our outfit is Weiyuan," the cart driver bowed. "The capital prefecture's two counties and surrounding counties—we know all the roads."

"Wait for me a moment. Let me finish my tea and I'll come."

The cart driver said, "My cart is right outside. The one with the blue cloth cover and three copper coins on a red cord is mine." He then withdrew.

Little Qian didn't rush to leave. He sat a while longer. Then he saw the cotton curtain lift, and a middle-aged sturdy man entered. He wore a blue satin-bordered six-panel "Unity" felt hat with a fire-fox fur ear flap, a blue cloth straight robe with a padded gown over it, a black satin plank belt, and felt boots. His attire marked him as someone of standing.

As soon as he entered, the waiter called out, "Third Master Qin has arrived!"

Before the echo faded, a commotion arose in the shop. The various sorts seated at their tables stood up to greet him. Third Master Qin merely gave a general bow in return and didn't speak. His hawk-like eyes quickly swept over everyone in the front hall. Only then did he slowly pace with measured steps to an empty table in the center and sit down.

All the teahouse tables were large or small Eight Immortals tables—except this one, which was rectangular. It faced the main door of the hall. No matter how many patrons came and went, no one ever sat at this table. Little Qian knew this was a "horse-head table" (*matou zhuo*). Only the local "dragon head master" could sit here.

The waiter immediately brought over a pot of tea and two plates of southern fruits and candied plums.

Third Master Qin took a sip of tea and wiped his short beard. By now, people were already coming over to pay respects. Little Qian knew that this Third Master Qin was the local tyrant of the outer city. *Jianghu* newcomers had to pay respects at his pier before they could "do business."

While exchanging pleasantries, he asked the waiter attending him, "Where's Liu Xiaobian?"

"Replying to Your Lordship, he hasn't been to our shop for two days," the waiter said. "Several lords have asked for him; even his family came looking. He's probably drunk in some cheap brothel again."

"How disgraceful," Third Master Qin said. "A perfectly good job, barely managed to make something of himself, and doesn't cherish it. He's truly a hopeless case!"

He thought for a moment. "If he still doesn't come today, have Wu the Daoist Priest come find me tomorrow."

"Understood!" the waiter answered. Just as he turned to leave, Little Qian had already come up to the horse-head table with his teacup, smiling and cupping his hands. "Boss, please have tea!" As he spoke, his right thumb pressed the rim of the cup, two fingers supported the bottom, while his left thumb and index finger curved, and the other three fingers extended straight to touch the tip of his right elbow.

"Boss, please have tea."

Third Master Qin saw the newcomer was unfamiliar and knew he was a "colleague" from out of town. This was a routine pier visit. He picked up his teacup as well and made a token gesture, asking:

"May I ask your surname and what kind of celebration you seek?"

"I dare not presume. My humble surname is Qian. I run a small operation. Currently, I'm setting up a cookpot in Zhangjiawan in Tongzhou, and from time to time I come into the outer city to do some business. As a newcomer, I'd like to ask Third Master for guidance."

Third Master Qin raised an eyebrow slightly. "Normally I shouldn't block your fortune, but recently the weather's been bad—winds are fierce and rain sudden. Take care of yourself."

"Yes, thank you for the lesson, Third Master." Little Qian was very respectful.

"This is carved plum from the south, quite fancy. Try one."

"Thank you, Third Master." Little Qian ate a carved plum and said in a low voice, "In a day or two, I have something I'd like to consult Third Master about. Would you be available?"

"Just come find me here. If I'm not around, ask the waiter."

"Thank you, Third Master!" Little Qian respectfully retreated a few steps, then turned and left the teahouse.

Third Master Qin watched his back leave without paying too much attention. *Jianghu* people came to pay respects at the pier every day. Besides, his business was in Tongzhou, sixty or seventy *li* away. To be honest, there wasn't much big business to be done here in the outer city, and it wouldn't disturb the constables of Shuntian Prefecture.
