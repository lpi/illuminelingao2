# Chapter 2490: Burning the Building (Part 3)

Yang Cao said: "How long has he been inside?"

The scout said: "He has been in the residence for over four hours. Other cart drivers have already gathered, eaten, and left the residence, preparing for the return trip at the horse hitching post. But this person hasn't appeared yet. It's also possible he came out from the other two gates, but no report has been received yet."

Yang Cao said: "Pass a message again. Let Coral check this person; it might be a useful lead. In the future, don't let Coral check daily visits. Try to use peripheral personnel to reduce the number of Coral's actions and avoid exposure."

The scout said: "Yes."

Yang Cao said: "Is the map marked?"

The scout said: "Marked. We walked it personally once." Saying this, he handed over a regional map marking all alleys, entrances, exits, and paths within the surveillance range.

Yang Cao nodded with satisfaction and said: "Not bad. Is the character profile card done?"

The scout said: "We started doing it right after returning from identification. Just finished, haven't had time to distribute it yet." Saying this, he handed over a stack of small paper slips. The slips were copied in triplicate using carbon paper. Yang Cao looked quickly. Written on it was: Height eight *chi*, short beard, wearing an octagonal pointed bamboo hat, black hair color, gray coarse linen short jacket on upper body, gray coarse linen trousers on lower body, broad shoulders, thick neck, thin waist, wearing hemp shoes on feet, carrying a local white cloth bundle on back.

Yang Cao said: "Very good. Distribute to all surveillance team members immediately to facilitate tracking and identification..."

She had a good impression of this scout. Not many could do this boring work so neatly. She asked casually: "What is your name?"

"Report! Probationary Commander Zhang Jiabin!"

"Oh, this name is well given. Not of refugee background, right?"

"No," the scout was a bit nervous. "I am an immigrant. My old home is indeed in Guangdong, right in Shaoguan."

While the two were talking, the monitoring observer suddenly said: "He's out."

Hearing this, Yang Cao immediately walked quickly onto the observation platform and moved her eyes to the telescope. In the lens, a sturdy man stood in front of the small door beside the main gate, bowing to the household servant who sent him out and saying a couple of words.

At this moment, a patrol policeman carrying a baton passed by on patrol, slowly walking past that person and looking him up and down casually a few times. That person immediately stood aside carefully and respectfully, bowing with hands down by the roadside, watching the policeman slowly leave.

Yang Cao observed quietly. The moment the policeman appeared, that person's upper body shifted slightly backward. That indicated he unconsciously wanted to distance himself from the police. Immediately after, he faced his chest squarely toward the policeman. That was an animal instinct—hiding one's soft flank and facing the enemy with the front. His legs parted slightly; that was a display of hostility. Even a shrew shouting abuse in the street would put hands on hips and spread legs to show fierceness. His right heel lifted slightly; he was stabilizing his balance, and at the same time, the ball of his foot was ready to exert force to flee or attack at any time. That was not a posture of awe or respect, but vigilance and hostile readiness. A person could control their expression and tone, but it was hard to suppress subconscious physiological reactions.

Yang Cao let out a long breath and said: "This person has a problem. Stare at him."

Zhang Jiabin asked: "Ask the other two gates for support?"

Yang Cao said: "Too late. You stay on duty here, and at the same time try to call for support immediately. The other two will track. You—take the main tail (primary position). Him, take the vice tail (secondary position)." Saying this, she pointed to the two scouts standing beside her, then continued: "I will be the backup support. The carriage will follow up when needed. Start." The constraint of communication capabilities made it difficult for them to fully mobilize manpower to make perfect deployments and responses when facing sudden situations.

The two scouts nodded and said no more, quickly making preparations.

Yang Cao silently raised her head and looked out the window. This place involved too much of the Political Security Bureau's material resources, financial resources, and manpower. This made Director Zhao feel doubled pressure in Lingao. Some sarcastically said: Is the Political Security Bureau flush with funds or did they invest all funds into the entertainment business of Purple Cloud Tower? They can't even take down a local bully or bad gentry. Some clamored to audit the Political Security Bureau's fund flow. All the noise was pushed back by Director Zhao. They had to steady their minds and block out all the swaying wind and rain outside to stand firm. Anxiety would be the beginning of bad luck.

On the windowsill, a mantis held a locust with its sickle-like tibia, chewing methodically. The locust struggled in vain until it was completely swallowed. The mantis waved its forelimbs happily. For it, today was a good day.

Yang Cao was slightly nervous. Tracking missions usually required sufficient preparation beforehand. The more intelligence mastered, the higher the probability of success. Only by fully understanding the target's physical characteristics, activity area, scope of work, living habits, etc., could routes be planned and contingencies formulated in advance, and the tail recovered quickly when lost. Temporary tracking with few personnel and no support, once encountering counter-tracking, would be very difficult to succeed. But at this moment, Yang Cao had no choice.

Scout No. 1 followed secretly six or seven meters behind Qiaoyan, moving slowly along the right side of the street. Scout No. 2 followed five meters behind Scout No. 1. The three formed a column, moving slowly with the flow of people.

Yang Cao walked on the opposite side of the street, moving in the same direction as Qiaoyan along the left side, forming a triangle with Scouts No. 1 and No. 2. Her position was slightly behind Qiaoyan, allowing her to see Qiaoyan's back and also allowing Scout No. 1 to see her sideways with peripheral vision. Yang Cao gently raised her right hand to tuck her hair at the temple and adjusted her hairpin flower, signaling Scout No. 1 to move ahead and observe the target's appearance. Scout No. 1 immediately strode quickly past Qiaoyan, while Scout No. 2 walked a few steps faster, taking over Scout No. 1's main tail position.

Scout No. 1 stopped in front of a fruit stall ahead. Seeing a customer, the fruit vendor immediately beamed with joy and said: "Does this official want pears? My pears have no match on the whole street, sweet and juicy. How many does the official want?"

Scout No. 1 rummaged in the fruit basket twice and said: "Your pears are no good; they have worms. Can only sell them cheap."

The fruit vendor immediately became anxious and said: "Official, don't talk nonsense. I picked these out one by one; where are there worms?"

Scout No. 1 held up a pear, looking at it left and right. Just as they were arguing, Qiaoyan happened to walk close. Scout No. 1 quickly turned the hand holding the pear toward him, pointing at the pear and saying: "Look, look, right here is where the worm is." At the same time, his gaze swept over Qiaoyan's face following the pear in his hand. After Qiaoyan and Scout No. 2 walked past one after another, he threw the pear back into the basket, following behind Scout No. 2 to become the vice tail, leaving only the fruit vendor complaining dissatisfiedly behind him.

Yang Cao fell a few steps behind to approach Scout No. 1, probing him with her eyes. Scout No. 1 touched his headscarf gently and shook his head slightly, indicating that he didn't see the target's face because of the bamboo hat.

Qiaoyan walked slowly on the street, looking left and right from time to time, and constantly looking around. After walking for another quarter of an hour, Qiaoyan suddenly walked into a carriage agency called "Yuesheng." Seeing this, Yang Cao and the other two immediately dispersed, hiding their figures at street corners and storefronts outside the carriage agency, eyes tightly fixed on the agency's open front counter and exit, waiting quietly.

This Yuesheng Carriage Agency was newly opened, doing "Australian vehicle" business. It learned the Qiewei model. besides rickshaw rentals where pullers paid a daily fee, there was also long-distance carriage service, running land routes from the suburbs outside the city to neighboring counties, charging by the trip. Although not as comfortable as taking a boat, the speed was much faster than a boat. People with urgent matters often chose carriages.

The rule of this carriage agency was to place orders at the front counter and dispatch vehicles from the backyard. Qiaoyan talked with the dispatching manager at the front counter for a moment, then received a dispatch slip in duplicate at the front counter. Not long after, a passenger carriage came out from the backyard and stopped by the door. Qiaoyan boarded the carriage, lowered the carriage curtain and window curtains, and instructed the driver with a few words. The driver shook the whip tip, and the carriage pulled slowly, rolling away.

As soon as Qiaoyan left, Yang Cao immediately walked out of the street corner quickly, went directly to the carriage agency's front counter, and said to the dispatching manager: "Greetings, sir. Did you see my husband come to hire a carriage? He is eight *chi* tall, wearing a bamboo hat, coarse cloth clothes, and has a burly build."

The manager was stunned and said: "Oh, you just missed each other, one after another."

Yang Cao said hatefully: "This stubborn donkey temper! He came to the city to hand over an errand. I brought our son to stay with him at my parents' home in the city for a short stay. During lunch, my father disliked his shabby clothes and hat for losing face and said a few words. He threw a temper tantrum and couldn't stay for even a moment, immediately wanting to hire a carriage to go home. Where in the world is there such a donkey temper, leaving wife and son to go off by himself? What should we mother and son do?" After saying this, she covered her face with a handkerchief and sobbed low twice, then said: "I will also hire a carriage to chase him. It's just that a woman doesn't know the market price; I wonder how much silver it is?"

The manager said: "Madam, don't cry. I don't know where Madam wants to go? Only long-distance carriages are not cheap! If it's just to chase the carriage, I will dispatch a carriage right away. Whatever the fare is can be paid to the driver when you catch up. It's just that you need to prepay a deposit of two *jiao* here first—I will write a receipt for you. When convenient, bring the receipt to me for a refund; I definitely dare not short you."

Hearing this, Yang Cao exclaimed: "Why so expensive? Bullying a woman for not knowing the ways of the world? Let me see." Saying this, she came to grab the registry. The manager had no choice; after pulling back and forth a few times, he had to point it out to her, saying: "Don't grab, don't grab, don't tear the account book. My Yuesheng Carriage Agency treats children and old men honestly. If you don't believe me, look, Madam; your husband also hired the carriage at this price."

Yang Cao looked at the registry, instantly feeling a bit lacking in confidence, and said helplessly: "I, I don't have enough money on me. Sir, wait a moment; I'll get money and come back to hire the carriage."

The manager said: "Madam, please suit yourself." He cursed secretly in his heart: *Where did this crazy woman come from? No wonder the man ran away!*

Yang Cao walked out of the carriage agency. At this time, the Political Security Bureau's carriage had also caught up. Scout No. 2 gestured in front of the door, and the carriage stopped steadily at the corner ahead. Yang Cao ran quickly. Seeing no one paying attention, she boarded the carriage with an arrow step, lifted the front curtain, and said to the driver: "Go to Three Immortals Terrace (Sanxian Tai), take the North Gate."
