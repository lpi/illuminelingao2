# Chapter 2767: The Capital (Part 123)

However, he remembered what his master had said: the calmer it is, the more likely a storm is brewing. This strange tranquility seemed to reveal a certain weirdness.

Should he leave the Capital to avoid it?

Zhou Lezhi thought for a long time. It wasn't that he had nowhere to go. He returned to the Wang family estate in Jinhua every year, and it was now managed quite prosperously. The Wang family were local gentry, and the surrounding area was full of their tenant farmers. The estate raised dozens of house guards, all personally trained by his master back then, and later equipped with Nanyang rifles and pistols purchased specifically for them. It could be said to be a fairly safe place. But from here to Jinhua was a journey of thousands of miles, and the "thieves" had plenty of opportunities to intercept him halfway.

The Capital was, after all, at the foot of the Emperor, and the claws and teeth of various government offices were everywhere. No matter how powerful the "thieves" were, they couldn't act unscrupulously in the capital city. As long as he was careful and cautious, there shouldn't be major problems.

He didn't increase his guards; apart from Wang Zhi and Xu Yong, he had no one else around him. Liu Zhao had suggested he add more bodyguards, especially employing a few "heroes of the rivers and lakes" raised by the prince's estate, but he declined. Too many people would be too conspicuous and far removed from his identity as a "Divine Physician."

Now, because Liu Sha's whereabouts were unknown, he had even abandoned the identity of the Divine Physician. His public identity was just a scholar traveling for study in the Capital. Such people were countless in the Capital, so it was less likely to attract attention.

Now, he had no other choice but to lurk in the dark, waiting for the next opportunity.

Since Zhou Lezhi's visit, Qian Taichong had actually put the Emperor's summons to the back of his mind and devoted himself to planning the sugar factory. Making sugar had a large profit margin and high returns; it was a good way to make money quickly. Although he had to cooperate with the "thieves," it was a helpless move.

As for the "thieves" being a generational enemy, he couldn't care about that much now. Fortunately, the people around "Da Mu" (Big Wood) all looked to him as their leader, so the resistance was expected to be much smaller.

He also had an extra thought. If sugar was produced, it would mostly likely have to be sold to "thief merchants," and the bulk of the profit would still not be his. If he could bypass the "thieves" and ship it directly out of Fujian for sale, wouldn't he make a fortune? Especially since his activities in the Capital this time had yielded great results, if he could ship the sugar directly to the Capital...

But then he thought again, shipping bulk goods out of Anping left no other option but sea transport. In the end, he still couldn't bypass the "thieves."

If the "thieves" didn't allow Zheng's ships to sail, no matter how much sugar he made, he could only sell it to the "thief merchants."

The "thieves" had implemented a comprehensive blockade of Zhangzhou Bay; only ships flying their command flag could enter or leave. Anyone could apply for a command flag, except for members of the original Zheng Group.

This was tantamount to choking off the Zheng family's trade routes. The various factions that had split from the Zheng Group, in order to avoid being completely strangled, had to change their banners, "selling" the ships under their names to agents, who then applied for the flags.

Although this "skin-changing" trick could fool the "thieves," the price of the command flag was not cheap. The "thieves" also implemented a "Merchant Ship Home Port Registration" system. If Zhangzhou Bay ports were used as the home port, the registration fee was surcharged by twenty percent. To save this twenty percent, home ports were registered in other places one after another.

Over time, the various bosses of the original Zheng Group gradually realized that they had lost direct control over their subordinate ships. Maritime merchants mostly raised "adopted sons" as agents for overseas trade. Now, the "thieves'" policy made these "adopted sons" the owners of the ships and command flags under the maritime order of the Senate. If everything was peaceful, it wouldn't matter, but if there were any storms or accidents, these ships would instantly have nothing to do with them!

Although they had realized this, they could not change reality. Qian Taichong saw things clearly as a bystander and knew exactly what was happening.

Thinking it over, when the time came, he could only bite the bullet and use the "agent" method. Fortunately, people like Tong Tailang were quite reliable and could be entrusted.

As long as the ship could sail out, it could make money. As for how the money was earned, that was another matter. Right now, Qian Taichong had to make sure the entire group survived first. Whether it was Matos's black mercenaries or Tong Tailang's Japanese samurai, they couldn't be maintained by the word "loyalty" alone.

If the Zheng family could be revived, enduring a moment of grievance wouldn't matter.

It was just that, even if his side was willing to bow their heads, how could they get the "thieves'" sugar factory? He had been Enemies with the "thieves" for years and could be counted as one of the rare "Know-Thief" personages, but he had really never paid attention to things like sugar factories. Mr. Le had mentioned that the "thieves" would periodically auction equipment, but one had to go to Guangzhou...

While he was letting his imagination run wild, the manager of the guild hall suddenly came to report: "There are guests outside coming to visit."

The guests who came to visit were none other than the Imperial Guard officers who had taken him away not long ago. However, this time they were much more polite. Not only did they bow, but they also addressed him as "Master." They invited him into a small sedan chair.

The sedan chair was lifted, and the bearers walked as fast as the wind. In the dim darkness, he didn't know how far they went. When he got out of the sedan chair, he was in a narrow passageway with flying eaves and red walls; it was obviously inside a palace.

Qian Taichong dared not speak and waited outside the sedan chair. A moment later, two eunuchs indeed came and led him to a palace hall to kneel and wait.

He knew that the person meeting him must be the Emperor. The last time he was told to "stay in the guild hall and not leave the Capital," it meant the Emperor would summon him again. At this moment, his mood was both fearful and happy.

In the last summons, the Emperor's interest was mostly on the "thieves," and he didn't express much regarding the Zheng family. However, since the Emperor had a great interest in the "thieves," utilizing this general trend of "Anti-Thief" to have the Emperor support Zheng Sen was currently the most feasible method.

He remembered Mr. Le's words and calculated silently in his heart several times before he heard footsteps outside. He quickly put on a respectful appearance, waiting for the Emperor's arrival.

The sound of boots tap-tapping was heard as someone passed by. At this moment, a young eunuch reminded softly: "Audience time!" Qian Taichong hurriedly stood up, announced his name, entered, and knelt and bowed according to the rituals.

Since Emperor Chongzhen summoned Yang Sichang, he had accepted in his heart the suggestion that "to resist foreign aggression, one must first pacify the interior." He adopted a defensive posture in both the north and south directions, focusing all efforts internally to exterminate the "Roving Bandits."

On the Eastern Barbarian (Manchu) front, due to the outstanding performance of Sun Yuanhua and the Dengzhou Army recently, the situation had gradually stabilized. The Manchus invaded Korea last year, and although it gave the Korean court and public a huge shock, once forcing them into the desperate situation of abandoning Hanseong (Seoul), they eventually returned without success due to the active operations of the Dengzhou Army commanded by Sun Yuanhua—saving Ganghwa Island first, then Namhansanseong, and fighting three battles at the Yalu River. Korea remained a vassal of the Great Ming.

If they couldn't take Korea, the Manchus' eastern flank would be unstable. The Imperial Court's defense line in the Ning-Jin area was basically unimpeded. As for the "thieves" in the south, although they had taken Guangdong and Guangxi, they stopped at the Five Ridges and did not advance. Currently, there were no major battles on either the northern or southern lines. It was a great opportunity to exterminate the Roving Bandits.

But on the southern front, there was a relatively large hidden danger. The combat power of the "thieves" was extremely strong, and they often won with fewer numbers in many fierce battles. The government troops were mostly no match for them. Without heavy troops, they could not be suppressed. Unfortunately, after the fall of Guangdong and Guangxi, the Imperial Court's heavy troop groups in the south had been exhausted. Jiangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Fujian provinces were either empty of troops or internally unstable themselves, unable to bring out any decent army to "defend." Although Fu Zonglong was a capable official who knew military affairs and had several battalions under his command as the Governor of Southern Gan, compared to the long battle line and the illustrious combat power of the "thieves," it felt somewhat insufficient. If the "thieves" came to attack, the so-called defense line would be nothing more than a sheet of thin paper.

If they wanted to build a new heavy troop group like the Guan-Ning Army on the Ning-Jin line, the Imperial Court would surely go bankrupt.

Therefore, how to "do more with less money" became the most important topic before the Emperor and the Grand Secretaries. "Recruitment and Amnesty" (Pacification) was obviously the cheapest and most realistic choice.

Of course, the Emperor was quite hesitant about this matter of pacification. After all, the Manchus and the "thieves" were "Giant Bandits" who had "split the earth and established titles." No matter what the specific conditions of pacification were, the Imperial Court and he himself would lose face. Especially for Chongzhen, who had always diligently sought to be a "Sage Monarch," it was psychologically difficult to accept. In particular, there were many ministers in the court and the public who opposed pacification. Once the rumors of pacification leaked out, the Emperor couldn't be sure how many people would violently oppose it.

Although he was a "Sage Monarch exercising sole discretion," and no matter how violently the courtiers opposed, they couldn't shake his administrative intent. But the young Emperor valued the "reputation" given to him by the court ministers more than his ancestors did. He would often hesitate before major measures.

For this "pacification," he was also taking it one step at a time. He had revealed a little of his thoughts to the ministers of the Grand Secretariat. Judging from their ambiguous responses during the summons, either they didn't fully understand his meaning, or they were deliberately playing dumb.

"These pedants, not one is willing to share the slander for the Sovereign Father!" The Emperor was secretly angry. Others aside, since Wen Tiren entered the Grand Secretariat, he could be called "good at understanding the Emperor's will," but on this matter, he behaved not very actively. Naturally, once the news of peace talks leaked out, there would inevitably be another storm in the court. And Wen Tiren's attitude made the Emperor's trust in him diminish a few points more.

This was just a problem of the court. Although the Emperor was young, he understood the basic principles. Even if he rejected all opposing views and pushed through a court decision for peace talks, this was a matter of mutual consent. If they didn't put a little pressure on the "thieves," the "thieves" might not be willing.

The grand fanfare of collecting "Thief Surcharges" (Kun Surcharge) and appointing Fu Zonglong as Governor of Southern Gan to "train troops"... these measures were all to apply pressure on the "thieves." To make them realize that the Imperial Court still had the ability to pour all its strength into a fight.

Besides Fu Zonglong, cultivating a side force to check the "thieves" was also a method. He had already thought of this idea when he first summoned Qian Taichong.

The Emperor had witnessed the rise and fall of the Zheng Zhilong group. Although the "Giant Channel of the Southeast Sea" no longer existed, this Qian Taichong was not only familiar with the "thief situation" but also had a passionate impulse to do a career. Zheng Sen also had the hatred of his father's murder with the "thieves."

With a little support, they would be a side force capable of containing the "thieves." The key was that it wouldn't cost the Imperial Court much money.
