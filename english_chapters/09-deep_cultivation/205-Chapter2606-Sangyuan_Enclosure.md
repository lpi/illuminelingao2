# Chapter 2606: Sangyuan Enclosure

Hou Wenyong had been really depressed lately. He started from secretarial work. The original top position in the "Most Important County" was arranged by Chief Ma to gild him. The result was that before he worked for long and before he made any achievements, he was transferred by Chief Liu to take over the position of Secretary-General for Little Chief Zhang. It was beautifully named "making the best use of talents," but as soon as this Big Chief Zhang came, Nanhai County had nothing to do with him anymore. He was thoroughly beaten back to his original form.

This day, Hou Qing came to his residence to visit this only relative. Seeing he had something on his mind, she asked him what was wrong.

Hou Wenyong carefully told Hou Qing his worries. Hou Qing comforted, "Brother, you are still young; this little setback is nothing. If it were in the previous dynasty, gaining a *Xiucai* title at your age would already be accumulating virtue from our Hou family ancestors. I often hear Chief Lin say that one should 'observe extensively but absorb sparingly, accumulate thickly but erupt thinly.' Everyone in the system knows you were Chief Ma's personal secretary. suddenly occupying a high position is not a good thing for you. Shortly after Chief Zhang took office this time, he arranged for people from all departments to go to the grassroots. Ah Liang and I are both on the list. You didn't do it when you were in office, which shows your ability and insight still need improvement. If there is a chance later, I think you should apply to train at the grassroots for a few years."

Hou Wenyong was a bit depressed and said, "When we just entered the city, everything was waiting to be done. There were so many things to deal with every day; I really couldn't spare time to go down to the grassroots."

Hou Qing shook her head. As a woman, her mind was naturally more meticulous, plus she was much older than Hou Wenyong and much more mature.

Hou Qing said, "Going down to the grassroots or not has nothing to do with you. Why are you still pondering this matter? Look at your superiors and those around you; they are all Chiefs. You, a small cadre, without Chief Ma suppressing the scene, how can you coordinate these big leaders? Being too aggressive offends people; being too weak gets nothing done. You can't train this kind of just-right handling without decades of honing. Listen to Sister, calm down and temper yourself well."

Hou Wenyong thought about it and realized it was indeed the case, so his heart broadened a lot.

Hou Qing added, "I see you are not young anymore. If it were in the past, your children should be able to buy soy sauce. They say start a family and establish a career, start a family and establish a career; start a family first, then establish a career. If Sister sees a suitable one, I'll arrange a marriage for you."

Hou Wenyong said, "Sister, I'm not in a hurry. What about you? When do you plan to get the certificate with Brother Liang?"

A blush appeared on Hou Qing's face. "Depends on him."

A week later, two Dafa boats were docked at the Tianzi Wharf in Guangzhou. More than ten Nanhai County cadres gathered here, and a team of Battōtai National Army was responsible for security.

Zhang Xiao touched the Glock pistol he had just maintained and carried three extra magazines on his body. Although there was the National Army escorting, he felt more assured with this old friend accompanying him.

Putting the pistol into the holster, Zhang Xiao issued the order: "Depart!"

"Tu tu tu..." The steam boiler on the Dafa boat emitted thick black smoke, like a tail dragged by the Dafa boat, gradually drifting away in the breeze. The inspection fleet composed of two Dafa boats docked at the Foshan Economic Development Zone, visited the Little Senators interning there on the way, and after replenishing coal, entered the Shunde Waterway, entering the Jiujiang Creek southwards from the boat lock of the East Enclosure of Sangyuan Enclosure near Xiqiao Mountain.

Because two Senators were traveling, along with a dozen important cadres, besides the Battōtai National Army responsible for security, the General Bureau of Senator Guards also sent people.

Considering that the Senate's foundation in the countryside was not deep, the force Zhang Xiao brought on this trip was really a bit exaggerated. Originally, Zhang Xiao wanted to borrow two experimental 82mm mortars from the Fubo Army to accompany them. This weapon had extremely high mobility relying only on manpower in the absence of mules and horses. Village houses in the countryside were mostly thatched or tiled roofs; mortar shells had good penetration. Vertically falling explosive shells had extremely high lethality against unprotected human bodies and could bypass walls to kill targets inside fortifications.

However, Zhu Mingxia didn't agree, because even if lent to the National Army, they wouldn't know how to use them. It was better to bring two 12-pound mountain howitzers, which were enough for the National Army. The biggest threat in going to the countryside was nothing more than bandits. Mountain howitzers could fire directly, or even be used as large shotguns firing canister shots to beat back attacks from hundreds of bandits without problem; very applicable.

But when Zhang Xiao explained the destination, Zhu Mingxia was also in a dilemma. Both Jiujiang and Longjiang were watery regions; mountain howitzers would basically have no mobility there. Finally, it was decided to use a batch of Minié rifles eliminated by the Fubo Army to replace the Nanyang rifles in the hands of the accompanying Battōtai. The difference between these two rifles was only whether there was rifling, but the shooting accuracy was worlds apart. In addition, the special agents of the General Bureau of Senator Guards were all equipped with new 1637 breech-loading rifles. Zhu Mingxia patted his chest and guaranteed that with such firepower, even without cannons, if they really encountered bandits, they wouldn't dare to move.

The Army, Marines, and Navy sailors had long used Minié rifles, which had problems such as excessive caliber affecting ballistic performance, excessively long barrels (the prototype Enfield P1853 barrel was 99cm long) inconvenient for loading, and separating paper-wrapped ammunition being easily dampened. The modified Hall breech-loading rifle also failed to completely solve the aforementioned defects. With the stable copper supply obtained from monopolizing the Japan copper trade, designing a new copper-cased fixed ammunition rifle became a top priority.

In 1635, two groups of the Weapon Design Bureau proposed Plan 1 (trapdoor action imitated from Springfield M1873) and Plan 2 (falling-block action imitated from Martini-Henry) respectively. During the period when the Senate was busy with the Two Guangs Strategy, both plans made different prototype guns to adapt to various experimental ammunition. When reviewing the test results, the military believed that Plan 2 was fully superior in rate of fire and reliability, while the Planning Academy favored Plan 1 because it could be modified from Minié rifles. As the war in the Two Guangs came to an end, the Senate decided to vigorously enrich the National Army and consolidate the new areas. Minié rifles eliminated from the regular army were either modified into Nanyang rifles provided to the National Army garrison squadrons or directly delivered to the National Army mobile squadrons. Plan 1 thus lost its advantage, and Plan 2 was officially finalized as the Type 1637 breech-loading rifle.

This gun was equipped with 1637 Type 10x61mm R black powder rifle cartridges. Fired from a 72cm barrel, the initial velocity was 485m/s. The standard warhead was a 338 grain (21.9g) hard lead alloy warhead. With Metford rifling, it had good dispersion accuracy within 600 meters. Because some army officers were too obsessed with bayonet fighting and worried that shortening the barrel would weaken bayonet capabilities, this gun was issued with an extended bayonet. However, in most battles, soldiers reported that the new rifle had a faster rate of fire (maximum 20 rounds/min, actual combat rate of fire about 12 rounds/min) and fierce firepower, and the probability of bayonet fighting actually decreased significantly.

The Type 1637 rifle was the undisputed main rifle in the southward operations, the Northern Expedition War, and the mainland strategy of the entire 1640s. Its breadth of use and length of time were unmatched in the Australian Song light weapon system. Even when the Australian Song homeland troops had fully switched to smokeless powder semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons, the garrison troops in colonies on the other side of the earth were still manually casting warheads to supply the old but sturdy Type 1637 rifles in their hands.

Zhang Xiao stood at the bow, facing the wind, enjoying the pleasure of being liberated from heavy official duties. Xiqiao Mountain was two kilometers away, visible when looking up. This scene reminded Zhang Xiao of a poem he saw when organizing materials earlier, written by Zhan Ruoshui when he was lecturing at Xiqiao Mountain: "Spring moves Qiao Lake and lake water lives, water encircling Qiao Lake is like a city. The withered old man sits alone on the peak of Qiao Cloud, ninety-six peaks are bright with the moon."

The Xiqiao Mountain seen by Zhan Ruoshui in the Jiajing years was extremely different from what was seen in later generations. The reason Zhan called Xiqiao Mountain "surrounded by great seas on all sides" was that the development within the Sangyuan Enclosure was not yet deep at that time, and there were large-scale waters within the enclosure. Jiujiang Creek was the main river flowing north-south within Jiujiang. It was very wide in the Ming Dynasty, recorded explicitly as twenty-eight *zhang* wide. In later generations, due to continuous development, the river silted up and houses increased daily, causing it to shrink into a small river channel.

It was a pity that more than seventy years had passed since Zhan Ruoshui's time. The land development within the Sangyuan Enclosure had developed greatly. Zhang Xiao could no longer see the vast waters Zhan Ruoshui saw.

Along the way, various civilian boats came and went in countless branching creeks. Farmers on the shore worked hard sweating. Hearing the unique noise of the Dafa boat, the indigenous people around looked towards Zhang Xiao's fleet, as if paying him attention. Zhang Xiao couldn't help waving to them.

"Jiayu, do you know when the Sangyuan Enclosure was built?" Zhang Xiao asked.

Zhang Jiayu didn't expect Zhang Xiao to ask him this question. Being from Dongguan, he naturally wouldn't know the history of a dike enclosure in Nanhai County, so he answered ashamedly, "Student is ashamed; I truly do not know."

"Councilor Huang?" Zhang Xiao turned to Huang Xiyin again.

"Answering the Chief, the Sangyuan Enclosure was first built during the Huizong reign of the National Dynasty, with a history of more than five hundred years." As a former magistrate, building water conservancy was his duty, so Huang Xiyin naturally knew about this important water conservancy facility in his jurisdiction.

"National Dynasty?" Zhang Xiao was stunned. The materials he saw clearly said it started in the Northern Song era; how did a "National Dynasty" and Huizong come up... Only a few minutes later did he react. *Turns out this "National Dynasty" refers to the "Great Song"!* In comparison, he, a Grand Song Senator, kept saying "Northern Song" and "Southern Song" all the time!

*This consciousness! This level of speaking! If he hadn't come with the Senate, comparing wits with true Ming scholars, he would really be sold and still counting money for others.*

"Correct," Zhang Xiao said. "Water conservancy is the foundation of agriculture, and agriculture is the foundation of the state. The Sangyuan Enclosure is divided into East and West Enclosures. In the Song Dynasty... National Dynasty, the West Enclosure started from Feie Yi in Sanshui to the junction of Ganshu Niushan, and the East Enclosure started from Jizan Lianggu Dun to the end of Longjiang River Peng Enclosure. It was more than twelve thousand *zhang* long, protecting 1500 *qing* of fields. When the Sangyuan Enclosure was first built, it was only piled up with mud, four or five *chi* high. Because the local terrain is high in the northwest and low in the southeast, the Sangyuan Enclosure was an open enclosure in the Song Dynasty. At that time, the downstream coastal sandbars were not much silted, and water drainage was easy. Therefore, at the Daoliu Harbor and Longjiang Jiao water outlets in the southeast corner of the dike, no sluices were set to block water, allowing the water inside the enclosure and river water to pour into the enclosure from outside, venting each other, following the water potential, not fighting for land with water. This is truly the wisdom of the ancestors."
