# Chapter 2710: The Capital (Part 62)

Small beasts only startle and flee when you inadvertently step into their hiding spots. Thus, in the wild, people always feel that small animals suddenly dart out from right beside their feet.

Liao Sanniang was very careful, diligently managing potential light reflections and noise. She kept her body hidden in the shadows, wore no jewelry or reflective metal, avoided breaking branches or stepping on dry leaves, and used trees for cover, searching and advancing in segments.

She had been doing very well; her movement was nearly perfect, engaging the enemy in secrecy.

But animal instinct is like a master martial artist—impossible to detect. The pheasant flapped its wings and flew up, turning all her efforts to naught.

After a brief astonishment and a moment of eye contact, the sturdy man closest to her thrust his waist saber forward and charged.

Liao Sanniang fired first.

With a muffled sound, a puff of white smoke rose. The connection between the cylindrical magazine and the barrel fractured; the barrel fell off, and flying steel fragments and gunpowder gas spilled out in all directions.

Lingao's industrial products suffered from poor consistency; there were significant differences between products of the same batch.

With this level of quality control, in the Old Time Space, many would have been classified as scrap.

Escort masters knew the importance of firearm maintenance but had no concept of firearm lifespan.

Liao Sanniang's gun was a refurbished old weapon from the factory. Its quality was low tier for its period, and before reaching her hands, its firing count had far exceeded design parameters. The gun had had its barrel replaced. The damage this time wasn't a chamber explosion; the malfunction was unclear.

If she had held the gun with two hands, her hands would have been cut by the burning gas and fragments. Fortunately, she fired one-handed and was unexpectedly unhurt.

facing the unexplained flash and white smoke, the sturdy man with the waist saber retreated a step in terror, instinctively raising his left hand to shield his face and holding his saber in his right hand to protect himself.

Liao Sanniang remained calm in the face of the sudden change. She discarded the broken gun and also took a step back to open a little distance. She drew the sheathed double sabers from her waist. Pushing the scabbard forward with her left hand and pulling the hilt back with her right, her arms pulled in opposite directions. The double sabers unsheathed, and the scabbard flew forward like an arrow.

Chinese double sabers are of equal length. The hilts are semi-circular; when brought together, the hilts form an ellipse, fitting into a single scabbard.

The scabbard smashed toward his face, and the man parried with his saber.

Seizing the opportunity, Liao Sanniang rubbed her hands together, separating the double sabers to hold one in each hand.

The man, having faced an explosion and a flying scabbard in succession, was still in shock. He appeared momentarily bewildered and at a loss.

Grabbing the opening, Liao Sanniang turned her body and advanced. Both sabers pointed forward at an angle, parallel to each other, charging in like a "//" symbol.

The left saber flipped and deflected obliquely, catching the upper attack of the waist saber; the right saber stabbed forward. Offense and defense were one.

Thin cloth and skin were pierced like paper. The tip of the right saber stabbed into the enemy's upper abdomen from below the xiphoid process of the sternum.

Liao Sanniang stepped back, shifting her body right and rear to guard against a counterattack. Borrowing the momentum of her body turn, she pulled the right saber horizontally. The blade sliced through muscle, injured the liver, slit the diaphragm, and diagonally dissected the enemy's abdominal cavity.

Liao Sanniang retracted her sabers. The wound was massive; there was no need to worry about him—he would die on his own.

Liao Sanniang counted silently in her heart: *One*.

Liao Sanniang whispered to Little Bazi's hiding spot: "Hide well, kill from behind."

Half of Little Bazi's face flashed behind the bushes, then shrank back.

After speaking, Liao Sanniang let out a terrified scream and fled in the direction she came from.

Lingao had puppet troupes where actors hid behind curtains, playing all living beings with vocal mimicry; they were called voice actors (*Seiyuu*).

Disguising one's voice could be used to lure enemies. Liao Sanniang found it interesting and had communicated with the actors, learning introductory vocal techniques and emotional performance.

Liao Sanniang screamed in terror, sounding like a weak woman being violated. The scream formed an eerie contrast with her cold face.

Stimulated by the female voice, the bandits chased out. One bandit holding a short spear outstripped the others and charged to the front.

Liao Sanniang ran a few steps, then slowed down, letting him get close. Out of the corner of her eye, she glimpsed the man behind her holding the spear with one hand.

To use a spear, one must route in the horse stance (*mabu*), using the waist and hips as the foundation of power. Running made one's footsteps floating and unstable. The comer was breathing rapidly; he was a mediocre hand.

Mid-run, Liao Sanniang suddenly crouched, changing the height and distance between the two. Her right saber slashed backward in a reverse grip. This was a technique of the Mongolian cavalry saber. When two horses charged each other, if no winner was decided, the rider would slash backward as the horses crossed—this was using cavalry saber techniques on foot, the so-called "Dragging Saber Stratagem" (*Tuodaoji*).

The distance was judged precisely, as if measured by a ruler. The saber tip moved from bottom to top, slicing from the inner thigh to the crotch. First, it cut the superficial arteries of the thigh, causing massive bleeding. The tip continued upward; the intense stimulation of steel tearing apart the lower body caused painful shock. The man behind her rolled his eyes back and fell forward, losing combat capability.

Liao Sanniang held the saber in a reverse grip with her left hand, propped her fist on the ground, and with three limbs touching the ground, she aided her legs in propelling forward, quickly regaining balance.

Liao Sanniang didn't stop at all, continuing forward. She counted silently: *Two*.

A third man chased with a saber. Seeing his fallen companion, he stopped, debating whether to continue.

Ahead, Liao Sanniang stumbled and let out a miserable scream, seemingly about to fall, and dodged behind a tree.

The saber-wielder hesitated, but finally chased after her. He wove around trees, taking a shortcut to intercept.

Suddenly, his body paused, and his head was yanked backward by something.

The steel wire strung up earlier was right here, with several fishhooks hanging from it by fishing line.

This was an indoor trap mechanism, usually set in hallways. When entering a room, whether eyes were adapting to darkness or adjusting from light to dark, the matte, hanging fishhooks would snag the scalp or hair. It was an alley warfare tactic, but if deployed properly, it could be used in the jungle too.

Bandits had no conditions to wash their hair. Their hair was matted into felt; when let down, it was a sheet of dirty, hard hair plates. Ancients bind their hair in buns. Dirty hair combed into a bun became a knotted ball that couldn't be combed out. Once snagged by a fishhook, it was impossible to disentangle.

The fishhooks hung at different lengths to accommodate different heights. This man was unlucky; one hooked his hair bun, and another hooked his right eyelid. The forward momentum was too fierce; the fishhook pulled, tearing off the entire eyelid, leaving the eyeball exposed without cover.

Liao Sanniang turned out silently from behind the tree. Her double sabers faced outward. Her left hand guarded, while her right saber leveled and stabbed out horizontally.

The tip hit a rib. Liao Sanniang tilted the handle, slightly changing the direction of the tip. lubricated by blood, it slid in along the gap of the ribs and pierced the heart. A subtle beating of the heart transmitted through the blade tip.

With a twist of the tip, the man's facial features contracted with the turning blade. The expression of pain was carved onto his face as he congealed into a corpse.

She withdrew the blade. She casually wiped the blade tip back and forth on the corpse's clothes. Blood is viscous; if it gums up the blade, the blade becomes soft. It must be wiped frequently to keep the edge sharp.

Lingao fishing line wasn't very strong and couldn't bear the weight; the corpse snapped the line and fell.

Liao Sanniang counted silently: *Three*.

The bandits behind had realized something was wrong and shouted loudly: "This woman is extremely formidable! Don't go alone; gather together and kill her with combined force!"

Another shouted: "Forget the woman! Quick, go join up with the Leader!"

Voices were clamorous and opinions varied. Unable to unify command, they split into two groups, each acting on its own.

Liao Sanniang was in a small clearing. The surrounding branches were extremely dense, with a difficult-to-discern wild path connecting the two ends.

Moving through dense bushes, clothes, bodies, and weapons were easily snagged, making one a living target. The enemy could only approach via the wild path.

The path only allowed one person; she wouldn't face multiple people simultaneously.

From her observation earlier, there were no archers, which relieved her.

Liao Sanniang transferred both sabers to her left hand, fished a steel dart from the leather strap on her chest, and cupped it in her palm.

Touching the steel dart, she suddenly thought of Old Feng and felt a twinge of regret. She should have taken that pistol.

A file recommending Liao Sanniang lay quietly in the archives of the Military Intelligence Bureau. The kraft paper file bag had developed fuzzy edges and turned yellow with age.

As an peripheral organization of the Intelligence Bureau, every outstanding or special person in the Qiwei Escort Bureau would be brought into view and become a candidate.

Liao Sanniang was an eccentric woman. She possessed a worldly figure and a steel gall that could snap blades. Perhaps not lovable, but definitely eye-catching.

Director Jiang Shan of the Intelligence Bureau had once looked at this simple personal file for a long time. He appreciated this woman who dared to try new things and possessed strong modern female characteristics. However, many of her traits didn't mesh with intelligence work. A field intelligence officer needs to evaluate, analyze, develop, and control; they are builders and maintainers of networks, directors behind the curtain, not protagonists in the spotlight.

Liao Sanniang possessed an adventurous spirit and was insensitive to fear and stimulation. This gave her the ability to remain calmer than ordinary people in cruel and bloody environments.

Callousness in slaughter was common in medieval times, but viewed from a modern perspective, it could be called a cold-blooded killer. This puzzled Jiang Shan, even making him suspect her amygdala was abnormal, that she had an emotional defect and lacked perception of natural emotions.

Jiang Shan struggled for a while. Moments later, he tossed the file down, shook his head, and muttered to himself: "Render unto the Temple what is the Temple's. Let the Jianghu's remain in the Jianghu."

Liao Sanniang never knew she once had a turning point in her fate. At this moment, she was only focused, capturing any subtle omen. The surrounding bushes swayed almost simultaneously; the wind moved the branches and shook the mind.

She blinked. The steel dart was in her hand. A figure flashed in the bushes ahead. People have *qi*, steps have sound, spirits have awareness. Her mind sensed it: ahead was foe, not friend.

A human reaction takes 0.3 seconds. A blade is different from a fist; a hit means injury. Heavy injury means death; light injury means slowness.

The best way: strike before the enemy, making the enemy react.

In her early wandering days, Liao Sanniang wore a double-layered dart pouch carrying thirteen darts.

After equipping a short gun, the dart pouch was replaced by a holster. She carried seven darts on a chest strap to fill the gap.

Liao Sanniang's flying darts were narrow and thin like awls, five *cun* long, weighing seven *liang*. The cross-section was triangular, with three edges and three faces.

The three-faced dart body had one wide face and two narrow ones. The lower part was cylindrical, with a flat bottom.

Most dart tails had red or green silk cloth attached, called "dart clothing" (*biao-yi*), acting like the fletching of an arrow.

Liao Sanniang used darts with bare shafts and no clothing, resembling large steel needles.

With the steel dart in hand, years of training formed an instinct. No adjustment was needed; the steel dart naturally settled into the optimal position in her palm.

The root of the dart pressed against her palm center. Four fingers barely touched. The wide face of the dart rested on her middle finger. The index and ring fingers pressed against the two narrow sides. The three fingers formed a groove, and the dart lay within it. The thumb lightly pressed the dart tail.

The length of the dart exposed from the palm and the angle of the erect palm upon release concerned the throwing distance and the downward speed of flight. Control relied on experience and feel; the details could only be sensed, not explained.

Chinese darts fly straight. For long distances, they can spin, aiming with the middle finger.

Liao Sanniang swung her shoulder and elbow. Upper arm, elbow, and wrist sent the force; the forearm exerted power. She shook her hand forward into a flat palm. At the moment of release, her palm pushed forward, middle finger slightly pressed the dart tip, thumb released the dart, and she erected her palm to throw the dart.
