# Chapter 2748: The Capital (Part 104)

A sudden shiver ran through him. Xu Guangqi was conducting tuntian—military farming—in Tianjin, where he had introduced numerous Western agricultural methods and machinery to outstanding effect. This so-called "Western" knowledge might very well contain elements from the Kun.

If he rashly accused Sun Yuanhua of colluding with the Kun, would he not also offend Xu Guangqi in the process?

Xu Guangqi had served as an official for many years and cultivated deep connections throughout the court. Moreover, as the leader of Western religion believers in China, he commanded a following of gentry who had embraced the faith. To offend such a man would render his own position precarious.

Even if Sun Yuanhua were truly involved with the Kun, it was likely nothing more than Australian sea merchants seeking additional avenues for profit. The land of Denglai was barren and notorious for its poverty—nothing like the fertile soil and abundant waters of Qiongzhou. Without years of establishing themselves on land, the Kun could not become a serious threat immediately. And should they one day invade Dengzhou, Sun Yuanhua would bear the blame first; the matter would have nothing to do with him. With this reasoning settled in his mind, Yang Sichang replied:

"Since the Dengzhou Mutiny, Sun Yuanhua has pacified Dongjiang, contained the Tartars, and achieved remarkable victories time and again. His loyalty and diligence shine as clearly as the sun and moon. If the Kun truly have dealings with him, it is presumably only merchants under his jurisdiction trading in Kun goods. Denglai lies along the coast, so maritime merchants naturally come and go. Merchants pursue profit above all else—it is hardly surprising that they sell items made by the Kun, or even weapons. Your Majesty, in today's world, where are Kun goods not sold? Who does not use them? Your servant believes that since these goods serve the Great Ming, there is no need to impose a temporary ban."

Chongzhen nodded as he listened. Regarding Sun Yuanhua, those who impeached him were not few, and the Emperor himself harbored suspicions. He had therefore instructed the guarding eunuch of Denglai and the Jinyiwei to investigate. While the results did not entirely match Yang Sichang's account, the report confirmed no signs of Kun forces operating on the ground in Denglai. However, it noted that Sun Yuanhua's Dengzhou Army had purchased fowling pieces and cannons from sea merchants—weapons claimed to originate from Nanyang but reportedly of exceptional quality, seemingly obtained from the Kun. Yet when Chongzhen later questioned the Ministry of War about this matter, he discovered that such fowling pieces supposedly from Nanyang equipped many elite units among the town and governor's markers, including the renowned Guan-Ning Army. And so the matter was left unsettled.

Yang Sichang's words struck precisely at Chongzhen's inclinations. Under current circumstances, he had no wish to lose such a capable minister. The reversal of fortunes in Denglai and Jiangdong had significantly contained Tartar activities. Because Sun Yuanhua and his colleagues served while bearing guilt from the Dengzhou rebellion, their tone when requesting grain and pay from the Imperial Court was notably more subdued. Memorials permitted them to recruit refugees, reclaim land for military colonies, and substitute grain for pay. Combined with grain shipments sent directly from the Taicang Granary to Lushun in Dengzhou, Sun Yuanhua now saved the Imperial Court nearly one hundred thousand taels annually. A minister so skilled at reducing costs and increasing efficiency—and conveniently positioned to absorb blame—was naturally a treasured asset in Chongzhen's eyes. As for whether the Kun were truly causing trouble in Denglai, there would be time enough to investigate and punish him if that day came.

"Zhen has heard that the Kun are also of the Huaxia lineage—descendants exiled overseas after the complete destruction of the Song dynasty. Though they now occupy Liangguang, if they can refrain from creating chaos and spare the common people the suffering of war, they too are Zhen's innocent children."

The Emperor's statement came somewhat abruptly, but Yang Sichang had long ago heard Wen Tiren hint that the Emperor did not consider the Kun a pressing threat and vaguely harbored intentions of recruiting them. The policy of "pacifying the interior before resisting external aggression" seemed to align perfectly with His Majesty's thinking.

"Indeed, the Emperor is benevolent. Since the Kun are descendants of Huaxia, so long as Your Majesty grants them an opportunity, they may yet realize their errors and reform their ways."

Monarch and minister conversed back and forth for nearly an hour before Yang Sichang withdrew. Chongzhen stretched and walked out of the Palace of Heavenly Purity. Since ascending the throne, fires had broken out in all eight directions of the Great Ming, smoke rising from every corner. This young Son of Heaven, only twenty-six years old, carried himself with the haggard demeanor of a middle-aged man. Yet today he felt remarkably clear-headed. The world-famous Chuang King, Gao Yingxiang, had been escorted to Beijing and executed just months ago. Sun Yuanhua had reported the great victory at Zhenjiang Fort only days past. And now Yang Sichang had presented him with a strategy to pacify the bandits. He seemed to glimpse the restoration of the Great Ming within reach. He ordered Wang Chengen:

"To the Rear Garden."

He had not visited the Rear Garden for some time. The Capital was nothing like Jiangnan; though a few evergreen trees stood here and there, in such freezing weather the Imperial Garden appeared bleak and desolate, offering little to admire in terms of landscaping. Moreover, the inner garden was cramped, so when the Emperor wished for an outing, he typically went to places like the West Garden or Wansui Mountain.

The inner eunuchs scrambled upon receiving the decree. By the time the Emperor arrived at the Rear Garden, preparations were complete. A fire had been lit in the Yufang Pavilion—now known as Weiyu Studio—where the Emperor usually sat and rested during visits to the Rear Garden. Fresh flowers sent from Haidian had been arranged within the heated chamber.

The Emperor had come to this unremarkable garden not on a whim, but to summon an important person.

This person was neither a high-ranking official nor a trusted minister of great weight. Yet the Emperor had been deeply moved upon reading his memorial not long ago and had therefore arranged this special audience.

Because the man's identity was rather unusual, the Emperor chose the Inner Court rather than places like the Palace of Heavenly Purity, where he typically received officials.

Shortly after he had settled himself, someone came to report that Cao Huachun, Admiral of the Eastern Depot, had arrived.

"This slave greets the Imperial Grandfather."

Chongzhen acknowledged him with a silent nod and asked, "I heard that something happened to the Delong Bank some days ago. What is the situation now?"

Cao Huachun had already received word from Wang Dehua: the Emperor was dispatching the Jinyiwei to secretly investigate Delong's affairs.

He had roughly pieced together the circumstances of Shopkeeper Leng's kidnapping. But he could not speak too clearly, lest the Emperor suspect he had come prepared.

"Replying to the Imperial Grandfather, there was indeed such a matter. It is said that bandits from the outskirts of the Capital banded together to kidnap Shopkeeper Leng and demanded one hundred thousand taels of silver. After the Shuntian Prefecture investigated and made arrests, Shopkeeper Leng was rescued before the New Year." He paused, then added, "Because of the kidnapping, Delong was unstable for a time, and the common people rushed to withdraw their deposits. Now that he has returned, the market has calmed."

"Is this Delong the bank that specializes in remittances with Liangguang?"

"Yes, it is that one," Cao Huachun replied, growing more cautious.

"I have heard that for remittances with Liangguang, they offer so-called telegraphic transfers—dianhui—which arrive in two days. Is there truth to this?"

"This slave has never handled bank drafts at Delong, nor do I have relatives or friends in Guangdong, so I cannot speak to whether this claim is accurate. However, Delong's handling of remittances is indeed known for being fast, discreet, and swift. As for arriving in two days, that is likely market rumor, largely exaggerated."

"Zhen believes so as well," the Emperor nodded. He had originally thought the claim absurd. Now that reports from both the Jinyiwei and the Eastern Depot were roughly consistent, his concerns about Delong possessing some manner of "sorcery" were dispelled. He asked again:

"Zhen has heard that inner officials hold shares in this Delong. Is there truth to this?"

Cao Huachun had long anticipated this question. Wang Dehua had already briefed him on the matter. He replied promptly: "Such banks typically cultivate patrons at the gates of the Capital, relying on them as backers. Every establishment does this—Delong is hardly unique. Presumably, this Shopkeeper Leng has worshipped under the gate of some inner official..."

Chongzhen had already received Wu Mengming's report, which accorded roughly with Cao Huachun's account. However, Wu Mengming had explicitly stated that Leng Ningyun worshipped under the gate of Eunuch Yang of the Bell and Drum Division.

Cao Huachun's report pleased him greatly. Comparing the two, neither Wu Mengming nor Cao Huachun had dared deceive him.

Cao Huachun withdrew. On his way out, he passed inner eunuchs leading Wu Mengming and several others toward the pavilion. He did not speak, merely offering a slight nod to acknowledge that he appreciated the favor.

Wu Mengming came before the Yufang Pavilion. The Emperor said: "What progress on the matter I asked you to investigate?"

"Replying to the Imperial Grandfather, this small official has sent people to investigate discreetly. This Zhou Lezhi has no connection with Qian Taichong."

"Where is the person now?"

"He checked out of Chongxiao Temple before the New Year, saying he had matters to attend to and had to return south first. He will come again after the New Year and asked for his room to be held for him," Wu Mengming said. "Around the second or third month after the New Year, he will naturally return to the Capital."

"How do you know this?"

"He has gained some local fame and has many patients. After returning home, how could he find business as good as what the Capital offers?"

"That is true." Chongzhen laughed suddenly. "Zhen has heard of officials leaving the Capital and monks entering it. Presumably, besides monks, Daoists, physicians, and physiognomists follow the same pattern."

"Indeed, after all, the Capital lies at the foot of the Son of Heaven—the place of supreme virtue."

"Where is Qian Taichong?"

"This small official has brought him."

"Summon him in."

In moments, Qian Taichong was brought into the Yufang Pavilion. He felt somewhat bewildered at being brought here. For months now, he had been living in the Fujian Guild Hall, busying himself with tasks for Zheng Sen.

Since Zheng Zhilong had been brought low by the Kun, Zheng Sen had managed—thanks to Qian Taichong's shrewd calculations—to recapture Anping and gather a portion of the soldiers and ships his father had left behind. Yet within Zhangzhou Bay, the powerful figures of the former Zheng family faction had each staked out their own territory and refused to take this young man seriously.

Internal troubles had not yet been settled when external threats arrived. After the Kun occupied Tainan and constructed "Kaohsiung City," their fleet patrolled the Fujian coast year-round. The once-lucrative trade with Japan and Nanyang was gradually seized by the Kun. This intensified the struggle for limited resources among the various factions.

Zheng Zhilong had left behind not only a formidable fleet but also vast landholdings and commercial networks. The battle for ownership of these assets had become an "invisible war" throughout Zhangzhou Bay. Though the parties refrained from open conflict, private skirmishes had never ceased.

As a young son, Zheng Sen naturally suffered in this scramble for inheritance. Although Qian Taichong mediated from within, Tong Taro served the external front, and he had obtained the Fujian Governor's support, thus far Zheng Sen remained only the nominal "Head of the Zheng Family"—unable to command the warlords. Even the Zheng family's core force, the "Zhongzuosuo," lay beyond his authority.

All he could hold now was Anping City and a few thousand mu of nearby land. With only these meager resources, let alone taking revenge, he could not even command the Zheng family.

Qian Taichong had racked his brains during these years in Anping, thinking through and attempting every stratagem he had ever read in books, yet he could not find a way to break the deadlock.

After Fujian Governor Zou Weilian left office, Zheng Sen lost his greatest official backer. Their position in Zhangzhou Bay grew more precarious still.

Though the Kun had stripped Anping bare years ago, vast tracts of fertile farmland surrounded the city. In their current state—with overseas trade all but severed—these lands, capable of producing fixed yields each year, had become coveted prizes, eyed hungrily by every faction.
