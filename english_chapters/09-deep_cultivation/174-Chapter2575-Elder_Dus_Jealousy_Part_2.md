# Chapter 2575 - Elder Du's Jealousy (Part 2)

After sending the telegram, Du Yibin asked about Song Yingsheng's third younger brother Song Yingxing's recent situation.

This was old hat by now. Basically every so often, Elder Du would ask Song Yingsheng about his second brother's situation. Song Yingsheng had gotten used to it. Fortunately, once you crossed the Five Ridges you were in Jiangxi, and Qiwei's armed escort route to Jiangxi had been maintained. Song Yingsheng's contact with home had never been cut, and neither had his contact with his brother—Song Yingxing was serving as Educational Director at the county school in Fenyi County, Yuan Prefecture, Jiangxi. The brothers' correspondence had also never stopped.

For quite a while after the Australians conquered the Two Guangs, Song Yingsheng had disappeared without a trace. Whether it was the family back in Fengxin or his brother serving in Fenyi County, everyone was terrified with worry. But the Five Ridges had become a battlefield, cutting off all news.

Only when hostilities largely subsided last year and Qiwei's escort route reopened with some resumption of trade did Song Yingsheng's letter finally reach his family's hands. In the letter, Song Yingsheng didn't dare say he'd become an Australian staff aide, lest outsiders learn of it and create trouble. He only said he was stranded in Enping but was currently well-fed and clothed, telling everyone not to worry.

After that, the two sides exchanged frequent correspondence. Song Yingsheng knew Song Yingxing was compiling *The Exploitation of the Works of Nature*, so he purchased various natural history and craft science popular books from Guangzhou to send over. This scratched right where Song Yingxing itched. Not only did he write back asking his brother to search out more such books, he even sent twenty taels of silver via escort agency.

Song Yingsheng knew his brother's salary as Educational Director was meager—honestly, there wasn't much extra income or perks either. These twenty taels of silver were probably years of savings. But he couldn't openly say he was working for the Australians. Getting a few books really wasn't any trouble.

"Thank you for the Chief's concern. My humble brother is currently serving as Educational Director in Fenyi County. He's getting along quite comfortably."

"Whatever books he wants, just have him speak up. No need to send money over—I'll cover all of this." Du Yibin wore an expression of great wealth. "But once the book is finished, send me a copy first."

The next day, Du Yibin departed from Enping back to Guangzhou.

His main stated reason for returning to Guangzhou was "summarizing and reporting on over two years of work in Enping County." Incidentally, he'd also meet with Cui Hantang.

Though he had adopted Song Yingsheng's suggestion, he still couldn't swallow this resentment, so he decided to go stir up Cui Hantang and give Zhang Xiao some "comradely affection."

---

The two met at the Five Immortals Temple. They first cursed Zhang Xiao roundly for "lacking loyalty," then conspired on how to "give him eye medicine."

Cui Hantang felt that snatching Zhang Jiayu back now was impossible. There was no rush to give Zhang Xiao eye medicine—he wasn't going anywhere. Better to practice iron sand palm for a few days first, then go. But just cutting off Zhang Jiayu's connection like this—he really couldn't stomach that resentment.

Du Yibin's eyes rolled. Suddenly thinking of something, he asked: "Does this Zhang Jiayu have any brothers or sisters?"

"He has a brother, Zhang Jiazhen, but he's only six years old." Cui Hantang said dejectedly. "I'd want to promote him, but he's too young. He does have a younger sister, but she's also not very old."

"The brother's too young. But since there's a sister, isn't that easy? Have Zhang Jiayu's sister come to the Five Immortals Temple as a Daoist nun. The Temple originally has too many Daoist priests and too few nuns anyway. Isn't his family quite poor? After Mother Zhang recovers, have her and the daughter both stay at the Temple. They can teach students in the Temple's Daoist student classes. His is a scholarly family, so the mother and daughter should both be literate, right? We're short of teachers, and they can earn some money teaching—a perfect arrangement. Oh right, isn't Zhang Jiazhen too young? Just give the whole family a set of rooms in the Temple to live in. Food and lodging on us."

Cui Hantang really hadn't expected Du Yibin to come up with such an idea—quite the bolt from the blue. But he was somewhat hesitant. Wouldn't doing this create too big a stir? It felt somewhat improper.

"Is this appropriate?"

"What's inappropriate about it?" Du Yibin said. "Think about it: for Zhang Xiao, we're helping him look after Zhang Jiayu's family, letting him focus on work without worries. For Zhang Jiayu, his whole family will be with us. When he passes the civil service exam, we have his mother and sister work on him—won't that be a cinch?"

"Excellent, excellent! You rascal, you've really got something there!" Cui Hantang praised highly. "Removing the firewood from under the cauldron! Brilliant, simply brilliant!"

Ready to act immediately, he summoned his deputy Fu Meng and had him make preparations.

Unexpectedly, before he'd even finished speaking, Fu Meng shook his head vigorously, repeatedly saying "inappropriate."

"What's inappropriate about it?"

"Old Cui, don't you know female Daoists have a bad reputation in this timeline?"

"Is that so?" Du Yibin frowned.

"Of course. Not just female Daoists—female Buddhist nuns too. In common people's eyes, they're practically no different from prostitutes. Even sincerely devout female disciples are often burdened by such reputations," Fu Meng said. "I don't know if this Zhang Jiayu is from a wealthy family, but since he has such a great reputation, he's definitely from a so-called 'clean family background' of good standing. Now you want his sister to become a Daoist nun, and teach at a Daoist temple... I don't even dare imagine what kind of rumors will fly. This isn't just slapping his face—it practically amounts to defaming their virtue... Zhang Jiayu would hate you to the bone, wouldn't he? This isn't winning favor—it's making enemies."

"Right, right." Cui Hantang thought and indeed it was so. The few female Daoist students in his temple were also frequently criticized. Commoners didn't care whether you were new or old—preconceptions formed over hundreds of years couldn't be changed in a year or two.

"Little Du, your terrible idea won't work!" Cui Hantang's face changed. "You nearly got me killed!"

Du Yibin thought to himself, how was I supposed to know there was such a complicated situation here!

"Fine, fine, I was wrong. You say what to do then?"

Cui Hantang's eyes rolled: "Regardless, that little Zhang Xiao can't be allowed to be comfortable. Snatching my people comes with a price. Oh right, you mentioned giving the Shen'ao Study Society people a chance, selecting a few staff aides—that's a good proposal! I'll go find Zhang Xiao right now."

"What do you need to find him for about the Study Society's affairs? We can decide ourselves. Besides, the staff aides don't get paid by Nanhai County, and don't take up Nanhai County's personnel quota..."

"I'm going to discuss it with him, hmph—this Daoist's people aren't taken without consequences."

Du Yibin's thinking was more complicated than Cui Hantang's. After some thought, he said: "What's done is done about the person, but he still has to pay a price!"

...

Cui Hantang and Du Yibin came to Zhang Xiao's office with murderous intent. They swaggered in and pushed open his office door, then plopped down right in front of him—making his eyebrows furrow involuntarily. This Daoist had always minded his own business with him. Why this sudden visit? Then seeing Du Yibin behind him with a scheming smile, he immediately understood: they'd come about Zhang Jiayu.

Before he could speak, Cui Hantang opened his mouth:

"Medicine Master Zhang, you're really something! You even dare snatch this Daoist and Old Du's catch—quite the nerve! Do you think me and Old Du are pushovers?" He spoke while lightly tapping the desk, wearing a smile that wasn't quite a smile as he looked at Zhang Xiao. Zhang Xiao, looking at Cui Hantang who was twice his weight, felt somewhat intimidated. Though Cui Hantang couldn't actually beat him up, a few hearty slaps would probably put him down for half a day.

"Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda. I also saw his supreme filial piety..."

"Don't give me that! Lots of filial sons in Guangzhou. He's the only one with supreme filial piety?! Living, he's a person of my Shen'ao Study Society; dead, he's a dead person of my Shen'ao Study Society. You snatched him away—where does that leave mine and Old Du's face? You owe us an explanation." Cui Hantang wouldn't let up.

Zhang Xiao wore a bitter smile, thinking what kind of attitude was this from these two! Even using "living person" and "dead person."

He more or less understood—these two were here to get even. Whether in terms of face or talent loss, they had to get some explanation, and probably squeeze out some compensation too.

"That's not right, Old Cui. I understand you valuing Zhang Jiayu, this Three Loyalists of Lingnan person, but didn't Old Du publicly declare he wasn't a famous person collector? How come he's also interested in him?"

"I'm not a famous person collector..."

Cui Hantang signaled Du Yibin not to speak, and said himself: "Isn't that obvious? Anyone who can leave their name in history definitely has ability. The Shen'ao Study Society was established by Old Du, you know. Besides, he's the number one chief in Zhaoqing now, still short of people. He'd already had his eye on Zhang Jiayu, and then you snatched him. Can you blame him for being angry?"

"I really didn't know about this. My fault, my fault!" Zhang Xiao laughed. "Since you've come, you must have some ideas. We're all our own people—just say it directly."

"Medicine Master Zhang, you're really a straightforward person. Then we won't beat around the bush either. Look, this Study Society member Zhang Jiayu was directly called over by you as an intern staff aide. This is the first one since the Society was founded. Old Du's idea is that he's preparing to submit a proposal at an appropriate time, making it so that when hiring staff aides throughout Guangdong and Guangxi in our territory, priority should be given to drawing from this Shen'ao Study Society. Then gradually extend it across the Central Plains. At that time, not only must you, Medicine Master Zhang, support it, you must also cooperate with me and Old Cui to get support from other Elders as much as possible."

This made Zhang Xiao's brows furrow. Old Du's ambitions weren't small.

"It's no problem for me to cast a supporting vote. But you should also think clearly. Though the Senate hasn't explicitly forbidden Elders from recruiting their own staff aides, it essentially conflicts with the cadre appointment system. Originally, everyone doing backroom operations was fine, but if you put it on the table for a vote, aren't you asking for trouble? Aren't you two afraid of being blasted by the Elders? Never mind anything else—just the phrase 'colluding with old forces, cultivating personal factions' would be more than you could handle! Are you two really planning to submit this proposal?"

At this, the two's confidence immediately receded six or seven feet. His point made them instantly realize the proposal's problems.
