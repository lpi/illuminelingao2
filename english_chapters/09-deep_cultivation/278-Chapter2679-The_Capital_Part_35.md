# Chapter 2679: The Capital (Part 35)

"...After investigation, *Zizhenzhai* is a precious plaything [curio] shop in Guangzhou Prefecture. It has a jewelry workshop inside; the styles of produced soft valuables [jewelry/accessories] are extremely distinct, and the valuations are very high. Glazed glass cups are not sold there but in another shop named *Zichengji*. The various items displayed in this shop are all called Australian foreign goods, all exceptionally exquisite, and known for glazed glass vessels, including plates, cups, windows, and mirrors. They also sell wine in glazed glass pure bottles, called *Guoshi Wushuang* [The Incomparable]...

"Both shops are owned by one person. This person is surnamed Guo, named Yi, courtesy name unknown. He has no academic degree nor comes from an aristocratic family, yet he raised a ten-zhang tall building from level ground and obtained a ten-thousand-gold property in an instant. There is also a *Ziminglou* [Purple Ming Pavilion], a place of dogs and horses, sound and color [entertainment and debauchery], a cave for melting gold [squandering money]. His concubine, Lady Pei, manages it. Lady Pei, with the name of a top courtesan, connects closely with the gentry of Guangzhou; rich young masters flock there like ducks, and merchants gather like clouds..."

Sent along with the secret report were several small boxes containing Australian goods bought back by Liu Sha: several wooden carved red lacquer powder boxes with silver mirrors inlaid inside. The style was very similar to what was seen in Yangzhou before, but the material seemed somewhat different. There were also two glazed glass bottles. According to Liu Sha's secret report, this should be the *Guoshi Wushuang* wine. Although the wine liquid inside was clear and pure, without a speck of turbidity, undoubtedly being top-grade fine wine, this crystal-clear glazed glass bottle body was even more valuable. Using such vessels to hold wine seemed a bit like putting the cart before the horse. This wine, however, was the "fire wine" Immortal Zhou suggested brewing before. It was just that he initially proposed a cheap mass-market route, while this wine took the upper-class route. Hearing the price was six taels of silver for a gift box, and even so, supply fell short of demand and it was often out of stock, Wang Yehao couldn't help clicking his tongue.

What concerned Wang Yehao most was the Proprietor Guo mentioned in the letter. A rootless and bottomless outsider merchant could actually earn such a large property in the Guangzhou market; it seemed he really had some background and means.

Originally, Wang Yehao only wanted to trace the whereabouts of the Universe Mirror. Now that things started to become complicated, he had to be more careful. He handed the report to Liu Zhao aside.

"Master, so saying, the Australian sea merchants really came back? Then the Universe Mirror..." Liu Zhao asked in surprise after reading it.

Wang Yehao raised his hand to stop Liu Zhao's words: "The authenticity of the Universe Mirror matter is hard to distinguish; temporarily cannot make it public."

"Subordinate understands. It's just that previously following Mr. Zhou to *Guangli*, it was indeed to search for an object. And observing his words and actions, it didn't seem fake."

Wang Yehao nodded slowly to express agreement. Indeed, if it weren't for searching for an object, there was absolutely no need to toss back to *Guangli*. Moreover, while in *Guangli*, Liu Zhao revealed many flaws according to Wang Yehao's intention, yet Hearthstone Daoist didn't show the slightest intention to take the opportunity to escape. What's more, later Hearthstone Immortal obediently followed Liu Zhao back to the capital. Wang Yehao's previous doubts were dispelled along with this.

"Leave aside the Universe Mirror first. What do you think of today's secret report?"

Liu Zhao thought for a while and said cautiously: "Master, subordinate has a guess; don't know if I should say it."

"Speak without harm."

"Previously when subordinate investigated in *Guangli*, there was no such person as Guo Yi. And according to Liu Sha, this person seems to have no foundation, yet could earn such a big scene in a short year. Hearing it, it is truly like a weird tale or legend. If without supernatural help, how could he succeed?"

"No foundation below, hard to guarantee no backer above. Even the sea merchants of Guangdong and Fujian cannot do without high officials and nobles operating in the court." Wang Yehao played with the wine bottle and cup in the exquisite *Guoshi Wushuang* gift box—he didn't like drinking fire wine, but this bottle and wine set were truly exquisite.

"Nine out of ten this person walks Gao Ju's path. Otherwise, an outsider like him selling Australian goods too—how could Gao Ju tolerate him?"

"What the Master says is true. Looking at the meaning in the letter, the relationship between Gao Ju and this Proprietor Guo seems quite harmonious..." Liu Zhao said, "Just don't know what exactly Gao Ju intends by supporting such a person."

Wang Yehao frowned tightly. He had already probed Gao Ju's background clearly; it was indeed a Big Eunuch in the palace. Although not a new noble from Prince Xin's residence, nor related to the Nine Thousand Years [Wei Zhongxian], his status in the palace was very stable currently.

Connecting these together, there seemed to be an answer. The suddenly popped-up Proprietor Guo was very likely an "Australian sea merchant" or their agent. For Gao Ju to do the Australians' business, he had to support him...

This made sense. For prudence's sake, it was better to investigate. After all, this Proprietor Guo was a mysterious and unfathomable "Australian"—and Hearthstone Immortal seemed particularly interested in Australians and even claimed to be an Australian too...

It seemed that Hearthstone Daoist claiming to be an "Australian" might not be nonsense for expediency; maybe they really were a gang.

"You spread out to ask if anyone in the court acts as his threshold [backer]. This Official shouldn't come forward in this matter. You find an excuse to probe for news at Fourth Uncle's place."

"Subordinate understands."

Wang Yehao put the Australian treasures on the table back into the box, threw the letter paper into the warmer, then asked lightly as if chatting about domestic trivia: "Has Hearthstone Daoist been behaving lately?"

"No abnormality. A style of a perfect wealthy idler; makes people quite envious." Liu Zhao answered with a smile.

"Hehe, silver won't be short for you. But there is one thing: must stare at him tightly." Wang Yehao picked up the tea cup and glanced at Liu Zhao, signaling he could withdraw.

About more than a month later, Liu Sha's second secret report was placed on Wang Yehao's desk.

"Investigated various ports in Guangzhou Prefecture; no Australian sea ships docked. Some say the wealth and goods sold by the Guo clan come from Lingao County, Qiongzhou Prefecture..."

"Lingao..." Wang Yehao put away the letter paper, muttering and savoring this place name at the edge of the sky and corner of the sea. Suddenly, a vague impression flashed in his mind.

"Wang Liang, quickly go find Mr. Jin. Let him look for official documents involving Lingao County in the past two years."

With the Eunuch Party fallen and his scholarly honor restored, Jin Wenchi increasingly felt that Wang Yehao was a boss who kept his word and was worth entrusting. So Jin Wenchi had been exceptionally diligent in doing things in the residence. Whether managing public and private documents or handling reception and seeing off, he did everything without a leak. Entering the residence for more than two years, the current Jin Wenchi had seemingly become a key figure in Master Wang's tent, specializing in handling various secret affairs.

These few days coincided with the New Year holiday rest. Originally there were no official documents to handle, a rare leisure time. But Master Wang suddenly wanted to check a remote small county, appearing to be some urgent matter. This made Jin Wenchi somewhat confused. However, strange as it was, the errand still had to be done. Important incoming and outgoing documents in the court were copied and archived in the Office of Transmission. For ease of management, there were also "Briefs" [Jie Lue] and "Yellow Stickers" [Tie Huang - Summaries attached to documents]. For convenience in handling affairs, Wang Yehao kept copied Yellow Sticker books in the home study.

But Lingao County was truly too small and remote; there were rarely relevant memorial subjects [Ti Ben]. Jin Wenchi and the document-managing private advisor rummaged for half a day before finding a few items.

Although there were only briefs, it was enough to understand the relevant matters. Jin Wenchi feared Master Wang wanted to see the memorial subjects, so he instructed the document-managing advisor to rush to the Office of Transmission to retrieve the relevant archived memorial subjects. He himself took the briefs to find Wang Yehao.

"Master, this Lingao County has neither produce nor is a strategic place. Memorial subjects involving this place are very few." Jin Wenchi said, "However, in the recent two years, there were indeed a few subjects involving this place. Originally they weren't important joints, only because the matters stated were堪称 strange tales, so there is a slight impression. This student has already asked Mr. Han to fetch the originals from the Office of Transmission."

"What matters were stated?"

Jin Wenchi took out the brief and replied: "Lingao County is located remotely. Except for occasional harassment by sea pirates, usually little is heard. The first case was an urgent document asking to suppress sea bandits, claiming more than five hundred shorn-hair sea thieves came driving big iron ships, intending to harm the countryside. However, the County Magistrate led village braves to resist and defend, keeping the city gate lostless. Although the thieves couldn't rob and plunder, they didn't retreat but built stockades and forts, bridged and paved roads, intending to occupy for a long time. Lingao County suffered from people's poverty and financial exhaustion, unable to drive them away, thus submitted a memorial to the court, hoping to send troops to clear and suppress."

Wang Yehao scanned the brief and burst into laughter: "Truly ridiculous. Driving ships is driving ships; how to drive *big iron ships*? Sea thieves repairing bridges and mending roads—then wouldn't the Jianzhou Slaves [Manchus] be distributing porridge and delivering grain?"

"This student also felt this matter had many absurd points, so tentatively read it as entertainment. However, the second matter has roots and evidence."

"Oh? Speak in detail." Wang Yehao said with interest.

"It was a memorial received around April or May last year. More than a thousand sea bandits under Old Liu Xiang landed to plunder. However, this time the Lingao Magistrate led village braves to attack proactively and won a complete victory, beheading hundreds of sea bandits and seizing countless flags, badges, armor, and blades."

"En, now that the Teacher mentions it, this Official also remembers. At that time, the court even discussed merits and bestowed rewards to commend his martial bravery."

"It is exactly this matter. As for other news, this student doesn't remember either."

Wang Yehao thought for a moment and felt something didn't make sense: "With the financial power and population of such a remote small county like Lingao, even if village braves were recruited, at most there would be no more than a hundred people. Wanting to kill back the attack of more than a thousand desperate sea bandits is simply an idiot talking about dreams."

"According to the Master's meaning, could it be Lingao County killed civilians to claim merit?"

"Incorrect." Wang Yehao shook his head. "Qiongzhou Prefecture is, after all, a peaceful boundary, not a place of turmoil and chaos of soldiers. The stationed troops locally are just Banner Army soldiers, usually dealing with a few local barbarians. They probably still can't do things like faking rewards. Moreover, Lingao County is not controlled by aristocratic families; this kind of thing can't be hidden at all."

"What the Master says is very true. This student also feels this matter is odd. If Lingao village braves could truly fight one against a hundred, then what worry about the disaster of sea bandits? Simply transfer them to the north to tread flat the Jianzhou Slaves; wouldn't that be more wonderful?"

Thinking back and forth with still no conclusion, Wang Yehao had to end the topic: "If there are subsequent documents involving Lingao County, trouble the Teacher to copy them all down."

"This student respectfully notes." Jin Wenchi bowed with hands cupped, then asked: "Only this Lingao County is poor mountains and evil waters [badlands], ten thousand li away. Why is the Master so attentive?"

"This matter has many oddities; this Official also has no clue yet. The Teacher just act accordingly."

"This student understands." Jin Wenchi withdrew tactfully.

"Could there really be a Universe Mirror? It seems I still have to find him to probe the bottom." Wang Yehao struggled for a long time, finally made up his mind, and instructed: "Wang Liang, prepare a few New Year gift items. Follow me to Mr. Zhou's residence tomorrow."
