# Chapter 2679: The Capital (Part 35)

"...Upon investigation, *Zizhenzhai* is a curio shop in Guangzhou Prefecture. It houses an in-house jewelry workshop, and the accessories they produce are exceptionally distinctive, commanding very high prices. Glazed glass cups, however, are not sold there but rather at another establishment called *Zichengji*. The various items displayed in this shop are all marketed as Australian foreign goods—each one exquisitely crafted. The shop is particularly renowned for its glazed glass vessels, including plates, cups, windows, and mirrors. They also sell wine in pure glazed glass bottles under the name *Guoshi Wushuang*—'The Incomparable'...

"Both shops are owned by the same person. This man is surnamed Guo, given name Yi, with his courtesy name unknown. He holds no academic degree nor comes from an aristocratic family, yet he has raised a towering ten-zhang building from bare ground and amassed a fortune of ten thousand gold seemingly overnight. There is also *Ziminglou*—the Purple Ming Pavilion—a den of entertainment and debauchery, a place where gold is squandered like water. His concubine, Lady Pei, manages it. Lady Pei, bearing the reputation of a top courtesan, maintains close connections with the gentry of Guangzhou. Wealthy young masters flock there like ducks to water, and merchants gather like clouds..."

Accompanying the secret report were several small boxes containing Australian goods that Liu Sha had purchased: several carved red lacquer powder boxes with silver mirrors inlaid inside. The style closely resembled what Wang Yehao had seen in Yangzhou before, though the materials seemed somewhat different. There were also two glazed glass bottles which, according to Liu Sha's report, contained *Guoshi Wushuang* wine. Although the wine itself was crystal clear, without a speck of turbidity—undoubtedly top-grade spirits—the transparent glazed glass bottle was even more valuable. Using such exquisite vessels to hold wine seemed rather like putting the cart before the horse. This wine, he realized, was the "fire wine" that Immortal Zhou had once suggested brewing. The difference was that Zhou had initially proposed a cheap, mass-market approach, while this wine had taken the upper-class route. Hearing that a gift box sold for six taels of silver, and that even at such a price supply still fell short of demand with frequent stockouts, Wang Yehao couldn't help clicking his tongue in astonishment.

What concerned Wang Yehao most was the Proprietor Guo mentioned in the letter. A rootless outsider merchant with no foundation whatsoever had somehow managed to earn such a substantial property in the Guangzhou market. This man clearly possessed some considerable background and means.

Originally, Wang Yehao had only wanted to trace the whereabouts of the Universe Mirror. Now that matters were becoming increasingly complicated, he had to proceed with greater caution. He handed the report to Liu Zhao, who stood beside him.

"Master, so you're saying the Australian sea merchants really have returned? Then the Universe Mirror..." Liu Zhao asked in surprise after reading it.

Wang Yehao raised his hand to cut off Liu Zhao's words. "The authenticity of the Universe Mirror matter is difficult to ascertain. For now, this cannot be made public."

"This subordinate understands. It's just that when I previously followed Mr. Zhou to *Guangli*, we were indeed searching for an object. And observing his words and actions, it did not seem like pretense."

Wang Yehao nodded slowly in agreement. Indeed, if they hadn't been searching for something, there would have been absolutely no need to make that return trip to *Guangli*. Moreover, while in *Guangli*, Liu Zhao had deliberately revealed many vulnerabilities according to Wang Yehao's instructions, yet Hearthstone Daoist had shown not the slightest intention of seizing the opportunity to escape. What's more, the Immortal had obediently followed Liu Zhao back to the capital afterward. Wang Yehao's previous doubts had been dispelled along the way.

"Set aside the Universe Mirror for now. What do you make of today's secret report?"

Liu Zhao considered for a moment before speaking cautiously. "Master, this subordinate has a speculation, though I'm uncertain whether I should voice it."

"Speak freely."

"When this subordinate previously investigated in *Guangli*, there was no such person as Guo Yi. And according to Liu Sha, this man seems to have no foundation whatsoever, yet somehow built such a grand enterprise within a single year. Hearing it told, it truly sounds like something from a weird tale or legend. Without supernatural aid, how could he possibly have succeeded?"

"No foundation below does not preclude a backer above. Even the sea merchants of Guangdong and Fujian cannot operate without high officials and nobles working on their behalf at court." Wang Yehao toyed with the wine bottle and cup in the exquisite *Guoshi Wushuang* gift box—he had no taste for fire wine, but the bottle and its accompanying set were truly magnificent.

"Nine chances out of ten, this man walks Gao Ju's path. Otherwise, an outsider like him also selling Australian goods—how would Gao Ju ever tolerate his presence?"

"What the Master says is quite true. Looking at the tone of the letter, the relationship between Gao Ju and this Proprietor Guo seems rather harmonious..." Liu Zhao said. "I simply wonder what exactly Gao Ju intends by supporting such a person."

Wang Yehao's brow furrowed deeply. He had already thoroughly investigated Gao Ju's background—the man was indeed connected to a powerful eunuch in the palace. Although not a new noble from Prince Xin's residence, nor related to the Nine Thousand Years Wei Zhongxian, his position in the palace remained quite stable for now.

Connecting these threads together, an answer seemed to emerge. The suddenly appearing Proprietor Guo was very likely either an "Australian sea merchant" himself or their agent. For Gao Ju to conduct business with the Australians, he would need to support someone like this...

The logic held. But for prudence's sake, further investigation was warranted. After all, this Proprietor Guo was a mysterious and unfathomable "Australian"—and Hearthstone Immortal had shown particular interest in Australians, even claiming to be one himself...

It seemed that Hearthstone Daoist's claim of being an "Australian" might not have been mere expedient nonsense after all. Perhaps they really were part of the same faction.

"Spread out and inquire whether anyone at court acts as his backer. This Official should not come forward personally in this matter. Find some excuse to probe for information at Fourth Uncle's place."

"This subordinate understands."

Wang Yehao placed the Australian treasures on the table back into their box and tossed the letter paper into the brazier. Then he asked lightly, as if making casual conversation about domestic trivia: "Has Hearthstone Daoist been behaving himself lately?"

"Nothing unusual. He leads the life of a perfect wealthy idler—it's quite enviable, really." Liu Zhao answered with a smile.

"Heh, silver won't be short for you. But there is one thing: you must keep close watch on him." Wang Yehao picked up his tea cup and glanced at Liu Zhao, signaling that he could withdraw.

About a month later, Liu Sha's second secret report was placed on Wang Yehao's desk.

"Investigated various ports in Guangzhou Prefecture. No Australian sea ships have docked. Some say the goods sold by the Guo clan come from Lingao County in Qiongzhou Prefecture..."

"Lingao..." Wang Yehao set aside the letter, murmuring the name of this remote place at the edge of the sky and corner of the sea, savoring it on his tongue. Suddenly, a vague impression flashed through his mind.

"Wang Liang, go quickly and find Mr. Jin. Have him search for any official documents involving Lingao County from the past two years."

With the Eunuch Party fallen and his scholarly honor restored, Jin Wenchi had come to feel increasingly that Wang Yehao was a master who kept his word—one worth entrusting his future to. Consequently, Jin Wenchi had been exceptionally diligent in his duties within the residence. Whether managing public and private documents or handling the reception and departure of guests, he performed everything without the slightest lapse. Having served in the residence for more than two years, Jin Wenchi had seemingly become a key figure in Master Wang's inner circle, specializing in handling various confidential affairs.

These past few days coincided with the New Year holiday rest. With no official documents to process, it was a rare period of leisure. But Master Wang had suddenly requested information on a remote small county, apparently regarding some urgent matter. This left Jin Wenchi somewhat puzzled. Strange as it was, however, the errand still needed to be done. Important incoming and outgoing documents at court were copied and archived in the Office of Transmission. For ease of management, there were also "Briefs" and "Yellow Stickers"—summaries attached to documents. For convenience in handling affairs, Wang Yehao kept copied Yellow Sticker books in his home study.

But Lingao County was truly too small and remote; relevant memorial documents were exceedingly rare. Jin Wenchi and the document-managing private advisor searched for half a day before finding a few items.

Although there were only briefs, they sufficed to understand the relevant matters. Fearing that Master Wang might want to see the actual memorial documents, Jin Wenchi instructed the document-managing advisor to hurry to the Office of Transmission to retrieve the relevant archived materials. He himself took the briefs to find Wang Yehao.

"Master, this Lingao County produces nothing of note and holds no strategic importance. Memorial documents involving this place are exceedingly scarce." Jin Wenchi said. "However, in recent years there were indeed a few documents concerning this place. Ordinarily they wouldn't merit attention, but because the matters described border on the fantastical, I retain a slight impression. This student has already asked Mr. Han to fetch the originals from the Office of Transmission."

"What matters were described?"

Jin Wenchi took out the brief and replied: "Lingao County is located in a remote region. Except for occasional harassment by sea pirates, little is usually heard of it. The first case was an urgent document requesting military suppression of sea bandits. It claimed that more than five hundred shorn-haired sea thieves had arrived aboard large iron ships, intending to ravage the countryside. However, the County Magistrate led village braves in resistance and defense, keeping the city gates secure. Although the thieves failed to rob and plunder, they did not retreat. Instead, they built stockades and forts, constructed bridges and paved roads—clearly intending to occupy the area permanently. Lingao County, suffering from poverty and financial exhaustion, was unable to drive them away and thus submitted a memorial to the court, hoping for troops to be sent for suppression."

Wang Yehao scanned the brief and burst into laughter. "Truly ridiculous. Sailing ships is one thing, but 'large iron ships'? And sea thieves repairing bridges and mending roads? By that logic, the Jianzhou Slaves should be distributing porridge and delivering grain!"

"This student also felt the matter contained many absurdities, so I tentatively read it as entertainment. However, the second matter has roots and evidence."

"Oh? Tell me more." Wang Yehao said with interest.

"It was a memorial received around April or May of last year. More than a thousand sea bandits under Old Liu Xiang landed to plunder. This time, however, the Lingao Magistrate led his village braves in a proactive attack and won a complete victory—beheading hundreds of sea bandits and seizing countless flags, badges, armor, and weapons."

"Ah, now that the Teacher mentions it, this Official also remembers. At the time, the court even discussed merits and bestowed rewards to commend his martial valor."

"It is precisely this matter. As for other news, this student cannot recall anything further."

Wang Yehao thought for a moment and felt something didn't add up. "Given the financial resources and population of such a remote small county as Lingao, even if village braves were recruited, they would number no more than a hundred at most. For them to counterattack and slaughter more than a thousand desperate sea bandits is simply an idiot's fantasy."

"According to the Master's meaning, could it be that Lingao County killed civilians to falsely claim military merit?"

"Not so." Wang Yehao shook his head. "Qiongzhou Prefecture is, after all, a peaceful region, not a place of turmoil and war. The troops stationed locally are merely Banner Army soldiers who usually deal with occasional local barbarian disturbances. They probably lack the capability for such deception. Moreover, Lingao County is not controlled by powerful aristocratic families—this kind of thing could not be concealed at all."

"What the Master says is quite true. This student also finds the matter strange. If Lingao's village braves could truly fight one against a hundred, then why worry about sea bandit disasters at all? Simply transfer them north to crush the Jianzhou Slaves—wouldn't that be even more splendid?"

After pondering back and forth without reaching any conclusion, Wang Yehao had to end the discussion. "If any subsequent documents involving Lingao County arise, I would trouble the Teacher to copy them all down."

"This student respectfully notes it." Jin Wenchi bowed with cupped hands, then asked: "It's just that this Lingao County lies in remote badlands, ten thousand li away. Why is the Master showing such interest?"

"This matter contains many oddities. This Official has no clear answer yet either. The Teacher need only act accordingly."

"This student understands." Jin Wenchi withdrew tactfully.

"Could there really be a Universe Mirror? It seems I must still seek him out to get to the bottom of this." Wang Yehao wrestled with the decision for a long time before finally making up his mind. He instructed: "Wang Liang, prepare a few New Year gifts. Accompany me to Mr. Zhou's residence tomorrow."
