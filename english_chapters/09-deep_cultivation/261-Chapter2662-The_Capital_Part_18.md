# Chapter 2662: The Capital (Part 18)

The three of them forewent horses, taking a mule cart directly back to Heliansheng.

They had barely washed their faces and taken their seats when a young fellow brought tea. An attendant entered from outside and reported, "Chief Escort, three guests are waiting outside requesting an audience."

Li Rufeng paid him no mind and said impatiently, "Guests from where? I'm occupied with family affairs and cannot attend to them. Turn them away. Tell them Li bows in thanks and will visit another day."

The attendant replied, "The visitors said they've come regarding Master Leng's matter."

Every heart in the room skipped a beat. Liao Sanniang blurted out in a low voice, "Someone arrives the moment we return. I doubt even Lingao's telegraph could work this fast."

"Their spies have been watching outside Delong for quite some time," Li Rufeng said.

Middlemen who proposed ransoms were typically relatives or friends of the victim, or influential local figures capable of handling such delicate affairs. Sometimes they would also seek out hooligans and rascals who colluded with greenwood bandits to bridge the two parties and ensure the transaction proceeded smoothly.

Government law forbade the redemption of kidnapped persons. Anyone caught proposing a ransom would be branded a bandit's relative or accomplice. After arrest, they faced severe torture and extortion. Thus, serving as a middleman carried tremendous risk—no one agreed without either connections or considerable benefit.

Li Rufeng's body froze as if nailed to the spot. His imposing figure stood at the doorway for a long moment. Then he turned abruptly, released Wu Kaidi's arm, strode back to the center of the living room, seated himself upright, and said in a deep voice, "Invite them in."

Before long, three large men walked into the hall in a triangular formation. Liao Sanniang, Wu Kaidi, and Little Bazi flanked the entrance on both sides. As the trio passed, all three scrutinized the visitors carefully. The leader had his head wrapped in blue cloth and wore a blue cloth straight gown. He possessed a burly frame, his waist bound tight, sleeves narrow, feet clad in black boots. The two behind him wore dark melon-skin caps, coarse short jackets, and hemp shoes, with leg wrappings wound around their calves—dressed like farmers.

All three had fierce faces and exposed chests. They walked with shoulders rolling and backs hunched, their gaits lacking any proper form. Though their clothes bore no patches, they were stained with oil and grime, appearing greasy and unwashed.

Seeing them enter, Li Rufeng rose slowly, ordered tea to be served, and cupped his hands to the three. He gestured toward the officials' hat chairs arranged below, indicating they should sit. "Where do the good fellows hail from?"

The leading big man returned the salute with cupped fists and laughed. "We've come specially to relieve the Chief Escort's worries."

Li Rufeng laughed as well. "Li can eat meat and drink wine. What worries could I possibly have?"

The big man gave a *heihei* laugh. "Without us brothers, I'm afraid the Bureau Chief cannot pass this *cold* autumn." He placed heavy emphasis on the word "cold"—*Leng*.

Hearing this, Li Rufeng's eyes narrowed slightly. "Those who travel far in the *Jianghu* make friends by the thousands. We in the escort business set up counters outside and seek our living on the knife's edge in this capital city, relying entirely on our friends' support. Since the good fellows are here, there's no need to hide or hedge, speaking in unrelated half-sentences. Honest men stand in the light—speak openly."

The big man raised his hand and spoke loudly, "The Bureau Chief is straightforward. We three brothers are from Sanhe County. We don't have proper nicknames; folks just call us Song Da, Wang San, and Liu Wu. We've earned a small reputation in the countryside. Master Leng has been 'dusted'—taken by the good fellows of Tianxuan Stronghold. My brothers were entrusted by Chief Hu of Tianxuan Stronghold to serve as middlemen, holding up both families with one hand to settle this matter."

Li Rufeng nodded. "That you're willing to act as middlemen—Li truly appreciates Brother Song's kindness. Brother Song is also a local power, so let us dispense with empty formalities. Simply name the time, place, method of exchange, and the amount. Let us trade as soon as possible."

He paused before continuing, "To burn incense, one must first see the true Buddha."

The big man called Song Da laughed. "Very well, let the Chief Escort see the true Buddha."

One of the men behind Song Da produced a cloth bundle from his bosom and presented it to Li Rufeng. Li Rufeng opened the bundle and found a lock of black hair inside.

Something felt wrong immediately. To serve as a token, it needed obvious identifying characteristics. Along with Leng Ningyun, a carriage and clothes had also been lost—those would serve as far better proof. Everyone had hair; there was no way to tell if this belonged to Leng Ningyun.

Li Rufeng frowned and passed the bundle to Liao Sanniang. She took it and ran the strands through her fingers. Though the hair was black like that of a strong man, the texture felt dry and withered. The owner seemed somewhat malnourished.

Leng Ningyun's hair was lustrous and full of shine. Liao Sanniang judged almost immediately that this was not his. She kept her conclusion to herself, walking slowly toward Song Da. With a pleasant expression and warm voice, she said, "Brother Song, I'll take this hair to let Master Leng's concubine identify it. If it proves genuine, everything becomes easy to discuss. Don't think this slave overly suspicious—any family suffering such an incident would be anxious. Yet there are always those wicked-hearted people; the more a family grieves, the more they want to exploit the danger for unrighteous wealth."

As she spoke, Liao Sanniang watched carefully. Song Da's face stiffened, and his body twisted with discomfort.

She nodded, then said abruptly, "The wind was fierce at the *Yin* hour last night, blowing in half a letter and a carved feather."

Song Da looked baffled. "Song retired early last night and didn't notice whether the wind outside was strong or weak."

Seeing that he knew nothing of the letter delivery, Liao Sanniang already had the measure of him.

She spoke again. "Curious. Both the Leng residence and Delong are managed by Mister Wu. If there were a matter to discuss, one would go to the Leng residence. Why did Brother Song seek out this escort agency instead?"

Song Da's heart tightened. He hurried to explain, "Who doesn't know that Heliansheng and Delong act as inside and outside for each other? I saw Master Wu arriving—"

Liao Sanniang giggled. "Everyone knows? I'm afraid not everyone. Brother Song must have been watching Master Wu's movements at the Leng residence to know he'd come here, yes?"

Song Da grew nervous. "Absolutely not!"

After speaking, he stood abruptly and said sternly, "The Leng residence lies quite far from here, and traveling back and forth takes time. Song has other matters today. Since you wish to verify, Song will pay another visit. I only ask the Bureau Chief to advance one thousand taels of 'Knock Silk' for Master Leng's food and lodging expenses these past days. Otherwise, I fear what arrives next time will be Master Leng's fingers and toes." He followed this with a sinister *heihei* sneer.

At these words, Liao Sanniang seemed to take fright. Her face paled slightly and she fell silent, pacing back two steps. She casually untied the slipknot of her cloak, then looked at Li Rufeng and stammered, "Ah, Chief Escort, this... what should we do?"

Li Rufeng studied Liao Sanniang, sighed, and furrowed his brow tightly. He nodded and called to his subordinates, "Why is Sanniangzi showing no hospitality at all? Go to the counter, withdraw one thousand taels of silver, and ask Brother Song to take it away. Whatever happens, we must ensure Master Leng remains unharmed."

Seeing Li Rufeng relent and the fellow departing to fetch the money, Song Da's tension eased involuntarily. Just as he was about to speak, Liao Sanniang glanced at the hair in her hand and said suddenly, "How strange. This looks like a dead man's hair."

Song Da's face changed. He blurted out, "How could it be? This was just cut off this morning." The moment the words left his mouth, he knew his mistake. His face went pale instantly.

Liao Sanniang smiled faintly, tossed the lock of hair casually to the ground, and said softly, "Brother Song, impersonating ransomers to frighten and extort a victim's relatives—if reported to the officials, who knows how many bamboo beatings you'll suffer and how much time you'll serve in prison?"

Cold sweat instantly covered Song Da's face. His fingertips trembled at his sides. His complexion turned iron-blue and gradually twisted with rage. He looked around and saw that Liao Sanniang stood closest to him—a mere weak woman. He suddenly roared, "Seize this woman! Take her hostage and fight our way out!"

The big man named Wang San drew a *jiewan* dagger from his waist, bellowed, and charged with the blade.

Liao Sanniang grabbed the cloak behind her and swept it through the air. The dark red fabric churned into a vertical crimson vortex at the center of the hall. The moment the vortex unfurled, it contracted sharply toward the center, swallowing Wang San's knife-wielding arm and wrapping tightly around both blade and limb.

Liao Sanniang set her right foot forward and left foot back. Her left hand seized Wang San's cloak-wrapped right hand while her right grasped his left wrist, pulling outward to give him the illusion that his arm was being drawn away from his body.

Wang San resisted, pulling back. Liao Sanniang instantly reversed her force and twisted against his momentum, pinning both his arms together and bunching them against the right side of his torso. His body tilted; his hands became inseparable.

She immediately pivoted her left foot back, stepping and turning to her left rear, cutting in front of Wang San's chest with her back now facing him. She released his wrist, supported his knee with her right hand, pulled with her left, and lifted with her right. Bending at the waist and arching her back, she used her spine as a fulcrum, driving power through her hips to carry Wang San vertically upside-down across her back before hurling him toward Song Da with gathered momentum.

Wang San's body crashed heavily onto the floor. The blue brick surface served as the best of weapons. He slammed onto his back against the massive slab with a resounding crash, feeling as though his very skeleton had shattered. His eyes rolled back, he coughed twice, and fell unconscious.

Little Bazi cheered from the side, "Sanniangzi's Godly Wrestling!"

He made to step forward and help after shouting, but a large hand held him back. He turned to find Li Rufeng shaking his head. "Sanniangzi has been pent up badly these past two days. Let her play and clear her mood."

Song Da found himself blocked by Wang San's thrown body. Liu Wu, on the other side, rushed forward instead. He reached out to grab the front of Liao Sanniang's clothes at her chest.

Liao Sanniang collapsed her chest, relaxing her muscles to absorb the impact and dissipate the incoming force. Her left hand shot out to seize Liu Wu's right shoulder while her right hand caught the upper part of his cross-collar. Exerting force with both arms simultaneously, she dragged and pressed him down and to her left. Liu Wu had intended to "attack directly when meeting weakness," planning to overpower Liao Sanniang with brute strength. He never expected this woman to possess such immense force—suddenly he was the weaker party. His head spun as offense and defense reversed in an instant.

Under the pull of tremendous force, Liu Wu's body tilted violently. To maintain balance, he instinctively stiffened in the opposite direction. Liao Sanniang seized this moment to release her grip, borrowing his counter-stiffening force to pull in the reverse direction while using the outer edge of her left foot to flick against the inside of his right foot, attempting to sweep his leg from the ground.

Liu Wu reacted with extraordinary speed. His right leg curled upward, evading Liao Sanniang's sweeping kick. But now he balanced on only his left foot, his body slightly unstable. He leaned forward and grabbed Liao Sanniang's lapel with both hands, fighting desperately to maintain his equilibrium.
