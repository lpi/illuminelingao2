# Chapter 2522: Continuing Empty Talk

Knowing Chen Bangyan's urgency, Li Suiqiu asked, "Lingbin has sharp insight; do you have any countermeasures?"

Chen Bangyan said, "The best time to oppose the Kun was when the Kun thieves first entered the city and their foundation was unstable, and Governor Xiong had not yet been defeated. If we had gathered righteous soldiers to coordinate with Governor Xiong from inside and outside, there might have been a chance to fight."

Kuang Lu said, "The Australians' firearms are sharp and far surpass ours. It is heard that one cannon shot can ravage tens of li; how can we fight them?"

"The state has nurtured scholars for three hundred years, yet those ministers who would die for their integrity are few and far between. A whole city of government troops gave up Guangzhou City with hands tied; it is truly hateful!" Li Suiqiu cursed.

"Among the gentry in Guangzhou, apart from Brother, most have already acknowledged the Kun people's rule," Chen Zisheng said. "Prime Minister He [He Wuzhou] has already visited the Kun Prefect Liu. He also went to the Luo Tian Grand Ritual at the Temple of the Five Immortals, and didn't even refuse to attend the collective wedding the Kun people held for prostitutes. Minister Li [Li Daiwen]'s clan cousin Li Kuozhong used to tyrannize the countryside and was punished by the Kun people; now the Li family is submissive. The Huo family is said to be cooperating with the Kun people to open an iron factory, and their Loyalty Battalion was also reorganized into the National Army, earning quite a few merits in bandit suppression. The Liang family has always been on good terms with the Kun people; that the Kun people could gain a foothold in the beginning was inseparable from the Liang family's care. But I don't know why, after the Kun people entered the city, the Liang family has kept a distance from the Kun thieves and hasn't made any move to cling to them."

"At least he, Liang Cunhou, still has some sense of shame!"

"Alas, now there are no reinforcements outside and no loyal men inside. Can we only lie low and wait for the opportunity?"

Indeed, in the face of absolute strength, no conspiracy or trickery could stir up any waves. The few of them talked in circles, naturally unable to come up with any countermeasures to expel the giant bandits.

Li Suiqiu turned to Chen Zizhuang, wanting to know if his teacher had any method. "Teacher, do you think the imperial court has any plan for a punitive expedition?"

Chen Zizhuang didn't say much because his heart was like a bright mirror: the Kun thieves' separatist power was already established. In today's Great Ming, the court was full of factional disputes and foul atmosphere, and frontier officials were executed at every turn. Externally, affairs in Liaodong were eroding, and they feared the enemy like tigers. Internally, natural disasters occurred continuously, and peasant uprisings rose from all directions. The Emperor's ancestral grave had been dug up by hungry peasant rebels just a few days ago, and the memorial asking the Emperor to issue a "Penitential Edict" was written by him. With the Kun thieves occupying Lingnan, the Great Ming was like a leaking broken ship with one more hole; with too many lice, one doesn't worry about biting. Could there really be so-called interaction between heaven and man?

Chen Zizhuang stood up, walked to Chen Bangyan, and asked, "Lingbin, who do you think is stronger, the Kun people's Fubo Army or the Eastern Barbarians' [Manchu] soldiers?"

Chen Bangyan thought for a moment and said, "The Fubo Army should be considered stronger."

"Correct." Chen Zizhuang stroked his goatee with his right hand and nodded slightly, expressing appreciation.

Chen Bangyan continued, "Nowadays, the only troops of the court capable of fighting are the border troops, all in Guanning, which cannot be moved lightly. The inland troops have long been out of battle, lack the power to attack fortifications, and are short of provisions and pay; they are only passable for suppressing roving bandits like Li and Zhang. Wang Zunde first lost the standing army of Guangdong, so the province has no usable troops. The sharpness of the Kun thieves' military force far exceeds that of the Jurchens. Only by mobilizing troops from several provinces and besieging them with ten times the force might there be something to be done. It's just..."

"Just what?" Kuang Lu asked.

"It's just that if there were someone in our dynasty who could repel the Kun thieves' army, why would we let the Eastern Barbarians commit violence along the Nine Borders, entering as if into uninhabited land?"

"If the Emperor hadn't killed Governor Yuan [Yuan Chonghuan], even if he was dismissed and returned to his hometown, with Governor Yuan sitting in Guangzhou Prefecture, things would certainly not have come to this." Kuang Lu felt somewhat regretful; he still held a shred of lucky hope in his heart.

Li Suiqiu said, "The matter of Lord Yuan has indeed disheartened many loyal and righteous men. Yanke [Li Yunlong], Zhifu [Zhang Erguo], Lizhong [Zeng Qishen], Weiyang [Liang Chaozhong], Zuxin [Han Zonglai], and others often met with me at Jizuo's [Luo Binwang] Sanmu Hall (in Fangcao Street, east of Guangzhou City) to talk freely about current affairs, taking saving the world as their own responsibility. Yanke was once a staff member for Lord Yuan and followed him to fight in Liaodong. After Lord Yuan was executed, Yanke saw through the red dust, took Zen Master Kongyin as his teacher, and shaved his head to become a monk. After Yanke escaped into the emptiness gate, the others all had intentions of becoming monks. Zhifu and Lizhong intended to go to Huangyan Temple in Jiangxi to pay respects to Zen Master Kongyin together, but alas, the Kun thieves entered the city, and they didn't make the trip in the end."

A heavy breath inadvertently came from Chen Zizhuang. The blow of Yuan Chonghuan's death to the scholars of Guangzhou was immensely significant. After a moment of silence, Chen Zizhuang asked, "Meizhou, you are on good terms with the gentlemen of the Fu Society. Do you know if people in the Fu Society have dealings with the Kun people?"

Li Suiqiu thought for a moment. "The gentlemen of the Fu Society associate with scholars of brilliant literary talent. I haven't heard of coarse characters like the Kun people. However, I have seen quite a few Australian foreign goods in the home of Tianru [Zhang Pu]... What does Teacher mean?"

"The Liang residence had a distinguished guest. Although Lord Liang didn't say it, this old man can guess eighty or ninety percent." Chen Zizhuang stroked his beard and said, "If it were a local relative or friend, there would be no need for such concealment. Lord Liang comes from a family of officials, and his family friends are mostly in Jiangnan. I'm afraid it was someone from the Fu Society."

Li Suiqiu suddenly realized and said, "I heard Yan Zian [Yan Du] and Yan Rengong [Yan Wushun] of the Hangzhou Reading Society mention that a Wanbi Book Society opened in the city a few years ago. The boss is a Sanshui scholar who built a Phoenix Villa on the old site of the Southern Song Imperial City. Besides the book society, the silk business is also quite large-scale, but the books sold are said to be different from the ordinary, especially that set of 'Commentaries and Subcommentaries on the Thirteen Classics'... That's right, the 'Commentaries and Subcommentaries on the Thirteen Classics' are Australian goods! Later, a black ship emitting black smoke also went to outside Hangzhou City!"

Chen Zizhuang also recalled some past events when he was in the capital. in recent years, Australian foreign goods were not very rare in the capital; it seemed they had also been seen in the imperial palace. Many high officials and nobles in the capital deposited silver in the Delong Bank. Hearing the name, one knew it had the same backer as the Delong Bank in Guangzhou. It seemed the Australians' tentacles were definitely not limited to Lingnan.

"Master Gao, Gao Ju, who is now very popular in front of the Australian Prefect, is said to have connections inside the Palace!" Kuang Lu also remembered.

When these pieces of information from different sources were pieced together, a huge network of tentacles slowly revealed itself before everyone's eyes. From the capital above to Suzhou and Hangzhou below, and south to Qiongzhou, there had long been infiltration by the Kun thieves. This forced them to believe that this group of maritime merchants claiming to be descendants of the Great Song was indeed dreaming the Spring and Autumn dream of "restoring the country," and was implementing their plan step by step.

"I didn't expect, I didn't expect that for so many years, among the numerous gentlemen in the court, not a single one exposed the Australians' conspiracy. Deceiving the sovereign and disrespecting superiors! My Great Ming's three hundred years of rivers and mountains are finished!" Li Suiqiu roared angrily.

"If we had known this earlier, Governor Wang should have gathered soldiers from five provinces back then, while their wings were not yet full, and besieged and suppressed them with three armies. It wouldn't have resulted in today's disaster!" Chen Bangyan also spoke with deep heartache.

Li Suiqiu said, "When Governor Wang suppressed the Kun thieves back then, there were not a few officials in Guangzhou, big and small, who opposed it. Some even claimed Governor Wang was recklessly starting border provocations. In reality, who among them hadn't taken bribes from the Kun thieves?"

Just at this moment, hurried footsteps came from outside, and the rear hall instantly fell silent.

"Master! Master!" It turned out to be Chen Zizhuang's eldest son, Chen Shangyong.

Chen Zizhuang scolded sternly, "Didn't I say that without my permission, no one is allowed to come to the rear hall?"

"Master! Mr. Lv has been waiting in the front hall for the time it takes to burn a stick of incense, saying he has a matter requiring a face-to-face meeting." Chen Shangyong said aggressively.

"Which Mr. Lv?" Kuang Lu asked.

"Lv Yizhong, the Kun thieves' Guangdong Region Councilor... the one who used to be Governor Wang's staff member..." Chen Zisheng answered.

"Hmph," Li Suiqiu said disdainfully, "Shameless person, he still has the face to come see Teacher!"

Since being captured by the Senate in the Battle of Chengmai, Lv Yizhong had surrendered to the Senate and become Guo Yi's staff member. After Liu Xiang took over Guo Yi's work, Lv Yizhong, relying on his familiarity with Guangzhou officialdom, offered many strategies to Liu Xiang and was now the right-hand man of "Prefect Liu," obtaining a formal official title of "Councilor." A group of sour scholars in the city made up a joke about him, saying he didn't become a "Councilor" in the Great Ming but became a "Councilor" of the "Kun Song."

Jokes aside, purely in terms of pacifying the gentry in the city quickly, Lv Yizhong's running around played a not insignificant role. It was just that Chen Zizhuang had never given him a good face, making him quite embarrassed.

In the past, when Lv Yizhong came to visit, Chen Zizhuang avoided seeing him with various excuses, even leaving Guangzhou City where there were many eyes and ears. Unexpectedly, he found his way to Shabei Village. Chen Zizhuang knew that avoiding seeing him wasn't a permanent solution. Since he had come, he would meet this skillful broker.

"Shangyong, ask Lv Yizhong to wait a moment; I'll come right after."

Not long after, Chen Zizhuang passed through the winding corridor and arrived at the front hall.

Lv Yizhong was calm and composed, sipping tea from a cup. Hearing footsteps and finally seeing Master Qiutao, who had repeatedly made him hit a wall, he quickly put down the cup, stood up and bowed, smiling, "Master Qiutao, I trust you have been well since we parted!"

Chen Zizhuang was expressionless. He neither returned the bow nor exchanged pleasantries. He sat down heavily on his own and answered in a cold tone, "I wonder what business brings Mr. Lv here?"

"Hehe, this student comes firstly to pay respects to the old master, and secondly, under the orders of Mayor Liu of the Municipal Government..."

"If you are here to be a lobbyist, persuading me to defect to the Australians and take up a puppet position, then there is no need." Chen Zizhuang interrupted him directly.

Lv Yizhong thought to himself: *You are the number one gentry in Lingnan. If you had come to offer your services when the Senate first entered the city, the Senate might have put you in an important position. But I repeatedly requested to see you to no avail; I suppose you disdain being a guest of honor of the Senate. Now that Guangdong and Guangxi are settled and no one can stir up waves, don't say you don't want to—whether the Senate is willing to have you is still a question mark.*

However, Lv Yizhong still maintained his demeanor and didn't forget to offer some flattery. He smiled and said, "The old master has both literary talent and military strategy. If you are willing to serve the Great Song and serve your hometown, that is naturally excellent; if the old master wishes to live leisurely in the forest, my Great Song Senate will not force anyone. I came this time on Mayor Liu's special instructions to meet the master in person and convey a matter face-to-face."

"Whatever matter it is, just tell the servants. Why must you see me?" Chen Zizhuang only lifted his eyelids.

"This matter is very important. If I only speak to servants, I fear there may be errors or misunderstandings, so I requested a face-to-face meeting."
