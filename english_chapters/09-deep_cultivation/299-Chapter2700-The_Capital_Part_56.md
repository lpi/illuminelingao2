# Chapter 2700: The Capital (Part 56)

The column moved slowly forward, its seemingly loose formation imperceptibly divided into front, middle, and rear sections, with flank guards on either side. A large dog with a dappled back ran back and forth within the procession, occasionally barking excitedly.

Liao Sanniang and Little Bazi rode side by side, one on a horse and one on a donkey, one tall and one short.

Little Bazi lifted his face and asked, "Adoptive Mother, why have you come to this Capital region instead of enjoying your blessings in Guangzhou?"

Liao Sanniang said, "In the past, when I was at home, the village school teacher said, 'Men do not speak of affairs within, women do not speak of affairs without. A woman is one who submits to others.' I lived in Guangzhou for ten years, following my father and brothers in the escort business, rushing through prefectures and crashing through capitals. Although I was a woman, I killed and fought ruthlessly, acting only on impulse. I prided myself on having 'fists strong enough to stand a man, arms strong enough to run a horse,' a resounding hero among women. But when I went to Lingao, I realized there was a different kind of world. Lingao is different. Women can discuss state affairs, take examinations, work, and become officials. Not just empty titles, but officials with real duties and assignments. Female officials run about serving in various ministries and yamens, exhausting their abilities to serve the public. I never imagined women could live like that. Looking back on my past, I was merely delighting in private fights to show off my own strength. Truthfully, what is there to be proud of in hacking down a few more bandits? How does that benefit the people?"

Liao Sanniang paused, then continued: "I traveled everywhere as an escort, coming from the Great Ming to Guangdong. I was an anomaly among women and saw more than others. In these turbulent times, no one suffers more misery and pain than women. In the past, when I moved with the Great Song Army, I saw that among the Ming troops, each soldier would lead three to five women by ropes. A unit of a few hundred men would drag along and hold captive a thousand women, forcing them into rape day and night, and killing them for food when provisions ran out. The scenes and circumstances, being in the midst of it, were like falling into a freezing hell—horrific and terrifying."

Liao Sanniang said, "Since last year, I've gradually felt my body isn't as agile as in my youth. I reckon with my strength, I can still fight for another six or seven years. While I can still wield a saber, I signed up to come to Beijing. I didn't need to come to this capital, but I came because I want to exert some strength, to do something. To add a handful of soil to the grave of this Great Ming, so the sickness of this world can heal faster, and women can escape this endless suffering sooner. Only under the rule of the Great Song can this wish be fulfilled."

Liao Sanniang continued, "Chief Du said women's liberation consists of only three things: first, marriage; second, culture; third, independence. If these three things are done well, women will be liberated. The women of the Great Ming need husbands to support them, relying on others all their lives: obeying the father at home, the husband after marriage, the son after the husband's death, and the in-laws if there are no close kin. The Confucian word 'Chastity' imprisons all women under heaven, denying them happiness, freedom, and autonomy. But in the Great Song, the father need not be the guide of the son, nor the husband the guide of the wife. Women must also have their own independent lives. Half the population are women; if women are mobilized, awakened, and given things to do, they can hold up *half the falling sky*. They can converge into a great surging tide. When men and women both exert their full abilities, that is the thunder that fills the heavens. Chief Du has short hair and wears light makeup or a plain face, looking improper. The male Chiefs don't like her, but she believes in herself, and there is light in her eyes. Before I entered the capital, I saw her. She patted my shoulder and said if I returned to Guangdong, I should work at the Women's Federation. She said the great curtain of Confucianism has oppressed women for a thousand years, and now, she wants to tear open this dark sky for the women of the world."

Liao Sanniang paused here, then said, "That day I said: Good. Pierce the vast sky. I will be a drop of blood on the tip of your blade."

Speaking of this, Liao Sanniang seemed to recall the scene of that day. Her expression was somewhat wistful, clearly showing a complex mix of emotions in her heart.

Little Bazi obviously didn't understand. He listened blankly, and after a moment, he said firmly, "In the future, I want to be an escort master like Adoptive Mother."

Liao Sanniang gave a faint smile and said, "The escort business has at most ten good years left. When we get to Guangdong, I will find you a different path with a future."

Little Bazi was startled. "Why is that?"

Liao Sanniang said, "When the four directions are pacified and the times are peaceful for the people, that will also be the time when the escort business sinks into silence. Besides..."

At this point, Liao Sanniang touched the saber hilt at her left waist, then touched the gun handle on her right, saying somewhat forlornly, "The time of the saber is passing."

Two short barks pulled their attention back.

Liao Sanniang gently pulled the reins. The three-point line formed by hand, rein, and horse's head broke, and the horse's head tilted to the side. she sniffed the air, vigilantly scanning her surroundings, then looked at the guard dog scouting ahead of the column.

Escort bureaus always kept dogs. For pathfinding, keeping watch at night, and camping in dangerous places, raising a good dog was the only way to sleep soundly at night.

Ahead of the column, a large wolf-dog with a dappled back barked low a few times, then crouched halfway down, its nose pointing toward the grass ahead, growling low in its throat.

Liao Sanniang pursed her lips at Little Bazi. Little Bazi immediately vaulted off his donkey, jogging briskly to the front of the column. As he ran, he fished a slingshot from his waist pouch. He made a short stop, pushing his arms forward and pulling back, loading a mud pellet into the leather pouch. He fired three successive shots—*bang bang bang*—into the grass where the dog was pointing.

The mud pellets cracked upon impact, kicking up a puff of dust. It was unclear if they hit anything.

On the mule cart, Old Feng pursed his lips and gave a whistle. The dappled wolf-dog immediately kicked off with all four paws, shooting straight into the grass.

A human figure leaped up from the grass. The wolf-dog lunged forward in mid-air. Immediately, a cold blade-light flashed. The wolf-dog collided with the blade-light in mid-air and was bounced away. The dog curled its body and fell to the ground, rolling several times. When it stood up again, there was a knife wound on its shoulder blade, its fur matted with gray soil mixed with blood.

The wolf-dog wanted to find an opportunity to attack again, but Liao Sanniang shouted loudly, "Leash the dog, guard the cart! I'll take him."

Old Feng gave a whistle, and the dog immediately stood its ground, lowering its brow and baring its teeth, growling ferociously at the person lurking in the grass.

Zhao Liangjian, Liu Chang, and several fellows gathered into a circular formation, protecting the mule cart in the center.

By now, everyone could see that the person was a dirty-clothed, lean and muscular big man holding a Japanese-style waist saber. Having forced back the wolf-dog, he immediately ran toward the woods on the nearby hillside. Liao Sanniang's group had horses and carts; the man could only escape if he entered the complex terrain and obstacles of the mountain forest.

While the man was entangled with the wolf-dog, Little Bazi had bent low and sprinted. Anticipating the big man's retreat route, he cut diagonally up the hillside with quick steps to block the man's escape.

The big man's face changed drastically. Left with no choice, he sprinted wildly along the main road, hoping to find a chance to flee into the forest. Little Bazi trailed him by some distance, chasing closely and occasionally firing one or two mud pellets to force him to change course, pressing him back toward the road shoulder.

Liao Sanniang narrowed her eyes and tapped her legs lightly against the horse's girth. Sensing her intent to advance, the horse quickly transitioned from standstill to a trot, maintaining a cadence of about two hundred steps per minute. Liao Sanniang held the double reins in her left hand, and with her right, she drew a steel cavalry saber from the side of the horse. The saber was over three *chi* and one *cun* long, with a slightly curved blade, similar in length and form to the sabers used by Lingao cavalry, only lacking the D-shaped guard.

The double sabers Liao Sanniang used on foot were slightly shorter than single sabers and unsuitable for use on horseback.

The big man heard the hoofbeats behind him getting closer. Every time a hoof landed, it struck a clear two-step beat, carrying an unhurried pressure.

The big man ran faster, his violent panting making his heart feel like it would explode.

Liao Sanniang rested the saber against her right shoulder, cradling it. As the horse's speed increased, she gradually closed in on the target. Liao Sanniang bent her right knee slightly, kept her left hip taut, and circled the saber half a turn outward from her right shoulder, raising it high in preparation to chop.

Liao Sanniang exhaled lightly, estimating the distance between them based on experience. With two dynamic objects constantly closing in, she had to account for both the big man's running speed and the horse's speed to calculate the lead for the chop; otherwise, she would miss.

Knowing escape was impossible, the big man whirled around abruptly. With a loud roar and a ferocious expression, he raised his saber to meet her.

Liao Sanniang was unmoved by the big man's roar. Once she determined the enemy was within attack range, she immediately leaned forward, pivoted her right back, and decisive swung her saber.

The blade cleared the horse's head, slashing diagonally downward at a forty-five-degree angle from right to left, aiming straight for the target's head.

In the instant man and horse crossed, the big man raised his saber to parry diagonally. The strong sections of the two steel blades—the rear third—collided with a loud clang.

The blades met, and the horse's momentum carried it forward. Liao Sanniang flipped her wrist. Following the downward momentum of the chop, she swung the saber backward, turning the chop into a reverse upward slice, completing a full fan-shaped trajectory.

Under the combined impact of Liao Sanniang and the horse, the big man's waist saber was knocked askew. The momentary lag prevented him from recovering his stance. The tip of Liao Sanniang's backward slice sliced open the tendon of the big man's right elbow, drawning a deep bloody groove. The big man's right hand went limp, unable to hold the blade, and the single saber fell to the ground with a clang.

Liao Sanniang didn't care if the blade hit or not; she absolutely did not tangle. Disengaging after one strike, she spurred the horse out of the enemy's attack circle, rushing a distance away before turning the horse's head.

By this time, Little Bazi had caught up from behind. He threw away his slingshot and drew an elbow-length sharp carving knife from his waist. He ran up to the big man, kicked the fallen single saber away, then held the steel knife horizontally. He used the spine and flat of the blade to slap the big man's head fiercely. The big man, suffering heavy blows, felt his brain buzz and faint. Unsteady on his feet, he fell over. Little Bazi held the sharp knife crosswise in his mouth, flipped over to straddle him, pinned him down firmly, and pulled out a rope from his waist to bind him.

Liao Sanniang circled her horse back, jumped down, and walked slowly to the big man. She announced loudly: "White dragon horse, pear-flower spear, everywhere under heaven is home. Greenwood line, Jianghu mouth, all within the Nine Provinces and Four Seas are friends. We have not met before; Hero of the mountain road, which famous mountain do you lean on?"

The big man, bound on the ground with his right arm bleeding, only stared fiercely at the two with ferocious eyes, not answering.

Seeing the big man couldn't match the bandit jargon (*qiekou*), Liao Sanniang knew he wasn't a *jianghu* man of the North.

At this moment, Little Bazi grabbed the man by the collar. Seeing the shirt underneath, which was so dirty its color was almost indistinguishable, he paused for a moment, then shouted, "This fellow is wearing a red-and-yellow reversible padded jacket underneath. He's likely a deserter from the army."
