# Chapter 2714: The Capital (Part 70)

"Heliansheng has letter bureaus at all major wharves and trading ports inside and outside the capital. Just send letters to this address. If there's anything urgent, send someone to Old Jiang's Pottery Shop inside the Guang'an Gate barbican and use Code Ten."

Min Zhanlian's squad spent a day at the inn carefully reading the intelligence received from Wu Kaidi. Min Zhanlian thought: "This matter is indeed thorny!"

An escort bureau like Heliansheng—whether the two managers Li and Liao or the escort masters under them—were all seasoned *Jianghu* veterans, "ground worms" of the capital. Escort masters knew the ins and outs of kidnapping for ransom like the back of their hands. Combined with a massive bankroll, by all rights, whether ransoming or rescuing the person, they should have settled this long ago. Instead, not only was there no headway at all, they had fallen into a passive position.

It seemed the other side wasn't ordinary *Jianghu* bandits. There was a good chance they were people from the court.

What distinguished Min Zhanlian most from Li and Liao was that although his time basking in the glory of the Senate was limited, his seniority in the *Jianghu* was far deeper than theirs.

"...The other side demanded one hundred thousand taels of silver but hasn't given a follow-up delivery location. It's truly puzzling," Little Qian said. "For a hostage of such importance, the principle is quick in, quick out. Who ever heard of dragging things out for half a month?"

Everyone agreed the situation was suspicious—extraordinary events must have extraordinary causes. Min Zhanlian vaguely felt there was something peculiar here.

Zhou Ruolan pored over the materials again and again, then suddenly said, "There's a problem here."

Everyone knew there was a problem. They all waited to hear what she would say next.

"In my view, I'm afraid the kidnappers aren't of one mind."

"What?" Everyone was startled. They were all old *Jianghu* hands. There had been many strange points in this case from start to finish, but no one had articulated such a conclusion.

"How do you figure?"

"I've done kidnapping jobs before in the praise. What's the key to kidnapping? Quick in, quick out. Dragging things out is the biggest taboo," Zhou Ruolan said. "If the victim's family needs to raise money, you have no choice but to wait while hiding the hostage. If searchers get close, you have to transfer them. Whether hiding or transferring, it all costs money. Now the victim's family has plenty of money, and they've hung out the cloth strip as required, ready to pay at any time. Why won't the kidnappers hand over the person?"

"Maybe he's dead..." someone said in a low voice.

Everyone drew a sharp breath. It was indeed not impossible.

"We can't determine whether he's alive or dead right now," Zhou Ruolan continued. "But the kidnappers' actions are quite strange. First, they agreed to ransom but haven't provided a delivery location or time. Second, Delong's banknotes can circulate anywhere, yet they demand silver. How do they plan to receive, transport, and hide one hundred thousand taels of silver? Aren't they afraid that after we ransom the person, we'll track them down and take the silver back? Even if we don't, the scent of one hundred thousand taels will make everyone on the road drool; everyone will want a bite. Can they protect that silver?"

"They don't dare take Delong's notes..." Little Qian said.

"If they don't dare take Delong's notes, they could ask Delong for notes from a Shanxi bank—according to this intelligence, the Shanxi banks are also involved in this matter. They have no reason not to accept them." Zhou Ruolan picked up a pen and drew several circles on the paper, then made an inference diagram with arrows.

"Based on the intelligence from the Escort Bureau and what everyone's gathered these past few days, my view is that the upper and lower levels of the kidnappers aren't on the same page. The person masterminding the plan doesn't want silver; wanting silver is the underlings acting on their own."

This inference left everyone baffled. They had been in the *Jianghu* for years, had been kidnappers, had rescued hostages; they had experienced or heard of at least dozens of cases, but they had never heard of kidnappers with two different agendas.

"How is that possible?!" Someone immediately shook his head. "Kidnappers work in small gangs; the boss directly commands the brothers below. The boss isn't dead. Sending ransom letters follows the rules—that's done by his trusted men. On the perimeter, there are people listening for trouble. How could anyone act on their own? This isn't the government..."

Only in an organization like the government, with numerous layers and uneven, tangled interests, would you get such a disconnect between upper and lower levels.

"In my view, this matter likely involves people from the official side," Zhou Ruolan said in a low voice. "The Shanxi banks being involved is already suspicious. The bandits who tried to rob the silver cart had eunuchs mixed in to monitor them. From the confessions, it doesn't seem like a simple bandit job."

"I'm also puzzled by this: the silver was originally ransom money. They could openly exchange the person for money. Why deliberately leak information to incite bandits to rob the cart? What good does that do them? And why go to the trouble of sending two eunuchs along?" Little Li also chimed in.

Everyone looked confused. They didn't quite agree with Zhou Ruolan's reasoning, but they couldn't explain these strange points themselves either.

"Let's not worry about how many agendas there are. Let's find the person first," Min Zhanlian knew that getting caught up in these details would only make them lose direction. He asked, "Little Li, how did your investigation of the altars and temples go?"

"Of the several altars and temples, I've only checked the Temple of Heaven and the Sun and Moon Altars so far. Nothing found."

The capital's various altars and temples covered vast areas but were rarely used. Most of the time they sat empty. By the dynasty's end, management was lax. Aside from the main buildings and roads, which were still in good condition, many other structures had fallen into decay. Trees went unpruned, grass grew as thick as a forest, making searching even harder.

The altars and temples were places for imperial sacrifices and state ceremonies. By rights, security should be tight. In reality, because of their vast size and infrequent use, guards were few, and door checks and patrols were virtually nonexistent. Many kidnappers in the capital colluded with the soldiers and petty officials guarding these altars, using them as hiding places for hostages. Min Zhanlian naturally knew these inner workings, which was why he had focused on these places from the start.

"The Heliansheng people have also been checking the altars, temples, and gardens. No useful leads."

Min Zhanlian took a deep breath. "We can't be sure of that."

"Sure of what?"

"If this really was done by people from the official side, it'll be hard to handle. 'A lone wolf doesn't fight power'—even a local tyrant won't offend officials just to earn a few extra coins."

"You're saying someone gave a warning?"

"It's possible," Min Zhanlian said. "Sister Lan makes a good point. We need to be on guard."

"So what do we do?" Everyone's faces showed anxiety. If officials really were involved, the capital's *Jianghu* forces couldn't be used by them. After all, they were outsiders, newcomers, and losing their information sources in such a vast capital would be like searching for a needle in the sea.

Min Zhanlian pondered. The situation was more difficult than he had anticipated. Actually, he somewhat agreed with Zhou Ruolan's thinking. Given Heliansheng's years of operation in the capital and their generous spending of money, leads should have come in long ago. Yet after more than ten days, nothing had been found. Possibly even their every move was being watched closely. The kidnappers' power was great enough to force the capital's urban foxes and social rats to keep silent.

Now it was almost impossible to rely on local informants for leads; they would have to investigate themselves. Min Zhanlian thought for a moment and said, "It seems we'll have to do this ourselves! Tomorrow we'll leave Zhangjiawan..."

Before he finished speaking, Old Ten, who was keeping watch at the courtyard gate, suddenly knocked and entered:

"Boss! Master Cao requests an audience."

Everyone in the room became alert. Master Cao was the "sitting tiger" of Zhangjiawan Town. They had come to lodge here and, as was proper, had paid respects at his pier. By rights, since they weren't doing business in Zhangjiawan and were only resting temporarily, paying respects should have been the end of it. There was absolutely no reason for the boss himself to come visiting.

"Invite him in." Min Zhanlian didn't hesitate, then added, "Little Qian, you accompany me to see him. Everyone else, return to your rooms."

"Boss, should we...?"

"No need," Min Zhanlian shook his head. "We're on his turf. If he really wanted to deal with us, wouldn't it just take a word from him? Why would he personally come and take the risk?"

As Min Zhanlian expected, Master Cao brought only two servants in blue, traveling light.

Master Cao was named Cao Sheng, originally a grain transport banner soldier on the Tongzhou section of the Grand Canal. Life was hard for Ming military households; life for canal banner soldiers was even harder. Though only middle-aged, he looked as old as a man in his fifties or sixties. Though his face was aged, beneath his brocade robe was a body of solid muscle.

His sudden visit was phrased very politely, but beating around the bush, it boiled down to one question: What are you doing in Zhangjiawan?

By rights, Min Zhanlian had already explained his purpose when paying respects at the pier: they were going to the capital "on business"; Zhangjiawan was just a temporary stop, not interfering with local affairs. Having made that statement, Master Cao should have been satisfied. *Jianghu* people lied and deceived all the time, but few dared lie to a local boss's face.

Min Zhanlian naturally repeated himself. Cao Sheng nodded slightly and said, "Normally I shouldn't pry, but I'm quite interested in this 'business.' Might you enlighten me?"

For *Jianghu* people, this was quite rude. Extraordinary events must have extraordinary causes. Min Zhanlian decided to draw him out and asked in return:

"Master Cao! What wind is blowing outside that makes you ask these questions?"

This question was both probing and expressing displeasure. Cao Sheng understood immediately and hastened to say:

"It's not that I don't know the rules; I simply have no choice!" Cao Sheng looked apologetic. He wouldn't normally be so polite, but the other party's appearance and bearing weren't those of ordinary highway robbers—they were likely people who did big deals. There was no need to offend such desperate men.

"Oh? Which big boss from which road, and what big event, has the wind blowing all the way to Zhangjiawan?"

"Hehe, in this capital, apart from *them*, who else has such power!" Cao Sheng smiled bitterly. "Who doesn't have to give them face!"

Though unnamed, it was obvious. Min Zhanlian's heart jolted. He quickly put on a surprised expression. "I see! I spoke out of turn."
