# Chapter 2496: Burning the Building (Part 9)

Wu Mu thought to himself: *What major matters could they have? Obviously, it must be laying groundwork for anti-Senate activities. After all, we've put considerable pressure on Liang Cunhou and local forces recently; they must have noticed. This meeting is most likely to discuss countermeasures or make a major decision...*

He asked: "Is it possible to catch them all in one net at the alliance meeting?"

Yang Cao shook her head. "The card only indicates a gathering point. The location on each card differs. Upon arrival, they'll be blindfolded with black cloth and guided by specialized personnel. Each attendee can bring only one son or nephew as a disciple. Long-distance tracking, unclear enemy situation and terrain—a hastily organized assault can't succeed."

"What do you propose?"

Yang Cao hesitated, then spoke her plan: "Hit our way in. We can never see clearly through window paper."

"Send who? Too risky, isn't it?"

"Xu Tong. He hasn't shown his face to outsiders. He's steady. I don't feel comfortable with others."

"Must we send our own people? Through what channel?"

Yang Cao nodded. "Outsiders can't see or understand many things, can't distinguish what's important. Time is too short, and there are no other suitable candidates. The channel is through Li Baiqing. He was one of the insiders when Guangzhou city fell. Following our requirements, he went underground after the city was taken, then moved back to Old Li's Walled Village. He's never been exposed. One of his sons was secretly absorbed into the municipal government under an alias and hasn't been made public. Very reliable—he's definitely not playing both sides. Old Li's Walled Village is a large estate. More than forty young men inside have joined the Heavenly Gate Daoist Society, all under his sect. Xu Tong will attend this alliance meeting as his distant nephew from out of town. As for danger..."

She glanced at Xu Tong beside her. Xu Tong smiled and took up the thread: "Isn't this what we do?"

Wu Mu was silent for a long while, finally saying: "Prepare support well. Pay attention to safety."

Outside Iron Beam Temple, Daoist Mushi gazed deeply toward the layers of reeds before him, low and wordless. Darkness spread endlessly in the twilight, smearing Daoist Mushi's evening silhouette like a devil lurking in shadows, waiting to devour prey.

This place was a "sand accumulation" in the Pearl River Delta's water network—very remote. Many years ago, pious men and women of unknown origin had built a small temple here, inviting a few monks to worship gods and Buddhas. Over the years, the temple fell into abandonment, the monks scattered, and even the Buddhist statues disappeared, leaving only three halls. Even locals had forgotten the temple's original name, referring to it simply as "Iron Beam Temple."

Iron Beam Temple sat deep in the sandbar, surrounded by dense river branches and bays, overgrown with reeds and mangroves. Without local *Dan* households who knew the waterways well, even traces of the road leading to the temple couldn't be found. Consequently, bandits had occupied it for years. A perfectly good place for cultivation had become a bandit's den.

Black night had fallen. Inside the side hall of Iron Beam Temple, on an old table sat several dishes of meat and vegetables and two jars of inferior wine. Daoist Mushi and a long-faced big man sat on opposite sides. The man was under forty, with a robust physique, gloomy complexion, and steady demeanor. Daoist Mushi stood, holding the pot in his right hand while his left slightly blocked and supported his right sleeve. He leaned forward to pour a cup for the big man first, then filled his own. Raising both hands level with his chest, he toasted: "This matter relied heavily on Brother Yun's planning to secure an introduction to Seat Marshal Xue and achieve this outcome. Nothing to offer in respect—please drink this cup fully."

But Yun Ting only raised his wine cup slightly with one hand, drained it in one gulp, and said indifferently: "Yun is a disabled man dismissed from office; I can't bear the Daoist priest's excessive praise. That day, without Young Master Liang extending a helping hand and funding with grain and fodder, my brothers would either have gone without food and clothing, gathered in the mountains to howl, or become ghosts under the Bald Thieves' blades. Since the Daoist priest came to me with the Young Master's token, and his letter entrusted me heavily again, Yun naturally should assist with all strength. But my brothers are few—gathering a few dozen capable hands isn't easy. We can't throw away lives lightly. Matters of killing and fighting must not involve us. Ugly words said upfront—the Daoist priest should be clear on this."

Daoist Mushi smiled slightly. "You're overthinking. Not to mention Brother Yun's subordinates excel at spying and infiltrating—just look at Governor Wang's army of tens of thousands. To the Bald people, it was but a flick of the finger to ash. How dare I harbor such delusions? This time relies entirely on Brother Yun mediating and contacting in the middle, pulling in righteous men from the Heavenly Gate Daoist Society, Buddha Fragrance Society, One Universe Primeval Way, Green Stone Fortress, and others to achieve this alliance meeting. When we speak with one voice and unite the various paths, shaking the region—achieving great things might not be impossible."

Yun Ting only looked coldly at Daoist Mushi. "To speak frankly, Yun thinks moving lightly right now is unwise. Nowadays, Guangzhou Prefecture has strict surveillance, spider webs densely distributed. Former personnel retained in city and outside government bureaus have mostly been dismissed, replaced, investigated, or arrested. Various news channels are gradually being cut off. The Bald people's steps are tight, pressing in one by one. Young Master Liang said in his letter he would fund heavily this time, but I fear future transmissions will be difficult. Presumably his activities have already been investigated by the Bald Thieves. I observe that the Young Master's letter seems to know things cannot be done—it already carries implications of entrustment, intending to complete his integrity with his body. Those of us who cling to him, since we feel harmony is difficult, might as well disperse here. This way we can still preserve our respective lives and families."

Hearing this, Daoist Mushi's body stiffened slightly, then he suddenly sneered. "That statement is greatly absurd. The Young Master saw through the Bald Thieves' wolfish ambition long ago, planning painstakingly for years. Where pieces are placed is obscure and secluded—only now will the strength be shown. Why must Second Brother Yun make this dejected attitude? You know the Bald people very deeply. Looking at Young Master Liang's writing, though he understands the Bald people's shortcomings and strengths, he blindly exaggerates their abilities. In this poor Daoist's view, it seems you've been scared witless by the Bald Thieves, losing your own sharp spirit for nothing. Right now, though Young Master Liang sits trapped in Guangzhou Prefecture, the chess game is just set up. He needn't preside personally. The Young Master has entrusted all matters and relationships to me. Second Brother Yun, rest easy. In the court, there's Master Stone to rely on as Mount Tai; in the countryside, there's Brother Yun to draw as my arm. Everything still has great potential. This is exactly the time to display ambitions—why be dejected? Moreover, Brother had old grudges with the Bald people when wearing the Flying Fish Robe. If not serving the court, where does the road ahead go? Are you hoping for the Bald people's three courteous solicitations? The things Brother Yun does are shady and secretive—running errands for Young Master Liang, contacting rural clan elders, fortress lords, and society heads, issuing handbills, probing Baldy intelligence. You have human lives on your hands. The incident will happen sooner or later; there's absolutely no luck. Where will you serve your body then? Moreover, living out your days in mediocrity—can Brother Yun be willing? Right now, you have only two paths: death or leaving. Today I point out this clear road to Brother Yun—you should cherish it..."

Yun Ting lowered his head. Under the dim oil lamp, his complexion couldn't be seen clearly. Only the hand holding the wine cup froze firmly in mid-air. Silent for a long while, he finally sighed lightly. "This goes without saying; I should do my best. Only maintaining and pulling relationships across various paths isn't easy. It took several years of management by Young Master Liang and me to achieve this situation. Daoist priest, be absolutely cautious—cherish our painstaking efforts."

Daoist Mushi laughed. "Brother Yun, in the past, Young Master Liang and I researched the *Record of Broad Knowledge of Heaven's Affairs* in detail, discussing Baldy situations freely. Though the Bald people act cautiously, this bunch of overseas barbarians pretending to be Song descendants aren't completely without flaws. Brother Yun knows Baldy situations well; presumably you already know."

He picked up a mouthful of food, took a small sip of wine, and continued: "The Bald people's armor is sharp, but though elite, they're few. Scatter them across all of Guangdong and it's like throwing sand into the sea—difficult to attack fortifications or fight field battles. Gather them in one place and it's hard to control the countryside. Baldy soldiers consume huge amounts of money, grain, gunpowder, and armor. Raising one soldier costs ten times what our dynasty's soldiers cost. Nowadays, Bald people send pseudo-officials wandering through the countryside every ten days, called Grain Collection Teams, yet they rarely levy from small commoners—only coercing scholars, gentry, and grain households. Since ancient times, imperial power didn't reach down to the *Li* and *Jia*. Rural people were governed by clan laws. Scholars were treated preferentially and exempted from paying money and grain; loyalty and chastity were commended to propagate moral transformation. Since then, none of this exists. It's caused boiling resentment in the countryside. Gentry and wealthy households are all worried and confused. Now we can manipulate from above and below, stirring up a storm."

Yun Ting nodded gently. "When I discussed Baldy situations with the Young Master, we often shared this view. That is, actions should be sooner rather than later. Shake their foundation while the Bald people's footing is unstable. The longer the time, the harder to achieve things. The Bald people are especially skilled at bewitching hearts. But when first arriving, ignorant men and women haven't received their benefits; officials and cadres haven't gone down to the *Li* and *Jia*. Authority hasn't been established; grace hasn't been bestowed. Combined with the Bald Thieves' notorious reputation when conquering Guangzhou Prefecture, we propagate wantonly to terrify rural people, then supplement with indoctrination of the ignorant through benevolence, righteousness, and divine teachings. Merging with all heroes in societies, mountains, and fortresses, connecting with big households in the countryside, we can still accomplish things. If time delays, small people will inevitably be bewitched by them. By then, Bald people will conscript soldiers widely and dispatch officials broadly. Once their foundation is firm, there will be no place for us to exist."

Speaking of this, Yun Ting shook his head. "Though words are so, the saying goes 'accumulate thickly to erupt thinly.' The power we've accumulated is like drifting stalks and floating duckweed. Now the court's soldiers and horses haven't arrived; the opportunity hasn't come. I fear it's hard to gain momentum. Launching now is too forced."

Daoist Mushi gritted his teeth tightly and said fiercely: "As you say, but time waits for no one. Right now, we can still give it a fight. Waiting for the Bald Thieves to rectify the region at leisure—with their means of bewitching people, I fear we'll melt away like ice and snow, disappearing into invisibility. Right now, falsely claiming the court's soldiers and horses are about to arrive, launching a round, pulling everyone onto the boat regardless—just wrapping up relatives and rural dependents in one go. These people will have no retreat, only able to follow us on one road to death. The Bald Thieves, even when suppressing, will have to slaughter wantonly. With killing filling the wilds—the heavier the slaughter, the deeper the enmity, the more people hate them. Only when the water is muddied can we act conveniently."

Yun Ting's heart skipped a beat. His gaze burned, staring at Daoist Mushi. "The Daoist priest plans good methods."

Daoist Mushi feigned compassion, sighed lightly. "Being in the midst of it, I'm forced to it. But how to act still needs Brother Yun's guidance."

Yun Ting lowered his head and pondered for a long while, slowly leaning back against his chair. His upper body submerged into shadow. The dim lamp in the room flickered, reflecting Yun Ting's face flickering bright and dark. A cold voice came from the darkness: "To make trouble for the Bald Thieves, Yun hasn't thought deeply yet. Tentatively, I have a few shallow opinions."
