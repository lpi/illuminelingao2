# Chapter 2496: Burning the Building (Part 9)

Wu Mu thought to himself: *What major matters could they have? No need to think; it must be to lay some groundwork for the next step of anti-Senate activities. After all, we have put relatively high pressure on Liang Cunhou and various local forces recently; they must have noticed. This meeting is mostly to discuss certain countermeasures or decide on a major decision...*

He asked: "Is it possible to catch them all in one net directly at the alliance meeting?"

Yang Cao shook her head: "The card only indicates a gathering point. The location on each card is different. Upon arrival, they will be blindfolded with black cloth and guided by specialized personnel. Each attendee can only bring one son or nephew as a disciple. Long-distance tracking, unclear enemy situation and terrain—a temporarily organized assault cannot succeed."

Wu Mu asked: "What do you plan?"

Yang Cao hesitated for a moment, then finally spoke her plan: "Hit our way in! We can never see clearly through window paper."

"Send who? Too risky, right?"

"Xu Tong. He hasn't shown his face in front of outsiders. He is relatively steady. I don't feel at ease with others."

"Must we send our own people? Through what channel?"

Yang Cao nodded and said: "Outsiders can't see or understand many things and can't distinguish the importance of information. Time is too tight, and there are no other suitable candidates. The channel is through Li Baiqing. He was one of the insiders when Guangzhou city was broken. According to our requirements, he lurked after the city broke, then moved back to live in Old Li's Walled Village. He has never been exposed. One of his sons was secretly absorbed into the municipal government under an alias and hasn't been made public either. Very reliable; it is certain he is not a two-faced person. Old Li's Walled Village is a large estate. inside, more than forty young men joined the Heavenly Gate Daoist Society, all under his sect. Xu Tong will attend this alliance meeting accompanying him as his distant nephew from out of town. As for danger..."

Speaking of this, Yang Cao glanced at Xu Tong beside her. Xu Tong smiled and took up the conversation: "Isn't this what we do?"

Wu Mu was silent for a long while, finally saying: "Prepare support well. Pay attention to safety."

Outside Iron Beam Temple (Tieliang Si), Daoist Mushi's gaze looked deeply toward the layers of reeds in front of him, low and wordless. Darkness spread endlessly in the twilight, smearing Daoist Mushi's evening silhouette like a devil lurking in the shadows, waiting to devour people.

This place was a "sand accumulation" in the water network land of the Pearl River Delta, very remote. Many years ago, it was unknown where pious men and women came from to build a small temple here, inviting a few monks to worship gods and Buddhas. However, over the years, the temple was abandoned, monks within scattered, and even Buddhist statues did not remain, leaving only three halls. Even locals did not know the original name of this temple, only referring to it as "Iron Beam Temple."

Iron Beam Temple was located deep in the sandbar, surrounded by dense river branches and bays, overgrown with reeds and mangroves. If not for local *Dan* households who knew the waterways well, even the traces of the road entering the temple could not be found. Therefore, it had been occupied by bandits for many years. A perfectly good place for cultivation had fallen into a bandit's den.

The black night had sunk. Inside the side hall of Iron Beam Temple, on an old table, were several dishes of meat and vegetables and two jars of inferior wine. Daoist Mushi and a long-faced big man sat on the left and right respectively. That man was under forty, with a robust physique, gloomy complexion, and steady demeanor. Daoist Mushi stood up, holding the pot in his right hand, left hand slightly blocking and supporting his right sleeve, leaning forward to pour a cup for the big man first, then filling his own. He raised both hands level to his chest and toasted: "This matter relied much on Brother Yun's planning to be recommended to Seat Marshal Xue, achieving this matter. Nothing to offer as respect; please drink this cup fully."

However, Yun Ting only raised his wine cup slightly with one hand, drank it dry in one gulp, and said indifferently: "Yun is a disabled person dismissed from office; I cannot bear the Daoist priest's absurd praise. That day, without Young Master Liang extending a helping hand and funding with grain and fodder, I fear my brothers would either have no food and clothing, gather in the mountains to scream, or become ghosts under the Bald Thieves' knives. Since the Daoist priest held the Young Master's token to find me, and the Young Master's letter entrusted heavily again, Yun naturally should assist with all strength. But my brothers are few; gathering dozens of hands and feet is not easy. We cannot throw away life and death lightly. Matters of fighting and killing must not involve us. Ugly words said upfront; the Daoist priest must be clear in heart."

Daoist Mushi smiled slightly and said: "Overthinking deeply. Not to mention Brother Yun's subordinates are good at spying and infiltrating, just looking at Governor Wang's army of tens of thousands that day, to the Bald people, it was but a flick of finger to fly ash. How dare I harbor such delusions? This time relies entirely on Brother Yun mediating and contacting in the middle, pulling in righteous men from the Heavenly Gate Daoist Society, Buddha Fragrance Society, One Universe Primeval Way, Green Stone Fortress, and others to achieve this alliance meeting. At that time, same voice and same breath, various ways united, shaking the locality—it might not be impossible to achieve things."

Yun Ting only looked coldly at Daoist Mushi and said: "To tell the truth, Yun thinks it is not suitable to move lightly right now. Nowadays, Guangzhou Prefecture has strict ears and eyes, spider webs densely distributed. Former personnel retained in city and outside government yamens and various ministries in the past were mostly dismissed, replaced, investigated, or arrested. Various news channels are gradually cut off. The Bald people's steps are tight, pressing in one by one. Young Master Liang said in the letter to fund heavily this time, but I fear it will be hard to entrust transmission again in the future. Presumably, his conduct has already been investigated by the Bald Thieves. I observed that the Young Master's letter seems to know things cannot be done and already has implications of entrustment, intending to complete his integrity with his body. We people who cling to him, since we feel things are hard to harmonize, might as well disperse here; this way we can still preserve our respective lives and families."

Hearing this, Daoist Mushi's body stiffened slightly, then suddenly sneered and said: "This statement is greatly absurd. The Young Master saw through the Bald Thieves' wolfish ambition long ago, planning painstakingly for many years. Where pieces are placed is obscure and secluded; only at this time will the strength be shown. Why must Second Brother Yun make this dejected attitude? You know the Bald people very deeply, and looking at Young Master Liang's writing, although understanding the Bald people's shortcomings and strengths, he blindly exaggerates their ability. In this poor Daoist's view, it seems you have been scared out of your wits by the Bald Thieves, losing your own sharp spirit for no reason. Right now, although Young Master Liang sits trapped in Guangzhou Prefecture, the chess game is just set up. No need for him to preside personally. The Young Master has entrusted all matters and relationships to me. Second Brother Yun, relax your heart. In the court, there is Master Stone to rely on as Mount Tai; in the countryside, there is Brother Yun to draw as arm assistance. Everything still has great potential. It is exactly the time to display ambitions; how can you be depressed? Moreover, Brother had old grudges with the Bald people when wearing the Flying Fish Robe. If not serving the court, where does the road ahead go? Could it be you are hoping for the Bald people's three visits of solicitation? The things Brother Yun does are shady and secretive, running errands for Young Master Liang, contacting rural clan elders, fortress lords, and society heads, issuing handbills, probing Baldy intelligence. You also have human lives on your hands. The incident will happen sooner or later; there is absolutely no luck. Where will you serve your bodies then? Moreover, living the rest of life mediocrely, can Brother Yun be willing? Right now, Brother Yun has only two paths: death or leaving. Today I point out this clear road to Brother Yun; Brother Yun should cherish it well. The Bald people have a slang saying 'crisis and opportunity coexist.' Words are rough but reason is smooth. If you can exert great effort this time and establish merit, openly there will be court rewards for merit, and secretly there will be Master Stone operating on your behalf. Not to mention reinstatement, rising high up in the clouds is just around the corner."

Yun Ting lowered his head. Under the dim oil lamp, his complexion couldn't be seen clearly. Only the hand holding the wine cup stopped firmly in mid-air. Silent for a long while, he then sighed lightly and said: "This goes without saying; I should do my best. Only maintaining and pulling relationships of various roads is not easy. It took several years of management by Young Master Liang and me to have this situation. Daoist priest, be absolutely cautious; cherish our painstaking efforts."

Daoist Mushi laughed: "Brother Yun, in the past, Young Master Liang and I researched the *Record of Broad Knowledge of Heaven's Affairs* (Heaven Tilting) in detail in the room, discussing Baldy situations freely. Although the Bald people act cautiously, this bunch of overseas barbarians pretending to be Song descendants are not without flaws completely. Brother Yun knows Baldy situations well; presumably, you already know."

Saying this, he picked up a mouthful of food, took a small sip of wine, and continued: "The Bald people's armor is sharp, but although elite, they are few. Scattering them across the whole of Guangdong is like throwing sand into the sea; difficult to attack fortifications and fight field battles. If gathered in one place, it is hard to control the countryside. Baldy soldiers consume huge amounts of money, grain, gunpowder, and armor. One soldier raised costs ten times that of our dynasty's soldiers. Nowadays, Bald people send pseudo-officials to wander in the countryside every ten days, called Grain Collection Teams, yet they rarely levy from small commoners, only blindly coercing scholars, gentry, and grain households. Since ancient times, imperial power did not go down to the *Li* and *Jia* (neighborhood admin units). Rural people were governed by clan laws. Scholars were treated preferentially and exempted from paying money and grain; loyalty and chastity were commended to propagate moral transformation. Since then, none existed. It caused boiling resentment among people in the countryside. Gentry and wealthy households are all worried and confused. At this time, we can exactly manipulate up and down, stirring up a storm for him."

Yun Ting nodded gently and said: "When I discussed Baldy situations with the Young Master, we also often had this view. That is, actions should be sooner rather than later. Shake their foundation while the Bald people's footing is unstable. The longer the time, the harder to achieve things. Because the Bald people are best at bewitching people's hearts. But when first arriving, ignorant men and women haven't received their benefits; officials and cadres haven't gone down to the *Li* and *Jia*. Authority hasn't been established; kindness hasn't been bestowed. coupled with the Bald Thieves' notorious reputation when conquering Guangzhou Prefecture, we propagate wantonly to make rural people terrified, then supplement with indoctrination of ignorant people by benevolence, righteousness, and divine ways. merging with all heroes in societies, mountains, and fortresses, connecting with big households in the countryside, we can also display a thing or two. If time delays, small people will inevitably be bewitched by them. By then, Bald people will conscript soldiers widely and dispatch officials broadly. Waiting until their foundation is firm, there will be no place for us to exist."

Speaking of this, Yun Ting shook his head again and said: "Although words are so, so-called 'accumulate thickly to erupt thinly,' the power we accumulated is like drifting stalks and floating duckweed. Now the court's soldiers and horses haven't arrived; the opportunity hasn't come. I'm afraid it's hard to become a climate. Launching now is too forced."

Daoist Mushi gritted his teeth tightly and said fiercely: "As you said, but time waits for no one. At this time, we can still give it a fight. Waiting for the Bald Thieves to slow down their hands to rectify the locality, with their means of bewitching people, fear it will be like ice melting and snow dissolving, disappearing into invisibility. Right now, falsely claiming the court's soldiers and horses are about to arrive, launching a round, pulling onto the boat regardless of who, just wrapping up those relatives and rural dependents in one go—these people will have no retreat, only able to follow us on one road to death. The Bald Thieves, even if suppress, will have to kill wantonly. Killing people filling the wild—the heavier the slaughter, the deeper the enmity, the more people hate them. Only when the water is muddied can we act conveniently."

Yun Ting's heart skipped a beat. His gaze burned, staring at Daoist Mushi, and said: "Daoist priest plans good means."

Daoist Mushi feigned compassion, sighed lightly, and said: "Being in the midst of it, forced to do it. Just how to act still needs Brother Yun to give more guidance."

Yun Ting lowered his head and pondered for a long while, slowly leaning his body back against the chair back. His upper body submerged into the shadow. The dim lamp in the room jumped, reflecting Yun Ting's face flickering bright and dark. A cold voice came from the darkness: "To make trouble for the Bald Thieves, Yun hasn't thought deeply yet, tentatively have a few shallow opinions."
