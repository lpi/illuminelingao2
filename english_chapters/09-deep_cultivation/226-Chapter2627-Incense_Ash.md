# Chapter 2627: Incense Ash

"Jin Zhu, Jin Zhu, cough, cough, don't talk nonsense, don't talk nonsense." Mother Li saw her son speaking without obstruction, hurriedly patted her son a few times while coughing, then put palms together to bow to four directions, praying in low voice for gods all over sky not to blame her son. After bowing, she said to Jin Zhu again, "Jin Zhu, don't talk nonsense. Fairy Huang has true Daoist cultivation. Some days ago..."

While speaking, Lian Niang trotted back. Obviously someone told her her own man came. Behind followed the family's big yellow dog, shaking head and wagging tail, running front and back. Seeing that Lian Niang, age just twenty-five or six, wearing cotton skirt and thorn hairpin (simple clothes). Although a farmer wife, she dressed neatly. Just that waist tied a red belt, chest also sewn with a patch of Eight Trigrams pattern, truly somewhat violating harmony.

Jin Zhu saw Lian Niang dressed in such nondescript attire, couldn't help nameless fire rising again. Casually grabbed the whisk on the Eight Immortals table, throwing it at Lian Niang covering head and face. Lian Niang dodged. The whisk fell in front of the yellow dog. That dog jumped backward in fright, erecting tail and raising head about to bark wildly. But seeing its own owner's face was iron blue, whimpered a few times, clamped tail and ran elsewhere.

Only heard Jin Zhu cursing in the room: "Old mother at home is sick, you this woman only know playing and frolicking outside. Sky dark not returning home either. Don't know what benefit, having your soul sucked away too."

Lian Niang stood at the door. Seeing husband didn't go get chicken feather duster, only then entered room carefully, standing guarding room door, defending softly: "I went following Fairy Huang to cultivate magic. That Huang..."

Jin Zhu heard "Fairy Huang" wanted to abduct and sell his own wife again, opened mouth wanting to curse again. Suddenly thought mother already said just now, so held back breath again, only staring at Lian Niang angrily.

Lian Niang looked at man's face color, said carefully: "Fairy Huang is a personal disciple of Lishan Holy Mother, having true fairy arts. A few days ago, I begged for talisman water; after going home letting mother-in-law take it, mother-in-law coughed less."

Mother Li also didn't cover mouth coughing lightly, chiming in on the side, "Exactly, exactly. Taking that talisman water, these few days, my chest is not stuffy, breath is also smooth."

Jin Zhu looked at mother's illness condition seeming indeed much better than previous days. At least since he entered room, didn't hear heart-tearing lung-splitting coughing sound. Also seeing wife looking like lowering eyebrows and complying eyes, anger also reduced a few points. Tone slightly slowed, "Look at you! What clothes are you wearing? What proper style!"

"Just convenient for cultivating magic. You don't like, slave family won't wear it." Lian Niang saw husband's face color relaxed, probably no danger of being beaten today. Hurriedly diverted topic, "Rice is already done. Since bringing loach back, I will clean it now."

Saying deftly packed up bundle and pouch taken off by Jin Zhu. Took out a short wax end from side room again. After lighting, supported with a saucer placing on table. Turned and asked Mother Li: "What else does Mother-in-law want to eat? I will make together."

Mother Li shook head saying: "I already drank porridge in the afternoon. Loach I won't eat; will go to sleep in a while. You make these loaches all for Jin Zhu; you two eat together."

Jin Zhu's gaze was attracted by that candle. Seeing fire light bright, and no foul smell of grease, knew it was expensive "Australian Wax." Immediately said: "That loach was caught to cure Mother's cough disease. I plan to stay at home for more days this time; not lacking this moment either. Just casually make some food is fine. Where did you get silver money to buy this Australian Wax?"

Lian Niang saw man's tone turned gentle, only then had courage to size him up by candle light. Seeing Jin Zhu didn't wear shoes, went to side room to take a pair of new straw shoes out again. placing in front of Jin Zhu's feet while answering: "Begged Fairy Huang to bestow. Originally intended to insert in lantern. You came then give you to use first. This Australian Wax is indeed bright; lighting it has no burnt stink either. Loach I keep first; today get a few to ensure rice for you first." Saying, holding an oil lamp to kitchen to prepare meal for man.

Jin Zhu didn't say much either. Carrying shoes went to well side to fetch water to wash feet. After putting on shoes, returned to room to pack up things bought home this time.

Not long after, Lian Niang carried half a pot of porridge boiled with vegetables and loach mixed together. Porridge was not clear like usual; rice put was very much. Taking a pottery bowl, first filled a full bowl for Jin Zhu.

Jin Zhu looked at porridge, first pointed to jars and pots on table, "Two jars of Heaven Kitchen Pickles (*Tianchu Jiangcai*); you and Mother change taste at home. A pack of fine salt you keep well; don't let get damp. That colored pack is Australian fruit candy; you distribute a few to neighbor kids, remaining you and Mother taste fresh too." Saying holding up bowl, wolfing down. Carrying rice walking for half a day, truly hungry too. Divided by three five and two (quickly) ate large half of small half pot of porridge. Originally he could still eat more, but to save grain, ate as little as possible at night. Besides wife and old mother hadn't eaten dinner yet. Immediately wiped mouth saying "Full," reclining comfortably in bamboo back chair to rest.

Lian Niang served mother-in-law eating some porridge helping to East Room to rest. Herself finished all remaining porridge, cleaned up table bowls and chopsticks. Then wanted to put away items he brought back on table.

Jin Zhu said in low voice: "In bundle still have two one-hundred-fen notes, keep first. In my pouch still have some remaining small change; you see if enough eighty *wen*. Medicine money owed to Brother Youtian family I will go return tomorrow."

After Senate promoted new currency system, original plan was one Yuan exchange one hundred Fen. But value of one Yuan was too big. Even one Fen still had problem of face value too big, unfavorable for small amount circulation in market. So changed to one Yuan exchange one thousand Fen.

This exchange rate was basically similar to original one tael silver exchange one thousand *wen*; folks accepted relatively easier. Exchange rate was fixed, simpler and clearer than exchange rate fluctuating daily in past. Currency value was also stable. Though paper money, it was quite welcomed by folks suffering from shortage of small amount payment means. Just unit of this "Fen" was still habitually read as "Wen" by majority people.

"When you were not at home, Sister-in-law Youtian came to urge and ask several times. I didn't know how to reply her." Lian Niang sighed a breath, "Forcing too tight too."

"Brother Youtian willing to lend is already not bad; didn't ask us for interest money either." Jin Zhu sighed with emotion, "How many people in village willing to lend money to family? Sigh, even two brothers, refusing to send Old Mother's paddy on time."

Because Jin Zhu supported old mother, besides receiving three straw rooms, his two brothers stated clearly to send one hundred *jin* of paddy together annually. But this paddy frankly speaking never sent fully. Short *jin* lack *liang* was normal state; inside also stuffed quite some blighted grain and rice straw. Converting to coarse rice, one year not even thirty or forty *jin*.

Although Jin Zhu complained, he also knew two brothers' days were not easy. More than ten *mu* land passed down from father divided into two. Two brothers rented planting to pay rent, also had to feed family. Being able to take out fifty *jin* paddy was already squeezed out hard from teeth gaps.

If could also rent a few *mu* land to plant would be good. Jin Zhu calculated in heart. Short-term work income was not too stable, and hurt body. He worked for a few years, waist and legs pained often. Colleagues working long, every one fell waist and leg pain disease. Serious ones couldn't even walk road, let alone work. Finally couldn't avoid ending up dying of poverty and illness mixed—this rear dust he didn't want to step.

Loading unloading carrying on wharf, always not long-term plan.

But wanting to ask clan to "Bestow Grace" again was not easy. Speaking of land, clan released reclaiming sand fields by river every year, but this kind of good thing couldn't turn to his kind of "Fake Clansman." Only see if had chance to rent a few *mu* clan field to farm again.

"If could ask Master to open grace, renting a few *mu* land to plant would be good." He said in low voice.

Just wanting to beg Master Li family "Bestow Grace" also needed a cause. Pity Lian Niang was a rough work servant girl in Li family; couldn't speak words before master. Mother because helped as servant in Li residence in past, had some popularity. Just these years body always sick, didn't often go to ask peace and walk around either. Wanting to entrust request was not good to open mouth. Besides, thing like releasing rent couldn't be done without a generous gift. Home now didn't have this idle money either...

While checking, Lian Niang came out from kitchen, holding a small bowl of yellow wine in hand placing on table, saying somewhat heart-achingly: "That big pack of Australian candy, cost quite some money right?"

Jin Zhu was somewhat embarrassed instead. That candy was picked up on road from wharf to warehouse. He originally dared not take back directly, keeping in hand for a few days. Seeing no one coming to look for it, then put away. Now had to lie: "Warehouse manager saw work done well, rewarded."

Lian Niang's face carried smile. Own man had big ability, capability to support family; nothing was better than this. She took out a small paper pack from close-fitting underwear again, inside had some incense ash. Sprinkled into wine, stirred with chopstick, pushed wine bowl to front of Jin Zhu.

"What is this again?" Jin Zhu asked surprisedly.

Lian Niang was somewhat coy: "Bestowed by Fairy Huang, for begging son. My dose, just drank already." Lian Niang face color peach red; sentence behind almost fine not audible.

Jin Zhu just returned home not long time heard Fairy Huang many times. Originally also had some disgust towards that Fairy Huang. But hearing it was for begging son, dared not slight either. He and Lian Niang married many years, always without son. Mother was also chanting. Adding continuation of incense fire for Li family was a big matter. He held up bowl, examined a while again, raising head drinking down yellow wine.

Next morning early, Jin Zhu went to return debt of Li Youtian family first, then visited several old customers, seeing when they prepared to hire people, how price was. While returning from west of manor, looking at threshing ground, heard someone shouting under banyan tree: "Big sword waving, earth collapses mountain falls; big sword waving, Kun head moves home. Pick up hay cutter blade, good to chop Kun thief. Practice divine skill method well, Kun thief turns into mud beach." Looking carefully, saw a few men wrapped in yellow kerchiefs tied with black belts leading Master Li Patriarch's family soldiers and some idle men in village practicing sword. Couldn't help walking over to watch. Saw one wrapped in yellow kerchief patrolling back and forth; other two posing a move, shouting a sentence. Family soldiers learned move while *hei hei ha ha* responding a sentence. Extremely noisy.
