# Chapter 2444: The Teahouse Auction (Part 3)

Wu Nanhai secretly nodded: these old moneybags were truly shrewd. Matches, this cheap daily necessity, seemed to have thin margins and earn mere pennies, but the market potential was infinitely vast. Moreover, match production difficulty was the lowest—though Wu Nanhai didn't know if they realized this point.

Match production's key raw materials were chemicals and rod-cutting machines that only Senate enterprises could produce. From an unfavorable perspective, their so-called match factories were essentially just assembly plants. But looking at it from another angle: match factories only needed to run machines to produce match sticks, dip them in chemicals, and they were done. Requirements for workers, equipment, technology, and factories were all reduced to the minimum level. Production startup was extremely quick. As soon as equipment and materials were in place, mass production could begin immediately.

Indeed, Match Factory Project 1 immediately fell into intense bidding from the start, with the price quickly soaring from five thousand to eight thousand five hundred dollars.

Wu Yijun watched coldly from the sidelines. The most eager for this project were all "second-tier wealthy families"—not considered top merchants in Guangzhou in the past. This time they were probably hoping to ride the Australians' tailwind to soar.

Several people he was interested in, such as Liang Chenlong and Huo Maixiong, hadn't raised their bidding paddles. Liang Chenlong's expression was grave, while Old Huo watched the auction with a relaxed face, as if it had nothing to do with him.

*It seemed this wasn't the project they wanted.* Huo Maixiong probably wanted the paper factory. Liang Chenlong was harder to say...

Amid his thoughts, Item 1 finally sold at nine thousand seven hundred dollars. A buzz of discussion rose in the venue. Those who hadn't won were rolling up their sleeves, preparing to push for Items 2 and 3 in one push.

Indeed, the competition for Match Factory Items 2 and 3 grew even more intense. Finally, Item 2 sold for eleven thousand two hundred dollars, while Item 3 went all the way to thirteen thousand. Ultimately, all three items were successfully sold. However, as Wu Yijun had observed, none of these went to "first-tier wealthy families." Including Gao Ju, who had also registered to participate in this bidding session—he had shown no bidding movement.

Could they also have their eyes on the textile factory? This made Wu Yijun somewhat nervous. The textile factory had the highest reserve price among all projects, with the project fee alone reaching twenty-five thousand.

If no one competed with him and he could take it directly at reserve price, that would be best. But he had also prepared: planning to go as high as thirty-five thousand for this project. Higher than that was beyond his means—after all, there would be substantial expenses for operations afterward.

Next came another hot project: the soda and cold drinks factory.

Project reserve price was ten thousand dollars. As soon as He Fanghui opened bidding, within minutes it had risen to thirteen thousand. Soda and cold drinks had previously been a luxury only enjoyed at Ziming Tower. Whether it was "kvass" with its distinctive aroma or the colorful, sweet-and-sour marble sodas in glass bottles, they were all shipped from Lingao over vast distances. Only the relatively cheap fruit shaved ice and various flavored popsicles were locally produced in Guangzhou.

Though kvass and marble soda were expensive in Guangzhou, merchants with some understanding of Lingao knew that Guangzhou soda's high price stemmed from distance. Produced in Guangzhou, their prices would be as cheap as in Lingao.

In this sweltering Guangzhou, being able to have a bottle of cool, sweet, refreshing, thirst-quenching soda in summer was an immense pleasure. As long as the price was right, sales would be guaranteed. Besides, this soda and cold drinks factory came with "ice-making" equipment. Even if soda and cold drinks earned not a cent, just selling ice blocks every summer was big business. In the past, Zicheng Company would import ice blocks from Lingao for sale every summer—wasn't that just turning water into money?!

The "first-tier wealthy families" began joining the fray. Their entry immediately escalated the battle. Within minutes, they'd reached twenty thousand dollars. It finally sold for twenty-six thousand to a silk merchant.

Wu Yijun secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He had originally been most worried this person would compete with him for the cotton mill project. Now that he had won the soda and cold drinks factory, he probably wouldn't contend with him over cotton textiles.

The next project fell flat: paper factory. Papermaking was a bitter, exhausting trade. Soaking raw materials in winter was bone-chillingly cold; in summer, unbearably stinky. Yet this factory's reserve price wasn't even low—actually eight thousand dollars. Once bidding opened, indeed only Huo Maixiong bid. He Fanghui asked three times with no further bids, and the paper factory project went to Huo Maixiong.

*This Old Huo really is sentimental about his old trade.* Wu Yijun thought.

In the subsequent bidding, the one Wu Yijun had most worried would compete with him, Gao Ju, won the "Building Materials Factory." This bid was as high as forty-five thousand dollars, yet it produced only coarse, heavy construction materials: bricks, lime, mortar, and such. Originally no one was optimistic about it, and Gao Ju took it at reserve price. Wu Yijun felt this was somewhat a gesture to prop up the Australians' face.

The Shen father and son won the enamelware factory project at twenty-two thousand dollars. Wu Yijun also successfully won the cotton textile factory project at reserve price. As for Liang Chenlong, he won a project no one had expected: clothing factory.

In this era, apart from Australians and their naturalized citizen subordinates, very few people wore ready-made clothes. So the wealthy families were skeptical about how much business a clothing factory that could only do Australian business would have. Moreover, this clothing factory's reserve price was bizarrely high at fifteen thousand. Liang Chenlong similarly took it at reserve price.

*Seemed he would be dealing with the Liang family often in the future.* Wu Yijun thought. He was ushered by a tea attendant to a side table. Here were clerks handling procedures on the spot. He took out his Delong checkbook and wrote a check for twenty thousand dollars on the spot. As he wrote "Twenty Thousand Dollars" in capital characters on the check, his brush trembled slightly. This was the largest single expenditure he had ever handled in his life. It carried not only his entire fortune and livelihood but also his credit.

Ultimately, apart from two unsold items, twenty projects were successfully auctioned. Wu Nanhai had originally been somewhat nervous—he had strongly promoted this matter. If the final result was disappointing, wouldn't that be a great loss of face? Though the result couldn't be called a great success, it could be considered "successfully completed." He had already reviewed the total transfer income: a total of three hundred fifty-seven thousand four hundred dollars. Though this money wasn't "pure profit," investing this money into related equipment manufacturing would generate cascading benefits. As for investment after projects landed, that would snowball into generating more benefits.

*As long as silver circulates, one silver dollar can become ten.* Producing more products, more taxes, and more employment. Thinking of this, Wu Nanhai's mood was excited and happy. He immediately had the exclusively Senator-reserved "Apple Sparkling Wine" brought out. He raised high the tall glass filled with sparkling wine.

"Gentlemen, a toast to our future industrial endeavors!"

Everyone roared in response: "Cheers!"

After the celebratory drink, Wu Nanhai and He Fanghui withdrew, leaving the wealthy families to "enjoy themselves." Gao Ju, wanting to build rapport, had the tea attendant serve everyone a dim sum set.

"Now we're all enterprises under the Senate's banner. Everyone should support each other." Gao Ju raised his teacup. "I'll use tea as a substitute for wine—wishing everyone abundant wealth!"

Those who'd won projects now had considerably more relaxed expressions, chatting and laughing over tea. The earlier tense atmosphere in the teahouse was swept away. The air that had previously held some suspicion now seemed to become warmer too—they were now all "in the same boat."

The few who hadn't won any projects were hovering eagerly around Gao Ju, asking when new projects would be available. Gao Ju said: "Weren't there still two projects just now? You lot didn't find them good enough. For more opportunities, you'll have to wait at least one or two years."

"Those two projects were just too expensive—who knows if they'd even make money." There followed more griping and "unavoidable" excuses. Wu Yijun watched these performances, feeling quite pleased. *When it comes down to it, aren't you just being overly cautious and afraid to spend money?! In the end, making money requires boldness and seizing opportunities. No room for hesitation.*

Carrying the good feeling of being "wise and decisive," Wu Yijun returned home and immediately summoned his trusted servant:

"Go to the Dong household and tell them the matter is done. Ask if he has time to come discuss in the next few days."

After dispatching the servant to deliver the message, he summoned the steward and instructed:

"These next few days, if anyone from the Federation or Australians comes to deliver a letter, no matter what time or where I am, report to me immediately!"

According to what Gao Ju had said at the auction, naturalized citizen cadres or even Senators would soon come to discuss specific implementation steps. Wu Yijun had heard that Australians were known for decisive and swift action. Once implementation began, they would immediately enter into concrete matters like buying land and building structures. From then on, money would surely flow like water.

The Dong family had given him thirty thousand dollars. Though Old Madam Dong had clearly told him this money was his to use at full discretion and they wouldn't participate in operations, Wu Yijun felt that to be prudent, major matters should still be communicated to Dong Jizhong.

He was pacing in his study, thinking about the cotton textile factory's operational matters, when Chen Yin suddenly came in.

"Master!" he reported. "Master Ding has been found!"

"Oh?" Wu Yijun's spirits rose. *Truly heaven is helping me!* He immediately asked, "Where is he?"

"Master Ding is currently ill, lodging at a temple. The situation is not good..."

"What happened?" Wu Yijun frowned. "Have you called a doctor for him?"

"Master," Chen Yin stepped forward and lowered his voice, "Master Ding seems to have been attacked by someone. I didn't dare make trouble. I hurried back to report to you."

"Tell me exactly what happened!" Wu Yijun knew there was surely something suspicious here—Chen Yin wouldn't have come back to report if he could have handled it himself.
