# Chapter 2444: The Teahouse Auction (Part 3)

Wu Nanhai secretly nodded: these old moneybags were truly shrewd. Matches—this cheap daily necessity—seemed to have thin margins and earn mere pennies, but the market potential was virtually limitless. Moreover, match production difficulty was the lowest of all the projects, though Wu Nanhai didn't know if they realized this.

The key raw materials for match production were chemicals and rod-cutting machines that only Senate enterprises could produce. From an unfavorable perspective, their so-called match factories were essentially just assembly plants. But viewed from another angle: match factories only needed to run machines to produce match sticks, dip them in chemicals, and the job was done. Requirements for workers, equipment, technology, and facilities were all reduced to minimum levels. Production startup was extremely quick—as soon as equipment and materials were in place, mass production could begin immediately.

Indeed, Match Factory Project One immediately fell into intense bidding, with the price quickly soaring from five thousand to eight thousand five hundred dollars.

Wu Yijun watched coldly from the sidelines. The most eager bidders for this project were all "second-tier wealthy families"—not considered top merchants in Guangzhou's past. They were probably hoping to ride the Australians' tailwind to soar.

Several people he was interested in, such as Liang Chenlong and Huo Maixiong, hadn't raised their bidding paddles. Liang Chenlong's expression was grave, while Old Huo watched the auction with a relaxed face, as if it had nothing to do with him.

*It seemed this wasn't the project they wanted.* Huo Maixiong probably wanted the paper factory. Liang Chenlong was harder to read...

Amid his thoughts, Item One finally sold at nine thousand seven hundred dollars. A buzz of discussion rose in the venue. Those who hadn't won were rolling up their sleeves, preparing to push for Items Two and Three.

Indeed, the competition for Match Factory Items Two and Three grew even more intense. Item Two sold for eleven thousand two hundred dollars, while Item Three went all the way to thirteen thousand. All three items were successfully sold. However, as Wu Yijun had observed, none of these went to "first-tier wealthy families." Including Gao Ju, who had also registered to participate—he had made no bidding movement whatsoever.

Could they also have their eyes on the textile factory? This made Wu Yijun somewhat nervous. The textile factory had the highest reserve price among all projects, with the project fee alone reaching twenty-five thousand.

If no one competed with him and he could take it at reserve price, that would be ideal. But he had also prepared: he was willing to go as high as thirty-five thousand for this project. Higher than that was beyond his means—after all, substantial expenses for operations would follow.

Next came another hot project: the soda and cold drinks factory.

The reserve price was ten thousand dollars. As soon as He Fanghui opened bidding, it rose to thirteen thousand within minutes. Soda and cold drinks had previously been luxuries enjoyed only at Ziming Tower. Whether it was kvass with its distinctive aroma or the colorful, sweet-and-sour marble sodas in glass bottles, they were all shipped from Lingao across vast distances. Only the relatively cheap fruit shaved ice and various flavored popsicles were produced locally in Guangzhou.

Though kvass and marble soda were expensive in Guangzhou, merchants with some knowledge of Lingao understood that the high price stemmed from distance. Produced locally, they would be as cheap as in Lingao.

In sweltering Guangzhou, being able to enjoy a bottle of cool, sweet, refreshing, thirst-quenching soda in summer was an immense pleasure. As long as the price was right, sales would be guaranteed. Besides, this soda and cold drinks factory came with ice-making equipment. Even if soda and cold drinks earned not a single cent, selling ice blocks every summer was big business in itself. In the past, Zicheng Company had imported ice blocks from Lingao for sale each summer—wasn't that simply turning water into money?

The first-tier wealthy families began joining the fray. Their entry immediately escalated the battle; within minutes they had reached twenty thousand dollars. It finally sold for twenty-six thousand to a silk merchant.

Wu Yijun secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He had been most worried this person would compete with him for the cotton mill project. Now that he'd won the soda and cold drinks factory, he probably wouldn't contend over cotton textiles.

The next project fell flat: the paper factory. Papermaking was a bitter, exhausting trade. Soaking raw materials in winter was bone-chillingly cold; in summer, unbearably stinking. Yet this factory's reserve price wasn't even low—actually eight thousand dollars. Once bidding opened, only Huo Maixiong bid. He Fanghui asked three times with no further bids, and the paper factory project went to Huo Maixiong.

*This Old Huo really is sentimental about his old trade,* Wu Yijun thought.

In subsequent bidding, the one Wu Yijun had most worried would compete with him—Gao Ju—won the "Building Materials Factory." This bid was as high as forty-five thousand dollars, yet it produced only coarse, heavy construction materials: bricks, lime, mortar, and such. Originally no one had been optimistic about it, and Gao Ju took it at reserve price. Wu Yijun felt this was somewhat a gesture to prop up the Australians' face.

The Shen father and son won the enamelware factory project at twenty-two thousand dollars. Wu Yijun also successfully won the cotton textile factory project at reserve price. As for Liang Chenlong, he won a project no one had expected: the clothing factory.

In this era, apart from Australians and their naturalized citizen subordinates, very few people wore ready-made clothes. So the wealthy families were skeptical about how much business a clothing factory that could only serve the Australian market would generate. Moreover, this clothing factory's reserve price was bizarrely high at fifteen thousand. Liang Chenlong similarly took it at reserve price.

*It seemed he would be dealing with the Liang family often in the future,* Wu Yijun thought. He was ushered by a tea attendant to a side table where clerks were handling procedures on the spot. He took out his Delong checkbook and wrote a check for twenty thousand dollars. As he inscribed "Twenty Thousand Dollars" in capital characters, his brush trembled slightly. This was the largest single expenditure he had ever handled in his life. It carried not only his entire fortune and livelihood but also his credit.

Ultimately, apart from two unsold items, twenty projects were successfully auctioned. Wu Nanhai had originally been somewhat nervous—he had strongly promoted this matter. If the final result proved disappointing, wouldn't that be a great loss of face? Though the result couldn't be called a resounding success, it could be considered "successfully completed." He had already reviewed the total transfer income: three hundred fifty-seven thousand four hundred dollars. Though this money wasn't pure profit, investing it into related equipment manufacturing would generate cascading benefits. As for investment after projects landed, that would snowball into even greater returns.

*As long as silver circulates, one silver dollar can become ten.* More products, more taxes, more employment. Thinking of this, Wu Nanhai's mood was exhilarated. He immediately had the Senator-exclusive "Apple Sparkling Wine" brought out. He raised high the tall glass filled with sparkling wine.

"Gentlemen, a toast to our future industrial endeavors!"

Everyone roared in response: "Cheers!"

After the celebratory drink, Wu Nanhai and He Fanghui withdrew, leaving the wealthy families to enjoy themselves. Gao Ju, wanting to build rapport, had the tea attendants serve everyone a dim sum set.

"Now we're all enterprises under the Senate's banner. Everyone should support each other." Gao Ju raised his teacup. "I'll use tea as a substitute for wine—wishing everyone abundant wealth!"

Those who'd won projects now wore considerably more relaxed expressions, chatting and laughing over tea. The earlier tense atmosphere in the teahouse had dissipated. The air that had previously held suspicion now seemed to have warmed—they were now all in the same boat.

The few who hadn't won any projects hovered eagerly around Gao Ju, asking when new projects would be available. Gao Ju said: "Weren't there still two projects just now? You lot didn't find them good enough. For more opportunities, you'll have to wait at least a year or two."

"Those two projects were just too expensive—who knows if they'd even make money." There followed more griping and unavoidable excuses. Wu Yijun watched these performances with quiet satisfaction. *When it comes down to it, aren't you just being overly cautious and afraid to spend money? In the end, making money requires boldness and seizing opportunities. No room for hesitation.*

Carrying the good feeling of being wise and decisive, Wu Yijun returned home and immediately summoned his trusted servant:

"Go to the Dong household and tell them the matter is done. Ask if he has time to come discuss in the next few days."

After dispatching the servant to deliver the message, he summoned the steward and instructed:

"These next few days, if anyone from the Federation or the Australians comes to deliver a letter, no matter what time or where I am, report to me immediately!"

According to what Gao Ju had said at the auction, naturalized citizen cadres or even Senators would soon come to discuss specific implementation steps. Wu Yijun had heard that Australians were known for decisive and swift action. Once implementation began, they would immediately enter into concrete matters like buying land and constructing buildings. From then on, money would surely flow like water.

The Dong family had given him thirty thousand dollars. Though Old Madam Dong had clearly told him this money was his to use at full discretion and they wouldn't participate in operations, Wu Yijun felt that to be prudent, major matters should still be communicated to Dong Jizhong.

He was pacing in his study, contemplating the cotton textile factory's operational matters, when Chen Yin suddenly entered.

"Master!" he reported. "Master Ding has been found!"

"Oh?" Wu Yijun's spirits rose. *Truly heaven is helping me!* He immediately asked, "Where is he?"

"Master Ding is currently ill, lodging at a temple. The situation is not good..."

"What happened?" Wu Yijun frowned. "Have you called a doctor for him?"

"Master," Chen Yin stepped forward and lowered his voice, "Master Ding seems to have been attacked by someone. I didn't dare cause a disturbance. I hurried back to report to you."

"Tell me exactly what happened!" Wu Yijun knew there was surely something suspicious here—Chen Yin wouldn't have returned to report if he could have handled it himself.
