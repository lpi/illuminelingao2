# Chapter 2599: Investigation (26)

Quan Youde catered to his preferences. Shortly after they became sworn brothers, he procured a gentle and pleasant young woman for him, who was said to possess an "appearance suitable for bearing sons."

Under the influence of wine and lust, Lu Renjia quickly succumbed. Not long after, the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a boy.

The birth of his son seemed to give Lu Renjia the courage to resolve to "do big things." What was originally secretive and small-scale now became brazen. Lu Renjia began cooperating with Quan Youde with an almost insane vigor, stealing large quantities of publicly funded drugs.

The steady stream of stolen publicly funded drugs turned into shining silver dollars. In just one year, the net income Quan Youde distributed to him exceeded twenty thousand yuan. This was money he wouldn't earn in a lifetime working for the Senate.

Such huge profits made Lu Renjia even more energetic; he wanted to earn enough money for his son to spend for a lifetime.

Lu Renjia steadfastly refused to reveal the whereabouts of these illegal gains and his mistress and son. However, after several days and nights of interrogation, he finally confessed. The woman and child were in Macau. As for the nearly thirty thousand yuan in illicit money, he had the woman buy bonds and stocks of the Nanyang Company in his son's name.

Wu Mu found this confession somewhat tragically amusing. It seemed the Senate's naturalized cadres were keeping up with the times, no longer burying embezzled money underground or bricking it up in double walls.

"Should we bring his woman and child back to Guangzhou?" Zheng Mingjiang asked.

"Not for now. First, they aren't criminals, at most involved persons. Second, Lu Renjia is very smart; he probably has a backup plan. He knows our policies very well and knows we won't make things difficult for women and young children. So he might have other arrangements for them. These thirty thousand in bonds and stocks are in the open; there are probably hidden assets too. He intends to let them access it after the storm blows over. So we don't need to rush to deal with them; let's wait for this hidden line to surface."

"You really think so?!" Zheng Mingjiang was surprised. "Would he think in such detail?"

"Hehe, you don't understand the psychology of these people." Wu Mu waved his hand. "No matter which timeline, corrupt elements are people with a strong sense of crisis. Why do they accumulate wealth so frantically? They clearly know that once things are exposed, they will face imprisonment or even death, yet isn't what they seek 'sacrifice one person for the happiness of the whole family'? Some even want to 'benefit descendants.' So he will do everything possible to hide this money obtained through untold hardships, leaving it for his family and descendants."

Zheng Mingjiang was speechless. After a moment, she murmured, "I feel a bit pity for them now..."

"Are the ones truly to be pitied not Lu Renjia's wife and daughters?" Wu Mu sneered. "Lu Renjia arranged nothing for them."

Instantly, Lu Renjia turned back into a heinous "scum" in Zheng Mingjiang's eyes. She responded with considerable disgust, "Right! We absolutely cannot let this mistress and illegitimate child have an easy life!"

"They won't have it easy. But we aren't having it much better right now," Wu Mu said. "Lu Cheng sent a telegram. Yesterday they raided the Jubao Hall—as expected, they found nothing. They only caught a few unimportant shop assistants; account books and registers were not found. Even the one sent undercover..."

"Yuan Shuzhi."

"Yes, Yuan Shuzhi is missing too. It's very likely he was taken away by them..."

Zheng Mingjiang suddenly became tense. "Could he have been silenced because his identity was exposed?"

Yuan Shuzhi participated in this operation on her recommendation and assignment. If he died in the line of duty because of this, her conscience would be truly uneasy.

"It's possible, but if they really wanted to silence him, they didn't need to take him out to do it. They could have just killed him directly at the Jubao Hall. Why go to the trouble? Anyway, Quan Youde can't appear in the medicine market again." Wu Mu said, "I tend to think that because he mastered some important secrets, Quan Youde took him along. He should be with Quan Youde's gang now, hiding somewhere. I've already notified the police department and issued arrest warrants for Quan Youde and others, including Yuan Shuzhi on the list."

"Where would they hide?"

According to Lu Cheng's inference, Quan Youde was likely hiding at the farm estate. Although the investigation team found the approximate location of the estate by checking the transaction deeds archived in the county yamen, because it was located deep in remote mountains, no one locally knew the approximate path upon inquiry.

"It's useless for us to be anxious about this matter; we can only wait for news from Lu Cheng and the others," Wu Mu said. "Quan Youde's gang can't run far; it's extremely likely they are still within Boluo County. He wouldn't dare run casually into the deep mountains either; there are still quite a few Yao mountain strongholds in the Boluo mountains that haven't been naturalized."

While they were talking, the communicator brought another telegram sent by the Boluo investigation team.

"There's a new lead in the androgen case." Wu Mu glanced at it and handed the telegram to Zheng Mingjiang. "They didn't catch the Southeast Asian man, but they caught the midwife."

Zheng Mingjiang hurriedly took the telegram. The text was very long. After raiding the Jubao Hall and Quan Youde's two residences in Boluo, the investigation team commanded the Boluo police and the National Army to conduct a comprehensive "security check" of the medicine market.

During this security check, they unexpectedly captured the fleeing midwife who sold "gender-changing medicine." According to her confession, she came to Boluo to restock. After buying goods from the Southeast Asian man, she received news that something happened with the gender-changing medicine and the police were catching her, so she stayed in the medicine market to hide.

The investigation team carefully searched the midwife's residence. But the harvest wasn't much. They didn't find the packaging similar to the testosterone gel used in clinical trials or retail that Hao Long had specifically instructed to look for in his letter, including outer packaging boxes, glass jars containing gel, and copper dosing pump heads for squeezing out gel. They only found strong white spirits, various jars and pots, and some Chinese medicinal materials. This meant that the "Sorceress" had performed secondary blending of the "aphrodisiac wine" here, but this wasn't the primary processing site.

The midwife also confessed that the Southeast Asian man didn't say this stuff could "change the gender of a fetus," only that it could "strengthen *yang*." She later heard that this Southeast Asian man was a eunuch yet could surprisingly visit prostitutes. So she had a different idea. She thought that since this medicine could make a eunuch "regain *yang*," if used on a pregnant woman, wouldn't it turn a female fetus into a male one?

As a midwife, she knew the huge market demand for this all too well. She immediately bought two bottles of medicinal wine from this Southeast Asian man. Because the medicinal wine was very expensive, she bought white spirits herself to dilute and re-blend it.

They didn't get any important clues from the midwife's mouth, only knowing that this Southeast Asian man spoke broken Hokkien and could also speak a few sentences of "New Speech."

"No new breakthroughs," Zheng Mingjiang put down the telegram, saying somewhat disappointedly.

With Lu Renjia brought to justice, the drug loss case was basically cleared up. But Zheng Mingjiang was still uneasy about the "gender-changing medicine" and "aphrodisiac" case.

Although in terms of case value, the loss of androgen could only be considered a minor case in this series of drug cases, there were many inexplicable aspects to it.

Where did this Southeast Asian man come from? Where did he get the androgen? Why did he know how to use this drug correctly...

Various unsolved mysteries made Zheng Mingjiang determined to uncover the truth of the matter.

Returning to her office, she continued to think about the direction of the investigation. Since it was confirmed that the sales of the gender-changing medicine began as early as half a year ago, that effectively excluded most suspects who might have been involved in drug leakage. Only three main targets remained:

1.  Inside the Pharmaceutical Factory. Looking at it currently, this possiblity was the smallest. All drug loss cases seized so far had nothing to do with the Pharmaceutical Factory. This one could be basically ruled out.
2.  Inside the Bairen General Hospital. Indeed, apart from the Pharmaceutical Factory, testosterone gel was only available in the pharmacy of the Bairen General Hospital. But if it leaked from the Bairen General Hospital, other drugs leaking from there would likely be more numerous. How could it be discovered only now?
3.  Test subjects in clinical trials. This was Zheng Mingjiang's current key suspect target. But she had asked Hao Long, who said that the drug clinical trials had long ended, and many test subjects had lost contact. Some who were easy to find had been checked by Political Security without showing abnormalities, while most of the rest either found the drug too expensive or too troublesome to use, or were even unwilling to continue paying for drugs at the Bairen General Hospital. How to investigate this further?

Hao Long now promised to provide a complete list of test subjects, but after sorting it out, it had to be handed over to the Political Security system for investigation, which wouldn't yield results for two or three months.

Then, the only way was still to investigate within the Bairen General Hospital. After all, the clinical trials and drug distribution were conducted there.

Currently, their main methods for auditing medical records and pharmacy accounts, besides cleaning up "external hospital prescriptions," were to check whether the quantity of drugs prescribed in medical records within a period of time matched the actual quantity of drugs leaving the pharmacy, and then checking the medical records themselves for suspicious points, such as prescribing far more drugs than normal usage at one time. There was also looking for any patients who regularly registered to see the same disease repeatedly, using this to collude internally and externally to steal drugs.

However, such investigation ideas couldn't be used to investigate the Bairen General Hospital and the test subjects at all: experimental drugs were distributed to test subjects at fixed times and quantities; there was no issue of patients registering on their own.

Zheng Mingjiang mulled over this problem repeatedly, troubleshooting all known cheating methods, but still couldn't reach any specific conclusion.

That night, she had a dream where she returned to the time she submitted a paper to a journal for the first time as a student, reliving the oppressive feeling of being urged by both reviewers and her supervisor, and woke up with a start. After clearing her head a bit, she remembered that she had left the research environment of the old timeline for ten years. Now, while she had become an "academic authority," she still adhered to her principle of treating students and subordinates in a friendly manner.
