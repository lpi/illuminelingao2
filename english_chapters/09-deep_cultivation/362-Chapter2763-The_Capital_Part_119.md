# Chapter 2763: The Capital (Part 119)

Xu Ke did not recall this person; evidently, he was not on the Political Security Bureau's surveillance list. He pressed on, "Does he have an alias?"

"Perhaps this *is* his alias."

"You have roped in many religious sects and secret societies in Guangzhou Prefecture. What use is it for you to reel these people in? As far as I know, most of these disciples and followers are ignorant commoners who only know how to burn incense and worship gods, fooled by others. Apart from the few dozen people around the sect heads, most have no combat power. If it really comes to a fight, the situation will be them scattering in an uproar. Could it be just to boost the momentum?"

Liu Sha smiled, "Even a blade of grass or a piece of wood has its use, let alone people. If you say they harbor ulterior motives and have zero combat power, this Poor Daoist also acknowledges it. But if you say they are useless, then that is greatly erroneous. Let this Poor Daoist ask the Chief, how many sect members are there in the religious sects of Guangzhou Prefecture?"

"This, I indeed do not possess the numbers."

"No fewer than thirty or forty thousand people." Liu Sha was slightly self-satisfied. "If these thirty or forty thousand people swarm up, even if they are unarmed and stick out their necks for you to kill, how long will it take you to kill them?"

"So, these living beings are merely tributes used to delay the Senate's counterattack."

"Precisely." Liu Sha said, "Forgive my bluntness, but when it comes to the breath of mind for planning great matters, the Senate is inevitably a bit petty, far inferior to the heroic spirit of Master Liang reaching the clouds."

"He has heroic spirit reaching the clouds," Xu Ke laughed. "He indeed has the grandeur of 'I plan for the world, how can I spare the small commoners.' However, the Daoist Priest is also but a small commoner. In the eyes of Master Liang, you probably aren't much different from those sect disciples sent to fill the blade edge. Is it not absurd to clap your hands in praise for him?"

Liu Sha was stunned. He originally wanted to refute, but had no way to start. Come to think of it, wasn't he just a chess piece with Master Wang? Otherwise, why would he have had a change of heart?

Seeing the look of embarrassment on his face, Xu Ke stopped exposing his shortcomings. He said, "Since Master Liang has a martial staff, he must have a civilian staff. Do you know of them?"

Liu Sha gave a strange smile and said, "If I had a few more children, it would have been worth it. Nowadays..."

"Nowadays you feel it's a loss, don't you?" Xu Ke stood up and added hot water to his tea cup, smiling.

Liu Sha chuckled a few times, which counted as tacit acceptance. He said:

"Actually, I don't know much about this civilian staff. Liang Cunhou's mind is meticulous, not inferior to Master Wang," Liu Sha said. "It is said that quite a few local noble families and gentry in Guangdong are involved."

"This, we have more or less estimated." Xu Ke nodded. "They are unwilling to lose their paradise. However, these people cannot be counted as a civilian staff."

"You are right. Actually, his civilian staff, although I don't know specifically who they are, I roughly know they are people originally from the Yuyuan Society."

The name of the Yuyuan Society appeared many times in Liang's case file. Some of its members had already been arrested or turned. Therefore, they had grasped seventy or eighty percent of the member list. However, these people had low status within the society and knew limited information. This society itself was formed by a group of scholars in Guangdong who had a strong interest in "Australian Studies," with varying motives. Some were purely curious, some were there to learn Australian Studies, and some were just using it as a channel to climb up socially because Liang Cunhou was interested in Australian Studies... Because their goals were all different, the situation they knew within the society was also different.

Members who joined purely out of hobbies or seeking a career path were naturally peripheral personnel of the society. Even if some researched Australian Studies very deeply, Liang Cunhou only "sat and discussed the Dao" with them and did not entrust them with any secret matters.

"...This Poor Daoist also doesn't know much of the situation. I only know that he collected many of your books, newspapers, and periodicals, hiding them in his residence. He allowed the scholars within the society to study and extract from them. He himself and trusted members secretly compiled a book based on the collected books and newspapers, called *Record of Broad Hearing of Heavenly Matters* (*Tianqing Guangwenlu*)."

They had heard more or less about Liang Cunhou secretly compiling a book.

"Where is this book hidden?"

"Probably hidden in his mansion." Liu Sha said, "He spent enormous effort on this book; naturally, he treasures it, planning to present it to the Imperial Court in the future."

"Let's not talk about the book for now. Who were his most trusted people originally in the Yuyuan Society?"

"One was Lin Zunxiu. However, he is now long a dead tiger, lingering on in his last breath in Guangzhou City. Even Master Liang probably wouldn't have any connections with him anymore. But if we talk about the deepest origins, it would be none other than him."

"Who else?"

"There are three or four others, but I have only seen them and do not know their names. Looking at their appearance, they are not from wealthy families; probably all from poor scholar backgrounds. However, there is one person you probably know. I heard Young Master Liang say that he came from Lingao."

" surnamed Huang?!"

"Precisely!" Liu Sha laughed, "You guys indeed know!"

"Where is this person now?"

"I don't know." Liu Sha shook his head, "Before the Witchcraft Case, he stopped showing his face. Either he went to another place, or he was hidden away by Young Master Liang."

The Political Security Bureau knew about Huang Binkun seeking refuge with Liang Cunhou in Guangzhou, but his figure was absent from the various cases investigated. Later on, even his whereabouts were completely lost.

"Young Master Liang values him very highly, doesn't he?"

"Yes, after all, he came over from Lingao; what he saw and heard heavily relies on personal experience. This person is daring and resolute, and has a stubborn nature. Young Master Liang values him very highly."

This sentence confirmed that Huang was an important figure in Liang's pocket. As for his whereabouts, Xu Ke estimated that nine out of ten he had already left Guangzhou.

Regrettably, even Liu Sha did not know this person's whereabouts. He would likely be a scourge in the future.

His next question was what the people from the Senate's Finance and Economics sector wanted to know the most: "Where did the counterfeit currency you used for activities in Guangdong come from? Was it Young Master Liang's idea or Master Wang's?"

"This takes a long time to explain." Liu Sha said, "Initially, this was the idea Mr. Le gave to Master Wang. He said that since you don't cast coins and exclusively print paper notes, they could be forged. This could both fraudulently obtain materials and make a profit."

"And later?"

"Counterfeit banknotes are not easy to make." Liu Sha said, "This matter was personally presided over by Mr. Le, but it failed several times. Master Wang relied on connections and hired many capable people, spending quite a bit of silver, but the things made were... hard to describe! They could only deceive people in the countryside; they couldn't be spent in the city. The country folk aren't stupid either; regardless of whether it's real or fake, they simply don't acknowledge banknotes."

Xu Ke knew that before using the abolished grain circulation coupons for forgery, all paper counterfeit currency on the market was fake at a glance.

"Mr. Le lost face and came to ask this Poor Daoist for a plan." Liu Sha became quite self-satisfied as he spoke of this. "This Poor Daoist then came up with the idea of making fake silver coins."

"You, sir, are truly a great talent!" Xu Ke said, half-mocking and half-admiring.

"You flatter me, you flatter me," Liu Sha couldn't hide his smugness. "This Mr. Le, his learning is naturally good, but when it comes to such ways of the *jianghu*, he is really too tender."

"Then in your opinion?"

"Paper currency looks cheap, but in reality, Australian paper currency contains secret methods. It is extremely difficult to imitate. On the contrary, silver dollars are easier to target."

"So the fake silver dollars were your idea." Xu Ke said, "The Zhuti Silver must be your handiwork, right?"

"The Zhuti Silver was refined by Daoist Wu. Alchemy is his specialty."

"You have certainly gotten to know quite a few weird and bizarre figures of the *jianghu*. What is this person's background exactly?"

"He was originally a shaman in the mountains of Guizhou. He was not a cultivator of the Dao. He learned many witchcraft and evil arts from the deep mountains of the southwest. Later, by chance, he bowed to a Daoist as his master and learned the arts of talismans and elixirs, mixing them into a set of his own gadgets. Not only is he proficient in various magic arts, but he is also good at the cursing arts of the Western Fan monks..."

"Stop, stop," Xu Ke frowned and said, "He was originally a shaman, later joined the Daoist sect, so how did he end up practicing Esoteric Buddhism?"

"Hehe, there's something you don't know, Sir. What Wu Zhiqi practices is a mixture of Esoteric Buddhism and the Bon religion of the Western Fan, most mysterious of all. According to his words, its mana is immense; at the lower end it can curse and take people's lives, and at the higher end it can set up arrays to ruin a nation's fate. It is very effective..."

"You believe this?"

"This Poor Daoist is also half-doubting. However, I have seen him curse and kill people with my own eyes. Very formidable!"

Xu Ke subconsciously touched his chin, finding it inconceivable. But looking at Liu Sha's solemn vow, it didn't seem like he was lying. Thinking about the things Fu Wen did. It seemed Daoist Cui's speculation back then was very accurate. This fatty Cui really had a way with feudal superstition!

"How could such a powerful figure be used by you?" Xu Ke was very interested in this. "He himself is a master of casting spells; could he be bluffed by your soul-extraction magic trick?"

"How can this be called bluffing? If I didn't have real learning, could a master like him be manipulated and driven by this Poor Daoist?" Liu Sha said proudly.

"Who thought of this matter?"

"Of course it was Daoist Wu; I don't have this ability." Liu Sha hurriedly cleared himself from this matter. "It's just that he needed too many human lives, so I recommended Fu Wen to him. I didn't expect these two to act so recklessly!"

Xu Ke thought, *So you also know to clear your relationship with this matter!* He continued to ask:

"How did Mr. Le view this matter?"

"He was naturally opposed to it, saying that since ancient times, he had never heard of heresy and deviant paths achieving great things. Actually, Master Wang said the same."

"Then why did they do it anyway?"

"Even a rabbit will bite when anxious." Liu Sha sighed, "Wu Zhiqi swore solemnly, leaving us no choice but to believe, so we thought we might as well give it a try."

*Isn't this just a dog jumping over a wall in desperation!* Xu Ke criticized inwardly. For this "try," how many innocent commoners lost their lives! Not to mention Master Wang and the others, if this Zhou Lezhi is truly a transmigrator, just this crime alone would warrant him being cut into a thousand pieces.

He said calmly, "This 'try' cost quite a bit. Fu Wen later confessed that just the silver given to Gao Tianshi was ten thousand taels. This is not a small sum."

Liu Sha smiled without speaking. Xu Ke immediately understood: "These were all Zhuti Silver?"

"Correct, all refined by Old Daoist Wu." Liu Sha said, "This is a secret art he learned in the Miao frontier. Furthermore..."

"Furthermore, you also have the stamp of Sanjiang Mao."

"This thing was originally an old item from years ago, but with it, this Zhuti Silver became even easier to use."
