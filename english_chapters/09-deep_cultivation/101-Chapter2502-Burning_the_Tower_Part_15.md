# Chapter 2502: Burning the Tower (15)

Yun Ting nodded and said, "He looks like someone from the *jianghu*, but this person clearly doesn't harbor good intentions. By provoking this incident, he wants to cause friction among the brothers of the various families, so he can manipulate things from within, either to preserve his own power or for some other ulterior motive. We still need to observe further."

Wooden Stone Daoist said, "He can't stir up big waves. The general trend is already set, so we shouldn't act too hastily. If we push too hard and cause you all to defect to the Kun people, the loss will outweigh the gain. It's better to act steadily. Since he came to escape a feud, if he is killed by someone after returning, it will be natural to assume his enemies found him. That would be logical." After speaking, he gave a sinister smile.

Yun Ting pondered for a moment and said, "I can't see through this person. Letting him go back involves too many variables. We cannot leave this hidden worry."

Wooden Stone Daoist asked, "Then halfway on the return journey...?"

Yun Ting shook his head. "No. What about Li Baiqing then? Kill or release? It's hard to explain clearly, and secret grudges are hard to resolve. Besides, we will need to use them in the future, so we shouldn't offend them too ruthlessly. It's better to do it out in the open, where we can speak frankly." He sneered, "Doesn't he speak fullt of *jianghu* rules? We'll give him enough *jianghu* rules. Make him have nothing to say!"

After speaking, he waved his hand. A dark-skinned man in black clothes walked silently from the shadows to stand behind Yun Ting, bowing his head without saying a word.

Yun Ting whispered, "Arrange for two of our knife hands. Wait until Sun Gang is defeated, then let them pose as Sun Gang's disciples. Enter the arena and stab that Li Jian. Don't take his life, but make it difficult for him to speak or move. Make him unable to get out of bed for three months."

The man bowed and disappeared into the darkness again.

Wooden Stone Daoist glanced at Yun Ting, knowing in his heart that martial artists had a sense of proportion in fighting and killing. Injuring people without taking their lives was to silence him without forming a death feud with the Six Lower Villages Mutual Defense Association. Posing as Sun Gang's disciples could be explained as a moment of indignation, allowing for an excuse. The crime could also be slightly reduced. Afterwards, apologizing and paying money, admitting punishment and beating, giving the other party enough face, allowed for plenty of room to maneuver.

Wooden Stone Daoist turned his head and cast his gaze into the field, thinking to himself: *Letting them fight is also good. Having made enemies, Sun Gang, Pockmarked Chen, and the others will naturally want the General Assembly to back them up. From now on, they can only hug the General Assembly's thigh tighter. Indeed, it is better to have conflicting opinions stirring each other up; we cannot let the people below be of one mind.* Thinking of this, he cast his gaze back into the field.

Xu Tong walked calmly to the edge of the field. He was not afraid of revealing his skills. This style of fighting had never been revealed in the world. He mostly carried firearms on duty and occasionally made arrests using numerical superiority, rarely needing hand-to-hand combat. The few who had seen it had either gone to the Yellow Springs or were in the dark dungeons of the Political Security Bureau.

Xu Tong slowly took off his jacket and placed it aside. Excessive clothing would provide the opponent with handles and leverage points for grappling, choking, throwing, and seizing during bare-handed combat. Then he took out a headband and tied his hair tightly. Traditional hairstyles inevitably led to hair being grabbed, and Xu Tong wanted to minimize this impact as much as possible. Finally, he took out a roll of cloth strips and used a simple binding method to quickly and firmly wrap them around his wrist joints and hands to protect his knuckles and small finger joints.

Under the removed jacket was a physique of bronze-colored muscles. It was a strong body forged by relying on modern nutritional dietary formulas and the Action Team's scientific gym training curriculum. Clear muscle lines and thick muscle dimensions were uncommon in this world. A balanced fat ratio ensured endurance and intensity. A tough waist and abdomen were the source of power. Broad trapezius muscles and a thick neck provided solid anti-strike capability. The thick back and tendons on his chest muscles trembled slightly, as if ready to release terrible power at any time.

Thirty-year-old Xu Tong was already past the peak age for sports by modern standards, but sufficient nutrition and continuous uninterrupted training over the years allowed him to maintain a good state. Xu Tong was about 1.77 meters tall and weighed less than 78 kilograms. He was no longer young, so he did less heavy weightlifting training and relied mainly on bodyweight training methods such as knuckle push-ups. This method ensured that muscles and body weight would not increase excessively while maintaining agility and flexibility. Wearing a jacket, he would not appear too strong to attract attention.

Unregulated street fighting consumes a large amount of physical energy in a very short time. It requires both rapid and short explosive power as well as long-lasting endurance. At the same time, a portion of physical energy must be reserved to deal with other enemies or sudden situations. In recognized tests during usual training, Xu Tong could maintain four two-minute explosive periods if performing normally, which was enough to support a continuous high-intensity street fight.

Xu Tong would conduct no less than eighty minutes of training every day when conditions permitted, including at least forty-five minutes of ring sparring. After sparring with Chen Sigen of the Special Reconnaissance Team, Chen Sigen regretfully stated that Xu Tong possessed the potential of a professional athlete. Unfortunately, he was too old. If he were ten years younger, after professional training, he would be a terrifying killing machine in the ring. It was a pity that no matter how high his training level, there would be no professional leagues for him to participate in now. Given his position, overly high fighting skills had little useless place.

Xu Tong did several sets of warm-up movements, including torso twists, arm stretches, inner thigh stretches, and high thigh extensions. He inhaled gently, then walked slowly into the field. He cupped his hands to Sun Gang, then raised both hands to assume a boxing stance.

His left hand was in front, the top of the fist level with his eyebrow ridge. His shoulders were slightly shrugged to cover his chin. The top of his rear fist was level with the middle of his ear, slightly lower than the front hand, protecting his jaw and the inner ear balance canals. Both elbows hung down to protect his ribs. His upper body leaned forward slightly. His legs stood at a diagonal forty-five-degree angle, with a distance of about twenty centimeters between his feet. The soles of his feet pressed against the ground to bear force, while his heels touched the ground lightly and emptily, facilitating turning and movement.

Seeing this from the sidelines, Pockmarked Chen laughed loudly. "Look, look! That head-hugging and shrinking-brain appearance, doesn't it look like a turtle? Is it a turtle fist?" The surrounding crowd all laughed.

Sun Gang had long been waiting impatiently in the field. Seeing Xu Tong enter, he strode forward to meet him. Sun Gang had a large frame, possessing a height of 1.80 meters, which was extremely rare at the time. His weight was also greater than Xu Tong's. His protein intake was sufficient, but he had relatively more fat, fitting the traditional image of a big-waisted and round-shouldered strong man. He also cupped his fists slightly as a return gesture. Then he tucked in his clothes, tightened his belt, and assumed a starting stance. His hands were left front and right back, raised high to his chest, five fingers open emptily and not clenched. His front foot stepped out and his rear foot followed. The Wen Family Seventy-Two Rows of Fists emphasized the Five Elements and Twelve Turns, excelling in leg techniques. The main techniques included stomping, kicking, stroking, pushing, tripping, turning, butting, and striking. The form was a large frame, striving for rigidity. A boxing proverb says "Fists strike the unknown," attacking high to take low, feinting to strike cleverly. Traditional boxing also has the saying "No blocking or parrying, just one strike; if blocking and parrying occurs, there will be ten strikes," emphasizing striking vitals to defeat the enemy with one move.

Seeing both men had entered the field, Ge Yaoxian just shouted, "The martial arts competition begins." He guided with both hands and retreated out of the field.

Xu Tong's basic movements had been repeatedly corrected by Chen Sigen based on modern textbooks, standard as a textbook. If traditional martial arts were a heritage, then modern combat was more like a sports science. Mixed Marital Arts (MMA) is an inclusive and open combat system. Participants come from all five continents and four seas. They bring the combat skills of their own nations and countries into it, selecting the optimal solutions from them. MMA constantly absorbs new technologies and theories, continuously self-developing and improving, continuously evolving, and will never stop. Refined technologies and theories are repeatedly demonstrated and tested on punching, kicking, and throwing postures based on human physiological structure and movement laws. Large amounts of data and samples are collected for analysis to summarize the most standardized and effective force generation methods and striking techniques. Then they are promoted and exchanged through competitions and training. This leads to a large convergence of modern fighting competition techniques, reducing the diversity and ornamental value of martial arts brought by culture and tradition to a certain extent.

In modern society, even the techniques taught in the most ordinary boxing gyms are not much different from professional teams. The difference is mainly reflected in daily nutrition and diet control, training plans, physical standards, training intensity, targeted exercises, and a large number of high-level sparring partners and competitions. At the same time, the popularization of modern fighting protective gear and injury medical control also provides the possibility for trainees to accumulate a large amount of actual combat experience. In medieval times, a single actual combat might bring wounds that were difficult to heal, or even leave disabilities, so it was difficult to improve one's level through constant actual combat. In fighting, to ensure that basic movements such as footwork and force generation do not deform requires a large amount of actual combat honing. Even if the pads and sandbags are hit purely and the technical movements are standard, when stepping onto the ring to face a living opponent of comparable level, one will still be flustered, movements will deform, and tactics will fail. This is the so-called "train well, fight poorly." Only by fighting a lot can one generate fighting consciousness. Only with consciousness can the strength, speed, and technique in training be fully utilized. Modern fighting incorporates confrontation from the beginning of training and carries it through to the end. In the first week of training, Xu Tong couldn't even throw a standard jab at his opponent. To overcome all this, one can only gradually adapt to the atmosphere of actual combat through constant confrontation, learning how to maintain a calm mind and keen insight in intense exercise, and capturing fleeting opportunities for victory.

Sun Gang stepped out with his left foot, his right foot following, approaching Xu Tong bit by bit. Suddenly, he threw a right straight fist at Xu Tong's face. Xu Tong quickly ducked, dodged to the left side, and took a step back. Sun Gang immediately rushed forward, throwing continuous punches with both hands quickly. Xu Tong tried to cover his head with both hands, his arms constantly blocking. At the same time, his upper body swayed quickly left and right, and his feet retreated non-stop. This caused most of Sun Gang's strikes to miss, and those that hit were unable to apply force due to the blocking and quick dissipation of force. This gave Sun Gang a feeling of having strength but being unable to use it. Sun Gang was a little impatient. Most of the time, he only needed to rely on his height and strength advantage plus the skill bonus of years of martial arts practice to easily knock down his opponent. He had never encountered such a situation today.
