# Chapter 2487: Stripping the Cocoon (Part 2)

In Xu Tong's view, Vice Commander Yang's greatest strength was her extremely vigorous energy and meticulous style. However, precisely because of this, her working mode could be described as simple and crude, completely relying on mass-manpower intensive operations, failing to reflect the precision and rigor of reconnaissance work.

Section Chief Xu had elaborated in his graduation thesis that relying solely on systems like the "Ten-Person Group" and "Secret Reconnaissance Network" to conduct political security work incurred excessive administrative costs and was actually a huge burden on finances. For the Senate's current limited financial capacity and personnel training ability, it was a waste. If investigators could solve cases relying just on informants, technical appraisers, and tracking teams, what was the point of professional courses like "Investigative Science" and "Psychology" taught by the Senators?

As an investigation section chief from the first generation of professionally trained graduates stationed in Guangzhou, his first act was to veto the plan to establish extensive reconnaissance networks in the urban area of Guangzhou. instead, he proposed establishing close cooperation with the National Police's Section 9, focusing on using "informant" intelligence from within the police system. Through Section 9, an intelligence-sharing system was formed. In lower-level intelligence gathering systems, they didn't have as many resources as the police. Forcing the construction of a separate system was not worth the effort.

Wu Mu thought his plan was feasible. After all, the Senate currently had considerable suspicion towards the Political Security system, and increasing "transparency" through cooperation with the police system was indeed a reasonable approach. Meanwhile, Section 9, created by the National Police, was currently in an awkward situation of "ambiguous positioning." Strengthening cooperation would allow both sides to benefit. Therefore, this proposal was quickly confirmed through talks between Guo Yi and Ran Yao. In this way, the Guangzhou Political Security Branch could receive two weekly reports, "Weekly Case Situation" and "Weekly Social Situation," from the police system. When surveillance work needed strengthening or certain intelligence needed collecting, it could also be done through Section 9's channels.

According to the old rules of the Senate, various powerful agencies held a monthly "Internal Security Meeting" for intelligence exchange and resource sharing. With the continuous expansion of institutions, a weekly regular meeting could no longer meet the demand. Therefore, a coordinating permanent body called the "Internal Security Meeting Affairs Bureau" was specially established. It was responsible for daily assistance requests and intelligence sharing. This Affairs Bureau also established a corresponding branch in Guangzhou. Xu Tong served as the person in charge.

Xu Tong had some opinions about Yang Cao being "parachuted" into Guangzhou as the head of the "Special Task Force" to handle the Witchcraft Case. After all, this was his territory, and Yang Cao's sudden arrival was equivalent to temporarily adding a superior over him. Moreover, he also rather disapproved of her investigative methods.

Yang Cao said: "Don't look at the surface. The Liang family might use handling accounts as a pretext to simultaneously dispose of evidence of anti-Song activities—sacrificing the small to hide the big, cutting off the tail to survive. His meeting with Director Zheng and others might be a vain attempt to repair relationships; not touching on substantive issues might be hesitation before defecting, but it is more likely stalling for time or testing the government's attitude. I never harbor any illusions about such stone-headed stubborn gentry landlords. Obviously, this tax audit has brought him considerable pressure. Since he wants to destroy evidence, that precisely proves the existence of relevant evidence. All departments must step up actions. How is the work of instigating defections among relevant personnel going? Has the list been compiled?"

Pulling out and striking in—this was a key point in reconnaissance work. But frankly speaking, it hadn't played much of a role in dealing with the Liang family.

Xu Tong flipped through the folder and said, "Compiled." Saying this, he took out a list and handed it over, reporting: "There are a total of forty-three people on the list, including those from the periphery, the inner residence, business partners, and 'same-year' candidates. The Liang family has deep roots and has operated in Guangzhou for over a dozen generations. The inner courtyard is excessively strict."

Inside the Liang residence, only household-born servants of two or three generations or slaves who had received "heavy grace of life and death" had the opportunity to contact the core. The report stated: those serving Liang Cunhou were all women who never went out on ordinary days, effectively living in confinement; even their parents and relatives could only see them once a year. Striking in was impossible. The only hope was to "pull someone out."

"...We have direct or indirect contact with thirty-nine people on the list. To avoid alerting the enemy, we adopted the method of gradual infiltration and erosion through relationships like relatives and friends. Through interlocking links and reliable connections, we approach the core personnel of the inner residence layer by layer. We use colleagues, relatives, and fellow townsmen relationships to win over personnel and obtain intelligence. But to ensure steadiness, this method cannot be too hasty, so it is somewhat slow and hasn't made significant progress yet."

Yang Cao lowered her head to look carefully at the list while nodding: "Mm, expand the progress speed. Cannot wait anymore. Many key pieces of evidence, once gone, can never be retrieved again. Screen this list carefully one more time, narrow the scope, and concentrate on attacking a few key targets. Many conditions can be laid out directly for negotiation. Don't be afraid to promise, and don't be afraid to take responsibility. We must take them down quickly, break into the Liang family's interior, and obtain reliable intelligence sources. Currently, there are many established clans and big families in Guangzhou city who miss the Ming State. The more our new policies advance, the less willing they are to have their vested interests stripped away. The Liang family is typical; we need him."

Xu Tong said: "Okay, I will handle it immediately upon return. Tomorrow the screening results..."

Yang Cao cut him off: "Tonight."

Xu Tong said: "Tonight, the screening results will be presented to you."

Xu Tong closed the door and left. Only Yang Cao remained in the room. The afterglow of the setting sun burned the horizon into a patch of golden red, spilling in from outside the window as if draping Yang Cao in a golden cloak. Yang Cao stared fixedly at Liang Cunhou's photo in front of the blackboard, as if the two were looking at each other. After a long time, Yang Cao whispered: "Liang Cunhou, do you see it? This is the gaze of the General Bureau of Political Security."

In the evening, the clerk delivered the screening list, relevant materials on the tax case investigation, and assistance documents. Yang Cao pulled out the directory of this tax investigation from the kraft paper file bag and quickly browsed it. When she saw the line "Focus inspection on Lin, Liang, and Shi households as circumstances permit; report to Director Ai Zhixin for review," she frowned involuntarily and whispered: "Such ugly handwriting."

Although she had learned opera since childhood and was illiterate, let alone writing, she quickly learned a good hand in the training class. She had even won a grand prize in the Political Security System's calligraphy competition.

As for the list, she still felt unsatisfied after reading it. Because this list still failed to reach the people around Liang Cunhou. But there were a few people who indeed seemed to have possibilities.

Human nature has weaknesses. Yang Cao had seen too many human weaknesses, but she also knew that once beliefs were formed, whether others thought them right or wrong, many people would persist to the end. It just so happened that the Liang family was very seasoned and had deep accumulation in the means of winning people's hearts.

Since the Witchcraft Case, the Liang family's properties inside and outside the city were full of informants, staring at every move of the Liang family twenty-four hours a day. However, as soon as members of the Liang family entered the residence, it was like fish entering the sea; not a single bit of news could leak out.

The masters of the Liang family lived in seclusion and rarely went out, except for weddings and funerals of relatives and friends. Stewards handled everything. Even when they went out, they moved between the residence and various villas.

"This bunch of loach spirits! Not only slippery and hard to hold, but hiding tightly!" Yang Cao thought. "Really have no way to deal with them."

The office door knocked, and a clerk entered:

"Comrade Regional Vice Commander, the Guangzhou City Internal Security Meeting is about to start tonight..."

"I'm coming immediately." Yang Cao stubbed out the cigarette butt, tidied up the documents on the table, and locked the file cabinet.

More than ten people sat in a circle in the small conference room. Steam curled up from the tea in front of everyone. These were all the backbone members of the Guangzhou Political Security Branch. They whispered and exchanged opinions before the meeting, speculating about this meeting.

The content of the meeting could be guessed without much thought; it must be the follow-up to the Witchcraft Case. Although this case was said to be closed, the root behind it had never been dug out. It was also a sore point for the Political Security Bureau.

Before long, the click-clack of leather shoes came from outside the door. Yang Cao walked in carrying a folder, her figure upright. Her ear-length short hair and fitted uniform made her look vigorous and capable. Her face was somewhat gaunt from overwork, making her facial contours clearer and adding a touch of desolate grimness to her.

The conference room instantly quieted down. Yang Cao took the seat in the center of the horseshoe-shaped conference table and said: "Calling everyone for a temporary meeting this time, the content is mainly the adjustment of the focus of recent work. We will conduct a combing of anti-Song forces in Guangzhou. The classification of this meeting is Top Secret; the content of the meeting must not be leaked." Then she nodded to Xu Tong, signaling the start of the meeting.

Xu Tong stood up calmly, walked to the blackboard in front of the conference table, nodded to the crowd below, and then said loudly: "Hello everyone. The content of this meeting is mainly an analysis of the situation of local hidden anti-Song forces and our countermeasures. The content is mainly divided into three points. 1. The general attitude of local gentry in Guangzhou towards the Australian Song regime; 2. The main characteristics and actions taken by anti-Song forces; 3. Our countermeasures."

Xu Tong said: "First of all, because the Senate basically took over the Guangzhou regime peacefully, in order to ensure the smooth transition of power at that time, we actually made certain concessions of rights. We did not conduct detailed screening and investigation of the traditional gentry and landlord class in Guangzhou city. The Guangzhou landlord class had almost no reaction during the rapid takeover of power by the Australian Song, such as organized militia training, resistance, funding the enemy, or spying. But this was not because they didn't want to, but because they simply didn't have time to react. The quick and peaceful breaking of the city reduced our losses, but at the same time left significant hidden dangers for our governance after the takeover, preventing us from quickly and cleanly liquidating hostile forces."
