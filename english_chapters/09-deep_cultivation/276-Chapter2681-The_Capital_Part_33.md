# Chapter 2681: The Capital (Part 33)

Liu Sha followed Wu Hai into the inner room. The room was dim and smelled fishy. An eight-or-nine-year-old boy was chained in the corner, holding a sleeping infant in his arms, looking warily at the incoming people.

"Just collected today. This kid is too stubborn; in his hands is his younger sister. He refuses to let go dead or alive, and even bit Zhao San. I haven't had time to deal with him; starving him for two days first."

Liu Sha looked at the various tools for harvesting living beings and cutting/breaking limbs piled messily in the room, then looked at the boy opposite whose eyes were round with fear. He couldn't help sighing, bent down, changed to a kind tone, and asked: "What is your name?"

"Xu Yong." The boy answered tremblingly.

"Do you know what place this is?"

The boy nodded, then shook his head: "Not a good place."

"This is your sister? How old?"

"Not yet full month. Mother is gone." The boy burst into tears uncontrollably as if he had suffered a grievance as big as the sky.

For some reason, looking at this boy, Liu Sha suddenly remembered his deceased young son and muttered: "Sigh, should be about this big too."

"Usable?" Wu Hai urged seeing Liu Sha lost in thought.

Liu Sha withdrew his mind, sighed "Let it be," then said to the boy: "I can take you away. From now on, be my Daoist boy [*Dao Tong*]. Are you willing?"

"Then what about my sister? Mother said before leaving, can't let her die." The boy responded stubbornly.

"Your sister naturally will also go with me. I can guarantee her worry-free food and clothing in the future, only you two can't recognize each other anymore."

"Can I still see her?"

"Depend on fate. Separated to live, or together to wait for death?"

The boy thought for a moment, then bowed down and knocked a loud head: "Master above, receive a bow from the disciple."

Zhou Lezhi stood respectfully under the corridor eaves, doing the problems set by the Teacher on a small blackboard. Such systems of quadratic equations were no longer a difficult thing for him now—in the past, he viewed them as heavenly books.

Speaking of which, the Teacher's ability was truly great. Although he didn't understand what specific use these equations had, he had to say that only after learning did he know his brain was actually this good. Even the Teacher called him a "wonder." This inevitably made him somewhat proud.

This blackboard and chalk were also fiddled out by the Teacher himself. The blackboard was made by a carpenter, but the black lacquer on it was mixed by the Teacher himself. For this, Zhou Lezhi and the Teacher's page boy Wang Zhi ran to many places to buy all these things. Mr. Zhou ground, pounded, and mixed in the backyard... tossing about for several days, he made this set of "Blackboard and Chalk Set."

Seeing the Master writing and drawing on the blackboard triumphantly, Zhou Lezhi said cautiously: "Does the Teacher want paper? This student will go buy some."

"Paper is not suitable for teaching. Only a blackboard has a sense of ritual."

These unintelligible words made Zhou Lezhi feel like falling into five leagues of fog [confused], but the Teacher said countless such words a day; during the time in Guangzhou, he spoke even more similar nonsense. So he didn't take it to heart.

In Guangzhou for several months, Zhou Lezhi followed the Teacher running east and west, tossing back and forth, almost getting beaten several times, and relying on Liu Zhao's Jinyiwei waist tag several times to avoid being caught in the Yamen to eat a lawsuit. During the period, he visited relatives in Hetou Village once. Mr. Zhou even bragged that he could "brush his face" [use face as pass] in the village. As for how this face was brushed, Zhou Lezhi didn't see; instead, the Teacher was almost mobbed by several villagers whose heads were chopped off because of him [relatives of those executed]. Even Zhou Lezhi almost suffered the disaster of pond fish. The three could only flee in wretched states.

Zhou Lezhi only knew that the Teacher ran all over Guangzhou looking for a treasure called "Universe Mirror." With this treasure, although the Teacher might not necessarily be able to go up to heaven and down to earth and be omnipotent, at least he could touch stone into gold, not worry about food and drink, and absolutely wouldn't fall to become a retainer of Master Wang.

But regrettably, although the Teacher's trip to Guangzhou was searching for the Universe Mirror at all times, and even did the ugly thing of breaking into a merchant's home and being driven away, he ultimately gained nothing. Actually, even if Master Wang's letter hadn't come, they intended to pack up and return to the residence. After all, the travel expenses were almost spent.

Returning to the capital and seeing his daughter, the Teacher danced with joy for a while, then proposed to go to Zhiling's grave to offer sacrifices. This made Wang Liang, who came to welcome them, stuck for words for a moment, making excuses that he didn't handle the funeral affairs and would arrange the grave visit after asking clearly back at the residence.

However, the Teacher's love for Zhiling was only this much; instead, he had a special fondness for the daughter. He immediately named her Zhou Juli [Curie], holding her high in his arms every day. This astonished a group of servants—what was so rare about a girl film [little girl]?

Zhou Lezhi also liked the white and chubby Zhou Juli very much. It was just that observing coldly from the side, whenever Jieyi, Wang Zhi, and others watched the father and daughter enjoying themselves harmoniously, their faces would reveal intriguing expressions, seemingly sarcastic, seemingly sorrowful, and also containing some worry...

What exactly was the matter with this child? Zhou Lezhi felt there was probably some story inside, but he neither dared to ask nor dared to mention it in front of the Teacher.

"Teacher, I have solved the problem." Zhou Lezhi said respectfully to the Teacher who was squinting on the bamboo couch under the corridor eaves.

"En." The Teacher was looking at Jieyi teasing Zhou Juli in the courtyard at this moment, his face full of satisfied fatherly love. "Solve that geometry problem too. Don't use the method from last time—that was taught by me; try changing to another solution."

Since returning from Guangzhou, Zhou Lezhi often saw the Teacher in this appearance, muttering about getting such a courtyard within the "Second Ring," which was truly unthinkable.

Zhou Lezhi didn't know what "Second Ring" meant, but being able to live in such a courtyard, accompanied by a beauty like Jieyi, with Master Wang sending silver, firewood, and rice on time every month, the whole family ordering slaves and maids... even he would feel very satisfied. The only drawback was having no son, but the Teacher was still young, and now a person with money and status; heirs shouldn't be a difficult thing.

He quickly finished proving the geometry problem. Mr. Zhou probably didn't expect his proof to be so fast. He sat up and read his proof process carefully, eyebrows raising in surprise.

 generally speaking, the Teacher was quite satisfied with Zhou Lezhi's IQ and learning ability. At this moment, the satisfaction he expressed was obviously a level deeper.

"Good!" The Teacher praised. "Can draw inferences about other cases from one instance. Remarkable. You are indeed a rare smart person."

"It is all the Teacher's cultivation."

This wasn't flattery; the Teacher indeed spared no effort in his education.

"With your IQ, you have a great future. In the future, you can inherit my mantle."

The Teacher was very serious when saying this. Zhou Lezhi couldn't help feeling moved: "Many thanks, Master!" He felt somewhat guilty in his heart; he was an "undercover agent."

Since returning to the capital, the Teacher's daily life rhythm had been this leisurely. Besides teasing the baby at home, he went to Wang Yehao's residence to conduct consulting business every three to five days, and fought three hundred rounds with Jieyi at night.

Speaking of girls, the Teacher seemed to have some regrets about losing Zhiling. His lecherous nature flared up again, asking obliquely several times where to buy maids. Finally, Liu Zhao said that every year during the spring famine, there were many refugees outside Yongdingmen. Three or five taels of silver could buy a peasant girl with unbound feet, among whom there was no lack of yellow flower maidens with good foundations. It was just that the human market was currently withered; good goods had long been collected, and secondary goods either scattered or died. He had to wait until next year for a batch of new arrivals. The Teacher let it go, saying wait until next year.

The Teacher was obviously not completely satisfied with such a harmonious life. Not long after settling down, the Teacher took followers to wander around inside and outside the city every day, holding a map he drew himself that no one could understand. Zhou Lezhi quietly copied a copy of this map and sent it to Master Wang.

Looking at the marked major city gates, the Imperial City in the middle, and place names like Altar of Sun and Altar of Land and Grain, it should be the capital. But many circles were drawn on it, ring after ring. Unknown what it meant.

On this map, there were some place names that even local brothers of the Liu family didn't know, and some places were marked with crosses, seeming to be special locations.

Mr. Zhou took them to see all these places marked with crosses, looking east and west, inquiring if anyone had seen strange phenomena. Unfortunately, not only did they gain nothing, but they were also reported multiple times for "spreading rumors to confuse the crowd." If not for Liu Zhao protecting them, they might have been tied up to see the officials long ago.

"What do these rings mean?"

"Reporting to the Master, it seems to be extremely important things to Mr. Zhou." Zhou Lezhi mentioned the words he once muttered about the courtyard in the Second Ring. "...This small one also heard him sing some vulgar song, 'Ah, ah, Fifth Ring, you have one more ring than the Fourth Ring'..."

Master Wang and Liu Zhao both felt baffled. Liu Zhao pondered the map several times and said: "Master, maybe these circles are mileage charts. Hearthstone Daoist uses them to mark locations."

"Or perhaps talismanic secret codes?" Master Wang asked.

"The Master makes sense," Liu Zhao nodded. "Regardles of what it is, this must be some secret mark Hearthstone uses to label the map."

"You followed him out to search; did you find anything? Or any abnormalities?"

Both Zhou Lezhi and Liu Zhao shook their heads.

"He is probably still looking for the Universe Mirror." Master Wang muttered for a moment.

"Yes, but ever since he knew there were Australians, he seems to have stopped mentioning the Universe Mirror," Liu Zhao said.

"En, these Australians, don't know what background they have." Wang Yehao muttered. "Check that Gao Family for me; which house's gate they belong to."

"Nine out of ten it's the Big Eunuchs in the palace." Liu Zhao said. "However, with the Eunuch Party falling, if their master also falls, this would be a good opportunity."

"Brother Liu, he treated us so arrogantly, even the three words Jinyiwei couldn't bluff him. The threshold behind him is definitely not the Eunuch Party," Zhou Lezhi reminded.

Liu Zhao slapped his forehead and laughed: "Look at my confusion! If it were really Eunuch Party people, they would have shrunk back long ago. Little brother, you have some eyesight! But the threshold behind him being a eunuch in the palace is certain. Wait for me to inquire for a few days; surely will know."
