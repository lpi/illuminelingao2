# Chapter 2674: The Capital (Part 26)

"Many thanks for the *Lao Gong Zu*'s good intentions." Wang Yehao cupped his hands in thanks and turned to ask Mr. Zhou, "Does Mr. Zhou have elegance interest?"

Mr. Zhou was quite satisfied seeing Wang Yehao being so sensible. Judging by his appearance, he was originally prepared to act polite pretentiously, but fearing the cooked duck would fly away, he held back for half a day before squeezing out a sentence: "Haha, if the Master is busy, then I'll go have a look."

Zhou Lezhi almost couldn't hold back seeing the Teacher's coy manner. He felt that after getting along these days, the Teacher's true face was being revealed bit by bit. But he didn't dislike it.

Beside them, Prefect Zhou saw Wang Yehao yielding the courtesan queen to a *Qingke* and being perfunctory during the banquet. He knew this must be a person Master Wang valued. Immediately, he carefully scrutinized this "eccentric" with a peculiar accent and vulgar language. This person's face was white as jade, fingers slender as scallions; he should be a son of a wealthy family, probably hadn't read much, likely a dandy with considerable wealth and power at home. Thinking of this layer, Prefect Zhou hurriedly asked a servant boy to lead Mr. Zhou to seek fragrance.

The Teacher went to seek fragrance. Zhou Lezhi was hesitating whether to follow and serve, only to see Master Wang give him a wink, so he hurriedly followed.

Mr. Zhou followed the turtle slave [brothel servant] through winding paths to a small building. The turtle slave nodded and bowed, saying, "Great Master, this is the place."

Zhou Lezhi quickly took out a string of copper coins to reward the turtle slave and ordered him to withdraw. He waited downstairs himself. He saw the Teacher bounding up the stairs in three steps or two, then asking inside with feigned refinement at the door: "Is this Miss Youqing's boudoir?"

"Is it Master Wang?" A young woman's voice came from the room.

Zhou Lezhi originally thought the Teacher would announce his own name. Unexpectedly, he actually coughed and dragged his tone, putting on an official air: "It is exactly this Official."

This sentence almost made Zhou Lezhi laugh out loud.

He only heard a soft female voice coming from the pavilion: "Master Wang, please come in. This slave is changing clothes and it is inconvenient to welcome you. Hope the Master forgives the sin."
Although Zhou Lezhi was downstairs and didn't hear very clearly, the tone of charm directly made his blood boil, causing an unstoppable physiological change. He thought, *A famous courtesan is indeed a famous courtesan, truly formidable! The Teacher is blessed! Wonder when I can be like the Teacher...*

Mr. Zhou upstairs wasn't much better than him, anxiously saying, "This Official is coming!"

Hearing the sound of a door, he probably went in.

Then he heard the woman say with a slightly teasing tone, "Master Wang, remember to close the door."

Hearing a creak, followed by the sound of the door bolt dropping. Zhou Lezhi thought: *The Teacher is quite cautious!*

Unexpectedly, not a moment after this show of entering, he heard the Teacher let out a miserable scream: "Going to die!"

Zhou Lezhi laughed secretly in his heart: *Teacher, isn't this too fast!*

Unexpectedly, he then heard a woman's crisp shout: "Shameless Eunuch Party, die quickly!" Then came the sounds of tables and chairs overturning and objects falling. It scared Zhou Lezhi into a shudder all over. knowing there was a change inside, he immediately got up and rushed upstairs.

Before he could get upstairs, he heard a clatter of chaos inside. Intermixed was the Teacher's scream: "You! What do you want to do! Don't come over! Help! Help!"

Zhou Lezhi pushed the door violently, but it didn't move a bit; the door bolt inside was stuck firmly. In desperation, he pushed the door with all his might, shouting loudly for help: "Come quickly! Come quickly! There is an assassin!!!"

"Dog official! Go die!" The woman's hate-filled killing voice almost tore his eardrums. Suddenly, it became quiet inside instantly, followed by a *thump*, seemingly the sound of a person falling to the ground. Zhou Lezhi was so anxious that sweat streamed down his back, and he shouted for help continuously.

Turtle slaves and nursing home guards heard the cries for help from upstairs and panicked to come up to check. Unfortunately, the room door was bolted. Several people, together with Zhou Lezhi, took a good half day to pry it open. When the door opened and they looked, everyone was dumbfounded. The room was in a mess, with various objects thrown all over the room. On the ground, a scholar was pressing down a girl, still shouting for help incessantly. Helping wasn't right, not helping wasn't right either; the scene was very awkward.

A turtle slave said, "You don't understand. This is learning the play 'Guo Ai Drunkenly Beating the Golden Branch.' The person offended represents the Princess, so after beating, he has to beg for forgiveness."

Another guard quickly expressed a different opinion: "Pure nonsense. Beating the Golden Branch involves begging for forgiveness; this is shouting for help! This is clearly 'Tang Sanzang Trapped in the Daughter Kingdom'!"

Zhou Lezhi jumped anxiously: "This is a rebellion/assassination! Save Master Zhou quickly!"

Mr. Zhou heard this and was depressed, shouting with a crying tone: "This is a female assassin! Look, there is a dagger over there!"

Hearing it was an assassination, everyone then hurriedly rushed forward and helped Mr. Zhou up. At this time, a yard worker screamed, "This... this is not Miss Youqing!"

Only then did everyone realize the situation was bad. Several people quickly twisted the arms of the woman trying to get up and pressed her to the ground. Others quickly went to the front to report.

In a moment, Wang Yehao and his party rushed over. The crowd onlookers at the door quickly parted. Prefect Zhou immediately greeted the accompanying bailiffs: "Tie [him/her] up quickly for me!"

The bailiffs immediately stepped forward, held Mr. Zhou up, dragged him aside, twisted his arms, and were about to tie him.

"Wrong! Tie that woman!" Prefect Zhou found the target wrong and corrected quickly.

The woman was twisted by arms and pressed down by several big men at this moment, having no power to resist anymore. After being bound, she still cursed endlessly. Prefect Zhou gave a wink, and the guards quickly found a piece of rag to gag the woman's mouth.

"Teacher is startled. This..." Wang Yehao asked.

"This female thief wanted to assassinate Master Wang. Fortunately, she was subdued by me." Mr. Zhou recovered his breath and said with lingering fear, "The dagger is still over there."

As soon as these words came out, Prefect Zhou was scared pale. Someone assassinated a high minister in the venue he arranged, and when he came over just now, he had heard the woman vaguely shouting curses at the "Eunuch Party." If something happened, let alone his black gauze cap [official hat], his head might not be kept.

His face was gloomy, saying, "To have such a bold bandit dare to cause chaos here! Summon the Procuress!"

Hearing this, the Procuress was already ash-faced. Not to mention the target of assassination was Master Wang's staff member, even if an ordinary guest had an accident, she couldn't explain it easily. Trembling, she came upstairs, knelt down with a *thump*, and defended herself repeatedly: "Two Masters! This slave also doesn't know what is going on..."

"Who is this woman? Why is she in Miss Youqing's room?"

"Reporting to the Master, this slave doesn't know. This girl isn't a person in this slave's courtyard..."

"Bold! If she isn't a girl in your shop, could it be that this Official brought her?" Prefect Zhou snorted coldly and ordered: "Men! Beat her twenty small boards!"

The accompanying bailiffs answered in unison, dragged the Procuress to the ground, and beat her with a crackling sound. The Procuress screamed miserably and cried injustice repeatedly.

"This slave really doesn't know... really doesn't know... Aiya! Aiya... Master spare my life..."

Zhou Lezhi was already scared out of his wits at this moment, shrinking in the back seeking not to speak. Looking at the Teacher again, his face was iron-blue, unknown what brains he was moving.

After the beating, Prefect Zhou asked slowly, "Do you know now?"

The Procuress cried, "This slave truly doesn't know. Tonight this slave arranged for Miss Youqing to wait in the room. Before the banquet ended, I even checked, and the Miss was still there then... Master spare my life..." After speaking, she kowtowed repeatedly for mercy.

At this time, the lamps and candles were all lit, and the room was finally brighter. Liu Zhao poked his head to look at the female thief, instantly shocked with eyes wide open and spine chilling. He hurriedly leaned to Wang Yehao's ear and whispered, "My Lord, this is the daughter of Mr. Guo Yuan."

After hearing this, Wang Yehao's look of surprise only flashed for a moment, and he immediately began to take control of the scene: "Master Zhou, in this Official's opinion, this matter should not be publicized."

Seeing that Wang Yehao not only didn't blame him but actively helped him out of the predicament, Prefect Zhou quickly followed up: "What Master Wang says is very true!"

"There are many people and mixed eyes. I have to trouble Master Zhou to clear the venue. As for this female thief stealing late at night, this Official should interrogate her personally."

Hearing Wang Yehao define the matter as theft instead of assassination, Prefect Zhou knew his official hat was guaranteed. Moreover, the assassinating woman repeatedly mentioned "Eunuch Party" just now; he was even more afraid of fire burning his body. So he agreed hurriedly: "Yes, yes, yes, all depends on Master Wang to decide." After speaking, he instructed his subordinates to send this female thief quietly to Master Wang's boat.

Here, the yard workers and turtle slaves searched and found Miss Youqing. It turned out she was on the canopy bed, tied solidly with skirt ribbons, and her mouth was also stuffed with cloth. Hearing her say she was originally applying makeup in the room when she was suddenly hit heavily from behind, she fainted.

"This slave lay on the bed groggy and didn't know what happened outside..." Youqing cried. Seeing the situation, she knew something was fishy, so she insisted on knowing nothing.

"Old Ancestor, since there is a theft case in this Moon Plucking Tower, this student shouldn't disturb much more. I'll take my leave now." After speaking, he smiled slightly.

Prefect Zhou knew clearly in his heart and immediately said: "Men! Take down this Procuress and the Whore! Send them back to the Prefectural Yamen for interrogation!"

The Procuress and Youqing cried injustice repeatedly. However, the bailiffs were like wolves and tigers, wrapping iron chains around their necks, dragging and pulling the two down.

Zhou Lezhi was dumbstruck. It was his first time seeing a high official trying a case. When the clan handled disputes, favoring and bending the law was common, but at least they paid attention to a reason that passed on the face. This high official was good; directly disregarding right and wrong, inverting black and white. He turned back to Youqing's boudoir and saw Mr. Zhou sitting on the bed, panting heavily, seemingly still in shock.

Zhou Lezhi went over and whispered, "Teacher, how are you? Master Wang is going back..."

Mr. Zhou shook his head and whispered, "Bring me that powder compact."

"Powder compact?" Zhou Lezhi was stunned. Following his gaze, among the overturned objects all over the floor, a pink compact of peculiar material caught his eye. He quickly picked it up and handed it to the Teacher. The Teacher took it in his hand and examined it for a moment, his face full of horror. His hands trembled uncontrollably.

With a *clang*, the powder compact fell to the ground. Zhou Lezhi quickly picked it up. At this time, he saw a line of Western text impressively printed on the back of the compact—"Made in China."
