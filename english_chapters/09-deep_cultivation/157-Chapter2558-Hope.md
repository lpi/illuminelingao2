# Chapter 2558: Hope

Lin Jian saw Zhang Jiayu not speaking and stepped forward proactively: "Student Lin Jian, *sheng yuan* of the county school. Gathering here today with all the righteous warriors is truly a blessing of three lifetimes. Regarding the Daoist's plan, I have someone to recommend. This person likes swordsmanship, acts chivalrously, often travels with heroic men of the rivers and lakes, is quick-witted by nature, loyal to sovereign and country. He can surely bear this great responsibility."

"Oh?" Daoist Mushi became interested.

Lin Jian pushed Zhang Jiayu from behind and said: "It's my student, Zhang Jiayu."

Zhang Jiayu had originally not planned for this. Being pushed by Lin Jian like this, under everyone's gaze, his somewhat youthful fair-skinned face immediately turned crimson.

Seeing Zhang Jiayu's embarrassed appearance, someone immediately mocked: "Hahaha, a shy fair-faced scholar—can this serve as a spy unto death?"

At this time, Zhang Jiayu was after all only at the age of just reaching adulthood; his temperament wasn't settled. If it were any other day, with his forthright nature, he might have agreed right then. But at this moment, his heart was only on seeking medicine to save his mother. How could he care about any grand cause of opposing the Bald Bandits? Now that he had gotten involved in this affair, having been pushed by his teacher, if he couldn't explain clearly, it would be difficult to extricate himself.

He immediately suppressed his embarrassed emotions. His expression also returned to normal. He said to everyone: "Student Zhang Jiayu, studied military texts under my teacher for several years. Though not born into a scholarly family, I was taught the ways of Confucius and Mencius since childhood and also have a heart to serve the country. It's just a pity this student is a nameless nobody, lacking in talent and learning, and may be unable to bear this great responsibility."

Li Zhen said: "Brother need not be modest. I also heard your name when in the county school. Everyone called Dongguan's Zhiyuan [Zhang Jiayu's art name] a brilliant swordsman, acting chivalrously, well-versed in classics and histories, broadly talented with ambitions to order the world. What a pity we had no chance to befriend you in the past—truly regrettable. Heard Brother previously went to Guangzhou, away from home for quite some time. Must have been to infiltrate the tiger's den and probe the Australians' situation. Dingfu [Li Zhen's courtesy name] feels ashamed of being inferior."

"Is this really so? Worthy of being a descendant of Duke Zhang Wenxian, loyal through generations. Truly a young hero! Zhiyuan's conduct is indeed a model for our generation!" Su Guansheng exclaimed with slight surprise.

The handsome young man before him, Su Guansheng naturally recognized, was the clan brother of his teacher Zhang Yifeng. The Zhang clan had resided in Dongguan for generations; their ancestor was Zhang Jiugao, younger brother of Zhang Jiuling. Although this branch had declined by Zhang Jiayu's great-grandfather's generation—the family was poor—they were still a household that had farmed and studied for generations.

Zhang Yifeng, *juren* of the thirty-fourth year of Wanli, received appointment as Registrar of Kuizhou Prefecture, later promoted to Vice Commissioner of the Left Jiang Military Defense Circuit in Guangxi. Historically, after Zhang Jiayu passed the provincial examination, Zhang Yifeng, in order to cultivate this talented youth of the clan, invited him to study at the Military Defense Circuit's official residence. He even arranged marriage for this poor clan brother—showing Zhang Yifeng's emphasis on promising talent among the younger generation. It was precisely during this period of studying at the Military Defense Circuit's official residence that Zhang Jiayu's military qualities were greatly tempered. In the ninth year of Chongzhen, when the Emperor, to pacify bandits and settle the people, ordered capital officials to each recommend those they knew, Zhang Yifeng again recommended Su Guansheng to serve as Magistrate of Wuji County. Zhang Yifeng could be considered a small talent scout in Dongguan.

But what Su Guansheng, Zhang Jiayu, and others didn't know was that due to the butterfly effect brought by the Bald Bandits' appearance, Zhang Yifeng had been transferred to a capital position before the Bald Bandits launched their attack. At this time, Zhang Jiayu was still only a *xiu cai* [licentiate]; *xiu cai* who couldn't pass for *juren* in examinations were countless as carloads and bushels. Whether Zhang Jiayu could become a *juren* or even a *jinshi* [metropolitan graduate] in the future was still unknown. The Zhang clan was large with extensive assets, and Dongguan was a place where literary culture flourished greatly. Throughout the Ming dynasty, over thirty academies had existed, and *xiu cai* were numerous beyond count. Zhang Yifeng naturally wouldn't give special attention to Zhang Jiayu at this point. Now that Liangguang had fallen, Zhang Jiayu couldn't go to the Military Defense Circuit's official residence to study military arts, and Su Guansheng couldn't become his Magistrate of Wuji County either.

Zhang Mu heard what Su Guansheng said and noticed that the handsome young man before him was actually from the same clan as himself. Even more valuable was that among commoners, there was such a loyal and righteous man who liked swordsmanship and acted chivalrously. He immediately became filled with interest in him.

Under everyone's demands, Zhang Jiayu had no choice but to generally describe his sights and experiences in Guangzhou, including his participation in the Five Immortals Temple salon and joining the Shen Ao Academy run by True Hairs, making everyone click their tongues in wonder.

"Unexpectedly, among our generation there is someone who knows the Bald Bandits..."

"Even more valuable is that he actually infiltrated the Bald Bandits' academy and gained the attention of Bald Bandit leaders. This way, infiltrating among the Bald Bandits becomes much easier. Such an important task belongs to none other than Zhiyuan." People kept praising.

Mixing into the academy was originally nothing rare. Shen Ao Academy was an open venue; as long as a scholar interested in Australian learning was recommended by a formal member, they could enter. No qualifications needed. If one wasn't preparing to formally join, no oath was even required. To formally join also only required three formal members to jointly recommend.

Formal members versus ordinary members merely meant being able to borrow more profound Australian learning books to read; besides that, there were no other benefits.

But Zhang Jiayu being valued by True Hairs was indeed real. Among those in the academy seeking to attach themselves to True Hairs, quite a few existed, but very few caught Du and Cui's eye. Zhang Jiayu could be said to be one of them.

Zhang Jiayu, listening to the noisy praises, felt his blood surging and his head fuzzy. For him, although the Australians showed him appreciation, it wasn't enough to make him bow his head in submission. So from the beginning, he had no solid reason to refuse this anti-Bald group composed of teachers, classmates, and fellow villagers. Now, being praised by everyone, the loyalty, filial piety, propriety, and righteousness buried in his heart since childhood sprouted again. He tacitly accepted this momentous task that fell from the sky half-pushed and half-willing. It's just that his heart still worried about his mother's illness, wearing a bitter smile.

Zhang Mu saw this and said: "Zhiyuan seems unhappy; could there be some hidden troubles?"

Zhang Jiayu glanced at Daoist Mushi and said to Zhang Mu: "Brother Tieqiao is discerning. My elderly mother at home is seriously ill; medicine and stone have had no effect. Taking Australian sulfa several times hasn't improved her condition either. Teacher said an accomplished master would visit today; that is precisely why I came..."

Daoist Mushi was a clever person. He had long heard unusual implications from Zhang Jiayu's account of his Guangzhou adventures. So with a wave of his whisk, he smiled and said: "Since Young Brother is one of us and is willing to contribute to the great cause of opposing the Bald Bandits, this poor Daoist shall certainly assist with all his might. Since childhood, this poor Daoist has specialized in Qimen Dunjia [mysterious arts], Five Elements and Eight Trigrams, and also has some research in medical arts. I happen to have several excellent elixir pills on hand that can help your mother overcome this tribulation." Saying this, he took out a small white porcelain bottle from his Daoist robe.

Zhang Jiayu grasped at it like a drowning man clutching at straws. With a "thud," he knelt on the ground, kowtowing: "The Daoist's great kindness, Jiayu will never forget until my teeth fall out [until death]."

"However..." The Daoist's smile faded, and he said solemnly: "This medicine of mine was refined in the purple-gold elixir furnace using secret methods passed down by Laozi over nine times nine equals eighty-one days, containing one thread of true qi. This medicine only treats benevolent people, righteous people, courteous people, wise people, trustworthy people. If the heart leans toward Great Ming, it works. Whether your mother can overcome this tribulation depends on Young Brother's sincerity."

After speaking, Daoist Mushi carefully poured two yellowish-brown tablets from the small porcelain bottle and handed them to Zhang Jiayu, instructing him to take with clear water. A flash of reluctance crossed his face. Everyone inside the hermitage had never seen such medicine, thinking in their hearts it was surely an immortal family's treasure—indeed different from the ordinary.

Zhang Jiayu didn't understand the implications and repeatedly agreed.

Su Guansheng said: "Today is truly delightful. Brothers united, their sharpness cuts gold. The great cause of opposing the Bald Bandits will surely succeed."

After everyone discussed and agreed, to avoid attracting outside attention, they left Yan'an Hermitage in batches one after another. Zhang Mu, however, chatted more and more congenially with Zhang Jiayu, feeling a great regret of meeting too late.

Zhang Mu pulled Zhang Jiayu and said: "Our ancestors came from the same line; only because of long separation did we grow distant. Another day, I shall personally deliver a name card to your door to acknowledge our kinship. If we had different surnames, today I would borrow Yanke's precious site to swear brotherhood."

Zhang Jiayu felt quite flattered: "Brother Tieqiao is from a noble and wealthy family; how dare Jiayu presume so high?"

"Eh, Zhiyuan need not say more. We are both men of the rivers and lakes; why twist and fuss like a little woman?" Zhang Mu said straightforwardly.

Zhang Jiayu, seeing Zhang Mu so carefree, no longer declined. After mutually reporting family genealogy and seniority, he then addressed Zhang Mu as brother. Zhang Mu knew Zhang Jiayu worried about his mother's health and didn't detain him further. He himself stayed behind to chat about Buddhist teachings with Li Yunlong, whom he hadn't seen for years.

That day, Zhang Jiayu gave the yellowish-brown tablets from Daoist Mushi to his mother to take. About an hour later, her condition seemed somewhat improved. Zhang Jiayu, exhausted from days of toil, finally fell asleep leaning against the bed edge.

"Brother, Brother..." After an unknown amount of time, young Shibao shook Zhang Jiayu's shoulder and called out: "Mother is coughing again..."

Zhang Jiayu woke with a start. Unexpectedly, a night had already passed. Hearing his mother's heavy coughing, he thought to himself this was bad—could it be that his loyalty to Great Ming was insufficient, bringing harm to his mother?

After he cleared his head, he recalled the reminder from his sworn brother Zhang Mu when they parted. Zhang Mu had said: "I usually have no dealings with Su Guansheng, but I've long heard this person has great ambitions but little talent, lacking in strategy. For such a great matter as opposing the Bald Bandits, this person surely has no ability to manage it. The person behind the scenes must be that Daoist Mushi and that Stone Elder he mentioned. However, this Daoist is an outsider; his background is ambiguous. The rivers and lakes are treacherous; younger brother should keep your wits about you."

Zhang Mu's words were not without reason. These years, he had traveled across half of Great Ming's mountains and rivers; his experience in the world naturally couldn't compare to Zhang Jiayu who hadn't traveled far and was young. Only someone who knew the trade would recognize that Daoist Mushi's words were a smokescreen ancient doctors used to absolve themselves of responsibility. What if treatment failed—wouldn't it damage the miracle doctor's reputation? Daoist Mushi was liaising in various places; to win hearts, he inevitably displayed various "miracles." But where in this world was there any miracle elixir that cured all diseases? Once these words came out, if it couldn't be cured, it was all because of insufficient sincerity. If cured, it was all the Daoist's "miracle."

*Could it really be that only penicillin can save Mother?* Zhang Jiayu clutched the prescription written by the Fake-Hair doctor in his hand, recalling the doctor's mysterious expression.

Moments later, Zhang Jiayu made up his mind—take Mother to Guangzhou city.
