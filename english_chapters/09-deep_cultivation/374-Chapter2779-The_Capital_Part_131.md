# Chapter 2779: The Capital (Part 131)

Xu Yong spat out the grass stalk in his mouth and slowly retracted his body.

Just a few minutes ago, he had smelled something abnormal in front of the Zhou residence at Wanggong Factory.

After Mr. Zhou disappeared, his family members still lived here, but this residence, which used to be full of laughter and joy, had now lost its happiness and become deserted and fearful.

In the past, Xu Yong often followed Liu Zhao and Liu Sha here. Mr. Zhou was a very easy-going and interesting person. He never put on the airs of a master. Every time he went to the master's residence, not only did he not need to stand on ceremony, but he could also eat a lot of good things—the master especially liked to eat. Talking and laughing, it was much better than following Liu Sha and Liu Zhao. So every time they said they were going to the Zhou residence, he was impatient (eager).

Of course, the reason he was so willing to go to the Zhou residence was also because he could see Zhou Juli. Although Liu Sha didn't say it explicitly, Xu Yong knew that the fair and chubby little girl held in Mr. Zhou's arms was his younger sister.

So every time he went to the Zhou residence, he would find a chance to hug Zhou Juli and tease her. Every time he saw Juli smiling at him, he almost wanted to shed tears.

Liu Sha once subtly reminded him: Zhou Juli is the gentleman's biological daughter, and her mother is Yui. The gentleman is heavily used by Master Wang. Zhou Juli is now a young lady with beautiful clothes and jade-like food, and she will inevitably marry into a good family in the future.

Although Xu Yong was only a teenager, he understood the implication. He knew that this love of his could only be kept at the bottom of his heart and could not be revealed.

Juli has a good home. Following Liu Sha properly, although the work he did was not glorious, at least he was serving the master and didn't have to worry about food and drink. Liu Sha treated him as a "closed-door disciple" and taught him many tricks of the trade in the *Jianghu*. With these skills, making a living in the future would always be no problem.

One day, Mr. Zhou suddenly disappeared without a trace. He still remembered that day when he was called out by his master. They came to the residence together, and amidst the weeping of women and children, they carefully searched the entire residence, not even letting go of You Rong and Yui's boudoirs.

Subsequently, under Liu Zhao's order, all of Mr. Zhou's items, from clothes and hats to pens and ink, together with all kinds of strange and weird little gadgets in his study... as long as they were the gentleman's things, not a single one was left behind. They were all packed into boxes and carried away on the shoulders of the porters from the coolie guild.

What remained in this residence were only the two concubines left by the gentleman, two children, and a few servants. From then on, there was no more laughter and joy in the residence.

Later, he went back to the residence several times with Liu Sha or Zhou Lezhi. Even as a teenager, he could feel the desolation of things remaining while people had changed. Whether it was Yui or You Rong, as soon as they came, they would frantically grab them and ask where the gentleman had gone. And every time, all they could get was silence.

Zhou Lezhi would always comfort the two mistresses every time, but this kind of comfort, even in Xu Yong's eyes, was better than nothing. At the same time, the two children always widened their eyes and looked at them with faces full of fear.

Xu Yong couldn't bear it, so he always brought some snacks and candies for the children every time. Fortunately, although Mr. Zhou was gone, Master Wang still took care of them, so they didn't lack food and clothing, and servants were sent to continue serving. Zhou Lezhi and others would also visit from time to time.

One day, Xu Yong couldn't help asking Liu Sha: Where did Mr. Zhou go? Did he die?

Liu Sha asked back: "Do you think Mr. Zhou is still alive?"

Xu Yong pondered for a moment and said: "Mr. Zhou is probably still alive."

"Oh, why is that?"

"If Mr. Zhou were really gone, why would Master Wang still need to take care of his family? I'm afraid he would have given some silver to dismiss them long ago."

"You kid, cruel enough!" Liu Sha laughed, but there was a look of relief on his face, "Maybe it was Mr. Zhou's deathbed entrustment? Asking Master Wang to take good care of his family."

"In this apprentice's opinion, if it were really so, Master Wang would have sent them back to the estate in Jinhua to settle them, and certainly would not keep them in the Capital. It shows that Mr. Zhou is not only still alive but probably also still in the Capital, or at worst within the territory of Northern Zhili..."

Keeping the family members in the Capital to be taken care of on the spot showed that Master Wang had scruples. He was also guarding against Mr. Zhou wanting to go home one day.

Liu Sha nodded slightly and said: "What you said makes sense. However, whether he is dead or alive, I'm afraid only Master Wang himself knows."

"Master Wang..." Xu Yong hesitated for a long time, not knowing if he should say it.

"What do you want to say?"

"There is something, I don't know if Master knows?"

"What matter?"

Xu Yong lowered his voice and said: "Once when this apprentice was waiting for orders at the Wang family, I saw Wang Liang rush into the study and come out again, muttering 'This fellow has such big dog guts!'."

Liu Sha didn't think much of it: "What's so special about this..."

"There were only Mr. Zhou and Master Wang in the study at that time!"

Liu Sha immediately became nervous: "What did they say?"

"This apprentice couldn't hear the words in the inner study." Xu Yong said, "But later when Wang Liang and Wang Zhi were chatting, this apprentice heard a few sentences. Roughly speaking, Mr. Zhou 'fell out with the Master over a woman,' and they also mentioned a name called 'Zhiling'..."

Speaking of this, Liu Sha's face changed! After a long while, he instructed him not to mention this matter to anyone again.

The master didn't explain the reason, but judging from his expression, he completely knew why Master Wang and Mr. Zhou quarreled. He vaguely felt that Mr. Zhou's disappearance was related to this matter.

Although Mr. Zhou was gone, since Master Wang was still taking care of his family, his younger sister would be fine. Regardless of You Rong or Yui, they both understood that the two children were their reliance, and they wouldn't mistreat the children.

Liu Sha also instructed him to go around the Zhou residence in the Wanggong Factory area every now and then.

Two "widowed" women with young children, beautiful as flowers and jade, with some wealth, but without a head of the household to support the family, only a few servants. This was a piece of big fat meat coveted by all parties. Master Wang had greeted the official circles, so the yamen and the local *baojia* (community self-defense system) would not make trouble for them, but the *Jianghu* characters couldn't care about these. Especially those villains who specialized in abducting and kidnapping lone women were eyeing them covetously.

The soft approach involved teasing with words and exchanging letters, finally instigating them to pack up their valuables and run away privately; if they refused to run away, they would continue to be affectionate and ambiguous to figure out the routine of the residence. Waiting for an opportunity, they would break into the residence and abduct the women and their valuables. This was a specific profession in the *Jianghu*. There were especially many such villains in the Capital.

Speaking of defense, it couldn't be said that it wasn't strict. After all, Liu Zhao was an old hand in the *Jianghu* and knew the dangers inside. After receiving orders to clear out Mr. Zhou's items, he dismissed most of the servants in the residence, leaving only two families of Wang family's household servants to guard the doors and serve for purchases. Usually, the main gate was tightly closed. Except for purchasing items daily and clearing out feces and garbage, the doors were never opened. As for the people in the residence, they rarely went out. You Rong and Yui only went out once a month to burn incense. The stewards of the Wang family also visited the residence from time to time for inspection.

But as time went on, thoughts of change arose from extreme quietness, and naturally, trouble emerged. Especially You Rong, recently in this past year, probably felt that there was no hope for the gentleman to return, and she had some actions of unwillingness to be lonely. Xu Yong knew that as long as she had this heart, someone would naturally take advantage of the gap to enter.

He didn't care about You Rong's fate, but once something happened, the villains wouldn't let go of Yui and the two children either. For them, these were all high-quality "goods." Even if they only abducted You Rong, what if Master Wang got angry and stopped caring about Yui and the children? He, Xu Yong, didn't have the ability to raise his sister alone.

Therefore, every now and then, he would hover around the Zhou residence to see if there were any suspicious characters.

Today, as soon as he arrived near the Zhou residence, he discovered suspicious circumstances.

Three idlers were separated in a triangle formation on the street in front of the main gate of the Zhou residence. They seemed unrelated to each other, but they were staring fixedly at the main gate of the Zhou residence.

Xu Yong knew something was abnormal. After observing for a few minutes, he turned to the back door.

The back door of the residence was a cold alley and a shabby street. There weren't many people walking around even in broad daylight, but today, a fruit stall was rarely set up not far from the back door.

Although there were peddlers in such back streets and cold alleys, doing business with the servants of the residences, most of them were mobile peddlers who shouted while walking. No one set up a stall in a fixed place.

When he saw this peddler, Xu Yong knew that someone was targeting the Zhou residence.

Since they were only staking it out, it meant they wouldn't make a move for the time being. Xu Yong slowly retreated a few steps, turned around, and left.

Neither Master Wang nor his master had instructed him to guard the Zhou residence, but now that there was something strange around the Zhou residence, logically he should report it to his master immediately.

However, his master was now as newsless as Mr. Zhou. The only person he could ask for advice right now was Mr. Le.

Xu Yong didn't dare to delay and immediately went towards the Wanping County Yamen.

Just at the moment he turned to leave, in a dilapidated house he hadn't noticed, someone nodded in the direction he left. Two men who looked like street idlers immediately followed him, one in front and one behind.

Although Xu Yong was young, he was quite courageous and had been influenced by his master and Mr. Le. Even though the matter was urgent, he knew that the more anxious he was, the less he could break the rules. So he followed his usual practice, left Wanggong Factory, but didn't go north. Instead, he went all the way east, along the outer wall of the Elephant House to Xuanwu Gate.

He circled around the corridor shops in the barbican of Xuanwu Gate, where he discovered the idlers tailing him. He immediately gave up the idea of going back immediately, went directly out of Xuanwu Gate, arrived in the Southern City, and walked all the way south to enter Yongguang Temple.

Today was exactly the temple fair at Yongguang Temple. Xu Yong shook off the tracking here and went straight to Liulichang. After confirming that he had shaken off the tail here, only then did he re-enter the Inner City from Zhengyang Gate, made a big circle, came to the Wanping County Yamen, and dodged into a shabby alley on the side of the yamen.

This shabby alley was extremely long and the ground was full of mud and dirty water. The alleyway was even more tortuous. Xu Yong went around a crooked elm tree and dodged into the well house on the side. He waited quietly for a few minutes, seeing that no one followed behind, only then did he come out of the well house. Beside the well house was an inconspicuous small alley, allowing only one person to pass. He walked in.
