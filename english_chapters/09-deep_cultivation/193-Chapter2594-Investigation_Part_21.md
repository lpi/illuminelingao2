# Chapter 2594 - Investigation (Part 21)

Yuan Shuzhi stood in the accounts room courtyard, watching ants march across the flagstones. The weather was about to turn.

Over the past few days, the flow of ledgers had noticeably slowed. Judging by the dates in the running accounts, they were nearly caught up. Though he couldn't recall every entry he'd processed, the totals were burned into his memory: roughly two hundred thousand yuan across just two years of records.

It was a staggering sum. Yuan Shuzhi had never heard of any business—let alone one operating from such a modest shopfront—that could generate a hundred thousand yuan annually.

The Senate's "miracle drugs" were powerful indeed.

But as the ledgers drew closer to the present day, he knew his situation grew more perilous by the hour. Silencing witnesses, discarding the donkey once the grain was ground—even with Political Security watching the shop from outside, these people could simply poison his food and drink, sending him to meet his ancestors before anyone could intervene.

The more Yuan Shuzhi dwelt on it, the more certain he became that his life hung by a thread. Yet he dared not let it show. Each day he could only pace in circles, turning over escape plans in his mind.

He hadn't found a solution, but he had lost considerable hair. This particular day, while observing the ants, a servant came to summon him. Manager Gao wished to see him.

Yuan Shuzhi had no idea what this was about. He steeled himself and went.

At first, Manager Gao merely inquired after his daily comforts and praised the quality of his ledger work. The boss was very pleased—so pleased, in fact, that he was rewarding Yuan Shuzhi with twelve yuan.

"Please convey my deepest gratitude for the boss's generosity!" Yuan Shuzhi arranged his features into an expression of tearful appreciation.

"Your ledger work is exceptional, Mr. Shu. This money is well-deserved." Manager Gao waved dismissively. "However, the accounts here are nearly finished. My boss has several other properties requiring attention, so you'll need to relocate in a few days."

The words struck Yuan Shuzhi like a thunderbolt. He was currently working at Jubao Tang—Lu Cheng and the others knew this location. If they moved him elsewhere, his whereabouts would become completely unknown.

---

Despite his alarm, he could only feign composure. "May I ask where I'll be sent?"

"You'll know when the time comes. No need to ask questions now." Manager Gao's voice turned cold as ice. "Mr. Shu, as long as you do good work, there's plenty of money to be made. But don't ask what you shouldn't. Saves everyone trouble."

"Yes, yes, I understand!" Cold sweat broke out across Yuan Shuzhi's back. *This is it*, he thought. *I'm finished.*

Back in his small courtyard quarters, he considered whether he might scale the wall and escape. But the walls rose around him like the sides of a well—smooth surfaces offering no purchase. With his weak, bookish frame, any hope of climbing out was pure fantasy.

What about rushing the door? The two burly men stationed at the entrance could stop him without breaking a sweat.

He cursed himself for ever conceiving this wretched idea of "infiltrating the enemy." So far, he hadn't transmitted a single piece of intelligence, yet here he was about to lose his life.

Now completely at their mercy, Yuan Shuzhi had no choice but to appear compliant and take things one step at a time.

He remembered that Lu Cheng had arranged a signal beforehand: if an emergency arose and escape proved impossible but rescue was needed, Yuan Shuzhi would use purchases to send his message. Specifically, having a servant buy him cigarettes.

Yuan Shuzhi was a habitual smoker, so since arriving at Jubao Tang, he'd been sending a servant to buy cigarettes every three or four days. Per their arrangement, he rotated through different brands. If circumstances became urgent, he'd request "Holy Ship" cigarettes—Gold Holy Ship for "crisis," Red Holy Ship for emergency rescue.

But his signals were completely blocked. No matter what brand he requested, the servant invariably returned with White Holy Ships.

After several more agonizing days, they finally came for him. He was loaded into a two-man sedan chair and carried off into pitch darkness, ascending and descending through terrain he couldn't see or identify. He had no idea how far they traveled. When the sedan finally stopped and he emerged, dusk was falling. They had halted in a small courtyard, and in the fading light, he could make out mountains rising on all sides. He was deep in the wilderness now.

Yuan Shuzhi braced himself, descended from the sedan, and allowed himself to be led into the main hall.

The hall was lit. Three men sat waiting.

Though lamps burned, all three had positioned themselves with their backs to the light—their faces obscured in shadow. From his build, one appeared to be Manager Gao.

Indeed, Manager Gao spoke first: "This is our master."

It was Yuan Shuzhi's first time meeting Jubao Tang's owner. He knew from Lu Cheng that the man's name was Quan Youde.

He immediately swept into a deep bow. "Greetings, Master."

"Sit. Have tea." Master Quan gestured to a chair. Yuan Shuzhi expressed his thanks and sat, noting that the atmosphere didn't suggest immediate silencing. His heart unclenched slightly.

"Have you been comfortable these past few days?"

"Everything has been well, Master!"

"I've reviewed your ledgers. Fine work." Master Quan nodded. "I've been lacking someone who understands Australian accounting methods like you do. Where did you learn?"

"The fiscal accounting training program run by the Guangzhou Tax Bureau," Yuan Shuzhi said quickly. "I was in the ninth cohort."

"Oh? So you're a naturalized citizen?"

"Not at all, not at all." Yuan Shuzhi waved his hands. "I wanted to be one, but they wouldn't have me! Said I was too old!" He sighed heavily. "Old and worthless!"

"If you're not a naturalized citizen, how did you gain admission to the Australians' school?"

"Well, the training program accepts anyone willing to pay tuition themselves..." Yuan Shuzhi explained. "Many of the students were sent by bosses of various Guangzhou establishments. I was the same."

Quan Youde pressed him further about his former employer. Yuan Shuzhi answered smoothly. Then came questions about his earlier life—Yuan Shuzhi provided suitably rough details.

The interrogation actually kindled hope in Yuan Shuzhi's chest. When he'd first arrived at Jubao Tang, Manager Gao hadn't questioned him so thoroughly. If they truly intended to silence him, why bother with such detail?

When the questioning concluded, Quan Youde apparently found nothing amiss. He glanced toward the man seated deepest in the shadows. The figure nodded slightly but remained silent.

"The accounts you've done for me are very satisfactory," Quan Youde said. "These ledgers were nearly finished. Originally, I'd planned to dismiss you once they were complete..."

Yuan Shuzhi couldn't suppress a shudder.

"...However, since you're familiar with Australian accounting, and we currently need capable people, I'm considering keeping you on. Are you willing?"

How could Yuan Shuzhi possibly refuse? "I'm alone in this world with no one to rely on. To have a place where I can earn my keep—how could I be unwilling?"

"Hehe, that's not the right way to think about it." Quan Youde affected magnanimity. "Look at this first, then decide."

He gave an order, and Manager Gao soon appeared bearing a tray. When the silk cloth was lifted, the gleam of silver dollars nearly blinded Yuan Shuzhi.

"This..." He stared at Quan Youde in astonishment.

"If you commit yourself to my service, this tray of two hundred silver dollars is yours. Plus thirty yuan monthly going forward. And in the future, perhaps endless wealth and glory." Quan Youde paused. "But I must be clear: working for me means engaging in business that risks beheading—extremely dangerous."

"I—I don't understand..." Yuan Shuzhi's face showed shock and bewilderment—not entirely feigned. He'd originally thought he was investigating a counterfeit drug operation. He'd never expected to find something this massive lurking behind it.

"Don't be afraid. We serve the Court. We're not bandits or robbers." Quan Youde spoke slowly. "If you're unwilling to accept this risk, a sedan chair outside is ready to take you back to the medicine market. Inside you'll find fifty yuan—consider it a parting gift for our time together. Only, you must never speak of this experience again."

Anyone with half a brain could tell from Quan Youde's words that no second path existed. Yuan Shuzhi immediately declared: "I'm willing to follow you, Master!"

"You're not afraid?"

"Afraid of what?" Yuan Shuzhi said. "At this point, never mind other reasons—for this silver alone, I'd face anything."

Quan Youde laughed heartily. "Good! I never expected Mr. Shu to be such a straightforward man!" He clapped his hands, and a servant appeared with wine.

"I drink this with you. From now on, we're brothers—sharing life and death."

Yuan Shuzhi could only smile broadly and drain his cup.

"Since we're brothers now, there's no need to hide things from you." Quan Youde gestured around the room. "I'm Quan Youde, Jubao Tang's owner. And this is Daoist Mushi. From now on, you'll work under him."

At this, the one called "Daoist Mushi" stepped into the lamplight. Yuan Shuzhi studied him carefully: a purple-sun Daoist cap, a blue-gray hemp Daoist robe, three wispy whiskers cascading down his chest—the very picture of immortal transcendence. Yuan Shuzhi quickly paid his respects.

"No need for formalities." Daoist Mushi's manner was warm and affable. "From now on, we're all family, all serving the Court."

"Yes, yes. I'll rely on the Daoist's guidance!" Yuan Shuzhi said. "Whatever you need from me, just give the word. I'll go through fire and water without hesitation."

"Hehe, you flatter me!" Daoist Mushi chuckled. "At your age, how could I ask such things? But since you've joined us, you must observe the rules here. It's not that I'm harsh—this is truly a beheading business. Under my command, any breach of the rules, regardless of intent, is allowed once. Only once. Do you understand?"

"Yes, I understand!" Yuan Shuzhi said quickly. "I've been down on my luck my whole life. Now that I have a chance to serve the Court and turn my fortune around, I absolutely won't break the Daoist's rules!"

"Very well. You'll stay by my side from now on, managing my accounts with the Hairies." Daoist Mushi nodded toward the door. "Manager Gao, take him to his quarters to rest."
