# Chapter 2594 - Investigation (Part 21)

Yuan Shuzhi was in the accounts room courtyard watching ants on the move. The weather seemed about to change.

These past few days, the ledgers being sent had noticeably decreased. Judging from the running account dates, the accumulated ledgers were almost finished.

Though he couldn't memorize all the ledgers he'd done these days, he knew the totals clearly. From first to last, roughly two hundred thousand yuan—and the ledgers spanned only two years.

This was truly a jaw-dropping business. Yuan Shuzhi had never heard of any business that could generate one hundred thousand yuan annually from such a small shop.

The Senate's "miracle drugs" were indeed powerful! Yuan Shuzhi thought.

But as the incoming ledgers grew more recent, he knew the situation ahead was becoming increasingly perilous.

Killing to silence witnesses, discarding the donkey after grinding the grain... Even knowing Political Security was watching outside the shop, they might poison his food and drink, sending him straight to the afterlife. Political Security definitely couldn't rush in to save him in time.

The more Yuan Shuzhi thought, the more he felt his life was in danger. But even so, he dared not show it. Every day he could only pace in circles, pondering escape plans.

He hadn't come up with a solution, but had lost quite a bit of hair. This day, while watching the ants, a servant came to summon him—Manager Gao wanted to see him.

Yuan Shuzhi didn't know what this was about. He could only steel himself and go.

At first, Manager Gao just asked about his daily life and praised his excellent ledger work. The boss was very pleased and specially rewarding him with twelve yuan.

"Thank you for the boss's generous gift!" Yuan Shuzhi put on a tearfully grateful expression.

"Mr. Shu's ledger work is excellent. This money is well-deserved." Manager Gao waved his hand. "It's just that the ledgers here are nearly finished. My boss has several other properties whose accounts need clearing. So you'll need to relocate in a few days."

Hearing this, Yuan Shuzhi felt thunderstruck. He was currently doing accounts at Jubao Tang—Lu Cheng and the others knew this. If they really moved him somewhere else, his whereabouts would be completely unknown.

---

Despite this, he could only feign composure: "May I ask where you're sending me..."

"You'll know when the time comes. No need to ask more now." Manager Gao's words were cold as ice. "Mr. Shu, as long as you do the accounting well, there's plenty of money for you to earn. But don't ask questions you shouldn't. Saves trouble."

"Yes, yes, I understand!" Yuan Shuzhi broke into cold sweat, thinking: My life is over!

Back in his small courtyard residence, he wondered if he could scale the wall and escape. But the walls were like a well, with nothing to climb on any side. With his own weak, bookish build, hoping to scale the wall and escape was pure fantasy.

What about rushing the door? The two burly men at the entrance alone were enough to block him.

He secretly regretted why he'd ever come up with this lousy idea of "infiltrating the enemy." So far, he hadn't sent out a single piece of intelligence, yet was about to lose his life!

Now at others' mercy, Yuan Shuzhi couldn't resist. He could only appear compliant and take things one step at a time.

Yuan Shuzhi remembered that Lu Cheng had agreed beforehand: if an emergency arose and he couldn't escape but needed rescue, he'd use purchasing items to send a distress signal. Specifically, having the servant buy him cigarettes.

Yuan Shuzhi had a smoking habit, so since arriving at Jubao Tang, every three or four days he'd send a servant to buy cigarettes. Per their agreement, he didn't stick to one brand but rotated through brands. If things became urgent, he'd have the servant buy "Holy Ship." Gold Holy Ship meant "crisis"; Red Holy Ship meant emergency rescue signal.

But Yuan Shuzhi's signals were completely blocked. No matter what cigarettes he requested, the servant always brought White Holy Ships.

After several more anxious days of waiting, one day he was loaded into a two-man sedan chair and carried away. Through pitch darkness, going up and down, he didn't know how far they traveled. When the sedan stopped and he emerged, dusk was falling. The sedan had stopped in a small courtyard. In the fading light, he could only see surrounding mountains on all sides—clearly deep in the mountains now.

Yuan Shuzhi steeled himself and descended from the sedan, being led to the main hall of the courtyard.

The main hall was lit. Three men sat waiting.

Though lit, all three men had their backs to the lamplight—their faces indistinct. From body shape, one appeared to be Manager Gao.

Indeed, Manager Gao spoke: "This is our master."

This was Yuan Shuzhi's first time seeing Jubao Tang's owner. He knew from Lu Cheng that this establishment's owner was named Quan Youde.

He immediately bowed deeply: "Greetings, Master."

"Sit. Have tea." Master Quan waved, indicating he should sit. Yuan Shuzhi quickly expressed thanks and sat down. Seeing the current situation didn't suggest immediate silencing, his heart slightly relaxed.

"Have you been comfortable here these days?"

"Reporting to Master, everything is well!"

"I've reviewed your ledgers. Well done." Master Quan nodded. "I've been lacking someone who understands Australian accounting like you. May I ask where you learned this?"

Yuan Shuzhi quickly said: "The fiscal accounting training class run by Guangzhou Tax Bureau. I was in the ninth cohort."

"Oh? So you're of naturalized citizen background?"

"Not at all, not at all." Yuan Shuzhi waved his hands. "I wanted to be one, but they wouldn't have me! Said I was too old!" He sighed. "Old and worthless!"

"If not a naturalized citizen, how did you get into the Australians' school?"

"Well, the training class lets you study as long as you pay yourself..." Yuan Shuzhi explained. "Many people there were sent by the bosses of various Guangzhou establishments. I was the same."

Quan Youde interrogated him more about his former employer's matters. Yuan Shuzhi answered fluently. Then questions about his earlier life—Yuan Shuzhi also described them roughly.

This interrogation actually gave Yuan Shuzhi hope. When he'd arrived at Jubao Tang, Manager Gao hadn't asked so thoroughly. If they really meant to silence him, such detail seemed unnecessary.

After the interrogation, Quan Youde apparently found no issues. He glanced at the man seated deepest in the shadows. The other nodded slightly but said nothing.

Quan Youde said: "The accounts you've done for me are very satisfactory. These ledgers were nearly finished. Originally, I'd planned to dismiss you once the ledgers were done..."

Yuan Shuzhi couldn't help shuddering at this.

"...However, since you're familiar with Australian accounting, and we're in need of people now, I'm thinking of keeping you on to continue accounting. Are you willing?"

How could Yuan Shuzhi dare say no? He replied: "I'm alone and helpless in this world. Having a place to eat—how could I be unwilling?"

"Hehe, that's not how to put it." Quan Youde affected magnanimity. "Look at this first, then decide."

With that, he gave an order. Soon Manager Gao brought a tray before him. Lifting the silk cloth covering it revealed glistening silver dollars—nearly blinding Yuan Shuzhi's eyes.

"This..." He looked at Quan Youde in astonishment.

"If you're determined to follow me, this tray of two hundred silver dollars is all yours. Plus thirty yuan monthly hereafter. In the future, perhaps endless wealth and glory too." Quan Youde said. "But I must also make clear: following me means doing business that risks beheading—extremely dangerous."

"I—I don't understand..." Yuan Shuzhi's face showed shock and bewilderment—not entirely feigned. He'd originally thought he was investigating a fake drug case. He never expected such a huge case behind the fake drugs!

"Don't be afraid. We serve the Court. We're not bandits or robbers." Quan Youde said slowly. "If you're unwilling to take this risk, a sedan chair outside is ready to take you back to the medicine market. Inside are fifty yuan—consider it a parting gift for our time together. Only, never speak of this experience again."

Anyone who wasn't a fool would know from Quan Youde's words that there was no second path before him. Yuan Shuzhi immediately said: "I'm willing to follow Master!"

"You're not afraid?"

"Afraid of what?" Yuan Shuzhi said. "At this point, never mind other reasons—for this silver alone, I'm not afraid anymore."

Quan Youde laughed heartily: "Good! I never expected Mr. Shu to be such a straightforward person!" With that, he clapped his hands. A servant brought wine.

"I drink this wine with you. From now on, we're brothers—sharing life and death."

Yuan Shuzhi could only smile broadly and drink the wine.

"Since we're brothers now, some things needn't be hidden from you." Quan Youde said. "I'm surnamed Quan, named Youde, Jubao Tang's owner. This is Daoist Mushi [Wooden Stone]. From now on, you'll work under him."

At this moment, the one called "Daoist Mushi" came into the lamplight. Yuan Shuzhi looked carefully and saw before him a person wearing a purple-sun Daoist cap, dressed in a blue-gray hemp Daoist robe, three wispy long whiskers cascading across his chest—an appearance of immortal transcendence. Yuan Shuzhi quickly paid respects.

"No need for formalities." Daoist Mushi was kind and affable. "From now on, we're all family, all serving the Court."

"Yes, yes. I'll rely on the Daoist's guidance!" Yuan Shuzhi said. "Whatever you need from me, just command, Daoist. I'll go through fire and water without hesitation."

"Hehe, you jest, sir!" Daoist Mushi said. "At your age, how could I ask you to go through fire and water? But since you've joined, you must observe the rules here. Not that I'm harsh as a master—this is truly a beheading business. So under my command, for any rule-breaking, regardless of intention, there's only one chance. Do you understand?"

"Yes, I understand!" Yuan Shuzhi hurried to say. "I've been down on my luck my whole life. Now that I have a chance to serve the Court and turn my fortune around, I absolutely won't break the Daoist's rules!"

"In that case, you'll stay by my side from now on, specifically managing my accounts involving the Hairies." Daoist Mushi nodded. "Manager Gao, take him to his quarters to rest."
