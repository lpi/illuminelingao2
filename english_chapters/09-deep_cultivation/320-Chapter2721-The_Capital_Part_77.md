# Chapter 2721: The Capital (Part 77)

He didn't go to the west wing first. The main target was captured and couldn't escape. The interrogation that followed was the key.

An old *Jianghu* hand like Liu Sha, who had spent years in the Brocade Guard, couldn't be made to talk with just a few words or a few blows. *Jianghu* people may not have other abilities, but first, they could endure suffering, and second, they had mastered the art of telling people what they wanted to hear and spirits what they wanted to hear. Even under severe torture, their words would be a mix of truth and lies.

To question him, they first needed to know his background. At the very least, they needed to understand his current situation to know where to aim.

From his setup, Liu Sha clearly had been on guard, but that wariness wasn't necessarily directed at them.

Entering the main building, the central room appeared normal except for a charcoal brazier on the floor, a clay pot simmering atop it. The strong scent of medicine permeated the air.

The medicine smell was pungent. Min Zhanlian, having traveled the *Jianghu*, knew something about medicines. One sniff told him this wasn't wound medicine's formulation. Could Zhou Ruolan's judgment have been wrong?

His subordinate was already waiting at the door to the east room. Seeing him approach, he immediately lifted the curtain and said in a low voice, "There's a dead person inside!"

Min Zhanlian nodded slightly. Inside, the Australian oil lamp had been lit, illuminating everything. The furniture was in disarray, clearly hastily tidied. Some pieces had obvious damage; in particular, the alcove bed on the floor had broken carvings and moldings. Several panels of the bed curtains hanging from the frame were missing.

On the walls, there were shockingly large splatters of blood. Though the bed had been wiped and the bedding changed, they could still see the remaining spots on the frame.

From the scattered ashes on the floor, quite a lot must have splattered there too.

On the table, incense burned in a censer. The medicine smell mixed with the incense was extremely pungent, but still couldn't mask the smell of blood inside.

"Where's the body?"

"In the chest." A subordinate opened a large official trunk. Inside, a male torso was twisted, covered with ashes.

"This is the person who came yesterday," the subordinate said in a low voice.

Why had this person come, and why had he been killed? They knew nothing. To pry open Liu Sha's mouth, they needed to understand the mystery. He immediately said, "Get him out!"

By now, the body had stiffened. It took several people much effort to lift the awkwardly positioned corpse out of the chest and lay it on the ground. Zhou Ruolan entered and carefully examined it by lamplight. She said in a low voice, "He has two wounds: one in the lower back, one in the neck. The fatal one is the neck—the carotid artery was severed."

"No wonder there's so much blood sprayed here!"

She examined the skin on the hands, feet, and around the wounds more closely. "The original intent was probably to stab the kidney from behind for a quick kill, but the thrust went off-mark and wasn't fatal. The victim fought desperately—there are wounds on his hands and arms."

The clothes were covered in blood. From the dead man's attire and appearance, he was clearly a retainer or attendant of a wealthy household.

A quick search of the body turned up nothing. Obviously, Liu Sha had already searched him.

"Squad Leader, look at this." A team member searching the room pulled out the mostly burned remains of a document case from the brazier on the floor.

A document case was a standard item for retainers, holding the master's visiting cards or important documents. Each household's case was different. Liu Sha's urgency to destroy it suggested he wanted to hide the dead man's identity.

"What can you tell from this case?" He handed the remains to Little Five.

Little Five turned it over a few times and said, "Used by wealthy households in the capital. And specifically by families of high officials. The case is made of quality materials, but designed to be understated." He pulled out a few half-burned scraps of plum-red paper from inside. "This visiting card paper is also refined. The pattern is clearly from the Songyun Pavilion Southern Paper Shop in the capital. Only families of officials and nobles use their goods." He studied it for a while and sighed, "Unfortunately, only scraps remain. Not a single character is left."

This person had walked in openly, so he was clearly someone Liu Sha knew. His visit to Liu Sha obviously carried an important mission. The two had discussed something secret here. For some reason, a conflict arose, and Liu Sha decided to kill him. But he failed to kill with one blow.

Now the man was dead, and Liu Sha was injured. The lime purchase was for the cleanup. It all connected. They just didn't know who this person was, but judging by his status, he was likely a liaison between Liu Sha and someone higher.

Unfortunately, his identity was unknowable, or it would have been an important lead. However, Liu Sha was still alive.

Entering the west wing, he saw a middle-aged man reclining on a couch. The blanket had been pulled aside, his upper body bare, bandages wrapped around his shoulder and chest, with faint bloodstains seeping through. His complexion was pallid; his hands and feet were firmly bound.

Beside the bed was a seductive woman, hands tied, eyes blindfolded. On the table lay many medicine bottles and boxes in disarray.

"The wound isn't serious. Just muscle cut. He can't move his arm right now," a subordinate reported.

Min Zhanlian nodded and signaled for his subordinates to take the woman out.

"Liu Sha?" he asked.

"That's me," Liu Sha said in alarm. Yesterday's affair wasn't yet settled, and today he'd been struck by disaster. Several days ago, he had noticed what seemed like surveillance around him. For safety's sake, he had been preparing to return to the capital to lie low. He hadn't expected such a major incident!

The other side had come prepared. Playing dumb wouldn't work.

Min Zhanlian sat down. Zhou Ruolan immediately moved a stool beneath him. The two moved like flowing water. Liu Sha groaned inwardly.

Looking at this young man's manner, his origins were clearly not small. He was definitely not an ordinary *Jianghu* person.

"I don't know what guidance the hero has for this visit," Liu Sha said, forcing himself to steady his nerves. "If you're short a few travel expenses, I've been in the *Jianghu* for years, reading winds and telling fortunes. I've made some money. Take it all."

Min Zhanlian smiled. "How much silver do you have? Tell me."

"Well..." Liu Sha's mind raced. He immediately said, "I have over four hundred taels of silver here, plus some jewelry worth about a hundred taels. The hero can take it all."

"Not enough." Min Zhanlian shook his head. "Too little."

"Well..." Liu Sha's face alternated between pale and white. He still hadn't figured out the visitor's purpose. If it was money, he had plenty—banknotes plus cash totaling over ten thousand. But most of that was "official funds," and it wasn't with him anyway.

"Well, I'm just a fortune-teller. No matter how good business is, this is all the money I have. Please show mercy."

"What about the corpse hidden in your trunk?" Min Zhanlian said coldly. "That body alone is worth several hundred taels, isn't it?"

Liu Sha was startled again. He knew these visitors meant trouble. He said in a low voice, "Since the hero has already seen, let's speak plainly. We're all people who make our living in the *Jianghu*. No need to fight over a bit of money. Give me a way out, and I'll see if I can take it. As long as it's not a dead end, consider us friends!"

"Good, straightforward." Min Zhanlian smiled. "The silver I want isn't much—one hundred thousand taels!"

Everyone in the squad caught Liu Sha's momentary shock and the flash of terror in his eyes.

"Got him. It's him!"

"That... that..." Liu Sha lowered his head in panic. "Don't joke, hero. Who am I to have one hundred thousand taels of silver..."

"You don't have it, but the 'God of Wealth' you invited does," Min Zhanlian said coldly.

Liu Sha's expression became even more panicked. He managed to mutter, "I haven't invited any God of Wealth. Even worshiping gods and Buddhas wouldn't earn me one hundred thousand. This... this is too absurd..."

"Liu Sha, stop pretending." Min Zhanlian said. "Tell me—where is this Manager Leng, the Cold God of Wealth?"

"I don't know any Manager Leng..."

"Hmm? Did I say the Cold God of Wealth was a manager?" Min Zhanlian smiled.

Liu Sha sweated profusely, his wound throbbing with pain. He managed to say, "I wasn't the one who invited the God of Wealth. I don't know where he is."

"I think you'd better know. Otherwise, don't blame me for not following *Jianghu* rules."

"Heh, boy, I don't know who you are, but I've been in the *Jianghu* for years. I used to serve in the Embroidered Uniform Guard. The suffering I've endured is more than the water you've drunk. You think you can threaten me?" Liu Sha saw that playing the hapless victim wasn't working, so he changed his face.

"I know you're an elder," Min Zhanlian said unhurriedly. "Not afraid of torture. Probably not afraid of losing your life either. But shouldn't you think about this woman?" He spoke in a chilling tone. "The women with me are most skilled at 'women's punishments.' Rest assured—as long as you speak, they won't take her life."

Liu Sha's heart was churning by now. The person before him was obviously a *Jianghu* expert hired by the Short-Hairs from elsewhere. Judging by their actions, they must be major bandits. Today, whether he talked or not, he was dead. He sneered, "She's just a whore. You think you can use her to control me? Dream on. Do as you please with her—rape or kill."

Little Five called out loudly, "Did everyone outside hear that?"

From outside came a piercing scream, then a woman crying: "You heartless man! I've served you all this time, and you say such cold-hearted words..."

Min Zhanlian made a slight gesture, and the noise outside stopped. Liu Sha raged, "You dogs who don't follow *Jianghu* rules..."

"You just gave us permission to do whatever we want with your woman, and you're talking about *Jianghu* rules?" Min Zhanlian mocked. "I hope she doesn't know too much about your affairs."

Liu Sha knew further pretense was useless. He asked, "Who are you?"

"We work for the Australians." Min Zhanlian revealed his identity. "Since we've both come clean, no need to hide. Tell me where Manager Leng is, and I guarantee your life."

"You're just a pawn of the Short-Hairs. Why should I believe you?"

"Believe it or not, it doesn't matter. Just as you said—I'm giving you a path. It's not a dead end. Will you take it or not?"

Liu Sha gritted his teeth, silent. By now, his mind was in turmoil. Since the Short-Hairs had captured him, they would never let him go easily. Whether he could survive was still unknown...
