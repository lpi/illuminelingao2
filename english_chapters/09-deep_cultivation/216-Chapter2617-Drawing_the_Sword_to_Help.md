# Chapter 2617: Drawing the Sword to Help

Le Ziren had an expression of obeying orders, while Zhang Jiayu nodded.

"My Mom can't go on with him and wants a divorce," Guan Zongbao pulled Huang *Shi* and urged, "Mom, speak to the officer."

Huang *Shi* hesitated, but under Guan Zongbao's repeated persuasion, she finally opened her mouth. As she spoke, she began to cry. Years of bitterness finally found a vent, and she finally had someone to confide in. She poured out everything from how she married into the Guan family, how her in-laws bullied her, how her husband reveled in dissipation outside when he was young, how he mentally tortured the mother and son after falling ill, how he disregarded his son's future and made him drop out of school... Even old rotten sesame and grain matters were all shaken out. She rambled on in one breath for nearly an hour.

Zhao Hening was infected by Huang *Shi*'s emotions and couldn't help remembering that her own biological parents cruelly threw her by the bridge when she was sick at a young age, letting her fade away in the cold wind. If she hadn't met Zhao Yingong who saved her, her white bones would have been gnawed clean by some wild dog long ago. Therefore, she felt the same empathy for Huang *Shi* and her son's situation, and tears of sympathy flowed as she listened.

Zhao Hening was weeping when a handkerchief appeared in front of her. She took it to wipe her tears before seeing clearly that it was Zhang Jiayu's hand, feeling somewhat embarrassed.

Guan Zongbao also took a towel to wipe Huang *Shi*'s face. Huang *Shi* said with a hoarse voice, "I really don't want to live with him anymore. It's fine if I suffer myself, but look at Bao'er's face; the bruises and purple patches were all beaten by him. His leg was also bitten by him."

Saying this, she rolled up Guan Zongbao's trouser leg. A red and swollen teeth mark on the calf still had bloodstains, with a large piece of skin missing, looking quite gruesome.

"Little Brother, apply some medicine. It will be serious if infected." Zhao Hening frowned and asked Le Ziren to take out a small bottle of sulfanilamide powder to hand to Guan Zongbao. Although the pharmaceutical factory already had better silver sulfadiazine ointment, she didn't bring it this time.

Zhao Hening said again, "Auntie, rest assured. As long as you want a divorce, I will definitely help you."

"The Guan clan has many people and great power. No one has upheld justice for us mother and son for many years. Sigh, how to divorce, woo woo woo..."

Zhao Hening was somewhat indignant and said, "Can having many people block bullets? I want to see just how tyrannical this clan is."

Hearing the tragic experience cried out by Huang *Shi*, Zhang Jiayu was also itching with hatred towards this Guan Youde. Originally, he hesitated about intervening in others' domestic affairs, but Zhao Hening's duty-bound attitude provoked his emotions too. He said, "Auntie, rest assured. Upholding justice is a duty-bound matter for our generation. Even if it is your family affair, we will definitely seek justice from the Guan clan."

Zhao Hening, however, said, "What family affair? Once in court, it is official business. Isn't it just divorce? I've seen plenty in Lingao. One of our Chiefs was divorced by his wife."

"Sister, are you from Lingao?" Guan Zongbao asked.

"To tell you the truth, we are an inspection team following the Magistrate to the countryside. The current Magistrate Zhang is my teacher. This Lady is determined to manage Auntie's matter!" Zhao Hening said through gritted teeth.

Guan Zongbao and Huang *Shi* were both startled. They originally thought they were begging Officer Le beside them. Unexpectedly, this girl who looked frail was the main principal, and actually a student of the Magistrate.

Since ancient times, "Blue Sky Big Master" (*Qingtian Dalaye*) had always been more effective than "Royal Law." Huang *Shi* immediately pulled Guan Zongbao to kneel and cried, "Please, Blue Sky Big Master, make decisions for this common woman!"

Zhang Jiayu and Zhao Hening hurriedly helped the mother and son up. Zhao Hening said, "Auntie doesn't need to be so polite. Under the Senate's rule, everyone is equal. How about this: you go back first. Three days later, come to the police station in Jiujiang Market. I will send a clerk to write a divorce petition for you. This matter will be handed over to the Circuit Court for trial. Whether Guan Youde is sick or not has nothing to do with whether you can divorce."

Huang *Shi* and her son thanked them a thousand times and wanted to keep Zhao Hening's group for lunch. Zhao Hening declined with the excuse of going elsewhere for inspection. Seeing the mother and son were pitiful, she took out a "Half Yuan" silver coin from her pocket to give them before leaving.

On the way back, a grumbling sound came from Le Ziren's stomach. He mocked himself, "My stomach is disappointing, hahaha. Miss Zhao, let's eat some dry rations under that tree before going."

Sitting cross-legged in the shade of the tree, Le Ziren took out dry rations and water from his backpack to hand to the two. After this incident, Zhang Jiayu couldn't help admiring Zhao Hening somewhat, saying, "I didn't expect Hening, though a woman, to be a person zealous for public interests and justice."

Rather than saying Zhao Hening was touched and sad for Huang *Shi*'s experience, it was better to say Huang *Shi* evoked her sad past of being abandoned by birth parents. The taste was only known to herself and not enough to be told to outsiders. Zhao Hening didn't want to mention sad things, only saying, "Hmph, if I met such a man, if he dared to bully me, I would pop him with one shot."

Le Ziren shivered in fright, almost choking. Words spoken from this Miss Zhao's mouth, popping meant popping; better not provoke her.

Zhang Jiayu asked, "Hening, why not stay for a meal? Maybe we can inquire about more news."

Zhao Hening said, "Before leaving, the Chief instructed repeatedly not to eat strangers' food casually."

"Why is this? I thought the Chief instructed not to eat strangers' food fearing someone would poison us secretly. These mother and son don't look like people who would poison." Zhang Jiayu said.

Zhao Hening said, "The concern of preventing poisoning indeed has precedents. Previously, a work team in Lingao went to the countryside and was wiped out because of eating food poisoned by villagers. But on the other hand, we must also consider the safety of the food itself. Did you see hot water in their house?"

"Only well water, but what is the problem?" Zhang Jiayu didn't quite understand.

"Seems you need to make up lessons on parasites," Zhao Hening said. "All agricultural areas need to use fecal fertilizer. Human and livestock feces contain many roundworm and hookworm eggs. Water sources are easily contaminated. If drinking raw water, it is easy to catch parasites. By the way, did you notice Huang *Shi* and her son's complexions are not quite normal?"

"Face has vegetable color." Zhang Jiayu recalled for a while and answered. Bottom-layer common people starved one meal and ate one meal, generally malnourished, usually looking yellow-faced and unhealthy.

Zhao Hening shook her head and said, "There is a disease in Jiangnan and Zhejiang, called 'Mulberry Leaf Yellow' by folks. Those suffering from this disease have withered yellow skin color, fatigue and weakness, and edema of face and feet. When I was little, I thought this was a normal phenomenon for silkworm households. After arriving in Lingao, I learned in Teacher Zhang's biology class that this is a disease caused by parasites, called Hookworm Disease. Because it occurs frequently in silkworm and mulberry areas, it is commonly known as 'Mulberry Leaf Yellow.' Sufferers of this disease, in mild cases, have unbearable skin itching, dizziness and anemia, and occasional nausea. In severe cases, lower limbs or whole body edema, weak and feeble, gradually losing labor ability, so it is also called Lazy Yellow Disease. Pregnant women infected cause premature birth and stillbirth; children infected also affect development. This disease is also very popular in Guangzhou Prefecture."

"Actually so serious?" Zhang Jiayu was somewhat surprised. Although his family was poor, as a scholar, his time working in the fields was very little. After passing the Xiucai exam, he prepared for the imperial examination with full strength, knowing very little about the risks faced by working people. Thinking of his parents' hard work, he felt a few more points of guilt in his heart.

"What do you think? Otherwise, would Guan Zongbao, a young lad, plus Huang *Shi*, two people, be unable to beat his Dad, that sick jar?" Zhao Hening said.

"So it was vegetable chickens pecking each other." Le Ziren teased.

Zhang Jiayu sighed, "Bai Letian once wrote *Watching Wheat Reaping*: 'What merit do I have today, never serving agriculture and sericulture. Official salary three hundred *shi*, surplus grain at year's end. Thinking of this I feel ashamed privately, unable to forget all day.' In the past, I only knew world affairs but didn't see affairs before eyes. Lu Fangweng said 'Knowledge obtained on paper feels shallow finally; absolutely know this matter requires personal practice.' Only today did I have some realization. Ashamed, ashamed."

Hearing Zhang Jiayu say this, he was presumably a person with conscience too. Zhao Hening couldn't help increasing her good feelings by a few points, but said with her mouth, "Chiefs looking down on those sour scholars of the Ming Dynasty has reasons. Every one of them chants 'Zhi Hu Zhe Ye' in mouth, but actually four limbs are not diligent, five grains are not distinguished. Eating full all day but not thinking of people's suffering. Simply rice buckets, truly ashamed to face food."

"Hening, is there a method to eliminate parasites?" Zhang Jiayu asked.

Zhao Hening shook her head and said, "Currently no solution. Can only treat after infection. But most farmers, to save money, are unwilling to see doctors."

Even the cheapest medicine was still too expensive for many people in this space-time. Poor people getting sick could never count on medicine, relying entirely on "enduring."

"Sigh, long sigh to cover tears; mourning the hardships of people's lives!" Zhang Jiayu sighed.

"However, in the long run, it's not without a solution," Zhao Hening remembered words Zhang Xiao said during class before. "Parasitic diseases like roundworm and hookworm are mainly transmitted through fecal fertilizer. Eggs enter the soil with fecal fertilizer. This is also why feces must be retted to maturity before application; eggs will die in large numbers during the retting process. Just that many farmers, to save labor, either are unwilling to ret fertilizer or don't have enough time. So a large number of eggs exist naturally in the soil. As long as people contact this soil, they may be infected, unavoidable. To solve this kind of parasitic disease from the source, only by vigorously developing productive forces. When the output of chemical fertilizer is large enough and the price is low enough to completely replace fecal fertilizer, that will be the time when these diseases exit the historical stage."

"Productive forces again!" Zhang Jiayu was startled. The Senate's theory interlocked with reality so closely. No wonder they could sweep Two Guangs in less than ten years.

While many cadres were sent out to "collect wind" (inspect), Zhang Xiao wasn't idle either. Medicine and hygiene were his old profession. He first took Hou Qing to inspect the development of smallpox vaccination work in Jiujiang "Vaccination Bureau," then immediately let her lead a team to various places to sample and investigate parasite infection situations. Then he led Tian Liang to inspect local education situations.

Guangdong's epidemic problem had always been the issue the hygiene department cared about most. Locals were different from Hainan; population density was extremely high. Once an epidemic occurred, it would cause devastating consequences. The plague in Guangzhou gave the Senate a solid lesson. Now every county regarded "epidemic prevention and vaccination" as an important matter to grasp.
