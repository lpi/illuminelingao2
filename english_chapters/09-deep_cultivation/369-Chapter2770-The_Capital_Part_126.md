# Chapter 2770: The Capital (Part 126)

"But the Emperor..." Qian Taichong remembered the Emperor's instructions.

"The Grand Canal is currently frozen. Wait until the day spring warms and flowers bloom. There will surely be a definite conclusion on the matter of opening the port."

***

At the second drum of the night (around 9-11 PM), Chongzhen finished reviewing the memorials in his hand and flipped through the reports just sent by the Office of Transmission. There were more than ten memorials quoting disaster reports, but a rough scan showed no urgent military or national affairs. He breathed a slight sigh of relief in his heart.

He didn't know if his day and night prayers to the ancestral spirits these days had had an effect, or if it was some other reason. The "Three Great Worries" on the screen of the Palace of Heavenly Purity (Qianqing Gong)—the Eastern Barbarians, the Kun thieves, and the Roving Bandits—were all considered peaceful, and no more shocking bad news came to him.

Today he would rest earlier. Because his body was too weary, the Emperor didn't summon any concubines to attend to his sleep and went directly back to the Warm Pavilion to sleep.

In the night, he had a dream. In the dream, there was a monkey crying under a cliff. For some unknown reason, it attracted a group of monkeys to ask why. The crying monkey pointed up at the sun and moon in the sky, beating its chest in anger. The group of monkeys wanted to go up to the sky to touch the sun and moon but couldn't reach them. Then they saw the sun and moon in the water, so the group of monkeys took a boat to fish for the moon.

Just as they were busy fishing for the moon, suddenly another group of monkeys came to fish for the moon too. The first group of monkeys refused, and the three sides fought in a chaotic melee, beating each other inextricably. He saw this in his dream and laughed loudly, but unexpectedly attracted the anger of the group of monkeys, who pounced on him together. He hurriedly shouted for the left and right guards to protect the Emperor, but no one responded. Watching helplessly as he was forced under an old locust tree, suddenly a raft came on the lake surface, and yet another group of monkeys came to fish for the moon in the gap. The three groups of monkeys were making an awful racket when a Monkey King jumped out from the raft among the monkeys. Tall and mighty, he waved the Golden -Hooped Rod and beat the other two groups of monkeys until they squeaked and screamed. Suddenly, this Monkey King shouted at Chongzhen: "I am Sun Wukong! How dare a mere mortal laugh at me? Eat a blow from Old Sun's rod!" Chongzhen was suddenly awakened by the nightmare, frightened into a cold sweat, only to discover it was a dream. The sun and moon in this dreamscape, needless to ask, must refer to the Great Ming. Monkeys taking a boat to fish for the sun and moon must mean stealing my Great Ming's rivers and mountains. Truly ridiculous; the sun and moon travel in the sky, how can you monkeys dip your fingers in them? This group of monkeys is just wasting their mental and physical efforts in vain. Thinking like this, Chongzhen's mind calmed down slightly.

After using the morning meal, the imperial attendant eunuch sent up "Nanyang Fruits." In a jadeite dish lay yellow-orange, ring-shaped and round fruit flesh, appearing very bright and lovely in the gray, cold, and gloomy hall of this winter day.

They were called "Nanyang Fruits," but actually everyone knew they were bought from the Kun thieves. This kind of Nanyang rarity that no one recognized was packed in expensive glass bottles, filled with sweet juice. Transported thousands of miles from the south to the Capital, it still maintained the original fresh sweetness and crispness of the fruit after opening. Having a bite in the winter day was truly a supreme enjoyment in life.

Naturally, the expensive price was not something ordinary people could bear. This small dish of fruit, merely three or four slices, cost nearly ten taels of silver.

The Emperor had always felt such enjoyment was too extravagant and had intended to cut it out. So currently, the Nanyang fruits the Emperor enjoyed were all offered by Consort Tian's family—her family had the most Nanyang goods.

Seeing the Nanyang fruits made him think of the Kun thieves, but at this moment, the Emperor's hatred for the Kun thieves was much less. Firstly, the Kun thieves had too many useful things. Leaving aside the Nanyang fruits before him, governors of various places were petitioning the Imperial Court to allow the purchase of "Nanyang Guns and Cannons." Using Nanyang guns and cannons, the Dengzhou Army and Guangning Army had repeatedly frustrated the attacks of the Eastern Barbarians. Although there were no inspiring "Great Victories," at least it wasn't a constant stream of defeats, and they could even get ten or twenty heads of real Manchus.

If peace negotiations with the Kun thieves could really succeed, not only could the pressure on the southeast be alleviated, but perhaps more guns, cannons, and ammunition could be obtained from the Kun thieves. According to the "Know-Thief" officials, the Kun thieves didn't distinguish between right and wrong or enemy and friend; they would sell if given money.

After eating the fruit, the Emperor summoned the Grand Secretaries of the Grand Secretariat in the Wenhua Hall (Hall of Literary Brilliance) to discuss court politics.

The Grand Secretariat of the tenth year of Chongzhen was led by Wen Tiren as the Senior Grand Secretary. Cabinet ministers like Xue Guoguan, Liu Yuliang, and Zhang Zhifa were mostly his partisans. It could be called the Wen Cabinet.

This man, Wen Tiren, had an extremely bad reputation in history books, sparing no effort in pandering to the Emperor's wishes and excluding dissidents. But he had strong administrative ability, especially in practical matters like criminal justice and finance/grain. Many cabinet ministers could only sit and talk about the Dao, or even stare tongue-tied, not knowing what to say. He, however, could explain things step by step. He was an incorruptible official; even his political enemies couldn't find leverage in this regard. Being able to handle various tedious administrative affairs in a state of turmoil and internal and external troubles showed his administrative ability. Therefore, although the Chongzhen reign was known for having more than fifty prime ministers, Wen Tiren stayed in office the longest and was most trusted by the Emperor.

Of course, this trust was also due to another quality the current Emperor loved very much: "Shen Du" (Cautiousness when Alone/Self-discipline).

When Wen Tiren was in power, he could always ensure the Emperor believed he did "not form cliques." "Factional strife" was what the Emperor liked least. If any official was suspected of "forming a clique," it would inevitably arouse the Emperor's disgust or even dismissal. The Donglin Party went from "Many Upright Men in Court" in the early years of Chongzhen to being excluded from the core of power in just a few years, which had a huge relationship with this mindset of the Emperor.

However, in the court politics of the late Ming, if a cabinet minister had no faction, he couldn't even sit securely in his seat. Not only did Wen Tiren have partisans, but the entire Grand Secretariat was basically controlled by his partisans, yet the Emperor was completely unaware and still thought he was "Loyal in Isolation."

The noon sunlight rarely shone into the Wenhua Hall, projecting onto the coiling dragon pillars of the hall, making the golden-winged carved dragons on the pillars appear ready to spread their wings and fly.

The summons in winter were not arranged in the empty and tall main hall for discussion, but in the East Warm Pavilion.

Wen Tiren was the last of the cabinet ministers to arrive at the Warm Pavilion. his late arrival was not to show off his status as Senior Grand Secretary, but more to display his "Shen Du" attitude of not discussing privately with others.

There were generally six or seven cabinet ministers, but not all were present during a summons. However, since the Jiajing reign, the Senior Grand Secretary of the Grand Secretariat held the heaviest authority, and the power of "Piao Ni" (drafting rescripts) was basically controlled by him. As long as the Senior Grand Secretary was present, government affairs could be handled.

He came to the Warm Pavilion, exchanged greetings with the cabinet colleagues, then sat upright in the Warm Pavilion, closing his eyes and saying nothing.

Although the eunuchs were on duty outside, the Emperor knew every move they made in the Warm Pavilion, even clearly knowing what they said. Therefore, he simply kept his mouth shut. Firstly, to show he had no personal friendship with the cabinet colleagues; secondly, to avoid disaster issuing from the mouth by speaking some "inappropriate" words—back then, he had seized upon an unintentional remark by Zhou Yanru to drive him out of the Grand Secretariat; thirdly, to go over the content of today's summons in his belly once more.

What the Emperor would specifically discuss when summoning cabinet ministers wasn't fixed, but it was mostly recent important government affairs. Some, although accumulating from past years, would have signs of being brought up again beforehand. Drafts had to be prepared in advance. Once the Emperor consulted, there had to be a plan for handling it—and it had to conform to the Emperor's mind. This required the skill of figuring out the Emperor's thoughts.

If one spoke of the important government affairs of these few years, they were nothing more than the Three Great Bandits that the Emperor worried about most and the endless natural disasters. But these were not what Wen Tiren was concerned about. Although these matters were important, there were precedents from previous years to use. Following the rules to draft rescripts for handling would not lead to any mistakes. As for how the people below handled it, that was another matter.

What he was most concerned about right now was not military or national affairs, but the Restoration Society (Fushe).

The Donglin and the Restoration Society were Wen Tiren's deadly enemies. Especially after he framed Qian Longxi and ousted Qian Qianyi and Zhou Yanru, he was like fire and water with the Donglin and the Restoration Society.

Since last year, he had received news that the Restoration Society was secretly maneuvering to let Zhou Yanru come out of retirement and enter the Grand Secretariat.

This man, Zhou Yanru, was his ally back then. The two partnered together to bring down Qian Qianyi. It was only later, fighting for the position of Senior Grand Secretary, that they turned against each other and became enemies. Now that he wanted to return with the help of the Donglin and Restoration Society forces, it was Wen Tiren's biggest crisis at the moment.

Once this person returned to the court and entered the Grand Secretariat, a strong anti-Wen group would quickly condense within the court. Wen Tiren knew deeply that he had offended many people in the court over these years. As long as someone took the lead, people would inevitably rise up and attack him in swarms. Moreover, standing behind him were the two major political forces in the country.

Zhou Yanru was not a member of the Donglin Party, but his origins with the Donglin Party were very deep; he was a student of Ye Xianggao, the Donglin Party leader. Although he had offended the Donglin because of Qian Qianyi, after he entered the Grand Secretariat to preside over the government, he stopped Chongzhen from employing Wang Zhichen and others implicated in the Eunuch Party Rebellion Case, and used the opportunity of presiding over the metropolitan examination to vigorously promote members of the Donglin Party and the Restoration Society—including Zhang Pu, the "Hierarch that Reaches Heaven" of the "Two Zhangs of Loudong."

Zhou Yanru, who seemed to be living a secluded life in the landscape after losing power and returning home, was actually even closer to the Donglin Party and the Restoration Society. This was the reason why the Donglin Party and the Restoration Society strongly promoted Zhou Yanru's return because although Zhou Yanru was not Donglin, he was better than Donglin. Moreover, the fact that he had impeached important Donglin Party members Qian Qianyi and Qian Longxi was more deceptive and could easily gain Chongzhen's trust.

"This 'Hierarch that Reaches Heaven' truly has powerful means!" Wen Tiren thought to himself. He actually didn't care too much about the Donglin Party, because after several major events in the early years of Chongzhen, especially the Yuan Chonghuan incident, the Emperor was very taboo about "forming cliques" and was very wary of the Donglin Party people, consciously excluding them from entering the core of power. However, the "Restoration Society," known as the "Little Donglin," gradually became a climate due to Zhou Yanru's deliberate promotion during his few years in power. Now, it was like a powerful force in the court. Although they didn't have a spokesperson in the center yet, their influence had spread all over the Capital and the localities.

Zhang Pu planning Zhou Yanru's return had self-evident ambition. Moreover, with him threading the needle, even Qian Qianyi, whom Zhou Yanru had offended back then, had now joined this plan for a comeback. Naturally, this support was not without a price; it was very likely that Zhou Yanru had already promised that once he returned, he would help him return to the court—maybe even enter the Grand Secretariat for a second time.

Compared to the somewhat notorious Zhou Yanru, Qian Qianyi's threat was much greater. His reputation was much better than Zhou Yanru's; he was also a master of the literary world and one of the Donglin leaders. Once he returned, he would inevitably unite with Zhou Yanru to deal with him. After all, he had attempted to put him to death back then...
