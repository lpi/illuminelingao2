# Chapter 2463 - Fabric Store

Then he thought of Li Yao'er and his Second Uncle. Elder Li trusted him very much and entrusted him with heavy responsibilities, but Second Uncle made trouble from within, constraining him at every turn. Yet Chief Li trusted him very much... Sigh!

Chen Lin's state of mind at this moment was very complicated. Ambition and worry about the future were interwoven, plucking at the sentimental heart of a young man from time to time.

The sun was gradually slanting west. Chen Lin suddenly remembered there was a banquet at six o'clock in the evening. He should return to the hotel early to meet up with his uncle and sister.

He hurriedly got up, walked out of the room, and came to the lobby. The reception waiter was busy working and hurried out to greet him when he saw him.

"Shopkeeper, what time is it now?"

"Guest, that over there is the clock," the waiter pointed to a corner, "Do you know how to read a clock? Do you need this lowly one to explain?"

"No need, no need." He had seen clocks and watches in Guangzhou, whether Western or Australian; they were much the same. Looking towards the corner, sure enough, there was a large clock with a pendulum, teak case, and mother-of-pearl inlay. The hands had just passed half past four.

"How long does it take to get to Longhao Bay Hotel from here?"

"If you take a rickshaw, just over ten minutes..." the waiter said, "Do you want this lowly one to call one for you?"

Chen Lin hesitated. It was still a bit early to go over now. It was inconvenient to sit for long in his sister's room, and also inconvenient at his uncle's place. If he sat in the lobby, seeing men and women going in and out would feel awkward...

The waiter had the most exquisite mind. Seeing his appearance, he guessed somewhat and immediately suggested: "Guest, if you still have ample time, why not walk from here to Longhao Bay Hotel? The whole journey is just half an hour. Is it your first time locally? Just right to see the street scene and market appearance of Bopu."

"Good is good, but I don't know the way."

"It doesn't matter." The waiter immediately pulled a piece of paper from the rack beside him, "This is a map. I'll mark the route clearly for you, and you'll naturally understand."

Chen Lin took the map he marked. The map was not big and printed very simply, but street names, shops, restaurants, stations, wharves... everything was marked clearly.

"Guest, pay attention, this map is North up, South down, West left, East right. Don't get it upside down."

"Thank you, little brother, for reminding me." Chen Lin tucked the map into his bosom. Just as he was about to come out of the hotel, he suddenly remembered something and asked the waiter: "Where has the most varieties of silk and cloth here?"

"If speaking of the most varieties and most complete goods, naturally it is the Cooperative General Society Mall in East Gate Market. However, there is also a Friendship Department Store here in Bopu, where goods are also very complete. It also has attached currency exchange and consignment offices, specially convenient for traveling merchants to purchase."

Chen Lin thought this was a good place! Might as well go to this Friendship Department Store to have a look first.

Leaving the hotel, he thought about when they were playing in Great World before; people said the most prosperous place in Lingao was East Gate Market. However, East Gate Market was still far from here; he could go later. Fortunately, he heard people say Bopu's prosperity was not inferior. Why not stroll around Bopu Town first to experience the local folk customs and business situation along the way? Father said, although they only wove silk, they must also understand the market demand clearly.

"Human nature's likes and dislikes are most fickle, especially women's clothing and accessories. The height of hair buns, the size of sleeves, and even texture, pattern, and color, must change every few years. If one detects it at the beginning of the change, one can make materials that sell big."

He always kept these words in his heart, but mastering the "fashion code" was not an easy thing. Not only did one have to understand the market prices of various materials, but one also had to grasp women's preferences. After Chen Lin became an adult, his father also took him to brothels for entertainment. On one hand, it was to socialize with customers; on the other hand, it was also to master fashion trends.

"The attire and hair accessories of prostitutes in brothels change fastest. Whatever novel styles there are, they are mostly the ones wearing them."

Now Guangdong and Guangxi were the Australians' world. The Australians didn't ask everyone to "shave hair and change clothes," but the style of "short clothes and short hair," with more and more naturalized citizens in Guangzhou, would become popular sooner or later. "King Chu loved slender waists; many starved to death in the palace." The people would naturally follow and imitate the preferences of the Senate.

He walked along the streets and lanes. These were back streets and alleys, mostly backyards of residents and shops, very quiet. The streets and houses were tidy. Old people were busy with housework in front of doors, and children played and fought. A scene of peaceful years. Chen Lin thought of his own Nansha, and couldn't help sighing secretly in his heart: being able to enjoy peaceful years was truly a great blessing!

According to the route on the map, he turned a corner, came out from a side alley, and arrived at the main road. The flow of people in front of him instantly increased a lot. Not only were pedestrians bustling, but there were also those carrying loads on poles, carrying baskets on backs, pushing wheelbarrows... Public carriages and freight trains moved slowly forward. Drivers stepped on bells from time to time to remind pedestrians not to intrude onto the main road and block the way.

The town streets here were not as wide as the Seaside Avenue, so there were no street trees, but the houses on both sides were arcades (*Qilou*). Pedestrians walking under them were shaded from the sun and rain, very convenient.

Chen Lin looked at the outer walls of the houses. The lime was still new; they should haven been built in recent years. Thinking that the Australians had landed for less than ten years, they actually managed this unknown border land so impressively. No wonder the crowd of big households in Guangzhou rushed to join in the fun.

He walked along the street. There were many shops here. Some were traditional open fronts, and some only opened a small door but were equipped with large glass windows. Chen Lin didn't know this was called a show window, but he was quickly captured by its unique decorative charm.

"Displaying goods in this way makes people want to buy upon seeing them. The Australians' art of selling goods is truly formidable!"

Besides those common in Guangzhou, there were many he had never heard of—even in the "Australians' Window," the Great World, he hadn't seen them. Sometimes he would be very confused about what business this shop was doing. When he knew it was doing a certain business, he often wondered puzzledly: *This can also be done as a business?!*

Confusion aside, regardless of size, the decoration and display of shops here had their own merits, but all were tidy and orderly, looking comfortable. Completely different from the crowded and messy image of traditional shops in Guangzhou City.

However, although there were many shops, there were rarely silk shops or cotton cloth shops selling fabric. He walked all the way and actually didn't see many. He went into the few limited ones to check the goods one by one. Among them were various silks transported from the mainland, as well as various silks from Japan, Korea, and Nanyang that he had seen in Guangzhou. There were many varieties, but nothing extraordinary. When asked if there was Australian silk, shop assistants all said there was no production. It was not until he came to a large shop "Ruihexiang" specializing in various silk, cloth, woolen, and other fabrics that he heard the assistant say that Australians indeed raised silkworms, reeled silk, and wove silk, but extremely few goods flowed into the market.

"...If the guest really wants Australian silk and silk fabric, you can only go to Shop No. 82 in East Gate Market. There are clothes and accessories made of Australian silk—the material and texture are indeed different from those produced elsewhere. It is just that the price is extremely expensive, not something ordinary people can ask for."

As for cloth, the most staple goods were "Songjiang Cloth" produced on the mainland, with complete categories and low prices; next were various imported cloths. The shop assistant introduced attentively. Among them were Nanyang cloth from Nanyang, as well as Indian cloth and Western cloth. Colors, patterns, and textures were all different. Even Chen Lin was dazzled, especially by the bleached fine linen imported from Holland, with fine texture and pure white color. The shop assistant said this Dutch linen was mostly used to make shirts worn next to the skin. Asking the price, it wasn't expensive either, about the same as Songjiang Cloth.

"Such good cloth only sells for this price; then who is this Songjiang Cloth sold to?"

"Although this Dutch fine linen is good, it is not durable. Laborers and farmers who do hard work will absolutely not buy it."

"Is there locally produced cloth here? Mm, Australian cloth?"

"There is some," the shop assistant said, "But nothing outstanding. Does the guest want..."

Chen Lin hurriedly said: "Want, want!"

The shop assistant fetched a few bolts (cloth lengths) in a while and unfolded them on the counter.

At first glance, there was indeed nothing special, only the color was much brighter than other cloths. However, the difference was known as soon as it was twisted in hand.

"What smooth yarn!" He exclaimed unwittingly.

The shop assistant was startled and said: "Is the guest also in this trade?"

"Correct." Chen Lin nodded, "My family opened a small weaving workshop."

"No wonder the guest looked like an insider as soon as you handled it!" The shop assistant said, "This Australian cotton yarn is indeed the best."

Just as the quality of silk depended largely on the quality of raw silk, the quality of cotton cloth was determined by cotton yarn. Turning cotton into cotton yarn also required passing through more than ten processes. In the era without machines, these processes all relied on handwork. Spinning was mostly a manual sideline for rural women. Therefore, the quality of yarn was hard to guarantee, often uneven in thickness, and the surface was relatively rough. The woven cloth was also relatively rough.

But the cloth Chen Lin handled just now had a smooth and fine texture. The cloth body was very thin, yet it didn't wrinkle when rubbed by hand. Very crisp. Very much like the Tussah silk of Shandong. To weave such cloth with cotton, besides sparing no labor and material and having skilled craftsmen, one must have extremely good yarn quality.

He immediately bought four bolts (cloth lengths) (the size of one bolt was enough to make a set of clothes). He hadn't seen this kind of fabric in Guangzhou yet; obviously, it was just woven by Australians. Taking it back, whether for his sister's use or as a gift, was excellent.

The price was slightly expensive, but it didn't exceed his budget. He paid the money and told the address of Jasmine Hotel; naturally, a helper would deliver it to the door.

Having done his business, the shop assistant was quite excited and said again: "Speaking of Australian cloth, there is another benefit. Also a great use."

"What is it?"

"Guest, please look here." The shop assistant led him to the shelves behind, on which long scrolls were leaned. The width of the cloth made him dumbfounded.
