# Chapter 2722: The Capital (Part 74)

Based on Li Rufeng's understanding of officials and nobles, the likelihood of them taking a coastal liner was very small. After all, the sea was too rough and carried too many unknown dangers for them. The steady, stable inland river boats were the first choice.

Speculating on his purpose, there were only two possibilities: First, he planned to travel somewhere within the year; Second, he was prepared to flee at any moment.

Nowadays, the Escort Bureau's top business was guarding shops and residences. They understood the thinking of officials and nobles all too well. These Qiwei cabin reservations were mostly purchased by merchants who traveled frequently. Traveling by boat required no ticket purchase—just go directly to the wharf to exchange the slip for boarding. If same-day travel wasn't possible, Qiwei would arrange food and lodging.

Officials and nobles weren't in a hurry. They could plan anything months in advance, usually buying boat tickets just before departure and traveling on schedule.

It seemed the second possibility was most likely.

However, whether Eunuch Yang himself or Yang Tianliang, though they couldn't call the shots in the palace, they lived comfortably enough, earning tens of thousands of taels a year. Though the Great Ming was tottering, it wouldn't necessarily collapse in the near term. Why would he get a boat ticket to prepare for flight?

Unless...

Li Rufeng's eyes gleamed. He felt those days of gloom were finally showing a crack. He saw sunlight.

He suddenly asked, "Fifth Master Huang! You just said there's been a rift between Eunuch Yang and his disciple. What's their relationship like now?"

Huang Qi smiled slyly. "It's hard to explain in a few words."

"What do you mean by that?"

"Back when I served in the Eastern Depot, under orders from the Supervising Director, I once watched what these great eunuchs did outside the palace. I know a thing or two about this master-disciple pair." He smacked his lips.

Li Rufeng said, "Someone! Refill Fifth Master Huang's tea!"

A cup of richly fragrant tea was brought. Huang Qi sniffed and said, "What fragrance! The finest jasmine tea supplied to the imperial presence! Chief Escort Li has a generous hand!"

After comfortably finishing a cup of tea, Huang Qi finally spoke of Eunuch Yang and his son's past.

Eunuch Yang himself was a disciple of a powerful eunuch from the Wanli reign, so during the Wanli era, he did very well in the palace. Yang Tianliang entered the palace in late Wanli and also benefited somewhat from his godfather's standing. However, after the "Nine Thousand Years" rose to power, Eunuch Yang's position became precarious. Only through desperate flattery and heavy bribes did he barely hold onto his position, though he was utterly unsuccessful in the palace and only got idle, cold positions.

Yang Tianliang naturally suffered from his master's troubles and couldn't make anything of himself in the palace either.

"...He was still young then and didn't dare show resentment in front of his master. Besides, he knew that once he acknowledged Eunuch Yang as his godfather, they were bound together in life and death. Even if he wanted to switch allegiances, no one else would take him. So father and son were united, enduring hardships in the palace, hoping for a turnaround..."

Eunuch Yang fawned over and attached himself to the Eunuch Faction by every means, hoping to join their ranks. But his own master had clashed with the Nine Thousand Years in the past, so despite spending much silver, he could only maintain his safety. Watching his godfather's savings dwindle, Yang Tianliang began to disagree.

"...He told Eunuch Yang that rather than spending silver this way without seeing any results, they might as well temporarily leave the palace and lie low. Whatever happened to the court later, at least with silver in hand, they could always establish themselves."

"That advice made sense."

"Hehe, from our perspective, there's nothing wrong with it. But Eunuch Yang was already old. Old people are most suspicious about money. Little Eunuch Yang's words immediately aroused his suspicions. Though he said nothing, from then on there was a gap between them."

Yang Tianliang wasn't a fool either. Once he saw his master suspected him, he began making his own plans, privately recruiting people and conducting business outside. Originally, he merely skimmed off the top as middleman; from then on, he had thoughts of starting his own operation.

"...Master Li probably knows about the incident when the Nine Thousand Years was in power, when local officials competed to build living shrines for him."

"Yes, I've heard of it."

"To curry favor, Eunuch Yang specifically sent Yang Tianliang to Guangzhou to handle this matter. Later, for some reason, the project suddenly stopped without completion. But the wealthy merchant Gao family under his patronage in Guangzhou reportedly had already contributed five thousand taels of silver and many Australian treasures. After returning to the capital, Yang Tianliang handed over the Australian goods, saying that since the living shrine was canceled, the silver was returned to Gao Ju. But Eunuch Yang didn't believe it..."

"That's easy to verify—just write to Gao Ju and ask."

"Hehe, whether he wrote that letter, whether the silver was returned—only they themselves know. But from that time on, the relationship between master and disciple grew even more distant. Now, it's probably just surface harmony: Eunuch Yang relies on this disciple to care for him in old age; the disciple relies on his master's status to throw his weight around and make money. That's the only reason they haven't broken openly."

"So that's how it is. Fifth Master Huang is truly an expert!" Li Rufeng gave a thumbs up. "Without you, we wouldn't know a thing about the secrets of palace eunuchs..."

"You flatter me." Fifth Master Huang laughed and said modestly. "People outside the palace see those inside as if they were people in heaven. In reality, they're just people too. Whether it's the Emperor, the Empress, palace maids, or eunuchs, none can escape the four words 'human nature and worldly affairs.'"

"Well said, Fifth Master." Li Rufeng thought: By this logic, the likelihood that Little Eunuch Yang would take such a risk for this large sum of silver was very high. From all the leads gathered, he was indeed the most suspicious person.

He suddenly remembered that Min Zhanlian's report had mentioned a Eunuch Cao—Liu Xiaobian's job at Nanyuan was arranged by Eunuch Cao. After starting the job, Liu Xiaobian had attached himself to some "benefactor." There might really be a connection here. He asked, "Do you know Third Master Qin of the outer city?"

"I do!" Huang Qi nodded. "The sitting tiger of the South City."

"Do you know he has an old acquaintance who also serves in the palace, surnamed Cao?"

"Yes. Eunuch Cao is from Wei County in Daming Prefecture. But he's not exactly an old acquaintance of Third Master Qin. I've heard they only became close these past two years. Probably because of their work."

Huang Qi said Eunuch Cao actually wasn't doing well in the palace. He was nearly forty before he got the position of Managing Eunuch at Nanyuan. Since he was Nanyuan's managing eunuch, he had to build good relationships with local powers. Probably around that time, through some connection, he linked up with Third Master Qin.

Li Rufeng thought: No wonder Liu Xiaobian's job was arranged by Eunuch Cao—there was this layer of connection.

"Speaking of which, a few days ago Third Master Qin's cousin died. That's also suspicious!" Huang Qi added.

"Oh? How suspicious?" Li Rufeng had also wanted to ask about this. Since Huang Qi brought it up himself, he obviously knew something.

Huang Qi smiled. "If you weren't Master Li, I'd have to squeeze this 'Australian toothpaste' a bit. But since it's you, I'll tell you plainly. Master Li probably knows that this Second Master Qin wasn't exactly clean himself."

"I know. He traded with Mongols beyond the Western Pass. No one in that line is clean."

"Master Li, you only know half of it. Second Master Qin had backers."

"Oh? Whose doorstep did he belong to?"

"He'd never say whose doorstep, but the person who works for that household is an old acquaintance of mine. When I served in the Eastern Depot, he was in the Brocade Guard. After the Nine Thousand Years fell, he and I both abandoned our posts and fled..."

Li Rufeng's face remained calm, but in his heart the answer was about to burst out. He controlled himself and asked:

"Who is this person?"

"His official name is Liu Sha. After fleeing the capital, he wandered destitute, making a living as a fortune-teller. I saw him in Guangzhou back then too. Later, he attached himself to some wealthy household, dressed splendidly..." Huang Qi's words carried a hint of envy. "He even started acting like a gentleman."

Li Rufeng was ecstatic inside. He hadn't held great expectations for the information Huang Qi could provide. He hadn't expected that not only had he uncovered Yang Tianliang as the prime suspect, but he had also connected all the fragmented leads that Min Zhanlian and the others had gathered!

Whether Yang Tianliang or Liu Sha, both had major connections to Leng Ningyun's case! If they had been completely in the dark a few days ago, now they had clear targets!

"Fifth Master Huang is in his prime. Perhaps there's good fortune ahead for you yet." Li Rufeng smiled. "Please don't hold back. Tell me—how is it suspicious?"

"Hehe, you've drawn so much out of me—you'll have to pay for it all later." Huang Qi laughed, then said seriously, "Think about it, Master Li. This Second Master Qin had backing, and his cousin is the outer city's sitting tiger. What ordinary person would dare provoke such a figure? Yet now he's been killed, his tongue cut out, and dumped in the moat like a lotus flower. Isn't that suspicious?"

"You slippery fellow—you've said nothing!"

"What do you mean, nothing?" Huang Qi protested. "Since Second Master Qin isn't someone ordinary people would dare touch, the person who killed him must be a big shot in the capital—otherwise why would Third Master Qin, the resounding tyrant of the outer city, wail a few times at his brother's memorial and then hide away like a turtle with its head retracted?"

"Fifth Master, there's no shortage of big shots in the capital. What you've said is the same as saying nothing!"

Huang Qi stared at Li Rufeng for a moment, then suddenly laughed. "Master Li, oh Master Li. You're a figure in the *Jianghu*. How did your mind suddenly get muddled? What does cutting out a tongue mean?"

"Obviously, someone thought he talked too much."

"Talked too much about what?"

"How would I know!"

"Master Li, don't you think this is 'cleaning house'?"

Li Rufeng's eyelid twitched! What Huang Qi said did make sense. Cutting out the tongue and dumping him in the moat was obviously a warning to certain people. These people likely had connections to Second Master Qin, and Second Master Qin had said something he shouldn't have.

But this explanation was somewhat forced. Li Rufeng knew that men like Huang Qi liked to make shocking statements to inflate the value of their intelligence. So he deliberately asked, "If so, who is doing this 'house cleaning'?"

"Naturally, his patron." Huang Qi's eyes gleamed. "Don't ask me why. I don't know either. It's just a feeling."
