# Chapter 2501: Burning the Tower (14)

Sun Gang said, "What Li Jian? He is a Kun thief spy. I saw him leading Kun soldiers to make arrests in Guangzhou."

Xu Tong's expression changed slightly. He rarely took action personally during his activities in Guangzhou. He hadn't expected to be bumped into by this person!

Li Baiqing immediately said, "What proof do you have? Are you just speaking empty words? If you want to pick a quarrel, just say so. You, Sun Gang, rely on the power of Pockmarked Chen of the One Universe Primordial Chaos Dao in the Seven Upper Villages. On ordinary days, you oppress us Six Lower Villages, pushing us down on irrigation water and tax payments. Now you're making trouble at the banquet. Do you really take the thousand-plus able-bodied men of our Six Lower Villages as easy to bully?"

Hearing this, Xu Tong immediately understood that Li Baiqing wanted to muddy the waters. Regardless of whether Sun Gang had truly recognized him, this matter couldn't be cleared up. The more he explained, the more passive he would become. It was better to shift the focus, seize the initiative, and drag more people into the water. So he also immediately said loudly, "This humble person was originally in the Green Dragon Society in Jiangnan. I just got into a lawsuit and offended someone powerful, so I helplessly sought shelter in this treasured land. I really don't know the grievances here. I ask Hero Sun not to indiscriminately implicate me. If Hero Sun really has some old grudge with my Li family of Old Li Village, then bring it out with open bright swords and spears. I, Li, will naturally keep you company to the end. There's no need to use such dirty means." After speaking, he winked at Li Baiqing.

Li Baiqing understood and immediately continued loudly, "Sun Gang, you are biting randomly here. Could it be that you were incited by someone? Leader Liao just rebelled against the society, and not even the time for a meal has passed before you jump out to point fingers randomly. Where do so many internal thieves come from? Or are you saying that everyone sitting here is an internal thief? What, do you want to eat everything clean and leave no path for others to live?"

Hearing these words, the faces of Yang Tiezhou of the Eight Immortals Society and Ge Yaoxian of the Yellow Tassel Society sitting nearby couldn't help but change abruptly, looking around nervously. Others who were not direct descendants of the Daoist Spirit Society also whispered and discussed among themselves.

Sun Gang's face was ashen, and he said furiously, "Li Baiqing, you old man are the most gutless here. You never dare to fight the Kun thieves head-on vigorously, only shrinking in the back, and you still have the face to shout."

Li Baiqing snorted coldly. "Naturally, I can't compare to Hero Sun Gang. On that day, you led troops to fight fiercely with the Kun thieves, but before you finished a shit, you threw away your pole (ran away)."

Sun Gang said angrily, "I fought with open bright swords and spears against the Kun thieves! I still have scars left by the Kun thieves' bayonets on my body!"

Li Baiqing nodded. "Indeed. Only this scar is not on your chest but left on your buttocks. Presumably, Brother Sun's martial arts are high and strong, and his Iron Buttocks Kung Fu is practiced to perfection, facing the enemy with his back, entering the bare blade with an empty buttock when facing the enemy."

Sun Gang flew into a rage from shame, cursing about ancestors and grandsons, having long forgotten his original intention. He came up wanting to tear into and fight Li Baiqing.

With the quarreling, the crowd gathered together, each standing up for the person they favored, noisily pushing and shoving each other. Amidst the chaos and noise, Xue Tu led a group of people and separated the crowd, striding in. Seeing him, everyone bowed and saluted. Xue Tu asked the reason and couldn't help frowning, glancing at Pockmarked Chen. Pockmarked Chen secretly blamed Sun Gang for being meddlesome and asked, "Are you certain?" Seeing that the matter had blown up, Sun Gang had neither clear proof nor a clue. Originally, he was certain in his heart, but at this moment, he couldn't help but be somewhat vague. He secretly regretted his recklessness. Just now, in a moment of excitement thinking about establishing a great merit, he hadn't expected to create a deadlock. He could only say, "He looks extremely like him." Pockmarked Chen pressed, "Is he extremely like him, or is it him?" Sun Gang smacked his lips and said, "Extremely like."

Xue Tu felt irritable. If it really was a spy, he naturally couldn't let him off lightly. But if this situation truly created a second rebellion against the society, the non-direct descendants of the Daoist Spirit Society would all feel insecure, and the hearts that had just been gathered would instantly scatter. He couldn't help but hesitate.

While he was in a dilemma, Wooden Stone Daoist walked over slowly and said, "I just heard Brother Li say you were previously in the Green Dragon Society in Jiangnan?" After speaking, he suddenly coiled his left hand over his right, thumbs together, forming a Coiling Dragon Button knot. This was the starting gesture for checking one's background in the Green Dragon Society. Then he added, "Who comes?"

Seeing this, Xu Tong immediately crossed his left and right hands, forming a Probing Dragon Hand in front of his right chest. His right palm faced forward, his left hand faced backward, and the upper edge of his left palm pressed on the third knuckle of his right middle finger. The higher the knuckle pressed, the higher the status. Pressing one knuckle meant higher than the other party; two meant equality; three meant admitting to being a low-level member of the society, or it could be understood as modesty, admitting to being one level lower than the other party. He said loudly, "Mountain connects to mountain, ridge connects to ridge, a dragon's shadow hides in a pool of cold water. Younger brother is untalented, a Dragon-steed Armored Warrior under the Green Dragon seat."

Wooden Stone Daoist nodded and said, "Do you have martial arts?"

Xu Tong said, "I am proficient in all eighteen types of martial arts. A strong man wins a hundred battles with martial arts; swords, spears, swords, and halberds show their power. Civil virtue and martial brilliance have much strategy, supporting the Sage Lord to sit in the Dragon Court."

Wooden Stone Daoist asked again, "Do you have loyalty and righteousness?"

Xu Tong said, "Loyal liver and righteous gall, red blood always red. A journey of ten thousand *li* penetrates the Jade Pass; the constellations of the nine heavens descend to the mortal world. The loyal and good can subdue an army of thousands; the treacherous and sycophantic henceforth find it hard to keep their lives."

Wooden Stone Daoist asked again, "I wonder what matter brings this brother here?"

Xu Tong said, "Younger brother was reckless and was injured by outsiders. I ask all senior brothers to raise an arm high and shelter me under your wings, planting a peach and plum hero tree to gather heroes from the four seas. Younger brother has just arrived; my etiquette is incomplete, my clothes and cap are incorrect, my path is unclear, and I do not know everyone fully. I hope all the elders and young ones will show magnanimity and forgiveness. Here I offer a gold card and silver calling card to present a hall full of superior clothing for younger brother." After speaking, he tapped the ground with one knee, took out his identity calling card from his bosom—said to be gold and silver, but actually just two ordinary pieces of paper—and presented them to Wooden Stone Daoist with both hands.

Wooden Stone Daoist took it, looked at it carefully for a while, his expression unchanged, and only asked again, "Peach blossoms in the full garden open on the same tree; a string of river water gathers worthy talents. I wonder which road this brother walks?"

Xu Tong said, "The dry road is walkable; the water road is also walkable."

Wooden Stone Daoist said, "How is the dry road? How is the water road?"

Xu Tong said, "Vast dust and sand, no mountains seen; seething water mist, no rivers seen."

Wooden Stone Daoist said, "The Green Dragon swings its tail without saying its surname; the Green Dragon hits its back without speaking its name. What is Brother's honorable surname and great name? How many high mountains have you climbed? How many gates have you hung the gold medal on? Where does a bright road lead?"

Xu Tong said, "Indebted to the society's cultivation, my humble place is the East Pavilion of the Green Dragon Society. Younger brother is Li Jian, hanging two bronze medals at the mountain gate. My master's gate leads from Tong Jiong of the Suppressing River Tide. When traveling outside, a fallen phoenix rests on a parasol tree; a swimming dragon coils on a sea-spanning beam. I hope brothers of all families will look after me."

Hearing this, Wooden Stone Daoist looked at the card in his hand again, staring at Xu Tong's eyes with a burning gaze. Xu Tong did not dodge but faced him calmly. The two looked at each other for a moment. Wooden Stone Daoist suddenly laughed loudly and said, "The card is real, and the slang is correct. He really is a disciple of the society. This poor Daoist spent a long time in Jiangnan and had diverse friendships with people from the Green Dragon Society, which is why I know these slang terms. No need to ask further. Brothers of each family, disperse."

After he spoke, everyone let out a sigh of relief. As they were about to disperse, Xu Tong slowly stood up from the ground and said to Sun Gang, "Is Brother Sun leaving just like this?"

Sun Gang was just about to return to his seat. Hearing the call, he turned his head, stiffened his neck, and said viciously, "What?"

Xu Tong said, "My humble face isn't worth anything. I, this kid, can endure the staining of my innocence. But Brother Sun's words just now insulted my cousin-uncle and ancestors. Although I am unfilial, I cannot let my elders and ancestors be humiliated in public."

Sun Gang sneered, "What do you intend to do?"

Xu Tong said, "Two options, Brother Sun chooses. First, pour a bowl of wine, apologize to my cousin-uncle, and toast me a bowl as an apology to my ancestors. Second, wild grass isn't neat if not trimmed; the dock isn't flat if not stepped on. For those who run in the *jianghu*, reason is spoken with fists."

After speaking, he made a circle bow to the surroundings and said, "This is a private grudge and does not involve gang rules. Let's sign a life-and-death contract and fight. If Brother Sun is afraid, he only needs to say one sentence, 'I, Sun Gang, submit.' I won't pursue it deeply. Consider Brother Sun having apologized, and we'll turn over this page."

Sun Gang had a reckless and explosive temper; how could he endure such goading? He immediately threw a wine bowl over and shouted violently, "Apologize to your ancestors! We'll just see who wins or loses with fists." Xu Tong tilted his head, and the wine bowl shattered on the ground with a *crash*. Seeing the excitement, the crowd immediately made a noise. Xue Tu intended to stop it, but the society had a custom of settling private grudges with duels, and the surrounding crowd was jeering. While he hesitated slightly, Ge Yaoxian of the Yellow Tassel Society went down to the field. He was resentful about his society being merged today and intended to fan the flames and stir up trouble to vent the evil fire in his chest. So he said clearly, "Since it is so, I will be a witness. Bring paper and brush. Let the two brothers establish a contract."

Immediately, a small minion presented brush and ink. Ge Yaoxian held the brush, wrote two life-and-death contracts, and each pressed their handprints. Tables and chairs were cleared away, leaving an empty space. The two stood on the left and right. Ge Yaoxian asked Xu Tong in a low voice, "I wonder which sect and school this brother belongs to?"

Xu Tong was stunned. He practiced the comprehensive fighting techniques taught by the Senate, integrating boxing punches, Muay Thai knees and elbows, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, wrestling throws, and Karate kicks. Where would there be any sect? In a hurry, he remembered an internal high-confidentiality special issue of an Australian illustrated book and said casually, "This humble one is originally from Chongming. What I learned is the Fist of the North Star. My single given name is Jian, and I rank second in my family. People call me Kenshiro (Jian Erlang). Just say it like that."

Ge Yaoxian nodded and chanted loudly, "Today, Kenshiro of the Fist of the North Star and Sun Gang of the Wen Family Seventy-Two Rows of Fists will compete in martial arts on the spot to resolve enmity. Life and death are their own responsibility; each rests their fate with Heaven."

A smile flashed across the corner of Xu Tong's mouth. This martial arts competition would inevitably cause a subtle rift between the two forces in the society. Regardless of victory or defeat, he was the winner.

Xu Tong gently twisted his neck and moved his wrists. His cervical vertebrae and joints made light *crack* sounds. Today, everyone would remember his fists.

Yun Ting hid his figure under the eaves, quietly watching everything in the field. Wooden Stone Daoist walked slowly to his side and whispered, "How is it?"

Yun Ting said indifferently, "Sun Gang can't win."

Wooden Stone Daoist said "Oh" and asked, "Why?"

Yun Ting paused for a moment and did not answer. Instead, he changed the subject and said, "What does the Daoist think?"

Wooden Stone Daoist pondered for a moment and said, "This person's calling card is real, and he knows the secret language of the society. He should be a fellow traveler. Looking at his knotted muscles, he also looks like a martial artist. He looks like someone who runs in the *jianghu*. But outsiders... one can never fully figure out their background."
