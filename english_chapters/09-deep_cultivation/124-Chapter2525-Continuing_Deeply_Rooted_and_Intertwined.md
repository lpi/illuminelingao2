# Chapter 2525: Continuing Deeply Rooted and Intertwined

"Another person neglected by everyone is Deng Yunxiao of Dongguan. Of course, he died a few years ago. This person rose to the rank of Right Administration Vice Commissioner of Guangxi. After retirement, he devoted himself to poetry and essays, maintaining close contact with the Twelve Masters of Nanyuan like Kuang Lu and Li Suiqiu. Contemporaries praised him as the leader of the Lingnan poetry circle. It is claimed this person was upright by nature, enforcing laws strictly and resolutely as an official, making many enemies. In his later years, he had a rift with County Magistrate Guan Tianqu. He was falsely accused in the Nine Thieves Case and died of indignation. The Deng family hasn't seen the situation clearly yet. I believe once the general trend is set, the Deng family will come to Prefect Liu to cry out their grievances."

*Pfft.* Liu Xiang spat out the tea he had just drunk. "Don't. Dying of anger is one thing, but it's not a criminal case. Besides, how do you know the Deng family will definitely come to cry out grievances? We aren't the Great Ming."

Li Zhuoxian said, "Because ten years later in history, which is the second year of Longwu, his son Fengjing submitted a memorial to cry out grievances, and only then was he rehabilitated. Thinking of ways to be rehabilitated after more than ten years shows the Deng family values reputation heavily. Don't worry about them not coming. Although we aren't the Great Ming, once the situation is clear, they will definitely come to address the injustice. Besides, this is a local case and has nothing to do with the imperial court situation."

Liu Xiang paused. "Hehe, if we can pull out other handles to strike at remnants of the previous dynasty, this favor is worth doing."

"Unlike Chen Zizhuang, who relied on family connections to instigate a considerable number of people to oppose the Qing, Chen Bangyan, although a poor teacher, was an activist and doer among this group. His organizational and liaison abilities were first-class. The anti-Qing activities of the Southern Ming relied on him to mobilize a considerable number of people. He was a talent. Pity..." Although they served different masters, Li Zhuoxian couldn't help but praise Chen Bangyan a few words.

Wu Mu added, "Although Chen Zizhuang had a big reputation, his military ability was actually very average, essentially failing, lacking actual combat experience. According to historical records, in 1647, Chen Bangyan and Chen Zizhuang agreed to combine forces to attack Guangzhou. Inside the city, Yang Jingye and others responded, and three thousand Flower Mountain bandits were arranged in advance to feign surrender as insiders. Unexpectedly, Chen Zizhuang moved two days early and camped outside Guangzhou City. His house servant was captured by Qing soldiers while posting notices. Tong Yangjia interrogated him for the plan, leading to a leak. With only two hundred Qing soldiers in the city, Yang Jingye and the others, as well as the three thousand Flower Mountain bandits, were all captured and killed, causing a failure. When Chen Zizhuang wanted to retreat, Chen Bangyan arrived, sending a letter saying Li Chengdong had defeated Zhang Jiayu and was returning to save the city. He found out Li Chengdong's troops must pass through the Yuzhu River Channel and had set an ambush, agreeing that seeing blue flags with red edges meant friendly forces, asking Chen Zizhuang to join forces for a pincer attack then. Unfortunately, Chen Zizhuang blundered again and didn't order his subordinates to prepare. At the third watch, Li Chengdong came floating down the river. Chen Bangyan set fire to dozens of his large ships. Li Chengdong retreated in panic, and Chen Bangyan pursued downstream. At dawn, Chen Bangyan pursued Li Chengdong, approaching Chen Zizhuang's camp. Tong Yangjia beat drums from the city wall to boost morale. Chen Zizhuang's subordinates saw thousands of sails coming down the river and mistook them all for enemies, throwing their formation into chaos. Although Chen Zizhuang knew it was Chen Bangyan's army, he couldn't transmit orders in time. The rear troops pulled up anchor and left first, leading to a rout instead. Chen Bangyan couldn't clap with one hand and had to retreat."

"Not only a mistake, but mistakenly twice. Unforgivable. Truly, scholars rebelling won't succeed in ten years," Mu Min said.

Li Zhuoxian explained, "Actually, some clues can be seen from the 'Picture and Poems of Farewell Banquet for Yuan Chonghuan Supervising Liao in Dongguan.' Kuang Lu's poem says: 'Knowing the glorious fame of the Han Garden, cease the marten furs; orioles and flowers blow off the magnolia oars. Newly carrying horse bones to heroize the Yan market, old bestowed Dragon Spring sword hangs halfway. Tent suspended at night with the Nanhai moon, talk turns spring falling on the great rivers and lakes. Changyang happens to encounter the day of boasting over barbarians; in the vast desert, who else shoots eagles?' Peng Changhan's poem says: 'The ink on the proclamation of victory is not yet dry, the fame makes foreign lands still tremble with gallon. Red clouds wind around the Qilin Pavilion, steeds harness alongside the Xiezhi crown. A scroll of plain writing eventually repays the country; ten years of green temples ascend the altar twice. Going east in rain and snow, the day of heavy return; willows dependently line the road to watch.' On one side is 'Han Garden glorious fame,' on the other are 'marten,' 'barbarian,' 'eagle.' Just a piece of 'proclamation of victory' can make 'talk turns spring falling on the great rivers and lakes,' pacifying barbarian rebellions with the might of the Han dynasty's celestial empire. It reflects that these southern literati simply did not understand the strength of the Qing soldiers and were full of arrogant emotions. Later, Qu Huairui organized village militia to rush to the Longwu regime in Fujian, but died accidentally touching a blade on the way. Although this matter is quite strange, it can be seen that these people lacked practical experience in military armaments. Many staff members also brought various bad habits into Yuan Chonghuan's Supervision of Liao staff. When they participated in Guangdong Poetry Society activities, most brought prostitutes to add to the fun, and it was still the same in Liaodong. Yuan Chonghuan tolerated this. In a sense, Yuan Chonghuan's 'Pacifying Liao in Five Years' was also burdened by this arrogance. Even Zhang Dai said 'Yuan Chonghuan rolled up his sleeves to take on world affairs, mostly boasted shamelessly, yet was muddled all day, falling into the fog of his staff.'"

"This is the limitation of the times!" Liu Xiang couldn't help knocking on the table. "Pity, pity."

Li Zhuoxian added, "Among the Three Loyalists of Lingnan, the ones who could fight were Chen Bangyan and Zhang Jiayu. After Chen Bangyan raised troops, he ate one meal a day and shared hardships with his soldiers; his combat power was the strongest. As for Zhang Jiayu, although he was defeated repeatedly, every time he retreated to a place, he could quickly organize an armed force. This was Zhang Jiayu's ability. Now he is either following Du Yibin to recruit heads for the Shen'ao Learning Society or going to the Temple of the Five Immortals to listen to Fatty Cui chat nonsense. I believe he is not far from truly being used by us. Speaking of Zhang Jiayu, I almost missed someone: Li Shichun. Li Shichun is from Meizhou and should currently be the magistrate of Quwo, Shanxi. In 1638, he will be recommended back to the capital for his political achievements and become a Reader for the Eastern Palace, the teacher of Crown Prince Zhu Cilang. There is a saying that after Li Zicheng's defeat, Li Shichun brought Zhu Cilang back to Meizhou, and the Crown Prince shaved his hair to become a monk in Meizhou. Li Shichun's descendants also recorded this in 'Brief Account of Mr. Er He.' Local powerhouses in Eastern Guangdong like Li Shichun and Lai Qixiao were strong supporters of Zhang Jiayu's Wuxing Battalion, providing people and money. Li Shichun and Zhang Jiayu fell into the hands of the Chuang Army together in the capital and were fellow townsmen. I believe their relationship during this time was quite good. Lai Qixiao was a tyrant in Eastern Guangdong, with military power second only to Wu Liuqi of Raozhen. Lai's village militia was the initial backbone of the Wuxing Battalion. Unfortunately, these things won't happen anymore."

*Bang! Bang! Bang!* The sound of shooting filled the shooting range of the Lingao Garrison Battalion. This was an entertainment project that Senators stationed in Lingao often came to enjoy. In the old timeline, they couldn't shoot guns to their heart's content; arriving in the Ming Dynasty, they had to play themselves to death.

"Chief! Director Xiao is looking for you!" Special Agent 9527 trotted to Zhang Xiao's side, stood straight, and saluted.

Taking the earplugs off his head, Zhang Xiao was expressionless. recently, his heart was quite uneasy. He always asked himself when no one was around: "Why?"

Before the "South vs. North Dispute" broke out, perhaps someone revealed it intentionally, but Zhang Xiao accidentally saw the shareholding list of everyone in the Crossing Group. Some basic laborers were several grades lower than him in contribution and ability to the Crossing Group, yet their shares were several times or even dozens of times his. The imbalance in his chest was pried up like Archimedes' Earth.

Although he knew that apart from the 100,000 yuan guaranteed shares, the share quota was determined by the amount of funds at the time of "joining the partnership." Someone like him who had no family background back then naturally couldn't get more shares. But understanding it in his mind and feeling unhappy were two different things.

He only felt that he had been truly stupid before. Those in industry were the most miserable in any timeline, with harsh conditions and countless overtime hours. In the end, the shares were such a pitiful guarantee plus a symbolic number, totaling less than 200,000, while a few big soy-sauce-bottlers held millions in shares!

Of course, there were also quite a few people with few shares who lived gloriously; Xiao Zishan was one. But he held the invisible and intangible yet most precious "Founders' Shares." Wu Nanhai count as one too. Born as a technical cadre, this guy was skillful in social dancing, serving the old Executive Committee comfortably, and was good at catering to the masses. He shaped his image as a simple and honest "good person," not only building the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries into an independent kingdom but also becoming a hot candidate for the next Secretary of State.

What about himself? Unable to resist getting involved in the North-South dispute for the sake of resources in the industrial sector, he gained no benefits and offended quite a few people along the way.

"It's really not worth it, not worth it, not worth it!"

"Doing technology has no future; it's too miserable!"

"Damn it, no matter what you do, you need someone above to cover you! Indeed, no matter in what timeline, relationships are number one." Zhang Xiao's mind constantly reinforced this cognition.

"Tell him I'll go over in a while," Zhang Xiao instructed. Then he greeted Zha Wuchu, Jin Zhe, and Chen Huan, who had come to shoot together, saying he had something to do and would leave first. He then went to the General Office of the Senate with 9527.

Xiao Zishan had a fixed procedure when receiving Senators. Unless it was an uninvited guest visiting suddenly, Senators rarely sat in the waiting room for long. His secretary would make appointments with Senators at precise times. Basically, when the Senator arrived, the office door was already open, and the Director of the General Office himself would welcome them at the door with a smile.

To avoid "timing the meeting" leaving an impression of arrogance, he certainly wouldn't arrange five or ten-minute meetings. Every meeting had half an hour reserved. The extra time could be used for chatting nonsense, appearing more leisurely. Sometimes they would eat refreshments together to bond.

Sure enough, as soon as Zhang Xiao entered the waiting room, Xiao Zishan was performing his "welcome and send-off" process at the door.

After some warm greetings like comrades asking about health and warmth, Zhang Xiao took a seat in front of Xiao Zishan's desk.

The corners of his mouth raised slightly as he asked politely, "Director Xiao, you were looking for me?"

Zhang Xiao was a cycle younger than the Three Giants of the Crossing, counting as young within the Senate. But he was now over thirty. Nearly ten years of tempering after the crossing made his ways of the world increasingly mature, unlike a technical geek. Back then, his transfer from the basic labor force group to the pharmaceutical factory was Xiao Zishan's arrangement. In the eyes of outsiders, his relationship with Xiao Zishan was not ordinary.
