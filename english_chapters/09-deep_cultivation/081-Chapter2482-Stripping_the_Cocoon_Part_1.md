# Chapter 2482: Stripping the Cocoon (Part 1)

The meeting at Songluo Tea House concluded successfully. Hao Fang had prepared for this scene for a long time, all to give an account to Shi Weng, who stood behind Master Li.

From the end of the Guangzhou plague until now, he had used nearly forty to fifty thousand taels of Shi Weng's silver over the past year or so. The money for the assistants sent to him successively also came from Shi Weng. Yet, he hadn't produced much in the way of decent results. No matter how loyal he was, Shi Weng, far away in Nanjing, would probably not forgive him easily.

He knew that he was not the only pawn Shi Weng had in Guangzhou Prefecture. If Shi Weng felt he had lost his value, his own little life wouldn't matter much, but his pregnant concubine and the son he had never met would probably not escape a cruel fate.

Thinking of this, he felt a vague chill on the back of his neck.

Fortunately, the personnel sent were very capable. In less than half a year, they had produced fake silver dollars that could pass muster, and the matter of making banknotes also had some prospects. This gave him some comfort. His great cause of opposing the Baldies could continue—and he could still rake in a lot of profit.

He wasn't clear on exactly what use fake silver dollars and fake banknotes had. In fact, up to now, he didn't even know where Li Fugui and the others were counterfeiting. In the entire counterfeiting network, his role was just that of a central liaison for communication and transportation.

Li Fugui and the others delivered the fake coins to him, and another unnamed team delivered the smelted drug silver to him. Shi Weng's men would bring operational funds and also deliver Shi Weng's latest instructions; Boss He came to him to pick up the goods and spend the fake currency...

Speaking of which, he knew nothing, yet he knew everything. If the Bald Thieves caught him, he could only confess a few names. This Shi Weng was high, truly high!

Of course, Second Master Hao would never let the Bald Thieves catch him. Not only had he long planned his escape route using Wang Daniao's "Ditch Map," but just in case, he also carried poison on him at all times—he had long heard of the Bald Thieves' methods.

Everything was running methodically and smoothly. However, a recent incident caused him anxiety. That was, not long ago, a load of drug silver had inexplicably lost an ingot during delivery.

The person delivering the drug silver insisted it was lost or stolen on the road. Searching his whole body revealed no trace of the drug silver.

To be cautious, he had Hao Ping silence the man and throw the body into the Six Veins Canal. But this matter became a sore point for him.

Whether the silver was lost, stolen, or hidden and spent by that man, it would inevitably flow into the market. Although this drug silver looked very realistic, there was still a high probability that flaws would be spotted if it fell into the hands of money-changing "silver dogs." If only the silver dogs spotted it, that would be fine, but if it alerted the Bald Thieves, that would be trouble.

The silver ingot stamped "Sanjiangmao" had been lost at the scene when dealing with Wang Daniao and Wang Xiuzhu. It must have been taken by the Bald Thieves later. Later, he heard that the Bald Thieves had inquired about the origin of this stamp at various smelting shops. Fortunately, there was no drug silver flowing in the market at that time, and Daoist Wu had not used this stamp when smelting silver, so the Bald Thieves probably hadn't connected the two yet.

"Second Master, Monk Haixiang is here."

"Invite him in," Hao Fang said.

This pockmarked monk was always elusive. Every time he came here, he was picked up from a secret location in the Six Veins Canal and ferried to this secret residence—obviously, he had also obtained that copy of Wang Daniao's Ditch Map.

Hao Fang wasn't clear about this person's background, but this person was very important. Every time he showed his face, he brought some very important information.

However, when Hao Ping brought the monk before him, Second Master Hao was startled. This person was not wearing a monk's robe but was dressed in Australian attire.

"Master... you are..."

"Nowadays, a monk can't live freely in Guangzhou either," Master Haixiang said with some emotion. "Now even wandering monks looking for lodging have to register their household residence. I can't stay in Guangzhou city anymore."

"The Bald Thieves' patrols are getting stricter by the day. This is to be expected," Hao Fang smiled bitterly. "Fortunately, we moved the furnaces out back then! Otherwise, I would probably be in the Bald Thieves' prison right now."

"Hehe, such jokes are better left unsaid," Master Haixiang said. "I came here to say a few important words to you."

"Please speak."

"That Sanjiangmao stamp, don't use it anymore," Master Haixiang said. "There was a slip-up."

"What happened?"

"Someone brought five ingots of Sanjiangmao silver to Guangzhou and was targeted by our brothers at the dock. We thought this person had stolen drug silver, so we planned to kidnap him... Unexpectedly, a fight broke out halfway, and he was confusedly hit by someone else with a stick and fainted on the road. We didn't manage to bring him back, and this planted the root for disaster!" Master Haixiang sighed deeply.

"That silver..."

"It wasn't drug silver; it was genuine silver!" Master Haixiang probably found it surprising himself.

"Is that so?!" Hao Fang's mouth couldn't close, his heart thumping wildly.

"Correct, just old silver ingots." Master Haixiang nodded. "It just so happens that this person is now a guest of the Bald Thieves. The Bald Thieves have already noticed and are investigating the origin of Sanjiangmao."

Hao Fang sucked in a breath of cold air. Only after a long while did he say, "I know. Many thanks for the Master's guidance!"

"There is one more thing," Master Haixiang whispered. "Two-thirds of next month's silver dollar output, send it to..." He whispered something in a low voice, then instructed, " be careful with such a large shipment, do not let it be seen."

Former Great Ming Censorate's Guangdong Circuit Intendant Yamen, now the Guangdong Regional Bureau of Political Security.

In an office converted from a courtroom, Yang Cao took a sip of coffee, put the cup back on the desk, and said, "It's weak." The clerk beside her immediately took the coffee pot and walked to the pantry.

Yang Cao looked carefully at the documents in the folder. After a while, she stood up and walked to the wooden blackboard at one end of the office, staring wordlessly for a long time at the relationship chart drawn in chalk.

Various strips of paper and photos were pinned all over the blackboard with wooden-handled steel tacks, connected by chalk arrows. Some arrows had notes written on them, appearing chaotic and disorderly.

Yang Cao's gaze wandered through the chaotic clues, finally resting on a black-and-white photo of Liang Cunhou. The smooth solving of the Witchcraft Case had brought huge honor to the Bureau of Political Security and Yang Cao personally, but beneath this glory was an imperfect regret. The dormancy of local anti-Song forces made identifying hostile elements even more difficult. Judging from the mastered data, at least two clues in the Witchcraft Case converged on Liang Cunhou. One was that Daoist Wood-Stone seemed to have contacted important local gentry and received help before committing crimes and escaping, and Liang Cunhou was highly suspected; the other was Liang Cunhou's unusually large collection and analysis of Senate materials.

After the first civil service exam in Guangzhou city, during the political review of admitted personnel, a man named Wu Ming was found to have participated in the "Yuyuan Society" run by Liang Cunhou. Through the interrogation of Wu Ming, the Bureau of Political Security mastered a large amount of inside information on the Yuyuan Society. The founding purpose of the Yuyuan Society was to research and learn from so-called "Baldy Studies" and to explore loopholes and weaknesses in the Senate's current ruling structure. A large number of members in the society possessed characteristics of potential anti-Song elements. The result of analyzing the two clues together was self-evident. Inside the Guangzhou municipal government, Liang Cunhou had long been blacklisted, and investigation and monitoring of him had been strengthened.

But the investigation lacked a crucial link: evidence. Whether physical evidence or witnesses, every time the net was about to close, it was silently cut off. Yang Cao never feared crazy enemies; frequent actions represented errors and clues, and crazy actions represented the enemy's despair and helplessness. A fish on the chopping board always struggled most violently. But this opponent was extremely cautious, never reacting impulsively, adopting "creeping tactics." The resistance was slow and weak, but firm and ceaseless.

The clerk outside the door brought espresso and said softly, "Comrade Regional Vice Commander, your coffee!" Seeing no other reaction from her, the clerk reported again: "The Regional Bureau of Finance and Taxation sent the latest assistance request notification regarding the counterfeit currency investigation case..."

Yang Cao paused and asked, "Is there an official document?"

The clerk said, "There is a document. It was issued in the name of the General Bureau of Finance and Taxation to the General Bureau of Political Security, then forwarded to Guangzhou. Deputy Director Zhao has already approved it. The telegram is being transcribed."

Yang Cao said, "This matter is currently the responsibility of the police. Give them whatever materials they ask for; do not give anything they haven't mentioned."

"Yes, Comrade Regional Vice Commander!"

"Go invite the responsible comrade from the Investigation Section over."

Before long, Xu Tong, head of the Investigation Section, arrived at Yang Cao's office. Yang Cao's style remained stiff and direct: "What progress has been made recently in monitoring the Liang residence?"

Xu Tong had just sat down. Before he could adjust his posture, he hurriedly replied: "Peripheral investigators have consistently been unable to penetrate the inner residence to obtain definite intelligence. However, judging from the recent situation and the reactions of parties related to the Liang residence, it should be related to the aftermath of the recent tax audit. Analysis suggests they are dealing with various problematic accounts to evade crackdown. Three days ago, Liang Cunhou visited Director Zheng of the Commerce Department and Miss Pei of the Purple Cloud Tower, and visited Gao Ju a day later."

Yang Cao asked, "Did they meet?" As she spoke, she took a cigarette from a case.

Xu Tong flipped through his notebook and said: "Director Zheng declined on the grounds of participating in industrial and commercial activities. Miss Pei met him briefly, but no substantive issues were discussed. Because Liang Cunhou is a key surveillance target of the Bureau and Guangzhou City, both the Commerce Department and Purple Cloud Tower compiled reception records and sent them over; related gifts were also registered and turned in. Since Gao Ju is a private citizen and has no direct contact with us, there is no relevant feedback."

He looked at this capable woman who came from a humble background but was famous within the system. She had countless halos of honor on her head and was known for being ruthless. However, Xu Tong, who graduated from the Fan Ts'ao Ti National School's advanced elementary class and received two years of specialized education at the Political Security Training School, did not think highly of her professional abilities.
