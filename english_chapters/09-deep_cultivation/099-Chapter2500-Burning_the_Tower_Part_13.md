# Chapter 2500: Burning the Tower (13)

Seeing the situation under control, Xue Tu nodded approvingly and walked slowly to Liu Jun's side, gently patting him on the shoulder. Liu Jun's tense body trembled, then suddenly relaxed, bowing softly. Xue Tu looked at him with a smile, then suddenly stepped back. With a *clang*, he drew the dragon-devouring treasure sword from his waist and stabbed Liu Jun in the chest. The long blade pierced through to his back. Xue Tu took a big step forward, gripped the sword with both hands, and pushed with all his might. With a *hiss*, the blade sank in up to the hilt. Then he twisted it with full force, slowly agitating inside Liu Jun's chest cavity. The intense pain drained all strength from Liu Jun. The iron hammer fell from his hand with a *clang*. His mouth gaped open, staring at Xue Tu with eyes full of despair, malice, and disbelief. Massive internal bleeding spewed from his mouth. At this moment, the two stood almost face to face. Xue Tu leaned his head slightly forward and whispered in Liu Jun's ear—a voice only the two could hear: "Brother need not worry about the old and young at home; I, Xue, will take care of them all." He kicked Liu Jun fiercely in the abdomen, using the momentum to pull back with both hands and draw out the long sword. A blood mist sprayed from Liu Jun's chest as he fell backward with a *plop*. Fearing he might spout nonsense before dying, Xue Tu rushed forward and stabbed again at the throat before stopping.

After killing the man, Xue Tu threw the sword aside and said loudly: "Whether Junior Brother Liao was truly guilty is not yet known. Even if there truly was an act of rebelling against the Way and betraying righteousness, the punishment gate should have been opened wide. According to the thirty-two great rules and sixty-four small precepts, whether killing or punishing, the Punisher should have judged fairly based on reason. How could a disciple kill his master, committing such an act of deceiving the master and destroying ancestors? Everyone may execute such a petty person. I hope all brothers take this as a warning."

After speaking, Xue Tu threw himself on Liao Yongcheng's corpse and cried aloud, hitting the ground with his head until his forehead was red and swollen, crying until his voice was hoarse. Only when he was too weak to support himself did several sect leaders and senior disciples come forward to help him up and support him to the round-backed armchair.

Seeing this, Wang Yunshan also prostrated himself on the ground and cried aloud: "Thank you, Senior Uncle Xue, for avenging Master and executing this evil thief. In the future, if Senior Uncle Xue has any command, disciple will surely go through fire and water without declining. Now that the remaining sons of my Red Sun Way are all mediocre and find it hard to take charge of major affairs, I represent the brothers in the Way to make a bold request. I hope Senior Uncle Xue—the capable doing more work—will not decline hardship and take charge of Red Sun Way's affairs on our behalf. In the future, whether establishing a separate household or merging into the Heaven Gate Daoist Spirit Society, we will all listen to Senior Uncle's instructions. I hope Senior Uncle will not decline, so as to comfort Master's spirit in heaven."

Xue Tu wiped his tears. "Since Junior Brother Liao has gone, I will naturally furnish a proper funeral. A gang cannot be without a master for a day. Since it is so, I will force myself to this difficult task and temporarily take charge of Red Sun Way's affairs. Matters within the Way will be assisted by Yunshan. When a person dies, the crime disappears. There's no need for large-scale implicating. Pause Junior Brother Liao in the backyard; wait until matters settle before entering the earth in peace."

Sitting below, Yang Tiezhou of the Eight Immortals Society and Ge Yaoxian of the Yellow Tassel Society were both trembling, sweating profusely, unable to speak. Meanwhile, Guan He of Green Stone Stronghold, Song Dougian of the Buddha Fragrance Society, and Pockmarked Chen of the One Universe Primordial Chaos Dao were beaming with joy and high spirits.

Liao Yongcheng's corpse was carried down by two minions. His head drooped to the side, seemingly watching everything with gray-white eyes—watching demons and monsters run rampant in the world without scruples.

Xu Tong let out a long breath, narrowed his eyes, and silently watched everything before him, a cold sneer hanging at the corner of his mouth.

He followed behind Li Baiqing, mixed in the crowd, looking forward. Xue Tu stood in the center position. Wooden Stone Daoist, holding his whisk, stood tall behind him. Seeing the situation settled, the Daoist signaled with his eyes, and Xue Tu waved his hand. Twenty or so minions came, groups of four carrying more than ten wooden boxes in.

The boxes were made of high-quality hardwood, wrapped with iron corners and reinforced with iron hoops—they looked very sturdy. The four minions carrying each one appeared to find them very heavy.

The venue instantly fell into commotion. Xue Tu didn't keep them in suspense; he immediately took out keys and instructed the minions to open the boxes.

As soon as the lids opened, silver light flashed inside. Full of silver dollars! Shining white and bright, dazzling in the sunlight, momentarily blinding everyone.

Since ancient times, wealth moves hearts. A box of silver dollars held at least a thousand pieces! The crowd instantly became excited, everyone wanting to squeeze forward.

"Don't squeeze! Whoever dares to come up and move wildly, I'll chop off his dog head!"

Guan He, holding a horse-chopping saber, gave a sharp shout that suppressed the surging crowd.

Xue Tu made a calming gesture and said deeply: "Brothers, do not be impatient. These silver dollars were sent by Governor Xiong. They are pay for everyone..."

The crowd was in another commotion. Sects and secret societies mostly operated in the countryside. Though they seemed to have many members, and leaders had considerable local power on ordinary days, in reality the benefits were limited. Local clans were very strong, leaving little room for sect development. The people were poor—no matter how devout, they couldn't bring many "offerings." Sometimes being a leader meant putting in one's own money and grain. So these sects, seemingly with long histories—some passed down for more than ten generations—were also obscure. In the final analysis, it all came down to the word "money."

"Brothers of the various gates who came to the alliance meeting today—as long as you bring out the roster, every name on it gets three silver dollars, regardless of age or size. This is the Imperial Court's gracious reward to us!"

Another excited commotion in the crowd. Xue Tu added: "As for the various leaders and heads, outside of this reward, there are additional rewards based on rank. The least is three Australian dollars! The most is thirty blocks!"

Now the tense faces of the participating representatives all relaxed. Not only relaxed, but bloomed with joy. One name was two Australian dollars. They had at least one or two hundred disciples and followers; at once they could pocket several hundred yuan. Swallowing half of this gracious reward could still be considered acting with conscience. As for the reward given to them personally, it counted for little in comparison. Some secretly regretted why they hadn't forged more names on the roster—they could have made much more money now. Those with active minds secretly hid their rosters, deciding to falsely claim they hadn't brought them and would return to fetch them before collecting. They could simply forge another copy...

Originally, the sect leaders who came had been somewhat unwilling. First, they feared their power would be annexed by Xue Tu. Second, anti-Kun activities carried enormous risk. Now, with shining white silver dollars before their eyes, a rush of hot blood went to their heads, and every one of them scrambled to express loyalty, willing to "smear the ground with liver and brains" for the Imperial Court.

Wooden Stone Daoist thought to himself: *All living beings in the world, bustling and hustling—all come for profit and go for profit. Rebelling and starting an uprising is nothing more than this! Stone Elder indeed sees clearly from a thousand li away, laying down this setup of silver and money early on. Otherwise, what could incite this group of ignorant villagers?* Seeing the timing was right, he signaled Xue Tu with a glance, indicating they could proceed to the next step.

Xue Tu understood and immediately announced the start of the alliance ceremony.

Led by Xue Tu, everyone kowtowed to the Heavenly Emperor's shrine. The master of ceremonies chanted loudly: "Everyone present listen clearly. Today the Heaven Gate Daoist Spirit Society reopens the incense hall, admitting all fellow Daoists into the gate. From now on, we are all brothers together, with no more distinction. Entering my Spirit Society, the Heavenly Emperor protects, and disasters disappear forever. If anyone colludes with outsiders to harm brothers, their entire family will be executed. Announced in advance—everyone obey solemnly."

Then he chanted: "Heroes gather from the four seas afar, smearing blood to ally hearts in friendship. This generation now becomes sworn brothers together, loyalty and righteousness shining in the nine heavens for a thousand autumns."

After singing a tune, he added: "Those who enter my society must abide by society rules. Disciples under the gate must not covet wealth and goods, must not bully men and dominate women, must not privately transmit Daoist methods..."

After reading the rules, he led the crowd to burn incense and pray, burning paper money in the coin-transforming furnace. Various elaborate formalities—offering incense, praying and bowing, swearing brotherhood, arranging ranks. The various songs sung numbered more than a dozen. After all rituals were performed, he led Xue Tu back to position to accept everyone's congratulations.

Xu Tong bowed along with the crowd while observing carefully. These Daoist sects and spirit societies placed utmost importance on rituals. Through this series of forms, they enhanced their own sense of mystery and majesty. The rituals were accompanied by various spell performances and divine techniques, giving participating members strong physiological and psychological shock. At the same time, relying on various myths and superstitious legends, they hypnotized and brainwashed believers, making them blindly worship the sect, thereby achieving the ultimate goal of controlling the followers.

The rituals finally ended. After tossing about for half the day, everyone was exhausted and hungry. Xue Tu ordered "Open the banquet," and minions laid out various wine and food like flowing water. Before long, cups and plates were exchanged across the courtyard, and everything was messy with shouting and drinking games.

Xu Tong held a wine cup and toasted people with Li Baiqing from time to time, but he was only going through motions—he didn't truly drink. He had to remain awake and alert at all times. Alcohol would lower his insight and self-control. His gaze cautiously observed the surroundings. He neither spoke nor asked questions, nor did anything that might arouse suspicion. He only carefully checked and listened—but failed to notice a figure secretly following behind him.

Suddenly, a loud shout came from behind: "Wang Jiangchen, what are you doing here?"

Xu Tong's heart jumped fiercely. Wang Jiangchen was the full name of the alias "Mr. Wang" he'd used in Guangzhou. He'd performed two missions under this name. He didn't turn immediately, but turned his gaze behind him along with everyone else. A burly man of twenty-eight or twenty-nine stood there behind him, staring with burning eyes. Xu Tong first scanned the surroundings before confirming the person was indeed calling him. He replied blankly: "Were you calling me?"

The man sneered: "I was calling you, Wang Jiangchen."

Xu Tong was stunned for a moment. "Eh? This brother, you and I don't know each other. What advice do you have?"

The man shouted: "Wang Jiangchen, are you still going to play dumb?"

Xu Tong shook his head. "This brother, my humble surname is Li, given name Jian. I just arrived in Guangzhou Prefecture not long ago. Presumably you've mistaken me for someone else."

The man was stunned. Xu Tong denied it completely, and he indeed had no evidence. Moreover, very few people had seen this Wang Jiangchen, and there were no other witnesses, which made him feel somewhat tricky.

Beside them, Li Baiqing stepped forward and said loudly: "Sun Gang, are you ruining someone's innocence out of thin air? My cousin-nephew Li Jian got into a lawsuit in Jiangnan and fled to my place to avoid trouble. What does that concern you?"
