# Chapter 2406: Reorganizing the Family Business (III)

Chen Lin walked through the village. Following the etiquette of a junior returning home, he visited the clan elders one by one. For the deceased, he kowtowed before their spirit tablets; for the living, he sat and exchanged a few words.

His family had always held high status within the clan, so even the elders treated him with courtesy. But he sensed uneasiness beneath their words and expressions.

He had initially assumed this uneasiness stemmed from Second Uncle seizing the silk workshop—fear that his return would spark a conflict between uncle and nephew, causing turmoil within the clan. Only through conversation did he realize their greater anxiety: Second Uncle had seized clan power by allying with the Australians, then colluded with "outsiders."

Though outsiders in Nansha were not numerous, they accounted for nearly a third of the population—mostly laborers and tenant farmers. These outsiders had always been submissive under Chen family rule. When an occasional troublemaker appeared, a word from the clan elders was sufficient to deal with the matter.

Chen Lin's Second Uncle, Chen Xuan, was a profligate with no prestige in the clan. Though he had risen to power as the Australians' "Liaison Officer," his words still carried no weight in Nansha. The clan's younger generation refused to serve him. Naturally, Chen Xuan could only bring in external support.

The Australians were too distant to rely upon, and for a mere village "Liaison Officer," they wouldn't specifically send people to back him. So Chen Xuan had turned to these "outsiders."

Regardless of how the Chen elders claimed they had never treated outsiders poorly, the fact remained that these outsiders felt no gratitude. With Chen Xuan's instigation, they immediately began "repaying kindness with enmity."

Now village administration was controlled by outsiders. Even the newly established Village Braves were entirely in outsider hands. With their support, Chen Xuan could do virtually whatever he pleased.

"...Nowadays, the outsiders are terrible. Tenants organize rent strikes, forcing landlords to reduce rent and interest. Workshop workers—long-term or short-term—demand wage increases. Even household servants have grown restless, speaking wild words. Truly lawless..." The clan elders lowered their voices to complain. "Those who disobey their wishes get beaten or cursed at best, robbed at worst... They've even threatened to kill people."

"Doesn't Second Uncle intervene?"

"Him? He relies on this gang of outsiders now. Besides, people have to be willing to listen before you can communicate with them."

Hearing this, Chen Lin's mood grew heavier. Honestly, having the family workshop seized by Second Uncle was a small matter—they shared the same ancestors, after all. But Second Uncle colluding with outsiders was a grave concern. If allowed to continue like this, the Chen family's foundation in Nansha would be destroyed by his hands.

"Let's go—I want to visit the Ancestral Hall." Chen Lin said.

Currently he had nowhere to stay. Sister-in-law Guihua was a widow; his sister could lodge there, but for him and Chen Qing—two men—it would be inappropriate. They could only stay at the Ancestral Hall for a few days and observe the situation.

The Ancestral Hall also looked quite battered. The doors and windows had all been smashed, though the main plaque remained. Two able-bodied men holding spears stood guard at the entrance. What kind of arrangement was this?

Full of suspicion, Chen Lin was about to enter when he was shouted at before he could mount the steps:

"Halt! What's your business?"

Chen Qing quickly spoke up: "This is Chen Lin, Ninth Master of the Upper Second Branch!"

"Upper Two Households" was their branch. The Chen family of Nansha was divided into Upper Three Branches, North Three Branches, and Lower Seven Branches—thirteen branch households in total. Among them, the Upper Three Branches were the direct lineage, and by custom, the Clan Leader was always selected from these three branches.

Chen Lin ranked ninth among his generation in the clan. Usually only outsiders and servants addressed him this way. But Chen Qing had taken one look and recognized neither guard as clansmen.

"Upper Second Branch, Upper Latrine Branch—eight, nine, ten, who cares?" The young guard looked disdainful and waved his spear. "This is the Nansha Village Office! If you have no business, clear off!"

Chen Lin was startled: *My own ancestral hall has changed names?* He was about to speak when the older guard scolded his companion: "What nonsense are you spouting! This is Ninth Master Lin—Master Chen Paijia's own nephew!" He then hurried forward with a smile, bowing: "Ninth Master, please don't lower yourself to this boy's level! He's only been in Nansha a few days and doesn't recognize you..."

Chen Lin studied the older guard. He looked familiar but couldn't be placed. Given the situation, this was no time to play the grand master, so he immediately adopted a cordial manner: "You are...?"

"This humble one is Wu Quan," the guard said quickly. "I was a long-term worker for the North First Branch..."

"You're from Uncle Kuan's household?"

"Yes, yes—how kind of the Ninth Master to remember." Wu Quan's face lit up with pleasure. "This boy is a distant relative of mine, just brought here to serve as militia—scrambling for a meal. He doesn't recognize you, sir. Please don't blame him..." He scolded the young man again: "Hurry up and apologize!"

Chen Lin quickly waved his hand. "Those who don't know aren't at fault." Seeing the young man's reluctant expression, he borrowed the new trend from Guangzhou: "This is the New Life Movement now—such formalities are out of fashion!" He swiftly changed the subject: "Is Second Uncle in?"

"Yes, yes," Wu Quan said eagerly. "Second Master Xuan is now the Paijia of this village, handling all matters of duty assignment and grain collection. He's incredibly busy! You've come at the right time, sir—otherwise he'd be heading out to handle business shortly."

Chen Lin wondered privately: *It's almost dark. Where is Second Uncle going to handle business?* Setting the thought aside, he said: "I've just returned from Guangzhou and wish to pay my respects to Second Uncle..."

"Of course, of course." Wu Quan nodded repeatedly and instructed the young man: "Xiao Min, go announce him!"

Chen Lin reflected that Second Uncle certainly put on airs these days. In the past, clansmen never needed to be announced to see the Clan Leader—at most, a shout at the door sufficed.

After a short while, the young man returned: "Master Paijia invites Ninth Master Lin to enter."

His feelings at this moment were complicated. From all appearances, Second Uncle wielded great power in the village, clearly having become someone whose word was law.

Though young, Chen Lin understood worldly ways. Nothing was more dangerous than "a small man intoxicated by success." Second Uncle now embodied that phrase completely. His heart tightened involuntarily as he calculated whether he or his father had ever offended the man.

Major offenses? There seemed to be none. After all, when Second Uncle had embezzled silk, they had only suspended his duties while still providing an allowance. But as an elder brother, Father had certainly scolded him plenty. And when Second Aunt forced Second Uncle to write the divorce letter years ago, Second Uncle had wept in the Ancestral Hall, begging the clan elders to stand up for him. It was Father who declared the family was in the wrong—that while forcing a divorce letter was excessive, it was understandable given the circumstances.

The final decision not to intervene had been a consensus among the elders, but Father had been the one to start it. If Second Uncle bore a grudge over having his wife "taken away"...

The thought made Chen Lin break into a cold sweat. These were chaotic times. With power in his hands, who could guarantee Second Uncle wouldn't use his position to settle private scores?

He secretly regretted coming to the Ancestral Hall so rashly. He hadn't thought through the implications.

But it was too late to say "never mind." That would only provoke Second Uncle's anger. He steeled himself and followed the village brave inside.

The interior of the Ancestral Hall was tidy. The spirit tablets of ancestors from all branches were enshrined intact, with offerings, incense, and candles arranged on the altar table. Someone was clearly maintaining the space. Chen Lin felt slightly relieved—at least the Ancestral Hall itself was unharmed.

He was led to the three main rooms in the East Cross Courtyard—this was where the clan conducted its business. In the past, Father had worked here. The courtyard remained, but the people had changed.

Chen Lin's emotions churned, but what mattered most now was his own situation. He steadied his nerves, straightened his clothes and cap, and walked in.

Second Uncle Chen Xuan sat squarely in the Grand Preceptor Chair. This notorious profligate of the Chen family was not yet forty, but years of dissipation had left his facial flesh loose and sagging. Normally, direct descendants of such landowning, scholarly clans had dignified appearances. Chen Xuan, however, had a sinister face. As he aged and his flesh loosened, his drooping eyes and brows made him look increasingly crafty and cunning.

Upon entering, Chen Lin paid his respects courteously and called out: "Second Uncle."

"You've returned." Chen Xuan looked his nephew up and down, noted the white cloth wrapped around his waist for mourning, harrumphed, and asked: "Smooth journey?"

"Smooth journey." Chen Lin reasoned that since Second Uncle had become the Australians' Paijia, he might as well flatter him on this point. "Speaking of which, the roads were much more peaceful than before. Militia patrols and sentries everywhere. The common people seemed quiet too. The Australians certainly know how to govern."

"Naturally." Chen Xuan was quite proud of his choice. "Nephew has come from Guangzhou—tell me, how are things there?"

"One might call it 'rivers calm and seas peaceful.'" Seeing that Second Uncle enjoyed such talk, Chen Lin couldn't afford to hold back now. "If the whole world could be like Guangzhou, it would truly be a rare prosperous age..."

"Hahaha!" Chen Xuan laughed heartily. "Well spoken, Nephew. The Australians are indeed formidable!" He restrained his smile and said: "Tell me about the situation in Guangzhou."

"What aspects does Second Uncle wish to hear about?"

"Pick the major events!"

Since Second Uncle was receptive, Chen Lin selected the significant developments since the Australians entered the city and narrated them one by one. He also described the Australians' governance and management of people, especially the New Life Movement. Chen Xuan listened with fascination. Chen Lin spoke for nearly an hour before being interrupted.

"Fascinating! Fascinating! So what they said is true!" Chen Xuan sighed with emotion. "I originally thought it somewhat exaggerated. Unexpectedly, Nephew's arrival has resolved my confusion! Excellent! Excellent!"

Chen Lin didn't know who "they" referred to, nor precisely what was "excellent." But he immediately thought of what his sister had mentioned: the workshop was now managed by Short-hairs. This "they" probably meant these people.

He responded with a vague acknowledgment.

Chen Xuan shifted the conversation: "Have you visited your father's grave?"

"Yes." Chen Lin quickly stood. "I only regret being in Guangzhou at the time, unable to personally handle Father's funeral arrangements. It all relied on the uncles and clan relatives..."

"Elder Brother died miserably." Chen Xuan assumed an expression of deep grief. "The clan and village were all ravaged by the soldiers, and several elders also passed away. Thanks to the Australians' trust, only I can now shoulder this heavy burden."

"Yes, thanks to Second Uncle's utmost efforts, Nansha Village remains safe."

Chen Xuan glanced at his nephew, secretly pleased. *In the past, you and your father were polite enough to my face, but when did you ever truly respect me? Now even a dragon must coil before me!*
