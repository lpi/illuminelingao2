# Chapter 2406: Reorganizing the Family Business (III)

Chen Lin walked around the village. Following the etiquette of a junior returning home, he visited the elders of the clan one by one. For the deceased, he kowtowed before their spirit tablets; for the living, he sat down and chatted for a few sentences.

His family had a very high status in the clan, so even the elders had to be polite to him. But he sensed uneasiness revealed in the elders' words and expressions.

He originally thought this uneasiness was related to Second Uncle seizing the silk workshop: fearing that once he returned, uncle and nephew would fight and cause trouble in the clan. Only from the conversation did he realize that what they were more uneasy about was Second Uncle colluding with "outsiders" after seizing clan power by colluding with the Australians.

Although there were not many outsiders in Nansha, they accounted for almost one-third of the population. Most were laborers and tenant farmers. These outsiders had always been submissive under the rule of the Chen family in the past. Occasionally if a few restless ones appeared, the clan elders just needed a word to deal with them.

Chen Lin's Second Uncle, Chen Xuan, was a profligate son with no prestige in the clan. Even though he became the "Liaison Officer" and rose to power relying on the Australians, his words didn't carry weight in Nansha, and the clan's younger generation was unwilling to be driven by him. Naturally, Chen Xuan could only bring in external aid.

The Australians were too far away for him, and for such a village "Liaison Officer," the Australians wouldn't specifically send people to back him up. So Chen Xuan targeted these "outsiders."

Regardless of how the Chen elders claimed they treated outsiders not thinly in the past, the fact was that outsiders were not grateful for this. With Chen Xuan's instigation, they immediately began to "repay kindness with enmity."

Now not only was the village administration controlled by outsiders, but even the newly established Village Braves were fully controlled by outsiders. Relying on their support, Chen Xuan could practically do whatever he wanted in the village.

"...Nowadays, the outsiders are terrible. Tenants perform rent strikes and force landlords to reduce rent and interest; those working in workshops, whether long-term or short-term laborers, demand wage increases. Even the servants of various families in the clan are restless, speaking wild words. Sigh, sigh, truly lawless..." The clan elders lowered their voices to complain. "Whoever disobeys their will is beaten and scolded lightly, or robbed heavily... They even threatened to kill people."

"Second Uncle doesn't care?"

"Him? He relies on the power of this gang of outsiders now. Besides, people have to communicate to you first (be willing to listen to you)."

Hearing these words, Chen Lin's mood became increasingly heavy. Honestly, the family workshop being seized by Second Uncle was a small matter—after all, same ancestor. But Second Uncle colluding with outsiders was a big matter! If he was allowed to mess around like this, this Chen family foundation in Nansha would be destroyed in his hands!

"Let's go, return to the Ancestral Hall to look." Chen Lin said.

Currently, he had no place to stay. Sister-in-law Guihua was a widow; it was fine for his sister to lodge there, but inconvenient for him and Chen Qing, two men. They could only stay in the Ancestral Hall for a few days to see the situation.

The Ancestral Hall also looked very miserable; doors and windows were all smashed, though the plaque remained. Two able-bodied men holding spears stood guard in front of the door—what kind of rule was this?

Full of suspicion, Chen Lin was about to enter the Ancestral Hall when he was shouted at before stepping up the stairs:

"Stand still! What do you do?"

Chen Qing quickly said: "This is Chen Lin, Ninth Master of the 'Upper Second Branch'!"

Upper Two Households was his branch. The Chen family in Nansha was divided into Upper Three Branches, North Three Branches, and Lower Seven Branches, totaling thirteen branch houses. Among them, the Upper Three Branches were the direct line close branches, and the Clan Leader was customarily served by children of these three branches.

Chen Lin ranked ninth among the peers in the clan. Usually only outsiders and servants called him this. But Chen Qing took one look and didn't recognize the two guards, knowing they were not clansmen.

"What Upper Second Branch or Upper Latrine Branch, eight nine ten," the young guard looked disdainful and waved his long spear. "This is Nansha Village Office! If nothing matters, roll far away!"

Chen Lin was startled: *My own ancestral hall has changed name and surname?!* Just as he was about to speak, the other older guard scolded: "What nonsense are you talking! This is Ninth Master Lin! Master Chen Paijia's own nephew!" After saying this, he welcomed him with a smile, bowed, and said: "Ninth Master, don't lower yourself to this brat's level! He's only been in Nansha a few days and doesn't recognize you..."

Chen Lin looked at the older guard and found him familiar but couldn't recall who he was. The current situation was obviously not the time to pretend to be a big master, so he smiled very politely immediately: "You are..."

"Small one is Wu Quan," the guard busily said, "Originally a long-term worker in North First Branch..."

"You are the long-term worker of Uncle Kuan's family?"

"Yes, yes, hard for Ninth Master to still remember." Wu Quan's face blossomed with joy. "This brat is a distant relative of mine, just introduced here to serve as militia—to scramble for a meal. He doesn't recognize you, Old Sir; please don't blame..." After saying this, he scolded again: "Still not coming up to apologize!"

Chen Lin quickly waved his hand: "Those who don't know are not guilty." Seeing the young man looking reluctant, he quickly copied the new trend in Guangzhou city and said, "Now it's the New Life Movement; this set isn't popular!" Saying so, he quickly diverted the topic: "Is Second Uncle in?"

"In, in," Wu Quan busily said. "Second Master Xuan is now the Paijia of this village, managing all matters of assigning duties and grain; busy as can be! You came at a good time, Old Sir; otherwise, he would be going out to handle matters in a while."

Chen Lin wondered in his heart: *It's almost dark; where is Second Uncle going to handle matters?* Ignoring these, he said: "I just returned from Guangzhou and want to pay respects to Second Uncle..."

"Good to say, good to say," Wu Quan nodded repeatedly and immediately instructed the young man: "Xiao Min, you go report!"

Chen Lin thought Second Uncle's airs were so big! In the past, clansmen didn't need to report to see the Clan Leader; at most, a shout at the door was enough.

After a short while, the young man came out and said: "Master Paijia says please let Ninth Master Lin enter."

His mood at this moment was quite complex. From this posture, Second Uncle held great power in the village and was obviously already an existence whose word was law.

Although Chen Lin was young, he understood the ways of the world. The world feared "a small man intoxicated by success" the most. Second Uncle now was an out-and-out small man intoxicated by success. His heart tightened involuntarily, secretly calculating if he and his father had offended him in the past.

Speaking of major offenses, it seemed there were none. After all, when he embezzled silk back then, they only suspended his duties and still gave him an allowance. But as an elder brother, Old Dad hadn't scolded this brother any less. When Second Aunt forced Second Uncle to write the divorce letter back then, Second Uncle cried in the Ancestral Hall wanting the clan elders to stand up for him. It was his dad who said the family was in the wrong; although the other party forcing a divorce letter was excessive, it was excusable.

The final decision for the clan not to stand up was a consensus of the elders, but the one who started it was Old Dad. If Second Uncle held a grudge for "taking away his wife"...

Thinking of this, Chen Lin broke into a cold sweat. It was chaotic times now. Once Second Uncle had power in hand, guarantee he wouldn't use public office to avenge private wrongs...

He secretly regretted coming to the Ancestral Hall to lodge; still too rash! Didn't consider the critical points before and after clearly!

But now it was impossible to say "not going"—this would only anger Second Uncle. He had to brace himself and follow the village brave in.

The inside of the Ancestral Hall was tidy. The spirit tablets of ancestors of various branches were enshrined intact, and there were offerings and incense candles on the altar table. It looked like someone was organizing and cleaning. Chen Lin felt slightly relieved: at least the Ancestral Hall was unharmed.

He was led to the three main rooms in the East Cross Courtyard—this was where the clan handled matters. In the past, Father only came here to handle matters. Now the courtyard remained, but the people had changed.

At this moment, Chen Lin's feelings were mixed, but the most important thing right now was himself. He steadied his mind, straightened his clothes and cap, and walked in.

Second Uncle Chen Xuan was sitting squarely on the Grand Preceptor Chair. This famous profligate of the Chen family was not yet forty, but years of loose living had made the skin and flesh on his face loose. Generally speaking, direct descendants of such local farming-reading clans mostly had dignified appearances. Chen Xuan, however, had a sinister face. As he aged and his flesh loosened, with drooping eyes and brows, he appeared increasingly insidious and cunning.

After entering, Chen Lin paid his respects respectfully and called out: "Second Uncle."

"You came back." Chen Xuan looked that this nephew up and down, saw the white cloth wrapped around his waist (mourning), harrumphed, and said: "Smooth journey?"

"Smooth journey." Chen Lin thought since Second Uncle had become the Australians' Paijia, he might as well flatter him on this. "Speaking of which, the road was much more peaceful than in the past. There were militia patrols and sentries everywhere along the way. The common people looked quiet too. The Australians indeed govern with method."

"Naturally," Chen Xuan was quite proud of his choice. "Worthy Nephew came from Guangzhou; I wonder how the situation in Guangzhou is?"

"It can be called 'River clear and Sea calm' (peaceful times)." Seeing Second Uncle liked listening, Chen Lin couldn't care about being mushy now. "If the world could be like Guangzhou, it would truly be a rare prosperous age..."

"Hahaha," Chen Xuan laughed loudly. "Worthy Nephew speaks well. The Australians are indeed formidable!" He restrained his smile and asked: "Tell me about the situation in Guangzhou."

"I wonder which aspects Second Uncle wants to hear?"

"Pick the important big events to say!"

Seeing Second Uncle liked to listen, Chen Lin selected major events after the Australians entered the city to narrate one by one, and also spoke of the Australians' administration and managing people, especially the New Life Movement. Chen Xuan listened with fascination. Chen Lin spoke for almost an hour before being interrupted.

"Interesting! Interesting! It seems what they said is true!" Chen Xuan sighed with emotion. "I originally thought it was somewhat exaggerated. Unexpectedly, Worthy Nephew came and solved my confusion! Good! Good!"

Chen Lin didn't know who "they" in Second Uncle's mouth were, nor where exactly was "Good." But he immediately thought of what his sister said: the ones managing the weaving workshop were Short-hairs. The so-called "they" probably referred to these people.

He responded with a vague "Yes."

Chen Xuan turned the conversation and asked: "Have you gone to visit your dad's grave?"

"Yes." Chen Lin quickly stood up. "I only hate that I was in Guangzhou at the time and failed to personally handle Father's funeral affairs; it all relied on the uncles and clan relatives..."

"Big Brother died miserably," Chen Xuan put on a deeply grieving appearance. "The clan and village were all ruined by chaotic soldiers, and several elders also passed away. Thanks to the Australians' trust, now only I can shoulder this heavy burden."

"Yes, thanks to Second Uncle's utmost efforts, Nansha Village is kept safe up and down."

Chen Xuan glanced at this nephew, secretly feeling proud in his heart—*You father and son were polite to me on the surface in the past, but when did you ever look at me straight in the heart? Now even a dragon has to coil for me!*
