# Chapter 2673: The Capital (Part 29)

A few days after the fleet departed Yangzhou, Jin Wenchi's forgery project reached completion. Several meticulously crafted documents lay spread upon the table, and Wang Yehao clicked his tongue in amazement. "I never imagined the Teacher possessed such remarkable craftsmanship—truly the work of supernatural skill."

"The Master flatters me," Jin Wenchi replied with practiced modesty, though his manner betrayed obvious pride as he displayed his handiwork for Wang Yehao's inspection. "My ancestors plied their trade in scroll mounting and stone inscription rubbings. Before I took up studies for the examinations, I learned a few rudimentary techniques. This paper surface is assembled from layers peeled and mounted from the old letters you provided, Master, so the signatures and seals are all genuine. The seams where the pieces join have been disguised as natural fold marks—none but an expert could detect them. As for the handwriting, I employed the method of stone-tracing; every character derives from an authentic source, with only slight modifications to connect the strokes at their beginnings and endings."

Wang Yehao listened and praised him warmly. "The Teacher's talents were truly wasted before now."

"Fabricating a few documents presents no difficulty. However, according to court statutes, a Duke's or Marquis's petition for parental care concerns matters of title inheritance. Such documents must exist in triplicate. The copies for father and son go without saying, but one must also be preserved in the official archives. I have prepared all three copies, but as for the matter of inserting them into the archives—might the Master have some clever method in mind?" Jin Wenchi posed the thorny problem.

"The Teacher need not worry about this matter; I have my own means." Wang Yehao showed little concern. With Fourth Uncle's connections and resources, if he couldn't manage even this small task, how could he have risen to his current position? After discussing the title inheritance with Mr. Zhou previously, Wang Yehao had already dispatched Liu Zhao to send a message through the Jinyiwei's secret courier lines via flying pigeon to communicate with his Fourth Uncle, Wang Xiantong. Wang Xiantong had agreed quite readily, and his reply had arrived just two days ago—hence Wang Yehao's present confidence.

"A trifling skill, hardly worth mentioning before the Master." Jin Wenchi expressed his humility. "I have harbored certain doubts of late; I wonder if I might venture to ask?"

"You and I are master and staff, joined as one body. Speak freely, Teacher."

"Since the Master grants permission, I shall be direct. I have always heard it said that those who undertake great matters must plan for defeat before planning for victory. What chance of success does the Master believe he has in this endeavor?"

Jin Wenchi's question stirred waves of uncertainty in Wang Yehao's heart. Indeed, if the Sorcerer's prophecy proved unreliable, death was certain. Yet recent events had convinced him the gamble was worth taking. After all, should he win this wager, the rewards would be beyond measure. Wang Yehao considered for a moment and decided it was better not to mention the matter of foreknowledge—explaining that would prove far too troublesome. "I believe that to bring order from chaos, we must gather men of insight from throughout the court and the *Jianghu* to uphold righteousness together in common cause."

"What the Master says is most true!" Jin Wenchi voiced his agreement. "Though I am unworthy, I am willing to devote myself body and soul to assist in this righteous undertaking!"

"Though it be a righteous cause, this matter still demands caution." Wang Yehao chuckled, as though some amusing thought had crossed his mind. "I have adopted an alias: 'Stone Old Man' [*Shi Weng*]. When the Teacher acts on my behalf, perhaps you might also conceal your name temporarily, lest word spread abroad and invite trouble."

"The Master speaks wisely." Jin Wenchi agreed at once. "Since the Master is 'Stone Old Man,' I shall style myself 'Jinshi' [Metal-Stone]."

"Excellent. Why not call yourself 'Jinshi Daoist'? Assuming the guise of one beyond the secular world will make it more convenient to act."

"All shall be as the Master arranges!"

After settling matters with Jin Wenchi, Wang Yehao summoned the butler and instructed him, "Have the boat travel more slowly; steadiness is paramount."

He had intentionally scheduled their arrival in the capital for early August. This would spare him the trouble of navigating uncertain waters with the Eunuch Party while the political situation remained unclear. Should Mr. Zhou's prophecy prove true and a new sovereign ascend the throne, he could avoid giving anyone leverage against him. If the prophecy failed, he had also made arrangements: the moment Liu Zhao received the coded message, he would silence the Hearthstone Daoist and his disciple, then eliminate Jin, Wei, and the two maidservants to remove any future complications.

After Jin Wenchi departed, Wang Yehao handed two of the documents to Wang Liang and instructed him, "Take a small boat north immediately. Bring extra boatmen and travel day and night. You must deliver these documents personally into Fourth Uncle's hands."

"I shall leave at once!"

"Also, find some way to establish connections with Prince Xin's residence. There are always minor eunuchs mingling about the markets—make friends among them." He continued, "Once you have cultivated familiarity, try to establish a line to Consort Tian, claiming we are old acquaintances of her maiden family. Do not stint on silver; all the silver in the residence may be used. There is no upper limit this time."

"I understand." Hearing of such a lucrative assignment, joy spread visibly across Wang Liang's brow.

"Speed is essential!" Wang Yehao emphasized again, his expression grave.

That year's winter proved exceptionally harsh. Wang Yehao sat alone in the heated pavilion, warming himself by the fire, while snowflakes drifted intermittently beyond the windows. When news arrived last month that the Nine Thousand Years had hanged himself, Wang Yehao felt no surprise whatsoever. Ever since the late Emperor had passed away on the eleventh day of the eighth month, Wang Yehao had become convinced that the Immortal's prophecy would be fulfilled. The subsequent ascension of Prince Xin, the adoption of the reign title Chongzhen, the dismissal of the Wei Traitor—each event in the unfolding sequence only strengthened his confidence.

Reflecting on the treacherous court intrigues of the past half-year, Wang Yehao felt profound relief that he had placed his wager correctly. Though he had scarcely any prior association with the Donglin Party, he had since built a solid foundation, supplemented by judicious distributions of silver along the way, and now maintained quite favorable relations.

The current Emperor had not only reopened the unjust cases prosecuted during the Eunuch Party's reign but had also restored many officials who had been squeezed out and suppressed in those dark days. Given the present trajectory, the Donglin faction's ascendancy over the court was already a foregone conclusion.

Wang Yehao, who had distinguished himself of late and rescued the daughter of Wei Dazhong, had naturally become a rising star in court circles. Yet he showed no eagerness for promotion, maintaining instead a posture of considerable modesty. This was not genuine humility on Wang Yehao's part, but rather a clear recognition of his circumstances: he was merely a *Tong Jinshi* by background and affiliated with the "Zhejiang Party." In recent years, considerable ambiguity had existed between the Zhejiang Party and the Eunuch Party, and strictly speaking, many entanglements remained. Were he to rise too rapidly while the court situation remained turbulent, he would not only cultivate an image of opportunism but also provoke the resentment of the old Donglin guard, making his position difficult to sustain. Better to "store grain widely and build walls high," winning hearts fully now, then exert his strength when circumstances naturally aligned. Moreover, with the Hearthstone Daoist's assistance, perhaps he might even receive the Nine Bestowments [*Jiu Xi*] in time...

No, no—the Nine Bestowments was too outlandish; that was the standard prerogative of rebellious ministers and usurpers. He harbored no such thoughts. But to be enfeoffed as a Marquis and appointed a Minister, with noble titles for his wife and protection for his sons—now that was worth contemplating...

Speaking of this "Immortal" (since Wei Zhongxian's suicide, Wang Yehao had privately elevated the man from "Sorcerer" to "Immortal"), he somewhat regretted letting him depart for Guangzhou. Half a year of separation had now passed, and though word of his safety had arrived, no letters detailing his specific circumstances had followed.

Wang Yehao felt vaguely uneasy. After all, Immortal Zhou had never spoken about the court's future direction. One careless misstep could render all his efforts meaningless. Wang Yehao watched the charcoal flames flicker in the stove and murmured softly to himself, "It seems I must bring 'Mr. Hearthstone' back."

He had already dispatched men to Guangzhou to locate Liu Zhao and sent others to Dongyang to escort the two maidservants to the capital. Based on his own quiet observation and reports from the serving women, he knew that Mr. Zhou was pure by nature. Though somewhat lecherous, he showed extreme tenderness and devotion toward his own women. Since these two maids had been intimate with him, they would serve as suitable leverage.

"Master, your Fourth Uncle has sent someone with pastries." Wang Liang entered the heated pavilion, interrupting Wang Yehao's contemplation, and set a food box on the table.

"Oh? Did the messenger bring any word?" Wang Yehao inquired.

"Nothing else—only that the Master should sample this specialty from *Guangli*."

"Very well. Go and reward him with some silver. Close the door; I shall receive no guests today."

After obtaining the forged documents from Jin Wenchi, Wang Xiantong had swiftly smoothed the way, and the title inheritance had succeeded. Though public opinion made it impolitic for Wang Yehao to associate too openly with his Fourth Uncle—who held a post in the Jinyiwei—this posed no obstacle to the private deepening of their relationship. Wang Yehao had informed his Fourth Uncle that he had sent agents to Guangzhou Prefecture and wished to borrow the Jinyiwei's communication lines to await a reply. The arrival of this food box clearly signaled news.

Wang Yehao opened the box. Inside lay several pieces of Cantonese-style walnut cookies, though they appeared far from fresh—some had even grown moldy. These treats were obviously not meant for eating. Wang Yehao broke the cookies apart and, as expected, discovered a paper scroll concealed within one of them.

Checking the signature, he found this was news dispatched by Liu Zhao in October. It reported that neither he nor his companion had yet located the Australians or the Universe Mirror in Guangzhou Prefecture. They currently had no leads to pursue, and Mr. Zhou remained unwilling to return to the capital.

Wang Yehao examined the remaining walnut cookies but found no other information. He read the text on the paper scroll once more with care, then cast it into the stove.

The court situation had shifted with dizzying speed these past few months. Were it not for the New Year festivities, Wang Yehao would rarely have found opportunity for such unhurried reflection at home. Official matters could now be entrusted to Jin Wenchi with reasonable confidence. But grasping the broader direction required the Immortal's guidance, and clandestine operations required Liu Zhao. With both men absent, his work proceeded less smoothly than he would have liked. Only when Wang Liang knocked at the door as the lamps were being lit to inquire about dinner did Wang Yehao withdraw from his reverie.

"Prepare a gift. Tomorrow you will accompany me to Fourth Uncle's residence to pay my respects." Wang Yehao issued his instructions. "Have dinner sent here."

The following day, Wang Yehao observed the proper etiquette of a junior calling upon a senior and arrived at Wang Xiantong's residence early in the morning. His ventures in Guangdong and Jiangnan had proven abundantly profitable, leaving him quite well-off of late. The gift inventory he had prepared today was correspondingly generous—this Fourth Uncle who served in the Jinyiwei had now inherited his noble title, and there would be many occasions to seek his counsel in the future. The favor must be rendered in full measure.

Ever since the High Ancestor, Old Man Hairi [Wang Hua], had won the *Zhuangyuan* title, examination success had grown increasingly rare through the four generations of "Shou, Zheng, Cheng, Xian" in the Wang family. Though Wang Yehao held only a *Tong Jinshi* degree, this distinction stood unique in the "Ye" generation, and Wang Xiantong had always looked upon this nephew with particular favor. Combined with the recent assistance in securing his title, Wang Xiantong paid special attention to today's visit and personally welcomed Wang Yehao in the entrance hall.

Sending walnut cookies one day and paying a visit the next—obviously there was something to discuss. After exchanging a few pleasantries, Wang Xiantong caught Wang Yehao's meaningful glance, led him to the inner study, and dismissed the attendants.

"I must trouble Fourth Uncle with a certain matter." Since this was to be a confidential conversation, Wang Yehao wasted no time with circumlocution.
