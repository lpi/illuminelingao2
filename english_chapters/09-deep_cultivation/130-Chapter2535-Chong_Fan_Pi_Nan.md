# Chapter 2535: Thoroughfare, Busy, Wearying, Difficult

"Councilor Wei, Chief Zhang is looking for you!" Chen Wuren shouted to Wei Bifu, who was drowsy behind the rosewood desk.

There were more than ten "Councilors" in the Councilor's Office of Guangzhou Special City, but there was actually not much "official business" to handle here. Most of the time, they came to work if they wanted to, and stayed home if they didn't. Several of the Councilors had actually found other ways out, either becoming small farm owners in the countryside or running businesses. But regardless of having a way out or not, Councilors could not resign and had to sign in and attend meetings at the Councilor's Office every week.

Wei Bifu didn't run any industry, but when several enterprises of the Violet mark issued non-preferred stocks in Guangzhou in the past, he bought quite a few. The annual dividends were quite generous. Coupled with his abundant savings from his past official career, his life was very passable. Just to reflect his "activeness," as long as it was a workday, whether there was something or not, he came to wander around the Councilor's Office every day. After Zhang Xiao took office, he came every day even more—staying for a whole day. He had a premonition that Senator Zhang would definitely summon him to consult on the local situation.

Hearing that Zhang Xiao wanted to summon him, he stood up with a jolt, took off his glasses, and touched his face with his hand. He ordered his servant:

"Fetch water!"

The servant hurriedly fetched him a basin of face-washing water. He wiped his face, scrutinized himself in the mirror, and felt his spirit was good before walking out of his office.

After Zhang Xiao entered the city, he was so busy that his front foot didn't leave his back heel. He hadn't spoken a word to him for several days. Just when he suspected if his judgment had problems and the new Chief had forgotten him, he suddenly sent someone to summon him—this must be to ask for his advice. Although Wei Bifu hadn't been an official in the Great Ming for long, the political sense cultivated by years of ups and downs in officialdom made him quite sensitive to recent personnel changes in the Guangzhou Municipal Government.

"Where there are people, there is Jianghu; this Great Song officialdom is not so calm either." Wei Bifu lamented in his heart.

Zhang Xiao was very polite: "Councilor Wei, sit! Sit! Don't be so restrained."

Wei Bifu knew the Australians didn't like empty formalities, so he honestly pulled a stool and sat down.

"When Councilor Wei was in the Ming State, how long did you serve in Guangzhou Prefecture?" Zhang Xiao asked.

"I am ashamed to say, when the Heavenly Army entered the city, this student had just taken office, totaling no more than a year," Wei Bifu said.

Zhang Xiao was slightly disappointed: less than half a year total; that was too short. How much could he know about the local situation? Moreover, a Vice Prefect was an auxiliary official, not the principal official. He assisted the Prefect in managing part of local affairs and wouldn't grasp the comprehensive situation enough.

His disappointment was immediately seen by Wei Bifu. Wei Bifu was an old hand in officialdom, extremely shrewd. He knew the Chief Zhang in front of him most tabooed subordinates being "excessively shrewd," so he just played dumb, looking like he was "waiting for instruction."

How could Zhang Xiao know the twists and turns in his belly? Disappointment aside, to understand Nanhai County's situation, there was only this person in front of him. At the moment, he concealed his emotions and asked, "In that case, you don't know too much about the situation of this Nanhai County either."

"If speaking of the situation of Nanhai County, what this student knows is indeed limited. However, having taken office for a year, I am aware of the general situation within Nanhai and Panyu counties."

"Then I trouble you to speak about the geography and people's conditions of Nanhai County."

Wei Bifu thought for a moment and said, "If the Chief wants this student to summarize the situation of Nanhai County, this place deserves the four words: 'Thoroughfare, Busy, Wearying, Difficult.'"

"Oh?" Zhang Xiao asked again, "Tell me, what is 'Thoroughfare, Busy, Wearying, Difficult'?"

"Replying to the Chief, being a key passage is Thoroughfare; having multifarious administrative affairs is Busy; having many tax arrears is Wearying; having unruly people and customs and many lawsuits and robbery cases is Difficult. This is the most important county in Guangzhou Prefecture, and even Guangdong Province."

With just four words, Wei Bifu refined the basic situation of Nanhai. Zhang Xiao couldn't help showing a trace of respect for the ability of this former Ming magistrate. It seemed Chongzhen didn't lack talent.

In the history of the old timeline, using Thoroughfare, Busy, Wearying, Difficult to evaluate prefectures and counties only existed in the Qing Dynasty. However, obviously, this assessment wasn't a sudden invention by someone; it's not surprising that people thought of these in the late Ming.

Nanhai County has a dense population and is the economic and political hinterland of Guangdong. Coupled with the characteristics of "Thoroughfare, Busy, Wearying, Difficult," the magnitude and difficulty of its governance can be imagined.

"Being a key passage, I can understand this." Zhang Xiao tapped his fingers on the table in turn as if playing the piano, saying, "The West River and North River both flow through this county. The water network is dense with countless tributaries. Nanhai jurisdiction reaches Huashan in the north and Jiujiang in the south, with a straight-line distance exceeding a hundred li; it borders Sanshui in the west and Guangzhou City in the east. Commercial intercourse is the most in Guangdong. People are the source of all things; many people make it easy for things to happen, especially the floating population. But how do you explain 'multifarious administrative affairs'?"

Hearing this question, Wei Bifu understood that this new Chief was not very clear about administrative affairs, so he said: "The Ming State regulations state that except during busy farming seasons, the County Magistrate must receive lectures from superiors every month, such as Imperial Edicts, laws, and moral exhortations, and then pass them on to elders in various forts and even the populace; lead scholars to sacrifice to the Confucian Temple and Heaven and Earth every month; the literary style of this county is the peak of Lingao, with many academies. The triennial provincial examination is also the responsibility of the Magistrate. Since it occupies half of Guangzhou City, effort must also be exerted for the metropolitan examination; needless to say about the asylum needed and the Hall of Chaste Women; the West and North rivers flow through this county, and since the Jiajing reign, Guanyaojiao and Lubaochong have gradually silted up, causing frequent floods, often requiring relief to soothe people's hearts. Being able to build one or two water conservancy projects makes one a great official; in addition, there is arresting bandits, collecting taxes, welcome and send-off..."

Zhang Xiao felt his head swelling just listening to this pile of things. Ming dynasty officials and clerks were separated; only officials and a few "permanent staff" were supported by finances. More than ninety percent of the people in the entire county government were unpaid. Moreover, the local fiscal problem in the Ming Dynasty had actually always been ambiguous. The magistrate had heavy responsibilities but very few resources. If it were a remote place like Lingao, life would actually be easier. In a "Thoroughfare" and "Busy" place like Nanhai County, being a magistrate had great prospects, but work pressure was also great. Hence the saying of "Busy" and "Difficult."

What about changing to now? The Senate at least equipped him with far more established personnel than the Ming Dynasty, and he didn't need to worry about paying wages. Vain things like moral exhortations, sacrificing to the Confucian Temple, and sacrificing to ghosts and gods were also exempted. Civil servant training and selection were now responsible by the Guangzhou Cadre School, local security was supported by the Guangdong Region National Army, and tax collection was led by the Guangzhou Finance and Tax Bureau. The disadvantage was that cross-departmental matters were easiest to pass the buck on; doing well wasn't easy, and doing badly meant taking the blame. As for welcome and send-off, now that a thousand things waited to be done, the Senate hadn't become bureaucratic to the degree of the Ming and Qing dynasties. There shouldn't be much feasting superiors and colleagues or taking friends in officialdom to tour mountains and play in water.

The remaining education, health, water conservancy, and developing the local economy should be where he could achieve results.

However, according to the requirements of the Senate's hardship-edition modern government, the heaviness of these tasks was not inferior.

Sure enough, a thousand threads above, one needle below.

Zhang Xiao continued to ask, "I've long heard Nanhai and Panyu are the first-class wealthy lands under heaven. Taxes are also not as heavy as Su, Song, Chang, and Tai [Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, Taicang]. Why are there still many arrears?"

"The Chief must also know: official-merchant collusion to evade commercial tax; *Guiji* [registering land under another's name] and *Feisa* [shifting tax burden]. Land of powerful families increases daily, people paying tax decrease daily," Wei Bifu said.

Zhang Xiao nodded. He had seen these methods in Lingao too; they were once key problems in the tax reform of Lingao and Hainan.

Official-merchant collusion in the late Ming was very serious. Some smuggling ships could pass for maritime trade by paying enough money to the government. Conversely, those regular ships, if they didn't pay money, would be blackmailed to pay tax with various reasons. *Guiji* was a method where owner-peasants and small landlords falsely reported their land under the name of gentry with tax exemption privileges to evade corvee and tax. *Feisa* was landlords colluding with the government to break up land tax into zero and scatter it onto other farmers' land to evade tax. Over time, the pockets of officials and gentry became bulge, while the silver in the national treasury became less day by day.

"How to fill the owed tax?"

Wei Bifu said, "The Chief probably doesn't know 'Fixed-Bow Empty Tax' (*Dinggong Xushui*). The bitterness and exhaustion of Yue people, nothing surpasses the Dinggong of Nanhai. The name Dinggong is unique to Nanhai."

"Oh? What is the explanation for 'Fixed-Bow Empty Tax'?" Zhang Xiao asked.

"In the ninth year of Wanli, Nanhai land was surveyed. Water rushed and caused collapse. Calculating based on the quota of more than 15,400 *qing* of this county in the sixth year of Longqing, the lost quota was 1,828 *qing*. At that time, those in charge dared not report the loss. Compelled to make up the full amount, they used the actual measured land of the ninth year of Wanli, recognizing eight *fen* three *li* six *hao* [0.0836 of a unit, likely *qing* or large *mu*] as one *mu*, adding an empty tax of one *fen* six *li* four *hao* per *mu* to make up the number of lost measurement. This is where the name of Dinggong came from. To make up the lost quota, it was 400 *qing* more than the original quota of Longqing. Nanhai County added a total of 2,228 *qing* of Dinggong Empty Tax, assigning more than 7,780 taels of silver every year, all belonging to levy without land. Supplementing successively, it is still not full amount. Until now, for fifty years, the people paying empty tax have paid more than 300,000 gold. The power of Nanhai people is exhausted." Wei Bifu finished speaking, not forgetting to drag out the ending sound, appearing sincere and earnest.

Zhang Xiao sneered, "There are really many tricks in this. I think it's not as simple as water rushing and causing collapse. You officials probably took quite a few benefits, right?"

Wei Bifu immediately became nervous, thinking that he had only taken office for less than a year, just eating hotpot and singing songs when the Kun thieves attacked; how much silver could he have embezzled? Even the "share" he should have received hadn't come to hand.

Just as he was pondering how to respond, Zhang Xiao didn't tangle much on this issue and asked, "With such a heavy burden, do the local gentry have no opinion?"

"Chief sees clearly: gentry and commoners in the county deeply complain about this matter. The original Nanhai Magistrate Huang Xiyin was good friends with the original Guangzhou Prefecture Judge Yan Junyan. The two once discussed this matter, so Brother Yan petitioned, begging to follow the clear example of the Grace Edict *Statutes*, asking to exempt the Dinggong Empty Grain Tax to relieve the long-brewing distress."
