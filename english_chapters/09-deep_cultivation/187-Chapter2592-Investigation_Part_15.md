# Chapter 2592 - Investigation (Part 15)

What Zheng Xiaoyu said was indeed fact. To control drug distribution from the source—especially for pharmaceutical endpoints beyond the Senate's direct control—the Health Ministry implemented a management system.

First was standardized prescriptions. All medical institutions were required to use standard prescription pads with recorded issuance. Voided forms had to be retained. To obtain new ones, old stubs had to be surrendered. This system applied regardless of self-pay or public funding, whether controlled or not, whether Chinese patent medicine or Australian drug. As long as a medicine was listed in the *Senate's Authorized Pharmacopoeia* and the medical institution was under Senate management, compliance was mandatory.

Among these, prescriptions for controlled substances were specially printed—not only with anti-counterfeiting marks but sequential serial numbers. Prescription forms issued by medical institutions all had stubs retained. When necessary, stubs could be used to audit against prescriptions at dispensing facilities.

Hearing he wanted controlled substance prescription forms, Zheng Xiaoyu knew the fish was starting to bite.

However, he didn't yet know if this was the big fish Elder Zheng wanted to catch—after all, far too many people coveted the Senate's controlled medicines.

"Rest assured, little brother. These prescriptions won't be used at Bailing Tang." He Jun smiled as he poured wine. "These prescription forms are significant—how could I not know? How would I implicate you? Let me tell you: someone is willing to pay cash for these prescription forms. One yuan per form. Just sell a few forms to him, and it's pure silver in hand!"

"One yuan each? Really?!" Zheng Xiaoyu's surprise wasn't feigned this time. As a physician and local medical institution manager for the Senate, he naturally knew how much profit these prescription forms involved. But he'd never imagined anyone would pay such high prices for a single form.

These people were really generous! As a mid-level naturalized citizen cadre, Zheng Xiaoyu earned only a dozen yuan monthly. A prescription pad was twenty-five forms—selling one pad nearly equaled two months' income. He couldn't help feeling a twinge of... injustice.

His expression was noted by He Jun, who knew there was hope. He immediately served him more food: "Little brother, think about it—isn't this business easy? A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get rich!"

Zheng Xiaoyu was puzzled: "There's something I don't understand. These prescriptions all have serial numbers. Even if Bailing Tang doesn't use them—if they're sold to others—won't problems emerge during audits?"

He Jun laughed: "Brother, you don't need to worry about that. The prescription forms naturally won't be issued in Bailing Tang's name. As for audits, you should know better than I—they only check whether stubs and prescriptions match between clinics and pharmacies, not which prescription corresponds to which clinic. Here, checking is straightforward since there are only two clinics that can prescribe controlled drugs, and only one pharmacy. But what about bigger places?"

---

Zheng Xiaoyu's heart trembled, thinking he was right. If it were Guangzhou or Lingao, there were over a dozen institutions that could issue controlled prescriptions and four or five pharmacies that could dispense. Daily pharmacy traffic might involve a hundred controlled substance prescriptions. Over several months, that meant thousands or tens of thousands. One prescription form from an out-of-town clinic mixed in—without targeted inspection, it would be completely undetectable.

Seeing Zheng Xiaoyu's hesitant expression, He Jun thought he was tempted and continued his persuasion: Tear off a few forms per pad; don't take complete pads. Mixed among hundreds or thousands of documents, who would notice?

"...Even if someone really discovers it, who knows how many years will have passed. By then, this Joint Clinic might not even exist." He Jun laughed. "Elder brother may not understand other things, but two phrases I understand: 'quit while you're ahead' and 'of the thirty-six stratagems, fleeing is best.' When the time comes, just push everything onto me. At worst, you'll get a negligence charge—even the Ming would only dock your salary for a few years."

After this speech, never mind that Zheng Xiaoyu was deliberately "falling"—even a proper naturalized citizen cadre couldn't resist. Zheng Xiaoyu pretended to hesitate for a while, then finally showed a decisive expression: "Since you have use for them, apply. Make sure the paperwork is complete."

"Understood. Elder brother absolutely won't make things difficult for you." He Jun beamed. "Rest assured, the benefits here are enormous—I definitely won't shortchange you. Do you prefer silver dollars, notes, or silver ingots? Elder brother will prepare whatever you like. If you want a house or a beauty..."

"Houses and beauties are nice but too conspicuous. I'm someone who makes a few dozen yuan a month—not appropriate, not appropriate."

"Since that's the case, elder brother will prepare a reliable method for you."

He Jun said he was planning to quietly purchase a residence in Boluo county, with all deeds registered under an unrelated person's name.

"...All profits will be sent there." At this point, Zheng Xiaoyu suddenly remembered something and asked: "Are you married, little brother?"

"Not yet."

"Then, do you have any family?"

Zheng Xiaoyu smiled bitterly: "I'm an orphan. I only survived thanks to the Senate's assistance. Where would I have family?"

"Ah, I didn't realize you also have a bitter fate!" He Jun sighed.

"Honestly, if I weren't desperate, who would..." Zheng Xiaoyu stopped mid-sentence. This wasn't him playing a role or baiting a hook—it was genuine sentiment.

Unexpectedly, this blend of real and fake inner revelation only increased He Jun's interest. Someone willing to share their background was essentially "meeting sincerity with sincerity." He immediately poured more wine for Zheng Xiaoyu: "Brother, you must have come from a distinguished family? Your manners and speech don't resemble those rough folk."

This truly hit a sensitive spot. Zheng Xiaoyu rarely discussed his background unless Elders or superiors asked. When ordinary people inquired, he was always vague. First, he didn't want to bring up painful memories. Second, he felt his origins were different from many naturalized citizens—saying it might make him seem out of place with colleagues.

"I'm embarrassed to say—I came from a scholarly farming family." Zheng Xiaoyu sighed. "My ancestors once passed the provincial examination and had some local reputation. Unfortunately, my grandfather offended a local gentry over a feng shui plot, and our family was ruined. Family members died or fled. I also drifted until I reached Guangzhou. Fortunately, the Chiefs took me in—otherwise I wouldn't be here today!"

"I see." He Jun said. "Now you finally have a chance to turn things around!" He lowered his voice: "Now that the Australians are here, it doesn't matter what background you have—gentry, wealthy family, whatever. As long as you have money, that's all that matters! You must seize this opportunity."

"Yes, yes. I'll also need to rely on elder brother."

He Jun shook his head: "What are you saying? I need to rely on you!" His tone became melancholy: "Though I have some ancestral property, in this Huizhou Prefecture I'm not considered some wealthy family. Just getting by on this bit of inherited property. But my family's burdens are heavy. Of my eight siblings, counting those who married out, my brothers all died young one after another. The orphans and widows all depend on me. Otherwise, I would never... never..." Here he stopped abruptly and drank a gulp of wine. "Look at me, spouting such dreary nonsense again!"

Zheng Xiaoyu had already learned He Jun's background from Political Security. He hadn't lied. Of He Jun's five brothers, only he survived. The dozen-plus remaining orphans and widows all depended on him. Recently, one of his sisters had also passed away. He Jun couldn't bear to see his nephews and nieces suffer, so he took them in to raise.

Even with a pharmacy that made him one of Huizhou's wealthy, such heavy family burdens—no wonder he'd stake everything on such risky ventures.

Zheng Xiaoyu thought: regardless of whether his actions were legal, his conduct alone showed he was someone who valued family deeply. Honestly, if this weren't a performance, he'd be worth befriending. He felt secret regret, because once this was exposed, He Jun's best outcome would be exile overseas.

He Jun, unaware of his complex emotions, continued sighing to himself: "...My Bailing Tang may be called a century-old establishment, but in Huizhou it's just an ordinary raw medicine shop. The shopkeeper and clerks aren't very capable—just honest and loyal."

Zheng Xiaoyu said pointedly: "Elder brother's devotion to family, raising orphans single-handedly—that's already admirable! But though this business can make money, directly selling drugs out might cause problems..."

He Jun said: "Don't worry, little brother. Since we're now sworn brothers, we're family. I won't hide it from you. These extracted medicines naturally can't be sold directly—they need to be repackaged." With that, he produced a small bottle.

The bottle was very familiar. Zheng Xiaoyu looked and exclaimed in surprise: "Lushi Powder?!"

"Oh? You know this medicine too?"

Zheng Xiaoyu hastily explained: "This medicine is now famous. It's sold everywhere in Guangzhou Prefecture. They say it's incredibly effective..."

"Hehe, this Lushi Powder was originally a patent medicine from the local Wanchun Quan. It has over a hundred years of history. The efficacy was just ordinary. Now they say it's effective because of Australian miracle drugs..."

"So that's it!" Zheng Xiaoyu nodded repeatedly. "Dissolve the drugs and mix them in—completely concealed."

"Clever, brother!" Zheng Xiaoyu nodded. "It's just that these Australian miracle drugs aren't easy to obtain—supplies come and go. With you joining now, the future looks bright! Hahahaha."

Zheng Xiaoyu affected surprise: "So elder brother isn't the one in charge?"

He Jun laughed: "How could I, your foolish brother, manage such a big operation? To be honest: someone else is running this business—someone with connections reaching to the heavens, extremely powerful." At this point, he seemed to realize he'd said too much. "There's plenty of time ahead. Just do your work well, little brother—you won't be shortchanged!"
