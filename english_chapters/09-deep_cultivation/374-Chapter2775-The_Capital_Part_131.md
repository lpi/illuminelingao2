# Chapter 2775: The Capital (Part 131)

Xu Yong spat out the grass stalk he had been chewing and slowly drew back from his vantage point.

Just minutes ago, he had sensed something amiss near the Zhou residence at Wanggong Factory.

Since Mr. Zhou's disappearance, his family still lived here, but this residence—once filled with laughter and warmth—had grown desolate and fearful, its former happiness extinguished entirely.

In the old days, Xu Yong had often accompanied Liu Zhao and Liu Sha on visits here. Mr. Zhou was an easygoing and engaging man who never put on the airs of a master. Each visit to his residence required no standing on ceremony, and there was always an abundance of good food to enjoy—the gentleman had a particular fondness for eating. With conversation flowing freely and laughter filling the rooms, these visits were far more pleasant than merely following Liu Sha and Liu Zhao on their errands. Whenever they mentioned going to the Zhou residence, Xu Yong could barely contain his eagerness.

Of course, his willingness to visit also stemmed from the chance to see Zhou Juli. Though Liu Sha had never said so explicitly, Xu Yong knew that the fair, chubby little girl cradled in Mr. Zhou's arms was his own younger sister.

So each time he visited the Zhou residence, he would find an opportunity to hold Zhou Juli and play with her. Whenever Juli smiled at him, he nearly wept.

Liu Sha had once hinted subtly: Zhou Juli was the gentleman's biological daughter, and her mother was Yui. The gentleman enjoyed Master Wang's high favor. Zhou Juli was now a young lady blessed with fine clothes and rich food, destined to marry into a good family someday.

Though Xu Yong was only a teenager, he understood the implication perfectly. He knew this affection of his could only remain buried in his heart, never to be revealed.

Juli had a good home. Following Liu Sha faithfully—though the work was hardly glorious—meant serving the master without worrying about food or shelter. Liu Sha treated him as a "closed-door disciple" and taught him many tricks of the *Jianghu* trade. With such skills, earning a living in the future would never be a problem.

Then one day, Mr. Zhou vanished without a trace. Xu Yong still remembered that day clearly—his master had summoned him, and together they came to the residence. Amid the weeping of women and children, they searched every corner of the house, sparing not even the private chambers of You Rong and Yui.

Afterward, under Liu Zhao's orders, all of Mr. Zhou's possessions—from clothes and hats to brushes and ink, along with every strange little gadget in his study—were gathered. Not a single item belonging to the gentleman was left behind. Everything was packed into boxes and carried away on the shoulders of porters from the coolie guild.

What remained in the residence were only the two concubines the gentleman had left behind, two children, and a handful of servants. From that day forward, the house knew no more laughter or joy.

Later, Xu Yong returned to the residence several times with Liu Sha or Zhou Lezhi. Young as he was, even he could feel the melancholy of familiar surroundings emptied of familiar faces. Whether Yui or You Rong, as soon as the visitors arrived, they would clutch at them frantically, demanding to know where the gentleman had gone. And each time, their pleas were met only with silence.

Zhou Lezhi always tried to comfort the two mistresses, but even in Xu Yong's eyes, such comfort was hollow at best. Meanwhile, the two children invariably stared at the visitors with wide, fearful eyes.

Unable to bear it, Xu Yong began bringing snacks and candies for the children on every visit. Fortunately, though Mr. Zhou was gone, Master Wang continued to provide for the family. They lacked neither food nor clothing, and servants were still sent to attend them. Zhou Lezhi and others also visited from time to time.

One day, Xu Yong could not help but ask Liu Sha: Where had Mr. Zhou gone? Was he dead?

Liu Sha countered with a question of his own: "Do you think Mr. Zhou is still alive?"

Xu Yong considered this for a moment. "Mr. Zhou is probably still alive."

"Oh? Why do you say that?"

"If Mr. Zhou were truly gone, why would Master Wang still bother caring for his family? He would have simply given them some silver and dismissed them long ago."

"You've got a cruel streak in you, boy!" Liu Sha laughed, though his face showed a hint of approval. "Perhaps it was Mr. Zhou's dying wish? Asking Master Wang to look after his family."

"In this apprentice's view, if that were truly the case, Master Wang would have sent them back to the estate in Jinhua to settle there rather than keeping them in the Capital. The fact that they remain here suggests Mr. Zhou is not only alive but likely still in the Capital—or at worst, somewhere within Northern Zhili..."

Keeping the family in the Capital for close supervision showed that Master Wang harbored concerns. He was also guarding against the possibility that Mr. Zhou might want to return home someday.

Liu Sha nodded slightly. "Your reasoning is sound. However, whether he is dead or alive, I'm afraid only Master Wang himself knows."

"Master Wang..." Xu Yong hesitated for a long time, uncertain whether he should continue.

"What is it you wish to say?"

"There is something—I don't know if Master is aware of it."

"What matter?"

Xu Yong lowered his voice. "Once, while this apprentice was waiting for orders at the Wang residence, I saw Wang Liang storm into the study and emerge again, muttering, 'This fellow has such audacious gall!'"

Liu Sha seemed unimpressed. "What is so remarkable about that?"

"At that time, only Mr. Zhou and Master Wang were in the study!"

Liu Sha's expression immediately grew tense. "What did they say?"

"This apprentice could not hear the conversation from the inner study," Xu Yong said. "But later, when Wang Liang and Wang Zhi were chatting, I overheard a few words. Roughly speaking, Mr. Zhou 'fell out with the Master over a woman.' They also mentioned a name—'Zhiling'..."

At this, Liu Sha's face changed dramatically. After a long silence, he instructed Xu Yong never to mention this matter to anyone again.

His master offered no explanation, but judging from his expression, he clearly knew why Master Wang and Mr. Zhou had quarreled. Xu Yong sensed vaguely that Mr. Zhou's disappearance was connected to this affair.

Though Mr. Zhou was gone, since Master Wang still cared for his family, his younger sister would be safe. Whether You Rong or Yui, both understood that the two children were their lifeline, and neither would mistreat them.

Liu Sha also instructed him to patrol the area around the Zhou residence at Wanggong Factory from time to time.

Two "widowed" women with young children—beautiful as flowers and jade, possessed of some wealth, yet without a man to head the household—attended by only a few servants. This was a succulent morsel that drew covetous eyes from all directions. Master Wang had made arrangements with the authorities, so the yamen and local *baojia* would not trouble them. But *Jianghu* characters cared nothing for such protections. Particularly those villains who specialized in abducting and trafficking vulnerable women watched the household with hungry anticipation.

The subtle approach involved teasing with words and exchanging letters, gradually luring them to pack their valuables and elope. If they refused to flee, the seducers would continue their intimate games while studying the household's routines. When the moment was right, they would break in and abduct both women and valuables. This was an established profession in the *Jianghu*, and the Capital harbored especially many such predators.

As for the residence's defenses—they could not be called lacking. After all, Liu Zhao was a veteran of the *Jianghu* who understood these dangers intimately. After receiving orders to clear out Mr. Zhou's belongings, he had dismissed most of the servants, retaining only two families of Wang household retainers to guard the doors and handle purchases. The main gate was kept tightly closed at all times. Except for daily shopping trips and removing waste, the doors never opened. As for those inside, they rarely ventured out. You Rong and Yui left the residence only once a month to burn incense. The Wang family stewards also inspected the premises periodically.

But as time passed, restlessness grew from prolonged confinement, and trouble naturally followed. Especially You Rong—over the past year, she had apparently lost hope of the gentleman's return and begun showing signs of unwillingness to remain lonely. Xu Yong knew that once she harbored such thoughts, someone would inevitably find an opening.

He cared nothing for You Rong's fate, but once disaster struck, the villains would not spare Yui and the two children either. To them, these were all premium "goods." Even if they only abducted You Rong, what if an angry Master Wang then withdrew his protection from Yui and the children? Xu Yong certainly lacked the means to raise his sister alone.

Therefore, he made a habit of circling the Zhou residence regularly, watching for suspicious characters.

Today, the moment he arrived near the residence, he spotted something amiss.

Three idlers had positioned themselves in a triangular formation along the street before the main gate. They appeared unconnected to one another, yet each kept his eyes fixed steadily on the Zhou residence's entrance.

Xu Yong recognized the signs of trouble. After observing for several minutes, he made his way to the back door.

The rear of the residence faced a deserted alley and a shabby street. Few people passed through even in broad daylight, yet today, unusually, a fruit stall had been set up not far from the back door.

While peddlers did sometimes work these back streets and quiet alleys, trading with servants from the residences, they were typically mobile vendors who called out their wares as they walked. No one set up a fixed stall in such a place.

The moment Xu Yong saw this peddler, he knew someone was targeting the Zhou residence.

Since they were only conducting surveillance, it meant they would not act immediately. Xu Yong slowly retreated a few steps, turned, and departed.

Neither Master Wang nor his own master had instructed him to guard the Zhou residence, but now that something suspicious lurked around it, he should logically report to his master at once.

However, his master had now vanished as completely as Mr. Zhou. The only person he could turn to for advice was Mr. Le.

Xu Yong dared not delay and immediately set off toward the Wanping County Yamen.

At the very moment he turned to leave, in a dilapidated house he had failed to notice, someone nodded in his direction. Two men dressed as street idlers immediately followed him, one ahead and one behind.

Though young, Xu Yong possessed considerable courage and had absorbed much from his master and Mr. Le. Despite the urgency of the situation, he knew that haste was precisely when one must not break protocol. Following his usual practice, he left Wanggong Factory but did not head north. Instead, he went east along the outer wall of the Elephant House toward Xuanwu Gate.

Circling through the corridor shops in the barbican of Xuanwu Gate, he detected the idlers tailing him. He immediately abandoned any thought of returning directly. Exiting Xuanwu Gate, he entered the Southern City and walked south until he reached Yongguang Temple.

Today happened to be the temple fair at Yongguang Temple. Xu Yong shook off his pursuers amid the crowds, then proceeded straight to Liulichang. Only after confirming he had lost his tail did he re-enter the Inner City through Zhengyang Gate, make a wide circle, and finally arrive at the Wanping County Yamen, slipping into a shabby alley beside it.

This narrow alley stretched on endlessly, its ground thick with mud and filth. The passage twisted and turned. Xu Yong navigated around a crooked elm tree and ducked into a well house at the side. He waited silently for several minutes, and only when certain no one had followed did he emerge. Beside the well house lay an inconspicuous side passage, just wide enough for one person to squeeze through. He entered it.
