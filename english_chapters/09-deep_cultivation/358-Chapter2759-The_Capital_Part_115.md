# Chapter 2759: The Capital (Part 115)

Yang Tianliang had a guilty conscience these days and dared not go to Yang Gonggong's residence at all. He even skipped the daily morning and evening greetings, only claiming he had "fallen seriously ill."

Wait, this Yang Gonggong didn't ask much, only sent someone to care: "Nurse your illness well," and asked nothing else.

This attitude made him both worried and relieved. Gains and losses worried him daily, not knowing what to do. Sometimes after a burst of heart palpitations, he thought about taking out that preorder ticket and fleeing.

However, thinking of the various things he would face after running away, Yang Tianliang hesitated again. After all, if he really ran away, this errand would be gone, and he would no longer be "a mouth in the palace" sufficient to make officials and gentry take out silver to bribe. Moreover, he entered the palace in his teens, and there was no one left in his family. There was no one to trust outside. Having been in the palace for many years, his voice and appearance had long been branded with distinct marks. Without the skin of a "eunuch," he feared it would be ominous.

Fortunately, there was nothing unusual in the palace, outside, or with his adoptive father these days. Except for Liu Sha disappearing as if evaporated from the world, everything was as usual. This more or less reassured him, and the thought of running away faded a lot.

His adoptive father suddenly wanted to see him. Yang Tianliang felt uneasy in his heart, hurriedly put on a sickly look, and called the messenger eunuch into the bedroom to question.

"Adoptive father calls child over; I wonder what instructions he has?" He leaned against the bed and said feebly.

"Replying to Dad," the small eunuch bowed, "Old Ancestor said he heard you were sick these days and was very worried. So he specially sent this small one over. If Dad's illness is lighter, Old Ancestor invites Dad to the residence for a chat; there are some important matters to discuss. If the body is still unwell, resting a few more days doesn't matter. Let Your Honor rest and nurse your body at ease."

"Please go and tell Adoptive Father that the child's illness has improved greatly these few days, and I will go to pay respects to Adoptive Father tomorrow." After speaking, he put on a very concerned look and asked: "Is Adoptive Father's body peaceful these days?"

"Old Ancestor's body is peaceful. Originally, Shopkeeper Leng of Delong was kidnapped, and he worried tight. Now hearing Shopkeeper Leng is back again, the person is also happy. Yesterday he even invited several Eunuchs and summoned a troupe to the residence to sing opera and drink for amusement."

"That's good." Yang Tianliang felt slightly relieved in his heart. On second thought, no second person knew about his conspiracy except Liu Sha, and there was no intersection between Liu Sha and Yang Gonggong, so Yang Gonggong shouldn't know.

Thinking of this, his originally sickly complexion instantly improved a lot. He instructed his subordinate to give a reward to the small eunuch. He pondered how to deal with his adoptive father tomorrow.

This "Adoptive Father" whom he originally cast aside like a worn shoe, he had to consider repairing the father-son relationship now. Silver, probably couldn't be obtained for a while. The errand with Wang Zhixin had to be thought of another way, but as long as he could maintain his status as an adopted son, Yang Gonggong's net worth would still be his in the future. As for when to get rid of him again, that was another matter.

Early the next morning, Yang Tianliang had breakfast and rushed to Yang Gonggong's residence to pay respects.

Yang Gonggong's complexion was quite good. Seeing him come to bow, he raised his hand smilingly: "You and I are father and son; how can we be so particular. The thought counts." He scrutinized him again, "Is the illness on your body fully recovered?"

"Yes." Yang Tianliang responded respectfully, "Child has been sick for a long time and hasn't come to pay respects for many days, feeling guilty in heart. Today the body is much better. Many thanks for Dad's concern."

"It's good that your body is well. You are also in your forties, not a young man anymore. Be careful with your body." Yang Gonggong appeared quite concerned, "Although we are halfway father and son, we have supported each other for more than twenty years after all."

"Yes. Dad's grace of upbringing and cultivation, Child dare not forget."

"You don't need to be so polite," Yang Gonggong said quite emotionally, "Back when Nine Thousand Years just took power, we father and son lost our errands in the palace, were driven around, and didn't even have a place to live. We tried desperately to maneuver before barely standing firm again in the palace. At that time, no matter how hard or poor, we worked together with one heart and never said a word of estrangement. Instead, these years of smooth sailing have made us somewhat estranged. Speaking of it, it's nothing more than for the word 'money'."

Yang Tianliang didn't know why his adoptive father suddenly brought up these old matters, but the words that followed were very heart-to-heart.

He opened his mouth, seeming to want to defend something, but Yang Gonggong signaled him not to speak. With just a pout, the small eunuch next to him immediately brought a lacquer tray with an envelope on it.

"Inside are Delong's notes, twenty thousand taels. Take it to buy your future." Yang Gonggong said here with endless emotion, "After you go to the Directorate of Imperial Horses, I'm afraid there will be many expenses below. You have to rely on yourself for this money."

Yang Tianliang never dreamed that Yang Gonggong would actually speak such heart-to-heart words to him and take out twenty thousand silver on the spot. One must know that back when he wanted to borrow these twenty thousand silver from his adoptive father, the two almost turned against each other for this. Why did this suddenly change character?

"Dad..."

"What, think it's too little?"

"No, dare not..." Yang Tianliang waved his hands hurriedly, "Child originally wanted to raise these silver myself, unexpectedly..."

"You don't need to say." Yang Gonggong sighed, "I have also thought it through now. I am a person over sixty; how many days can I live in the world? All these belongings will be yours in the future. Why separate so clearly! You want to serve in the Directorate of Imperial Horses; I won't stop you either. After all, your days are still long."

These words were sincere and made Yang Tianliang somewhat moved for a moment. He hurriedly knelt down to take the envelope, grateful to tears: "Dad's grace of cultivation, Child dare not forget in eternal life."

"It's good that you have this heart." Yang Gonggong appeared very "kind" at this moment, "Speaking of which, I also have selfishness. Afraid that once you fly to a high branch, you won't recognize me as this adoptive father; also afraid that you become a popular person in the palace, busy every day without leisure, with no more free time to care for me in old age. Sigh, people get old, more or less have selfish distractions... You have to forgive..."

"Dare not, dare not," Yang Tianliang hurriedly pointed to heaven to swear a curse, saying that if he had any thought of not being filial to his adoptive father, he must die a bad death.

"It's enough that you know; why swear a curse." Yang Gonggong sighed, "We men don't need this."

"Yes, yes."

Yang Gonggong coughed lightly and continued: "Over at Delong, vitality is temporarily hurt. He also came to beg me, so I made the decision to keep the ten thousand taels of silver from the various Eunuchs in the palace there."

"All depends on Dad to decide."

"Shopkeeper Leng is prudent in doing things and very reliable. In the future, he might still be the reliance of you and me, father and son. You treat him, cannot be like treating ordinary merchants."

"Child understands!"

Yang Gonggong rambled on about many future arrangements, and Yang Tianliang agreed to them one by one. The father and son chatted, harmonious and happy, a scene of "kind father and filial son."

At the end, Yang Gonggong seemed to mention inadvertently: "I heard you often went to Tianjin Wei a few days ago?"

Yang Tianliang was stunned. When plotting this "big event," in order to prepare to flee after the matter was exposed, he indeed went to Tianjin Wei specially and bought a preorder ticket at the Merchants' Bureau boat agency.

He didn't ask a small eunuch to do this; he did it himself in person. And the follower he took to Tianjin Wei was not a palace eunuch. It should be very secret. How did Yang Gonggong know?

On second thought, his going to Tianjin Wei was not a secret infiltration, so it was not strange for his adoptive father to know. He thought slightly and said:

"Yes, Child went to Tianjin Wei a few times to handle matters."

"Oh, what matter was handled?"

"Tianjin Wei now has many fresh gadgets, especially many 'Nanyang Goods'. Child heard there are several medicines among them that are very miraculous, so I went there specially to see if they were truly so effective. If they really had effects, I wanted to buy them to honor Dad."

Yang Gonggong also showed a look of curiosity: "What medicine?"

"It is a kind of medicinal wine, with the effect of strengthening Yang and tonifying the kidney..." What Yang Tianliang said was not entirely false. Because in Tianjin Wei, there were indeed pharmacies selling this "Aphrodisiac Wine" said to flow out from the Kun scoundrels, and the effect was significant.

"Useful?!"

"Useful!" Yang Tianliang nodded very affirmatively, and acted slightly shy: "Child... Child... also tasted it. It indeed has potency."

Eunuchs using aphrodisiacs was not a strange story. Eunuchs abusing aphrodisiac drugs and being addicted to eating various "animal penises" were occasionally recorded in historical materials and novels about eunuch life in the Ming and Qing dynasties. Yang Gonggong and his son were both eunuchs, but still kept many concubines, and the demand in this aspect was very strong.

"Unexpectedly there is such a strange thing!" Yang Gonggong showed a look of greed, "Such a Kun scoundrel good thing, why didn't Leng Ningyun mention it?"

"Probably because it uses 'medicine', fearing trouble." Yang Tianliang said, "He is a merchant, naturally unwilling to provoke trouble."

"Loss that Father let him save so much money, not a bit of filial piety!" Yang Gonggong scolded, and immediately asked about the medicinal wine, "How many bottles did you buy?"

"This medicinal wine arrives intermittently, and the quantity each time is also very small. It is very sought after," Yang Tianliang said, "Child went several times before buying three bottles. One bottle Child already used to test the medicine. The remaining two bottles will be sent to honor Father tomorrow."

"Good, good, worthy of being my obedient child!" Yang Gonggong clapped his hands and laughed, "This Kun scoundrel indeed has good things!" He sighed as he spoke, "I heard there is a Merchants' Boat Agency in Tianjin Wei?"

Yang Tianliang was startled and said apprehensively: "There are... those running sea routes, and also those running the canal."

"I heard people say that the Merchants' Boat Agency's ships can go to Lingao. Dad is old, otherwise, I really want to go to Lingao to take a look!" Yang Gonggong sighed.

Yang Tianliang laughed dryly a few times and said: "You old man are joking. Not to mention the bumps of the sea route, now that the two countries are at war, how can one go? Dad."

"That's right, just saying freely. This Kun scoundrel is really formidable. fighting war on one side while doing business on the other. If the sour scholars in the court all had their ability, it would be good." Yang Gonggong laughed, "I am tired. You withdraw."
