# Chapter 2511: Burning the Tower (24)

The enemy continued to walk toward him carrying a saber. Closer. He saw that leader's face. Xu Tong used his last accumulated strength to stand up suddenly. His right hand spun, reversing the dagger, five fingers pinching the blade. Right arm swung back, throwing the dagger in his hand fiercely. The dagger rotated twice, then under the action of gravity, the point faced forward, flying toward Wei Mingchen's throat. Wei Mingchen gently flicked with the Cloud Ladder saber in his hand, knocking aside the oncoming flying knife. The flying knife just now was weak and powerless. A trace of a smug smile appeared at the corner of Wei Mingchen's mouth. But when thinking of the price paid, his face turned gloomy again instantly.

Wei Mingchen calmly cocked the hand crossbow string, raised his right hand, and aimed at Xu Tong. He never took risks. He wouldn't get close to Xu Tong either. A dying beast might be even more dangerous. He would use the hand crossbow to weaken the opponent before going up to finish him off.

"Bang." A dull gunshot broke the silence of the mountain forest. A flock of returning birds roosting in the forest was startled into sudden flight, circling and crying in the pale gray sky.

Amidst the gunshot, Wei Mingchen's head tilted back. His hand crossbow did not fire. A small bullet hole appeared in the center of his brow. A bright red flower mixed with brain matter bloomed at the back of his head. His body swayed, and a gurgling sound came from his throat. This was his last testament to the world. He tilted to the side and fell slowly. The last image remaining on his retina was a slender figure in a canvas hunting suit holding a gun with one hand, tilting constantly.

Yang Cao blew gently away the curling gunpowder smoke from the muzzle, walking forward from behind Xu Tong. The remaining four stared dumbfounded at everything before them, not knowing whether to retreat or advance. One of them woke up suddenly, shouting: "It's a woman, kill her!" At this moment, a black shadow jumped out from the flank, cutting in behind him. That person grabbed the swordsman's hair bun with his left hand, pulling his head and cervical vertebrae backward to the left. The prismatic short awl in his right hand thrust straight into the brainstem from the right side, below the jawbone. A twist, and a "swish" sound as it was pulled out neatly. That person flicked the short awl crisply in the air, leaving a string of crystal blood beads.

More than ten black shadows flashed continuously. The remaining three swordsmen were pounced to the ground almost simultaneously in an instant. Resistance ended before it even began, leaving only a few cold corpses.

Yang Cao opened her backpack, took out a water bag, and handed it to Xu Tong, whispering, "Glucose." Xu Tong took it with his right hand, sipping small mouthfuls.

An action team member opened a first aid kit, treated Xu Tong's wounds, and said, "It's fine, won't die." Another member came over, asked about Li Baiqing's whereabouts, and reported to Yang Cao.

Yang Cao shouted, "Xiao Wu."

A lean young man with an excessively young face walked over quickly. His face carried an indescribable insidiousness. He wiped the fresh blood on the prismatic short awl with a cloth, retracted it into the scabbard at his waist, and responded, "Chief Yang."

Yang Cao said, "Look after him. I'll contact Team Two to see how things are over there. Ask if the few horse stakes (horse watchers) have been taken out. Then have them receive Li Baiqing—he might need first aid measures. Once stable, send him to the hospital quickly!" After speaking, she walked downward.

Xiao Wu squatted beside Xu Tong, smiled at Xu Tong, and said, "Stop drinking that stuff; it has no kick. Have one stick and you'll have strength."

After speaking, he took out a pack of cigarettes, pulled one out and lit it, took a deep drag himself first, then handed the remaining half to Xu Tong.

Xu Tong took a puff and coughed twice. He realized there was something mixed in the cigarette and immediately handed it back: "I don't smoke your stuff. You'd best smoke less yourself. Killing the hen to get the eggs!"

Xiao Wu laughed *hei hei* twice and said, "Take a few more puffs. At least relieve it a bit."

Seeing him ignore him, Xiao Wu said, "Chief Yang organized two tracking teams, two support teams, and one logistics team to provide support for you. You know this. This time, five walkie-talkies were urgently borrowed from the Special Reconnaissance Team for communication. Several newly arrived flashlights were also requisitioned. You also know that these original Australian treasures are getting fewer and fewer these years. For this matter, Chief Yang even went to Director Wu's place to slam the table. Field tracking is difficult. The river flats and tidal creeks here turn a thousand times; we couldn't figure out the way at all. We could only stay on the periphery. When we came back, the support team hadn't arrived yet, and you took Old Li and entered the reed marshes. You ran too fast. In this ghost place, we couldn't pinpoint your bearing at all. The support team was far away too. Always just that little bit of distance short. Until you pulled that signal flare, we didn't know you were so close to us. Why didn't you use that thing earlier?"

Xu Tong said, "Whoever exposes first is unlucky."

Xiao Wu grinned and said, "True."

Xiao Wu stood up, patted the dust off his body, supported Xu Tong's shoulder, and said, "Chief Yang treats you well. I'll send you back now..."

"No rush," Xu Tong asked. "Where is this place?"

"This is Cao River in Panyu County."

"Cao River?!"

Xu Tong realized that his "Secret Record of Distance Art" had a huge loophole. He originally thought it was very close to Guangzhou, but didn't expect to have arrived at such a far place!

Thinking again, the other party blindfolded him and placed him inside the boat awning; he had actually completely lost the concept of time and space.

"This place isn't easy to find, right?"

"Very hard to find," Xiao Wu laughed. "Without brothers of Tanka origin as guides, we would still be circling around here!"

Seeing his lost expression, Xiao Wu comforted, "You don't need to be heavy-hearted. Since we know this is their old nest, go back and ask the Special Reconnaissance Team's air reconnaissance team to come out and search. No matter how deep they hide, they'll be found just the same."

"No need. Even if found, it would have long been empty of people. They aren't that stupid." Xu Tong felt extreme fatigue attack again. "Find me a stretcher. I'm falling asleep."

When he woke up, Xu Tong had already returned to the Bureau in Guangzhou city. Not only were his wounds re-bandaged, but even the clothes on his body had been changed. How dead he must have slept.

He felt for the watch by the pillow. It was already five in the morning. He had slept for quite a while. At this moment, his brain was as clear as washed by water. He remembered almost every minute of everything that happened yesterday. Xu Tong knew this memory was temporary; he had to seize the time to write the report quickly. Especially everything seen at the alliance meeting scene.

After a simple wash, he rang the bell and called in the guard on duty outside the door:

"Get me a breakfast, and a cup of strong tea. Send them all to the office."

Subsequently, he came to the office, opened the curtains, and began to write his action report by the morning light.

Recalling the whole process, he felt he had no errors. Why did Xue Tu suddenly develop killing intent? He could sense that after the fight ended, Xue Tu had no killing intent toward him. But after the meeting dismissed, he was immediately pursued—and this pursuit was prepared in advance.

Could it be that they long knew he was an undercover agent? Xu Tong's thoughts were a bit messy. He didn't delve deeper. He thought of the old Daoist who stood by Xue Tu's side all along; he was likely the "Wooden Stone Daoist" mentioned many times in intelligence. This Wooden Stone Daoist was very mysterious. Since the Witchcraft Case, they knew such a person existed, but had never touched his edge.

However, judging from this behavior, these Ming Dynasty underground forces were gathering unprecedentedly. I'm afraid it won't be long before a violent counterattack is set off.

The counterattack was bound to fail; Xu Tong firmly believed this. But the beacon fire caused by the counterattack would cause countless innocent common people to suffer broken families and death...

Two nights later, in front of a porridge stall outside the Political Security Bureau in Guangzhou city. Yang Cao sat quietly alone at a table. This was a place where many night-shift Political Security Bureau employees ate late-night snacks. The dim flame of the oil lamp with a glass cover on the table jumped restlessly, illuminating the range of a few feet in front of eyes. A figure came to Yang Cao's side. Xu Tong's voice sounded from behind: "Working overtime again?"

Yang Cao gave an "En" and said, "Didn't rest a few more days?"

Xu Tong said, "No need. Have to report to Director Wu tomorrow. I'll organize the report again."

Yang Cao was silent for a moment, then said, "At that time, you didn't know when support would arrive. You should have eliminated Li Baiqing and escaped yourself."

Xu Tong said, "A life loyal to the Senate shouldn't be deprived like this. Cannot only look at the result and not ask about the means."

Yang Cao said, "We only need rationality, not sensibility."

Xu Tong said, "This perhaps is the humanity the Senators often speak of."

Yang Cao said, "Your choice could bring disaster. If you and Li Baiqing fell into enemy hands, the consequences would be unimaginable."

Xu Tong said, "I wouldn't be captured alive."

Yang Cao exhaled lightly and said, "I don't believe in humanity, including myself. because humanity cannot withstand testing. I will write this part into the report."

Xu Tong didn't answer again. He turned to leave, stopped after two steps, hesitated, and said, "This time, thank you." After speaking, he didn't look back and strode away.

Yang Cao gently stirred the steaming white porridge in front of her. Using a wooden spoon to send it into her mouth, the scalding hot porridge slid down her throat, warming Yang Cao's icy body and cold soul.

After a long time, Yang Cao whispered to herself, "You're welcome."

Zhao Manxiong gently pressed his temples with his hands, relieving his tense nerves. Wu Mu sat on the leather sofa opposite the desk, silently reading the report of this operation. The hands of the rosewood table clock custom-made by Zizhenghai in the corner of the room made a monotonous *tick-tock* sound, like a hypnotic pendulum, making people unconsciously drowsy.

After a long time, Wu Mu raised his head and threw the two reports in his hand onto the coffee table.

A short silence appeared in the office. After a moment, Zhao Manxiong raised his head and asked, "How is it?"

Wu Mu asked back, "How is what?"

Zhao Manxiong pointed to the report. Wu Mu said, "From a reconnaissance perspective, a failure. A thorough failure. Undercover personnel exposed, civilian informants exposed. Intense armed conflict occurred, causing large personnel casualties—although they were enemies. Is this individual heroism? Does Xu Tong really think he is Kenshiro?"
