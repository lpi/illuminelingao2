# Chapter 2595 - Investigation (Part 22)

"You really intend to use this person?" Seeing Yuan Shuzhi leave, Quan Youde couldn't help asking.

"Trustworthy or not, he won't be able to talk anyway." Daoist Mushi gave a cold laugh. "What does Master Quan think?"

"Yes, yes." Quan Youde's original position was to simply silence Yuan Shuzhi. But the current situation required keeping him alive.

However, continuing to stay at Jubao Tang posed great risk. Jubao Tang's distribution of Lushi Powder was an open secret. Now that the Australians were investigating at the source, finding their way here was a matter of moments. Except for a few unimportant small fry left at the shop as cover, all important people and goods had been gradually transported out.

In less than two years of handling Lushi Powder and these Australian miracle drugs, Jubao Tang had already accumulated nearly two hundred fifty thousand yuan in profits. Even Daoist Mushi, who'd seen plenty, found this figure astonishing. This money was truly too easy to make!

Especially those wealthy gentry and magnates—to save their lives, they produced dozens or hundreds of taels of silver without batting an eye.

However, though they'd earned lots of money, expenses were also large. Daoist Mushi knew that in these two years, just the silver submitted to Lord Shi amounted to nearly one hundred thousand. The remaining silver was mostly used for Master Liang's "great undertaking."

Beneath Guangdong's calm surface, the gentry's growing dissatisfaction simmered. Daoist Mushi knew his master was quietly awaiting opportunity. Once the Court's armies marched south, Guangdong would erupt in flames everywhere. Even if they couldn't burn the Hairy Bandits to death, at least they could wound them deeply—ensuring they wouldn't dare covet the Central Plains for decades.

With countless silver deployed, the conspiracy was gradually taking shape. The Court's attention was also turning southward. Before long, the imperial edict appointing a Liangguang Military Commissioner would be issued. The Hairy Bandits' days of doing whatever they pleased in the Two Guangs were nearly over.

"Daoist." Quan Youde said quietly.

"What is it?"

"Will there still be Australian drugs?"

"Hard to say." Daoist Mushi shook his head. "I think this matter is probably finished."

Quan Youde was reluctant to give up this lucrative business. Hearing this news, he felt disappointed. Unwilling to accept it, he asked again: "Even if we've lost one channel, there are other channels..."

"You think it's that easy!" Daoist Mushi secretly laughed at his naivety. "The Hairy Bandits aren't fools. We've made money off their drugs for two years. That's enough..." He suddenly thought—if he completely extinguished Quan Youde's hopes, this money-grubbing fellow might do something rash. They still needed him for now. So he changed his tune: "For now we can only avoid the spotlight. Once their investigation storm passes, we'll pick up the business again."

---

"I'm just worried those medicine peddlers and merchants won't get their drugs and will report us to the Australians. First, it'll cause trouble. Second, it'll ruin our ability to do business later..."

Collecting money without delivering goods was fraud. Losing credit would make future business very difficult. Quan Youde was still thinking of keeping a path open for future cooperation.

How could Daoist Mushi not know his thoughts? But he was very clear: this business would have no future.

"Though the business won't resume short-term, these merchants still need placating." Daoist Mushi said. "Have Manager Gao tell them: give us three more months, we'll definitely deliver all goods, and at twenty percent discount upon delivery."

"Yes, that at least gives them an answer." Quan Youde was delighted, still thinking business could resume. Daoist Mushi inwardly sneered.

The fake drug business was one-time only—Lord Shi had told him this long ago. Not only that, on Lord Shi's orders, he'd also stockpiled many Australian drugs. All prepared for wartime use. But Quan Youde didn't need to know this—and needn't know.

The fake drug business had reached its end. The Australians' commotion in Guangzhou would inevitably expose their hospital channels. Finding Jubao Tang was just a matter of time. He was here to "clean up thoroughly."

Though only ten-some li from the medicine market, this location was deep in a mountain ravine, with twisting, turning routes. Without a guide, ordinary people couldn't find their way in. Though the Australians had eyes on Jubao Tang's exterior, checkpoint reports indicated their tails had all lost their way midroute. So this place was temporarily safe. He could rest easy completing the accounts in hand.

After completion, this place would become the final resting place for Mr. Shu, Quan Youde, and others. The tens of thousands Quan Youde had divided would also "return to their rightful owner."

Next, he needed to put more thought into fake silver dollars and counterfeit notes, Daoist Mushi thought.

He sent for Manager Gao and asked:

"Have the new Wanchun Quan Lushi Powders all arrived?"

"Yes, they're all stored at Jubao Tang."

"Good. Return tomorrow. After you return, repackage this entire batch as Jubao Tang Lushi Powder."

"But there's no Australian drugs."

"What Australian drugs? Lushi Powder is Lushi Powder." Daoist Mushi laughed.

Manager Gao suddenly understood: "Your humble servant understands!"

"After repackaging, notify all the peddlers and merchants who've paid to come pick up goods. Reassure them. Tell them: if they still plan to sell miracle drugs, prepay six months' worth. We'll supply at twenty percent off. But delivery will be delayed three months. Understand?"

"This..." Manager Gao thought this was a bit different from what Master Quan had said. But he immediately understood the Daoist's meaning and nodded: "Your humble servant understands!"

"You're a clever one." Daoist Mushi nodded. "Serve well, and I'll promote you in the future!"

"Yes, thank you, Daoist!" Manager Gao was delighted and withdrew.

"Qiao Yan!" He called into the darkness. A large man immediately emerged from the shadows.

"Guard this place well with the others. Watch for anyone trying to leave without permission. Especially Jubao Tang's people—understand? Don't let a single one escape."

---

"Australian pen?" Zheng Xiaoyu understood. This meant someone in the health sector was colluding with Quan Youde, extracting publicly-funded drugs. The note must have been communication between them.

"What did the note say?"

"I didn't see that. A servant immediately took it away." He Jun shook his head. "But this Quan Youde definitely has connections with Australian cadres! Otherwise, how could he obtain so many Australian drugs?"

"Naturally, naturally." Zheng Xiaoyu nodded repeatedly. "Who might he be connected with?"

"Who else?" He Jun had drunk several cups and was already tipsy. His words lost all restraint. "Obviously someone from the Australian hospital in Guangzhou!"

Zheng Xiaoyu thought—isn't that obvious! But distributors like He Jun knew very little. Quan Youde couldn't possibly tell him something as important as the supply source. He patiently asked:

"Besides this Australian cadre, there must be some weakness?"

"There is one strange thing. Can't say it's a weakness—just strange."

He Jun said he'd once seen a Kunlun slave selling medicine at the medicine market. Nothing strange about that—local drug peddlers from Southeast Asia often came to sell medicinals. But this person walked into Jubao Tang.

"Jubao Tang doesn't compound its own medicines. Why would they want Southeast Asian medicinals?" He Jun said. "Very suspicious."

"The native was alone?"

"Yes, just one person. He seemed to know his way around—didn't seem like a first-timer at all..."

Zheng Xiaoyu knew the Luofu Mountain medicine market well and knew Southeast Asian merchants operated here—actually mostly Chinese, but to project an "exotic flavor," they'd bring along Southeast Asian natives with obvious features as "living billboards," selling their dubiously authentic so-called "medicinals." This was especially common at the medicine market's "ghost market."

These natives, not knowing Chinese, rarely acted alone. Mostly they stayed with their masters at inns.

Why would such a Southeast Asian native go to Jubao Tang?

Zheng Xiaoyu couldn't figure it out. But now there was something he could advise him about. Both from duty and personal friendship.

"Elder brother, I think this miracle drug business can no longer continue." Zheng Xiaoyu said. "Keep going, and not only will you lose the silver, but your lives might get involved too! Just cut ties with them completely. The prepaid goods money—consider it thrown into water. Let it go."

"I truly don't want to continue. But since ancient times, getting on a pirate ship is easy; getting off is hard." He Jun said. "These people are all outlaws, appearing and disappearing in the dark of night. A few days ago, peddlers couldn't get their goods and gathered to make trouble. Two ringleaders ended up dead—cause unknown. I've dealt with them the longest and know quite a bit of scattered information about them. I've probably long been a thorn in their side!" He Jun's eyes reddened. "A few days ago, that Quan Youde even threatened me—told me to do business honestly and not talk nonsense to outsiders, or else watch out for my whole family. Sigh!"

He sighed: "I'm a man with family responsibilities. How dare I confront them? Besides, this involves Australians. Even if they don't act, one letter exposing me, and I'd be done for! I can only take it day by day."

Zheng Xiaoyu remained calm, feeling the moment was right. He said quietly: "Elder brother, if it comes to it, I think you might as well be unjust since he's been unkind. Report them to the Australians first. What do you think?"

"Report?!" He Jun was shocked. The wine instantly sobered him as he stared at his sworn brother in alarm.

"Yes, report." Zheng Xiaoyu nodded. Turning He Jun wasn't a spur-of-the-moment idea but the result of discussions with Lu Cheng.

As a fairly important distribution channel for Jubao Tang's external sales, He Jun should possess many thread and lead connections. If they could bring him over as a "guide," case progress would be faster—and given current circumstances, they couldn't afford to wait. Under Zheng Mingjiang's pressure tactics, Quan Youde's recent movements showed the other side was already preparing their escape route.
