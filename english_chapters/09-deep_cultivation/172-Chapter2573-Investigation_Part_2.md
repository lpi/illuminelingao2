# Chapter 2573 - Investigation (Part 2)

"Fetus-changing pills" struck Zheng Mingjiang as utterly absurd. But she knew the hallmark of fraudulent medicines: impossible claims. The motto was always the same—"What doctors can't cure, we cure. Chronic illnesses beyond treatment? We treat them. At death's door? We'll pull you back." So fetus-changing pills hardly surprised her. If the market had offered "resurrection pills" or "limb regeneration paste," she wouldn't have batted an eye. To a drowning person, even a straw looks like salvation.

Since ancient times, fake medicines had thrived by exploiting precisely this desperation.

Still, she didn't dwell on it. The more "miracle drugs" appeared, the closer this pharmacy was to operating off the books. Clearly, Lushi Powder moved primarily through such gray channels.

These miracle cures held little interest for her now—they would need cracking down eventually, but that wasn't today's agenda.

At each pharmacy, she purchased the implicated drugs. Back at the guesthouse, she examined them under her portable microscope. Most resembled Guangzhou's Lushi Powder—coptis and various traditional Chinese medicines mixed with varying proportions of purified crystalline powder.

What she hadn't expected: some of the miracle drugs she'd bought on impulse also contained purified crystalline powder.

"Strange—what is this?" Now Zheng Mingjiang was genuinely confused. If Lushi Powder contained antibiotics, what was this powder doing in the others?

She knew that primitive grinding methods, no matter how fine, always left visible structural traces. This kind of purified crystalline substance could only come from the Senate's chemical factory. There was no second source in this timeline.

"I'll need to bring these back for proper analysis." She sensed the situation here was more complicated than it appeared.

The prices told their own story—Lushi Powder sold cheaper here than in Guangzhou. One step closer to the source. Zheng Mingjiang turned this over in her mind.

If only she could trace their suppliers. But both she and her guard were outsiders. Asking about supply chains would yield nothing but suspicion—and tip off whoever was behind this.

She recalled what Lin Ziqi had mentioned: the accompanying officer Lin Ming came from a family of herbal medicine traders and had an Embroidered Guard background. He knew Foshan intimately—a true local operator. Better still, he was a highly reliable naturalized citizen cadre. Let him investigate.

Zheng Mingjiang summoned Lin Ming and tasked him with quietly gathering information about Lushi Powder. Above all, she needed to know where it came from.

"Keep it secret. No leaks. This matter is of great importance."

"Yes, Elder. I understand."

Only now did Lin Ming grasp why this Elder had come. If an Elder was personally investigating, Lushi Powder was obviously connected to something major. He didn't dare slack off and immediately dispatched one of his best informants.

The subordinate disguised himself as an itinerant doctor from out of town. He found an assistant at a small pharmacy and, claiming he wanted to stock the medicine for resale, inquired about its origins.

Money makes the devil turn the millstone, as the saying goes. Under the assault of silver, the young assistant promptly betrayed his employer's secrets: "You've come to the right person. Our shopkeeper just idles about all day. Receiving, shipping, stocking, selling—I handle everything. And I'll tell you this: never mind our shop. In all of Foshan, if not ten out of ten, at least eight out of ten shops get their supply from Luofu Mountain."

"What about the other two?"

"Those either cross-ship and mix in their own additions, or they see the money being made and cook up their own batches."

The assistant proved eager to talk. "Our shop's Lushi Powder is the genuine article. My second aunt's husband's brother-in-law's cousin fell sick a few days ago—burning with fever—and got better taking this very medicine. The fakes are just scutellaria, coptis, ephedra, and cinnamon twig thrown together. Tastes similar, makes you sweat, but doesn't cure a thing."

"Then I'd like to stock directly from Luofu Mountain. Which trading house should I approach?"

"Why go all the way there? Just buy from me. We offer two percent off for orders over ten boxes. For you, I'll make it five."

The spy sighed. "If you give me five percent off, where's my profit? This medicine is everywhere in the neighboring counties now. I can only scrape together a few coins working the rural routes."

He produced a silver five-cent piece. "Brother, just point me in the right direction. Help me out, and this is yours. It's not like this shop belongs to you..."

But the assistant wavered. Despite clearly wanting the coin, he ultimately lost his nerve: "That's the shopkeeper's secret. His nephew handles the Luofu Mountain runs. I'm an outsider—he'd never trust me with that."

The spy bit back his irritation. Weren't you just pounding your chest about handling everything?

He investigated several more pharmacies. The results were consistent—every upstream trail led to the Luofu Mountain medicine market.

Zheng Mingjiang synthesized the findings: Foshan, like Guangzhou, was merely a distribution point. The real source lay at Luofu Mountain.

"Looks like we need to visit Huizhou." She made her decision. "Come—back to Guangzhou."

---

This was too significant to investigate covertly. Going behind the Senate's back would violate procedure and prove impractical besides.

Upon returning to Guangzhou, Zheng Mingjiang compiled her findings into a briefing and submitted it to Liu Xiang, Mu Min, Wu Mu, Lin Motian, Hong Huangnan, Wang Qiyi, and the other relevant Elders, requesting a special meeting.

After reading the report, Liu Xiang immediately appointed Lin Baiguang as convener. A strategy session was held in the Great World's conference room.

At the meeting, Zheng Mingjiang outlined the fake drug Lushi Powder she had discovered in Guangzhou and Foshan, along with the current antibiotic shortage at Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital.

"According to our pharmaceutical factory and distribution company, there shouldn't be a serious shortage. Someone is playing games in the middle, siphoning off the drugs. Meanwhile, 'miracle cures' have surfaced across multiple locations in the Pearl River Delta. Preliminary analysis shows their base ingredients are various antibiotics mixed with traditional Chinese medicine powder. Current intelligence suggests the Luofu Mountain medicine market in Huizhou may be a primary hub for manufacturing and distribution."

A stir rippled through the conference room.

"This is a scheme with ten-thousand-fold returns."

"Let's see who's bold enough to steal the Senate's strategic materials."

"Holy cow, are we about to get rich?"

Lin Baiguang cut short the chatter. "The manufacturing source isn't actually the key issue. What's critical is finding the leak point within our own organization. How did these antibiotics get out? Through which channel? That's what we need to answer." His gaze swept the assembled Elders. "I know everyone's schedule is packed. But today's matter should serve as a warning. We are neither omnipresent nor omnipotent. Our systems don't just have loopholes—those loopholes may be substantial. Each of you should conduct a self-examination within your divisions to identify systemic vulnerabilities, and give full cooperation to this investigation. Any other concerns?"

"Should the case go to Political Security or the police department?" Zheng Mingjiang wanted clarity on jurisdiction.

Lin Baiguang studied her face for several seconds. "Since Dr. Zheng first identified the problem, and since this involves specialized fields like medicine and pharmaceuticals, you should lead the case."

That had been her intention. Lin Baiguang was reading her preferences. She dispensed with false modesty: "I'll take responsibility. But I don't have suitable personnel..."

"Not a problem. The relevant department heads are all here. We'll form a joint investigation team. Each department will second appropriate candidates to you."

Everyone agreed readily enough. But hammering out the team's composition took considerable effort. The Senate's perennial problem was personnel shortage, especially capable naturalized citizen cadres. Usable cadres across all of Guangdong, while not quite pepper sprinkled in egg drop soup, were hardly concentrated either.

Since Zheng Mingjiang was willing to continue leading, Political Security immediately offered Lu Cheng and a three-person team to provide assistance and ensure the Elder's safety.

"She's a female comrade—more convenient to work with," Wu Mu summarized. "Huizhou isn't Guangzhou. Watch your safety."

Mu Min contributed an official document. With it, Zheng Mingjiang could command and mobilize Huizhou's police agencies at will, plus National Army forces up to squad strength. Huizhou remained a "pacification zone," far less developed than a "governance zone" like Guangzhou. Government presence there was limited, and without adequate armed backup, many things simply couldn't be done.

Given Guangzhou's shortage of spare hands, Wang Qiyi offered to send documents to Huizhou, seconding several fiscal and tax cadres to assist. Whatever else might be said about them, their auditing skills were solid. Currently, much of Cheka's work in Guangdong was actually being handled by fiscal and tax inspection departments.

"I'll also transfer a few inspection cadres. We have local people in Huizhou already. I'll send orders requiring full cooperation with your audit."

After Zheng Mingjiang returned to the guesthouse, Guo Huiwen came to report: "Chief, the medical record ledgers from the various locations haven't been submitted yet, but I'm following up. Also, the medicines from Lingao haven't arrived, though they should be here soon."

"Keep pushing. And I can't wait for the medicines—I'm leaving tomorrow. Handle it when they arrive."

After Little Guo left, Zheng Mingjiang retrieved her issued handgun and began maintenance. The GLOCK pistol had actually gone unworn for years—useless in Lingao, heavy to carry, and she'd always worried about the hassle if it went missing. It had slept in her safe all this time. She'd only brought it for this Guangzhou assignment.

The desk lamp stretched her shadow long across the wall. Zheng Mingjiang traced her fingers over this relic from the old world.

"I hope I won't need you."
