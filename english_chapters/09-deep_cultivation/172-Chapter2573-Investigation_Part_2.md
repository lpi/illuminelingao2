# Chapter 2573 - Investigation (Part 2)

"Fetus-changing pills" were simply too inconceivable for Zheng Mingjiang. But she knew that false medicines were characterized by claiming "miraculous effects"—the motto being "diseases doctors can't cure, we cure; chronic illnesses doctors can't treat, we can treat; when someone's about to die, we can save their life." So never mind fetus-changing pills—even if the market had "resurrection pills" or "severed limb regeneration paste," she wouldn't find it strange. After all, to someone about to drown, even a straw is seen as a hope for survival.

Since ancient times, fake medicines could prevail largely by exploiting this psychology.

However, she didn't take this matter to heart. Zheng Mingjiang thought, the more of these "miracle drugs" that appeared, the closer this pharmacy was to being "off the books." Clearly, this Lushi Powder was mainly sold through these "off the books" channels.

Zheng Mingjiang had little interest in these "miracle drugs"—they would naturally need to be cracked down on later, but they weren't on the agenda now.

At each pharmacy, she spent money to buy the relevant implicated drugs. Back at the guesthouse, she examined them with her portable microscope. Most were like Guangzhou's Lushi Powder—mixed with coptis and various other traditional Chinese medicines, with varying proportions of purified crystalline powder.

Unexpectedly, among the other miracle drugs she'd bought on a whim, there was also purified crystalline powder!

"Strange—what is this?!" Now Zheng Mingjiang was confused. If Lushi Powder contained antibiotics, what was the powder in these medicines?

She knew that with primitive grinding methods, no matter how fine the grinding, one could still see related structural bodies. This kind of purified crystalline substance could only come from the Senate's chemical factory. There was no second source in this timeline.

"Looks like I'll need to bring these back to verify the composition." She had a vague feeling that things here were quite complicated.

From the prices, Lushi Powder here was somewhat cheaper than in Guangzhou—seemingly one step closer to the crime's source. Zheng Mingjiang pondered this silently.

If only she could find out where they sourced their goods. But both she and her guard were outsiders. Inquiring about suppliers would not only yield no information but would alert the enemy.

She recalled that Lin Ziqi had told her the accompanying Lin Ming's family originally ran an herbal medicine shop, and he was also from an Embroidered Guard background, very familiar with Foshan's local situation. A real local snake. Moreover, this person was a highly reliable naturalized citizen cadre—she might as well have him investigate.

So Zheng Mingjiang summoned Lin Ming and asked him to try to learn what he could about Lushi Powder. Particularly, she needed to understand where this medicine came from.

"Investigate in secret. Don't leak any information. This matter is of great importance."

"Yes, this humble official understands!"

Only now did Lin Ming understand this Elder Zheng's purpose in coming. Since an Elder had been alarmed into investigating, this Lushi Powder was obviously connected to a major case. He didn't dare be slack, and immediately dispatched one of his useful informants to gather information.

This subordinate disguised himself as a traveling doctor from elsewhere, found an assistant at a small pharmacy, and inquired about the medicine's origins, saying he also wanted to stock it for resale.

As the saying goes, money makes the devil turn the millstone. Under the silver-bullet offensive, the young assistant immediately sold out his own pharmacy's secrets: "You've asked the right person. Usually our shopkeeper just idles about. All the receiving and sending, stocking and selling—that's all me. Never mind our shop—in all of Foshan, I dare say if not ten out of ten, at least eight out of ten shops buy this from Luofu Mountain."

"What about the other two out of ten?"

"As for those two, either they cross-ship goods and mix in other stuff themselves, or they see others making money and prepare their own."

The assistant was quite talkative too. "Our shop's Lushi Powder is the genuine article. My second aunt's husband's brother-in-law's cousin got sick a few days ago, burning with fever, and got better precisely by taking this Lushi Powder. Those fakes, they're just scutellaria, coptis, ephedra, and cinnamon twig—a few ingredients mixed together. Though it tastes similar and makes you sweat, it doesn't cure anything."

"In that case, I'd like to go to Luofu Mountain to stock up. Which trading house should I look for?"

"Hey, hey, why go to Luofu Mountain for stock? Just come to me. Our rule here is two percent off for over ten boxes. I'll give you special treatment—five percent off."

The spy sighed: "If you give me five percent off, how do I make any money? This medicine is sold in all the neighboring counties now. I can only make a few coins doing rural routes."

With that, he produced a silver five-cent piece. "Brother, just give me a hint! As long as you help me out, this money is yours. This shop isn't yours anyway..."

Unexpectedly, the assistant hemmed and hawed. Though he clearly wanted to take the silver coin, in the end he lost his nerve: "Ah, this is our shopkeeper's secret. Usually it's his nephew who goes to Luofu Mountain to pick up goods. I'm an outsider—how could he trust me with that?"

The spy grumbled to himself: didn't you just pat your chest saying you do everything?

The spy then investigated several more pharmacies. The results were much the same—the upstream supplier was the Luofu Mountain medicine market.

Zheng Mingjiang summarized: clearly Foshan, like Guangzhou, was not the source. The upstream was at Luofu Mountain.

"Looks like we still need to make a trip to Huizhou." Zheng Mingjiang made her decision. "Come, let's return to Guangzhou!"

---

The Lushi Powder case was a major matter. Zheng Mingjiang couldn't possibly investigate it behind the Senate's back—that would neither follow procedure nor be feasible.

As soon as she returned to Guangzhou, Zheng Mingjiang immediately compiled the relevant situation into a briefing and submitted it to Liu Xiang, Mu Min, Wu Mu, Lin Motian, Hong Huangnan, Wang Qiyi, and other relevant Elders. She requested a special meeting.

After Liu Xiang read the report, he immediately appointed Lin Baiguang as meeting convener, and a strategy meeting was held in the Great World's conference room.

At the meeting, Zheng Mingjiang briefly introduced the fake drug Lushi Powder she had discovered in Guangzhou and Foshan, along with the current antibiotic shortage at the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital.

"Based on information from our pharmaceutical factory and pharmaceutical company, there shouldn't be a serious shortage of antibiotics, so someone must be playing tricks in between, 'diverting' the drugs. Meanwhile, 'miracle drugs' have appeared in multiple locations in the Pearl River Delta. Preliminary analysis shows their basic ingredients are multiple antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicine powder. Based on current information, the Luofu Mountain medicine market in Huizhou may be one of the source dens for manufacturing and distribution."

A small commotion stirred in the conference room.

"This is business with ten-thousand-fold returns."

"Let me see who's so bold as to steal the Senate's strategic materials."

"Holy cow, are we about to get rich?"

...

Lin Baiguang stopped the discussion and said: "Actually, the manufacturing and distribution source isn't the key issue. The critical thing is finding the leak point within our organization. How did these antibiotic drugs get out? Through which channel? That's the key question." He glanced at the Elders present. "I know everyone's work is very busy. But today's matter serves as a warning to all of us. We are not omnipresent or omnipotent. There are not only loopholes in our work systems—the loopholes may not be small. Everyone should first conduct self-examination within your own divisions to identify possible systemic vulnerabilities. Give full cooperation to this fake drug case. Any other opinions?"

"Should this case be handed to Political Security or the police department?" Zheng Mingjiang was very concerned about follow-up issues.

Lin Baiguang's gaze lingered on her face for several seconds. He said: "Since Dr. Zheng was the first to discover the problem, and this matter involves specialized fields like medicine and pharmaceuticals, you should lead this case."

Zheng Mingjiang had intended this. Lin Baiguang was "catering to her preferences." She didn't bother with false modesty and immediately said: "I can take responsibility. But I don't have suitable people under me..."

"That's not a problem. The heads of relevant departments are all here. Let's form a joint investigation team. Each department will second suitable candidates to you."

Everyone immediately agreed. But the investigation team's membership took considerable effort to work out. The Senate's basic situation was a shortage of personnel, especially capable naturalized citizen cadres. The usable naturalized citizen cadres in all of Guangdong, while not quite like pepper sprinkled in egg drop soup, certainly weren't highly concentrated either.

Since Zheng Mingjiang was willing to continue leading the investigation, Political Security immediately offered to dispatch Lu Cheng leading a three-person team to assist and ensure the Elder's safety.

"She's a female comrade—more convenient to work with." Wu Mu summarized. "Huizhou isn't like Guangzhou. Be careful about safety."

Mu Min's support was an official document. With this document, she could command and mobilize Huizhou's police agencies at any time, plus National Army forces not exceeding one squad. Huizhou was a "pacification zone," far inferior to a "governance zone" like Guangzhou. Government organs had limited presence there, and without adequate armed force backing, many things couldn't be done.

Regarding the situation that Guangzhou didn't have many spare hands to second, Wang Qiyi indicated he would send documents to Huizhou, seconding several fiscal and tax cadres from there to assist the investigation. Whatever else might be said, their auditing skills were quite good. Currently, many of Cheka's operations in Guangdong were actually being handled by fiscal and tax inspection departments.

"I'll also transfer a few inspection department cadres. We also have people locally in Huizhou. When the time comes, I'll send them documents requiring full cooperation with your auditing."

After Zheng Mingjiang returned to the guesthouse, Guo Huiwen immediately came to report: "Chief, the medical record ledgers from various locations haven't been submitted yet, but I've been following up. Also, the medicines from Lingao haven't arrived yet, but they'll be here soon."

"Keep pushing! Keep pushing! Also, I can't wait for the medicines—I'm leaving tomorrow. You handle it when the time comes."

After Little Guo left, Zheng Mingjiang took out her issued handgun and began maintenance. Her GLOCK pistol had actually not been worn for many years—it was useless in Lingao, heavy to carry around, and she was afraid of the trouble if it were lost. So this handgun had been sleeping in her safe for years. She'd only brought it for this business trip to Guangzhou.

The desk lamp elongated her shadow. Zheng Mingjiang gently stroked this item from the old world: "I hope I won't need to use you."
