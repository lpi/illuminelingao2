# Chapter 2518: Principal Tian Liang

Tian Liang's words set Kuang Lu's mind slightly at ease. So this was his plan. But these Kun thieves were too undiscriminating, appointing such a person as a school principal. Still, he cupped his hands in a salute and said, "You are too kind, too kind. However, Kuang has just returned to his hometown. Let me settle down before making any plans. I will definitely pay a visit another day." With that, he headed toward Zeng Guiyu's small boat.

Watching Kuang Lu's receding figure, Tian Liang didn't forget to shout, "Please come participate in the Civil Service Examination!"

"We shall meet again," came Kuang Lu's drifting response as he walked further away.

"Young Master, are you really going to be a teacher at the Kun thieves' school?" Kuang Yan was somewhat curious.

Kuang Lu reached back and tapped him on the head with his fan. "You and I have just returned and don't know the situation in our hometown. Petty officials like this are the most tricky and vicious, and they hold power in their hands. If we offend him, there will be endless trouble. For now, don't get entangled with him; agreeing casually does no harm."

Kuang Yan covered his head, muttering, "I know, Young Master. The Master said, 'The superior man understands what is right; the inferior man understands what is profitable.' Today I learned the Sage's words are not false; these mud-legs even have to talk about 'profit' when sending their children to study."

Kuang Lu said indifferently, "Are you and I any different?"

Watching Kuang Lu leave, the villagers also dispersed. Tian Liang said somewhat embarrassedly to Hou Qing, "Sister Qing, I feel I'm particularly stupid. I can't do anything well, my promotion is always a few beats slower than my peers, and I can't speak..."

Hou Qing comforted him, "Blockhead, people with glib tongues may not be reliable in handling matters. The Chiefs arranged for you to be the principal of the Nanhai Demonstration School presumably because they also think you are loyal and reliable."

"But I'm afraid I won't do it well."

"Don't worry, I'm here, and Wen Yong will also help you."

Before the Northern Expedition, Tian Liang had been promoted to company commander. The 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the Line, which he commanded, belonged to the East Road Army and, under the leadership of Fu Sansi, captured the Chaoshan region.

The East Road Army didn't expend much effort to crush the Ming army group led by the Guangdong Vice Commander-in-Chief, sweeping across the entire eastern Guangdong like breaking dry weeds and smashing rotten wood. However, not long after, like the troops in other directions, they fell into a protracted security war.

The clan forces in the Chaoshan region were powerful, and the folk customs were fierce. The powerful local clans had never bought much into the government's authority, let alone outsiders like them. Although the prefectures and counties were easily taken, the directors appointed to each county found their government orders could not leave the city gates. To implement orders, clerks dared not leave the city without a National Army escort. Even if they went into the countryside, they were often attacked by local braves, suffering heavy casualties.

To establish the Senate's ruling dignity, the East Road Army fought almost daily, attacking cities and strongholds everywhere. He also engaged in close combat with enemy forces several times, luckily escaping serious injury. However, after falling into the water during a battle and choking on sewage, he contracted aspiration pneumonia and was sent to the field hospital for treatment. It was there that he met Hou Qing.

As the head nurse of the East Road Army Field Hospital, Hou Qing's duty was to organize the care of the wounded. Due to a shortage of manpower, she, as a cadre, often had to check the wards in the middle of the night. One night while adding medicine to Tian Liang's IV bottle, she was grabbed by the hand and he wouldn't let her go, his mouth crying "Sanniang, Sanniang." Hou Qing angrily thought this wounded soldier was intentionally taking advantage of her, but it turned out to be gibberish caused by a high fever, so she forgave him.

As the antibiotics took effect, Tian Liang gradually woke up from the high fever and realized that the person taking care of him day and night was not his Sanniang, but this thin and small "Sister Qing" before him. Amidst his disappointment, he was grateful. Over time, they became familiar. Tian Liang would tell her stories about his past, how he and Sanniang came to Lingao, how they grew up after arriving in Lingao, vividly describing the thrilling details of the Chengmai Battle to her, as well as his feelings for Sanniang.

Hou Qing asked him if he knew Guo Fu's feelings. He said he didn't know.

Tian Liang asked her if she knew Sanniang's feelings. She said she didn't know; she herself was an older leftover woman and didn't understand these things.

Tian Liang listened with his mouth wide open. According to the concepts of the Ming Dynasty, a woman unmarried at twenty was already an old maid. Hou Qing was twenty-seven and still hadn't found a husband's family.

Hou Qing told him she originally had a marriage contract, but encountered a natural disaster before the wedding. Her parents died one after another, and she had to flee everywhere with her younger brother Hou Wenyong, finally being taken in by the Senate in Guangzhou. She was assigned to the sanitation school. By then she was already twenty, but under Dean Shi, there was too much knowledge to learn and too many patients to save; there was simply no time to consider personal issues, so she was "left over."

Tian Liang comforted her, saying not to worry, a good woman like her would surely find a good home. Hou Qing laughed when she heard it, but she knew very well in her heart that given her situation, a good home was impossible. Her face and figure had no advantage compared to those female secretaries in the College of Arts and Sciences, so naturally, she wouldn't catch the eyes of the Chiefs. Naturalized citizen cadres of similar conditions and age had all started families and careers, and growing up under the Red Flag of the Senate, she couldn't possibly be someone's concubine. She looked down on men with poor conditions, and men younger than her looked down on her. Her brother Hou Wenyong grew up and began to worry, relying on connections with the Chiefs to introduce several partners to Hou Qing, but all ended without result. In short, it was such an awkward situation: unable to reach the high, unwilling to settle for the low.

That day, just as Tian Liang was about to be discharged, Hippo Senator led a team to inspect the sanitary work of the troops in the Chaoshan region. In the ward of the field hospital, Tian Liang finally met the Sister Fu he had been thinking about day and night. She had come out with Hippo to guide the sanitary work. He was so excited he couldn't speak.

Guo Fu knew it was time to clarify some things, so she asked Tian Liang to chat alone. He thought that after not seeing each other for so many years, there would be countless things to say, but in reality, they fell into silence after ten minutes or so. After chatting a bit more, both realized that the other was no longer on the same path.

"Is the Chief good to you?" Tian Liang remembered that as the last sentence he asked.

"Good," Guo Fu replied, wearing a faint smile. Her face, which had lost its childishness, was so dignified and beautiful.

After Guo Fu left, Tian Liang sat in a daze in the ward for a long time. When Hou Qing made her rounds, she found he hadn't left yet. Tian Liang told Hou Qing about his meeting with Guo Fu, saying he felt life had suddenly lost its goal and he didn't know the meaning of his existence.

Hou Qing wasn't good at comforting others either. She held back for a long time, then suddenly remembered a philosophical sentence she once heard Chief Lin Motian say, so she gave it to Tian Liang. She said, "There are two great tragedies between old friends: one is that you can never see the person you want to see, and the other is that you see them."

Tian Liang cried, weeping bitterly in front of a woman for the first time.

Later, when the fighting settled down a bit, the Senate decided to launch a vigorous construction movement in Guangdong and Guangxi. Due to an extreme shortage of local cadres, they selected some soldiers and officers unsuited for further development in the army to transfer to civilian jobs and support local construction. Tian Liang was on the list of these cadres. Hou Qing's younger brother, Hou Wenyong, first served as the district mayor of Nanhai District, then was transferred to be the Secretary-General of Guangzhou Special City, still in charge of Nanhai District. So, through this relationship, Hou Qing arranged for Tian Liang to be placed in the important position of the Nanhai National Demonstration School.

Of course, Tian Liang might not know all the stories behind this.

When he received the notice, he was completely bewildered. With his education and qualifications, any position was possible for his retirement arrangement, except that he never thought he would be sent to the education department.

The two hats of Principal of Nanhai National Demonstration School and Education Inspector of Nanhai County—setting aside the size—made Tian Liang, who knew his own level well, hurriedly go to the personnel department to ask if there was a "mistake."

Unexpectedly, the personnel department insisted there was no mistake. Tian Liang had no choice but to take office.

This Nanhai National School was one of the three "basic points" of the Senate's educational institutions in Guangdong. The first was naturally the Guangzhou National Demonstration School, a comprehensive full-time school replicated from the Fangcaodi model. It included three levels of education: junior primary, senior primary, and middle school. A ten-year education model. Based on the students' academic performance, both the senior primary and middle school stages would eliminate students who couldn't keep up and admit excellent students. Those who could finally graduate were the elite among the naturalized citizens.

Because resources were limited, there was only one such "high-level school" across Guangdong and Guangxi. What would be established next with slight universal significance were the "National Schools" in various places.

Although these National Schools were called National Schools, they were essentially "primary schools." According to Hu Qingbai's plan, during the Second Five-Year Plan, Guangdong was to establish a "National Demonstration Senior Primary School" in every county and a "National Demonstration Junior Primary School" in every town.

And the Nanhai National Demonstration School that Tian Liang served as principal of was actually such a "National Senior Primary School."

Although called "Nanhai County National Demonstration School," because a Guangzhou Demonstration School was already established within Guangzhou City, to embody the ideology of serving the townships, the Nanhai National Demonstration School was located west of Guangzhou City, adjacent to Dali Town in the newly built Foshan County.

When Tian Liang arrived at Dali, he had on hand only five naturalized citizen normal school students and five "old-man soldiers" and "half-disabled soldiers" discharged to serve as both handymen and guards. Exactly a squad of people formed the team for the Nanhai County National Demonstration School.

Although it was a key project of the education sector, Hu Qingbai couldn't bring out extra investment to build school buildings—not to mention this county demonstration school, even the Guangzhou Demonstration School currently had to occupy the Guangzhou Prefecture Confucian Temple to make do. So the school site Tian Liang received was confiscated "enemy property." It was originally the ancestral shrine of a large local family. Hanging up a sign, the school opened for business.

Once the school opened, it had to recruit students. The Senate couldn't yet achieve compulsory education. Students still needed to bear the tuition themselves for enrollment. For tuition, Hu Qingbai actually set it very low. Strictly calculated, even if this national school was fully enrolled, the tuition received wouldn't be enough for the wages of these eleven people. Not to mention that ten percent of them were public-funded students.

That said, more than two months after Tian Liang took office, having spent great effort running around promoting it, and seeing the spring semester opening imminent, there were still more than thirty vacancies in the two hundred spots for the first academic year.
