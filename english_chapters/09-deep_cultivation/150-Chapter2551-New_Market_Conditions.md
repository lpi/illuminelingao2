# Chapter 2551 - New Market Conditions

"If you'll excuse me for a moment, comrades." Li Qiwei cupped his hands to the two.

"Please attend to your business—commerce takes priority," Li Shan said courteously. He watched Li Qiwei step forward, unroll the cloth, and go through his usual routine: shaking his head and finding faults. After a round of haggling, he finally quoted: "Two bolts of native cloth, three *jiao* four *fen* and six *wen* in total."

"Why has the cotton cloth price dropped?" The seller was somewhat surprised at the quote. "Yesterday my neighbor came to sell and still got two *jiao* per bolt!"

"Can't be helped—there's been too much cloth this month, too many sellers," Manager Li said with a helpless expression. "Besides, yours is cloth woven from native yarn—the worst market right now! Nobody wants this stuff anymore..."

"Boss! Please have pity—can you add just one *fen*? Even five *wen* would do!"

"Brother, do you think I'm running some big operation here? There's the rent to pay, workers to feed..." Li Qiwei put on his "barely hanging on" bitter face. "I'm just making porter's wages. If you want a better price, from now on buy machine yarn, or at least improved yarn to weave your cloth!"

"Machine yarn is expensive. Our village grows cotton—we spin and weave ourselves. Buying yarn isn't worth it..." The weaver shook his head repeatedly.

The next several cloth sellers were similarly slaughtered by Manager Li's blade, each returning in defeat.

"See that? Doesn't it have that 'Paying More for Three and Five *Dou*' feeling?" Zou Biao nudged Li Shan.

"This will probably become the norm going forward," Li Shan said quietly. He was secretly puzzled—hadn't cotton cloth prices risen considerably? From what he was seeing, prices were falling.

Li Qiwei finished with his customers and hurried back to attend to them. He offered tea and produced cigarettes—Li Shan noticed they were Shengchuan brand! This shopkeeper was really a man of taste.

Li Shan was confused about the cotton prices and asked: "Has the cotton cloth market fallen? Yesterday I saw it was still rising..."

"It was still rising yesterday. But the market changed today." Li Qiwei saw that they had declined the cigarettes and brought out a plate of betel nuts instead—both men politely refused this as well.

"What's the situation?" Li Shan asked.

"Originally there was a big buy order for cotton cloth every day. The quantity varied, but even the smallest order was too big for any single firm in the market to take—several of us had to split it," Li Qiwei explained. "But the day before yesterday this big buy order didn't appear—not a single bolt was purchased..."

Zou Biao furrowed his brow: "Whose buy order?"

"The Nanyang Company," Li Qiwei said. "From the very first day of trading, they've been buying continuously. Not only large quantities, but all cheap coarse cloth. That immediately drove up prices. Everyone else saw the market was so good and followed suit..."

Li and Zou both recalled the State Council and Enterprise Planning Institute joint notice: to promote market economy and private manufacturing, materials that could be procured on the market should be purchased through market channels.

"So why did they stop buying?"

"I don't know—probably they've bought enough." Li Qiwei said, "The day before yesterday when there were no orders, there were only scattered small orders. Everyone was hoping they'd put in orders the next day..."

"There were no orders the day before yesterday, and probably none yesterday either?"

"Exactly. So as soon as the market opened today, coarse cloth prices dropped..."

"How much did they fall?"

"For native cloth woven from native yarn, I was paying two *jiao* yesterday. Today it's one *jiao* seven *fen* three *wen*. That's a drop of two *fen* seven *wen*..."

Li Shan did a quick calculation—the decline already exceeded twenty percent. He was stunned.

In Guangzhou, two yuan was enough to sustain basic living expenses for a family of four. Earning two *fen* seven *wen* less per bolt was significant.

"Can you sell the cloth you're buying now?"

"Yes. Native cloth is cheap and sells easily," Li Qiwei said. "As long as the price is right, there'll always be buyers."

"Besides the lack of big buy orders, are there any other reasons?"

---

"When there's more cloth on the market, prices naturally fall," Li Qiwei said. "It's already late June. Next month the Portuguese merchant ships will arrive in Guangzhou, and another large batch of Indian cloth will dock. Market cloth prices will fall another wave then."

When Li Shan asked about "machine yarn," Li Qiwei praised it: "That's truly top-quality yarn! Uniform, fine, strong—runs smoothly on the loom without breaking. Many workshops and weavers want to buy machine yarn."

"Then why does everyone still use native yarn?"

"Because it's expensive!" Li Qiwei looked at him strangely. "Everyone knows machine yarn is good, but the price is too high."

So machine yarn and improved yarn hadn't shaken the native cloth market. Machine yarn production was still limited, at "premium quality, premium price" level. Native yarn, with near-zero labor costs, could still dominate the low-end market.

"Is there separate buying and selling of locally-made yarn?" he continued.

"Of course. Before machine yarn, cotton yarn was all home-spun. Families without looms would sell their yarn. Spinning requires almost no capital—as long as you have cotton and labor..."

"Are there any large-scale yarn buyers locally?"

"Yes—the big cloth stores do it. They have more capital and backing from officials or gentry."

"And are there any large-scale yarn sellers?"

"Haven't seen any. The Australians selling machine yarn in bulk are the first."

Just then, an assistant brought in the "Market Dynamics" bulletin. Li Qiwei looked at it and sighed: "Prices have dropped again! Even cotton yarn is down! Tomorrow's market is going to be even worse."

The assistant said: "Boss! Should we stop buying cloth..."

"Not yet," Li Qiwei thought for a moment. "From now on, all cloth, regardless of type, lower by five *fen*!"

"What? Prices dropped again?"

"That's right, and this time it's across the board!" Li Qiwei handed the market report to Li Shan. "Not just cotton cloth falling—cotton yarn is falling, even raw cotton is starting to fall..." He called an assistant over: "Go back to the city immediately. Tell my father-in-law to sell all the paper cotton he's holding right now, no matter what the price!"

Li Shan looked at the report. Sure enough, all cotton-related prices had fallen. Both men grew tense. Hearing the manager order the sale of paper cotton, Li Shan asked:

"What? You bought paper cotton too?!"

"I didn't—it was my father-in-law!" Li Qiwei's face showed anxiety. "My wife probably put her private savings into it too..."

"I've heard paper cotton prices have been rising daily. Selling now would still mean profit."

"That's true, comrades," Li Qiwei's anxiety eased slightly. "I'm just worried he'll be greedy and won't sell in time! Paper cotton has dipped before and bounced back."

"How do you know it won't bounce back this time?"

"Isn't it obvious? Right now cotton cloth and yarn prices are falling across the board. How can paper cotton for cotton that won't be delivered for months not fall? Once the Portuguese ships arrive and Indian cloth enters the market, cloth prices will fall even faster. At that point, this paper cotton will just be worthless paper!"
