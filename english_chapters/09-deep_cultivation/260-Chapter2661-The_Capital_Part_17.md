# Chapter 2661: The Capital (Part 17)

Little Bazi, holding a letter in his hand, led Wu Kaidi quickly into the living room. As soon as he entered, he said to Li Rufeng, "Mister Wu has brought a letter." After speaking, he presented the letter in his hands with both hands.

Wu Kaidi flashed out from behind Little Bazi, walked to Li Rufeng, and said, "The letter was thrown in around the *Yin* hour [3-5 AM] yesterday. A headless arrow shot it into the Leng residence. The letter is addressed to me. Since Master Leng's accident, I have been running inside and out to manage things. The bandits must surely think I am in charge. I rushed over immediately after getting the letter."

Li Rufeng nodded, didn't reply, and immediately unfolded the letter to read it silently.

The letter was not long. Li Rufeng read it very carefully. After reading it repeatedly several times, he gently rubbed the letter paper with his hand, then brought it close to his nose to sniff, before handing the letter to Liao Sanniang beside him.

Liao Sanniang took it and pinched the letter paper. The texture of the paper was rough. The letter only had a salutation; it was an unsigned "white-headed letter," also known as a "life-demanding letter." The letter was written in cinnabar, red as blood, shocking to the eye.

Liao Sanniang focused her eyes to read carefully. The letter wrote: *"To Brother Wu Kaidi, personally open. We, humble servants, have suffered from the chaos of war and the invasion and violence of powerful bullies. The common people have exhausted their fat and blood to fill the jackals and tigers. Our livelihood is in dire straits, unable to bear the insults and abuse, forced into the grass and wilderness. We have long admired your Master's benevolence and joy in giving, his virtue of broadly relieving the distressed. We, humble servants, admiring your reputation, respectfully invite Lord Leng to linger and stay for a short while at our humble place. We shamelessly borrow one hundred thousand taels of full-standard fine silver to help relieve our distress. On the day the flowered silver arrives, we will respectfully send Lord Leng back intact. Brother, you should think carefully. Do not inform the officials. Absolutely do not shift the disaster to your Master, causing Lord Leng to suffer the humiliation of the axe and saw. Please be sure to heed this. As for the transaction of person and money, when and where, wait for another invitation later."*

Liao Sanniang finished reading seriously and felt quite surprised. She turned her head to ask Wu Kaidi, " The style of this letter doesn't look like bandits. The wording is so polite, yet the actions are ruthless, taking lives immediately upon striking. Strange. Did you see the person who shot the arrow?"

Wu Kaidi shook his head from the side and said, "There were people keeping watch outside the door, but there were only hanging lanterns at the main gate. The alley inside was pitch black, and they didn't see anything. The arrow was shot into the courtyard in a curve from the surrounding roofs. The arrowhead was wrapped in cotton cloth, and a jade hair-binding ring was sleeved on the arrow shaft. It is of Lingao make, bearing the mark of Purple Light Tower. It was worn by Master Leng when he went out. When the arrow shaft landed, the patrol dogs barked endlessly. The firemen on night duty came to check, and only then discovered it."

Li Rufeng took the letter from Liao Sanniang's hand, looked at it again, and said, "The strokes of these characters are vigorous and powerful, not the work of a day or two. It is not something a rough fellow can do. It looks like the handiwork of an old scholar who writes letters for others."

Hearing this, Liao Sanniang frowned slightly and said, "There are many people who make a living by writing; it is difficult to investigate. For such a secret matter, the bandits would mostly not be willing to let others write for them. Among that group of bandits, there should be scholars. These characters have no trembling or dragging, the structure is neat, and the brush movement is fluent. The handwriting is undisguised, showing they are not afraid of us recognizing the handwriting and tracing it. It can be seen they are not our acquaintances. The letter paper is a common item on the market, nothing special. Although cinnabar is expensive, writing takes little, and a little bit from anywhere is enough, so it's hard to trace. Just relying on this letter, we can't see too many clues."

Li Rufeng paced two steps in the hall, sat back in his chair, and said in a deep voice, "The letter has arrived, telling us to wait for further orders. They will definitely seek a middleman to contact us and discuss the ransom."

Liao Sanniang's eyes flashed, and she said, "Seeking a middleman means the handover is likely not near the capital city. Are the bandits from a surrounding stronghold? This group of bandits includes poor scholars who write, archers who control bowstrings, spies in the city, and riders who run horses. So fully equipped, they seem to be doing big things. It raises one's interest."

Li Rufeng stroked the beard on his chin and said, "We can only guess blindly now. Such a life-demanding letter is usually delivered to the home the next day. The Leng residence received it after nearly two days. I suppose the bandits were delayed on the road passing the hair-ring back and forth as a token. They also wanted to drag it out for two days to observe the wind direction of the Leng residence."

Liao Sanniang nodded, turned to look at Wu Kaidi, and asked, "Mister Wu, can we scrape together enough for the one hundred thousand ransom silver?"

Wu Kaidi sucked in a big breath of cold air, looking troubled. "One hundred thousand flowered silver is not a small number. Although the shop is now sealed and we don't worry about a run, the pure silver in the shop is also limited. Selling off all of Delong's liquid assets would probably be enough, but without authorization from the Head Office, privately diverting it cannot be entered into the accounts. I'm afraid it will be hard to explain. This is one thing. Secondly, once the Master returns and Delong reopens, we will inevitably need tens of thousands of taels of silver for turnover."

Liao Sanniang lowered her head to ponder for a moment and said, " According to the Australian algorithm, one hundred thousand silver should be three thousand seven hundred specified *jin* [kilograms/great catties]. It cannot be transported without heavy carts. It is very eye-catching. If large carts start transporting, I fear it will immediately alarm the government, letting people know and causing trouble."

Wu Kaidi said, "This matter cannot be hidden. Judge Liu of Shuntian Prefecture comes to Delong every day now; he hates that he can't live here. However, if we want to redeem the person, Prefecture Yin Zhong will not oppose it. As long as the person returns, Delong reopens, and the trouble subsides, he will consider the matter settled. If Manager Leng remains missing for a long time, his pressure will be greater."

Li Rufeng said in a deep voice, "I understand. In that case, we don't need to do much with Shuntian Prefecture, nothing more than the checkpoint of going out of the city. This isn't hard. It's nothing more than clearing the joints and spending more silver so that the Wardens' Office and the gate guards won't interrogate Delong and Heliansheng's people. Do not make a noise. Break it into parts. Only select reliable people. Regardless of carts, horses, or people, smuggle it out little by little, piecemeal, to a gathering place outside the city. One hundred thousand taels is not that much; it can be gathered in three or two days. It just takes some effort. When the bandits killed and captured people, they had already alarmed the government. The so-called 'do not inform officials' means we cannot communicate with the government regarding paying ransom and investigating the case. Other things do not matter."

Speaking of this, Li Rufeng paused, scraped the whiskers on his chin, and said with some worry, "There is only one thing to worry about. In Lingao, kidnapping cases often end with killing the hostage after kidnapping. When redeeming the hostage, one often only receives a corpse."

Liao Sanniang pondered for a moment and shook her head. "The Bureau Chief might be overthinking it. It may not necessarily be so here. The system of the Great Song's Qiongzhou Prefecture differs from the world of the Great Ming. Kidnapping and killing hostages happen frequently in Lingao because the Political Security Bureau and the Police Bureau are astute and fierce. There are also photo-shadowing techniques. The daily newspapers publish illustrated wanted notices every day, and patrolmen of the Police Bureau search according to the image. Bandit strongholds outside Lingao City have also long been swept away. Inside the city, there is household registration everywhere, and every family has a doorplate. It is extremely difficult to keep hostages outside or inside the city. verifying the hostage, handing over money, and redeeming the person—every step involves sky-high risks. The official notes and silver dollars in Lingao all have Australian codes, which can be traced to the root, making money hard to spend. Qiongzhou is bordered by the sea on four sides. When a case happens, one can only flee to the miasmic lands, with nowhere to hide. Once caught and brought to justice, judging the crimes, it is immediate hanging or shooting, absolutely no leniency. Therefore, those who dare to kidnap for ransom are all heinous and desperate people. It is difficult to hide the hostages, and for fear of leaking the secret, they often kill the hostages. Moreover, they are mostly just a few scattered individuals working together, not forming a climate.

"The Great Ming is different. A little further from the capital, within the territory of North Zhili, there are many bandits relying on mountains to establish strongholds and gathering to roar in one area. Such people do not fear government suppression. When soldiers come, they scatter; when soldiers leave, they gather. Matters of redeeming people are led and bridged by village elders, trading in the stronghold. The concerns in Lingao about hiding people and searches do not need to be scrupled at all. Thus, they act with some rules instead. As long as the government doesn't mix in to mess things up, they will release people upon receiving money in the stronghold. We must verify the person when paying the ransom. Before the bandits get the money, they will absolutely not harm Master Leng easily."

Li Rufeng pondered for a long time, gritted his teeth, and said, "Allocate funds, handle it! Now the matter is clear: the bandits just kidnapped the person for wealth. There are only two situations where bandits kill the hostage: one is the family reports to the officials, officials investigate deeply, soldiers advance to suppress, and forced to a dead end, they kill the hostage; the second is when ransom is hopeless, they can't get silver, fly into a rage born of shame, and kill people. Now, placing Master Leng's safety as the priority, we cannot be too calculating about the amount of ransom silver. The heavier the ransom silver, the safer Master Leng is. Bargaining back and forth delays time and only increases variables. At this time, we must absolutely not offend the bandits. Worse comes to worst, the responsibility for diverting this money, I will bear together with Mister Wu."

Wu Kaidi, who was beside him, was stunned hearing this. Then his face suddenly became bloodless. He didn't know how he was suddenly made to bear this sky-high responsibility with Li Rufeng. He wanted to open his mouth to argue a few sentences, but didn't know where to start. Objecting wasn't right; agreeing wasn't right either. He flapped his mouth a few times but couldn't say anything, resembling a dying fish that had dried up.

Liao Sanniang said, "There is one more type of killing the hostage."

Li Rufeng was stunned and asked, "What else?"

Liao Sanniang said softly, "Unpredictable changes."

Not waiting for Li Rufeng to ask, Liao Sanniang continued, "If Master Leng offends them with words or attempts to escape, it will annoy the bandits into dealing a killer hand. Others, such as meeting officials halfway, or even just the bandits feeling unhappy, can all lead to unexpected changes. Life and death are just in a thought. Kidnapping for ransom is very different from murder and robbery. In murder and robbery, when the case happens, the person is already dead and goods lost; the matter is set, only depending on how to catch the culprit. In kidnapping, we and the bandits are all in motion at all times. The bandits are moving, and we are moving too. During Political Security Bureau training, it was said that the longer a kidnapping case drags on, the more dangerous it is. In Lingao, if the case cannot be solved or person redeemed within ten days, there is a sixty percent chance the hostage will die. Here in the capital, there is no post office or telegraph, let alone Political Security or Police Bureau. Message transmission is very slow, and control over the countryside is weak. The time cost might double. But within twenty days is also critical. The Great Ming is now in turmoil and chaos; everything is unpredictable."

Li Rufeng slapped his thigh and shouted loudly, "Since the incident happened, this matter has slipped out of control. Don't think about what can't be predicted; just adapt to changes. We are weak in the capital and can't do much. Now that there is news, it is better than us fumbling blindly outside. Mister Wu, send an urgent message to Lingao. The urgent task is to allocate funds. We are anxious, and the bandits are anxious too. We are anxious for Master Leng to return home; they are anxious to take the money and flee."

After speaking, he said, "We will return to Heliansheng immediately. There are Shuntian Prefecture bailiffs guarding outside here. I think no one dares to come to the door to 'speak the ticket' [negotiate terms]. If the negotiator can't come to the door, this matter becomes dangerous!"

After Li Rufeng finished speaking, he grabbed the wood-like Wu Kaidi who was standing dazed and walked out.
