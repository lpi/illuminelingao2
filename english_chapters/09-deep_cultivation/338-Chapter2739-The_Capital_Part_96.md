# Chapter 2739: The Capital (Part 95)

The roving bandits required no special mention. Thus far, several notorious groups had proven utterly predictable—scattering like leaves whenever government troops approached, only to reconvene the moment the soldiers withdrew. They swarmed like bees and ants, never amounting to any real threat.

The Manchus presented a more complex picture. They had once seemed on the verge of extinction. Yet after Huang Taiji proclaimed himself emperor and changed the dynastic name, the previously declining "Great Jin" had somehow found new life.

Huang Taiji's ambitions far exceeded those of the old slave, who had only known how to carve out a petty kingdom and conduct raids. More importantly, Huang Taiji possessed the abilities to match his grand designs.

Given Li Luoyou's position and extensive commercial connections in the capital, Huang Taiji had even dispatched subordinates to write letters of persuasion through Liaohai Trading's Shenyang branch, urging him to secretly serve the "Great Qing" in exchange for rich rewards. Li Luoyou was aware that some Shanxi merchants engaged in Mongolian trade had already "fallen in"—and were accumulating wealth at astonishing speed.

But none of this could make him forget the horrors of the Guangning garrison's evacuation. That was an irreconcilable blood feud.

Only toward the Kun were his feelings truly complicated. Whether their claim of being "Great Song descendants" was genuine or fabricated, they were at least of Huaxia lineage, sharing the same language and script. Compared to the "Little Chinas" of Korea and Annam, one might even consider them the legitimate heirs.

Yet their methods in Hainan and the ideas conveyed through their interactions revealed them to be profoundly different from traditional Huaxia. Never mind Korea or Vietnam—they diverged greatly even from the Europeans he had encountered.

If the Kun were to take over Huaxia, what would become of it? A realm of sage-kings like Yao and Shun, or a land fallen to barbarism?

Li Luoyou held little hope for the future. In any case, his own days were numbered. When a man dies, the lamp goes out. Even the greatest catastrophe would no longer be his concern. He had made arrangements for business matters, though he accepted that the fragmentation or even destruction of the family enterprise amid turbulent times was probably inevitable.

His children had all established their own families and careers. Whether their futures brought fortune or disaster was for them to determine. As for his greedy brothers and nephews, they too had received their share. Whether they could keep it depended on their own abilities.

He had made one final preparation: sending two concubines and their children to the south. One went to Macau, entrusted to Jesuit friends; another traveled secretly to Lingao, placed in Gu Baocheng's care.

Should the world descend into chaos and all perish together, at least some of the Li bloodline would survive. He would at least have honored his ancestors.

"Grand Manager Leng sent such precious gifts—he must have something important to ask of the Master."

Madam Qiao's words roused him from his reverie.

"What he wants, I roughly know." Li Luoyou gave a cold snort. "It's not an easy matter to handle."

Madam Qiao dared not respond. After a long pause, she ventured, "This medicine truly suits the Master's condition. If it can be done, perhaps the Master might consider helping him."

To help or not? Li Luoyou found himself quite hesitant.

Though bedridden at home, he was not cut off from news in the capital. Leng Ningyun's kidnapping, his subsequent return, the secret plot to run on Delong—he had heard something of all these developments.

Yet he never intervened in Delong's affairs. His firms maintained extensive dealings with Delong, but these were purely business relationships. He kept his distance from the Australians' activities in the north and had not invested.

The Australians harbored grand designs. He had no desire to entangle himself for a few coins and thereby offend the court.

Though the court was at its wit's end, destroying him along with his family and business would still require little effort on their part. This was especially true in the capital, where hidden dragons and crouching tigers lurked, with powerful households on every street. Despite his considerable enterprise and connections, he still had to tread carefully.

Who had kidnapped Manager Leng—he did not know and had no intention of finding out. But the run on Delong was obviously not Shanxi House's doing alone.

That Shanxi House wanted to crush Delong was no secret in the capital. But Delong had Eunuch Yang's backing. After Shanxi House's last failed scheme, they had lowered their banners and retreated. That they had suddenly resumed operations suggested someone else was directing matters from the shadows.

Whoever dared challenge Delong was obviously no ordinary official. For caution's sake, he should stay out of it.

But if he completely ignored Delong's fate, he could not explain himself to the Kun either.

After much deliberation, he concluded that he could only "help secretly," not "assist openly."

With this, his thinking became clear. He instructed Madam Qiao: "Call Zhang Cheng in to see me."

Zhang Cheng was one of his personal servants, entrusted with handling important matters.

"Handle this quietly," Li Luoyou directed. "Remember to find notes that have been stored for some time—don't specially exchange for new ones. And don't open any new notes."

Wu Kaidi did not go to the Li residence. He was stretched thin, having to visit each of the small peers personally. He could only let Leng Ningyun go alone. After returning, he grew even more anxious and uneasy, uncertain how this famous capital merchant would treat Manager Leng.

Though Manager Leng had seemed confident, apparently certain of Li Luoyou's cooperation, Wu Kaidi knew well the dangers of commerce and the fickleness of human sentiment. Never mind being mere business partners—even life-saving grace might count for nothing in times of crisis. So he remained restless with worry.

When he saw Leng Ningyun return with a slight smile, he relaxed somewhat. After exchanging greetings, he asked hurriedly: "Master, what did Grand Manager Li say?"

"That thousand-year-old fox—what could he say? Naturally just vague murmurs." Leng Ningyun laughed. "He wouldn't commit to a single solid word."

Wu Kaidi said anxiously, "Master, you can still laugh..." Suddenly realizing he was being too presumptuous, he moderated his tone. "This is no laughing matter. What exactly happened?"

"Calm yourself." Leng Ningyun settled into his seat at ease, drank a bowl of tea, and ordered some pastries. Only then did he slowly recount the visit.

"Grand Manager Li was very polite. However, he definitely won't publicly support Delong. He's wary of whoever is backing the other side."

"Does he know who's behind it?"

"I suspect he may have some idea. But anyone who dares move against us in the capital is no ordinary figure." Leng Ningyun sighed. "Even Grand Manager Li wouldn't want to invite trouble without good reason."

"Then—then—then we came away empty-handed?"

"Not entirely." Leng Ningyun patted the visiting case beside him. "Here's what we harvested. Open it and see."

Wu Kaidi hurriedly opened the case. Inside lay a thick stack of mulberry paper, some yellowed with age, some newer, some even stained. But he recognized them immediately—all banknotes!

"Banknotes?!"

"Correct. Thirty thousand taels in total."

Wu Kaidi flipped through them. These notes had all been issued by Shanxi House. They were of various ages—apparently specially collected. This Old Li was quite something!

"A pity it's only thirty thousand..." Wu Kaidi calculated mentally. Adding the small peers' loans, that came to roughly fifty thousand.

"Fifty thousand is plenty." Leng Ningyun swallowed a pastry and clapped his hands. "The banquet on the fifth is the key. Unless we thoroughly subdue them at the banking guild feast, even if we obtain three hundred thousand taels to weather this storm, they'll remain a hidden danger!"

"True enough..."

"What did the small peers say?" Leng Ningyun cut him off.

"I visited each one today. All six small peers are sympathetic and willing to help. But they're all afraid of Shanxi House..."

Wu Kaidi explained that the small peers, having little capital and few connections, did not dare offend Shanxi House. Yet they were also unhappy about Shanxi House's domination and bullying in the capital's money market. So they hoped Delong could pull through. Thus, each had agreed to the short-term loan—but requested that Delong keep the arrangement confidential.

"...Naturally. As long as they put up money, we'll certainly be grateful."

"Master, we'll certainly be grateful, but this money..." Wu Kaidi hesitated, then pulled out a folder with a wry smile.

"All notes? Notes are fine too. We never expected them to put up actual silver."

But upon opening it, he was stunned: inside were all Delong notes!

"Twenty-seven thousand three hundred twenty-two taels, seven mace, one fen in total." Wu Kaidi said. "I've counted."

Leng Ningyun did not know whether to laugh or cry. The people coming to run on the bank wanted to exchange Delong notes back to him. And now here were over twenty thousand more Delong notes. Who was he supposed to exchange them with?

"Well, at least they've helped clear twenty-seven thousand taels' worth of notes from the market."

"The managers all said: if Delong doesn't fall, return the notes to them when the time comes—no interest needed. But if..." He hesitated, leaving the rest unsaid.

If it fell, these notes would be nothing but waste paper anyway.

These southern folks truly knew how to calculate!

Then again, sending Delong notes still represented genuine silver support, clearly stating their position. Objectively, it also reduced the pressure Delong faced from the run on the market.

"This sentiment is considerable enough." Leng Ningyun nodded. "Interest should still be paid."

"Calculating this way, we still have a gap of seventy or eighty thousand."

"That depends on tonight."

"Are you confident, Master?" Wu Kaidi could not help asking again.

"Fifty-fifty." He answered as before.

Wu Kaidi felt stifled. Though he did not hold a single share in Delong and was merely a "senior clerk" earning twelve taels a month, he and Leng Ningyun had worked well together over the years. The Delong empire in the capital was partly his achievement too. His attachment ran deep.

Though Leng Ningyun could not claim complete confidence, he was quite certain about tomorrow's meeting. Before he had even returned to Delong, Hexiang had already transferred intelligence on Shanxi House to the liaison officer sent by the Reconnaissance Division's Special Reconnaissance Team commanding this operation.

He had complete faith in the Special Reconnaissance Team's capabilities. Frankly, if the business did not have to continue and he could not be seen as a "monster," he would have loved to have snipers shoot several people dead at tomorrow night's banquet—to experience the thrill of killing silently while chatting and laughing.

But he could not tell Wu Kaidi about any of this. Besides, the capital was different from elsewhere—the net was tight. Even the Special Reconnaissance Team might not be able to come and go freely. So he had only proposed a "deterrence" objective. How to implement it was left to the commanding officer.
