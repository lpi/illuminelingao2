# Chapter 2739: The Capital (Part 95)

The roving bandits went without saying. So far, several notorious bandit groups would scatter when government troops closed in, only to regroup when the troops withdrew. Swarming like bees and ants, they never amounted to much.

As for the Manchus, they'd once seemed on their last legs. Yet after Huang Taiji declared himself emperor and changed the dynastic name, the previously declining "Great Jin" had somehow revitalized.

Huang Taiji's ambitions far exceeded the old slave's, who only knew how to claim a petty kingdom and raid. Crucially, his abilities could support his ambitions.

Given Li Luoyou's position and commercial connections in the capital, Huang Taiji had even ordered subordinates to write persuasion letters through Liaohai Trading's Shenyang branch, urging him to secretly serve the "Great Qing" with promises of rich rewards. He knew some Shanxi merchants doing Mongol trade had already "fallen in"—and were accumulating wealth at astonishing speed.

But none of this made him forget the horrors of the Guangning garrison's evacuation—an irreconcilable blood feud.

Only toward these Short-Hairs were his feelings complicated. Whether the Short-Hairs' "Great Song descendants" claim was true or false, they were at least descendants of the Huaxia lineage, sharing language and script. Compared to the "Little Chinas" of Korea and Annam, they could be considered the legitimate lineage.

Yet their measures in Hainan and the concepts conveyed through interactions showed they were very different from Huaxia. Never mind Korea or Vietnam—they differed greatly even from the Europeans he'd contacted.

If they took over Huaxia, what would it become? A realm of Yao and Shun, or a barbarian land?

Li Luoyou held little hope for the future. Anyway, his days were numbered. When a man dies, the light goes out. Even the greatest catastrophe would no longer concern him. He'd made arrangements for business matters, though the splitting or even destruction of the family enterprise in turbulent times was probably inevitable.

His children had all established their own families and careers. Whether their futures brought fortune or disaster was up to them. As for the greedy brothers and nephews, they'd gotten their share too. Whether they could keep it was up to their own abilities.

He'd made one final preparation: sending two concubines and their children to the south—one to Macau, entrusted to Jesuit friends; another secretly to Lingao, in Gu Baocheng's care.

Should the world descend into chaos and all perish together, at least some of the Li bloodline would survive. He would at least have honored his ancestors.

"Grand Manager Leng sent such precious gifts—he must have something important to ask of the Master."

Madam Qiao's words roused him from his reverie.

"What he wants, I roughly know." Li Luoyou snorted coldly. "It's not easy to handle."

Madam Qiao dared not respond. After a long while, she said, "This medicine really suits the Master's condition. If it can be done, perhaps the Master might help him."

To help or not? Li Luoyou was quite hesitant.

Though bedridden at home, he wasn't cut off from news in the capital. Leng Ningyun's kidnapping, his return, someone secretly plotting to run on Delong... he knew something of all these.

But he never intervened in Delong's business. His firms had extensive dealings with Delong, but these were purely business relationships. He stayed away from the Australians' activities in the north and hadn't invested.

The Australians had grand designs. He didn't want to get involved for a few coins and offend the court.

Though the court was at its wit's end, destroying him and his family and business would still be effortless. Especially in the capital, where hidden dragons and crouching tigers lurked, with powerful households on every street. Despite his considerable enterprise and connections, he still had to be careful.

Who kidnapped Manager Leng—he didn't know and had no intention of finding out. But running on Delong obviously wasn't Shanxi House's doing alone.

That Shanxi House wanted to crush Delong was no secret in the capital. But Delong had Eunuch Yang's backing. After Shanxi House's last failed scheme, they'd lowered their banners. That they suddenly resumed operations showed someone else was directing from behind.

Whoever dared challenge Delong was obviously no ordinary official. For caution's sake, he should stay out of it.

But if he completely ignored Delong's fate, he couldn't explain himself to the Short-Hairs either.

After much thought, he could only "help secretly," not "assist openly."

With this, his thinking became completely clear. He told Madam Qiao: "Call Zhang Cheng in to see me."

Zhang Cheng was one of his personal servants, handling important matters.

"Handle this quietly," Li Luoyou instructed. "Remember to find old stored ones, don't specially exchange. Don't open new notes."

Wu Kaidi didn't go to the Li residence—he was stretched thin, having to visit each small peer. He could only let Leng Ningyun go alone. After returning, he was even more anxious and uneasy, not knowing how this famous capital merchant would treat Manager Leng.

Though Manager Leng was confident, seemingly certain of Li Luoyou's cooperation, Wu Kaidi knew well the dangers of commerce and the fickleness of human sentiment. Never mind just being business partners—even life-saving grace might not count in times of crisis. So he remained restless.

Seeing Leng Ningyun return with a slight smile, he relaxed somewhat. After exchanging greetings, he hurriedly asked: "Master, what did Grand Manager Li say?"

"That thousand-year-old cultivated fox—what could he say? Naturally just 'mm' and 'ah.'" Leng Ningyun laughed. "He wouldn't commit to a single solid word."

Wu Kaidi said anxiously, "Master, you can still laugh..." Suddenly realizing he was being too presumptuous, he moderated his tone. "This is no laughing matter. What exactly happened?"

"Calm yourself." Leng Ningyun sat down at ease, drank a bowl of tea, ordered some pastries, then slowly recounted.

"Grand Manager Li was very polite. However, he definitely won't publicly support Delong. He's also wary of the other side's backing."

"Does he know who's behind it?"

"I suspect he may have some idea. But anyone who dares move against us in the capital isn't ordinary." Leng Ningyun sighed. "Even Grand Manager Li wouldn't want to invite trouble for no reason."

"Then—then—then we came away empty-handed?"

"Not entirely." Leng Ningyun patted the visiting case beside him. "Here's the harvest. Open it and see."

Wu Kaidi hurriedly opened the case. Inside was a thick stack of mulberry paper, some old, some new, some even stained. But he immediately recognized them—all banknotes!

"Banknotes?!"

"Correct. Thirty thousand taels in total."

Wu Kaidi flipped through them. These notes were all issued by Shanxi House. Various ages—apparently specially collected. This Old Li was quite something!

"A pity it's only thirty thousand..." Wu Kaidi calculated mentally. Adding the small peers' loans, that made about fifty thousand.

"Fifty thousand is plenty." Leng Ningyun swallowed a pastry and clapped his hands. "The banquet on the fifth is the key. Unless we thoroughly subdue them at the banking guild feast, even if we get three hundred thousand taels to weather this, it'll remain a hidden danger!"

"True enough..."

"What did the small peers say?" Leng Ningyun cut him off.

"I visited each one today. All six small peers are sympathetic and willing to help. But they're all afraid of Shanxi House..."

Wu Kaidi explained that the small peers, having little capital and few connections, didn't dare offend Shanxi House. But they were also unhappy about Shanxi House's domination and bullying in the capital's money market. So they hoped Delong could pull through. Thus, each agreed to the short-term loan—but requested that Delong keep it confidential.

"...Naturally. As long as they put up money, we'll certainly be grateful."

"Master, we'll certainly be grateful, but this money..." Wu Kaidi hesitated, then pulled out a folder with a wry smile.

"All notes? Notes are fine too. We never expected them to put up silver."

But opening it, he was stunned: inside were all Delong notes!

"Twenty-seven thousand three hundred twenty-two taels, seven mace, one fen in total." Wu Kaidi said. "I've counted."

Leng Ningyun didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The people coming to run on the bank wanted to exchange Delong notes back to him. Now here were over twenty thousand more Delong notes. Who was he supposed to exchange them with?

"Well, at least they helped clear twenty-seven thousand taels' worth of notes from the market."

"The managers all said: if Delong doesn't fall, return the notes to them when the time comes—no interest needed. But if..." He hesitated, saying no more.

If it fell, these notes would be just waste paper anyway.

These southern folks really knew how to calculate!

Then again, them sending Delong notes was still genuine silver support, clearly stating their position. Objectively, it also reduced the run pressure Delong faced in the market.

"This sentiment is considerable enough." Leng Ningyun nodded. "Interest should still be paid."

"Calculating this way, we still have a gap of seventy or eighty thousand."

"That depends on tonight."

"Are you confident, Master?" Wu Kaidi couldn't help asking again.

"Fifty-fifty." He answered as before.

Wu Kaidi felt stifled. Though he didn't have a single share in Delong and was just a "senior clerk" earning twelve taels a month, he and Leng Ningyun had worked well together over the years. The Delong empire in the capital was partly his achievement too. The attachment was deep.

Though Leng Ningyun couldn't claim complete confidence, he was quite certain about tomorrow's meeting. Before he'd even returned to Delong, Hexiang had already transferred intelligence on Shanxi House to the liaison officer sent by the Reconnaissance Division's Special Reconnaissance Team commanding this operation.

He had complete faith in the Special Reconnaissance Team's capabilities. Frankly, if the business didn't have to continue and he couldn't be seen as a "monster," he would have loved to have snipers shoot several people dead at tomorrow night's banquet, to experience the thrill of killing silently while chatting and laughing.

But he couldn't tell Wu Kaidi about this. Besides, the capital was different from elsewhere—the net was tight. Even the Special Reconnaissance Team might not be able to come and go freely. So he'd only proposed a "deterrence" objective. How to implement it was left to the commanding officer.
