# Chapter 2612: Where the Stars Are

In the late Ming Dynasty, Nanhai County had six Patrol Divisions: Jinli, Wudoukou, Shen'an, Sanjiang, Huangding, and Jiangpu. Each Patrol Division had one Inspector and fifty conscripted bowmen. Among them, the Wudoukou Patrol Division office was located in Pingzhou Fort, twenty *li* from Foshan, while the closest one to Jiujiang was Jiangpu Patrol Division, also known as Ding'an Stockade, with its office located in the nearby Longjiang Fort.

Since the Senate took over the regime of the Great Ming Dynasty in the Two Guangs, the functions of the Patrol Division had been replaced by the National Army and township police stations. The National Army was basically stationed in the county seat and some important Patrol Divisions, while grassroots police stations were set up in Patrol Divisions and several larger markets.

For this inspection, Zhang Xiao instructed not to notify along the route in advance. First, to avoid local areas doing "homework" ahead of time; second, to reduce disturbance to grassroots institutions. Given the ability and quantity of the Senate's local cadres, they were already struggling with their work. If another "visit and inspection" came, it would inevitably cause chaos and disturb local work.

"Woo woo..." The long whistle sound resounded through the clouds. The Dafa boat slowly docked at Li Hai Market.

Today happened to be the market day of Jiujiang Great Market. Although the villagers in the market often saw Australian steamship fleets passing on the river, it was the first time recently that a steamship entered Jiujiang to dock. Attracted by this ear-splitting whistle, they slowly gathered towards the market entrance.

Battōtai soldiers holding Minié rifles trotted off the boat under the captain's command and lined up on the shore. Their majestic momentum suppressed the villagers' curiosity; no one dared to approach. Zhang Xiao and the others walked off the Dafa boat under the protection of special agents from the General Bureau of Senator Guards.

"Wonder what these people do..."

"Keep your voice down!" Many onlookers whispered to each other.

Zhang Xiao suddenly felt he had the posture of entering an enemy country deep. Such an atmosphere wasn't too good, so he cleared his throat and shouted to the villagers, "Fellow villagers, no need to panic! I am Zhang Xiao, the new Nanhai Magistrate appointed by the Grand Song Senate. I came here today to understand the conditions of the people..."

Listening to Zhang Xiao blathering on, the crowd of onlookers didn't seem to understand. At this time, Zhang Jiayu reminded, "Chief, dialects in Lingnan differ from village to village like mountains. Why not let me convey it?"

Just as Zhang Jiayu was about to speak, sharp police whistles sounded from behind the crowd. Five people with short hair, wearing Australian police uniforms, holding batons in one hand and revolvers in the other, pushed aside the crowd and squeezed through. Obviously, these few grassroots police station officers thought an accident had happened here.

The police didn't recognize Zhang Xiao, but the temperament of this group of people before them was extraordinary, and they were escorted by the National Army. Sharp-eyed ones soon recognized their direct superior from the visiting team, so the leading short and sturdy policeman immediately holstered his gun, stood at attention, gave a standard Fubo Army salute, and shouted, "Mo Yu, Director of Jiujiang Market Police Station, sends regards to the Chief!"

The other policemen also followed suit and saluted. Looking at their crooked salutes and indescribable police uniforms, Zhang Xiao sighed secretly in his heart, signaled them to be at ease, and said, "Comrades have worked hard! We are too conspicuous like this; let's settle down first before talking."

So Mo Yu led the police to clear the way, leading this sizable inspection team towards the police station.

Although Jiujiang Market was a big market, it was far less prosperous than Guangzhou City and Foshan at this time. There were no inns here capable of accommodating so many people, so the inspection team brought marching tents. A suitable site was chosen on the edge of the market, and soon a campsite of considerable scale was set up, with all functions complete.

Just settled down, Zhang Jiayu sat on the camp bed in his small tent, appearing somewhat dejected. Along the way, Chief Zhang asked either about water conservancy or agriculture. Just when he wanted to use his advantage as a local to make a small contribution, he was interrupted by the police. Truly, "a useless scholar is one hundred percent useless."

He felt stifled, so he went out of the tent to walk around the camp to relax.

After Zhao Hening finished packing her things, she walked out of the tent and saw Zhang Jiayu seeming somewhat unhappy. She stepped forward and asked, "Handsome boy, why so decadent?"

Seeing it was Zhao Hening, Zhang Jiayu couldn't help his heart beating faster. He lowered his head slightly, bowed, and said, "This student prides himself on being a local, familiar with the people's feelings, yet along the way failed to resolve worries and confusion for the Chief. Truly ashamed."

Hearing this, Zhao Hening felt Zhang Jiayu was actually a bit goofy, so she comforted, "Teacher Zhang is famous for being knowledgeable. You just follow and learn well."

"Miss Zhao is right!" Zhang Jiayu agreed.

Zhao Hening wasn't used to the word "Miss" (*Xiaojie*), and said, "I come from a poor family, what Miss or not Miss. Just call me Hening."

"This..." After a slight hesitation, Zhang Jiayu said, "Then I prefer to obey respectfully rather than decline."

"I'll just call you Jiayu then!" Zhao Hening spoke with no sense of seniority as always.

"As you wish."

"The name Jiayu feels a bit distinctively earthy."

"Indeed not as good-sounding as Hening."

"Of course, Hening is the name of a palace hall in the the Early Song Imperial Palace..."

The distance between a boy and a girl often closes in the blink of an eye. A handsome man like Zhang Jiayu would either be ostracized by everyone or become the dream lover of thousands of girls at Fangcao Di. Zhao Hening couldn't help gossiping and asked quietly, "Jiayu, do you have a girlfriend?"

"What is a girlfriend?" Zhang Jiayu naturally didn't know the concepts circulating in Fangcao Di.

"Girlfriend, well, is a sweetheart, hehehe..." Zhao Hening snickered.

Native women generally didn't step out of the main gate or the second gate before marriage, which is the literal meaning of staying in the boudoir. Except for very few opportunities like temple fairs, they never had contact with men. Zhang Jiayu naturally had no experience dealing with women in boudoirs and didn't know what Zhao Hening meant by asking this, saying, "Since ancient times, marriage follows the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers. I have neither a career nor an official rank now, so I haven't considered marriage."

The Zhang family's economic conditions were relatively poor. The Senate's liberation of Guangzhou interrupted his original path of imperial examinations. Naturally, few people were willing to have a blind date with a poor scholar with no future.

"So boring, like a block of wood." Zhao Hening mumbled. Men of this age in this era who hadn't married yet were very few, either because the family was too poor for others to look at, or because they had defects like physical disability or weakness. So she couldn't get into the bottom of it.

By the time everything in the camp was arranged, it was already evening. During this period, many nearby wealthy families heard that the Australian's new magistrate actually brought a team of cadres to the countryside. They sent the talkers of the clan one after another, all wanting to invite this "parent official" to stay temporarily in the clan's big mansion or ancestral hall, to entertain him well to show their feelings and build relationships with the Australians. However, Zhang Xiao and Li Yao'er declined the gentry's kindness with the excuse of travel fatigue, only accepting the melons, fruits, fish, and poultry sent over.

At night, the bonfire in the camp crackled. The National Army responsible for patrols was still walking around. Zhang Xiao put his hands behind his back and looked at the waxing crescent moon in the sky. having just finished assigning the next day's work to the accompanying cadres, he wasn't sleepy yet, so he paced to the edge of the camp.

Without the neon light pollution of cities in the old time-space, nor the sulfur-nitrogen pollutants and dust spewing from the huge chimneys of industrial heavy towns, the starry sky appeared exceptionally clear and bright, shining in reflection with the continuous fish ponds, making one feel as if placed in a sea of stars, just like looking up at the Milky Way when he was a child, mesmerized.

"The starry sky tonight is really beautiful!" Zhang Xiao muttered to himself. Past events of the old timeline flipped through his mind like an old movie. He touched his pocket with his hand, took out a ten-hole harmonica, moistened his lips, and a melody he knew by heart slowly sounded.

Zhao Hening had just finished brushing her teeth. Hearing the slightly sorrowful melody coming from outside, her curiosity was piqued. She quietly ran out of the camp tent, came outside the tent where Zhang Jiayu was, and shouted in a low voice, "Jiayu, Jiayu, accompany me to see."

Zhang Jiayu lifted the door curtain, somewhat surprised, asking, "Haven't slept so late? See what?"

"Shh... listen." Zhao Hening put her finger to her lips, signaling him to keep his voice down.

*Crack!* An abnormal sound came from behind.

"Who!" Zhang Xiao turned around alertly, one hand subconsciously touching the holster. Focusing his eyes, he relaxed and said, "You two kids, what are you doing sneaking around?"

It turned out that Zhao Hening, who followed the sound, accidentally stepped on and broke a dry branch on the ground. Zhao Hening was a bit embarrassed, walked over slowly, and said, "Teacher, people were attracted by a beautiful and slightly sad zither sound."

Zhang Jiayu thought Zhang Xiao would scold them for men and women touching, and accompanying each other out of camp at night being shameless. The result was Zhang Xiao saying, "Sleep early. We are not here for tourism; the tasks ahead are heavy."

"Teacher, this tune is really nice. Haven't heard you play it before. What's its name?" Zhao Hening asked.

"*Reminiscing Jade Tune* (*Ru Yi Yu Er Qu*)." Zhang Xiao couldn't do anything with her and answered indifferently.

"Jade (*Yu*)... Jade..." Zhao Hening paced back and forth, pretending to think, and suddenly stopped beside Zhang Jiayu, saying, "Could it be this—Jade (*Yu*)!" [Note: Zhang Jiayu's name has 'Yu' / Jade in it]

"Just fooling around!" Zhang Xiao pretended to be angry.

Zhang Jiayu said, "I hear this tune is melodious and lingering, full of deep affection, seemingly having the meaning of 'Twenty-four bridges on a moonlit night, where is the jade person teaching flute playing.' It must be that the Chief is reminded of some old friend."

Hearing Zhang Jiayu say this, Zhao Hening's gossip heart was instantly hooked. "Teacher, who is this old friend of yours?"

"This is not a question a child should ask."

"Oh, if you won't say, you won't say..." Zhao Hening was a bit depressed, but immediately said, "It's rare for Teacher to have such refined interest tonight. Why not play *Where the Stars Are* again? You taught us before. I'll sing!"

"Okay." Zhang Xiao agreed readily.

As the harmonica prelude sounded, Zhao Hening sang the lyrics to the beat: "*Kimi no kage, hoshi no you ni. Asa ni tokete, kieteiku...*"

Tonight's stars are a footnote to loneliness.
