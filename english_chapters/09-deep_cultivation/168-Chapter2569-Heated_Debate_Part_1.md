# Chapter 2569 - Heated Debate (Part 1)

Zhao Xunru let out a sigh. "Mengliang, your clan has received Ming stipends for generations and basked in imperial favor. Why degrade yourself to serve bandits?"

It was an impolite remark, though none present took offense. Liu Dalin had already declared his position—there was no need for their side to hide behind pretenses either.

Liu Dalin's expression remained unchanged. "Since the First Emperor unified the realm, the Western Han endured for 210 years, the Eastern Han for 196, the two Jin a mere 156, the great Tang only 290, and the Southern and Northern Song together 320. From Taizu's founding until now, the Great Ming has lasted exactly 270 years. The burdens have accumulated past the point of return. The dynasty totters in wind and rain. Within, peasant uprisings spring up everywhere. Without, the Tartars pound at the passes. Troops are added daily yet cannot repel the enemy. Taxes increase monthly yet cannot meet national needs. These are the signs of a dynasty's end." He paused to let the words settle. "In this chaotic age, the Senate rules Qiong and Yue with ambitions for all under heaven, seeking to rescue the people from fire and flood, spreading grace in every direction. Though I was a Ming minister, I was never minister to one family alone—I was minister to all under heaven. I am willing to speak for the common people. Though I sink to hell, I shall have no regrets."

Yao Dian stroked his white goatee, his voice slightly hoarse. "Even if you are full of learning, Mengliang, the Australians only gave you the title of Chief Consultative Councillor. Your orders never leave the Consultative Bureau—you aren't even equal to some yellow-haired child from fake-Kun. How can you accomplish great deeds to save the common people? Truly casting pearls before swine."

Liu Dalin laughed helplessly. "Full of learning? That's just us bragging about ourselves. Who knew there's always a higher sky, always greater people? When the Senate first arrived, I too saw them as nothing more than giant pirates from overseas, using profit to entice ruffians, imitating the Portuguese occupation of Macau." He shook his head at the memory. "Qiongya sits at the ends of the earth, the furthest reaches of our realm—culture not flourishing, products not abundant, bandits rampant. The county school's few mu of thin farmland couldn't even support a handful of students. Successive county magistrates, though aspiring to improve, found themselves trapped and helpless, ultimately accomplishing nothing. But after the Holy Ship descended? In just a few years, the bandits of Qiongzhou were swept away completely. The people prospered and taxes were sufficient. Moliaxuan rang with voices reciting lessons, and the remote backwater of Lingao became an earthly paradise. Such world-overturning achievements—what virtue or ability do I possess to claim even an inch of credit? It was all accomplished by the Chiefs leading a group of young people."

As he spoke, Liu Dalin unconsciously pulled a round metal object from his robe. He had developed the habit of checking the time while in Lingao. With a press of a button, the glass-inlaid metal lid flipped open to reveal moving hands—a mechanical self-winding pocket watch, only half a palm in size. Everyone was familiar with Western clocks and Australian clocks, but what they usually saw were enormous standing clocks. To compress such a device into so tiny a case—what divine craftsmanship! This item must certainly have been a gift from the true Australians. Their treatment of Liu Dalin was generous indeed.

Though they had all heard through various channels of the Australians' miracles in Lingao, hearing it from the mouth of a classmate and friend who had served the Baldies for many years struck these old fellows in their fifties and sixties with altogether different force.

"It seems Mengliang intends to be a lobbyist for the Australians," Chen Zilü observed.

Liu Dalin tucked the pocket watch back into his robe. "The word 'lobbyist' doesn't quite apply. It's simply that the people under heaven are suffering, and someone can do good things for them, so I wish to contribute a small effort. The people's peace and contentment—that is the great way of governance."

Zhao Xunru sighed with admiration. "Mengliang's heart is truly magnanimous—willing to serve as a supporting role for the people's welfare."

"What can these sick old bones of mine accomplish? This world belongs to the young." Liu Dalin waved his hand. "An Australian sage once said: 'The world is yours, and also ours, but in the final analysis, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and vitality, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Hope is placed on you.'"

He Wuzhou nodded. "Rough words but true reason. When Ouyang Xiu met Su Dongpo, he too said: 'Reading Su Shi's works, I cannot help but sweat with excitement. How exhilarating! This old man should step aside and let him lead the way.'"

"I've heard that Australian schools don't teach poetry and classics," Yao Dian said. "They prioritize literacy alone—merely elementary education. How can they accomplish what we scholars cannot?"

Before Liu Dalin could speak, Chen Zizhuang interjected. "Brother Shengjin has truly been away from worldly affairs for too long. The Australians came from Australia, calling themselves descendants of the Song who preceded us. Though dwelling in remote wilds, they haven't forgotten their roots and also have poetry, classics, and histories. Their system of learning begins with literacy, then arithmetic—this forms the foundation of Australian secret arts. When students grow older, they're taught specialized subjects called 'physics,' 'chemistry,' 'engineering,' and 'agricultural technology.' The classics of masters and histories become separate subjects, only briefly surveyed. After graduation, students become farmers, workers, or soldiers, each placed accordingly. Before being employed as cadres, they must receive instruction from true Australians—this is called 'training.' Only through such orderly systems and strict regulations can they be directed as easily as one's own arm."

Liu Dalin was somewhat surprised. He hadn't expected Chen Zizhuang's understanding of the Senate to run so deep. "Jisheng's words are quite accurate. The difference between our dynasty's official system and Ming's is that officials and clerks are unified. As the saying goes, 'fierce generals emerge from the ranks, high ministers rise from the counties.' All officials start as junior clerks. Since ancient times, imperial power hasn't extended below the county level. Floating officials govern a region for only a few years, while grassroots affairs fall entirely under local clerks' control. With no hope of advancement and no imperial salary, clerks exploit their positions for private gain, becoming local tyrants and bringing disaster to their districts. The Ming chaos owes something to the clerks as well. Once officials and clerks are unified and clerks can become officials, those with future prospects will naturally restrain themselves."

Chen Zizhuang remained unmoved by this reasoning. "In my view, the Australians' method of selecting talent contains nothing particularly brilliant. It's merely the National Academy's selection system—an established method our dynasty already possesses."

He glanced at Yao Dian and Zhao Xunru before continuing. "Brother Shengjin once served as Director of the Personnel Ministry's Document Selection Office, handling examinations and selections of civil officials by rank, listing, testing, screening, promotion, and transfer. Brother Housheng also came from the Personnel Ministry. You must know the evolution of our dynasty's official selection process."

Yao Dian nodded, stroking his beard. "Indeed, Jisheng's observation is astute. When our dynasty's Taizu founded the nation, he established the National Academy to gather talents from throughout the realm. Academy students were divided into official students, meritorious nobility, and commoner students. Official students and meritorious nobility were sons of imperial and high official families. Commoner students were metropolitan examination failures who entered the Academy, or tribute scholars sent up from local government schools. Student qualifications, residence requirements, daily schedules, and practical training systems—all had detailed regulations. The National Academy employed specialized instructors to manage and supervise students' studies and daily lives. Students needed special imperial permission for leave or withdrawal." He warmed to the subject. "The Academy was divided into six halls in three tiers. Beginning students who had mastered the Four Books but not the Classics resided in the Zhengyi, Chongzhi, and Guangye halls. After eighteen months of study, those whose writing was clear and fluent advanced to the Xiudao and Chengxin halls. Another eighteen months later, those who had thoroughly mastered the classics and histories with excellent composition advanced to Shuaixing Hall. Upon reaching Shuaixing, they accumulated points. The method worked thus: in the first month of each quarter, one essay on one's Classic was tested; in the second month, one discourse, plus one edict, proclamation, or memorial; in the third month, one essay on classics and history plus two legal judgments. For each test, those whose reasoning and composition both excelled received one point; those strong in reasoning but weak in composition received half a point; those with errors received none. Students accumulating eight points in a year graduated and received appointment. Those falling short continued studying in residence."

"Correct," Zhao Xunru continued. "Mathematics, astronomy, hydraulics, and other specialized subjects were all taught at the National Academy. I believe the practical training system was indeed a practical method. After completing their studies, Academy students were assigned to various government offices for hands-on experience in political affairs. After one or two years of practical training and satisfactory performance evaluations, they were sent to the Personnel Ministry to await appointment. This system was strictly enforced during the Hongwu and Yongle reigns and selected many talents for the court. After Xuande, as the imperial examinations flourished, the National Academy's selection system gradually fell into disuse. Yet officials in specialized positions—particularly low-ranking ones in the Ministry of Works and Ministry of Revenue—still must be Academy graduates handling practical affairs, precisely because jinshi officials are unfamiliar with technical matters."

"Knowing good methods exist yet failing to use them," Liu Dalin said. "This is the path to defeat."

Yao Dian shook his head. "Currently, Academy students' quality is notoriously low—this is common knowledge. Moreover, the Academy teaches so many specialized subjects that students cannot fully grasp Confucius's subtle teachings. How can they be appointed to high office?"

Liu Dalin smiled calmly. "Subtle teachings—can they be eaten? Can they repel enemies?"

"The current holy Son of Heaven is diligent and intelligent," Chen Zizhuang said. "He's merely been deceived by treacherous ministers. If he can steel his resolve and reform to become strong, the Great Ming still has hope for restoration." Clearly, having once received the gift of shad fish from the Chongzhen Emperor and nearly entered the Grand Secretariat, he still held high hopes for the throne.

"I fear this is wishful thinking, Jisheng," Liu Dalin replied. "The root cause of the National Academy's decline—was it in the Xuande or Chenghua reigns? No. It was planted in the twenty-sixth year of Hongwu, when Emperor Taizu established the evaluation method for educational officials, using examination pass rates rather than annual tributes to assess instructors. Thus, instructors were bound to send their best students to examinations to meet evaluation targets, and government school education pivoted toward examination preparation. During the Jingtai and Chenghua eras, the court was short of funds and opened a path of 'purchased enrollment'—Confucian scholars who contributed a set quota of grain and horses could enter the Academy. Purchased students only wanted to use the Academy as a stepping stone to officialdom. How could student quality be guaranteed? A short-sighted bad policy that lingered for two hundred years."

He continued, his voice taking on an edge. "By the twenty-ninth year of Hongwu, the six halls' students could no longer be distinguished by level. The advancement point system became mere formality, and students simply waited their turn for practical training. The practical training system Brother Housheng mentioned, without point-based evaluation, had long become a matter of seniority. Most Academy students were provincial or metropolitan examination failures. After years of going through the motions, wasting time, aging and exhausted—how could they outperform jinshi upon taking office? When evaluating officials for promotion, how could they surpass jinshi? The Academy's accumulated burdens became insurmountable. By the Jingtai era, Ma Sheng and other non-jinshi officials were expelled from the Hanlin Academy and assigned provincial posts in Yunnan and Fujian. From then on, custom dictated that non-jinshi couldn't enter the Hanlin, non-Hanlin couldn't enter the Grand Secretariat, and high positions in the Northern and Southern ministries and court agencies required jinshi qualifications." He swept his gaze across the room. "All of you are jinshi. Tell me—are you willing to let Academy students enter the Hanlin alongside you?"

When push came to shove, buttocks determined brains. No one stood up to say "I'm willing" with a straight face.

Seeing the atmosphere turn uncomfortable, He Wuzhou smoothed things over with a laugh. "I thought we were all half in the grave, but it seems our blood still runs hot like young men's. Apparently we're all hale and hearty in old age." He grinned. "Since we still have fire in our bellies, why don't we have Mengliang tell us about the Australian military system? Our knowledge is limited to rumors. Anyone claiming to truly understand Australian affairs can't match Mengliang."
