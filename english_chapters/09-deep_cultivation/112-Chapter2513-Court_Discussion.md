# Chapter 2513: Court Discussion

Yang Cao asked, "Should we close the net within the city?"

"Not yet," Wu Mu replied. "The bandit gangs are too mobile. After we failed to catch Xu Tong, Iron Beam Temple emptied out overnight—they've long since fled the mountain. Our people inside the city are now isolated, cut off from any contact with our forces outside. The enemy lurks in shadow while we stand exposed; our intelligence sources have grown dangerously thin. We need to expand them however we can. Leaving this bait in place might yet catch fish—sooner or later, they'll reach out to Liang Cunhou. Besides, if we strike the Liang family, shouldn't we strike the others too? Once we've eliminated the lackeys outside the city walls, those inside become nothing more than fish on a cutting board. If the feast can be made richer, I don't mind postponing dinner."

The Capital. The Forbidden City.

The Palace of Heavenly Purity was the largest hall in the Inner Court, nine bays wide and five bays deep. Gray-white light filtered through the latticed windows behind the throne, casting dappled shadows across the floor. A purple copper incense burner on the throne platform sent up curling wisps of smoke, shrouding everything in a haze of twilight mist.

Chongzhen hesitated, then picked up a memorial from the imperial desk before him. Xiong Wencan's report had sat in the Document Room for some time now. The fall of Guangdong had left him stunned. The Kun thieves—or Australians, as they called themselves—had been nothing but mellow wine in a glazed bottle on his desk yesterday. Now they had become a problem demanding the Empire's attention.

The fragrant tea on the imperial desk had long gone cold. The tip of his vermilion brush had dried out. Chongzhen rose suddenly from the throne and stood with his back to the gold-lacquered screen, silent for a long moment. Then, with a sharp *snap*, he hurled the memorial onto the steps below. It unfurled in the air like a fluttering butterfly, drifted briefly, and settled weakly onto the gold bricks before the hall.

Chongzhen paced rapidly in front of the imperial desk, his movements quick and agitated. Then he shouted: "Xiong Wencan has failed the nation! Powerless against the Eastern Barbarians! Useless at pacifying roving bandits! Now he cannot even resist sea pirates! Since We ascended the throne, We have striven to invigorate all things—drawing near to gentlemen, expelling petty men, abolishing the guarding eunuchs, employing the Donglin faction. We placed Our heart and soul in them, entrusted them as Our shield and wall. Yet when these men entered the court, all they knew was to argue over doctrinal differences, fight for power, form cliques, and pursue private interests. And what has this brought Us? Defeated armies and empty coffers. The Eastern Barbarians pressing against the Capital walls, confronting Us across a single barrier! Now Guangdong is lost as well. Who caused this? We have never failed to trust and employ Our civil and military officials—but who among them has truly exerted themselves wholeheartedly? Xiong Wencan spoke bold and inflammatory words beforehand, then tried to shift blame and gloss over his failures afterward. Unable to pacify, unable to win in battle. We tolerated him again and again, hoping he would redeem his crimes by recovering lost territory. Instead, things only grew worse—failure upon failure, grace betrayed and duty neglected. And now he has the audacity to come begging for troops. Xiong Wencan is incompetent! The officials of Guangdong deserve execution!"

When he finished, an unnatural flush had spread across Chongzhen's pale face. His heavy breathing echoed through the hall. But the vast chamber remained empty, and no one answered his questioning.

Wang Chengen descended the steps soundlessly. He knelt and bowed, whispering, "Your Majesty's person is bound to the fate of the state. Ten thousand hopes that you protect the Sacred Body."

Chongzhen sank back onto the throne, somewhat deflated, his breathing gradually slowing. He waved his hand lightly. "State affairs are endless and tangled. Since the beginning of the year, Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng overcame Xingyang and besieged Zhongdu at Fengyang, forcing Us to bear guilt before the spirits of Heaven, Earth, and Our Ancestors. Now Guangdong is lost as well. Fire on all four sides, wind leaking through every crack. We have seen enough of these calamities that never cease from dawn to dusk. After so long, We needed to let out some complaints. These words are only spoken to you, Our intimate servant. It is nothing." He paused, then added, "Summon the Grand Secretariat for audience."

His gaze drifted to the window, eyes tired and unfocused, as though speaking more to himself than to Wang Chengen.

Silence filled the Palace of Heavenly Purity. The Grand Secretaries stood with eyes lowered to their chests. Everyone had already seen Xiong Wencan's memorial, yet everyone seemed to be ignoring it—deliberately, perhaps. There were already troubles enough. But however unwilling they might be, reality would have to be faced.

Chongzhen spoke: "The Kun thieves invaded by sea. Guangdong has been lost for many days now. Previously, Xiong Wencan's memorials were all given to the Grand Secretariat for drafting comments and forwarded to the Ministry for reconsideration. Now Xiong has sent another letter pleading for help. Have the ministers discussed a countermeasure?" He turned his gaze. "Minister Wen, since you are Senior Grand Secretary, you speak first."

Wen Tiren stepped forward calmly and bowed. To him, all of this was already familiar. Reality struck this young monarch's fragile self-esteem blow after blow. The uncompromising nature of his youth made him appear impatient and overwhelmed when facing the complex political landscape. His experience as a minor prince had not prepared him for the throne. Faced with the crumbling edifice that was Great Ming, few truly sought to prop it up. Most would only scoop away a handful of mud or pull out a fistful of thatch while it swayed in chaos, letting it lean ever more precariously in the wind and rain.

The young emperor no longer trusted scholars out of office, nor did he direct those ministers who served him. No one could give him a sense of security. His renewed trust in the eunuch factory officials was an unfriendly weather vane for court officials. For Wen Tiren, however, it might not be bad news. An isolated monarch and an isolated minister must rely upon one another. Isolated minister or dictator? It hardly mattered. Power was the true summit.

"Your Majesty," Wen Tiren said, his voice carrying through the hall, "regarding the Kun thieves, the Grand Secretariat and Ministry of War have held many meetings. However, the Kun thieves are visitors from overseas, located in the remote reaches of Qiongzhou. Very little is known about their circumstances. Examining Xiong Wencan's reports, although the Kun people falsely claim to be remnants of the former Song dynasty, they all have short hair and wear coarse clothing. Observing their dress, etiquette, calendar, manufacturing, and firearms, they closely resemble the overseas Red Barbarians. Their people mostly speak with Northern accents—they should be sea bandits who wandered in foreign lands adjacent to the Red Barbarians, certainly not proper descendants of our China."

He continued: "They occupied Lingao and engaged in smuggling and private trade with Guangzhou Prefecture for several years. Only now have they begun to cause trouble and plunder. Though fierce and arrogant, it is clear the Kun thieves harbor no great ambitions. Otherwise, since their weapons and armor are so formidable, why would they imprison themselves in Lingao for so long? Xiong Wencan claims that the fall of Guangzhou Prefecture was actually due to the Kun thieves exploiting opportunity—inciting traitors, gathering malcontents, and planting hidden spies over several years before finally tricking the city into falling."

Wen Tiren paused briefly. "Examining their methods of combat over time, they are clearly skilled at naval warfare. The defeat at Qiongzhou came from being struck while our forces were crossing halfway. Our dynasty lost all its boats and ships, leaving tens of thousands of troops stranded in the desperate land of Qiongya without reinforcement or provisions—thus resulting in that defeat. In their attack on Guangdong, they first destroyed our naval forces, then relied on ship cannons to bombard the shore before taking Humen. At Lingyang Gorge and Zhaoqing, it was the same: the naval fleet as vanguard, foot soldiers following behind. Only then were they able to..."

Chongzhen listened with lowered head, his attention focused. When Wen Tiren finished, he said: "Fighting a war requires nothing more than soldiers and horses, money and grain, materials. What you have described—where will the pay come from?"

Wen Tiren considered briefly. "The ministers conferred. Currently there is no place to obtain money. We can only add levies again—we propose an increase for Guangdong Supplies. These would be divided into two items. The first is equal transport: assigning grain by the *mu*. For every *mu* of field, levy an additional six *ge* of rice for Guangdong Supplies. Calculating one *shi* of rice at eight *qian* of silver, approximately 1.8 million taels can be raised. The second concerns excess land. Since the Wanli reign's land survey, registry records have been unclear, leaving many fields uncounted in collection. Now that state affairs are difficult, after verifying these lands clearly, we can levy them uniformly. This should produce several hundred thousand taels more. Combined, the two items should levy at least 2.1 million additional taels. The levy period would be one year; when the Kun disaster is pacified, the Guangdong Supplies cease. Salt tax silver and student exemption silver can also be slightly increased. This should be enough."

Chongzhen sighed. "In the third year of Chongzhen, we already added new supplies. Such continuous adding of levies—the people's strength cannot catch even a moment's breath. This is the policy of draining the pond to catch fish."

Wen Tiren was silent for a moment. "Your Majesty's sympathy for the people is admirable. But military intelligence is urgent as wind and fire; it cannot be delayed for a moment. Lu Xiangsheng, Hong Chengchou, and the other Governor-Generals fight across a thousand *li*, urging desperately for food and pay. Now, at the critical moment of breaking enemy fronts and pulling down their banners, we still need soldiers to press forward. We cannot fall short of success at the final step. Only when the realm is pacified can we take turns exempting grain taxes and give the people rest."

He paused, then continued: "The Kun disaster is a minor matter. Currently, roving bandits rage across several provinces—that is the affliction closest to the heart. Your Majesty should still take it as the main focus."

Chongzhen asked, "How should Xiong Wencan be dealt with?"

"Allow him to bear guilt and be demoted while temporarily remaining in his post," Wen Tiren replied. "Although Xiong Wencan lost his forces and lost territory, there is currently no one else who understands Kun affairs and knows the Kun situation. Changing commanders before battle—we fear the army's morale will waver. Without knowing the details, we may lose what ground has been gained. Xiong has blunted the enemy's spearhead repeatedly. Though defeated again and again, he continues to fight, willing to risk arrows and stones, charging ahead bravely. Now he hopes to reinvigorate our efforts, contacting loyal and brave men in Guangdong. Soon he will raise the bamboo pole for uprising. In his memorial, he requested authority to act as circumstances dictate, and permission to praise and reward those who show loyalty and righteousness. The ministers discussed and felt we can allow what he requests."

Hearing this, Chongzhen nodded slightly and exhaled. "Allowed. Who can serve as Governor-General for the campaign against the Kun?"

"Hong Chengchou, Lu Xiangsheng, and others are all capable commanders," Wen Tiren said, "but the suppression of roving bandits requires them without pause. This decision must be left to the Sacred Heart to decide alone."

Chongzhen said, "Later, you and I shall discuss together as monarch and minister."
