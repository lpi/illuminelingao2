# Chapter 2413: Reeling Workshop (II)

The so-called Cold Basin Method didn't mean reeling silk in cold water. Rather, the former one-pot-for-all process of cooking cocoons and reeling silk was changed into two separate procedures. The specific process was to prepare two basins. One was a hot basin for cooking cocoons, placed on the stove and directly heated with firewood, used to cook the silkworm cocoons. Unlike the cooking basin in the Fire Silk Method, this basin should be small, cooking small amounts of cocoons multiple times with a small pot. This could cook them thoroughly and evenly, avoiding uneven cooking from putting in too many cocoons.

Although called "cold," the water temperature in the basin was actually also very high, just slightly lower than the hot basin. The cooked cocoons were transferred to the cold basin for reeling.

Cold Basin silk was of much better quality than Fire Silk. The ancients said: "Bright and lustrous, tough and colored." It was a top product among raw silk. The Huzhou silk that Chen Lin admired so much was also mostly reeled using this method.

Fenshenghe had always used the Fire Silk Method for reeling. It wasn't that Chen Lin and his father didn't know about the Cold Basin Method, but adopting the Cold Basin Method had considerable technical difficulty.

Although the Cold Basin Method was good, the technical essentials were more complex than Fire Silk. The difficulty lay in how to heat and insulate the cold basin. The cold basin couldn't be directly heated with firewood, yet the temperature uniformity had to be ensured during reeling. Usually it shared a stove with the hot basin for cooking cocoons, using the residual heat from heating the hot basin for warming. The outside also had to be plastered with yellow mud for insulation. Whether for the fire tender or the reeler, both had to be very experienced in temperature control.

Chen Lin couldn't understand those pipes and valves, but he could understand that one workstation had two basins. As soon as the Australians came, they directly changed it to the Cold Basin Method!

"Chief, is this the Cold Basin Method?"

"Correct, you know?" Li Yao'er nodded approvingly.

"Know. My late father also thought about using the Cold Basin Method, only..." Chen Lin's father had suffered from introducing silkworm seeds in his early years and was hesitant about improving the reeling. Besides, introducing the Cold Basin Method required adding equipment and increasing manpower—all expenses.

"Introducing new technologies and varieties requires taking risks. Your father's hesitation was normal," Li Yao'er said. "However, the Cold Basin Method is already very outdated technology for us..."

Chen Lin thought to himself this woman spoke with such big airs! Li Yao'er was completely unaware and said with great interest: "In our Australian silk factories, cocoon cooking uses a dedicated large pot that can cook tens of thousands of cocoons at once. It can cook them thoroughly without overcooking, and every cocoon is cooked evenly. After cooking, reeling is done in a centralized manner, no need to beat basins while reeling like this. Speaking of this silk car, Fenshenghe's old car can only reel one end. The new car we retrofitted this time can only reel three ends. But in the best silk factories in Australia, one silk car can reel 400 ends. With so many silk ends, only three skilled workers are needed to watch over them..."

Li Yao'er spoke with shining eyes, but Chen Lin was full of suspicion. *The bragging about Australia isn't done this way, is it?* One person reeling over one hundred ends—what kind of person could manage that! Besides, a car driving 400 ends, even with supernatural strength couldn't pull it. From his experience, one reeling worker doing foot-pedal reeling, three ends was the maximum.

Seeing the Chief speaking happily, Chen Lin dared not interrupt. It was only when Li Yao'er's words briefly paused that he quickly interjected: "Chief, what are these iron pipes for?"

"These are all pipelines for transporting hot water."

Li Yao'er explained a few sentences, and Chen Lin immediately understood: the biggest improvement of this reeling workshop's so-called "Jiqi Dajie" was not the reeling car or the basin-beating mode. In essence, it was just an improved version of the Cold Basin Method. But compared to the past's laborious, smoky one-stove-two-basin style basin-beating method, hot water was now all supplied by one big furnace, eliminating the stove. The reeling that could previously only be done one household one car could now be centralized, and water from one furnace had uniform heat, no longer requiring a dedicated person to tend the fire and control temperature.

In the past, their own reeling room had ten stoves running ten cars simultaneously, and everyone thought it was quite impressive. In comparison, the Australians had set up one hundred cars in one go! Looking at this setup, all the cocoons in Xiangshan could be reeled here without problem. Was this scale spread too widely? Where would so many cocoons come from for her to reel? Besides, where would the workers come from?

Naturally, his sycophantic Second Uncle would certainly act like a fox exploiting the tiger's might, using the Australians' name to force villagers to sell their cocoons to Fenshenghe, and would probably force villagers to work in the factory. The various drawbacks were self-evident. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but break out in cold sweat on his forehead.

Li Yao'er saw his face suddenly change and felt strange, asking: "What's wrong with you?"

"Mm-mm, nothing..." Chen Lin quickly covered up, "I'm just worried there won't be that many cocoons to collect when the time comes."

"As for that, I'm preparing to raise silkworms myself as soon as spring begins," Li Yao'er said. "I've also prepared the place for raising silkworms. Raise some myself, purchase some more. Your Second Uncle said Nansha Village will fully help Fenshenghe. Every family's cocoons will all be sold to the factory, the women will also come help raise silkworms and pick mulberry leaves, and the mulberry leaves from each family in the village will prioritize Fenshenghe's use..."

Chen Lin secretly cried bitter in his heart, thinking *Second Uncle, you won't stop until you ruin Fenshenghe's reputation, will you!* If this keeps up, can our branch still gain a foothold in the village in the future?

"...However, I don't agree with his approach. We are running a factory doing business, not government officials dispatching corvée. We can't rely on orders to make people do things. Don't you think so?"

"Yes, yes, the Chief is wise!" Chen Lin nodded repeatedly.

"So my idea is to adopt cooperatives. This method we have used for a long time in Hainan. Everyone pools shares to raise silkworms."

The cooperative model was an important production-management model promoted by the Senate in rural areas. From the earliest Ma Niao Salt Field Cooperative to the later Leizhou Sugar Industry Joint Operation, under Senate rule, the Heaven and Earth Society supported a large number of similar institutions. They were especially common in the production and processing of cash crops and could be said to be a quite mature model.

"I've also talked with your Second Uncle. Roughly, we establish a joint-stock company..."

Li Yao'er briefly introduced the specific cooperation plan. The plan was not complicated—nothing more than whoever had money contributing money, whoever had strength contributing strength. Each received shares. After selling raw silk, participants received dividends according to their shareholding proportion.

"...This method we have used in many places, and everyone's response has been good. I think it should also be promoted very smoothly in Nansha. Especially since we also have the strong support of you and your Second Uncle."

When Li Yao'er said this, she watched Chen Lin very earnestly. The young man's face involuntarily turned red.

"This small one will definitely serve. Whether there are dividends or not, actually this small one doesn't care too much. As long as clansmen can be fed and clothed, and Nansha recovers its vitality..."

This was not Chen Lin putting on airs but sincere words from his heart.

"Hehe, what you said is quite serious and proper." Li Yao'er suddenly laughed, her smile like a flower, as if she were a young girl. Chen Lin's mind couldn't help but stir. He quickly restrained himself, lowered his gaze and explained:

"This small one speaks from the heart."

"Whether heartfelt or not, I don't care either," Li Yao'er smiled. "It's good that you have this attitude!" She sighed: "Since ancient times, the hardest thing has been doing things. If you can wholeheartedly help me do this enterprise well, dividends and such indeed don't need to be worried about."

Coming out of the reeling workshop, Li Yao'er took him to the west side courtyard to visit the "Thread Weaving Workshop" renovated here.

Fabric was formed by vertically arranged warp threads and horizontally arranged weft threads interwoven together. The silk reeled couldn't be directly used as warp and weft threads. It needed to go through a series of preparatory processes to be woven into warp and weft threads before going on the loom for weaving.

The warp and weft threads needed for weaving silk fabrics roughly had to go through multiple processes like silk turning, silk doubling, silk twisting, silk starching, warping, winding quills, and so on before they could be made. Here, Li Yao'er hadn't introduced any new technologies or new equipment—there was no suitable power machine. So the various pieces of equipment inside looked finely made but were essentially no different from the improved foot-pedal reeling machines. Chen Lin took one look and roughly understood where the improvements were. Some improvements he had thought of in the past and had even drawn drawings for blacksmiths and carpenters to try making. The result was either they couldn't make it, or they made it and it looked identical, but after installing it, it couldn't operate as he envisioned—either sluggish and hard to move, or after running not long it cracked and broke.

The Australians were indeed ingenious without equal! Chen Lin thought. But for Chen Lin, these "seemingly similar" things in front of him were not simply about "ingenuity." That connecting axle arm, the same thing, the Australians could make it both fine and tough, but when he found the best blacksmith to make it, it could only be made coarse and clumsy... why exactly was that?

Just looking at those wooden components, one could also see the huge gap between what the Australians made and what local carpenters made. The same thing, the components made by Australians were much smaller and more delicate, and even the surface looked more pleasing to the eye than local objects.

"The same object, what the Australians make is just different," Chen Lin said sincerely. "This small one truly admires it!"

"This is nothing," Li Yao'er was used to the "shock" of natives and didn't take it to heart anymore. But Chen Lin was different from ordinary natives and had quite some insight. "If you went to Lingao and saw all kinds of new equipment made by our machinery factory, wouldn't you prostrate yourself in admiration?"

"It's just a pity this small one doesn't have such fortune," Chen Lin sighed.

"What's difficult about going to Lingao? Since you came from Guangzhou, you naturally know there are scheduled boats from Guangzhou to Lingao. Although the ticket isn't cheap, it probably isn't a problem given your status."

"The Chief jests," Chen Lin said. "It's not that this small one doesn't want to go. It's really that this mess before my eyes cannot be left unattended..." Fearing Li Yao'er would misunderstand, he quickly added, "Although Fenshenghe is now in good order, the entire Nansha Village is still dilapidated. The livelihoods of clansmen and villagers after spring also need to be planned..."

"Are the villagers' lives very difficult?" Although Li Yao'er had been in Nansha for several months, she had been busy renovating the factory and interacted with locals mostly through Chen Xuan. She knew very little about the local situation in Nansha.
