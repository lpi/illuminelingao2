# Chapter 2484: Stripping the Cocoon (Part 3)

Xu Tong paused for a breath, then continued: "Any group of people has leftists, centrists, and rightists, and the attitude of the forces within Guangzhou city towards us is also divided into three types: those actively moving closer, those ambiguous with unclear positions, and those implicitly hostile and non-cooperative. However, under the powerful deterrence of the Fubo Army, there have been no direct confrontations or raising flags to rebel yet." A low ripple of laughter came from the conference room.

Xu Tong also smiled slightly and continued: "Currently, it seems most gentry belong to the latter two types. On fundamental issues, we have irreconcilable conflicts of interest with them. In order not to touch the nerves of Guangzhou landlords and prevent them from overreacting, we are currently handling land policies vaguely—that is, basically continuing the land ownership rights of the Ming State without making major changes. The purpose is to guide their capital and personnel towards industrial and commercial development. This process is very slow. So for now, their attitude remains skeptical neutrality.

"Skeptical neutrality certainly doesn't matter. The problem is that our rule over the grassroots level is currently very weak. A vast amount of basic work has to be implemented through local gentry and clan elders. Although most of these people outwardly obey us, actual power is also in the hands of this group. Militia organizations and local National Army units are also partially manipulated by them in disguise.

"Guangdong and Guangxi have always been among the regions where clan power is strongest. Often an entire village shares one surname, and family members of various villages and counties are unusually united. This strengthens the voice of gentry clans in local administration. At this stage, the new land policy is still in the discussion phase and has not been formally introduced, but obviously, this state cannot last forever. Guangzhou gentry have large amounts of private land in surrounding areas; they are very sensitive to this issue, as it concerns the fundamental interests of each family. This is also the biggest hidden danger in our current grassroots governance."

He spoke very fluently; this was also meticulously prepared to fully reflect his level of "controlling the overall situation" and strategic vision.

He scanned the crowd in the conference room, paused, and continued: "Due to the close commercial trade exchanges between Guangzhou and Lingao, a large amount of relevant information from Lingao has entered Guangdong with traveling merchants, including information on land surveys and land tax systems. At the same time, there is no corresponding position for old forces in the power structure of the Great Song regime. The loss of power and the uncertainty of damaged interests fill them with unease and anxiety. The result of not sharing the world with the gentry is obviously something they do not want to see. And in order to balance wealth, our current taxes are basically 'earn more, collect more; earn less, collect less,' and high-income earners also have to bear greater social responsibilities. This inevitably leaves these old forces—who under the usurper Ming were basically tax-free, exempt from corvée labor, and enjoyed privileges—with the impression that exorbitant taxes and levies are as numerous as ox hairs, and that scholars are treated harshly as enemies. This is especially true for the many gentry possessing usurper Ming academic degrees. In this sense, so-called non-support is actually a form of disguised passive opposition."

Yang Cao made a gesture to Xu Tong, signaling him to pause. Immediately, the focus of everyone's eyes in the venue shifted to her. This made Xu Tong somewhat unhappy.

Yang Cao scanned the venue on her own and slowly said: "Since entering Guangzhou, we have never struck against renowned local gentry clans. This has given them the illusion that their current peace and partially retained privileges are due to their own power and reputation. They feel they have room to bargain with the government, playing games of complying in public but opposing in private regarding the implementation of many policies, while breeding crafty thoughts they shouldn't have. The Witchcraft Case and the Tax Rectification Case gave them a reminder and deterred some people, but it also gave some people a 'sense of crisis' and moved thoughts they shouldn't move."

She paused for a moment, seemingly to give everyone enough time to digest the meaning.

"The recent gradual increase in anti-Senate remarks and petty actions around and inside Guangzhou represents the expansion of this trend. This indicates that we have been somewhat too tolerant towards Guangzhou gentry in the past. They haven't truly realized the power of the Senate. They do not understand gratitude for the preferential treatment obtained without paying a sufficient price. Therefore, in the future, we will take joint action with the Guangzhou Municipal Government, the Army, the National Army, the Police Bureau, the Finance and Taxation Bureau Investigation Section, and other units to seize some typical cases and strike a blow against some stubborn, distinct, and typical anti-Song gentry. This will give a huge shock to the anti-Song forces and potential hostile elements inside and around the city. Through this action, we will also strive to win over those wavering centrist old forces. We are not trying to overthrow everyone, nor is it possible to overthrow everyone. What we want to do is use facts to oppress them, shove them, and beat them, forcing them to wake up, helping them recognize the general trend, and letting them see the correct direction. As long as they ultimately agree with our ideals and support our cause, even if they have made mistakes and taken detours, as long as they ultimately stand under the same banner with us, we will accept them as our fellow travelers with an open mind. At the same time, we cannot relax our vigilance in the slightest and must guard against those wavering people with weak wills. The achievement of our cause has never relied on retreat and compromise. If there is a stone blocking our path forward, we kick it away. If it refuses to be kicked away, we smash it. This action is of great importance. Director Wu and Director Zhao will come to Guangzhou personally to direct it when the time comes. The road ahead is full of difficulties; I will encourage myself along with you gentlemen."

After speaking, Yang Cao waved her hand gently, signaling Xu Tong to continue the meeting. Seeing everyone withdraw their gazes, Xu Tong walked back to the blackboard in front of the conference room, picked up the bamboo pointer, and began to explain loudly.

According to the situation compiled by the Bureau of Political Security from various aspects, the Liang family's shadow loomed vaguely behind many major cases. However, currently, no effective evidence for accusation had been collected. This was the most frustrating thing for every powerful department.

Words from outside didn't enter; words from inside didn't exit. In terms of secrecy, the Liang family achieved a near-perfect degree. Not even a slip of paper or a sentence could be transmitted out. In terms of posture, they were surprisingly soft. No matter how intentionally provoked, the Liang family just wouldn't get angry or lose their temper. They strictly "handled matters according to regulations"—speaking of which, they were now more familiar with the Senate's various laws, orders, and news vocabulary than many naturalized citizen cadres. Some naturalized citizen cadres who didn't grasp regulations firmly would instead be refuted by them. Sometimes, because naturalized citizen cadres weren't calm enough and did something excessive, they would even complain directly to the bureau. It could be called reasonable and restrained, neither humble nor overbearing. This made the Senators of several departments somewhat embarrassed.

As a result, departments couldn't truly find fault arbitrarily. After all, the big households in Guangzhou city were watching. The Senate stressed "ruling the country according to law" the most. If they really fabricated charges and forcibly ruined the Liang family, the big households would inevitably feel chilled. It would also ruin the Senate's consistent reputation.

The counterfeit currency case, which had recently shown signs of gradual spreading, attracted the attention of various powerful departments. Counterfeit currency was not only increasing in quantity in the market but also continuously improving in quality.

Although there was no evidence to implicate the Liang family, various departments coincidentally turned their eyes to the Liang family.

Xu Tong briefed on the current situation of the counterfeit currency case.
"Currently, the counterfeit currency situation summarized by various departments is as follows: Counterfeit currency has now appeared for all hard coins and all large-denomination banknotes issued by the Central Reserve Bank. Some small-denomination notes have also appeared sporadically. In terms of quality, there has also been a significant improvement. We can feel that they are constantly improving. From these improvements, we can see that there should be only one counterfeit currency gang. They produce well-organized work with a clear division of labor, and some highly skilled craftsmen are presiding over the technical work among them."

Everyone listened carefully.

"There is one characteristic that comrades from the Bank and the Finance and Taxation Bureau reminded us of. That is, judging from the collected counterfeit currency, the counterfeiters have taken great pains with the fake money, employing amazing manpower and material resources. Judging from the quantity of counterfeit currency we have discovered so far and the estimated quantity circulating in the market, their counterfeiting is very uneconomical, or even loss-making. So it cannot be purely for profit; it is more likely to carry some political intent. Director Mu believes this case should be investigated as a political case, and I think this is completely appropriate."

Yang Cao interjected: "Note, I personally believe that this matter is probably not as simple as just the Liang family participating. It is likely a grand assembly of various anti-Senate forces inside and outside Guangzhou city. And they very likely received the support of that so-called 'Shi Weng'—he is the real mastermind behind the scenes!"

Xu Tong continued: "Another thing we worry about is that since they invested so hugely in counterfeit currency, which seems to imply the losses outweigh the gains, does it also contain other undiscovered important actions?"

The heavy solid wood door of the conference room was tightly closed. Xu Tong's words echoed in the room.

"Currently, the behavioral characteristics of various anti-Song forces are mainly..."

"The targeted strike objects we have preliminarily determined are the following families."

"The preliminary action plan is..."

"Everyone, please express your respective opinions..."

The long four-hour meeting ended. The attendees left in twos and threes. The swirling smoke in the conference room with its open door gradually dispersed, leaving only ash trays full of cigarette butts on the table.

Yang Cao stretched hard, struck a match to light a lady's "Holy Ship" cigarette, and took a deep drag. The cool mint aroma caused a slight numbness in her lungs. She leaned back comfortably in the rattan chair, closed her eyes, and enjoyed the rare moment of quiet.

Outside the window, dark black clouds occupied the entire sky, shrouding Guangzhou in shadow. Faint thunder came from the sky, and traces of dancing lightning appeared indistinctly in the heavy cloud layers. Suddenly, a fierce gust of wind passed through the hall, blowing the conference room curtains high, dancing and fluttering. Yang Cao slowly opened her eyes, gazed at the world outside, and whispered: "It's going to rain."

Guangzhou remained noisy, while the sword-wielding Valkyrie was slowly ascending the execution platform.
