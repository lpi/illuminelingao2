# Chapter 2484: Stripping the Cocoon (Part 3)

Xu Tong paused for breath, then continued: "Any group contains leftists, centrists, and rightists. The forces within Guangzhou city are similarly divided: those actively moving closer to us, those whose positions remain ambiguous, and those who are implicitly hostile and non-cooperative. However, under the powerful deterrence of the Fubo Army, there have been no direct confrontations or open rebellions yet." A low ripple of laughter passed through the conference room.

Xu Tong smiled slightly and went on: "Currently, most gentry appear to belong to the latter two categories. On fundamental issues, we have irreconcilable conflicts of interest with them. To avoid alarming Guangzhou's landlords and provoking an overreaction, we are currently handling land policies vaguely—essentially continuing the land ownership rights from the Ming State without major changes. The purpose is to guide their capital and personnel toward industrial and commercial development. This process is very slow, so for now, their attitude remains one of skeptical neutrality.

"Skeptical neutrality wouldn't matter by itself. The problem is that our grassroots rule remains weak. A vast amount of basic work must be implemented through local gentry and clan elders. Though most outwardly obey us, actual power remains in their hands. Militia organizations and local National Army units are also partially manipulated by them in disguise.

"Guangdong and Guangxi have always been among the regions where clan power is strongest. Often an entire village shares one surname, and family members across various villages and counties are unusually united. This strengthens the voice of gentry clans in local administration. At this stage, the new land policy is still being discussed and has not been formally introduced—but obviously, this state cannot last forever. Guangzhou gentry hold large amounts of private land in surrounding areas and are extremely sensitive to this issue, as it concerns each family's fundamental interests. This is also the biggest hidden danger in our current grassroots governance."

He spoke fluently—this had been meticulously prepared to fully demonstrate his ability to "control the overall situation" and his strategic vision.

He scanned the room, paused, and continued: "Due to the close commercial exchanges between Guangzhou and Lingao, a large amount of information from Lingao has entered Guangdong with traveling merchants—including information on land surveys and tax systems. At the same time, there is no corresponding position for old forces in the power structure of the Great Song regime. The loss of power and uncertainty about their interests fills them with unease and anxiety. The result of not sharing the world with the gentry is obviously something they do not want to see. And to balance wealth, our current taxes are essentially 'earn more, pay more; earn less, pay less'—high-income earners must also bear greater social responsibilities. This inevitably leaves these old forces—who under the usurper Ming were basically tax-free, exempt from corvée labor, and enjoyed privileges—with the impression that exorbitant taxes and levies are as numerous as ox hairs, and that scholars are treated harshly as enemies. This is especially true for gentry possessing Ming-era academic degrees. In this sense, so-called non-support is actually a form of disguised passive opposition."

Yang Cao gestured for Xu Tong to pause. Immediately, everyone's focus shifted to her. This made Xu Tong somewhat annoyed.

Yang Cao surveyed the room and spoke slowly: "Since entering Guangzhou, we have never struck against the renowned local gentry clans. This has given them the illusion that their current peace and partially retained privileges stem from their own power and reputation. They feel they have room to bargain with the government, playing games of public compliance and private opposition regarding policy implementation, while breeding thoughts they shouldn't have. The Witchcraft Case and the Tax Rectification Case served as reminders and deterred some people—but it also gave others a 'sense of crisis' and stirred thoughts they shouldn't entertain."

She paused, seemingly giving everyone time to digest her meaning.

"The recent gradual increase in anti-Senate remarks and petty actions around and inside Guangzhou represents this expanding trend. It indicates we have been somewhat too tolerant toward Guangzhou gentry. They haven't truly realized the Senate's power. They do not understand gratitude for preferential treatment obtained without paying a sufficient price. Therefore, we will take joint action in the future with the Guangzhou Municipal Government, the Army, the National Army, the Police Bureau, the Finance and Taxation Bureau Investigation Section, and other units to seize some typical cases and strike a blow against stubborn, prominent, and typical anti-Song gentry. This will deliver a massive shock to anti-Song forces and potential hostile elements inside and around the city. Through this action, we will also strive to win over those wavering centrist old forces. We are not trying to overthrow everyone—nor is it possible. What we want to do is use facts to pressure them, shove them, and beat them, forcing them to wake up, helping them recognize the general trend, and letting them see the correct direction. As long as they ultimately agree with our ideals and support our cause—even if they have made mistakes and taken detours—as long as they ultimately stand under the same banner with us, we will accept them as fellow travelers with open minds. At the same time, we cannot relax our vigilance in the slightest and must guard against wavering people with weak wills. The achievement of our cause has never relied on retreat and compromise. If there is a stone blocking our path forward, we kick it away. If it refuses to budge, we smash it. This action is of great importance. Director Wu and Director Zhao will come to Guangzhou personally to direct it. The road ahead is full of difficulties; let us encourage ourselves along with you all."

After speaking, Yang Cao waved her hand gently, signaling Xu Tong to continue. As everyone's gazes withdrew, Xu Tong walked back to the blackboard, picked up the bamboo pointer, and began explaining loudly.

According to intelligence compiled by the Bureau of Political Security, the Liang family's shadow loomed vaguely behind many major cases. However, no effective evidence for accusation had been collected. This was the most frustrating thing for every powerful department.

No words entered from outside; none exited from within. In terms of secrecy, the Liang family had achieved near-perfection. Not even a slip of paper or a sentence could be transmitted out. In terms of posture, they were surprisingly soft. No matter how deliberately provoked, the Liang family simply would not get angry or lose their temper. They strictly "handled matters according to regulations"—they were now more familiar with the Senate's various laws, orders, and news vocabulary than many naturalized citizen cadres. Some cadres who didn't grasp regulations firmly found themselves refuted by the Liangs instead. Sometimes, when naturalized citizen cadres acted excessively due to lack of composure, the family would even complain directly to the bureau. Reasonable and restrained, neither humble nor overbearing—it was maddening.

As a result, departments couldn't truly find arbitrary fault. After all, the great households of Guangzhou were watching. The Senate stressed "ruling the country according to law" above all else. If they fabricated charges to ruin the Liang family, the other great households would inevitably feel chilled. It would also damage the Senate's consistent reputation.

The counterfeit currency case, which had recently shown signs of spreading, attracted the attention of various departments. Counterfeit currency was not only increasing in quantity but also continuously improving in quality.

Though no evidence implicated the Liang family, various departments had coincidentally turned their eyes toward them.

Xu Tong briefed on the current counterfeit currency situation:

"The situation summarized by various departments is as follows: Counterfeit currency has now appeared for all hard coins and all large-denomination banknotes issued by the Central Reserve Bank. Some small-denomination notes have also appeared sporadically. Quality has also improved significantly. We can sense they are constantly refining their methods. From these improvements, we can conclude there should be only one counterfeit currency gang. Their work is well-organized with a clear division of labor, and highly skilled craftsmen are presiding over the technical work."

Everyone listened carefully.

"One characteristic that comrades from the Bank and the Finance and Taxation Bureau pointed out: judging from collected counterfeit currency, the counterfeiters have taken great pains, employing tremendous manpower and resources. Based on the quantity discovered and estimates of what's circulating in the market, their counterfeiting operation is very uneconomical—even loss-making. So it cannot be purely for profit; it more likely carries political intent. Director Mu believes this case should be investigated as a political case, and I think this is entirely appropriate."

Yang Cao interjected: "Note—I personally believe this matter probably isn't as simple as just the Liang family participating. It is likely a grand assembly of various anti-Senate forces inside and outside Guangzhou city. And they very likely received support from that so-called 'Shi Weng'—he is the real mastermind behind the scenes!"

Xu Tong continued: "Another concern: since they invested so heavily in counterfeiting with seemingly negative returns, does it also conceal other undiscovered important operations?"

The heavy solid wood doors of the conference room were tightly closed. Xu Tong's words echoed in the room.

"Currently, the behavioral characteristics of various anti-Song forces are primarily..."

"The targeted strike objectives we have preliminarily determined are the following families..."

"The preliminary action plan is..."

"Everyone, please share your respective opinions..."

The long four-hour meeting ended. The attendees left in twos and threes. The swirling smoke in the conference room with its open door gradually dispersed, leaving only ash trays full of cigarette butts on the table.

Yang Cao stretched hard, struck a match to light a lady's "Holy Ship" cigarette, and took a deep drag. The cool mint aroma caused a slight numbness in her lungs. She leaned back comfortably in the rattan chair, closed her eyes, and enjoyed the rare quiet.

Outside the window, dark black clouds occupied the entire sky, shrouding Guangzhou in shadow. Faint thunder rumbled from above, and traces of dancing lightning appeared indistinctly within the heavy cloud layers. Suddenly, a fierce gust of wind swept through the hall, sending the conference room curtains billowing and dancing. Yang Cao slowly opened her eyes, gazed at the world outside, and whispered: "It's going to rain."

Guangzhou remained noisy, while the sword-wielding Valkyrie was slowly ascending the execution platform.
