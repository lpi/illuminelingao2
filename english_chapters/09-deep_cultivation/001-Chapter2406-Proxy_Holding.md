# Chapter 2406: Proxy Holding

Zhang Yu was stunned, not understanding for a moment what Hong Huangnan meant. He could only stammer, "This small one is useless..."

Hong Huangnan waved his hand, signaling his secretary to bring a sealed, bulging kraft paper envelope and hand it to him.

"Inside this is a one-thousand-yuan check and five thousand silver dollars in circulation coupons."

Zhang Yu was so startled he almost dropped the paper bag. Although his business had grown large with a turnover of thousands or tens of thousands, five thousand yuan was still a huge sum to him. Ninety-nine percent of people in Guangzhou city would never handle so much money in their entire lives, let alone hold it in their hands!

"The one-thousand-yuan check inside is a loan from me to the Zhang's Company. The five thousand yuan in cash is a loan from me to you personally." Hong Huangnan bit into a cigar, let the secretary light it, and took a deep drag.

"This... how can I accept this?" Zhang Yu was flustered, holding the heavy paper bag as if it were a burning coal.

Hong Huangnan blew a smoke ring and continued on his own, "You send someone to see Gao Ju and say you intend to buy one thousand yuan of bonds."

Zhang Yu was a bit confused. He originally thought the extra money Senator Hong gave him was to make his bond purchase figure look better so he could have an explanation for Gao Ju. He didn't expect he was still told to buy only one thousand. He dared not question it and only responded, "Yes."

"Then you have someone tell Gao Ju that you intend to buy five thousand shares of Nanyang Company stock when it is issued next."

"Ah?!" Zhang Yu's eyes widened.

He naturally knew about the Nanyang Company issuing stock. However, he shared the same view as most colleagues in the Federation of Industry and Commerce: buy a little to deal with it, but do not buy too much.

Stocks and shareholding systems, although flourishing in Holland and England, were not unique to them. In Guangzhou alone, larger businesses were mostly operated as joint partnerships. There were not only pure capital shares but also "body shares" (labor shares) for shopkeepers and clerks. Physical stores had them, and trading businesses had them too. Especially in maritime trade: small merchants who didn't have their own ships often pooled capital temporarily to purchase goods. Sea merchants who built their own ships to do business also often had pooled capital for the shipbuilding costs.

Although the Great Ming did not have a proper stock exchange, nor supporting systems for stock trading and dividends, and mostly handled things according to folk customs, trading behaviors revolving around shares were not rare and had even spread to the agricultural sector. The business people of Guangzhou were certainly not strangers to this.

If an existing large business sold "stock," the bigwigs of the Federation of Industry and Commerce were mostly willing to buy. In other words, if any of the "Purple" prefixed businesses raised capital, no mobilization or propaganda would be needed; just a single piece of news would be enough for the threshold of the Purple Light Tower to be trampled flat.

But now this Nanyang Company was going down to the South Seas to do business and colonize. This made the old moneybags mutter in their hearts.

Maritime trade was indeed extremely profitable, but the uncontrollable risk factors were too great; shipwrecks and deaths were countless. Businessmen who went bankrupt and ruined their families because of this were not rare. In other words, this was a business with both high returns and high risks.

For most old moneybags, investment for profit still sought "stability." Even if they invested money in maritime trade businesses, they preferred to "lend." As long as there was collateral, the amount lent was negotiable. At least they wouldn't lose everything.

Zhang Yu had listened to their discussions and knew that this "soon to be issued" Nanyang stock did not have much attraction. When the time came, the big households of the Federation would at most buy three to five hundred shares as a gesture. As for himself, that went without saying—the money for the bonds was borrowed!

His mind was quick, and he understood Senator Hong's meaning at once. He said, "Yes, I understand!"

Hong Huangnan nodded and said, "After you go back, write two IOUs and send someone to bring them to me. The borrower for the one-thousand-yuan note is Zhang's Food Company; use your personal name for the five thousand yuan one."

"And the interest and term for the five thousand yuan..."

"No term set, and no interest written. Just write that when I need to use it, I will notify you thirty days in advance. No need to write interest."

Zhang Yu was completely confused now. Let alone writing it, he had never even heard of such an IOU.

"Although interest isn't written, I still want it." Hong Huangnan smiled. "It will be the annual dividends of the Nanyang Company stock."

"Yes."

"I will give you instructions on how to handle the stock after you buy it. Before that, you just need to keep it safe—the dividends too, though I estimate there won't be any dividends for the first few years."

Zhang Yu understood. This wasn't lending money to him; it was having him come forward to hold Nanyang Company stock by proxy. He immediately said, "This small one understands!"

Hong Huangnan looked at him with a faint smile and said, "If you buy five thousand shares, Gao Ju will have to buy ten or twenty thousand at the very least to look good. Your contribution this time is not small."

"I dare not, it is all the Chief's cultivation." Zhang Yu didn't know why, but sweat began to bead on his forehead.

"I heard Gao Ju is building a relationship with you?"

"There is such a thing." Zhang Yu quickly said, "His family's female relatives now often interact with my mother, and he often invites me to his home for banquets and elegant gatherings..." He suddenly remembered the matter of Gao Ju's third concubine trying to act as a matchmaker for him not long ago, and immediately told Hong Huangnan about it.

"Oh, Official Gao treats you truly nicely," Hong Huangnan nodded and smiled slightly. "He can really be counted as having a sincere heart towards the Senate."

"I felt this matter was not quite appropriate, so I asked my mother to decline. But the third concubine came again later to matchmake..."

"Who did she introduce to you?"

"There were daughters of big households and also young ladies of scholarly families; mostly people related to his family in some way."

"You declined them all?"

"Yes, I always felt it was not quite appropriate."

"Oh, then what are your thoughts?"

"My dad and I have the same idea: my family has been small merchants for generations, and we made our fortune entirely relying on the Senate's grace today. We dare not climb high to big households; we still want to dutifully find a girl from a small family to marry."

Hong Huangnan glanced at him, stubbed out the cigar butt, and said, "No need to rush into marriage. You are still young! Do business well, handle matters carefully; your future is vast."

"Yes, I accept the Chief's auspicious words."

"I trust you. You may go."

Zhang Yu returned to his office in the Great World, called Zhang Ting over, gave her the bag, and instructed her to go to the bank to deposit it.

"Brother Yu, where did you get so much money all at once?" Zhang Ting was both surprised and happy.

"I borrowed it." Zhang Yu came out from the Inner World to his own office, a distance of only a few hundred meters, but as soon as he sat down, he felt as if his strength had collapsed. The shirt on his back was soaked through.

"Did Senator Hong lend it?" Zhang Ting asked softly.

Zhang Yu nodded. He checked that the office door was closed and whispered, "You must keep this matter confidential."

Zhang Ting was a bit nervous and nodded solemnly. Looking at the check, she said, "But this check is signed by Chief Hong; people will know as soon as it's cashed at the bank..."

"The check doesn't matter; the key is the cash."

"I will disperse it into the daily business revenue of the company and the old shop over one or two months to deposit it. Just depositing a little more each day."

"Good. Also, write two more IOUs. After writing them, put them in an envelope and seal it." Zhang Yu recounted the requirements for the IOUs in detail. "...Let Yumai send it to the Reception Office tomorrow—he must get a receipt from Senator Hong's secretary!"

After Zhang Ting left, Zhang Yu leaned back in his armchair, feeling his heart pounding wildly. The meeting with Senator Hong today left him a bit unclear about the details, but he felt he completely understood Senator Hong's meaning.

Undoubtedly, starting today, his relationship with Senator Hong had advanced another step. From Senator Hong's words, he heard several layers of meaning: First, do not get too close to Gao Ju. This "Gao Ju" included not only Official Gao but also the old moneybags and old literati in Guangzhou city, regardless of their attitude towards the Senate. Second, Senator Hong did not wish for him to marry quickly...

Zhang Yu understood: wealthy and powerful families would not casually form marriage alliances; they would all weigh things repeatedly and consider the other party's family background before making a decision. If he married just like that, it would be tantamount to losing a certain bargaining chip.

Could it be that Senator Hong's family had a daughter...

He immediately shook his head to throw this thought away, laughing secretly at himself for daydreaming.

Although it didn't necessarily mean a daughter would be betrothed to him, Senator Hong expressing views on his marriage issue once again showed that he would not only continue to support him but also deepen their relationship.

This truly made him both surprised and overjoyed. Originally, relying on chance and coincidence, he had already reached a stage he dared not dream of in the past. But now, Senator Hong had opened a door for him leading to even higher status and more wealth. Before long, even Gao Ju would have to bow to the wind...

Thinking of this, his whole body felt an indescribable tension, heat, and ecstasy... He only felt his blood boiling hot, almost burning through his skin. A desire jumped up and down inside his body, making him restless.

Unknown why, the figure of the tofu shop's young lady, Huo Sanyan, appeared in his mind. Because work had been too busy these days, he rarely went to the old shop, and Huo Sanyan's shadow had originally become very faint in his heart. Remembering her at this moment, however, brought a desire he had never felt before.

Regarding taking a wife, Senator Hong had already said "no rush," and the implication was that neither daughters of big households nor girls of humble families suited him. Then he might as well just bring Huo Sanyan home under the name of taking a concubine! *I am the number one 'Short-hair Merchant' in Guangzhou now; what does getting a little wife count for?!*

But thinking again, if he went to tell his mom and dad like this, they definitely wouldn't agree. The Huo family and his own were old neighbors for many years; they had helped each other when they were poor and humble, and the intention of the two families uniting in marriage had been vaguely revealed. Now that his family had prospered, not marrying the Huo daughter as a wife was barely justifiable since there was no formal engagement; but taking her as a concubine, that would smack of "a small man intoxicated by success." Even if the Huo family were willing, his parents could not do such a thing no matter what.

Zhang Yu circled in the office like a hungry wolf, his mind full of wild thoughts. If anyone else saw him, they would have thought he was distressed over business or funding problems.
