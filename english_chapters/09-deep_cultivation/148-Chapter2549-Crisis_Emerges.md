# Chapter 2549: Crisis Emerges

Wu Yijun thought carefully; it was really so! He had been in the marketplace for a long time and understood market laws. Once a crisis erupted, it couldn't be stabilized by just a piece of official document from the government! originally worried about the overflow of "Paper Cotton" and prevalence of speculation, now analyzing the prospect of yarn and cloth with his cousin-nephew, he instantly felt hair stand on end.

Once the situation Chen Lin mentioned appeared, the cotton textile industry would bear the brunt. The yarn spun from the 720 spindles Nansha Factory was proud of would become a life-taking noose. By then, yarn and cloth would be unsalable, factories would stop production...

He put down the wine cup and said: "Ah Lin, what you said is right. This Paper Cotton matter will explode sooner or later. If a basin of cold water can be poured on it before it explodes, perhaps there is still salvation."

"Nephew thinks so too." Chen Lin said, "The only plan now is to advise the Senators directly. Heard from Miss An and others that Senators Li and Zou already came to Guangzhou not long ago. We entrust her to convey; even if we can't meet, at least must submit a letter."

"Exactly!" Wu Yijun said, "We will discuss and write it right now." Suddenly he remembered something again and said: "Ah Lin, how much cloth and cotton yarn are still unsold inside and outside the factory now?"

"There is quite a bit of yarn and cloth inventory in the factory. Also much yarn distributed to weaving households hasn't been woven and retrieved yet..."

"For existing yarn and cloth, call people to transport them to Guangzhou immediately. While the market is high now, dump them all. Even with some discount, as long as someone is willing to take, get rid of all hands. How many days can the cotton in the factory last?"

"According to current operation, can support about half month."

"Call the manager to spin all cotton into yarn. Then stop machines and tell workers to go back—anyway, it is busy farming time recently; they have work to do back home. Call Fengshenghe to weave the spun yarn into cloth and store it first. Let's look at the market then."

"I will call Ah Qing back to handle this matter right now." Chen Lin suddenly remembered something, whispering, "What about the cotton from Dong Second Master's side? If he wants to give it to us, what to do?"

They didn't favor the long-term market of cotton cloth now. Clearing inventory as much as possible before the big crash. If they ate high-priced cotton at this time, the cost spread down would rise quite a bit.

If it were others, since there was no contract, just refusing would do. But Dong Second Master was not only a shareholder but also promised to sell cotton to them in this state where market rose three times a day; the favor was huge. If going back on words, there would be no face to meet again in the future.

"Just find a reason to decline." Wu Yijun pondered, "How about, you just say you went to Lingao..."

Chen Lin shook his head: "Can't use, can't use. This way, although Dong Second Master won't say anything with mouth, afraid it won't pass so easily in heart. Must think of another way."

Wu Yijun rolled his eyeballs and asked: "Ah Lin, coming to the local place, how many Patterned Cloth Firms have you asked about cotton?"

"Didn't ask a single one." Chen Lin was somewhat baffled.

Wu Yijun immediately called a servant, telling him to inquire immediately about what the current "Paper Cotton" price was.

Not long after, the servant came back to report that Paper Cotton price per picul rose by another half ten percent [5%].

"This is it." Wu Yijun said, "Ah Lin, go everywhere to various Patterned Cloth Firms tomorrow, ask them what price spot goods available for immediate delivery are, how many piculs can be delivered. Say you urgently need it for starting the factory now."

"Buying this cotton, isn't it losing more?" Chen Lin was confused.

"Of course not asking you to buy it down; you just need to let these Patterned Cloth Firms in the city know there is someone begging to buy spot cotton!"

"Oh, you mean, let spot cotton price rise even higher?"

"Correct."

"But this way, how can Dong Second Master convince his family manager..." Suddenly Chen Lin understood completely. His action would fan flames on spot market prices; that Dong family manager would definitely be more unwilling to release stock.

"Hehe, I know a thing or two about that Dong family manager. Most shrewd. Now market is so good, how could he release easily? He holds the Imperial Edict [Mother's order] in hand now; Dong Second Master, this 'dandy,' may not necessarily win over him!" Wu Yijun said complacently.

Wait for this Dong Second Master to go find his mother to negotiate and persuade; a round of hands and feet would take at least three to five days. And based on his understanding of Dong Second Master, this noble person was most "afraid of trouble"; maybe dropping hands right there was possible.

"As long as he can't reply these few days, I will use the excuse that you couldn't wait and went to find other sources."

"If so, naturally everyone is happy." Chen Lin thought in heart: *This Cousin-Uncle's mind is indeed fierce!*

The next day, he followed the method. After a round of inquiry, he specially went to the Penglai Company Office in the Textile Market to find An Jiu, saying he had some views on the current market, hoping to see the two Chiefs—if unable to see, at least ask her help to forward a letter.

An Jiu was somewhat surprised, but she knew Chen Lin was steady; begging to see Chiefs must be for urgent matters. However, although Chiefs Zou and Li were indeed in Guangzhou, they were busy with the preparatory work of Guangzhou Cotton Textile Factory every day. Without concrete matters, it was hard for them to extract time to receive.

"Just say, why do you want Chiefs to receive?" An Jiu said, "You must have a charter [agenda], so I can report..."

"Honestly speaking, it is for the cotton matter." Chen Lin told the chaos of Paper Cotton flooding the market currently and his worries once. "Once Paper Cotton has an accident, afraid the entire industry will be greatly damaged in vitality. Doesn't matter if Chiefs see me or not, but this matter needs to let Chiefs know urgently..."

An Jiu didn't know much about matters in commercial fields, but listening to his analysis, she also felt the situation was serious. Immediately expressed she would go report right now.

"Don't go anywhere tomorrow; just stay at your Cousin-Uncle's home. Maybe you will be summoned anytime!"

"Yes, I understand."

Li Shan, at this moment, was preparing for "Private Visit and Inspection" in the Great World office. Preparing to turn around in the Textile Market to see how the market situation was.

This market was a project he spent great thoughts to mount, an important stroke for him to promote Senate cotton textile development. Seeing official opening imminent, he had to feel the bottom [investigate] first.

Looking from current situation, market response was not bad. But how the specific situation was, still had to go visit personally to know.

Originally he planned to go probe the situation in the Textile Market looking like Ming State clothes and cap. However, after getting a set of clothes to try on, felt uncomfortable all over. Changing several sets in a row all had the feeling of a monkey wearing a hat [dressed up ape].

"Seems clothing has a big relationship with a person's temperament." Li Shan finally decided: not pretending anymore, still comfortable wearing his own clothes.

For safety, and also to hear truth easier, he abandoned the exquisitely made "Senator Clothing," asking people to specially get a set of Blue Cloth "Work Clothes." This kind of clothes used coarse cotton cloth tailored, indigo dyed. It was the most common clothing among Naturalized Citizen employees. Generally, Naturalized Citizen cadres and employees with slight status wouldn't wear it. Counted as a kind of "Disguise and Change Dress."

Li Shan looked at the loose blue cloth clothing like a flour sack in the mirror, couldn't help roasting a sentence: "Really Fucking ugly..."

"Just person ugly." Zou Biao appeared from behind Li Shan, laughing, "Do you need to dress so simply? At least get a set of Cadre Suit to wear. Besides, your temperament, one look doesn't resemble a grassroots employee..."

"Say no more, let's prepare to set off." Li Shan said, "We have to see exactly how much change this reality has compared to history."

"Could it be you feel the Big Picture History Book is already invalid?" Zou Biao originally thought he just wanted to see market preparation situation; didn't expect such a big topic.

"I feel, although can't say invalid, our influence on this timeline is getting bigger and bigger. Many things have been changed. That, that... Butterfly Effect influence seems a bit big... People who should be alive died; people who should be dead are still alive. Variables here are too big. Just Sun Yuanhua being able to restore original post, Shandong's historical trend is already completely disconnected from history."

"This only proves our understanding of history is too superficial, only knowing to utilize short-time events for profit." Zou Biao laughed rarely loud, "In fact, short-time events have the smallest value. Do you think whether the one coming to encircle and suppress us is Xiong Wencan or Zhu Wencan, the one rebelling is Li Zicheng or Zhang Zicheng makes a difference to the Senate?"

"Seems... no difference." No matter who led the army, facing the Senate's crushing advantage, there was no chance of winning.

"The most precious thing about history is the historical laws summarized from countless short-time events, just like the cotton textile industry you and I want to develop now. History won't tell you in detail which year cotton textile handicraft industry should go bankrupt, how many families bankrupt, but it will tell you the process of handicraft bankruptcy and its bankruptcy manifestations."

"'Taking history as a mirror, can know rise and replacement.' Does history here refer to simple piling of historical events? Definitely not. The important thing is summing up laws from piled historical events, then applying such laws to development."

"Seems somewhat empty... Everyone knows bourgeois overthrowing feudal class, also knows laws like machine must replace manual. But what use is talking generally like this?"

"Because this law is summarized by others based on large amounts of historical events; it is others' historical theory. Putting it uglily, it is others chewing stuff then spitting out for you to eat. And your brain doesn't have as much historical fact reserve as them, naturally feeling empty."

"You speak so disgustingly..." Li Shan frowned.

"Give an example: after Opium War, 'Industrial products impact caused fragile family small handcraftsmen to bankrupt' and 'Native cloth produced by family small handcraftsmen was very firm under impact, still selling well in market'—which sentence do you think is correct among these two?"

These two sentences seemed to both appear in descriptions of economy after Opium War; existed in junior and high school history books. Some economic history books also wrote these two diametrically opposite contents.
