# Chapter 2467 - Molesting Women

Chen Lin took the paper bag containing the shirt, hurried a few steps down the stairs, and headed towards the main entrance of the store. Just as he left the gate and was about to go down the steps, he was suddenly bumped, staggered, and the bag in his hand fell to the ground. At the same time, a crisp sound came from the side, as if something had shattered, accompanied by a scream.

He was startled. Just as he was about to get up, he suddenly saw that the person he bumped into was a young woman, sitting on the ground wearing Australian-style women's clothing common locally, with her skirt flipped up revealing two calves. One hand was rubbing her waist, glaring at him viciously.

Seeing him looking over, this woman covered her face with both hands and cried out loudly:

"Stinking hooligan! Catch the hooligan, you pervert... lowlife..."

Chen Lin was dumbfounded with shock. Where had he ever seen this! He came from a merchant family and usually avoided provoking women the most. Not to mention unmarried maidens, even with old women on the street, he would keep a distance when passing by, just to avoid gossip and affecting his reputation.

Unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived in Lingao, he ran into such a thing. He was young after all, and instantly panicked, waving his hands wildly: "Miss, Miss, I didn't, I am not..."

"This proper-looking young man, not learning good, molesting women on the street!"

"Looking at his appearance, he is a Ming person!"

"Looking at the appearance, he is also a young master of a rich family!"

"Accustomed to bullying men and dominating women, I suppose."

"My Great Song won't indulge him!"

"Catch him to the police station and beat his butt to bloom!"

"Seeing him white and tender, his butt must also be..."

"Shh, what nonsense! You are about the same as him!"

Hearing various discussions in his ears and the increasing crowd of onlookers, Chen Lin was completely confused. While he was at a loss, someone suddenly whispered in his ear: "Why not run fast!"

Chen Lin shivered and got up to rush out. However, he had just run a few steps when the crowd shouted loudly: "Catch the hooligan!" "Someone is molesting a woman," followed by someone shouting: "Someone is abducting a woman!"

Everyone shouted in unison: "Hit!"

Now Chen Lin was scared out of his wits, only thinking of "running." Unexpectedly, before he ran a dozen steps, he was surrounded, and fists and feet fell like rain. Chen Lin still remembered what an old accountant in the family had said: when surrounded and beaten outside and unable to run, cover the head with arms and curl the body to protect the chest, abdomen, and groin.

Fortunately, the beating didn't last long before police whistles were heard.

"Don't hit people! Don't hit people!" A voice dispersing the crowd sounded outside, "Everyone scatter, scatter!"

Several hired Petition Police employed by the mall dispersed the crowd and pulled Chen Lin, who had been beaten black and blue, up from the ground. The leading policeman looked at his appearance and frowned: "You look like a decent person, how could you do such an ugly thing! Go to the police station for a trip!"

Petition Police couldn't handle cases, so they immediately transferred him to Bopu Police Station.

Chen Lin was still in shock at this moment and couldn't say a word. He let himself be manipulated by several policemen. He was escorted all the way to the police station for detention, waiting for interrogation.

"What? Molesting a woman?" The duty officer frowned, "Which bastard full of food with nothing to do has such elegant interest again?"

His head started to hurt again. Fifteen consecutive hours of duty and bullshit from all kinds of people had reduced his hormone levels to the lowest and raised his blood pressure to the highest.

There was still one hour before getting off work, and now came such a character!

"Looks like a Ming person, seemingly quite rich." The policeman who delivered him reported.

"Has the involved party arrived?"

"Arrived, but later said the girl was not feeling well and was frightened, so she went back first, saying she would come again tomorrow."

"Tomorrow then. Anyway, it's not urgent." Hearing the party didn't come, the officer waved his hand, "Take a statement from him first, lock him up for a night to cool down. We'll talk tomorrow when the party comes!"

After instructing, the assistant yawned, poured down a cup of strong tea, rubbed his eyes, and began to write today's duty summary.

Chen Lin was dragged around like a puppet on a string, and only recovered his senses when he arrived at the police station. This is getting into a lawsuit! Although he still didn't understand why that woman framed him, he understood how bad the current situation was. Not to mention he had missed the welcome banquet, he was also imprisoned.

However, no matter how he explained he didn't do bad things, the police turned a deaf ear and took him to the interrogation room on their own.

"Name."

"No, officer (*Chaye*), this is a misunderstanding!"

"Shut up! Answer what asked!"

"Chen... Chen Lin... the 'Lin' for long rain not stopping..."

"What long rain not stopping?"

"Yes, just a rain (*Yu*) on top..." Chen Lin knew there was no reason to argue with people in public offices, so he could only swallow his anger and say. Unexpectedly, this policeman had just become literate not long ago and found writing very difficult. He felt it was wrong after writing several times and cursed:

"You group of bird scholars! Creating characters so complicated! Watch me slap you with a big ear..."

Hearing this, Chen Lin dared not say a word, fearing he would really give him a big slap. He had heard of various tricks in the yamen. Although he also heard that Australian police were different from Great Ming's yamen runners and constables, since ancient times, official hearts were like iron and royal laws like furnaces; falling into the hands of public offices, most likely there would be no good fruit to eat.

Finally, Chen Lin wrote the name himself.

"...From Guangzhou? No wonder!" The policeman glanced at the clothes on him, "Looks like a rich person."

"This lowly one is a traveling merchant."

"Can traveling merchants molest women?!"

"No, no, this lowly one is wronged!"

"Wronged my ass! A big maiden damaged her own reputation to frame you! I see you still don't know the severity of my Great Song's laws!" The policeman pointed at his nose and scolded.

"This lowly one is really wronged." Chen Lin now tasted what it meant by "unable to defend oneself with a hundred mouths." He defended repeatedly: "This lowly one just arrived in Lingao today..."

"Just arrived in Lingao and molested women?"

"This lowly one didn't." Chen Lin wanted to cry but had no tears, "This lowly one came to Lingao with the Guangzhou Industrial and Commercial Delegation! If the officer doesn't believe, ask and you will know. The contact cadre is called Chen Xiaobing..."

Hearing him say this, the policeman actually paid attention—he had seen this matter in this week's social situation briefing. If he accidentally arrested a "Guest of the Senate," the police station had no right to handle it themselves. Seeing the policeman roll his eyes, he asked: "Since you came from Guangzhou, where are you staying?"

"I am staying at Jasmine Hotel in Bopu..."

This immediately made the policeman laugh loudly. Chen Lin asked puzzledly: "Every sentence this lowly one said is true; the room card is still on me..."

"Since you are a member of the delegation, don't you know the delegation stays at Longhao Bay Hotel? When did you move to Jasmine Hotel? I see you guy are very dishonest!" The policeman slammed the table, "I advise you to understand, this is not a Ming Dynasty yamen. You'd better reflect well here, waiting for your deserved punishment!"

Chen Lin wanted to cry but had no tears, defending again about insufficient rooms and so on. The policeman was too lazy to talk nonsense with him, took him to the temporary detention room, involuntarily asked him to take out all items on him for registration, took away his trouser belt and waist belt, opened a barred door, and locked him in.

"You squat here for a night first, and we'll process it tomorrow when the party comes." The guard policeman was anxious to get off work.

"Officer! Officer! I'll write a note; trouble you to ask someone to help send it to Longhao Bay Hotel for me! They know!" Chen Lin held his trousers and shouted desperately behind the iron bars, looking at the back of the policeman leaving with hands behind his back.

The few detained criminals in the same room all looked fierce and evil, looking like bad people at a glance. There was also a drunkard lying on the bench snoring like thunder. That night, Chen Lin didn't sleep all night, trembling with fear in the detention room, daring not close his eyes. As soon as he closed his eyes, he thought of stories of prisoners in jail he heard before. What torture, what punching and kicking, what young and handsome prisoners would be sodomized...

Finally, the night passed without incident. When the sky was slightly bright, Chen Lin fell asleep instead. When he woke up, the sun was already high. The prisoners in the same room had changed several people. The drunkard was also nowhere to be seen.

He waited for "going to court" in fear and uneasiness. Unexpectedly, this wait lasted until the afternoon. At noon, the guard gave him a piece of dry food as hard as stone and a cup of hot water. Chen Lin saw this guard was old and had kind eyes, so he took the opportunity to ask:

"Officer, when do I go to court?"

"Go to court?" The guard shook his head, "You are that one who molested a woman yesterday?"

"Ai ai ai, I didn't molest her! She framed me!"

"People who come in here all say they are wronged." The guard laughed, "Don't be impatient, just wait."

"How much longer to wait?"

"Anyway, as long as not convicted, detain you for at most seventy-two hours. You have already passed one day; wait at most two more days to go to court—maybe won't even wait that long. You rest assured, yours is a small romantic crime, probably sentenced to twelve lashes. You can leave after the beating. The butt will hurt for a week and be fine." The guard looked calm.

"Officer, officer, can I beg you to do a favor, ask someone to help send a message for me, heavy thanks! Heavy thanks!..."

"Send a message? Didn't you register the notification recipient when you came in?"

"No..."

"Then tell me, I'll help you register."

Chen Lin felt like grabbing a life-saving straw and hurriedly told the guard the room number of Chen Ding and himself at Longhao Bay Hotel.

"Trouble officer to find someone to help send the letter..." Because Chen Lin was searched, he had nothing on him, so he could only use the most sincere tone, "That Master Chen is my uncle; he will definitely thank heavily when delivered."

"Okay, I'll help you arrange it. How do these guys do things!" The guard said and walked away on his own.

Chen Lin sat in the detention room, days feeling like years, only waiting for his uncle and Chen Xiaobing and others to come rescue him. However, waiting left and waiting right, there was no news. Seeing twilight gradually falling, he was like an ant on a hot pan: *Where on earth did Uncle go?!*
