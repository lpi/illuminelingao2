# Chapter 2506: Burning the Tower (19)

At this moment, Chen Simazi was a little anxious. He walked to Xue Tu's side and cupped his fists, saying, "Marshal, counting Sun Gang, we have already injured four brothers today. How can we turn our elbows outward and favor an outsider? Where does this put the face of us brothers?"

Li Baiqing squeezed forward at this time and said loudly, "What outsider? After the alliance, we are all our own brothers. Do we still have to distinguish between inside and outside in the future? Must we 'outsiders' be bullied by you 'insiders'?"

Just then, Ge Yaoxian brought over the life-and-death contract. Without speaking, he presented the life-and-death document to Xue Tu, glancing at Chen Simazi from the corner of his eye with a sarcastic sneer.

Xue Tu looked at the life-and-death contract with an iron-green face. Just as Chen Simazi was about to speak, Xue Tu suddenly darkened his face and shouted sternly, "Can't win in a fist fight, yet still want help? Moved iron weapons yet still let others overturn the scene? And still have the face to come find me to back you up? After today, everyone is a brother of a different surname. Brother Li suffered a great wrong. I, Xue, will absolutely not show partiality. Don't let it spread outside to make it seem like my Daoist Spirit Society has no rules. Today I will make a decision..."

Chen Simazi, standing aside listening, flushed red in the face. He was just panting heavily, his gaze staring dead at Xu Tong.

Hearing this, Xu Tong suddenly took a step back, bowed to Xue Tu and Chen Simazi. Everyone was stunned, not knowing what he meant. Xu Tong shook his head and then said, "This is not appropriate."

Blue veins jumped on Chen Simazi's forehead. He gritted his teeth and asked viciously, "What do you still want?"

Xu Tong said, "Although I have slight friction with Brother Sun, I respect Sun Gang as a straightforward man. Seeing the truth in his hands, although his disciples acted slightly recklessly, they were also eager to protect their master, agitated by momentary impulse. Moreover, my strikes just now were also a bit heavy, injuring several brothers. So let the two cancel each other out. I, Li, will take out one hundred taels of silver myself to treat the injuries of the brothers. Another day I will visit to pay respects." After speaking, he took out a Delong hundred-yuan passbook from his bosom, held it above his head and waved it for everyone to see, then bowed and presented it to Xue Tu with both hands. Xue Tu looked at the silver bill, then at Xu Tong, his expression uncertain.

Xu Tong said loudly again, "Currently, foreign barbarians, falsely claiming to be Song descendants, are ravaging the countryside. At this time of Kun rebellion, there should be benevolent people and lofty ideals, possessing integrity, to be the first in the world. Today, the Marshal's loyal soul shines with the sun and moon. I, Li, feel the same. Now I swear here, willing to follow the Marshal to kill enemies at the front, acting as the vanguard, expelling the Kun captives, and recovering the Great Ming mountains and rivers." Speaking to this point, his eyes filled with tears, unable to control himself. With a *plop*, he knelt down, facing Xue Tu, hitting the ground with his head repeatedly until his forehead bled and tears streamed down his face.

Seeing this, Xue Tu hurriedly took a few steps, walked to Xu Tong's side, and helped him up. Voice choked with emotion, he said, "Brother Li need not be like this! Now having worthy brother's help is no less than Liu Bei luckily getting Guan and Zhang. You and I are congenial. As the saying goes: brothers of one heart, their sharpness cuts gold. With such a good general, what does Xue have to fear? In this chaotic time, heroes appear in large numbers in the world. It can be seen that the Kun thieves' fate is exhausted! Great things can be expected!"

Speaking to this point, the two held arms and laughed loudly, their heroic spirit reaching the clouds. The crowd did not understand and was confused, but they had to laugh along dryly, appearing harmonious.

The sun turned west. Various alliance regulations were negotiated, and a date for re-alliance was set. The attendees gradually went down the mountain and dispersed. Everyone watched a succession of good shows today, and with the alliance matter hanging in their hearts, each person had mixed feelings, unable to describe the taste, dispersing down the mountain in a mess.

Xue Tu watched everyone leave. The black face that had remained tense finally relaxed. He appeared somewhat tired and walked slowly into the rear hall of Iron Beam Temple. A table of wine and food had long been set in the rear hall. Wooden Stone Daoist and Yun Ting sat at the table waiting for a long time. Seeing him enter, they hurriedly stood up to welcome him, saying repeatedly, "Marshal has worked hard."

Xue Tu sat down slowly, waved his hand to signal the two not to stand on ceremony, and said to the outside of the door, "Close the door. Do not enter without being called." A member in front of the door bowed, backed out, and gently closed the door.

Wooden Stone Daoist raised his cup to toast, saying, "Marshal's great matter was assisted today; you shall unfold grand plans."

Xue Tu shook his head and said, "Still far from it. Didn't you see those outsiders acting strangely, saying one thing and meaning another? If I want to integrate the various families into one body, it will still take a lot of effort."

Wooden Stone laughed, "Marshal is too modest. The general trend is set. In two days, activate the hidden pieces to remove those who do not understand the times. Who else can stop the Marshal from leaping like a dragon into the clouds?"

Wooden Stone Daoist changed the subject and said coldly, "Only letting that man surnamed Li go down the mountain today was truly a major blunder. This person is capable in both civil and military affairs and is suspected of being a Kun spy. Letting him go back is no different from releasing a tiger back to the mountains."

Xue Tu echoed with a laugh, drank a mouthful of wine, and said, "If not release, did we really have to kill all these many people harboring different ambitions? How would those many new members see it? I'm afraid before the Kun thieves come to suppress us, this Daoist Spirit Society will scatter tomorrow."

Wooden Stone Daoist walked slowly to Xue Tu's side and whispered, "Others can be kept; this person cannot be kept. Such a character, whether becoming a running dog for the Kun thieves or contending for power with us, is a serious trouble in our gut. But this is all minor details. What is truly worrisome is not this matter."

Xue Tu looked at Wooden Stone Daoist suspiciously and asked, "Oh? Then what is the worrisome matter the Daoist speaks of?"

Wooden Stone smiled faintly and said gently, "Marshal, I'm afraid you have long harbored the heart to defect to the Kun, haven't you?"

Needle-tips jumped slightly on Xue Tu's eyebrows. His deep gaze looked at Wooden Stone Daoist. The candle flame in front flickered, reflecting in the pupils on Xue Tu's fat face like two points of ghost fire ignited, seeming to want to suck Wooden Stone Daoist's soul into it, pulling it into a bottomless abyss.

Xue Tu's black fat face was expressionless, silent, turning his head to stare at Wooden Stone. Wooden Stone Daoist stood up, walked slowly to Xue Tu's side, and said leisurely, "A tuft of grass on the wall falls to whichever side the wind blows. Standing in the *jianghu* depends on eyesight and wind direction. Marshal... no, Brother Xue, now the Kun thieves are powerful. Brother Xue wants to keep a retreat step; this poor Daoist can also empathize. Presumably, Brother Xue saw that Liu Xiang surrendered to the Kun thieves and was somewhat moved; this is also unavoidable."

Xue Tu suddenly laughed and said, "Daoist worries too much. Xue's heart is toward the Imperial Court; how could I have those crooked thoughts? Daoist had better not speculate randomly."

Wooden Stone Daoist also laughed along, shook his head, and said, "These words are wrong. Which person in the *jianghu* truly has any loyal liver and righteous gall? Deep in troubled times, everyone feels the wind and rain swinging, at a loss, afraid of taking a wrong step. Who doesn't worry about their own future? Brother Xue's foundation is around this Guangzhou Prefecture, relying on local gentry and wealthy households assisting with money and grain, relying on absorbing members to fight and kill. Leaving this place is like a dragon leaving the sea, a fierce tiger leaving the forest. Now the Kun thieves are swallowing Guangdong, harboring the world in their chest. Now they have established a court on this Guangzhou ground. Looking from common sense, choosing the strong to serve is the correct principle. Brother Xue rushing to unify the Daoist sects like this is just feeling that the earlier capital was too small. Betting two or three thousand people on the table, I'm afraid you can't get much from the Kun thieves. But if you net this group of people, then sell the Daoist sects and mountain bandits of this Guangzhou ground to the Kun thieves in one go, helping the Australian government calm the ground, dyeing a set of purple robes and red gown with the neck blood of thousands of gentry and people... this business is actually doable."

Wooden Stone paused, then continued, "That Li Jian was called out by someone at the alliance meeting. Regardless of whether that Green Dragon Society identity is true or false, if following Brother Xue's past resolute character, where would you make any distinction? An outsider—drag him out and chop him or take him down. Keeping such a tail today, who are you trying to disgust? Speaking back and forth, it's still Brother Xue calculating well. If that Li Jian is truly a Kun thief spy, releasing him establishes good Karma for the future. If not, removing him in a few days is just a matter of spending a little more effort. Brother Xue would rather release one thousand wrongly than kill one unjustly. Haha, I didn't expect Brother Xue to have such a time of Bodhisattva heart."

Xue Tu frowned and said, "How is the Daoist already drunk without drinking? Why say so many nonsense words? Come, I, Xue, will pour a cup of wine for the Daoist to relieve boredom. Do not speak such crazy words again."

After speaking, Xue Tu went to take the wine pot on the table. Just as he was about to pour wine for Wooden Stone, a large hand extended from the side, grabbing the pot handle and Xue Tu's wrist tightly together. Xue Tu looked sideways; it was Yun Ting. He couldn't help but change his expression, saying coldly, "What is the meaning of this, Second Brother Yun?"

Yun Ting slowly increased the force in his hand and said in a deep voice, "I see worthy brother Xue is tired. I'm supporting you a bit. In case worthy brother's hand is unsteady and drops this pot on the ground smashing it, causing the brothers outside the door to misunderstand, I'm afraid that would be bad."

Xue Tu struggled a few times but didn't move a fraction. His face slowly became stiff. After a moment of stalemate, he finally gave up, exhaled lightly, and unwillingly released the wine pot.

At this time, members outside the door asked loudly, "Marshal, is there anything else needed?"

Xue Tu looked at Yun Ting, who was close to his side, and shouted, "Nothing. Everything is fine here. Tell the brothers to all withdraw." After a short while, a burst of human voices sounded outside the door, mixed with one or two sounds of metal colliding, then it returned to calm again.

After the door quieted down, Wooden Stone continued, "The Marshal integrating heroes of various paths seeks nothing more than the word 'power'. Since ancient times, societies and Ways exist and settle among the people and villages, bewildering the common people with evil theories and crooked talk, and mostly harboring strange ambitions. Historically, they have been thorns in the flesh and eyes of the government. But current affairs are eroded, and imperial power is hard to send down to the villages. They have no choice but to grasp the big and release the small, governing the people through gentry. Only this gave the societies and rural worthies loopholes for manipulation. But the Australians are different. I hear that what is practiced in Lingao is a system of Officials and Clerks as one body, managed together from top to bottom. They call this 'political power going down to the basic level'. Right now, letting you run wild is just because soldiers and generals are not broad, cadres are few, and hard to apply to use. But if you pay attention, you can see that the frameworks, names, and official titles of those managing affairs in various villages and townships are changing. The closer to Guangzhou, the faster and deeper the change. In such places, relying on soldiers and armor, using unruly people as bones and Kun officials as brains, they first build the framework. Wait until the Kun thief cadres are trained and arrive at their posts, then fill in the flesh and blood in order. The Kun thieves call this specific consolidating the political power of the core ruled area; it's called 'using points to lead the area'. The longer time passes, the harder it is to shake. Wait until the Kun thieves have operated for several years and the foundation in Guangdong is stable; at that time, it will be the time for them to sweep the world."
