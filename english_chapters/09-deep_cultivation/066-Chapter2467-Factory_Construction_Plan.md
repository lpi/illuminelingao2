# Chapter 2467 - Factory Construction Plan

After viewing the spinning process, they went to the weaving workshop. As they walked, Li Shan introduced the performance and output of the looms. The group watched the shuttles of the looms dancing, the clicking sounds ceaseless, yet there was no one operating them beside the machines; only female workers walked around inspecting and connecting threads.

Chen Lin calculated silently in his heart. There were about fifty or sixty machines here, but only a dozen or so people patrolling back and forth. It seemed that one skilled hand could watch four or five looms; this was too astonishing. Not only were these looms fast, but they also used very few people. Taking Nansha as an example, if twenty female workers and dozens of laborers could be trained, less than a hundred people could run a hundred machines. According to this Chief Li Shan's introduction, one machine here, if weaving ordinary plain cloth, operating only during the day and not at night, could weave about 60 meters per day. Roughly calculated at three meters per *zhang*, that was twenty *zhang* of cloth.

He knew in his heart that a good skilled loom weaver could only weave a little over one *zhang* of cloth in a day. This production efficiency was simply a difference between heaven and earth! Moreover, a mechanical weaving factory had one person watching four or five machines. Fifty machines a day...

Chen Lin shuddered. Once this thing came out, how could there be a way for native cloth to survive! Thinking again of his own silk weaving workshop, if it could also be like this...

His sense of crisis became even stronger. If his Second Uncle, whom the whole family looked down upon, could really connect with the Australians and transform and upgrade silk weaving like this, where would be the way for him and Third Uncle in the future?

*Must find a way to seize back control of the silk weaving workshop!* Chen Lin thought. *If he can cling to an Elder, so can I!*

Chen Ding, on the contrary, was not as worried as this nephew; instead, he discussed with Wu Yijun enthusiastically from time to time.

After seeing the weaving factory, the next production link should have been the printing and dyeing factory. However, at present, the Senate did not yet mass-produce chemical dyes, and there was no intention to promote the printing and dyeing industry, so Li Shan led them around a corner to the exhibition hall.

The final destination of the visiting group was the exhibition hall of the Light Textile Park. Here were displayed hand-spinning machines collected from various places and various textile equipment produced by the Bairen General Machinery Plant. These equipments varied in size and shape, looking dazzling, and one couldn't figure out what they were used for. Fortunately, there was a description in front of each machine, briefly describing its specific use and production efficiency.

Finally, there was a sand table display, showing the complete production process of various textile enterprises and the floor plan layout of relevant factory workshops in the form of models, which was clear at a glance.

Chen Ding said: "These equipments perform their own functions; combined, they form a workshop, and several workshops combined form a factory."

"In that case, there is not much difference from a workshop. It's just that the scale is large," Chen Lin said, "and also manpower is not used."

"Just this not using manpower is not something we can hope to reach." Wu Yijun was somewhat worried, "Just now I asked Young Brother Chen; he said these equipments are either powered by steam engines or water turbines. He specifically asked about my intention."

"Steam engines need to burn boilers; Australians say coal must be used. This is not easy to buy." Chen Ding said, "I wonder if burning firewood is okay?"

"I asked; Young Brother Chen said don't think about burning firewood. Must burn coal. If buying coal is inconvenient, then only hydraulic machines can be used."

Coal was not as widely used in Guangdong as in the north. Coal-producing areas were mostly in mountainous regions, making mining and transportation inconvenient. Plus, timber resources were abundant, so even smelting mostly used charcoal. The only stable coal supplier was the Australians. But the steam coal was not enough for the Senate's own use, let alone for commercial market supply.

Therefore, the so-called steam engine power choice was just for show; effectively, what was mainly promoted was the hydraulic textile factory. This was not only considering the fuel problem but also considering that the maintenance workload required for steam engine power units was large, and private factories lacking technical personnel would find it difficult to maintain.

"Nansha has plenty of rivers, and my family is a large clan; using water is not a problem. Listening to Comrade Chen's meaning: steam engines have great strength and can drive more machines; but hydraulic machines satisfy the condition of not using coal, and are easier to use."

"Not using coal can save the expense of burning coal."

The three people couldn't care less about looking at the sand table and started calculating costs.

Using hydraulic machines, according to the description and the sand table, there would be a large expense for the construction of canals and dams when building the factory building. However, although the expense was large, it was a one-time investment. Unlike steam engines, which had to burn coal every day when running—wasn't this equivalent to burning money!

Chen Xiaobing watched them coldly as they whispered and whispered around the sand table, knowing that these few were calculating costs. He didn't disturb them, only speaking when they opened their mouths to ask.

After the visit, Li Shan invited the group to the park guesthouse for a short rest.

The guesthouse was a small three-story brick building. Because they were not staying overnight here, they were only invited to rest briefly in the lounge.

This lounge was very distinctive. Australian decoration styles included luxurious ones and simple ones; these three had seen some, but only this place was different.

Saying it was traditional, it had common hall furnishings, but a "Four Waters Returning to the Hall" style skywell (open courtyard) was specially set up. A pond was dug in the skywell, equipped with a small rockery. Under the murmuring flowing water were more than ten red carp. Next to it was a statue of Guan Gong with closed eyes, and potted orange trees and pine trees were also displayed.

The three roughly understood that this was a Feng Shui arrangement for seeking wealth, and secretly wondered in their hearts. This was really rare!

This display was also set up after Li Shan came; the reason? It was because he believed in this. Zou Biao disapproved of this but couldn't stop him, so he let him have free rein.

The group sat down in the hall. A young girl came out carrying tea cups to serve tea. Chen Lin looked at her and felt she looked familiar, but couldn't remember where he had seen her. Turning his head to see Chen Ding, obviously, he had the same feeling.

The girl was also slightly stunned when seeing them, then covered her mouth with the tray, seemingly laughing. Before the Chen family uncle and nephew could understand, Li Shan had already walked in with large strides.

"Gentlemen, how was the visit?"

"Eye-opening." Wu Yijun hurriedly stood up and responded.

"I won't say much polite talk. You are all future responsible persons of cotton mills. If such a set of equipment is delivered to your hands, can it operate normally?"

There was a meaning of examination in these words. Fortunately, they had discussed most of it before coming. Combining with the sand table just now, the three made some calculations again.

Don't look at Wu Yijun as an outsider; in terms of business acumen and speaking ability, he was the strongest among the three. Immediately, he elaborated on several key points one by one: how they chose the factory site, how to solve the water source problem, the source of workers, raw material procurement, market, etc. Although merchants of this era couldn't make flashy PPTs, the basic business operation ideas were the same. Wu Yijun spoke with logic and rough data. It made Li Shan nod continuously, feeling very admiring in his heart. Indeed, those who dared to bid were not mediocrities!

"...In that case, you also have a well-thought-out plan."

"Dare not accept the praise. After all, this is a major event involving tens of thousands of taels of silver. Since we want to proceed, we must prepare thoroughly. Otherwise, if we lose silver, we also damage the Senate's face, right?"

"Haha, you really know how to talk." Li Shan laughed loudly, feeling there was a trace of threat in this middle-aged merchant's words, but this made him feel the visitor was more practical. "No more nonsense. What worries do you have? Speak out."

"Avoid worries." The three exchanged glances quickly. This was the key point.

Wu Yijun sorted out his thoughts and said: "Reporting to the Chief, everything else is easy to say. What we worry about most is that these machines are all brand new things, and there isn't a single skilled worker..."

With so many completely new production equipments and processes, anyone with common sense knew how many problems would be hidden inside. Current weavers were completely useless and all had to "learn the trade" from scratch.

"Your doubts are also normal. After all, this is a completely new start for you." Li Shan said, "But on this, you can rest assured. In the relevant contract, we have included three years of free technical guidance. For a project like cotton textile, three years of free technical guidance is more than enough. Machine production is not as difficult as you imagine."

Seeing they still had doubts, Li Shan simply revealed the specific plan.

"Once entering the factory civil construction stage, you will recruit workers. Regarding approximately what quantity of male and female workers, and what requirements to meet, a specific standard will be given to you. You recruit according to this. After recruitment is full, send them all to Lingao to work and learn in the factory you just visited, using the method of 'old leading new'. When civil construction and installation are all completed, they can start production as soon as they return to the factory."

"This method is good..." Chen Lin blurted out.

"These workers' accommodation and food in Lingao..."

"It's like this: your workers work in the demonstration factory, receiving wages and related allowances according to the treatment of apprentices here. Food and accommodation expenses will be deducted from their income."

Originally, the Planning Academy meant to ask the bidders to pay internship fees and food/accommodation fees. But Li Shan thought this expense was too large, and also too unkind. Working for you for free and having to pay wages in reverse?

"After all, our project contract includes technical service clauses; there is no reason to ask people for money again. Besides, this project takes at least half a year from the start of civil construction to completion and operation. We are equivalent to using cheap labor for six months; we don't lose anything at all."

"Chiefs are really thoughtful."

"However, as a factory, with modern production, there must be modern management. So besides apprentices, relevant management personnel should also be selected and sent to study by you according to requirements." Li Shan smiled, "These positions require a longer time to learn and also require a certain cultural foundation. I suggest you select suitable personnel to come to Lingao for study as soon as possible."
