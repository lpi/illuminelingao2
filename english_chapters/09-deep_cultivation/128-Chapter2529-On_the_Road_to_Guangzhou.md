# Chapter 2529: On the Road to Guangzhou

To pass the tedious hours of travel, Zhang Xiao and Lin Motian discussed the situation in Nanhai County at length. Before they knew it, mealtime had arrived, announced by the unmistakable grumbling of their stomachs. They made their way across the deck toward the dining room and encountered a young man of sixteen or seventeen helping a middle-aged man with limited mobility shuffle slowly in the same direction.

"Liu Sixian, why didn't you put your father in a wheelchair?" Lin Motian's orthopedic background kicked in at the sight. "The sea can get rough—a fall would be disastrous."

"It's quite alright, Chief Lin. I wanted to walk," the middle-aged man interjected. "I've spent most of my life bedridden. Thanks to your miraculous healing, I finally have the chance to stand again. Let me use these legs while I can, to measure what I may of this vast land."

The speaker was Liu Dalin. By modern standards, forty-one was merely middle age. But Ming Dynasty people lived by the saying "since ancient times, few reach seventy"—more than half his life had already passed. His chronic poor health had given him the bearing of someone far older than his years.

According to the original timeline, Liu Dalin would have died years ago. In this parallel history, however, modern medicine brought by the Senate had not only extended his life but restored some of his mobility. With improving health and better spirits in recent years, his face bore fewer marks of time than most natives his age.

As Lingao General Hospital's most prominent native patient, Liu Dalin was well acquainted with the Senators in the medical sector, Zhang Xiao included.

Zhang Xiao smiled. "Committee Member Liu, the Government Affairs Council worried that traveling by civilian ship might be risky given your condition, so they arranged for you to take the *Nemesis* with us to Guangzhou. Weather at sea is unpredictable—perhaps we should have another person help support you?" He moved to take Liu Dalin's other arm.

"That's too much—I couldn't possibly trouble you, Chief!" Liu Dalin protested, clearly flustered by the attention. But before he could refuse, Zhang Xiao had already taken hold of him.

"Committee Member Liu, if you keep being so polite, we'll have no choice but to force you into the wheelchair," Lin Motian laughed.

Liu Dalin could only smile helplessly and let them settle him into the chair.

Once seated, he said, "I couldn't help overhearing you two discussing Xiqiao Mountain earlier. It sounded like you might be interested in visiting. I studied there in my youth—if you don't mind, I could serve as your guide."

Zhang Xiao had no real interest in the mountain, but brushing off such good intentions felt rude. "That sounds wonderful. If time permits, certainly!" he said politely.

"I won't hide it from you," Liu Dalin continued. "Beyond attending the Guangdong Region Advisory Bureau activities, I'm also visiting at the invitation of a fellow graduate—a *tongnian*. His connection to Xiqiao Mountain runs far deeper than mine."

"You mean Chen Zizhuang?"

Liu Dalin blinked in surprise, then quickly understood: the Australians' intelligence network had likely uncovered this connection long ago.

"As perceptive as ever, Chief. Yes, it's Chen Jisheng."

Zhang Xiao nodded. "I know something of this Chen Jisheng. He's talented and principled, and devoted to the Ming State. Asking him to serve the Senate is probably futile."

"You're right. He does have a certain... stubborn idealism."

"Stubborn idealism isn't necessarily a flaw. I think Chen Jisheng's character is respectable enough. If you see him, pass along a message for us: Great Song's laws are entirely different from those of the Ming State. We won't force an invitation. So long as he's content to remain a wealthy private citizen and harbors no other ambitions, there will be no trouble."

Zhang Xiao understood that when it came to intrigue and scheming, none of the few hundred modern people could match these native masters of political cunning. Since the Senate could rely on overwhelming strength, their approach was open strategy—they might as well speak plainly.

"Absolutely. I'll convey your words," Liu Dalin assured him.

The Senate Special Ship was steam-powered. To improve travel comfort for Senators, it featured a first-class dining room and even refrigeration equipment manufactured in Lingao. On calm days, the galley could be lit, allowing hot meals. If the weather turned foul, the stove had to be extinguished to prevent fire—but even then, the steam engine could heat steamed dishes and rice easily enough.

Today, the *Nemesis* enjoyed favorable conditions with gentle seas. The spread in the dining room included: Twice-Cooked Pork, Mapo Tofu, Roast Lamb, Roast Duck, Tomato-Braised Beef Brisket, Fuqi Feipian, White Cut Chicken, Potatoes, Smashed Cucumbers, and Fruit Salad.

Zhang Xiao invited Liu Dalin to dine at their table. Over the years, the Senate's governance of Hainan had dramatically improved public safety and living conditions, earning Liu Dalin's genuine approval. The Senate treated him as one of their own.

Liu Sixian initially moved toward a smaller table. Still a student and underage, he wasn't qualified by ancient custom to dine alongside officials. In the Great Ming, this would be the equivalent of sharing a meal with the Chongzhen Emperor himself. But the Senate had never stood on such ceremony, and they insisted he stay.

Zhang Xiao took a piece of roast duck. "Back to our earlier topic. As the saying goes, thugs aren't frightening—what's frightening is educated thugs."

Lin Motian summarized: "In other words, Nanhai—and Guangzhou more broadly—is a stronghold of entrenched opposition. Independent local military forces remain scattered throughout the region. Even though Guangzhou surrendered without bloodshed initially, conflict is inevitable. It's just like when Li Chengdong entered Guangdong and took Guangzhou peacefully at first, only to fight back and forth across Guangdong and Guangxi for years afterward—eventually massacring Guangzhou City."

"May I ask, who is Li Chengdong? When did he enter Guangzhou?" Liu Dalin listened in confusion. At the word "massacre," a chill ran down his spine.

Lin Motian realized his slip and feigned nonchalance. "Haven't you read that new novel? The science fiction one about a parallel world where the Jin Tartars conquered everything during the Pre-Song period? Li Chengdong is the general they sent to subjugate Guangdong and Guangxi."

"I've never read novels." Liu Dalin knew this was a cover story but had no desire to press further. He simply ate in silence while the two Senators continued their conversation.

Zhang Xiao finished his duck and picked up a lamb skewer, eating as he spoke. "The complexity of Guangzhou's current situation far exceeds what most people imagine. Without absolute military superiority, establishing a foothold there would be near-impossible. Given that reality, inserting Senate governance at the grassroots level in a place like Nanhai County—where feudal forces are exceptionally strong—is a massive challenge for anyone. Young Hou is still too green, without enough experience at the local level."

"It comes down to a shortage of cadres. Or rather, qualified cadres. We have no choice but to send Senators personally." Lin Motian sipped his kvass, let out a satisfied burp, and savored the moment of leisure. "*Seamen love their bellies above everything else.*"

Seeing Lin Motian deliberately shift the topic, Zhang Xiao followed his lead toward food. "Conditions are vastly better now than when we first arrived. I remember eating Spanish seafood paella until I couldn't stand the sight of it. The smell alone still gives me flashbacks. Though I have to say, this cook's skills don't hold a candle to Li Mei's." Zhang Xiao sighed with regret. He and Ming Qiu were both from Sichuan Province. Since Ming Qiu's semi-retirement, Zhang Xiao took every opportunity to visit his home in Lingao and enjoy proper Sichuan cuisine.

Li Mei was perpetually busy and rarely had time to cook at home. However, she had trained an excellent team of Sichuan chefs at the Commercial Hall Restaurant. Occasionally, she would bring them to her home to prepare a "family feast" for fellow Senators—her own way of maintaining connections.

"Honestly, I never took you for someone picky about food," Lin Motian remarked.

"I reserve the right to evaluate it." Zhang Xiao wiped his hands with a napkin. "Do you know why the Old Lord of Heaven created Sichuan?"

"I don't."

"To provide chefs for the world!" Zhang Xiao declared with absolute confidence—never mind that he hadn't cooked a single meal since arriving in Lingao.

"Sichuan rats being delicious certainly lives up to its reputation."

"The thing about Sichuan cuisine is that it's authentic common people's food. The ingredients are diverse, and the flavors go perfectly with rice." Zhang Xiao spoke with pride. "Other regional cuisines would be much harder to replicate here—the ingredients simply aren't available."

"As a doctor, I have reservations."

"Tch! Then don't eat it if you're so principled!"

When the *Nemesis* docked at the Guangzhou Great World Military Pier, sedan chairs from the Municipal Government were already waiting at the entrance. The Provincial-Port General Hospital was located inside Guangzhou Great World, so Lin Motian bid everyone farewell and returned to his duties. Liu Sixian helped his father proceed ahead to the Region Advisory Bureau.

The one who came to welcome Zhang Xiao was Hou Wenyong himself. Zhang Xiao had first met him years ago in Ma Qianzhu's office. Back then, Hou Wenyong had been just a green kid; now he was in his early twenties.

Zhang Xiao found his presence curious. "Strange—Guangzhou is swamped with work right now. Little Hou, shouldn't you be juggling a thousand things as Nanhai's administrator? Why did you come to pick us up?"

Hou Wenyong scratched his head awkwardly. "Chief, Nanhai County isn't under my management anymore. Senator Little Zhang was transferred to serve as Director of the Foshan Economic Development Zone Management Committee. No one could take over her role as Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. Since I had experience in secretarial work, Chief Liu reassigned me to fill her position. The Magistrate of Nanhai County is now Chief Liu himself, in a concurrent role."
