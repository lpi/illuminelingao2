# Chapter 2756: The Capital (Part 108)

The conversation between Qian Taichong and Zhou Lezhi lasted until late at night, after which Mr. Le took his leave. Qian Taichong asked him to stay until dawn before leaving—there was a curfew in the Capital at night, and with no lights on the road, it was very unsafe. Unexpectedly, Mr. Le didn't care at all. When seeing him off at the door, Qian found that under the shadow of the guild hall's screen wall, a small sedan chair and seven or eight servants were waiting—this Mr. Le was obviously not an ordinary scholar.

Returning to his room, the third drum had already been beaten. Qian Taichong blew out the lamp and went to bed to rest. But he was too excited to sleep. He didn't expect such a serendipitous encounter in the world! Originally, he came to the Capital to lobby with a "last fight" mentality, but unexpectedly, by chance and coincidence, he was summoned by the Emperor. Now, an unexpected long talk with "Mr. Le" opened his mind.

That's it! In the current situation, it is out of the question for the Zheng family to "avenge the grievance and snow the hate," and fratricide in Zhangzhou Bay is even less of a way out. The awkward situation where he and Zheng Sen find themselves in a dilemma is, in the final analysis, due to a lack of money.

Only with money can they afford to raise soldiers and purchase Kun guns and cannons, and then protect their current properties, and subsequently talk about other things.

Now with nothing, he could only beg everywhere. He spent a lot of money but with very little effect. If not for this coincidence, this trip to the Capital would probably have been empty-handed.

Thinking of this, he could no longer sleep. He simply got up, lit the candle, spread out paper and ink, and listed the matters he had just pondered one by one.

The first thing was naturally to open a sugar factory. Zheng Sen has many fields under his command, and a considerable part of them grow economic crops like sugarcane and indigo. However, without processing capabilities, the sugarcane was mostly sold to sugar sheds (*tangliao*). In the last two years, "Kun Sugar" had been dumped in large quantities, causing all the sugar sheds to close down. These sugarcanes were mostly sold to traveling merchants who collected sugarcane. As for whom they sold to, it was self-evident—naturally, the Kun people.

The fact that the Kun scoundrels bought Fujian's sugarcane to make sugar was no secret locally. Originally, Fujian was a major sugar-producing province with forests of local sugar sheds. Brown sugar, white sugar, and rock sugar were all produced, and large quantities were shipped for export and domestic sales by sea merchants. Since the arrival of Kun Sugar, under the dumping, the sugar sheds were almost completely wiped out. Utilizing advantages in price and quality, various grades of Kun Sugar filled the entire market like quicksilver pouring onto the ground. Shed owners, merchants, and craftsmen went bankrupt and lost their jobs one after another; only the sugarcane farmers remained unharmed.

If he set up a Kun-method sugar factory himself, there would be no problem with raw materials. It's just that he had neither Kun machines nor Kun craftsmen; these would still have to be provided by the Kun scoundrels. On this point, Qian Taichong originally still had doubts. After all, the two sides were still "enemy states." Logically speaking, it seemed unlikely they would help him. But later, hearing Mr. Le talk about the Kun scoundrels' behavior, and thinking that every family in Zhangzhou Bay was now doing business with the Kun scoundrels, it seemed not impossible.

"Anyway, I still have to try," Qian Taichong thought. Just like his trip to the Capital this time—neither others nor he himself actually had any certainty, yet unexpectedly he was summoned by the Emperor!

Qian Taichong hummed the latest popular Southern Fujian tune "Success Comes From Fighting" (*Ai Pia Cia E Yia*). This tune was introduced with Kun merchants a few years ago. Although Qian Taichong didn't understand why the Kun scoundrels had Southern Fujian tunes, the melody was pleasant and the lyrics inspiring, so it spread as soon as it was introduced. Everyone in the Zheng family naturally hummed a few lines, and even he, an outsider, was no exception.

Xu Ke scrutinized this middle-aged man under heavy guard. A face weathered by wind and frost, with graying beard and hair, made it hard to imagine he was only in his early forties, in the prime of life.

If one saw him on the streets, one would probably really be deceived by him, thinking he was just a *jianghu* loafer wandering the streets every day, using his glib tongue to earn a few small coins to feed himself.

Only when his clothes were stripped off to apply medicine did his body full of lean and powerful sinewy muscles reveal itself.

This kind of muscle was not piled up by fitness enthusiasts using protein powder, but honed through long-term training and beating. Although it looked ordinary, the explosive power and toughness within were far beyond ordinary people. Coupled with scars all over his body, Xu Ke knew that this person's skill was extraordinary. His *jianghu* experience was seasoned. If he hadn't been stabbed first, capturing him would probably have taken some effort.

Such a person had excellent physical quality, appearing weak only due to excessive blood loss. With antibiotics preventing inflammation and over ten days of recuperation, his body improved day by day. To ensure the effect of the interrogation, Xu Ke didn't bring out Liu Sha for questioning until the health worker said his wounds had basically healed and he could sit up and eat some soft food.

Liu Sha's sickroom-cum-cell was set up in a side room. Xu Ke stepped inside. The room was brightly lit, and iron bars were installed additionally on the windows. Liu Sha lay half-reclining on a small bed. Iron rings were chiseled into the wall, fixing his right hand and left foot to them with shackles and chains.

Originally, nylon restraint straps were used to control his hands and feet. Recently, as his health improved and his strength grew, shackles were used instead. The guard by the bed watched covetously, equipped not only with firearms and daggers but also an electric baton in hand, ready to take him down at any time.

Such great trouble was taken because Xu Ke was a very cautious person. Especially when interrogating prisoners in enemy territory, had to be prudent.

Liu Sha not only possessed martial arts but was also the initiator of the heinous crimes committed in Guangzhou. Not to mention how much trouble he had caused the Senate, just instructing bandits in Guangzhou to perform *caisheng zhege* (mutilating live people for sorcery/begging) and practicing witchcraft was enough to make him die without a burial place. Such people knew their sins were grave and mostly would not submit willingly, so one had to guard against his deathbed struggle to bring ruin to both jade and stone.

Liu Sha was originally resting with his eyes closed on the bed. Hearing someone enter, he opened his eyes.

"How is your body?" Xu Ke asked gently.

"Recovering quite well. Australian medicine is indeed effective!" Liu Sha looked normal, as if chattering about family affairs.

"Daoist priest has a strong physique; this small injury is nothing," Xu Ke said. "Recuperate for a few more days, and you will move as usual."

Hearing him use the address "Daoist priest," Liu Sha's expression changed slightly, probably knowing that his hidden documents had been discovered.

"So what if I move as usual?" Liu Sha raised his shackled right hand. "I'm afraid Your Honor will only be at ease after removing one of my hands and one of my feet."

"Not to that extent, not to that extent," Xu Ke laughed. "My Great Song has never engaged in the abuse of captives and prisoners. Since Daoist priest has been captured, whatever the crimes, there will naturally be a judiciary to review and handle them in the future to enforce the law publicly. I am just a detective and inquirer, merely guarding against the unexpected."

Hearing his words, Liu Sha realized the other party clearly knew he was "Daoist Wood-Stone." Given the things he had committed, there was absolutely no reason for leniency. Thinking this way, the stone in his heart landed, and he no longer felt uneasy. He said: "Since Sir already knows my identity. Why treat and save me?"

"Visiting the poor and asking about their suffering, healing the wounded and rescuing the dying, is truly the duty of the Senate. Whether Sir is guilty of terrible crimes is not for us to judge." Xu Ke knew that such people were not afraid of being beaten or killed. If he used only coercion or conciliation, neither would make him submit. Even with severe torture, bringing out the hand-cranked telephone might not be completely effective. He could only use both soft and hard tactics to plan slowly.

"Sir has great righteousness." Liu Sha's words were not without sarcasm. "Saving me is to ask for my words, right?"

"Naturally. Back then, Daoist priest told us a lot about Stone Elder. The Senate is very interested." Xu Ke said, "Sir is a smart man; I don't need to hide anything. This person, Stone Elder, has manipulated things behind the scenes from start to finish. Although it didn't hinder the overall situation, it created a lot of trouble for us. This account must inevitably be settled."

"Since you want to settle the account, why do I need to say more? Anyway, you already know that Stone Elder is Lord Wang."

"Stone Elder might indeed be Wang Yehao, but based on the Senate's understanding of Master Wang, he absolutely does not have such ability. Sir is certainly a capable person who can stand alone and stir up countless waves, but in terms of the big picture, you are still a little short. So we want to know, who is the person devising strategies for Stone Elder?"

The question pointed directly to the vital part. Liu Sha took a deep breath, showing a look of hesitation. Xu Ke knew that he himself had little loyalty left for Stone Elder, otherwise, he wouldn't have played tricks in the kidnapping case and colluded with Little Eunuch Yang.

The hesitation now was nothing more than harboring thoughts of bargaining in his heart.

If it were an ordinary person, as long as his life was promised, there was a high probability he would speak. But Xu Ke dared not promise that. Daoist Wood-Stone was not only the mastermind behind a series of major anti-Senate cases but also committed the Witchcraft Case. No one dared to open this hole.

Without a soft spot, it was indeed hard to manipulate. However, Xu Ke thought again, his mindset at this moment was probably disheartened. As long as he was treated with sincerity, it was possible to let him spit it out quickly.

Thinking of this, he paused for a few minutes. Seeing that he still didn't speak, he planned to test him and said: "Could it be that 'Mr. Le'?"

Liu Sha was stunned. Xu Ke instantly knew from the micro-expression on his face that this probe had hit the mark!

Hitting with the probe meant reducing his chips. It could be seen that this Liu Sha had begun to waver.

After less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, he heard Liu Sha speak: "You know him?"

"Naturally we know. We just don't know his real name." Xu Ke said leisurely, "Actually, we are not interested in what his surname and name are; we just want to understand him as a person."

"Mr. Le is a person of great talent." Liu Sha whispered.

"We also agree with this matter." Xu Ke put on a look of mutual appreciation. "Although we serve different masters, the Senators of my Great Song admire the gentlemen of the Stone Elder group very much. The Imperial Court's army spent millions in grain and pay, yet is not as good as half of you."

Everyone loves to hear flattery, especially when it comes from the mouth of a powerful opponent. Liu Sha was no exception, and a trace of a smile couldn't help but appear at the corner of his mouth. He closed his eyes for a long time, then suddenly opened them and said:

"It isn't difficult for me to tell you, but... I have a condition."

Xu Ke thought to himself: It's done!

"Speak without reservation. As long as it is something I can decide, I can naturally agree on the spot. If it is for the Senate to decide, I will also report it as soon as possible and give you a reply within three days."

"Three days?" Liu Sha was slightly stunned, then suddenly sighed, "That's right, you have the telegraph. Mr. Le said this thing can transmit sound a thousand *li* away in an instant..."
