# Chapter 2762: The Capital (Part 118)

Although this was the case, the main topic today was the Liang family; the Witchcraft Case would have to be put aside for the time being. Judging by Liu Sha's current state, he had completely seen through the vanity of the world and fully resigned himself to his fate, not caring what he said anymore. Xu Ke could even sense that he had a desire to pour his heart out.

People who held too many secrets probably all felt this way. Once the constraints were removed, it was truly a relief to spit it all out.

In this manner, Liu Sha had successively become acquainted with the Guandi Temple group through the "production and sales" channels, and subsequently connected with Sister Qiao Han.

"Speaking of which, this Poor Daoist never imagined back then that I would be involved in such a major affair in the future. Associating with them was merely for some petty benefits."

Heroes of the *jianghu* stressed having friends everywhere; one more friend meant one more path. For a Jinayiwei officer like Liu Sha who wore the official skin, they were naturally willing to spend a small amount of money to patronize him.

"No wonder when we were investigating the case back then, we only felt that this Daoist Wood-Stone had the ability to reach the heavens. It turns out you had already built this network of relationships long ago." Xu Ke seized the opportunity to compliment him. "Indeed, you have a meticulous mind."

"You flatter me, you flatter me." Liu Sha showed a look of self-satisfaction. "If one doesn't have a diamond drill, how would one dare to take on porcelain work?"

"I heard that Liang Cunhou combed *Yue Wan*'s hair. Did you get to know Liang through this line?"

"Not at all," Liu Sha shook his head. "What kind of figure do I count as? Even when Lord Nine Thousand held power over the court and the Eastern Depot and Jinyiwei were at their most glorious, the noble families and gentry still looked down on people like us. Let alone getting to know him from a place of wind and moon."

Liang Cunhou was a son of a noble family. Although combing the hair of a famous courtesan was not a shameful thing, a person like him would not speak pleasantly to the "servants" around him. If Liu Sha had met Liang Cunhou through Yue Wan's relationship, then his status in the other party's heart would just be that of a "servant." However, according to the intelligence gathered, Liang Cunhou regarded Daoist Wood-Stone very highly.

"So, you still relied on Master Wang's relationship?"

"Without Master Wang's introduction, I was just a 'clean guest' who entertains; with Master Wang's introduction, I was a respected 'clean guest.' There wasn't much difference. What really made him look at this Poor Daoist with new eyes was that I recommended capable people to him."

"Oh? I wonder what kind of character could make Young Master Liang hold you in such high regard?"

Liu Sha showed a slight hesitation, but Xu Ke had already roughly guessed it. "I guess it's probably Young Master Liang's martial entourage, isn't it?"

Liu Sha was somewhat surprised; evidently, he had not realized that the Senate had already grasped this intelligence.

"He was also present at the Tieliang Temple meeting. Was he the one called Yun Ting?"

"So that's it. You sent spies in during the meeting back then..." Liu Sha said. "Mr. Zhou said that when it comes to espionage and spies, no one in the world is more formidable than you."

"You flatter me." Xu Ke said, "That Mr. Zhou of yours is also quite capable."

"Indeed, it is this person."

Intelligence regarding Yun Ting had long been on the Political Security Bureau's desk. However, the Senate knew very little about this person. They only roughly knew that he was Liang Cunhou's military leader and controlled quite a few men and horses.

"Let's talk about this Yun Ting." Xu Ke said, "We are quite interested in him."

"Yun Ting is originally his alias; he is secretive about what his original name was. However, I heard people say that his surname is Wu and he is from Chaoshan. He used to be a relay station courier. In his youth, he was addicted to gambling and lost his family fortune, reduced to a beggar. He wandered everywhere begging, his footprints covering the regions of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. This person is strong and physically robust, tall and burly. In the *jianghu*, he is known as the 'Iron Beggar.'"

"Iron Beggar?" Xu Ke faintly felt that this name was very familiar, but he couldn't recall it for a moment. He had to continue listening to him.

"Although he is not a local and was a beggar, he has read books and has quite a strategy in his chest. Although he is an outsider and alone, he became the Second Boss of the Flower Mountain Bandits."

The Flower Mountain Bandits were a group of bandits entrenched in the mountainous area bordering the northern parts of Panyu and Nanhai counties at that time. This place was located to the north of the provincial capital and had been a choke point for north-south traffic since ancient times. To the north were precipitous mountains, and to the south lay a flat plain. One could arrive at Guangzhou Prefecture City in less than a day's journey. If one stood atop the mountains hundreds of *zhang* high and looked down, the carriages, horses, and ships traveling between the prefectural city and Qingyuan and Conghua were clearly visible.

Since it was a vital communication line, there were bound to be bandits entrenched there, collecting "road toll money." Since the Yuan Dynasty, mountain bandits had relied on the precipitous terrain to come out and plunder. Starting from the early Wanli reign when Yang Yanming entrenched himself here as a bandit, their looting and robbing reached as far as the Zengcheng area. By the end of the Ming Dynasty, this place became even more chaotic. In the second year of the Chongzhen reign, the mountain bandit Zhong Guorang looted five counties. Government troops suppressed them repeatedly, but they rose again as soon as they were suppressed; they could never be completely exterminated.

Shortly after the Mainland Campaign began, the First Fleet occupied Guangzhou. This bandit nest, less than a day's journey from the prefectural city, naturally received the "focused attention" of the First Fleet and was soon subjected to a heavy siege. Bei Wei, the Commander of the Guangdong Region Security and Captain of the National Army Guangdong Regional Detachment, personally commanded a force of over six thousand men, centering on the National Army Guangdong Detachment's First Mobile Corps, the Korean Company, and the Reconnaissance Bureau's Special Reconnaissance Platoon, along with five other National Army companies mobilized for the purpose, to encircle and suppress this area.

After eliminating the bandits in Timian, Bei Wei and Liu Xiang consulted and decided that although conditions were not yet ripe to establish a Huaxian County administration according to the regulations of the Qing Dynasty, stationing troops was essential. After all, this was the northern gate of Guangzhou, less than a day's journey away. It was not only a vital passage for traveling merchants but also an important transport route for Joint Logistics to supply materials to Lianyang. Therefore, following the established rules, a company of the National Army was stationed in each of the three places: Shuixi, Sudong, and Bainhe, to maintain a suppressive posture over the local area.

Xu Ke naturally knew all these circumstances, so when he heard that Yun Ting had become the Second Boss of the Flower Mountain Bandits, he was quite puzzled and asked:

"Flower Mountain Bandits? Weren't they already wiped out by the First Fleet?"

Liu Sha let out a "chi" laugh and said, "Just because you say wiped out, they are wiped out? The Great Ming wiped out the Flower Mountain Bandits so many times, yet didn't they rise again as soon as they were exterminated? Could it be you think the Flower Mountain Bandits are all gathered in the mountain stronghold?"

Xu Ke nodded and said, "That's right, they are mostly bandit households in the mountainous areas."

"Exactly." Liu Sha said, "Whether it is the Great Ming or you people, could it be you will kill all the local commoners? Even if you were that decisive, in Huizhou, Qingyuan, Conghua, and other places, there would still be a steady stream of people willing to become bandits in that area..."

"As long as the local area remains a vital communication line."

Liu Sha laughed, "Places the Great Ming couldn't govern, you people can't govern either with your Australian guns and cannons. Lord Hongwu, Emperor Chengzu... how many capable sages, able ministers, and good generals has the Great Ming had in past dynasties? Yet they still couldn't govern the Flower Mountain Bandits, and you will be the same."

"Whether we can govern it or not, the future will naturally make it clear." Xu Ke smiled faintly. "Let's not talk about this. He became the Second Boss, but how did you get to know him?"

"I met him when he was begging in Zhejiang back then. We could be considered to appreciate each other." Liu Sha sighed, "I don't praise people easily in my life, but although this Yun Ting comes from a humble background, he possesses great talent and bold strategy. Given the opportunity of wind and clouds meeting, becoming a general or a minister would not be difficult for him."

This praise made Xu Ke take it seriously. In his conversation, Liu Sha rarely had words of praise for the people involved. This remark was unexpected, and adding what he said earlier, Liang Cunhou also valued this person very highly.

With the insight of Liu and Liang, this Second Boss Yun was definitely not an ordinary person.

"How many people do the Flower Mountain Bandits have now?"

"As for exactly how many people, this Poor Daoist does not know either. However, Second Boss Yun said it would not be fewer than three thousand."

"Three thousand people, what a tone you have." Xu Ke couldn't believe it. "How much provisions and pay would this require?"

"Government troops fighting wars need provisions and pay. Flower Mountain Bandits are bandits; what provisions and pay do they need?" Liu Sha sneered. "Heading all the way south, they just need to loot."

Xu Ke thought to himself, *If they really take advantage of the situation to rise up, three companies of the National Army really might not be able to suppress a force of three thousand.* Moreover, Huaxian was practically within a stone's throw of Guangzhou City. There were not many main forces around Guangzhou either: the First Fleet was all at the front lines, and the main force of the National Army was busy with mopping-up operations in various counties. The few garrison troops were all National Army units reorganized from surrendered Ming troops not long ago, and their combat effectiveness was worrying. The only reliable armed forces were the naval units at Huangpu Port and the Hong Kong base.

According to the intelligence they grasped, this Daoist Wood-Stone before him had also roped in many religious sects and secret societies in the counties surrounding Guangzhou. Once the Flower Mountain Bandits came down from the mountains, these religious sects would inevitably rise in response. The result can be imagined.

In the early stage of the Mainland Campaign, Xu Ke still had fresh memories of the tragic state of beacon fires everywhere caused by Xiong Wencan letting soldiers turn into bandits. If this happened again, although the bandits might not necessarily be able to capture Guangzhou City, such a disturbance would be enough to smash the surroundings of Guangzhou to pieces, destroying the social order that had just been established, and killing many "activists" and cadres of the Northbound Detachment.

"Liang Cunhou would also accept such a plan wherein jade and stone are burned together? Is that not strange? And this Iron Beggar of yours, could it be he thinks he can conquer Guangzhou with three thousand Flower Mountain Bandits and get the Great Ming to grant him an official title and nobility?"

"Young Master Liang has long put life and death aside. As for Yun Ting, he didn't plan to conquer Guangzhou. However, looting along the way would probably yield a rich harvest. When the time comes, they will just retreat back into the mountains." Liu Sha said, "He said: if they set up a battle formation to fight, whether government troops or Flower Mountain Bandits, they are bound to be defeated. But if they avoid your sharp edge and just burn, kill, and loot, it is enough to hurt the Australians' sinews and bones. As long as the surroundings of Guangzhou cannot be pacified, over time, the Australian thieves naturally won't be able to stay." Liu Sha said, "On this point, he actually happens to hold the same view as Mr. Zhou; what they want is just the word 'Chaos'!"

"I didn't expect this Liang Cunhou to be so vicious, to come up with such a ruthless plan to cut off off our foundation."

"If not so, how could they shake you?"

A sense of urgency suddenly arose in Xu Ke's heart. Because the investigation into Liang Cunhou's forces in Guangzhou had not made any effective progress, and judging from the news Liu Sha had revealed so far, the scale of this riot was large and the goal was clear. Once launched, it was bound to cause serious destruction to the Pearl River Delta region.

Fortunately, this key figure, Liu Sha, had already fallen into their hands. Leaving aside other things, just as a witness to testify against Liang Cunhou, he had enormous utility.

"Where is this Yun Ting now?"

"He and this Poor Daoist also maintain single-line contact, through a person named Qiao Yan."
