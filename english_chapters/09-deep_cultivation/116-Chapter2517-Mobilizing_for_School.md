# Chapter 2517: Mobilizing for School

"Indeed, set your mind at ease. Following the Senate will always lead to good days," Hou Qing continued. "I heard that the Chiefs plan to promote fish farming techniques in Guangzhou Prefecture, adapting to local conditions. Although you've gone ashore, you can't compare to those who have farmed the land for generations; learning to till the fields now would be a difficult task for you. As for fish farming, however, it shouldn't be too hard for you to pick up."

He Lizhi stroked his chin, appearing somewhat concerned. "Chiefs may not know, but fish farming is no simple matter. The fish fry for the entire Canton Prefecture are all scooped from the river [West River]. Moreover, the knacks for catching fish fry are known only to the villagers of Jiujiang, who have monopolized it for hundreds of years. If the Chiefs want to promote fish farming, I'm afraid the cooperation of the Jiujiang people is indispensable."

Principal Tian said, "The Chiefs do everything better than others; perhaps they have other methods."

"What methods?"

"I don't know..." Principal Tian replied. His mind was still on student recruitment. Regardless, this...

Hou Qing looked at He Lizhi, and He Lizhi said, "I'll think of a way. Let's go to Sister-in-law Zhou's house and have a look."

When the three left the construction site of the latrines, they found many villagers and children surrounding Zeng Guiyu and a stranger, who seemed to be writing something.

"Wow, it's so beautiful!" a child cried out, and the onlookers also let out bursts of admiration.

"Do you know how to read? You just say it's beautiful," a villager beside him jeered.

"Why wouldn't I know?" the child argued. "Winter goes, spring comes... something east south west north something something... bitterness something something... something river celebration something life..."

"Hahahaha..." The crowd roared with laughter.

"It is 'Winter goes, spring comes, joy in the east, south, west, and north as we bid farewell to the old year. A magnificent land. Bitterness ends, sweetness arrives, gazing at lakes, seas, and rivers to celebrate a new life,'" another child read out.

"Can you teach me to write?" a child asked.

"Sir, please write a pair for me too..." another villager requested. "I moved into a new house and want to paste a couplet on the door!"

Kuang Lu was in a not-unpleasant mood today. After the fatigue of travel these past days, he hadn't had a chance to touch a brush. Although the brush, ink, and paper brought here were coarse, they were sufficient to practice his strokes. He immediately bantered, "My calligraphy isn't given for free. Exchange it for salted fish—one fish for a pair of couplets."

"We don't have much else, but we have plenty of salted fish." Hearing this, everyone went to fetch dried and salted fish. Kuang Lu didn't mind; he just spread ink on the red paper. Writing couplets was a basic skill for a scholar, and the phrases were all ready-made. He knew that most people here were illiterate, and the Kun thieves' learning was also quite limited. If he used deep allusions or essays, they wouldn't understand, and if someone intentionally looked for faults in the text to pick a quarrel, it would only bring him trouble. So he used common, cliché auspicious words.

Hou Qing and Tian Liang looked at each other. The stranger's attire and temperament, and especially that hand of beautiful standard script, were better than anyone they had ever seen. Without the guidance of a famous teacher and bitter practice from a young age, it would be impossible to write like that. Anyone with a discerning eye could tell at a glance that this person must be a young master from a noble family. Why would he come to a fishing village to write couplets?

Thinking of himself as the principal of the Nanhai National Demonstration School, who not only frequently wrote wrong characters but also wrote them crookedly, Tian Liang felt too embarrassed to show his hand. His face suddenly flushed red.

Hou Qing noticed it inadvertently and asked with concern, "Ah Liang, why is your face so red? Do you have a fever?" As she spoke, she reached out to touch Tian Liang's forehead.

"No, I'm not sick..." Tian Liang answered flusteredly, but his face turned even redder.

He Lizhi had already found Sister-in-law Zhou to discuss her eldest son's schooling. As they spoke, Sister-in-law Zhou began to cry. "I know this is ruining his future, but if I let him go, what will he eat? There are three younger siblings at home, and they need to eat too! This is just our fate!"

Tian Liang and Hou Qing knew that Sister-in-law Zhou was speaking the truth, but at this moment, apart from begging the villagers, they could think of no other way.

He Lizhi whispered with Zeng Guiyu for a while, then walked into the middle of the crowd, cleared his throat, and said, "Fellow elders and villagers, the village is very lively today. The Chiefs sent people to help us build public toilets. Sister-in-law Zhou's boy tested the best and can go to the school run by the Chiefs to study. This is a big event for our village. But everyone knows the situation in Sister-in-law Zhou's family. Everyone, speak your thoughts."

"Lizhi, why do I feel that reading books is useless?" a villager replied.

"Yeah, the Chiefs exempted our fish tax and allowed us to go ashore. That's enough."

...

The crowd spoke one after another, but no one expressed any willingness to help Sister-in-law Zhou's family.

He Lizhi felt he had lost face and glanced carefully at Hou Qing and Tian Liang.

At this time, Tian Liang had calmed his emotions. He decided to ask for advice from the noble young master before him. "This gentleman, you write such a good hand; you must be a scholar. I am a soldier and not very good at talking. Could you please speak about the benefits of reading?"

Tian Liang's action surprised Kuang Lu. He hadn't expected this fake Kun to ask for his advice. He had roughly understood the situation: the Kun thieves recruited students regardless of background, which actually fit Confucius's principle of "education for all without discrimination."

It was just that since ancient times, reading had not been something the poor could afford. A family needed at least ten *mu* of fertile land to support a scholar. As the saying goes, "Poverty breeds wicked schemes; wealth nutures a conscience." These villagers were originally Tanka people drifting on the water, already struggling for a living. There was not much friendship between them; they became fellow villagers only because the Kun thieves allowed them to go ashore and build houses. Expecting them to help each other at this time was unlikely. High-sounding principles like "ordaining conscience for Heaven and Earth, securing life and fortune for the people, continuing lost teachings for past sages, and establishing peace for all future generations" would serve no purpose even if spoken to the heavens.

Kuang Lu straightened his clothes and said, "Reading, well, has many benefits. You can become an official, you can become a clerk, you can be an apprentice in a shop, and at the very least, you can teach young children in the countryside and scrape by with enough food and clothing. Isn't that easier than scratching for food in the water or mud? For example, everyone sees that my spring couplet calligraphy is beautiful, so you all want a pair. In this short moment, I've also earned dozens of salted fish. This is in the countryside; if it were in Guangzhou City, unless for close friends or relatives, without a few taels of silver as a writing fee, you absolutely couldn't get one."

The villagers laughed again upon hearing this. This man talked big—a few taels of silver for a pair of spring couplets!

Seeing these unruly people didn't believe it at all, Kuang Yan, bent on defending his young master, shouted loudly, "Truly, summer insects cannot speak of ice! My young master is from the Kuang clan of Dali, a family of scholars for generations. My young master's calligraphy and painting are things even Master Autumn Waves [Qiu Tao] couldn't put down, sighing that he was inferior. What the hell do you know!"

"So arrogant! Who is Master Autumn Waves?" someone asked.

"He is the Vice Minister of Rites, Master Chen Jisheng [Chen Zizhuang]!" Kuang Yan said.

Now no one spoke. Everyone showed fear on their faces and dared not say a word.

Although the bottom-tier commoners didn't have much knowledge, they knew a thing or two about the top gentry in the local area. Chen Zizhuang's paternal and maternal families were both prominent in Nanhai, with clan members serving as officials for generations. He himself had passed the imperial examination as *Tanhua* (Third Place), rising to the rank of Right Vice Minister of Rites and Academician Reader-in-Waiting, lecturing the Chongzhen Emperor daily. His reputation was extremely high. Another example was Li Daiwen of Foshan, who rose to Right Vice Minister of Revenue, establishing the Li clan as the undisputed premier family of Foshan Fort.

The silent atmosphere was a bit awkward. Tian Liang was already clumsy of speech and inarticulate. Facing this situation, he immediately felt at a loss. Fortunately, Hou Qing helped him out of the predicament.

Hou Qing's volume wasn't high, but it had a unique penetrating power characteristic of women. "Folks, the Great Song Chiefs are better at everything than others; that is the result of reading many books. The Chiefs sent literacy teams to teach everyone to read and admit your children to school because they hope you will live better lives and no longer be bullied. In a while, the Chiefs will send agricultural technicians down to teach everyone how to raise fish. Don't laugh—without reading books, you won't even raise fish as well as the Chiefs. Since Sister-in-law Zhou's child has this opportunity to go to school, he represents the hope of our whole village. Distant relatives are not as good as close neighbors. Everyone has suffered through hard times; let's support each other."

The crowd remained silent. Kuang Lu secretly found it funny. He thought, *Your intentions are good, but this is asking a tiger for its skin. The Tanka have no clan system; this temporarily formed village is just a mob of rabble. Who will respond to a few calls from the village elders?* He also felt it was a pity for the child not to go to school—even if it was an Australian school. He immediately said, "These dozens of catties of salted fish will count as my donation. Sell them to provide living expenses for this Sister-in-law Zhou's eldest son."

With him taking the lead, Zeng Guiyu felt his face had been saved and immediately responded, "Everyone look! The guest has helped Sister-in-law Zhou; we are all of the Tanka lineage, we must show something! I'll state my position first: although I don't have money, if there is anything useful needed, I will definitely contribute my effort."

Immediately, someone else said, "Doctor Hou saved my life; whatever she says goes. I really can't bring out anything either! You say how I can help? Count me in for physical labor!"

"Count me in!" several more people responded.

He Lizhi also struck while the iron was hot, saying, "I see that there are a total of eighty-five households in our village. Regardless of size, each household will contribute five catties of fish per month. The village will collect them and sell them in the town, and the money obtained will count as the living allowance subsidy for her eldest son. In the future, when her eldest son has success, let him repay everyone. What do you think?"

Five catties of fish per month wasn't a large amount; everyone felt it was acceptable and expressed their agreement. Sister-in-law Zhou thanked them excessively and specifically brought her child to kowtow to Kuang Lu.

Kuang Lu raised his hand slightly and said, "No need to kowtow. I only hope that he studies hard in the future and does not forget to repay the village elders who helped him here!"

After speaking, he greeted Zeng Guiyu and was about to leave, but was stopped by Tian Liang. Kuang Lu became vigilant, thinking his identity was exposed and this simple-minded fake Kun wanted to harm him.

Who would have thought that Tian Liang would say to him naively, "Mr. Kuang's handwriting is truly good; you must have read many books. I am Tian Liang, the principal of the Nanhai National Demonstration School. Our school has just been prepared, and there is still a shortage of teachers. We are currently recruiting suitable teachers. If you could come to the school to teach the children to write, it would definitely make our school better."
