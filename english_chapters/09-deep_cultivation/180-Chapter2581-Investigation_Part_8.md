# Chapter 2581 - Investigation (Part 8)

Yuan Shuzhi feigned surprise. "Boatman, how do you know someone will want to drown themselves?"

The boatman's expression turned contemptuous. "I've seen plenty on this river. These fools all think money falls from the sky! Tsk tsk—they spend two dollars on worthless paper, then want to throw themselves overboard when they can't stomach the loss."

"Worthless paper? So you mean..."

"That's right, you've figured it out." The boatwoman laughed. "Among everyone on this boat, you're the only one with any worldly experience. You didn't fall for their trick."

"I'm flattered. Years of running around for a living have taught me a thing or two about the world's treacheries." Yuan Shuzhi wanted to draw out more information, so he added deliberately, "I take it this isn't the first time."

"Far from it." The boatman nodded. "Happens every week or two. Regular passengers on this route have learned to ignore it, but there are always newcomers each trip. Once greed takes hold, they walk right into the trap."

"They're so brazen—aren't they afraid someone will report them to the authorities?"

"Report them—and then what? This region is nothing but river channels and waterways. They can hop on and off boats anywhere they please. Where would the police even begin to look?" The boatman lit his dry tobacco pipe. "The marks just have to accept their bad luck. The ones who've lost their life savings, or their medicine money, and can't cope—those are the ones who want to drown themselves."

Yuan Shuzhi wasn't surprised. Similar scams were everywhere. Even in Guangzhou, now Australian territory, with the "New Life Movement" and "vagrant sweeps" and major "public order rectification" campaigns, various swindles still flourished. Even senior naturalized citizen cadres from Lingao had been deceived.

As they chatted, those who'd gone for a "meal break" began returning one by one. Some were deathly pale and dejected; some burst into curses of "may they die miserably" the moment they stepped aboard; others stomped their feet and beat their chests, berating themselves for "losing their minds." Yuan Shuzhi watched them and sighed inwardly.

Across from him sat a young man who'd also bought counterfeit money. Since returning from the dock, he'd sat hunched over on the wooden plank with his head in his hands. He'd maintained this position until now, but then suddenly straightened. Yuan Shuzhi noticed his vacant eyes, his dazed expression—something was wrong. The young man was losing his grip on sanity.

Sure enough, moments later he leaped from his seat. His head struck the canopy with a loud bang, startling everyone. But he was completely oblivious, jumping around the cabin and babbling: "I'm rich! I'm rich! I have plenty of money!" He cackled madly while throwing counterfeit bills in every direction.

Yuan Shuzhi knew the man had just spent ten yuan buying five counterfeit notes. Ten yuan was no small sum—anyone would be distraught.

---

The young man's shouting threw the cabin into chaos. When he headed toward the stern, raving about "going to the Dragon Palace to seek treasure" and clearly about to jump into the river, the boatwoman rushed over with two boat hands. With considerable difficulty, they restrained him and lashed him to the stern with rope.

An old man nearby shook his head. "What a sin! He boarded with me—that ten yuan was given by his family to buy life-saving medicine in Huizhou."

Yuan Shuzhi had only been watching the commotion, but this offhand remark caught his attention. He remembered that Elder Zheng had transferred him to Huizhou to investigate the fake medicine case. This man was also going to Huizhou for medicine—could there be a connection?

He affected ignorance. "Going to Huizhou for medicine? Can't he buy it locally? Besides, Guangzhou is nearby—it's a major city where any medicine can be found. Why travel all the way to Huizhou?"

The old man sized him up. Noting his "Ming-Baldy hybrid" attire and unable to place his background, he replied politely, "And you are?"

"I'm an accountant. Lost my job in Guangzhou, and a friend recommended me to Huizhou to find work."

"I see." The old man lowered his voice. "So you're Cantonese! You probably haven't heard—starting last year, the Huizhou medicine market—you know about the Luofu Mountain medicine market?"

"Yes, of course—one of the four great markets under heaven. How could I not?"

"Well then. Starting last year, that market began carrying miracle drugs. All the kind that take effect immediately after a single dose. Especially for festering wounds, persistent fevers, and chronic coughs—proven effective every time. Almost as good as Australian miracle drugs, but far cheaper..."

Yuan Shuzhi already knew the case details from materials Zheng Mingjiang had provided. "Could you be referring to something like Lushi Powder? But that medicine is also sold in Guangzhou—it's not hard to obtain. Why go to Huizhou?"

"Ah, so you know that one? Well then. Actually, there's more than just Lushi Powder. Though it's sold in Guangzhou, it's not nearly as cheap as at the Huizhou market. So some people are willing to make the extra journey."

"I see." Yuan Shuzhi nodded and sighed. "That ten yuan was probably the family's savings. Now swindled clean—and worse, whoever's sick at home is probably in grave danger. No wonder he couldn't accept it."

"Exactly, sir. But once human greed rises, not even mountains of knives and seas of fire can hold people back." The old man sighed. "He's gone mad on the boat—who knows if he'll ever recover. Most likely he'll wander about crazed, not knowing where home is, and drift homeless. His family will be heartbroken."

The night passed without incident. When Yuan Shuzhi woke the next morning, the crazed young man was gone. According to the old man beside him, he'd been making too much noise in the middle of the night, so the boatman put him ashore to fend for himself—as long as he didn't die on the boat.

The boat traveled another ten-plus li. With favorable wind they hoisted sails; without it they poled. In some stretches, the boat hands even had to wade down into the shallows and haul tow-ropes—traveling east all the way. By noon, they reached a bend where the current slowed and the river widened. A tributary joined the East River here, and this river valley flatland hosted a considerable settlement—a fairly large rural market with two wine houses and several tea stands. Many passenger and cargo boats stopped here to load and unload.

The boatman also moored here for a break, letting passengers go ashore to stretch their legs.

This was already beyond Yuan Shuzhi's usual range. After a day and night on the boat, his limbs had gone stiff. He took the opportunity to walk around and loosen up.

The market backed against the river with convenient transportation. Agricultural products from the surrounding countryside and goods from all directions were distributed here, lending it considerable prosperity. Today was also market day, with people and merchants from everywhere coming to trade—the place was bustling.

He'd walked only a short distance when he noticed a crowd gathered by the dock, someone vaguely shouting. They seemed to be hawking something.

On a whim, Yuan Shuzhi walked over.

The berth was packed three layers deep. Protecting his satchel, he carefully squeezed through to find a cargo boat moored at the shore. Under the canopy sat a coffin. On the dock were stacked over a dozen wooden crates, all conspicuously stamped with the Zicheng Ji trademark and the "Peerless Patriot" brand.

By the dock lay a straw mat, on which knelt a woman and three children of varying ages, all dressed in heavy mourning and weeping piteously. Only one middle-aged man wearing a white mourning band stood apart, explaining the situation while hawking the goods.

Yuan Shuzhi listened and pieced together the story: a northern merchant residing in Guangzhou had purchased a shipment of "Peerless Patriot" from Guangzhou's Purple Record, intending to transport it north for sale while sending his children back to his hometown. Unfortunately, he'd fallen suddenly ill here and died, leaving behind orphans, a widow, and a boatload of merchandise.

Before dying, the merchant had instructed his manager to sell the wine at a discount right here. With the proceeds, he could send the wife, children, and coffin home.

"...Everyone, please show some compassion and take pity on these orphans and their widowed mother. Stranded far from home, they still have to escort the coffin back. Such hardship! If any wine lovers would buy a crate, you'd get a wonderful deal and accumulate merit. Our master's spirit in heaven will be eternally grateful..."

The manager spoke with passion, tears streaming down his face. Combined with the wailing of the orphans and widow on the straw mat, onlookers sighed in sympathy. Some immediately wanted to buy wine to help.

Yuan Shuzhi observed that all the wine on display was high-quality Peerless Patriot, with authentic Zicheng Ji stamps on the crates. He couldn't help feeling tempted himself. Then he heard the manager explain that beyond Guangdong's borders, Ming territory didn't accept Australian paper notes—if they collected a pile of those, they'd have to return to the city to exchange them for silver. So they only accepted silver dollars, all at a discount price of one yuan per bottle. Additionally, to sell out quickly and be on their way, the wine wasn't sold by the bottle—minimum purchase was one crate of six bottles.

Though it was a "tearful clearance sale," one yuan per bottle still exceeded many people's purchasing power. Add the minimum one-crate requirement, and the price was more than ordinary folks could bear. Many who'd been eager to try drifted away immediately.

Seeing no buyers, the manager had an assistant open a crate and take out two bottles of wine, along with several gourd ladles.

"This is all Peerless Patriot that our master bought from Zicheng Ji! If you drank this at a wine house, you couldn't dream of it for less than five or six dollars. Don't believe me? Come taste a sip—you'll know in an instant whether it's genuine."

Everyone was murmuring among themselves when several people hurried over, pushed through the crowd, and called out: "Let me see first—save two crates for me!"

Yuan Shuzhi was jostled into the inner layer. He overheard people nearby saying that the newcomers appeared to be managers from some local wine house.

This wine house manager didn't drink from the already-opened bottles. After a brief exchange with the manager, he had them open another crate, took out a fresh bottle, tasted from a ladle, and nodded approvingly. His assistant immediately produced twelve gleaming silver dollars and handed them over.

The manager was delighted. He accepted the money with a deep bow and thanked him profusely. The wine house manager replied, "These orphans and their widowed mother, stranded so far from home—truly difficult." With that, he had his assistant take out a dollar, wrap it in white paper, and present it to the woman in mourning clothes.

"Consider this my condolence gift. Escort the coffin home safely and raise the children well." After speaking, he had his assistant carry the wine and departed through the crowd. The onlookers praised him, all agreeing that a good man had come.
