# Chapter 2581 - Investigation (Part 8)

Yuan Shuzhi feigned surprise: "Boatman, how do you know someone will want to drown themselves?"

The boatman showed a contemptuous expression: "I've seen a lot on this river. These people all think money falls from the sky! Tsk tsk—spending two dollars to buy a piece of waste paper, then wanting to drown when they can't get over it."

"Waste paper? So you mean..."

"That's right, you've guessed correctly, sir." The boatwoman laughed. "Among all the passengers on this boat, you're the only one who's seen the world. You didn't fall for their trick!"

"I'm embarrassed. These years, running around for a living, I've more or less seen some of the world's treacheries." Yuan Shuzhi wanted to draw out more information, so he deliberately said: "Presumably this isn't the first time."

"Exactly." The boatman nodded. "This happens every week or two. Repeat passengers on this boat all ignore it, but there are always new passengers every trip. Once greed takes hold, they fall into their trap."

"They're so brazen—aren't they afraid someone will report them to the authorities?"

"Report them—so what? This place is full of river channels and waterways. They can get on and off boats anytime. Where would the police catch them?" The boatman lit his dry tobacco pipe. "They just accept their bad luck! Those who lost their life savings, or medicine money, and can't get over it—they want to drown themselves."

Yuan Shuzhi wasn't surprised. Similar scams were everywhere. Even in Guangzhou city, now Australian territory, with the "New Life Movement" and "vagrant sweeps" and major "public order rectification," various scams still emerged endlessly. Even senior naturalized citizen cadres from Lingao had been deceived.

While they chatted idly, those who'd gone for a "meal break" began returning one by one. Some were deathly pale and dejected; some started loudly cursing "may they die miserably" the moment they returned; others stomped their feet and beat their chests, cursing themselves for "losing their minds." Yuan Shuzhi watched, secretly sighing.

Sitting across from him was a young man who'd also bought counterfeit money. After returning from the dock, he'd sat on the wooden plank with his head in his hands. He'd maintained this position until now, but then suddenly sat up straight. Yuan Shuzhi saw his eyes were vacant, his expression dazed—sensing something bad. He was about to lose his mind.

Sure enough, moments later, the young man suddenly leaped up from his seat, his head striking heavily against the canopy with a loud bang. Everyone was startled.

But the man was completely oblivious, jumping around in the boat cabin, babbling incoherently: "I'm rich! I'm rich! I have plenty of money!" With that, he cackled madly while throwing counterfeit bills everywhere.

Yuan Shuzhi knew this man had just spent ten yuan buying five counterfeit notes. Ten yuan was no small sum—anyone would be distraught.

---

The young man shouted and screamed in the cabin, causing chaos. Seeing him heading toward the stern, still shouting about "going to the Dragon Palace to seek treasure," about to jump into the river, the boatwoman rushed over with two boat hands. With great difficulty, they restrained him and tied him to the stern with rope.

An old man nearby said: "Truly a sin! He boarded with me—that ten yuan was given by his family to buy life-saving medicine in Huizhou!"

Yuan Shuzhi had originally just been watching the excitement, but the old man's offhand remark piqued his interest. He remembered Elder Zheng had transferred him to Huizhou to investigate the fake medicine case. This person was also going to Huizhou to buy medicine—could there be some connection?

He pretended ignorance: "Going to Huizhou to buy medicine? Can't he buy it locally? Besides, Guangzhou is close by—it's a big place where any medicine can be bought. Why go all the way to Huizhou?"

The old man sized up Yuan Shuzhi. Seeing his "Ming-Baldy hybrid" attire, unable to figure out his background, he said politely: "And you are?"

"I'm an accountant." Yuan Shuzhi said. "Lost my job in Guangzhou, and a friend recommended me to Huizhou to find work."

"I see." The old man said quietly. "So you're a Cantonese! You probably don't know—starting last year, the Huizhou medicine market—you know about the Luofu Mountain medicine market?"

"Yes, yes—one of the four great markets under heaven. How could I not know!"

"That's it then. Starting last year, this medicine market began having lots of miracle drugs. All the kind that take effect immediately after one dose. Especially for festering wounds, persistent fevers, and chronic coughs—proven effective every time. Almost as good as Australian miracle drugs, but much cheaper than those..."

Yuan Shuzhi already knew the case details from materials provided by Zheng Mingjiang, so he said: "Could it be something like Lushi Powder? But this medicine is also sold in Guangzhou—it's not hard to get. Why go to Huizhou to buy it?"

"Sir knows this medicine? That's it then. Actually, there's more than just Lushi Powder. Though it's sold in Guangzhou, it's not as cheap as at the Huizhou medicine market. So some people are willing to go the extra distance."

"I see." Yuan Shuzhi nodded and sighed: "This ten yuan was probably the family's savings. Now swindled clean—not only that, but the sick person at home is probably in grave danger. No wonder he couldn't accept it."

"Isn't that so, sir? But once human greed rises, even mountains of knives and seas of fire can't stop them." The old man sighed. "He's gone mad on the boat—who knows if he'll recover later. Most likely he'll wander about crazed, not knowing where home is, and drift homeless! His family will be heartbroken."

The night passed without incident. The next morning when Yuan Shuzhi woke, the crazed young man was gone. According to the old man beside him, he'd been making too much noise in the middle of the night, so the boatman put him ashore to fend for himself—as long as he didn't die on the boat.

The boat traveled another ten-plus li. With wind they hoisted sails; without wind they poled. In some places, the boat hands even had to go down and pull tow-ropes—traveling east all the way. By noon, they reached a bend in the river where the current slowed and the river widened. A tributary joined the East River here. This was a river valley flatland with a considerable settlement, forming a fairly large rural market with two wine houses and several tea stands. Many passenger and cargo boats stopped here to load and unload passengers and goods.

The boatman also stopped here for a break, letting passengers go ashore to stretch their legs.

This was already beyond Yuan Shuzhi's usual roaming range. After a day and night on the boat, his limbs felt stiff. He took advantage of the break to go ashore and walk around to loosen up.

This market backed against the river with convenient transportation. Agricultural products from the surrounding countryside and goods from all directions were distributed here, making it very prosperous. Today was also a market day, with people and merchants from everywhere coming to the fair—the market was very lively.

Having walked only a short distance, he saw many people gathered by the dock, with someone vaguely shouting. They seemed to be hawking something.

On a whim, Yuan Shuzhi walked over.

The berth was packed three layers deep. Yuan Shuzhi protected his satchel and carefully squeezed through, only to see a cargo boat moored at the shore. Under the boat canopy sat a coffin. On the dock were piled a dozen-plus wooden crates, all conspicuously stamped with the Zicheng Ji trademark and the "Peerless Patriot" brand.

By the dock was a straw mat, on which knelt a woman and three children of different ages, all in heavy mourning, crying piteously nearby. Only one middle-aged man wearing a white mourning band was explaining and hawking.

Yuan Shuzhi listened to his pitch and understood: originally a northern merchant residing in Guangzhou had bought a shipment of "Peerless Patriot" from Guangzhou's Purple Record, planning to transport it north for sale while sending his children back to his hometown. Unfortunately, he'd suddenly fallen ill here and died, leaving behind orphans, a widow, and a boatload of goods.

Before dying, the merchant had instructed his manager to sell the wine at a discount right here. With the money, he could send the wife, children, and coffin home.

"...Everyone, please do a good deed and take pity on these orphans and widow. Stranded far from home, they still have to escort the coffin back. It's so difficult. If any wine lovers would buy a crate, you'd get a great deal and accumulate merit. Our master's spirit in heaven will be eternally grateful..."

The manager spoke with passion, tears streaming down his face. Combined with the orphans and widow wailing on the straw mat, onlookers sighed in sympathy. Some immediately wanted to buy wine to help.

Yuan Shuzhi saw that all the wine sold at the berth was high-quality Peerless Patriot, with Zicheng Ji stamps on the crates. He couldn't help being tempted. Then he heard the manager explain that beyond Guangdong's borders, Ming territory didn't accept Australian paper notes. If they collected a pile of paper notes, they'd have to go back to the city to exchange them for silver. So they only accepted silver dollars, all at a discount price of one yuan per bottle. Additionally, to sell out quickly and leave, the wine wasn't sold by the bottle—minimum one crate of six bottles.

Though it was a "tearful clearance sale," one yuan per bottle still exceeded many people's purchasing power. Add the minimum one-crate requirement, and the price was even more than ordinary people could bear. Many who'd been eager to try left immediately.

Seeing no buyers, the manager had an assistant open a crate, took out two bottles of wine, and brought out several gourd ladles. He said:

"This is all Peerless Patriot that our master bought from Zicheng Ji! If you drank it at a wine house, you couldn't think about it without five or six dollars. If you don't believe it, come taste a sip and you'll know if it's real or fake!"

Everyone was discussing among themselves when several people hurried over, pushed through the crowd, and called out: "Let me see first—save two crates for me!"

Yuan Shuzhi was pushed and jostled into the inner layer. He heard people nearby chatting, saying these seemed to be some manager of some local wine house.

This wine house manager didn't drink from the opened bottles. After a few words with the manager, they opened another crate, took out a bottle, tasted it from a ladle, and nodded. His assistant immediately produced twelve gleaming silver dollars and handed them to the manager.

The manager was delighted, accepted the money with a deep bow, and thanked him repeatedly. The manager said: "These orphans and widow, stranded far from home—it's really hard!" With that, he had his assistant take out a dollar, wrap it in white paper, and hand it to the woman in mourning clothes.

"Consider this my condolence gift. Escort the coffin home and raise the children well." After speaking, he had his assistant carry the wine and left through the crowd. The crowd praised him, all saying a good person had come.
