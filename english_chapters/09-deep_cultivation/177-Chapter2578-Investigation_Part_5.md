# Chapter 2578 - Investigation (Part 5)

After Yuan Shuzhi passed the sanitation management position examination, following a period of training, he entered the Municipal Comprehensive Governance Bureau.

This Municipal Comprehensive Governance Bureau was roughly a combined entity of the old timeline's sanitation, greening, municipal works, transportation... and many other departments. In the Republic era, it was often called the Municipal Works Bureau. In this timeline, the Guangzhou municipal government came up with this name to avoid confusion with the Ming dynasty's "Ministry of Works."

The Comprehensive Governance Bureau's direct superior was Lin Baiguang. After Yuan Shuzhi interned at the Bureau for three months with excellent performance, Lin Baiguang assigned him his first task.

Yuan Shuzhi's first task was the urban public toilet renovation project.

This project had been designated by Grand Prefect Liu Xiang as the number one livelihood project for the new year. In mid-17th century ancient cities, public toilets either didn't exist or existed in extremely crude forms. In Guangzhou's case, facilities that could be called public toilets came in two types. One was urinals placed on street corners for men to relieve themselves. The other was slightly more refined—in back alleys were half-buried excrement vats with stepping boards on top for people to relieve themselves.

These crude "public toilets" had no enclosure. Generally, urinals had conical hats as covers, and excrement vats had reed mat canopies—not for providing privacy but mainly to prevent rainwater from flowing in, affecting the quality of night soil and harming the excrement section owners' interests.

One could imagine that basically only men could use such crude facilities. Grand Prefect Liu believed that for women to also come out to work, providing necessary separate public toilets for men and women was essential.

Of course, from a hygiene perspective, adequate public toilets were also crucial. Because even such crude toilets were scarce. Therefore, anywhere one went to secluded areas, one could see traces of relieving oneself everywhere—especially in secluded back alleys, which were covered in excrement and urine.

The filth was bad enough, but it also polluted water sources and became the origin of various infectious diseases. So after completing the two major municipal projects of demolishing illegal structures and dredging the Six Vein Channels, Liu Xiang began work on building "public toilets" throughout the city.

---

Building public toilets, besides hygienic considerations, was also to eradicate urban criminal forces. Because in the past, Guangzhou's excrement sections were like warlord territories—not only interlocking like dog's teeth but with clear boundaries between sections, each with documented agreements. Excrement section owners often engaged in various open and covert struggles over collection rights, which also involved Temple of Guan Di gangs, often resulting in bloodshed.

Originally excrement section owners cleared excrement for free, since income from selling excrement was their profit. But over time, they instead used clearing excrement to coerce residents. Section owners instructed excrement workers to demand "leg power fees," "tea fees," and "cleaning fees," extorting clearing costs. Those unwilling to pay were threatened with cessation of excrement removal. Residents had no choice but to endure the exploitation. Public resentment was considerable.

So although building public toilets was expensive and very troublesome, it was of great benefit to urban governance—thus becoming an important part of Liu Xiang's "New Life Movement."

Though Guangzhou had the Six Vein Channels underground drainage system, for hygiene and fertilizer considerations, directly discharging public toilet waste into the Six Vein Channels was obviously inappropriate. Therefore, the construction company's design adopted septic tank models.

Public toilets were large shared facilities separated by gender, with attached "excrement dumping stations." Sanitation workers cleaned and flushed daily at set times. After flushing, the waste water flowed into septic tanks. After three-stage septic tank sedimentation and fermentation, the upper layer of clear water drained into sewer channels. When excrement residue accumulated to a certain level, workers manually emptied it into carts for transport to several "fertilizer stations" in the four suburbs. All the city's excrement and household garbage would be sold to nearby farmers here.

Such toilets' construction standards were roughly the same as public toilets before the 1980s in the old timeline—overall very crude, with barely passable sanitary conditions. But in this timeline, it was an incomparably advanced concept. The only regret for Lingao Construction Company designers was that because Guangzhou didn't yet have a tap water system, there were major deficiencies in providing flushing water. Sanitation workers had to haul water carts to flush the toilets.

That said, these public toilets built at street corners according to population density still greatly improved the urban sanitary environment.

Yuan Shuzhi was responsible for the construction of three of these public toilets.

He had completed the first one; now he was on the second. At this moment he was leading people in site selection, seeing where in the neighborhood the shared toilet should best be located. Using location knowledge he'd learned for the civil service examination, he discussed with several newly-hired young people: "Everyone, what do you think of these few locations? Shared toilets can't be built at wind openings—otherwise the fragrance will carry for miles. But they can't be too far from residents either, or residents won't want to use them. I think these few locations are acceptable—close to residential areas but not affecting residents' lives."

"Old Yuan, this location you mentioned probably won't work. By location analysis, this current spot is optimal." A young person who had just graduated from Lingao's Fangcaodi, passed administrative training, and been assigned here spoke up. Yuan Shuzhi gave him a look, thinking: this kid is still a kid. Though he's Australian-educated, he's rigid-minded. Doesn't he see how close this location is to Grand Prefect Liu's official residence? Building here would be courting death.

Yuan Shuzhi said: "You're still too young. I'm a few years older than you, so I have to tell you: don't quietly court disaster. Look at this location's position, and Guangzhou's prevailing winds. You don't have eyes, but don't you have a nose? All Elders live nearby—do Elders need shared toilets?! Building toilets should be based on ordinary people's needs."

The young person immediately fell silent but still felt unconvinced.

Yuan Shuzhi had to add: "There's nothing wrong with wanting to do a good job, but just burying your head in work will also lead to mistakes. You understand?"

Tea guests at the teahouse across the street watched their surveying. One guest laughed:

"I say these Australians control heaven, control earth, and even control people taking dumps and farting—they're too nosy. How trivial is this? Speaking of which, when old Wang Fengtou [Excrement Head] was around, things were much better than now. Why did they have to arrest perfectly good Wang Fengtou and execute him, calling him some criminal gang element? Now our household excrement has to pile up for days before anyone comes to collect it."

"I tell you, Old Wang, you'll die by that mouth of yours someday. Everyone knows this Wang Fengtou is your distant nephew, pays tribute every year. Speaking of character—he's a bad seed! He collects the excrement and sells it for money, yet still makes us pay him! And demands gifts every holiday. Last time my brother-in-law slightly slighted one of his underlings, and he didn't empty their excrement for a whole month!"

Someone over here was worried for the boss: "Boss, your teahouse is doomed! Once this shared toilet is built, the fragrance will carry for miles around here."

The teahouse boss's face turned green. No matter how the Australians claimed this water-flushed shared toilet was "clean and hygienic," nobody would enjoy drinking tea across from a toilet. Once it was built, he could only close shop! He was calculating how to salvage the situation.

...

Yuan Shuzhi was surveying locations when the municipal government suddenly sent a courier with an urgent notice. He opened it and saw it required him to report tomorrow to a certain room at the Great World to report to an Elder Zheng. He was temporarily seconded to work for her.

Though Yuan Shuzhi didn't know why he'd suddenly been seconded, he figured the Senate wanted to put him to important use, and was happy in his heart.

Returning to the bureau, he handed over his current urban tasks to others. The next morning he arrived at the Great World to report.

Zheng Mingjiang was meeting Yuan Shuzhi for the first time and couldn't help feeling somewhat disappointed. This person was not only quite old and world-weary but exuded a sour pedantic air all over. The moment he opened his mouth it was all classical rhetorical flourishes—who knew where this old failed examination candidate had crawled out from. She thought: how did such a person get mixed into our civil service ranks?

She was used to seeing young naturalized citizen cadres who'd come through the school system. Though they varied in looks, most had clean images and spoke crisply. In comparison, this Yuan Shuzhi really didn't look "capable" at all.

But the evaluation materials in his file were quite excellent—first place in the civil service sanitation position examination. Moreover, all his on-the-job training test scores were at the top, especially hygiene studies and epidemiology—both first place. Zheng Mingjiang knew how remarkable this was for someone in their fifties from an old literati background.

Zheng Mingjiang examined him carefully and felt that as long as he wore a wig and changed into a scholar's robe, he'd look exactly like a "Ming dynasty remnant." Without a trace of Australian air—perfect for undercover investigation and gathering intelligence.

After chatting briefly with him, she felt this person thoroughly understood worldly affairs and spoke and acted in quite an orderly manner—he should be capable of investigation work.

She broadly explained the work's content and priorities, then said: "This matter is currently highly confidential. Before and after, it cannot be leaked—can you do this?"

"The Chief commands; how dare I not obey?" Yuan Shuzhi declared boldly.

"You'll be responsible for undercover work, and may deal with criminals. There will be certain risks. Think about whether you can bear this?"

"Before the Chiefs entered the city, though I was alive, I was no different from a dead man—just had one more breath. Only after passing the civil service examination did I count as reborn. This new life of mine was given by the Chiefs. If the Chief wants it, I absolutely won't hesitate!"

Yuan Shuzhi's declaration made Zheng Mingjiang somewhat embarrassed. She smiled: "You don't need to be so nervous! Huizhou is our territory. I'll have people secretly protect you. I won't have you do dangerous things either. You just need to gather intelligence in secret. Since that's the case, go back and pack up. Tomorrow depart with the investigation team..."

In those few minutes, Yuan Shuzhi had already been calculating. He spoke up: "I believe it would be better for me to depart separately."

"Oh? Why?"

"Since the Chief wants me to investigate secretly, how can I travel with the investigation team?" He reasoned that going to Huizhou with the investigation team might get him spotted by someone along the way. Once discovered, his "secret investigation" mission couldn't continue.
