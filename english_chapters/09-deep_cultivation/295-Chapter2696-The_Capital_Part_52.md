# Chapter 2696: The Capital (Part 52)

"Is money still enough to use?"

Jin Wenchi's other identity in the Stone Old Man clique was General Steward; income and expenditure of money all went through him.

"Temporarily still enough. But recently spending money like flowing water—the Master sends a slip and it's hundreds and thousands of taels of silver. Heard next they still need to grease Big Shots, all tens of thousands of taels. Also year-end is coming; New Year expenses are another sum..." Daoist Jinshi smiled bitterly, "Fear it can't support too long."

"There is a sum of silver coming from Guangdong, roughly thirty to fifty thousand." Zhou Lezhi said, "Originally it could arrive these few days. It's just..."

"It's just" the money transfer bank was Delong—ever since Leng Ningyun [Cold Condensation Cloud] was kidnapped here, it was already "Sealed" by the Shuntian Prefecture Yamen.

This move Zhou Lezhi also felt was wonderful. Otherwise, the Shanxi Houses sharpening their knives in the capital would have long run Delong into bankruptcy. Even so, they still stopped accepting Delong notes and claimed it was "Just a Sheet of Waste Paper."

Said to be "Waste Paper," but Zhou Lezhi knew the Shanxi Houses' managers and clerks were all secretly buying back Delong notes at thirty to forty percent of face value. Obviously, they themselves didn't agree with the "Waste Paper" claim. The Daoist Jinshi before him also bought some.

"We calculated thousands and tens of thousands, just forgot to calculate this matter." Jin Wenchi laughed.

"No hindrance; delaying some days doesn't matter either. The dividends from Shanghai Merchants Bureau are about to arrive, also more than twenty thousand. Just get through the current situation." Zhou Lezhi seemed to have well-laid plans, but actually had no bottom in his heart [was uncertain]. He recalled the Teacher's words: "Fighting wars, doing business, handling affairs, all compete on one word: money."

"Money is a good thing, just hard to earn..." he muttered to himself.

The Stone Old Man clique's hand was very big, as if having inexhaustible money. Actually the many actions planned these few years were all money-losing deals. The biggest loss was the Multi-Heroes Attacking Lingao, which could be called losing wife and folding soldiers [complete loss]. Among participating wulin various sects and schools, over a hundred righteous men were lost. Just comfort silver alone spent more than fifteen thousand taels, plus previous various expenses, totaling more than twenty thousand taels of silver.

Spending silver was a small matter, but they owed various sects considerable favors. Fortunately, these years with war and chaos everywhere, many sects had to seek refuge under officials to survive and dared not calculate too much with them.

After Jin Wenchi left, he reviewed the current situation again. The capital's situation was now strange waves and treacherous clouds. Ever since the Emperor proposed Southern Expedition, various political forces launched a new round of activities around the topic of Southern Expedition. Especially the Court Big Shots who previously made great fortunes quietly, obtaining many benefits from Shorn-hair Thieves, were even more extremely active. Especially Dengzhou-Laizhou Governor Sun Yuanhua—originally thought to be completely dead, unexpectedly came back to life. These years, relying on the Thief Weapons sold to him by Shorn-hair Thieves, he trained a "New Army," winning several small victories on the Liaodong battlefield. Not only was his office restored, he also repeatedly received Court commendations, solemnly becoming a regional major minister of the Court. His mentor Xu Guangqi, fell gravely ill while garrisoning fields and training troops in Tianjin, on the verge of death. Hearing he obtained "Immortal Pills and Miraculous Medicine," he extended his life again. Now although he had retired to his hometown, he still gathered Religion-Following [Catholic] gentry to act secretly, colluding with Shorn-hair Thieves...

While pondering, Liu Zhao came.

"What matter?" Zhou Lezhi was startled.

It was already late night at this moment; Liu Zhao's sudden visit obviously meant there was urgent matter.

"I heard from brothers in the Northern Town-soothing Division that the Emperor has already heard of you, and sent people to inquire about your news." Liu Zhao whispered.

The Liu brothers, the one transformed into Daoist Mushi [Wood Stone], Liu Sha, was responsible externally for contacting various troops and horses, continuously investigating the Shorn-hair Thieves' movements, occasionally giving Shorn-hair Thieves some obstructions; while Liu Zhao was by Zhou Lezhi's side, responsible for various contacts and intelligence news. In the capital, whatever the Jinyiwei Northern Town-soothing Division could find out, Liu Zhao could also know.

"Oh, is there any abnormality?"

"Reported back saying you are living at Zaohua Temple to see doctors, no abnormality. For a moment and a while there is no hindrance. Only Your Honor must pay more attention."

"I know. What other urgent news?"

"The Emperor also instructed to inquire about Qian Taichong's matters..."

"Interesting, interesting. Seems this Mr. Qian's money wasn't spent in vain."

"There is another matter; the Emperor has already noticed Delong Money Shop, ordering the Town-soothing Division to investigate whether Delong has collusion with Palace Eunuchs..." Speaking to here, his voice was already suppressed to barely audible.

Late night, at Heliancheng.

Little Eight's figure flashed, walking into the hall, reporting: "Chief Escort, the merchant Qin Erlang requests to see."

Li Rufeng rubbed his temples, frowning impatiently, saying: "At this hour..."

Mrs. Liao [Liao Sanniang] said beside him: "Visiting at deep night, there must be urgency."

Li Rufeng's tone paused; a moment later, he said in a deep voice: "Invite."

Qin Erlang was about thirty years old, medium build, rough features, wearing blue travel clothes and black leather boots, covered in travel dust. One look could tell he was a person long experienced in travels.

Qin Erlang sat in the lower seat, first looking towards Li Rufeng in the upper seat, then glancing at Mrs. Liao, somewhat awkwardly pinching the corner of his clothes.

Mrs. Liao sat across from Qin Erlang, took out a pencil, opened a notebook, and quietly waited for him to speak.

Li Rufeng spoke first: "Troubling Sir, please have tea."

Qin Erlang lifted the tea cup, just brought it to his lips, then immediately put it down, saying: "Little person first went to the Leng Residence, only then learned the Leng Office now encountered big matters. Mr. Wu currently stays at the Delong Shop; I didn't see him. Master Leng's side-madam Hexiang came out to meet little person once, heard little person's words, but said this matter wasn't suitable to seek Mr. Wu, only fitting to report to the Bureau Chief. She sent someone to guide little person here; disturbing in deep night, Bureau Chief please forgive."

Li Rufeng waved his big hand, saying: "This kind of fire-urgent matter, report whenever arriving, who cares about day or night. Mr. Qin willing to come and pass news is a good friend. Sir please speak in detail."

Qin Erlang pulled his chair slightly towards Li Rufeng's direction, saying: "That day I was escorting goods returning, only arriving at the capital outskirts..."

Li Rufeng listened to Qin Erlang's narration, scraped his chin whiskers with his fingers. Looking at the clothing description, his heart determined the matter was true.

In the description, Leng Ningyun's clothing matched when he departed. The kidnappers not changing Master Leng's clothes in time wasn't really an oversight; they wouldn't think someone would take the risk to open the cart door to check.

Ink-glasses, eye patches, pressed mustache, ear caps—these were to isolate Leng Ningyun's senses, confuse his judgment of time, distance, and road conditions, preventing Leng Ningyun from back-calculating route information. The kidnappers made precautions for after the hostage returns. Analyzing from this point, it showed the kidnappers had no intention of silencing. It could be deduced that Leng Ningyun was temporarily safe, which let Li Rufeng feel somewhat relieved.

Master Leng possessed an extremely rare pair of oval-framed ink-crystal glasses that made him look like a blind toad when worn. It was said to be originally produced in Great Song, brought by Master Leng when he fled from Song territory. These glasses had a nickname called "Ray-Ban"; don't know who this craftsman named Ray-Ban was.

These glasses were unique in Beijing. Master Leng treasured them dearly, rarely wearing them, almost becoming Senator Leng's personal anti-counterfeiting label. That day he happened to wear these glasses, which confirmed the person in the cart was Leng Ningyun himself.

Li Rufeng saw Qin Erlang stop speaking with nothing more to add. He turned his eyes to glance at Mrs. Liao. Mrs. Liao lightly patted the notebook, nodding to indicate recording was complete.

Li Rufeng stood up, slowly walking to Qin Erlang's front, his huge shadow darkening Qin Erlang's eyes.

Qin Erlang hurriedly stood up. Li Rufeng extended both hands, grasped Qin Erlang's hands, shaking gently, his face full of sincerity saying: "True feelings are seen in hardship; Delong and Heliancheng have remembering hearts. When the dust settles, shall drink happily and get drunk together with Sir."

Qin Erlang's figure disappeared from view. Li Rufeng stood at the empty hall doorway, facing the heavy darkness, standing briefly for a moment, calling towards outside the hall: "Bring two more lamps."

Before long, several more large candles were lit in the hall, illuminating one corner of the inner hall brightly.

Li Rufeng and Mrs. Liao stood before a table; on the table lay spread a simple Beijing map.

Mrs. Liao lifted a candlestick with her left hand, her right index finger lightly tracing on the map. After a moment, she frowned and said: "This route goes towards Zhangjiakou. Zhangjiakou is close to the three passes of Zijing, Feihu, and Juyong; west borders northern Shanxi's Yanbei; north connects to Mongol Tatars; also has the Northwest Border Markets. If the kidnappers take Master Leng far away to the frontiers, the vast grasslands, seeking people is like sifting sand in wilderness, nowhere to grasp."

Li Rufeng bent down to look at the map, shaking his head, saying: "Not necessarily going to Zhangjiakou. Going onto the grasslands, the journey is distant, passes and barriers obstruct, contacting is extremely inconvenient. Since it's for getting silver, they naturally won't complicate matters. Routes can change, people can walk, those who walked out can turn back. Baoding, Tianjin, Jizhen are all possible destinations."

"Tianjin probably isn't possible anymore..."

Tianjin Station was the Senate's important station in the North. The relationships and properties left behind when Xu Guangqi garrisoned fields and trained troops in Tianjin back then were now all taken over by Tianjin Station. Since the kidnappers knew Senator Leng's background, they probably wouldn't walk into the trap themselves.

"This isn't certain either; so-called 'Dark under the lamp.'" Li Rufeng shook his head, "The kidnappers can probably guess we think this way; perhaps what they do is exactly the unexpected."

Mrs. Liao said: "Matters of the route, call the various Senior Brothers in to discuss together. Just you and me alone will always have biases."

Li Rufeng raised his head, voice low: "The various Senior Brothers can share fortune and disaster, can be entrusted with life and death, but cannot be told all heartfelt matters. They, after all, are not within the System, cannot be stuck to the heart's flesh [innermost circle]. Only after you and I discuss and find a thread can we call them in to discuss the detailed specifics."

The kidnappers rushing to transfer Leng Ningyun was obviously because they hired people to search on a large scale recently. The kidnappers felt the Capital was already very unsafe, so they wanted to change places to hide the Ticket [kidnapping victim].

Once the person was transferred out, variables would become even more numerous. Especially with war and chaos outside, if they encountered ticket-robbers on the way or encountered bandits and roving bandits attacking merchants, or if those hiding the ticket had conflicts with the kidnappers, all could endanger Senator Leng's personal safety.

"I see, the kidnappers have the momentum of a cornered dog jumping the wall. We'd better hurry and ransom the person. As long as the person can return safely, everything is easy to discuss!"
