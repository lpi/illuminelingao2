# Chapter 2545: Guangzhou Textile Market (Part 3)

"Speaking of cotton stock, there might actually still be quite a bit inside Guangzhou City." Wu Yijun pondered for a moment and said, "It's just that with this current market situation, the other parties will nine out of ten want to hold back sales. They may not necessarily be willing to sell even at market price."

"As long as there are goods, they always have to sell. Besides, in another few months, local new cotton will appear; not selling then would be a loss too. Now is a good time to sell."

"Words are not wrong, but right now the market is scalding hot, rising every day..." Wu Yijun laughed, "Never seen cotton become so sought-after! You probably don't know yet, now there is a new trick..."

"There are several patterned cloth firms in the city that privately set up a cotton market, selling 'Paper Cotton'."

"'Paper Cotton'? How to make cotton from paper?" Chen Lin was baffled.

"Hehe, that's why it's called a fresh gadget!" Wu Yijun said, "But speaking of it, it's not too fresh. Your family has been making silk for generations; do you know 'Pre-renting Mulberry Trees'?"

"This naturally I know." Chen Lin said, "Silkworm raising households find families planting mulberry trees, sign a contract beforehand paying money to rent a set number of mulberry trees. When the time comes, they enter the garden to pick regardless of market price." He finished speaking and suddenly understood, "So you mean, they are selling autumn's new cotton?"

"Correct. You go there to buy, pay the money, and he gives you a warehouse receipt, stating how many piculs of cotton can be picked up upon expiration. But it's not just a piece of paper!"

"Indeed a new trick. But we want cotton now; what use is having just a piece of paper?"

"Virtuous Nephew! You are an honest businessman, not understanding the tricks inside." Wu Yijun laughed, "This Paper Cotton is just a paper contract. One piece of paper can exchange for wealth; isn't this digging cake out of flat ground [making money from nothing]? They issue as much Paper Cotton as they want. Is there any business so profitable in the world?"

"But, delivery still has to be made upon expiration! If too much is issued, and there aren't enough spot goods to deliver when the time comes, what to do... Could it be they intend to leave and walk away at the end? Haven't people buying Paper Cotton thought of this?"

"Of course they thought of it, but what they think is different from what you think." Wu Yijun said, "After this Paper Cotton is sold, it can be traded. A buys and sells to B, B buys and sells to C... Just like beating drums to pass flowers. Now cotton prices rise section by section; buying in the morning and selling in the afternoon can earn money... You shouldn't underestimate this drum beating and flower passing. Every pass, the price floats up quite a bit. This morning's market price per picul is already more expensive than spot goods..."

"This..." Chen Lin only felt it was inconceivable. At that time, the concept of "Futures" actually already existed. Theoretically speaking, futures prices and spot prices didn't have a strict high-low law; futures prices were mainly estimates of future market supply and demand. If a major disaster was encountered this summer, causing cotton production to drop suddenly, or if the Senate opened ten more cotton textile factories in one breath, it wasn't impossible for the market price three months later to be higher than now. But the risk inside was astonishingly huge, completely a kind of gambling.

"This... afraid something will happen." Chen Lin said.

"I also see it this way." Wu Yijun sighed, "However, those few patterned cloth firms and speculators definitely earned enough. The unlucky ones are probably the suckers taking over at the end. Heard that many small households, peddlers and porters in the city also pooled money, started associations/clubs to buy this Paper Cotton to resell."

"Afraid they will lose their family fortunes in the end, causing unbearable matters!" Chen Lin sighed.

After the uncle and nephew lamented, Wu Yijun said: "You don't need to worry about buying cotton either; there is a family that has ready-made cotton."

"Don't know which family? Nephew will go try. If I can persuade them, that would be best."

"His family will definitely be willing. Speaking of which, he counts as your old acquaintance, Dong Jizhong's family."

"Him?" Chen Lin was stunned. "His family were originally hereditary military officers, not merchants. Although they have some landed property locally, most were encroached Garrison Fields, now all turned over to the Australians. Where would cotton come from?"

The Dong family had always had dealings with Cousin-Uncle; Chen Lin always knew this. Moreover, he knew the Dong family was actually one of the shareholders in this Nansha Textile Factory, only the specific investment amount was unknown. Chen Lin naturally didn't ask.

"Hehe, you only know one, not the two." Wu Yijun laughed, "Dong Jizhong's old bean [father] and brother are both officials in the Ming State—and not small officials. Some days ago when setting up the factory, I told Little Dong: once the factory is set up, the demand for cotton will definitely be not small; everyone must think of ways. Little Dong then wrote letters to his father and brother, asking them to try to purchase cotton and transport it south. He also got a few hundred piculs."

"Since there is cotton, Nephew will go ask for a meeting right now!"

"No need to rush. I already made an appointment with him to go to the Textile Market together tomorrow. We can talk when we get there."

Early the next morning, after the uncle and nephew had breakfast, they boarded two rickshaws. Four servants rode in two other carts separately. The group headed towards the Light Textile Market.

Wu Yijun lived in the north of the city. After leaving the residence, the rickshaws went south all the way, then turned west. The pullers were all vigorous young men, fast on their feet and familiar with the roads. In a blink of an eye, they exited Xiguan [West Gate/Pass].

Although there were neighborhood blocks outside Xiguan, it was still a relatively desolate place in the 17th century. The rickshaws ran for another distance before stopping by the roadside.

"Arrived. Over there is the International Textile Market." Wu Yijun said.

Chen Lin got off the cart and looked around, instantly confused. The surroundings here were all paddy fields and wasteland. The only thing that could be called a building was a newly built wharf by the roadside. There were quite a few people on the wharf, people coming and carts going, very lively.

"This is... the market?!"

"Haha, this is the ferry crossing. The market is across the river—Henan Land. We have to take a ferry from this Xiguan Wharf." Wu Yijun pointed to the opposite side of the river. There was also a wharf opposite, and streets and houses built along the river could be vaguely seen, looking quite large in scale.

*How did Australians think of setting up a market in Henan Land? Wouldn't travel be inconvenient this way?* Chen Lin was secretly doubtful. Although Henan Land was just south of Guangzhou City, before a bridge was built over the Pearl River, travel relied solely on boat ferries. Transportation was very inconvenient, residents were few, and it was mainly agricultural.

He voiced his doubt to his cousin-uncle. Wu Yijun also nodded: "I am curious about this too. generally speaking, let's go over and see first."

There was a ferry ticket office on the wharf. The ferry here sailed once every half hour. Single person ticket price was one fen; adding freight added another fen. Many commoners were already waiting under the straw shed for the boat.

Wu Yijun was unwilling to wait long. Fortunately, there were also many private small ferry skiffs at the wharf, all hanging operation permits and boat license numbers issued by the Guangzhou Police Bureau, queuing to wait for customers in order. The price was five fen per time, but leaving immediately upon boarding, very convenient. These used to be the livelihood of Tanka households on the Pearl River; now they were still the practitioners, but the Guangzhou Police Bureau listed them within management scope. All ferry boats had to obtain licenses and operation permits for easy management.

Wu Yijun found a small skiff and ferried to Henan Land immediately.

Boarding the wharf, the two could see many laborers clearing construction waste on the construction site. Others were paving road surfaces and planting trees. Obviously, the market construction had largely entered the final stage. Besides the ten large iron sheet characters "Guangzhou City International Textile Market" hanging high at the entrance, there was also a very conspicuous road sign: "No. 144 Xingang West Road."

Chen Lin looked around. The market surroundings were all fields; where did the preceding 143 houses come from? Although a market town was newly built here, with neat and beautiful streets and houses, it obviously couldn't compare to the prosperity of Guangzhou on the opposite bank. Pedestrians were few, appearing somewhat deserted.

Opening a shop had stressed location since ancient times. Australians acted the opposite way, opening a market in a place where birds don't shit and transportation is inconvenient... What kind of business sutra was this?

While doubting, suddenly heard someone calling:

"Ah Lin? You came so fast?" The voice was very familiar. Chen Lin turned his head to look and discovered it was exactly An Jiu.

The internship group came to Guangzhou on the same ship with him two days ago. However, they parted ways after arriving in Guangzhou. The internship group went to the Great World, while Chen Lin went directly to Wu Yijun's home.

"So it is Miss An!" Wu Yijun laughed, "What? You also came to stroll in the market?"

"We are not here to stroll," An Jiu laughed, "We are here to help. The Rental and Sales Conference will open here in a few days. I came to do some preparatory work. You came to look at market shops, right?"

"Exactly." Wu Yijun nodded.

"Then let me take you for a tour in advance." An Jiu poked her chin with a pen. Since the wharf opened these few days, quite a few curious Guangzhou merchants and people came to visit, wanting to see this "International" peep show.

"This, Miss An has public duties on herself, right?" Chen Lin said, "Will it delay public affairs..."

"No hindrance. Taking customers for a tour is also part of my job." An Jiu smiled.

"Speaking of which, Miss An Jiu, since it is doing business, why set the market in Henan Land? Isn't passage inconvenient this way? Besides, the popularity [foot traffic] here is also too thin." Chen Lin asked the question both his cousin-uncle and he wanted to know upon stepping into the Light Textile Market boundary.

"This! Because this market mainly faces bulk trade. Commodities entering and exiting mostly rely on ships for transshipment, so location and popularity aren't key issues. The place needs to be big enough and by the river to moor ships." An Jiu said.

Actually, Li Shan chose Henan Land mainly because land prices here were cheap, able to purchase a large amount of land at one time. If there was a need for expansion in the future, there was also a large margin. It was more convenient than Guangzhou urban area or other suburbs. At the same time, his doing so could also drive the development of Henan Land.

Although the market's positioning covered everything, the main body of customers was wholesalers. The quantity of goods entering and exiting at one time was large, requiring large-area warehouses for turnover. If they were foreign merchants, it also involved long-term and short-term residence issues for crew members and merchants. Satisfying these needs required a large amount of land.
