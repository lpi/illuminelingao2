# Chapter 2756: The Capital (Part 112)

Returning to his room, he immediately wrote a simple report based on the confession and sent it to Center by telegraph. As for the detailed confession record, it would be sent out in original text via the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's communication line. In the report, he not only suggested making full use of Liu Sha but also proposed that it would be best to secretly settle him in a safer place like Tianjin to interrogate the intelligence of the Stone Elder group in detail.

"...This person understands the Stone Elder group very deeply and was the on-site organizer and commander of many anti-Kun actions. He has significant intelligence utility value."

After writing, he asked if there was any new news from each group. The answer was: "Temporarily none."

Now, it is undeniable that Yang Tianliang is one of the masterminds of the kidnapping case. Of course, he is a "secondary mastermind," but he committed the grave crime of "unpardonable" offense against the personal safety of a Senator. This is one thing.

Second, according to Liu Sha's confession, the conflict between Yang Tianliang and Leng Ningyun is obviously in an irreconcilable state. His utility value has completely disappeared, and it is very likely that because of this failed kidnapping operation, he will engage in conspiracies even more aggressively. The most appropriate way is to "secretly execute" him.

However, to "secretly execute" Yang Tianliang, he still had to seek the opinions of Leng Ningyun and Center.

As for "Stone Elder" himself, whether to take action depends on the subsequent progress. Both the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and the Political Security Bureau have a consistent attitude towards the Stone Elder group, which is to cut the weeds and remove the roots.

Although Wang Yehao is the leader, in Xu Ke's view, this person is insignificant. The key is that Zhou Lezhi.

Where exactly is he hiding now?

Wang Zhi came into the study and whispered a few words in Zhou Lezhi's ear. Zhou Lezhi was startled and asked: "Really?"

"Absolutely true." Wang Zhi whispered, "Xu Yong came to report."

"Call him in."

Xu Yong entered the room and stood silently to the side.

"Tell me about the matter in Tongzhou; don't omit anything."

"Yes!" Xu Yong responded, "This small one followed Uncle Liu to Tongzhou to investigate Second Uncle Liu..."

"Say names when reporting!" Zhou Lezhi reminded.

"Yes! This small one followed Liu Zhao to Tongzhou to find Liu Sha's whereabouts. We only found his contact person. The contact person didn't know his specific lodging either, only that he met every day at a teahouse called 'Hou Garden'."

Liu Zhao and Xu Yong inquired everywhere in Tongzhou but had no news. They only knew that his last appearance was more than ten days ago. It wasn't until they asked a familiar constable in the Tongzhou yamen that they knew something happened to Liu Sha.

"...He said Liu Sha engaged a woman from a musician household (*yuehu*) in Tongzhou and bought a residence. A few days ago, the procuress of the musician household reported to the officials that her daughter Rui Jie hadn't come home for a long time. Knocking on the door, she found the doors unlocked locked, and a foul smell drifting out from inside. The constables went in to inspect and found a male corpse in the mansion. There were bloodstains on the wall and ground, suggesting traces of a struggle. Liu Sha and Rui Jie, as well as an old couple guarding the door, are missing."

"The male corpse is not Liu Sha?" Zhou Lezhi asked in shock.

"No," Xu Yong said. "Fortunately, the case hasn't been closed, and the corpse was encoffined and temporarily stored in the charitable estate (*Yizhuang*). Liu Zhao took this small one to the charitable estate to open the coffin and check. The one who died was actually Wang Liang!"

Now Zhou Lezhi was greatly shocked. Wang Liang, like Liu Sha, had also been missing for many days. But no one expected these two people to be connected.

According to the rules of the Stone Elder group, the attendants running errands for Master Wang and personnel with the "Stone" character had no lateral contact with each other. Except for those living inside the Wang mansion, they didn't know each other's lodgings.

As one of the trusted aides around Wang Yehao, although Wang Liang knew all the important figures in the Stone Elder group, he had never broken this rule. How did he die in Liu Sha's outer residence now?

One hundred thousand whys flashed through Zhou Lezhi's mind, but not a single one could be explained. He had to ask:

"How did the person die?"

"Stabbed to death with a knife. The constable big brother said the method was ruthless, not the work of an ordinary person."

"Do you know who did it?"

"Liu Zhao investigated in Tongzhou for a few days with no news. However," Xu Yong hesitated, "Liu Zhao said that quite a few suspicious outsiders have come to Tongzhou recently. This small one estimates that nine out of ten it was done by the Kun scoundrels."

"That's it. You go." Zhou Lezhi said, "Don't meet Liu Zhao anymore recently. If there is anything, send a message using the mailbox. Don't come to my place either."

Sending Xu Yong away, Zhou Lezhi instructed Wang Zhi: Move house!

If the Kun scoundrels had personnel reserved in Tongzhou, the matter of Xu Yong and Liu Zhao going to Tongzhou to find Liu Sha certainly couldn't be hidden. When the time comes and the Kun scoundrels follow the trail, he would only have the share of being captured with tied hands.

This time, he decided to completely cut off human contact with the Stone Elder group and use mailboxes for all contact.

How Wang Liang died in Liu Sha's outer residence was unknown, but Liu Sha's disappearance had one possibility: he had fallen into the hands of the Kun scoundrels.

The Kun scoundrels had plenty of ways to pry open Liu Sha's mouth. Once he spoke, many secrets of the Stone Elder group would be exposed to the light of day. The name Zhou Lezhi would inevitably become the number one wanted person by the Kun scoundrels.

This kind of "honor" was very terrifying. Zhou Lezhi knew very well the cost the Kun scoundrels were willing to pay to eliminate dissidents.

Confrontation was impossible; the only way was to hide.

No matter how rampant the Kun scoundrels were, they couldn't openly search and arrest in the Capital. The Capital had the most "officials" and dense networks of informants. As long as his hiding place was not leaked, hiding was the safest way.

This time, he moved to a courtyard near the Wanping County Yamen, close to the Imperial City wall, and lived there quietly.

Not long after settling down, Zhou Lezhi wrote a letter and then sent Wang Zhi to the "mailbox" to deliver it.

If Liu Sha was captured, the entire Stone Elder group would be in danger. Wang Yehao was a high official of the Imperial Court, so the Kun scoundrels might still have some scruples, but anyone in the Stone Elder group known to Liu Sha would probably fear for their lives. He had to remind them to take precautions individually. It was best not to contact each other for the next month or two.

Secondly, use all connections within the Imperial Court: including people from the Jinyiwei, Eastern Depot, Five Cities Wardens Office, Shuntian, Daxing, Wanping, and other yamen, to strictly patrol and inspect in the Capital, putting pressure on the Kun scoundrels to force them to contract their activities or withdraw from the Capital.

If personal safety couldn't even be guaranteed in the Capital, their gang might as well disband quickly.

After handling these, Zhou Lezhi silently reflected on the failure of this kidnapping case under the window. He smoothed the whole process back and forth, pondering which link had gone wrong.

In this operation, he could be said to have "exhausted all schemes" and thought of everything before and after. Detention and ransoming were handled by two groups of people separately, and much work was done to confuse the public. Unexpectedly, the Kun scoundrels still found a breakthrough and snatched the person from the West Garden without a word!

To act so quickly, accurately, and ruthlessly, there must be an intelligence source. So where is this intelligence source?

Zhou Lezhi couldn't help but suspect Liu Sha.

Rationally and emotionally, he was the most likely. Moreover, he knew that his request to Master Wang last year was rejected, so he probably harbored resentment. Now it was exposed that he engaged a woman in Tongzhou.

Zhou Lezhi knew the cost of engaging a woman very well, and he kept it secret within the Stone Elder group. Obviously, he had developed outside intentions at this time.

However, things having come to this, whether the traitor was Liu Sha was no longer important. The key now was to reverse the court situation as soon as possible and facilitate peace negotiations.

Originally, he and Master Wang operated in secret, and at least with Wen Tiren, they had obtained some kind of tacit permission for "peace negotiations." Master Wang also secretly contacted the pro-peace faction through his connections. But not long ago, he discovered a huge variable, that is, the Restoration Society (*Fu She*).

Zhang Pu, the head of the Restoration Society, is currently secretly pushing for Zhou Yanru's return. Originally, Zhou Yanru's return was in Zhou Lezhi's "prophecy" and would have to wait until four years later. What caught him off guard was that Zhang Pu advocated suppressing the Kun! Not only the Two Zhangs of Loudong in the Society, but many members of the Society also held this view, believing that the Kun scoundrels had become the Imperial Court's heart's disease and must be eradicated as soon as possible.

Now, Zhou Lezhi was somewhat at a loss. The "Heavenly Book" only mentioned Zhou Yanru's return and the Restoration Society's assistance, but not their attitude towards the Kun scoundrels.

According to the intelligence they collected, several big shots in the Restoration Society actually had connections with the Kun scoundrels. The Merchants' Navigation on the Tianjin route was jointly run by Shen Tingyang and the Real Kun Zhao Yingong in Hangzhou. Even Zhang Pu himself had contact and dealings with the Kun scoundrels.

Originally, he thought that even if the gentlemen of the Restoration Society might not be willing to support peace negotiations with the Kun scoundrels, they wouldn't be anxious to suppress the Kun. The current situation was completely beyond his expectations.

With the Restoration Society's attitude towards the Kun scoundrels being so disgusted, how could he persuade the Two Zhangs of Loudong?

Although Zhou Yanru would not enter the Grand Secretariat until four years later, once Wen Tiren left office, even if his partisans continued to control the Grand Secretariat, they would have to be cautious in their actions. With the current momentum of the Restoration Society, Grand Secretaries Liu Yuliang, Xue Guoguan, and others might not dare to go against the court opinion. In this way, his layout for peace negotiations in the Imperial Court would be wasted!

He didn't have many choices now: either persuade the Restoration Society to give up anti-Kun, or fully assist Wen Tiren to tide over the immediate crisis and keep the position of Senior Grand Secretary.

To persuade Zhang Pu, this Master of Heaven (*Tongtian Jiaozhu*), Zhou Lezhi admitted he didn't have this ability. Moreover, even if he persuaded him, he might not be able to persuade the scholars of the Restoration Society.

As for protecting Wen Tiren, he knew more or less from the Heavenly Book about the beginning and end of Wen Tiren's downfall. It was still the beginning of the year. As long as he persuaded him to let Qian Qianyi off, not to make an issue of the Zhang Hanru matter, avoiding dismissal was still possible.

It's just that Wen Tiren has always been insidious and cunning; I'm afraid it will be hard to gain his trust. Secondly, although Wen Tiren was dismissed because Emperor Chongzhen suspected he "had a faction" due to his insistence on framing Qian Qianyi, the Emperor was already dissatisfied with Wen Tiren. This matter was just a trigger. Even if Wen Tiren dodged the first of the month, he might not dodge the fifteenth.

It seems that even though I hold the Heavenly Book and was taught by my master, I am still a complete layman in being an official. This matter still needs Master Wang to decide.
