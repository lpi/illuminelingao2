# Chapter 2784: The Capital (Part 140)

As soon as the spring of the eleventh year of Chongzhen began, the common people of the Capital experienced the abnormality of the heavenly seasons. Seeing winter go and spring come, the calendar had already turned to late March, but the northwest wind howling for days did not sweep with yellow sand and dust covering heaven and earth as in previous years. Instead, it blew countless snowflakes mixed with cold rain smashing coldly onto pedestrians' heads. Those poor people who had no money to afford sedan chairs and couldn't afford to ride mules or horses shivered with cold, stumbling step by deep step and step by shallow step along the streets full of accumulated snow and mud. Under hunger and cold, some people tripped and fell into the mud pools formed by snow water while walking, struggled unable to get up, and stopped moving after a while.

The abnormal spring cold unexpectedly made the business of tea houses everywhere booming. In this snowy March season, one only needed to inquire about the rising prices at the firewood market and coal shops, and most people would decisively choose to nest in the tea house to "incubate" for a whole day. Tables and chairs near the hot water stove were crowded with people early on. But even in corners far from the stove, the steam spreading in the room would give people a false sense of warmth. Moreover, besides warmth, this dense white mist even gave people a strange illusion, as if it was enough to shield the eyes and ears of the East Depot and Jinyiwei agents, allowing one to be invisible within it. Thus, the noise of chatting inevitably became louder and louder. Topics always started from the absurdity of the heavenly seasons, and how many bodies of those fallen on the road were carried away by street patrol soldiers this morning, then turned into complaints about rice prices and firewood/coal prices. Amidst sighs, topics gradually shifted to dangerous fields like East Barbarians (Manchus) invading, Roving Bandits rebelling, and Kun Thieves partitioning territory. Discussions also inevitably became more and more unrestrained. Only until tea guests argued loudly about which was most urgent among suppressing bandits, resisting barbarians, and suppressing Kun; which court minister or governor should be tied up and sent to the West Market most; and even dangerous topics like how the fate of the Great Ming Dynasty would be in the future, would the shopkeeper come out to mediate and persuade, reminding them to pay attention to the poster of "Do Not Discuss State Affairs" on the wall.

For this tea house near Chaoyang Gate, the shop owner always instructed the Tea Doctor (waiter) to close the windows tightly in rainy and snowy weather, resisting the cold while also isolating the tea guests' wild talks inside the room. However, cold wind inevitably seeped through the window cracks, so the tables by the window were always rarely visited. But there was a young man claiming to be a student of the Imperial Academy who singularly favored this position. As soon as the tea house opened in the morning, he would sit here, order a bowl of Yuanbao Tea and a few sesame cakes, sip a few mouthfuls, open the bamboo book satchel carried with him, take out paper, brush, ink box, and a thin booklet. Borrowing the light penetrating through the bright tile window board (translucent shell window), he would flip through the booklet for a few pages and then bury his head to start copying.

Although it was a tea house, there was no fragrance of tea in the room. In winter, doors and windows were closed tightly, and the air was very foul, with only an indescribable mixed smell. Plus the noise of tea guests, reading and writing with peace of mind in this small world was truly a difficult task. Yet this young man concentrated his mind and spirit, wielding the brush as if flying.

What tea guests discussed most recently was not state affairs, but a "strange case" lately. Naturally, this strange case was the kidnapping case of Shopkeeper Leng. Although the case had long been closed, and the run on Delong caused by it had also subsided for many days, there were too many vague details in it, enough to hook up the infinite curiosity of tea guests.

Originally for such a big case, there must be detailed news in the Shuntian Prefecture Yamen. But the few Shuntian Prefecture yamen runners who frequented the tea house couldn't tell anything fresh. So far, everyone only knew two things: The Old Xi'er (Shanxi merchants) played dirty tricks behind the back, and He Lian Sheng took the first credit.

Gradually, there were more tea guests in the shop. Amidst the greeting of the Tea Doctor and the chatting and sighing of tea guests, a middle-aged man lifted the door curtain and walked into the room, shook off the snowflakes falling on his fine velvet *Dahu* (outer robe), then took off the green felt big hat, revealing a gray and sparse hair bun. He also carried a book satchel in his hand. Tea guests turned a blind eye to this down-and-out scholar common in the Capital. The Tea Doctor also didn't attend to greeting him. The middle-aged scholar slowly wandered to the table by the window. Seeing that young Tribute Student (Gongsheng) was still burying his head copying the book, and the green olive in the Yuanbao Tea was picked out and placed on the bowl lid. He narrowed his eyes to glance, then sat down on his own: "Dare to ask this gentleman (Xiang gong), are you copying the *Peking Gazette* (Jing Bao)?"

"Exactly." The young man raised his head, speaking Mandarin with a heavy Min (Fujian) accent, "My hometown is far and remote. Elders want to hear the Jade Voice (Emperor's words) from the Imperial Palace but suffer from its difficulty to reach. This *Peking Gazette* has detailed news, but the price is very expensive. Borrowing the gazette to copy is also a method of no method. I let the old gentleman laugh at me."

The so-called *Peking Gazette* was exactly the result of Australian cultural fashion touching the remote and dull nerves of the Ming Empire. Since Australians partitioned Lingnan, although the Emperor personally issued an edict to ban "Kun books and obscene paintings," all Australian newspapers were also included in the ban. Moreover, it was repeatedly reiterated that "Memorials are for Imperial review, reporting houses are not allowed to copy and circulate arbitrarily without authorization," to avoid delivering news to Kun spies, "Violators will be punished." unexpectedly, wealthy shops in the Copying Gazette Guild in the Capital saw business opportunities from Australian newspapers and magazines. They pooled shares to open reporting houses, bribed the Titang Officials (couriers) of various provincial governors stationed in Beijing to copy the residence gazette (Di Bao), printed them into booklets using wooden movable type, and even added simple woodblock news illustrations, issuing one issue every ten days. Although the selling price of 30 Wen of Beijing cash per single booklet was not cheap, bureaucrats and scholars in the Capital still flocked to it like ducks. Even illiterate commoners took pleasure in asking people to read the gazette.

Hearing the words *Peking Gazette*, a few sharp-eared tea guests gathered around requesting to read the gazette. The young man didn't decline. However, his mouth of Min accent was truly a torture to the ears of the Capital's commoners. So the middle-aged scholar sitting across the table, having just finished eating a bowl of tea soup, was begged by the crowd of tea guests to continue reading. His mouth of authentic Beijing dialect (Jing Pianzi) rose and fell in cadence but appeared somewhat lacking in vital energy. Tea guests listening to the gazette gradually started discussing in low voices:

"Why doesn't the gazette mention border affairs?"

"At the beginning of the month over at Xuan-Da (Xuanfu and Datong) Town, the Cha (Chahar) slaves knocked on the pass requesting to open markets. Old Minister Lu determined that if not East Barbarians, they must be impersonated by Kun Thieves, and resolutely refused. heard he even had a big quarrel with Minister of War Grand Secretary Yang. How come there is no follow-up?"

"You people are too ignorant of matters!" An old man wearing a flat square scarf emitted a sharp tone: "The Court not only banned the Kun Thieves' newspapers but also forbade reporting houses from privately copying memorials and imperial endorsements mentioning border affairs and military matters. What is it for? You people just think about it, if the Kun Thieves knew that East Barbarians entering the border is just like coming to the Capital for a spring outing, and they go to swear an alliance with that Barbarian Chieftain Hong Tai (Hong Taiji) by smearing blood, what should our Dynasty do? The Emperor is indeed sagacious!"

Everyone in the shop roared with laughter. Some also shook heads and sighed, "Old Minister Lu is probably confused. Never mind the East Barbarians, if Kun people request to open markets, they just come straight from the sea. Why bother to detour outside the border and knock on the pass at Xuan-Da?"

"Old Man Zhang, what nonsense are you talking," A burly man slapped the tea bowl on the table and yelled: "Are you speaking for the East Barbarians, or for the Kun Thieves? Didn't you hear the newspaper read in the first ten days? Roving Bandit Li Zicheng collapsed, and the Eighth Great King Thief Zhang has been beheaded in battle by Heavenly Troops, his head about to be displayed to the world. These are all Master Lu's merits back then. What kind of thing are you, daring to slander Grand Master Lu here!"

The old man with the flat square scarf coughed twice and laughed: "Sixth Brother Wang (Wang the Old Fifth) don't go mad. You keep saying Master Lu; do you know another Master Lu of the Six Offices of Scrutiny, Lu Beike?"

"Is it the 'Eating Kun Meat Raw' Lu Beike?" A clerk drinking tea responded, causing a burst of loud laughter from the tea guests. Commoners in the Capital all knew that Supervising Secretary of the Office of Scrutiny for Personnel, Lu Zhaolong (Courtesy name Benqian, Pseudonym Beike), born in Guangdong, hated Kun people and Macau Portuguese Barbarians most in his life. Every time he submitted a memorial to criticize Minister of War Zhang Fengyi for not thinking about suppressing Kun, he would make ruthless remarks: "The hearts of the people in the whole Guangdong are tumultuous, thinking of eating Fengyi's meat." Unexpectedly, he was mocked by Vice Minister of War Yang Sichang instead: "Since there are people's hearts like this in Guangdong, presumably the meat of Kun thieves is all finished." Lu Zhaolong was furious and chaotic, inevitably losing etiquette before the Emperor, and from then on fell into such a nickname.

"Speaking of the mine workers rebelling in Yongzhou, Chenzhou, and other places the year before last, this Master Lu requested the Emperor to let him go for pacification, planning to imitate Qi Nantang (Qi Jiguang)'s established method to train mine workers as soldiers to prepare for attacking Kun. The Emperor granted permission, issuing a decree for him to be Governor of Pian-Yuan. Pity no one was willing to follow his orders; within a few months of taking office, he died tragically in the chaotic army, his head cut off by mine bandits. This old man is indeed not some *thing* (person of consequence), but Wang the Old Fifth, if you are really a *thing*, why didn't you serve under Lu Beike's command back then? Wouldn't it be better than grinding lips (arguing) with us old folks in the tea house?"

The burly man called Wang the Old Fifth had his face swell to purple, yet held back unable to say a single sentence.

"Heard that group of mine bandits were suppressed by Heavenly Troops until they had no place to hide, most scattered and killed, a small half finally went to join the Kun Thieves. Truly bandits having similar bad tastes/smells. But it shows the Kun Thieves do have some means."

"Kun people have more than just some means. Just talk about the Imperial Edict's so-called banning Kun and stopping markets. Which article really fell into place and hit the Kun people's sore foot? "The clerk who answered picked the tea leaves on the bowl lid, putting on a posture of mystifying deliberately: "Do you know, the southern fresh fruits purchased by the Directorate for Imperial Food for the Great Within in recent years are actually all Australian canned food that violates the ban. Those unused in the Palace are taken out for sale. A small can of syrup lychee is worth eight or nine taels of silver, equaling our food and salary for a year, and supply still falls short of demand. The huge profit in this is all carved up by Kun people partnering with the officials in the palace (eunuchs). This situation is unknown to the outside, but who in the Palace doesn't know? Except... the Holy Son of Heaven's heart is tied to the world, presumably he can't pay attention to such trivial matters."

The discussion in the tea house became more and more heated; the shopkeeper came out several times to dissuade but to no avail. Seeing that no one was listening to the reading anymore, and he was tired of reading, the middle-aged scholar returned the newspaper booklet to the young man, fished out a small tin wine pot from his bosom, poured some wine into the tea soup bowl, drank it all in one gulp, and sighed: "Beautiful!" Then he called the Tea Doctor to settle the tea soup money. The peculiar sweet fragrance emitted by the wine attracted the attention of the young Tribute Student. He tried hard to recall this once familiar smell, but the arguing sound of the middle-aged scholar and the Tea Doctor rang in his ears.

"...How can you say we are greedy? You old gentleman can read newspapers, is it possible you don't know the current market? Ever since the Court ordered the ban on selling Kun goods, prices of everything in the Capital have soared. Not to mention other fruit pastries used in this tea soup, just the brown sugar and white sugar used, each jin has risen by three to five cents of silver..."
