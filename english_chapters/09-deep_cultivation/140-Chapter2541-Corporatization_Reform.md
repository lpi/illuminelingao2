# Chapter 2541: Corporatization Reform

He took people to the Ancestral Hall. Looking at the sign of the Nansha Village Office, he frowned. Two young men beside him were about to go up and take down the sign. Chen Ding shook his head slightly. Chen Lin understood and waved his hand to stop them immediately. Addressing the few local braves standing guard at the gate:

"No need for you to stand guard here. All go back."

The local braves were originally somewhat puzzled, not knowing what matter caused such a big array. Seeing Chen Lin walking in front, followed by Chen clan members, aggressive and menacing, they couldn't help getting stage fright. Chen Xuan had been invited to the county seat these few days. Without this backbone, no one knew what to do.

Wu Quan hurried out from the gatehouse, greeted them, and asked: "Ninth Master, this is..."

"Uncle Wu," Chen Lin said with a pleasant countenance, "Second Uncle roared at court and has been stripped of the Baojia position by the county. As for Fengshenghe, it has now returned to the original owner too." After speaking, he signaled the accompanying personnel to bring the court notice.

"Paste up the notice! We go in!"

Taking back the Ancestral Hall was not the police's business, so the police didn't intervene, only standing far away to watch in case conflict occurred. A handsome boy under Chen Lin picked up the notice and was about to paste it on the wall beside the Village Office gate. A young militiaman couldn't hold back long ago, rushed up, grabbed his collar, and threw the lad out. He snatched the notice, tore it to shreds, threw it on the ground, and cursed:

"Want to seize power with a piece of paper? Dream on!" After speaking, he spat again.

Now the Chen clan members following closely behind Chen Lin were angry. One by one waving fists and rolling up sleeves, about to rush up to beat people. The local braves here didn't show weakness either, taking out swords and spears.

Wu Quan squeezed in the middle, busy mediating, shouting high: "Don't move hands!"

Chen Lin however said to Wu Quan: "This Little Brother, I remember he is your relative, right?"

"Yes, yes, is a distant relative of this small old man! Young people have hot tempers!" Wu Quan was busy making peace, sweating all over his head. "Ninth Master, you don't need to rush to take back the ancestral hall this moment. Wait for your Second Uncle to return, you discuss and handle it, won't that do! One stroke cannot write two 'Chen' characters..."

Before Chen Lin spoke, Chen Ding had already brought two police officers over.

"Two messenger lords please look. This notice was just pasted up, and was torn to shreds, and even spat on! Treating the Senate's laws with such contempt, what is the crime?!" Chen Ding said impassionedly. After speaking, he scolded the local braves again, "Whatever, do you want to rebel!"

Seeing the police also came, the local braves knew the matter became big. One by one putting away swords and spears, looking at each other in blank dismay. Didn't know what to do.

The police frowned: "Which one tore it!"

Things done under everyone's eyes couldn't be denied. Two police officers immediately threw out a police rope and tied up this young man.

Wu Quan was most experienced, understanding long ago that this was a trap set by the Chen family waiting for them to drill into. Yet his distant relative fell unbiasedly right into the trap. Immediately begged Chen Lin: "Ninth Master! Do good deeds! Raise your hand high! This child is just rash, no heart [schemes]..."

Chen Lin was in the village; every time he entered or exited the office, this young man treated him vaguely with hostility, words carrying spears and sticks. He seemed to laugh it off, but already held a grudge in his heart. At this moment, intending to fiercely kill the prestige of the local braves kept by Second Uncle, he immediately sneered: "This matter originally has nothing to do with you. Since he wants to jump out to oppose the County Government, oppose the Senate, I have no method either. After all, I am just a small commoner like him! Since ancient times, official hearts are like iron, King's Law is like a furnace. Only pray he is a lucky person!" After speaking, he didn't entangle with Wu Quan anymore, saying: "We go in!" Then he pointed at the local braves, "You, immediately hand over swords and spears to Third Uncle Chen here. This month's monthly money will be issued as usual! Those from this village, go home properly to do your business; those not from this village, return to your native places. There is no grain and rice for you to eat for free here!"

After speaking, he led people to stride straight into the Village Office.

Uncle and Nephew Chen struck with thunder, instantly retaking the Nansha village administration and clan power. Chen Xuan was drinking and dining in the county seat. Receiving this news, he simply didn't even show his face, disappearing without a trace directly. Chen Lin felt carefree in his heart—although he was young and couldn't be Clan Leader, Third Uncle became "Head of Case" under his recommendation. To guard against accidents, a new Clan Leader was nominated.

Subsequently, according to Australian law, the Chen Clan held a "Shareholders' Meeting" for clan property reform. Originally, the opinion within the clan was based on "Branch," but after some research, Mr. Lu discovered the relevant law stipulated it based on "Male Head" [Ding/Male adult], and it had to be equal distribution.

This way, there were different opinions within the clan. If based on person/male head, truly whichever family had more males now would take advantage, and fewer males would suffer loss. Regardless of whether you were from which branch or which lineage, eldest branch or direct descent, none mattered.

After a round of argument, finally, unable to fight the government in power, all "Male Heads" in the clan, regardless of age, distributed equally, each getting one share of clan property houses and fields as shares.

Chen Lin immediately expressed that the one share belonging to the Chen family in the Nansha Demonstration Cotton Textile Factory invested by Master Wu would also be added to the Clan Company assets. The proceeds obtained would be distributed according to the shares occupied by everyone.

Because a company was established, expenses for clan house maintenance, supporting widowers, widows, and orphans were all spent within the company's cost account. All had detailed items. Anything exceeding the scope was all spent by each "Male Head" from their own dividends; the company would not subsidize separately.

In this way, the control and distribution rights of clan elders over clan property were significantly reduced, and clan property was also completely listed under tax supervision.

After the Corporatization Reform, carrying the lingering prestige of the lawsuit, Chen Lin became the General Manager of Nansha Chen Clan Co., Ltd., while the Clan Leader served as Chairman. The cotton textile factory land requisition work, which originally fell into stagnation, also became smooth. Chen Lin used the "Issuance of Non-Preferred Shares" according to Company Law, paying land requisition costs with stocks. At the same time, he also promised that once the cotton textile factory was built, children of these families would be prioritized for admission to work in the factory.

Because the Nansha Chen family was the first in Xiangshan County to complete the clan "Corporatization" reform, they received a commendation from the county. A "Commemorative Certificate" was specially issued for this land right confirmation. When Li Yao'er returned from the county, Chen Lin hurried to visit again, pounding his chest in the name of the General Manager of "Nansha Chen Clan Co., Ltd." and the boss of "Fengshenghe" Silk Factory, willing to "unconditionally cooperate with sericulture improvement work."

After Nansha was disturbed by the Chen family this time, the situation instantly opened up. Whether Li Yao'er or the internship group, everyone felt things were handy. The civil construction of Nansha Textile Factory also entered the implementation stage: excavating water channels.

Although installing a water wheel directly on the river channel was possible, safety was poor: easily damaged by collision of ships or floating objects in the river channel. When river flow velocity was too large, water flow couldn't be regulated either. So the water turbine was actually installed inside a water wheel pit in a diversion channel parallel to the river channel.

The construction engineering team dispatched from Guangzhou, according to the topography and landforms surveyed beforehand by the internship group, drove many small wooden stakes at the construction site. Subsequently, the civil construction team formed by recruited Nansha villagers began excavating channels. The first to be dug well was the tailrace, used to discharge seepage generated during earthwork engineering.

After the tailrace was completed, the civil construction team excavated the water wheel pit under Zou Feng's guidance. The bottom of this water wheel pit was paved with wooden boards to reduce friction, accelerate water diversion, and avoid water flow washing away the soil on both side walls. Subsequently, he began guiding the construction of the curved section [breast], built with wooden ribs and boards, fixed in the water wheel pit. The gaps generated inside the curved section were filled with stones, finally sealed with wooden boards.

Factory Bay had a natural water potential drop, so Zou Feng omitted the biggest part of the original water channel project: building an overflow dam [weir] to raise the upstream water level. Calculated, the natural terrain drop at this river bend was enough to generate sufficient kinetic energy to drive the water wheel. If an overflow dam were to be built, it would involve a series of projects like building cofferdams.

The progress of the diversion channel was very fast. The bottom of the water channel was lined with stones and cement. The place adjacent to the river channel was not dug open for the time being, but a simple sluice gate was built to control water flow in and out. When the project was busy until nearly summer, a batch of technicians and equipment came from Lingao—they came to assemble the water turbine.

The water turbine was actually a very unfamiliar technology to the Senators [Wait, text says "Unfamiliar to Senators"? Original: "对元老们来说其实一项十分陌生的技术". This is odd since they designed it. Likely means "To the Ming people/natives"? OR it means "Even to Senators, it's old tech they don't see often"]. Because China had never introduced modern water turbines. Fortunately, its structure and principle were very simple, and requirements for materials were not high. Recovery was relatively easy. No Senator was needed to command on site during installation.

The gap between the water wheel and the "curved section" of the water wheel pit should be as small as possible, but not so small that they rub against each other. So before installation, all accessories were left with a certain margin. On site, dimensions and shapes of all accessories had to be carefully measured by technicians before cutting and installation began.

Workers first installed the main shaft of the water turbine. This was a heavy wooden shaft made of multiple timbers spliced together and bound with iron hoops, using composite mast technology. Both ends of the wooden shaft were iron journals fixed with iron hoops, inserted into cast iron bearings on both sides of the water wheel pit. The cast iron bearing was just a shell; the inside was originally a bronze sliding bearing. But here, large ball bearings were adopted. The benefit of switching to ball bearings was self-evident: reduced friction, significantly improving the operation efficiency of the water turbine.

After carefully calibrating the level, workers installed the main shaft. Subsequently, they installed spokes into pre-cut slots on the wooden shaft. The wheel rim of the water wheel was pieced together by piece after piece of thick wooden boards. The wheel rim was installed at the top ends of the spokes. Finally, technicians chiseled fine slots on the thick wooden boards of the wheel rim and inserted wooden blades. Before each blade was inserted, two small holes were drilled on it, and the inner side of the small holes was covered with leather fixed at one end. This was actually a simple one-way valve. When water flowed into the bucket, the valve closed automatically; when water flowed out, the valve opened to avoid internal vacuum formed when the bucket rose from the water wheel pit. Vacuum would hinder water discharge and affect operation efficiency.
