# Chapter 2645: The Capital (Part 1)

Thinking Taoist Wood Stone back then laid out in Guangzhou, setting down Feng Shui Great Formation, planning to ruin Kun Thieves' King Qi. Didn't expect finally still broken by Kun Thieves. Thinking again that what thing "New Taoism" spreading everywhere now... Maybe truly learned some Overseas Strange Gates Escaping Armor (*Qi Men Dun Jia*) Arts...

Thinking here, he erected ears carefully listened down. Wanted to know this one exactly had what high view. Didn't expect this person was a layperson. Pulling East tearing West. Just no "Dry Goods" (real stuff). Luo Heying listened a few sentences knew he was no more than frightening words to scare people (*Wei Yan Song Ting*). Had no real material. Unconsciously slightly somewhat disappointed.

Evening he treated this matter as joke discussed with Gou Xunli. Didn't expect this old treacherous giant slippery guy actually narrowed eyes. Started stroking his that few rat whiskers.

"True Fake no hindrance. Having a talk topic is fine..." Walrus Monk low voice said.

"Master's meaning is?"

"Kun Thieves coming local wave瀾 not shocked (calm). Local folks have no ill feeling to them. Instead quite some people obtained their benefit. So me, we purely saying God's Decree wanting to do Kun Thieves, that is not walking through."

"This naturally." Luo Heying nodded, "Even if going, is also exerting work not exerting strength."

"So must have an evil deed letting folks filled with indignation."

"Evil deed?" Luo Heying thought a bit. Thought local hasn't been slaughtered by Kun Thieves before. Speaking "Evil Deed," that truly couldn't think up. Even though some political orders common people dissatisfied, also haven't reached stage capable of letting them lift pole and rise.

"None then help Kun Thieves a handful." Gou Xunli at this moment already thought properly. Immediately low voice said, "Didn't they repair camp leveling Charity Cemetery land?"

"Right. But gave landlord money. Grave although leveled, having owner all gave money to relocate. Ownerless bones also unified collected..." Luo Heying speaking here suddenly understood something, "You are saying?"

"Stealing grave digging tomb, is Ten Evils Unpardonable. Also closely related to local common people gentry. So, we only need like this..."

Luo Heying finished listening sucked a mouth cold air: "This is also too lacking virtue right. In case letting Li Family know that's terrible."

"Naturally need to do confidentially only fresh." Gou Xunli sneered, "You rest heart. This matter naturally someone will go do. You only need to grasp timing well is fine."

Luo Heying couldn't help asking: "Timing, timing, this timing exactly when only arrive?"

Hearing this words, Gou Xunli double eyes looking at sky. Half while only then sighed: "You ask me, I also don't know! I this waiting then is ten years!"

Luo Heying just wanted to curse X. Gou Xunli said again: "You don't anxious. Left Right just is matter of these few months. You rest heart. Taoist Wood Stone said, as long as have suitable chance, can move hand!"

Luo Heying said: "If speaking suitable chance, right now is."

One comes currently Australians just repairing road repairing stockade. Everywhere digging earth excavating ground. Wanting to frame stealing grave digging tomb exactly suitable; Two comes previous stage Puppet Troupe coming to Li Family Enclosure to perform just performing in Xiaoyao Market.

Attacking stockade not necessarily can succeed. But attacking Troupe living in Market Hotel that is matter of hand reaching grabbing coming.

"This Puppet Troupe is handled up by Kun Thieves single handedly. If taking this chance exterminating them, Kun Thieves must be greatly angry."

Gou Xunli silently nodded. Thought in heart this person truly had some strategy. Not reckless martial man.

Taoist Wood Stone actually already handed bottom to him. That was Court South Down Punishing Kun Thieves already became set situation. Although no bright decree, but Cabinet and Emperor both already made determination. Within recent two three months must have action.

Just this action, exactly when only would arrive. I wait like long drought land, all expecting sweet rain ah!

**Capital**

**Chongzhen Ninth Year Twelfth Month First Day (December 27, 1636)**

Time already near Xu Hour (7-9 PM). Huge Beijing City already fell into a patch of silence. Because East Barbarians (*Dong Lu*) entering border in July. Soldier edge consecutively conquered Changping, Liangxiang, Shunyi. Soldier edge straight pointed Capital City. Capital City one month several alarms. Now East Barbarians although already retreated. But refugees generated by this still had many detaining inside city. Public security inside city not peaceful. Government strictly practiced Night Ban. Night markets and places of prostitution inside city outside city, now were also quiet quietly. Could only vaguely hear striking watch clapper sound transmitted from distance. Inside city outside city a patch of darkness. Appearing especially gloomy desolate.

Although already entered Twelfth Month (*La Yue*), inside city completely no boiling and festivity of Passing New Year. World Way difficult. Common people trapped in livelihood.

Qin Towers Chu Pavilions (Brothels) and Big Households, as usual had banquet singing dancing. But all were covering door courtyard, hanging curtain tent. Light of burning high crimson candles and Australian Oil Lamps not leaking out a bit. Songs of songstresses musicians were all low low. Curling at ears of host and guest. Even they were rarely loud voice speaking. Just whispering chatting.

These few years war matter not favorable. National Momentum declining daily. Emperor's temper was also one day bad over one day. Eunuchs and Depot Guards (Spy Agency) originally rejected few years ago gradually re-shook up prestige again. Although changed a batch of people. Acting style actually still old time familiar flavor. Officials and rich people's pleasure seeking also became obscure much. Avoiding being intentionally transmitted to Emperor front by people. Disturbing his mind state. Attracting Thunder Wrath.

Lantern candle light hanging on Imperial City Gate shaking in wind. Shining on already pitted uneven stone slab road and armor of Big Han Generals (Guards) standing on shift. Faintly emitting light. To owner here, Chongzhen Ninth Year was a year not counted too bad also not counted how good. Of course, to Emperor, bad news was already normal state. As long as no worse news then counted as Superior Superior Great Luck.

Compared to last year, in First Month Thirteen Families Roving Bandits conquered Fengyang. A fire burned Great Ming's Ancestral Tomb; Second Month Kun Thieves surprise attacked Guangdong. Guangzhou Zhaoqing successively fell. Subsequently lost Two Guangs... Chongzhen Ninth Year's situation still not counted too bad. Best news was Roving Bandits once having Prairie Fire Momentum under suppression of Official Soldiers commanded by Lu Xiangsheng, Hong Chengchou and others, already not repeated former momentum. Especially July this year, "Giant Canal" (Ring leader) Gao Yingxiang captured. Escorted to Capital then executed. This to Court already burned head rotten forehead (in bad fix) was no less than a Cardiotonic Shot.

However looking far at whole situation, Great Ming's situation didn't turn better. Gao Yingxiang's capture was only strongest one branch in Roving Bandits suffered major setback. Speaking on whole situation, Roving Bandits' activities still extremely frequent. Li Zicheng etc. units active in Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu; Zhang Xianzhong, Ge Zuo Five Battalions, Luo Rucai, Liu Guoneng, Li Wanqing etc. units galloped in vast areas of Henan, Huguang, Anhui. As for small scale "Roving Bandits" "Local Bandits" "Mountain Bandits" "Sea Bandits," swirling rising swirling extinguishing. Just like spark fire. Spreading everywhere. Court attended this lost that. Responding engaging no free time. Everywhere fell into passive state.

East Barbarians outside Shanhai Pass claimed Emperor in current year. Self claimed Manchu. Formally divided court resisted rite with Great Ming. If saying this was no more than empty name, then July Ajige leading Eight Banners Army entering pass looting, actually once again on full eyes sores (devastated) Northern Great Earth fiercely inserted a knife.

Fortunately Kun Thieves conquering Two Guangs last year, shaking court and wild, already stopped step not forward. In whole Chongzhen Ninth Year didn't have any big movement. Seemed they already satisfied with status quo of occupying two provinces.

No matter what Kun Thieves' intention was. As long as not creating incident, to young Emperor, then already was good news.

Now already Twelfth Month. Although Anxious Scenery Withering Year, in Palace according to rule also wanted to have a share of Ostentation. Palace Family Inner Officials packed up Gourd Scenery Patch and Python Robe. Preparing for New Year clothing use; Young Eunuchs and Palace Maids swept Palace Rooms. Craftsmen repaired houses utensils. Peach Talisman Board, General Charcoal, Door God used at New Year; Fortune God, Ghost Judge, Zhong Kui etc. paintings hung indoor. Gold Silver Eight Treasures, Western Tibetan Prayer Wheel, Dragon woven by Yellow Money hung on bed; Eave Pillar inserting Sesame Stalk. Cypress Branch burned in courtyard... All owed objects continuously prepared by Twenty Four Yamens sending into Palace. Usually cold cold clear clear, dead air heavy heavy Palace Halls, at this moment also more or less had some living air.

First Watch clapper already struck. Emperor in Qianqing Palace finally put down Vermilion Sand Pen in hand. Temporarily left memorials piled up like mountain.

Although memorials wouldn't bring him any happiness. Sometimes even source of endless annoyance. But he actually not willing to leave. He had a feeling. As long as himself didn't open memorial to approve read, these memorials would turn into raging flame, swallowing Great Ming River Mountain completely.

Sometimes, he felt self might as well not as a death prisoner. Death prisoner no more than waiting for death merely. And he, actually like a person about to be drowned. Fighting death struggling. Yet even a straw couldn't grab...

"Emperor..." An Imperial Front Eunuch seeing him rise body. Hurriedly grabbed chance to report to him. Today originally wanted to use dinner at Concubine Tian place.

Dinner originally was Shen Hour Second Quarter (3:30 PM). Now already passed Xu Hour First Quarter (7:15 PM). Noble Consort Tian long ago sent several waves Eunuchs to inquire outside Qianqing Palace when Emperor could finish approving reading. But Imperial Front Eunuchs no one dared to come remind Emperor.

"Oh, *Zhen* (I) almost forgot." Chongzhen used palm stroking forehead. Forehead ice cool. Palace Hall tall big. Winter even if approving reading memorials in Warm Pavilion, time long hands feet also same ice cool.

Qianqing Palace Manager Eunuch immediately signaled. Immediately bad Eunuch bringing newly tributed tea. Originally in winter wanting to serve hot tea anytime was extremely difficult. Only method was lighting charcoal stove under corridor anytime. Stewing boiling water only then okay. Since Lingao tributed Thermos Bottle (*Re Shui Ping*). This expenditure of charcoal fire still same as old. Silver however entered Qianqing Palace Manager Eunuch's waist pocket.

"This is Autumn Tea." This cup temperature suitable. Fragrance overflowing tea water. To exhausted Emperor was very suitable (enjoyable). Especially cup in front of eyes. Thin like egg shell. Crystal clear translucent like white jade carved. On top inlaid with Enamel Color Hundred Flowers pattern inlaid by silver wire. Looking very comfortable. Mood also better much. Asked, "Tributed from where?"

"Reply Imperial Master's words. Is Wuyi Mountain Tea coming from Fujian." Manager Eunuch said, "Is Zhongzuo Suo Commander Assistant Zheng Sen offering."

Name Zheng Sen raised a burst of small ripple in his brain. He seemed faint faintly remembering former Fujian Governor Zou Weilian mentioned this name. But he somewhat couldn't think up.

Seeing his face revealed doubtful expression. Eunuch busily low voice reminded: "Is late Dudu Tongzhi Zheng Zhilong's son. Now also inherited hereditary post..."
