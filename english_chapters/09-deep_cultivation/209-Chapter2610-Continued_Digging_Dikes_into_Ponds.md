# Chapter 2610: Continued Digging Dikes into Ponds

"Ashamed, ashamed. My family has established a base in Xiangshan for three generations. Thanks to the benevolence of ancestors, we now have a small family business in Xiangshan. We also want to leave some eternal family business for descendants."

What Chen Wuren said was naturally fabricated, but the emotion when he said it was real. Once upon a time, he had also dreamed that he was the person "creating a foundation for descendants."

It was just that the later social reality broke his family and destroyed him. Let alone "for descendants," even he himself almost lost his life. He was almost "without descendants," and finally walked onto another completely different path.

Although he walked onto the path of "serving the Senate and the people," in his bones, he still felt nostalgic for the past, so these words were spoken with true feelings and sincerity.

Guan Youde didn't know the inside story. Listening to his words, he regarded him as a kindred spirit and felt very close. He praised greatly:

"With you, Master, presiding over it, presumably the Xiangshan Chen family will surely spread branches and leaves, continuing for a long time."

Having good feelings, he was afraid of not being detailed enough in his introduction.

Counties like Nanhai, Shunde, and Xiangshan mostly had dike enclosures around places near the Pearl River waters to resist waterlogging. Dike enclosures were mainly built relying on higher hills. Early agriculture was carried out on highlands within the enclosure, while large areas of water were still retained within the enclosure. The development trend since the Ming and Qing had been to gradually drain accumulated water within the enclosure to open up farmland. Due to the low-lying terrain and serious waterlogging, ordinary rice field harvests were poor. Therefore, digging dikes to form ponds could both utilize water sources and raise land for planting crops, beneficial for solving the reclamation problem of lowlands within the enclosure. It was a choice landlords were quite happy with.

What Guan Youde called "digging dikes" was also called "chiseling and building," the core step of opening up mulberry dike fish ponds. The part of the low-lying rice field dug deep became the "pond," and the dug-out mud was piled up into a "dike" significantly higher than the ground. The dike surface was about three *chi* above water. It took eighty, ninety to one hundred labor days per *mu* of land to build, costing eleven or twelve *taels* of silver.

This business model, which had a considerable color of modern organic agriculture, although highly profitable after construction, had huge labor costs. Families without power could not do it. If the head of the family couldn't manage it personally, it couldn't play a big role either. So from its inception, it had the color of agricultural capital management. It not only required a large amount of monetary investment but also required careful management by the operator, and exploration and learning of agricultural production and breeding technologies. This was far from a business model that tenants, small producers, and tenant landlords could touch.

The Senate's special attention to mulberry dike fish ponds was not limited to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; it was also a work the Administration Council was very interested in. There was a vague meaning of "political task." Specially sending Senators to visit and promote also included the intention to use this model to cultivate new "farm owners"—after all, Guangdong in this timeline was still very empty, and even the Pearl River Delta had large areas available for development. It was just suitable for such intensive farming type small farm production.

Zhang Xiao didn't know the Senate had so many complex considerations. The only thing he understood was that promoting these technologies was conducive to agricultural development, "producing more grain," and "improving people's living standards."

Limited by fertilizers in ancient rural areas, the ratio of dikes to ponds in mulberry dike fish ponds in the Jiujiang area was always maintained at forty-sixty. Taking ten *mu* as a unit for dike-ponds, six *mu* were mulberry dikes and four *mu* were pond surfaces, named Four Waters Six Dikes. Ponds averaging ten *mu* were the majority because it was exactly the area one laborer could manage. The largest were seventeen or eighteen *mu*, and there were also small ones of four or five *mu*.

Chen Wuren said there were dozens of *mu* of low-yield fields in the clan to reform. The cost required should be no less than hundreds of taels of silver, definitely not something ordinary families could bear. No wonder Guan Youde called it a "big move."

This Master Chen mentioned reforming fish ponds lightly, obviously not taking the word "money" to heart at all. Guan Youde couldn't help feeling a trace of distinctive contempt for Chen Wuren's group in his heart. The Chen clan who could afford hundreds of taels of silver to dig dikes should be a top-tier big household in Xiangshan, yet they claimed kinship with Mo Yu, this former Dan household. Truly, "poor in the busy city, no one asks; rich in deep mountains, have distant relatives." Once the Australians came, every Tom, Dick, and Harry shook themselves up. Even big households rushed to build relationships with them; there was no lack of such people locally. Even the Dan families, who were originally very "sensible" and "humble," now seemed to "straighten their backs" quite a bit in front of them.

Guan Youde didn't despise Dan families in the past, nor did he allow clansmen to bully Dan families. But his giving kindness and "bestowing favor" was one thing; the other party being "arrogant" was another matter. This made Guan Youde somewhat unhappy in his heart.

"Is Brother Guan a Zhuangjia?" Chen Wuren asked.

"That was before; stopped doing it long ago," Guan Youde said. "But I am still clear about the tricks of the fish farming trade."

"Wonder what exquisite points there are in digging dikes?"

"The exquisite points in here are big." Guan Youde said, "Fish ponds should be east-west oriented; the 'Sun' (日) character shape is best."

"What is the reason?"

"If rainstorms come suddenly in summer and autumn, when rain stops, fish swim to the water surface to breathe air. Clear water should be poured in to cool them. If care is not taken in time, they will all die before long. The 'Sun' shaped fish pond is beneficial for injecting water, but water waves erode pond dikes. Plus, with fish ponds frequently irrigating and draining, water levels change easily, and pond dikes alternate between dry and wet, making them easy to collapse. Therefore, wooden stakes and piles should be built at the transition between the pond dike and water surface to protect the pond dike."

"How to inject water?" Chen Wuren didn't quite understand.

"Hehe, Mr. Chen doesn't know," Guan Youde laughed. "Dike-pond site selection also has exquisite points. Dike-ponds should set up two water sluices to communicate with the river creek flow. The one at the pond waist is the Upper Sluice; the one at the pond bottom is the Bottom Sluice. Ponds close to river creeks and easy for drainage and irrigation are Head Tube Ponds. Those that can pass water from neighboring ponds are Second Tube Ponds. Those with water sources but no outlets are Sky-Gazing Ponds. Those with outlets but no sluice gates are Wild Ponds. Wild ponds can only plant gorgon fruit, mushroom, water chestnut, and lotus root; their mud is the leanest. For fish ponds, Head Tube Ponds are convenient, and rent is more expensive. Second Tube Ponds are blocked by ponds before releasing water; they must wait for Head Tube Ponds to drain the bottom and catch fish and put mud up first before they can borrow their ponds to release water, so the rent price must be reduced."

Only then did Chen Wuren recall that the fish ponds seen along the way were not next to each other like ice cube trays, but there were many small creeks connected to big creeks existing between fish ponds. So this was the function.

"It's just, what drives this drainage and irrigation? Could it be waterwheels?" Chen Wuren still had points he didn't understand. If relying on manpower to wheel water, the cost of raising fish would be high. Naturally, he had seen the Senate's big windmills for pumping water. If the Chiefs lost their temper and set up a few steam engines to pump water, it wasn't impossible, just that tofu would cost the price of meat; inevitably not worthwhile.

Guan Youde said, "Correct, and incorrect."

"Oh?" The investigation team all looked puzzled.

"I won't keep you in suspense. Saying correct is because every winter or the spring of the next year, the pond must be drained once. The method is to follow the water node, open the Bottom Sluice to release pond water, leaving remaining water about one *chi* or several *cun*. The Bottom Sluice is only opened when releasing water; on ordinary days, it is plugged solid with mulberry branches and old grass. Then dig a pit near the sluice inside the pond to wheel water. The method of wheeling water: the wheel head faces up, the wheel tail drags obliquely on the water surface, using three or four people on the frame to tread the wheel. Saying incorrect is because draining the pond and wheeling water consumes time and effort, and also disturbs fish growth. On ordinary days, it relies on the ebb and flow of tides. Tides grow on the first day of the lunar month and disappear by the fourth; grow on the fifteenth and disappear by the eighteenth. This is the so-called Water Head. disappearing on the fourth until the fourteenth, and disappearing on the eighteenth until the twenty-ninth or thirtieth is called Water Tail. In spring and summer, the Water Head is big, prevailing during the day; in autumn and winter, the Water Head is small, prevailing at night. The Upper Sluice on the pond waist has a gate. If pond water is too fertile and salty, green skin will inevitably appear on the water surface. Then the Upper Sluice should be opened to release several *cun* of salty water and exchange in fresh water. Or if pond water is shallow, it is also suitable to add fresh water inside according to the method, until it's sufficient. If pond water is too full, it should be released, always moderated to medium depth." Guan Youde explained the method of changing water roughly in one breath.

The Tiandihui cadres marveled secretly in their hearts. They didn't expect Jiujiang villagers to have groped out such a method of utilizing natural conditions to maintain fish pond water quality. Truly, they obtained favorable timing and geographical position.

Thinking carefully, this was very similar to the content about fish pond water quality they learned during Tiandihui training. It was just that compared to knowledge in books, this experience accumulated through practice was more grounded and operable.

Only then did everyone understand how Jiujiang's crisscrossing river network came about. Locals divided rivers into different levels according to water surface width. The main stream of the West River and its tributaries became "Sea." From Jiujiang Village center to Moyunjixun was called Li Hai (Inner Sea). Below Tiejiao was called Dong Hai (East Sea). The second level was called "Yong" (Creek/Chong) and "Jiao". These were all river ports connected to tides.

There were many small enclosures within the Sangyuan Enclosure, such as Yudai Enclosure, protecting forty-six *qing* of mulberry land and fish ponds inside, with more than four thousand three hundred households. Outside the dike of these small enclosures were river creeks; inside the dike were patches of dike-ponds. Sluices were generally set on the dikes of small enclosures to satisfy the drainage and irrigation needs of a dike-pond are. The main function of sluices and enclosure dikes was flood control in spring and summer. Jiujiang had few fields and many ponds. Outside ponds, moats (*Qian*) were dug; outside moats, creeks (*Yong*) were opened. Sluices were set at all port creek mouths, opened and closed according to timing. Usually, if pond water was shallow, water was led into the pond; if pond water was full, water was guided out to the creek. Once spring and summer floods occurred, sluice boards were lowered to prevent them, pasting bamboo stalks outside to make it firm and dense, so as not to flood the fish ponds.

"*Qian*" (Moat) is the small waterway within the dike-pond area. This kind of small waterway was dug to meet the needs of dike-pond daily drainage and irrigation during the process of continuously adding and digging dike-ponds. The large number of artificial small river channel "moats" in the dike-pond area was the terminal water system of the Jiujiang river network. Moats communicated with river creek flow. River creek water could be diverted for automatic drainage and irrigation through the small water sluices of dike-ponds.

While mulberry dike fish ponds in the Jiujiang area were constantly increasing, the original wide water area within the enclosure was divided by ponds. The water area of some main river channels was also gradually encroached upon by dike-ponds and shrank. The Jiujiang Creek "Li Hai," which was twenty-eight *zhang* wide in the Ming Dynasty, was thus "occupied from sea into ponds." By the end of the Qing Dynasty, the specific location it once flowed through could no longer be verified.

The Fish Fry Market wasn't big. Most people in the market were dealers coming to book fish fry. There were familiar faces and strange faces. Chen Wuren's group was naturally regarded as new fish dealers.
