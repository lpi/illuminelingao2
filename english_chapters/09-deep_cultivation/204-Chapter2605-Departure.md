# Chapter 2605: Departure

"You wish. Those iron roosters at the Finance and Taxation Bureau probably won't agree so easily." Li Yao'er laughed.

"Finance and Taxation Bureau? Hehe..." Zhang Xiao laughed too. "I went to find Wang Qiyi. Although people in the Senate always criticize the tax farming system, one has to admit that in certain places now, it really can only be tax farming, otherwise you won't collect a single wen. Director Wang said collecting taxes in rural markets is very dangerous. His finance and taxation cadres' lives are relatively valuable, so they won't be the birds that stick their necks out to pave the way. Anyway, where your administrative power can't reach, they can't collect money."

Li Yao'er said, "This old fox. So that means they still have a lot of taxes uncollected. As long as you can get the money, the funding problem is solved."

"Exactly. The biggest problem now is still the problem of state power going to the countryside." Zhang Xiao said, "Wang Qiyi did offer some suggestions. Simply put, it's 'one principle, two aspects, four means.' One principle is to smash the clans. Two aspects: One is the effectively controlled areas; where conditions permit, we must advance our goals. The other is non-effectively controlled areas; we must adapt to local conditions, make the best use of everything, and use clan power to complete tasks. Four means: First, ruthlessly strike those who don't follow our plans and policies and don't move closer to us, promoting the disintegration of clans; second, protect and guide well those moving closer to us, promoting their transformation; third, give local cadres some space, don't issue forced orders, let them carry out work according to their actual conditions; fourth, protect those cadres whose methods are a bit radical in their work—if they can't stay, the vast colonies in the south offer plenty of scope."

It was quite ironic. Since the Senate landed on the mainland and realized the Two Guangs Strategy, the tone towards clans had lowered a lot. It dropped from the original "shouting to fight and kill" to a moderate tone of "reasonable control, effective utilization, gradual transformation."

The so-called "one principle," self-evidently, was "in principle...", followed by a "but starting from reality...". The administrative Senators understood this tacitly among themselves.

The reason why the Senate suddenly became "soft" was self-evident. Clan autonomy is a low-cost grassroots governance model, which is particularly attractive to a government with insufficient resources. Carrying out "plugging all the way to the bottom" grassroots governance, for the Senate, meant having neither enough financial power nor enough manpower.

Li Yao'er could only describe Zhang Xiao's current speech and deportment with "scrub your eyes and look at the scholar who has been away for three days." She didn't expect this Senator who was originally bent on technology to adapt to the new role so quickly after becoming the county magistrate, looking quite the part. As the saying goes, "He who is not in the position does not scheme for its governance"; it seemed not false at all.

"How did you arrange the inspection route?" Li Yao'er asked.

"Jiujiang, Longshan, Longjiang area, which is the area east and south of Xiqiao Mountain, inside the Sangyuan Enclosure."

Li Yao'er was a bit puzzled. "Aren't Longshan and Longjiang under the jurisdiction of Shunde County? Isn't it inappropriate for us to go directly without saying hello?"

Zhang Xiao said, "See, Director Xiao is farsighted. Besides this post of Executive Deputy Magistrate of Nanhai County, I also hold the title of Inspector of Guangzhou Special City, facilitating me to express opinions in other county jurisdictions. I just need to report to Prefect Liu. Besides, on this trip out, we already planned to bring many cadres. If we bring Shunde's people along too, I'm afraid looking at too many people will affect the inspection instead."

Zhao Hening still had a child's temperament. Hearing she could go out, she was immediately tempted. But hearing Zhang Xiao meant there were too many people, she feared they would leave her in Guangzhou. Holding Li Yao'er's hand, as if coquettishly, she pleaded, "Chief, I'm a good hand at raising silkworms. You must bring me along!"

Li Yao'er said, " I knew you wanted to go. Don't worry, just this little thought of yours."

"Really!" Zhao Hening got excited. "Then I'll go back to prepare first!" After speaking, she ran away in a puff of smoke.

Li Yao'er couldn't help glancing at Zhang Xiao. She didn't have much contact with Zhang Xiao, but this person seemed very odd to her. Which man who transmigrated didn't want to build a harem and be a stud? In the first two years, the Senate's foundation was shallow; because no maids were distributed, a "Maid Revolution" even occurred. Later, conditions improved, and warmth and fullness led to lustful thoughts; even her husband Mei Fa was no exception. Back then, for the convenience of work, she wanted to move from the apartment in Bairen New City to the Agricultural Committee apartment. After a day and night of negotiation with Mei Fa, they reached an agreement on the condition that the number of maids he could purchase increased from two to four. Zhang Xiao was very strange. For so many years, she heard he stayed away from women and men alike. The reputation of "The Last Luddite" (pun on Lu Dang - masturbation party?) was out there. It was hard to imagine how a normal man got through these years.

*Could he have a physiological defect?* But looking at the sturdy beard on his chin, Li Yao'er didn't think he looked like a eunuch. *Could he be waiting for someone?*

Thinking of this, Li Yao'er couldn't help reminding Zhang Xiao, "I'm warning you first. Do not aim at Hening, you kid. She is Zhao Yingong's goddaughter."

Hearing Li Yao'er warn so, Zhang Xiao was also a bit surprised, playing slippery with his mouth, "Goddaughter, even a real daughter isn't impossible. At most I suffer a bit and call him father-in-law, hahaha... I'm joking."

After receiving Zhang Xiao's notification, various departments of Nanhai County quickly arranged personnel to go down to the grassroots for inspection. If not the number one chief, it was the number two deputy. They started preparatory work one after another. Travelers were also required to formulate detailed inspection plans.

Because this inspection, besides the Mulberry Dike, also involved a major event for Nanhai County, which was to inspect the location for moving the county seat. Currently, both Nanhai and Panyu counties were attached counties (seats located in the prefectural city), and their county agencies were all inside Guangzhou City. Rather than county governments, they were more like district governments. Their radiation power to the vast rural areas was too small. For some remote villages and towns, coming to the county to handle affairs required traveling a long way, causing many inconveniences.

Although Zhang Xiao came from a technical background and didn't have deep administrative experience as a foundation, managing modern pharmaceutical factories in the Senate system well and organizing drug projects from laboratory to large-scale production wasn't just about poking glass jars and burning alcohol lamps. Even if the ideal of a Communist society was realized, people doing things still had to face three fundamental difficulties: insufficient time, limited resources, and the need for collaboration. This is the limitation of the human species.

Where do hundreds and thousands of raw and auxiliary materials, reagents and consumables, and internal packaging materials come from? How to coordinate upstream and downstream relationships? How to set quality standards? How to cry poverty to the Planning Academy? How to deal with the Planning Department's nonsense?

How to choose the process route? How to realize it? If it can't be realized, how to tackle the key problem? Lacking modern instruments, how to ensure analytical methods are reliable and stable? How to transfer?

What technical indicators do process equipment, utility systems, and production workshops need to achieve? If not explained clearly to the Ministry of Machinery, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Ministry of Metallurgy, and Ministry of Light Industry, a wrong interface could result in scrapping and starting over.

While conducting process development and scale-up, how to determine the clinical trial protocol? How to carry out double-blind control trials? How to collect, count, and analyze clinical data? Although the Senate didn't have institutions like FDA or CFDA pressing down, human life was at stake. In the future, Senators themselves would have to rely on these drugs to extend their lives, so there couldn't be the slightest carelessness.

After large-scale production, how to plan production? How to schedule operations? How to plan equipment maintenance? If the chain dropped in any link, the consequence would be either running out of steam halfway through production, or discovering lack of disinfection only after production started, or maybe discovering no materials available only when receiving production orders... Why are workers the most organized group? The reason lies here.

And the most fatal problem was the lack of technical talent. At the beginning, Senators had to do it themselves, with naturalized workers and students helping out. With no basic knowledge, Senators had to chew the knowledge and feed it down; with no practical experience, Senators had to demonstrate hand in hand; with no safety awareness, Senators had to risk their lives ensuring safety with this group of illiterate and semi-illiterate people. But this process was also a process of discovering and cultivating talents. If potential technical cadres couldn't be found, the burden on Senators wouldn't be lightened for a moment. After selecting potential stocks, how to cultivate them? How to make them grow quickly into cadres who could stand alone? This became a big stone in the hearts of technical Senators... Therefore, most technical Senators had practiced a pair of "Fiery Golden Eyes" for knowing people, and a "Sunflower Manual" for training and using people. Cha Wuchu often said Zhang Xiao was an all-rounder.

The phrase Zhang Xiao often hung on his lips was "An incompetent general exhausts the three armies to death." Reporting the progress of various drug projects to Zhang Xiao at the weekly project meeting was absolutely a nightmare for naturalized cadres. Zhang Xiao understood, but the people below might not necessarily understand. The questions asked were often concepts the cadres had no idea about. Not knowing once didn't matter; go strictly to the reference room to study afterwards. If it was still unclear at the next meeting, wait to be criticized. When the project advanced to the later stage, the involvement was often very broad. Zhang Xiao asked about everything in detail, and the leaders of various directions couldn't know all the information at lower levels. Out of the mentality of not wanting to bear responsibility, some learned to bring subordinates to the meeting to answer if there was anything. Gradually, there were more and more attendees. Zhang Xiao was so angry he cursed loudly, demanding that leaders of various directions not bring others to the meeting; they must be responsible themselves. Those who couldn't figure it out should figure it out before coming. Whoever could figure it out would be the cadre. Technical Senators who couldn't do these things had long left the industrial field to seek other outlets.

All these various things made the requirements for drug project leaders very harsh. They must be all-around players, have ideals and beliefs, and must hold high positions; otherwise, the project simply couldn't be pushed. It is no exaggeration to say that modern drugs are the brightest pearl on the crown of the Senate's industrial system.
