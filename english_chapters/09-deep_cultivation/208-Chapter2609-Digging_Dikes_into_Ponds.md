# Chapter 2609: Digging Dikes into Ponds

Jiujiang Township had monopolized the fish fry fishing rights of the West River since the Hongzhi reign, thus forming a quite thriving freshwater fish farming industry chain. The inspection task Zhang Xiao arranged for Chen Wuren was to deeply understand the local fish fry farming industry. Before dawn, Chen Wuren and cadres from the Agriculture Bureau put on wigs and civilian clothes and took a small boat led by Mo Yu to the surrounding Fish Fry Market—market days were different for different markets.

Due to the market license system of the Ming Dynasty, there were numerous markets in various places that were not seen in local gazetteers. As for the reason: many markets were not legal.

Only when the market owner applied for a license and managed the market was it legal and could be recognized openly or secretly by the local government and written into the local gazetteer. This was the tax farming system opposed by many in the Senate. Naturally, quite a few market owners collected rent and tax just the same without obtaining a government license at all. These people were all those with strong backgrounds whom local officials often dared not offend.

Yuewan Market, Longyong Market, and Liangcun Market, which already existed in the Wanli period, did not appear in the Wanli *Nanhai County Gazetteer* or even the later Chongzhen edition county gazetteer, yet the market founders Chen Dacan and Huang Xianfu were high officials in the Wanli period.

In the 28th year of Jiajing, Xiang Qiao, Left Administration Vice Commissioner of the the Lingnan Circuit of the Guangdong Provincial Administration Commission, promulgated the decree of "Banning Market Owners to Benefit Citizens." He believed that the court had established a customs tax system, and tax stations in Wuzhou Prefecture, Nanxiong Prefecture, and other places levied tariffs on passing goods, so the profits of small markets should not be encroached upon anymore. However, governments at all levels issued licenses to market owners, collected certain fees, and allowed market owners to collect ground rent for market venues or take a percentage from passing goods.

Judging from his proposition, the intention was naturally excellent, and the starting point was to reduce the burden on the people. To put it bluntly, whether it was called percentage cut, ground rent, hygiene fee, or stall fee, the resulting costs would eventually be passed on to consumers.

But the prosperity of markets, to put it bluntly, was the demand of the market economy. This could not be changed by a simple ban from the government. The local government also tacitly accepted this behavior that prospered the local economy and increased revenue as usual. Xiang Qiao's decree obviously didn't play any role. At least in the Xiqiao area, the market owner system spread on a large scale.

The Finance and Taxation Bureau was very interested in the market system. To be honest, markets were a handle for tax collection. Only with markets could taxes on various sporadic economic actions be collected. So the couple Wang Qiyi had always been thinking about how to "legalize" market owners.

Zhang Xiao was also very interested because market revenue was an important supplement to local finance in the Ming Dynasty. Only by smoothing out this income could local officials have money to do things.

Mo Yu was formerly a Dan person (boat person). For livelihood, he joined Shi Shisi and lived a life of robbing and licking blood on the blade under Zhu Cailao's banner. Later, he followed Lin Baiguang to defect to Lingao. Because he had some aptitude for mechanics, he became a technical soldier in the navy. However, due to carelessness in operation during a routine exercise causing an accident, he himself suffered a mild disability in his left hand and retired, arranged into the police system for a leisure job. It wasn't until the Senate went north and lacked manpower that disabled people with seniority like him who wanted to do something practical were reactivated.

"Section Chief Chen, you may not believe it if I say it, but whether you believe it or not, my skills underwater are quite first-class. I once held my breath for a minute while active underwater and caught a ten-jin mud carp bare-handed without equipment..."

Mo Yu looked like an ugly version of Su Bingtian but extremely liked to brag ("blow water"). He talked non-stop along the way. Chen Wuren screamed unbearable in his heart, but also learned a lot of useful information from his mouth in advance.

"Starting from March every year, the upstream of the West River rises. Big fish spawn and flow downstream, turning into fish fry at wide river bends with slow water. Dan households along the river have to unite dozens of families to form a team to scrape together enough money to go to Jiujiang to buy fish licenses for fishing, selling to 'Zhuangjia' (Holding Families/Sorters). Jiujiang merchants put fish seed first, counting fish with the left hand and money with the right. They say 'Clouds rise from the creek in April, drowning the Dan family old man.' When fish fry come, it is also when wind and clouds change unpredictably. The wind is urgent, waves are high, and water is big on the West River. One carelessness means destruction of both people and boats. You don't know how miserable our life was when we were Dan people..." recalling the hard days before, Mo Yu couldn't help but sell his misery.

Chen Wuren said, "We are all people fallen to the ends of the earth. Following the Chief counts as following the right person!"

Mo Yu said, "Isn't that right? I am now a serious court official. In the previous dynasty, that was equal to the Jiangpu Patrol Division inspector, rank 9a!"

The group continued to brag for a while.

The division of labor in Jiujiang's fish fry industry was extremely fine. Dan households fished from fish ports. Those who got fish into ponds were called "Zhuangjia." Those who bought fish from "Zhuangjia" into flower ponds and sold them after the fish fry grew up were called "Zaojia" (Making/Rearer Families). Those who bought fish from "Zaojia," raised them in big fish ponds until they were full foot long or until the end of the year, then drained the pond to catch fish and sell perfectly at the market were called "Gengzhongjia" (Farming/Cultivating Families). Zhuangjia were responsible for the primary rearing and classification of fish fry. After the fish fry went into the pool, they could be sold out of the pond after 20 to 30 days of rearing. Since it was summer, they were called Summer Flower (Summer Fry). Zaojia specialized in breeding larger specifications of Summer Flower fish species. Gengzhongjia bought Summer Flowers from Zaojia and sold them after raising the fish to big sizes.

The Fish Fry Market was right next to the river creek, convenient for passing fish fry boats to load fish. Since the catch time for natural fish fry started in March, there were no fish fry for sale in the market yet, but many people had already come to book in advance.

A fish fry boat was docked at the shore. Two indigenous men stood on the shore talking, one tall and one short, setting each other off interestingly.

The tall one took out a pack of Holy Ship brand cigarettes from his bosom, pulled out one and handed it to the short one, asking, "Are you still raising fish fry now?"

The short one looked like his glabella was dark, seemingly having a bad complexion. He took out matches, lit the cigarette he received, and lit one for the tall one again, saying, "Don't want to do it anymore; too tired! My health is bad; if I tire to death, who the hell cares."

The tall one said, "True. Your son can hold up the family now. Working hard for a lifetime, bitterness ends and sweetness comes."

The short one didn't seem very happy, saying, "Just this fate; it's like this for a lifetime."

"I heard a strange thing recently..." The tall one said slightly mysteriously.

"Oh? What thing is so mysterious?"

"Heard from fishmongers running to Leizhou and Gaozhou that business was extremely bad last year; lost even their underpants."

"What's strange about this?" The short one disapproved. "The Australians are fighting in; with this chaos of war, what business doesn't lose money?"

"Leizhou Prefecture is close to the Australians' old nest; it was infiltrated like a sieve by Australians long ago. The army settled it as soon as the proclamation arrived; where is the chaos of war?"

"Oh? Then what happened?"

"The Gengzhongjia over there bought fish fry from Lingao."

"What!" The short one's face changed greatly. Although Jiujiang villagers monopolized the fish fry fishing rights of the West River, they also bore thousands of taels of fish tax. Jiujiang's fish fry sales network went north to Qingyuan and Shaozhou, east to Huizhou and Chaoshan, and west to Fengchuan and Gao-Lei. In later generations, there were even big tall ships sailing from Luzon and Nanyang to buy fish fry. Now if someone no longer needed Jiujiang's fish fry and income decreased, the tax silver hanging over their heads wouldn't decrease by a half cent.

The short one asked, "Lingao has neither big rivers nor big lakes; where do freshwater fish fry come from?"

"Who can explain Australians' matters clearly? Some say Australians changed them out using the power of water and fire."

"Guan Youde! Guan Youde!" Mo Yu, coming by boat, saw the short one from afar and shouted.

Hearing the voice and seeing it was Mo Yu, the short one immediately changed to a smiling demeanor. He obviously knew Mo Yu and responded from afar, "Master Mo, how come you have time to come to the Fish Fry Market today?"

After the boat docked steadily, Mo Yu threw a cigarette to each of Guan Youde and the other, pointing to his companions to introduce them: "I have a few distant relatives who want to do fish business. Brought them over to look around."

The accompanying naturalized cadres all had Fujian-Guangdong accents. Putting on wigs and dressing up, they looked no different from the natives. Guan Youde believed it to be true and said, "I am all too familiar with this Fish Fry Market; there is nothing I don't know. Since they are Master Mo's relatives, their business is my business. Just speak up where I can be of use."

The tall one said, "Master Mo found the right person today."

Mo Yu didn't know the tall one and asked, "Your Excellency is?"

Guan Youde introduced, "This is my good friend, Zhong Ji. He is a Zaojia of this township."

"Then I'll trouble you!"

Thus, led by Guan Youde, the investigation team wandered around the Fish Fry Market. Guan Youde was a clansman of the Jiujiang Guan clan. His ancestry supposedly traced back to Guan Yu, moving here during the Southern Song Dynasty. The Jiujiang Guan clan had six halls: Shude, Shimei, Dianxun, Shide, Qiyi, and Sicheng. In old-time-space rural areas, if a family had three sons, their words were more effective than the village police station. Therefore, the Guan clan with thousands of clansmen was definitely a top-tier big clan locally.

Chen Wuren used to be the factory director of the Lingao Popsicle Factory and had managed dozens of people. His speech and deportment were mature and steady. He was the oldest in the team except for Mo Yu. Guan Youde decided in his heart that he was the head of these people, so he asked him, "Might I know the old gentleman's surname? Where does your family live?"

"My humble surname is Chen, a person from Xiangshan." Chen Wuren replied.

"Xiangshan, huh. Planning to trade fish or raise fish?"

"Raise fish."

"Then you are going to be a Gengzhongjia. If old gentleman finds Zhong Ji to buy Summer Fry then, he definitely won't cheat you," Guan Youde puffed a smoke. "Are there ready-made fish ponds?"

With the information learned from bragging with Mo Yu along the way, Chen Wuren didn't panic in his heart and said, "There are dozens of *mu* of clan fields in the clan. Because they are low-lying and close to water, grain yield is not high. The clan elders discussed and thought it better to change them into fish ponds. However, there are few fish ponds within the territory of Xiangshan, and no one in the clan has this experience, so they sent us to your precious place to visit and learn."

"Then you really came to the right place." Guan Youde said, "It's just that digging dikes into ponds costs a lot. Old Gentleman Chen's clan is truly making a big move."

"Since ancient times, profits from fish and mulberry make are the thickest. If it can be accomplished, it will be the foundation for the whole clan for a hundred years."

"Master Chen truly has long-term vision!" Guan Youde gave a thumbs up.
