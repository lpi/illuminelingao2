# Chapter 2778: The Capital (Part 134)

The recipe naturally couldn't be copied out; this was her reliance for doing this trade. So routinely, she only dispensed medicine and didn't give the recipe. To confuse the compatibility, she also had to mix some irrelevant medicines in it—to guard against the gentlemen in the medicine shop or doctors recognizing it.

Immediately she uncovered a corner of the basket in her hand, revealing a bundle of medicine packets, and chattered: "This is ten doses. The Eunuch wants one mace of silver for one dose. Just give me one tael, consider it my free service."

Liu Qi'er hurriedly said: "How can this be! There is no reason to let Mama serve for free!" Immediately she took her to her own room, took out a small steelyard, and weighed one tael and two mace of silver for her.

Granny Shi declined a few times before accepting the silver. Then she mysteriously took out a crude paper folder from the bottom of the basket and whispered: "This counts as an extra. You and the master of the house do as it shows, plus this medicine, guaranteed to give birth to a big fat boy next year!"

Liu Qi'er took it, unfolded it to look, and couldn't help blushing, saying: "Mama, what joke are you cracking! I'm already this age, still using this Spring Palace Painting (erotic art) to tease..."

Granny Shi waved her hand: "This isn't a Spring Palace Painting! Spring Palace Paintings are all detailed drawings. Where is there such a thing done by drawing two human figures with Ink Brush? To tell you the truth, this is a secret technique from India hidden in the Palace, most suitable for matters between men and women. If it weren't for my thick friendship with that Eunuch, how could I trace it out! You and the master of the house just do as it shows!"

Hearing her speak vividly, Liu Qi'er was half-believing and half-doubting. Looking at it again, she laughed: "The postures inside, probably only acrobats can do them. Our old arms and legs, I'm afraid we can't do them..."

"It's not that you have to do every posture once; just pick the ones you can do." Seeing Liu Qi'er's cheeks slightly red, knowing she was moved, Granny Shi took the opportunity to say, "How many years have you and the master of the house been married? Probably he is somewhat indifferent in this regard..."

Liu Qi'er sighed: "The master married me to him when I was seventeen! He was okay when he was young. These few years..." After speaking, she only lowered her head and sighed.

"He is a person not yet forty; his fire power should be strong properly." Granny Shi said "intimately," "Since you want to seek a son, it's always better to have more interest. Otherwise, this medicine is useless even if taken..."

These words touched Liu Qi'er's mind; she hurriedly said: "Does Mama have any method?"

"Method, naturally there is..."

Seeing her hem and haw, Liu Qi'er hurriedly said: "I have silver here."

"It's not a matter of silver," Granny Shi put on the appearance of a close friend, "You and I are our own people. This old body might as well speak clearly. Medicine for adding interest and gathering vitality (sexual enhancement), this old body naturally has. But the medicine nature is fierce; young people with strong bodies can stand it. Or if it's for old age, listless spirit, needing warm tonic and nourishment, there are also secret recipes. Only your master of the house, neither old nor young, if he rashly uses the gathering vitality medicine, instead it will hurt his body..."

These words were very "intimate." Liu Qi'er indeed fell for her trick, thinking she was really "kind-hearted," and sighed: "I'm already this age, how can I still arouse his interest? If it weren't for having a child..." After speaking, she touched her own face, feeling a sense of loss.

"It's not that there is no way..." Granny Shi knew the hook had been cast. There was no need to rush to reel it in at this moment. After all, Liu Qi'er here was just a small shrimp; the big fish was in the main room.

"What method?"

"I heard it from the Eunuchs in the Palace, saying there is medicine paid as tribute from foreign countries, for external use, not hurting the body." Granny Shi mystified, "At that time I just heard a sentence and didn't ask in detail."

"Then I have to ask Mama to ask..." Liu Qi'er had already ordered tea here, "Mama please use."

"Much obliged! Much obliged!" Granny Shi took a sip and said, "Since Sister-in-law Seven wants it, this old body naturally will go to inquire. You just rest assured."

"Sorry to trouble Mama."

Granny Shi had perfunctory enough with her and asked: "Is everything well in the residence these days?"

This was not perfunctory words, but casting a stone to ask for the road (testing the waters), to grasp the situation in the residence. Only then could she make the next plan.

"It's fairly quiet today." Liu Qi'er said, "It's just that a few days ago, an evil star came!"

Her words were full of disgust. Granny Shi hurriedly asked: "What evil star?"

"It's a child who used to be a student with Master Zhou. Now he also puts on airs of a master!" Liu Qi'er said very disgustedly, "Bringing people to send gifts for the New Year festival—it's fine to send gifts after the New Year is over, but as soon as he arrived at the residence, he looked east and west, and asked everywhere if there were idlers entering and leaving. Looking at that posture, he wished he could take the whole residence up and down for interrogation!"

"You only have a dozen people here including masters and servants, and the doors are strict. What is there to interrogate?"

"Who knows what medicine he took," Liu Qi'er spat, "A thing with hair not even fully grown, coming to check and ask! Wanting us to be 'stricter with the doors'! Listen to his meaning, it's as if someone here is committing crimes and breaking the law!"

Granny Shi felt a burst of nervousness, thinking "Bad!" This must be some leaked information. The master family sent someone to check and ask. She pretended to be calm and said: "This is strange. If there really is something, how can they send a child to ask."

"Don't underestimate this child," Liu Qi'er sighed, "Young in age, but shrewd as a ghost! As soon as he came, he checked and asked about the doors, inquiring if there were outsiders entering and leaving, and what kind of people they were. Moreover, he questioned carefully, asking separately. Even if we wanted to play dumb, it was too late to collude! Those pairs of eyes,賊 bright (thievishly bright/sharp), a burst of evil aura, making people fearful just looking at them."

Hearing this, Granny Shi panicked even more: This sounded like a *Lianjiazi* (practitioner of martial arts) of a nursing home guard—how could it be a child?

Immediately she forced herself to be calm, putting on an appearance of it being none of her business, and said leisurely: "Probably Master Wang sent him? Speaking of which, you don't have a master in charge here, but have two young ladies beautiful as flowers and jade. It is proper for the doors to be stricter."

"Speaking of strict doors, I dare not say for the whole Capital, but is there a stricter place than here in the whole Wanggong Factory? The two ladies and the young master and miss only burn incense and visit the temple fair on the first and fifteenth. They don't step out of the main gate or the second gate for the whole year. Still thinking it's not enough, just make two cages and lock them all up, then it will be strict!"

"Ai ai, what words are these..."

" Just for this strictness of doors, he scolded the master of the house, like a father scolding a son! According to his meaning, he probably really wanted to take me to enforce the law and give me a beating with the board to be comfortable. He only stopped after being cursed by this old mother!"

Liu Qi'er didn't say she knelt before Xu Yong and kowtowed repeatedly begging for mercy a few days ago, swearing never to let Three Aunts and Six Grannies come to the door again. Otherwise, she probably wouldn't be able to sit and talk today.

Looking at her appearance, Granny Shi guessed she was reprimanded a few days ago. She intended to provoke her a bit, so she deliberately sighed: "Officials are not as good as those in charge. He has someone backing him. You eat his bowl (live on his salary) and receive his dispatch. On the surface, you still have to follow him."

"Bah!" Liu Qi'er spat, saying indignantly, "If it was sent by Master Wang, fine! A person sent by Master Zhou's apprentice who can't be reached with an eight-pole (totally unrelated), tyrannizing here, counts as what X hair! He wants to do this and that; wait until this residence is named Xu, it won't be too late for this old mother to listen to him!"

Granny Shi wanted exactly this effect. Seeing the heat was enough, she deliberately said: "Ai ai, Sister-in-law Seven, why is this necessary! Since he has spoken, I will come a few times less these days! Don't ask for a snub for no reason."

"It doesn't matter. You come if you want, old elder. He can't make decisions in this Zhou residence yet." Liu Qi'er put on an appearance of "everything under control," "Besides, the one summoning you is Miss You Rong. Does this little brat have the ability to 'engage in family law' on Miss You Rong too!" After speaking, she laughed.

Granny Shi also laughed along. But in her heart, she was calculating. The master family probably smelled something, but had no hard evidence, so they sent a not-so-relevant child over.

Ten out of ten, Pan Cheng'an's business couldn't be done. However, this had nothing to do with her. Today she came to the Zhou residence originally to pass words for Pan for a rendezvous. As for what Pan said during the rendezvous, whether You Rong believed it, ran or not, none of this was her business.

Only once You Rong packed up and ran away secretly, regardless of whether the matter succeeded or not, she would probably not be able to enter this door again even if she cleared herself cleanly. Fortunately, You Rong was her big customer, and Liu Qi'er could only count as an extra. This "Juehu Chu" (last business deal) must be done well, trying to squeeze out more profit is the way.

Thinking of this, she already had a plan and inserted into the main topic asking: "Are the two ladies okay?"

"What's not okay with them? Every day soup and water, food and clothing are all ready-made. Open mouth for meals and stretch out hands for clothes. Speaking of serious business, it's just raising two small children." Liu Qi'er looked disdainful, "Miss You Rong asked about you the day before yesterday, saying she was uncomfortable and asked you to go to her room when you come."

"Yes, yes, she did ask me for medicine last time," Granny Shi clapped her hands and said, "I'll go over right now!"

"No rush!" Liu Qi'er lowered her voice as she spoke, "Wait a while until Miss Yui takes a nap before you go over. To avoid her chewing the root of the tongue (gossiping/tattling)!"

Granny Shi had long felt that You Rong and Yui didn't get along. Although both were her customers, Yui was obviously more "honest."

Honest might be easy to cheat, but often they were timid and couldn't be coaxed to do "big things," so naturally, one couldn't execute big money; You Rong came from a Music Household background, exceedingly shrewd, small tricks couldn't fool her, but she was daring and reckless. Instead, big money could be obtained from her. Just by acting as a go-between and arranging two private meetings in Ganlu Nunnery, she had already obtained ten taels of silver and several pieces of jewelry.

"What is the situation with this?" Granny Shi asked hurriedly.

"This time the one named Xu came to ask long and short, scaring her out of her wits. Not only did she tell everything about the contacts between inside and outside the residence in detail, implicating everyone to be reprimanded. She also instructed that outsiders should not be allowed to visit in the future, and she won't go burn incense either." Liu Qi'er said with a face full of disdain, "Look at her scared appearance, as if she stole a man outside!"
