# Chapter 2561 - Xunyang Tower

The attendees welcomed Elder Zhang Xiao with warm applause.

This wasn't Zhang Xiao's first public appearance in Guangzhou, but today's occasion carried particular weight. Every person in attendance possessed both reputation and standing among the local population. Though their numbers were modest, they represented the wealthiest, most cultured, and most influential circles in the city.

In contemporary European cities, such people would be called "citizens." Few in number, yet they held the city's affairs firmly in their hands.

Zhang Xiao had already reviewed the guest list. Half consisted of "new money" and activists the Elders had cultivated, while the remainder were fence-sitters—people who submitted to the new order but harbored no enthusiasm for the regime. Some even nursed a quiet hostility. In a sense, they were all potential troublemakers.

Yet these very individuals still commanded high prestige and influence among the common people. The Elders who sought to supplant them faced a long road ahead.

Even the self-proclaimed Senate, bold enough to challenge heaven and earth, had discovered this truth. After sweeping into Guangzhou and riding the momentum of a few high-profile cases to establish dominance, they now found themselves holding their noses to "cooperate" with these same people.

"Deep roots and flourishing branches"—truly no empty phrase, Zhang Xiao reflected.

With this thought, he flashed a practiced smile at the audience below and spoke in measured, cadenced tones: "Citizens of Guangzhou..."

Kuang Lu maintained a residence in Guangzhou called Haixue Hall, situated in Xianlin Lane near the Temple of the Five Immortals—just a stone's throw from Nanhai Academy. He too had come here today. A genuine prodigy, he had entered the county school at thirteen. His lack of examination success stemmed not from inability but from ambitions that lay elsewhere than the civil service path. Now that the lands south of the Lingnan mountains had undergone such upheaval, with the thousand-year Confucian tradition swept away like leaves before a storm, Nanhai Academy had become a constant weight upon his heart.

In former days of leisure, he would often stroll here. As a Nanhai County licentiate, visiting the academy had been the most natural thing in the world.

But after the Australians came, the place had been converted into an Australian school and something called an "Education Bureau." Watching the grounds he had frequented since childhood become a gathering spot for those crop-haired, short-coated types filled Kuang Lu with impotent rage. He could only conclude this had become a place of heartbreak and resolved never to return.

Today at noon, however, he had drunk a few cups more than usual. On sudden impulse, he decided to tour the old Nanhai County academy.

The grounds no longer prohibited ordinary visitors. Only the courtyard housing the Education Bureau offices was closed; the rest remained open without strict security. Someone like him—an old neighbor and local celebrity—was known to the gatekeepers. Naturally, they wouldn't stop him.

Thoroughly familiar with this place where he had played since childhood, Kuang Lu wandered unconsciously to the Zunxin Pavilion. The former green-brick outer wall had long since been whitewashed with lime by the Australians. The Confucian classics within had been cleared away entirely, replaced with all manner of Great Song books. It had become an Australian library.

Gazing back at the plum blossoms blooming in the garden, Kuang Lu felt the weight of the times pressing upon him. His heart brimmed with sorrow he could neither name nor express. With a long sigh, he picked up a stone from the ground and began scratching characters onto the pavilion's white wall:

*The realm south of the peaks has truly sunk*
*The true dragon lies shallowed in heart of mountains and seas*
*Three rivers, ten memorials—always cooking jade*
*Four bare walls, no refuge—still pawning the qin*

*Plunging into the sea, can it contain a noble's honor*
*Gazing homeward, forever pained by songs of Yue*
*If the passes should ever seal with clay again*
*Looking back: plum blossoms deep amid frontier grass*

When he finished, Kuang Lu remained standing by the wall, gazing skyward, lost in grief for the times. Just as bitter emotion consumed him, an angry shout erupted from behind:

"What are you doing!"

Kuang Lu started violently. He spun around—and his pupils contracted. "It's him!"

Huang Xiyin was equally startled. He hadn't expected fate to bring him face to face with this wild, unrestrained Kuang Lu again. Enemies on a narrow road, as the saying went.

Kuang Lu had assumed that Huang Xiyin, as Nanhai County Magistrate, should have died for his country when the city fell. Encountering him here could only mean one thing: he had gone over to the Australians and become a traitor. Kuang Lu's heart sank with contempt. He sneered: "The prodigal meets the Huayin Magistrate once more—but mules and horses have become homeless curs."

"You!" Huang Xiyin still remembered the Lantern Festival three years past, when Kuang Lu had mocked him with that verse: "Riding the donkey, happened to meet the Huayin Magistrate; lost the horse, still like the old man of the frontier." Being provoked again now, he trembled with rage, words catching in his throat.

"Magistrate Huang, you're looking remarkably well!" Kuang Lu said with exaggerated courtesy.

Huang Xiyin finally mastered himself. "And who might this be? Ah—young Kuang, the unlearned and unskilled!"

"Unlearned and unskilled still surpasses going over to the enemy and selling out one's country!"

"I know the Kuang family prides itself on loyalty and righteousness," Huang Xiyin replied. "Your cousin Kuang Zhuolüe followed Yuan Chonghuan and died on the Liaodong battlefield. Unfortunately—alas—Yuan Chonghuan ended up being sliced to death by a thousand cuts, and Kuang Zhuolüe's heroic blood was spilled in vain! Your Kuang family's loyalty was all fed to that dog Chongzhen! Ha ha ha..."

This, Kuang Lu could not endure. Insults to himself were one thing; even calling the Emperor a dog might be tolerated. But humiliating his elder cousin who had died for his country was absolutely beyond bearing. Rage erupted through him. In three strides he was upon Huang Xiyin, landing a right hook squarely on his left cheek.

Huang Xiyin was not only older than Kuang Lu but a mere bookworm besides. How could he match Kuang Lu, a fierce warrior who had roamed the rivers and lakes with sword in hand and books in saddlebag? He managed to block a few blows before his defense crumbled entirely. His howls of pain echoed across the grounds. The Zunxin Pavilion stood not far from the former clerks' quarters—now the Education Bureau offices—and the sounds of their scuffle quickly drew staff from within.

"Stop!" A sturdy hand clamped down like iron pincers on Kuang Lu's raised right arm from behind.

Kuang Lu's left hand still gripped Huang Xiyin's collar. He released it and spun around, throwing a left hook, but the man behind him ducked with practiced ease.

A strike caught Kuang Lu in the ribs and chest. The solid hit slowed him, and his opponent seized the opening—slipping to Kuang Lu's side, sweeping his knee. Kuang Lu's right leg buckled. Before he could recover, the man wrenched both his arms behind his back, pressed a knee against his spine, and pinned him cleanly to the ground.

Having completed this sequence of Bobo Army grappling technique, Nanhai County Education Director Tian Liang finally called out: "Quick, someone! There's a brawl here!"

No matter how Kuang Lu struggled, he couldn't break free. Though skilled in martial arts since childhood, when it came to combat experience against Tian Liang—an old soldier who had been crossing bayonets since the Chengmai Campaign—he was showing off before an expert.

National Army soldiers arrived in response. With several sabers leveled at his face, Kuang Lu recognized this was a loss he couldn't afford to escalate.

Huang Xiyin struggled to his feet, blood at the corner of his mouth, bruises mottling his head, black circles ringing his eyes like a panda's markings. He looked utterly wretched. Straightening his robes with what dignity he could muster, he stepped forward and slapped Kuang Lu across the head. "How dare you! How dare you be so arrogant!"

"Councillor Huang, stop hitting him," Tian Liang intervened. "Just hand this man over to the police."

"Director Tian, you don't understand." Huang Xiyin pointed at the library's white outer wall. "This villain has written seditious poetry right here on the walls of the Education Bureau!" He intended to use this opportunity to deal with this hateful fellow once and for all.

Since ancient times, writing seditious poetry had been a grave offense. Huang Xiyin had only glanced at the wall, but he knew this defiant scholar had composed seditious verse. The first line alone—"The realm south of the peaks has truly sunk, the true dragon lies shallowed in heart of mountains and seas"—could hardly be more damning.

A cold smile curved his lips. No matter how defiant you are! This isn't Ming territory anymore—there aren't so many connections to protect you here!

Tian Liang followed Huang Xiyin's pointing finger and examined the wall. All he saw were several columns of wild, flourishing cursive text—completely illegible to him. Kuang Lu's emotions had been running too high; the poem had poured out in a burst of unrestrained cursive. Even Huang Xiyin, who fancied himself a calligraphy connoisseur, could only decipher about half. But he could guess well enough that it was a "seditious poem" lamenting the former dynasty.

"Alright, I understand. Hurry and call the security National Army to detain him." Tian Liang knew his cultural foundations were weak. These Ming literati's showy calligraphy was such that even Elders could only recognize fragments—how could a rough fellow like him, wearing the hat of Nanhai County Director, dare expose his ignorance before Huang Xiyin? He simply sent Huang Xiyin off to summon help.

Soon two National Army soldiers came jogging over. Only when they had the man firmly in hand did Tian Liang finally get a clear look at this "rebel" Huang Xiyin had described.

"Mr. Kuang!" Tian Liang's surprise was evident.

"The blockhead from Tanka Village!" Kuang Lu was equally startled. Who would have expected that slow-witted former headmaster to possess such skills? Truly, I underestimated these Baldy pirates.

With everyone watching, Tian Liang couldn't reveal that he and Kuang Lu were acquainted. He said only: "Nanhai Academy is an important government and educational facility. There is also an important event here today. Do you understand that causing disturbances will land you in a cell?"

Kuang Lu laughed aloud. "This young master has been wild and free for twenty years—what scene haven't I witnessed? I'd quite like to see how Australian cells differ from Ming prisons."

"Save that talk for the police." Tian Liang waved his hand, and the National Army led him away.

"You've got nerve, kid!" Kuang Lu shouted as two sturdy soldiers hauled him off, still calling challenges back at Tian Liang. "Don't you dare play dirty tricks! Sneak attacks don't make a hero! When I get out, face me in a proper match if you dare!"

At the academy address venue, Zhang Xiao had finished his inaugural speech and most of the crowd had dispersed.

Chen Bangyan approached Chen Zizhuang's side and whispered in his ear: "Sir, Zhanruo has just been detained by the Bald... the Australians."

Chen Zizhuang's brow furrowed. "What for?" he asked quietly.

"Writing elegiac poetry on the walls of the Zunxin Pavilion. Also, assaulting Huang Xiyin, the new County Magistrate's councillor."

"Impulsive fool... Sigh." Chen Zizhuang knew this matter could be made large or small. If the Baldy pirates intended to implicate others, even hundreds of people might be swept up in the net. Moreover, nothing could go wrong at this juncture, lest all previous efforts be wasted. But he had never given the Australians a friendly face, so pulling strings for favors was hopeless. It seemed he would have no choice but to impose upon a certain examination classmate—one he hadn't seen in many years.
