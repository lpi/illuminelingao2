# Chapter 2751: The Capital (Part 103)

"Your servant believes that to enrich the grain and pay, one must first pacify the localities. The trouble of the Eastern Barbarians is like a headache; though painful when it strikes, it is ultimately a temporary affliction. Although the barbarians entering the pass plunder heavily, they have no foothold within the pass. During the Jisi Incident, the Tartars occupied four of our cities within the pass, but were soon annihilated by the King's army. If we strictly guard the vicinity of the Capital with the troops of Jizhou, Xuanfu, and Datong, and guard Ningyuan and Jinzhou with the Guan-Ning troops, should the barbarians knock on the pass again, we can summon the elite troops of the world to aid the King and drive them out of the pass. Thus, the Eastern Barbarians can still be dealt with.

"As for the Kun scoundrels, since taking Guangdong and Guangxi, they have shown no further development, merely using their navy to harass Fujian, Zhejiang, and the Bohai Sea. It seems that although they falsely claim the Song system, they are merely of the same stream as the Franks, Wang Zhi, and Xu Hai—greedy for wealth and profit. Although many ministers say the Kun scoundrels have sturdy ships and sharp cannons since the fall of Liangguang, your servant believes this was also because Wang Zunde started a border conflict without authorization, losing nine-tenths of the seasoned troops. His successor, Xiong Wencan, is unskilled in managing the army, and the newly built army is negligent in battle formation. Therefore, the trouble of the Kun scoundrels is like ringworm; although it causes much inconvenience, it does not threaten the foundation of the Imperial Court.

"The heart's disease of the Imperial Court is actually the roving bandits. Since the roving bandits rose in Shaanxi and Gansu, they have crisscrossed the Three Frontiers, brought chaos to the Central Plains, and the fall of the Middle Capital has disturbed the peace of the world. Treacherous people have risen everywhere, coercing ignorant commoners to abandon farming and production, and failing to walk the path of loyalty and righteousness. The governors of various places are exhausted from running around. Therefore, the soldiers and horses are weary, and the grain and pay are insufficient. If we wish to pacify the Eastern Barbarians and drive out the Kun scoundrels, we must first exterminate the roving bandits. This is what is meant by 'to resist foreign aggression, one must first pacify the interior'."

Chongzhen quite approved of Yang Sichang's analysis of "to resist foreign aggression, one must first pacify the interior" and continued to ask, "According to your plan, how should the roving bandits be pacified?"

Hearing this question, Yang Sichang's eyes flashed with a sharp light, and he answered in a sonorous voice:

"Four fronts, six corners, a ten-sided net! With Shaanxi, Henan, Huguang, and Jiangbei as the four fronts, four governors will be assigned to exterminate and focus on defense; with Yansui, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangnan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan as the six corners, six governors will be assigned to defend and assist in extermination. This is called the ten-sided net! With the Governor-General of the Three Frontiers and the Prime Minister of the Seven Provinces following the direction of the bandits, they will focus on punitive expeditions. Using both kindness and power, suppression and pacification, we must painfully exterminate the ringleaders among them to cut the weeds by the roots. For other bandit leaders, those willing to surrender to the Imperial Court should be recruited by special personnel and entrusted with military posts to assist the official army in exterminating the bandits. This is called using bandits to attack bandits. If your servant's plan is carried out in this way, the roving bandits will definitely be wiped out within two years. Once the bandit trouble is pacified, the provinces of the Central Plains can rest and recuperate, replenishing soldiers, horses, money, and grain. Then, with the army that wiped out the bandits in the Central Plains, we can march south to punish the Kun; the troops of the Three Frontiers will meet with the various towns of Xuanfu, Datong, Jizhou, and Liaodong to advance separately and strike together to move north to pacify the barbarians. Then the world will be settled!"

These remarks were indeed inspiring, but the Emperor had heard many bold words over the years and knew where the critical point lay.

"If we follow your plan, how many soldiers, horses, money, and grain are needed to pacify the bandits? The national treasury is empty now; how should the shortfall be handled?"

"If we wish to wipe out the roving bandits, your servant proposes increasing troops by 120,000 and pay by 2.8 million in the ten provinces. Your servant heard that the previous proposal to levy the Guangdong Tax would yield 2.1 million in additional annual revenue. Since pacifying the Kun puts exterminating bandits first, the military pay for pacifying bandits can first be drawn from the Guangdong Tax by 1 million. For the shortfall, we can levy an additional Bandit Suppression Tax for one year, drawing from three sources: land tax, postal service, and fines."

"Explain it to Zhen in detail."

"Yes, Your Majesty. As for the land tax, based on the old quota of grain, a slight additional levy will be made. Since the Guangdong Tax already requires payment of 8 qian per mu, your servant plans for this Bandit Suppression Tax to fall mostly on wealthy households, exempting poor farmers and not taxing damaged land. Over 1.5 million taels of silver can be obtained annually. As for the postal service, it refers to the silver saved from the previous reduction of postal stations; 200,000 of it can be used to fill the pay. The rest will be offset by fines and the sale of titles, allowing wealthy people to contribute funds to become students of the Imperial College, sharing the worry of the Ruler and Father. It will stop after one year."

"If the common people harbor resentment, what should be done?"

"Your Majesty, there is no harm. This additional levy mostly comes from capable wealthy households. Increased silver per hundred mu is no more than one or two qian, which can also slightly suppress land annexation. Moreover, tax-paying households are mostly people who are loyal to the sovereign and understand the state's affairs. Bandit suppression concerns the safety of the altars of earth and grain; they will surely be able to share the worry for the country. Wait until the Central Plains are pacified, then let the people rest."

"I regret meeting you so late! I regret meeting you so late!" Chongzhen could not help but exclaim in admiration. "Let it be as you say. Temporarily burden Our people for one year to remove this heart's disease!" After listening, Chongzhen, the Son of Heaven whose face had been clouded with worry all day, actually raised a slight smile.

"Your Majesty's grace of recognition, your servant can hardly repay even with ten thousand deaths!" After speaking, Yang Sichang knelt on the ground to thank him.

"Previously, when discussing the matter of suppressing the Kun with Wen Tiren, he recommended Lu Xiangsheng and Hong Chengchou to supervise the army to punish the Kun. Later, I considered that Hong Chengchou was supervising the Three Frontiers to punish the bandits, and Lu Xiangsheng was guarding Xuanfu and Datong as a screen for the Capital; both would find it difficult to take up the post. So I temporarily granted Xiong Wencan the power to act as he sees fit to check the Kun scoundrels. Now, following your words to exterminate the roving bandits first, and since Xiong Wencan lacks skills in managing the army, what arrangements should be made for Guangdong and Guangxi? Since the strategy of the ten-sided net is used, apart from Hong Chengchou supervising the Three Frontiers, and now Zhen has Lu Xiangsheng supervising Xuanfu and Datong, who is competent for the task of Prime Minister of the Seven Provinces' Military Affairs?"

Yang Sichang's heart thumped, and he secretly cried out 'bad'. Xiong Wencan had quite a friendship with him. Before this audience, Xiong Wencan had also asked someone to entrust him to find a way to let him continue to stay in office to atone for his crimes. Yang Sichang's plan originally intended to let Xiong Wencan be temporarily responsible for pinning down the Kun scoundrels. Now that he had lost cities and territory, he was already a Governor-General without jurisdiction. Naturally, Xiong Wencan could not complain about the misappropriation of the Guangdong Tax. Just now, in order to persuade Chongzhen to prioritize pacifying the roving bandits, he intentionally looked down on the strength of the Australians. In a moment of excitement, he actually let slip too much. If the Emperor thought Xiong Wencan was an incompetent good-for-nothing, things would be difficult to handle.

However, given Xiong Wencan's performance, it was indeed difficult to forcefully protect him. Having lost troops and land, it was already an extraordinary act of grace that the Imperial Court did not arrest and imprison him. Wanting to stay in office was inevitably suspected of being a fool's dream.

Naturally, Chongzhen did not know the little calculations in Yang Sichang's heart at this moment. After thinking silently for a moment, Yang Sichang spoke:

"Although Xiong Wencan is not good at managing the army, he was able to restore the situation and delay the Kun scoundrels after He Rubin lost his army in Qiongzhou. He is also a capable minister. After the Kun scoundrels' army invaded, he resisted at every step, making it difficult for the bandits to leave Liangguang, which is sufficient proof of his loyalty and courage. A general skilled in battle can be temporarily sent as a Commander-in-Chief to assist him in checking the Kun scoundrels. Governor Xiong has said that the hearts of the people and morale in Guangdong can still be used and handles organizing a righteous army. Your servant believes that 20,000 of the Guangdong Tax should first be allocated to Xiong Wencan, ordering him to reorganize the ranks and recruit soldiers. Together with the Guangdong Righteous Army, they will attack the Kun scoundrels from both sides. The Kun scoundrels come from overseas and lack land froces. If successful, Xiong Wencan can recover lost territory; if not, he can still keep the Kun scoundrels too busy to look elsewhere. The Imperial Court's great army can take the opportunity to wipe out the roving bandits. In addition, send a minister who knows military affairs to serve as the Governor of Southern Gan, choose a place to train tens of thousands of troops, and echo Governor Xiong from east to west. If Xiong Wencan cannot recover Liangguang, this force will be used as the main force to march south and pacify the Kun."

This plan was very appropriate and did not disrupt the Imperial Court's inherent administrative divisions. Seeing that the Emperor was very satisfied, Yang Sichang continued, "Your servant believes that Shaanxi Governor Sun Chuanting captured the rebel Gao alive. His talent is not below that of Hong Chengchou and Lu Xiangsheng, and he is worthy of a great task. If Your Majesty appoints Sun Chuanting to manage the military affairs of the Central Plains, the demise of the roving bandits can be counted by the day."

"Good! It matches Zhen's intentions!" This time, not only did the corners of Chongzhen's mouth raise in a smile, but his eyes also became brighter. He thought of something else and continued to ask, "For the Governor of Southern Gan, does my dear minister have a recommendation?"

"Former Right Vice Minister of War and Governor-General of the Three Frontiers' Military Affairs, Fu Zonglong, is competent for the post."

Fu Zonglong was currently idle at home. Although he was heavily used in the third year of Chongzhen, supervising the military affairs of the Three Frontiers, he was removed from office not long after due to a trivial matter. Since the Tianqi era, Fu Zonglong had been known for "knowing military affairs" and had commanded and participated in many wars to suppress rebellions in the southwest region, worthy of being called battle-tested. However, because of his upright and outspoken character, although he fought many victorious battles, he was always employed for a short term and then idle at home for a long time.

The Emperor nodded and asked again:

"Denglai Governor Sun Yuanhua, some say he is suspected of colluding with the Kun. What does my dear minister think?"

After remaining in office following the Dengzhou Mutiny, Sun Yuanhua had become a well-known governor in the Imperial Court who knew military affairs. Within a few short months after the Denglai rebellion was pacified, he quelled the rebellion in the Dongjiang Town, beheading the mutinous Dongjiang Vice Commander Shen Shikui, and completely controlling the Dongjiang Ming army. He submitted memorials to Chongzhen on substituting pay with tuntian (military farming), purchasing Western firearms from abroad, training new armies, and rebuilding the three-party defense layout. Since then, the Dengzhou Army and Dongjiang Army had repeatedly attacked from the sea with fruitful results. The heads reported to the Ministry of War were true Tartars that even the most critical eyes could not find fault with. Unprecedentedly, he turned in many armor, weapons, and official documents and seals of the Jianzhou Tartars, which had rarely been seized by border troops before. Chongzhen and the Ministry of War ordered Korean envoys and those who had surrendered from Jianzhou to identify them, and all asserted that they could absolutely not be fakes. During the *Bingzi* Incident last year, Sun Yuanhua led the Denglai and Dongjiang armies to harass southern Liaoning from the sea, successively capturing more than a dozen Tartar forts, killing and capturing dozens of Tartars and surrendered Han officials, beheading seven hundred Tartar soldiers, and seizing countless military supplies. This forced Huang Taiji to urgently recall the main force of Dorgon's department, which had advanced out of the Liaoxi Corridor to cover Ajige's invasion and plundering of the pass. In the post-war merit evaluation, Sun Yuanhua received the added title of Vice Minister of War. Zhang Tao and other old subordinates from Dengzhou, as well as Lu Wenyuan, Lu Zeyang, and others, also received additional titles and rewards.

Yang Sichang naturally knew about these things. He also heard that behind these merits, there might be trickeries involving the Kun scoundrels. Not to mention anything else, just the so-called Dengzhou New Army he trained had many Kun guns and Kun cannons, and it was said that there were Kun scoundrels acting as instructors.

He had no interactions with Sun Yuanhua. Why did the Emperor ask him this question? Soon he thought that a few days ago, the Ministry of War received Sun Yuanhua's garrison report that the Dengzhou Navy, together with Dongjiang troops, intercepted Tartar cavalry by the Yalu River, thwarting the slave chieftain's attempt to invade Korea. His Majesty probably thought of Sun Yuanhua because of this.

Thinking again about the Imperial Court's embarrassing situation during the Dengzhou Mutiny, the subsequent interrogation of relevant officials, and the heavy responsibility of suppressing the rebellion he now bore. Regardless of whether Sun Yuanhua colluded with the Kun, if he gave advice disadvantageous to Sun, and the Imperial Court really took action based on this, given Sun Yuanhua's achievements and prestige in the army, it was hard to guarantee that another Dengzhou Mutiny would not occur. not only would his, Yang Sichang's, "pacification" be abandoned halfway, but if the Imperial Court pursued the matter afterward, he feared it would be hard to wash his hands clean.

Since pacifying the Dengzhou rebellion, Sun Yuanhua's contributions were obvious to everyone from the Emperor down to the officials. The maintenance of Dongjiang also relied entirely on Sun Yuanhua's support. Sun's power in the Imperial Court was not small either; he was promoted by the current Senior Grand Secretary Wen Tiren. Although his mentor and relative by marriage Xu Guangqi was no longer a minister in the Grand Secretariat, the Emperor's favor had not waned. Now training troops and farming in Tianjin for the Imperial Court, it was said he had also achieved quite a lot.
