# Chapter 2772: The Capital (Part 128)

Now, Anping had been reduced to a ruined port after the Battle of Jinmen, and the remaining Guangzhou port had also fallen with the invasion of the Kun thieves. Therefore, the Imperial Court could not collect a single silver coin from maritime trade.

The court ministers did not think losing the overseas trade ports was a big deal. For most years of the Great Ming, the ocean brought only threats, not income. To guard against "Japanese Pirates" and "Ocean Bandits" from the East and West Oceans, they had to spend heavy funds to set up defenses along the coast.

The "Opening of the Seas in the Longqing Reign" (Longqing Kaihai) is written about with special significance in history books. In reality, if one investigates the content of the policy and the background of its passage, one would know that the so-called "Opening of the Seas" was more of a helpless measure of "banning via taxation." Since the government could not prohibit private overseas trade, they opened a crack in a limited way, turning a part of the underground trade into above-ground trade, so they could extract taxes from it. This did not mean that the Great Ming had realized the importance of maritime merchant trade, nor did it mean that the Ming Dynasty had changed its attitude towards commerce and trade.

Choosing Moon Port (Yuegang) as the open port itself reflected that opening the seas was an expedient measure. The area around Moon Port was mountainous, making this place form a relatively closed independent space. The land was scarce and barren, and transportation was inconvenient; the agriculture encouraged by the Great Ming could hardly develop here. They had to rely on the sea to make a living and engaged in smuggling trade. In other words, this was a "last resort" practice. The geographical environment of Moon Port itself was not suitable as an open port.

This half-hearted opening policy made the Imperial Court pay no attention to developing maritime trade, and even intentionally restricted it. Even in the most prosperous year of 1594, all the tax revenue of Moon Port was less than thirty thousand taels. It was merely a drop in the bucket for the Great Ming's finances.

Wen Tiren was from Huzhou, Zhejiang, so he actually had personal experience with the "money-making" aspect of maritime trade. A large amount of silk fabrics exported overseas came from here. As a local member of the gentry, the income from selling raw silk and cocoons alone was a huge sum every year. As for others, they didn't have a deep impression of this.

Liu Yuliang said: "Your Majesty, when this Dynasty opened the port, following the old precedent of Moon Port, the annual Introduction Tax, Water Tax, Land Tax, and Added Tax totalled no more than twenty thousand taels. Now the claim that we can obtain two hundred thousand taels of silver is truly delusive words."

Other cabinet ministers also expressed doubts one after another. Twenty thousand taels was not a small number. The commercial tax of a county in many places was only a few taels of silver for the whole year. Although Shanghai County was rich, it shouldn't be able to turn stone into gold.

Wen Tiren, however, knew that these were not delusive words. He had heard about the high profits of maritime trade. Especially in recent years, the Merchants Bureau Shipping Company (Zhaoshang Boat Firm) used Shanghai as a base to quietly do business with Japan and Korea. The Jiangnan gentry who participated in the shares all earned pots full of money. Although the Wen family did not directly buy shares, his family was one of the major raw silk suppliers for the Merchants Bureau Shipping Company. Just selling raw silk annually netted thousands of taels. If the Imperial Court opened a port in Shanghai, issuing ship permits according to the system of one hundred and ten permits for the Eastern and Western Oceans annually as in the case of Moon Port, and then calculating based on Zheng Zhilong collecting "License Tax" of two thousand taels per ship in Anping, two hundred thousand taels would be easily obtained.

I wonder who this person submitting the memorial is? Wen Tiren was secretly surprised. He had read the summaries of all memorials sent by the Office of Transmission and roughly knew the contents. For more than a year recently, no one had submitted a memorial discussing opening a port and setting up customs.

The Emperor lived deep in the palace for a long time and had never even left the Capital; obviously, he didn't come up with it himself. So who submitted the memorial? Wen Tiren immediately thought of the eunuchs.

The greed of eunuchs was extraordinary, and there was the matter of dispatching eunuchs to various tax barriers to serve as Tax Supervisors during the Wanli reign. Could it be that the Emperor remembered this matter under the bewitchment of eunuchs?

But the current maritime trade interests in Jiangnan were mostly in the hands of Jiangnan scholar-gentry. If the Imperial Court opened a port and set up customs in Shanghai, encroaching on their interests, it would be tantamount to snatching food from a tiger's mouth.

Although he intended to punish the Restoration Society (Fushe), setting up customs in Shanghai could indeed cut off their financial resources. But he was unwilling to make enemies of the Jiangnan gentry. Moreover, the eunuchs planned this matter without communicating with him—he didn't oppose the eunuchs using this to amass wealth, but he had no interest in giving them a benefit for free.

Immediately he coughed lightly and said: "Opening a port can certainly increase the State's revenue. It is just that Shanghai County is not very appropriate." He reminded, "Shanghai is a large county in the Southern Zhili, only a few hundred *li* from Nanjing. A fast horse can travel between them from morning to evening. It also controls the main route of the Yangtze River entering the sea and is a heavy defense town for coastal defense. Ports along the river and sea are numerous while soldier ships are few; it is most difficult to guard and defend, so it is not suitable to open a port for trade."

The various advantages of Shanghai's maritime trade, in the eyes of officials in the 17th century, were exactly the biggest disadvantages. When Wen Tiren said this, the cabinet ministers expressed approval one after another.

Wen Tiren spoke with reason and evidence, and the Emperor was unable to refute it for a time upon hearing it. After all, this was just a suggestion from a nameless nobody like Qian Taichong.

Seeing that there was no follow-up to this matter, Wen Tiren said again: "Although Shanghai is inappropriate, what the Emperor said about opening a port is indeed of great benefit to national affairs. Your subject requests that we might as well choose another place in other coastal provinces that is not so critical to open a port and set up customs."

These words were spoken very appropriately and also took care of the Emperor's face. Chongzhen also felt very satisfied. In fact, whether it was Moon Port, Guangzhou, or Shanghai, he didn't have any special impression. In the final analysis, he was moved by the revenue of two hundred thousand taels.

As long as he could collect money, he didn't care where the port was opened. Immediately he praised: "Minister Wen's words are indeed those of an experienced and prudent man."

"Thank you, Long Live (Your Majesty)." Wen Tiren took the opportunity to report again that this matter involved foreign barbarians and was of great importance. It might be better to issue a clear decree ordering the Nine Ministers of the Six Ministries and the Administration Commissioners of various coastal provinces to discuss and report.

"What Minister Wen says is extremely true. This matter must be handled carefully." The Emperor nodded, "Just as you say, issue a clear decree."

Wen Tiren returned to his residence, recalling today's summons. Originally, the summons had nothing special; the strangest thing was this "memorial" that came from nowhere.

Although he speculated that this matter was done by eunuchs, thinking about it carefully after returning, the matter seemed not so simple.

Although Wen Tiren did not collude with eunuchs, he had considerable connections within the palace to grasp news from the Inner Court in time. If someone really intended to seek the position of Customs Supervisor, there would absolutely not be zero news.

Could it be not eunuchs, but someone else secretly memorializing? thinking of this, Wen Tiren called a trusted long-time attendant, whispered a few instructions, and asked him to go see a eunuch immediately to inquire about the news.

However, this was not the most urgent thing for him right now. Wen Tiren's political sense was extremely sensitive. Since entering the Grand Secretariat, he had made many enemies. These political enemies were currently merging, plotting to drive him out of the Grand Secretariat, and the Emperor also vaguely revealed catching dissatisfaction with him.

Once the Sacred Favor declined, not only would his official career be hard to keep, but his life might also be in danger. Ever since Wen Tiren knew that the Donglin and Restoration Society were plotting to push Zhou Yanru to rise again, he had already foreseen that the ground under his feet began to teeter.

If he wanted to get rid of Zhou Yanru, he could only instigate a major case, just like framing the Bachelor Zheng Man back then to squeeze out Wen Zhenmeng. But although Zhou Yanru had numerous misdeeds, there were no fatal handles to grab, and he had already resigned and returned home. Unless he framed him for treason, and a treason case would inevitably involve the Eastern Depot and the Imperial Guard (Jinyiwei), he wasn't sure he could make Cao Huachun and Wu Mengming act according to his will.

What to do? Thinking it over, since it was the Donglin and Restoration Society who were pushing hard for Zhou Yanru's return, eliminating their wings was also a method. Under his operation in these years, the Donglin's power in the court had been greatly reduced. The one truly capable of stirring up trouble was the rising star, the Restoration Society.

The Restoration Society was known as the Little Donglin. It had many overlaps with the Donglin Party in political assertions and membership, but there were also differences between them: First, the Restoration Society focused more on controlling the examination fraud to promote disciples; while the Donglin only focused on struggles within the Imperial Court and was not interested in the examination field; second, the Restoration Society focused more on controlling the local areas, while the Donglin's focus was on the center.

Because the Restoration Society "spared no effort" in advancing disciples, it had a trend of controlling the examination field, leading to the phenomenon that "those who passed the exam were all Restoration Society people."

The existence of such a group, even if it did nothing, was enough to make a powerful official like Wen Tiren feel thorns in his back, let alone that it was his enemy!

Because of the Donglin connection, Wen Tiren had long been like fire and water with the Restoration Society. In June of the sixth year of Chongzhen, shortly after Wen Tiren became the Senior Grand Secretary, his younger brother Wen Yuren instigated Wu Bing from Yixing to write a play "The Legend of the Green Peony," insinuating various ugly phenomena of the Restoration Society. Wen Yuren also ordered people to adapt this book into a script and put it on stage to perform everywhere.

This matter caused a huge stir, alerting Zhang Pu and Zhang Cai. The "Two Zhangs" made a special trip to Zhejiang for this and met with the Education Commissioner Li Yuankan. Li Yuankan immediately ordered the book banned and destroyed, and pursued the responsibility of the author, arresting and imprisoning Wen Yuren's family members. After this incident, Wen Tiren realized Zhang Pu's power for the first time. Although he was already out of office, he could still remote control court politics. So he made up his mind to eradicate the Restoration Society.

In the autumn of this year, Taicang had a bad harvest. The Two Zhangs wrote an article "Theory on Military Provisions," expressing opinions on disaster relief policies. Zhou Zhikui, the prefectural judge of Suzhou, accused the Two Zhangs of "violating ancestral systems and disrupting water transport regulations." Zhou Zhikui was from Fuzhou and had also joined the Restoration Society. He was friendly with Qian Qianyi and Qu Shisi of the Donglin Party and had been the head lecturer of Luce Academy. Because he was conceited about his high fame, he was not accepted by other members of the Restoration Society. Later he formed a grudge with Zhang Pu.

However, his impeachment did not have an effect. By July of the eighth year of Chongzhen, Zhou Zhikui was dismissed. Zhou Zhikui believed his downfall was the result of the Restoration Society's operation and was extremely angry. So he wrote an article "Questions on the Restoration Society," accusing the Restoration Society and the Two Zhangs. In May of the ninth year, Lu Wensheng from Taicang accused the Two Zhangs of "founding the Restoration Society to disorder the world." Wen Tiren took the opportunity to send the accusations of Zhou Zhikui and Lu Wensheng to relevant departments for deliberation, wanting to take the opportunity to instigate a major prison case.

But Wen Tiren obviously estimated the power of the "Hierarch that Reaches Heaven" wrongly. Education Censor Ni Yuangong, Maritime Defense Vice Commissioner Feng Yuanyang, and Taicang Prefecture Magistrate Zhou Zhonglian refused to execute the order, not hesitating to be demoted to protect them, causing Wen Tiren's plan to encounter a setback.

This incident gave him a full understanding of the Restoration Society's energy, and therefore firmed his mind to eradicate the Restoration Society.
