# Chapter 2597: Investigation (24)

"So what did you say?"

"I said that I never sell such heterodox medicines of unknown origin," He Jun said with righteous indignation.

He Jun didn't have any more information to offer. After some discussion, the investigation team decided not to detain or punish him for the time being to avoid alerting the enemy. To reassure He Jun, Lu Cheng promised Zheng Xiaoyu that he would be treated with leniency when the case was finally closed.

"The money he earned certainly can't be kept, but we won't pursue other matters," Lu Cheng said. "If he can help us catch the mastermind behind the scenes, that would be a merit."

Since they knew Quan Youde had a farm estate near the medicine market, Lu Cheng immediately sent people familiar with the local area to investigate. No matter how hidden the location of such an estate was, it couldn't be completely traceless. Relevant deeds and land tax registration documents would definitely be preserved in the county yamen; it would just take some effort to find them.

Next, Lu Cheng decided to pursue another lead: the Southeast Asian man selling the "aphrodisiac."

Since the Southeast Asian natives often frequented the Ghost Market, questioning a few medicine peddlers who regularly appeared there would surely yield more information.

Slightly to Lu Cheng's surprise, everyone they asked—including many peddlers who had seen plenty of "New Australian Medicines"—had no impression of testosterone gel. However, they unanimously stated that what the "Southeast Asian man" sold was medicinal wine. This seemed to indicate that the product the midwife resold was medicinal wine from the start, and the conversion from gel to wine wasn't done by her.

The stalls in the Ghost Market were mobile. The spot he used had naturally been cleared by others long ago, leaving no clues behind.

As for the "Southeast Asian man" himself, due to his distinctive appearance and accent, several seated merchants who did long-term business in the Ghost Market remembered him. Piecing together their descriptions, they could roughly determine his main activities on Luofu Mountain: starting from half a year ago until three months ago, he came to the medicine market roughly once a month. Each time, he would spread out a ground stall and display several bottles of medicinal wine in different packaging, with functions ranging from strengthening *yang* and tonifying the kidney, promoting blood circulation and removing stasis, to tonifying the lungs and calming asthma, and nourishing blood and strengthening the body. Of course, only one of them was claimed to be an "Australian Divine Medicine," while the others were just side dishes hitching a ride on the main course to make a little extra money.

"It's a good thing we aren't planning to produce Sildenafil yet, otherwise who knows how many black-hearted merchants would mix it into aphrodisiac wines to harm people," Hao Long sighed inwardly.

"Did his medicinal wine sell well?" a police officer asked curiously.

"It sold quite well, especially the aphrodisiac, which would sell out in less than an hour or two. To be honest, based on my years of experience selling medicine, this is mostly a scam. This is a medicine market, and buyers aren't that easy to fool. Chiefs, you aren't here to investigate scammers, are you?" A medicine peddler made this judgment. "However, he didn't bring too much wine each time. Usually, he would run out of stock in three to five days, and then he would pack up."

"If you medicine merchants all felt it was improper, how did he sell it?"

"The stuff he sold was the most bewitching. There are too many of these things in the Ghost Market, and quite a few people fall for them. Don't people still get cheated? Moreover, I heard people say his medicine was reportedly effective." Another peddler said, "Some masters send people specifically to the Ghost Market to wait for him. I heard it's not cheap either."

"Actually, this Southeast Asian man's medicinal wine is indeed useful." Another older medicine merchant suddenly lowered his voice, as if he were about to reveal a secret. "I'm just afraid of soiling everyone's ears."

"What do you mean?" The people around, whether peddlers or members of the investigation team, were all very curious.

"Some of the girls doing business in the medicine market know this man. Every time he comes to the medicine market, he does business with them. One girl said that this man has no... no... balls..."

Everyone was stunned: *What the hell is this?*

Lu Cheng frowned and asked, "A eunuch? Can a eunuch still visit prostitutes?"

"Whether he's a eunuch or not I don't know, but he's definitely a castrated man," the peddler said.

"And so?" Lu Cheng still hadn't figured out the connection.

"Since he's a castrated man without testicles," Zheng Xiaoyu, having studied medicine, said, "logically speaking, such a person cannot have intercourse."

"Exactly. This man's beard is quite thick," the peddler explained. "Think about it, even a eunuch can become a bearded man. How sufficient must the *yang* energy in this medicinal wine be? The power of this aphrodisiac is self-evident."

Although this medicine merchant didn't understand scientific physiological principles, his reasoning was mostly correct.

Lu Cheng didn't understand pharmacology either, but Zheng Xiaoyu understood. No wonder the midwife would sell this medicinal wine as a gender-changing medicine!

Far away in Guangzhou, Zheng Mingjiang fell into deep thought after receiving their report: A castrated man, a Southeast Asian, testosterone gel, and clinical trials. These four key clues pointed to the same target: the drug test subjects of the Pharmaceutical Factory.

Some of these people were imported by Quark Qiong from the Basra slave market, and others were taken in by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau from the "eunuchs" in the capital—late Ming Beijing gathered a large number of poor people who had "self-castrated" while waiting to enter the palace.

But these people should still be in Lingao, with no records of escape or relocation. Where did this "Southeast Asian man" come from? And where did his medicine come from?

All she could do was send a telegram to Hao Long, informing him of the relevant situation and asking him to once again focus on checking the storage and usage of related drugs. At the same time, he was to check and confirm the current status of the test subjects, especially if there were any cases of outflow.

After sending the telegram, Jingshan brought the list of personnel prepared for arrest based on the audit results.

Zheng Mingjiang opened the file folder. The list was finalized after she repeatedly deliberated on the audit results and investigations. The Political Security Bureau stated that the case required "strong professional expertise," so they wouldn't express specific opinions, only listing the relevant case details, and left the specific handling to the Health Department itself.

Because the case involved a large area and many people, if they were to catch "every single one," the Provincial and Port General Hospital might as well close down and move entirely to the Nanyang islands. The list finally drawn up by Zheng Mingjiang and Wu Mu contained a total of thirteen people, including department doctors, pharmacy pharmacists, ward nurses, and ordinary administrative cadres... Their positions and educational backgrounds varied, but their common characteristic was that they were all "masterminds."

Unlike what they had imagined at the beginning, the drug loss wasn't a single case, but multiple cases, ranging from major ones involving tens of thousands of yuan to minor ones involving only a few hundred yuan.

Specifically which case involved whom, how deep their involvement was, and how they obtained the drugs would only be known after all interrogations were completed.

The Zhiming Tower was brightly lit and dazzling at night. Wu Mu stood outside the Zhiming Tower, separated from the noise by the night.

He looked at his watch and asked, "Are all teams in position?"

"All have arrived at the control points according to the original plan."

"Catch them as they come out, one by one," he issued the command briefly.

By midnight, all the people on the arrest list had been apprehended. Except for six who were arrested in their offices and dormitories, the other seven were arrested after "consuming" at the Zhiming Tower.

The content of these people's recollections was largely the same. They all discovered loopholes in the hospital's internal management, started with a single pill or an injection, and slowly became bolder, participating in large-scale drug trafficking activities.

During the interrogation, half of the people involved mentioned Lu Renjia.

"Who is Lu Renjia?"

"The director of the Nanhai County Health Center. He is also a doctor."

checking Lu's file, they found that he was also considered an old naturalized citizen, a graduate of the 2nd cohort of the Fangcao Di Health Training Class. He was a senior doctor in the health sector.

Lu Renjia used relationships with classmates and fellow villagers to curry favor with some personnel, and then used this to know more people. After buying them off with gifts and cash multiple times, he pulled these people into his network. The remaining half, even if they didn't know Lu Renjia, basically knew his money.

"When did you meet Lu Renjia?"

"About two years ago. I had just entered the hospital then," a doctor from a certain department said.

"He often treated us to meals at the Great World, and sometimes we went to the Zhiming Tower. At first, I was unwilling. Later, later, once I drank too much, and he took me home. When I woke up the next day, I found an extra bag on the table. I opened it and saw it was full of silver dollars. I counted them twice, a full one hundred yuan."

At this point, he couldn't help but choke up, covering his face with his hands.

"At first I didn't dare to take it. I was fearful for a long time and wanted to find a chance to return it to him. But every time I wanted to speak, I didn't know what to say. Later, one day, I wanted to go to the Zhiming Tower, but I didn't have enough money, so I had to stand outside and look. Just as I was about to leave, I saw someone. It was a steward from a gentry family who had humbled himself days before to beg me to make a house call for his family's old lady. I didn't expect to see him again a few days later. He didn't say anything, just exchanged a few pleasantries. But going to the Zhiming Tower with him was his nephew, who was about my age. Seeing that I had no money to go, he actually, actually mocked me, saying I was a poor scholar who became a doctor because I couldn't succeed in my studies, and asking what I was doing at the Zhiming Tower without money. I felt so aggrieved at the time. I worked conscientiously for the Senate, seeing outpatients during the day and being on duty in the ward at night. The Senate let me study medicine because I was good at studying. During those years of studying medicine, I didn't take a single day off, and I was still so busy after starting work. I finally wanted to go out and have fun, but I didn't have money. And him? He was just a servant of a gentry family, idling about all day, yet he could live such a life of luxury and dissipation. I wasn't reconciled. I went home, took out all that one hundred yuan, went to the Zhiming Tower again, and ordered the most expensive wine and dishes..." He became more and more agitated as he spoke, gradually becoming incoherent and tearful.

After that, he very calmly began trading with Lu Renjia. At first, Lu Renjia would pick up the drugs in person and give him the money. Later, he sent different people to trade with him.
