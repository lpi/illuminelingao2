# Chapter 2438: Sonia (XI)

Fortunately, this intervening time wasn't wasted—it could be used to continue repairing the marlin specimen. But before that, she still had some natural history knowledge to impart.

She cleanly opened up the now fully-skinned bird body and removed the stomach and crop from inside.

A strong, foul odor permeated the entire room. Even wearing masks couldn't block it. The apprentices all frowned and covered their noses.

"Very smelly, isn't it?" Sonia said. "When we make specimens, if conditions permit, we should always dissect the stomach and crop, cheek pouches, and other food storage organs. This way we can know what their main food is—this has reference value for understanding animal habits and habitats."

She carefully cut open the crop and poured out a pile of blackish food fragments. The food inside the crop was still relatively intact. One could see there were insects, as well as plant seeds.

"Everyone take a look—roughly what kinds of seeds and insects are there?" Sonia used small tweezers to separate the food fragments.

Then she also cut open the stomach pouch. The intense rotten stench sent apprentices who had approached closer stepping back again. Sonia acted as if she smelled nothing, spreading out the contents on the enamel dish.

The food in the stomach had become semi-paste. The contents basically couldn't be seen clearly. But after spreading it out and looking carefully, some undigested food fragments could still be seen.

"Everyone look—how many kinds of insects and plants can you identify?"

The "apprentices" gathered around the two enamel basins, doing their best to endure the foul odor while carefully identifying.

"There are beetles, but I can't tell what kind."

"Correct." Sonia nodded, separating out the beetle remains.

"Snail!"

"That one's too easy—the snail shell is very intact." Sonia laughed.

"Cricket."

"You figured that out from its leg, right?"

The apprentices chattered, identifying quite a few insect types, but nobody could identify the plants—understandably, these seeds, even if not digested, showed a semi-decayed state with significant changes to color and shape. They weren't easy to identify. Sonia herself didn't recognize many either.

If she borrowed her master's microscope, she should be able to distinguish more details. But the optical factory's microscopes were still in short supply. "Non-productive departments" like the Natural History Museum had to queue for a long time even after submitting purchase requests. The one equipped in Sonia's research room was something Lin Hanlong had gotten through connections for her in the name of a "birthday gift."

But Sonia didn't intend to bring this pile of sour-smelling contents back to her research room—she had too many things on her plate right now and couldn't spare time to research blue magpies.

"This seems like animal limbs." Valentina suddenly spoke. She used tweezers to extract a small bone-like object from inside.

"It is indeed animal bone," Sonia examined it. "Should be part of a limb bone from some amphibian or reptile. Can't specifically identify which for now. But based on the food types of other corvid birds, it should be lizard or frog."

"So it eats a very varied diet."

"Correct. Corvid birds have very mixed diets. Although they mainly eat animal foods like insects, they also eat plant fruits, seeds, and grains. Common animal food types include click beetles, scarab beetles, locusts, grasshoppers, flies, katydids, crickets, beetles, lepidopteran larvae, and other insects. They also eat spiders, snails, worms, fireflies, frogs, lizards, nestlings, bird eggs, and other small invertebrates and vertebrates."

Sonia effortlessly recited information she had seen in *Ornithology*. Of course, she wasn't entirely reading from the book—she had dissected quite a few corvid birds and verified this statement through experiments. Blue magpies, being corvids, shouldn't be much different.

Finally, by identifying food fragments and residue, they calculated: plant fruits accounted for 33.8%, amphibians and reptiles 32.4%, insects 22.5%, other small birds 7%, and unidentifiable 4.3%.

After describing the blue magpie's diet, the marlin's moistening time was about right. Sonia had them bring the marlin specimen back. The wet cloth had already been removed earlier, letting air slightly dry the surface moisture.

Xiaowen brought Sonia's toolbox. Sonia felt the fish skin at various parts and thought it had roughly softened. She said: "When repairing specimens, first we restore the specimen to its original state. Broken places need patching; sunken places need re-stuffing—if the stuffing shows signs of mold or insects, old stuffing must be removed and re-stuffed."

She then began repairs. Repairing specimens was complicated work. She first adjusted the internal support structure of the fish body according to the specimen's damage, then sprinkled camphor powder on degreased kapok to stuff broken and sunken areas. Then she pinned the edges of cracked skin with small nails—this step was especially difficult because the softened skin would gradually lose moisture again, so many damaged places had to be temporarily clamped with special boards for shaping.

Where skin was missing and couldn't be nailed or sewn, Sonia had no choice but to use special paper-skin to "patch" it.

"Whenever possible, best not to use patching," Sonia said. "Whether leather or paper, its strength differs from fish skin—shrinkage rates differ when wet or dry, and it breaks easily."

"If we had marlin skin, wouldn't that work?" one apprentice said. "Same marlin skin, same shrinkage rate."

"You're right, but we don't have any," Sonia agreed.

"My family's master is in the fishing company. We could tell him to save the fish skins..."

"The way you put it, it'd be simpler to just catch a new marlin."

"Besides, the fishing company doesn't skin fish anyway—that's the seafood processing plant's job."

...

Sonia gestured for everyone to stop discussing. During the interval waiting for the skin to dry, she was going to start making the Taiwan blue magpie.

She put on gloves and carefully took out a glass bottle bearing a black skull.

"This is preservative paste—a highly toxic preservative. It's also a preservative we commonly use when making specimens. Its active ingredient in Chinese is called: arsenic. It's actually an arsenic-containing compound. Toxicity is extremely potent! If you accidentally get it on your lips, you'll be meeting God in less than a minute."

Speaking, she opened the lid and carefully took out a bamboo scraper, scooped out some from the bottle. A strange odor spread through the air.

Sonia spread out the bird skin and carefully applied the preservative paste to the inside of the bird skin. Then she hung it up to air briefly. Afterward, she began the making process.

"The second important step in making taxidermy specimens is making the support frame. The frame material is this galvanized iron wire—soft enough yet with certain strength." Sonia picked up a bundle of Australian galvanized iron wire. "This is Australian wire—galvanized for some corrosion resistance, especially useful for our specimen making."

She said: Wire selection should be based on bird size to determine wire gauge. Generally, it should be able to support the entire bird specimen. Wire too thin can't support the bird's body and makes specimen shaping difficult. Wire too thick makes frame building, threading, and shaping laborious.

"...Small birds use 26 to 24 gauge wire; large birds use 8 to 10 gauge. Commonly used is 20 to 10 gauge. For blue magpies, being larger small birds, we can use 20 gauge."

Sonia spoke while extracting a roll of wire and needle-nose pliers from the wire bundle. These Australian tools—she genuinely found them easy to use.

"We first build the specimen's support frame. Before building the frame, we first need a basic plan: what posture will the specimen have? For birds, there are two basic poses: standing and flying. If subdivided, there are more. What specific pose to use can refer to natural history illustrations, or be decided based on the stripped skin's condition. Today, we'll do the simplest standing pose."

Sonia picked up the wire, measured dimensions, then cut three pieces. She used a file to file both ends of each wire piece.

"The cut wire ends will be rather sharp—file them first to avoid piercing the leather when threading the model—and possibly piercing your hand too." She picked up one wire:

"Frame building generally uses three wires. The first goes from head to left foot. At this time, the specimen's belly faces up," she gestured with the bird skin. "The wire should extend 3-4 centimeters beyond the beak, and exceed the foot by 5-6 centimeters." She began threading the wire through the leather. "Movements must be gentle—don't use force. Otherwise, the skin tears easily."

After threading the first wire, the second was done the same way—from left wing to right foot. The third wire went from right wing to tail.

"This wire should extend 5-6 centimeters beyond the tail bone. Species with especially long tail feathers—like this Taiwan blue magpie—the tail wire should be made into a 'Y' shape."

Sonia threaded all three wires, carefully held the middle of all three with her hand, and gently straightened both wings and both feet, making both sides symmetrical. Then she bent the wires from the middle. Dawen quickly handed her a short wire to tie tight from the middle, then separated and arranged them.

Though not yet stuffed, the skin and feathers supported by the wires "hung" on the frame in a grotesque form. But one could already see this was a bird.

"The frame is now complete. Next is stuffing," Sonia said. "After the frame is threaded, stuffing must proceed quickly—can't wait for feathers to completely dry. Right now the bird's feathers are still slightly damp. If completely dried, bird feathers are very difficult to groom into shape."

For stuffing specimens, Fangcaodi used to use rice straw for animal specimens. The effect wasn't good—it easily corroded, got insect-eaten, and molded. Rice straw also easily damaged leather, and stuffing fullness and stability were poor. So now they'd switched to degreased kapok.
