# Chapter 2504: Burning the Tower (17)

When a person's weight, reaction, speed, strength, anti-strike ability, fighting consciousness, defense awareness, and skills are above yours, it is very difficult to hit them. Even if the rules are really relaxed, it will be the side with stronger physical fitness and skills that hits the opponent's vital points first. In this sense, rules are not shackles limiting the weak from defeating the strong, but protection for the weak.

He realized at this moment that the opponent did not intend to "follow the rules" with him. Moreover, the people in the field also showed signs of watching for fun. As for the few people in charge, there was a clear implication of indulgence.

*Fine!* he thought. *No matter the final outcome today, this fight will inevitably scatter the hearts of some people. This is a great thing for the Senate.*

*Since it is so, I must show off my kung fu well. In such a place, the strong have sufficient voice. Plotting against the strong with schemes and tricks is also easily spurned by others.*

Xu Tong attacked rapidly. Left jab, right straight, side kick, left hook, right uppercut, left uppercut, right straight, whip kick. Swift strikes came like dense sudden rain, without stopping, without a shred of respite. The intense exercise and the pleasure of continuous hits made Xu Tong feel incredibly excited. He was like a bee shuttling through flowers, relying on flexible footwork to circle the strong man's body. He constantly changed positions, raining fists on the strong man, making him dizzy. In his eyes, Xu Tong transformed into countless figures, each false, yet each real. At first, he symbolically parried a few times, but later, the continuous strikes made him almost completely give up resistance. Holding his head, he was like a lonely boat swaying in a violent storm, ready to capsize at any moment. Xu Tong became more and more excited. He felt as if he possessed the power to dominate everything. He would use his fists to knock down all obstacles in front of him. His whole body contracted suddenly, his right fist accumulating power. Everything would be turned to powder under this heavy punch.

Suddenly a familiar voice shouted from outside the field: "Show mercy!"

Xu Tong's heart shook, as if cold water had been poured over his head. He immediately calmed down. His power-accumulating right fist slowly dropped. When he turned another angle and looked intently, he found Li Baiqing's anxious gaze looking at him. He quickly retracted his fist, jumped sideways a step back. The strong man did not react at first. After standing stiffly in the field for a moment, his body suddenly swayed, and he fell headlong. Xu Tong stepped forward, supported him, and gently laid him flat. After a brief check, seeing they were all external injuries, he couldn't help but relax.

Xu Tong looked around and saw shocked gazes everywhere. Only Li Baiqing let out a long breath. Xu Tong sighed lightly, secretly calling it a fluke. strong excitement had almost made him lose self-control.

He straightened his body, faced Xue Tu and Ge Yaoxian, cupped his fists slightly, and opened his mouth to speak, intending to ease the tense atmosphere on the scene and smooth things over.

Just at this moment, two green-robed men walked briskly into the field, walking toward Xu Tong's back. While walking, they gently lifted their robe hems. The sharp daggers on their belts emitted a cold chill under the sunlight.

Two figures went straight into the field without stopping, approaching Xu Tong's back quickly from the eight o'clock and three o'clock directions respectively. In an environment full of crises, Xu Tong maintained high vigilance at all times. Although facing Xue Tu, he consciously turned his body slightly sideways, using his peripheral vision to alertly scan the surroundings. When his gaze collided with the green-robed man at three o'clock, the hairs all over his body suddenly stood on end, and cold sweat instantly soaked his whole body. Tightly pursed lips, cold eyes—only a beast can better sense the danger of a beast.

Xu Tong turned abruptly. His throat became dry, and a mouthful of saliva was swallowed with a *gulp*. His body trembled slightly; it was the stimulation of extreme tension and excitement. He had to face weapon-wielding attackers from two directions with bare hands.

Xu Tong had always scoffed at the Krav Maga learned by those female team members of the Political Security Bureau. It might look capable and professional when dealing with ordinary people, but when it came to a real life-and-death fight, it would get people killed. As a cadre who followed the Senate relatively early, Xu Tong had always served as the Senate's dark night messenger in Guangzhou. The darkness and cruelty of the underground world exceeded imagination. When Xu Tong rolled in dirty alleys, in mud water, under eaves with people, engaging in life-and-death struggles, there was no elegance, no smoothness, no theory, only stinking filthy blood and the most intense, extreme violence.

Sudden fights were rarely empty-handed, and situations where two people held the same weapon almost never occurred. Either you were better equipped, or the enemy was better equipped. When facing an enemy bare-handed, almost all grappling and bare-handed knife defense techniques were tricks. Experienced opponents wouldn't give you a chance to use techniques. Their movements were as fast as lightning, retracting as soon as they struck. Their left hand wouldn't be idle like in practice, but would cooperate with the knife-holding hand to strike your vital points. They only needed to slightly deflect the blade edge to meet your blocking or grasping hand or kicking foot, and the empty-handed person's tendons would be severed, blood vessels cut open, hands and feet pierced. What followed closely would be merciless continuous stabbing. Don't delusionally think the murderer would pause or stop after stabbing once. In knife homicide cases, it is rare to kill with one strike; most victims die after being stabbed more than a dozen times or even dozens of times. When enemies showed their weapons, they declared their attitude: endless until death. Armed attackers only needed to seize the initiative once to establish victory. They would seize every opportunity to stab as many times and as quickly as possible until the opponent was dead.

Even Xu Tong was not confident in facing two knife-wielding killers at the same time. He could only fight for a chance of survival by knocking one down in the shortest time.

Xu Tong's gaze swept behind him, and his keen dynamic vision instantly captured the positions of the two enemies clearly. The one at eight o'clock was further away, lagging about five steps behind the one at three o'clock. His left hand was empty, right hand behind his back. The enemy at the three o'clock direction had his right hand inserted under the back of his robe, his left hand hanging low and loosely holding something. Xu Tong speculated that it might be a packet of lime or a piece of masking cloth, to be thrown instantly upon contact to interfere with the opponent.

Xu Tong didn't hesitate at all. He made a prompt decision to first strike the enemy at three o'clock who was closest to him and might have hidden weapons in hand. Only by striking first could he gain the initiative. While turning to guard, he crouched down, grabbed a handful of sand and soil from the ground with his left hand, and using the force of standing up and turning, threw it fiercely toward the enemy at three o'clock. His movement was so fast that the big man hadn't thrown the hidden weapon in his left hand before his eyes were blinded by the sand. Subconsciously, he threw the object in his left hand, then pulled out the short knife tucked in his back waist, stabbing forward blindly, while reaching out his left hand to pull at Xu Tong.

Xu Tong first retreated a step quickly, dodging the incense ash packet thrown at his face. The incense ash exploded beside Xu Tong, enveloping the two in a gray mist. Squinting his eyes, taking advantage of the moment the big man closed his eyes and his vision was obscured, Xu Tong quickly stepped in and wedged himself in front of the big man. Xu Tong did not attempt to fix the opponent's wrist or joints, but instead used equally fast and fierce slapping to strike the opponent's attacking hand, thereby stopping the stab and looking for an opportunity to escape or counterattack. An experienced knife hand would retract immediately after striking, rather than leaving the knife-holding hand there for you to perform complex joint locks. Even if you luckily succeeded in using a technique, a truly strong-willed desperado would stab the knife into your body just the same even while enduring huge pain. You cannot estimate the opponent's situation; never underestimate your opponent when fighting. At the same time, your enemy will use his left hand to pull and disturb you to avoid being grappled, and try to hold and control your body to create conditions for stabbing. Once entering close-quarters entanglement, the empty-handed side will almost inevitably be stabbed during the struggle.

Xu Tong's dynamic vision, excellent almost like a baseball batter, saved him again. When the opponent's short knife stabbed, he even saw a small rust spot at the end of the blade. His left hand chopped outward horizontally, fiercely slapping the opponent's right hand holding the knife. The double-edged dagger jerked back violently, leaving a thin cut on Xu Tong's left hand. High-speed secretion of adrenaline and extreme focus made Xu Tong unable to perceive pain at all. The opponent's knife retracted quickly after a probe, then stabbed again. Xu Tong showed no fear, his left hand slapping continuously. Just a few seconds of high-intensity confrontation left Xu Tong's hands covered with blood marks cut by the knife. Finally, in the instant that allowed no hair's breadth of error, Xu Tong captured that fleeting opportunity. The edge of his palm collided violently with the opponent's forearm. For this strike, he used all his strength. At the moment of contact, he even suspected he heard the sound of the opponent's bone cracking. The big man's right arm was flung obliquely backward by the huge impact, his arm went numb, and with a clang, the dagger in his hand fell to the ground under the huge impact.

Having succeeded in one strike, Xu Tong immediately followed up with combination attacks to establish dominance. He used his right hand to sweep away the big man's left hand. His left hand formed a fist, the second joint of the middle finger protruding, thumb pressing tightly behind to form a protrusion. He delivered short, continuous, fierce blows to the opponent's eyes and Adam's apple. With a "pop," accompanied by the bursting of that small pool of fluid, the big man in front of him collapsed covering his eyes screaming like a child. Xu Tong didn't stop at all. Before pushing his hands fiercely on the opponent's shoulders and chest to widen the distance between the two, then his left foot snapped up to kick the big man's testicles. immediately following, his right leg swept horizontally, kicking the temple of the big man who was kneeling and wailing with his legs clamped. The scream stopped abruptly. The big man fainted to the ground with a thud like a sack.

At this time, another big man had also walked to Xu Tong's side. But under Xu Tong's deliberate positioning, the wrestling bodies of the two interfered with his taking a strong attack position. When he repositioned a few seconds later, the first big man had already been knocked down. He had lost the suddenness of a sneak attack. He quickly adjusted his posture, left hand blocking in front, right hand holding the knife behind, crouching low, and rapidly approaching Xu Tong.
