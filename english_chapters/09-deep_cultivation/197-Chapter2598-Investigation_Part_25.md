# Chapter 2598: Investigation (25)

The specific methods for obtaining drugs were truly varied. Apart from using external hospital prescriptions to obtain publicly funded drugs from the main hospital—a relatively advanced method—there were many other tricks. The simplest was the collusion between the pharmacy warehouse keeper and two cleaners, stealing drugs directly from the pharmacy and smuggling them out of the hospital using medical waste bins to evade inspection.

When Zheng Mingjiang first heard of such practices, she couldn't help but widen her eyes, thinking that this method lacked imagination and was completely reckless.

"Didn't they consider the inventory shortage?"

"Of course they did," Wu Mu said. "The method is also very simple."

"How simple?"

"After getting the drugs out, they leave the packaging boxes and instruction manuals behind, and then substitute them with messy things, as long as they look similar from the outside. So they don't touch bottled oral liquids, injections, and other agents," Wu Mu said. "The people counting the inventory just check if the quantity is correct roughly; they won't open each box to verify."

"This, this is too... too... ridiculous! To think such things happen!" Zheng Mingjiang still couldn't recover from the shock. "But if this gets distributed, isn't it harming people?"

"Anyway, eating such fake medicine won't kill anyone. The patient's family will at most think the medicine is useless. Even if they tell the doctor, the doctor will assume the medicine didn't fit the symptoms. Even in the old timeline, taking medicine wasn't one hundred percent guaranteed to be effective for the symptoms."

"I really thought it was too complicated," Zheng Mingjiang smiled bitterly. "And I also thought it was too simple! I thought once the rules and regulations were set, everything would be foolproof!"

"Rules and regulations are made by people, and if they are people, they won't be foolproof." Wu Mu had seen many such things. In the end, good systems require people to execute them. Given the Senators' own abilities and busy schedules, being able to enforce the system at all was considered good; executing it thoroughly was almost impossible.

For a scale like the Provincial and Port General Hospital, with two or three Senators leading hundreds of naturalized medical workers, receiving over a thousand outpatients a day and having over a hundred inpatients, maintaining the current normal operation was already remarkable.

Furthermore, the huge price difference in drugs caused by the dual-track system of public healthcare and commercial healthcare implemented by the Senate had also become a breeding ground for various forms of corruption. Under such huge temptation of profit, the loss of drugs was merely a question of degree, not of existence.

"I mentioned this issue to Dean Shi last time. Our dual-track drug pricing system will definitely cause problems. It's better to adopt a single price and a naturalized employee medical insurance system. This can at least eliminate the arbitrage space for drugs," Zheng Mingjiang said. "Doing it this way creates too much arbitrage space. With such huge profits, some people would do it even at the risk of beheading."

After several days of interrogation, the number of naturalized employees and ordinary people involved expanded to hundreds. Some repeatedly registered to obtain prescription slips; some specialized in buying drugs prescribed to naturalized citizens; and others colluded with nurses to deduct and falsely claim drugs from inpatients...

The more Zheng Mingjiang investigated, the colder her heart felt. She originally thought that large medical institutions like the Provincial and Port General Hospital, with Senators in charge, would have much better and stricter compliance than small institutions, and cases of theft and leakage would be rare.

Unexpectedly, because large institutions had a high volume of patients, large drug usage, and complex accounts, under the incompetence of a large number of low-quality management personnel filling the numbers, the problems that appeared were even greater.

*We came to this new timeline and braved death, yet in less than ten years, all kinds of corruption have emerged.* Seeing these varied and tricky schemes, she doubted her career for the first time: *What exactly are we here for?*

The more she read the reports, the more discouraged she felt. Her determination to "investigate to the end" began to waver. She dared not imagine what kind of results would explode once the audit started on the Lingao General Hospital and the Logistics Health System, which had not yet been audited...

But things had come to this point, and backing out was no longer an option. The only way was to continue investigating. Clarify all the current problems, and then make remedial measures based on the loopholes found.

It was impossible to come up with a once-and-for-all system. She originally thought this phrase was a helpless compromise to the deeply ingrained status quo, thinking that as long as there was determination to start over, everything could be corrected.

Now it seemed that while a blank sheet of paper was good for drawing, no design was perfect.

All she could do was mend the fold after the sheep were lost, and redraft a series of laws and regulations for this timeline, such as the Drug Administration Law, Good Clinical Practice, Measures for the Administration of Drug Registration, Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Drug Production, Good Supply Practice for Pharmaceutical Products, Measures for the Examination of Drug Advertisements, and Measures for the Administration of Drug Inspection.

Zheng Mingjiang knew well that laws, as a superstructure, must adapt to the current productive forces and production relations; otherwise, they would exist in name only and leave endless troubles. The drug administration in the old timeline, as a regulatory agency in a late-developing country, learned from the FDA, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the EMA (European Medicines Agency) from its inception. It always talked about aligning with international standards and took pride in copying FDA regulations, to the point that the abbreviation SFDA was jokingly called "Stupid FDA."

Therefore, drafting regulations for this timeline and making them play a positive role was not an easy task and could only be done slowly.

In addition, she was drafting several small popular science articles. When Wang Liang returned to Lingao, he took away all the various "divine medicines" she had collected. The drug analysis report had already been sent back to Guangzhou. The antibiotics were mostly sulfonamides, followed by Penicillin V, which was consistent with current production realities.

Sulfonamides were one thing, but penicillin belonged to the beta-lactam antibiotics. According to their antimicrobial spectrum and drug resistance, they could be divided into narrow-spectrum penicillins, enzyme-resistant penicillins, broad-spectrum penicillins, anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa broad-spectrum penicillins, and anti-Gram-negative bacteria penicillins. Narrow-spectrum penicillins were represented by injectable Penicillin G and oral Penicillin V. Penicillin G was natural penicillin, extractable from Penicillium culture fluid. Its chemical properties were relatively stable, its antibacterial effect strong, and it easily crossed the blood-brain barrier during inflammation. It was a commonly used antibiotic in the old timeline. However, its disadvantage was that it was extremely unstable in water and not heat-resistant. Orally, it was easily destroyed by gastric acid and digestive enzymes, with low and irregular absorption, so it was not suitable for oral administration and was usually used for injection. Penicillin V could be obtained by fermentation with precursors. Its antimicrobial spectrum was the same as Penicillin G. Its greatest feature was acid resistance and good oral absorption, but food could affect drug absorption. Its disadvantage was that it was easily hydrolyzed by penicillinase, so it was ineffective against most Staphylococcus aureus and not suitable for serious infections. As for Amoxicillin, another commonly used broad-spectrum oral penicillin in the old timeline, it was a semi-synthetic antibiotic, exceeding the Senate's current production capacity.

although traditional medicine in this timeline lacked the concept of dose-response relationship, it knew that dosage was very important, hence the saying "the secret not passed down lies in the dosage." Although they had a naive understanding of pharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics was obviously beyond their cognitive range, so they didn't know that turning injectable penicillin into an oral form wouldn't achieve the required blood drug concentration.

Besides that, there was the issue of drug resistance that needed attention. Many Senators thought it was too early to consider this issue, but too small a drug dosage and too short a duration would not only fail to achieve therapeutic effects but also promote the screening of bacterial flora, accelerating the emergence of drug resistance. An antibiotic costing a tael of silver a packet wasn't something everyone could afford, let alone taking it for several days in a row. These were all major hidden dangers.

After several days of interrogation, the Luofu Medicine Market's "Lushi Powder" case finally surfaced. After the Political Security Bureau secretly arrested Lu Renjia, they finally mapped out the full picture of the case.

As the director of the Nanhai County Health Center, Lu Renjia not only undertook the basic medical and health guarantee work of Nanhai County but was actually responsible for the medical and health undertakings of the entire Nanhai County. This gave him an excellent opportunity to manipulate things.

Lu Renjia had long realized the huge market value of "Australian medicine." At the beginning of his tenure as director of the Nanhai County Health Center, he had already begun to steal drugs for private sale. However, although he had the authority to manage all health institutions in Nanhai, the only medical institution he directly managed was the Nanhai County Health Center. The drugs he could steal were very limited, so it was just small-scale activity.

He largely started to work in earnest after getting to know Quan Youde.

Logically speaking, Quan Youde was a person from Huizhou Prefecture and had nothing to do with him. But Quan Youde curried favor under the name of a "medicine merchant" and got to know Lu Renjia.

At first, using high rebates as bait, he asked Lu Renjia to give some "care" when tendering for the purchase of various proprietary Chinese medicines and raw medicines. After interacting more, the two gradually became drinking buddies, and then "sworn brothers."

Zheng Mingjiang thought to herself that they all followed this path! Zheng Xiaoyu and He Jun were like this, and unexpectedly Lu Renjia and Quan Youde were also like this!

Lu Renjia came from a poor background, but his grandfather was from a wealthy family that later declined. Although Lu Renjia hadn't lived a single day of a good life, he inherited quite a few of his grandfather's old concepts. The one he took to heart the most was "there are three forms of unfilial conduct, of which the worst is to have no descendants."

After being rescued by the Senate in Guangzhou and coming to Lingao, although he attended the health school, later became a doctor, and was promoted to a senior cadre, he always had complaints about his family.

His wife was a nurse whom a Senator had matchmade for him when he was serving at the Bairen General Hospital. They had two daughters after marriage. Although family life was reasonably happy, having no son had always been his sore point. Moreover, his nurse wife wasn't very "obedient" to him. This had always rankled Lu Renjia. When he went north to Guangzhou this time, he originally wanted his wife and children to transfer over together, but his wife felt that the children wouldn't have good kindergartens in Guangzhou, so she didn't come with him and stayed at the Bairen General Hospital.
