# Chapter 2538: Chen Qing's Secret

Chen Lin recounted his visit to the textile park and his participation in Wu Yijun's cotton textile project, laying out each detail in turn.

Then he unveiled his grand plan: to build a cotton textile factory on the sandy riverbank land in the south, employing Australian production techniques.

"The Australians are desperate for colored cotton cloth," Chen Lin declared, painting the market prospects in the rosiest terms imaginable. "Whatever we weave, they'll buy. The silk workshops are struggling now, and clan members are having a hard time of it. With this factory, everyone will have steady work, and our kinfolk can finally breathe a little easier."

Though the Chen Clan of Nansha enjoyed a prominent reputation and wielded considerable local influence, its foundations remained shallow. The clan had never achieved a true breakthrough on the Civil Service Examination path. Collective support under the clan system had produced a few scholars, but not a single *Juren* among them. Their highest-ranking member held only the degree of *Bagong*, and he had never obtained a substantive office.

The Nansha Chen Clan styled itself a family of farming and scholarship, but the gold content of their "scholarship" was obviously lacking. Without *Juren* or *Jinshi* degrees, they could never break into the ranks of the true gentry. Their local power remained limited, resting entirely on the strength of numbers that came from living together as a clan.

Because of this, apart from the few members engaged in trade and industry, most of the Chen clan still depended on farming and manual labor. Working in the silk workshops had long been a major source of income for them.

Now, although the silk workshops had recovered, Chen Xuan's "improper position" meant he had hired large numbers of workers from outside the clan while excluding Chen members—the official excuse was insufficient work, but everyone understood what was really happening. Resentment ran deep.

The Chen family had been looted by rogue soldiers not long ago, leaving everyone from top to bottom destitute. The moment Chen Lin unveiled his "Grand Plan of Building a Factory," it won immediate support from the younger generation.

"When you go home, talk to your parents and elders," Chen Lin instructed once the enthusiasm had reached the right pitch. He signaled for his men to distribute the gifts he'd brought. "Explain the benefits of this cotton textile factory. These are small items I picked up in Lingao—nothing valuable, but practical things for the household. Take them home to your families."

The gifts were simple enough: candles, matches, candies, mosquito repellent, common household medicines. Nothing extravagant, but useful and effective.

Chen Lin offered a few more words of encouragement, asking everyone to await news of the factory construction. When hiring began, clan members would receive first consideration.

After the gathering dispersed, Chen Lin walked into the courtyard, his heart swelling with excitement. He gazed up at the star-filled sky, feeling as though infinite possibilities stretched before him. His eyes drifted to the east and west wing rooms where the internship group was staying. Lights still burned within—what were they working on at this hour? Probably still hammering out details for the new textile factory. Though it would be the Wu Yijun family's property, the clan had a stake in it too. More importantly, if this project succeeded, he would have proven himself in the Australians' eyes. He would have his chance to board that great ship.

He was just planning to visit the internship group's quarters to discuss matters when movement in a shadowy corner caught his attention. Chen Qing was nestled close to someone there, speaking in intimate whispers. Chen Lin felt a flicker of surprise—he hadn't heard anything about Chen Qing having a sweetheart in the village. The boy was more resourceful than he'd given him credit for.

He crept closer for a better look and felt as though lightning had struck him: the person wrapped in Chen Qing's arms was his own cousin, Chen Yue.

Chen Lin was no hidebound pedant or feudal relic—he was a young man himself. Nor did he look down on Chen Qing's family for being poor. But his sister's behavior was simply too brazen: a grown girl nestled in a man's arms in the darkness of night—what was this? And the fatal detail, from the clan law's perspective, was that Chen Yue was technically Chen Qing's Clan Aunt.

Though Chen Qing's branch of the family was only distantly connected to Chen Lin's grandfather's line, they all descended from the same founding ancestor. Such a thing would bring great shame upon the entire clan. Both man and woman would be drowned in pig cages.

If this came to light, Second Uncle would seize it as a weapon against him—accusing him of lax discipline, driving him from the village. The clan members wouldn't say a word in his defense. Never mind reclaiming clan leadership or promoting industry and commerce; whether he could even maintain a foothold in the village would become a serious question.

Cold sweat broke out across his skin. Afraid of alerting others, he didn't shout for them to stop. He waited in the shadows until Chen Yue pressed something into Ah Qing's hands and hurried away.

"Ah Qing!"

"Ninth Uncle!" The voice jolted Chen Qing from his reverie. His hand flew unconsciously to his chest.

"Hand it over." Chen Lin extended his palm, face dark as thunderclouds.

"What..."

"Don't play dumb." Chen Lin kept his voice low. "You've got some nerve! Are you courting death?"

Chen Qing stammered, reluctantly drawing the object from inside his shirt.

Chen Lin examined it—a handkerchief. He tucked it away carefully, then rebuked him in an undertone: "What kind of death wish is this? You and Chen Yue have the nominal relationship of aunt and nephew! You dare commit such an offense against proper human relations? If the clan finds out, neither of you will survive!"

Since ancient times, those of the same surname did not marry—and they were clan members descended from a common ancestor.

Chen Qing's face was a mask of loss and terror. "Uncle Lin," he begged quietly, "Chen Yue and I truly care for each other. Please don't tell the clan..."

"You'd better understand the gravity of this!" Chen Lin snapped. "Besides you two, who else knows? Do your parents?"

Chen Qing shook his head frantically. "No one knows!"

"No one knows? Then how did I find out? Don't assume your secrets are safe. Others have probably just chosen not to get involved." Chen Lin exhaled heavily. "Consider it Heaven's mercy that I'm the one who caught you."

He fixed Chen Qing with a hard stare. "Besides this handkerchief, what other tokens have you and Ah Yue exchanged? Bring them all out now—before someone else finds them and uses them as iron-clad evidence."

"Gone... They're gone..." Chen Qing said, trembling.

Chen Lin said nothing. He kicked the boy and hissed, "If you want to die so badly, go throw yourself in the river outside the village—don't drag others down with you! I'll ask once more: are there any others?"

Seeing his usually amiable Ninth Uncle turn so ferocious, Chen Qing's courage crumbled. "There are more," he admitted.

"Go. To your room. Bring everything out." Chen Lin escorted his nephew to the sleeping quarters and forced him to produce every object Chen Yue had given him. Besides the handkerchief, there were shoes and socks she had sewn by hand. And finally, to his shock, a close-fitting *dudou*—an intimate bellyband.

This sent Chen Lin's fury boiling over. Such corruption of morals and decency! He slapped Chen Qing twice across the face. "You shameless wretch! Tell me the truth—where did you get this?"

"No, it's not—" Chen Qing covered his face, terrified. "Yue'er gave it to me herself."

Chen Lin felt his skull cap nearly lift off. He had never imagined his sister—always so well-behaved and obedient—would do something so utterly shameless.

He wanted nothing more than to kick this nephew to death. But he forced himself to calm down. Chen Qing was his capable helper, and Chen Yue was his sister. He had to protect them both from harm.

Drawing a steadying breath, he asked in a low voice, "Is this everything? Don't lie to me. If anything happens, you'll both die."

"All here, all here..."

Chen Lin bundled up the objects and took Chen Qing to the kitchen. Finding no one about, he stuffed everything directly into the stove.

Embers still smoldered within, and the bundle caught fire at once. Still not satisfied, Chen Lin prodded it with a stick until he was certain nothing remained but ash. Only then did he turn to leave.

"Tell me honestly: did you and Chen Yue ever... ever..." He couldn't bring himself to finish.

"No!" Chen Qing said quickly. "Absolutely not!"

"Good." Chen Lin pressed further. "Did you give her any tokens?"

"Only a pair of silver earrings. I bought them myself."

"Any special marks on them?"

"No, just the shop's stamp."

"What shop?"

"Maoyu. In the county seat..."

"Your name isn't on them?"

"No, no." Chen Qing shook his head repeatedly in fright.

Chen Lin allowed himself a small breath of relief. A pair of unmarked silver earrings couldn't serve as proof. He warned in a low voice: "I'm going to treat this matter as if it never happened. You will restrain yourself and cut off these improper thoughts immediately. Otherwise, neither you nor Yue'er will come to a good end. When the time is right, I'll find you a proper wife—don't be so desperate."

He turned and left, leaving Ah Qing standing there with a face full of loss.

Having dealt with the nephew, Chen Lin summoned his sister and rebuked her in hushed tones.

"You're supposed to be a proper young lady—how could you do something so shameless? To actually..." He couldn't bring himself to mention seeing her bellyband, so he shifted course. "Ah Qing is your nephew! Do you have a death wish? If the clan finds out, they'll drown you in a pig cage!"

Chen Yue fell to her knees in terror, admitting fault again and again, begging her brother not to report her.

"Don't be afraid." Chen Lin's voice softened slightly. "I'm your elder brother, and Qing'er's uncle too. Even though you've done something disgraceful, I have to cover for you. I've already ordered him to burn everything you gave him. The earrings he gave you don't matter—keep them, but don't wear them in public. If anyone asks where they came from, tell them I bought them for you. Understand?"

"Yes, Brother." Chen Yue was frightened out of her wits; whatever her brother said, she would obey.

Chen Lin sighed heavily. "Danger lurks everywhere right now. Don't stray onto the wrong path. One misstep leads to another, and before you know it, there's no way back. At that point, not only will your lives be forfeit, but I won't be able to survive in this clan either. Stay away from Qing'er as much as possible, and stop living alone." He considered for a moment. "Big Girl Li mentioned wanting to take on an apprentice textile worker. You'll move into her room and learn from her."
