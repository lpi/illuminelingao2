# Chapter 2557: Conspiracy in the Hermitage

Lin Jian could see his student's thoughts drifting, his face clouded with worry over his mother's grave illness. "I came looking for you today because I want to help," the teacher said. "A trusted friend has invited me to a secret gathering this afternoon. I've heard that among those attending, there's an accomplished master well-versed in medical arts. Perhaps he could cure your mother."

Zhang Jiayu's expression brightened at once. He instructed his sister Shibao to watch over their mother, bid farewell to his father, and set off with Lin Jian toward Huangcun.

When Zhang Mu learned the meeting would be held at Li Yunlong's dharma site, he wasted no time deliberating. He ordered his servant boy to saddle his horse and rode hard, encountering no obstacles on the road. Within the span of an incense stick burning, he arrived at Huangcun. Compared to renowned Buddhist temples like Nanhua Temple, Huashou Terrace, and Guangxiao Temple, Yan'an Hermitage was modest in scale—a typical Lingnan structure of only two courtyards, with gray brick walls and gray-molded ridge tiles. Situated in a remote area and recently built, the temple attracted few incense-burning pilgrims.

After tying his prized horse's reins to a post, Zhang Mu knocked on the heavy main doors. Moments later, a thin, gaunt monk emerged. It was Li Yunlong.

Zhang Mu could hardly conceal his surprise. He hadn't seen Yanke in so long, and the man had grown terribly haggard. Gripping his old friend's shoulders, Zhang Mu exclaimed, "Yanke! I hope life has treated you well since we parted!"

"Amitabha. Muzhi—after all these years apart, I have missed you greatly." Li Yunlong's expression remained serene as he replied.

The two stepped into the hermitage and spoke of worldly affairs, though Li Yunlong showed little interest in such matters. Zhang Mu wasn't surprised. He knew Li Yunlong had once served as an advisor in Yuan Chonghuan's army. After Yuan Chonghuan's execution, Li Yunlong had returned home in bitter disillusionment and, having seen through the vanity of the mortal world, shaved his head and taken monastic vows. Years ago, when they had shared lodgings, Yanke had told him: "You are a man of hot blood. But don't you see? What heroes cannot accomplish—once one turns back, all heroic schemes reveal themselves as foolishness."

From that day forward, the world lost the Li Yunlong who once wrote, "A scholar need not set aside his sword—traveling far to join the army, carrying his prodigal spirit." Remembering how Superintendent Yuan's command had once gathered the most brilliant talents of the age, Zhang Mu felt a pang of melancholy. Now all had withered and scattered to the winds—who knew where they had gone?

"If Yanke has renounced worldly affairs," Zhang Mu asked, "why extend an invitation today?"

Footsteps sounded behind him, and a voice answered: "Don't blame him, Muzhi. It was I who arranged this meeting."

Zhang Mu turned to look. The newcomer was Su Guansheng—courtesy name Yulin—a native of Dongguan city. As Zhang Mu recalled, the man's examination record was unremarkable. At thirty, during the seventh year of Tianqi, he had only gained admission to the prefectural school. By the seventh year of Chongzhen, he had become a *bagong* (tribute student)—the advancement path for *shengyuan* (licentiates) who failed to pass the *juren* examination. Zhang Mu himself preferred chivalry to Confucian scholarship, and his ambitions lay outside the imperial examination system. For this reason, he and Su Guansheng had rarely crossed paths.

"May I ask what matter brings you to summon me, Master Su?" Zhang Mu inquired.

"To oppose the Bald Bandits and restore the Ming, naturally." Su Guansheng answered without hesitation.

Zhang Mu laughed. "Aren't you afraid I'll report you to the Fake-Hairs in the city?"

"Everyone invited today is a loyal patriot devoted to sovereign and country. Word will not leak." Su Guansheng's confidence was unshaken. "The Bald Bandits have many eyes and ears within the city walls, so we had no choice but to borrow Master Eryan's temple for our gathering."

"It seems you've been preparing for some time, Master Su," Zhang Mu said with a chuckle.

Before long, over twenty people had filtered into the hermitage, most of them from local wealthy families. The Lingnan region had been steeped in superstition since ancient times, with worship of various gods and Buddhas flooding through the populace. Temples and Taoist monasteries dotted the landscape, and as religious sites where all manner of people might enter and exit, they provided excellent cover. Once all attendees had arrived, the hermitage doors were sealed shut, and someone was posted outside to keep watch.

After surveying the room, Su Guansheng cupped his hands in salute to the assembly. "All who have come here were invited by their closest relatives and trusted friends—people whose backgrounds are known to us. Now that our mountains and rivers have been so drastically altered and Guangzhou has fallen into bandit hands, we who have received the nation's grace for generations must strive with all our might to repay the Sage Emperor."

The moment he finished speaking, someone echoed his sentiment: "Exactly! These sea pirates are obviously no descendants of the Great Song. Not only do they refuse to recognize the previous dynasty's merit titles, but they've stripped us of our tax exemptions! Now they speak of remeasuring land and levying progressive taxes up to fifty percent. It's simply intolerable—we must drive them out."

"Indeed! They even tax us for keeping a few household servants. People have started calling the Senate 'All-Taxes' instead of 'Almighty.'"

"Dressed-up monkeys wearing crowns! Since when are overseas barbarians qualified to collect our taxes? They should get out of Dongguan!"

Indignation swept through the room, the atmosphere charged as if the attendees were ready to storm the county yamen and tear every Fake-Hair to pieces.

Su Guansheng gestured for quiet. "That we can unite against our common enemy—if the Sage Emperor knew, he would surely be pleased. But the Bald Bandits invaded two years ago, and their foundations grow deeper by the day. On the day their army entered the city, we could not resist. How much less can we now? If we wish to oppose them, we must plan carefully and devise a proper strategy."

"What strategy do you have in mind, Master Su?" asked a young man named Li Zhen. He was a friend of Li Suiqiu, had studied at the Imperial Academy in the capital during the early Chongzhen years, and was also acquainted with Chen Zilong.

"As the saying goes, one chopstick breaks easily, but ten bundled together hold firm," Su Guansheng replied. "I believe we should widely befriend righteous warriors, secretly practice military arts, and gather firearms and blades. When the Court's punitive army arrives, we rise in response—attacking from inside and out to drive the Bald Bandits from our lands."

"Master Su, since the Bald Bandits came, they've bestowed favors upon the rabble. The common people have been seduced by their gifts. Look around at this gathering of twenty-odd souls—loyal men are few and far between. How can great things be accomplished with such numbers?"

"What you don't know is this: I have made contact with Master Jinyan, the righteous warrior of Dragon Mountain. Master Jinyan risked great danger to personally enter enemy territory and has already recruited several thousand stalwart fighters." Su Guansheng gestured toward one of the attendees. "Allow me to introduce Master Jinyan's disciple—Guan Yuesun."

In truth, Su Guansheng knew that due to the Australians' bandit-suppression operations, even if Master Jinyan had three heads and six arms, gathering a force of several thousand would be impossible. But to draw more people into the cause, what harm was a little embellishment?

Guan Yuesun stepped forward and saluted the assembly. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with the given name Guan Zhongxi—Yuesun being his courtesy name.

"My teacher has personally visited Ganzhutan and Huashan," Guan Zhongxi said. "He has already persuaded the Ganzhutan remnants and the Huashan bandits to serve as our armed forces. He has also secretly placed disciples within the Fake-Hair National Army, where they have grown familiar with the Bald Bandits' military methods. Additionally, major clans from Nanhai, Xinhui, and Xiangshan have pledged their support, providing us with several thousand local militia. If we could gain the assistance of everyone present, wouldn't it be like a fish finding water, like a tiger gaining wings?"

Su Guansheng nodded with satisfaction. "If each family here contributes manpower and resources, assembling an army of ten thousand would not be difficult."

Zhang Mu had always harbored ambitions to serve his country, and he felt his emotions stirring with the fervor in the room. But having passed thirty, he was no longer an impulsive youth. After calming himself to think more carefully, he recognized the magnitude of what was being proposed. Wang Zunde and Xiong Wencan had led regular armies against the Bald Bandits and still could not match them. What chance did a motley force of several thousand have?

"From what I hear, our great cause already has a small foundation," he said. "But the Bald Bandits' firepower is formidable, and several thousand stalwarts are likely no match for them. Moreover, before moving troops, grain must go first. To gather military funds and weapons under the Bald Bandits' very noses, we will need additional support."

"Hahaha! Muzhi is indeed a chivalrous warrior with frontier aspirations—thoroughly thoughtful." Su Guansheng laughed heartily. "You're correct. Allow me to introduce an extraordinary personage to everyone: Daoist Mushi."

"Daoist Mushi?" The crowd exchanged puzzled glances, having never heard the name. Whispers rippled through the room.

At that moment, a figure emerged from behind the Buddha statue, bearing the ethereal countenance of one touched by immortal wind and Taoist cultivation.

"The Daoist is skilled in strategy, proficient in military arts, and possesses considerable accomplishment in medicine," Su Guansheng praised. "A rare and difficult-to-find personage indeed."

"Master Su flatters me." Daoist Mushi held a whisk in one hand while stroking his beard with the other. "I had heard that Dongguan was the Lingnan hometown of Confucius and Mencius—the hometown of Sacred Teachings. Seeing it today, this poor Daoist is not disappointed." He paused. "I was entrusted by Stone Elder to come deal with these overseas barbarians, and I am willing to join hands with all of you to drive out the Bald Bandits."

"Who is Stone Elder?" someone asked.

"Stone Elder is my master's title. Because treacherous officials in the Court have already colluded with the Bald Bandits, it is inconvenient to reveal his true identity."

Murmurs spread through the assembly. Treacherous ministers in the Court colluding with the Bald Bandits! No wonder these pirates had operated in Qiongzhou for years with such ease. Their wings had grown full, and now they posed a grave threat to the dynasty itself—truly a case of raising a tiger only to court disaster. The Bald Bandits were hateful, yes, but the treacherous ministers at court deserved death even more!

"I have a proposal," Su Guansheng said. "Since Master Jinyan could secretly place righteous warriors within the Bald Bandit National Army, why can't our Dongguan stalwarts do the same?"

Someone sighed. "Yulin, how can you not know? The Bald Bandits' cadres are all Fake-Hairs brought from Qiongzhou—they have no use for scholars like us. Their civil service examinations don't even test the Four Books and Five Classics; they only recruit common rabble. As for studying the Bald Bandits' books from a young age... I've heard some families have arranged for their concubine-born sons to attend Australian schools. But those children's thoughts become indistinguishable from the Bald Bandits themselves—completely bewitched."

Daoist Mushi had been listening carefully. Since the eyes and ears previously planted among the Australians had been eliminated in the Witchcraft Case, he urgently needed fresh intelligence about the Bald Bandits' inner workings. "If someone could infiltrate the Bald Bandit False Court," he spoke up, "it would be crucial to our great cause. Are there any stalwarts willing to enter the tiger's den for the Sage Emperor?"

Lin Jian, hearing this, quickly nudged Zhang Jiayu and whispered, "Jiayu, this is your opportunity. I was wondering how to ask the Daoist for medicine on your behalf. Why don't you volunteer?"

Zhang Jiayu hesitated. He had come here seeking medicine for his mother, never expecting to find himself at an "Anti-Bald Assembly." He had little connection to these wealthy families; he had only been drawn here by the accomplished master Lin Jian had mentioned. Listening to their grand plans for overthrowing the Bald Bandits, he felt entirely out of his depth. Yet his teacher's prompting gave him pause.

In truth, he harbored no great aversion to the Australians. If anything, he appreciated their good works among the poor. In Guangzhou, he had studied Australian learning alongside fellow members of the Shen Ao Academy, freely debating the great transformations sweeping the world—changes unprecedented in a thousand years. Chief Du had shown considerable interest in him; he could sense that both Chief Du and Daoist Cui harbored intentions of recruiting him into their service.

And yet—he had studied the Four Books and Five Classics since childhood, learned the ways of Confucius and Mencius, and earned his academic honors under the Great Ming. With the Sage Emperor still living, how could he switch allegiances? How could he ever face his teacher and parents?
