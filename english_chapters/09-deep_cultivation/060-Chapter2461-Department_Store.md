# Chapter 2461 - Department Store

"Hit people?! This Master is beating a dog!" Master Xia's momentum did not diminish, looking very much like he wanted to beat Manager An as well, "Don't think of sliding past the matter of Fifth Concubine!"

Seeing a dispute arise, Chen Lin found it inconvenient to go out for the moment, so he stopped his steps to wait for the situation to calm down.

It was nothing for powerful households to bully others and slap a few assistants. The first requirement for a shop assistant was to swallow anger. From starting as an apprentice, being beaten, scolded, and bullied was common daily fare. No matter how bullied, insulted, or even beaten, one had to welcome with a smiling face.

Although Manager An came from a merchant family, he had learned business since childhood. Opening a shop to do business, encountering unreasonable customers was common. Business talks emphasized harmony bringing wealth. Encountering this kind of customer, one always advised with good words, enduring a small loss rather than conflicting with the customer. But today this matter was really too bullying. He sneered:

"Fifth Concubine is not my family's person. She has legs and goes where she wants. Why come to me to demand the person? Master Xia had better go out quickly to find the person; don't waste time here in vain and delay your master's business!"

Master Xia flew into a rage and shouted: "You old bastard! Think I don't know! Without that lewd slut of your family seducing and abducting, would Fifth Concubine run? If you don't give an explanation today, don't think of keeping this shop open!"

Hearing the words "lewd slut," Manager An showed anger on his face, gave a cold snort, and said: "This is not Ming territory; it's not your turn to run wild! Eighteen, blow the police whistle!"

An assistant responded and immediately ran to the street surface. In a while, a sharp whistle sound came from outside.

Master Xia's face changed instantly, and he turned to go out. Manager An blocked the door sideways, sneering: "Master Xia! The whistle is blown. When the police come in a while, I'll close the shop and we'll go together to the station to argue rights and wrongs! See if my shop can stay open! These two slaps weren't for nothing!"

Master Xia pushed and shoved, wanting to leave, but Manager An just wouldn't let him. He got anxious and shouted: "Quickly do it!"

The servant gave a slap to the head, knocking Manager An dizzy and causing him to fall to the ground sitting. Master Xia took this gap to seize the door and exit, and the servant also leaped out following him, escaping away.

Seeing this, Chen Lin hurried out, helped Manager An up, and asked concernedly: "Manager An! Are you okay?"

Manager An shook his head, blinked twice, saw it was Chen Lin, and said: "I'm fine, many thanks little brother..."

At this time, assistant Eighteen also returned. The two supported Manager An left and right to stand him up. Eighteen said: "The patrol police will arrive immediately..."

Before the voice fell, the clattering sound of iron-soled leather shoes running already rang outside. Two patrol police officers entered from the shop door and asked: "What happened?!"

Manager An immediately recounted the matter roughly. The leading policeman said: "Person ran away?"

"Yes, but I know who he is..."

"Since that's the case, you come to the station first to make a record. We will summon the person tomorrow and then process it." The policeman looked at the situation in the store, "Which one was beaten? Is it him?" saying so he pointed to Chen Lin with his chin.

Chen Lin hurriedly said: "Not me."

Manager An hurriedly said: "He is a customer here to look at goods; this matter has nothing to do with him. The one beaten is an assistant in the shop, resting in the back. The person was beaten unconscious and can't get up."

"You send the person to the health center, ask a doctor to take a look, and bring a diagnosis certificate to the police station tomorrow."

Chen Lin had seen many Australian police in Guangzhou, but it was the first time seeing police handling a case directly. He felt fresh. He saw the two policemen handling things methodically, first inspecting the scene, then questioning people present one by one and making records. Only this policeman taking notes was really not very brilliant, often asking Manager An how to write a certain character.

After finishing the records of the people in the shop, the policeman called Chen Lin over for questioning. Manager An said: "He is a passing customer; he was talking to me in the counting house just now and didn't come out, seeing nothing..."

Chen Lin knew this was Manager An's kindness, not wanting him to get into trouble. But today's matter, the person surnamed Xia really bullied people too much. Chen Lin, relying on being a "Guest of an Elder" and knowing a thing or two about Australian police administration, said generously: "I saw it all at the door just now. I will be a corroborating witness." Immediately he told the past situation in full detail and signed the record.

"Listen for news tomorrow," the policeman put the documents into the file bag, "Come to the police station to process it then. You, this..."

"My surname is Chen."

"Living at Jasmine Hotel, right? If there's nothing, we won't look for you. If you need to appear in court, a notice will be sent to you—will you be in Lingao recently?"

"Definitely within three or five days." Chen Lin didn't know such a matter still required "going to court" and was somewhat nervous, "If there is a summons, I will definitely arrive."

The patrol police left. Chen Lin saw it was getting late and hurriedly bid farewell. Manager An was somewhat guilty: "...Shouldn't have dragged you in."

"Don't say words of an outsider; we colleagues are one family. How can we let them bully for nothing! Besides, this is under Australian rule; it doesn't tolerate them acting like high-and-mighty masters!"

Manager An laughed: "Good, good, unexpected that although little brother came from the mainland, your thinking is very new! Indeed a hero out of youth! Please come to the shop to chat when you have time."

Delayed by this matter, Chen Lin dared not stroll leisurely anymore, running straight to the Friendship Department Store along the main street.

This Friendship Department Store was one of the two major department stores in Lingao. Following the map along the main road, he soon arrived near Bopu Bay. His vision suddenly opened up. In front was a circular square, paved entirely with bricks and stones, very flat. In the center stood a statue, which was a statue of a leaping general in military uniform on horseback. Chen Lin was secretly curious: *Who is this person? Could it be some famous general of the Great Song?* Walking over and seeing the inscription below, he knew this was the statue of Han Fubo General Ma Yuan.

*Right, the Australian army is the Fubo Army, and this Qiongzhou Prefecture was also pacified by Ma Yuan crossing the sea. Australians erecting his statue also has this origin.*

The Department Store building was at the southeast corner of the square. Looking from afar, heads were moving in front of the building, clearly showing prosperous business. The main building was only three stories high. From architectural style to volume, it was roughly no different from county department stores of the seventies. However, in the eyes of most people in this timeline, this was already a "huge mansion." Standing at the top of the building was a line of huge Song typeface characters: "Develop Production, Prosper the Market." The huge characters, fully a person's height, plus the red color, gave people a strong visual impact from afar.

The positioning of Friendship Department Store was "Mass Market." According to Li Mei, it was the positioning of "countryside" business. Because Bopu was located centrally in the county and near the sea, merchants traveling from outer counties and the mainland to Lingao mostly transferred buses and ships here. The large flow and gathering of people naturally formed unlimited business opportunities.

Since it was positioned for "countryside" business, it couldn't be too particular about "taste." It had to have the shocking sense of "this is a big city," but couldn't be too luxurious and modern, making people feel the fear of "this is not a place I should enter." Therefore, Li Mei rejected various high-end tall-and-fancy design plans in the planning stage, choosing the simplest rectangular building, and limiting floors to three. Structures liked by various Senate public buildings, such as high atriums, verandas, roof gardens, and curved stairs, were all unused. Except for some crushed glass sandblasted patterns on the wall for decoration, the entire building could be called unadorned. This made Chen Lin, who had seen Great World and Longhao Bay Hotel, somewhat disappointed—too ordinary.

He strolled leisurely inside the building. The layout here was different from the Great World in Guangzhou. Great World was actually more like a shopping mall of the old timeline or a lower-end "Market Street." Friendship Department Store was still a traditional counter store. The first floor was the tall and brightest, with a floor height of nearly 5 meters. Although large gas chandeliers were installed here, to minimize safety hazards due to the gathered crowd, large glass windows were used on the first floor. Large floor-to-ceiling glass windows made of countless panes, each nearly ten square meters, tried to introduce natural light and reduce dependence on artificial lighting.

However, this also brought side effects. For engineering considerations, a considerable part of the panes of these huge windows could not be opened. Therefore, in summer, scorching sunlight would enter the room in large quantities, and the ventilation volume was insufficient to lower the indoor temperature. Given the huge volume of the Department Store building, the various air conditioning systems available to the Senate were far insufficient to cope. So in most seasons of the year, awnings had to be supported outside the windows.

Only in the current season did the sunlight shining through the huge windows make people feel comfortable.

The first floor of the Department Store sold high-frequency consumption goods. Chen Lin didn't know what "Fast Moving Consumer Goods" meant, but from the counter layout and corresponding signs, he could roughly see that the first floor sold food, alcohol, tobacco, candy, toiletries, hardware, and general merchandise. Although there were many varieties, a dazzling array, some high-end consumer goods familiar to Guangzhou people like "National Scholar Unparalleled," "Nanhai Cigars," "Limu Mountain Oolong"... were nowhere to be seen. The counters sold mostly medium and low-end goods.

Even so, Chen Lin was still "shocked" by the wide variety of goods here. Not to mention anything else, just the fermented bean curd sold at the food counter here has more than ten different varieties. There were simplest fermented bean curd, wrapped in vegetable leaves, matched with wine lees, with chili, fragrant, spicy, smelly, sweet... all kinds available. And purchasing was also very convenient. For retail, one didn't need to bring one's own container; there were specialized bamboo-woven small oil paper baskets in the store. There were also specialized gift packages; outside the basket, they would put an exquisite box for you, paper, wood, or bamboo, diverse and beautiful to look at, but the price went up.

*These Australians doing business truly rack their brains and haggle over every penny.*
