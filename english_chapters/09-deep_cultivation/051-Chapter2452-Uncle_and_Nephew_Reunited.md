# Chapter 2452 - Uncle and Nephew Reunited

Chen Ding could not be considered a scholar, but he understood the principle of "look at nothing contrary to propriety." He felt that staring at the girls like this was very rude, so he hurriedly shifted his gaze away. But before long, he couldn't help stealing glances again. It wasn't necessarily that these girls were exceptionally beautiful. His wife and chambermaids were not bad looking either, but these Australian girls exuded a special charm that made him unable to resist looking.

Faint fragments of their conversation drifted over with the wind, but Chen Ding couldn't understand much because they were speaking "New Language." They seemed to mention words like "new perfume... department store." Suddenly he saw a girl turn her gaze towards him. Thinking he had been discovered, he hurriedly glanced aside, but this glance landed on an acquaintance.

His nephew Chen Lin was by the gunwale not far away. Obviously, he had just been stealing glances at the female students too.

The gazes of the uncle and nephew met in the air, and both were stunned. Apart from surprise, their faces were full of embarrassment.

It just so happened that a "faint" sentence drifted through the air at this moment: "Hmph, old pervert!" mixed with laughter. Now, both the uncle and nephew blushed.

Chen Ding had never expected that this nephew, who had sent someone to deliver a letter to Master Wu just over ten days ago saying he wanted to stay in Nansha, would turn up on the boat to Lingao in the blink of an eye. Could some change have occurred in Nansha Village again? Had his third brother come up with new tricks?

Originally, for a reunion after a long separation and so many trials and tribulations, the uncle and nephew should have been pleasantly surprised and tearful. However, reuniting in such an awkward environment, both withdrew their gazes in unison and pretended not to know each other.

Wu Yijun did not know his cousin-nephew was also on the ship and was talking loudly with the accompanying Huo Maixiong. Originally, he couldn't be bothered to pay attention to this leader of the declining paper guild. But his lavish spending at the auction had aroused Wu Yijun's curiosity: where on earth did he find the money to make such a desperate investment? The money for a paper mill was not a small sum; the transfer fee was just the beginning, and more money would be spent later.

The movement of funds in the market was always the issue Wu Yijun was most concerned about. "Money has legs" was a phrase he often said. Where large sums of money flowed meant where new opportunities were. Money would not flow into someone's hands without reason; it must be that this person had some special use.

Unexpectedly, this Huo Maixiong was a wily old fox. No matter how Wu Yijun tried to extract information, he always managed to circle around it, keeping his mouth shut about where the money came from.

Wu Yijun was feeling disappointed when suddenly he was poked in the waist. turning his head, he saw it was Chen Ding. Before he could speak, Chen Ding said in an extremely low voice, "Lin'er is here too?"

"What did you say?" Wu Yijun was startled, thinking, *Are you confused from seasickness?*

"He is right on the ship."

"Why don't you call him over?"

"No, no, don't call him." Chen Ding was too embarrassed to mention the "chance encounter" just now. "Anyway, we all have to get off at Lingao. We can find him after disembarking."

"What tricks are you playing?" Wu Yijun still didn't understand.

"Sigh, anyway, don't greet him now. Let's just pretend we don't know him."

The steamship gradually approached the port. During the Second Five-Year Plan, in order to solve the problems of poor water depth conditions and small throughput at Bopu Port, two new ports were planned and built in Lingao. One was located at Xinying Port in the west of the Special Municipality, serving as Lingao's main external passenger and cargo port in the future, and construction of the Xinying-Urban Area city rail line began simultaneously. The other was at Hongpai Port in Ma'ao Bay. Although the hydrological conditions here were generally inferior to Xinying, the Bopu-Ma'ao city rail had already opened to traffic. Disembarking at Ma'ao, both passengers and cargo could be quickly transported to Bopu via this city rail and then transferred to the whole city.

The birthing port for the *Baiyunshan* was Hongpai Port.

Hongpai Port was originally built to support the Ma'ao Iron and Steel Works. Entering Ma'ao Bay, the *Baiyunshan* first saw Hongpai Islet. A fortress had been built on this bare little rocky island specifically to guard the bay. On the bastion, the muzzles of heavy cast-iron cannons stared grimly at the strait. The Morning Star flag fluttered on the central observation tower, which also served as a lighthouse. Sentries with live ammunition, wearing greatcoats, stood like stone statues at their posts, gazing at the bay.

There was a commotion among the crowd on the deck. For people visiting Lingao for the first time, this scene was too "Auto-Song" (Australian-Song), fitting people's imagination of Lingao under the Senate's rule perfectly: solid stone buildings, giant cannons, elite soldiers...

The whistle of the *Baiyunshan* gave a long blast, followed by a cannon shot from the fortress. The group of giggling girls on the deck all stood at attention and bowed fifteen degrees; the Fubo Army soldiers and police in uniform saluted the flag on the fortress together. Naturalized cadres stood at attention and performed an eye salute. The sentries at the post presented arms in return.

Although Chen Ding, Wu Yijun, and the other natives on the deck didn't know what this was about, they could feel the atmosphere on the deck instantly becoming solemn and respectful, and they couldn't help but stop their conversation and laughter.

As the ship sailed past the fortress, Chen Ding sighed with emotion: "The Australians truly live up to their reputation!"

Wu Yijun had been in Guangzhou for a long time and was used to the Australians' style, but the scene just now still touched him greatly. It was not surprising for soldiers, police, or "cadres" to behave like this, but for a few little wenches to be like this too—the Australians' art of controlling subordinates had truly reached a state of perfection. No wonder the chronic illnesses that baffled capable officials under the Ming rule were handled cleanly in the hands of the Australians! It all relied on these "naturalized citizens" who directed like arms and fingers!

"Impressive, impressive." He couldn't help speaking to himself in a low voice.

His mood was quite complex. Speaking of it, he was indeed somewhat happy. Being able to cling to the steel giant ship of the Australians meant that not only himself but also his descendants would enjoy endless benefits; but this ship of the Australians was not easy to board, and getting off was as difficult as ascending to heaven. Once on board, one could only follow with wholehearted devotion and dead-set loyalty.

Chen Ding did not have so many thoughts, only saying excitedly: "I have long heard that the Australians govern the country with military law; truly majestic!"

As the ship sailed past the Hongpai Islet Fortress, many towers, pipelines, and chimneys appeared on the coastline, spewing black smoke and white steam into the sky. The sea breeze also brought a pungent smell and a rumbling roar. On the wharf stood crane towers like iron pagodas and loading belt conveyors lying like giant dragons; huge bulk silos and open-air piles of slag and coal ash stood like small hills.

For the natives witnessing this for the first time, the impact given by this scene which exceeded their cognition far surpassed that of the fortress just now. People gazed nervously at the coastline. Someone said: "This is the Ma'ao Iron and Steel Company, specialized in smelting iron..."

"Just like the iron workshops in Foshan?"

"Yes, almost."

"Good heavens, how much iron do they have to smelt? How can they use it all?"

"Australians use iron to build ships and pave roads. You calculate how much iron that takes."

"Then, won't all the iron in the world be dug up by them?"

...

Chen Ding had been looking for the legendary "Iron Giant Ship," but while there were many ships in Ma'ao Bay, including large ships no smaller than the *Baiyunshan*, the big iron ship was nowhere to be seen. He only learned from Chen Xiaobing, the naturalized cadre accompanying them this time, that the ship was docked at Bopu.

"...This place was originally just a desolate bay. There were only salt-boiling households and fishing Tanka people on the coast. After the Elders came, they first built windmills at the Ma'ao Saltworks here; then they built blast furnaces here and raised the Ma'ao Iron and Steel Company..."

"Windmills?"

"You can't see them here; they are on the other side of the peninsula."

"Why use windmills for drying salt?"

"To lift water. Don't you need seawater to dry salt?" Chen Xiaobing laughed, "It's different with windmills. The saltworks that originally only produced five hundred tons of salt a year has now become a large saltworks with an annual output of ten thousand tons."

"Ten thousand tons?" Chen Ding found it hard to believe. He knew that one Australian ton, equivalent to the Australian "kilogram" commonly used in Guangzhou now, was one thousand *jin*. A single household used only a few dozen *jin* of salt a year. "So much salt, how can it be consumed?"

"Haha, this salt is not for eating." Chen Xiaobing couldn't help laughing, immediately making Chen Ding feel very ignorant. "It is used as chemical raw material."

"What is chemical raw material?"

"This..." This somewhat stumped Chen Xiaobing. He actually knew very little about chemical engineering. Among the naturalized citizen group, the place everyone was least willing to go was chemical enterprises. "It's using salt, coal, and various other things to make useful things. Like fertilizers, pesticides. By the way, since you want to open a cotton spinning and weaving factory, the dyes used for dyeing in the future are also made by chemical factories."

Chen Ding thought to himself, *This is probably what everyone often says about Australians having the power of ghosts and gods, seizing the wonders of creation.* What could be made from salt? He racked his brains but couldn't understand. Salt, after absorbing water, became brine; adding more water made saltwater; burning it with fire to coagulate it still made salt blocks. No matter how you worked it, it was salt. How could it turn into other things? It was a pity Master Wu was opening a cotton spinning factory, not some "chemical factory," otherwise he could have used this chance to understand it.

The *Baiyunshan* gradually moved away from the steel plant wharf, and the number of ships docked in the harbor increased. The most numerous were ocean-going freighters carrying bulk cargoes such as coal, iron ore, and sea salt. Next were the steam barges sailing along the coast, docked row upon row in the bay.

"Look, Australian warships!" someone shouted on the deck. Chen Ding looked in the direction of the voice. Sure enough, a majestic warship was docked on the coastline on the other side of the bay, surrounded by three or four small speedboats. Ma'ao was not the main base of the Fubo Army Navy, but due to the need to guard Lingao, a naval base unit was deployed here, stationing a naval detachment fleet, including two Type 901 gunboats retired from frontline service and four two-masted cutters.
