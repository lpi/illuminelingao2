# Chapter 2554 - Subsequent Issues

"My personal recommendation is that for this paper cotton incident, the best approach is to pretend we didn't see it," Chu He said.

"?" At this, both Li Shan and Zou Biao stared wide-eyed in astonishment. Such a major speculative incident, a financial storm, and he was saying "pretend we didn't see it"?!

"This..." Li Shan said in surprise. "It's such a big deal."

"I'm not being alarmist—this is actually the shared view of our finance circle." As Chu He spoke, Ren Youzi also nodded slightly.

"But cotton is a livelihood material. This behavior amounts to cornering the market and disrupting it. It could certainly be treated as economic crime..."

"Economic crime, that's not a problem. But cornering the market doesn't quite apply," Chu He said. "And the risk is relatively not as great as you gentlemen imagine."

Paper cotton wasn't market cornering. It was different from the "Two Whites and One Black" campaign in Shanghai just after Liberation. There were no problems with spot cotton circulation itself—prices were just high and cotton was scarce, but there was no hoarding. The main problem with paper cotton was unregulated speculation.

"Secondly, the greatest risk in futures isn't selling delivery receipts—it's that these delivery receipts are margin trades, meaning you can pull extremely high leverage at the trading center. The current Guangzhou paper cotton hasn't adopted the margin system; it uses full cash payment for warehouse receipts. So there's no high-risk leverage trading. Third, contemporary futures operations actually allow risk hedging—you can't only buy long, you also need to allow shorting. You need both bulls and bears for hedging..."

Seeing that both men across from him wore utterly bewildered expressions, Chu He gave up on further explanation and summarized directly: "Anyway, you just need to know that this paper cotton business won't cause a serious financial crisis. Many people's wealth will certainly get washed away, but it'll be limited to them and those around them. It won't have a major impact on the overall financial market. In this regard, I must say that traditional strict lending systems have also limited the crisis's expansion."

"You're saying this time won't cause turmoil?"

"There will certainly be some turmoil, but it won't be major. It won't affect social stability. You can rest assured about this," Chu He said. "According to our estimates, the total amount involved in paper cotton speculation won't exceed 150,000 yuan. Relative to the overall scale of the cotton textile market, it's not very large."

"150,000 yuan—that's already staggering!" Zou Biao said. "Many people in this city only earn two yuan a month!"

"People earning two yuan a month don't have the capital to join this game. To participate, you need to be able to produce at least a hundred yuan on demand from your household—especially in recent months, when no warehouse receipt has been priced below fifty yuan."

Fifty yuan was a significant sum not just for ordinary Guangzhou citizens and villagers, but even for mid-level naturalized citizen cadres. The scale of speculation was actually quite considerable.

"Even so, the scale of speculation this time is already substantial. I think we should establish a state reserve system to reduce the risk of such incidents in the future..." Zou Biao said. In the 18th century, cotton and cloth were definitely strategic materials, perhaps second only to grain but no less important than coal and iron. For such strategic materials, establishing state reserves was the most effective means of managing abnormal price volatility.

"...Establishing national reserves makes sense both politically and economically. Take this paper cotton affair—when the market collapses, if the state reserve steps in with large-scale purchases, it wouldn't be an economic loss, because in the long term cotton prices will still rise. At that point, whether the reserve releases to the market at a slight premium or at par, either works."

Li Shan watched Chu He and Ren Youzi's expressions. Both were listening attentively, occasionally nodding slightly, but from their subtle expressions, it was clear they were completely dismissive of Zou Biao's suggestion.

"Strategic material state reserves are certainly very reasonable, but honestly speaking, there's no necessity for it now, and it wouldn't solve any problems," Chu He said. "It might even create other problems."

"Why?!"

"First, this paper cotton crisis doesn't affect supply—we just explained that. It's only a primitive, crude futures market; cornering isn't the same thing. Establishing state reserves is certainly an effective means of regulating market order. But the premise is that we need to have supplies. If supply barely covers production, how do we reserve anything? So expanding cotton supply sources is currently far more important than storing cotton. Only after we have stable supply sources and surplus cotton in the market to support reserves can we talk about state reserves. Right now, shipping capacity from the South Seas, India, and Northeast Asia is all limited. These places haven't formed specialized cotton cultivation like they would later. Cotton planting area and output are unknowable, and there's no stable cotton supplier. So state reserves are hard to establish in the short term. And once established, state reserves become another huge organization—behind the storage there will inevitably be enormous losses, and we'd need to establish a complete inventory auditing system. The Senate's current state grain reserve system is already stretched thin. Adding cotton is out of the question."

Ren Youzi continued: "Why does everything need state reserves? If factories sign long-term agreements or forward contracts directly with plantations, market fluctuations should have almost no impact. During economic upswings, some small businesses going under isn't a big deal—someone will take over soon enough. If we really must give everyone a means of speculation and hedging, we still need to take the proper futures contract route. Honestly, given the current situation, there's not even much necessity for a futures market."

Chu He added: "At this stage, if we're going to do futures, the main direction should still be forward transaction price agreements aimed at physical delivery, not jumping straight to a futures exchange—once leverage comes in, all bets are off. Take big steps and you'll tear something."

Li Shan and Zou Biao were completely befuddled by the two men's eloquent discourse, but they couldn't think of any specific rebuttals. After all, they hadn't come here to debate.

"Alright, you've said all this. But specifically, how do we 'not intervene'?"

"First is banning paper cotton trading. Then investigating all the warehouse receipts currently on the market. Those without physical shops or that aren't even in the cotton-cloth industry—purely fictitious receipts—that's economic fraud. Handle it as economic fraud. Those who bought such receipts are victims. When the criminals are caught, recover the stolen goods and return funds proportionally. Of course, full recovery is unlikely—they'll just have to consider it an expensive lesson."

Needless to say, regardless of whether the criminals could even be caught, recovering all the stolen funds was even more fanciful. Li Shan smiled wryly: "That's quite an expensive tuition!"

"If it weren't expensive, how would it count as a lesson?" Ren Youzi continued: "For warehouse receipts genuinely issued by cotton-cloth merchants, regardless of the final market outcome, they're the ultimate clearing entities. When due, require them to honor the receipts. If they can't, handle it as bankruptcy. This falls under economic disputes. Try and adjudicate according to relevant statutes. Of course, we'll give them an opportunity: negotiate with receipt holders to buy back receipts at a certain price—that depends on how the negotiations go."

"In the end, it's all for nothing," Li Shan continued. "Another tuition payment."

"Naturally. Speculation always carries great risk," Chu He said. "Paper cotton actually has neither a compliant issuing entity nor a margin system to guarantee delivery. It could absolutely be classified as fraud. It's just that this problem isn't a futures problem per se—actually, the whole corporate governance system and fiscal-financial system are severely lacking in relevant laws and regulations."

He had been thinking about this problem for a long time. Now the topic drew out his thoughts.

"For example, the current push for company registration. We've actually introduced the modern limited liability company system without the corresponding corporate governance requirements. There are issues of apparent authority, shareholder rights, bona fide third parties, equity transactions. All huge pitfalls.

"Actually, this isn't related to paper cotton itself. Mainly, after this financial risk started emerging, I suddenly felt we should take stock of current corporatization reforms in Guangzhou.

"The current corporatization reforms—so-called limited liability companies, foundation legal persons, religious legal persons, and so on—are actually very dangerous reforms in the current timeline.

"Several fundamental issues will embed enormous risks.

"First, after large numbers of commercial entities become legal persons, especially with the introduction of 'limited liability,' where's the corresponding bankruptcy and liquidation system? With multi-layered shareholding and no complete commercial registration and data accumulation, how do you pierce the corporate veil? How do you find the actual controllers? The risks of money laundering, tax evasion, and lawbreaking will rise dramatically. Especially if bureaucrats set up several layers of shell companies and engage in insider trading or simply move money from left hand to right, turning public funds into private gain—it becomes extremely difficult to investigate. Are we going to rely entirely on Cheka for internal investigations?

"Second, lending risk: in a timeline without sound credit systems, as long as there's collateral it's fine. But what about companies mutually guaranteeing each other and committing loan fraud?

"Third, commercial registration data can't possibly interconnect. Once you leave Guangzhou, you basically can't look things up. So what about identity issues in commercial contracts? How do you resolve apparent authority issues? You say verify seals and signatures—these things in the Ming Dynasty are basically freely replicable. How do you handle that? In ancient commerce, people knew each other personally. Now with legal personhood, how do you identify clerks or account managers?"
