# Chapter 2548 - Hidden Concerns

Why were the Australians also purchasing cotton? The Nansha factory had just started operations—tens of thousands of taels of silver invested without even seeing a ripple yet. If cotton prices continued rising so rapidly, how could the factory keep running?

Thinking further, the Guangzhou National Cotton Textile Factory was right next door to the International Market—such a large tract of land fenced off to build factory buildings. When it started up, wouldn't tens of thousands of spindles be running at once? It was perfectly normal for the Australians to start stockpiling cotton now!

However, if this were the case, future cotton prices would only rise with the tide. Chen Lin's heart couldn't help but tighten.

But Dong Jizhong's next words reassured him somewhat: "However, cloth prices have also risen recently. I've heard the Australians have been buying in large quantities."

"Why would the Australians themselves need to buy in such large quantities?" Chen Lin was intrigued and asked.

"Do you know about the Nanyang Company?"

"Yes, yes—it was just established not long ago. They say it's for developing the South Seas..."

"Developing the South Seas means sending landless and displaced vagrants from various places to Annam and the South Seas to reclaim and farm land. These people need food, drink, and clothing. Farming needs seeds and tools. Don't the Australians have to prepare all of this? Surely they can't send them off with bare bottoms and empty hands?" Dong Jizhong laughed. "Right now in Guangzhou, it's not just cotton cloth that's rising—grain and all sorts of miscellaneous goods have risen too. Even hardware items that used to keep falling—even the cheapest iron nails have risen considerably. Why? Because these are all items the migrants need!"

Dong Jizhong's words enlightened Chen Lin like a revelation. He had been so immersed in factory affairs these past days that he hadn't paid any attention to the outside market.

"I see! A merchant should be observant in all directions, keeping constant track of market conditions!" he said self-reproachfully.

"Young man, you needn't blame yourself," Dong Jizhong laughed. "Since cotton cloth prices have risen sharply, cotton yarn prices have naturally increased quite a bit too. Whether you have cloth or yarn, selling now will earn you a tidy profit. Currently, the average price of cotton cloth in Guangzhou has risen by fifteen percent, with mid-to-low grade cotton cloth rising even more."

He seemed to remember something: "As for the cotton matter, I'll go speak to the manager about it as soon as I get back. Since you're Old Wu's cousin and the manager of the Nansha factory, you're one of us now. I'll definitely help with this properly—I absolutely won't let you return empty-handed."

"Thank you, Master Dong!"

"You don't need to thank me. We're family!" Dong Jizhong looked at him with a knowing expression. "Old Wu has mentioned you to me many times in the past, saying you're the most honest and hardworking young man from a respectable old family. Now that I've met you, I see it's indeed true. With you at Nansha, I can trust the operation!"

"Yes, I will always remember your grace in recognizing my humble abilities."

Seeing that the young man before him was quite perceptive, Dong Jizhong nodded to himself approvingly.

His father and elder brother were both officials in the Ming realm. Besides their salaries, various gray incomes were quietly remitted back to Guangzhou through Delong's channels in the north—that was one source. But relying solely on their gray income was actually quite limited, since both father and brother were military officers, and they weren't stationed in places like Liaodong where fortunes were easily made. Their gray income was really quite modest.

To maintain the family's comfortable lifestyle and prevent decline, investment was the only path. The Nansha Textile Factory was currently the Dong family's largest investment project.

He now had a very favorable impression of Chen Lin. Though his commercial acumen was clearly not as sharp as Wu Yijun's, he was definitely someone who could get things done.

"This International Market is an excellent place to learn about market conditions. Renting a storefront here—the business itself is secondary; the key is knowing this rapidly changing market. The Australians certainly have vision and ideas!" Dong Jizhong said. "The streets of Guangzhou are paved with gold, if only you'll pick it up—I didn't used to believe that, but now I do. There's no wine here, so let me substitute tea for wine to toast to your prosperous business and abundant wealth." With that, he raised his teacup.

Wu and Chen hurriedly raised their cups in return to toast Dong Jizhong. After another round of pleasantries, Wu Yijun saw that it was about time and signaled to Chen Lin. The two made their excuses and departed.

Chen Lin had originally wanted to discuss cotton procurement further with Dong Jizhong—since the Dong family had connections in the north, this was a long-term solution. He hadn't walked more than a few steps after leaving when he complained: "...I still had some things to say to Master Dong."

"What's the rush?" Wu Yijun laughed. "It's just about the cotton business. Don't worry—though he's a wastrel, he still cares about his own business affairs. We who serve shouldn't spoil his mood. It's about that time..."

"What time?"

"Look at that clock tower over there—can you read the Australian numerals?"

"Aren't those just Arabic numerals? It's almost two o'clock."

"I didn't expect you to know quite a lot!" Wu Yijun glanced around surreptitiously and said: "Look across the street."

---

Seeing his uncle's furtive demeanor, Chen Lin knew this wasn't some proper matter. Not daring to make any obvious movements, he merely shifted his gaze slightly—and saw a small sedan chair arrive at the teahouse entrance. The proprietor and waiters all came out to greet it. The curtain was lifted, and out stepped a woman in Ming-style dress...

"Could this be Master Dong's..."

Wu Yijun nodded silently. After they had walked quite a distance, he said in a low voice: "This is a woman Master Dong recently took as a concubine. It hasn't been made official. Since he finds too many prying eyes in the city, he bought her a courtyard here in the living quarters and rented a storefront for her to run."

"What? Letting a woman run a business?"

"What's so strange about a woman doing business?" Wu Yijun laughed. "There are plenty of women running wine shops in the city..."

"Those are all small businesses. But the businesses here in this market are all major dealings!" Chen Lin said, puzzled. "Besides, Master Dong himself isn't from a merchant family and doesn't understand the ways of business. What kind of business could he set up for a woman to run?"

"Who said there's only big business here? Isn't Zone A for small businesses? This woman's shop is in Zone A, dealing in export goods like fine embroidered fans and handkerchiefs. Though the business just opened, she's already taken several orders from the Europeans."

Wu Yijun said with a touch of envy: "This Master Dong really has a way with things—managing to get himself such a woman! Capable and beautiful."

Chen Lin wasn't particularly interested in such gossip. He asked: "Uncle, where is our storefront located? I see there are quite a few people here looking at storefronts..."

"You don't need to worry about that. I've already identified a suitable storefront and had the manager submit a bid yesterday. Though it goes to the highest bidder, there are plenty of storefronts in this market. The one I chose isn't on any particularly auspicious location—probably no one will compete with me for it. Most likely I can get it at the base price."

They were here for wholesale business, which wasn't as sensitive to storefront location as retail, so they had no intention of investing too heavily in the lease.

With that, Wu Yijun led him to a storefront in Zone B. The doors were wide open, with workers renovating inside. Timber and bricks were piled everywhere.

Wu Yijun told Chen Lin that the annual rent here was two hundred yuan. By Guangzhou standards, this was the going rate for a top-tier commercial space in a busy district.

"Though the rent is expensive, you get what you pay for. I've also bought a courtyard in the living quarters here. I'll be spending quite a bit of time here from now on."

"What about your dried fruit business, sir?"

"I've handed it over to Ah Huan. He's nearly thirty now. He doesn't need me watching over him every day." Wu Yijun was quite emotional. "I'm approaching fifty and should know my destiny by now. While my body is still serviceable, I need to hustle for a few more years. Opportunities to make big money like this don't come along casually."

The two strolled through the market, chatting briefly with merchants they knew, discussing current market conditions for relevant goods. Though some storefronts weren't officially open yet, the workers and managers were already in place, and they went in to chat with them too.

By the time they completed their circuit, it was already past four in the afternoon. They took a ferry back to the Guangzhou urban area. Wu Yijun was in high spirits and had food and wine prepared. The two drank together and discussed business matters—their grand plans for the future, naturally.

Compared to the enthusiastic Wu Yijun, Chen Lin wore a worried expression. Seeing this, Wu Yijun consoled him: "Ah Lin, are you still worried about cotton? Don't worry—Master Dong will definitely help you resolve it. He certainly won't let the factory shut down. After all, he has a stake in it too..."

"Uncle, that's not what I'm worried about," Chen Lin said. "What concerns me most right now is the price of cotton... From what I gathered from people at the market today, I fear there may be a great storm brewing."

"Are you talking about paper cotton? As long as we don't speculate, nothing will happen to us!" Wu Yijun waved his hand dismissively. "Besides, the cotton market in the second half of the year might be even higher."

"Uncle, have you considered one thing? Cotton prices have skyrocketed, and though cotton cloth and yarn prices have also risen, the increase is much smaller than for cotton."

The market's cotton supply hadn't increased; in fact, it had even decreased in the short term. But cotton cloth and yarn production had surged due to the introduction of new machines, actually causing a downward pressure on prices.

"...I just compiled the cotton cloth quantities and prices from the past few months' *Commercial Monthly Reports* for the Nanyang Company's purchases, then compared them to prices before this year's rally. After factoring out the price increase caused by the Nanyang purchases, the actual price of cloth has fallen."

This caught Wu Yijun's attention. He set down his wine cup and asked: "And then?"

"The Nanyang Company is just a company—there's a limit to how much cloth it can buy. Moreover, last month its purchase volume already decreased by half compared to the previous month. If it continues to decrease this month, there will be a surplus of yarn and cloth on the market, and prices will inevitably fall..."

A typical situation in commodity markets was that people chase rising prices but not falling ones. Once a commodity's price began to fall, panic selling often ensued, further depressing prices. Breaking through cost price could happen in an instant!
