# Chapter 2563: Past Events at the Academy

"Jiayu, long time no see..." A friend from the Shen Ao Academy greeted Zhang Jiayu, who had suddenly appeared at the academy.

"Have you seen Chief Du recently?" Zhang Jiayu asked anxiously.

"He was here just yesterday; Chief Du even asked about you."

"Where is the Chief?"

"The Chief's main position is Magistrate of Enping County; he can't stay long in Guangzhou. He's departing today. If you hurry, you might still catch him at Tianzi Wharf..."

"Thanks!" Not waiting for his academy friend to finish, Zhang Jiayu had already flown out, leaving a room full of people with question marks.

Moments later, the sweat-drenched Zhang Jiayu intercepted Du Yibin at Tianzi Wharf just before he boarded the ship.

Du Yibin found Zhang Jiayu's behavior today somewhat strange—this wasn't like his usual self. But hearing the situation he described, he could immediately understand. Truly a filially pious person.

"I thought it was something important? This is just a small matter." Du Yibin laughed and then ordered someone to bring out an instruction slip, upon which he began to write.

"Woo-woo-woo..." The whistle of the Senator-exclusive vessel sounded, reminding Du Yibin to hurry aboard. The busy Senate's time concept was calculated in minutes; even Senators had to abide by established rules.

*Lin Motian should recognize Guangzhou Senators' signatures; there shouldn't be much problem.* Du Yibin thought. He hadn't brought his personal seal on today's return to his post, so he signed his own name and handed it to Zhang Jiayu.

A note merely palm-sized, the characters on it even more crooked and twisted, yet Zhang Jiayu held it at this moment like a treasure, examining it repeatedly. This one note could save his mother's life! He quickly stored the note properly and hurried toward the Great World.

"Chief Lin..." The office clerk girl from the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital knocked on Lin Motian's office door. Finding no response, she pushed open a crack and peeked: "Eh? Not here either?"

The girl looked at the instruction slip in her hand, not knowing whose request it was this time. These special requests one after another were enough to keep the Chiefs busy. Thinking this, she left the slip on Lin Motian's desk and withdrew.

"Hey, young fellow," the office clerk girl returned to the hospital lobby and called out to Zhang Jiayu: "None of the Chiefs are in their offices. Look, it's already getting late today; go back first. Come again tomorrow. Only after the Chief signs can medicine be dispensed."

"But my mother is seriously ill, on the brink of death. Could you please be flexible?" Zhang Jiayu was somewhat anxious.

"Young fellow, everyone has a heart of compassion; moreover, saving the dying and healing the wounded is our mission. If it were ordinary wind and cold, giving you a few pills wouldn't be a problem. But to mobilize controlled materials, it must have a Chief's signature. Without rules, there's no order. If everyone were a special case, who would the Chiefs save first?" The girl said somewhat unhappily.

"But..." Zhang Jiayu thought: these Bald Bandits put on official airs quite distinctively.

"But what? This penicillin isn't malt candy that you can eat whenever you want. Heard the allergy rate is extremely high; one must prepare epinephrine before daring to use it on patients. Today's epinephrine in the pharmacy was exhausted in emergency treatment; only the Joint Logistics warehouse has stock. If the patient has an allergic shock and dies, you couldn't even cry them back." The girl, busy all day, was somewhat impatient. She very much disliked people coming with approval slips.

Many special-effect medicines were available sometimes and not other times; besides having money, one also needed luck. But certain people could just get approval slips, squeezing out those who paid and queued. This was too unfair! So while she was polite to these people—after all, couldn't afford to offend them—she was very contemptuous at heart.

"Allergy? Epinephrine? Joint Logistics? Shock?" Zhang Jiayu had no concept of the strings of new words popping from the girl's mouth, completely not understanding. He only understood one word—"die"—and instantly felt utterly disheartened.

"Medicine is three parts poison; it can save lives but can also kill. This isn't some immortal elixir that cures all diseases. Without complete preparation, who dares use it? Don't be anxious; come back tomorrow to check." The female clerk was a talented conversationalist; she had ample experience dealing with people like this.

Zhang Jiayu wanted to argue further but knew he had no standing here. Even under Great Ming's rule, he was merely a *xiu cai*, not qualified to "make a scene in public," let alone on Australian territory.

*Under someone's eaves, one must lower one's head.* Thinking of this, Zhang Jiayu had no choice but to turn and leave.

Watching Zhang Jiayu's gradually blurring figure, the girl shook her head helplessly. The hospital was the most warm-hearted place in the world, yet also the most cold-hearted place.

Shen Ao Academy had rented a courtyard for members among the "temple property" outside the Five Immortals Temple—actually, Old Cui only collected a token rent. The purpose was to facilitate short-term stays for active members from other places. Zhang Jiayu didn't have much savings, so he settled his mother in a side room of the academy's rental courtyard.

Seeing his mother in this condition, and considering their acquaintance, the fellow members staying there all felt unable to bear it and gathered together to think of solutions.

Everyone said if Chief Du had personally gone to the hospital to give instructions, the situation would certainly be different. It was just Zhang Jiayu's bad luck that he happened to miss Chief Du's schedule. If he had returned one day earlier, sigh.

Suddenly, someone shouted: "I've got it!"

"Got what? Don't startle people!"

"Tomorrow, Mayor Liu is going to lecture on new policies at Nanhai Academy, while also introducing the newly appointed Nanhai County Magistrate to citizens. They say new officials light three fires upon taking office; we can go plead with him. It will surely work."

"Is this reliable? The Chiefs are all busy with ten thousand things a day; will they care about the life and death of an ordinary commoner?"

"What do you understand? For an official, reputation is most important. Don't the Chiefs always say 'An official who doesn't make decisions for the people might as well go home and sell sweet potatoes'?"

"Right, right, right, I remember now. This new County Magistrate's background is rather special."

"Oh, how special?"

"A few days ago, *Yangcheng Express* had a headline. The new County Magistrate came from the industrial field and has an elegant title called 'Pharmacist.' It's said all Great Song's miraculous medicines came from his hands..."

Before this person finished speaking, he was interrupted by others: "Why didn't you say so earlier!"

"Who told you not to read the newspaper..."

"The new County Magistrate is also surnamed Zhang. Maybe five hundred years ago he and our Jiayu were one family. If we could acknowledge common ancestry..."

"Dream on!"

...

Listening, Zhang Jiayu's heart kindled a faint hope, and he perked up a bit. He hadn't expected that during these days he was away, so many new things happened in Guangzhou city.

Nanhai Academy, that is, Nanhai County School, was the highest official school of ancient Nanhai County. Founded in the Southern Song dynasty, it later changed location three times due to wars. In the thirtieth year of Zhiyuan under Emperor Shizu of Yuan, it moved to the old site of Jupe Shrine in Gaogui Ward in Western city. In early Yuan, the two county schools were squeezed together, quite cramped. In the third year of Hongwu in early Ming, the Court decreed all counties establish schools. Each dynasty expanded it further.

Wei Bifu had recommended former Nanhai County Magistrate Huang Xiyin to Zhang Xiao. Now Huang Xiyin was guiding Zhang Xiao on a tour of Nanhai Academy, reciting its historical evolution like treasures from his own collection.

"Chief, look. To the east of the county school there was originally Qingyun Road; over long years, nearby residents built dwellings along the road, burying the road. Three years ago, this student led people to restore the old site and also renovated the two memorial archways." Huang Xiyin spoke of this matter with considerable pride.

"Mm, Council Member Huang's execution capability is not bad." Zhang Xiao nodded. Knowing that Liu Xiang clearing illegal structures on Chengxuan Street also had to rely on the Fubo Army's bayonets meant Huang Xiyin indeed had some ability.

The academy faced north-to-south. Buildings on the central axis from south to north were: the main gate Lingxing Gate, then Ji Gate, Jukui Tower on the left, Dacheng Hall in the center, with continuous large buildings on left and right sides. Behind Dacheng Hall was Minglun Hall; the library was behind.

At this time, Nanhai Academy occupied over sixty *mu* of land, far exceeding later times in scale. The academy vicinity was the densest area for private academies in Guangzhou city.

After the Senate entered the city, the academy was requisitioned as the Nanhai County Education Bureau office and Nanhai National Demonstration School. Later it became Guangzhou Municipal National Demonstration School, with the Simple Normal School also affiliated here—as the "headquarters" of education throughout Liangguang.

Today, Liu Xiang was to lecture on new policies while also introducing the new Nanhai County Magistrate to Guangzhou society. The venue was chosen at Nanhai Academy.
