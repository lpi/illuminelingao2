# Chapter 2658: The Capital (Part 14)

Li Rufeng nodded in agreement and said, "Yes. The Son of Heaven, since ancient times, is made by those with strong soldiers and sturdy horses. The Great Song occupies Lingao, building high walls and accumulating grain broadly. Only after ten years of planning and ten years of biding time did we achieve today's strong army and wealth. We should have pointed our banners north, wielding golden halberds to sweep away the barbarians, and holding fine bows to punish the disobedient. The construction slaves usurping the Ming are just petty clowns. Once the grand army arrives, they will instantly collapse. Orders will settle the four directions, and within a month, the world will change masters. Slow in claiming kingship is fine, but if slow for too long, one loses the heart of enterprise. Lingao is a nest of brocade and embroidery; the Purple Light Tower is a village of gentleness. The Senators play with the wind and moon all day long, hesitant and indecisive like little girls. I don't know what they are doing."

Liao Sanniang said softly, "Silence. The court situation is treacherous; do not discuss it recklessly."

Li Rufeng realized he had misspoken. He sighed lightly and coughed to cover it up, saying, "We have to select a few steady and skilled hard hands. Sooner or later, we will have to go out of the city."

Liao Sanniang looked up, thought for a moment, and said, "Zhao Liangjian counts as one. He is from Jingxing in North Zhili, served as a 'Ma Lang Hand' [Dragonfly Catcher/Bandit Scout?], and is skilled in using flying stones. He can take out a person's eyes within twenty paces. He is meticulous, experienced, and prudent in action. He can be relied on. Liu Chang, an archer from Xuzhou, is good at shooting and is clever and sharp."

Li Rufeng nodded. "Fine. I'll pick two more. Chen Cui, a 'Mao Hulu' [Mountain Bandit/Militia] from Henan. He can climb houses and ascend roofs, walk mountains and cross ridges, is skilled in using short weapons, and has seasoned *Jianghu* experience. Sun Changtou, originally a warrior monk from Funiu Temple. He has great strength and stature, has smashed through prefectures and counties outside for many years, and is well-traveled and knowledgeable. He is familiar with using a staff. Choosing a few more besides them should be enough."

Thinking of these people, Liao Sanniang said softly, "They did not come from Lingao, but all are people who keep faith and value righteousness. With their skills, they could kick open a piece of territory anywhere, whether as soldiers or bandits. They are willing to take five or six taels of food and wage silver here every month simply because they don't want to bully the weak or kill the innocent indiscriminately."

At this point, both fell silent for a while. The hall fell into a brief silence. In the dim evening light, everything looked old and dirty. Dust and sand poured in from the open hall door, making the two figures standing one behind the other appear chaotic and blurred.

After a short while, Li Rufeng broke the silence. He stroked his beard, hesitated, and then said, "Do you say there really will be news?"

Liao Sanniang shook her cloak, walked to the hall door, raised her face to look at the sky, and said, "There will be."

The few pale white pockmarks on Liao Sanniang's nose bridge were illuminated by the dim afterglow, reflecting a faint white light, like a few scattered cold stars in a dark night. Liao Sanniang's tone was confident and firm, without the slightest wavering, seeming to answer Li Rufeng, and also seeming to speak to herself.

When Leng Ningyun woke up, his brain was in chaos. For a moment, he was confused about where and when he was, actually feeling he was still napping in the office of the fund management company back then.

Feeling his mouth and tongue dry, he said groggily, "Little Li, pour tea!"

In a moment, a cup of tea was indeed brought to his lips. Leng Ningyun took a sip in his confusion and felt comfortable all over. He smiled, "Little Li, you don't know, I just had a dream. It was really interesting! I'll tell you about it when we eat next time..."

"The Master can say it anytime; this slave loves to listen." A woman's charming voice sounded by his ear.

"Hey, what Master? Call me Sir—" Leng Ningyun suddenly shuddered. *Wrong! Wrong! How would Little Li call me Master?! When feelings are strong...*

He opened his eyes abruptly. In an instant, memories flooded into his mind like a tide. He woke up immediately.

*Bad! I've been kidnapped!*

Before coming to the capital, Leng Ningyun had received comprehensive training from the External Intelligence Bureau at the "Farm." When lecturing on the dangers of overseas activities, they focused on how to prevent kidnapping and how to handle it once kidnapped.

If it were a simple kidnapping for ransom, he actually wouldn't worry. Kidnapping was nothing more than seeking wealth. To obtain the ransom, the kidnappers wouldn't easily take his life. With Delong's influence in the capital, spending money to eliminate the disaster would solve the problem.

But alas, the kidnappers today were not seeking wealth!

Thinking of this, Leng Ningyun secretly regretted his recklessness, having his soul hooked instantly by that letter.

Thinking it over, he still couldn't get rid of the shadow of "abandoning the gun and fleeing" at the camp back then. Although no one had mentioned this matter in these years, he always considered it a shame. He didn't hesitate to risk his life repeatedly to prove himself...

This time, speaking of it, was also a momentary obsession. After all, the bait thrown by the other party was too tempting. If he could get a clear answer, it would be no less than detonating an atomic bomb in the Senate, and he could take this opportunity to become a "rising star" attracting everyone's attention.

A momentary obsession had actually led to such an end. Thinking that he hadn't even notified Wu Kaidi, Hexiang, and the others, nor left a single piece of written document... he broke out in a cold sweat instantly.

*I brought this upon myself; I cannot live!*

Thinking of this, Leng Ningyun was filled with regret and almost fainted again.

"Master, drink a few more mouthfuls." In his daze, he heard the woman from just now speaking in a low voice.

Leng Ningyun opened his eyes. It turned out he was lying on a Babu bed [Canopy Bed]. The curtains hung low around him. The speaker was a young woman kneeling on the bed feeding him water.

"Where is this?" he asked in confusion.

Seeing him wake up, the woman did not answer but said in a low voice, "Master, do not talk too much. The drug hasn't worn off yet. Just rest well."

Leng Ningyun saw the woman was about twenty years old. From her appearance and dress, she looked like a maid of a wealthy family. Her accent, however, was not the Jianghuai accent of the capital's Mandarin, but carried a bit of the southern sound of Jiangnan.

At this moment, his whole body was sore and soft, without a bit of strength. Even his brain was dizzy. He knew the other party must have administered some drug to him to control him easily.

This made him very afraid. He didn't know what these messy drugs were made of or what consequences they would bring to his body. Even in the old spacetime, clinically tested anesthetic drugs still carried great risks, let alone these unexplained anesthetics with missing pharmacology in this spacetime.

However, no matter how unwilling he was at this moment, he could only be at the mercy of others. He was terribly thirsty just now, so he drank a few more mouthfuls of water continuously. Only then did he feel comfortable. Then he felt the urge to urinate. Ignoring shyness, he said, "I want to urinate. Help me up."

The woman responded, helped him up from the bed, leaned him against the bedside, fetched a chamber pot, and served him to urinate.

Leng Ningyun had been in the capital for several years and was somewhat accustomed to the life of ordering slaves and maids, but he still couldn't adapt to such service like a "disabled person." He hurriedly said, "I'll do it myself."

"Your legs and feet are inconvenient right now. Don't push yourself anymore," the maid said.

Leng Ningyun's hands and feet were weak at this moment. Let alone urinating by himself, he had to lean against the bed rail even to sit. He had to let the maid handle him. After fully enjoying the corruption of a landlord master, he was helped back onto the bed.

The maid brought a porcelain bowl and said, "Master Leng, you haven't eaten for a day. Just have some."

Originally he didn't feel hungry, but being mentioned by her, he suddenly felt his five viscera were empty. He thought, *Since I've been kidnapped anyway, I might as well relax.* Losing a Senator was a major event; both the Beijing Station and the Senate would spare no cost to rescue him.

Opening the porcelain bowl, a smell of milk fragrance slightly mixed with the scent of fermented rice wine wafted out. It was a bowl full of milk curd. The slightly yellowish curd was dotted with nuts and dried fruits. It instantly aroused Leng Ningyun's appetite.

He took a bite with a silver spoon. The milk fragrance was rich, and the taste was smooth and sweet. The craft of making this curd definitely came from a local wealthy family.

There was milk curd in Beijing in the Ming Dynasty, but compared to the later Manchu Qing, this food was rarer. Except for within the palace, only high officials and nobles and top-level brothels could taste such delicacies.

Leng Ningyun thought, *Indeed, the ones who kidnapped me are not some highwaymen, but some 'Big Shot'.*

As for who that Big Shot was, he seemed to understand somewhat in his heart, though vaguely. It was just how he wrote that letter that remained an unsolved mystery to him.

After finishing a bowl of fruit curd, Leng Ningyun felt comfortable all over. When the maid brought mouthwash, his spirit had almost recovered. After rinsing his mouth, he asked, "Who is your master? Why bring me here?"

The maid curtsied and smiled apologetically, "This slave is named Zhiling, ordered to serve the Master here. If the Master has any requests, just tell this slave. Just don't leave this room. As long as you don't go out of this door, the Master acts as a Duke for ten thousand generations..."

"Alright, alright, don't say it. I understand!" Leng Ningyun felt a wave of boredom. However, hearing her name was Zhiling, his heart moved, and he said, "Is your surname Lin?"

"This slave is not surnamed Lin. The name was bestowed by the head of the household," the maid said, still smiling.

"Listening to your accent, you seem to be a Southerner." Leng Ningyun used to mix in the financial circle and was very sensitive to people's accents.

Zhiling smiled slightly and didn't take compare notes with him:

"It is this slave's fortune that the Master is considerate of this slave. If the Master needs anything, just give a shout. This slave is just outside." After speaking, she retreated.

The door opened. In a glimpse, Leng Ningyun saw what seemed to be a small courtyard. The sky outside was pitch black, and he couldn't see anything clearly. Looking around, the room he was in seemed to be the east side room of the main house. The decoration, furniture, and furnishings were just at the level of a middle-class family, not particularly luxurious. The only luxury item was an Australian oil lamp in the room, illuminating the entire room.

From these furnishings and the condition of the room, he roughly deduced that this should be someone's residence. The sky outside was already dark, but he couldn't hear the sound of the watchman's drum. Obviously, he was not in the city, or even in Haidian Town. It was very likely he was in some landlord's residence in a village or a wealthy family's countryside villa.

It seemed the other party was well prepared.

At this time and place, he had to hold the thought of "take things as they come." He leaned against the head of the bed to rest: the power of the drug seemed not to have passed yet, and he felt weak and exhausted.

Just then, the partition door creaked open. The heavy footsteps of a man came through, followed by a voice: "Mr. Leng, how have you been?"
