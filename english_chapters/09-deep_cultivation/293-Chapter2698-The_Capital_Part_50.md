# Chapter 2698: The Capital (Part 50)

"What exactly is this medicine? Tell Laozi clearly!" The Teacher roared in exasperation.

"It is... medicine begged from Mr. Wu," Jieyi said hesitantly.

"Mr. Wu? Who is Mr. Wu?" The Teacher thought for half a day but couldn't recall the reason.

Zhou Lezhi, however, knew Mr. Wu was a "Person of Unusual Abilities" under Liu Sha, specialized in practicing alchemy and witchcraft. He turned pale with fright, thinking: *This person is half-human half-demon; you actually dared to provoke him!*

Fortunately, he was facing away from the Teacher at this moment, who couldn't see his expression. He hurriedly signaled Jieyi with his eyes, wanting her to pass the blame ambiguously and not implicate Liu Sha.

Unexpectedly, Jieyi was terrified and scared at this moment, confused and disoriented from the tossing about; where could she still notice Zhou Lezhi's eye signals? She said busily without delay:

"Mr. Wu is a Daoist under Second Brother Liu; heard he is a warlock from the Southwest..."

Zhou Lezhi's head went "Boom"; he cried out bitterly in secret. But at this time the words were already out; he couldn't remedy it anymore, so he could only watch the changes quietly.

Turns out she had been without offspring for a long time and inevitably lost her footing—although Zhou Curie was raised by her, speaking of it she could only count as a foster mother. Compared to Yourong having offspring, it was ten thousand eight thousand *li* away. Even though she entered the door first and was the senior, she couldn't match the curse of "Incense and Fire" [Lineage]. Going on like this, whether Yourong could be promoted to principal wife was hard to say, but she one hundred percent had no hope.

On ordinary days she hired doctors to regulate menstruation every month; having hired unknown numbers of famous doctors, all said her Qi and blood were normal and pregnancy wasn't a hard thing. Yet she hadn't conceived after serving the Master for these years, while Yourong had it not long after coming. This aroused great suspicion in her.

Suspicion was suspicion; she dared not reveal it—after all, Zhou Curie was actually a counterfeit, and she herself had "one soul and one spirit" collected by Liu Sha [was blackmailed/controlled]. It was just that after Yourong took her son to Zhaoqing, there was quite a meaning of exclusive favor; Mr. Zhou wouldn't come to her place a few times a month.

Originally unable to conceive, now he came less; if Yourong produced another male or female, she feared she would never have a chance to turn over in this "Zhou Residence."

In urgency, she walked the sword's slant edge [took a risk]. She heard Liu Sha say he had a subordinate Daoist named Wu Hai, skilled in various magic arts; among them was a type of Charm Medicine, most capable of bewitching human hearts. Once dosing was successful, it could make people infatuated with the doser, unswerving until death.

Jieyi was inevitably moved upon hearing this, so she sneaked out to find the Daoist master to beg for medicine. This Wu Hai was also straightforward; taking the silver, he told her to prepare some things...

"What things?!" Mr. Zhou's face became increasingly ugly.

"Master's hair, nails... and..."

"And what?"

"Master's XX..." Jieyi stammered out. Zhou Lezhi almost laughed out loud; he dared not look at the Teacher's face—probably it was already completely distorted.

"What other things? You speak them all together!"

The others were Jieyi's hair, nails, and XX. Zhou Lezhi once again felt the Teacher's breathing behind his back becoming heavy.

"What else!"

"No... no more!" Jieyi defended, "Other medicinal materials were all compounded by Daoist Wu; bondmaid doesn't know..."

"Not knowing, you dare add to my tea?" The Teacher slapped the table, questioning sternly, "Speak, which time is this dosing!"

"Three... no, the first time."

"Still not honest!" Mr. Zhou slapped the table, "Bring Family Law!"

Zhou Lezhi answered indiscriminately—truthfully he didn't know where the Zhou family's Family Law [tools] were, so he said to Jieyi: "Miss Jieyi, I see you better speak honestly. Don't let skin and flesh suffer! Answer carefully!" Saying so, he signaled her again with his eyes.

Jieyi noticed his eye signal only then. Thinking of Master Wang's instructions and threats, she felt a burst of flustered confusion, bracing her scalp to say: "Only three times."

"Where is the remaining medicine?"

"Compounded seven doses in total; still four doses unused, all in the Japanese lacquer vanity box in bondmaid's room."

Zhou Lezhi didn't wait for instructions, running into the East Wing room like a wisp of smoke, searching out the medicine—he was so active not for loyalty, but deeply afraid there were still some items that shouldn't be seen on Jieyi's side. If turned out by the Teacher, it would inevitably cause a great disturbance.

Now the matter already implicated Liu Sha and Wu Hai; if implicated deeper, he feared it would also harm the relationship between the Teacher and Master Wang.

Zhou Lezhi didn't want the Teacher to be hurt, nor did he want the Teacher to break with Master Wang.

Fortunately, after a search in Jieyi's room, no violating items were found. He sighed in relief, hurriedly delivering the medicine.

Mr. Zhou opened the medicine packet, looking at the neither gray nor black unclear pills in the paper packet, a nauseated expression floating on his face. Looking again at Jieyi with a face full of disgust, he waved his hand: "Call servant women to take her back to her room and guard strictly. Not allowed to go out or pass messages!"

Sending the weeping Jieyi back to her room, Zhou Lezhi rushed back again.

"You say she really only compounded these seven doses?" The Teacher asked.

Zhou Lezhi said awkwardly: "Perhaps... after all this medicine is Charm Medicine; what it stresses is rapid effect."

"Spoken with reason." The Teacher stared deadly at the pills, saying after a long while: "Tomorrow go find Liu Sha. I want to meet this Daoist Wu, see what messy things he compounded for me to eat!"

Zhou Lezhi said: "Teacher ah, this matter is probably not good to publicize."

"How is this said?"

"This Daoist Wu, I also know a little about one or two." Zhou Lezhi deliberated; since Wu Hai was already confessed by Jieyi, hiding couldn't hide it. Only by describing this person as a wandering fake doctor or jianghu small figure could this "Dosing Storm" be suppressed to the minimum scope.

"Oh? You know?"

"Yes, he is a hanger-on under Second Brother Liu. Said to be a Daoist, actually just a Wild Fox Zen [Quack/Fake], specially selling fake medicine, also making some aphrodisiacs and charm recipes to bluff people. Don't know how he connected with Miss Jieyi. Not some important figure. If Teacher dislikes him, say a word to Second Brother Liu and develop [fire/banish] him far away. If really going to question with flags and drums, everyone knowing, instead makes people feel Teacher has some... hidden illness, for example impotent or something..."

Hearing this, the Teacher's face stifled into complete redness: "Who the T-M-D [F*ck] is impotent! If impotent where did Curie come from! Where did Newton come from!"

"This matter after all is Teacher's boudoir matter; inappropriate to bring out for big publicity... Still ask Teacher to think thrice." Zhou Lezhi already had the grasp of handling the Teacher at this moment; speaking became more confident.

"Then... then can't just let it go like this! Ghosts know what formula this medicine powder is."

Hearing his tone, Zhou Lezhi knew the Teacher's fire head had retreated. Hurriedly said: "To distinguish the composition isn't hard either. I'll take it out tomorrow and find a pharmacy worker in an old shop to take a look and will know; eight or nine out of ten close."

"Good, just follow you!" The Teacher panted a rough breath saying, "You instruct Wang Zhi, say my meaning: Curie and the servant woman serving her move to the front courtyard study to live these days; don't live in the East Wing with Jieyi anymore!"

"Student understands." Zhou Lezhi trembled in his heart; it seemed Jieyi had completely lost favor!

"You handled this matter well." Master Wang nodded to express praise after hearing Zhou Lezhi's report. "This woman Jieyi truly has no weight or propriety; doesn't know good from bad!"

"Yes, just this Daoist Wu's matter..."

"No hindrance, I'll instruct Liu Sha to tell him not to show his face around here anymore in the future. This Liu Sha is also! How does he govern subordinates!" Dissatisfaction leaked out from Master Wang's voice.

"Then, how should Student report back to Mr. Zhou?"

"You just report to him, say Wu Hai unauthorizedly connected with female family members to sell medicine, already expelled."

"This medicine's composition... also must calm the Teacher's heart."

"I will instruct Liu Sha to ask for the composition. You find someone to look first; if there are any violating drugs, remove them!"

If there were any poisonous or body-harming drugs inside and Mr. Zhou saw them, it would inevitably provoke his unhappiness. Since eaten medicine couldn't be dug out, simply let him not know.

"Slow!" Zhou Lezhi was just about to withdraw to find Liu Sha when he was stopped by Master Wang. "Jieyi inevitably loses favor with Mr. Zhou; you must carefully deal with [appease] her. Don't let her catch madness; guard against her speaking randomly!"

"Student respectfully obeys!"

Although Jieyi wasn't a core figure, she knew quite a few secrets—especially the two secrets of Zhiling's end and Curie not being the Teacher's daughter.

Now Master Wang used "One Soul One Spirit" to coerce her. In case this Jieyi felt all thoughts were gray after losing favor and wanted to end it with death—one Jieyi dying wasn't important, but if she revealed all these secrets, the cooperation between Master Wang and the Teacher would also end here.

"I will instruct Wang Zhi that servants in Mr. Zhou's residence will all listen to your scheduling from today! Do not make me disappointed!"

"Student dares not!"

"How to deal with Jieyi, I still have to think about it." Master Wang closed his eyes, asking after a long while, "You say and see, how about sending another woman to him?"

"This, I fear isn't too appropriate."

"Oh, why? Doesn't everyone say this Mr. Zhou is very lustful?"

"Lustful indeed, but he is also a sentimental seed. As long as he had one night of joy with someone, he has a heart of pity and love, rarely restraining them. Once women are many he can't cope; I fear the residence will be even more chaotic."

"Hehe, didn't think you understand your Master quite well. Knowing Master none like disciple ah!" Wang Yehao laughed. "This Jieyi..."

"Student's bit of shallow view: Teacher still has sentiments for Jieyi; moreover there is still the daughter Curie present. Not looking at monk's face, look at Buddha's face. As long as this medicine's composition has no heart-piercing gut-rotting poison or fierce drugs, he won't bear a grudge against Jieyi for long."

"Saying so, you feel Jieyi can still be favored?"

"Even if not favored it doesn't matter. She has a daughter by her side; the Zhou family has her position—as long as she doesn't court death to make trouble again."

"So that's why you opposed getting another person for Mr. Zhou's room?" Wang Yehao's eyes suddenly stared deadly at him, seemingly wanting to see some clues from his expression.

The gloomy gaze made Zhou Lezhi tremble. If not for him truly having no interest relationship with Jieyi, this glance would really make him too guilty to look back.
