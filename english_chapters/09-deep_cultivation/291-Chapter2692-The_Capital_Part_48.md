# Chapter 2692: The Capital (Part 48)

In the three years after this, Zhou Lezhi spent most of his time in Zhaoqing, following the Teacher to write books and receive instruction.

"Shorn-hair Thieves are not things in the pool [ordinary]; I fear they have the ambition to transform into dragons."

Although Master Wang and Zhou Lezhi both suggested the Teacher take a few more disciples, Mr. Zhou expressed his energy was limited and could only do his best to cultivate Zhou Lezhi.

Although saying so, he still tacitly allowed Zhou Lezhi to take a few students himself—after all, Zhou Lezhi's time was also very precious now; many trivial small matters had to be shared with others.

Under Mr. Zhou's suggestion, Wang Yehao adopted an attitude of complete feigned deafness and muteness towards Shorn-hair Thieves, never interfering with their actions in Guangzhou, collecting Shorn-hair Thieves' bribes with peace of mind, and opening the door of convenience for them in Guangzhou. He only secretly monitored every move of the Shorn-hair Thieves through the forces controlled by Liang Cunhou.

If Shorn-hair Thieves moved blades and soldiers, the Royal Army would definitely lose. This was the judgment of the entire Old Man Stone clique. During his term, he naturally wasn't willing for such things to happen.

If one said Wang Yehao still had the idea of reorganizing the army and preparing arms to fight a battle with Shorn-hair Thieves when he first took office, as the materials collected by the *Yuyuan* Society became more and more, this kind of thought gradually vanished.

So these few years could be called calm wind and quiet waves. Although the Old Man Stone clique planned some actions successively, most were small skirmishes without much impact. If speaking of any gains, it was that they successively roped in a large batch of "Anti-Thief Righteous Men," strengthening their power.

As for money and wealth, now was the time Wang Yehao worried least. To him, the bribes given annually by Shorn-hair Thieves were already not worth mentioning. Now the biggest incomes were: firstly, when *Zi* brand firms issued non-preference shares, he bought ten thousand taels of silver worth of shares according to Mr. Zhou's suggestion; secondly, letting his subordinates open a trading firm to do business with Shorn-hair Thieves, earning pots and bowls full.

Having money, Wang Yehao continued to expand his "Industrial Base" in Dongyang, making various "gadgets" invented or improved by Mr. Zhou, also earning quite a lot of money. Of course, this kind of small skirmish couldn't satisfy Master Wang's appetite. Engaging in various speculations and doing business with Australians was his favorite. Acting as Governor-General these few years, although Master Wang worried about Shorn-hair Thieves' ambition and Great Ming's future every day, this didn't hinder Master Wang from doing business with Shorn-hair Thieves and earning a peck of gold daily.

Of course, Mr. Zhou's ambition didn't stop here. He sent people to Lingao, purchasing back many books and laboratory equipment, continuously enriching the studios in Zhaoqing and Dongyang. It was just that spending was not small, but results were not seen much. This caused quite a few criticisms among many people in the small clique. Someone suggested that since Mr. Zhou understood so many of the Shorn-hair Thieves' tricks, why not let him preside over the Cannon Factory to imitate Thief Cannons—Guangdong was originally famous for casting, and craftsmen good at casting guns and cannons were also numerous; with Mr. Zhou's guidance, they definitely could make sharp weapons comparable to Shorn-hair Thieves'.

Unexpectedly, the Teacher rejected it crisply and neatly, saying he wasn't familiar with the trade of casting cannons and military weapons; going to supervise cannon casting would instead cause trouble. He also said Thief Cannons were essentially no different from the Red Barbarian Cannons introduced by Great Ming, only the casting was more excellent. As long as enough funding was given, similar cannons could be made.

These words attracted dissatisfaction from many people within the Old Man Stone clique; Wang Yehao also had quite a few criticisms. Zhou Lezhi was also very strange; with the Teacher's ability, speaking of casting cannons, military weapons, warships, and gun carriages, he could speak with fervor and assurance, explaining the pros and cons of Chinese and foreign firearms clearly and distinctly. Why reject this assignment?

"It's not that I covet ease and comfort and am unwilling to preside; truly this matter I cannot do well." Hearing Zhou Lezhi's doubt, the Teacher smiled bitterly.

The Dao of casting cannons, he had never touched before. Although there were many materials on paper, put plainly they were just materials; taking them to guide cannon casting, there were too many craft details unclear within. Rather than going up to command blindly himself, better to let old masters continue working according to old rules—regardless of whether the cannons made were good or bad, at least they could be used.

"Just like what Teacher said about telescopes last time..."

"Correct. The Dao of making cannons sounds simple, but actually isn't easy—otherwise, why would Red Hairs still need to recruit cannon-casting craftsmen from Guangdong to go to Macao to cast cannons? Wasn't this Red Barbarian Cannon originally sold to Great Ming by their family!"

"Every trade has its specialization."

"This is right. Discussing knowledge of firearms, I naturally understand more than everyone, but to really do it, that belongs to another field. After all, regarding metallurgy and casting, I also only understand the fur and skin [superficial knowledge]. Forcing to do it will only delay affairs."

"Teacher is truly humble..."

"Not that I am humble; one must see clearly where one's ability lies." When Mr. Zhou spoke, he lay on the reclining chair very leisurely, eating lychees unhurriedly. "Besides, this Guangdong's Red Barbarian Cannon was originally made not bad; as long as craftsman silver isn't docked excessively, making a few good cannons isn't a hard thing."

"If Teacher went to preside, surely could spend less silver to make good cannons." Zhou Lezhi said, "Heard that of the silver allocated for casting cannons, only thirty or forty percent reaches the works..."

"Doing like this, I wouldn't live till next year." Mr. Zhou smiled bitterly, "Cutting off people's wealth is like killing their parents. Don't speak of me; even Lord Wang dares not do this. Harmonizing glory and mixing with dust [blending in] can keep peace. Cannons being a bit more expensive, casting fewer cannons, what does it matter? Anyway, having a few more cannons also can't deal with Shorn-hair Thieves."

Zhou Lezhi was dumbstruck; he didn't expect the Teacher to unexpectedly speak such disheartening words. He couldn't help saying: "Since so, what is Teacher still managing these things here for? Better to directly go defect to Shorn-hair Thieves."

The Teacher's gaze stayed on his face for a long while, being somewhat surprised and quite gratified. He said: "You speak very rightly." Saying so, he slowly rose from the bamboo couch, the expression on his face very complex. "The things I do here are roughly meaningless; what can be left behind is just a few shouts, that's all."

These words were inevitably too complex for Zhou Lezhi, yet the Teacher's expression explained that what he revealed at this moment were words from the lung and bowels [heartfelt words].

"Shorn-hair Thieves compared to Great Ming, who is strong and who is weak?" Unexpectedly the Teacher suddenly raised a question.

Zhou Lezhi thought slightly, then said loudly: "Great Ming's land is vast, common people numerous, annual taxes tens of millions, but outside are Eastern Barbarians, inside are Roving Bandits, national momentum declining daily; Shorn-hair Thieves' firearms are excellent, soldiers brave, good at the Art of Tao Zhu [Business], however land is low and people few, cannot last long. Comparing the two, strength and weakness are between five-five."

Mr. Zhou nodded lightly, expressing approval: "Your words, if turned back to the early Wanli years, might still work. But placed in nowadays, it is inevitably too optimistic. In my view, if Shorn-hair Thieves have the will to chase the deer in the Central Plains [conquer China], Great Ming will have ten thousand difficulties resisting."

"Shorn-hair Thieves only occupy a mere Qiongzhou Prefecture..."

"The Eastern Barbarians who are now the Court's confidant great trouble are also just Jianzhou's Wild Jurchens. Nurhaci initially was just a personal guard under Li Chengliang's command." A stifled expression of wanting to speak but unable to speak appeared on Mr. Zhou's face. "If I say, perhaps the Eastern Barbarians can enter to master the Central Plains?"

"This... Impossible, right." Zhou Lezhi felt it hard to believe, feeling these words were even more absurd than Shorn-hair Thieves chasing the deer in the Central Plains.

"What is impossible." Mr. Zhou lifted the teacup quite freely to drink a mouthful, moistening his throat, frowning: "Why does this tea always have a strange taste."

He continued: "Great Ming's situation is now dangerous like piled eggs. Trapped inside by Roving Bandits and natural disasters, trapped outside by Eastern Barbarians... and Shorn-hair Thieves. Like a person injured in fighting, unable to go back to recuperate well, but instead having to bind wounds to fight again—fighting several people at that. This person, no matter how strong, sooner or later will be worn to death..."

Zhou Lezhi recalled what he saw and heard these years, involuntarily feeling hair stand on end in horror.

"If Great Ming perishes, the remaining ones, whether Eastern Barbarians or Roving Bandits, all can't resist Shorn-hair Thieves. The Senate sooner or later will unify All Under Heaven." Mr. Zhou sighed with emotion, "Originally changing dynasties isn't considered any bad thing; as long as the world is peaceful, for common people it is always a good thing. It's just..."

Speaking to here, he didn't open his mouth for a long while: "If Shorn-hair Thieves get the country too easily, they will inevitably look down on the heroes of the world. Our conduct and actions nowadays are to let them know: Heavens and Earth have plenty of capable people and strange scholars, heroes and good fellows. Even if they win, we can't let them win too easily!"

Zhou Lezhi still didn't quite understand, asking: "Since so, aren't we doing useless things?"

"Correct," The Teacher nodded, "Have you read the *Chu Shi Biao*?"

"Both Front and Rear pieces have been read."

"Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions were merely doing human effort, to see if he could respond to Heaven's Mandate. We nowadays are also like this." Mr. Zhou rarely spoke so many words digging out heart and lungs [heart-to-heart] like today. Although Zhou Lezhi couldn't completely encourage [understand?], this meaning of "knowing it cannot be done but doing it anyway" was understood.

"Ai, Master Wang is still planning, wanting to grant amnesty to Shorn-hair Thieves."

"Amnesty?" Mr. Zhou let out a laugh, "Shorn-hair Thieves coming to Great Ming are rushing to Ask the Ding [aim for supreme power]; even if accepting amnesty for a time, sooner or later they will rebel. But never mind; if amnesty can be granted, we can also drag out a feeble existence for some time."

The matter of amnesty seemed to proceed with gongs and drums for a while. During the period, Wang Yehao frequently met various characters related to Shorn-hair Thieves. Among them, one named Li Luoyou was summoned for meetings especially many times. Zhou Lezhi heard this person was deeply connected with Shorn-hair Thieves; initially when Shorn-hair Thieves besieged Guangzhou, it was finally relying on him to intercede that eventually redeemed the city and lifted the siege. Many people said not only did he make big money doing business with Shorn-hair Thieves, he also set up a trade depot in Lingao, always trying to make Shorn-hair Thieves teach the art of firearms.

The Teacher heard Zhou Lezhi speak of this matter and was also quite interested. But his identity was confidential; except for people in the Old Man Stone clique, outsiders didn't know the existence of such a person as him. So he sent Zhou Lezhi to meet Li Luoyou once, to listen to what he saw and heard of Shorn-hair Thieves. And proposed to Master Wang to try to admit Li Luoyou into the small clique.

"This matter I actually thought about." Wang Yehao frowned slightly after hearing the Teacher's suggestion, "It's just this one is not an ordinary merchant. Not only are his connections in the Court deeply rooted and intertwining, the big shots behind him are also not idle generations. To accept him, I fear Student has to be the Senior Grand Secretary to do."
