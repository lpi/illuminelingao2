# Chapter 2603: Evidence of Guilt

In the main hall outside the County Magistrate's office of the Nanhai County Yamen, Zhang Jiayu—now a trainee advisor—sat absorbed in a book borrowed from Senator Zhang Xiao's shelf. The volume was titled *Political Gains and Losses of Chinese Dynasties*, its cover marked "Published by the Grand Library Truth Office, Compiled by Zhang Haogu."

Zhang Haogu had originally written "Authored by," but this presumption sparked fierce backlash. The Grand Library and a faction of Senators with backgrounds in literature, history, and philosophy mounted resolute opposition, arguing that Qian Mu had produced only a handful of works in his lifetime and that Zhang Haogu had no right to play "first come, first served" by claiming this masterpiece as his own creation. After a barrage of verbal and written attacks, Zhang Haogu had been forced to settle for "Compiled by."

Zhang Jiayu knew nothing of this little episode. These past days, his life had become a simple two-point line between the Provincial and Port General Hospital and the Shen'ao Society. Under the care of Lin Motian and Zhang Xiao, Mother Zhang's condition had steadily improved—she would be discharged soon. Today, Zhang Xiao had summoned him to the county yamen on business, leaving him with ample time to sit and read.

Closing the book, Zhang Jiayu reflected: *I never expected to find among these Australian Chiefs someone so learned in both past and present, with such clarity of vision as to analyze the political gains and losses of the Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties through the lens of personnel and institutions. Unprecedented. Court organization, fiscal taxation, selection systems, national defense and military affairs—these truly form a nation's foundation. We would do well to take them as warnings.*

Heroes have always recognized each other across the ages. Though Zhang Jiayu had no idea who this Zhang Haogu was, reading this work stirred genuine admiration: *The Australians are not merely "uncultured brutes" skilled only in "strange techniques and cunning devices."*

Yet he found himself caught in a dilemma. His mentor Lin Jian and sworn brother Zhang Mu were both entangled in Daoist Wood Stone's anti-Kun conspiracy, and he had somehow been assigned to infiltrate the Kun thieves' puppet court as an undercover agent. Judging by results alone, his mission had succeeded perfectly—he had become Zhang Xiao's trainee advisor almost effortlessly. But he could not deny that he owed an enormous debt of kindness to Zhang Xiao and the Senate. Repaying kindness with enmity was not the way of a chivalrous man. Yet standing idle while his relatives and friends were arrested was equally unthinkable.

In ancient times, Guan Yunchang had received Cao Cao's grace and appreciation, repaying it by beheading Yan Liang and Wen Chou on the battlefield. When he learned of Imperial Uncle Liu's whereabouts, he had resolutely abandoned glory and wealth, passing through five passes and slaying six generals, riding a thousand li alone to escort his sworn brother's wife back to the Han camp. At this age of bursting confidence, Zhang Jiayu planned to emulate the great general's example: he would solve a thorny problem for Zhang Xiao, then depart with a flick of his sleeves while ensuring his teachers and friends remained safe. This way, he could repay the Chief's kindness without betraying righteousness.

At that moment, a man hurried in from outside, his face bruised purple and patched with plasters. He clutched a stack of manuscript-like documents and wore a smile that seemed distinctly unfriendly at first glance.

This was Huang Xiyin, still bearing injuries from the beating Kuang Lu had given him two days prior. Seeing Zhang Jiayu holding a new-style book with an expression of deep contemplation, he stepped forward. "The younger generation is truly formidable. Such diligence, little brother—you'll surely have a brilliant future. I heard about your situation. You've won the opportunity to serve under the Chief's wing; don't disappoint his favor."

Zhang Jiayu rose and bowed. "Councilor Huang flatters me too much. Chief Zhang possesses both magical skill and a benevolent heart—a dragon among men. Thanks to the Chief for not discarding me, for ordering this humble Jiayu to follow him. I shall naturally strive to repay his trust."

"Is the Chief in his office?" Huang Xiyin asked.

"Commissioner Liu is conferring with him inside. Does Councilor Huang have urgent business?"

"Oh, then there's no rush. I'll wait." Huang Xiyin settled into a seat beside Zhang Jiayu and began to chat.

Huang Xiyin was a *Jinshi* graduate who had served as Magistrate of Nanhai. His learning and worldly experience far exceeded that of Zhang Jiayu, who came from humble origins, and Zhang Jiayu found their conversation immensely enriching. Huang Xiyin's grandfather, Huang Fengxiang, had placed second in the *Jinshi* examinations during the Wuxu year of the Longqing reign—an Emperor-appointed *Bangyan*—and had risen to become Minister of Rites, posthumously titled Wenjian. Beginning with Huang Fengxiang, the Huang clan had produced eight *Jinshi* across four generations and ten *Juren*, establishing themselves as one of Quanzhou's most prominent families. History recorded that Huang Xiyin would eventually surrender to the Manchus and, as Zheng Zhilong's fellow provincial, would even persuade Zheng Zhilong to defect. Consequently, Zhang Xiao was unsurprised by Huang's current turncoat status and treated him with noticeably less warmth than he showed other surrendered officials in Guangzhou.

Yang Tinglin, Zhang Pu, Chen Yutai, Wu Weiye, Mai Erxuan, and Chen Shiji had all passed the *Jinshi* examinations in Huang Xiyin's year. Yang Tinglin and Zhang Pu hardly needed introduction; Chen Yutai was the *Zhuangyuan* of their cohort and related by marriage to Zhou Yanru; Wu Weiye, a fellow provincial of Zhang Pu's, was celebrated as one of the "Three Masters of Jiangzuo" alongside Qian Qianyi and Gong Dingzi; Mai Erxuan had joined Chen Zizhuang's anti-Qing resistance; and Chen Shiji hailed from Wenchang in Hainan—currently in mourning, he had missed his chance to flee beyond the Senate's territory and had since sealed his doors. Huang Xiyin's connections within Ming officialdom ran no shallower than those of Chen Zizhuang or He Wuzou. He would certainly prove invaluable as the Senate continued its northward expansion.

Before arriving at the yamen, Huang Xiyin had heard that Zhang Jiayu possessed skin like congealed jade and exceptional beauty. He had assumed the young man was merely an ornamental pillow—possibly a new male favorite kept by Zhang Xiao. But observing him studying with such focused intensity, then conversing and discovering his broad-minded outlook and considerable gallantry, Huang Xiyin concluded that Zhang Xiao had a sharp eye for talent. To recruit such a promising individual for the Senate after a single meeting suggested that the Senate's decision to station Chief Zhang specifically in Nanhai had indeed been carefully calculated.

"Chief Zhang, I wonder what you intend to do with Kuang Lu?" Liu Dalin asked, having finished his report on the gathering.

"Old Liu, you know the Senate's system. We rule by law. Without hard evidence, we cannot convict—how can we condemn someone based merely on their writings?" The memory of Qianlong's literary inquisitions had instilled in Zhang Xiao, along with many other Senators, a deep aversion to guilt by association and charges based on interpretation.

"The Great Song is truly different—setting a precedent for generations, truly the sign of a benevolent ruler." Hearing this, Liu Dalin felt genuine relief, knowing how many lives would be spared a bloodbath.

"However," Zhang Xiao added, "while we don't wrong the innocent, we won't let the guilty escape either."

Liu Dalin nodded. "The He, Yao, and Zhao families should be cooperative now. Only the Chen Zizhuang brothers still require more work."

"If you still cherish that old classmate friendship and wish to continue the ideological work, I won't stop you," Zhang Xiao said. "But if Chen Zizhuang remains—like a tortoise swallowing an iron weight—stubbornly determined to oppose the Senate, then even a Great Luo Immortal couldn't save him..." He sighed. Truth be told, many in the Senate harbored admiration for these loyal and righteous men of Lingnan. He didn't want this to end in a river of blood.

Out in the main hall, Huang Xiyin and Zhang Jiayu continued their idle conversation. Some time later, Liu Sixian wheeled Liu Dalin out of the county magistrate's office. Only then did Huang Xiyin knock on the half-open door, materials in hand.

"Come in." Zhang Xiao looked up. "Ah, Councilor Huang. Please, sit. How are your injuries?"

Huang Xiyin walked directly to the desk. "Thank you for your concern, Chief. They're merely flesh wounds—nothing serious." He placed the documents before Zhang Xiao. "This is the evidence of Kuang Lu's crimes, which I have collected. This villain is utterly arrogant and harbors malicious intentions. He must be severely punished."

"Oh? Let me see what you have." Zhang Xiao grew curious, wondering what incriminating materials Huang Xiyin had managed to dig up on Kuang Lu.

Huang Xiyin turned a page and pointed to the text. "These are all seditious poems written by that fellow Kuang Lu. Chief, please examine this one."

Zhang Xiao took the manuscript and read:

*Guilin Clan Marquis Banquet Collection*

*Cassia spirit intoxicates the fragrant night, heartstrings stirred by beauty's sight.*
*The Jade Dragon's tricks have reached their end; the Golden Goose hints of lingering spring.*
*Cursive script flies like trailing ribbons; the Flower Lord passes light as silk.*
*Why at this season of farewells, must guests depart yet the Kun remain?*

"This poem points at the mulberry to curse the locust tree," Huang Xiyin declared. "He claims he wishes to send off guests but cannot expel the Senate's cadres. His reactionary heart leaps from the page—Sima Zhao's intentions are plain for all to see!"

Zhang Xiao flipped through the other poems and found himself rather bemused. Though his classical Chinese couldn't match professionals like Zhang Haogu or Yu E'shui, he had graduated from Jiuyanqiao University and spent time in the Grand Library—he could make sense of perhaps seventy or eighty percent. The problem was that these so-called "seditious poems" were laden with obscure allusions and archaic characters. Zhang Xiao recognized that many words likely referenced classical sources, but his knowledge simply wasn't sufficient to identify them.

He had just told Liu Dalin that he would not conduct literary inquisitions, but he couldn't throw cold water directly on Huang Xiyin's efforts—what if the man actually uncovered something substantial? So he said, "Not bad. Councilor Huang, you are meticulous and capable to have collected so much evidence in just a few days. However, our Great Song is founded upon law, and this evidence is not yet sufficient for conviction. With your sincere dedication, I trust you can gather more concrete proof of his crimes. When the time comes, we shall catch them all in one net."

Huang Xiyin couldn't tell whether Zhang Xiao spoke in earnest or in mockery. "This is still not enough to convict?"

Zhang Xiao smiled slightly. "Judge by deeds, not by thoughts."

"I understand," Huang Xiyin replied.

Just as Huang Xiyin entered the office to speak with Zhang Xiao, two women arrived at the county yamen. The leader wore a female cadre's uniform; her appearance was proper and gentle, looking perhaps in her twenties by Ming standards. Following behind was a girl of fifteen or sixteen.

The girl's eyes sparkled with spirit. She stood five *chi* tall—noticeably taller than most women. Her long, straight black hair contrasted sharply with the shoulder-length cuts favored by the Senate's female students and cadres, making her conspicuous. Even a simple cadre uniform could not conceal her striking figure.

Zhang Jiayu heard footsteps and looked up to see who had arrived. What met his eyes made his breath catch: *Two cheeks like blooming peaches reflected in a mirror; a gaze like spring water, piercingly clear.* Her eyes were rippling pools; her brows, gathering mountains. Ask the passerby where she is going—to where the brows and eyes overflow with meaning.

The leading woman was about to proceed directly to the magistrate's office when Zhang Jiayu recovered himself and stood. "Chief Zhang is in conference with someone. Please wait a moment."
