# Chapter 2474: The Client's Peculiarity

"If she doesn't come this time, the schedule will be pushed to half a month later..."

"Anyway, the Qu family has plenty of money, and Master Qu dotes on her. We're happy to earn a bit more in storage fees."

"Forget it, let's look at the customers for the afternoon." He Xiaoyue picked up her enamel tea mug, drank a few mouthfuls, and flipped through the registration book. Suddenly, she sighed.

"What's wrong?"

"Old Madame Gao is coming this afternoon."

"Oh my mother," Guo Xi'er pursed her lips and involuntarily blurted out a piece of slang.

This Old Madame Gao was none other than the "prospective mother-in-law" of the current Chairman of the Senate, Wang Luobin. The reason for saying "prospective" was that Chairman Wang had not registered his marriage with Gao Lugie to this day. However, he had not touched a second or third Life Secretary either. So Gao Lugie was actually "Mrs. Wang" without a formal title.

Apart from Wang Luobin's status, Gao Lugie was also the first Life Secretary of a Senator. She had both status and seniority. Consequently, Gao Lugie's mother also became majestic along with her. Her reputation among the Life Secretaries was very poor.

Old Madame Gao was one of the customers the employees of Wanzi Pavilion least wanted to see. She was known for her many demands and bad attitude, and she would bring up "My Luobin" this and "My Luobin" that at the drop of a hat. Guo Xi'er had complained to He Xiaoyue more than once: "Chairman Wang hasn't even married your daughter!" But He Xiaoyue always laughed off such words and dared not join in.

"What did she order?" He Xiaoyue asked.

"Hehe," Guo Xi'er laughed a few times. "See for yourself. It's simply a First Rank Mandated Lady of the Ming Kingdom..."

He Xiaoyue took the ledger. It turned out she had ordered a formal outfit for a woman of a wealthy Ming family: a jacket and skirt, and a round-collar shirt with symmetrical lapels. There was nothing special about the style, nothing more than the use of stereoscopic cutting, but the materials used were extremely luxurious and exquisite.

"Is this for her to wear?" She couldn't act unbelieving, because this type of Hanfu formal wear was rarely ordered by naturalized citizens, let alone the "person by the side" of a Senator.

"This... this is too exaggerated." He Xiaoyue exclaimed.

"You don't know, right? Last month she ordered a set for Sister Gao too, a bright red Zhang velvet horse-face skirt embroidered with gold! Tsk tsk, haven't even bowed in the hall yet, and she wants to wear a red skirt already!"

He Xiaoyue didn't dare to respond, just making clicking sounds of amazement.

"The clothes have been altered seven or eight times, and she's still not satisfied. Sigh," Guo Xi'er sighed. "She is now one of the most difficult customers in our shop. I get a headache just thinking about it."

As they were speaking, the door was knocked on again. He Xiaoyue thought it was Zhou Suniang and had just let out a breath when Wu Xinsheng came in carrying a galvanized iron bucket and cleaning tools.

Seeing He Xiaoyue and Guo Xi'er still there, he was stunned: "Ah? Not finished yet?"

"Sigh, there is still one customer who hasn't come."

"If she hasn't come, she hasn't come; it's her own loss."

"That's true. But it's not good after all." He Xiaoyue sighed.

"Then I'll come back later to clean," Wu Xinsheng said.

"Since you're here, just clean first. It's inconvenient for you to carry tools around. I don't think she's coming..."

"Let's take turns eating first." He Xiaoyue had eaten breakfast early, and her stomach had been hungry for a while. The employees of Wanzi Pavilion all solved their lunch problems at nearby catering shops.

"No need, no need, my treat." Guo Xi'er was very generous. Disregarding He Xiaoyue's attitude, she took out her wallet from her pocket, pulled out a banknote, and said to Wu Xinsheng, "Master Wu, please go to that 'Old Friend Rice Noodle Shop' on the corner and buy us two bowls of rice noodles."

"Alright, same as usual: medium portion, add egg, no spicy, no coriander."

"You remember so clearly. Keep the change."

Wu Xinsheng took the banknote, packed up his cleaning tools, and walked out. Not long after he went out, a female shop assistant knocked on the door and said: Zhou Suniang is here.

"We're coming right now." Both He and Guo were invigorated; the most important customer of the day had finally arrived.

For major clients, they had to go out to greet them personally. This was a rule set by the General Manager of Wanzi Pavilion starting from No. 82.

They walked out of the VIP reception room and just arrived at the corridor when they saw the shop assistant already leading Zhou Suniang over with a face full of smiles. Behind her, as usual, followed three or four servants.

Zhou Suniang frowned slightly, looking preoccupied. She had almost no reaction to the "warm welcome" of the two.

Both were somewhat surprised. Although this Young Lady Zhou usually appeared depressed and unhappy, her social courtesies were watertight. She had never been so distracted like this.

The VIP viewing room was specially furnished with a full set of exquisite chairs and tea sets. As soon as Zhou Suniang sat down, a female shop assistant served a hot towel.

"Ms. Zhou..." He Xiaoyue spoke. To cater to various customer groups, Wanzi Pavilion used "Ms." for all married female customers. This was not only to express respect but also to avoid mentioning the distinction between primary wives and concubines in wealthy families, so as not to affect their mood. In specific applications, certain situational rules had to be followed. After learning this, He Xiaoyue realized that the Australians were no less sophisticated than the Great Ming when it came to these things, and even had a feeling of the student surpassing the master.

"Hmm?" Zhou Suniang responded absent-mindedly.

"This is Pre-Qingming tea from this spring, shipped from Hangzhou by clipper." He Xiaoyue personally brought the tea cup delivered by the assistant to the tea table beside her. "It's brewed with spring water. Please taste it."

Zhou Suniang was quite particular about tea tasting and sometimes would chat with them about tea matters when she was in the mood, but today she didn't even touch the cup, only saying: "Thank you." Her eyes, however, glanced at the door from time to time.

He Xiaoyue glanced at the two maids accompanying her at the door—there was nothing unusual. What was she looking at?

Guo Xi'er was also full of puzzlement, but since the person was here, the goods had to be delivered. She immediately walked to the display rack, pulled up the bamboo curtain that had been lowered to create an effect, and began to explain. Occasionally she glanced at Zhou Suniang, only to see her staring blankly at the dress as if she wasn't listening to her speech seriously.

what was wrong? Guo Xi'er was surprised inside. This dress had attracted Zhou Suniang's attention since the concept drawing came out. Now that the finished garment was out, the effect was even better than the drawing. Why did she have no spirit at all?

Disappointed, Guo Xi'er couldn't help but feel a bit discouraged. Suddenly, a voice came from the door: "Miss Guo, Miss He, the rice noodles are here..."

As he spoke, Wu Xinsheng was seen coming in grinning, carrying a rattan food box. As soon as he showed his face at the door, he realized that there were guests inside, and quickly said: "Sorry, sorry, excuse me, I'll bring it later." After saying that, he retreated.

In that instant, He Xiaoyue saw Zhou Suniang's eyes light up instantly. She was startled and quickly blinked to look again, but it was just like before.

Did I see it wrong? He Xiaoyue was full of suspicion.

"Ms. Zhou, please try on the clothes." Guo Xi'er hastily ended the explanation and entered the fitting session.

According to the haute couture process, this was not her first fitting. After each fitting, the garment pieces had to be disassembled according to the situation and modified based on the results. Today was the sixth time. Because the fifth fitting was very satisfactory, this was the final fitting. If there were no accidents, it would be delivered.

"Good." Zhou Suniang stood up. Her expression suddenly changed a little, not as absent-minded as before, and her eyes had spirit.

Zhou Suniang walked into the changing room, and the two maids followed her in. He Xiaoyue quickly lowered the bamboo curtain—although they were all women, the female family members of wealthy households were guarded very strictly. Changing clothes was done with the help of maids and servants. Not only could they not help, but they couldn't even look.

Only during measurements were they allowed to come into close contact with the bodies of female family members and see them in their undergarments. This was already the biggest concession wealthy families made when making clothes at Wanzi Pavilion.

Guo Xi'er and He Xiaoyue waited outside. After a good while, Zhou Suniang, who had changed clothes, came out. A beauty matched with gorgeous clothes was indeed extraordinary. The two praised her repeatedly and invited her to the full-length mirror.

"This outfit fits perfectly!" He Xiaoyue said sincerely. "Fluttering like an immortal."

Zhou Suniang looked at herself in the mirror, her eyes complex, with joy, adoration, and a slight regret. She nodded silently: "This dress is good. Bring the bill."

Saying "bring the bill" meant acceptance was passed. With the bill, Wanzi Pavilion could settle the payment with the Qu family's accounts office.

He Xiaoyue was happy in her heart: The commission for this order is in hand again! She quickly promoted again:

"There are also matching shoes and accessories..."

"List them all. I've bought clothes worth over a hundred; do I care about this little money?" Zhou Suniang said lightly.

Now Guo Xi'er couldn't understand. Young Lady Zhou wasn't such a lavish spender in the past? In the past, when she came to make clothes, it was mostly because the Master indicated his favor, and she wasn't that interested herself. So she never made any special requests and didn't buy extra accessories. She could be said to be a very frugal person.

Unable to understand, selling more goods was always a good thing. She thanked her repeatedly and said a few complimentary words.

After changing back into her clothes, Zhou Suniang suddenly spoke: "I also want to order two sets of lingerie. I wonder what styles you have here?"

He Xiaoyue was stunned and quickly said: "We do, we do. I'll get the designs right now." But inside she was extremely surprised. What was wrong today? Did the sun rise from the west?

The lingerie sold by Wanzi Pavilion was quite famous in Lingao. Compared to various Hanfu, Han-element, Lolita, or other similar fashions, these private models had no taboos and were avant-garde and bold. However, because the materials were picky and the cutting was difficult, the prices were also very high. Yet, the acceptance in the company's main high-end market was very high. This was also the strangest thing He Xiaoyue found after coming to Wanzi Pavilion. Old misers would chatter endlessly and be extremely picky about the hem of their wives' and concubines' skirts and the length of their sleeves, but the more revealing lingerie sold like hotcakes.

Guo Xi'er immediately left the viewing room to get two thick albums from the side and invited Zhou Suniang to choose.
