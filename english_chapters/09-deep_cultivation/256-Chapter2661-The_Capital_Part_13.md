# Chapter 2661: The Capital (Part 13)

Liao Sanniang stopped asking questions. She slapped Wang Shizhen rhythmically. Liao Sanniang's hand was extremely hard, harder than the shoe soles used specifically for face-slapping in the yamen. Every slap made Wang Shizhen's face swell another layer. The crisp sound of skin and flesh contact made one feel cold all over. Manager Xiao broke out in goosebumps and trembled ceaselessly.

At this time, the porter keeping watch outside the door came in again and said to Liao Sanniang, "Sanniangzi, Steward Zhang has been found. He didn't come to work yesterday and had originally escaped. Not sure what he was thinking, but he returned home today to find his children and was caught by us. He will arrive shortly."

Liao Sanniang stopped her hand, pulled out a Dutch linen handkerchief from her bosom, elegantly wiped the bloodstains from her hand, nodded slightly, and said, "When the person arrives, bring him in to confront Wang Shizhen."

The porter bowed and walked out quickly.

Wu Kaidi and the others sitting aside all sucked in a breath of cold air seeing Liao Sanniang's style.

Wu Kaidi shook his head and said, "Everyone says Sanniangzi's plumes are made of gold. Today I know this statement is greatly mistaken."

Liao Sanniang turned her face to look at Wu Kaidi and made a slight "Oh?" sound of inquiry with her raspy voice.

Wu Kaidi smiled bitterly and said, "Sanniangzi's wings are made of knives."

Hearing this, Liao Sanniang covered the corner of her mouth with her handkerchief and giggled, laughing until her body trembled. After laughing for a moment, Liao Sanniang slightly supported the double sabers at her waist with her left hand and whispered, "My knives, no one has seen them."

Steward Zhang was escorted up. He was a fat man, which was simply a miracle in this Little Ice Age where hunger and cold were everywhere.

Little Bazi kicked Steward Zhang and reported to Liao Sanniang, "Sanniangzi, this filthy rascal knew he couldn't escape and couldn't bear to leave his family, so he was blocked by us."

At this moment, Steward Zhang was panting violently, as if he had just run five thousand meters. Sweat soaked through several layers of his clothes, and the fat on his face twitched continuously. He trembled with both hands, holding up a written confession high, and hissed, "Wang Shizhen, this old pimp, used a prostitute as bait to lure this lowly one into trouble. This lowly one shouldn't have been blinded in both eyes and fell for this bastard's beauty trap. But this lowly one absolutely dares not betray Delong. I was really too afraid, hesitant and not knowing what to do, confused for a moment, so I fled outside for half a day."

Liao Sanniang asked softly, "Then why did Steward Zhang come back?"

Hearing the question, Steward Zhang shook even more severely, his upper and lower teeth chattering. With a crying tone, he trembled and said, "This lowly one later thought it through. Although Sanniangzi has only been handling affairs in the capital for a year, who among the thirty-six wards of the capital walking the *Jianghu* roads doesn't know Sanniangzi has means to reach the clouds? No matter how fast my legs are, they can't be faster than Sanniangzi's knife. Running around outside is not as good as coming back. Although I caused a great disaster, it was an unintentional mistake. I beg the Chief Escort and Sanniangzi to perceive clearly. This lowly one has written a confession to turn myself in. I will bear the thousand sins myself, only begging not to implicate my old mother, wife, and children." After speaking, touching his sad spot, he couldn't help prostrating on the ground and crying bitterly.

Hearing that her fame was quite significant, the corners of Liao Sanniang's mouth pulled up, inevitably feeling a little proud. But turning her face to see Steward Zhang, who whored and visited prostitutes yet put on an appearance of being framed and wronged, she couldn't help feeling a wave of nausea in her heart.

Little Bazi leaned over and whispered, "Sanniangzi! Don't listen to his tragic story. He only wrote the confession after being caught by us. If we hadn't detained his family members, he wouldn't have written it!"

Liao Sanniang walked slowly to Steward Zhang's side, took the confession, and glanced at it. Seeing the bloodstains on the signature at the bottom, knowing it was a blood letter written by biting a finger, she gently patted Steward Zhang's shoulder and said, "The bandits designed this with such deliberation; even if this beauty trap didn't work, they would have used other methods. Steward Zhang, although your crime is unforgivable, your circumstances are pitiable. The brothel is a pit that traps people. For a prostitute, ruining your own future—why bother? However, you know to care for your old mother, wife, and children, counting as having a little conscience. I appreciate this bit of filial piety. If you can establish merit to atone for your crimes, I will exonerate you. For now, go confront that Wang Shizhen to verify the truth. How you will be dealt with depends entirely on how you conduct yourself. Look out for yourself."

After speaking, Liao Sanniang no longer looked at Steward Zhang or Wang Shizhen, but turned back to glance at Little Bazi and asked, "Has that prostitute been caught?"

Little Bazi shook his head and said, "We didn't get her."

Li Rufeng said, "Nine out of ten she has already been silenced." After speaking, he said to Wang and Zhang, "Don't feel that being caught is bad luck. If you hadn't been caught, you would probably have been silenced by someone by now! Daring to move against Master Leng's people in the capital—are they benevolent types?"

Liao Sanniang frowned and instructed in a low voice, "Currently, there are many matters here, and we can't attend to them for now. Take the two of them down. Don't lock them in the same place; interrogate them separately. Do not listen to that Steward Zhang's one-sided story. Pry open their lips. Come report to me immediately after we disperse here."

Little Bazi nodded, spoke no more, bowed as a salute, and took Manager Liu [Text says Liu, implying typo for Zhang or another person, but context is Zhang. Wait, text says "Liu Guanshi" (Manager Liu) here? Ah, previous text says "Zhang Guanshi". I will assume typo in source and use Zhang] and Wang Shizhen down with a few fellows.

Although the specific details were not yet known, combining the captured Steward Zhang and the letters, Sanniang already had a rough idea in her heart. She asked someone to take out a large-scale map outside Xizhimen and spread it on the table to study.

The Wild Tea House at Caoqiao was considered a relatively famous place outside Xizhimen in the capital, right by the official road to Haidian, less than three kilometers from Xizhimen. This place had some scenery of river ponds and flowers and trees, a place outside the city where one could rest and enjoy the view. Usually, there were many passing travelers and tourists. Arranging the meeting here probably meant to eliminate Leng Ningyun's wariness.

"They struck halfway; Master Leng didn't anticipate this." Li Rufeng said, "There are many people in the Wild Tea House on ordinary days. The owner of the tea house is the nearby Tithing Head, and many government runners gather there too."

"But according to the confession brought by Head Constable Qi, the person named Jiang who discovered the scene said the attack happened at dusk." Sanniangzi frowned. "On Master Leng's schedule, it was noon that day."

For a moment, no one knew the specific tricks in this. They vaguely felt that this opponent attacking Master Leng was not the bandit or robber they were familiar with. But no one could say clearly what was "wrong."

Wu Kaidi rested his chin on his hand and sighed, "I have followed Master Leng for these few years. Except for the first year when I didn't know the Master's background and felt like walking on thin ice, those later years felt smooth sailing. No matter how big the wind and waves, I felt everything was under control. Only today, I have lost my bearings somewhat..."

Liao Sanniang smiled. "Don't say you; who among us isn't? After all, losing a Senator—this is the first time. This opponent is truly formidable, not an ordinary person!"

...

Just as they were speaking, someone suddenly reported that Assistant Managers Xiao and Wei had arrived.

"Invite them in," Wu Kaidi said. Li and Liao exchanged a glance involuntarily.

The two Assistant Managers came in and roughly described their visits to clients. They said they visited seven or eight clients. Upon hearing the news, most were shocked and urged to find the person quickly. They did not propose to withdraw money.

Wu Kaidi nodded slightly, but felt somewhat strange in his heart. The people the two Assistant Managers went to see were all so-called "third type depositors." Their wealth was ostensibly deposited in Delong in the capital, but in reality, it had already arrived in Guangzhou. It was nothing more than opening a passbook in the capital for the convenience of using silver. These people knew quite a bit about the Senate, so getting such feedback was not unexpected.

Just as they were speaking, Little Bazi suddenly walked up to the hall excitedly. Seeing him, Liao Sanniang knew there was something, so she hurried forward to meet him.

Little Bazi looked left and right, cupped his hand in a trumpet shape, and whispered a few words in Liao Sanniang's ear. Liao Sanniang raised her eyebrows, and her expression changed several times in an instant, until finally showing joy. When she straightened her waist again, Liao Sanniang had changed to an attitude of having a bamboo in her chest [having a well-thought-out plan].

Liao Sanniang scanned the surroundings, smiled confidently, and said, "Masters, please be at ease. I will blow a big breath here: within a month, this matter will have an outcome."

Everyone immediately understood that Zhang [Wang] Shizhen must have talked, and important confessions had been asked. Seeing Liao Sanniang speaking with certainty, everyone's spirits were lifted.

Only Li Rufeng's eyes flickered as he glanced at Liao Sanniang.

Wu Kaidi was just about to ask, but Liao Sanniang's gaze sharpened, and she spoke first, "This matter concerns Master Leng's safety; the secret cannot be lightly leaked. The *Jianghu* key points are something you masters probably cannot interfere with. This little woman offends you here; after the matter is settled, I will naturally tell you everything."

Wu Kaidi was stunned and swallowed the question that had reached his lips.

Liao Sanniang's face was like peach blossoms as she smiled charmingly. "On the day Master Leng returns, I will drink with you masters."

The meeting dispersed. Li Rufeng faced the hall, back to Liao Sanniang. He watched the departing crowd, was silent for a while, and suddenly said, "There is no news, right? One month. If things don't work out after one month, what then?"

Liao Sanniang said leisurely, "In this Beijing City, the Political Security Bureau can't enter, and the Military Intelligence Bureau is hard to come forward. The martial family that can act openly is only Heliansheng. If Guangzhou sends people, traveling by sea and landing at Tianjin, then galloping fast basically takes half a month at the fastest. We can't afford to wait; we must sort out a clue as soon as possible. Just now I told Little Bazi to come in and report after a quarter of an hour—no matter what, just whisper a few sentences. Only when everyone sees things improving will people's hearts be steady. Although Wu Kaidi and the others have no rebellious hearts, they are of merchant and servant backgrounds, with timid and weak characters. If not given a thought to support them, I fear they will collapse. In the Australian new language, this is called... Hope?"

Li Rufeng said, "Called a Spiritual Pillar."

Liao Sanniang laughed and said, "Right, just like the golden pillar supporting the great hall." She sighed again and said, "I am calming their hearts; aren't they also calming our hearts?"

"There is also the meaning of listening to tone [testing loyalty] in it." Li Rufeng laughed twice along.

"It becomes boring if spoken too clearly."

Li Rufeng sighed, "The harder the Senate's army fights, the more stable we are. Only when the army is at the city gates can we be as stable as Mount Tai."

Liao Sanniang said, "It's just that in the current situation, fighting and stopping, it has become a limbo state, with the most variables."
