# Chapter 2492: Burning the Building (Part 5)

The door to the conference room of the Guangzhou Political Security Bureau was pushed open violently. Following the appearance of two guards, Zhao Manxiong strode in. His dark, chubby face was covered with dark clouds. The people sitting around the U-shaped conference table in the room stood up one after another when they saw him enter, saluting him silently with their eyes. Zhao Manxiong walked to the center of the conference table and stood still. Shrugging his shoulders, the trench coat draped over him was shaken off. The secretary behind him lightly blocked it with a hand, caught the trench coat across the crook of the arm, and hung it silently on the coat rack by the door.

All participants stood at attention together. Because the First Deputy Director of the General Bureau was personally presiding over the meeting, all attendees wore uniforms.

Zhao Manxiong nodded slightly to the people in the room, gesturing for everyone to sit down, and began to speak: "Everyone has worked hard during this period. The work at the local level is complicated and multifarious, especially involving local clans and powerful gentry. There are many loose ends, broad implications, and difficulties in handling matters. The situation is intricate, but we can only face the difficulties head-on. Guangzhou is our starting point. We will start here, learning lessons and summarizing experiences to welcome more arduous and troublesome tasks in the future. Only with a steady footing can we climb higher. As I said, Director Wu and I will fight side by side with you."

Everyone in the Political Security Bureau knew that the First Deputy Director rarely left Lingao. His visit to Guangzhou was a first. His sudden arrival obviously raised the case at hand to an unprecedented height.

Zhao Manxiong nodded to Wu Mu, signaling the start of the meeting. Wu Mu did not rush to speak but first lowered his head to flip through two pages of the document in his hand, which caused a brief silence in the conference room.

After a while, Wu Mu looked up and said: "The anti-Song forces in Guangzhou headed by Liang Cunhou have been hiding in the dark since we seized the Guangzhou regime. Everyone has gained some understanding of the general situation from the materials distributed before. But previously, we could only get scattered information, like a broken puzzle, making it difficult to see the whole picture. Now we have made some new progress, allowing us to roughly outline the intentions of the Guangzhou anti-Song forces headed by Liang Cunhou."

Speaking of this, Wu Mu got up and went to the blackboard at the front of the conference room. He picked up a piece of chalk from the low table next to it, drew a square on the blackboard, wrote "Personnel" inside the square, and continued: "This is the first piece of the puzzle: Recruiting Personnel. On one hand, Liang Cunhou founded the Yuyuan Society to absorb scholars dissatisfied with our Australian Song regime's policies as the backbone, researching and interpreting our policies. Besides this, I believe some of these personnel should have indirectly participated in the compilation of *Record of Broad Knowledge of Heaven's Affairs*. Sometimes they also do work like writing handbills and concocting rumors. On the other hand, they look for hostile elements and their families in the countryside who have engaged in hostile acts against our Australian Song or have been suppressed by us. These people have often suffered our blows, some even repeated blows. Their thinking is stubborn, and their will to resist is determined. It is difficult to transform them. But intimidated by our power, they lurk temporarily. This part of the people comprises the backbone of the anti-Song forces Liang Cunhou is winning over. I understand there was once a Scholar Huang from Lingao who contacted Liang Cunhou to recruit so-called righteous men in the countryside for him. These people formed an anti-Song alliance with consistent goals with Liang Cunhou, but the structure of this organization is relatively loose and has not formed a unified leadership."

After speaking, Wu Mu drew another square on the blackboard and wrote "Public Opinion," piecing it together with the first square, and said: "This is the second piece of the puzzle: Manufacturing Public Opinion. Liang Cunhou and his group have been collecting our relevant open publications and can achieve limited understanding and comprehension of some of our policies. Many of our policies involve the deprivation and restriction of the rights of the old ruling class. At the same time, they use some work omissions in the initial stage of the establishment of our Guangzhou Municipal Government to spread rumors, slander, bewitch, and varying insults against our Australian Song regime. They print relevant content as handbills for secret distribution, creating dissatisfaction and opposition among the gentry class. Through aristocratic families, gentry, and clan elders, they radiate propaganda to the citizens, rural farmers, tenant farmers, and other groups they control and influence, denying the legitimacy of the Australian Song's rule, creating the image that we are rebels and a puppet regime, and propagating remarks such as we want to make a quick buck and leave, or 'a rabbit's tail won't grow long.' They spread reactionary slogans like 'People have hearts, Heaven has eyes, the Bald Thieves' national fortune won't be long,' 'Loyal hearts shine like the sun and moon, red courage forges the universe; hair-cutting ones are not our kind, rely on swords to sweep away demon winds,' and so on. They use public opinion to shake our ruling foundation at the grassroots level. Most ordinary people are uneducated and lack discernment, and it is difficult for us to fundamentally replace local forces in the countryside. Coupled with constraints on funds and manpower, propaganda work is difficult to sink down, which temporarily gives them an opportunity. Moreover, judging from the actual situation, many gentry and aristocratic families within the scope of the old Guangzhou Prefecture are more or less dissatisfied with and misunderstand our policies, carrying some hostile emotions. Most big households adopt a wait-and-see attitude. That is, they do not participate in their conspiracies, but they also remain silent about them, wanting to see how much quality we really have, and also intending to use this to increase the difficulty of our governance so as to raise the price of our future buyout."

Wu Mu paused for a moment, drew a third square on the blackboard, wrote "Intelligence," spliced it with the second square, and said: "This is the third piece: Intelligence Collection. From the information we have now, Liang Cunhou's intelligence collection has three sources in total. First is open publications, which is what we call white intelligence. Most of an intelligence agency's intelligence can be obtained from analysis of open channel data. This is especially true for the usurping Ming, which lacks confidentiality awareness. Only a small amount of intelligence needs to be obtained through covert means, which is what we call black intelligence. Of course, this is directed at us; at this stage, our enemies do not yet possess this capability. But Liang Cunhou is different. He has conducted relatively in-depth research on us and has initially realized the importance of intelligence. We underestimated the enemy's learning ability and were sometimes not rigorous enough in the review of various publications. Many relatively sensitive data and contents were written directly in various official documents and books, which provided convenience for the enemy. Second is taking advantage of the opportunity that the Guangzhou Municipal Government retained a large number of old officials and clerks to infiltrate our government departments. These people inherited the working style of the usurping Ming yamen, blabbing about everything everywhere, or selling it to the likes of Liang Cunhou to obtain rewards that sometimes amount to only a few *mao*. Liang Cunhou even can obtain handwritten copies of official documents from these people. Third is relying on grassroots gentry to understand some of our intelligence like administrative layout, military deployment, and arrival of supplies through seeing with eyes, listening with ears, and asking with mouths. And that compilation of intelligence analysis called *Record of Broad Knowledge of Heaven's Affairs* should contain both what was obtained from open channels and what he collected secretly himself. Once these materials fall into the hands of people with ulterior motives who also know us relatively well, they will play a big role. Liang Cunhou is the first enemy who faces us squarely, is willing to understand us, and is willing to learn from us."

Wu Mu then drew the fourth square and said: "The fourth puzzle piece: Armed Forces. A few days ago, through tracking, we discovered a stronghold of Liang Cunhou's so-called 'Martial Team' deployed in Guangzhou city. During the tracking process, the target changed vehicles once, doubled back twice, changed routes multiple times, and set up support personnel, possessing some counter-reconnaissance awareness. This shows they have some understanding of our reconnaissance and working methods. It is now certain that there are eight people in this stronghold. Obviously, this number is considered; too few people means insufficient strength, too many makes it difficult to manage. After monitoring this stronghold for several days, we grasped another stronghold of theirs in the city through tracking and surveillance, mainly used for emergency hiding of personnel and concealment of goods. Besides this, through a purchase they made recently, we analyzed that there is at least one camp outside the city used for the daily life, training, and activities of the remaining armed personnel, because their purchase quantity is far more than what the personnel in the stronghold can consume. But unlike what we originally thought, these people do not take orders directly from Liang Cunhou but are his allies. They possess autonomy and independence. Once leaving the Liang family, they can also exist independently. Our grasp of this part is not yet sufficient, but it is speculated that they shouldn't have many people, not exceeding one hundred; otherwise, financial resources would be difficult to support. These people usually do some wet work and collect intelligence for the Liang family. Once there is an opportunity, they will establish a 'Righteous Army' with themselves as the core backbone to organize rebellion and riot activities. These people have a certain understanding of the Australian Song regime's law enforcement methods. Once invested in anti-Song activities, the harm brought will be greater than ordinary hostile elements. They are also the key targets of our strike this time."

Pausing for a moment, Wu Mu connected the four squares with chalk and drew a large circle enclosing all four squares, saying: "This way, the general picture of the anti-Song forces headed by Liang Cunhou is relatively pieced together. Next, let's talk about the purpose of his preparations."

At this time, a participant raised his hand. Wu Mu pointed at him, and that person said: "Director Wu, why don't we act now to take out that stronghold and directly arrest Liang Cunhou?"

Wu Mu nodded and said: "This kind of armed gang becomes bandits when gathered and civilians when scattered, possessing strong mobility. Once the stronghold in the city is taken out, alerting them, the main force outside the city will very likely break into parts and hide among the people, becoming a hidden unstable factor. This is more unfavorable to us. We hope to eliminate this armed gang once and for all through a unified action, completely removing the hidden danger. In several days of surveillance, we analyzed that they should have contact with the outside of the city. Through clues provided by Section 9, surveillance targets have relatively frequent dealings with private money traffickers inside and outside the city, regularly exchanging silver taels for banknotes and silver dollars. It is speculated that this is maintenance expenses prepared for personnel outside the city. Combined with information from a while ago, this gang does not rely on the Liang family's support but has other sources of income. Therefore, behind the Liang family, there must be a bigger conspiracy. It is very likely the Shi Weng Group we have been looking for."
