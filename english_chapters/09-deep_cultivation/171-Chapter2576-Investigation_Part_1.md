# Chapter 2576 - Investigation (Part 1)

"Jingshan, how do you think this outfit looks?"

Zheng Mingjiang wore a modified hanfu produced by Shop No. 82. The fabric was elegant and refined in color, and the various accessories and small items were very much to her taste. The only thing was that the price was quite outrageous.

A few hundred yuan was nothing to an Elder, of course. But Zheng Mingjiang knew this garment was actually made by Wanzi Pavilion—just slapping on Shop No. 82's label doubled the price. But going to Wanzi Pavilion herself to buy would feel somewhat inappropriate. After all, the customers there were almost exclusively gentry and wealthy households.

Hong Huangnan really was a shrewd merchant.

"Where's the straw hat I asked for?"

"Coming!" Jingshan brought a curtained hat also from Shop No. 82—naturally, also modified. This thing was better than a straw hat. First, the hanging veil could effectively cover her face and neck. Not only did it block the sun, it could also keep away mosquitoes. Very practical when going out.

She wasn't covering herself from neck down because she was worried about passing inspection, but out of consideration for sun protection and insect prevention. After all, since coming to Lingao she had already darkened one shade—something she found hard to accept.

"Do you think I'm overdressed for Foshan?"

"Not at all, not at all," Jingshan said solemnly. "This outfit suits you perfectly."

County Magistrate Zhang! Where's your sunscreen and DEET production capacity?

The Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway had already been planned between Foshan and Guangzhou, but even the civil construction hadn't started yet, so Zheng Mingjiang had to take a boat to Foshan.

Currently, regular passenger and cargo service had officially opened between Guangzhou and Sanshui. A 621 tugboat towed "flower-tail" barges. Every morning boats departed simultaneously from both locations, arriving before nightfall. Operating this route was "Xinli Shipping," newly established just last year.

This was a purely private enterprise, with investors mainly from the Chambers of Industry and Commerce in Guangzhou, Foshan, Sanshui, and other places. Naturally, the company had to pay a great price to obtain passenger rights on this golden waterway—not only paying annual fees, but also promising to employ no fewer than fifty percent boat people's children among their total workforce.

Wang Sangou from the Municipal Government's General Affairs Section had booked her ticket. The ticket was first class. Zheng Mingjiang had long heard of Guangdong's famous "flower-tail" boats and could finally experience one firsthand.

This type of boat was originally wooden-structured. For safety, the Hong Kong Shipyard had changed to iron ribs with wooden shell when building them, strengthening the hull. "Flower-tail" boats were enormous, shaped like pleasure boats. The vessel had three stories: the upper level was the dining floor, for first class; the middle level called public cabin, for second class; the lower level and bow were cargo holds.

In the old timeline, such boats were very lavishly decorated with carved railings and painted beams, especially the stern fitted with colored light tubes that were particularly striking when lit at night—hence the name "flower-tail." This timeline's "flower-tail" boats weren't so elaborate, but the onboard facilities were still quite refined, with luxury suites featuring attached bathrooms and private cabins, and observation balconies on the roof. Quite the air of a luxury liner.

The most distinctive feature of these passenger boats was having no powered cabins—they relied entirely on the tugboat ahead for propulsion. Thus the entire vessel sailed silently, without vibration, stable and steady. The only drawback was the relatively slow towing speed. The one-way voyage to Sanshui was less than fifty kilometers, yet took nearly ten hours.

Fortunately, Zheng Mingjiang was only going to Foshan, a distance of just sixteen kilometers. Departing in the morning, she'd arrive by noon. So Wang Sangou had booked her a first-class seat compartment. No beds, but the small compartment was quiet and convenient. Outside there were also accompanying staff cabins.

---

At noon, the boat arrived at Foshan. Lin Ziqi, Secretary-General of the Foshan Development Zone, came to the dock to welcome her.

Zheng Mingjiang's purpose hadn't been disclosed in advance, because she felt this case probably had a wide scope. It might even involve certain Elders' trusted people. The life secretaries, assistants, and staff surrounding Elders also had connections among themselves, and Elders with poor security awareness could easily leak her intentions.

So her stated reason for coming to Foshan was simply "inspecting Foshan's medical and sanitary conditions and epidemic prevention status."

Lin Ziqi had originally planned to arrange for Shang Yu to accompany her inspection work, but Zheng Mingjiang flatly refused. She stated that she was mainly doing "undercover visits" in Foshan, with the primary purpose of "understanding the situation," so there was no need for a big fuss. Just having a naturalized citizen cadre familiar with local conditions accompany her would be fine—no need for an Elder to accompany.

Hearing this, Lin Ziqi couldn't figure out what medicine she was selling in her gourd, so he assigned Lin Ming, the Social Affairs Section Chief, to accompany her.

Foshan was a famous town under heaven, with myriad households, all kinds of goods gathered together. Zheng Mingjiang, coming on a business trip, would naturally also take the opportunity to play around and enjoy the atmosphere with the common people.

"Jingshan, don't just think about having fun yourself—remember to buy something for Little Guo."

"Huiwen always says I spend the Chief's money carelessly, something about 'not managing the household, not knowing how expensive firewood and rice are,' or 'every inch of silk costs a thousand lives, every spoonful of rice a hundred lashings,' things like that."

"That's just how he talks. He's still very happy when you bring things back."

Lin Ming was full of suspicions. This female Elder said she was inspecting medical and sanitary conditions, yet seemed completely indifferent to it, just wandering around Foshan's streets and alleys, visiting many local scenic spots and historical sites. Her shopping was completely unrestricted—she bought whatever she saw. Within two days, the guesthouse corridor was stuffed with goods delivered from various shops.

Finally, on the second day, Elder Zheng announced she wanted to visit all the local pharmacies and medical shops.

"I'm making private undercover visits. You don't need to make a big fuss. I'll go in and chat with them, take a look at the situation." Zheng Mingjiang instructed. "By the way, do you have any public medical institutions here?"

"There's an infirmary, specifically serving naturalized citizen cadres and Elders—not open to the public."

"And the medicines used?"

"Allocated from the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital," Lin Ming said. "The doctors and nurses too."

Zheng Mingjiang understood. This clinic was essentially an outpost of the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, using drugs through the same channels. There was nothing to dig up here.

"Are there many local pharmacies and medical shops?"

"Many, many." Lin Ming nodded repeatedly. Thanks to the water and land transportation hub here and developed handicraft manufacturing, the local population was large. As the hometown of Lingnan's prepared medicines, there were eleven large and medium-sized herbal medicine shops here alone, plus over fifty small pharmacies and fixed medicine stalls.

"Let's visit them all."

Zheng Mingjiang first went to Yang Runkai Hall, which had business relations with the Senate. This was currently Foshan's largest herbal medicine shop. Naturally, its ability to become the largest was inseparable from cooperation with the Senate. Yang Runkai Hall was the general agent in Guangdong for many of Runshi Hall's special-effect traditional Chinese medicines.

She knew this was a legitimate business unlikely to be connected to fraudulent Lushi Powder—why destroy commercial credibility built up over generations? Moreover, this place didn't deal in antibiotic-type drugs and wouldn't be a source of antibiotic leakage. But having stayed in Lingao for so long with very few interactions with natives, she really wanted to experience the style of a traditional large pharmacy in this timeline.

With an Elder arriving at the shop, naturally the shopkeeper and assistants were immediately alerted. Zheng Mingjiang stopped the shopkeeper who was about to go inform the owner, saying she was just looking around casually, not to disturb the shop owner. She then asked about the local Lushi Powder situation.

"This medicine is indeed on the market!" the shopkeeper said. "It's been around for over two years, just very scarce at first. It's only become more common recently."

So her speculation was correct—this business had deep roots and had been going on for more than a day or two. Otherwise there wouldn't be so many versions.

"Is it effective?"

"If you say it's useless, a fraud—that wouldn't be right either." The shopkeeper said. "Sometimes it has miraculous effects. One dose can save a life. Other times it has no effect whatsoever. As for the formulation, it's all vague, though quite a few medicines are used. It's basically one of those 'supreme drugs' concocted by itinerant quacks."

Though "itinerant quacks" was a derogatory term, historically they each had their own secret formulas and special-effect medicines, often remarkably effective for one or two particular diseases or injuries—that was their selling point.

Clearly, Yang Runkai Hall's shopkeeper and assistants had long since analyzed Lushi Powder's ingredients.

"Have you ever sold this medicine?"

"Look at what you're saying! Our proprietor does legitimate business. We have none of those things itinerant quacks use to cheat people. Never mind that such money is earned with a guilty conscience—people are coming to treat illnesses. If you can't treat it, just say you can't. Why would you sell fake medicine and delay them? Doing such unconscionable things too often brings retribution." The shopkeeper's leisurely yet morally-grounded speech fully displayed his professional character.

"Your esteemed establishment is indeed an honest old shop." Zheng Mingjiang felt her judgment should be correct—this wasn't the source of Lushi Powder.

Before leaving, she bought some clove, mugwort, angelica, perilla leaf, mint, calamus, agastache, and honeysuckle, having the assistant grind them into powder for sachets to repel insects—to give as gifts later.

Her second stop was Chen Liji's Foshan branch. Like Yang Runkai Hall, the shopkeeper knew about Lushi Powder but didn't sell it themselves. They also clearly told Zheng Mingjiang that Lushi Powder indeed had some effect.

"Since it's effective, why don't you sell it?" Zheng Mingjiang was quite puzzled. Chen Liji was different from Yang Runkai Hall—Chen Liji had specialized in prepared medicine business from the start, so besides various self-produced traditional medicines on the counter, they also sold prepared medicines from various other pharmacies, even medicines from as far as the Northern and Southern Capitals and Nanzhili.

"Though this medicine is effective, its origin is unknown. Our humble shop doesn't dare sell it, fearing it would damage our reputation!"

She then visited other large and medium-sized pharmacies. The shopkeepers and assistants said much the same thing. Zheng Mingjiang knew there was nothing to squeeze out here, so she shifted her investigation focus to small pharmacies and fixed medicine stalls.

Unexpectedly, the very first one yielded results. These small pharmacies sold Lushi Powder and other miracle drugs if not brazenly, then at least without any hesitation. Besides Lushi Powder, there were all sorts of strangely-named things, even "fetus-changing pills"—a medicine whose existence was absolutely inconceivable to Zheng Mingjiang.
