# Chapter 2709: The Capital (Part 61)

Hot iron sand sprayed into the big man's eyes, nose, and mouth. The sturdy man let out a miserable scream, dropped his spear, covered his face with his hands, yet still managed to support his body and retreat backward.

Having succeeded in the surprise attack, Zhao Liangjian leaped forward quickly, chasing and striking. He swung the steel whip with all his might, smashing it straight into the man's face.

With a muffled *crack*, the steel whip struck the sturdy man squarely on the frontal bone. Under the heavy blow, the forehead visibly caved in. The severe concussion caused by the impact instantly deprived the big man of all ability to think or react.

Hitting once, Zhao Liangjian did not pursue further. He shrank back, retreating into the Escort Bureau's formation.

Two guards holding rattan shields stepped forward, closing in from left and right to form a shield wall, protecting Zhao Liangjian behind them.

The sturdy man still stood woodenly in place. The dense capillaries on his head burst one after another, and streams of fresh blood instantly dyed his head into a "blood gourd."

Due to intracranial hemorrhage, two streams of black blood flowed from the man's nostrils. He reached out to wipe them, but it was in vain; more blood immediately flowed out.

Opposite him, Zhao Liangjian had already discarded the steel whip and switched to a *pudao*. He laughed loudly, "How was that? This is my unique skill, called, um, called this... called 'Facial Squirting' (*Yanshe*)."

The big man stood stiffly, coughed, and said with difficulty, "Cough, cough... filthy old dog... no... martial virtue."

After speaking, his eyes rolled back, and he fell heavily to the ground, stiff as a board.

The sudden change stunned the bandits. Martial Yama was the first to wake up. Flying into a rage out of humiliation, hopping like thunder, he roared, "All forces charge! Kill them all, leave no one alive!"

A bandit in Martial Yama's squad immediately blew a long whistle.

Martial Yama turned his head to look at the roadside, waiting for the ambushing accomplices to charge out.

Hearing the bandit's whistle, Zhao Liangjian and Liu Chang knew he was calling for the ambushers. Their hearts tightened simultaneously, and they turned their heads together to look at the woods on the right.

Amidst the whistle, a cackling pheasant suddenly flew up from the roadside woods first. Immediately following, a muffled sound came from the woods, and a puff of white smoke rose.

The echo of the whistle faded. The ambushers Martial Yama expected did not pour out, nor did the repeating gunfire from Liao Sanniang that Zhao Liangjian hoped for ring out.

Nothing. There was nothing. The scene instantly fell into an awkward and eerie brief silence.

Everyone on both sides looked at each other, bewildered, not knowing what had happened. Their hearts felt a bit creepy. Liu Chang nervously asked Zhao Liangjian, "Brother Zhao, what happened?"

Zhao Liangjian also shook his head blankly.

A moment later, everyone suddenly remembered their professions: bodyguards and robbers.

As if waking from a dream, everyone shouted at once, raised their swords and spears, and charged into a chaotic clash.

Outside the woods, Zhao Liangjian shouted. The sounds of yelling stirred up memories, instantly recalling ten years of wind, rain, and blades. Thoughts turned to Lingao, to the Escort Bureau.

On a branch in the tree opposite, a remnant leaf swayed silently and fell. Watching the leaf drift down, Liao Sanniang became somewhat entranced.

In a moment of life and death, one shouldn't be distracted. But her mind wavered, emotions like a river breaking a dike, uncontrollable.

Living in Guangzhou for seven years, Liao Sanniang went to Lingao. She saw a train for the first time, a telegraph for the first time, a post office for the first time, and a bank for the first time.

That day she knew: the road of the Escort Bureau had ended.

One freight car of a small train held as much as several escort convoys; mule teams could not compete with such capacity.

Banks offered universal deposits and withdrawals, connecting the world.

Post offices handled logistics and delivery, with outlets everywhere.

Telegraphs reached instantly, making a thousand *li* feel like face-to-face.

Liao Sanniang had keen insight. Although she couldn't fully understand everything she saw in Lingao, she was greatly shocked.

It wasn't firearms that eliminated escort bureaus; it was transportation and communication.

 The Song people paved roads with steel and sleepers. The engineering volume was like digging the Grand Canal, exhausting national strength and the people's fat—actions of Emperor Yang of Sui, acts that destroy a nation.

The Song people were miraculous. They birthed money from money, iron from iron. The more they spent, the more they earned. Stations were built one after another, becoming nodes to revitalize local areas. Silver water flowed along the railway, moistening the land. Slogans were painted on every village wall: "To get rich, build roads first."

At the Women's Federation meetings, the Song Chiefs were impassioned, faces red, spitting visible flecks of saliva as they loudly envisioned the dawn of the industrial age. They said: Iron roads have covered Lingao, and eventually, they will cover the whole country.

When the Manchus entered the pass and dynasties changed, social stability brought population growth, market expansion promoted commercial development, Shanxi merchant banks rose, and large amounts of silver circulated, establishing Shaanxi's status as a financial center in the Qing Dynasty.

Relying on merchant banks, escort bureaus originally had another two hundred years of good times.

The arrival of the Song people changed everything, accelerating the demise of escort bureaus and a host of traditional industries.

In the original history, after escort bureaus died out, some practitioners switched to running cart inns, lingering on for a few decades.

Guangdong's Qiwei was also trying hard to adapt to the new situation, restructuring into a security company and concurrently running cart agencies and chain hotels. This coincided with the cart inns of the escort bureaus in the old history, reaching the same goal by different routes, showing the powerful inertia of history.

The next twenty years would not be a change of dynasty, but a composite revolution of system replacement, technological leaps, and ideological innovation—a changing of heaven and earth.

Small workshop-style enterprises and traditional business models of feudal society would be replaced by new industry forms. Many old industries represented by escort bureaus would become victims of this earth-shaking revolution. After a brief existence, they would turn into a grain of sand sinking in the sea of history.

Zhao Liangjian shouted the road in plain language.

Escort masters could compete in martial arts with Greenwood strongmen and speak cant with robbers.

The Escort Bureau's words worked because there were blades backing them up.

The Escort Bureau was a business of people. Reputation was the foundation of standing. Fame was earned by skill; what they sold was martial art.

If a镖 was robbed or lost, it had to be recovered with real swords and spears. If one family was robbed, the Escort League would share the hatred and fight until death.

Once the name rang loud, people recognized it, and there was human sentiment (*renqing*). This was sedimentation.

Arriving at a place, escort masters had to "pay respects to the mountain," sending greeting cards and gifts to local powerhouses to show respect—a strong dragon does not suppress a local snake.

The gifts didn't need to be heavy—a few boxes of pastries, a few bottles of Song wine. When leaving, showing off a unique skill would draw praise from everyone, saying the reputation was not empty. This was the warrior's glory.

From then on, escorts and bandits had a connection. The next meeting, they were friends.

The robbers sitting in the fortress, the powerhouses sitting on the land—they were friends. Friends were water; the Escort Bureau was fish. Without water, the fish would die.

Whether thieves or escorts, when speaking trade jargon, outsiders were confused. This gave the speaker the satisfaction of being an insider. In the Jianghu, a professional pride and arrogance unconsciously arose.

Chaotic times were different. Everything was replaced at a fast pace. Arguments changed on the city wall. Today's King might be the severed head ordering from a pole tip tomorrow.

Chaotic times could not sediment. Everyone was flying sand wrapped in a hurricane. The warrior's vain name was blown away like mist; no one remembered.

Shouting the镖 (calling out the escort) was for insiders to hear. In chaotic times, there were only armies, rebels, and refugees—no insiders. Shouting the dart could only use plain language. Without blades behind the words, no one listened.

Roving bandits were locusts. They would gnaw escort masters and merchant caravans into skeletons—not a metaphor, but real skeletons with blood and tendons.

Roving bandits didn't compare martial arts; they compared numbers. People surged like a tide, overwhelming the few. Thus, transport failed, escort routes were cut off, and escort bureaus closed.

Before leaving the city, Li Rufeng went to various escort bureaus to borrow men. The escort business had had no business for a long time; everyone was eager.

Head Li of Heliansheng had money and provided full meals. This was a good job. Pity he wanted too few people.

Unable to wait for the arrival of trains and telegraphs, the chaotic times had already buried the escort business first.

Seeing those down-and-out escort masters, sorrow assailed Liao Sanniang. That was the sunset of a profession. Being in the midst of it, she had a premonition that there would be no more escort bureaus in the world.

Liao Sanniang blinked, suddenly waking up. The remnant leaf opposite had just left the branch, falling only a sliver. Time had almost not flowed.

It is said that before death, a person's life condenses into an instant. She didn't believe it before, but just now, listening to Zhao Liangjian shouting the road, her thoughts became concrete, flashing back scene by scene like a movie, as if witnessing it with her own eyes.

Past and future, all in a flash of thought.

So, the legend was actually true.

Warriors are superstitious; a living person experiencing the state of death is ominous.

Liao Sanniang drew the pistol with her right hand. Her heart was as calm as a mirror, exceptionally clear. Every move of the enemy entered her eyes. At this moment, with sword and gun in hand, life and death were up to her, not asking fortune or misfortune.

Through the fish-scale-like gaps between the leaves, Zhao Liangjian could be vaguely seen facing off outside the woods.

Before the age of thirty, Zhao Liangjian had courage and strength holding a thirteen-section tiger-tail whip made of red sandalwood. Each knot had twelve ridges, hard as steel. By Lingao measure, the whip weighed three *jin* eight *liang*, extremely heavy for a whip. Any heavier, and the wrist couldn't bear it.

The thinnest metal whip weighed over ten *jin*, unusable by human strength, only for performance, not actual combat.

Zhao Liangjian had a waist injury. He stopped using the whip a year ago and switched to a *pudao*.

The Thunder Fire Whip was made of metal, weighing over ten *jin*. He relied on footwork to maneuver. When firing, he held it with both hands; when attacking, he fired close to the body, taking the enemy by surprise.

The Senate had disposable handheld spray tubes years ago with similar effects but much lighter weight. But Zhao Liangjian didn't choose them.

The Thunder Fire Whip was his memorial to past years. Using it relied on flashy tricks to blind the eye, then a sneak attack. It wasn't martial arts; it was close to a magic trick, hard to call honorable.

However, in the Jianghu, when hands move, life and death are decided. Honor cannot save a life.

In a few breaths, a gun sounded, and the winner was decided. A sharp whistle sounded outside the woods. The ten ambushers in front of her simultaneously arched their backs, preparing to rush out, all their backs facing Liao Sanniang, as if inviting her.

Liao Sanniang had plugged her ears with cotton beforehand. The gunshot was loud; hearing it directly might not ruin the ears, but it would inevitably affect hearing for a day or two. This was fatal for someone who might face danger and combat at any time.

Liao Sanniang leaned out from behind the tree, cocked the hammer of her pistol, took a step forward, leveled her right arm to aim. Her arm strength was extremely strong, allowing single-handed shooting.

*Pu-leng-leng*, a pheasant flew up from Liao Sanniang's feet without warning. The ambushing bandits were startled by the sudden movement behind them. They shivered and turned their heads to look simultaneously.

Humans become cunning with age, horses become slippery. The longer an animal lives, the stronger its ability to adapt to the environment.

Remaining still is a natural self-preservation instinct for many animals.

When hunters or weak beasts approach, old pheasants and hares won't flee immediately. They will hide and quietly observe, waiting for the predator to leave on its own.
