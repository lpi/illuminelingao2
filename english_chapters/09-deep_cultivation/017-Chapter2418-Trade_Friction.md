# Chapter 2418: Trade Friction

Chen Lin thought for a moment and said: "My Second Uncle, as the Chief also knows, is a person who doesn't stay home. As a man alone, he had no way to raise a girl."

Li Yao'er thought *your words are quite diplomatically complete.* It was clear the suspicion between this uncle and nephew ran deep.

Although this kind of contradiction was troublesome in work, on the other hand, it was also an advantage. At least they wouldn't form an alliance between themselves.

When Li Yao'er first came out to do agricultural cooperative work, what she worried most about was her native collaborators being "disunited" and "causing friction." However, after several years of practical work experience, she realized that native collaborators being united was actually a headache. Having a bit of contradiction was absolutely not a bad thing for her.

*I've also become a "scheming girl" now,* she thought.

Through these years of work facing local natives, she understood the hearts and human nature of people on this land more thoroughly and clearly.

The afternoon cooperation meeting went very smoothly. The several households Chen Lin selected were all poor clansmen of the Chen family, with family situations similar to Chen Ji's. Li Yao'er's conditions were also very generous. As the first batch of demonstration households participating in the cooperative, they would receive technical guidance from the cooperative, produce according to the cooperative's instructions, and all required production materials and living materials would be provided by the cooperative as interest-free loans. At the end of the production year, the cooperative would purchase all products at contract-agreed prices; after clearing loans, all remaining profits would belong to the demonstration households.

The condition the demonstration households had to pay was that in the future, they would serve the cooperative as technology promotion personnel.

The families of Chen Ji and the others couldn't figure out all these terms, but when they heard that production and living materials could all be supplied interest-free, they all agreed.

Farmers weren't resistant to loans, especially farming households engaged in breeding industries, who depended heavily on the turnover of loans. Now that the Senate was willing to provide interest-free loans, it was practically a pie falling from the sky for farming households.

In the past, this matter couldn't have been handled so smoothly—after all, there was the clan above managing things, and some matters couldn't be done without the clan's approval. Now Nansha was under Chen Xuan's power, and he "firmly supported" whatever the Australians did, so this matter was handled very smoothly.

Li Yao'er was in a great mood after handling the matters. On the way back, she praised Chen Lin again, saying he was "promising despite his youth." She also said since he was now staying at Chen Ji's house, he should help them more, and if there were any difficulties, he should report to her as soon as possible.

Work was started as soon as it was decided upon. Within two days, various materials for raising silkworms arrived from Guangzhou, including silkworm seeds and mulberry tree cuttings. Chen Lin followed Shen Su handling affairs, feeling dazzled—these Australians had all kinds of tricks for raising silkworms too.

He harbored a "learning" intention, naturally "not ashamed to ask those below," and Shen Su was also "teaching everything she knew," instructing him on all the key points.

Speaking of it, the Australians' silkworm raising wasn't particularly rare, but they were very thorough in controlling details. Every step had standards, relying not on experience or mysticism. Doing what when reaching what standard. And these standards were not just relying on eyes to see, noses to smell, or fingers to rub, but tested with all kinds of instruments. Whatever was measured was what it was. Just for how to ventilate the silkworm room every day, they relied on thermometers, hygrometers, anemometers... these Australian instruments providing accurate information every day to decide. Chen Lin first followed Shen Su learning how to use and observe the readings of various instruments, how to make daily inspection records...

Busy day after day like this, he was truly busy beyond measure. But Chen Lin had never felt so fulfilled. Raising silkworms and reeling silk—this was an industry he had been familiar with since childhood, but doing these things under the Australians was a completely different experience. He saw that the Australians not only had rich knowledge but also made decisive decisions. When there were difficulties, everyone sat down to discuss. His favorable impression of the Australians increased by several degrees. Originally, he had made up his mind to muddle through here for a few days, then find an opportunity to return to Guangzhou and seek out his cousin-uncle. Now that Li Yao'er valued him so much and he could learn so much, he wanted to stay here and follow this Australian woman to manage things well.

But his cousin-uncle was still anxiously waiting for news from him. After much deliberation, he decided to first write a letter to his cousin-uncle, explaining his current situation, expressing that opportunities were rare and he planned to learn well from the Australians. He temporarily couldn't work with cousin-uncle on the cotton textile industry in Nansha, but he was interested in this matter and willing to continue pursuing it. Additionally, he asked cousin-uncle to inquire whether his Third Uncle had gone to Guangzhou—Third Uncle was not a person who would be content to stay idle at his in-laws' house just eating and waiting to die. He most likely went to Guangzhou to seek friends and relatives, looking for another way out.

After finishing the letter, he still instructed Chen Qing to deliver it. He admonished him: "Be careful on the road. After delivering the letter, hurry back."

This winter in Lingao was different from previous years; the north wind brought more chill. Some even said they saw snowflakes. Whether there were snowflakes was hard to say, but frost did appear in Lingao—that was real.

The sentries of the 1st Guard Battalion, who originally wore at most a thin tweed coat in winter, had already changed into newly made British-made gray tweed greatcoats. The cylindrical sheepskin military caps made them look somewhat like soldiers from Tsarist Russia times.

The sentries were dressed so warmly, but at this moment the Dutchman who was constantly pacing at his post, waving his arms in a rage, and expressing dissatisfaction to the guard was red-faced with steam rising from his head.

Wang Kai smiled and put down the telescope in his hand, walked back from the window to the office desk, and picked up the telephone.

"Connect to the guard room." A small pause. "Almost done. Let him up."

In less than a minute, Van de Lantron, Special Trade Representative of the Dutch East India Company, arrived at Fatty Wang's door. After Fatty Wang's aide-de-camp/interpreter came in to announce him, Fatty Wang signaled for both of them to enter.

Originally, the VOC's representative stationed in Lingao was the Italian Mr. Leb Trini. However, the current situation made the Council of Batavia feel that Mr. Trini's rank was no longer sufficient to bear this mission, so they specially dispatched senior merchant De Lantron to come and negotiate.

"Esteemed Senator, I must express in the strongest possible terms the adverse effects of restricting diplomatic personnel's movements, especially when I carry a letter from the new Governor-General of Batavia, Antonio van Diemen, and some regrettable incidents have occurred between our two sides in Japanese waters. The tightening of communication channels, the simplification of ceremonies, and unnecessary malice—once these issues become normalized, they will inevitably cause shrinkage of exchanges, paralysis of management between both sides, and further extinguish the continuity of commerce, weakening the influence of both parties in the Far East..."

"Are you saying you have a letter for me?" Wang Kai interrupted De Lantron's hysteria.

"Er... yes." Mr. De Lantron stuttered for a moment, as if he had swallowed a fly. "I had hoped to read this letter in a more solemn setting."

"No, what you need is a friendlier environment. Let's talk about the two incidents that happened in Japan."

"Oh, I agree. Don't worry, we'll be very tolerant, as long as we can remain friendly on the Japan route in the future."

"I think you've misunderstood." Fatty Wang signaled De Lantron to sit down. "We haven't yet determined rights and responsibilities."

"We were on the port entry route and your ship was traveling parallel to the coast. According to the regulations we agreed upon..."

"But our ship was performing an armed patrol mission, flying the Maritime Police flag. It belonged to official vessels. You should have yielded."

"But we recognized the 'Oriental Express'—she had been to Batavia as a merchant vessel. This..."

"A vessel's status depends on its flag, not impressions. Of course, we also intend to handle this with a tolerant attitude and are not prepared to ask you for compensation."

De Lantron's expression wasn't pleasant, but from his earlier words, he didn't seem to intend to dwell too much on this matter: "Alright, I hope this doesn't affect relations between our two parties. Speaking of which, why were your vessels patrolling near Japanese ports?"

"It's because a merchant vessel closely connected to you was robbed nearby." Fatty Wang smiled wickedly. "Of course, it's also because the Japan trade route has long been our sphere of influence. Our persuasion of the locals has also made some progress. Arranging patrols is reasonable. You have no objections to this, right?"

"Of course not, of course not. We are glad to see our partner establish a stable commercial order in the East Asian region. This is good for everyone."

Mr. De Lantron chose his words carefully. "East Asian region" was to avoid the trade treaty clause of "bulk goods purchased from Great Song cannot be sold in the Greater China area"; while "commercial order" was to avoid and postpone confirming Great Song's increasingly strong control in the East Asian area.

Trade with Japan, represented by sugar and raw silk, was extremely profitable but limited in scale. Given Great Song's position and shipping capacity, there was absolutely no reason to hand it over to others. Of course, the Dutch hadn't dared to personally enter the field but had sent some Chinese agent merchants to secretly earn some precious metals. When these covert activities were small in scale, Great Song could tolerate them—after all, the Dutch having a bit more liquidity would just be spent buying goods from Great Song anyway.

But recently the situation had changed—the Dutch appetite was getting bigger and bigger. The reason was also easy to analyze. Historically, before 1641, the Dutch Asian-European trade scale was unstable, feast or famine. Even at its best, it couldn't compare to the average level of the Lingao timeline. Thanks to Great Song, their business was thriving and expanding in scale, but the capital in their hands had hardly increased compared to the old timeline. The wealthy Spanish could ship boatloads of silver to the Philippines to maintain their distant rule, but the VOC shareholders, famous for their stinginess, wouldn't do this. Their goal was silver. If a VOC Far East trade specialist suggested to his superiors to ship an entire boat of silver from the Netherlands to Batavia, he probably wouldn't live to see the next day.
