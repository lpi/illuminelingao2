# Chapter 2435: Sonia (XII)

Sonia re-inserted the just-degreased blue magpie skull back into the skin pouch and carefully adjusted it. Then she took out another box.

"This is camphor powder—a natural spice with strong anti-insect effects. The one I'm using happens to be from Taiwan," she explained. "We've already treated the bird skin with arsenic paste for preservation, but the degreased kapok also needs treatment to prevent insect damage."

Speaking, she first spread the degreased kapok flat on the operating table, sprinkled on a layer of camphor powder, then used tweezers to grip one side and roll it tight, beginning to stuff the bird skin.

"When stuffing, follow the order of head, neck, wings, chest, legs, abdomen, tail. Stuff bit by bit, making each part full—but can't overstuff either..."

She said: When stuffing, first grasp the bird's form in its natural state, stuffing according to the bird's natural form. Pay special attention to referencing the natural history illustration's form.

"If you don't have detailed form reference, it's best not to make taxidermy specimens. Otherwise, the animal you stuff will be severely distorted, completely becoming a different animal."

Then she guided while stuffing: places with more muscle tissue in the specimen can have more stuffing. Chest and abdomen should be stuffed solid; the neck gets less, but can't leave gaps. If not stuffed solid, after the specimen completely dries, there'll be sunken areas, affecting appearance.

She explained while stuffing, movements skilled and experienced. The apprentices clicked their tongues in admiration. But for Sonia, making specimens was basic work, not to mention conditions here in Lingao were much better.

After stuffing was complete, the blue magpie's form had basically been restored. She used pins to secure the openings in the bird skin together one by one.

"Don't rush to sew the opening now, because feather condition hasn't recovered yet. After the feathers are groomed, we'll observe the stuffing effect. Unsatisfactory places can be corrected. Only after complete satisfaction do we sew with needle and thread."

According to the "Australian specimen-making method" Sonia had learned, after stuffing was complete, a hair dryer should be used to blow-dry the specimen's fur, restoring its fluffy texture.

Though hair dryers seem to have no technical barriers, in the Senate's industrial system there was still some difficulty. So this thing had never been mass-produced. Specimen making skipped this procedure. Instead, there was a fully automatic baking oven that slowly dried the specimen's fur through low-temperature radiation. To prevent feathers from scorching during prolonged baking, the specimen was fixed on a turntable that was constantly rotated at low speed by hand using a handle.

This almost "Turkish doner kebab" style drying required great patience—otherwise, feathers easily scorched. Sonia handed the specimen to Dawen and Xiaowen for baking, while seizing the time to start the final steps of repairing the marlin specimen.

The marlin specimen was now basically dry. She inspected various parts of the specimen to see if there were damaged places not yet repaired, then began scraping latex at the skin's pinned joints to cover the nail heads.

"When applying latex, definitely be careful to use small amounts, repeatedly applying and then scraping. Don't put too much at once. Scrape repeatedly multiple times—avoid surface depressions from latex setting in one go. The function is like a carpenter applying putty: filling gaps, making it flush with surrounding skin."

"After latex scraping is done, we just need to quietly wait for the latex to dry and set," Sonia put down her tools. "The final work is coloring the repaired areas. This isn't work I'm good at—tomorrow Assavi will do it."

After the marlin specimen was moved away, the blue magpie specimen with dried feathers was brought back. The blue magpie specimen began its final steps: shaping and grooming.

Bird specimens' main poses are only flying and standing. But when shaping, based on the collected specimen's condition and needs, further scene-based subdivisions can be made on these two basic poses. For example, surveying, foraging, seeking mates, and other posture shaping.

Sonia decided not to do an overly complex pose—just use the simplest standing posture. She fixed the blue magpie specimen on a section of preservation-treated tree branch according to the pre-selected form, added wooden frame support, then made posture fine-tuning. Finally, she fixed everything with wire.

At last, she selected a pair of appropriately sized and colored glass fake eyes from a multi-drawer cabinet like a treasure chest and carefully installed them into the blue magpie specimen's empty eye sockets. Because the skull was stuffed inside, after inserting the fake eyes into the skull's eye sockets, the effect was very good. A lifelike blue magpie specimen was thus born. Sonia carefully groomed the specimen's feathers, still constantly collecting fallen feathers and putting them in a special kraft paper pouch.

"Although the specimen is now finished, we still need daily observation. Deformed, twisted, discolored, and feather-loss areas can be promptly corrected, painted, and have feathers glued on. After one week, the specimen will completely dry, and then we attach the label with scientific name, characteristics, and habits. Thus, the specimen is complete." Sonia examined it with considerable satisfaction. "Does everyone know how to make specimens now?"

"This is too complicated!"

"You need a pair of deft hands to do this."

"And extremely good patience!"

"I'd definitely forget many steps..."

"Teacher Suo, how can you multi-task like this?"

...

The apprentices started chattering and discussing again. Sonia didn't participate further in the apprentices' discussion. After a few perfunctory words, she hurried back to her own research room.

The watch hands were already approaching six o'clock. Just as Sonia was preparing to pack up and leave work, Dawen delivered a new memorandum.

"Sending a memorandum this late!" she grumbled, picking up the envelope.

Grumbling aside, official documents delivered to hand had to be opened and read immediately—this was what Lin Hanlong had repeatedly emphasized to her.

On the envelope seal's sealing wax was stamped a Senator's coat of arms—although Sonia couldn't possibly remember every Senator's heraldic pattern, she did know the common heraldic elements of Senator coats of arms.

Without doubt, this was a private memorandum from some Senator written to her.

Who could it be?

Sonia became curious: her reputation in the Senate was great—almost every Senator knew her, even recognized her. But her interactions with Senators weren't many, mainly several Senators from the Science Department's Remote Survey Department and a few from the industrial sector who worked on optical industry.

But the sender's name—Du Yibin—she not only didn't know, she'd never even heard of.

An unfamiliar Senator—why would he send her a memorandum? From the official document file number, this wasn't sent solely to her; it was also sent to several other Senators related to the Natural History Museum.

With curiosity, Sonia broke the sealing wax and took out the letter inside.

The letter began with a self-introduction. Honestly, Sonia didn't quite understand the meaning. To prevent her understanding from being off, she called in Ju Wenyi and had her read it aloud.

Ju Wenyi picked up the memorandum and hesitated: "Teacher Suo, this is a private memorandum."

"So what?"

"Private memoranda can only be seen by the addressee. It's not appropriate for me to look..."

"What does that matter? It's about official business anyway. Besides, my Chinese reading isn't good." Sonia didn't think much of it. "Go on, read it!"

Ju Wenyi had no choice but to start reading.

The letter began with a small passage expressing admiration for Sonia, but the grammar was confused and jumbled, and some vocabulary was also quite inappropriate. Ju Wenyi was sweating while reading—she was afraid this was a letter of romantic admiration from some Senator who didn't know better. Seeing it would surely bring her terrible luck! But then she thought again—memoranda had to leave copies at the General Office. Though called "private," it was really just "private opinion," not truly private correspondence. Her heart settled somewhat.

"What is this writing?" Sonia frowned. "He greatly admires me? Says I have beauty and knowledge combined? As beautiful as a fish sinking to the bottom, and saying I shot a wild goose? I have indeed collected wild goose specimens, but not while it was flying."

"Y-yes, that's what it means," Ju Wenyi said carefully. "The fish and wild goose are just metaphors..."

"Oh, I understand now—figurative expression." Sonia nodded. "Then?"

Ju Wenyi looked at the second paragraph and muttered to herself. Next, this Senator Du rambled on introducing himself, with large passages about how he loved natural history and had much "experience in raising and breeding animals," and "deep understanding of and strong interest in animal habits."

*If he's so interested, why not go feed pigs at the farm?* Ju Wenyi grumbled internally. She wondered if this Senator Du was trying to express he shared interests with Teacher Suo? This could be very bad...

Yet this foreign woman seemed completely oblivious. Hearing these words, her face actually showed a smile as she praised: "So he's also a gentleman who loves natural history! This is wonderful! It seems he knows more about zoology. And can raise animals—that's not simple!"

The next paragraph made Ju Wenyi breathe a sigh of relief. It turned out this Senator Du Yibin was writing a memorandum to propose establishing a "small zoo" within the Natural History Museum to "raise representative rare animals." Then he listed a lengthy list of names—all animals Ju Wenyi had never heard of. Some names sounded very strange, like "dodo bird," "elephant bird," "giant tortoise," etc. Afterward, for some reason, he wrote lengthy passages about these things' habitats and current situations. Chief Du specifically said "many animals are already in critical danger." He seemed very anxious.

Although Ju Wenyi felt this Chief Du's writing wasn't really much while reading, Teacher Suo clearly didn't mind. Especially when hearing the third paragraph's descriptions of various animals, her face revealed a mixed expression of "delight" and "curiosity." This paragraph seemed very much to her taste.
