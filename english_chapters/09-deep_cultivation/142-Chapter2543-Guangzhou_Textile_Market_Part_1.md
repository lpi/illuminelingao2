# Chapter 2543: Guangzhou Textile Market (Part 1)

Chen Lin thought to himself that this was taking things for granted. If it were families lacking labor, saving a female laborer would naturally be a good thing. The problem was that families needing a lot of labor were not many, and spinning mostly didn't occupy daytime labor time; it was mostly a nighttime sideline.

Farmers engaging in textile work was mostly done as a "sideline." Unlike professional weavers in cities who relied on it for survival and wove all day, their working hours would change with the seasons. Doing more during farming slack seasons, less or none during busy farming seasons.

If changed to modern timeline fashionable terms, this all belonged to "fragmented" time.

Chen Lin didn't express objection. Although this internship group was slightly lacking in social experience, they were the main core of technology for the textile factory at present, so it was inconvenient to defy their words to their faces.

As for collecting cotton, he would just make his own plans. Fortunately, his family had a ready-made network for collecting silkworm cocoons in various counties of Guangzhou Prefecture; he could also try to entrust them to collect cotton...

While pondering countermeasures, Chen Xiaobing came over smiling with a letter: "Your letter!"

The letter was not sent by the newly established "Great Song Post Office"; it was "Qiwei Special Delivery." This kind of special delivery was fast and secure, but the price was very expensive, mostly used between merchants for sending urgent letters and small items like deeds, contracts, and proofs.

Chen Lin took the envelope and saw a red stamp on it; the letter was from Guangzhou.

"Arrived this morning. Probably sent to you by some Senator in Guangzhou."

"I don't know any Senators in Guangzhou." Chen Lin muttered, "Should be from Master Wu."

Opening it to look, inside was an invitation and a letter.

Unfolding the invitation, it was an "Invitation to Guangzhou International Textile Market Opening Ceremony," inviting him to attend the ceremony. Unfolding the letter again, sure enough, it was written by Cousin-Uncle Wu Yijun. It turned out this invitation was sent by Senator Li Shan, who was responsible for counterpart reception when they visited Lingao.

The term "Textile Market" looked both strange and familiar. Although belonging to the scope of "New Speak," the general meaning was still understood. Adding "International" in front, presumably foreign merchants could also come to buy and sell goods?

Although he didn't quite understand the Senate's intention in opening such a market in Guangzhou, he dared not neglect the Senator's invitation in any way. Immediately packing luggage, preparing to go to Guangzhou. Because the first phase construction of the cotton textile factory was completed, the internship group also needed to go back to report, so several people traveled together as companions.

After a two-day voyage, Li Shan also arrived in Guangzhou City. He had been here at the beginning of Guangzhou's liberation, but his purpose then was to inspect the situation of the Great World—at that time he was already considering using the Great World to open a market.

But after looking at the Great World's situation, he felt the place was not quite appropriate. Because the Great World leaned more towards retail formats, while what he wanted to do was actually a "Trading Market" facing factories, wholesalers, and suppliers. Such a market not only needed convenient transportation but also required large-scale storage facilities; it couldn't be operated with just storefronts.

At that time, heaps of ruins were waiting to be rebuilt in Guangzhou; his light textile market project naturally attracted no interest. Until more than a year ago, this project passed the Guangzhou City project establishment review and started construction.

Although the light textile market belonged to the nature of "Government setting the stage, merchants singing the opera" in essence, the Senate's philosophy was to spend as little money as possible on things that could avoid spending. So the light textile market was actually mixed joint-stock. Guangzhou City Assets Company was the largest shareholder, and local wealthy merchants and gentry more or less had investments.

Once Li Shan got off the ship, he headed straight for the Great World. Lingao was not an ideal textile base. As a "Textile Person," the focus of work would gradually shift to Guangzhou in the future.

Of course, as a future metropolis, land in Guangzhou was inch-gold inch-earth; using it for production was inevitably wasteful, but doing trade had natural advantages. Taking advantage of the cheap land prices now to enclose land quickly became the primary goal of the two, Li and Zou. So Zou Biao set up an office in the Great World early on to settle his team.

Once Li Shan entered Zou Biao's office, he saw this partner looking depressed and cracked a joke:

"You don't owe me money, and I don't owe you money. Why put on a bitter melon face all day?"

Zou Biao gave a long sigh: "The air-jet spinning technology pre-research plan you mentioned was sent back by the Planning Institute again."

Li Shan went over and patted his shoulder gently, asking: "Don't be too sad. Air-jet spinning was considered relatively high-end in the old timeline too; the Planning Institute not passing it, I feel is normal."

"After hearing you talk about air-jet spinning, I went to find blueprints and technical data again and found it's not very difficult to make. You know in the old timeline our country started from principle research in 1958 and began applying it to industrial production in 1967. Overall, air-jet spinning is also the general direction."

In Lingao, although the older the technology the easier to replicate, some technologies were not "the older the more suitable for imitation." Like the Spinning Jenny and the Mule, they actually didn't suit the Lingao environment.

Air-jet spinning, also called rotor spinning, has the characteristics of high output, large package, short process, and wide spinning range under equal energy consumption: capable of spinning cotton, linen, wool, and having good spinnability for low-grade cotton and waste cotton. Obviously, it is a model of "More, Faster, Better, Cheaper" under Lingao conditions.

If spinning 20S cotton yarn, the output of air-jet spinning is 60~85kg/thousand spindle hours, 1~2 times the ring spinning output, even 3~4 times in some cases. Less flying waste outflow, low floor area occupation, and it thoroughly solved the problem of ring and traveler wear and burning during the ring spinning process. The required workers constitute 30% of ring spinning, and floor area is reduced by 25%. And the shortcomings of being only usable for medium-low count textiles and coarse yarn in the old timeline were solid advantages in Lingao. The woven cloth is fluffy, wear-resistant, and has good warmth retention. Moreover, sails are generally low count and multi-ply; the demand for sails in the foreseeable future will also be huge.

Now the Senate's cotton supply is tight, and it's all short-staple cotton of relatively poor quality. Air-jet spinning is obviously the most suitable process for the Senate's own fabric needs. It wasn't that Zou Biao couldn't replicate one; knowing that rotor spinning was invented in 1937, plus the old timeline had basically mastered this technology, Zou Biao said he had confidence to build an air-jet spinning production line usable for industrial production within three years.

"Look at you, if we had the industrial capability of 1958 now, wouldn't we sweep the whole world?" Li Shan said, "Not to mention anything else, just full electric drive—your equipment can't be installed in Guangzhou, let alone in Lingao."

"Correct, the Planning Institute also answered me like this, saying if I want a small production line as technical reserve pre-research they support it; full mass production, no door [no way]."

"That's fine then! At least they approved you to do pre-research. Can still mount a production line."

"But this production line can only be placed in Lingao."

"This is not necessarily so. Wait until you create the equipment three years later; maybe Guangzhou will have electricity too."

"Sigh..." Zou Biao sighed again.

"Alright, don't be anxious to eat into a fat person all day. We just have this little foundation; what else can we do? Use old technology for now." Li Shan said indifferently. He thought of the Nansha cotton mill, "Demonstration factory..."

"Progress is considered smooth." Zou Biao said, "Trial production happened recently; operation is stable."

"This is great!" Li Shan's spirit was greatly boosted. "Pity it can only spin! Phase II must seize time to launch."

"Launching is easy; cotton is hard to find." Zou Biao said, "Honestly speaking, I place such high hopes on this textile market also hoping to attract the source of textile raw materials here..."

"Do a Cotton Exchange!" Li Shan got excited.

"Right, not just cotton, all textile products and textile raw materials!" Don't look at Zou Biao as a mechanical engineer; he also had a strong interest in the market side. "Wool, silk, woolen cloth, silk fabric... hehe, since they already started doing bonds and stocks, we can also do futures in the future."

Li Shan however was not as optimistic as him. Among the four main textile materials, silk and wool were easiest to solve. Not only broad sources but also stable supply. The prospect of the textile market was also not bad.

For linen/hemp materials, local raw materials were not lacking, and the market was limited. Given the Senate's current technological level, high-grade worsted linen fabrics couldn't be made. So the linen cloth producible at this stage was not as comfortable as cotton cloth for wearing; linen materials were mostly taken to make sails and ropes.

The biggest problem was cotton supply. News sent back from various dispatched stations was not optimistic. Whether cotton from the north could be stably supplied had a big question mark.

Songjiang's manual cotton textile industry was developed, but a large proportion of ginned cotton needed importing from outside. Production areas were mostly Shandong, Hebei, etc. However, a developed industry meant the vested interests entrenched therein were very powerful. From raw cotton to spinning to various textile putting-out systems, all were monopolized by various families. It appeared somewhat difficult for the Senate to snatch food from their hands. Before squeezing out Songjiang cloth, it was hard to form a stable cotton source, but without a stable cotton source, it was hard to defeat Songjiang cloth. This formed a contradiction.

Local cotton in Guangdong was distributed quite widely, but rarely planted on a scale, and limited by climate, the yield was also "touching" [pitiful].

As for the few major cotton production areas abroad in the old timeline, whether USA, Egypt, or Turkey, cotton planting industries hadn't started yet in this timeline. The only one that could be called a scaled cotton planting industry was India.

Of course, there were other paths. If chemical fiber could be made, it could reduce the demand for cotton quantity, making 66% or 33% blended cotton cloth. But this was just thinking about it; various departments of the petrochemical industry were squeezing heads needing products; when it would be the light textile industry's turn was unclear. Moreover, even if chemical fiber came out, it wasn't that cotton wasn't needed; maybe demand would rise again due to market factors.

Li Shan had blown the cowhide [bragged]; obtaining stable cotton still became his biggest worry currently. After all, he bewitched others to buy machines everywhere; if there was no cotton to weave, not only himself, but the Senate's credit would also fall greatly.
