# Chapter 2764: The Capital (Part 120)

The stamp of a Dumping House was a guarantee of credit and was not to be used casually. Liu Sha's stamp was likely not from a legitimate source either.

According to the National Police's investigation, Sanjiang Mao was an old unsolved case from the Wanli era. Given Liu Sha's age, it was absolutely impossible for him to be involved in it.

"Where did this stamp come from?"

"You people really like to get to the bottom of things." Liu Sha laughed. "It couldn't have been me who did it."

"I know that." Xu Ke nodded. "But I'm still interested."

"I got this stamp from the hands of a man named Zhen Gaizhen." Liu Sha said, "You probably know this person too; a famous 'Philanthropist' in Guangzhou. As for how he got it, I am not clear either."

"Zhen Gaizhen?" This name was extremely familiar. Xu Ke struggled to recall for a good while before remembering that this person was a director of the Guangzhou Puji Hall, and also one of the actual controllers of the Puji Hall. In the Guangzhou area, he was known as a "Philanthropist."

After Liu San took office, he took over various local charitable facilities for rectification. Zhen Gaizhen's embezzlement and carving up of charity funds in the name of "doing good deeds" were also exposed. More than a year ago, he had already faced a lawsuit, and his massive family property was completely confiscated.

Originally, Xu Ke thought this person was just a "Charity Stick" (fraudulent philanthropist). It seemed this "Philanthropist" not only embezzled charity funds but might also be secretly involved in capital cases—if not him, then his elders.

"How much Zhuti Silver did this Daoist Wu refine, and where is it all?"

"Approximately fifty thousand taels. Apart from the ten thousand taels given to Gao Tianshi, the rest was handed over to the people making counterfeit currency in Guangzhou."

The Zhuti Silver given to Gao Tianshi, even if the Planning Commission didn't spot it when accepting the confiscated materials, would be discovered when transferred to the Central Reserve Bank. There was no need to worry much. But the remaining forty thousand taels had become a ticking time bomb.

According to the intelligence exchanged at the weekly internal security meetings, the Central Reserve Bank had already discovered a portion of very exquisite counterfeit currency on the market. Because they used Arsenic White Copper (Paktong) for casting, they had reached seventy percent similarity to real coins overall. Only the milled edge was fake at a glance, but after specialized aging treatments, they reached a level where they could pass off in the market.

The National Police had been trying to ascertain exactly how many fake silver coins were circulating on the market to assess the harm to the financial system. Now Liu Sha's confession solved this puzzle.

Forty thousand taels. Although Xu Ke was a layman in finance, the silver coins allocated by the Central Reserve Bank to the Guangdong Branch were only two hundred thousand yuan. If these forty thousand taels all entered circulation, it would be equivalent to instantly increasing the money supply by one-fifth!

This inflation rate would be too beautiful to look at. Xu Ke knew that after the currency reform, in order to pay for the rising military expenses, administrative costs, and infrastructure investments, the issuance of paper currency had inflated again and again. The paper currency issuance had already exceeded the original plan of one million. Adding the torment of these fake coins, the consequences would be unimaginable.

He asked, "Who is responsible for this counterfeit currency now?"

"I only know this person is named Li Fugui; I don't know anything else." Liu Sha said, "The ones making fake currency in Guangzhou are one group, the ones spending the fake currency are another group, and the ones refining the Drug Silver are yet another group."

"Good grief, you were in Guangzhou, and even you don't know?"

"Precisely." Liu Sha nodded. "This was Mr. Le's idea. Each line works on its own."

"This Mr. Zhou is not simple." Xu Ke spoke slowly. "But since Wu Zhiqi has been netted, how can they refine Drug Silver anymore?"

"He has an apprentice named Wu Hai, who was originally in the same trade as Fu Wen. He hit it off with Wu Zhiqi quite well and became his disciple. Originally, the place where Wu Zhiqi refined Drug Silver was in Guangzhou. After his incident, the silver refining place was moved to an outer county."

"Where is it?"

"How would I know?" Liu Sha smiled. "The specific location is probably only known to Li Fugui. He is the one in charge of the counterfeit currency."

"Do you know Li Fugui?"

"I've only seen him once."

"What kind of person is he?"

"A middle-aged man, dressed like an ordinary merchant, speaking in Guangzhou vernacular (Cantonese). His speech is very refined. However, he is quite familiar with the work of various crafts. Most likely his family was originally of artisan craftsman stock."

Xu Ke thought, *Since this person can speak Guangzhou vernacular, he is extremely likely to be a native of Guangzhou, or at most from the subordinate prefectures and counties.*

"If you rely solely on want to catch him, it's not like there isn't a chance..." Liu Sha said leisurely.

Xu Ke's mind was extremely fast; he immediately realized what he wanted to say and asked with a smile, "What, you want to propose conditions?"

"Just say whether you want to catch this person or not."

"It's not about whether I want to or not; I really don't have the authority to agree..."

Liu Sha interrupted him: "You haven't even heard what I have to say; how do you know you don't have the authority?"

"Then let's hear it for what it's worth."

"That daughter of mine." Liu Sha said.

"I have already agreed to this matter, only the journey is long, so probably not so fast..."

"I trust this matter." Liu Sha said, "After rescuing the mother and daughter, can the child study in Guangzhou?"

"Attend our school?" Xu Ke was greatly astonished. Leaving aside Fangcaodi in Lingao, even for the new-style schools set up in Guangzhou, forget about officials and gentry—even middle-class citizens were not very willing to enroll. Only a minority of people with vision or those harboring certain purposes would send their children to study in new-style schools.

This Liu Sha actually thought of this?

Could it be true as "later generations" said: the one who understands you best is your enemy? Could it be that this Liu Sha also realized our superiority?

Thinking of this, Xu Ke was somewhat proud. What could proclaim their side's "correctness" more than this? He thought for a moment and said: "This matter requires the Senate's approval. However, although you yourself have severe sins, the Senate never engages in implicating families. If your daughter is willing to study, presumably there will be no problem. I can agree to you on this first."

"Many thanks." Liu Sha cupped his fists. "I will ask you to worry about her affairs in the future!"

"Easy to say!" Xu Ke nodded. "Rest assured!"

"Mr. Le's activities in Guangzhou, although separated into different lines that do not see each other, have a liaison person in the middle for contact. This person has seen many people. If he can be caught, at least capturing the counterfeit currency makers will not be a problem."

"Oh? Such a crucial figure, what is his name?"

"Speaking of which, he is also an old acquaintance of yours:" Liu Sha narrowed his eyes, "Gou Xunli!"

This name could be said to be thunderous to the ears. Even Xu Ke, who had long trained himself to remain calm amidst changes, was instantly moved.

"It's him?!"

Gou Xunli and his son, ever since escaping from the Gou Family Village, had a history as long as the Senate itself. Originally thought to be just NPCs in the grand history of the Senate, they were now gradually becoming mini-BOSSes.

Although this mini-BOSS was not particularly powerful, he was extremely tenacious, never forgetting to oppose the Senate at every moment. The key point was, he was everywhere, always looming indistinctly, reminding the Senate of the past.

Among the various enemies of the Senate back then—the powerful, the cunning, the ferocious... gradually, the dead died and the fled fled. Only this Gou father and son pair; their traces could always be found from time to time.

With the passage of time, their "struggle experience" against the Senate grew richer by the day. They had become true "Expert Level" figures in the great cause of "Resisting the Australians." This made their harmfulness increase daily. Consequently, the Political Security Bureau's pursuit of Gou father and son escalated from the initial somewhat joking "thirty *wen* reward" to the highest level of one thousand yuan reward. Even Lai Xiao, whose whereabouts were completely unknown, had a reward as high as one hundred yuan. Alive they wanted the person; dead they wanted the corpse.

Hearing news of the Gou father and son, Xu Ke was naturally extremely interested. He immediately asked, "How would you know of him?"

"Speaking of which, his son Gou Chengxuan was found by me." Liu Sha recounted the details of his chance encounter with Gou Chengxuan in Guangzhou one by one.

"...Although this Gou Chengxuan has no great ability, his heart of hatred against the Australians is very intense," Liu Sha laughed. "He told many things about his time in Lingao and spoke of many affairs of the Senate, very detailed. It was precisely seeing this Gou Chengxuan that Master Wang thought of recruiting Gou Xunli."

"Oh? How did you find him?"

"Li Siya."

"So it was her!" Xu Ke was startled: they had not grasped the intelligence that there was contact between the two from start to finish.

"It seems Miss Li is also an old acquaintance of the Senate." Liu Sha keenly perceived it.

"If she falls into our hands, we will have to 'entertain' her well." Xu Ke smiled. "Where is this woman now?"

Since the liberation of Guangzhou, there had been no news of Li Siya. Originally, she would go to sea for more than half a year every year, but she would spend at least four or five months active in Macau and Guangdong. But after the "Lotus" sailed from Macau this time, there was no more news. Although her residence in Macau had guards, no one knew the owner's whereabouts. The Foreign Intelligence Bureau tried to find her whereabouts in Macau several times, all yielding nothing. Even Li Huamei, a piece she personally set up, did not know her whereabouts.

"The Senate indeed values this Ghost Girl (Western woman) very much!" Liu Sha smiled faintly. "Not long after you seized Guangzhou, Li Siya set sail and left far away. It is said she went back to the Land of the Franks (Portugal)."

"She went back to Portugal?!" Xu Ke was shocked once again.

"Since the Senate wants to 'entertain' her, how would she dare to continue staying in Macau? The Franks can't protect her safety!"

"Consider her fast to run!" Xu Ke said resentfully. Then he remembered the key matter, "What about Gou Xunli?"

"Gou Xunli has been under her protection all these years. I heard he tried to stir up quite a few things but failed. Li Siya and I can be considered old acquaintances. I found out his whereabouts just by asking her. Since she was about to leave, she handed these old people over to Master Wang."

No wonder Wang Yehao, a wandering official from outside, could build such a massive secret network locally after just three years in Guangdong; it turned out he was enjoying the fruits of others' labor.

"So the reunion of the Gou father and son is also your credit."

"I can't call it credit, but this father and son pair are indeed very useful!" From Xu Ke's tone and expression, Liu Sha knew that what the Gou father and son said about "the Australians urgently wanting to kill them" was not self-aggrandizement.
