# Chapter 2731: The Capital (Part 87)

"Heliansheng bore the heaviest burden this time, and their losses were considerable," Leng Ningyun said. "I won't mince words. The two of you should compile a complete roster of everyone who contributed, then distribute rewards according to rank. Every person on Heliansheng's roster—whether they participated or not—receives five taels of silver. Those who made direct contributions will receive additional compensation based on merit. As for your personal rewards, I'll submit a separate request to the Cadre Department."

Since both Li and Liao were registered on the Senate's cadre roster, substantial rewards fell outside his authority. However, a letter of commendation from him could bring them considerable benefits.

"Your generosity humbles us, Chief Leng," Li Rufeng said. "But we were merely fulfilling our duty. We'd be grateful if our superiors choose not to punish us."

Escort masters, by professional habit, never boasted of their accomplishments—humble to the point of self-deprecation. This only deepened Leng Ningyun's guilt. "Punish you? If anyone deserves punishment, it's me!" He let out a heavy sigh. "This all happened because I wasn't careful enough. Greedy for credit, reckless in action. Ah..."

He sighed repeatedly. Li and Liao remained silent, watching Senator Leng's self-reproach with expressions of quiet respect. When his sighs finally subsided, Liao Sanniang spoke: "The Master's concern for everyone at Heliansheng, from the lowest to the highest, is deeply appreciated. However, there were casualties during this operation..."

"People died?" Leng Ningyun's surprise was evident.

"Yes. Three killed in action, eight wounded," Liao Sanniang said. "We humbly request the Master's special consideration..."

"The wounded will receive double the highest reward tier. Those who gave their lives... give them triple."

Liao Sanniang continued, "Among the fallen was a man named Tang Ba. When we stormed the hostage room, he threw himself in front of a sword meant for the Grand Manager. Might he be granted a first-merit citation?"

"Threw himself in front of a sword?" Leng Ningyun looked confused.

Li Rufeng quickly recounted the events of that day: "...Through his desperate fighting, he managed to block that fatal blow."

"If that's true, grant him first merit," Leng Ningyun said, his voice heavy with regret. "A pity he's already gone!"

"Yes. Such was his fate," Li Rufeng said softly.

"See that the silver reaches his family. Does he have any relatives?"

"A brother, back in their hometown in the countryside," Li Rufeng replied. "Bureau rules state that when an escort dies in the line of duty, if the family wishes to continue in this trade, we take them in. Even if they can't serve as strikers, we find them some position."

"Have his brother come to the capital. The countryside is dangerous these days. With a thousand taels of silver, he couldn't hold onto it there anyway."

"Yes, we'll see to it as you say."

After settling the matter of rewards, Leng Ningyun had the two recount everything that had transpired during his absence, questioning them closely on points that concerned him.

The more he learned about the affair, the more suspicious it seemed. After a long silence, he said, "It appears this matter runs deeper than we thought."

"Indeed," Li Rufeng agreed. "Lady Sanniang and I concluded that each party had their own hidden agenda, which threw them all into disarray. This was Heaven's blessing upon our Great Song and upon the Senator."

Leng Ningyun smiled. "No need for flattery. When you return, write up a detailed report of your experiences during this period—if you can't manage it yourselves, I'll have Old Wu assist you. Be thorough. Also, send all relevant correspondence to Delong."

After dismissing the escort masters, Leng Ningyun assembled the entire Delong staff. He spoke words of encouragement and reassurance, stating that salaries would continue during the closure. Those who had contributed to related activities would also receive appropriate bonuses.

As for the two assistant managers, he refrained from criticizing their "wavering loyalties." People's positions largely depended on their interests—it wasn't surprising they had harbored such thoughts. But their future prospects at Delong would advance no further.

After the general meeting, he kept Delong's middle and senior staff behind to discuss next steps. First: how to handle the looming run on the bank. Second: how to continue operations under the current state of quasi-warfare between the factions.

Though Delong Bank in the capital was technically the Beijing branch of Delong Bank, the social environment and local staff meant its operating model remained largely traditional, with only modest modern banking modifications. These included new accounting systems and bookkeeping methods, as well as wire transfers.

These innovations plugged certain vulnerabilities in the old system while opening new business markets. Long-distance wire transfers, for instance, were something only Delong could offer; no other establishment possessed such capability. This was a key reason Delong had managed to establish itself in the capital.

But now the shifting circumstances demanded adaptation, or they might not survive here at all.

"Everyone here likely understands the situation. Our days in the capital grow more difficult by the hour." Leng Ningyun surveyed the faces assembled in the hall.

Those present, except for the chief accountant—a naturalized cadre from Lingao—were assistant managers and counter clerks he had recruited from the local money trade.

In the capital's money business, "Shanxi House" was the dominant force. From shareholders and managers down to clerks and errand boys, all hailed from Shanxi, often from the same small towns. Their internal cohesion was formidable. Most employees were unmarried men who had come to the capital for work. Outsiders could scarcely hope to gain entry.

So when Leng Ningyun arrived in the capital to open a bank, he had recruited primarily from the "Shaoxing faction" within the money trade. The Shaoxing faction was far weaker than Shanxi House, and therefore less insular.

His options had been limited when hiring these people. In earlier years, the money business had been remarkably stable, and shop assistants rarely changed employers. The only candidates available were either newly qualified apprentices recommended by the trade association, or clerks who had lost their positions for various reasons—including some dismissed for violating shop rules. When Delong first opened, the capital's established money houses had not expected them to last.

He had built this team from nothing, carved out a foothold in the capital, and secured a place among the top ten banks. The hardships and effort that entailed were known only to himself.

Closing shop and leaving would certainly be the safest course, but this team he had so painstakingly assembled, along with all his understanding of the capital's business landscape, would scatter. Rebuilding would take years.

Everyone in the hall wore apprehensive expressions. After all, Manager Leng—as both the trade and officialdom knew—had connections to the Kun. Were his backing not so formidable and his connections not so deep, never mind him—they themselves would have been imprisoned long ago.

"Though times are hard, we must still press forward. First, to honor our obligations to our customers. Second, to honor our obligations to everyone here." Leng Ningyun's gaze swept across the assembled faces. "We are all aboard the Delong ship. The ship hasn't sunk—we've simply hit rough waves. If we can weather this storm together, as long as the ship stays afloat, there's a way forward. But if you abandon ship now, in seas this turbulent, it's as good as suicide."

No one in the hall spoke, though their expressions varied. Leng Ningyun studied each face in turn, silently taking note.

Assistant Manager Xiao, whose "serious wavering" had been exposed during the recent crisis, was the first to speak: "The Grand Manager speaks true. Only by working together with united hearts can we overcome this difficulty. We've already weathered the worst of the storm. Now that the Grand Manager has returned, we have our backbone—there's nothing left to fear!"

Leng Ningyun nodded slightly. "Well said, Assistant Manager Xiao. Though we face difficulties, we're not at the end of our rope. I know what troubles everyone. First, the authorities. Second, a bank run."

He spoke with easy confidence.

"Old Wu will handle the authorities. In a few days, the seal will naturally be lifted. Once that happens, we reopen immediately. The Delong sign doesn't have 'Kun' carved into it—there's no need for excessive worry. However, there will be certain adjustments to our operations."

The first adjustment was to cease all exchange business with Liangguang—ordinary remittances to that region would no longer be offered either.

"...We'll focus our exchange business primarily on Jiangnan and Shandong. Losing some business is acceptable. Safety comes first."

Second, they would stop actively soliciting large deposits. Originally, attracting deposits had been Delong's most critical function. The capital teemed with officials and nobles who had nowhere secure to store their silver, making large-scale deposit collection convenient while providing ample cash flow for the Senate's operations in Liangguang. But now, with transportation routes severed and Delong under intense scrutiny, moving money had become extraordinarily difficult. The slightest disturbance could trigger a run, and large-scale deposits would inevitably create redemption problems.

"What if someone approaches us wanting to deposit?" someone asked.

"If they wish to deposit, we naturally follow the old rules and offer preferential interest," Leng Ningyun said. "We won't be proactive, but neither should we be timid and refuse money that comes to us willingly."

"...Third, all Delong employees with families in the capital must relocate to the dormitory compound. Many eyes are fixed on Delong right now—we fear someone might attempt to take family members hostage." Leng Ningyun paused. "Those who wish to send their families back to their hometowns may arrange for Heliansheng to provide escort."

Given the circumstances, no one raised objections.

"The next difficult matter is the bank run." Leng Ningyun sighed. "I had Mister Liu run the calculations. Not counting minor accounts, outstanding notes total approximately 330,000 taels. Our current total reserves amount to only 150,000. That leaves a gap of 180,000."

Apart from the two assistant managers, the other clerks had not known the specific figures on the balance sheet. Hearing this number, everyone drew a sharp breath.

"I'll find a way to cover this 180,000-tael gap. But the method may not succeed—the odds are about even." Leng Ningyun continued, "Even if it works, it may not fully bridge such a substantial shortfall. So I'll need everyone's help in managing the situation."

A clerk surnamed Zhou spoke up: "Since the Master has laid everything before us, we have nothing to say except that we'll do our utmost. But please tell us specifically what you need us to do."

"Mister Wu has gone to negotiate with Lord Zhong of Shuntian Prefecture. Within three to five days, the seal should be lifted. The moment it is, we reopen for business."
