# Chapter 2478: The Stolen Silver Ingot

"Besides earning dividends, these stocks can be bought and sold," Gao Chongjiu said.

"Bought and sold?" Li Ziyu was baffled. "How can this be bought and sold?"

"For example, let's say the stock is sold at a fixed price of one yuan per share."

"Yes, yes, can it be sold for two yuan?"

"Why is that impossible?" Gao Chongjiu said. "These stocks can be traded; there are specialized exchanges. When issued, it's one yuan. If many people want to buy it, it might rise to two yuan. Then you sell it to someone who wants to buy it, and you've earned one yuan..."

Li Ziyu still couldn't quite understand. Gao Chongjiu took out a crumpled pamphlet from a drawer, with a line of words printed on it: *The Great Era – Storms in the Jiaozi Shop*.

"This is an Australian novel I've been reading recently. It tells about how money is made buying and selling stocks in Australia. Although it is fiction, the various tricks inside are written in great detail. Reading it really makes one admire. The Great Song is indeed advanced. Surprisingly, there are so many tricks! If that relative of yours has some spare money, once these new Southeast Asia Development stocks go on the market, he might as well buy some to keep—even if he can't make a huge profit, he can earn some dividends. At least it's much more cost-effective than depositing it in Delong for interest."

Li Ziyu said, "Although I don't understand, I also know these are games for the rich. It's better for us common folk with small households to avoid getting involved. We might lose our entire fortune if things go wrong! Let's not talk about this; please hurry up with the matter of the house for me."

"Don't worry about this. I'll arrange it properly for you within one hundred yuan."

After Gao Chongjiu left, Li Ziyu was called to the Criminal Investigation Section Chief's office. The Section Chief told him that many counterfeit coins had appeared on the market recently.

"...Although the counterfeits are crudely made, the quantity is significant, and there is a wide variety of patterns, materials, and denominations. They are rarely seen in the city; most are used to deceive uninformed commoners in rural markets."

"Do you want me to investigate?"

"This case is being personally handled by a Senator. I am just telling you: pay more attention when you handle cases normally to see if there are related clues—that... old constable in your team..."

"Gao Chongjiu."

"Right, Gao Chongjiu. His social connections are diverse, and he is familiar with all walks of life. Ask him to pay close attention!"

"Understood!"

"Also, is there any lead on that abduction and robbery case at Great Market Street?"

"Not yet..." Li Ziyu had a dozen criminal cases on his hands, many of which were vicious crimes like murder or robbery. A case like this, robbery without loss of life, was not a priority.

"You need to prioritize this case," the Section Chief said. "The victim is an important industrialist and merchant. He just submitted a bid with others to build a large factory. It will reflect poorly if the case isn't solved..."

"Yes, I will prioritize this case! But the victim isn't in Guangzhou right now—he went to Lingao."

"Didn't you record his statement? If there's anything else you need to ask, just wait for him to return."

"Understood!" Li Ziyu immediately performed a heel-clicking nod, then withdrew.

Truth be told, Li Ziyu hadn't taken this case to heart because this type of case had a particularity. Since the criminal used the "paihua" method, they must be an insider of that trade. As long as energy was focused on this breakthrough point, there would inevitably be results.

He had instructed Gao Chongjiu and Ah Gui to check with "informants" about the situation concerning this matter a few days ago. But Ah Gui had never given him a definite report.

"This Ah Gui!" Sometimes Li Ziyu felt vexed by Ah Gui's "incompetence." Frankly speaking, Ah Gui was not material for police work, let alone criminal investigation. Yet his parents insisted Ah Gui was a "lucky person." What kind of logic was that!

Now he could only count on Gao Chongjiu—always relying on him like this wasn't a good thing. It was a pity Ah Gui couldn't be propped up at all...

It was a pity he had too few little brothers of his own. Now they all had their own careers, and it was impossible to pull them into the police station to help him...

He suddenly thought of Zhang Shizhong. This distant uncle was someone he could talk to. He seemed both bold and meticulous; he should be good material for government service. But given his age, he certainly wouldn't be willing to be a small policeman. His two sons might be options, but without deep interaction, he didn't know if they were capable. However, since they were looking for a way out, why not point a way for the two cousins and have them sign up together when the police recruit...

Just as Li Ziyu was considering future plans, Gao Chongjiu suddenly hurried back. From his expression, Li Ziyu knew he must have brought back an important clue for a certain case.

"How is it?"

"That abduction and robbery case at Great Market Street..."

"Ah!"

Gao Chongjiu was startled, wondering *what happened?* He hurriedly asked, "What's wrong?"

"The Section Chief was just asking about this. Tell me, what clues do you have?"

"No clues on the abduction angle, but there's a lead on the silver!"

"Oh?!" Li Ziyu perked up. "Tell me."

Gao Chongjiu reported that a money changer had made a transaction yesterday.

"...It was precisely a twenty-tael silver ingot with the 'Sanjiangmao' stamp! It matches what the victim described."

"Does the dealer have an impression of the person who came to exchange the money?"

"Actually, it's an acquaintance. It's Han Changle."

Han Changle was a small minion from the original Guan Di Temple gang. However, he wasn't a beggar, nor did he live in the den. He had escaped the crackdown. Subsequent checks revealed no major crimes, so he was released home after a few days of detention.

"Since coming out of the detention center, he has been making a living building scaffolds and painting walls—how much money can he earn? To suddenly produce so much silver, there must be something fishy!"

"Good, let's go find him immediately!"

Li Ziyu thought that even if this man wasn't the culprit, he had a significant connection to the criminal!

Because of the "New Life Movement," widespread demolition and construction were happening everywhere in Guangzhou, along with repairs and cleaning of various public and private buildings. Coupled with the construction of the new Guangzhou city... it could be said that construction sites were everywhere. Han Changle had work everywhere, and no one knew exactly where he was. Asking at his home, his wife said Han Changle had been working at a construction site in Shamian recently.

The two found the construction site in Shamian and quickly located the man. When asked about the Sanjiangmao silver, he answered very readily that there was such a thing.

"Where did the silver come from? You are a craftsman; the daily wage is only a few dozen cents. Who would give you twenty taels of silver?"

"It was picked up by this lowly one..."

"Bullshit! Picked up? Why haven't I picked any up?"

"The two masters are blessed by heaven; given time, you will also be able to pick up silver."

Gao Chongjiu laughed: "Inspector, this Old Han is quite good at telling jokes. Let's take him back and let him tell us jokes all night."

"Alright, let him recite 'Su Qin Carrying the Sword' all night."

Gao Chongjiu reached back to unhook the handcuffs from his waist and cuffed Han Changle: "Let's go, waiting for you to go back and tell jokes."

Han Changle's face turned pale, and he shouted injustice loudly. Li Ziyu said slowly: "Shouting injustice isn't as good as telling the truth. Avoid entering the station and delaying your work."

"Alright, alright, I'll speak, I'll speak." Han Changle sweated profusely. "Two masters, do not blame me."

"Speak, I'm listening."

"The silver, I stole it—" Han Changle said with a grimace.

"Stolen? Stolen from where?"

Han Changle's eyes flickered, and after a long time he said: "Just a few days ago..."

A few days ago, he went to work at the construction site as usual and saw a young man dressed as a heavy servant carrying a food box walking by. Tired from walking, he sat down by the street to rest.

Han Changle used to not attend to proper duties and had engaged in petty theft for years. One look at this food box and he knew there was a problem.

"A food box either holds food or is empty; neither would be very heavy. But this servant carrying it was sweating profusely, and the dust kicking up from his heels was particularly heavy."

Gao and Li looked at each other, thinking *indeed an old thief of many years!*

Seeing this appearance, Han Changle knew there must be something fishy about this food box. A food box is bulky, and carrying it doesn't attract attention; people often use it to transfer things that shouldn't be seen—including silver.

With his years of skill, he deliberately bumped the food box with a water bucket while going to load lime mortar, and immediately concluded that it contained silver!

Using a food box to transfer money meant it must be shady money. Even if discovered afterward, the owner would likely not dare to make a noise.

"So I looked for an opportunity and stole an ingot of silver from him," Han Changle said with a grimace. "I was also momentarily confused..."

"Really only one ingot of silver?"

"Really, really. This big twenty-tael ingot, this lowly one wanted to take more but didn't have the skill."

"Were there many silver ingots in the food box?"

"Quite a few, at least a dozen..."

"Where did you steal the silver, and do you remember what this young man looked like?"

"The silver, this lowly one stole it at the construction site outside the Great North Gate. This lowly one can't remember clearly what the person looked like. Only remember he was very young, about sixteen or seventeen. His appearance was quite handsome, looking like a servant from a wealthy family."

"If we bring the person here, can you identify him?"

"This..." Han Changle shook his head in difficulty. "This lowly one dare not guarantee."

"Was this person entering or leaving the city?"

"Entering the city! Entering the city!"

Gao Chongjiu said: "Count yourself sensible! Think again if there's anything else you haven't said. If you say it at the station, that's recording a statement. Just stealing twenty taels of silver is enough to sentence you to a few years..."

"I've said everything I know, everything!" Han Changle was sweating anxiously. "This lowly one was also momentarily blinded by lard..."

Seeing that further questioning would yield nothing new, the two looked at each other. Judging from their experience, Han Changle was not lying.

"If you remember anything else, come find me. You know where to find me, right?" Gao Chongjiu said. "Don't play tricks. And don't go far recently."

"I know, I know. I have a family; I'm not a bachelor..."

"I see there are extra shoes in your house recently. Is there an outsider visiting?" Gao Chongjiu asked casually.

"Yes, yes, nothing escapes you elder! My brother came to Guangzhou from Xiangshan recently."

"What for? Included in the household registration?"

"Here to handle matters for his employer. Household registration is already done! Done!" Han Changle said.
