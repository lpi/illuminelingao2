# Chapter 2651: The Capital (Part 7)

*Biaoju* [Escort Agency] was called *Biaohang* in the late Ming Dynasty. Legend has it that the term *Biaoju* was first popularized by the Australians in Qiongzhou Prefecture. As for why *Biao* (standard/mark) was changed to *Biao* (dart/weapon), the public does not know its origin. Therefore, if one asks the escort industry, some say protecting and delivering goods is the *Biao* (target), so the goods cart is called a *Biao* cart, and losing goods is called losing the *Biao*; others say the Kun people have little culture and confused the two sounds without distinguishing their meanings, so over time the two characters were used interchangeably, changing *Biao* (standard) to *Biao* (dart); still others say the southerners race dragon boats in spring and make brocade flags to reward the winners, called *Jinbiao* (Golden Standard/Championship), and if one can defend the title in the coming year, it is called *Baobiao* (Defending the Standard), meaning guarding the target, hence the name *Baobiao* (Bodyguard). Opinions vary and no one agrees; the original reason is no longer verifiable.

Qiwei Escort Agency's outer counter in Beijing is called "Heliansheng." Since it has been established for a short time, it is just a small escort agency, fully owned and authorized by Qiwei Escort Agency internally. Of course, on the outside, the owner of this escort agency is a local of the capital.

The reason for not using the Qiwei Escort Agency signboard is that the name of Qiwei Escort Agency, coming from the enemy-occupied area of Guangdong, is too sensitive. To avoid potential risks, the Beijing outer counter must completely dissociate itself from Qiwei and eliminate any Australian color.

Heliansheng Escort Agency's management system is distinctly different from the modernized management system of the reformed Qiwei Escort Agency. It uses the most traditional structure: Chief Escort, Escort Masters, and Porters—simple and clear. This is a difference deliberately created to wash away the Australian color from Heliansheng. The total number of people in the escort agency is only over fifty. Among them, only three are Escort Masters transferred from Guangzhou with formal establishment status; the rest are locally recruited escort households and martial artists.

Heliansheng's main function is to undertake freight transport so that Qiwei's escort masters and large carts arriving in Beijing do not return empty or travel empty. At the same time, it also undertakes various related businesses itself. Qiwei's most important function is to provide limited support for expatriate personnel stationed in various places and Delong Bank.

Qiwei Escort Agency's business mainly includes convoy escorts, cart transportation, inns, and warehouses. All these businesses have a common point: they rely on a stable situation and unobstructed official roads. The escort agency started with martial prestige but must establish a foothold based on official prestige, whether this "prestige" comes from the Regional Commanders of the Great Ming or the Commanders of the Australian Song.

When escort agencies run convoys, they rely on making friends. Friends can cooperate, and cooperation can lead to mutual victory. Escort masters and robbers are not enemies but friends. In troubled times, Roving Bandits scurry everywhere, and the owner of every piece of territory is constantly changing. Without stable robbers, there are no stable friends; without friends, one cannot protect the escort silver.

Nowadays, the situation of the Great Ming is becoming increasingly tense. Bandit troubles are rising one after another throughout the world. Roving Bandits and bandits often gather in groups of ten thousand, blocking roads and cutting off trade routes. The escort industry is a product of commodity economy circulation; escorts travel with merchants. The trade route is the escort route. If the trade route is broken, the escort route is gone. If Qiwei's escort routes are broken, Heliansheng's business will not be easy to do either.

The superimposition of multiple unfavorable factors has brought Heliansheng's medium and long-distance escort business almost to a complete standstill, and business has become increasingly depressed. Especially in the last two years, the escort routes have shrunk so much that they can only reach Tianjin and Tongzhou at the farthest. Even the counties under the jurisdiction of Shuntian Prefecture—places slightly more remote—can no longer be reached.

The result of business contraction is having to downsize and reduce personnel. Relying on Delong Bank and affiliated enterprises, they take on some side businesses like cash transport, sitting in shops, and guarding courtyards.

Late autumn, noon. In a three-courtyard *Siheyuan* with side courtyards inside Beijing city. This is both the storehouse of Heliansheng and the residence of Chief Escort Li Rufeng.

In the bedroom, Li Rufeng sat upright on a grand chair. On the square table before him lay a pistol. Beside the pistol was spread a piece of velvet cloth, on which the parts of another revolver were scattered chaotically.

This type of revolver, weighing two jin and using nitrated paper integrated cartridges, is called "Hard in the Waist" or "Fast Horse Iron" by the escort masters of Qiwei Escort Agency, implying that a man cannot be soft below the navel; only when hard can he hold his waist up.

Li Rufeng carefully wiped the mechanism of the revolver with the cloth. After cleaning, he applied a layer of gun oil and deftly assembled and combined the whole gun. His movements were gentle, just like treating his most intimate lover.

The maintained revolver shone with the unique gloomy light of bluing, revealing an industrial beauty. Li Rufeng nodded with satisfaction. His gun was very clean, as clean as if it had just left the factory, without any carbon deposits or rust. In fact, since this gun was issued, it had indeed never been fired.

This was not because Li Rufeng was unskilled with guns. Li Rufeng had always been accurate with guns and could shoot with both hands. Escort masters viewed shooting as a martial art, just as they viewed archery on horseback. Within Qiwei Escort Agency alone, due to different stationing regions, there were several schools such as the Australian Divine Machine Method, the Lingao Flying Smoke and Flowing Fire Art, and the Sun Family Twenty-Four Style Continuous Gun Method. Although there was a unified shooting manual internally, the cryptic terms, common names, and schools created by these escort masters themselves, as well as the artificially created sense of mystery, had already merged into Qiwei's bloodline, becoming a part of Qiwei Escort Agency's *Jianghu* culture, and also provided much material for the development of future legendary novels.

But since arriving in Beijing, Li Rufeng had never conducted any shooting training again. One could not fire guns on the ground of Beijing. Moreover, the pistol itself was big trouble; it would expose his relationship with the Australians.

Two Australian fast guns were sometimes even more coveted than gold and silver. Perhaps no one would rob money, but someone would definitely rob guns. This made the famous Six-Sound Continuous Gun became a deaf man's ear in Shuntian Prefecture—a decoration.

Li Rufeng smeared grease on both pistols, wrapped them in oil paper, opened a secret compartment in the room, and put the pistols inside. This indicated that he would not use these two guns in the short term.

Contrary to his name [Rufeng implies Confucian/Scholarly style], Li Rufeng had not a bit of scholarly style. His thick beard spread out wildly, his strong muscles were knotted, and his whole person was as thick and heavy as a rectangular wall. His age of twenty-seven looked like thirty-seven, perfectly fitting his persona of a crude martial artist.

A rapid knocking sound arose, followed by a voice outside the door: "Master, Old Father Wu from Master Leng's place has come. He is currently drinking tea in the guest seat, saying there is an important matter and he wants to see you immediately."

Li Rufeng frowned. Heliansheng maintained open business dealings with Leng Ningyun, but the two sides were not intimately associated to avoid people's eyes and ears. Wu Kaidi was Leng Ningyun's personal steward, commonly known as "Stand-in Manager Leng" or "Leng Ningyun's Shadow," and would not easily leave Leng Ningyun's side. His personal arrival must mean something big had happened. This gave Li Rufeng a trace of ominous premonition in his heart.

Li Rufeng walked quickly into the main living room. As soon as he entered the door, he saw Wu Kaidi standing there with a pale face. His eyes were dull, and cold sweat soaked his robe. His lips trembled as he forced himself to calm his mind. After a good while, he stabilized his emotions and said to Li Rufeng, "Escort Head Li, people from Wanping County and Shuntian Prefecture came just now, saying they found the corpses of Master Leng's followers on the road outside the capital. They identified them as clerks of Delong from their clothes and personal items, and wanted me to go identify them. Manager Leng went out yesterday and hasn't returned yet. I fear something has happened, so I came to invite the Chief Escort to go with me. Master Leng, I fear, I fear is gone." At this point, Wu Kaidi's voice could not help trembling.

Hearing this, Li Rufeng's right eyelid twitched violently a few times. He was silent for a moment, then shouted to the fellows outside the door: "Prepare the horses; I have business to go out with Old Father Wu." After speaking, he draped a cloak over his shoulders and walked towards the door with large strides, saying to Wu Kaidi, "Old Wu, tell me as we walk."

Wu Kaidi was stunned, then quickly followed.

Li Rufeng walked to the floral-pendant gate, suddenly paused, looked up and thought for a moment, then said to the fellow, "Go call Sanniangzi to go with me."

The winter morning in Beijing was covered in frost, chilling to the bone. Colder than the sharp frost was Li Rufeng's heart.

By the official road in the suburbs of the capital, four corpses lay side by side next to an overturned carriage. Without needing much identification, Wu and Li recognized them as precisely Leng Ningyun's guards and personal page boys. Dozens of bailiffs and archers guarded the bodies. The coroner had already examined the corpses and was filling out the corpse inspection form.

Wu Kaidi walked to the side and whispered to the leading inspector, "Your Honor has worked hard for my master's matter. I fear there will be more trouble for you in the future. Here is a small token of appreciation, just to weigh down Your Honor's hand. I hope you will not refuse." After speaking, he handed over a red silk packet.

The inspector felt it with his hand and knew it was a stack of Australian silver dollars. He couldn't help feeling joy in his heart. Raising his eyebrows and straightening his face, he said solemnly, "Valued Housekeeper, please be at ease. Master Leng is kindhearted; the lucky man has his own help from heaven. We brothers were patrolling here and discovered this matter; how could we wash our hands of it? If there is any use for us brothers in the future, whether into water or fire, we will not decline with half a sentence." After speaking, he stuffed the red silk packet into his bosom.

Wu Kaidi nodded and said again, "We want to examine the scene a bit here. I hope Your Honor can make it convenient."

The inspector glanced at Li Rufeng and nodded. "The County Magistrate and the Judge will arrive shortly. For such a major case, not only must the County Magistrate handle it personally, but Shuntian Prefecture will also inquire. Once the Judge arrives, we will be unable to intervene. Valued Housekeeper needs to be quick." After speaking, he waved his hand, and the archers dispersed, clearing an empty space.

Wu Kaidi turned his head and nodded to Li Rufeng.

With a cold face, Li Rufeng first looked at the corpses, then paced around the perimeter, looking for clues, squatting down from time to time to examine carefully.

Behind Li Rufeng, a woman wrapped in a hood and cloak followed him step by step. A moment later, Li Rufeng asked in a low voice, "What does Sanniangzi think?"

The woman was seven *chi* tall and had an agile figure. Hearing Li Rufeng's question, she stood still. A gust of autumn wind brushed past, lifting the cloak to reveal a pair of Willow Leaf Double Sabers at her waist, with tsuba-rimmed guards and sharkskin-wrapped handles.

The woman said softly, "The comers used horse arrows. The wounds are smooth; they are good steel and sharp arrows. The arrow wounds are in the chest and face. The bandits' archery was accurate; they must be people who strive for precision in archery. After shooting the people, the bandits retrieved the arrowheads. The hoof prints beside the corpses and wheel ruts are lingering and messy; there should have been three horses. If it were travelers rushing on their journey, they would certainly not stay. Most likely, they were the bandits' horses. Short knives and bows are not hard to get, but just one good horse costs over a hundred taels of fine silk silver. One must have quite a family fortune to afford it. These are not ordinary highwaymen."
