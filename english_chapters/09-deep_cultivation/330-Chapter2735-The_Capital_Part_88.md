# Chapter 2735: The Capital (Part 87)

"Heliansheng contributed the most this time, and the losses weren't small either," Leng Ningyun said. "I won't say more than necessary. You two compile a list of all personnel who contributed, and distribute rewards according to rank. Everyone on Heliansheng's roster, whether they contributed or not, receives five taels of silver each. Those who contributed will receive additional rewards based on their merit. As for rewards for you two, I'll submit a separate request to the Cadre Department."

Li and Liao were both on the Senate's cadre roster, so major rewards were outside his jurisdiction. However, a letter from him could bring them great benefits.

"Thank you for your generosity, Chief Leng," Li Rufeng said. "But this was originally our duty. We'd be grateful if our superiors don't punish us."

Escort masters, by professional habit, never boasted of their achievements—humble to the point of self-abasement. This made Leng Ningyun feel guilty. "How could you be punished? If anyone should be punished, it's me!" He sighed. "It was all because I wasn't careful enough! Greedy for credit, acting rashly! Ah..."

He sighed repeatedly. Li and Liao said nothing, watching Senator Leng's self-reflection with respectful expressions. When his sighs ended, Liao Sanniang finally spoke: "The Master's concern for everyone at Heliansheng, great and small, is deeply appreciated. However, there were casualties in this operation..."

"People died?" Leng Ningyun was somewhat surprised.

"Yes, three killed in action, eight wounded," Liao Sanniang said. "We ask for the Master's special consideration..."

Leng Ningyun said, "The wounded will receive double the top-tier reward. Those killed... give them triple."

Liao Sanniang said, "Among the fallen was one named Tang Ba. When storming the hostage room, he blocked a sword meant for the Grand Manager. Could he receive the first merit reward?"

"Blocked a sword?" Leng Ningyun looked blank.

Li Rufeng quickly recounted the situation from that day: "...Thanks to his desperate fighting, he blocked that sword."

"If so, give him first merit," Leng Ningyun said with deep regret. "Pity he's already dead!"

"Yes, it was his fate," Li Rufeng said softly.

"Give the silver to his family. Does he have relatives?"

"A brother, left in their hometown in the countryside," Li Rufeng said. "Bureau rules are that when an escort dies in action, if the family wants to eat this bowl of rice, we take them in. Even if they can't be strikers, we give them some job."

"Have his brother come to the capital. The countryside isn't safe these days. With a thousand taels of silver, he couldn't hold onto it there anyway."

"Yes, we'll do as you say."

After handling the reward matters, Leng Ningyun had the two recount everything that had happened during this period, asking questions about points that concerned him.

The more he learned about this affair, the more suspicious it seemed. After a long while, he said, "It seems this matter isn't simple."

"Indeed," Li Rufeng said. "Lady Sanniang and I figured that they each had their own agendas, which threw them into disarray. This was Heaven's blessing on our Great Song and on the Senator."

Leng Ningyun smiled. "No need for flattery. When you return, write up a report of your experiences during this period—if you can't write it, I'll have Old Wu help you. Be detailed. Also, send all relevant letters to Delong."

After dismissing the escort masters, Leng Ningyun had all Delong's staff assembled. He spoke words of encouragement and comfort, stating that salaries would continue during the closure. Those who had contributed to related activities would also receive bonuses as appropriate.

As for the two assistant managers, he didn't criticize their "wavering stance." People's positions largely depended on their interests. It wasn't surprising they had such thoughts. But their future development at Delong would end here.

After the meeting, he kept Delong's middle and senior staff behind to discuss the next steps. First, how to handle the looming run on the bank. Second, how to continue operating under the current state of quasi-warfare between the parties.

Though Delong Bank in the capital was the Beijing branch of Delong Bank, due to social environment and staff sources, its operating model was still traditional, with only minor modern banking modifications. For example, using new accounting systems and bookkeeping methods, and wire transfers.

These new systems plugged some loopholes in the old system and opened up new business markets—for instance, long-distance wire transfers were something only Delong could do; no other establishment could manage it. This was an important reason Delong could establish itself in the capital.

But now the changing situation forced them to make changes, or they might not survive in the capital.

"Everyone probably knows the situation. Our days in the capital are getting harder," Leng Ningyun surveyed the people seated in the hall.

Present, except for the chief accountant who was a naturalized cadre from Lingao, the assistant managers and counter clerks were all people he'd recruited from the local money business.

In the capital's money trade, "Shanxi House" was the biggest force. From shareholders and managers to clerks and errand boys, all were from Shanxi, even from the same small towns. Internal cohesion was extremely strong. Most employees were single men who came to the capital for work. Outsiders could hardly get in.

So when Leng Ningyun came to the capital to open a bank, he mostly hired people from the capital's "Shaoxing faction" in the money trade. The Shaoxing faction was far weaker than Shanxi House and thus less closed off.

He had little choice when hiring these people. In earlier years, the money business was very stable, and shop assistants rarely changed employers. So the only people available were either newly qualified apprentices recommended by the trade association, or clerks who had lost their jobs for various reasons—including some dismissed for breaking shop rules. So when Delong opened, the capital's peers weren't optimistic about them.

He'd built this team from scratch, established a foothold in the capital, and firmly placed among the top ten banks—the hardships and effort involved were known only to himself.

Closing shop and leaving would certainly be safest, but this team he'd painstakingly built, along with the capital's situation, once scattered, would take a very long time to reassemble.

Everyone in the hall looked apprehensive. After all, Manager Leng—the trade and officialdom knew he had connections to the Short-Hairs. If his backing weren't so strong and his connections so deep, never mind him—they themselves would have been in prison long ago.

"Though times are hard, we still have to get by. First, to be worthy of our customers; second, to be worthy of everyone here." Leng Ningyun looked at the crowd. "We're all on the Delong ship. The ship isn't wrecked—we've just hit some big waves. If we can weather this together, as long as the ship doesn't capsize, there's a way out. If you jump overboard, in the big waves, it's as good as suicide."

The people in the hall said nothing, but their expressions varied. Leng Ningyun observed each face, silently taking note.

Assistant Manager Xiao, whose "serious wavering" had been exposed during this incident, was the first to speak up: "Grand Manager is right. Only if we all work together with one heart can we overcome this difficulty. We've weathered the biggest crisis so far. Now that the Grand Manager is back, we have a backbone—there's nothing to fear!"

Leng Ningyun nodded slightly. "Well said, Assistant Manager Xiao. Though we're in difficulty, we're not at the end of our rope. I know what everyone fears. One is the authorities; two is a bank run."

He spoke casually, showing confidence.

"Old Wu will handle the authorities. In a few days, we'll naturally resume business. The Delong sign doesn't have 'Short-Hair' carved on it—you needn't worry too much. But there will be some business adjustments."

The first adjustment was to stop accepting exchange business with Liangguang—and ordinary remittances would no longer be offered either.

"...Focus the exchange business mainly on Jiangnan and Shandong. Losing some business doesn't matter. Safety comes first."

Second, stop soliciting large deposits. Originally, attracting deposits was Delong's most important task. The capital had many officials and nobles with nowhere to put their silver. This made large-scale deposit collection convenient and provided ample cash flow for the Senate's Liangguang operations. But now, with transportation cut off and Delong under everyone's spotlight, money movement had become extremely difficult. The slightest disturbance risked a run, and large-scale deposits would inevitably cause exchange difficulties.

"What if someone wants to deposit?" someone asked.

"If they want to deposit, naturally we follow the old rules with preferential interest," Leng Ningyun said. "We won't be proactive, but we needn't be timid either, refusing money that comes to us."

"...Third, all Delong employees with families in the capital must move into the dormitory compound. Many people are eyeing Delong right now—we fear someone might take family members hostage." Leng Ningyun said. "Those who want to send families back to their hometowns can arrange for Heliansheng to escort them."

Given the circumstances, no one objected.

"The next difficult matter is the bank run." Leng Ningyun sighed. "I had Mr. Liu calculate: not counting minor accounts, outstanding notes total about 330,000 taels. Our current total reserves are only 150,000. That's a gap of 180,000."

Except for the two assistant managers, the other clerks didn't know the specific figures on the balance sheet. Hearing this number, everyone drew a sharp breath.

"I'll find a way to cover this 180,000 gap. But the method may not work—it's about fifty-fifty." Leng Ningyun said. "Even if it works, it may not fully cover such a large gap. So everyone needs to help maintain things."

A clerk surnamed Zhou said, "Since the Master has explained everything, we have nothing to say but to do our best. But please tell us specifically what to do."

"Mister Wu has gone to negotiate with Lord Zhong of Shuntian Prefecture. In three to five days, the seal should be lifted. Once unsealed, we open immediately."
