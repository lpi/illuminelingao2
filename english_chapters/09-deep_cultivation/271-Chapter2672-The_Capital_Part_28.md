# Chapter 2672: The Capital (Part 28)

Zhou Lezhi didn't see the scene of choosing the name later. This scene was told to him by the Teacher when he received this name later. When telling him, the Teacher's face was grim, seeming to vaguely contain some kind of regret. But what exactly the Teacher was thinking, probably only the Teacher himself knew.

Zhou Lezhi was chatting idly with Wang Liang on the stern deck at this time. Seeing Mr. Zhou coming out of Master Wang's cabin, he quickly followed. The two returned to their cabin, and Mr. Zhou ordered him to pack things up, preparing to depart.

"Where are we going?"

"To Guangzhou!" Mr. Zhou's eyebrows danced with joy. "Aren't you a native of Guangzhou?"

"Really?" Zhou Lezhi had been away from home for almost a year. Hearing they were going to Guangzhou at this moment, his spirit lifted. "This small one will pack right away!" After speaking, he began packing luggage in the cabin. Only then did he discover the two pairs of powder compacts taken from Master Wang were still in the cabin, so he quickly wrapped them in silk cloth, intending to return them.

He walked across the gangplank to Master Wang's boat, walked along the gunwale walkway to the side of the central cabin, and was just about to return to the deck when he found Wang Liang, who usually stayed outside the central cabin door, was not there. There was no one on the deck either.

"This Uncle Wang! Where did he go to slack off again!" Zhou Lezhi was secretly amused. This Wang Liang had hooked up with a servant woman recently and would go to unmanned places in the fleet to be affectionate whenever he was free. It was probably the case again now.

However, since Wang Liang wasn't there, he wasn't sure if he should disturb the Master for such a small matter as returning powder compacts. Just as he was hesitating, he suddenly heard someone speaking inside the cabin. It was exactly Liu Zhao's voice:

"...What other orders does the Master have?"

"Escorting Jin and Wei south this time, you detour back to Shaoxing and bring a message to the Second Master. Just say: 'Second Uncle cannot inherit the title; find a way to make them shut up.' You must deliver this message personally. Don't let a second person know, and absolutely do not leave written evidence."

"Subordinate understands."

"There is one more thing you must arrange properly." Master Wang's voice became gloomy. "In a few days, I will send people to send Miss Wei and Mr. Jin in batches to settle in that new manor in Dongyang. You must send reliable hands to guard and protect them, keep them separately, order them to stay indoors and rarely go out, and do not leak news."

"Yes! Subordinate prepares to arrange Chen Mo to guard there. He handles things properly and keeps his mouth tight."

"En..." Judging by the voice, the Master was relatively satisfied with this arrangement. Then there was silence, and Liu Zhao was not heard speaking either. Zhou Lezhi was nervous for a while. He knew eavesdropping on the master speaking was a great taboo. He wanted to leave, but this place was narrow and all made of boat planks; it was easy to bump and make noise. It would be even more inappropriate if he were heard.

After weighing the situation, he had to hold his breath and focus, shrinking his body into the shadows, waiting for the conversation to end.

"Tell Chen Mo, around the twelfth lunar month I will send him a letter. If the letter says 'Need to send festival gifts to the capital for New Year, send thirty hams,' then everything is safe and sound; if it says 'Freezing weather, roads difficult, no need to send hams, send silver instead,' let him end the lives of Jin and Wei immediately."

Hearing this, Zhou Lezhi felt as if struck by lightning, his whole body stiff. Although he wasn't familiar with Mr. Jin and Miss Wei, the Master had treated them as honored guests these days, not only providing excellent supplies and being polite when meeting, but also arranging a place for them to settle during the day—yet at night he was already preparing to take their lives.

"As for that Sorcerer, when you arrive in Guangzhou Prefecture, if the treasure is found, you first find a way to detain him. Do not give it to that Rough Stock. Wait until you bring him back to the capital to make further plans. If this person makes any strange moves, I imagine you have ways to make him obedient." Wang Yehao gave critical instructions in an extremely low voice. However, the river was quiet at night, and the cabin wall was just wood with no sound insulation, so the single wall allowed Zhou Lezhi to hear clearly.

"Master rest assured. We Jinyiwei are not all noble relatives who just mess around for food." Liu Zhao replied.

"Watch the measure. Unless absolutely necessary, do not harm his life. If there is a situation, you can use your secret line to transmit the news to my Fourth Uncle."

After a moment of silence, Wang Yehao asked again, "With your connections in the capital, do you know any Feng Shui eccentrics? Must know their roots and bottom; don't want swindlers."

Liu Zhao thought for a moment and said, "There is a clan brother who also serves in the Jinyiwei, called Liu Sha. His ancestors started by helping people look at *Yin* Residences [Graves]. It is said he has some real learning. I wonder what use the Master has?"

"Good. You just write a recommendation note." Wang Yehao didn't explain the intention. Liu Zhao knew the rules and didn't probe further.

Cold sweat broke out on Zhou Lezhi's back. It seemed his own Teacher was temporarily safe, but this Master acted so ruthlessly. If the Teacher had any issues in the future, he would probably be "ended" mercilessly too.

"How are that Procuress and Youqing?"

"Already settled. The Procuress offered Youqing up, and Prefect Zhou let her off the hook, closing the case as theft." There was some envy in Liu Zhao's words. "We men encountered danger, but let him pick up a big bargain! Getting a great beauty for free. Miss Youqing's price is at least one or two thousand taels of silver!"

"Hehe, Master Zhou won't keep her for himself. Such a courtesan queen is not something ordinary people can enjoy..."

"I wonder which Master has such romantic fortune."

"Hehe, you dog talent, what does it have to do with you!" Master Wang laughed. "Don't think about these existent or non-existent things. Do your errand well. If things are done well, your benefits won't be lacking!"

"Yes, many thanks to the Master for cultivation!"

Liu Zhao took his leave and came out. Zhou Lezhi waited for a long time more. Seeing no more movement inside the cabin or on the deck, he lowered his body and crawled back to Mr. Zhou's boat using both hands and feet.

Mr. Zhou knew nothing about this, packing his own things happily as usual.

There weren't many things to prepare here. Mr. Zhou's two maids had already packed properly. Mr. Zhou didn't plan to take the two maids to Guangzhou this time—taking female family members on such a long journey was neither convenient nor safe. The Teacher had to bear the pain of parting, asking the Wang residence people heading south to send them back to the Dongyang manor. However, at parting, the Teacher still said to them with deep affection: "Zhiling, Jieyi, if you get pregnant, I will be responsible!"

If it were in the past, seeing the Teacher's wretched appearance, Zhou Lezhi would have snickered. But the things he heard today impacted him greatly. The life he once felt had a bright future became dim and lightless.

The next day, Mr. Zhou's group transferred to a small boat heading west, traveling west along the Yangtze River. The scenery on both banks of the Yangtze was magnificent, but the Teacher had no mood to enjoy it, only hating that this water route was too slow. Hearing his complaints, Liu Zhao came out to explain: "Although post horses can travel two or three hundred *li* a day, one requires proficient riding skills, which I fear the Teacher can't handle. If taking a sedan chair, we have to stop and stay in inns at night. But water routes only need the boatmen to rotate, allowing day and night travel. Moreover, we have few people and the boat is light; overall, it's faster than taking a carriage."

Hearing Liu Zhao say this, the Teacher had no choice but to sit at the bow all day, putting on a look of gazing through wearing eyes. Until one day, he suddenly jumped up from the bow and hurriedly called Zhou Lezhi: "Quickly prepare the four treasures of the study!"

Back in the cabin, he leaned over the table writing and drawing for half a day, then said confidently to Zhou Lezhi: "Look, I plan to add two paddle wheels to the boat. By pedaling with human power, we can accelerate! There are many similar pedal boats in parks. I calculated; the efficiency should be okay."

Zhou Lezhi listened in confusion, looked at the full paper of patterns, scratched his head, and said, "What park is the Teacher talking about? And what is a pedal boat..."

"This sheet is the calculation process; the back pages are three-view drawings." Zhou Lezhi explained patiently, "It means looking from the front, looking from above, looking from the side. Haven't drawn for a long time, but the meaning shouldn't be wrong. How is it? Very vivid, right? How about finding a carpenter when we dock to rest tonight, and I'll explain to him."

Zhou Lezhi thought this Teacher really came up with one thing after another. Where to find a carpenter on this journey, and installing wheels on the boat—the boat owner wouldn't agree either. But having followed the Teacher for these days, he was already very familiar with his personality. Three-view drawings were not unfamiliar to him either. He examined the drawing carefully, roughly understood the meaning, and said, "Is this paddle wheel similar to a waterwheel?"

"Right, right, you are very perceptive!" The Teacher was quite excited. "If I draw like this, can the carpenter understand?"

"The carpenter should have no problem. Only, with this object of the Teacher, can we travel a thousand *li* a day?"

"No."

"A hundred *li*?"

"Choking [Struggling/Unlikely]."

"Then installing it is useless. Besides, stopping the boat to install takes time, and after installing, we need more boatmen..."

Hearing this, Liu Zhao laughed, "If the Teacher is anxious, I'll just give the boatmen more wine money and let them row faster."

After sending off the Hearthstone Daoist's group, Wang Yehao didn't rush back to the capital. Instead, he stayed in Yangzhou for a few more days, finding opportunities to associate with Tian Hongyu. He intended to win over this future "Imperial Father-in-Law" mentioned by Mr. Zhou. Not only did he quietly gift him a heavy present, but he also hinted to Prefect Zhou to give Youqing to Tian Hongyu.

Tian Hongyu came from a martial background. Although he was quite famous in the pursuit of sensuality and was a royal relative, and had some friends in officialdom, most civil officials from the imperial examination background actually didn't regard him highly, treating him as a class of spongers.

Now this Master Wang not only respected him very much but also presented heavy gifts. Tian Hongyu felt quite flattered. Although he knew the other party intended to win him over, he actually had no place to repay. Although he was a royal relative, his daughter was just a side consort of Prince Xin—to be honest, even the proper consort Zhou's father, or even the current Empress Zhang's father, didn't count as any red-hot figures. This made Tian Hongyu both touched and uneasy.

When Wang Yehao headed north, Tian Hongyu went to the pier to see him off, mentioning that he received much grace from Master Wang but had no way to repay, which truly made him ashamed. Wang Yehao laughed:

"Master Tian, a lucky man has his own heavenly aspect. Right now is just a time of bad luck. In the future, great fortune will surely strike the head. Probably before long, you and I can still meet in the capital."

"Then I'll take Master Wang's auspicious words." Tian Hongyu didn't know the meaning in his words but felt they contained Zen logic. He dared not ask more and bowed to the ground immediately. "Wishing Master Wang smooth winds all the way and rising step by step!"
