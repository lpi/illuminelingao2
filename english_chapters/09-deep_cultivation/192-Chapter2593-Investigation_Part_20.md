# Chapter 2593 - Investigation (Part 20)

He Jun was silent for a long time. Finally, he said: "Since you know, elder brother has nothing to hide anymore. This business that was making money hand over fist—now it's finished!"

"If it's finished, it's finished. Though this business makes good money, honestly it's risky too." Zheng Xiaoyu pretended to be magnanimous in consoling him. "Since it can't continue, just make money from peaceful business."

"If only it were that simple." He Jun sighed. "Getting on the pirate ship is easy; getting off is hard!"

"Oh? Why's that?" Zheng Xiaoyu affected surprise.

"Sigh, it's a long story." After a few cups of wine, He Jun's "worries increased," and he wanted to pour out all his troubles to someone.

His "sworn brotherhood" with Zheng Xiaoyu had been just an expedient to cultivate connections. But after these days of interaction, the two actually hit it off, their temperaments compatible. Gradually, the pretense became real.

"I won't hide it from you, brother. Here in Huizhou, my family's business is also ancestral..."

He Jun's "Bailing Tang" pharmacy in Huizhou, though lacking "a hundred years" of history, was still an old establishment passed down three generations. Within the prefectural city, it wasn't "top two," but definitely made the "top ten."

By the time it reached He Jun, Bailing Tang was lukewarm—operating normally without incident, but without much business growth either. In old-timeline terms, operations had hit a "bottleneck."

In business, you need both "maintaining" and "pioneering"—like rowing against the current, not advancing means retreating. He Jun was a "third generation" with keen crisis awareness. After taking over as boss, he thought day and night about how to pioneer new business. Unfortunately, Huizhou had the Grotto Heaven medicine market—a pharmaceutical "battlefield." Anyone who survived here, even just with a stall, had been "bred through competition." He Jun, despite all his skills, could only maintain the old situation here.

---

Then opportunity arrived. Someone introduced him to a piece of business: this was "Lushi Powder."

"Lushi Powder? That medicine is sold everywhere on the streets!" Zheng Xiaoyu feigned disdain.

"Brother, that's Wanchun Quan's Lushi Powder—naturally useless. But once you add the special ingredients, it becomes a miracle drug effective after one dose..."

"Elder brother means these extracted Australian drugs..."

"Correct. Exactly so." He Jun said. This business was introduced to him by a Boluo drug merchant named Quan Youde. At first, he just had him use his channels to distribute "Treasure-label" Lushi Powder. Later, when "Treasure-label" Lushi Powder sold well, he was surprised and went to Quan Youde, hoping for more goods to distribute.

Quan Youde readily agreed, but his conditions were harsh. Not only monthly sales targets, but also cash before goods. Whatever monthly sales quota you committed to, first pay Jubao Tang, then pick up goods.

The business went very smoothly at first. Though He Jun wasn't making money hand over fist, monthly profits were considerable. Then Quan Youde met him again, proposing that he find a way to obtain prescription forms. And stated that if he could obtain prescription forms, he'd be a "partner," not just a "distributor."

"Quan Youde said if I could get them prescription forms, they'd give me half a percent of revenue. My distribution drug quota could also be further increased. I thought this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and joined. What happened next, you already know."

"Now that prescription forms can be obtained, why don't they want them anymore?"

"That Quan Youde just says there's plenty of drugs now and temporarily no need for new prescriptions. But after a little inquiry, I learned their upstream channel has been cut. Those small peddlers getting goods from Jubao Tang have all been cut off!"

"What about your side, elder brother?" Zheng Xiaoyu pressed.

"This month's goods were delivered in full." He Jun said listlessly. "But what about next month?"

This was indeed a problem. Zheng Xiaoyu knew the upstream cutoff was precisely because of Zheng Mingjiang's "flying inspection." This inspection's result would necessarily reduce the formerly rushing supply channel to a trickle. So never mind small peddlers—even He Jun might not get goods next month.

He pretended confusion: "What, has Quan Youde already said there's no goods?"

"He hasn't said that." He Jun said. A few days ago, Quan Youde had gathered the major distributors, saying upstream drug sourcing had indeed developed problems, but the channel wasn't cut—it would recover after a while. So everyone needed to "weather this together"—implying they still had to pay next month's goods money on time, but he wouldn't guarantee timely delivery of full quantities.

"How strange—can't even guarantee delivery, yet still wants advance payment? What kind of business is this!" Zheng Xiaoyu slammed the table. "What if he can't deliver and just takes the money and runs?"

"Isn't that what I'm saying." He Jun said. "But Quan Youde also said: those who won't order and pay this time needn't come for goods in the future. He won't supply Lushi Powder to them either."

So that's it! Zheng Xiaoyu thought. No wonder He Jun was in a dilemma. Everyone knew continuing as a distributor was very risky, but they were reluctant to give up. Probably the business profits were astonishingly large—they couldn't bear to let go!

Zheng Xiaoyu asked: "So what does elder brother think?"

"I'm different from the others." He Jun said. "If I were just a distributor, I'd quit this business immediately. No matter how big the business, money needs to be safely pocketed. Especially for this kind of inherently risky business. When things look wrong, leaving is the best strategy. But..."

He sighed again.

Apparently, Quan Youde had specially discussed with him privately. As a "profit-sharing" partner now, he could still get next month's drugs in full—on condition he prepaid six months' worth.

"Six months?!" Even Zheng Xiaoyu was shocked. With delivery already clearly problematic, still demanding distributors prepay six months—this wasn't business, it was outright robbery!

"What did elder brother say?"

"Naturally I refused." He Jun smiled bitterly. "I'm no fool. He gives verbal guarantees of full delivery, but who knows if he'll even be in Huizhou next month? Where would I go for goods?"

"Exactly, exactly. Don't do this business!"

"I never expected Quan Youde would turn hostile, saying he'd report me for trafficking prescription forms..." He Jun's face was filled with worry. "Saying my trafficking prescription forms is a grave crime—the Australians would definitely execute my entire family if they knew."

Zheng Xiaoyu said: "He's also involved in trafficking prescription forms. Isn't he afraid of getting burned?"

"The prescription forms weren't delivered directly to him..."

So the prescription form trafficking was connected through Quan Youde, but delivery and payment were handled by someone else. It couldn't be traced to Quan Youde at all.

Zheng Xiaoyu put on a troubled expression: "If he says that, it's indeed difficult. If this gets out..."

"Yes, I'm also worried that if he really reports me, even you would be implicated! Sigh, thinking it over, there's no good solution. I can only spit back the money I've earned and be done with it—just consider it a spring dream!"

Undoubtedly, Zheng Mingjiang's actions in Guangzhou had stirred the originally stable industry chain. Now this chain from top to bottom had begun revealing cracks. From Quan Youde's behavior, they were probably assessing that regaining drug supplies was unlikely—hence the hasty "making one last profit."

Not only making profit, but also recovering downstream parties' money—quite vicious. Zheng Xiaoyu had no doubt that under their combination of threats and inducements, many distributors would be fooled.

But though Quan Youde and his Jubao Tang were important, they probably weren't the core figures of this fake drug case. Zheng Xiaoyu thought. Especially Quan Youde—he was practically operating semi-publicly. So the money wouldn't be in his hands; he himself was probably a pawn that could be discarded anytime. Finding the mastermind behind the scenes would probably take more effort.

"Since that's the case, paying for peace isn't unreasonable." Zheng Xiaoyu said. "Just somewhat unwilling! Sigh!"

These words stirred He Jun's indignation: "Sigh! Speaking of it, for this Lushi Powder distribution, I've spent plenty of money. Especially the route to Fujian and Zhejiang—I personally led my manager going client by client, delivering samples, setting up stalls... How much work I did to build up 'credit' for these medicines! Now look—no drugs, and they want to take back all the hard-earned money we made!"

Zheng Xiaoyu said deliberately: "Elder brother needn't be angry. Since Quan Youde is unjust, we needn't be righteous to him! Think about it—in these days of dealings with him, does he have any weak points?"

He Jun hesitated: "Weak points? This Quan Youde is crafty as can be. Every time we meet, it's all secretive. When I go see him, even my servants can't approach..."

"Maybe not any specific thing. Any strange places? Saw any unusual people or events? Even just a few words?" Zheng Xiaoyu coaxed patiently.

With this prompting, He Jun seemed to recall something. He lowered his head in careful thought for a long while, then said: "If you put it that way, there are a few things that left an impression at the time. Don't know if they're useful."

"Let's hear them!"

"This Quan Youde seems to personally know Australian 'cadres' like you, brother." He Jun said. "Once when I went to see him, tea cups were being cleared from the reception hall. On the Eight Immortals table was a crumpled note still not cleaned up. I glanced at it—the exposed writing seemed to be written with an 'Australian pen.'"

"Really?!" Zheng Xiaoyu was slightly excited. "Australian pen" meant either fountain pen or pencil. Besides Elders and naturalized citizen cadres and employees, ordinary people rarely used them. "Was the ink blue or gray?"

"Really! The ink was blue." He Jun nodded. "I've seen Australian pen writing before."
