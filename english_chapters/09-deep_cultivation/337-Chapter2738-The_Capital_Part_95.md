# Chapter 2738: The Capital (Part 94)

Hypertension patients particularly disliked noise. It made sense that he'd hide away for peace and quiet year-round. Moreover, his recent symptoms had been quite severe—after all, it was winter, when blood pressure tended to run high.

"Mister Wu, send these two gifts ahead of time. Make sure to explain the medication instructions to the steward."

"Master..."

Outside the curtain, a maid called softly.

Though his head felt like it would split and waves of pain throbbed at his temples, Li Luoyou responded:

"What is it?"

"Grand Manager Leng has sent someone with gifts."

A nameless fury surged straight to his brain, almost making him explode.

But he remembered the doctors' warnings to "calm his mind and spirit" and not get angry, lest he suffer a sudden stroke—once paralyzed, it would mean death or disability.

Death he wasn't afraid of. He was nearly sixty, had experienced everything in life. Though he inevitably had regrets, his life had been rich and colorful. But disability would reduce him to others' mercy.

From a powerful patriarch commanding authority to a cripple at others' disposal—never mind the physical torment, the mental anguish alone was unacceptable.

"If there are gifts, let them be gifts. Give them to the Madam." Though he didn't lose his temper, he'd already decided: if this girl had come on her own initiative to report, twenty strokes of the board awaited her.

Though household rules said servants shouldn't be punished before the fifteenth of the first month, this was the separate residence, not "home." He could do as he pleased.

Perhaps sensing the board was coming, the maid's voice trembled: "It was... the Madam told me to report. She said two of the items are medicines, both suited for the Master's ailment."

"What nonsense." Li Luoyou said impatiently. "I've had this condition for years and taken countless medicines. This Leng Ningyun isn't Hua Tuo reborn—what miracle cure could he have?"

"The Madam says Manager Leng said the medicine is most effective, works immediately, and it's a Nanyang product..."

"Nanyang goods" was now the capital's euphemism for "Australian goods." Since the Short-Hairs invaded Liangguang, the capital's merchants avoided saying "Australian goods." "Short-Hair goods" was even more taboo.

Manager Leng sending Nanyang goods wasn't unusual—he was a Short-Hair himself. As for whether he was a fake or real one, Mr. Li didn't care.

Australian goods, whether gifted or purchased, while not exactly "piling mountain-high," weren't particularly rare to him. Speaking of medicines, he'd seen some too, including several "peace medicines" now popular in the capital—things like "Zhuge's March Powder" and "Plague-Avoiding Powder."

The most famous was probably the Anti-Malaria Pill. He'd seen it in Guangzhou and was astonished. But the Australians themselves seemed to have very few, and it wasn't sold. Only through significant connections could one obtain a few pills. But once taken, effects were immediate.

As for the "Stove-Stone Powder" and other "Australian wonder drugs" sold everywhere in the capital and Jiangnan in recent years, Li Luoyou didn't trust them despite their sterling reputations. Gu Baocheng, who wrote monthly letters, had never mentioned these medicines. For years, he'd had Gu Baocheng watch for Australian medicines in Lingao that might treat his "head wind."

Now that Leng Ningyun had sent medicine for "head wind," he couldn't help becoming half-suspicious, half-hopeful.

However, since Leng Ningyun was a genuine Short-Hair who was now seeking his help, he presumably wouldn't send fake medicine.

This piqued his interest. His head seemed less painful too. He immediately said:

"Dress me!"

With the maids' help, he put on casual robes and went to the bright reception room outside.

This "Quick Snow Pavilion" was where Li Luoyou specifically spent winters in Madam Qiao's residence. Though called a "pavilion," it was actually a small courtyard with three bright rooms and two dark rooms. Every room here had hidden fire dragons (heated channels). In winter, once fires were lit, the rooms felt like spring. In winter, he and Madam Qiao lived and entertained here.

"Master!" Seeing him approach, Madam Qiao immediately rose to greet him with a curtsy. She'd been with Li Luoyou for over twenty years and had borne children. By rights, she was a "person of merit" in the Li household and could be informal. Yet before Li Luoyou, her manners remained impeccable, not daring the slightest negligence.

Seeing Li Luoyou's pained expression and tottering steps, she quickly replaced the maid in supporting him, calling out, "Bring the Nanyang rattan chair!"

The "Nanyang rattan chair" was what the old timeline called a "rattan armchair with backrest." Though it was a traditional Chinese rattan craft product, its design was actually modeled on late Qing/early Republic Western high-backed chairs. Very ergonomic. The high back and slightly tilted curved lumbar support, combined with the rattan bamboo's slight elasticity, could fully support the human torso—especially suitable for weak patients like Li Luoyou.

This chair was made of the finest Lingao red-white rattan, with excellent materials and exquisite craftsmanship. Naturally, the price was considerable. Li Luoyou sat down and couldn't help sighing with relief. He said softly, "What medicine did this Manager Leng send that you had to make such a fuss?"

"I wouldn't dare disturb the Master carelessly. It's just that Mister Wu who brought the gifts said these two medicines would greatly benefit the Master's condition, with immediate effect. That's why..."

"Oh." Li Luoyou said noncommittally. He was too tired to speak, merely pointing at the table beside him.

Madam Qiao quickly brought over the four gift items from Leng Ningyun. Li Luoyou had no interest in examining them closely. He just picked up the two medicines and briefly examined them.

"This is Liver-Soothing Pill. Mister Wu instructed: twice daily, one pill each time. Effects are immediate. But it shouldn't be stopped. He's sent a three-month supply."

Li Luoyou nodded weakly. "Immediate effect? Is this an immortal elixir?"

Madam Qiao didn't dare respond. Seeing no other reaction from him, she continued: "This bottle is Musk Heart-Protecting Elixir. Mister Wu said that since the Master has head wind, he probably also often has heart pain and palpitations. When an attack occurs, immediately dissolve one pill under the tongue for relief. Alternatively, take one pill daily for preventive care."

"Take one of each and dissolve them in water," he ordered.

Having been ill so long, he'd become somewhat a doctor himself and researched various medicines and pharmacology. Besides Suhexiang Decoction and various prescriptions over the years, he'd also used a "Pain-Relieving Pill"—another new medicine marketed as an "Australian drug." Very effective. But he knew its secret.

"Though this thing relieves pain effectively, it's actually opium," he'd warned his family. "Taking too much creates addiction. The body becomes weak and lazy—one becomes a wreck!"

A maid presented two small dishes and a pair of silver chopsticks. He raised the dish, lightly sniffed the medicine's scent, used the chopsticks to poke the residue, and lightly tasted with the tip of his tongue.

After a long while, he said, "Very well. Let's try one dose."

To his surprise, within just one hour of taking the medicine, the head swelling and pain gradually disappeared. The dizziness also faded.

Previously, although Pain-Relieving Pills could stop the pain, the dizziness couldn't be removed.

Once comfortable, his appetite improved. Seeing this, Madam Qiao was overjoyed. She ordered light porridge and side dishes brought and served him his meal.

With his stomach satisfied, weariness followed. These past days, his sleep had been hazy—half-dreaming, half-waking, with nightmares of dangerous situations. He always woke exhausted. Now, as sleepiness came, Madam Qiao immediately prepared bedding in the warm alcove for him to rest.

He slept until dusk approached. When Li Luoyou rose, he felt clear-headed and sharp-eyed. His previously exhausted body was full of energy.

Such good condition had been rare in recent years. Li Luoyou couldn't help secretly marveling: The Australians really were impressive!

Feeling well, even his expressions toward Madam Qiao, the maids, and servants improved considerably. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. The residence finally had some of the relaxed, happy New Year atmosphere.

But Li Luoyou didn't share Madam Qiao's relaxation. He examined Leng Ningyun's gifts again carefully. Both were valuable and very thoughtful—clearly meant to win his favor.

Since Leng Ningyun's arrival in the capital several years ago, though business relations meant frequent dealings between Liaohai Trading and Delong, he personally had minimal contact with Leng Ningyun. Besides their first meeting when he came to the capital, there had been no private interactions. Leng Ningyun's attitude was quite proactive—visiting cards and greetings at the three major festivals, gifts and condolences for any weddings or funerals.

His cold treatment of Leng Ningyun wasn't simple "avoidance" or grudge over the refused artillery sale years ago. Rather, ever since the burning of the Five Rams Post Station, he'd felt: the Short-Hairs weren't creatures content to stay in a pond.

They weren't the Portuguese, who occupied Macau and were content with a place to settle and do business—the Short-Hairs had "grand designs."

This barely concealed ambition had reached a peak before Liangguang fell. He had some knowledge of the Short-Hairs' actions these years through his commercial network. Whether meddling in Shandong's unrest, destroying the Zheng Zhilong group, forcing Liu Xiang's surrender, opening a shipping company in Shanghai, or sending people to Liaodong to negotiate business with the Manchus... each and every one concealed enormous ambition. Like a master strategist, they'd quietly placed piece after piece on the board.

So when Gu Baocheng's urgent letter arrived saying the Australians were actively preparing for war and might likely land on the mainland—followed by news of Guangdong's fall—Li Luoyou wasn't surprised at all. It was expected.

Just as Gu Baocheng had warned: What difference would it make if the court knew? Just a few days' earlier alarm! The outcome wouldn't change at all.

"How could a golden-scaled creature remain in a pond? Once meeting wind and clouds, it transforms into a dragon..." Li Luoyou murmured. This "golden scale" of mysterious origins was about to become a dragon. And the "wind and clouds" filling the sky were precisely the deteriorating national situation.

Li Luoyou had long since lost heart regarding the Great Ming. These years' changes in court politics made him increasingly despairing. He was no longer that middle-aged man who'd searched everywhere for new technology, hoping to refresh military equipment, restore the Ming, and recover lost territories. But to pledge allegiance to another master—he truly couldn't respect anyone.
