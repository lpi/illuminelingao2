# Chapter 2738: The Capital (Part 94)

Those afflicted with hypertension particularly despised noise. It made perfect sense that he would seclude himself here year-round, seeking peace and quiet. Moreover, his symptoms had grown quite severe of late—winter always sent blood pressure climbing.

"Mister Wu, deliver these two gifts ahead of schedule. Be sure to explain the medication instructions to the steward."

"Master..."

A maid's voice drifted softly from beyond the curtain.

Though his head felt ready to split and waves of pain pulsed at his temples, Li Luoyou responded, "What is it?"

"Grand Manager Leng has sent someone bearing gifts."

A nameless fury surged straight to his brain, nearly causing him to erupt.

But he remembered the physicians' warnings to "calm his mind and spirit" and avoid anger, lest he suffer a sudden stroke—once paralyzed, it would mean death or disability.

Death held no terror for him. He was approaching sixty, had experienced all that life offered. Though regrets were inevitable, his had been a rich and colorful existence. But disability would leave him at the mercy of others.

To fall from powerful patriarch commanding absolute authority to helpless cripple subject to others' whims—setting aside the physical torment, the mental anguish alone was intolerable.

"If there are gifts, let there be gifts. Give them to the Madam." Though he held his temper, he had already decided: if this girl had come of her own initiative to report, twenty strokes of the board awaited her.

Though household rules forbade punishing servants before the fifteenth of the first month, this was the separate residence, not the main estate. Here, he could do as he pleased.

Perhaps sensing the board's approach, the maid's voice trembled: "It was... the Madam who instructed me to report. She said two of the items are medicines, both suited to the Master's ailment."

"Nonsense." Li Luoyou said impatiently. "I've suffered this condition for years and consumed countless medicines. This Leng Ningyun is no Hua Tuo reborn—what miracle cure could he possibly possess?"

"The Madam says Manager Leng claims the medicine is most efficacious, works immediately, and it's a Nanyang product..."

"Nanyang goods" had become the capital's euphemism for "Australian goods." Ever since the Kun invaded Liangguang, the capital's merchants avoided saying "Australian goods." "Kun goods" was even more taboo.

Manager Leng sending Nanyang goods was hardly unusual—he was one of the Kun himself. As for whether he was a counterfeit or genuine one, Mister Li cared not.

Australian goods, whether gifted or purchased, while not exactly "piling mountain-high," were hardly rare to him. Speaking of medicines, he'd encountered some as well, including several "peace medicines" now fashionable in the capital—things like "Zhuge's March Powder" and "Plague-Avoiding Powder."

The most renowned was probably the Anti-Malaria Pill. He'd seen it in Guangzhou and been astounded. But the Australians themselves appeared to possess very few, and it was never sold. Only through significant connections could one obtain a handful of pills. Yet once taken, the effects were immediate.

As for the "Stove-Stone Powder" and other "Australian wonder drugs" sold throughout the capital and Jiangnan in recent years, Li Luoyou remained skeptical despite their sterling reputations. Gu Baocheng, who wrote monthly letters, had never once mentioned these medicines. For years, he'd tasked Gu Baocheng with watching for Australian medicines in Lingao that might treat his "head wind."

Now that Leng Ningyun had sent medicine for "head wind," he couldn't help feeling half-suspicious, half-hopeful.

However, since Leng Ningyun was a genuine member of the Kun who now sought his assistance, he presumably wouldn't send counterfeit medicine.

This piqued his interest. His head seemed less painful too. He immediately commanded:

"Dress me!"

With the maids' assistance, he donned casual robes and proceeded to the bright reception room beyond.

This "Quick Snow Pavilion" was where Li Luoyou specifically spent winters at Madam Qiao's residence. Though called a "pavilion," it was in fact a small courtyard comprising three bright rooms and two dark chambers. Every room contained hidden fire dragons—heated channels built into the walls. In winter, once the fires were lit, the rooms felt like spring. During the cold months, he and Madam Qiao lived and entertained guests here.

"Master!" Upon seeing his approach, Madam Qiao immediately rose and greeted him with a curtsy. She had been with Li Luoyou for over twenty years and had borne him children. By rights, she was a "person of merit" in the Li household and could afford some informality. Yet in Li Luoyou's presence, her manners remained impeccable, never daring the slightest negligence.

Observing Li Luoyou's pained expression and unsteady steps, she quickly replaced the maid in supporting him, calling out, "Bring the Nanyang rattan chair!"

The "Nanyang rattan chair" was what the old timeline termed a "rattan armchair with backrest." Though crafted using traditional Chinese rattan techniques, its design was actually modeled on late Qing and early Republic Western high-backed chairs—quite ergonomic. The high back and slightly tilted curved lumbar support, combined with the rattan bamboo's natural elasticity, could fully support the human torso. It was especially suitable for weakened patients like Li Luoyou.

This particular chair was fashioned from the finest Lingao red-white rattan, with excellent materials and exquisite craftsmanship. Naturally, the price was considerable. Li Luoyou settled into it and couldn't help sighing with relief. He said softly, "What medicine has this Manager Leng sent that you felt compelled to make such a fuss?"

"I wouldn't dare disturb the Master carelessly. It's just that Mister Wu, who brought the gifts, said these two medicines would greatly benefit the Master's condition, with immediate effect. That's why..."

"Oh." Li Luoyou said noncommittally. He was too weary to speak further, merely gesturing toward the table beside him.

Madam Qiao quickly brought over the four gift items from Leng Ningyun. Li Luoyou had no interest in examining them closely. He merely picked up the two medicines and gave them a cursory inspection.

"This is Liver-Soothing Pill. Mister Wu instructed: twice daily, one pill each time. Effects are immediate. However, it shouldn't be stopped. He has sent a three-month supply."

Li Luoyou nodded weakly. "Immediate effect? Is this some immortal elixir?"

Madam Qiao dared not respond. Seeing no further reaction from him, she continued: "This bottle is Musk Heart-Protecting Elixir. Mister Wu said that since the Master suffers from head wind, he likely also experiences heart pain and palpitations. When an attack occurs, one should immediately dissolve a pill beneath the tongue for relief. Alternatively, take one pill daily for preventive care."

"Take one of each and dissolve them in water," he ordered.

Having been ill for so long, he had become something of a physician himself and had researched various medicines and pharmacology extensively. Besides Suhexiang Decoction and various prescriptions over the years, he had also used a "Pain-Relieving Pill"—another new medicine marketed as an "Australian drug." Very effective. But he knew its secret.

"Though this substance relieves pain effectively, it is actually opium," he had warned his family. "Taking too much creates addiction. The body becomes weak and listless—one becomes a complete wreck!"

A maid presented two small dishes and a pair of silver chopsticks. He raised a dish, lightly sniffed the medicine's scent, used the chopsticks to probe the residue, and touched the tip of his tongue to it.

After a long pause, he said, "Very well. Let us try one dose."

To his surprise, within just one hour of taking the medicine, the swelling and pain in his head gradually subsided. The dizziness faded as well.

Previously, although Pain-Relieving Pills could stop the pain, nothing could dispel the dizziness.

Once comfortable, his appetite improved. Seeing this, Madam Qiao was overjoyed. She ordered light porridge and side dishes brought and personally served him his meal.

With his stomach satisfied, weariness followed. These past days, his sleep had been hazy—half-dreaming, half-waking, plagued by nightmares of perilous situations. He always woke exhausted. Now, as drowsiness descended, Madam Qiao immediately prepared bedding in the warm alcove for him to rest.

He slept until dusk approached. When Li Luoyou rose, he felt clear-headed and keen-eyed. His previously exhausted body brimmed with energy.

Such excellent condition had been rare in recent years. Li Luoyou couldn't help marveling to himself: The Australians truly were remarkable!

Feeling well, even his demeanor toward Madam Qiao, the maids, and servants softened considerably. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. The residence finally took on something of the relaxed, joyful atmosphere befitting the New Year.

But Li Luoyou did not share Madam Qiao's ease. He examined Leng Ningyun's gifts again with care. Both were valuable and exceedingly thoughtful—clearly intended to curry his favor.

Since Leng Ningyun's arrival in the capital several years ago, though business relations meant frequent dealings between Liaohai Trading and Delong, he personally had maintained minimal contact with Leng Ningyun. Besides their first meeting when Leng came to the capital, there had been no private interactions. Yet Leng Ningyun's attitude remained quite proactive—visiting cards and greetings at the three major festivals, gifts and condolences for any weddings or funerals.

His cold treatment of Leng Ningyun stemmed not from simple "avoidance" or lingering resentment over the refused artillery sale years ago. Rather, ever since the burning of the Five Rams Post Station, he had sensed the truth: the Kun were not creatures content to remain in a pond.

They were nothing like the Portuguese, who occupied Macau and were satisfied with a place to settle and conduct trade. The Kun harbored "grand designs."

This barely concealed ambition had reached its apex before Liangguang fell. Through his commercial network, he had gleaned some knowledge of the Kun's activities over the years. Whether meddling in Shandong's unrest, destroying the Zheng Zhilong faction, forcing Liu Xiang's surrender, opening a shipping company in Shanghai, or dispatching envoys to Liaodong to negotiate business with the Manchus—each and every move concealed enormous ambition. Like master strategists, they had quietly placed piece after piece upon the board.

So when Gu Baocheng's urgent letter arrived warning that the Australians were actively preparing for war and would likely land on the mainland—followed by news of Guangdong's fall—Li Luoyou felt no surprise whatsoever. It had been expected.

Just as Gu Baocheng had warned: What difference would it make if the court knew? A few days' earlier alarm at most! The outcome wouldn't change in the slightest.

"How could a golden-scaled creature remain in a pond? Once meeting wind and clouds, it transforms into a dragon..." Li Luoyou murmured. This "golden scale" of mysterious origins was on the verge of becoming a dragon. And the "wind and clouds" filling the sky were precisely the deteriorating national situation.

Li Luoyou had long since lost heart regarding the Great Ming. The political shifts at court over these years had left him increasingly despairing. He was no longer that middle-aged man who had searched everywhere for new technology, hoping to refresh military equipment, restore the Ming, and recover lost territories. But to pledge allegiance to another master—he truly could not bring himself to respect anyone.
