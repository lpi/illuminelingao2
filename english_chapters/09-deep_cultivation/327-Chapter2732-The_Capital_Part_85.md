# Chapter 2732: The Capital (Part 85)

Winter nights were long. Even after the fifth watch, there was no dawn light. Only as the Hour of the Dragon (7-9 AM) approached did a faint glow appear in the east.

Li Rufeng turned to Little Bazi. "Shortly, you stay with me. Don't go charging in alone!"

Little Bazi nodded. His face was solemn, with a trace of unease in his eyes.

"What? Scared?"

Little Bazi swallowed. "No!"

By now, visibility was clear. The escort masters ambushed outside the temple had no cover. There was no time to waste. Li Rufeng immediately drew his bow, nocked an arrow, and shot toward the sky.

The whistling arrow flew into the air, its piercing shriek cutting through the winter morning.

The escort masters, already in position, leaped up. Each wielded a makeshift wooden staff and charged toward Ningyou Temple.

At the mountain gate and on the main hall roof, shrill bamboo whistles sounded simultaneously. Li Rufeng shouted, "Hurry!" A scream came from the gate tower; one man, struck by an arrow, fell and crashed heavily in front of them.

The mountain gate was surrounded. The escort masters worked in pairs: one pushed with a wooden pole from behind, the other relay-jumped off the wall. In two or three moves, they were atop the gate tower. Immediately, the sounds of clashing blades rang out behind the gate—shouts, screams of those struck... In moments, the mountain gate was wide open. Li Rufeng led his men pouring through.

Three or four bodies lay in the front courtyard. One man, already wounded, struggled at the base of a wall.

"Two men hold the mountain gate; the rest charge in!" He raised his saber, and the escort masters eagerly pressed forward toward the main hall.

Chen Cui was the first to climb onto the main hall roof, but Liu Chang's wolf-fang arrows were even faster. One sentry drew his blade to fight, only to be shot down immediately, rolling along the eaves and crashing to the ground. Another had been about to meet the attacker with his sword, but now suddenly lost courage and retreated toward the corner of the roof. Chen Cui ran across the rooftop as if on flat ground. In a few steps, he caught up and swung his saber, instantly severing the sentry's lower leg. The man screamed and tumbled down, leaving a long trail of blood on the roof tiles.

Liu Chang was now on the roof too. With his carved bow and a quiver of arrows, he took only a moment to find his bearings. He crouched down, waved his bow with his left hand, brushed arrows with his right. Where the bowstring sang, arrows flew like meteors. In an instant, he'd shot twelve wolf-fang arrows.

Over a dozen people had gathered in the rear courtyard. But Liu Chang's twelve arrows fell like a meteor shower. Arrows arrived first; the twang of the bowstring and the whistle of arrows through the air followed. Four men fell in rapid succession. Amid screams and cries, the others scattered, only to be caught in a pincer attack by escort masters led by Sun Changtou who had stormed in through the rear gate. Sabers chopped, spears thrust, and all were killed.

Li Rufeng led his escort masters in a room-by-room search. Several rooms still had remnants of bandits making last stands. Each room they burst into brought more clashing of blades. They fought their way to the second room at the east end. Three bandits desperately resisted on the corridor. Even Sun Changtou, with his great strength and expertise at breaching doors, was entangled and couldn't break free. Li Rufeng knew something was amiss in that room. Taking advantage of the melee in the corridor, he slipped past under the eaves with Little Bazi and burst through the door.

The room was dim, making it hard to see. The moment he entered, he felt a fierce rush of wind toward his face. Li Rufeng quickly dodged—a sleeve arrow thudded straight into the door. Li Rufeng, gauging by the sound and position, backhanded a slash. He felt his blade meet resistance, then a hot, sweet-smelling liquid sprayed onto his hand. A scream followed.

He blinked rapidly four or five times. On the *kang* (heated bed platform) inside, a figure was curled up. The features matched Leng Ningyun. He shouted, "Manager Leng!"

The person on the *kang* stirred and turned toward him. Li Rufeng was overjoyed and was about to leap onto the platform when someone suddenly emerged from the corner of the room. With a sinister laugh, he said, "The 'God of Wealth' I brought—no one's taking him!" and thrust his sword at Leng Ningyun.

Li Rufeng was horrified. The room was cramped; if he struck, he had no room to maneuver. Just as cold sweat broke out, a dark shadow darted from beside him, blocking the attacker and parrying with a blade. Looking closely, it was Little Bazi.

But the enemy's force was overwhelming. Though Little Bazi had blocked the sword, he couldn't withstand the momentum. Li Rufeng watched helplessly as the sword point plunged into Little Bazi's chest.

"Little Bazi!" Li Rufeng cried out. He rushed forward and forced the enemy back with a slash. Little Bazi's chest was gushing blood; he collapsed instantly beside the *kang*. There was no time for rescue—the enemy was already slashing horizontally again. Li Rufeng barely parried in time. He was startled: this man's martial arts were no less than his own.

He shouted, "Tough target!" to call for reinforcements. This was no place for a fair duel. He had to protect Leng Ningyun, which put him at a disadvantage in the fight.

Fortunately, the enemy had no desire to linger. Seeing Li Rufeng dared not close in, he kicked open the window lattice and leaped out. Immediately, shouts and the sounds of fierce blade clashing came from outside.

Li Rufeng had no time to join the melee. He hurried to look at the *kang*. It was indeed Leng Ningyun. He wore an ill-fitting, slightly baggy cotton robe. His hair was somewhat disheveled, but otherwise he seemed clean. Yet he had no spirit at all—a blank face, reclining on the bedding. Even the intense fighting seemed not to interest him.

Li Rufeng knew he had probably been given some drug that weakened the body and dulled the mind. Fortunately, the drug wouldn't be fatal. He quickly propped up Little Bazi. Seeing he was still breathing, he tore open the shirt on his chest and poured the wound medicine he always carried onto the injury. The wound wasn't bleeding much, but foam was coming out. His heart tightened.

During his training in Lingao, he'd learned that chest wounds either ruptured the heart—instant death—or damaged the lungs, which was equally dangerous without prompt treatment.

Right now, he had no way to save him. And the fighting outside continued. He could only place Little Bazi on the *kang* for now and rush out with his blade.

Outside was chaos. Li Rufeng charged out to see the man in black had already wounded two more people and nearly broken through. But Sun Changtou had entangled him, and the two were locked in combat. After just three or five exchanges, the man in black launched several aggressive thrusts, actually forcing Sun Changtou back. With a leap, he was already atop the wall, and in an instant had vaulted over.

"Chase!"

Before Li Rufeng's words had faded, the whistle of arrows filled the air, followed by heavy thuds of falling. The escort masters gave chase. Moments later, Sun Changtou dragged the man back: one wolf-fang arrow through the spine, another in the lower leg.

The arrow in the back was unmistakably Liu Chang's work. He'd long heard of that man's fine archery—this was the first time he'd seen his true skill.

"He's still alive..."

"Bandage him and take him!"

By now, the fighting inside the temple was dying down. Escort masters were searching everywhere. Li Rufeng leaned against a corridor pillar, gasping for breath as if all strength had left him. The others came to fight; only he bore the weight of a thousand *jin*. If they hadn't found Senator Leng today, or if something had gone wrong, he would have had to take his own life in atonement.

A lead escort master came to report that the temple battle was over and all areas had been searched.

"...Seventeen bandits killed, five captured alive—two of them women. Also three Daoists from the temple, all seized."

"How many of ours?"

"Two killed, nine wounded..." He hesitated. "And Little Bazi, I'm afraid... he won't make it."

Li Rufeng nodded. Since eating this bowl of rice, he'd experienced the deaths of many comrades. His heart had long grown hard. But this boy's fate touched him.

"As long as he hasn't stopped breathing, bandage him." He ordered, "Have everyone search this place thoroughly—especially documents. Pack everything and take it. Our people, dead or alive, all come with us. Those who can't walk ride horses or mules. Prisoners who can walk, bring them; those who can't, kill them." He looked at the sky—already fully bright. "We shouldn't stay long."

"What about the bodies here..."

"Don't worry about them. Someone will take care of it." Li Rufeng stretched his back.

Leaving Nanyuan, Li Rufeng didn't go straight back to the bureau, nor did he follow the main road east. Instead, he took the western route. About ten *li* away was a mule-and-horse inn belonging to Heliansheng in a market town. They rested there, treating the wounded. He also ordered the kitchen to prepare mung bean and licorice soup. Once it was ready, he personally carried a bowl to Leng Ningyun's room.

"Chief, this is mung bean and licorice soup. It clears heat and detoxifies. Please drink a bowl; it will calm and soothe you. Here's also a Niuhuang Qingxin pill—take it after you've had some porridge later."

This wasn't sycophancy but the escort bureau's experience in rescuing hostages.

Most rescued "tickets" had suffered greatly. Even if treated well during captivity, they were still terrified for days on end. Suddenly rescued, their emotions were bound to fluctuate violently—going mad, sudden death, acute illness... all were common. So escort bureaus prepared medicines to calm nerves and reduce internal heat.

Leng Ningyun recognized Li Rufeng. He nodded slightly. "Thank you for your trouble!"

"I wouldn't dare claim credit, Chief. Your ordeal is also my failing." Li Rufeng was very humble, showing no pride. "This is just my small atonement."

"You people from the escort bureau are all quite articulate." Leng Ningyun forced a smile. "Last night, these bandits gave me something. My body is weak, and my mind drifts in and out of clarity. Just now on the road, the cool wind actually made me feel better."

"Chief, don't worry. It's just an anesthetic the bandits commonly use. Once the effect wears off, you'll be fine."

Li Rufeng thought: That was close! The temple had horses, mules, and even a mule sedan. They'd given Leng Ningyun drugs beforehand. If he'd been a step late, the Chief would have been moved today. Not only would he have come up empty, but finding him again would have been virtually impossible.

Seeing Leng Ningyun had nothing more to say, he asked, "Are there any further orders, Chief..."

"Send someone immediately with a letter to Delong. Notify Wu Kaidi: I've escaped danger. Have him make preparations."

"Yes, I'll see to it immediately."

"Also, find someone to tell me in detail everything that's happened during this time. I need to get my bearings..."
