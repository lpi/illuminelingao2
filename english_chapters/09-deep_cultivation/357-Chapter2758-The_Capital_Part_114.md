# Chapter 2758: The Capital (Part 114)

"So we must also focus on exporting culture—yes, culture!" Leng Ningyun grew more animated as he spoke. "And scientific knowledge! The Senate's technology exports remain far too conservative. They send either purely theoretical foundations or completely obsolete material. The former is like Kangxi studying mathematics—merely a 'parlor trick' for wealthy dilettantes to show off. The latter can turn a profit, certainly, but anyone with real expertise sees through its superficiality."

"This trip back has really broadened your thinking," Xu Ke remarked with a hint of amusement.

"Hardly. I've spent years contemplating how to transform traditional society. We used to chat idly on the Senate forums without ever hitting the mark. The truth is, we Chinese are fundamentally pragmatic. Technology or culture—we judge everything by its output. 'Black cat or white cat, the one that catches mice is a good cat.' If you want to spread technology and culture, you must first demonstrate that your methods are profitable."

"But won't that cause everyone to neglect the basic disciplines?"

Leng Ningyun paused, then burst into hearty laughter. "This is the Great Ming in 1637. Most common people cannot even fill their bellies. When they lie down at night, they have no certainty they'll survive until morning. Even officials—those with any clarity of mind who can read the times—are consumed with anxiety, desperately seeking ways to save the nation from collapse. Asking them to study fundamental science? You might as well demand the impossible."

"But if you want ideas to spread, you need people willing to spread them for you..."

"That, naturally, must be won on the battlefield." Leng Ningyun leaned back. "A few days ago I revisited the history of the late Qing. The patterns of a dynasty's final years are remarkably familiar. The Qing government's attitude toward foreign culture and technology evolved from the shock and rejection of the First Opium War, through the learning and adaptation following the Second Opium War, and finally into the Self-Strengthening Movement. These things follow a process."

"So you're saying another war will push the Great Ming to launch its own 'Kun-Strengthening Movement'?"

"Precisely. The court and the opposition both contain many people of insight. I've spent enough time in the Capital to understand that the late Ming is far less rigid and conservative than the late Qing. Social thought here is considerably more dynamic. Yes, there are plenty of pedantic, hidebound, isolationist scholar-bureaucrats—but there are also many with broad learning and open minds." Leng Ningyun continued, "People like Li Luoyou have grown more numerous in recent years. Those with simpler ideas merely want to acquire Kun firearms and Kun artillery, hoping to master Kun techniques in order to control the Kun. Those with deeper insight have already begun to grasp our advantages in technology, institutions, and culture..."

"Plenty of people recognize our advantages. Take Liang Cunhou—by all logic, he should understand best of all. Yet he's become the foremost anti-Kun element, vigorously promoting anti-Kun and restore-Ming sentiment throughout Guangzhou City..."

"Seeing clearly is not the same as accepting. Every system has its martyrs. Liang Cunhou simply clings to the notion of the Great Defense between Hua and Yi (*Hua Yi Da Fang*) and refuses to yield. If you study late Qing history, you'll find the Qingstream conservative faction opposing Westernization never disappeared. Conservative versus progressive—this is an eternal struggle."

"Alright, enough dialectics." Xu Ke's interest was piqued. "What are you actually planning to do?"

"At present, nothing overt. Zhao Yingong's approach was too flamboyant, too conspicuous. His results were impressive, but he relied entirely on the Special Investigation Team to back him and prevent disaster. Here in the Capital, I dare not attempt anything so bold." Leng Ningyun shook his head. "My view is that the Senate must eventually establish Tianjin as an open port. In recent years, we've developed north-south maritime transport, and Tianjin Wei has grown far more prosperous than before. It could serve as a crucial entry point for our new culture and new institutions in the future."

"Once the Third Anti-Encirclement Campaign ends in victory, you'll be able to stir things up in the Capital."

"Stirring things up might be possible, but to operate like Zhao Yingong? I lack the nerve." Leng Ningyun laughed. "Unless the Senior Grand Secretary were Wang Luobin, the Seal-holding Eunuch of the Directorate of Ceremonial were Xiao Zishan, and the Admiral of the Eastern Depot were Ma Qianzhu..."

The two erupted in laughter. As the mirth subsided, Leng Ningyun said, "It's not quite true that nothing can be done. If the Third Anti-Encirclement Campaign produces a situation highly favorable to us, I want to formally invest in running a newspaper. The Capital already has various Capital Gazettes (*Dichao*) and tabloids. Some are propaganda materials transported through Shanhai Five Routes channels. They circulate widely here—people in every teahouse pass them around. But that's still not the same as a proper newspaper."

"Ambitious! You're planning to steal Dingding's livelihood."

"If he's willing to come to the Capital and run a newspaper, I'd welcome him. Professional talent still depends on his system, after all." Leng Ningyun smiled. "Reform, modernization, revolution—none can succeed without the catalytic power of news media. At the very least, there's an enlightening effect. If we actually launch it, circulation won't be a problem. Dingding will owe me a silk banner."

Xu Ke appreciated his humorous, forthright manner. Since they had arrived at this topic, he took the opportunity to discuss the future positioning of the Beijing Station.

"Before I came, Center and I discussed the Beijing Station's positioning. After deliberation, we concluded that your previous balance of commerce and intelligence was actually somewhat risky—your energy couldn't cover both adequately. So after further discussion, we decided you should concentrate your primary efforts on managing business and collecting open intelligence, drawing a clear line with clandestine operations. This applies not just to Delong but to all Shanhai Five Routes establishments."

Leng Ningyun nodded. "I agree that's more appropriate."

"Exactly. Secret intelligence and covert operations belong to specialized intelligence agencies. The Shanhai Five Routes are geese that lay golden eggs—risking them on dangerous ventures is simply not worth it." Xu Ke continued, "The Foreign Intelligence Bureau will establish a separate station in the Capital. You'll have no lateral contact with them, only vertical reporting lines."

"Good." Leng Ningyun suddenly remembered something. "What about He Lian Sheng?"

"They'll continue their traditional work—security operations. I discussed it with Jiang Shan as well. It's inappropriate to involve He Lian Sheng in too many clandestine operations. First, it conflicts with the moral values of that group. Second, the people in the bodyguard agency are too mixed."

Yang Tianliang had been unable to think of food or drink for days, not even bothering to appear at his place of employment.

His official position was Manager of the Sutra Factory (*Jingchang Zhangsi*)—a respectable achievement within the eunuch hierarchy. But this position fell far short of satisfying his ambitions.

As its name suggested, the Sutra Factory was where books were carved and printed within the Royal Great Within. It primarily produced classics, histories, philosophical works, literary collections, and Buddhist and Daoist scriptures. Though administratively it fell under the Directorate of Ceremonial—the most prominent of the Twenty-Four Yamen—serving as a managing eunuch there conferred no real power.

Naturally, there were customary fees and established earnings, but these were fixed amounts that could not increase. As for making extra money, options were limited to reselling inventory books and printing plates. Yang Tianliang disdained such labor-intensive petty gains.

Yet his adoptive father's influence extended no further than this. When the Nine Thousand Years held power, they had barely managed to keep even this position. Had Yang Gonggong not reacted swiftly and bribed the eunuch party members generously, father and son would likely have been swept out long ago.

After the current Emperor assumed the throne, Yang Gonggong finally secured the position of Seal-holding Eunuch of the Bell and Drum Division through old connections. But for Yang Tianliang to advance any further seemed as difficult as ascending to heaven.

He had maneuvered through various channels and finally secured Wang Zhixin's promise. A bright path had opened before him at last.

However, twenty thousand taels of silver now stood as an obstacle. He had assumed his adoptive father would generously open his purse for the sake of his future. Instead, he received only a harsh reprimand, told to "abandon these delusions" and that "honest work is the proper path."

Resentment festered in Yang Tianliang's heart. The rift between father and son had widened over several years. From the initial matter of the Gao family silver to the recent series of incidents where his adoptive father had forbidden him from dealing with Delong, their bond had gradually eroded. He had believed that in a matter so crucial to his future, his adoptive father would assist him just this once. He never expected such decisive rejection.

And so he thought of Liu Sha, hoping to ask whether there might be opportunities to make money. During their conversation, he mentioned that Yang Gonggong had deposited ten thousand taels with Delong. Liu Sha expressed keen interest.

His adoptive father's refusal to give him money was unkind. Delong's Shopkeeper Leng refusing to lend was unjust. The wealth of such unkind and unjust people deserved to be taken via the Way. Yang Tianliang and Liu Sha found themselves in instant agreement and set about plotting kidnapping and extortion.

This was not their first time engaging in the dirty business of "Inviting the God of Wealth." But since it involved Yang Gonggong, and Leng Ningyun was a figure of some standing in the Capital, even someone as bold as Yang Tianliang had to weigh the risks. Liu Sha, however, patted his chest and told him not to worry: "When the sky falls, there's someone tall enough to hold it up."

Yang Tianliang didn't know who this "tall person" was. But seeing Liu Sha's confidence, he naturally believed him. After plotting in secret, the two recruited several accomplices and prepared Ningyou Temple in the West Garden as a place to hide their hostage.

Their scheming proceeded smoothly. Leng Ningyun was successfully "invited," and all that remained was waiting for the silver. Ten thousand taels was certainly a brazen demand, but Delong's coffers held exactly that amount.

During those days, Yang Tianliang walked with a spring in his step. In his mind, he calculated repeatedly: once the silver was in hand, Yang Gonggong would conveniently "die of sudden illness," he would formally enter the Directorate of Imperial Horses to serve, and his adoptive father's decades of savings would also fall to him. He didn't know the exact sum, but it had to be at least seventy or eighty thousand taels.

Yet all his careful calculations came to nothing. Not only was Ningyou Temple raided and Leng Ningyun rescued, but Liu Sha had vanished entirely. He sent a junior eunuch to Tongzhou to contact Liu Sha, but days of waiting at "Hou Garden" yielded no meeting.

"Could Liu Sha have sold me out?!" Yang Tianliang grew alarmed. But upon reflection, it seemed illogical. What would Liu Sha gain by betraying him?

What worried him most was Yang Gonggong's reaction. If his adoptive father discovered the plot against him, his influence within the palace could easily cost Yang Tianliang his position and make his life miserable. And seeing that he couldn't produce the money, Wang Zhixin would cast him aside like rubbish.

Just as he drifted through his days in uneasy confusion, a junior eunuch suddenly arrived with a message: Yang Gonggong had summoned him.
