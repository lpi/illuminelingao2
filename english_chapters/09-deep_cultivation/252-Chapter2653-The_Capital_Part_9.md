# Chapter 2653: The Capital (Part 9)

Liao Sanniang said again, "But if you talk about leaving, where can you go? Defect to the Great Ming? The Senate's ambition to conquer the deer is clear. Only Lord Chongzhen in this Beijing city and the various cabinet ministers and great eunuchs are still pretending to be confused. Within a few years, the Great Song's Imperial Guard will sweep across the world. The change of dynasty is right before our eyes."

Liao Sanniang paused briefly and said coldly, "If you forsake the light to turn to the darkness at this time, can the Great Ming protect you? Or do you want to roll up Delong's silver and retreat to the forests? You must know, this sky is the Senate's sky, and this earth is the Senate's earth. When the world is unified, although the sky is vast, there will be no hiding place for traitors; although the earth is wide, there will be no hole for villains to shrink their heads into. Although the Senate is kindhearted and does not practice the calamity of implicating entire clans, the relatives and families of everyone here are in Guangzhou Prefecture. At that time, your parents, wives, and children will all be considered rebels' families. How rebels' families are treated, everyone has seen with their own eyes when in Guangzhou—they cannot enter schools, cannot enter factories to work, and cannot take civil service examinations. As long as the Great Song's national destiny lasts, they will bear the status of rebels' families for that long. Your children will be slaves and servants for generations, and your descendants will be bandits and prostitutes for generations, shaming your ancestors underground and leaving a bad name for a thousand years."

After saying this, she pursed her lips and smiled. "Taking ten thousand steps back, even if the Great Song doesn't pursue you, you are people coming out of Delong. Who doesn't know you are a piece of fat meat? Who doesn't want to take a bite? Not to mention those parasites in the government, even if you have brothers with whom you share life and death, I'm afraid with shining white silver in front of them, you won't be able to be brothers anymore."

Liao Sanniang continued, "The Beijing Station is not Master Leng's personal Beijing Station. If Master Leng is not here, will we stop working? Some people think that since Master Leng is not here now and cannot be rescued, the Beijing Station is about to collapse, and the Great Ming's Factory and Guard are about to rush in to arrest people, and everyone will immediately be cut into a thousand pieces. Some people are afraid. But if you are afraid, can this matter pass? It won't pass. This is a matter. Since it is a matter, it must be handled."

Liao Sanniang's tone became severe as she added, "Fortune relies on misfortune; misfortune hides fortune. When extreme adversity is reached, prosperity comes. Chairman Wen taught us: Crisis, *weiji*, means where there is danger (*wei*), there is opportunity (*ji*). Handling matters depends on nothing more than men and money. We don't have many men, but we have plenty of money. There is still much to catch. Master Leng is absent for a short time. At this critical moment when people's minds are wavering, we must twist into a single rope and work together in harmony. Alive, we are loyal ministers of the Great Song; dead, we are martyrs of the new dynasty. Bearing the danger of one body to gamble for the fortune and salary of ten thousand generations of descendants."

At this moment, Li Rufeng also stood up and said, "Sanniangzi sees things clearly. Today, to use Senator Leng's words, is called unifying thoughts and condensing strength. No matter what different thoughts everyone harbored before, they are all turned over in this one page. But from now on, if anyone is half-hearted again, Li One-certain may recognize him, but the knife in my hand may not. Having been dispatched outside for a long time, I fear many people have forgotten that behind the Beijing Station is the Senate."

Liao Sanniang took over the conversation and said to everyone, "Qiwei has a secret box for message transmission. Do not think that by selling others, you can still keep yourself clean."

Although the people present did not speak, their hearts had long been numb with shock. Moreover, what they feared most now was disintegration. It was best that someone was willing to take the lead to handle things. Everyone felt they had some backbone and became less panicked and uneasy.

Wu Kaidi said, "The urgent task is to arrange Delong's business properly."

Once Leng Ningyun's case came out, Shuntian Prefecture would inevitably summon witnesses to the yamen for questioning. The trial of such a case would often take several months. Moreover, the yamen detaining and summoning witnesses followed the same logic as bandits "inviting the God of Wealth"—the more people they could get into the detention center, the better. Without advance preparation, Delong's business backbone would fearfully be caught in one net. Then there would be no need to do business anymore.

"...The bank's business has not been as good as in previous years, but there are still many deposits and remittances," Wu Kaidi weighed his words and said. "If there are problems with these businesses, not only will the bank be in imminent danger, but the Beijing Station will also lose the capital to establish a foothold. So our first task is to maintain the bank's business."

Wu Kaidi did not come from a banking business background, but he had followed Leng Ningyun for a long time, so he knew the situation of the bank like the back of his hand.

"...Although the bank's business is personally managed by the Master and I haven't seen the account books, I probably know about it. There are no problems with receipts, payments, and remittances. As long as no one loots a burning house, even if the Master is not here, this part can maintain the current situation. We will temporarily take no action and do business as usual."

However, Assistant Manager Xiao from just now said, "Mister Wu! What you said is correct, but there is one thing: our bank does credit business. Now that there is no news of Master Leng, without needing anyone to loot a burning house, news of Delong's instability will immediately spread in the market. When people come to withdraw money and cause a run, trouble will happen immediately! If someone fans the flames and drops stones on someone who has fallen down a well, the bank will have to close in three to five days!"

The deposits attracted by the bank could not "make money from money"; they relied entirely on lending out to earn the interest spread. This was the oldest and most essential "business" of the banking industry. Delong was no exception. The hundreds of thousands of taels of silver deposits it absorbed in the capital also had to rely on lending to earn interest.

In the 17th century, the industry and commerce in Beijing and its surrounding areas were actually very backward, and there were no commercial activities that required a massive flow of funds. The accumulation of large amounts of capital in the capital was purely due to its status as the capital. But this also meant that the funds absorbed from all over the country had no investment channels locally.

In the capital, although there were "Beijing Loans"—loans to officials assuming office in the localities—which claimed to make huge profits with small capital, the amount was not large. The real large-scale commercial loans were actually only the Mongolian business outside the pass. Not only was the capital requirement large, but the profits were also incomparably rich.

The Mongolian business was customarily done by Shanxi people, but much of the capital came from the capital city, and it had always been monopolized by the "Shanxi Houses." As a latecomer, Delong, under Leng Ningyun, had made many attempts but couldn't squeeze in—the solidity of regional groups was far from something an outsider like him could break.

Therefore, Delong's funds mainly went to three places: first, the trade with Korea in Tianjin, which also included transactions with the Manchus; second, the Shanghai Merchant Bureau's trade with Japan and the silk business in Zhejiang; third, direct remittance back to Guangzhou to be used in various investment and trade projects of the Planning Agency.

The profits from these three channels were all very generous, so Delong could pay interest comparable to the Shanxi Houses—Leng Ningyun did not use excessively high interest to attract savings, firstly because he thought it wasn't worth it, and secondly to avoid provoking the existing financial groups and making too many enemies.

Because all investment channels were in other places, the reserves in Delong's hands were very small. Leng Ningyun only kept a 12.5% deposit reserve in Delong. When the currency reform began in Guangzhou, Delong mobilized a large amount of silver from various places, and Delong's reserves once dropped to only 7-8%.

"...Just the interest, acceptances, and remittances to be paid out this month amount to almost thirty thousand Kuping taels." Assistant Manager Xiao looked troubled. "The ready silver in the vault is less than eighty thousand taels. If a run occurs, we can't even cope for three days!"

Wu Kaidi said, "Isn't this the meaning of everyone working together in harmony! I don't understand the ways of doing business, but since the Master is not here, we must think of every way to maintain this plate! As long as Delong can be maintained, it will more or less be making up for crimes with merits."

Liao Sanniang nodded. "Mister Wu makes sense. We are discussing methods, not pouring out bitter water. If there are difficulties, bring them out to discuss, but we also have to come up with methods. Do what we can."

Delong's Head Accountant coughed lightly. He was a middle-aged man, an old hand from the Guangzhou Station era who had been the chief accountant of the Purple Brand Account Room. He was familiar with both the Australian accounting system and the Great Ming's commercial bookkeeping. At this moment, he said in a low voice, "Assistant Manager Xiao is right. Once a run occurs, Delong will undoubtedly die. Delong is not well-received here. Taking advantage of our illness to take our life, the Shanxi Houses will drop stones on us ten to one. They will refuse to honor the notes we issued, while delaying the debts they owe us..."

"Then what should we do?" Wu Kaidi asked anxiously.

"Just by expanding reserves, we can't compete with the Shanxi Houses. Moreover, at this time, there is nowhere to transfer silver from. We are far from the Senate here, and transferring silver is not something that can be done in a day or two..."

Assistant Manager Xiao spread his hands. "Given the current situation, it's difficult! I think we should close the shop first, and everyone go out to hide for a while. As long as the door doesn't open and people can't be found, no one can come to make a run on us, right..." As he spoke, he saw Liao Sanniang's fierce gaze and couldn't help trembling in his heart, daring not speak further.

Another manager, Manager Wei, couldn't hold back anymore at this moment. "Master Xiao! This move of yours can't be said to be wrong, but if we hide, what if it causes a mob to storm the place? There have been repeated precedents for this. Leaving aside the silver, there are also..."

Delong contained not only a large amount of stored silver but also many Australian precious goods, various account books, and information collected over many years. These things could not see the light. If a mob attack was triggered, leading to the yamen sealing the place, these things would be exposed to broad daylight in an instant. Regardless of whether Leng Ningyun could return safely, the stronghold of Delong would be completely finished.

The Head Accountant said, "Hiding won't work; continuing to do business won't work either. This matter has to depend on Old Wu."

Wu Kaidi somewhat understood his idea. "You mean let the government seal the place..."

"It is best for Shuntian Prefecture to come forward, so Delong's business will naturally stop as a matter of course," the accountant said. "Only there is a degree to this; it can only be 'sealed,' not 'confiscated.' The key joint in this depends on you, Master Wu."

Everyone showed hesitation at this moment. If the shop was sealed, the run on the bank could indeed be avoided in the short term. But once sealed, they would become fish and meat on the chopping block. If someone had ulterior motives, they could easily use this to "raid and inspect." Moreover, even if the shop was briefly sealed, the impact on commercial reputation would be very great.

No one among the few people could make this decision. Wu Kaidi said, "I'd better go to the yamen first to think of a way and see if there is any method to compromise. To let Delong suspend business without using the name of sealing."
