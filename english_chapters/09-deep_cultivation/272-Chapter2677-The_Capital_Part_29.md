# Chapter 2677: The Capital (Part 29)

A few days after the fleet left Yangzhou, Jin Wenchi's forgery project was successfully completed. Several carefully crafted documents were placed on the table, making Wang Yehao click his tongue in wonder: "I didn't expect the Teacher to have such craftsmanship; it can be called divine workmanship and ghostly axe."

"The Master overpraises," Jin Wenchi said with his mouth, but his body was honest, proudly displaying his works to Wang Yehao. "This student's ancestors worked in the trade of mounting and rubbing inscriptions. Before studying for the exams, I also learned some superficial skills. This paper surface is pasted together from peeling and mounting old letters brought by the Master, so the signatures and seals are all authentic. The pasted seams are made into fold marks; non-experts cannot distinguish them. The handwriting of the document uses the method of tracing on stone; every character has an original source, only slightly connecting the strokes at the start and end."

Wang Yehao listened and praised: "The Teacher was truly an underutilized talent before."

"Making some documents is naturally not a problem. Only according to court statutes, the request of Dukes and Marquises for caring of parents concerns title inheritance. Documents should be in triplicate. Needless to say for the father and son, one copy must be kept in the official archives. Three copies of the document are done, but as for the matter of entering the archives, I wonder if the Master has a clever method?" Jin Wenchi threw out a thorny problem.

"Teacher need not worry about this matter; this Official has his own way. This time the Teacher has already performed a great merit." Wang Yehao wasn't too worried about this. With Fourth Uncle's connections and means, if even this little thing couldn't be done, how could he have mixed to his current position? After discussing the title inheritance with Mr. Zhou before, Wang Yehao had already let Liu Zhao use the Jinyiwei's secret line to send a flying pigeon letter to communicate with Fourth Uncle Wang Xiantong. Wang Xiantong agreed quite readily, and the reply had arrived the day before yesterday, so Wang Yehao had confidence in his heart at this moment.

"Just a trivial skill, not worth mentioning to the Master." Jin Wenchi expressed humility. "This student has had some doubts recently; I wonder if I should ask."

"You and I are master and staff, like one body. Teacher, ask without harm."

"Since receiving the Master's words, this student will be brusque. This student has always heard that those who undertake great matters plan for defeat before planning for victory. I wonder what chance of winning the Master has this time?"

Being asked this by Jin Wenchi, waves couldn't help rising in Wang Yehao's heart. Indeed, if the Sorcerer's prophecy was unreliable, he would undoubtedly die. But recent events made him feel he could gamble. After all, as long as he won the bet, the profit would be immeasurable. Wang Yehao thought for a while and felt it was better not to mention the matter of foreknowledge, to save explaining clearly: "This Official thinks that to bring order out of chaos, we need to gather people of insight from all over the court and the *Jianghu* to uphold righteousness together as assistance."

"What the Master says is very true!" Jin Wenchi expressed agreement. "Although I am untalented, I am willing to repay with my body and assist in the righteous act!"

"Although it is a righteous act, this matter still requires caution." Wang Yehao laughed once, as if thinking of something interesting. "This Official has an alias 'Stone Old Man' [*Shi Weng*]. When the Teacher acts, how about also temporarily hiding your name to avoid spreading it outside and causing trouble?"

"What the Master says is right." Jin Wenchi agreed. "Since the Master is 'Stone Old Man,' this student will call himself 'Jinshi' [Metal-Stone]."

"Good. Why not call yourself 'Jinshi Daoist'? Being a person outside the secular world makes it convenient to act." Wang Yehao said.

"All depends on the Master's arrangement!"

After arranging Jin Wenchi, Wang Yehao summoned the butler again and instructed him: "Let the boat travel slower; being steady is the key."

He intentionally set the date of arrival in the capital for early August. This would save the effort of dealing with the Eunuch Party due to the unclear situation after returning to the capital. If Mr. Zhou's prophecy came true and the new master ascended the throne, he could avoid many handles. If the prophecy failed, he had also made arrangements: as soon as Liu Zhao received the secret letter, he would silence the Hearthstone Daoist and his disciple, then kill Jin, Wei, and the two maids to eliminate future trouble.

After Jin Wenchi left, Wang Yehao gave two of the documents to Wang Liang and instructed him: "You take a small boat north immediately, bring more boatmen, travel day and night. You must deliver the documents personally into Fourth Uncle's hands."

"This small one goes right away!"

"Also, find a way to see if there are connections to Prince Xin's residence. There are always some little eunuchs mixing in the market; make more friends." He continued, "After getting familiar, try to connecting to Consort Tian's line, just saying we are old friends of her maiden family. Don't be stingy with silver; the silver in the residence can all be used, no upper limit this time."

"This small one understands." Hearing there was such a fat errand, joy appeared on Wang Liang's eyebrows.

"Must be fast!" Wang Yehao emphasized again with a serious expression.

Specifically, this year's winter was exceptionally cold. Wang Yehao sat alone in the warm pavilion roasting by the fire, while snowflakes drifted intermittently outside. When the news of the Nine Thousand Years hanging himself came last month, Wang Yehao no longer felt surprised. Since the late Emperor passed away on August 11th, Wang Yehao had become convinced that the Immortal's prophecy would be fulfilled. The subsequent ascension of Prince Xin, adopting the reign title Chongzhen, dismissing the Wei Rebel, and a series of events further strengthened Wang Yehao's confidence.

Recalling the treacherous court situation of the past half-year, Wang Yehao rejoiced greatly that he had placed the right bet. Although Wang Yehao had almost no interaction with the Donglin Party before, relying on the solid foundation supplemented by spreading silver along the way, the relationship was now maintained quite well.

The current Emperor not only successively retried the unjust cases committed when the Eunuch Party held power but also reinstated many officials who were squeezed out and suppressed back then. According to the current trend, the Donglin faction taking charge of the court was already a nailed-down matter.

Wang Yehao, who had performed well recently and rescued the daughter of Wei Dazhong, naturally became a red-hot figure in the court. However, he was not active about promotion but very modest. It wasn't how modest Wang Yehao was, but he clearly realized he was of *Tong Jinshi* background and "Zhejiang Party." In recent years, there were quite a few ambiguities between the Zhejiang Party and the Eunuch Party, and strictly speaking, there were many entangled points. If he rose too fast while the court situation was turbulent, he would not only leave an impression of opportunism but also arouse the resentment of a group of old Donglin people, making it difficult to last long. It was better to "store grain widely, build walls high," fully win people's hearts, and then exert force when the water flows to form a canal in the future. Moreover, with the assistance of the Hearthstone Daoist, maybe he could even add the Nine Bestowments [*Jiu Xi*] in the future...

No, no, Nine Bestowments is too outrageous; that is standard for rebellious ministers and traitors. He didn't have this thought. Then being enfeoffed as a Marquis and worshipping as a Minister, with titles for wife and protection for sons...

Speaking of this "Immortal" (since Wei Zhongxian committed suicide, Wang Yehao had privately changed "Sorcerer" to "Immortal"), he somewhat regretted letting him go to Guangzhou. Now separated for half a year, although news of safety came, there were no letters about the specific situation.

Wang Yehao was vaguely uneasy. After all, Immortal Zhou hadn't spoken about the future direction of the court. If he took a wrong step carelessly, all previous efforts would be wasted. Wang Yehao looked at the charcoal fire flickering in the stove and muttered faintly to himself: "It seems I still have to get 'Mr. Hearthstone' back."

He had already sent people to Guangzhou to find Liu Zhao and also sent people to Dongyang to pick up the two maids to the capital. Based on his cold observation and reports from servant women on ordinary days, he knew that Mr. Zhou was pure by nature. Although somewhat lecherous, he was extremely caring and cherishing towards his own women. Since these two maids had intimate relations with him, they were suitable bargaining chips.

"Master, your Fourth Uncle sent someone to deliver some pastries." Wang Liang walked into the warm pavilion, interrupting Wang Yehao's thoughts, and handed a food box to the table.

"Oh, did the person bring a message?" Wang Yehao asked.

"Didn't say anything else, just asked the Master to taste the specialty from *Guangli*."

"Good. Go down and reward some silver. Close the door; I won't see guests today."

After obtaining the forged documents from Jin Wenchi, Wang Xiantong quickly smoothed things out and succeeded in inheriting the title. Although hindered by public criticism, it was inappropriate for Wang Yehao to be too close openly to his Fourth Uncle who held a post in the Jinyiwei. But this didn't affect the uncle and nephew's private relationship going a step further at all. Wang Yehao had told his Fourth Uncle that he sent people to Guangzhou Prefecture and wanted to borrow the Jinyiwei's line to wait for a reply. Now that a food box was sent, obviously there was news.

Wang Yehao opened the food box. Inside were a few pieces of Cantonese-style walnut cookies, but they didn't look fresh; some were moldy. This snack was obviously not for eating. Wang Yehao broke the walnut cookies apart and indeed found a paper roll in one of them.

Looking at the signature, this was news sent by Liu Zhao in October. It said the two hadn't found the Australians or the Universe Mirror in Guangzhou Prefecture yet. Currently, there was no clue to continue searching, but Mr. Zhou was unwilling to return to the capital, and so on.

Wang Yehao checked the other walnut cookies and found no other information. He carefully read the text on the paper roll again, then threw it into the stove mouth.

The court situation changed too fast in these few months. If it weren't for the New Year festival, Wang Yehao rarely had the chance to think long and leisurely at home. For official matters, relying on Jin Wenchi was basically reassuring now. But grasping the general direction couldn't lack the "Immortal's" guidance, and secret jobs couldn't lack Liu Zhao. Now that both were away, doing things felt not quite satisfactory. Until the time of lighting lamps, when Wang Liang knocked on the door to ask if he wanted dinner, Wang Yehao withdrew his mind.

"Go prepare a gift. Tomorrow follow me to Fourth Uncle's place to pay respects." Wang Yehao instructed. "Send dinner over."

The next day, Wang Yehao followed the etiquette of a junior visiting a senior and arrived at Wang Xiantong's residence early in the morning. He had harvested abundantly in Guangdong and Jiangnan, so he was quite well-off recently. The gift list prepared today was also particularly heavy—this Fourth Uncle serving in the Jinyiwei had now inherited the title, and there would be more places to ask for advice in the future. The favor must be done sufficiently.

Since High Ancestor Old Man Hairi [Wang Hua] won the *Zhuangyuan*, in the four generations of "Shou, Zheng, Cheng, Xian" of the Wang family, success in exams had become less and less prominent. Although Wang Yehao was only a *Tong Jinshi*, this was unique in the "Ye" generation, so Wang Xiantong had always favored this nephew. Added to the fact that he recently helped get the title, Wang Xiantong paid extra attention to Wang Yehao's visit today and welcomed him personally in the entrance hall.

Sending walnut cookies yesterday and visiting today, obviously there was something to discuss. After a few pleasantries, Wang Xiantong understood Wang Yehao's eye signal, led him to the inner study, and then dismissed the attendants.

"This nephew wants to trouble Fourth Uncle with a matter." Since it was a secret talk, Wang Yehao didn't beat around the bush.
