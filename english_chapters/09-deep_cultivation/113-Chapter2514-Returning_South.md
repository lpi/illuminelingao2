# Chapter 2514: Returning South

Wen Tiren said, "I observe the Kun people's conduct; perhaps it is not necessary to blindly suppress. They are sea bandits, also sea merchants. Can order Xiong Wencan to follow the precedent of Zheng Zhilong to increase (offers) again. Using both suppression and soothing to eliminate the disaster of war, it is also not unknown..."

An hour later, Wen Tiren leaned back in the large sedan chair, closing his eyes to rest his mind. The sedan chair was very steady. Sitting inside had a little leisurely rhythmic feeling. This made him somewhat drowsy. He felt the weakness of this empire, but it still retained a massive size. Wen Tiren had never thought of its collapse. Even just relying on the huge skeleton could crush those constantly appearing provocateurs. The Eastern Barbarians could cross the border wall but could not occupy inside the pass. Although the roving bandits raged, they were just a passing locust plague. Although the newly appeared Kun thieves occupied Guangdong, in Wen Tiren's view, they were just coastal roving bandits. He exhaled lightly. *As long as I still sit in this position, everything will get better.*

Wen Mansion gatehouse. The Wen Mansion butler returned a gift list to Xiong Wencan's messenger and said, "My master has always been clean and upright. Heavy gifts are hard to accept. Distinguished messenger go back and just tell Governor Xiong that the entrusted matter is harmonized. No need to come again. Please."

The side door of the Wen Mansion closed with a bang, leaving a receding back figure on the street.

Beijing, flying sand dancing wildly. The sun was gray and hazy. All the way, dusty wind rolled up gray flying withered leaves, bringing up a city's loneliness and desolation.

In the twelfth lunar month of the ninth year of Chongzhen (January 1637), one of the fiercest cold waves of the Little Ice Age rushed down from Siberia. The mountainous area of Northern Guangdong welcomed another heavy snow. Crossing the Zhuji Lane on the side of Dayu Ridge was already wrapped in silver. Since the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty when Zhang Jiuling organized the excavation of the new Dayu Ridge road, this has been a necessary route for merchants traveling between north and south. Entering Jiangxi from Guangdong, there are two passages: the Meiling Road on Dayu Ridge and the Wujing Road northeast of Nanxiong. Meiling Road is further divided into Hengpu Road, Small Meiguan Road, and Dayu Ridge New Road, all leading forward to Nan'an (Dayu). Wujing Road goes east to Nanye (Xinfeng).

A team of merchants carrying loads, sitting in sedan chairs, and leading donkeys and horses crossed the Meiguan Ancient Road, traveled to Zhongzhan Village to rest a little, then hurried on the road again, stopping only at Zhuji Lane. Some unloaded and handed over here before turning back to Meiguan. Some had to continue to the First City of Southern Sky (Guangzhou); that was their land of wealth.

Zhuji Lane began to flourish in the Tang and Song Dynasties. Originally having three streets and four lanes, more than a thousand households, it relied on these merchants and porters coming from south and north. Now it was somewhat declining, far inferior to its prime time, and there were quite a few more "Kun soldiers" patrolling with guns. Dayu Ridge was originally the main land passage for Jiangxi and Guangdong trade. Goods transported from north to south were mainly medicinal materials, grain, and gold and silver. Goods transported from south to north were mainly Canton salt and ironware/tools, presenting a scene of "those passing south connect hundreds of packs a month, those passing north number thousands a day." Since the Senate opened the ocean route, Jiangxi's goods went by water to the sea directly to Guangzhou. The price was also half cheaper than land transport. Thus, the number of traveling merchants on this trade route was not as good as before. Many people who made a living by pack transport and portering lost their source of food and clothing, life having no settlement. Many people had no way out and successively went to the green woods to become bandits. Consequently, the always prosperous Nanxiong city also gradually showed signs of decay.

After the Central Army of the Senate's grand army captured Nanxiong County, the spearhead had passed Meiling. It was said that reconnaissance cavalry had reached under Ganzhou city. However, although the Australian military momentum was fierce, getting here was already the end of a strong crossbow. Within a few days, they withdrew from Jiangxi territory one after another, only occupying two exits of the Meiling Road: Nan'an and Nanye.

Although the Five Ridges area was now like two countries, north and south, the road was not blocked. Common people and merchants on both sides could also pass smoothly. The reason, nothing more than that both the Australians and the Ming government gentry needed this channel to maintain trade and personnel flow. So not long after withdrawing troops, the local Australian chief privately reached an agreement with the local gentry north of the ridge. The other side guaranteed not to restrict trade in exchange for the Senate no longer attacking and harassing within Jiangxi.

At this moment, in a tea shed beside the renovated official road, a scholar in Ming attire looked sorrowful. Remembering a poem his mentor Huang Gongfu wrote when passing here back then, he felt moved and recited: "The road to the long pavilion is Zhuji, today viewing the wind I feel the sorrow of *Shuli* (ruined capital). Where people gather in the registered households village, horses gallop on the shoulder-rubbing road."

"Young Master, what does this poem mean?" the servant boy following beside him asked.

The scholar said, "Sigh, just lamenting the prosperous scene of the past. Let's not mention it."

Merchants resting under the tea shed with him, seeing him sighing and groaning, comforted: "Old sir, nothing to be emotional about. Last year Song and Ming were at war, bandits ran rampant, and this Yuling Road trade route was broken for a year! Folks almost had no rice to eat. Fortunately, the war subsided quickly. The Fubo Army was effective and suppressed many bandits. Now that the ground has calmed down, we can resume our old trade to muddle through for a bite of rice."

The scholar shook his head and sighed: "Pity my Great Ming raised scholars for more than two hundred years. Didn't expect the cities of the Southern Sky to change hands in one morning. Raised nothing but wine sacks and rice bags!"

The merchant rubbed his cold hands, breathed a mouthful of hot air to his mouth to warm up, and said, "I actually feel the Great Song isn't bad. At least..."

The scholar snorted coldly. Thought *merchants are indeed all generation who see profit and forget righteousness. Running about for profit unable to serve parents is unfilial. Forgetting ruler's grace due to profit unable to serve the country is disloyal.*

Seeing him look displeased, one merchant said: "Sir only knows trade prosperity, but does not see the hardships of people's livelihood. This place is at the junction of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. Ten thousand mountains coil and knot; streams and caves are deeply blocked. Government and education are distant. From the Zhengtong reign to Chongzhen of the Zhu Ming, for more than a hundred years, there were peasant riots almost every other year. After the Great Song came, bandits surrendered, died, or fled. Now although north-south trade is not as prosperous as before, making a living is easier to do than before."

Another person picked up the conversation: "Yeah. In the first year of Chongzhen, Xingning mountain bandit Su Jun gathered a crowd, looting back and forth in neighboring counties of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong. The Southern Jiangxi Governor first offered amnesty, giving the mountain bandit a few squad leader official titles. Not long after, he rebelled again. After Su Jun was killed, remnants like Zhong Lingxiu and thousands of others rose again in the third year of Chongzhen, roving and robbing Huichang, Wuping, Chengxiang. Various counties suffered deeply. Because Xingning had many bandits, villagers chose defensible places to build walled houses to avoid chaos. There were thirty-six walled enclosures and seventy-one stockades."

"Just this one place of Nanxiong has more than ten passes used for defense against bandits."

The servant boy was a bit curious and asked: "Since it is so, then what secret technique did the Short... Song soldiers use? Able to clean up this bandit scourge that harmed for a hundred years?"

"Little brother, you don't understand this. Are there born bandits in the world? Zhu Ming suppressing bandits didn't get to the root. Like hugging firewood to save a fire; if the firewood isn't finished, the fire won't go out."

"You speak then," the servant boy reminded.

The merchant revealed a meaningful smile and whispered, "Most bandits were just peasant uprisings provoked by powerful figures relying on power to bully same clan and same tribe people, or bullying people of other surnames and tribes, acting recklessly and doing whatever they wanted, leading to bandits running rampant without scruples. After the Great Song came, ah, they hit local tyrants and evil gentry, repaid blood debts, and clarified fields. Those who put up stubborn resistance either died, or those who didn't die were said to have been exiled to Nanyang."

The scholar sneered: "Hahaha, I wondered why. Turns out the Kun... Song soldiers became the bandit leaders here."

"Speak cautiously, speak cautiously." The merchant looked around carefully. confirming no government people were there before relaxing.

The scholar said, "An ordinary man is innocent; possessing a jade ring makes him guilty. Seizing people's family property, dividing people's fields. How is this behavior different from bandits?"

Another merchant said: "Since ancient times 'Rise, the people suffer; Fall, the people suffer.' You and I are in troubled times. Presumably you've heard the saying 'Bandits passing is like a wooden comb, soldiers passing is like a fine-toothed grate.' Common people fear bandits but hate government soldiers more. Only this Great Song's Fubo Army doesn't do things like raping, looting, and killing good people to claim credit. Once military disaster arises, epidemics also follow. In two years, smallpox raged in Northern Guangdong; every village wore mourning. Fortunately, the officials dispensed vaccines. Now everyone in border villages is vaccinated, no longer suffering this pain of deathly separation. If bandits were all like the Great Song, what about following thieves?"

The scholar spoke no more. When he and the servant boy processed entry at Nan'an, they also underwent so-called "purification" quarantine. A short-haired woman in white clothes poked their arms a few times with a kind of needle never seen before. Only after the upper arm sprouted a pox were they allowed to enter the pass, and were even issued a "Vaccine Vaccination Certificate."

The merchants were still discussing the previous war with beaming faces.

"Where the Fubo Army's spearhead pointed, it was like destroying dry weeds and rotten wood. Capturing Nanxiong, Nan'an, and Nanye cities, Ganzhou was shocked. At that time, Linwu miners also rioted in response. Ming country bandit soldiers were beaten to scurry like rats..."

Another person laughed: "*Hehe*, the Southern Jiangxi Governor heard 'Kun thieves not full thousand, full thousand invincible', was so scared he closed the city gates tight, almost hanging himself."

"Ganzhou city wall is solid, easy to defend and hard to attack. Haven't heard of the Fubo Army attacking Ganzhou. It's just that the Southern Jiangxi Governor lost over half his jurisdiction. Chongzhen kid was exasperated, throwing him into prison in a fit of anger."

...

Listening to the merchants' Romance-style storytelling, the scholar raised his head and closed his eyes. On the fifteenth of the first lunar month three years ago, he rode a horse while drunk with friends in Guangzhou, roaming the flower lantern night market, extremely happy. It happened that Nanhai Magistrate Huang Xi was on patrol. He didn't avoid in time and was scolded loudly by yamen runners. He didn't dismount either. Huang Xi was very angry and ordered men to confiscate his horse. He relied on talent and was arrogant, considering himself a generation's romantic scholar, and satirized: "Riding a donkey just happened to meet the Huayin Magistrate; losing a horse still like the old man at the frontier." Thus offending the magistrate.

Huang Xi memorialized to strip his title and wanted to punish him. His father-in-law, Provincial Judge Liang Yuanzhu, pleaded for mercy to no avail. He had no choice but to flee to Guangxi, wandering the world from then on. His footprints covered Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and he also witnessed the scene of beacon fires rising everywhere in the Great Ming Dynasty.

Last year suddenly heard Kun thieves rebelled and took Guangzhou without blooodshed. He worried about his family's safety and had the heart to return home to organize righteous soldiers to serve the court. So he tried every way to return to Guangzhou. Only hated that the Kun thieves cut off the Dayu Ridge trade route and inspected strictly, so could not return. While in a dilemma, wandering in sorrow and indignation, he accidentally got help from a noble person. Only then did he settle down temporarily. Lingering for half a year, heard that the Kun thieves seemed to reach some tacit agreement with Jiangxi locality. No peace, no war, trade route reopened. Only then did he set foot on the road home.

This trip, what would be waiting for him?
