# Chapter 2561: Conspiracy in the Hermitage

Lin Jian saw his expression wandering, knowing his mother was seriously ill and he was anxious in his heart, so he said: "Today, Teacher came looking for you to help you. A few days ago, a long-time close friend invited me to participate in a secret meeting today. I heard that among the participants, there is an accomplished master who is quite proficient in medical arts. Perhaps he can cure your mother's illness."

Zhang Jiayu perked up immediately upon hearing this. He instructed his sister Shibao to take good care of their mother, bid farewell to his father, and followed Lin Jian towards Huangcun.

After Zhang Mu learned the meeting place was Li Yunlong's dharma site, he didn't bother to think much. He urgently ordered the servant boy to prepare the saddle and whipped his horse all the way. Encountering no obstacles on the road, in just about an incense stick's time, he arrived at Huangcun. Compared to Buddhist treasure temples like Nanhua Temple, Huashou Terrace, and Guangxiao Temple, Yan'an Hermitage's scale was very small. It was a typical Lingnan building, only two courtyards, gray brick walls, gray-molded ridge top. Because it was located in a remote area and was a newly built temple, very few people came here to burn incense.

Securing his treasured horse's reins, Zhang Mu knocked on the tightly closed main door. Moments later, a thin and gaunt bald monk emerged from behind the door. Indeed, it was Li Yunlong.

Zhang Mu was quite surprised. Not having seen Yanke for so long, he had unexpectedly become so haggard. He excitedly placed both hands on Li Yunlong's shoulders and said: "Yanke, I hope you have been well since we parted!"

"Amitabha. Muzhi, separated for several years, I have missed you greatly." Li Yunlong's expression was calm as he replied.

The two stepped into the hermitage and talked about affairs under heaven. Li Yunlong seemed not particularly interested. Zhang Mu wasn't surprised. He knew Li Yunlong had once been an advisor in Yuan Chonghuan's army. After Yuan Chonghuan died, Li Yunlong returned home in indignation and, having seen through the mortal world, resolutely chose to shave his head and become a monk. In former years, Li Yunlong shared lodging with him. Yanke had said to him: "You are a man of hot blood. Don't you know that what heroes cannot accomplish, once one turns back, all heroic tricks are but foolishness."

From then on, the world no longer had that Li Yunlong who "didn't think a scholar could remove his sword, traveling far carrying the prodigal to join the army." Thinking back to when Superintendent Yuan's command was gathered with brilliant talents, now all had withered and scattered, not knowing where they had dispersed!

Zhang Mu asked: "Since Yanke is unwilling to concern himself with worldly affairs, why extend an invitation here today?"

At that moment, footstep sounds came from behind. The visitor said: "Don't blame Muzhi; today it was I who extended the invitation."

Zhang Mu fixed his gaze. The visitor was Su Guansheng. Su Guansheng, courtesy name Yulin, a native of Dongguan city. According to what Zhang Mu knew, this person's examination record was not prominent. At thirty in the seventh year of Tianqi, he only entered the prefectural school. In the seventh year of Chongzhen, he became a *bagong* [tribute student]—this was the advancement path for *sheng yuan* [licentiates] who failed to pass the *juren* examination. Zhang Mu didn't like Confucianism but liked chivalry; his ambition wasn't in the imperial examinations. Therefore, he had little contact with Su Guansheng.

"May I ask, what matter does Master Su invite me for?" Zhang Mu asked.

"Naturally, it is to oppose the Bald Bandits and restore the Ming." Su Guansheng answered without concealment.

"Isn't Master afraid I will report you to the Fake-Hairs in the city?" Zhang Mu laughed.

"Those invited today are all loyal patriots devoted to sovereign and country; news will certainly not leak." Su Guansheng answered confidently. "It's just that the Bald Bandits have many eyes and ears in the city; we had no choice but to borrow Master Eryan's [Li Yunlong] precious temple."

"Hahaha, seems Master Su has been preparing for a long time." Zhang Mu laughed.

Before long, twenty-some people arrived at the hermitage one after another, mostly people from local wealthy families. The Lingnan region had been filled with superstition since ancient times, with various gods and Buddha beliefs flooding among the people. Temples and Taoist monasteries were numerous, and as religious sites, all manner of people might enter and exit, thus making them the best cover. After all the attendees had arrived, the hermitage doors closed tightly again. To be cautious, someone was even left at the door to keep watch.

After Su Guansheng surveyed once around, he cupped his hands in salute to everyone and said: "All who have come here were invited by closest relatives and friends; people whose backgrounds are known. Now that mountains and rivers have drastically changed and Guangzhou has fallen into bandit hands, we who have received the nation's grace for generations should naturally strive with all our might to repay the Sage Emperor."

As soon as his words fell, someone immediately echoed: "Exactly! These sea pirates obviously aren't any Great Song descendants. Not only do they not recognize the previous dynasty's merit titles, they've collected our tax-exempt privileges, and even say they'll remeasure land and levy up to 50% progressive land tax. Simply abominable beyond measure; must drive them away."

"Yes, even keeping a few slaves requires paying tax. Someone has already shouted that the Senate is 'All Taxes' [pun on 'almighty']."

"Dressed-up monkeys wearing crowns! Overseas barbarians also qualified to collect our taxes! Make them get out of Dongguan!"

For a time, emotions were aroused in indignation, with an air of wanting to storm the county yamen and tear all the Fake-Hairs to pieces.

Su Guansheng gestured for everyone to be quiet and said: "Being able to unite against the common enemy—if the Sage Emperor knew, he would surely be very pleased. But the Bald Bandits invaded already two years ago; their foundation deepens daily. On the day the bandit army entered the city, we couldn't resist. How much less today? If we want to oppose the Bald Bandits, we must plan carefully and come up with a strategy."

"What good strategy does Master Su have?" A young man named Li Zhen asked. He was friendly with Li Suiqiu. In the early Chongzhen years, he had studied at the Imperial Academy in the capital and was also on good terms with Chen Zilong.

Su Guansheng said: "As the saying goes, one chopstick easily breaks, ten chopsticks bundled together are solid. I believe we should now widely befriend righteous warriors, secretly practice military arts, gather firearms and blades. When the Court's punitive army arrives, we immediately respond, attacking from inside and outside, driving out the Bald Bandits!"

"Master Su, after the Bald Bandits came, they bestowed favors upon the rabble. The people are seduced by the bandits. Looking at the twenty-odd people at today's gathering, loyal and righteous men are few and sparse. How can great things be accomplished?"

"What you don't know: I have made contact with the Dragon Mountain righteous warrior, Master Jinyan. Master Jinyan risked danger to personally enter the perilous territory and has already obtained several thousand stalwart men." Su Guansheng then pointed to one person among the attendees: "Allow me to introduce Master Jinyan's student—Guan Yuesun."

Su Guansheng knew in his heart that due to the Australians' bandit-suppression operations, even if Master Jinyan had three heads and six arms, it would be impossible to gather a force of several thousand. But to draw more people into joining, what did a little bragging matter?

Guan Yuesun stepped forward and saluted everyone. This person wasn't old, looking about twenty-something, named Guan Zhongxi; Yuesun was his courtesy name.

Guan Zhongxi said: "My teacher personally went to Ganzhutan and Huashan, already persuading the Ganzhutan remnants and Huashan bandits to serve as arms. Also secretly placed disciples in the Fake-Hair National Army; they have now become familiar with the Bald Bandits' military methods. Additionally, major clans from Nanhai, Xinhui, and Xiangshan responded, and we've obtained several thousand local militia. If we could gain the assistance of everyone present, wouldn't it be like fish getting water, like tiger gaining wings?"

Su Guansheng nodded contentedly: "If each family present contributes manpower and effort, gathering an army of ten thousand would not be difficult."

Zhang Mu had always harbored ambitions to serve the country. His emotions couldn't help being stirred by the atmosphere. But having entered his thirties, he was no longer an impulsive youth. After calming down and pondering briefly—opposing the Bald Bandits was a matter of great magnitude. Wang Zunde and Xiong Wencan, leading regular armies, still couldn't match them. How much less a motley crew of several thousand? He asked: "Looking at it this way, the great cause of opposing the Bald Bandits already has a small foundation. It's just that the Bald Bandits' firepower is sharp; several thousand stalwarts are probably far from being the Bald Bandits' match. Moreover, before moving troops, grain must go first. To gather military funds and firearms under the Bald Bandits' noses, we still need another reinforcement."

"Hahaha, Muzhi is indeed a chivalrous warrior aspiring to the frontier; thoroughly thoughtful." Su Guansheng laughed loudly. "Correct. Allow me to introduce an extraordinary person to everyone—Daoist Mushi."

"Daoist Mushi? Who?" The crowd had never heard this person's name and began whispering among themselves.

At that moment, a person emerged from behind the Buddha statue, appearing quite like having immortal wind and Taoist bone bearing.

"The Daoist is skilled in strategy, proficient in military arts, and also has considerable accomplishment in medicine. A rare and difficult-to-find personage." Su Guansheng praised.

"Master Su overly praises me. Heard that Dongguan is the Lingnan hometown of Confucius and Mencius, the hometown of Sacred Teachings. Seeing today, indeed it hasn't disappointed this poor Daoist." Daoist Mushi held a whisk in one hand while stroking his beard with the other. "This poor Daoist, Mushi, was entrusted by Stone Elder to come deal with these overseas barbarians. Willing to join hands with everyone to drive out the Bald Bandits!"

"Who is Stone Elder?" Someone asked.

Daoist Mushi replied: "Stone Elder is my master's title. Only because there are already treacherous officials in the Court who have colluded with the Bald Bandits, it is inconvenient to reveal his true identity."

The crowd began discussing again. Unexpectedly, there were people in the Court who had colluded with the Bald Bandits! No wonder these bandits could operate in Qiongzhou for several years so smoothly. After their wings grew full, they actually became a grave threat to the Court—truly raising a tiger to court disaster. The Bald Bandits are truly hateful! But the treacherous ministers in the Court deserve death even more!

Su Guansheng said: "I have a plan. Since Master Jinyan could secretly place righteous warriors in the Bald Bandit National Army, why can't our Dongguan stalwarts do the same?"

Someone sighed: "Yulin, how can you not know? The Bald Bandits' cadres are all Fake-Hairs brought from Qiongzhou; they don't want us scholars at all. The civil service exams they hold don't even test the Four Books and Five Classics; all they recruit are market rabble. As for studying the Bald Bandits' books from a young age, I've heard some families have arranged young concubine-born sons to study at Australian schools. Their thoughts and ideas are no different from the Bald Bandits—all bewitched by them."

Since the eyes and ears previously planted among the Australians had been eliminated in the Witchcraft Case, Daoist Mushi urgently needed to know internal information about the Bald Bandits. At this point, he also spoke up: "If someone could infiltrate the Bald Bandit False Court, it would truly be crucial to our great cause of opposing the Bald Bandits. Are there stalwarts willing to enter the tiger's den for the Sage Emperor?"

Lin Jian, hearing Daoist Mushi say this, hurriedly nudged Zhang Jiayu and whispered: "Jiayu, this is a good opportunity. I was just thinking about how to ask this Daoist for medicine. Why don't you try?"

Zhang Jiayu had originally not planned for this but came seeking medicine. He never expected he would be participating in an "Anti-Bald Assembly." He originally had little contact with these wealthy families and was attracted here by the accomplished master Teacher Lin mentioned. Listening to this group's grand plans for opposing the Bald Bandits, he felt he couldn't join the conversation. With Teacher's reminder, he couldn't help but hesitate.

From the bottom of his heart, he didn't have much aversion to the Australians. Rather, the Australians' good deeds for the poor made him quite appreciative. In Guangzhou, he had also studied Australian learning with fellow members of the Shen Ao Academy, freely discussing the general trends of the world—truly an unprecedented great transformation in a thousand years. Chief Du also paid considerable attention to him; he could feel that Chief Du and Daoist Cui both had intentions to recruit him under their command. It's just that he had studied the Four Books and Five Classics since childhood, learned the ways of Confucius and Mencius, and earned Great Ming's academic honors. Now that the Sage Emperor still lives, how could he switch allegiances? How could he face his teacher and parents?
