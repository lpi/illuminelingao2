# Chapter 2633: Unexpected Complications

After Zhao Hening left, Mrs. Huang's (*Huang Shi*) emotions could not calm down for a long time. The fluctuations of encounters in recent days far exceeded her past life experience, so much that she even lost appetite for eating. She never made decisions by herself all her life; walking to this step was somewhat helpless. Although that young Officer Zhao asked her to go to Jiujiang Great Market Police Station to write a complaint three days later, she really couldn't imagine what would happen in the future. Huge sense of uncertainty made her feel anxious double.

Finishing farm work, not waiting for Guan Zongbao to return home, Huang *Shi* decided to go find Guan Youde's Second Sister to talk first. In her world, family affairs still had to be decided by family members. Like natives of this era, Guan Youde had several brothers and sisters. Among sisters, Second Sister had closest dealings with him.

Guan's Second Sister heard Huang *Shi*'s nagging, both shocked and angry. Shocked that Huang *Shi* actually wanted to divorce Guan Youde; angry that she actually found Australians to back her up.

"Younger Sister-in-law, since you married into Guan family's big door, you should abide by women's path. You are his hair-tied wife (first wife); caring for him isn't it heaven's principle and earth's righteousness? How can you raise such thought because of unhappiness in life?" Guan's Second Sister questioned.

Huang *Shi* said: "Second Sister, I look for you because you are his sister. Matters arriving today, I have no thoughts either. Telling you this matter is just notifying you in advance. Before long will gather elders in clan to decide together."

After Huang *Shi* left, Guan's Second Sister said straightly disaster in heart. Although she married into another family long ago, she still cared about reputation of maiden family very much. Immediately rushed to find Eldest Brother family; presumably Huang *Shi* would also come to find him. Not long after, news reached ears of this branch's Branch Head Guan Richang.

"Jiyi, matter Australian said is just so." Shimei Hall Patriarch Guan Boyi closed door to talk in detail with younger brother Guan Jiyi after returning home from Jiujiang Great Market. As a rare Metropolitan Graduate (*Jinshi*) in the clan, Guan Jiyi also served as Ming Dynasty County Magistrate. Big matters in clan naturally needed to discuss with him.

Guan Jiyi sighed a breath, "For plan of clan inheritance, have to lower head. Other clan elders should be able to understand."

"Mr. Qiutao and Mr. Zhongxian (Zhu clan) that side..." Guan Boyi was somewhat worried.

"If people from their two families come, hand over to me to handle is fine," Guan Jiyi said: "Qiutao behaves with awe-inspiring righteousness, whole-heartedly serving country. I and he same year (graduate) once; won't make it difficult for him. But wanting to put on lives of my clan thousand old and young, is also absolutely absolutely impossible."

Having Guan Jiyi's statement, Guan Boyi heart stabilized much, said: "Those who understand times are outstanding heroes. This time other five halls of Guan Clan also intend to cooperate with Senate. Heard Shude Hall is willing to gift land of Shangxi Village leaning West Sea to Senate. Although that piece of land is largely swamp and mudflat, with Australian's rumored ability, won't take long to transform into fertile fields."

Guan Jiyi said: "Yes ah. Observing recent ten years, whoever friendly with Australians, none not chickens and dogs ascending heaven. That Gao Ju was just a lowly merchant, blink of eye became pillar of state. Whoever evil with Australians, which one not body dead clan extinguished? Even Zheng Zhilong far in Fujian turned into a pile of yellow earth; clansmen dead dead, scattered scattered. Seeing him building high building, seeing him banqueting guests, seeing his building collapsing. If my clan doesn't cooperate with Australians, others queuing up want to get on boat. How will there be standing ground for my Shimei Hall in future?"

"Speaking so, these True Australians are actually not that coarse and vulgar as widely rumored. Heard Magistrate Zhang is a True Australian. Although looking not like a ruler, handling affairs has quite some methods; is a master of broad knowledge and strong memory. If people in Senate are all like this generation, indeed is tendency of achieving things."

"Hope Ancestors bless my Shimei Hall to pass this robbery smoothly."

Just when two brothers closed door to discuss, outside came servant boy's voice: "Master, not good, big matter not good..."

Guan Jiyi opened door, scolded: "What matter so panicked, what proper style?"

Servant boy lowered head, said anxiously: "Yanchang Ancestor Branch Branch Head waiting outside, saying big matter not good. Australians want to seize opportunity to create trouble."

"Where is person?" Guan Boyi heard, also came out asking.

"Two Masters follow me."

Circling anxiously on spot in main hall was Guan Richang. Seeing Guan Boyi, Guan Richang stopped circling immediately, stepped forward saying: "Patriarch, big matter not good!"

Although Guan Boyi age big, had seen many winds and waves. He sat down unhurriedly, instructed servant boy to serve tea, signaled Guan Richang to sit down again, only then spoke: "No need to panic. Have matter say slowly."

Listening to Guan Richang's report, Guan Jiyi felt this matter came strangely. Unless clansman violated national law, government always didn't interfere with clan affairs. Could it be Australians wanted to use topic to perform, killing chicken to warn monkey?

Guan Boyi despite being unexpected, heard blood pressure soaring too. Shouted angrily: "This sinful obstacle dislikes my Shimei Hall not entering Australian's Dharma Eye? Where is he? Bring him quickly, I want to interrogate personally."

When Guan Youde was escorted from gambling house by several young strong men to kneel before Guan Boyi, it was already matter of two days later. Guan Youde was still in drunken state.

A basin of cold water "Pa" splashed on Guan Youde's face. Only then he woke up suddenly, looking around partially panic.

"Sinful obstacle, do you recognize me?" Guan Boyi asked sternly.

"Branch Head! Patriarch! Recognize! Recognize!" Guan Youde answered fearfully.

"Look at good thing you did! Your wife actually wants to find Australians to uphold justice. This matter spreading out, where to put face of my Shimei Hall in future?" Guan Boyi scolded sternly: "Current situation clouds treacherous waves strange. Who knows if Australians will use topic to perform. Where do you want to place my Shimei Hall thousand clansmen?"

"Ah..." Guan Youde only felt himself more wronged than Dou E, shouted: "Wronged ah Patriarch! I just beat wife and son after drunk. I am also head of a family. Could it be violating King's Law?"

"My clan rules strict. Clansmen taught since childhood to respect teachers weight dao, husband wife harmonious. Matters of whole clan, quality to Clan Elder. If having tiny grudge (*Ya Zi*), must rely on Clan, Branch Head Ancestral Hall theory. Must not start Ancestral Hall Litigation unauthorizedly. Reading clan rules family laws every season first month, you learned all into dog belly?" Guan Boyi cursed.

Clan Ancestral Halls in South China mostly built in Ming Jiajing years. Clan rules also appeared in large numbers, having trend of Village Compact (*Xiang Yue*). Clan leaders to control clansmen more forcefully, requested government support one after another, approving clan rules. Government to monitor clans, strengthen local management, regarded clan rules as supplement to political power. To maintain order inside clan, clan rules empowered Patriarch judicial power to handle disputes inside clan, and prohibited clansmen from suing to officials, requiring clansmen to resolve contradictions inside clan.

"Beating wife? Hmph!" Guan Jiyi was also person experienced official sea sinking and floating, said: "Some matters not on scale not four taels heavy, but if on scale, one thousand *jin* can't stop. Tell your family matter first. This matter must have a coping method."

Guan Youde pulled east pulled west speaking up. Full of resentment towards Huang *Shi*. Also cursed Huang *Shi* having affair with certain Guan clansman; wanted to divorce her long ago.

Guan Boyi listened shaking head straightly, expression of hating iron not becoming steel. Gritting teeth cursing: "You these unfilial descendants, Ancestors' faces let you lose completely! My Shimei Hall Ancestor Pingjiang Lord Guan Jun, was descendant of Guan Yunchang. Four hundred years ago met chaotic world carrying clansmen migrating here, clearing thorns and cutting brambles only then could create family business. You..."

"Hahaha..." Guan Youde laughed loudly contrary to normal behavior, a look of rotting (*Bai Lan* - giving up/letting rot), said: "I a person about to die, don't know myself if can see tomorrow's sun. I self ask never did anything injuring heaven and listening to reason (*Shang Tian Hai Li*), yet falling into end of everyone rebelling relatives leaving, wife leaving son scattering. Still care what Ancestor Face?"

"Pa" a sound, Guan Boyi patted heavily on table with hand, emitting huge sound, "You! You want to be removed name from Clan Register right? If so, I will fulfill you! From today, you are no longer child and grandchild of my Shimei Hall. Not allowed to be buried in clan grave after death!"

Hearing "Removed name from Clan Register," Guan Youde only then panicked spirit, paralyzed on ground. If no name on Clan Register, he couldn't accept offerings and tributes of descendants after death. Soul couldn't return to Ancestral Land, henceforth becoming lonely soul wild ghost wandering in world, only relying on snatching remaining tributes with other small ghosts for food.

Guan Youde begged for mercy: "Patriarch, I know wrong! Beg you emit great mercy, spare me this one time. I guarantee definitely won't let Australians know next time."

"Still dare have next time?" Guan Boyi words carried threat. Although he was Patriarch, removing name from Clan Register was not simple matter either. Generally speaking, clan couldn't remove a person's name from Clan Register casually. Must be person committing ten evils not pardoned crimes or other severe violation of clan rules, corrupting family style to be removed name by clan. When expelling a person's clan membership, must also summon clansmen, announce wrong-doer's crimes before Spirit Tablets of Listed Ancestors in Ancestral Hall, then solemnly invite Clan Register, pick up writing brush, dip in vermilion ground with water, big stroke wave, cross out wrong-doer's name. Finally expel wrong-doer out of Ancestral Hall and family boundary.

"No next time! No next time!" Guan Youde answered submissively (*Wei Wei Nuo Nuo*).

Guan Boyi looked at Guan Richang, said: "Guan Richang, you Yanchang Ancestor Branch management poor. Someone entering Public Court unauthorizedly without crying to Clan first. Fine silver five taels, enter Ancestral Hall to fill public. Do you have objection?"

"No objection."

Clan as blood relationship group, in clan's view, clansmen's actions, important was glorying ancestors shining clan; withdrawing to seek secondly, also must abide by Ancestor Instructions, not insulting ancestors. If doing wrong thing, was unfilial to ancestors. Patriarch trying clan disputes was acting on behalf of ancestors, responsible to ancestors. "Children and grandchildren violating family instructions intentionally, gathering crowd to arrest to Ancestral Hall, telling Ancestors, adding punishment and treatment heavily, instructing them to reflect and change."

Guan Boyi said to Guan Youde: "According to clan rules should whip you ten boards. Seeing you have illness in body, fine you to repair Ancestral Grave."

Guan Youde kowtowed repeatedly: "Thank Patriarch for opening grace!"

Guan Jiyi instructed: "You must persuade Huang *Shi*, cancel lawsuit. Absolutely must not let Australians intervene in this matter."
