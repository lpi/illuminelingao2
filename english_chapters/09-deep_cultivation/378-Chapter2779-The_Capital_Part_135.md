# Chapter 2779: The Capital (Part 135)

"The young lady comes from a humble family and cannot bear frights." Granny Shi spoke with feigned understanding. "This old woman won't trouble her anymore—it saves everyone the difficulty, and spares her the fear."

"True enough, saves trouble," Liu Qi'er agreed, though her heart harbored a certain apprehension. Xu Yong had visited just days ago and delivered a severe lecture to every servant in the residence. Even the two young ladies had not been spared his reprimand.

She might speak dismissively of the teenager as one "still wet behind the ears," but power was not a matter of age. A single word from that young man could have her and her husband flogged until their backsides bloomed with welts—or worse, cost them their comfortable positions managing the Zhou residence.

Still, Liu Qi'er remained fixated on Granny Shi's "Imperial Secret Medicine." Moreover, she and her husband had spent years cultivating loyalty among the household servants through small favors, leaving her feeling secure in her position.

Had Xu Yong not interrogated everyone separately with such cunning questions, their arrangements would have remained watertight.

But Xu Yong could not remain in the residence indefinitely. The moment he departed, Liu Qi'er reverted to her old ways. You Rong disapproved of Xu Yong's "rectification" even more strongly. Ever since she had taken up with Pan Cheng'an, the two had become inseparable, clinging to each other like glue. How could she possibly accept such constraints? She therefore encouraged the Liu Qi'er couple to maintain their dealings with Granny Shi.

Granny Shi chatted with Liu Qi'er for some time. When the moment seemed right, Liu Qi'er stepped out briefly, circled around, then returned and beckoned to the old woman.

Granny Shi understood immediately. She rose and followed Liu Qi'er through the backyard, entering through a side door. Inside lay a small skywell courtyard belonging to the north-side room of the east wing. From here, one could access You Rong's quarters directly, bypassing the main courtyard gate entirely—and thus avoiding any disturbance to the young mistress living in the west wing.

Compared to the wing rooms that stood exposed in the main yard, the side room was more secluded and quiet, typically used as a bedroom or small study. This was You Rong's "private study."

Naturally, You Rong did not actually read or write here, and Zhou Newton had not yet reached the age for lessons. This "study" served as her place for confidential conversations and storing important items.

Upon entering, Granny Shi curtsied first, her face wreathed in smiles. "Good day, Miss!"

"Good day, Mama!" You Rong returned the smile warmly. "Please, sit." She called for tea to be served.

"This old woman just had tea in Sister-in-law Liu's room. Please don't trouble yourself, Miss." Granny Shi declined politely and took a seat. "I've brought the Qi-replenishing and blood-nourishing medicine you requested last time." As she spoke, she produced a medicine packet from her bundle.

Liu Qi'er, experienced in her service, recognized they wished to speak privately. She withdrew at once and closed the door behind her.

You Rong remained uneasy. Hearing the side door click shut outside, she rose and opened the room door to check, confirming that the backyard entrance was properly closed. Only then did she retreat inside, latching the door securely. She returned to Granny Shi's side and, dispensing with any pretense of formality between guest and host, sat down beside her.

"What news from Master Pan?" she asked.

Seeing her eagerness, Granny Shi suppressed a secret laugh. She deliberately kept her in suspense, speaking with leisurely nonchalance: "News, there is none..." Watching disappointment cloud You Rong's expression, she continued, "But there is a letter." She produced an envelope from her bundle.

You Rong's face lit with joy. She seized the letter and opened it eagerly. Having been trained as a Yangzhou Thin Horse—a courtesan raised for wealthy households—she possessed limited artistic talent and lacked the skill for composing poetry or couplets, but she could read and write well enough. As she withdrew the letter paper, a faint fragrance wafted up: the refined study incense favored by great households.

She had known this scent since childhood. Ever since arriving at Master Zhou's residence, she had found her new master crude and unrefined, utterly lacking these elegant touches. Instead, the house had filled with peculiar gadgets and contraptions. All that You Rong had learned through observation in her youth had found no use here.

Breathing in this familiar fragrance now, she was overcome with mixed emotions. For a moment, she drifted into reverie.

Seeing her distraction, Granny Shi prompted gently, "Miss, the letter."

You Rong realized she had lost her composure, a flush of warmth rising to her cheeks. She hurriedly unfolded the letter paper—Ten Bamboo Studio stationery, she noted. This paper came not from the local southern shops but was privately imported from Jiangnan, crafted from fine materials with exquisite workmanship, most elegant and refined.

Master Pan was not merely wealthy but truly possessed impeccable taste.

You Rong's heart gave a heavy thump. Originally, her affair with Pan Cheng'an had begun merely as comfort for the loneliness of her sequestered life. But gradually, she had found herself giving him her heart in secret.

The letter paper bore beautiful Regular Script calligraphy. It was the first time You Rong had received Pan Cheng'an's written words. With her trained eye, she could see that although the brushwork had a somewhat practiced quality, genuine effort had been invested. She could not help but admire it silently.

The letter bore no salutation above nor signature below—a careful precaution. The contents held nothing extraordinary, merely pouring out the bitterness of longing. He did not resort to flowery language or literary showmanship. A few simple, unadorned words revealed depths of affection that stirred her romantic heart.

She tucked the letter away and whispered, "I've troubled you, Mama."

"What words are these!" Granny Shi was a seasoned hand at such matters. Reading You Rong's expression, she judged success ninety percent certain. "Master Pan said there were things too inconvenient to write. He asked this old woman to relay a message: he misses you desperately. He can neither eat nor sleep for thinking of you, longing only to see Miss again..." As she spoke, she retrieved a small box from her bundle and pressed it into You Rong's hands, whispering:

"This is Master Pan's gift to you! He dares not give anything too conspicuous, fearing it might bring you trouble. These are Australian seawater pearl earrings—most precious, yet unremarkable enough to wear without notice."

You Rong opened the mother-of-pearl box. Inside lay a pair of pink pearl earrings, simple in design yet exquisite in execution. The pale pink pearls were modest in size but luminous, their surfaces alive with shifting light and color.

You Rong had seen many fine things in her life, but never pearls so beautiful. She stared, momentarily stunned.

How was this "unremarkable"? It was simply dazzling!

Setting aside the gold settings, this pair of flawlessly round pink pearls alone would fetch several hundred taels of silver at the Capital's finest jewelry houses.

She thought of Master Zhou. She had served him for years, nominally borne him a son, earned the status of a "meritorious minister" in the household. Yet apart from the jewelry "dowry" that Master Wang had sent with her upon arrival, he had never given her a single piece of jewelry.

True, Master Zhou crafted many amusing and useful little devices, but these were mere playthings or household implements.

You Rong sighed. "This gift is too extravagant." Even as she spoke, she hesitated.

Having received her payment from Pan Cheng'an, Granny Shi whispered, "This trifle counts for nothing. I hear Master Pan is the son of a great Jiangnan household, with wealth beyond counting..."

"Perhaps, but he is from Jiangnan nonetheless. After a year or so in the Capital, must he not return all the same?" You Rong could not suppress a sigh.

Granny Shi smiled slyly. "Could it be that Miss wishes to become his long-term companion?"

You Rong realized her slip and hastily protested, "You must want to die! What nonsense you speak!" She thrust the box back into the old woman's hands. "If you keep talking such rubbish, don't bother coming again!"

Granny Shi chuckled. "Count it as this old woman's loose tongue—I deserve a beating!" She gave her own cheek two light slaps. Nevertheless, she placed the jewelry box on the kang table. "This is Master Pan's heart. Keep it as a memento, Miss. Master Pan won't remain in the Capital much longer either..."

This remark caught You Rong's heart. She asked urgently, "What do you mean? He's returning South?"

"Indeed. He is Jiangnan-born, after all. He came to the Capital to broaden his horizons. As Miss yourself said, after a year or so, must he not return?"

"How..." Anxiety gripped You Rong. Her mind fell into turmoil—reluctance, regret, and some indescribable feeling, as if it were all a fleeting dream of golden millet, fading upon waking.

"Why so soon?"

"My good Miss!" Granny Shi slapped her thigh. "Master Pan has been in the Capital over a year now. He meant to return South last autumn, but the early freeze stopped the tribute grain boats from sailing, delaying him until now. Once the river ice thaws in March, he naturally must depart."

You Rong found herself speechless, momentarily lost in melancholy.

Judging the moment ripe, Granny Shi lowered her voice. "What Master Pan cannot bear to leave behind most is Miss herself. He wishes to have a farewell gathering with you. I wonder if Miss..."

She trailed off, watching You Rong's face.

You Rong unconsciously bit the handkerchief in her mouth, hesitating for a long while before speaking. "It's just that the residence is not as it was before..."

"You mean that young brat?"

"Yes. He's the follower of my master's apprentice—originally a trivial nobody, hardly worth mentioning." You Rong's voice turned bitter. "But now this apprentice has risen high in Master Wang's favor, and so his servant tyrannizes us as well. When he came the other day, he at least showed some consideration for old ties and left us a shred of face. Otherwise, he might well have dragged both me and the young mistress out for a public scolding!"

"I see." Granny Shi affected disappointment. "If that's how matters stand, perhaps it's best not to go. Master Pan said you must look after yourself and not take unnecessary risks..."

You Rong did not answer. After another moment's thought, she asked, "Where does Master Pan propose to meet? Ganlu Nunnery again?"

"Yes." Seeing the resolve in her eyes, Granny Shi knew her decision was made. Secretly delighted, she whispered, "There is at least a month before the river ice melts."

"Very well. Come again in three days." You Rong's voice dropped to a murmur. "I shall find a way to slip out by then."

"Excellent." Granny Shi beamed with joy. "I'll inform Master Pan immediately. Is there anything you need prepared?"

"Tell Master Pan..." You Rong gave her several instructions. Granny Shi listened attentively, nodding throughout. "This old woman understands!" She moved to take her leave, but You Rong stopped her.

"Where is the medicine I asked you for last time?"

"Look at this old woman's memory!" Granny Shi laughed. "I brought everything but forgot the most important thing."

She produced a small bottle from her bundle and spoke in a conspiratorial whisper. "Take one pill beforehand, another immediately after, and a third the following day. Continue for three consecutive days. I guarantee there will be no trouble."

"If there is trouble, you'll have been the death of me!" You Rong spat.

"Rest assured, Miss. Those who have taken this old woman's medicine number in the hundreds, if not thousands. Never once has there been a mishap!" Granny Shi's eyes crinkled with mirth. "This old woman only regrets not having this fine recipe when I was young..."
