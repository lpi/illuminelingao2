# Chapter 2497: Burning the Tower (10)

Speaking to this point, Yun Ting slowly extended his right hand and held up his index finger. "First, do not engage them head-on. Only attack from the flanks and avoid their sharp edge. The key is to delay, not to fight. Delay to await changes, and gradually erode their momentum. If we can delay until the Imperial Court's army arrives, then there is hope."

After finishing, Yun Ting extended his middle finger. "Second, obstruct their government orders. Make the heavy hand of the pseudo-dynasty difficult to impose in the countryside. Ambush and kill stranded pseudo-officials and unruly people who have defected to the Kun. Select one or two die-hard new converts to the Fake Kun and slaughter their entire families as a warning to others. Create fear in the villages so that the common people dare not serve as Kun officials or speak of Kun affairs. Create chaos so that their authority cannot be established, grain cannot be collected, and laws cannot be enforced."

Then he held up his ring finger. "Third, have the heroes of the various mountains harass traffic, intercept travelers and merchants, block roads, and ruin their public security. To maintain order, the Kun thieves will be forced to set up many checkpoints and spread their troops thin. Over time, they will inevitably be unable to attend to everything. The Kun people place great importance on commerce and manufacturing. If we find opportunities to commit arson and burn down the Kun thieves' newly established workshops, freight yards, warehouses, and shops in the Guangzhou area, disrupting their business and manufacturing, it will surely increase their troubles and throw their pace into disorder."

Speaking to this, he held up his little finger. "Fourth, I observe that wherever the Kun people go, they recruit many local braves. However, these township soldiers have neither Kun guns nor armor, only swords and spears. Moreover, there are few scholars in the Kun thieves' tent, and very few are appointed as pseudo-officials or clerks. They are forced to use local gentry and clan elders to govern the people on their behalf. The quality of these township soldiers is uneven, and there is no lack of loyal and righteous men who turn their hearts to the Imperial Court. Persuade surrender, strike when they are unprepared, gather heroes, coordinate from within and without, capture one or two village or township offices, seize guns and grain. It will surely shock the Kun thieves and greatly boost morale. However, this matter is extremely difficult and should not be undertaken lightly."

After catching his breath, Yun Ting continued, "On ordinary days, rely heavily on local powerful families and seek shelter and cover from relatives in the charts and lis. Circle and maneuver with the Kun thieves. If secrets are leaked and you encounter the Kun thieves' fierce suppression and cannot find a foothold, then pull up your troops and retreat to bagui (Guangxi), entrench yourselves in the borderlands, hide in the mountains, and seek opportunities to cause chaos and harassment. Wait for the grand army to arrive, then act as the vanguard. Only then can we make a comeback."

After listening, Wooden Stone Daoist said, "These are all strategies of scratching the surface; they cannot shake their foundation."

Yun Ting snorted coldly. "Planning is one thing, but being able to execute even one or two parts is already not easy. One must not be insatiable. The Kun thieves possess two prefectures, and their soldiers are elite and grain abundant. How can you or I shake them in a day or night? As for Governor-General Xiong, whom you mentioned, his head is still on his shoulders, which shows that the Imperial Court currently has no intention of dealing with the Kun thieves."

Wooden Stone Daoist pondered for a moment and said, "Hmm, that makes sense. Let's leave this matter aside for now. What about the alliance..."

Yun Ting said, "It is largely settled. I have already contacted Xue Tu, and he will come to meet us tomorrow. You have seen this person twice before. He is short-sighted, uncouth, and greedy. He can only be used and coerced, not allowed to lead. When the time comes, you must keep your mind steady, lure him into the trap, and not be swayed by him. However, this person is very loyal to his friends and is not afraid of charging and fighting. He has quite a reputation in the *jianghu*. With the support of several large clans behind him, he obtained this title of Marshal of the Heaven Gate. At his peak, he could pull together five to seven thousand men. Now that the Kun people are powerful and suppressing the large households and Daoist sects, even after removing the hangers-on, he still has two or three thousand followers. Currently, this person is being squeezed hard and is having a very difficult time. To protect himself, he will struggle. It will not be difficult to recruit him with the promise of heavy profits."

Wooden Stone Daoist nodded slightly. "This poor Daoist understands. Last time, I already promised Xue Tu a substantive appointment as a guerrilla general. Looking at how happy he was, scratching his ears and cheeks, and judging from his probing words, he is a man without a heart."

Yun Ting frowned. "Can you let him have his wish?"

Wooden Stone Daoist sneered, "Hehe, once the punt pole leaves the shore, it will be out of his hands. What difference does it make if it is true or false?"

He paused, then added, "Brother Yun, let us plan in detail again. Think it over carefully and do not let any slip-ups occur."

Distant mountains, dense forests, hillocks, strange rocks. Wisps of moonlight penetrated the dark clouds, illuminating the hazy and illusory wilderness. Tree branches swayed gently in the mountain breeze, leaves rustling softly. Tree shadows reflected on the mountain walls like flickering ghostly figures. A single bean of ghost fire in a deep mountain ancient temple reflected two black shadows whispering secretly on the window paper, like murmurs from hell.

A small boat swayed and winded its way along the river channel. Three people sat inside the boat's canopy. Xu Tong and Li Baiqing sat leaning back with their eyes covered by black cloth. A large man sat upright, staring intently at the two. Xu Tong leaned diagonally against the canopy wall. His body swayed gently with the undulations of the boat, appearing to be dozing off. In secret, he was sensing and distinguishing the speed, tilt, and bumps of the skiff, capturing every minute and special sound characteristic of the environment along the way. Xu Tong silently counted numbers to record the time. He crossed his arms seemingly casually over his chest, his left robe sleeve covering his right hand. His right hand was inserted diagonally into his bosom, clutching a short pencil stub in his palm inside his inner garment. Whenever the vehicle tilted, if it turned left, he would draw a line from top to bottom on the inner side of his collar; if it turned right, he would draw a line on the outer side. Every time there was a turn, he would note down the silently counted numbers on his inner garment using shorthand symbols in sequence. In situations where he could not record directly, Xu Tong used this as a supplementary reference for memory. Based on this, he roughly estimated the mileage and time of each turn, hoping to roughly infer the location of the destination by comparing it with a map afterwards.

He had practiced this training method many times in the past, with at least sixty to seventy percent accuracy. However, in the past, it was always on land, either by carriage or sedan chair. This was his first time by boat. Compared to a carriage or sedan chair, controlling direction on a boat was more difficult. It could only be considered a makeshift measure.

The meeting place was far from the city. The two had rented a house nearby the previous day and stayed for half the night. Before dawn, they came to wait. after boarding the boat, they traveled for a long time before the small boat slowly stopped. The boatman removed the black cloth from their eyes. Opening their eyes, they saw they were in a huge mangrove forest.

Abandoning the boat to go ashore, there was a small path in the woods. Guided by a guide, they went straight forward. The two could not distinguish east, west, south, or north, and just followed the guide all the way forward.

Walking along the road, other people joined in from time to time, all walking. Obviously, this place was inaccessible to carriages and horses, and comers had to rely on boats. Xu Tong was secretly worried. Since ancient times, waterways have been the most complex and changeable, especially waterways in such a large area of swamps and sandbars. The thirty-six heroes of Liangshan in the Song Dynasty gathered at Liangshan Marsh for decades, and the government troops were helpless. In fact, Liangshan had no dangerous terrain; it relied entirely on the eight hundred *li* of water to shield it from the government.

These people were probably the leaders of the various societies today. Xu Tong looked at Li Baiqing with an inquiring gaze. Li Baiqing only nodded slightly. After walking for a while longer, the road became more complex. Sometimes they had to push aside bushes, and sometimes they had to cross streams on temporarily laid planks. The surroundings were either woods or reed marshes, and even the sky could not be seen. Bright and hidden sentry posts appeared and disappeared along the way, heavily guarded. It wasn't until near noon that they arrived at a temple in a clearing.

Xu Tong was secretly alarmed. Small boats rowed and skulled very slowly. Although the time seemed long, in reality, this place was probably only fifteen to twenty kilometers from Guangzhou city. That is to say, coming out of the West Gate, the bandit nest was at most forty *li* away. And this bandit nest was hidden deep among the sandbars and mangroves. Without a guide, even if a large army were deployed to drag a net, they would never dream of easily searching it out! No wonder this group of people was fearless and gathered here openly.

The courtyard of this temple occupied a very wide area, but the layout was not very large. It was said that when the temple was built, because there was a lack of large timber for beams, iron sheets were wrapped around the spliced main beams, hence the name Iron Beam Temple. The halls and houses in the temple were all based on stone foundations, with earthen walls built on the outside and wooden halls repaired on the inside. The layout consisted of two entries. The front was the mountain gate hall courtyard, the middle was the Buddha hall, and the rear was the abbot's room, kitchen, and lay Buddhist rooms. Now most of them had collapsed. The mountain gate had long been dilapidated, and the plaque in front of the gate was nowhere to be found. Inside the hall lay an incense tripod missing legs and handles. The main hall enshrined a wooden statue of the Buddha, but the painted colors had long faded and the gold plating peeled off. Two standing statues of bhiksus stood beside the Buddha. The side halls on both sides were lined with more than twenty large and small bodhisattvas, tall and short, fat and thin, of various shapes. Due to years of disrepair, they were all rotten and their faces could not be distinguished.

Several minions welcomed guests in front of the mountain gate. After inspecting the official invitations, someone led them in. In the courtyard, dozens of long tables and folding chairs were arranged in two rows. Many people had already taken their seats. Minions naturally came forward to serve tea and offer tobacco. A round-backed armchair was placed in the center. Behind the chair was an incense table with a shrine on it, enshrining the Daoist Heavenly Emperor, with the inscription "Haotian Jinque Yuhuang Xuanqiong Gao Shangdi" (The Great High God of the Jade Emperor of the Golden Palace of the Vast Heaven). Three incense burners and four plates were placed in front of the table. The three incense burners each honored the three talents of Heaven, Earth, and Man. Three sticks of high incense were inserted into each burner. The four offering plates held whole meat offerings of pig, cow, sheep, and chicken, signifying that the disciples of the Heavenly Emperor who rule all realms do not abstain from meat.

The tables and chairs in the courtyard were arranged according to rank. A minion led Li Baiqing and Xu Tong to the very last table. The minion chanted loudly, "Li Baiqing, a master disciple of Old Li Village, brings his nephew Li Jian. Arrived. Take seats according to rank." After settling Li Baiqing and the other two, he served tobacco, tea, and fruits before withdrawing. Not long after, the two rows of seats were gradually filled. Aside from forty or fifty sect leaders, including disciples and gatekeepers, there were well over a hundred people. Everyone looked strange and grotesque. Some talked loudly, some whispered. Everyone had different thoughts, their eyes flickering, looking around constantly. The courtyard was noisy and chaotic.

What everyone was most concerned about were the hardwood boxes piled up under the corridors on the left and right, guarded by more than ten small minions. The boxes and lids were reinforced with iron hoops and locked with large padlocks. Could it be that inside were...

The story about Generalissimo Xue obtaining a large sum of silver had long spread among the sect leaders. It was said that a certain Daoist priest "turned stone into gold," while others said he had dug up the military pay buried by Governor-General Xiong back then. But Xue Tu was noncommittal about this, appearing even more mysterious and unpredictable.

Before they could speculate much, suddenly a crisp whip cracked, and the courtyard instantly fell silent. Then a drum sounded, and a minion holding a large wooden command token flashed out, chanting, "Heaven Gate roll call, everyone listen to the order." Hearing this, the attendees stood up in unison, causing a clatter of tables and chairs. After everyone stood firm, the minion chanted:

"Driving a cart requires the sunny open road,
Sailing a boat requires a flat sea.
...
The auspicious day has long been selected,
Heaven Gate opens wide to call the roll.
The auspicious time has arrived. Open Heaven Gate. Flag and card officers, hold the flags." 

After the roll call song was sung, cymbals and bo clashed in unison, and another muffled drum beat sounded. A big man carried out a large green bamboo banner with five large characters written on it: Heaven Gate Daoist Spirit Society.

After a brief pause, the minion chanted loudly again: "The Marshal ascends the seat."
