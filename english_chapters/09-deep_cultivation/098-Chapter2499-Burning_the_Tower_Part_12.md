# Chapter 2499: Burning the Tower (12)

Liao Yongcheng's face changed several times. He extended his hand partway, hesitated for a moment, and then pulled it back, ultimately not reaching out to support him. However, his tone was not as aggressive as before. He only said, "Little brother was a bit anxious and offended Senior Brother with my words. Senior Brother, being large-minded, surely will not take it to heart. It's just that the Red Sun Way was handed down by the patriarch. If the foundation is ruined in my hands, how will I have the face to see my master and grandmaster in the underworld in the future? Since the family was divided back then, there must have been a reason for dividing it. When children grow up, they naturally have to divide the family and assets to live separately; forcefully staying in one place leads to friction. The various grievances of the past are all trivial matters and will not be mentioned again. In recent years, Senior Brother Xue has mentioned standing shoulder to shoulder in alliance quite a few times. Although I have consistently refused, the offerings to the Main Way have never been short. If our own brothers suffer idle anger or fight for turf, my Red Sun Way has never been ambiguous about pulling together carriages and horses to fight outsiders. What difference is there between this and an alliance? In my humble opinion, it is better for each to establish their own household. The Main Way and the Red Sun Way can be horns for each other, watching over and helping one another."

Yang Tiezhou (Iron Elbow Yang) of the Eight Immortals Society heard this and hurriedly echoed, "Brother Liao speaks very correctly. Brothers dividing the family to live alone are still brothers. Own brothers, well, ahaha, don't need to be forcefully pinched together. On ordinary days, don't we still follow Senior Brother Xue's lead? It's no different. It's better for each to establish their own household, better to establish own households."

As soon as these words came out, they immediately received a response from the crowd. The whispering voices in the venue instantly grew much louder. Since someone had fired the opening shot, a group of sect leaders who had been cowed by Xue Tu's intimidation also muttered their unwillingness to merge shares.

A trace of impatience appeared slightly on Xue Tu's face, but he still tried hard to control himself, squeezing out a smile. "Brother heroes! Today is a major event. If you have anything to say, put it out in the open. One is one, two is two. Speak clearly to avoid leaving any roots for gossip or provoking anger in vain later."

Some sharp-witted sect leaders, seeing Xue Tu's unkind expression and fierce eyes, knew he had formed killing intent. They dared not follow in opposition, only keeping their mouths shut and waiting for an opportunity. Some saw the situation was bad and lied about needing to "go to the latrine," wanting to slip away. Unexpectedly, sentries had been posted on all four sides here. As soon as they reached the door, they were "invited" back.

Seeing the scene boiling over, Wooden Stone Daoist coughed lightly and said, " The ancients said: If ten thousand men manipulate bows and shoot at one target together, the target will invariably be hit? Now the Kun thieves are powerful. If we do not work together, won't we be defeated one by one by the Kun thieves? In the future, when Liangguang is recovered, everyone will have their own future. Is there still a need to dispute over this snail's horn?"

Hearing this, Pockmarked Chen of the One Universe Primordial Chaos Dao immediately stood up tall, one foot on a chair and one foot on a table, shouting loudly, "What 'each establish their own household'? Which family sitting here isn't incense left behind by the Main Way? Aren't they all transmitted from the Three Pure Ones Daoist Venrables? Originally, we belonged to one gate. Even the Buddha Fragrance Society, that's Buddha and Dao as one family, making no distinction between each other. Nowadays, everywhere you burn a stick of incense, I plant a flag. So many sects and halls haven't opened. Every family is just the light of an incense head. What use is it? If you ask me, the Great Dao returns to one. Why distinguish between each other? I think what Daoist Wooden Stone said is reasonable! Honor Senior Brother Xue as the master, and merge every family into the Heaven Gate Daoist Spirit Society. Brothers will all be leaders. When the Imperial Court grants rewards and we muddle into a future, won't that be happy?"

Liao Yongcheng glanced sideways at Pockmarked Chen and said coldly, "Whether it's truly to band together to resist the Kun or to swallow others to expand one's own power, everyone has a ruler in their chest. The human heart measures the human heart; one has numbers in one's own belly. Whether someone's dog ate a few catties of shit and is busy wagging its tail, I don't know, only I don't see a single copper coin here. I can't do the business of licking someone's ditch (ass)."

Pockmarked Chen was instantly furious upon hearing this. He jumped down from the table and struggled to go forward and tear into him, but was forcefully held back by several people around him.

Hearing this, Xue Tu couldn't help but frown. "Junior Brother, why hurt others with evil words? Now that a great enemy is before us, and before fighting outsiders, could it be that we ourselves are falling into chaos?"

Liao Yongcheng puffed out his chest and said loudly, "If we're talking about fighting Kun thieves, my Liao family has no second words. Back when fighting the Kun thieves, I, Liao, never submitted. I led the Daoist assembly and militia to fight several times. Who in the *jianghu* doesn't raise a thumb and praise 'Good Hero' when mentioning Tiger Tail Whip Liao Yongcheng? But if you say abandon the ancestors' foundation to attach to others, I, Liao Yongcheng, am not that unfilial. In recent years, Senior Brother Xue has said all that should be said. There's no need to waste spittle on this occasion today. Brothers have many miscellaneous tasks at home waiting urgently to be handled. I will keep you company less here and take my leave first." After speaking, he pushed the table and chair and stood up. The eight disciples and leaders attending him immediately stood up as well. The group was about to leave.

Yang Tiezhou of the Eight Immortals Society moved his body a few times, seeming to want to stand up as well, but swayed and shrank back.

Xue Tu hadn't expected Liao Yongcheng to leave just because of a few disagreeable sentences. He couldn't help but be stunned for a moment, then immediately said unhappily, "Even if you don't wish to ally, Junior Brother should stay to observe the ceremony. Why leave in such a hurry? What matter is so urgent?"

Guan He, the master of Green Stone Stronghold, snorted coldly. "Ordinary brothers weren't told the location of today's meeting. Leaving in such a hurry, could it be there are ghosts in your heart, having done something guilty? If I were to report this, with so many people, it would count as a major merit."

Liao Yongcheng flew into a rage. "Good you Green Ghost Guan He, don't spray blood on people (slander). Who do you think your little tricks are fooling? Where can these few mountains and *li* hide from me? If I really wanted to report to the officials, I would have long laid an ambush of troops to surround the mountain. I would catch everyone in one net as soon as the people were all here, never letting a single one escape. How could I still stay here to wag my tongue with you?"

Guan He just kept sneering *hehe*. "Oh? So Brother Liao has plotted for a long time. Knowing to arrest when people are all here. Very good, very good."

Liao Yongcheng was so angry his face turned red. saying no more, he turned to leave. unexpectedly, a person flashed out from an oblique angle and said, "Master, Senior Uncle Xue speaks reason. All the venerable elders are here. If we leave first, it will easily invite gossip. Why not stay and watch; that would be good too." Liao Yongcheng turned his head and saw it was indeed his second disciple, Liu Jun. He said unhappily, "What ceremony to watch? When words do not agree, half a sentence is too much. Staying would only increase people's detestation. We're getting out of here." After speaking, he saw that Liu Jun did not move his feet to make way, but stood firmly. Immediately, his heart moved, and his eyes gradually became gloomy and cold, staring coldly at Liu Jun. However, Liu Jun did not meet his gaze, but looked away behind him.

Suddenly, a person behind Liao Yongcheng shouted loudly, "Master, the matter has failed. It's better to just tell the truth."

Liao Yongcheng's heart shook violently. He turned his head abruptly and saw it was his fourth disciple, Wang Yunshan.

Wang Yunshan didn't even look at Liao Yongcheng. He strode into the center of the field, knelt down with a *plop*, wiped his eyes with his sleeve—ginger and garlic were immediately smeared into his eyes—and two lines of hot tears rolled down. He took a letter out of his bosom, held it high with both hands, walked a few steps on his knees, presented it to Xue Tu, and cried, "Senior Uncle Xue, disciple turns in his superior. My master privately often says to us disciples that now the Kun army is strong and powerful. Sooner or later, the rivers and mountains will change masters and the wind and clouds will change color. He has long harbored the heart to bring his armor and surrender to the Kun. Some time ago, Master talked late into the night with the leader of the Lower Beitai Work Team, saying only that once the way was clear, he would sell his friends for glory. When the heroes gathered, he would destroy our Great Way in one stroke. Only this time it was rushed, and he didn't have time to arrange it. This is the letter of surrender my master wrote to the Kun pseudo-magistrate. Disciple intercepted and killed the work team member delivering the letter halfway to obtain this letter. An ancient saying goes: A family with a strictly admonishing son will not ruin the family; a country with a strictly admonishing minister will not lose the country. Although I am like father and son with Master, how can we brothers watch Master take a wrong step and enter a wrong path? Moreover, this matter concerns the lives and families of thousands of brothers in our Great Way. Since ancient times, loyalty and filial piety are hard to balance. Disciple had to do this act of betraying his teacher. My heart feels like it's being twisted by a knife. But I only beg Senior Uncle Xue to consider Master's past hard work and high merit, and also pity our disciples' filial hearts, and forgive Master's single mistaken thought. I am willing to take Master's crime on my body to slightly reduce his punishment. I beg Senior Uncle Xue to perceive clearly!" After speaking, he kept kowtowing.

Xue Tu turned pale with fright upon hearing this. He hurriedly took the letter, unfolded it to watch, then showed a sad look and sighed lightly. "I absolutely do not believe that Junior Brother Liao could do this act of rebelling against the Way and betraying the gang. Only right now, I, Xue, am confused and find it hard to make a decision. Please pass this letter around for everyone to see and help me, Xue, with a word or two of counsel." After speaking, he handed the letter to several people at the head table.

Then he said, "But now the facts are unclear, and it is not good for me, Xue, to act arbitrary and privately release Junior Brother Liao. How about this: Junior Brother, please go to the backyard to rest for a while. Wait until we verify it clearly, then return Junior Brother Liao's innocence." After speaking, he waved his hand. Immediately, several minions behind him drew their swords and pressed Liao Yongcheng's entourage of disciples. Several standing minions rushed out from the main hall, each raising guns and sticks, pressing straight towards Liao Yongcheng.

Hearing this, Liao Yongcheng's liver and gall burned, and his eyes cracked open. Xue Tu's map had been unrolled to reveal the dagger (intentions revealed). Liao Yongcheng knew he had no retreat. Now the only chance of survival was to kill his way out of the mountain gate and join the dozens of disciples he brought outside. Deciding promptly, he touched his waist and pulled out a nine-section tiger tail soft whip. Just as he was about to fight, he suddenly heard a *whoosh* by his ear. An iron hammer the size of a child's fist, carrying a vicious wind, struck fiercely from behind him. It smashed heavily into the back of Liao Yongcheng's head. A crisp crack of bone fracture came from the back of the skull. The parietal bone was smashed and fractured, and the entire back of the head instantly collapsed. Liao Yongcheng's body swayed and flopped heavily to the side. His head hit the top of a table beside him with a *bang*, bounced up with a *thump* from the reaction force, and fell again with a *clank*. Thereupon, his upper body lay prone on the table, making no more sound. Blood from inside the skull slowly seeped out from his unclosing eyes, nostrils, and corners of his mouth, rippling out bit by bit on the tabletop, flowing down the table edge and corners, slowly soaking the ground in front of the table.

Liao Yongcheng's body fell suddenly, and the figure of Liu Jun behind him abruptly stood out. He held the iron hammer in his hand, blood dripping *tick-tock* from the hammerhead. Dense blood spots were splashed on his face and clothes, looking hideous and terrifying. He tried hard to squeeze out a fawning, ingratiating smile and said, "Liao Yongcheng privately sold out his fellow brothers and vainly attempted to use force to resist the sect laws. His crime deserves death. According to the Daoist laws and sect rules, he should be executed by heavenly thunder and die under the compliant blade."

The unexpected event caused a *boom* in the courtyard. Almost everyone stood up at the same time, looking frightened, shocked, excited, or joyful. But hearing a burst of clappers, minions ambushing inside the Buddha hall and outside the mountain gate all poured out, surrounding the crowd in the core, making everyone dare not move rashly.
