# Chapter 2440: Persuasion (Part 2)

"The scope is mainly the Indochinese Peninsula. Including Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and such places." Wang Kai roughly introduced the planned expedition range. "Currently it doesn't involve Indonesia or the Philippines."

"And the expedition duration?"

"About half a year in total."

"Hmm." Lin Hanlong fell silent, seemingly considering something. Wang Kai hurried to add: "This expedition ship is newly built and purpose-made, and we've selected a very competent captain, Li Huamei. This will make daily life more convenient."

"Actually, that's not what I'm thinking about." Lin Hanlong spoke. "Sonia has already gone out several times with the Survey Department's expedition teams. I trust the Senate's arrangements on this point. The main issue is that her child is still young—only nine months old next week..."

"We're not departing immediately either. If everything is ready, it'll probably still need one to two months." Wang Kai felt a pang—this was indeed hard to justify. He wanted to add something like "the expedition is very important," but then thought that no matter how important it was, it couldn't be more important than one's own child. Saying such things would have no persuasive power.

If this were the old timeline and he were an administrative leader, he could "promise positions and rewards"—promotions, titles, salary increases, shares, and so on. What was there to discuss here? Lin Hanlong wouldn't care about such things.

After much thought, Wang Kai decided to try moving Lin Hanlong with "achieving glory and making history."

"Old Lin, I know this invitation is rather unreasonable. But this is the Senate's first comprehensive, systematic survey of the Indochinese Peninsula. Its great significance is comparable to the first circumnavigation of the island. It's not just our Nanyang Company's business. Scientific significance, historical significance, political significance... anyway, they're all very significant. It will definitely be recorded in history."

The more Wang Kai spoke, the more he felt he was grasping at straws, feeling like he was about to run out of things to say.

After thinking for a moment, Lin Hanlong said: "You have a point. This matter has great significance for Sonia. But there are indeed current difficulties." He suddenly remembered something. "Have you mentioned this matter to her?"

"No, no." Wang Kai quickly shook his head. "I thought I should ask your opinion first about this matter."

"I need to consult with Sonia. This is a big matter for our family. We need to discuss it..."

"If there are any difficulties with childcare or household matters, our company can provide corresponding manpower or financial assistance..."

"You think I need your help for that!" Lin Hanlong laughed. "If there really are difficulties, can't I just go to the General Office!"

"Yes, I just wanted to express my sincerity."

"I see your sincerity." Lin Hanlong said. "I'll give you an answer the day after tomorrow. How's that?"

Wang Kai immediately said "no problem" and expressed that he "fully respects their opinion." Leaving the optical factory, Wang Kai felt he now had a sixty to seventy percent chance. He now somewhat understood Lin Hanlong's mindset: he wouldn't refuse to let his woman win the laurels of success.

Think about it—one of the founders in the field of natural history, the natural history director of the Southeast Asia expedition. These titles weren't just for the moment; they would be recorded in history. How many naturalized citizens could have such an opportunity? As long as Old Lin wasn't foolish, he would support her going. The child issue—he would surely find a way to overcome it...

*Next is my ship...* he thought. *After getting Sonia sorted, I still need to make a trip to Hong Kong.*

Wu Yijun opened Chen Lin's letter and skimmed through it first. His expression was rather complex. He set down the letter and asked: "Where is the person who delivered the letter?"

"Waiting in the gatehouse," the steward reported. "It's Young Master Lin's manservant, Qing'er."

"Take him to a guest room. Have him bathe and change into clean clothes—then get him some good food to eat. After he's eaten his fill, bring him to see me."

The steward acknowledged and left. Wu Yijun picked up the letter and read it carefully again, pondering the situation described within.

From the letter, it seemed Chen Lin had attached himself to the Australians' coattails—this was actually a wonderful thing. Though Wu Yijun saw Australians in Guangzhou constantly, he obviously couldn't be called "intimate" with them. For his nephew to become an "assistant" at an Australian's side showed the Australians trusted him greatly.

Wu Yijun knew: as long as one gained the Australians' favor, any business would be easy to discuss. He hadn't expected his nephew to have such skills, able to make a female Australian happy! He had originally thought the boy was just honest and dutiful—he hadn't expected him to be quite cunning too! Truly, the younger generation is to be feared!

The female Australian was preparing to develop sericulture in Nansha. His nephew couldn't get away for the time being and couldn't cooperate with him on the cotton spinning matter. But the letter said he was still interested in this and would continue working on it.

However, the letter didn't say specifically how to proceed. Wu Yijun thought about it and understood—important words were probably to be conveyed verbally by the messenger. Otherwise, why would he specifically send his trusted manservant to deliver the letter?

Just as he was thinking about how to question him later, the steward came again, holding a large envelope.

"What is it?"

"Just delivered by someone from the Federation. Said it's urgent official correspondence..."

Wu Yijun hurried to receive and open it, pulling out the official letter inside. It turned out that the Guangzhou Municipal Government and Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce would hold a "Patent Licensing Conference" at Zhenhai Tower on January 15th, inviting members to attend. The notice also stated that this conference would last two days. The first day was exclusively for Federation of Industry and Commerce members; the second day had no qualifications restrictions—anyone capable of paying the deposit could attend.

This matter had already been previewed at the New Year's reception, so Wu Yijun wasn't particularly surprised. He casually flipped through—behind it was a thick appendix, all introductions of projects up for auction and approximate starting prices.

The starting prices varied enormously—some could be done for just a few dozen silver dollars, while others required twenty thousand. The cotton textile project Wu Yijun had his eye on had an overall licensing fee as high as twenty thousand.

Of course, twenty thousand silver dollars wasn't a problem for him, nor for many colleagues in Guangzhou. If they could obtain licensing, spending tens of thousands more wouldn't be an issue. That factories could make big money—Wu Yijun and many wealthy people in Guangzhou had seen this very clearly. Wasn't that walnut cookie factory proof? Not to mention the Australians' own factories.

However, to actually take on this project, subsequent investments would also be a considerable sum. Estimated from start to finish, it probably couldn't be done without sixty or seventy thousand taels of silver. Obviously, he alone couldn't manage it.

As for Chen Lin's side, he had originally only hoped for his knowledge. The Chen family were old-school scholar-gentry folk—the clan had more land than money. He still needed to find a few partners.

Wu Yijun silently calculated in his mind. He had originally planned to find someone with close connections to the Australians as a partner. Prominent families like the Gao family with their "Walnut Cookies" were naturally beyond his reach, but there were quite a few in Guangzhou who had been close to Zicheng Company in the past. He was particularly optimistic about one—the Dong family.

The Dong family were hereditary military officers from local Guangzhou military households. The family head and eldest son were still serving in the interior, but the entire Dong family resided in Guangzhou. This family's young master, Dong Jizhong, had been friendly with Guo Yi in the past and reportedly had "rendered merit." When military households were purged, he escaped disaster—not only were people and property safe, but family assets were also unaffected.

The Dong family was also sensible. They "donated" their city mansion and properties to the Australians, and the whole family moved to a villa outside Dongguan to live quietly in seclusion, rarely going out.

Their family had been officials in Guangzhou for generations. The wealth accumulated at home was at least three to five hundred thousand taels. A few days ago when the Australians were issuing Nanyang Company bonds, the Dong family bought ten thousand taels' worth of bonds in one go.

The Dong family had always kept money deposited with his "firm," and their relationship could be considered "deep." If he could bring them in as partners, he would solve the capital problem and also build a "bridge" to the Australians.

Just as he was contemplating, the steward brought Chen Qing over. Chen Qing kowtowed upon approaching. Wu Yijun nodded silently and instructed the steward to bring a cushion for him to sit on.

"I dare not." Chen Qing was somewhat flustered.

"Don't be polite. Though your status is low, you're still a Chen family member. You can sit on this cushion!"

Chen Qing hurried to thank him and sat down carefully.

"I've already read the letter. I also roughly know what Lin'er wants to tell me. But there are some things in here I'd like to ask about."

"Yes, Master."

"Did Lin'er tell you to pass on any message?"

"No." Chen Qing shook his head. "But he said: answer whatever the Master asks. He said I know everything about his affairs in Nansha—the Master can ask anything."

"Tell me about everything that happened after you returned to Nansha—in detail."

"Yes." Chen Qing didn't know the reason, but since Chen Lin had instructed him, there was no need to hide anything. He immediately related everything that had happened after returning to Nansha clearly, one by one.

Wu Yijun listened and secretly nodded. So that was it! It seemed this matter was much more complicated than he had imagined. If Chen Lin couldn't find a way to eliminate "Second Uncle," the cotton spinning matter probably couldn't be accomplished! No wonder he said the cotton spinning matter could only be delayed for now—he needed to focus all his efforts on the sericulture improvement work. How else could he win favor with the female Australian?

*This child really knows what's important.* Wu Yijun thought. *I really didn't misjudge him—he's talented at business development!*

But in a few days, he would be going to the patent auction. Once the bid was won, the entire cotton mill project would have to start running. He knew nothing about textiles. Though the Australians would send people to guide on the technical side, for actual business operations, he still needed someone like Chen Lin—who couldn't come for a while. How would his factory manage?

He pressed further: "What else did Lin'er tell you?"

"Oh, there's one more thing." Chen Qing remembered. "Young Master asked the Master to help find Third Uncle. After Third Uncle left in a huff, he went to his father-in-law's house. But Young Master said Third Uncle very likely came to Guangzhou. Please have the Master try to find him. If he can be found, please take him in for now."
