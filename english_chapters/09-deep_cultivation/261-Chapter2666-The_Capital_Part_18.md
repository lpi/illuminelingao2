# Chapter 2666: The Capital (Part 18)

The three of them did not ride horses but took a mule cart directly back to Heliansheng.

Just after washing their faces and taking their seats, a young fellow brought tea. An attendant came in from outside and reported, "Chief Escort, there are three guests outside asking for an audience."

Li Rufeng paid no attention and said impatiently, "Guests from where? I am busy with family affairs right now and can't attend to them. Go turn them away. Just say Li bows and thanks them, and will visit them another day."

The attendant replied, "The visitors said they came for Master Leng's matter."

The hearts of the few people in the room were startled. Liao Sanniang blurted out in a low voice, "Someone comes just as we return. I'm afraid even Lingao's telegraph box isn't this fast."

"Their spies have been staring outside Delong for a long time," Li Rufeng said.

Middlemen who proposed ransoms were mostly relatives or friends of the victim, or influential local figures who could take on matters and responsibilities. Sometimes they would also look for hooligans and rascals colluding with the greenwood bandits to bridge the two sides and ensure the normal progress of the transaction.

The government law forbade redeeming people. Once caught proposing a ransom, one would be labeled as a bandit relative or accomplice. After arrest, they would be subjected to severe torture and wanton extortion. Therefore, being a middleman carried great risks, and one would not easily agree without connections or benefits.

Li Rufeng's body was instantly nailed to the spot. His majestic back figure stood at the doorway for a moment. Then he turned abruptly, released Wu Kaidi's arm, strode back to the center of the living room, sat upright, and said in a deep voice, "Invite them in."

Before long, three big men walked into the hall in a triangle formation. Liao Sanniang, Wu Kaidi, and Little Bazi stood on both sides. When the three walked past them, the three of them all scrutinized the visitors carefully. The leader had his head wrapped in a blue cloth, wore a blue cloth straight gown, had a burly stature, a bound waist and narrow sleeves, and wore black boots on his feet. The two behind him wore dark melon-skin caps, coarse short jackets, hemp shoes, and leg wrappings on their calves, all dressed like farmers.

The three had fierce faces, their chests exposed, shaking their shoulders and hunching their backs, walking without proper form. Although there were no patches on their clothes, they were stained with a lot of oil and dirt, appearing greasy and filthy.

Seeing the three enter, Li Rufeng slowly stood up, ordered tea to be served, cupped his hands to the three, then gestured towards the few officials' hat chairs below, signaling the three to take their seats. Then he said, "Where do the good fellows come from?"

The leading big man cupped his fists in return and laughed, "We specially come to relieve the Chief Escort's worries."

Li Rufeng also laughed and said, "Li can eat meat and drink wine. Where do I have so many worries?"

The big man laughed *heihei* and said, "Without us brothers, I'm afraid the Bureau Chief cannot pass this *cold* autumn." He emphasized the word "Cold" (Leng) heavily in his speech.

Hearing this, Li Rufeng narrowed his eyes slightly and said, "Traveling far in the *Jianghu*, making friends with ten thousand people. We in the escort business set up counters outside and seek a living on the knife edge in the capital city, relying entirely on friends' help. Since the good fellows are here, no need to hide and tuck, speaking those unrelated half-sentences. Clear people stand in the light; just speak openly."

The big man raised his hand and said loudly, "The Bureau Chief is straightforward. We three brothers are from Sanhe County. We don't have nicknames; others just call us randomly Song Da, Wang San, and Liu Wu. We have a small reputation in the countryside. Master Leng has been dusted [in trouble], but was invited away by the good fellows of Tianxuan Stronghold. My brothers were entrusted by Chief Hu of Tianxuan Stronghold to come here just to be middlemen, holding up both families with one hand, to settle this matter."

Li Rufeng nodded and said, "Willing to come out as middlemen, Li truly appreciates Brother Song's kindness. Brother Song is also a local power; let's not speak those empty formalities. Just set the time, place, how to hand over the ransom, and the amount, and trade as soon as possible."

Speaking of this, Li Rufeng paused before continuing, "To burn incense, one must first see the true Buddha."

The big man called Song Da laughed, "Good, let the Chief Escort see the true Buddha."

A person behind Song Da took out a cloth bundle from his bosom and presented it to Li Rufeng. Li Rufeng opened the cloth bundle and saw a lock of black hair inside.

Li Rufeng immediately felt something was wrong. To be used as a token, it must have obvious identifiable characteristics. Along with Leng Ningyun, a carriage and clothes were also lost, which would be better proof. Everyone has hair; one couldn't tell at all if it was Leng Ningyun's body hair.

Li Rufeng frowned and passed the cloth bundle to Liao Sanniang. Liao Sanniang took it and grasped it with her hand. Although the hair was a strong man's black hair, the texture was slightly dry and withered. The owner of the hair seemed to be somewhat malnourished.

Leng Ningyun's hair was shiny and full of luster. Liao Sanniang almost immediately judged that this was not Leng Ningyun's hair. She didn't point it out but walked slowly to Song Da. With a pleasant countenance and a warm voice, she said, "Brother Song, I'll take this hair to let Master Leng's concubine identify it. If it's correct, everything is easy to discuss. Don't say this slave is suspicious; any family with such an incident would be very anxious. But there happen to be those wicked people with hairy hearts; the more other families are sad, the more they want to take advantage of the danger to seek that unrighteous wealth."

While speaking, Liao Sanniang watched carefully and saw Song Da's face stiffen, and his body twisted uncomfortably.

Liao Sanniang nodded and suddenly said, "The wind was so strong at the *Yin* hour last night, blowing down half a letter and a carved feather."

Hearing this, Song Da was somewhat baffled and replied, "Song went to sleep early last night and didn't know if the wind outside was strong or weak."

Seeing that he didn't know about the letter delivery, Liao Sanniang already knew the score in her heart.

Liao Sanniang spoke up, "Eh? Both the Leng residence and Delong are managed by Mister Wu. If there is a matter, one goes to the Leng residence. Why did Brother Song Da seek out this escort agency?"

Song Da's heart tightened, and he hurriedly explained, "Who doesn't know Heliansheng and Delong act as the outside and inside for each other? I saw Master Wu coming..."

Liao Sanniang giggled and said, "Everyone knows? I'm afraid not everyone knows. Brother Song San must have been staring at Master Wu's whereabouts in the Leng residence to know, right?"

Song Da became nervous and hurriedly said, "Absolutely not!"

After speaking, Song Da stood up abruptly and said sternly, "The Leng residence is quite far from here, and traveling back and forth takes time. Song has other matters today. Since you want to verify, Song will come to visit another day. I only ask the Bureau Chief to temporarily advance one thousand taels of 'Knock Silk' [Silver] for Master Leng's food and lodging expenses in recent days. Otherwise, I fear what will be sent next time will be Master Leng's fingers and toes." After speaking, he sneered *heihei* for a while.

Hearing this, Liao Sanniang seemed to be frightened. Her face paled slightly, and she dared not speak again. She paced back two steps, untied the slipknot of her cloak casually, then looked at Li Rufeng and stammered, "Ah, Chief Escort, this... what should be done about this?"

Li Rufeng looked at Liao Sanniang, sighed, frowned tightly, nodded, and shouted to the subordinates, "Why does Sanniangzi have no way of treating guests at all? Go to the counter to withdraw one thousand taels of silver and ask Brother Song to take it away. No matter what, we must ensure Master Leng is intact."

Seeing Li Rufeng relent and the fellow going down to get money, Song Da's spirit relaxed involuntarily. Just as he was about to speak, Liao Sanniang looked at the hair in her hand and suddenly said, "Eh? This looks like dead man's hair."

Song Da's face couldn't help changing. he blurted out, "How could it be? This was just cut off this morning." As soon as the words left his mouth, Song Da immediately knew it was inappropriate, and his face turned pale instantly.

Liao Sanniang smiled faintly, tossed the lock of hair on the ground casually, and said softly, "Brother Song, pretending to be a ransomer to scare and blackmail the victim's relatives—if sent to the officials, who knows how many bamboo beatings you will suffer and how much jail time you will serve?"

Song Da's face was instantly covered with cold sweat. His hanging fingertips trembled slightly. His face became iron-blue and gradually distorted. He looked around and saw Liao Sanniang was closest to him and was a weak woman. He suddenly roared, "Kidnap this woman! Hold her hostage to rush out!"

The big man named Wang San beside Song Da pulled out a *jiewan* dagger from his waist, roared, and charged with the knife.

Liao Sanniang grabbed the cloak behind her and waved it in the air. The dark red cloak churned into a vertical red vortex in the center of the hall. Just as the vortex unfolded, it contracted suddenly towards the center, swallowing Wang San's arm holding the knife, wrapping tightly around both the blade and his right arm.

Liao Sanniang placed her right foot forward and left foot back. She put out her left hand to grab Wang San's right hand wrapped in the cloak, and her right hand grabbed Wang San's left wrist, pulling outward to give him the illusion that his arm was being pulled outward.

Wang San resisted and pulled back. Liao Sanniang suddenly reversed the force and twisted back against the momentum, pinning both of Wang San's arms together and bunching them on the right side of his body, making his body tilt and his hands inseparable.

Liao Sanniang immediately pivoted her left foot back, stepped and turned to the left rear, cutting in front of Wang San's chest with her back. She released her right hand from Wang San's wrist, supported his knee, pulled with her left hand, lifted with her right hand, bent her waist and arched her back. Using her waist and back as a fulcrum, she arched her buttocks to exert force, carrying Wang San vertically upside down on her back and throwing him towards Song Da with inertia.

Wang San's body was smashed heavily onto the ground. The blue brick floor was the best weapon. Wang San was slammed onto his back by the huge slab formed by the blue stone brick surface with a crash. He felt even his skeleton was shattered. He rolled his eyes, coughed twice, and fainted.

Little Bazi on the side cheered loudly, "Sanniangzi's Godly Wrestling!"

Little Bazi wanted to step forward to help after shouting, but was held back by a big hand behind him. He looked back and saw Li Rufeng shaking his head, saying, "Sanniangzi has been stifled badly these two days. Let her play and disperse her mood."

Song Da was blocked by the thrown Wang San. Liu Wu on the side rushed to the front instead. He reached out and grabbed the front of Liao Sanniang's clothes at the chest.

Liao Sanniang collapsed her chest, relaxing her muscles to buffer the impact and dissipate the incoming force. She put out her left hand to grab Liu Wu's clothes at the right shoulder and her right hand to drag the upper part of Liu Wu's cross-collar. Exerting force with both arms simultaneously, she dragged and pressed towards her left/downward. That Liu Wu originally thought of "attacking directly when meeting weakness," wanting to hug Liao Sanniang tight with brute force. Unexpectedly, this woman had such immense strength that he became the weaker party instead. His head went dizzy instantly, and the offense and defense of the situation reversed immediately.

Under the dragging of giant force, Liu Wu's body tilted violently. To maintain balance, Liu Wu subconsciously stiffened in the opposite direction. Unexpectedly, Liao Sanniang loosened her hands, borrowing his counter-stiffening force to pull in the opposite direction, while using the outer edge of her left foot to flick outward against the inside of the big man's right foot, intending to kick Liu Wu's right foot off the ground.

Liu Wu reacted extremely fast. His right leg curled upward, avoiding Liao Sanniang's bottom foot kicking outward. But at this time, Liu Wu only had his left foot for support, and his body was slightly unstable. He leaned forward and grabbed Liao Sanniang's lapel with both hands, trying hard to maintain his body balance.
