# Chapter 2640: Temple Festival Opera (Part 2)

Tea-picking Opera on stage at this time just entering climax. That Clown Role Duke (*Gong Ye*), sometimes doing Dwarf Step circling around Flower Role (*Hua Dan*), sometimes carrying a long bench performing crawling fully on stage. Teasing surrounding villagers laughing haha loudly. That Flower Role playing Third Lady was even more incredible. Not only posture graceful, eyes containing autumn waves, singing tune was also clear incomparable. Flower handkerchief in hand flying up and down. Like a flower butterfly flipping dancing on stage. Once Flower Role opened mouth, villagers shouted Good not stopping mouth. In hand having some idle money villagers also one after another threw copper coins onto stage. Every time copper coins landing ground, that Flower Role made a coquettish eye glancing towards that direction. A look of coquettish appearance. Attracting cheers repeatedly even more.

Golden Pig knew this performed *Third Lady Teasing Duke*. Telling story of romantic pretty widow Third Lady teasing lecherous Duke. At this time just started watch. Singing still counted as disciplined. Just singing acting coquettish. Arriving second watch night deep, then what obscene lyrics erotic tunes all came up. If quantity of copper coins thrown on stage enough, let alone coquettish eye, even bolder "Performance" also had. Sometimes performing performing, Dan Role changed person. Not asking knowing went to where. All were matters villagers farmers loved to hear and see.

Therefore after starting watch women children intermittently went back. Family disciplining strictly, implicating unmarried youths also wanted to call back. Avoiding watching "Spirit Not Guarding Residence."

Golden Pig couldn't care what "Coquettish." Just finding family in crowd. Li Family Enclosure was place of Li Surname Ancestral Hall of nearby several villages. Temple Festival Opera handled every year was biggest. So every time attracted nearby various places villagers early supporting old carrying young coming to watch. At this time under stage long already surrounded inside three layers outside three layers. Nearby trees, earth enclosing buildings also sat full of people. He feared people many crowded, letting Old Mother and wife have what mishap.

Squeezing coming squeezing going in crowd. No more than a moment squeezed full head big sweat. One round down still trace completely none. Could it be already went back? While hesitating, actually heard Lian Niang calling own name. Looking following voice actually saw wife and mother were at crowd outer periphery, almost arriving on platform foundation of Earth Grain Temple. Lian Niang while looking at self shouting repeatedly, while waving handkerchief in hand repeatedly.

Golden Pig just squeezed to near Lian Niang and Mother. Not in time to ask yet, in crowd suddenly someone shouted high: "Aiya! Fairy Huang shows divine power~"

Crowd followed what that person pointed, looked towards mid-air. Exactly that big star emitting threads of red light. This time paying attention, looking carefully for half while again, only then discovered, there hazily had a human figure. Full three four *zhang* high. Hand holding a lantern. Originally thought being starlight, was candle fire inside that lantern. That person was holding lantern, riding cloud fog floating floating shaking shaking in mid-air. In trance, that lantern seemed red. This isn't Fairy Huang, still could be what person?

Fairy Huang responded to every plea. Her big name long spread all over this four *li* eight townships. Immediately had people bowing kneeling on threshing ground. Someone hitting head, others also followed kneeling bowing. One after another followed chanting: "Fairy Huang shows divine power, Fairy Huang shows divine power." Even Opera Troupe on stage didn't perform anymore. Peddlers didn't hawk anymore. One after another followed kneeling bowing.

Golden Pig felt someone pulling his lower hem. Lowering head looking, Lian Niang one hand supporting own old mother kneeling on ground, one hand grabbing his clothes hem. Golden Pig had to also follow kneeling down. While bowing, while stealing eye looking at Fairy Huang in mid-air.

Only seeing that Fairy Huang riding cloud head, overlooking kneeling villagers farmers in mid-air. Didn't open mouth passing law either. Passed half while, inside that lantern suddenly lit up a fire point again. Not a moment burned into a fire line, pouncing towards ground directly. This change caused kneeling crowd below a patch of uproar. Only heard someone high voice mumbling: "Samadhi True Fire! Samadhi True Fire!" Crowd again buzzing communicating: "Really is Samadhi True Fire. Fairy Huang's divine power severe."

Eye seeing that fire line burned to under a small hill outside village. Following closely there rose fire light. Crowd rose body one after another, surging towards place rising fire light. Running to near, only then discovered, this place was a nameless small temple long years lacking repair. People arriving first already extinguished fire. Still counted as timely. Just burned away some curtains window lattices. Offering table incense table inside room long knocked over on ground.

Someone ignored remaining heat inside room, rummaging inside temple looking for something. Not a moment used a piece of broken cloth padding holding out a smoke smoked fire distinct object. Mouth still shouting: "All come look, all come look, this is a what?" Saying, he used that broken cloth wiped that object. Crowd only then saw clearly that object was a Cast Iron Pagoda cast by pig iron. One *chi* coming high. That person hand holding Iron Pagoda, looking flipping coming covering going. Suddenly shouted again: "This on top still has words, still has words ah!" Crowd heard this Iron Pagoda on top had words, couldn't help more curious. One after another surrounded forward a few steps again.

Beside helping fire fighting Eight Immortals Society Second Senior Apprentice Ma Jin seemed recognizing characters. Took over Iron Pagoda. Borrowing bright light of torch looked a few eyes. Then read loudly: "Li Guangyuan, Li Guangyuan, Jade Emperor sends you to guard four directions. Sending you Treasure Pagoda as token, appointing you Pagoda-Bearing Li Heavenly King. Whoever doesn't listen to your words, wishing kill wishing chop reason should."

In crowd had people started discussing:

"This must be Master Li leading big guys raising altar in village, wanting to catch Kun Demon. Jade Emperor sees he dares to do, only then appointed him."

"Since Jade Emperor issued Decree, seems this matter accurate to succeed. Uncle Li also got appointed god—isn't this appointing him 'Pagoda-Bearing Li Heavenly King'?"

"Truly if like this, afterwards we as long as following Master working well, accurately have good reward."

"This Iron Pagoda, is Treasure Jade Emperor bestowed to Patriarch. Let's send to Patriarch quickly."

Crowd nodded one after another. Clustering Ma Jin hand holding Iron Pagoda. Returned to front of Li Guangyuan's manor courtyard again. Ma Jin held Iron Pagoda high over top. Kneeling at Li Family gate. High voice shouted: "Li Heavenly King, Li Heavenly King, Jade Emperor sent you Demon Suppressing Pagoda! Li Heavenly King, come out quickly to accept Treasure Pagoda."

Crowd also all kneeled behind Ma Jin. Followed loudly echoing: "Li Heavenly King, accept Treasure Pagoda!"

Golden Pig also kneeled in crowd. He was shocked by these various divine miracles brain muddy muddy nightmares. Involuntary followed everyone shouting together: "Li Heavenly King, accept Treasure Pagoda!"

Not much time, Li Heavenly King—Li Guangyuan then came out under clustering of a group of people. Face still had some ignorance. Few days ago, Fairy Huang when looking at face for him said to him, between his eyebrows had a few portions of Immortal Qi (*Xian Qi*). Just needing opportunity could Obtain Dao. Also pulled quite some Eight Immortals stories for him. Said this opportunity was most Wonderful Not Speakable. Anyway as long as doing good deeds more, doing things gods approved, definitely had opportunity arriving. Didn't expect this opportunity actually came so fast. Looking at full village folks kneeling in front of face, he suddenly had a feeling of Heaven Mandate In Me. Whole body up down suddenly had strength unable to use finish. As if self returned to appearance of Volatizing Fang Qiu (Commanding heavily) imagining self succeeded Li Surnamed Patriarch when just reached Weak Crown (20 years old) back then.

Li Guangyuan took over Iron Pagoda presented by Ma Jin. Holding it high in front of chest. Instantaneously, highest tide of Li Family Enclosure Temple Festival Opera, bloomed in front of main gate of Li Residence.

This scene of Li Family Enclosure, very fast spread all over nearby various villages various markets. Implicating County City also heard. Folks of nearby various villages received incitement of charlatans scattered in various places. One after another swarmed to Li Family Enclosure to "Worship God."

Small Temple "Discovering" Iron Pagoda now repaired refreshing new. Li Guangyuan Iron Pagoda offered inside. Because everywhere had people inciting bewitching in dark, folks going to offer incense daily uncountable. Ash in incense burner too late to clean. Daily incense smoke spiraling, how not lively. As for Merit Box, daily stuffed full by offered money goods. Implicating offered grain, dim sum, flowers fruits, cloth, silk... piled full on two sides eaves corridor of small temple.

Li Family also propped up cool shed under tree beside small temple. Built earth stove. Supplying meals and "Divine Medicine" to people coming to worship god. For a time news of Li Guangyuan being "Immortal" descending to world walked without shin (spread fast). Clamor dust up.

This eye seeing wanting to rain. Lian Niang while tidying vegetable leaves, while stealing eye looking at own man building shed together with Corpsmen—Pilgrims coming more and more. Original shed not enough to use. Wanting to build new one again.

Man now entered Eight Immortals Society. Not needing to go far door. Daily only needing to drill half day. Doing some miscellaneous work had a share of regular allowance. If additionally doing some other miscellaneous work, still had reward. This was much more relaxed than tired dead tired live going to Xiaoyao Market to do short term job.

Golden Pig became Corpsman, implicating Lian Niang also obtained benefit. Because Pilgrims numerous, steward then allocated Lian Niang to temple to help kitchen. Although no wage, but eating no need money. Evening finished tidying still could share some left rice left dishes. Implicating mother-in-law's meals also resolved. Every month could save a huge sum of Chewing Grain (food expense) again. She secretly calculated in heart, like this using not a few months she could save some money out again.

Since arriving stove to help kitchen, implicating Fairy Huang was also polite to her a few portions. Even her continuing cultivating magic also didn't need money. This was saving one Yuan again! Lian Niang these days heart was all happy *zizi*—this was best days since she married Golden Pig. She now only prayed Fairy Huang could live long in Li Family Enclosure always. Patriarch family also always lead to handle this Eight Immortals Society down how good that would be! Just man too stubborn. Lian Niang advised man several times to go to Fairy Huang place to bow bow. Beg a safe talisman. After all daily not knife is gun. Having a talisman of Fairy Huang was more steady. Who knew that man just "Heng", "Ha" agreed a sound turning head then forgot. Speaking him much, just made black a face staring eyes scaring people. Also didn't know how Fairy Huang offended him.

Lian Niang thinking, as long as self conceived, own man and Fairy Huang this section of inexplicable hatred at that time always could resolve. After all at that time man wanted to go to Fairy Huang to return rite. Just now talisman water also drank. Kung Fu method Fairy Huang passed to her also dare not delay. Belly however didn't see improvement. Once she secretly went to ask women cultivating magic conceiving together in village. All advised her this matter don't anxious: Heart sincere then spirit. Time arrived opportunity would come.
