# Chapter 2555 - Paper Cotton Aftermath

These issues weren't just Chu He and Ren Youzi's views—they essentially reflected the opinion of many in the Law Society. They believed that current commercial law was incomplete, and rashly implementing these entirely new systems and regulations would cause unforeseeable consequences. However, this series of reforms had also received support from many Elders in administrative departments.

"...This system is currently being piloted. But I don't think the pilot results will be good. Whether some clever people will exploit the loopholes in this paper cotton incident is really hard to say..."

"If this actually causes some kind of financial storm..." Li Shan said.

"There definitely won't be a financial storm, unless something happens to the Nanyang Company," Chu He laughed. "Currently, all private financial activity in Guangzhou is quite limited both in variety and volume. There can't be any huge waves. You can rest easy. Someone will definitely jump off a rooftop over the paper cotton incident, but overall there won't be any major problems. What I'm more worried about now is your cotton textile industry—this affair will definitely affect you."

"Sigh, I had the same premonition. The paper cotton incident has exposed a major weakness of ours," Zou Biao said. "To be honest, I'm now somewhat losing confidence in our cotton textile industry plans..."

"The raw material supply issue certainly won't be solved overnight, but when the British built their cotton textile industry, cotton plantations didn't exist either. Demand stimulated supply, not the other way around. As long as demand is large enough, land capitalists—or landlords, if you will—will set up plantations themselves. I'm not worried about that," Li Shan said with considerable confidence. "The key is to bring down cotton spinning costs. Market cloth prices are still too high right now."

"Actually, based on your machine-woven cloth costs, once the several major procurement sources shrink, cotton cloth prices will fall dramatically. Soon individual textile households will find no profit to be made. As for whether you're willing to squeeze them all into bankruptcy, that depends on your specific policies going forward. But except for the enterprises you're focused on supporting, individual operators will probably all go under..."

That evening, personally commanded by Mu Min, police raided the Qingyun Teahouse and related cotton-cloth merchants. Subsequently, fifty-eight individuals involved in the matter were all arrested.

According to the final police statistics, the total value involved in the entire paper cotton affair was nearly 170,000 yuan. For Guangzhou, this was an astonishing figure.

Fortunately, as Chu He and the others had estimated, because there was no leverage, it didn't cause much impact on Guangzhou's financial order. But the victims were far more widespread than they had estimated. Many victims had later heard that paper cotton could "make big money" and had organized rotating credit groups to participate—essentially pooled investment. The number of people involved was extremely large. Preliminary statistics showed over two thousand people, most with amounts involved of no more than two or three yuan, some even just one yuan.

Most of these people were poor, and many had taken over at the peak as the last ones holding the bag. Their losses were devastating. For a time, the municipal bureau's courtyard was packed with people coming to register. Cries and wails filled the air. Some fainted on the spot. Then came news of people throwing themselves into the river... It drove Mu Min to grind her teeth in fury.

Watching this scene, Mu Min was seething. She gave Chu and Ren, who had come to handle the aftermath, a thorough tongue-lashing, saying everyone in finance was a "rotten bunch." She even roped Li Shan into the scolding.

"...This, this—it has nothing to do with me. I didn't create paper cotton..."

"If you hadn't stirred up this International Market business, would any of this have happened!"

Li Shan protested his innocence, saying he'd never had such advanced ideas as creating a futures market.

"I don't care whether you're advanced or backward. So cleaning up the mess isn't your department's job either? Each of you is expert at sitting around theorizing. If you don't help sort this out properly, don't bother coming to Guangzhou for your 'official business' anymore. My place can't accommodate you great Buddhas!"

Chu He's face was rather stiff. Coming here only to get a head-on scolding—nobody would find that pleasant. But Ren Youzi kept a smile plastered on his face and said: "Yes, yes, we'll definitely handle everything properly! Don't worry—we do have a plan for the specifics..."

Ren Youzi immediately explained the relevant plan.

"The 170,000 yuan case value isn't fictional. By my rough estimate, about 70,000 yuan worth of warehouse receipts can ultimately be honored. As long as we keep control of the cotton-cloth merchant owners and don't let them escape—the cotton-cloth merchants still need to keep operating..."

"Keep operating? I was thinking of confiscating their property to compensate those ordinary people's losses!"

"Only if they keep operating will there be any chance of compensating the ordinary people. Otherwise they just declare bankruptcy and wipe out their debts."

Mu Min's eyebrows rose slightly. She seemed about to say something but held back.

"...Additionally, the assets of these fifty-eight individuals can also cover part of the shortfall," Ren Youzi said rather carefully. "For example, this Qingyun Teahouse owner, Wu Yuanyin, claims he didn't participate, but actually he's just like a casino owner—he took a cut of every transaction. Press him and there'll definitely be some fat to squeeze out. As for those who issued fictitious warehouse receipts, this batch is on Political Security's internal watch list. None of them can escape. Once the stolen funds are recovered, it should be mostly covered..."

"Even so, it won't cover the shortfall. Just look at this courtyard full of people."

"We have a repayment proposal that overall favors small and medium-sized victims. This way, we can effectively stabilize the general public."

Mu Min looked at the relevant plan and calmed down somewhat. But she asked: "The final delivery will probably be problematic though. Many people who bought warehouse receipts have no connection to the cotton textile industry—they bought purely to speculate. Even if the cotton-cloth merchants give them physical delivery in the end, what use do they have for cotton bought at inflated prices?"

"They can go directly to the International Market and sell the spot cotton there. Maybe by then the price will be even higher."

Mu Min shook her head repeatedly: "That's not guaranteed. More likely prices will be even lower."

Chu He said helplessly: "That's beyond our control. Frankly speaking, these outsiders participating in paper cotton trading were just speculating to get rich quick. 'If you gamble, accept your losses' as the saying goes. Besides, we didn't come up with this scheme. Coming forward to resolve it is already tremendous benevolence on our part. Sigh, this is just the tragedy of the petty bourgeoisie."

At the Temple of the Five Immortals in Guangzhou, a new sign had recently been hung: the Shen'ao Study Society.

Though the pronunciation was similar, this "Ao" wasn't the Olympic "Ao"—so the "Shen" in Shen'ao expressed the meaning of "explaining, expounding." In other words, this was a place for conveying Australian conditions and Australian learning to the local natives.

Its founder was Du Yibin, whom quite a few Elders teased for having a "notable person collecting habit." This civilian organization he had initiated in Guangzhou was mainly used for winning over old-style literati who could accept certain new ideas.

However, he wasn't stationed in Guangzhou, so it was hard for him to maintain long-term attention to this institution. After all, running a society required funds, space, and staff. As an Elder in an administrative post elsewhere, he couldn't attend to everything and didn't have the resources. So he consulted with Cui Hantang, who had similar ideas, asking for his "assistance."

Elder Cui, for his part, already had the same idea. The two hit it off immediately. The sign was hung at the Temple of the Five Immortals. Cui Yunhong now had a proper base for conducting united front work with local intellectuals, avoiding accusations from certain Elders of "spreading feudal superstition" under false pretenses.

The Shen'ao Study Society occupied a small side courtyard within the Temple of the Five Immortals. It had been redecorated and rearranged inside. The main hall was converted into a teahouse for scholarly discussion. The east wing housed a reading room—one could borrow from the Temple's rich collection of Australian books and read there. Many of these couldn't be borrowed out, particularly the large collection of "civil service exam" preparation materials, which were favorites of many failed examination candidates. The west wing was set up as an "exhibition hall," with some simple models and scientific instruments, along with many scientific wall charts. The gatehouse served as the society's office and storeroom. Small as a sparrow but with all the vital organs.

After opening, the society gradually attracted quite a few people. Besides scholars hoping to find a place in the new government and new system, there were also many students curious about the Australians and Australian learning. Many came here daily to engage in scholarly discussion and read newspapers, magazines, and books. Because many people here had direct or indirect connections with the Australians, many treated this place as the primary channel for gathering insider information about the Australians. Cui Hantang welcomed all without discrimination, treating everyone warmly.

Today, the hottest topic of discussion at the Shen'ao Study Society was the paper cotton incident.

Most people found paper cotton, this new phenomenon, quite novel, so the discussion was rather lively. The paper cotton incident had received a full page of special reporting in the *Yangcheng Express*, analyzing the causes, consequences, and key details thoroughly. All the way to the final resolution plan, every detail was laid out. So the discussion had much more substance and far less wild speculation. Most scholars' views were similar: paper cotton was something for "opportunistic profiteering," a "source of endless trouble" for nation and people alike, and should be completely banned.

Those with more knowledge brought up the "mulberry tree futures" practice in Jiangnan, arguing this was the same thing. As long as government oversight was strong and fictitious warehouse receipts were banned, buying and selling paper cotton wasn't necessarily bad—it could hedge against future raw material price increases.

As everyone was debating, suddenly someone asked: "It's been a while since we've seen Zhang Jiayu. Do any of you know where he went?"

"Now that you mention it, it's been several days since he came. He used to come every two or three days!"

Someone said: "I heard there was a family matter—he went back to his hometown in Dongguan."

"He's been gone so long—could something have happened at home?"

"I heard a close family member fell seriously ill, so he had to rush back," another said. "I saw him looking distraught when he left—I fear something unbearable has happened!"
