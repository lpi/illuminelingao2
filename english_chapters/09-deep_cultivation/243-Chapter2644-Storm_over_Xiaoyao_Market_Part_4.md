# Chapter 2644: Storm over Xiaoyao Market (Part 4)

Earth wall not high. Just high as one person. But adding bamboo fence, had more than one *zhang*. Upper end of fence all sharpened roasted hard. With interval still had one by one small window holes. Probably were cannon eyes. Below earth wall, surrounded moat again. Connecting with river water. On top of earth wall still set up multiple towers built by bamboo. On top had Kun Soldiers' figures shaking.

Luo Heying slightly knew military strategy. Knew this camp looked very crude, but these facilities matching a squad of elite soldiers, enough to resist siege of enemies of ten times above.

"Here have how many Kun Soldiers?"

"This, small one then doesn't know." Apprentice smiled apologetically, "But these working people usually all live in camp. Small few hundred people right."

"You are what fart words!" Li Guangyuan dissatisfied said, "Small few hundred people is how many people? They constructed built here for a month, have how many people you don't know?! Rice bucket!"

Apprentice full face wronged. Pawnshop rule extremely strict. Besides Shopkeeper could go out to socialize, apprentices were no difference with sitting jail. Food lodging all in pawnshop. Usually not allowed go out. In one month only First Fifteenth could ask leave to go out to bath hair cut. Also could only go come same day. Wanting to go home must have urgent matter only then approved leave. Don't say Australians came for more than one month, even coming for three five years he also had no way to know.

But at this moment East Owner scolded. Apprentice only had share of listening with low eyebrows pleasing eyes. Waiting until Master Li played finish prestige, only then low voice said: "Small ones usually are not allowed out of shop. But, heard idlers coming to shop say, people living inside not few. Unloading goods time, whole bag whole bag big rice transporting inside..."

"Oh, this rice is transported from where? Not supplied by Fan Family?"

"Heard is transported by Kun People's own business house. Fan Family only supplies vegetables to Kun People."

Li Guangyuan snorted a sound. Besides despising, heart actually still had some envy. Kun Thieves were blind eyes! Unexpectedly mixed together with Fan Xiao this Hakka Fellow!

Luo Hetu didn't know Master Li's inner activity. Just cared looking at camp. Half while then opened mouth said: "Here have any climbing high place? I want to look at Kun Thieves camp interior."

Apprentice face revealed difficult color, said: "Nearby actually has a Literary Pagoda (*Wen Ta*). Just distant from here still some distance. Climbing up also can't look clear."

Luo Heying said: "No hindrance. Master has Thousand Li Mirror. You just lead road."

Apprentice led road. Bringing leaving Xiaoyao Market. Walking again field ridge again small road for a good while. Only then came to a high hillock beside river branch.

Here indeed stood a Literary Pagoda. Although shape and structure similar, but this kind of pagoda was not "Stupa" (*Fu Tu*) on Buddhist significance. But built out of Feng Shui significance. Scale size not uniform. Some couldn't be climbed. But this one shape structure very small. Middle actually had stairs could go up down.

Just area of every floor too small. Three people arrived pagoda top with smallest area almost face pasting face. Looking out from small window, blurry could see distant Kun Thieves barracks. Luo Heying took out telescope looking carefully.

Only saw this Kun Thieves' camp roughly showed rectangle. Middle had a small earth hill. Looking carefully, this earth hill was only commanding height near New Pier.

Fortifications of four sides, generally same two as observing from outside. Behind wall body set up ladders and scaffoldings for climbing high shooting. On empty ground unexpectedly still bad cannons.

Although only two small cannons. Purely by armaments speaking, this camp already counted as solid as gold soup (*Gu Ruo Jin Tang* - impregnable). Luo Heying secretly heart startled. This Kun Thieves setting dense defense here so, had what intention?

Looking inside camp again. Houses all were long strip style. Arranged neatly. And on open spacious place placed several strange looking strange looking objects. All covered by curtain cloth. Didn't know are what. Couldn't help asking: "That is what object? Just under cloth curtain."

Apprentice took over telescope looked. Hesitated moment only then said: "According to rumor is Australian Iron Steel Beast. When using want to feed full coal mud first. Casting spell making Giant Beast violent. Then Kun Person enters into iron cage on Giant Beast back to drive. Heard this Giant Beast belongs to Earth Nature. Whole body hit with Refined Iron Shackles cast by Australian secret method. Every time exerting force is roaring shaking heaven. Strength big incomparable. Especially good at digging earth moving mountain. When Giant Beast walks like thundering generally. If letting these Giant Beasts break free shackles, that terrible. Giant Beast immediately will drill into underground, attracting radius several tens *li* earth moving not peaceful. This Kun Soldier's camp is all built by help of these Giant Beasts. merely short few days then completed."

"Oh, this Long House can live how many people?"

"Small one also not too clear. Only heard laborers recruited by Kun People say in Long House put are all two-layer beds. A room Long House probably can live fifty people around right."

Luo Heying carefully counted quantity of Long Houses. Kun people living permanently in camp about two hundred people up down. Although majority should be laborers, soldiers wouldn't be too many. But Laborers issued knife gun also could fight kill. This stockade usually really couldn't take down.

Three people came down from tower. Returned into Pawnshop. Luo Heying asked: "You just now said that land is Feng Shui Treasure Land. Families buried there had producing three Cultivated Talents. Are all what families?"

Still not waiting for apprentice open mouth, Li Guangyuan smiled: "Brother Luo! You stop listening to this Killing Talent (*Sha Cai*) speaking nonsense blindly! That river beach is Charity Land. Buried there, if not poor people body without place to stick awl, then is Road Fallen (corpse) from nowhere. Family able to produce Cultivated Talent how can make grave there... Still Feng Shui Treasure Land. Vicious Evil Land still almost."

Apprentice awkwardly smiling, said: "Master, small one also listened others saying so."

Luo Heying however was calculating inside this matter had usable place. If Kun Thieves truly dug people's ancestral graves, this matter actually could limitlessly utilize a round. But if just cleared away Charity Cemetery Land, speaking truth had no what oil water. He thought a bit then proposed opening a shop near New Pier.

"This is easy. Land there cheap no more." Li Guangyuan full mouth agreed, "Let Shopkeeper Wu come out to handle is fine."

"House not need big. Cruder one better. I plan to open a Tea Rice Shop." Luo Heying said, "At that time still trouble you introduce a few people to do work."

"Small matter one pile. All on my body!"

Not a few days, near New Pier, a Tea Rice Shop crude to even without brand name opened. Said shop, actually only one room as kitchen. On waste land built up reed mat shed. Under shed put down crude table chairs then counted as opened.

Crude returned to crude. Business here was not bad. Luo Heying was for spying news, not for earning money. So price cheap. Beside also had Australians' big construction site. Besides core workers, large amount subcontract workers were all recruited locally. Australians didn't manage meal. This Rice Shop once opened then market before door (many customers) because of object beautiful price cheap.

This Luo Heying also truly put down status. Personally served as a miscellaneous work buddy in this Rice Shop. Daily carrying water chopping wood. Busy inside busy outside. Tightly staring at this Australian construction.

He knowing Australians quite some, after seeing defense didn't extravagantly hope able to smoothly break camp. But, "Above" said, as long as able to lift a wild tide of Anti-Kun Thieves here, attracting Kun Thieves' attention is fine.

He slightly knew military strategy. Naturally understood this was Sound East Strike West strategy. Breaking camp or not didn't matter. But he still held thought of wanting to break camp.

He such using heart, removing National Hatred Family Hate, also contained dream of flying yellow rising reach (rapid promotion). Because Taoist Wood Stone already said, if could take a True Kun Thief's head this time, directly could award Fifth Rank Military Post; Beheading and capturing a Fake Kun High Executive, reward Seventh Rank Military Post. This to Luo Heying who only shallowly tasted flavor of "Degree" was huge temptation.

And just now in apprentice's words already revealed an important information. This place was Kun Thieves' important construction place. Often had True Kun or important Fake Kun coming here to inspect. If could break stockade behead kill him, this merit...

Thinking here, his heart hot dried a few portions again.

From conversation of hired workers coming here to eat, Luo Heying understood more information.

Turning out Fake Kuns in this camp not many. Besides thirty names Fake Kun Soldiers garrisoning, following engineering progress time more time less. Frequently would change. Many time had thirty-plus people. Few time only had ten-plus people. However Fake Kuns all had craftsmanship. Some could drive that Iron Monster; Some could position Feng Shui; Some understood building house repairing road...

Although people few, but dwellings inside camp actually many. Removing Long House and Warehouse he saw on tower, still building many other houses. Unknown specific usage.

As for True Kun not permanent resident. About a month would come one two. All were having "Technology." Coming a few days then leave. As long as seeing Japanese Pirate Samurai wearing Iron Bamboo Hat or Korean Soldiers wearing big hat wearing white clothes arrival, that was True Kun came.

As for usage of camp, said to be Kun Thieves' "Yamen." But exactly was which level Yamen no one could say clear. Said this "Yamen" differed from ordinary Yamen again. Besides levying tax and Circuit Court trying cases, still wanted to do "Promotion." Said was wanting to teach everyone raising silkworm reeling silk what. Also wanted to run school in town. Open warehouse. Build workshop. Afterwards just men entering workshop, women raising silkworm reeling silk, children all go to school. Everyone has job. Everyone can live good days...

Luo Heying frequently hearing these only secretly funny. This Kun Thieves' words you also take true! Since ancient times had Man Above Man, then bad Man Below Man. Even if everyone passed good days, naturally would have people passing better days—Just right now Kun Thieves whether could let common people eat full rice all hard to say. True is blowing cow skin not need pay tax...

"What Yamen! You all idle chatting nonsense! Under heaven where has building Yamen like this!" A middle-aged fellow sneered, "You understand a fart!"

"You understand a fart. You come say!" Crowd not convinced.

"I just tell you. Australians are practicing Geomancy Art (*Kan Yu Shu*) here. Doing Feng Shui Bureau. Not wanting to break Great Ming's Dragon Qi, then is wanting to Seek Dragon Point Cave, building Tomb..."

Luo Heying a daze. He really didn't think about this matter. Although saying somewhat false absurd. But had to say not impossible either. Kun Thieves after landing, hundred matters hundred smooth. Never frustration. No matter dangerous crisis all could be muddled over by them. Maybe really learned some secret method of Feng Shui Geomancy. Broke Great Ming's King Qi.
