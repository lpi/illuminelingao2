# Chapter 2553 - The Full Story

"Elder Ren and I started paying attention to this paper cotton business shortly after it first appeared. We even visited the Qingyun Teahouse, that primitive futures exchange. And I should mention that Comrade Wu Mu also planted a few people inside—of course, he wasn't doing it to prevent financial risks, purely out of concern that there might be some conspiracy behind it," Chu He said.

"Overall, this affair isn't anything special. It's just a bizarre product born from the confluence of market volatility and human greed. Very interesting, very valuable for research."

Li Shan was getting tired of listening. He thought to himself: This guy's rambling is completely out of hand!

Chu He explained that the origins of the paper cotton incident actually predated the International Market's opening by quite a bit. It had started at the beginning of this year.

"...The trigger was actually very simple. Rising demand for cotton cloth caused market prices to rise, followed by a chain reaction of increases in cotton yarn and raw cotton prices."

Ever since the Senate had liberated Guangzhou, demand for cotton cloth had been expanding year after year. With the successive occupation of Guangdong and Guangxi and the continuous establishment of government organs, various northward-relocating and newly-built agencies and factories were all expanding. The naturalized citizen class was also rapidly growing. Demand for uniforms had increased dramatically.

Originally, this demand increase had been relatively gradual. But the emergence of the Nanyang Company changed this phenomenon.

The Nanyang Company's biggest project was the Southern Yue Development Plan. For this, they would conduct the largest expeditionary operation since Operation Engine. They planned to send over twenty thousand migrants to the Southern Yue region, with another ten thousand per year for the following five years.

The food and materials needed for migration on this scale could only be described as oceanic. Especially the basic necessity of cotton cloth. Although the Nanyang Company had adopted a small-batch, multi-batch purchasing approach to avoid destabilizing the market with large purchases, cotton cloth prices had still risen in response—and once they started rising at the beginning of the year, they kept rising until now.

To be honest, Li and Zou's optimism about the cotton textile industry had been significantly influenced by this bull market.

"...These are the figures from the *Commercial Monthly Report* published by the Statistics Department since last October. We copied out the statistics relating to the cotton textile industry—I should note that the figures aren't necessarily precise, but they give a rough picture of the situation. Cotton yarn transaction volumes were too small to count, but the prices and transaction volumes of cotton and cloth have been rising month by month. The increases this year have been even larger. Using last October's average price as the baseline, the monthly increases in November, December, and January each exceeded 5%. By February it became a runaway horse—cotton cloth monthly increases exceeded 7.5%, and by March reached 10%. If we hadn't increased Songjiang cotton cloth imports, the cloth price increases would have been even greater—even so, this May's cotton cloth prices compared to last October show an average increase exceeding 50%. That's quite an alarming figure."

The reasons were: first, the Nanyang Company had accelerated its overseas development pace and needed to stockpile more clothing, tents, and other cotton products; second, the Two Guangs campaign was entering its final phase. The hastily organized National Army needed comprehensive reorganization, and the Bōbō Army needed rest and recovery. Their uniforms all needed replacing—military supplies alone involved over a hundred thousand sets of uniforms.

Besides the military, the Nanyang Company, and scattered government procurement, there was another key factor: inflation.

Since the Senate had issued new currency in Guangzhou, Silver Dollar Certificates had been continuously increasing in circulation. The fiscal and financial system had maintained basic credit for the Silver Dollar Certificates through various means. However, inflation wasn't something that bent to human will. Prices quietly rose across society.

Fortunately, basic necessities in this era were limited. The Senate, through its unique long-distance communication and transportation capabilities, could quickly grasp grain situations in various regions and rapidly stabilize grain prices, thus maintaining overall stability.

"So the surge in cotton products is actually also closely related to inflation..."

"Exactly. One reason is supply-demand imbalance, the other is inflation," Ren Youzi nodded. "You could put it this way: the current market prosperity and high prices are actually hollow. If you look at the relevant reports, you'll see that the biggest customer in the market right now is the Senate itself. And this kind of bulk purchasing won't continue for long. The Nanyang Company has already begun reducing its purchase volume this month, and then Joint Logistics' purchases will also shrink. In the long run, the cotton textile market will experience a recession period. For new growth, the only option is probably to focus on cotton cloth exports."

"Crushing Indian cloth and Songjiang cloth."

"Exactly. The current cotton shortage is actually precisely because these two behemoths are still alive and kicking, intercepting raw cotton upstream." Chu He said, "Let's continue with the main topic."

Because cotton cloth prices rose, raw cotton prices rose with the tide. Supply became tight. Originally, the cotton and cloth merchants had been supplying cotton to the market. Cotton-cloth merchants frequently encountered "price but no goods" situations, with cotton supply intermittent. To ensure their weavers had cloth to weave, cloth stores began paying in advance and purchasing warehouse receipts.

Initially, this advance payment practice was simply a commercial deposit—the buyer paid a deposit for a certain amount of cotton. After delivery, they'd settle the balance according to the market rate minus the deposit and take possession. It was simply a commitment made by buyers to secure their supply.

Gradually, some people spotted the speculative potential. Thus, the first full-payment advance purchase receipt was born. Advance purchase receipts weren't settled at the delivery-time price with balance payment, but paid in full at current market rates, with delivery upon arrival of goods.

This practice was essentially about hedging against future price increases or supply disruptions—common in commerce. Not only did the Dutch do this, but silkworm farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang had similar operations.

"By rights, this wasn't anything new—just betting on future expected price movements. But somehow, some clever person came up with the idea of endorsable transfers," Chu He laughed. "I'd really like to meet this person and ask how they thought of it."

Once transfers became possible, these warehouse receipts acquired the properties of speculation and investment. Especially with raw cotton prices only going up, constantly rising—you could buy a receipt, mark it up, and flip it. You'd make money immediately.

Once this quick profit-making method was discovered, it immediately became the focus of speculation. For a time, all cotton-cloth merchants began selling warehouse receipts.

"At first, these receipts were still quite standardized. They had clear issuing firms, delivery dates, quantities and grades of cotton to be delivered. And when various cotton-cloth merchants first started, they still had some estimates—they had a rough idea of how much they could deliver in the future, so the number of receipts issued was still limited. But later, everyone saw this was easy money requiring no capital..."

Later it grew increasingly chaotic. Originally only cotton-cloth merchants issued receipts. As the speculative fever intensified, cloth stores, silk shops, embroidery shops... any shop related to textiles rushed to issue cotton warehouse receipts. Later came cotton yarn receipts too.

"...Now there are even people who just set up a name without even having a physical shop, claiming to be 'XX Warehouse' or 'XX Firm,' and issuing warehouse receipts—and somehow they can actually sell them! It reminds me of the Hainan Island real estate bubble in the 1990s. Back then, a land transfer contract would change hands for profits of hundreds of thousands..."

"Save that for later!" Li Shan was growing impatient. These two had such a clear grasp of the situation, yet they'd stood by watching until now? He couldn't criticize them directly, so he asked: "What should we do now?"

"Alright, so in short, the situation escalated," Chu He said. "By this point, all participants actually knew that the cotton they were trading had nothing whatsoever to do with actual cotton—or even with textiles. It had become pure speculation, a game of pass-the-parcel. It's just that everyone thought they wouldn't be the last one holding it."

"Does the Qingyun Teahouse closing mean the bubble has burst?"

"Very possibly," Ren Youzi nodded. "Though I don't know whether the Qingyun Teahouse owner will open for business again tomorrow or what the paper cotton market will look like, its collapse is certainly imminent."

The first reason was the arrival of three ships of Indian cotton spot goods, directly triggering the fall in spot cotton prices. Second, local new cotton would come to market in two or three months. Third, northern cotton-growing regions—especially the Jianghuai area—was expected to have a poor harvest. Under the double blow of military disasters and natural calamities, who would plant cotton there?

"By rights, the expected production decrease in northern cotton regions should further stimulate futures price increases. But everyone knows that the cotton that local cotton-cloth merchants can deliver mostly comes from Jianghuai cotton regions. If production there decreases, it means the cotton-cloth merchants simply won't have goods to deliver—that was the last straw that broke the camel's back," Ren Youzi said. "Although speculators all know they're just trading paper, once the illusory guarantee of 'future cotton' completely collapses, market confidence has utterly crumbled."

Chu He continued: "The Qingyun Teahouse owner made a fortune in this speculative trade. Suddenly closing now very likely means he realized the game can't continue. But the specifics will have to wait for Comrade Wu Mu's investigation results."

"So..."

"Right. Having Mu Min send police to you was a bit redundant. Guangzhou Political Security has been watching Qingyun Teahouse for a long time. He won't escape."

"That's good. My biggest concern was financial order disruption." Li Shan relaxed slightly. "But whether police or Political Security, they can't really manage financial order. How do you think this crisis should be handled?"
