# Chapter 2715: The Capital (Part 71)

"I'm glad you understand," Cao Sheng said.

Having reached this point in the conversation and exchanged proper courtesies, Min Zhanlian produced the cover story they had prepared. He explained that his people had been entrusted by a fallen political figure to gather "critical information" on a certain powerful court official in the capital.

"...Frankly speaking, I've already said too much. I must ask that you keep this confidential."

Cao Sheng's expression soured. Any matter involving court bigwigs could easily bring trouble upon oneself. "I naturally won't speak of your affairs," he said. "But the weather in the capital has been strange of late—who knows what ill winds might blow. You'd best be careful."

Min Zhanlian noted that this echoed what Third Master Qin in the outer city had told him. It seemed undercurrents were indeed roiling beneath the capital's surface.

He wanted to draw more information from the man, but Cao Sheng was unwilling to say more. He rose and took his leave.

Watching Cao Sheng depart, Min Zhanlian said in a low voice, "Little Five."

"Boss..."

"Take some men and tail Cao Sheng. See who he meets."

Since Cao Sheng had made a special trip to warn him, he was obviously acting on someone's behalf. He would certainly relay their response to his superior at the first opportunity. That person might very well be connected to Leng Ningyun's kidnapping.

Little Five had no name or surname—he was an orphan. He had been a pickpocket since childhood. At twelve, he apprenticed to a master and became a "flying thief," earning a minor reputation in the *Jianghu*. He was extremely cautious; most of the time he avoided showing his face, and no one knew his real name. The *Jianghu* knew him only as "Little Five."

When the Australians came to Lingao and transformed it into a prosperous place, Little Five had also arrived to "make his fortune." He hadn't expected to be caught on his very first job in Lingao, falling into the hands of the National Police. After many twists and turns, he was transferred from Police Section Ten to the Special Operations Team, where his talents for tailing and surveillance were put to use. He had two direct subordinates: one was an elderly man who looked ancient, and the other was a middle-aged woman who resembled a village wife.

Little Five nodded silently. He rarely showed his face and seldom spoke in crowded situations. In short, unless you paid special attention, you could hardly notice his presence.

"Little Qian, tomorrow go to the outer city again and sound out Third Master Qin."

Two days later, Little Five returned with news: first thing that morning, Cao Sheng had dispatched a trusted subordinate—one who handled important matters for him—to Tongzhou. Little Five left the old man to monitor Cao Sheng while he and the woman separately tailed the subordinate to Tongzhou. They watched him settle in at a teahouse called the Houyuan.

The Houyuan was also a teahouse frequented by *Jianghu* people. The man didn't wait long before someone who looked like a local ruffian arrived. The two spoke secretly at a table for quite some time. After they parted, Little Five kept his eyes on the ruffian while the old woman followed Cao Sheng's subordinate back—to see if he contacted anyone else along the way.

Little Five remained at the teahouse, covertly watching the ruffian for about half a *shichen*—roughly an hour—before the man left the Houyuan. Little Five followed quietly. He discovered where the man lived and easily learned all the details about him.

The man himself was nothing special—just a local ruffian in Tongzhou. But he had another identity: he was a hanger-on of a Brocade Guard school lieutenant at the local yamen, using the Brocade Guard's name to throw his weight around.

Hearing this, Min Zhanlian's eyes lit up. Didn't this match what Cao Sheng had said?

Little Five also sensed that this discovery held major value, so he stayed in Tongzhou to continue his surveillance. The next day, he returned to the Houyuan to drink tea. During that time, the ruffian met with four people.

"Here's the situation on these four. I inquired about each one. The most likely candidate is this Liu Sha." Little Five explained that the other three were either Tongzhou businessmen or local idlers—hangers-on and errand-runner types. Only Liu Sha had an unusual background.

"This man served in the Brocade Guard during the Tianqi era. After Wei Zhongxian's downfall, he lost his position. But later, somehow, he connected with some powerful family, doing their dirty work. His status is special. He frequently travels between the capital, Tongzhou, and Tianjin, and is well-acquainted with all sorts of people."

Min Zhanlian nodded to himself: this was it. Liu Sha was the most suspicious. For such a man to suddenly take interest in a group of *Jianghu* people coming to the capital "on business" could only mean he was guarding against something.

"Where is this man now?"

"Still in Tongzhou. He has a house there where he keeps a woman—probably a mistress." Little Five said he had discreetly inquired through neighbors and learned that Liu Sha came once or twice a month, staying two or three days each time, without any fixed schedule. But recently, he had been in Tongzhou for seven or eight days straight, going out wandering every day.

Before, Min Zhanlian had held perhaps one part hope; now, after hearing this, he felt two or three parts certainty. This man's lingering in Tongzhou was obviously to monitor travelers entering and leaving the capital. The timing matched when Manager Leng was kidnapped. Once Leng Ningyun was abducted, Lingao would certainly send people to the capital as soon as possible to take charge. Those people could only come through the Tianjin-Tongzhou-Capital corridor.

He didn't know how much money Liu Sha had spent on the "dragon head masters" at the various wharves along the route, but the effect was obvious. The moment they arrived at Zhangjiawan, Cao Sheng had come specially to feel them out.

However, Cao Sheng's probing showed that their disguise had been quite successful; otherwise, Cao Sheng wouldn't have specifically advised them not to enter the capital. No matter how shrewd Liu Sha might be, he couldn't easily question the judgment of an old *Jianghu* hand like Cao Sheng.

"Little Five, assign one of your people to watch Liu Sha constantly. Don't alert him."

After Little Five departed, Little Qian, returning from the outer city, also brought important news.

On his second trip to find Third Master Qin, Little Qian arrived at the teahouse but didn't see him. Asking the waiter, he learned that Third Master Qin's brother-in-law, Liu Xiaobian, had died, and they were holding the funeral.

"...When I heard, I went to his house, kowtowed, and contributed two taels of silver as condolence money. He appreciated the gesture and asked what I was planning to do in the capital, whether I needed his help."

Little Qian had a ready excuse. He said he'd come to the capital to pull a "big job" in the South City and planned to flee through that area—so he wanted Third Master Qin's assistance when the time came. Third Master Qin readily agreed. During their conversation, they spoke of Liu Xiaobian's death.

Third Master Qin had nothing to hide. He told the whole story of how Liu Xiaobian had inexplicably gone to Haidian and been murdered by the roadside.

"He really died there?!" Hearing this, Min Zhanlian's pupils shrank. "You're certain?"

"Exactly!"

"What date was the body discovered?"

"The twenty-third of the twelfth month."

"Excellent!" At this exclamation, everyone present showed joy. This was vital information: the intelligence from Heliansheng had clearly stated that Lady Sanniang's silver cart convoy was attacked the day before.

Without a doubt, Liu Xiaobian had been one of the bandits.

According to Little Qian's inquiries, Liu Xiaobian was a loafer and a ruffian. Such men lacked both the courage and the arm strength to be highway robbers—especially against a convoy protected by escort masters. He could only have been involved for one reason: he was acting on someone's behalf.

Since Manager Leng's kidnapping, this was the first lead directly connected to the kidnappers.

"So Liu Xiaobian's backer must be the mastermind behind the kidnapping..." Zhou Ruolan said thoughtfully. "A pity he's dead!"

"No rush," Min Zhanlian replied. "He's dead, but the people around him are all still alive. We'll question them one by one. Worst case, we kidnap Third Master Qin and interrogate him—he certainly knows how many friends his brother-in-law had and what their backgrounds are."

The tense atmosphere in the room lightened somewhat. Little Qian said, "Speaking of people around him, I also learned another piece of news related to the case."

"What?"

"Liu Xiaobian had been working in Nanyuan these past few months..."

Liu Xiaobian was normally idle, spending his days gambling and whoring. His home was bare. So Third Master Qin's wife had pressured her husband to find her brother a job. Though Third Master Qin was the dragon head master of the outer city—a man whose stomp made the ground shake in the South City—finding a cushy, well-paying position was still somewhat difficult. In the end, he had to use several intermediaries and grease the palms of palace eunuchs to secure a position in Nanyuan, managing the castrated men who had come to the capital seeking palace service but hadn't yet been formally admitted.

"Managing" actually meant doing roll call and distributing money and rice. Not only was the job idle, there was also room for embezzlement. The eunuchs who went out begging and extorting also had to give these "managers" a cut. This money was supposed to be tributed to the eunuchs overseeing the gardens, but just skimming from the money and rice was already a tidy sum.

"So Liu Xiaobian and those two eunuchs were in cahoots!" Zhou Ruolan said. "A pity those two eunuchs were killed!"

"The eunuchs only knew Liu Xiaobian. Didn't you see the confession clearly stated: the person who brought them was also dead."

"But I don't understand—why send two eunuchs to join Martial Yama's gang? Eunuchs are too distinctive..."

"Not necessarily. Unless you pull down the pants of every corpse and every captive to check..."

This drew laughter from everyone. Min Zhanlian smiled as well. "Let's not overthink it. The enemy might not have thought that far. Besides, who would have expected Old Feng from Heliansheng to pull that trick?"

"That's true," Zhou Ruolan conceded. "According to Heliansheng's intelligence, those two eunuchs were also capable fighters, holding their own against the escort masters."

"The eunuchs of the Imperial Stables are skilled fighters and can even command troops," Min Zhanlian observed. "Setting other matters aside, Nanyuan obviously has something worth investigating. Tomorrow we'll set out for the capital."

With a lead in hand, everyone felt reassured. They were about to return to their rooms to prepare when Min Zhanlian called Little Qian and Little Five back.

"Tomorrow, you'll split off from us halfway and enter the outer city on your own."

"Understood!"

"Once in the South City, focus your efforts on Third Master Qin and the people around him. Find out all of Liu Xiaobian's connections—especially who he was close to in Nanyuan and who he associated with frequently."

"Got it."

"Little Five, you go to Tongzhou. Keep eyes on Liu Sha. Dig into his background. Find out which deity he really is."
