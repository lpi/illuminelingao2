# Chapter 2783: The Capital (Part 139)

"If you ask me, you were reckless." Zhou Lezhi heard Xu Yong's words and sighed.

"Mr. Le..."

"I know your meaning. You Rong is Mr. Zhou's concubine, allowing no mishap. You feel you have this responsibility towards Mr. Zhou and Master Wang..." Speaking of this, he couldn't help sighing again.

"Mr. Le, is there anything improper?"

"Improper?" Zhou Lezhi smiled bitterly, "Once the bow is drawn, there is no turning back arrow. You continue to handle this matter. Just don't come to my place anymore. Contact directly by letter. If there is an urgent matter, find Master Wang directly. The Kun thieves have many eyes and ears outside; you yourself must be careful."

"This is the Capital. Sir has Master Wang's protection, why fear a few Kun thieves?"

Zhou Lezhi smiled without answering. After instructing him with a few more sentences, he sent Xu Yong away.

As soon as Xu Yong left, Zhou Lezhi immediately summoned Wang Zhi: "Pack up simply, we leave."

Wang Zhi was startled: "Leave? Go where?"

Their footholds in the Capital were not many, and some places couldn't be visited either.

"No matter where, just leave here first." Zhou Lezhi said, "Find an inn to stay first."

Wang Zhi advised: "In broad daylight, what is Master afraid of? The Kun thieves wouldn't dare to seize the door and enter in broad daylight..."

"They dare, and they will definitely do so."

Although Wang Zhi was not his house servant, he had acted according to his instructions in recent years, so he didn't argue much and immediately went to pack luggage. Zhou Lezhi packed up critical items slightly and waited for Wang Zhi to call a sedan chair over.

In just the time of two quarters (30 minutes), Wang Zhi came to report: things were packed, and the called sedan chair was waiting at the door.

"Which family's?"

"Called from the sedan chair stand at the east end of the street." Wang Zhi knew Mr. Le's rule: when calling a sedan chair, no roving sedan chair; must call from the sedan chair stand—the sedan bearers there were fixed, strangers couldn't wait for business there.

"Go." Zhou Lezhi got up and said.

The two changed their attire and came to the residence gate. Indeed, a two-person small sedan chair stopped outside. Wang Zhi scrutinized briefly and nodded slightly, indicating the bearers were still the original people and there were no suspicious people outside. Zhou Lezhi then walked out of the residence gate and got into the sedan chair.

The bearer asked in a low voice: "Please give instructions, Second Master, go where?"

Zhou Lezhi had selected an inn in the north of the city just now, but following his instructions, Wang Zhi only said: "Go to Haiyuan Temple!"

The sedan chair lifted and left, fast and steady. When Zhou Lezhi got into the sedan chair just now, he had looked at the street face; it was desolate with no one, and there was no suspicious phenomenon. Now that the sedan chair started moving, his heart settled down by more than half. He thought secretly that hiding like this wouldn't work. Being forced to the doorstep by Kun thieves caused much inconvenience. Must find a way to counterattack. It was just that at the foot of the Emperor, there were many scruples in acting. If not for the current "Kun Affairs" strategy, he really wanted to go to Zhejiang earlier. At least there he could do something with peace of mind...

Unconsciously, Zhou Lezhi fell asleep. He slept very heavily, so heavily that he didn't even have a dream. At the moment of waking up, he didn't even know who he was or where he was.

Waking up with a sudden start, how did he fall asleep?! Looking again, he was not in the sedan chair, but lying on a bed. His limbs were firmly bound, his whole body stark naked, even his hair bun was taken apart.

Fell into a trap! In an instant, a cold current like ice water in the peak of winter poured straight down from the top of his skull, expanding rapidly along the spinal cord to limbs and bones, cold to the heart and marrow.

Amidst the shivering, he heard the room door open. There were footsteps of several people, then approaching the bed curtain. The curtain was lifted slightly at a corner.

"Is it him?" Someone asked.

"It is him." The voice was quite familiar, exactly the "Cold God of Wealth" (Leng Ningyun) he had invited.

"Done."

The footsteps faded away, and the room door was closed again.

Capturing Zhou Lezhi was a huge combat achievement for Xu Ke. After confirming no error, he sent a telegram to Lingao immediately.

That night, a return telegram came from Lingao: "Escort him back to the Farm safely immediately." Then another sentence was added: "All personnel in the Zhou residence also arrest and send."

"Also arrest the people in the Zhou residence?" Min Zhanlian was startled, "Inside are all women and children..."

"Who told them to be that Mr. Zhou's people?" Xu Ke said faintly, "For this matter, the Senate won't stop until they investigate it bottom up. Next, I'm afraid it will involve even more people."

"Then Minister of War Master Wang..."

"Temporarily we can't move him yet," Xu Ke said, "Otherwise, he can't run away either. But this time we can be considered to have unloaded his left arm and right arm. Next, if he wants to stir up trouble, it won't be that easy." He looked at Min Zhanlian and suddenly laughed, "Aren't you a person of the *Jianghu*? Why also become wishy-washy?"

"Subordinate understands! This is an imperial criminal of the Senate."

"Correct." Xu Ke nodded, "You just care about arresting and killing people. Know nothing about superfluous things."

"Yes!" A slight sweat appeared on Min Zhanlian's forehead. He knew Senator Xu was always straightforward and not a person who liked to pretend to be profound. These words he said were absolutely not alarmist talk.

"Your movement must be fast. Once this Mr. Le disappears, Master Wang will probably realize something is wrong. The Zhou residence might be strictly protected. If you go late, the commotion might be huge..."

After Min Zhanlian left, Xu Ke circled in the room, unable to suppress his excitement. This mysterious Mr. Le finally fell into their hands now! It seemed he was fully mentally prepared for arrest, carrying multiple unknown drugs on his body, among which there might be poison.

A person prepared to commit suicide at any time must have massive secrets.

How to make him open his mouth and speak these secrets was not Xu Ke's business. That was a problem for the Political Security Bureau or even higher levels to consider. The only thing he knew was that there would probably be many people in the Senate celebrating by dusting off their caps (congratulating each other). Of course, more would be like him, full of curiosity about the Shi Weng group and Mr. Le.

If he was also a transmigrator, how would the Senate treat him? Xu Ke felt it very interesting. Although a consensus had been reached on the overall program that any transmigrator who had hostile behavior with the Senate belonged to "enemies" and the principle was to eliminate them.

But principle was principle; specific disposal naturally depended on the public opinion of the Senate. After all, any single person was precious wealth.

Whether "eliminate" or "atone for crimes by meritorious service," Xu Ke was indifferent. He had no special emotion towards this mysterious figure.

Whether he was a transmigrator or not, right now it was equivalent to destroying more than half of the Shi Weng group's strength. The Shi Weng group's influence on the future could be said to be minimal. He came to the Capital initially just to rescue Leng Ningyun; unexpected to harvest such a big result. His own status and reputation on the intelligence front would inevitably increase day by day. Substantiating the empty shell of the Military Intelligence Bureau would be just around the corner.

The more he thought, the more excited he became, having a strong impulse to drink heavily. At this time, someone came to report: Liao Sanliang (Third Sister) and Li Rufeng came.

"Invite them in."

Originally he didn't need to see them, but after the kidnapping incident happened, the adjustment of intelligence work originally started accelerated suddenly. The organizational structure of the Capital in the future would have drastic adjustments. As an important force of the Senate in the Capital, He Lian Sheng naturally had to be re-arranged.

Although the two had been trained in Lingao, working outside for many years, old habits were not changed, still the man bowing with hands clasped and the woman bowing with hands on the side. Xu Ke didn't mind either, laughing: "Rare to see you, sit, sit."

"Senior present, dare not sit." Li Rufeng said respectfully.

"Fart! What kind of senior am I," Xu Ke laughed, "No need to be polite, sit down to chat business!"

Only then did the two sit down. As soon as they sat down, Liao Sanliang reported in detail about her sending people to intercept Pan Cheng'an.

"...This matter was more or less my own decision. Asking my heart, actually there was also private intent of not bearing to see a sister fall into the sea of bitterness."

Xu Ke nodded. This matter was actually not hidden from him, and he also acquiesced. If Liao Sanliang wanted to defend her motive, there were plenty of suitable reasons. That she could speak truthfully showed her magnanimous mind.

"...This is not a big matter, nor does it concern the special case we are handling right now." Xu Ke said, "Has the person been found?"

"Yesterday Zhao Liangjian already sent news. They stared at Pan Cheng'an in Tongzhou and also found out You Rong's whereabouts. In these few days, people will be brought back. Originally I wanted to ask for the Chief's instructions, how to handle these two people?"

"You Rong is a person on the special case list. Send her here immediately after finding her. As for Pan Cheng'an or any other people involved, dispose of them as you see fit—dispose cleanly."

How to be considered clean, both knew clearly in their hearts.

"In Leng Senator's rescue this time, He Lian Sheng exerted great effort and established great merit." Xu Ke praised, "I have already telegraphed Guangzhou to request merit for you..." Saying so, he waved his hand to stop the two who wanted to speak, "It's all deserved, no need to be polite. What I'm going to say next is the important matter—concerning He Lian Sheng."

The expressions of Liao and Li immediately became serious. The life of bodyguard agencies in recent years was very difficult. The bodyguard routes from the Capital to other places were mostly in a precarious state. Among traditional bodyguard routes, the western route could only reach Shanxi; further west there was completely no certainty. Instead, the route going north to border towns could still be maintained because of the numerous garrison troops along the road plus the "Old Xi'er" (Shanxi merchants)'s Mongolian business being booming.

As for the southbound route, only the "River Bodyguard" along the Grand Canal could linger on with one's last breath.

So the business of various bodyguard agencies plummeted, and those closing down were not few. Strictly speaking, He Lian Sheng didn't have much business to do either, but after all, they had the Senate's secret support. Out of the sentiment of the same trade, they also absorbed and placed quite a few personnel from other bodyguard agencies.

"He Lian Sheng's scale should be appropriately reduced." Xu Ke stated the conclusion as soon as he started, "Especially this time, He Lian Sheng exerted the greatest effort but also exposed itself somewhat. In the future, I'm afraid it will become an object of attention for all parties. you should shrink the target as much as possible."
