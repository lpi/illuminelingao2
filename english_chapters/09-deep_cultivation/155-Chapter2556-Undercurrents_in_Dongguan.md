# Chapter 2556: Undercurrents in Dongguan

Late at night, at the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital located in the Great World. The diligent doctors and nurses were still busy at work. This sole "Australian-style" hospital on the mainland had extremely rare electric lighting in Guangzhou, with lights staying on throughout the night.

With the continuous success of modern drug replication, this hospital's reputation had also grown louder and louder. Countless people came for consultation every day. Not only did patients with various complicated diseases from the Pearl River Delta region flock here, but even patients from as far as Guangxi came seeking its fame. There were even wealthy magnates who came from Jiangnan and the capital for treatment.

Thus, the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital inevitably followed the old path of mega triple-A hospitals from the old timeline, occupying more and more space, setting up more and more beds. And to fill the hospital with medical staff, the affiliated Health School was also constantly devouring the Great World's space.

Although the Great World's space wasn't at a tense stage yet, the Great World was after all a commercial complex. Having a hospital here was somewhat incongruous. Moreover, the crowds queuing to register somewhat affected the overall commercial street atmosphere. Therefore, Deng Bojun had specially come to Guangzhou for research not long ago, preparing to relocate the General Hospital to a more suitable place, and by the way, expand the affiliated Health School's scale by two or three times.

Lin Motian, who had been spinning like a top all day, finally returned to his desk—he was off work, but there were still some documents requiring the Dean's personal decision that needed approval. Fortunately, the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital had a quite capable General Affairs Director Li Mo, who rescued Lin Motian from heavy administrative work, allowing him to focus on medical affairs. Otherwise, just the administrative work of this mega hospital would be enough to crush him.

Looking at the stack of notes pressed under a paperweight on the desk, he felt somewhat helpless. "More requests for favors again, sigh, but can't not help..."

Picking up the first one, it was indeed a request note.

Guangzhou had just been pacified; a hundred things waited to be done. The various institutions under the Municipal Government had rules but also no rules; had no rules but also not completely no rules—much better than when they first entered the city. This was a request from a certain Naturalized Citizen cadre who came to Lin Motian with a note written by a certain Chief. The extremely busy Lin Motian had great difficulty finding time to give instructions.

Lin Motian rotated his neck, picked up pen and paper and began writing rapidly. Just at this moment, a little girl's head poked in at the door, saying to Lin Motian: "Chief, Section Chief Huang from the Health Bureau is looking for you, says there's urgent business."

Lin Motian, whose butt hadn't even warmed the seat yet, stood up again, still holding the instruction note he had just written a few characters on, and followed the little girl out.

The next day, Section Chief Huang who returned to the Health Bureau flipped through the documents brought back from Lin Motian's place. A slip of paper fluttered down. Section Chief Huang bent to pick it up. Looking at the handwriting, it was Senator Lin Motian's. Only saw written on it: "Your department's cadre is diligent and assiduous, quite effective, at present."

"What's this?" Section Chief Huang looked at this half-sentence instruction, completely baffled like a monk of two zhang [very confused], but couldn't go ask about it. Thus, a certain cadre's instruction slip disappeared without a trace.

Dongguan Chashan, deep in a courtyard, a middle-aged man appearing about thirty years old stared at those leaves withering in the cold wave in the courtyard, spacing out for about an hour. The household servants dared not disturb him. After quite a while, he finally moved his lips, murmuring: "First, Master Xuandu [Deng Yunxiao] passed away in indignation. Unexpectedly after traveling for several years, Quanren [Chen Xuequan] actually died young; he was only three years older than me. When the Bald Bandits invaded the city, Qisi [Dongguan County Magistrate Wang Yunguang] also committed suicide to repay the nation..."

The one expressing lamentation was none other than Zhang Mu. Zhang Mu, courtesy name Er'qi, art name Muzhi, descendant of Tang Dynasty Prime Minister Zhang Jiuling. His father Zhang Shiyu, *juren* of the thirteenth year of Wanli, served up to Magistrate of Bobai County, Guangxi. When Zhang Mu was born, his father was already over sixty. Having a son in old age, naturally doted on him greatly. Due to the family's wealth, by twelve Zhang Mu admired Lord Xinling, by thirteen studied from Baopuzi, by fifteen mastered mounted archery with ambitions for the frontier deserts. Coming of age, he embraced lofty eccentricities, carefree and not fond of Confucianism. Though not a thousand-gold heir, treasured horses were always on the road; the humble gate had many miscellaneous guests, all sentiments were real men. In his youth, he studied with friends at Mount Luofu, drinking from stone springs, sleeping in spring mist—"Drunk, dreaming of plum blossom moon; weary from wandering, returning on lotus leaf boats. Night reflecting cinnabar glow steaming colorless, cloud-jade pearl trees hidden in three heavens"—how carefree those times were.

In the sixth year of Chongzhen (1633), he resolutely crossed the ridges northward, thinking to achieve merit at the frontier. There were teachers and friends wanting to recommend him to Yang Sichang, Commander-in-Chief at Shanhaiguan, but it fell through for some reason. Thus, he traveled through Jingchu [Hubei/Hunan], Xianggan [Hunan/Jiangxi], Suhang [Suzhou/Hangzhou]; for several years he took in the beautiful scenery of mountains and rivers, and also grew accustomed to seeing flames of war everywhere and people unable to make a living. Unexpectedly, when returning home, he heard that the Bald Bandits had suddenly launched their attack and already occupied Liangguang. After lingering around Jiangxi for several months, he had no choice but to return to Suhang. After many twists and turns, he only recently returned to Dongguan by sea. Who would have thought that after several years of separation, so many old friends had died—grief couldn't help but arise from within.

Returning to the study, Zhang Mu raised his head and saw a calligraphy painting on the wall. It was "Gift to Zhang Muzhi" sent to him by Kuang Lu, written in running-cursive script. The characters danced like dragons and phoenixes, the brush strokes vigorous and powerful—truly an excellent work. The poem read: "Western wind and setting sun hang high banners, Young Master Zhang's poetry draft named Sword Flower. Divine objects from ancient times aren't easily obtained, making me sigh repeatedly over and over. Sighing your talented hand is still deep and sincere, literary heart's embellishment all in play. In days past, Rangju harbored leopard strategies, nothing more than Sun Yang portraying dragon steeds. Sir, don't you see Han Xin begged for food and relied on the washerwoman, Wu Yun played flute towards the Wu market. Ancient heroes losing their way are often thus, so Rengong ceased fishing and returned to Cangzhou, spiritual medicine I will follow and never die."

*Wonder how that old rascal Zhanruo [Kuang Lu] is doing,* Zhang Mu thought. He heard that after he went north, Kuang Lu offended Huang Xiyin, the Magistrate of Nanhai County, and fled to Guangxi. Unfortunately, letters were inconvenient when abroad, so he didn't know where Kuang Lu was. Otherwise, traveling the mountains and rivers hand in hand with his close friend would surely be a delight.

Thinking of this, Zhang Mu felt some comfort in his heart. He immediately spread out rice paper on the desk, ordered a servant boy to grind ink, raised his brush and composed "Arriving Home, Many Old Friends Have Died, Composing a Poem to Encourage Myself." The poem read: "Born in Five Turbid World, wealth and honor don't last long. Troubles in poverty and lowliness, all kinds are bitter and busy. Poverty and lowliness, poverty easily returns; wealth and honor, indulging how could have leisure? Looking back, body gradually lightens, all is like chaff. Those I admire and emulate, drawing beside sages. In the West there is ancient Buddha, vow power pervading ten directions. Buddhist teachings are my teacher, preaching already detailed. Sincere faith unbroken, body emerges from lotus chamber. Five colors like carriage canopy, bathed following fragrant light. Dust sand views pearls and jade, ground covered in seven treasures. Heaven-net brilliant walking trees, wind music containing reed pipe. Phoenix and crane meeting hundred sounds, chanting harmoniously and lightly rising. Time without cold or heat pressing, heartland all cooling. Material feelings far from good karma, lustful killing competes in self-harm. Aged and forgetting return date, willing to negotiate with gratitude and resentment."

Having finished writing, suddenly a servant boy reported from outside: "Master, Master Su Yulin is inviting you."

"Su Guansheng? Usually not much contact. What does he want with me? Where is the invitation to?" Zhang Mu was somewhat puzzled.

The servant boy said: "He didn't say what matter, only said at Yan'an Hermitage in Huangcun."

Huangcun in Dongguan originally had no temple. Historically there was a famous Jie'an Hermitage, the dharma practice site of Monk Daodu. Monk Daodu, art name Kongyin, was a native of Nanhai, Guangdong, and the thirty-third generation successor of the Caodong school. He successively held dharma seats at Huangyan Temple on Mount Lu, Jie'an Hermitage in Dongguan, Huashou Terrace on Mount Luofu, and Haichuang Temple in Guangzhou, before passing away at Jie'an Hermitage in Dongguan. Jie'an Hermitage was built by Monk Daodu and Monk Tianran [Zeng Qishen] after returning to Guangdong. However, at this time, Monk Daodu was still at Jinlun Peak on Mount Lu. Originally, he should have been invited back to Guangzhou by Chen Zizhuang, Li Suiqiu, and others in 1640. Due to the Senate's arrival, whether Monk Daodu would come back was a big question mark.

As for the so-called Yan'an Hermitage, it was the cultivation site built by Li Yunlong, Yuan Chonghuan's advisor in this timeline, after he became a monk and wandered to Dongguan.

More than ten kilometers away at Wanjia Zu [today's Wanjiang Village Tou Fang], an ordinary household; the atmosphere was somewhat heavy.

The mother of the household lay ill in bed. The son was holding a bowl of clear water to give his mother some white tablet medication to take. This was sulfa he obtained from the newly opened Runshitang in the city. Previously, the family had already invited the best old Chinese medicine doctor in the county to see the illness; the prescription insisted on using paired crickets as medicine primer. Who could get that? Could only randomly catch a pair of crickets. Obviously, the black medicinal liquid boiled and drunk had no effect. So he could only place hope in the Australians' Runshitang. Everyone said this sulfa was the Australians' miraculous medicine—though it couldn't bring the dead back to life, it was said most illnesses would improve after taking it.

But the current situation was somewhat wrong. Sulfa had been used several times, yet mother's condition still showed no improvement. The whole family was anxious and spinning in circles. The son had no choice but to spend a large sum to invite a Fake-Hair doctor to come for a home visit. The doctor, holding a new-style stethoscope, listened here and there, and after asking about the medical history, sighed and shook his head.

The filially pious son knelt down and begged: "Doctor, I know Great Song medical arts are marvelous beyond marvelous; there must still be salvation, right?"

The doctor took out a prescription slip, scribbled a prescription in messy handwriting, and handed it to him. Mysteriously, he said: "The sulfa I can prescribe is Aminobenzenesulfonamide, the earliest variety from Lingao Pharmaceutical Factory; its efficacy isn't very reliable. If you have a way to obtain this medicine from the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, perhaps there's still hope."

The son took the prescription slip. Only saw written on it: "Penicillin, one vial (10,000 units)."

After sending off the doctor with a thousand thanks, the son couldn't help but have thoughts. Perhaps only Chief Du could help.

"Jiayu, Jiayu..." Suddenly shouting came from outside the door, accompanied by knocking sounds.

"Shibao, take care of Mother. I'll go open the door." Zhang Jiayu said to his young sister.

"Teacher!" The gate opened with a "creak," and Zhang Jiayu called out in surprise to the visitor. The visitor appeared about forty years old and was none other than Zhang Jiayu's former teacher, Lin Jian. Under Lin Jian, Zhang Jiayu mainly studied the *Classic of Changes* for the imperial examinations, and also learned military texts like *The Three Strategies of Huangshi Gong*, *New Book on Military Efficiency*, *Military Defense Record*, *Essentials of Military Tactics*, and *Divine Weapon Manual*.

Lin Jian carefully looked around, entered the house and closed the door, then said to Zhang Jiayu: "Jiayu, I heard you came back from Guangzhou. Did the Bald... Australians give you trouble?"

Zhang Jiayu was somewhat distracted and replied: "The Australians are busy with government affairs; they won't trouble a nobody like me. Originally I wanted to go to Guangzhou to broaden my horizons and join the scholars' societies in the city. Didn't expect the Australians to attack."
