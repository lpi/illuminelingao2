# Chapter 2407: Fenshenghe Silk Factory

Imitating a master's manner, Chen Xuan gave a slight hum and lifted the lidded tea bowl, gently brushing aside the floating leaves. He regarded with some satisfaction his nephew standing there—uncertain and somewhat fearful.

A long moment passed before he coughed and said, "Well, sit down."

"Yes, yes."

"It's not that I mean to boast, but the reason the Nansha Chen Clan has found peace this time is entirely due to my negotiations with the Australians to protect this area!" Pride crept into his voice. "If nothing else—without me, would the Australians have come to Nansha Village to establish a sericulture pilot project? Would they have sent troops specifically to patrol here? Would they have organized and drilled Village Braves for our village?"

Chen Lin didn't know how to respond, so he simply echoed with a few murmurs of agreement.

"Nephew, presumably you've heard I've taken over the weaving workshop, and you must harbor some resentment in your heart..."

Chen Lin quickly rose. "I wouldn't dare. This weaving workshop was always property of the Upper Three Branches—broadly speaking, it belongs to the entire clan. Since my father is gone, it's only right and proper for Second Uncle to take charge. How could I possibly resent it? Besides, the current situation is chaotic and confusing. I'm young and couldn't cope with it! Even if Second Uncle handed it over, I lack the ability."

Chen Xuan studied him with some surprise and said leisurely, "Nephew, you didn't spend your time in Guangzhou for nothing—you've grown considerably!"

Chen Lin flushed to his ears, wishing he could disappear into the floor from embarrassment. But this was no time for pride, so he said immediately: "In the past, I was young and ignorant. Second Uncle, with your great heart, please don't hold it against me."

"We're close family—bones broken but tendons still connected. I'm your elder. How could I hold anything against you?" Chen Xuan was thoroughly satisfied. "What are your plans now that you've returned?"

Chen Lin didn't dare mention anything about "reorganizing the family business" or "opening a cotton spinning factory." He could only deflect: "Now I'm a man who has lost his father. Though Guangzhou is pleasant, it's not home. I've returned hoping to find a place to settle near the Ancestral Hall."

"Well said." Chen Xuan nodded. "After such catastrophe, there's much to be rebuilt. We need people. You were familiar with the weaving workshop and spent considerable time in Guangzhou—presumably you've encountered Australians..."

"I haven't met any Real Australian Senators, but I've dealt with some naturalized citizens under their command."

"Good enough." Chen Xuan said, "There's a suitable position available."

Only then did Chen Lin learn that his family's weaving workshop had indeed caught the Australians' attention. They had specifically sent people to operate it jointly with the Chen family workshop, undertaking some "Rural Sericulture Improvement."

"...You've stayed in Guangzhou and dealt with Australians. The job of receiving and liaising with them is yours."

Chen Lin was greatly surprised. Truthfully, he hadn't expected Second Uncle would actually "put him to use." His instinct made him probe: "Is that... appropriate?"

"What's inappropriate?" Chen Xuan assumed an air of magnanimity. "We're close family. I have no son—won't all the family property eventually belong to you younger folk? Help me run the weaving workshop well, and there'll be no shortage of benefits for you!"

"Yes, yes—thank you, Second Uncle, for your trust!" Chen Lin stood, his face a picture of "tearful gratitude," and immediately bowed deeply.

Chen Xuan's gesture wasn't pure pretense. Years ago, relying on his elder brother's position, he had served as a manager in the weaving workshop. But he indulged in pleasure and neglected workshop affairs, fishing for three days and drying nets for two. Regarding sericulture and weaving, he could only be considered slightly better than a complete layman. He could talk a good game, but the moment actual operations began, his true limitations were exposed.

Since starting "cooperation" with the Australians, Chen Xuan had gradually felt his abilities falling short. Moreover, as his dealings with the Australians increased, he discovered their "ambitions were vast," and his own capabilities couldn't keep pace.

Though the original workshop craftsmen had mostly returned to work, after his falling out with Third Brother, Third Brother had departed for Sanliang taking several lower-level managers and key craftsmen. The workshop now barely functioned, but efficiency was far below previous levels. Since the Australians had begun the joint silk factory with him nearly half a year ago, production still hadn't gotten on track. The Australians were very dissatisfied.

Plenty of people under him could flatter, but none understood the weaving workshop. Now that Chen Lin had returned, he had no choice but to rely on him.

Chen Lin couldn't read Second Uncle's full hand at the moment, but since Second Uncle was willing to use him, he might as well go with the current and observe the workshop situation—and incidentally learn more about the incoming Australians' background.

Chen Xuan inquired about Chen Lin's lodging. Chen Lin had originally planned to stay in the Ancestral Hall, but seeing that Second Uncle treated the place as his stronghold, it seemed wiser to find somewhere else.

"My house is completely destroyed and there's nowhere suitable. I plan to stay with Fifth Brother Ji."

Fifth Brother Ji was Chen Qing's father, from a branch of the Lower Five Households. His family was very poor, but the man was honest and reliable.

"Ah Ji's place—his family is too poor. Though they have some empty rooms, I'm afraid you won't eat or sleep well there... Never mind, I'll have someone send some money and rice to him shortly."

Leaving the Ancestral Hall, Chen Lin's mind churned as he pondered his next moves. Truthfully, he couldn't quite figure out Second Uncle's real intentions. Their conversation had revealed probing and wariness throughout, yet his willingness to employ Chen Lin at the workshop seemed genuine. What was Second Uncle really after?

He followed Chen Qing to his home and told Fifth Brother Ji and his wife he would be staying for a while, giving them a few taels of silver for expenses. Fifth Brother Ji readily agreed. Before long, Chen Xuan also sent clan servants with two *dan* of white rice and several strings of cash, saying it was for Chen Lin's lodging costs. The servants instructed him to report to the weaving workshop tomorrow to liaise with the Australians. Fifth Brother Ji and his wife, having received both money and rice with their son safely returned, were overjoyed. That night they slaughtered a chicken and bought wine, preparing a fine meal for the uncle and nephew. Chen Lin also asked his sister Chen Yue to move there, so they could look after each other.

Early the next morning, he made his way to the weaving workshop.

The workshop stood by the river at Nansha Village's eastern edge. It had started as a silk hong established by Chen Lin's grandfather, named Fenshenghe, specializing in purchasing raw silk from silkworm farmers throughout the surrounding area and selling it to traveling merchants. Business had always been good, and various clan branches successively invested significant capital. Combined with Grandfather's diligent management, Fenshenghe gradually built a reputation. By Father's generation, they began distributing raw silk to households in the village and nearby for weaving, then purchased looms from Guangzhou and established their own workshop.

This weaving workshop had been renovated and expanded by his father ten years ago. The scale was now more than double what it had been in Grandfather's time. Standing before the gate, Chen Lin felt both sorrow and solace.

Sorrow that Father's life's work had fallen into outsiders' hands. Solace that the workshop had survived the war—though the walls bore traces of fire, overall preservation was good. Two long white wooden plaques with ink calligraphy hung on either side of the gate. This style was familiar to Chen Lin from his time in Guangzhou: the Australians did things this way.

The left read "Fenshenghe Silk Weaving Factory." The right read "Nansha Sericulture Improvement Institute."

*At least the shop name is kept,* Chen Lin thought.

But looking closely, many changes had been made inside the courtyard. First, the entrance steps had been converted to a ramp. The stone threshold was gone. Two Village Braves now stood guard at the gate.

In the past, local water bandits ran rampant. Because the workshop stored raw silk, fabrics, and silver, it was a prime target for thieves. The courtyard walls had therefore been built particularly high and thick. Now corner towers of bamboo and wood had been erected at the wall corners, hung with clappers and lanterns, with Village Braves standing sentry atop them. Though the gate stood wide open, two layers of chevaux-de-frise were visible inside.

Such tight security showed the Australians clearly valued this workshop. No wonder Second Uncle was willing to let him help—with his limited abilities, Second Uncle obviously couldn't cope alone.

A red brick chimney appeared to have been erected in the backyard, emitting black smoke. Chen Lin had seen such chimneys in Guangzhou—they were for "boilers," used to heat water. Silk reeling certainly required hot water, but was a special boiler really necessary?

Entering the front courtyard, the changes were even more dramatic. Not only had many things been added, but the layout itself was different. New buildings and sheds had been constructed, occupying more than half of what had been a very spacious courtyard. Goods were stacked everywhere.

*What are the Australians playing at? Making such a neat, tidy courtyard so cramped?* Chen Lin wondered.

Before he could look carefully, Chen Xuan led him to the inverted rooms on the north side of the first courtyard. This had originally been the workshop's accounting office—where Chen Lin's father had mostly worked and received traveling merchants. Now wooden signs hung before each room, and the original lattice windows had all been replaced with glass.

*Quite particular,* Chen Lin thought. Second Uncle took him to one of the rooms. Inside, several large Eight Immortals tables had been pushed together to form one long table, with benches placed haphazardly on either side. A black wooden board was propped against the wall, smeared with white lime residue.

*What kind of arrangement is this?* Though Chen Lin had seen many "Australian Scenes," this setup was entirely new to him.

Chen Xuan told him to wait a moment. Before long, approaching footsteps announced what sounded like several people. Chen Lin hurriedly straightened his clothes and cap, bowing slightly in readiness.

A group entered, led by a woman. Chen Lin was stunned.

She was about thirty years old, slender and somewhat frail in appearance, wearing a blue cloth jacket and skirt with her hair in double buns. At first glance, she looked no different from local women. But on closer inspection, her expression and bearing were distinctly different. Chen Lin had observed many "Real Short-hairs" from afar in Guangzhou and recognized immediately: this was a Real Australian!

Behind her followed a young girl of about eighteen or nineteen, with a similar expression and features. Chen Lin was greatly intrigued. *Two Australian women have come to my little Nansha Village at once!*
