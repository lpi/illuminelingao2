# Chapter 2759: The Capital (Part 111)

"Yang Tianliang has such great ability!" Xu Ke couldn't help but say.

He was so surprised because the Directorate of Imperial Horses (*Yumajian*) was the only institution in the Twenty-Four Yamen that could stand up to the Directorate of Ceremonial (*Silijian*) as an equal. If the Directorate of Ceremonial was like the "Grand Secretariat" (*Neige*) of the Inner Court, then the Directorate of Imperial Horses was the "Privy Council" (*Shufu*) of the Inner Court.

The Directorate of Imperial Horses did not just manage the mules and horses for palace service as its name suggested. Besides its initial duty of "managing imperial horses and various tributes, and collecting horses and mules for the herding office," it developed to command the Imperial Guards of the Four Guards Battalion and the Brave Guard Battalion; go out to garrison various borders and provinces, serve as army supervisors in wartime, etc.; and manage pastures, imperial estates, imperial shops... Even the Western Depot (*Xichang*), which "managed what the Eastern Depot couldn't manage," was headed by a eunuch from the Directorate of Imperial Horses.

Yang Tianliang, a eunuch of medium rank, being promoted to serve as a supervisor in the Directorate of Imperial Horses was equivalent to his eunuch "career" entering the fast lane, with immeasurable prospects. The Directorate of Imperial Horses had power and money, and serving as a Grand Defender Eunuch was an even fatter assignment. It was much better than hanging out with Eunuch Yang.

"Who doesn't love shining white silver." Liu Sha sneered, "For this sentence, he spent no less than twenty thousand silver before and after. By the time he waited for this sentence, the river was dry and the sea clean, and he had even incurred quite a bit of debt outside."

Xu Ke thought: This Eunuch Wang is black-hearted enough! Squeezing Yang Tianliang dry, then quoting a big price. If he could scraped it together, he would sell for a good price; if he couldn't, then he deserved to have the money spent before go down the drain!

Twenty thousand taels of silver was not a small amount in the 17th century. Seeing that his savings were spent, where could he get another twenty thousand taels of silver? So he set his mind on Cold Ningyun.

Naturally, Leng Ningyun could not lend him twenty thousand silver. So he used Eunuch Yang's banner again, asking Leng Ningyun to get a shipment of "Australian Rare Goods." Because the amount was huge, Leng Ningyun became suspicious and inquired privately, only to find out there was no such thing at all. Yang Tianliang's plan went bankrupt again.

"...Shopkeeper Leng has such big gall? To actually dare to ignore Little Eunuch Yang?" Xu Ke laughed.

"Shopkeeper Leng had long known about the discord between father and son." Liu Sha said, "About more than a year ago, Eunuch Yang informed Shopkeeper Leng that if Yang Tianliang did not hold a handwritten note with his signature, he would not be responsible for any monetary dealings. Otherwise, wouldn't Yang Tianliang just find his adoptive father? With Eunuch Yang's savings from years of accumulation, twenty thousand taels of silver would still be easy."

"Even if father and son are at odds, wouldn't it also be a beautiful thing for Eunuch Yang if Yang Tianliang could serve in the Directorate of Imperial Horses? It's better than muddling along listlessly like this."

Liu Sha stared into his eyes and laughed after a long while: "You old folks don't understand their minds! If it were a biological father and son, and the son could stand out, it wouldn't be a problem for the father to kowtow to an enemy; for people like them, Eunuch Yang cultivated this adopted son for old age support. There is no blood relationship between the two, nor any grace of upbringing. If this adopted son is too successful, wouldn't he, the Seal-holding Eunuch of the Bell and Drum Division, have to rely on the adopted son's breath?"

"I didn't expect the suspicion between father and son to reach this point!" Xu Ke said, "I thought Eunuch Yang valued this adopted son very much!"

"Value him he naturally does, but he is unwilling to let this adopted son be too successful. Only in this way can he firmly control him in his hands to look after him in old age and bury him."

"Was it for this twenty thousand silver that you colluded together?"

"Twenty thousand silver is just a start," Liu Sha said. "Arriving at the Directorate of Imperial Horses isn't everything going well either. There are three big officials above: the Seal-holding Eunuch, the Supervising Eunuch, and the Admiral Eunuch. If he wants to make a name for himself inside, he has to worship Buddha and burn incense again. Can the expenses inside be small?"

"So he was anxious to finish off Eunuch Yang, right? Even if he couldn't take a penny of the hundred thousand taels."

"He said he wouldn't take a penny; how could I do such a thing?" Liu Sha smiled. "Shorting the eunuch of money, isn't that seeking death! The silver for this errand in the Directorate of Imperial Horses naturally must be left for him. I inevitably have to add ten thousand taels of 'congratulatory money'."

"To finish off Eunuch Yang for seventy thousand taels, this risk is quite big."

Liu Sha let out a "chi" laugh, dismissive, and said: "Eunuch Yang is majestic on all sides; everyone coaxes him and sends him silver, but only because he is the Seal-holding Eunuch of the Bell and Drum Division. If not asking for something from him, they are afraid he will cause trouble for them. If he is caught by roving bandits, and any random bandit chops off his head with a raise of the hand and a fall of the knife, what risk is there?"

"Jump out of the Three Realms, not in the Five Elements. Naturally, one doesn't care."

"Exactly. To kill Eunuch Yang, there is not half a bit of risk." Liu Sha smiled, full of melancholy. "Moreover, there is silver to take."

Xu Ke suddenly became alert in his heart. He had chatted with Liu Sha for a long time and felt a sense of mutual understanding. At this moment, he suddenly realized that he, or the Senate, was precisely the one who shattered his beautiful dream. He must absolutely not have half a bit of pity or sympathy for him. Otherwise, he feared he would be bitten back.

"Eunuch Yang has a lot of silver?"

"He has been a eunuch all his life and was popular for a few years. In recent years, as a Seal-holding Eunuch, he has at least a hundred thousand silver in his hands. If Little Eunuch Yang gets rid of him, this silver will all be his. Besides, Yang Tianliang is not a young lad anymore. He still has to stand by the rules in the palace every day to serve this old man. Even getting a woman outside has to be sneaky. He has long had grievances."

"Getting a woman?! Isn't he a eunuch!"

Liu Sha looked at him with eyes for someone with little experience and said: "He is naturally a eunuch. But he also has women. There are also palace maids as 'paired eaters' (*duishi*) in the palace."

Xu Ke rarely delved into these things and immediately felt his worldview was greatly impacted. He suppressed his curiosity and asked:

"Do you know where his woman is?"

"Naturally, I know," Liu Sha laughed. "I was the one who handled this matter for him."

"Your friendship with this Yang Tianliang is not shallow."

Liu Sha spat: "Who has any friendship with him! This bunch of things without XX are the most insidious!"

It seemed that in his cooperation with this Little Eunuch Yang, he didn't suffer few losses either.

"Did you know that Yang Tianliang privately bought a preorder ticket for the Merchants' Bureau ship?"

Liu Sha was stunned: "There is such a thing?"

"Exactly. It seems he was not one hundred percent sure about his move this time either."

"Although unexpected, it counts as reasonable. He is such a person." Liu Sha sneered, "Secretive and not showing to others. Even if he knows the bridge is broken, he won't tell the people walking with him, only turn and run first."

"Discuss Eunuch Yang's matter later. Let's talk about the people around Stone Elder." Xu Ke said, "Back then during the Riot in Lingao, where did he befriend so many *jianghu* heroes? Could it also be Zhou Lezhi's credit?"

"That's not it," Liu Sha shook his head. "The idea of the Riot in Lingao came from Mr. Zhou. The original intention was to quietly capture a few Senators, take them out of Qiongzhou Prefecture, and bring them back for detailed torture. So initially, it wasn't on a large scale."

Later, the people sent were wiped out easily, which attracted the attention of the Stone Elder group. The mission objective also changed from "kidnapping Senators" to "kidnapping Senators, if failing then assassinating Senators."

As a result, the number of mobilized people increased significantly. Although Liu Sha had many *jianghu* connections, most were petty thieves. Relying on them for fighting and combat was unreliable.

"...That's why we thought of finding people from sects. The one responsible for contact was Daoist Gold Stone. He was originally a private assistant to Lord Wei. Lord Wei has a daughter named Wei Yi, who has been cultivating in the Hengshan Sect..."

At that moment, he told the past story of Wei Yi assassinating Zhou Lezhi in Yangzhou and being rescued by Wang Yehao.

"...I also heard people talk about this matter; I am not clear if it is so. However, the later Riot in Lingao was indeed contacted through the Hengshan disciples."

Good guy! Xu Ke thought this Wang Yehao was so calculating, laying out plans everywhere. Could it be he wants to rebel? Spending so much effort and bringing his own dry provisions to fight against the Senate, obviously, it was not simply for promotion and wealth.

Wang Yehao had already served in important positions like Governor-General years ago, and now held the title of Minister of War. He could be called an extremely high-ranking official. One step further, apart from entering the Grand Secretariat to become a Prime Minister, it would be being enfeoffed as a Marquis. Xu Ke thought, could it be he wants to be enfeoffed as a Marquis for the merit of suppressing the Kun?

However, in terms of the literati's knowledge of the Kun scoundrels, Wang Yehao was probably the number one person in the Great Ming. How could he have such unrealistic fantasies!

Moreover, the purpose of this recent kidnapping operation was "peace negotiation." This shows he clearly knows that the Imperial Court is completely helpless against the Senate.

From these aspects, he couldn't find a motive for him to be obsessed with "Anti-Kun."

He thought of the article "Research on Liang Cunhou's Ideological Change" distributed by the Political Security Bureau not long ago, which analyzed that the reason he gradually walked onto the "Anti-Kun" path was that the existence of the Senate seriously threatened the civilized order and ideological system of the Old World.

In other words, they might be able to tolerate a change of dynasty, but they could not tolerate "changing the Summer with Barbarian ways." Just like when the Manchus entered the pass, at first they swept through like splitting bamboo, but later when they came up with the "shaving hair and changing clothes" moth (bad idea), the flames of resistance immediately burned.

Compared to the "shaving hair and changing clothes" of the Manchus, the Senate's seemingly loose rule contained the ambition of "rebuilding culture" and introducing a new civilization system. This attempt had already been vaguely seen by the scholar-bureaucrats.

Compared to Liang Cunhou who relied entirely on his own observation and experience, Wang Yehao, who had a "suspected transmigrator" capable of "foreseeing the future" by his side, probably could appreciate this even more. This "Mr. Le" might have already told him the historical trend of the late Ming and early Qing.

"Saving the nation from extinction," to "resist barbarians," maintain the Huaxia orthodoxy, and also to maintain the interests of his own family under the Ming rule—only then does his strenuous anti-Kun stance make sense.

However, that he could also think of "peace negotiation" seems much wiser in insight and philosophy than Liang Cunhou. The latter was purely for "moral integrity," with a flavor of "doing it knowing it cannot be done." In terms of means and methods, he was far less "pragmatic" than the Stone Elder group.

The two talked for a long time. Seeing him look weary and seemingly tired, Xu Ke said: "You rest well and nurse your body. We will talk again tomorrow."
