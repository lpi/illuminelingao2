# Chapter 2777: The Capital (Part 133)

"Sir, after leaving the Zhou residence, should I drop by Master Wang's residence to report this matter?" Wang Zhi hesitated for a moment and asked, "This is a big matter within the family, we should let them know."

"What you said is correct, but you cannot go personally." Zhou Lezhi said, "Outside this Zhou residence, there might be eyes of the Kun thieves. You must be careful when you come back. Make sure not to have a tail."

"This lowly one understands."

He thought for a moment and added: "When you go, bring more shop assistants and coolies from the porter guild, carry some random things casually. Come out together when you leave."

"Someone is peeping at Mr. Zhou's residence?" Xu Ke heard the report from the messenger sent by Third Sister and asked with great interest.

"Yes!" The messenger reported the situation to Xu Ke in detail, "...Third Sister's intention is to intercept the person at Tongzhou after they succeed. This way, we won't alarm the Wang family and can also save the person."

Xu Ke smiled: "Third Sister is quite soft-hearted! Fine, I approve her plan. Go back and remind her that once this matter comes out, the Wang family people, and that Zhou Lezhi, will probably all pay attention to the residence at Wanggong Factory. There might likely be clues. Ask her to pay more attention."

After the messenger left, Xu Ke originally didn't take this news to heart. For his mission, this didn't count as a big matter. Besides, Wanggong Factory wasn't their surveillance priority originally. There were no important figures inside, and the surveillance records were really dull and uninteresting.

Thinking of this, he suddenly remembered something. He went back to the room and flipped out the surveillance records of the Zhou residence at Wanggong Factory from the past few days, flipping through them page by page.

Not flipping through a couple of pages, he discovered that a teenager had been hovering around the Zhou residence in the past two days. According to the records, since the surveillance of the Zhou residence started a month ago, this was already the third time this person had been seen used.

The surveillance post immediately sent out a two-person team to track him, but the teenager's movements were quite strange. Finally, at the temple fair of Yongguang Temple, due to the large crowd and complex terrain, they lost track of him.

Reviewing this record again now, Xu Ke suddenly felt that this teenager might be problematic.

Wanggong Factory was not a lively place. Less than ten years ago, it was blown into a pile of ruins, and it hasn't been completely cleaned up until now. There were very few residents, let alone any industry or commerce. What was the intention of a teenager wandering around here again and again?

Either he was a member of the abduction group, or he was Shi Weng (Stone Old Man)'s person, responsible for monitoring the movements outside the Zhou residence.

Xu Ke felt the latter possibility was not high. If Shi Weng wanted to watch over these women and children, he only needed to send people inside the residence. Why go to such trouble to deploy people outside for control? Judging from the surveillance report, besides the four women and children, there were two other families guarding the residence, with nearly ten male and female servants. It was enough for both serving and guarding.

Thinking of this, he decided not to spend more thought on this and continued to place the search focus on Wang Yehao, Jin Wenchi, Liu Zhao, and others.

In the process of monitoring Wang Yehao, Xu Ke discovered a very interesting thing: Wang Yehao was actively campaigning in private, seeking a transfer to the post of Governor of Shandong.

He had read Wang Yehao's short biography carefully. According to the normal historical process, Vice Minister Wang would be dismissed from office at the end of the year and disappear from the political stage of the late Ming dynasty from then on.

Now he was campaigning for a transfer so actively, could it be because he knew his "future"?

Starting from suspecting that "Mr. Zhou" was a transmigrator, Xu Ke knew that there must be "foreknowing the future" happening. Wang Yehao being so anxious and busy with the transfer was likely based on the "future." But then again, since Mr. Zhou "foreknew the future," he probably also said the fact that the Great Ming had less than ten years of life left. Why was Wang Yehao still struggling here to arrange various conspiracies? Even without them "Kun thieves," the roving bandits and the Manchus would take the Great Ming's life.

Could it be that Wang Yehao had the intention of imitating his ancestor? Speaking of which, it was not impossible. As for the specific situation, it would probably only be known when it was possible to talk to him face to face.

"This Wang Yehao is quite an interesting character!"

***

Third Sister obtained Xu Ke's approval and immediately started handling the matter. The bodyguard agency had many connections in the *Jianghu*, and they had deliberately made friends in recent years, so the news was quite well-informed. Soon they knew that the one acting as the go-between for Pan Cheng'an was not a family member in the Zhou residence, but a famous "Medicine Crone" in the Wanggong Factory area.

Medicine Crone was one of the so-called "Three Aunts and Six Grannies." In fact, this was not a formal profession. Practitioners were mostly middle-aged and elderly housewives, mostly glib-tongued, knowing a little "pharmacology," and having some unique secret recipes in hand.

The boudoir women of big hoseholds lived in the boudoir for a long time and could not go out easily. They lacked exercise and were mostly depressed, so their physical conditions were mostly poor. Unhealthy lifestyles and backward sanitary conditions often caused them to have various gynecological diseases, especially after giving birth to children.

Although there were doctors good at gynecology in medical clinics or traveling doctors, most big households were unwilling to invite doctors for consultation. Moreover, the prescriptions prescribed were mostly for conditioning, with long courses of treatment but mediocre efficacy.

Medicine Crones often had a few "ancestral secret recipes" of pills, which were often "effective instantly" for common gynecological diseases. They also had "secret medicines" like "seeking a son," "increasing affection," "contraception," "abortion"... which were inconvenient to talk about with others.

Although the Three Aunts and Six Grannies were despised by people at the time, and some families even denounced them as "disasters coming to the door" and strictly forbade them from entering, their existence catered to the various needs of women in the deep boudoir. Big households still inevitably had to deal with them.

"This crone is surnamed Shi. She is quite famous here. What she is best at is treating women's menstrual pain." Zhao Liangjian said, "A small pill, effective instantly after taking it. It's just ridiculously expensive. One hundred pills cost one tael of silver."

"Oh, this is her unique skill then." Third Sister was also a woman and knew the *Jianghu* methods of these women. "Three truths and seven fakes" were their usual routines. If it was all fake, this business couldn't go on.

This Granny Shi was a frequent visitor to the Zhou residence, going back and forth two or three times almost every month. Because she had "done business" for a long time and was good at flattering and coaxing people, her relationship with the family members in the residence was very good. Entering and leaving was very convenient.

The abduction routines of seducing women and running away with valuables mostly started with the Three Aunts and Six Grannies acting as illicit matchmakers. This matter in the Zhou residence did not give Third Sister much surprise.

"Let's not talk about these messy things." She instructed Zhao Liangjian, "But if this woman is taken out, you must keep an eye on her in time—as soon as she leaves the boundary of the Capital, intercept the person. I don't care what method you use."

"Any disposal after interception, please give instructions, Third Sister."

"Find a place to keep watch first." Actually, she herself didn't know how to dispose of her, so she had to take one step and look at the next.

Granny Shi was very proud today. Since she accepted Pan Cheng'an's two taels of silver to deliver news for him and secretly matchmake, it had been more than three months now. Two months ago, she actually got the thing done.

This Master Pan was very generous with his spending. After the meeting at Ganlu Nunnery, he actually gave another two taels of silver, asking her to continue communicating in between. Granny Shi was overjoyed, knowing this was a long-term business.

What Master Pan did, Granny Shi also had some experience in the *Jianghu*. Although Pan Cheng'an claimed to be a "Jiangnan Scholar," he had no Jiangnan accent at all. Such a graceful young man who had no roots locally but was "Pan, Donkey, Deng, Small, Idle" (handsome, well-endowed, rich, considerate, idle—attributes of a perfect lover), one could know with closed eyes that he was "abducting women."

Seeing through it but not saying it, and even more so not ruining other people's business, this was the rule of *Jianghu* people. Three Aunts and Six Grannies were also considered *Jianghu* ways, so Granny Shi pretended not to know. Firstly, Pan Cheng'an gave money readily; secondly, matters like concubines running away privately were common in big households. The parties involved mostly settled the matter peacefully and pretended it didn't happen to avoid affecting the family reputation.

But while she didn't ruin Pan You'an's (reference to a handsome lover character) business, she also had her own plans. After all, You Rong was her long-term customer. If she was really abducted, her business would naturally be greatly engaged (discounted). Maybe she would be forbidden from entering the door from then on, which was unknown. So this business couldn't let the one surnamed Pan do it too easily. She had to squeeze more profit out of it.

Although Granny Shi came and went frequently in the Zhou residence, a person of her status routinely did not go through the front door but entered and left through the back door.

Arriving at the back door, she knocked on the door knocker two or three times lightly, and the door opened. The one opening the door was Liu Qi'er (Liu the Seventh's Wife), a middle-aged woman who served here with her husband. Granny Shi knew the couple was quite capable and was in charge of the residence entrusted by the master, so she deliberately roped them in, occasionally using small favors to flatter them.

"Why so late today?" Liu Qi'er complained, "I came to the back to look several times, but didn't see you come!"

"It's been cold these few days, my old body aches all over, couldn't go out. Today the sun has warmed up a bit, had to wait until the sun was high up to go out and do some business..." Granny Shi chattered, talking about street trivia and family gossip while walking. This was an excellent pastime for women trapped inside the house for a long time.

Hearing her talk about the news outside, Liu Qi'er said with a smile: "You came just right! Miss You Rong has been talking about you these few days! Saying you never seem to come." After saying that, she lowered her voice, "The recipe for seeking a son I asked you for last time, do you have it?"

Liu Qi'er and her husband were nearly forty, and their knees were still empty (childless). For a slave family like theirs, serious medical treatment and medicine were not affordable (conditional); they could only seek help from such "folk prescriptions."

Naturally, Granny Shi wouldn't say "no." Hearing her request, she boasted that she knew eunuchs and could copy the imperial recipe for seeking a son from the Great Within (Imperial Palace).

She naturally knew a few eunuchs, but this imperial recipe for seeking a son was purely fictitious. It was just a method to raise her own value.

But she did have a few recipes for regulating menstruation and aiding pregnancy in hand, which also had some effects.

Immediately she pretended to be mysterious: "This matter took this old body great effort. It's just that the Eunuch doesn't know the compatibility of this recipe either; it was all brought by Imperial Physicians after mixing the medicine..."
