# Chapter 2646: The Capital (Part 2)

"Oh, is him." Emperor remembered. When memorial report of Zheng Zhilong's death sent to Imperial Desk, although he was somewhat shocked, but didn't heavy like receiving other bad news. After all this Zheng Zhilong was Sea Bandit origin. With Folangji people, Red Haired people, Japanese Pirates all had many unclear speaking not clear connections. Although accepted amnesty recruitment, yet not very loyal. Quite had meaning of Listening Transfer Not Listening Declaration (obeying military order but not court summons).

Zheng Zhilong died in battle. He although felt pity actually didn't have too much sadness. He long heard Jinyiwei's report. Saying Zheng Zhilong in Fujian, solemnly partitioned one side. Occupying Zhongzuo Suo acting blessing acting prestige. Zou Weilian towards him blindly practiced kindness. Towards Court no bit of awe heart. Court discussing transferring troops North up supporting Liao also pushing three blocking four. Not willing to exert strength...

Given time, also tail big not falling (too big to control). Emperor towards Martial Men Group rising these years extremely distrusted. Just National Matter daily difficult. Urgently needed Martial Generals selling life. He couldn't not add indulgence to them much.

"He actually still has a few portions of loyalty." Although feeling towards Martial Generals not good, but at this moment he suddenly realized, on Southeast Coast, only Zheng Family still possessed a powerful maritime force.

Although they defeated at hands of Kun Thieves. But also formed Blood Sea Deep Hatred with Zheng Family. He couldn't help thinking of Zou Weilian. Thinking he back then recruited pacified Zheng Zhilong, calmed Sea Bandit disaster on Fujian Ocean Face. Still was a Meritorious Subject. At least on coping Sea Bandits was fruitful effective.

This time he more or less somewhat regretted why listening to Court Discussion dismissing Zou Weilian back then. If not so, at least he now still bad a Governor High Official understanding Kun Thieves situation. Although this year re-conscripted him to be Vice Minister of War, yet not in time to assume office then died because of illness.

Thinking here, Emperor couldn't help becoming more annoyed. Towards Wen Tiren's antipathy also added a few portions.

"Imperial Master, is or not rising carriage..." Manager Eunuch seeing him somewhat stunned. Careful careful asked.

Chongzhen instead asked: "This Zheng Sen how old age?"

"Reply Imperial Master. Heard still in Charging Age (childhood). Still less than fifteen years old."

"Since so, presumably someone is assisting him *lo*."

"This..." Manager Eunuch low voice said, "Reply Imperial Master. Matters on local official field, slave doesn't know situation..."

Emperor sneered a sound: "This cup of tea you probably obtained not few benefits right."

Eunuch greatly turned pale from shock. Immediately kneeled down knocking head said: "Slave dare not..."

Emperor although didn't speak. Letting him bang bang knocking head below. Mood actually didn't become bad. This slave admittedly took silver. But, actually counted as giving him a reminder.

Zheng Family heard strength still remained. Still was a big force on Southeast Coast. Zheng Zhilong although died, actually might not be not a good thing. Now Zheng Family's House Head was a teenager. Naturally wouldn't like his father that wild un-tame. Inevitably want to rely on Court's grace.

"Get up." He lightly said a sentence. Directly ordered: "Rise Carriage!" Looking at Manager Eunuch's fear fear panic panic face. Towards own "Heaven Will Unfathomable" quite satisfied.

Chengqian Palace originally was place he often came. But these years National Matter daily difficult. He often wanted to handle political affairs to deep night. Even sleeping not very steady. More no mood to favor Concubines. Concubine Tian here he also came less.

After Gao Yingxiang captured sent to Capital executed. He only then more or less had some interest. Coming to Noble Consort Tian here to relax mood.

Compared to Empress Zhou and other Concubines, Noble Consort Tian on appearance not necessarily more outstanding. But she intelligent multi-talented. Also good at understanding people's will. Clothing enjoyment also many elegant novel. Coming to Chengqian Palace, could let his always tense exhausted mood have some relaxation.

Inside Chengqian Palace, already made preparation for Emperor's arrival properly. Originally dinner made several hours ago at this time already fully removed away. On table re-laid twelve dishes Refined Fruit Plates used to down wine. Because thinking dinner time passed already long. Emperor very possibly didn't pass meal. So specially prepared six dishes Jiangnan Dim Sum.

Because Concubine Tian born in Yangzhou. Her father Tian Hongyu also often sent people to Jiangnan to collect various fresh objects and novel style clothing materials jewelries sending into Palace. So inside Chengqian Palace whether Palace Hall decoration, clothing, diet... all were novel Jiangnan styles. In Back Palace quite famous. Emperor also liked very much.

These years, in Chengqian Palace again added not few Australian Goods. Chongzhen still not entered Palace Hall, then felt here light ray bright different from other places. Turned out from under corridor to inside hall, already lit eight "Australian Oil Lamps." Although Kun Thieves now fighting with Court. But didn't affect relevant enjoyment inside outside Court. Especially Australian Oil Lamp Australian Candle. Because light ray specially bright. So in High Officials Nobles, Gentry Big Households still using. Inside Palace also no exception.

Just because oil material price expensive. After Two Guangs war fire rose, not only price stood high, supply also time have time none. So even if inside Palace, Australian Oil Lamp mostly also only used when Master Position reading writing. Rarely just directly using to illuminate like this.

Emperor originally felt Beloved Concubine more or less somewhat extravagant. But in deep night walking along dim Imperial Road all the way. Front of eyes lamp fire bright Palace Hall gave him a kind of happy comfortable feeling. So didn't say much what.

Noble Consort Tian and Palace's Eunuchs Palace Maids welcomed him into hall. Here already re-arranged. Replaced a batch of display and furniture. Originally inside Concubine Tian's Palace bad many Australian utensils. Previous two years because Two Guangs war matter rose. Originally low eyebrow pleasing eye Australians unexpectedly transformed into fierce Kun Thieves. Took away Two Guangs. One leap becoming one of Giant Canals Court head aching. Eunuchs discussed, even East Barbarians letting Imperial Master head aching endlessly didn't take away Great Ming's province. Kun Thieves unexpectedly one act took away two in Thirteen Provinces! Also no wonder news came Imperial Master thunder wrath endlessly.

Because of this reason, not few "Australian Goods" in Palace all collected up. Avoiding Emperor "Touching Scenery Generating Emotion," triggering Thunder Wrath. Only "Practical Objects" like Australian Lamp and Australian Candle were kept down.

However these two years Court's bad heart things truly too many. Even if Kun Thieves already went on Qianqing Palace's screen. Its importance also couldn't compare to "Roving Bandits" harassing everywhere and "East Barbarians" just several hundred *li* outside Capital. Kun Thieves since taking down Two Guangs, then lowered flag silenced drum. Just stopped here. Consequently, these objects quietly one piece one piece re-appeared again—Comparing other playthings, Australian goods more had practicality. Especially Thermos Bottle, Oil Lamp, Australian Candle, Australian Fire (Matches) these. Once used on then very hard to release hand again. Just everyone still very careful. In front of Emperor absolutely didn't mention "Australia" two words. Only using "Nanyang" to replace.

Meals spread on table exquisite. But Emperor actually had no appetite. One comes he just now because missed dinner, already ate a few pieces Tiger Eye Nest Silk Candy (*Hu Yan Wo Si Tang*). Now not too hungry; Two comes situation of these days also made him no heart to taste delicious delicacies in front of eyes.

Noble Consort Tian eye seeing Chongzhen appetite not vibrating. Towards various meat fish in front of eyes completely no interest. Then hurriedly called people bring a bowl of Clear Soup. Advised Emperor enter a few mouthfuls soup water warm belly open stomach.

Chongzhen originally no appetite. But also couldn't bear brushing Beloved Concubine's good intention. Then reluctantly nodded head. Soup bowl cover one open. Inside Palace Hall then filled out a strand of light fragrance. Looking again soup Concubine Tian brought clear as water. Inside only floating a few small pieces snow white crystal clear Tofu and some slender green vegetable leaves. Actually was Pea Shoots.

Now exactly Cold Winter Twelfth Month. Noble as Emperor also very hard to eat fresh vegetables. Fengtai's Cave Goods (Greenhouse) although could provide "Counter-Season Vegetables," no more than Leek, Cucumber kind. Green Leaf Vegetable extremely hard to get. Let alone such fresh Pea Shoots.

Picking up spoon drank a mouthful soup. Soup taste extremely light. Only little bit salt taste and Pea Shoots' clear fragrance. Fresh taste not intense. But after taste in oral cavity had a strand of light fresh sweet. He scooped a piece of Tofu putting into mouth again. Tofu smooth tender incomparable. Completely no bean fishy smell. Not need chewing. Using tongue lightly pressing then broke.

Finished drinking soup, in belly felt warm. Appetite also came back. Praised: "This bowl of soup good! This Tofu is how made to such fine smooth refreshing?"

Noble Consort Tian seeing his face color returning warm. Hurriedly distributed dishes served rice for him. Slowly reported: "This Tofu originally has North South distinction. North Tofu Brine Drop texture coarse. South Tofu used Gypsum Drop so soft tender. Now has new making method. Using Inner Fat (*Nei Zhi* - Lactone) to drop Tofu. Compared to that South Tofu even soft tender hundred times. Most suitable to make soup".

This Inner Fat dropping Tofu was exactly product newly developed by Lingao's Food Factory. Tofu couldn't transport long distance. Had to sell this kind of Inner Fat making Tofu. in Capital also had sales. Had Tofu shops specially buying to produce. Because was "Foreign Goods," price higher than other Tofu. Common people couldn't afford eating.

Court and Kun Thieves although Situation Like Water Fire. But didn't hinder various "Australian Goods" continuing Great Walk Its Way. As for this fresh Pea Shoots. Actually also used Senate Soilless Cultivation Technology produced in Fengtai. Many Light Industry and Agriculture technologies far compared to Senate imagined spread wide.

Actually this Bean Shoots and Tofu and Kun Thieves' relation, Noble Consort Tian was very clear. After all inside this Chengqian Palace Floor Clock, Full Body Dressing Mirror, various Rouge Powder... Many were her father got from Guangdong.

Chongzhen slightly had interest said: "World creation, such wonderful. *Zhen* only heard Brine Drop Tofu. Didn't think still have using Gypsum. Now unexpectedly came out this 'Inner Fat' again. Outside has proverb: 'Brine Drop Tofu One Thing Subdues One Thing'. *Zhen* really want to like dropping Tofu, can find several Capable Ministers Great Generals, drop these Roving Bandits, East Barbarians, Kun Thieves all completely."

Concubine Tian said: "Majesty is Restoring Saint Master, rare in ancient times, natural born Heroic Martial. These Three Bandits sooner or later Plowing Court Sweeping Holes!" Finished speaking, again said: "Imperial Master use meal."

Drank soup, Emperor spirited much. Immediately nodded. Noble Consort Tian immediately let Palace Maids fill rice over. Used dinner. Palace Maids sent tea water. Chongzhen thought of Zheng Sen's matter again. Zheng Family spending money bribing Palace Eunuchs to tribute New Tea. Must possess some intention. In middle probably had person connecting thread handling matter—Manager Eunuch naturally knew. But he not willing to let Eunuch "Succeed." Decided tomorrow personally inquire this matter.
