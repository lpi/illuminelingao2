# Chapter 2674: The Capital (Part 30)

"There is a matter this nephew wishes to trouble Fourth Uncle with." Since this was a private discussion, Wang Yehao dispensed with formalities and spoke plainly.

"Of course, of course." Wang Xiantong grinned broadly. "Fourth Uncle achieved his heart's desire this time—I owe you a great favor!"

"With Fourth Uncle's talent and reputation, it was only natural. This nephew merely helped push the boat along with the current." After exchanging a few courtesies, Wang Yehao produced a wax-sealed paper scroll and handed it over. "I wish to send a message to Liu Zhao. Would that be convenient for Fourth Uncle to arrange?"

"What difficulty could there be?" Wang Xiantong accepted the scroll. "Though we're in the midst of New Year festivities, the *Zhenfusi* [Jinyiwei Office] still has men on duty. I'll have someone dispatch it today."

"Then many thanks to Fourth Uncle." Wang Yehao cupped his hands in gratitude. "May I ask when the message will arrive?"

Wang Xiantong considered for a moment. "The standard postal deadline to Guangzhou Prefecture is fifty-six days. For urgent documents, thirty-two. The *Zhenfusi* also maintains carrier pigeon routes, though those can only convey brief messages—nothing formal. And birds may come to harm along the way, so we typically send critical intelligence through multiple channels simultaneously to ensure nothing is lost."

Wang Yehao calculated the dates in his head, then nodded. "It's not an urgent matter. No need for express delivery. So long as it arrives safely, that will suffice."

"Ha! With our *Zhenfusi* handling the matter, my worthy nephew may rest easy."

Wang Yehao took a sip of tea and allowed himself to relax. Having a relative serving in the *Zhenfusi* truly was convenient. He had come to appreciate its benefits more and more of late—whether gathering intelligence or arranging secret communications, the *Zhenfusi* proved both swifter and more discreet than official channels. Small wonder the Emperors relied on the Factory and Guard as their most trusted instruments.

Setting down his teacup, he continued, "Speaking of *Zhenfusi* personnel—Liu Zhao mentioned a brother of his named Liu Sha who also serves there, though he currently has no assignment. He asked me to find his brother some employment. Does Fourth Uncle know of this person?"

"The name rings a bell. I believe he runs a fortune-telling stall in the South City market. Should have hereditary expertise in geomancy."

"Oh? Liu Zhao recommended him. Does Fourth Uncle think he'd be useful?"

"Before, it would have been hard to say, but lately there might be an opportunity. Who knows what bewitching nonsense those Donglin men fed the Emperor—he actually banned official surveillance, leaving many of our people without their livelihood." Wang Xiantong grumbled briefly, then added, "Liu Sha's group should have been caught up in those cuts as well. If you wish to recruit him now, it shouldn't prove difficult. If my worthy nephew is interested, I'll have him report to your residence tomorrow."

"Good." Wang Yehao nodded thoughtfully. "Speaking of the Emperor's cuts to the Factory and Guard—what plans does Fourth Uncle have?"

Wang Xiantong's brow furrowed. "This is the Sacred Will; naturally, subjects must comply. Yet it is a thorny situation. After the Wei Rebel took his own life to escape punishment, the Eunuch Party has been in a constant state of dread. Wei repeatedly instigated major prison cases during his time—he killed many and accumulated countless blood debts. How could the Donglin Party possibly spare them? I fear even those who merely served in the Factory and Guard under orders will be implicated."

"Fourth Uncle need not worry. This nephew will naturally intercede on the Donglin side. However, Tian Ergeng is beyond saving. Fourth Uncle would do well to make contact quietly and report him first—thus avoiding the disaster of collateral damage while establishing merit for restoring order."

Wang Xiantong started, then immediately offered his praise: "What my worthy nephew says is most reasonable..."

Seeing that Fourth Uncle still harbored some hesitation, Wang Yehao pressed on: "Fourth Uncle, you mustn't waver. Tian Ergeng attached himself to the Wei Rebel and repeatedly instigated major prison cases with brutal methods. Not just the Donglin faction—ministers across the court want him dead. The 'Five Tigers' are marked men; everyone is eager to beat the drowning dog. For Fourth Uncle to report him is simply following the prevailing tide."

In the past, Wang Yehao would never have spoken with such certainty. But ever since "Immortal Zhou's" greatest prophecy—"the Eunuch Party's destruction, the Nine Thousand Years' suicide, Prince Xin's ascension"—had proven true, he trusted the predictions in the "Codebook" without reservation.

Whom to impeach, whom to spare—the Hearthstone Daoist had already provided him with a list. He need only trace the pattern and submit his memorials accordingly. Every strike found its mark.

"Very well, very well—I shall heed your counsel!"

"Just now, Fourth Uncle mentioned that many of your people have lost their livelihoods. This nephew's residence happens to be short-handed at present. If there are any suitable candidates, I hope Fourth Uncle might recommend one or two."

"Of course, of course."

The following afternoon, servants reported to Wang Yehao that a face-reading Daoist was seeking an audience at the gate. He refused to leave even when offered money, insisting he must see the master of the house. When the guards tried to remove him, they found they could not budge him with so much as a brush of his hand.

"...He also claims he came by recommendation—that he's no wandering charlatan."

"Oh? By recommendation?" Wang Yehao surmised this must be Liu Zhao's brother. It seemed the man possessed some genuine skill.

"Let him in." He instructed the servants to bring the visitor to his study.

Before long, a Daoist with grizzled beard and hair appeared before him, his face deeply weathered with lines.

"This poor Daoist, Liu Sha, greets the master." The Daoist flicked his horsetail whisk and bowed with cupped hands.

His clothes were indeed filthy—entirely befitting a physiognomist who made his living in the marketplace. "Conceal one's true nature" was the most basic requirement for a secret operative.

"Daoist Master seeks an audience with me today—may I ask for what purpose?" Wang Yehao feigned ignorance, curious to see how the other would respond.

The Daoist showed no sign of alarm, merely chuckling as he replied: "Recently, this poor Daoist's fortunes have withered, and my purse has grown shy. Hearing that the master of this house seeks to establish an altar for rituals and prayers to dispel misfortune, I have come to offer my services."

Wang Yehao smiled as well and produced the recommendation note Liu Zhao had written earlier. "Does the Daoist Master know Liu Zhao?"

"Liu Zhao is indeed my clan brother. By generational ranking, I must call him Second Brother." The Daoist examined the note and replied, "I heard some time ago that he was serving in your household, though I haven't seen him in two years."

Wang Yehao studied him, feeling a flicker of doubt. Liu Zhao was barely past thirty. He had assumed the brother in question would be no older than forty. Yet the man before him looked to be fifty or sixty at least—yet had to address Liu Zhao as "Second Brother"?

"May I ask the Daoist Master's age?"

Since the note had already revealed his identity, the Daoist dropped the pretense: "Heh. Presumably, the master is already aware. Like Liu Zhao, I too serve in the *Zhenfusi*. Only I don't handle assignments at the Yamen—instead, I run a stall in the south of the city, using the guise of face reading to conduct surveillance and gather intelligence. In the trade of geomancy, if one looks too young, no one trusts the readings, so I deliberately make myself appear older. In truth, I just turned thirty this year."

"It would seem your trade is much like officialdom—one must endure and accumulate seniority." Wang Yehao suppressed a laugh at this. Speaking of youthful appearances, which physiognomist in the *Jianghu* could be more baby-faced than Immortal Zhou? Yet when that man rendered a verdict, his words proved divinely accurate—verified without fail.

"The master jests." Liu Sha waved dismissively and continued, "This costume and appearance merely fool simple folk. When it comes to actual geomancy and Feng Shui, face reading and destiny calculation, one must still rely on true skill."

Wang Yehao stroked his beard thoughtfully. "Since that is so, this official has a difficult matter and wishes to consult you."

"Please speak, master."

"Last year, on my journey back to the capital, I took in two new maids. This official wishes to keep only one—one who is obedient. I would trouble you to select one for me." He immediately ordered servants to bring forth the two maids who had previously attended the Hearthstone Daoist. Since parting ways with that man, the two had essentially been relegated to the Cold Palace for the past half-year. Though they received ample daily provisions, few paid them any attention. Being suddenly summoned to the master's study today, with a strange Daoist standing in the room, left both of them visibly anxious.

Liu Sha understood the master was testing his abilities and dared not be careless. He scrutinized the two maids carefully, then said: "Young ladies, may I see your hands?"

Hearing that the Daoist wished to read their palms, both maids grew bashful. Yet since the head of the household raised no objection, they timidly extended their hands.

Liu Sha examined them for some time, then addressed one: "Might I ask this young lady's name?"

"The name given by Mr. Zhou on the road—it's Zhiling," the maid answered in a trembling voice.

"Mr. Zhou is an advisor in this household," Wang Yehao supplied by way of background.

Liu Sha nodded, then continued addressing Zhiling: "Looking at this young lady's palm lines, I see the face of one reborn after calamity. I expect the harvest in your hometown must be good this year. Leaving the registry and buying back your freedom should not be far off."

"Is what the Daoist Master says truly possible?" The girl's eyes lit up at this, though her gaze dimmed almost immediately. "Alas, my body contract costs twenty taels. Father and Mother probably can't produce such a sum. And if I return home, I'll only suffer the scorn of my brother and sister-in-law. Though there are many rules here, at least no one berates me for eating."

Liu Sha offered her a few words of comfort with a gentle chuckle, then turned to converse with Jieyi. After a while, he stepped back and cupped his hands toward Wang Yehao, indicating he had learned what he needed.

Wang Yehao ordered the two maids to wait outside the door, then asked: "Does the Daoist Master have a recommendation?"

"In my view, the master presides over a great household with numerous servants throughout the residence—it's not as though you cannot afford to feed one or two more mouths. That you choose today to select someone suggests you intend to entrust an extraordinary matter." Liu Sha stole a glance at Wang Yehao's expression. Seeing a flicker of surprise, he knew he had struck true and pressed on: "I venture to speculate that since only one person is being selected, the task must involve secrets and require someone who can hold her tongue. Jieyi is better suited than Zhiling."

"How does the Daoist Master arrive at this judgment?"

"Heh, just a small trick." Liu Sha smiled casually. "I noticed old calluses on Zhiling's hands and determined she came from a farming household—likely sold into service due to a bad harvest year. So I deliberately probed her with a few leading remarks. With barely any effort, she revealed her entire background. By comparison, Jieyi is the more reliable choice."

"Clever method." Wang Yehao nodded in agreement, then asked suddenly, his tone turning cool: "The Daoist Master has been in the capital for some time. Might I ask—have you investigated this official?"

At these words, Liu Sha hastily prostrated himself: "Master, rest assured. I know the rules. Since I am casting my lot with you, I shall be loyal and undivided from this day forward."

"Mm. Serve with all your heart, and this official will not treat you unfairly."

"I thank the master for taking me in." Liu Sha kowtowed three resounding times upon the floor.

After the man rose, Wang Yehao handed him a folding fan. The painting and calligraphy on its face were unremarkable, signed with the name "Shi Weng" [Stone Elder]. Liu Sha examined it briefly, not understanding. Wang Yehao's expression grew solemn as he explained: "Whoever carries this fan is a subordinate of this official. When we meet in the future, it will serve as a token of mutual recognition."
