# Chapter 2483: Stripping the Cocoon (Part 2)

In Xu Tong's view, Vice Commander Yang's greatest strength was her remarkable energy and meticulous attention to detail. But precisely because of this, her methods could only be described as simple and crude—relying entirely on mass-manpower operations, failing to reflect the precision and rigor of proper reconnaissance work.

Section Chief Xu had elaborated in his graduation thesis that relying solely on systems like the "Ten-Person Group" and "Secret Reconnaissance Network" for political security work incurred excessive administrative costs and placed an enormous burden on finances. Given the Senate's current limited financial capacity and personnel training abilities, it was wasteful. If investigators could solve cases using only informants, technical appraisers, and tracking teams, what was the point of professional courses like "Investigative Science" and "Psychology" taught by the Senators?

As a first-generation professionally trained graduate stationed in Guangzhou, his first act as Investigation Section Chief was to veto the plan to establish extensive reconnaissance networks throughout the city. Instead, he proposed close cooperation with the National Police's Section 9, focusing on "informant" intelligence from within the police system. Through Section 9, they would form an intelligence-sharing arrangement. At the grassroots level, they lacked the police's resources—forcing the construction of a separate system simply wasn't worth the effort.

Wu Mu had found the plan feasible. The Senate currently harbored considerable suspicion toward the Political Security system, and increasing "transparency" through police cooperation was indeed reasonable. Meanwhile, Section 9 found itself in an awkward position of "ambiguous positioning." Strengthening cooperation would benefit both sides. The proposal was quickly confirmed through talks between Guo Yi and Ran Yao. Now the Guangzhou Political Security Branch received two weekly reports from the police: "Weekly Case Situation" and "Weekly Social Situation." When surveillance work needed strengthening or certain intelligence needed collecting, it could be done through Section 9's channels.

According to Senate tradition, various powerful agencies held a monthly "Internal Security Meeting" for intelligence exchange and resource sharing. As institutions expanded, a weekly regular meeting could no longer meet demand, so a coordinating body called the "Internal Security Meeting Affairs Bureau" was established to handle daily assistance requests and intelligence sharing. This bureau had also established a branch in Guangzhou, with Xu Tong serving as person in charge.

Xu Tong had harbored some resentment when Yang Cao was "parachuted" into Guangzhou to head the "Special Task Force" for the Witchcraft Case. This was his territory, after all, and her sudden arrival effectively placed a superior over him. Moreover, he rather disapproved of her investigative methods.

Yang Cao said: "Don't be fooled by surface appearances. The Liang family might be using account corrections as a pretext to simultaneously dispose of evidence of anti-Song activities—sacrificing the small to hide the big, cutting off the tail to survive. His meetings with Director Zheng and others might be a vain attempt to repair relationships. Not touching on substantive issues might indicate hesitation before defecting, but more likely it's stalling for time or testing the government's attitude. I never harbor illusions about such hidebound, stubborn gentry landlords. This tax audit has clearly brought him considerable pressure. Since he wants to destroy evidence, that proves evidence exists. All departments must accelerate their efforts. How is the defection recruitment going? Has the list been compiled?"

Pulling out and striking in—this was a key element of reconnaissance work. But frankly, it had achieved little against the Liang family.

Xu Tong flipped through the folder: "Compiled." He took out a list and handed it over, reporting: "Forty-three people total, including those from the periphery, the inner residence, business partners, and 'same-year' examination candidates. The Liang family has deep roots—they've operated in Guangzhou for over a dozen generations. The inner courtyard is exceedingly secure."

Inside the Liang residence, only household-born servants of two or three generations or slaves who had received "the heavy grace of life and death" had any opportunity to contact the core. The report stated: those serving Liang Cunhou were all women who never went out on ordinary days, effectively living in confinement. Even their parents and relatives could only see them once a year. Striking in was impossible. Their only hope was to "pull someone out."

"...We have direct or indirect contact with thirty-nine people on the list. To avoid alerting the enemy, we adopted gradual infiltration through relationships—relatives, friends, colleagues, and fellow townsmen. Through interlocking connections, we approach the core personnel layer by layer. We use these relationships to win over personnel and obtain intelligence. But to ensure we don't tip our hand, this method cannot be rushed, so progress has been slow and we haven't achieved significant breakthroughs yet."

Yang Cao nodded while studying the list carefully: "Mm, accelerate the pace. We cannot wait any longer. Many key pieces of evidence, once gone, can never be retrieved. Screen this list again, narrow the scope, and concentrate on a few key targets. Many conditions can be laid out directly for negotiation. Don't be afraid to make promises, and don't be afraid to take responsibility. We must move quickly, break into the Liang family's interior, and obtain reliable intelligence sources. Currently, many established clans and great families in Guangzhou still yearn for the Ming State. The more our new policies advance, the less willing they are to have their vested interests stripped away. The Liang family is typical—we need him."

Xu Tong said: "Understood, I will handle it immediately upon returning. Tomorrow the screening results..."

Yang Cao cut him off: "Tonight."

Xu Tong said: "Tonight, the screening results will be presented to you."

Xu Tong closed the door and left. Only Yang Cao remained in the room. The setting sun's afterglow burned the horizon golden-red, spilling through the window as if draping her in a gilded cloak. She stared fixedly at Liang Cunhou's photo on the blackboard, as if the two were locked in a silent contest. After a long moment, Yang Cao whispered: "Liang Cunhou, do you see it? This is the gaze of the General Bureau of Political Security."

That evening, the clerk delivered the screening list, materials on the tax case investigation, and assistance documents. Yang Cao pulled out the directory of the tax investigation from the kraft paper file bag and quickly browsed it. When she saw the line "Focus inspection on Lin, Liang, and Shi households as circumstances permit; report to Director Ai Zhixin for review," she frowned involuntarily and whispered: "Such ugly handwriting."

Though she had learned opera since childhood and had been illiterate—let alone able to write—she had quickly developed a fine hand in the training class. She had even won a grand prize in the Political Security System's calligraphy competition.

As for the list, it still left her unsatisfied. It failed to reach the people around Liang Cunhou. But a few names did seem promising.

Human nature has its weaknesses. Yang Cao had seen too many of them, but she also knew that once beliefs were formed—whether others thought them right or wrong—many people would persist to the end. And the Liang family was seasoned, deeply practiced in the art of winning hearts.

Since the Witchcraft Case, the Liang family's properties inside and outside the city had been filled with informants, watching every move twenty-four hours a day. Yet as soon as members of the Liang family entered the residence, it was like fish disappearing into the sea—not a single bit of news leaked out.

The masters of the Liang family lived in seclusion and rarely ventured out, except for relatives' weddings and funerals. Stewards handled everything. Even when they did go out, they moved only between the residence and various villas.

"This bunch of slippery eels!" Yang Cao thought. "Not only impossible to grasp, but hiding so tightly! I truly have no way to deal with them."

The office door knocked, and a clerk entered:

"Comrade Regional Vice Commander, the Guangzhou City Internal Security Meeting is about to start..."

"I'm coming immediately." Yang Cao stubbed out her cigarette, tidied the documents on her table, and locked the file cabinet.

More than a dozen people sat in a circle in the small conference room. Steam curled from the tea in front of each. These were all backbone members of the Guangzhou Political Security Branch. They whispered and exchanged opinions before the meeting, speculating about its purpose.

The content could be guessed without much thought—it had to be the follow-up to the Witchcraft Case. Though the case was said to be closed, the root behind it had never been dug out. It remained a sore point for the Political Security Bureau.

Before long, the click-clack of leather shoes came from outside the door. Yang Cao walked in carrying a folder, her posture upright. Her ear-length short hair and fitted uniform made her look vigorous and capable. Her face was somewhat gaunt from overwork, her facial contours sharpened, lending her an air of bleak severity.

The conference room instantly fell silent. Yang Cao took the central seat at the horseshoe-shaped table and said: "The purpose of this impromptu meeting is primarily to adjust our recent work focus. We will conduct a comprehensive review of anti-Song forces in Guangzhou. This meeting is classified Top Secret; its content must not be leaked." She nodded to Xu Tong, signaling the start.

Xu Tong rose calmly, walked to the blackboard at the front, nodded to those assembled, and spoke: "Hello everyone. This meeting will primarily analyze the current situation of local hidden anti-Song forces and our countermeasures. The content is divided into three points: One, the general attitude of local gentry in Guangzhou toward the Australian Song regime. Two, the main characteristics and actions of anti-Song forces. Three, our countermeasures."

Xu Tong continued: "First, because the Senate essentially took over the Guangzhou regime peacefully, we made certain concessions to ensure a smooth transition of power. We did not conduct detailed screening and investigation of the traditional gentry and landlord class in Guangzhou city. During the rapid takeover, the Guangzhou landlord class showed almost no reaction—no organized militia training, no resistance, no funding of enemies, no spying. But this wasn't because they didn't want to react—they simply had no time. The quick and peaceful capture of the city reduced our losses, but it also left significant hidden dangers for our subsequent governance, preventing us from quickly and cleanly liquidating hostile forces."
