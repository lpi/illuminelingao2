# Chapter 2520: Xunfeng Night Banquet

At the foot of Xunfeng Mountain, the frost brought by the cold wave caused the leaves and branches of many evergreen trees to wither and fall. Even Guangzhou Prefecture, which was like spring all year round, showed a sense of bleakness. Xunfeng Mountain was called a mountain, but in reality, its altitude was only over eighty meters; it would be just a small mound if placed in a real mountainous area.

Shabei Village at the foot of the mountain was located more than ten li northwest of Guangzhou City. The Chen clan had settled here since the Shaoxing era of the Southern Song Dynasty when their ancestor Chen Kangyan served as an official in Lingnan.

Inside the Buddhist hall of the Chen residence, a white-haired old woman was chanting sutras and worshipping Buddha. After finishing the chanting, the old woman was about to stand up when a young son standing aside quickly stepped forward to support her.

Only after the old woman sat down did the two sons take their seats, while the daughter-in-law, grandsons, grand-daughters-in-law, and unmarried daughters stood in attendance at the side.

"Mother, the Buddhist hall at home is simply furnished, and there are no famous temples or eminent monks around the village. It is also very inconvenient for Mother to go to Buddhist temples in other places to participate in Buddhist assemblies. When Father passed away to the west, I went to the capital to take up a post and failed to serve Mother. The turmoil in official circles also caused Mother to be frightened. Thinking about it today, this son feels deeply guilty and uneasy day and night. Now that I have returned to my hometown, I should naturally let Mother live some peaceful days and prolong happiness and longevity. There are many monasteries on Baiyun Mountain north of Guangzhou City. This son has found a geomantic treasure land beside Baiyun Temple and wishes to build a villa. Within the mountain villa, I will build a nunnery and sculpt statues for Mother to offer incense and worship Buddha, and invite a few virtuous eminent monks every month to perform rituals, so as to fulfill filial piety." The speaker was tall, with sharp angular features, a large mouth, and sparse eyebrows. He grew a long goatee on his chin, giving a sense of mature stability and security.

"Zizhuang, Mother is deeply delighted that you have this filial heart. However, you say building a new mountain villa costs a great deal. Now that the family and country are undergoing great changes and bandits are usurping Lingnan, my Chen clan has received imperial grace for generations and should destroy the family fortune to relieve the national crisis. Being loyal is being filial." The old woman turned the rosary in her hand. She was very satisfied with her son's filial piety but refused very firmly.

The old woman was a daughter of the Zhu clan of Jiujiang. Jiujiang had been bestowed the name "Confucian Forest Township" since the reign of Emperor Daizong of the Ming Dynasty, and the Confucian atmosphere was very strong. Her father, Zhu Rang, was a *jinshi* in the thirty-second year of Wanli (1603), served as a secretary in the Ministry of Revenue, and was later transferred to be the Prefect of Kuizhou. Among Zhu's descendants, there also emerged Kang Youwei's teacher—"Master Jiujiang" Zhu Ciqi. The Lady Zhu received Confucian education from a young age, knew books and rites, and could be said to be a model for women in Confucian feudal ethics.

Her eldest son was the head of the "Three Loyalists of Lingnan" who would leave a good name for later generations—Chen Zizhuang.

Chen Zizhuang, courtesy name Jisheng, pseudonym Qiutao, was the *Tanhua* (Third Place) of the First Class in the Imperial Examination of the thirty-seventh year of Wanli. Chen Zizhuang was upright in his official career and once fiercely denounced the Eunuch Party in front of the Tianqi Emperor. Later, Wei Zhongxian cited phrases like "a mediocre ruler loses power, a wise ruler grasps power" in the policy questions he submitted to the Emperor while presiding over the Hangzhou provincial examination, labeling it as "slander," and both father and son were stripped of their official posts. After Chongzhen ascended the throne, Chen Zizhuang was reinstated, promoted to Junior Supervisor of the Household of the Heir Apparent and Academician Reader-in-Waiting of the Hanlin Academy, then served as Right Vice Minister of Rites. Later, due to a temporary vacancy in the head of the Ministry of Rites (Minister), he acted as the presiding official of the Ministry of Rites affairs.

Chen Zizhuang had experienced the ups and downs of the official sea and was now in his forties. Recalling the time when he passed the imperial examination as *Tanhua*, riding a swift horse in the spring breeze of success, it exactly fulfilled the verse he blurted out at the age of seven: "Wait for me to tour the Imperial Garden in another year; finding the opportunity as Tanhua to ask after Chang'e." He served as an official in the same court as his father, and initially, there were happy memories.

But the encounters in recent years gave him a deep sense of powerlessness regarding the current situation.

Since the Tianqi era, the Donglin Party and the Eunuch Party had crushed each other. In peaceful times, this wouldn't shake the foundations of the state, but the affairs in Liaodong were eroding. In the first year of Chongzhen, his fellow townsman and fellow *jinshi* graduate of the same year, Yuan Chonghuan, was also reinstated by the new Emperor, promoted to Minister of War and Right Vice Censor-in-Chief, supervising the army in Jiliao. Chen Zizhuang prepared a grand farewell gathering for him, and the poems and paintings of the nineteen attendees were compiled into a scroll, "Picture of Farewell Banquet for Supervising Liao." Unfortunately, Yuan Chonghuan did not wait for "success" before he was sentenced to death by slow slicing by the unfathomable Emperor. The signature on the "Picture of Farewell Banquet for Supervising Liao" was also gouged out by the collector, leaving only the four characters "Fu Gong Ya Zou" inscribed by him.

With strong enemies outside and rebellions inside, the civil unrest in the northwest in the early years of Chongzhen had now become a prairie fire. August of the seventh year of Chongzhen was the most depressing time in his decades of life. His mentor, Right Administration Vice Commissioner Lu Menglong, held fast to Longde City in Guyuan Prefecture, Shaanxi. After the city broke, he was killed by the peasant army. When the news came, the capital was shocked. Chongzhen posthumously awarded Lu Menglong the title of Chief Minister of the Court of the Imperial Stud and personally held a memorial ceremony. As the Right Vice Minister of Rites, Chen Zizhuang held back the grief of losing his mentor and friend to preside over the memorial ceremony.

In the eighth year of Chongzhen, the two rebel armies of Gao Yingxiang and Zhang Xianzhong captured the Middle Capital Fengyang and dug up the Emperor's ancestral mausoleum. When the Chongzhen Emperor learned of this, he was extremely grief-stricken. In a rage, he had the Censor-in-Chief of Grain Transport Yang Yipeng, who failed to rescue in time, beheaded in the market. Then he changed into plain clothes to offer sacrifices to the Imperial Ancestral Temple and hid in the Wuying Hall, refusing to come out. The ministers dared not speak, but felt the matter was significant and the Emperor should give an account of the event. Thus, Chen Zizhuang submitted a memorial saying, "When the graves of commoners are damaged even by a handful of earth or a single tree, there is none who does not suffer patiently without outburst." Since it concerned the change of the Imperial Ancestral Mausoleum, one could not bow and rise with others; the Emperor should issue a "Penitential Edict." This was adopted by Chongzhen. Chen Zizhuang also proposed twelve suggestions targeting current politics, ten of which the Emperor adopted. This encouraged him and made him proud.

However, the gifts of fate had long been secretly marked with a price. Also in the first month of this year, Chongzhen issued a decree requiring that if any descendants of the imperial clan had civil or military talents worthy of employment, the Clan Court could list their names and report them. After testing by the court, they could be conferred official positions. Chongzhen's approach was obviously a manifestation of dissatisfaction with the existing officials within his vision. But this measure violated the ancestral rule set by Zhu Yuanzhang that the imperial clan "can only be titled but not given official positions." Chen Zizhuang pondered repeatedly, deliberated with friends and colleagues, revised his draft three times, and finally submitted a memorial opposing it to the Emperor. As a result, this matter became known to the Prince of Tang, who impeached Chen Zizhuang in front of Chongzhen. consequently, Chongzhen imprisoned him for "acting recklessly and deceiving the sovereign regarding non-ancestral kin matters."

In the Ministry of Justice prison, there were sixty-six officials imprisoned at the same time as Chen Zizhuang. Besides him, there were twenty-three minister-level officials, including Chen Qiyu, the Governor-General of Five Provinces' Military Affairs, who mistakenly believed Li Zicheng's feigned surrender at Chexiang Gorge in Shaanxi, allowing the peasant army to revive from death. In the end, thanks to the pleas of many colleagues and the Empress Dowager, Chen Zizhuang was released, stripped of office, and sent back home.

Chen Zizhuang cried bitterly and kowtowed at Qianmen in the capital, bidding farewell to the Emperor. He mounted a donkey, boarded a boat at Lu River to return south, and wrote "Lu River Reflections":

*People shouted at the short donkey along the path,*
*Were the willows at the Green Gate willing to be sparse?*
*The crane in the opened cage enjoys riding the carriage,*
*The fish in the dry rut rejoices deeply upon getting water.*

*Dreams race ahead beyond the heavens to enact a return alive,*
*The unfinished books in the box have not yet been burned.*
*Xing Gong does not wag his tongue lightly,*
*How can I seek you to compose the poem of Suichu?*

Who would have thought that before he even reached home, he heard that the Kun thieves had already occupied Guangzhou City? If he returned to the capital at this time, perhaps the Chongzhen Emperor, who lacked soldiers and generals, would appoint him to a position like Governor-General of Southern Gan, mobilizing troops from several provinces to assist Xiong Wencan in suppressing the Kun thieves. But anxious about his mother, he whipped his horse and hurried back to Guangzhou before the Kun thieves blockaded the passes.

This powerlessness that worldly affairs did not change according to one's will made Chen Zizhuang feel quite depressed. He wanted to build the Cloud Gurgling Villa actually with another painstaking effort: one to pray for his mother's longevity, and one to consume his heroic ambitions.

"The shifting of hills and valleys is not my business; laughter, tears, and indifference follow the human stage." He still remembered clearly the life insights he had when leaving the capital. He himself also wanted to use this ancient Buddha of the blue lamp to tidy up his mood.

"Mother's teaching is correct. This son will definitely not disgrace the family style and vows to contend with those Kun thieves to the end to restore my Great Ming rivers and mountains." Chen Zizhuang replied respectfully, but in reality, he was quite lost inside.

"Big Brother, do you still remember the extraordinary man, Mr. Yanye, I mentioned to you?" The speaker was the young man who had just supported Old Lady Zhu, Chen Zizhuang's younger brother Chen Zisheng, who was nineteen years younger than him.

"I remember. When I was in the capital, I corresponded with him. This person knows the pros and cons of ancient and modern times and harbors great strategies for economy and statecraft. It's just a pity that he failed the examinations repeatedly; it is truly a loss for the Sacred One."

Mr. Yanye was Chen Bangyan, one of the "Three Loyalists of Lingnan," courtesy name Lingbin, pseudonym Yanye. When Chen Zizhuang was in the capital, Chen Zisheng interacted frequently with Chen Bangyan, Li Suiqiu, and others, and their relationship was extraordinary.

Chen Zisheng said, "A few days ago, Mr. Yanye met with me secretly. He wishes to visit Big Brother to discuss major events together."

"It seems my Lingnan is not entirely full of good-for-nothings and people who covet wealth and forget righteousness. Chen Lingbin is loyal to the sovereign and cares for the country, and is proficient in Confucian studies. Shangyong, Shangyan, and Shangtu, these three children can study with him." Chen Zizhuang stroked his beard.

At this moment, a gate boy came to report, "Master, First Master Li, First Master Kuang, and First Master Chen have all arrived and are in the front courtyard."

"Good, quickly invite them to the rear hall living room to meet. Order the maids to serve the best tea to the distinguished guests." Chen Zizhuang said with a grave expression.

Although Li Suiqiu and Kuang Lu were six or seven years younger than Chen Zizhuang, they frequently exchanged poems with Chen Zizhuang and were old friends for many years. When seeing off Yuan Chonghuan to supervise Liao back then, both were present. Li Suiqiu even regarded Chen Zizhuang as a teacher, and their friendship was extraordinary. But it was the first time for Chen Bangyan to meet Chen Zizhuang.

Taking leave of Old Lady Zhu, the brothers walked quickly to the reception hall in the rear. Chen Zisheng came to Chen Bangyan's side and introduced, "Big Brother, this is Mr. Yanye of Longshan, Shunde. He set up a school under Jinyan Ridge to give lectures. Scholars from far and near came upon hearing the news, numbering in the hundreds every year, having quite some momentum."

Chen Bangyan cupped his hands and said, "Qiaosheng [Chen Zisheng] praises me wrongly; I am just scraping a living. I have long heard of Master Qiutao's great name, but unfortunately, Master was an official in the capital and we could not meet. It is truly the fortune of three lifetimes to have this fate today. Meizhou [Li Suiqiu], Zhanruo [Kuang Lu], I trust you have been well since we parted."

Li Suiqiu and Kuang Lu had also known Chen Bangyan for a long time. After some exchange of pleasantries, the host and guests took their seats in order.

Chen Zizhuang knew clearly that not a single word of what was to be discussed today could enter the ears of the Kun thieves; otherwise, it would be a disaster of family extermination. So he dismissed the attendants and drove all the maids and servants to the front courtyard.

Chen Zizhuang looked around, steadied his mind, and opened his mouth to say, "Gentlemen coming today is certainly not for matters of wind, flowers, snow, and moon. The current situation is rotten and out of control. How can we restore the Great Ming rivers and mountains and expel the giant bandits? Although I once ascended the Temple of the Son of Heaven, I am now a field farmer without three heads and six arms. Today, those in the room are all confidants. Whatever insights you gentlemen have, feel free to speak your minds freely."
