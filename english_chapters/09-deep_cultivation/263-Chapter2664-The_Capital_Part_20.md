# Chapter 2664: The Capital (Part 20)

"...Delong has some grasp of the Xia family's client situation." Li Rufeng said, "Manager Wu will go back to check now; there must be news tomorrow."

"The clients of the Shanxi Houses are either rich or noble. The noble people have always been particular about 'a cunning rabbit having three burrows.' I'm afraid it won't be easy to find the exact mastermind." Liao Sanniang was not as optimistic as him. "Without using some extraordinary means, I'm afraid it will be difficult to find the real culprit..."

"Could it be you want to..." Li Rufeng knew this colleague quite well. Probably because a woman couldn't establish a foothold in the *Jianghu* without a ruthlessness surpassing ordinary people, Liao Sanniang was famous in the Beijing Station for her decisive and ruthless actions.

"Just thinking." Liao Sanniang smiled. "The managers and shopkeepers in the Shanxi Houses are not ordinary people. Unless it reaches the point of 'the fish dies or the net breaks,' we can't touch them."

Speaking of this, both felt the future was bleak. The opponent's mind was meticulous; they probably already knew their investigation path and cut it off early.

"I wonder what regulations the Center will give us." Li Rufeng said.

On the day of the incident, they sent a co-signed emergency telegram immediately to report the situation to the "Center" and request instructions. But so far, apart from the reply confirming receipt, the only instruction was asking them to "stabilize the situation and report daily."

Presumably, a matter like a missing Senator was also a major event in Lingao. It must require some discussion before there is a result.

Liao Sanniang frowned, clenched her right hand into a fist, and lightly pounded her left hand, saying, "It seems we still have to keep calm."

A scream of "Ah" came from a side room in the backyard of the escort agency. After a while, the door creaked, and a man nearing fifty walked out. It was Old Feng, a senior worker of the escort agency. A cigarette butt hung from the corner of his mouth, the fire having already burned to the filter. Old Feng wiped his hands with a cloth, which gave off a strong smell of alcohol.

Little Bazi walked quickly to meet him and said, "Uncle Feng, set properly?"

The escort agency sold martial arts. People were the greatest wealth, and interpersonal connections were extremely tight. They addressed each other as Senior Brother, Junior Brother, Uncle, and Uncle-Master.

Old Feng gave a noncommittal "En," picked a clean stone to sit on, sucked the last puff of the cigarette butt hard, and then reluctantly spat out the filter.

Seeing this, Little Bazi reached into his bosom, took out a cloth bundle, opened it preciously, revealing three crumpled paper cigarettes wrapped inside. He presented the cigarettes and said respectfully, "Uncle Feng, please continue."

Old Feng's face immediately lit up with joy. He first took two and tucked them behind his ears, then picked up one and held it horizontally under his nose, closing his eyes and sniffing vigorously, looking intoxicated.

After a long while, Old Feng opened his eyes and asked, "Holy Ship brand?"

Little Bazi said, "Yes, the Chief Escort said one doesn't cough smoking this."

Old Feng asked again, "Where did it come from? You don't smoke?"

Little Bazi shook his head and said, "Rewarded by the Chief Escort. I don't smoke. Sanniangzi says there are 'nails in the mud' in this smoke that prick the lung leaves."

Old Feng obviously sniffed at this baseless rumor and said, "So many people in the Great Song smoke; I haven't heard of anyone pricking their mouth smoking. Besides, having not eaten a few full meals, maybe someone will chop off your head tomorrow—what are you afraid of 'nails in the mud' for?"

A match was struck and then shaken out. The red cigarette butt lit up again, flickering like a red star.

Smoking the cigarette, the relationship between the two immediately became much closer.

Old Feng said, "The injuries of those three are just dislocations. After setting, they are no different from healthy people. The bones of those three bandit fellows are very hard; not easy to set. They can be sent away in a while."

Little Bazi squatted down, hugged his knees, looked up, and said, "Uncle Feng, since there's time, tell me about Lingao, will you?"

Old Feng took a puff of smoke like an immortal, exhaled a cloud of smoke, and said, "Nothing much to tell. I can't describe the goodness of Lingao either; it's just a place where you can eat your fill every meal."

Little Bazi laughed, "I don't believe it. If there is such an immortal place, why did you come to Beijing City?"

Old Feng laughed, "That Lingao is good, but 'a day without work is a day without food.' One cannot be idle for a moment; work one day, eat one day. It absolutely won't starve anyone to death. But wanting to eat well and dress well is not easy either. I only have this life as capital. Coming to this capital city to fight knives with people, my family in Lingao can have refined rice and fine flour to eat."

Little Bazi asked, "Uncle Feng, is your martial arts very good?"

Old Feng smiled slyly and said, "Although my martial arts are loose and I can't be an escort leader, I can set bones and treat falls and injuries. I have some *Jianghu* experience, and the overseas subsidy is high. Coming here, although only being a worker, the money is quite a lot. Serving the Chief Escort and helping out."

Little Bazi was silent for a while and said, "Uncle Feng, Sanniangzi said she would take me and my brother to Lingao. Is it true?"

Old Feng said indifferently, "What does this count as? Guangzhou is short of people now. They only fear no one comes; they don't fear big bellies [big eaters]. It's just buying two more boat tickets." He looked Little Bazi up and down and smiled, "You are young. Lingao likes young people like you. Going there, you have a great future."

Little Bazi smiled embarrassedly and said, "I dare not think of a future. I only seek to live a life without worry about food and clothing!"

Taking a puff of smoke, Old Feng asked, "You are called Bazi [Eighth Son]; are there eight brothers?"

Little Bazi shook his head and said, "No. The first two brothers died right after birth. Mother said to leave a few 'yin positions' empty to block disaster. My ninth brother and I are just two brothers."

Old Feng said, "Parents?"

Little Bazi drew a circle on the ground with his hand and whispered, "Gone."

Old Feng didn't ask further. He reached out and ruffled Little Bazi's head, saying, "Sanniangzi says your mind is quick and you handle things clearly. You are someone who can become a man. Work hard. Young man, there is a path ahead."

The two were silent for a moment. Old Feng suddenly asked, "Have you killed anyone?"

Little Bazi was stunned, his eyes flickered, and he didn't answer.

Old Feng said, "If you have killed people, you don't treat people as humans anymore, just treating people like pigs and dogs. In chaotic times, human life is like dirt. Like this smoke, one breath and it scatters."

Speaking of this, Old Feng gently blew a smoke ring and continued, "Those coming out of this escort agency are all unwilling to do evil. We keep a word of 'Chivalry' at the bottom of our hearts. Integrity and justice as the foundation, promises first. Knowing etiquette, submitting to control, knowing human life is precious, not willing to kill indiscriminately. Being able to guard a piece of sky in one's own heart in this chaotic world makes one a first-class character. Going to Guangzhou to eat a mouthful of rice is not hard."

Old Feng added, "Having killed people, the heart becomes hard. Just like Sanniangzi: when she looks at you with cold eyebrows and angry eyes, she wants to kill you; when she treats you with tenderness and affection, she also wants to kill you. Look at that warm face—underneath is just a heart of stone."

Hearing this, Little Bazi asked curiously, "Uncle Feng, what is Sanniangzi's background? I never heard her mention it."

Old Feng said, "Speaking of it, it's not strange. Her family was originally an escort family in this North Zhili. Her hometown is in the Baoding and Langfang area. There are many people practicing martial arts there. One is to take the military examination to join the army and earn a future; the second is to be bodyguards. People in the North Zhili area are familiar with the land and people, so later when dispatching, a woman like her was sent to this Beijing. Her family was a strong clan in the countryside, counted as a local power. The Liao family advocated bravery and refined martial arts for several generations and had some connections with Shopkeeper Sun. The two sides claimed a lineage of the same sect. Qiwei's Shopkeeper Sun received much help from her father for his escort routes in North Zhili. Later, disasters struck, locally rising bandits made trouble, and there was no way to live. The whole family fled famine to other places to seek acquaintances. *Heihei*, no matter how strong your skill is, with one person and one knife, how can you fight against this world? The Liao family traveled a thousand *li* to throw themselves at Shopkeeper Sun. The escort business has always shared clothing and food. Shopkeeper Sun is most loyal; when friends come to join, he would pawn his house and sell his land to take care of them. So the Liao family took root in Guangzhou. At that time, there was no Great Song yet, and Qiwei's business wasn't this big. En, speaking of which, I have even met Sanniang's father. It is said that when Sanniangzi was in the countryside back then, there was a stone mill at the head of the village. A group of young men practicing martial arts often competed there to see who could lift it. After several rounds, only a very few could pry up a seam. At that time, Sanniangzi was just a teenager, only fourteen years old. Seeing the crowd noisy and looking impatient, she went up, hugged that millstone, and walked three circles around the mill stake. Since then, she had the nickname 'Liao Three-Millstones' in the countryside."

Little Bazi marveled, "Sanniangzi had such divine strength when she was young?"

Old Feng laughed, "In the Song Dynasty, Han Shizhong was invincible in his village at age ten, called 'Rascal Han the Fifth.' People have a thousand colors, each with peculiarities. How can we generalize?"

Little Bazi continued asking, "And later?"

Old Feng said, "After a year, Sanniang came to Guangzhou. At sixteen, she followed her father on escort missions. Because mixing men and women was inconvenient, she rarely went on outside escorts. She was extremely prudent. At first, she only guarded female relatives and property for wealthy families and officials' inner residences. This job is not easy to do. In fact, one person has to serve as guarantor, silver guard, property guard, nursing home guard, and night watchman all in one body. There are also all kinds of unclear accounts between men and women in the inner residence. Unless one is fine and smooth, one cannot do it."

Old Feng took a puff of smoke and continued, "Later, the things Sanniang did became more and more. I am not very clear about the things afterward. Being in the escort business for a long time, fighting is inevitable. Knives and spears have no eyes. Even if martial arts are exquisite and strong, just having the skin scratched by a rusty iron knife can cause one to die of pus sores and bad blood. Fighting with real weapons is not for fun. Although there is Australian Divine Medicine now that can save people even if injured, that medicine is precious and not everyone can use it. Back then without such good things, fighting was even more dangerous; people died at the drop of a hat. Legend has it that Sanniangzi encountered strong bandits repeatedly over a few years, surviving twenty knife battles without injury, earning the title 'Golden Feather Phoenix,' taking the meaning of unbreakable and undying. It is truly incredible. But the words of the *Jianghu* are mostly big talk and intimidation, false words to strengthen reputation. One cannot believe them all."

Speaking of this, Old Feng shook his head, obviously not quite believing this incredible combat record. After a moment, he said again, "Later on, the Australians came. Shopkeeper Sun climbed up to the Australians. Sanniangzi's road became even wider. In just a few years, she rose to her current position. She will definitely prosper in the future. It is said she is quite appreciated by a female official surnamed Du of the Great Song. It wouldn't be strange for her to be an Australian Song female official in the future. Official Du says she is a 'Representative of New Era Women's Rights,' wanting to kill until the heads of Great Ming gentry men with groups of wives and concubines roll. Scray, scary."

Hearing this, Little Bazi nodded, having an idea in his heart secretly. He must bow to Liao Sanniang as his godmother to fight for a brilliant future for himself and his brother.
