# Chapter 2404: Reorganizing the Family Business (I)

For the Australians to suddenly wade into this muddy water, it was impossible without a powerful killer move. Just like when the Australians came to Guangzhou to sell paper back then; within a year, they beat the local paper goods into falling flowers and flowing water. Regardless of quality or price, no product on the market could compete with similar products of Australian Paper.

This Australian Cloth, who knew what unique points it had?

"Then Nephew will show his incompetence. First, speak of this cloth. This cloth is similar to Songjiang fine cloth, but not as exquisite as top-grade Songjiang cloth. It looks a bit loose and not thick enough. This cloth is a bit strange; the surface feels somewhat like cotton cloth, but when bent, it isn't as soft as cotton cloth, appearing stiff and somewhat like linen. I suspect the cotton was mixed and spun with something else. This one is ordinary hemp cloth, even worse than medium hemp cloth; the hairiness here is particularly high, and the weaving craftsmanship looks about the same as farm cloth, slightly distant compared to the weaving workshops on the market." Chen Lin evaluated the cloth samples one by one.

Wu Yijun stroked the beard on his chin and looked with approval, saying: "Worthy Nephew is indeed from a weaving family; I couldn't see these tricks at all." Chen Lin was a relative of his mother's family, and their silk workshop was also somewhat famous locally. He deemed pointed to the yarn on the side and said: "Come look at these yarns."

Chen Lin picked up the yarn, twisted it in his hand, then tried to pull their fibers apart one by one, pulled a few more times, and said: "This yarn is fine and tough, a top product. Ordinary spinning women cannot make it; it requires a skilled hand of ten years to spin yarn of such quality."

At this time, many textile workshops integrated spinning and weaving. Cotton yarn trade was relatively small, so Chen Lin just took a general look.

Wu Yijun nodded, expressing satisfaction, and said: "Is Worthy Nephew interested in manufacturing this item?"

This time Chen Lin was confused, saying, "Could it be there are skillful craftsmen available for hire?"

Hearing this, Wu Yijun smiled and said: "Haha, no, no. This is made by machine." He immediately explained his meaning, which was to want him to go back and reopen that textile workshop, then transform it into cotton spinning. The Short-hairs had even better machines over there that could weave even better yarn. If Chen Lin was willing, he could invest money as shares and find the Short-hairs to introduce equipment and technology. Chen Lin's village was at the border of Nanhai County and Sihui; the North River flowed through the locale. Not only were water resources abundant, but one could also reach Guangzhou by flowing downstream. Water transport was convenient.

"...Looking at the Australians' meaning, they want to greatly develop cotton spinning in Guangdong—and rightly so. Just going down to the South Seas, how many clothes, sails, and bedding would be needed? This is truly a heaven-sent opportunity to make money!"

Chen Lin, however, was not as excited as his cousin-uncle. His family had done silk for generations and never touched cotton spinning. As the old saying goes, "Interlacing professions is like being separated by mountains." Sericulture and cotton planting were two completely different trades. The merchants handling them were different, and the thresholds were also different. Craftsmen also couldn't just switch if they said switch.

If they couldn't produce it, they couldn't deliver goods. What use was even the biggest business?

Cousin-uncle's idea was somewhat whimsical. But Chen Lin couldn't say so, so he said:

"This matter is significant. Nephew also must go back to discuss with the clan relatives at home before making a decision."

"In that case, you go back to the hometown first to manage household affairs. I saw in the newspaper that the four countrysides have been pacified, and the chaotic soldiers and bandits in Northern Guangdong have retreated; there should be no major obstruction in safety. After you go back, reorganize the family business first. Come back to Guangzhou Prefecture to discuss with me in some days. After great chaos, I fear there will be many places to spend money. I have already asked the accountant to prepare one hundred silver dollars; you take it home to use."

"How can this be..." Although Chen Lin was moved, he also understood that this money without cause was not so easy to take. Besides, Wu Yijun was only his cousin-uncle; taking him in back then was already great benevolence and virtue. Now suddenly giving one hundred yuan—he had to weigh it if he took it. So he declined repeatedly, saying "it's too much."

"Worthy Nephew, you don't need to decline. Cousin-uncle isn't giving this money for free. You will inevitably have expenses reorganizing the family business—consider it Cousin-uncle lending it to you. If you are willing to partner with Cousin-uncle in the future, this money counts as Cousin-uncle's share capital. If unwilling, return it to Cousin-uncle when your hand is loose."

With words spoken to this extent, Chen Lin couldn't decline well. However, he still insisted on writing an IOU to his cousin-uncle.

Wu Yijun saw the hesitation in his nephew's heart. This nephew had read some saintly books and was somewhat "blockheaded." But this was also good; although an upright gentleman might be pedantic in business sometimes, he could be trusted.

The next day, Chen Lin boarded a boat at the Li Family Wharf under his arrangement. The boat was a Tanka small boat that the Wu family hired year-round. The boatman had been to the Chen family before and didn't need special instructions; just telling him "Go to Master Chen's Nansha Village," the boatman knew.

The journey was just as Cousin-uncle said: the four countrysides were pacified. Villages along the way had all established Baojia according to the Australians' requirements, building watchtowers and checkpoints. Village braves patrolled and stood sentry day and night, more cautious than before. Thinking back, the government had made a big fanfare of doing these things to "prepare against the Short-hairs"; now these "Short-hairs" had taken it over grandly and used it themselves.

Silent all the way, they returned to Nansha Village in just three days. Place names called Nansha in the Pearl River Delta were countless. The Nansha Village where Chen Lin's home was located was exactly on a piece of sandy land deposited by river water.

In the early Ming Dynasty, the Chen family's ancestors migrated here from Shaoguan with the whole clan, settling down on this wasteland that was then still a river beach. Over more than two hundred years, they worked hard to cultivate and accumulate wealth, and expanded their power through children taking imperial examinations, gradually becoming the number one surname in Nansha Village.

He stepped onto the land he had been away from for a long time, gazing at the distant village houses and fields, and couldn't help feeling heavy-hearted. He had fled in a hurry; now more than a year had passed, and he didn't know how the clansmen and fellow villagers were. He only knew the village and family business had been damaged very severely.

He had only recently received the letter from home. The one who wrote the letter was an old man in his clan. He escaped the disaster when Nansha Village was sacked by chaotic soldiers and had found a chance to send him a letter with great difficulty.

From the letter, he formally learned of his father's death. On the night of the escape, he had seen with his own eyes his father hit by an arrow and falling from the bridge into the river. He hadn't held much hope originally, yet when he knew his father had truly died, Chen Lin was still overcome with grief—he lost his mother when young; it was his father who raised them siblings single-handedly.

The Chen family had a great business; just in this village, there were thirteen branch houses. With so many family branches, there were naturally rich and poor. Fortunately, the clan property accumulated over many years had become a considerable figure; even the poorest families could obtain a stable income and not suffer from cold and hunger.

Chen Lin's branch did not own many fields or fish ponds. But because there were extremely many silkworm raisers around, starting from his grandfather, they established a silk hong in the village, purchasing villagers' silkworm cocoons and raw silk to weave silk fabrics. Their products were also considered vaguely famous and could always act be sold to Guangzhou.

His family's workshop had begun to take shape with division of labor, having boiling rooms, reeling rooms, weaving rooms, and calendering rooms, and could also dye by themselves. These workrooms were managed separately by his father's cousins and nephews, while his father managed the coordination of all rooms' work.

Soldier chaos swept the whole village. Chaotic soldiers looted the stock clean and ruined much of the stocked raw silk. When running away, they even lit the houses; thanks to the villagers struggling to save the fire, most of the houses and equipment were saved. But his father died, and the craftsmen and laborers either died or scattered; this silk workshop couldn't continue opening.

The letter also urged him to come back as soon as possible to "reorganize the family business," and said that people's hearts in the clan were currently in disorder.

Who knew what kind of mess was waiting for him to clean up! Thinking of this, Chen Lin felt faintly discouraged.

"Ninth Uncle, we've arrived!" Returning to the village with him was Chen Qing. Although only two or three years younger than him, in terms of generation, he was Chen Lin's nephew. Collateral branches had distinctions, and Chen Qing's family was very poor, so he followed this Second Uncle since he was ten. Calling them uncle and nephew, they were actually master and servant.

The village was better than he imagined. Although many houses hadn't been rebuilt yet and broken walls were everywhere, there were quite a few temporary small houses built. It looked like many people had returned, and there were people busy in the fields outside the village.

Walking a short distance, he heard a woman's voice: "Brother Alin! Aqing! You're back!"

This familiar voice; he knew without looking it was Chen Yue, the daughter of Chen Lin's Second Uncle.

This Second Uncle, to speak honestly, Chen Lin looked down upon very much. Because this gentleman consistently ate, drank, whored, and gambled. If not for being a son of the Nansha Chen Clan with the clan to settle matters for him, he would probably have been beaten to death several times already. Second Aunt married him for more than ten years and really couldn't stand his absurdity; she brought out her maiden family brothers to grab Second Uncle and forced him to write a divorce letter. The two parties divorced. The Chen clan leader and elders only pretended to be deaf and dumb, unwilling to fight for Second Uncle.

Although the person was a rotten muddy person, he gave birth to a clever, beautiful, and intelligent daughter. The clan elders feared this rotten dad would do things like pawning the daughter to creditors or selling her, insulting the family style, so they adopted her to Chen Lin's father—legally speaking, Chen Yue was now his full sister.

What Chen Lin couldn't rest assured about most was this sister. He feared this sister was harmed in the chaos of war—the elder who wrote him only said vaguely that girls of every family had been insulted; some committed suicide, some were missing. Seeing Chen Yue's expression lively and bright at this moment, she should be safe and sound. His heart settled by more than half involuntarily.
Speaking of which, this was his only family member now.

Chen Yue told him that the home had been demolished by chaotic soldiers. Not burned by fire, but the chaotic soldiers heard this was the home of a silk workshop owner and decided there must be treasures buried in the home. After robbing valuables, they even pushed down walls and dug everywhere, even uncovering roof tiles, leaving the Chen Residence devastated.

"...I hid at Flower Sister-in-law's home to escape the calamity. Now I partner with her to live, doing some handwork together to exchange for rice, muddling through days half-hungry..."

Sister-in-law Guihua (Osmanthus/Flower) was surnamed Zheng; she was the wife of a loom worker in the Chen family silk workshop. After the loom worker died, she also did some odd jobs in the silk workshop to maintain a livelihood. As a person, she was considered dutiful and reliable. This reassured Chen Lin.
