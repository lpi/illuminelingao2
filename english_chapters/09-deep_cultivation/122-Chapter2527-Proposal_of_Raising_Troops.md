# Chapter 2527: Proposal of Raising Troops

"You've seen me. Speak."

"Many Ming officials and gentry bully others with their power, seizing commoners' fields during natural disasters, accepting property entrusted by others to evade taxes, or encroaching on sand flats to reclaim fields. The rich have connecting paths between fields while the poor have no place to stand an awl. The accumulated bad practices are hard to reverse. Chongzhen disregards the life and death of the common people. Although the Central Plains have suffered natural disasters for years, he still increases the Liaodong Supplies tax, causing refugees to rise everywhere. My Great Song knows the suffering of the people. Returning to the Divine Land, we will practice benevolent governance to reform the accumulated abuses of the previous dynasty. On the fifteenth of this month, a lecture on the New Policy for Land Tax and Land will be held in the auditorium of the Guangzhou National Demonstration School. Old Master, please be sure to attend so that you can educate the children of your clan to avoid violating the new laws."

"Preaching New Policy" again. Chen Zizhuang felt discouraged.

One of the Australians' favorite tricks to torture the gentry was to hold "lectures" and "meetings" every few days. Moreover, they named the head of the household to attend. If the head of the household was unwilling to come, at least the eldest son or grandson had to show up; they absolutely couldn't send a nephew or concubine-born son to deal with it. regardless of whether you wanted to listen or not, you had to be there. One lecture would take half a day or a whole day. The gentry masters were tortured until they complained incessantly. If they didn't arrive, they would be fined tens to hundreds of yuan. This was still somewhat painful for the gentry whose income had dropped significantly.

People were the knife and chopping board, and I was the fish and meat. Even if reluctant, he could only bow his head.

"What new policy does the Great Song have this time?"

"The detailed rules have not yet been announced. Generally, it concerns land tax, land consolidation, and new laws."

"May I ask Mr. Lv, how are the laws of the Great Song different?" Chen Zizhuang asked.

Chen Zizhuang's question stumped Lv Yizhong for a moment. There were too many differences between the two systems; one or two sentences couldn't finish explaining them. He thought for a moment and said, "In short, everyone is equal."

Chen Zizhuang suppressed his emotions and replied, "Good, I know. I will definitely attend the meeting. Mr. Lv, please return!"

Lv Yizhong took out two notification letters, left one, and took the other away after asking Chen Zizhuang to sign it. Only then did Li Suiqiu and the others reveal themselves.

Chen Zizhuang repeated the notification letter and the matter Lv Yizhong notified. Li Suiqiu also mentioned the Tax Bureau ordering him to report his income some time ago, jokingly calling the Senate "Ten Thousand Taxes" [Wan Shui - homophone for Long Live/Ten Thousand Years]. They all understood this was the Australians' means of suppressing the gentry.

Although the Australians didn't recognize Ming dynasty titles after entering the city—so whether exempting corvee labor and tax privileges for *xiucai*, *juren*, or *jinshi*, all were canceled, meaning no one came to entrust property to them anymore—without this gray income, working was impossible. They couldn't work a job in this life; they could only rely on collecting rent from land to maintain their livelihood. But the "New Land Policy" recently promoted by the Australians made them restless.

The Australians' new land policy had already been gradually launched in the "security zones" around Guangzhou. This was almost a dimensionality reduction strike against the gentry.

Measuring land prevented them from hiding land assets; once the progressive land tax was collected, families with large tracts of land either had to divide the family or sell the land. With ordinary people having land, it was harder for the gentry to rent out land, so they could only lower the rent. There were also fewer poor people willing to sell themselves as slaves; the slave tax also made it impossible for them to keep a large number of slaves to tyrannize others. In this way, the economic foundation of the gentry landlords would disintegrate. If another set of laws where everyone was equal came along, wouldn't it be that a superior committing a crime would be punished the same as a junior? The younger generation in the family would no longer fear the authority of the elders.

Li Suiqiu read the Australians' newspapers frequently. Almost every issue had news about corruption in Ming officialdom or officials forcing people to rebel. Although this set of new policies by the Australians severely damaged his interests, he had to admit that the wealth of the world today was mostly gathered in the hands of the gentry. The Australians gathered wealth methodically; they could fill the national treasury without causing common people to rebel. His Fu Society good friend Huang Zongxi had also criticized the "laws" since the Three Dynasties as "laws of one family" of emperors, which were "unlawful laws," advocating replacing "laws of one family" with "laws of the world."

A thought inadvertently popped into Li Suiqiu's mind: *If the current Emperor also used this method...* But he immediately realized the absurdity. Doing so would cut off the root of the imperial court. Not practicing this method was waiting for death; practicing this method was speeding up death! Either way was death! How ironic!

"It really is taking away the firewood from under the cauldron. The Kun thieves are digging up the roots of the scholars!" Chen Bangyan shook his head and sighed, stepping forward to say to Chen Zizhuang, "Master Qiutao, this is truly the way of 'using barbarians to change the Chinese.' The Kun thieves are forcing us very urgently. Within three years, there will be no more words of sages in Lingnan, and the millennium-old foundation will be destroyed in a day."

Chen Zizhuang's heart was also surging. Rebel, and defeat is certain! Don't rebel, and sit in a besieged city of sorrow! But he was an old hand after all, so he shook his head at Chen Bangyan. "Mr. Yanye's heart of loyalty to the sovereign can be seen by the sun and moon. But today, the time, place, and people are not on our side. Uprising is just increasing meaningless sacrifice."

Chen Bangyan said, "Success or failure is Heaven! Matching the enemy or not is Momentum!"

Chen Zizhuang asked, "Things have come to this; there is only one fight!"

Everyone was very clear about the current situation. The Kun thieves had gradually tightened the noose on them. In another three to five years, the "gentry" who originally called the wind and summoned the rain would at best be reduced to ordinary rich men. If they showed the slightest disobedience, destroying the family would be a matter of an instant!

"If we want to start an uprising, we must have a strategy." Kuang Lu had always been fond of military affairs and immediately responded.

"Raising troops is a situation of certain death. Do you gentlemen have this determination?" Chen Zisheng sneered.

Chen Bangyan said, "Raising troops at this moment is naturally a situation of certain death. Right now, we can only lie low and wait for changes. The Court lost two provinces; over time, it will inevitably take action. We can only accumulate strength and wait for the opportunity to respond."

"I'm afraid that before the court discussion is decided, we will have already been reduced to commoners!" Li Suiqiu smiled bitterly. "What will we use to respond then?"

"Not so. After the Kun thieves burned the Wuyang Courier Station, I wrote to the County Magistrate proposing to set up Longshan Fort village militia to defend the hometown. Like the Loyalty Battalion, some Longshan Fort village militia were also reorganized by the Kun thieves. Among them are my students, all loyal and righteous men. Not a few Lingnan gentry have been encroached upon by the Kun thieves. They only fear the Kun thieves' military force; in reality, their hearts are with the Great Ming and can be cited as support. Even if we don't raise righteous troops now, we should make broad contacts. Once the loyal and righteous men are familiar with the Australian methods of war and the time is ripe, we will definitely overthrow this group of overseas barbarians!"

Chen Zizhuang immediately responded, "Since the Kun thieves want to force us to sell land property through taxation, we might as well borrow the slope to get off the donkey. Sell what should be sold, and the silver obtained will serve as pay for anti-Kun soldiers."

"We sit in a besieged city of sorrow, not knowing when the Emperor's heavenly troops will descend..." Kuang Lu sighed. He had returned from the capital not long ago and knew the current chaotic situation of the court too well. "If there are no big shots in the court pushing strongly, I'm afraid this matter will be hard to achieve without three to five years."

"Naturally, there are big shots in the court, but we can't only count on the court." Chen Bangyan said, "Someone will come from the capital soon. Since you gentlemen are kindred spirits and pillars of my Southern Yue, I will naturally introduce you then..."

In Guangzhou City, in the conference room of the Political Security Bureau, another "Intelligence Exchange Meeting" was held.

Since the Triad Grand Alliance incident occurred in Caohe, the Political Security Bureau internally had basically determined that within the scope of the old Guangzhou Prefecture, a large-scale riot was extremely likely to occur in the short term. Therefore, relevant work also accelerated. And today's meeting involved a key issue: "Gentry."

After the Senate went north to Guangzhou, they fought wars, suppressed bandits, dealt with the plague, and handled witchcraft cases, while also engaging in a battle of wits and courage with the gentry in the city. Everyone handled ten thousand machines a day. Those characters who didn't jump around much on ordinary days naturally received little attention from the Senators. However, every dynasty produces famous figures known for their integrity. The Three Loyalists of Lingnan were representatives of this type of person. Although the Three Loyalists of Lingnan hadn't torn their faces with the Senate yet, dust wouldn't run away by itself without sweeping. From various signs, these few were more or less active in secret.

Although time and space had changed, a person's temperament and the social education they received hadn't changed, which also meant their choices in the face of the historical tide wouldn't change. Although some Senators thought they could be influenced and pacified, Wu Mu believed that if they were people who could be pacified or bought, they wouldn't have raised the banner of opposing the Qing in the old timeline. Besides, the Great Qing's attitude towards the gentry was much softer than the Senate's.

Lin Baiguang flipped through the materials in his hand. "So, the 'Two Loyalists' among the Three Loyalists of Lingnan have met? What about Zhang Jiayu?"

Mu Min said, "The Three Loyalists of Lingnan were titled by later generations; it doesn't mean these three people have intersections now. This should also be Chen Bangyan's first meeting with Chen Zizhuang. Zhang Jiayu is just twenty-two years old in nominal age this year, a full cycle younger than Chen Bangyan, Li Suiqiu, and Kuang Lu, and twenty years younger than Chen Zizhuang. Moreover, Zhang Jiayu's grandfather and father were both of the commoner class, and his home is in Dongguan. He is not in the same circle as the wealthy and powerful families of Guangzhou like Li, Chen, and Kuang. Originally, he should have become a *juren* this year, but now that we're here, his resume can only freeze at the level of *xiucai*. Which is to say, he is unlikely to enter this circle of wealthy and powerful families. His future development will have great variables."

Wu Mu said, "I heard Du Yibin saw Zhang Jiayu on the flower boat of the collective wedding. Later, Fatty Cui made an appointment with Brother Zhang to talk in person at the Temple of the Five Immortals, instilling a lot of new ideas. Brother Zhang is young, has a strong ability to accept new things, and has strong personal ability. It is said he has already joined the Shen'ao Learning Society established by Du Yibin. Many intellectuals who want to join us have applied to enter. After all, we still lack intellectuals, especially intellectuals like Zhang Jiayu who are willing to accept new ideas and new things. Instead of letting him follow Chen Zizhuang and the others to cause trouble, it's better to use him for ourselves, which also plays a role in division."

"Didn't Li Suiqiu also go to the Temple of the Five Immortals? It seems Fatty Cui's charm isn't enough; he couldn't bend Li over," Liu Xiang said.

Lin Baiguang put down the materials in his hands and said, "He's already in his thirties. You can't look at it with 21st-century eyes. Don't you know that historically, when Chen Bangyan wrote to the thirty-three-year-old Zhang Jiayu, he addressed him as 'Old Master'?"
