# Chapter 2713: The Capital (Part 69)

Things were unsettled in the capital these days. Third Master Qin's influence extended only within the outer city; once you passed through Chongwen Gate, it was no longer his territory. But he too had heard the news of Delong's manager being kidnapped. When he heard it, he was shocked because this Manager Leng was a major figure even in the capital, with connections to many officials and palace eunuchs. The everyday urban foxes and social rats wouldn't dare provoke him. Even great bandits and robbers from out of town, once they inquired about his background with local colleagues, would mostly retreat in the face of difficulty. Besides, Delong also kept the Heliansheng Escort Bureau for household security—and those escort masters were truly more cunning than ghosts and fiercer than wolves. He hadn't expected anyone would actually dare to touch the tiger's whiskers.

Now the Escort Bureau had spent a great deal of money, hiring countless informants in the capital to search for Manager Leng. Third Master Qin had also spread the word: fifty taels of silver reward for any useful information. This had driven the various urban foxes and social rats into a frenzy for a time.

However, the frenzy didn't last long. Before long, a few particularly enthusiastic ruffians who had been sniffing around for information mysteriously died—and everyone understood: the gang that had "invited the God of Wealth" was equally not to be trifled with.

Third Master Qin's nose was one of the sharpest in the outer city. He had long smelled that something deeper was going on here. To the liaison sent by Heliansheng, he made all the promises and pounded his chest; to his subordinates, he warned them: When gods fight, don't meddle!

He picked up his teacup and sipped slowly, savoring for a moment. His stomach was a bit hungry; he was about to call the waiter for breakfast when Boss Qian tiptoed over and whispered by his ear, "Third Master!"

"Hmm?"

"Liu Xiaobian is back."

"So he knows to come back!" Third Master Qin snorted. He was over fifty and could be said to have everything going his way. The only thorn in his side was this Liu Xiaobian.

Liu Xiaobian was his brother-in-law, a ruffian from the capital since childhood. Third Master Qin didn't look down on his origins; after all, he himself wasn't exactly a "law-abiding citizen," and his relationship with his father-in-law's family was more like two servants becoming sworn brothers. But when he prospered, he arranged jobs for anyone even remotely related—maybe not great wealth, but at least a worry-free living.

The exception was this Liu Xiaobian. After all these years following him, the man had accomplished nothing. He was skilled at drinking, gambling, and whoring, but everything he did went to ruin. And Liu Xiaobian happened to be his wife's youngest brother—the most cherished of all. Not only did he freeload at his sister and brother-in-law's place all year long, but every time he got into trouble, Third Master Qin had to hold his nose and clean up the mess.

After last Mid-Autumn Festival, he had finally secured a position for his brother-in-law in Nanyuan, which had kept him quiet for a few months. To keep an eye on him, he had ordered him to check in at Juchun Garden every day before going on duty. He hadn't expected that right after the New Year, the man would stop showing up.

"Which cheap brothel did he crawl out of this time?" Third Master Qin snorted. "Now I'll have to go find Eunuch Cao to smooth things over and lose a few more coins..."

Boss Qian said, "Third Master, you'd better go see for yourself... He's in the back courtyard..."

Third Master Qin immediately sensed something wrong in Boss Qian's tone. He asked in a low voice, "What happened?"

Boss Qian hesitated. "You'll understand when you see him..."

From his hemming and hawing, something serious must have happened to Liu Xiaobian. Third Master Qin's heart skipped a beat. He stood up. "Where is he? I'll go now!"

What Third Master Qin saw was Liu Xiaobian lying on the brick ground of the back courtyard, covered with a rush mat.

Although he had a premonition, when he actually saw his brother-in-law's corpse, Third Master Qin's eyes went wide, blood rushing to his head. For an instant, he felt dizzy, and his body swayed violently. Boss Qian quickly steadied him.

Third Master Qin wasn't grieving. This brother-in-law had caused him no end of trouble; he wouldn't shed a tear over his death. But ever since he had raised his banner in this outer city, he had never lost face this badly. His brother-in-law might have been "worthless," but he was still under his protection. Who was bold enough to kill him without a word?

He calmed himself and said in a low voice, "Lift the mat!"

The mat was lifted. The corpse beneath was covered in blood, a ghastly sight. But the main wounds were clearly visible: a stab wound under the ribs, and another slash across the throat. He was an old hand in the *Jianghu*; one glance told him the throat slash was a finishing blow dealt after death. The killers had not only murdered Liu Xiaobian but wanted to make sure he was dead.

Who had such deep hatred for Liu Xiaobian? Third Master Qin couldn't figure it out. He knew his brother-in-law best: his greatest talents were drinking, gambling, and whoring. He sometimes went out with others to extort money or cheat at gambling, but he was as weak as a chicken, not a fighter; he never got into violent conflicts. As for money, he never had any overnight savings...

"Who sent him back?" he asked.

"Master Zou from Haidian had someone deliver him."

"Is the person still here?"

"Yes."

"Bring him over."

The messenger was sharp. He was about to bow when Third Master Qin waved his hand and asked, "Where did you find him?"

"Replying to Third Master, yesterday Master Zou had us clean up the roadside corpses on the official road and transport them to the public burial ground. Unexpectedly, on a side road not far from Liulin North Village, we saw a lot of blood and several bodies. We followed the blood trail into the woods and found the ground littered with corpses—over twenty of them, along with various weapons. It looked like two groups had fought. While burying the bodies, someone recognized him as your brother-in-law..."

Haidian? Third Master Qin was puzzled. Liu Xiaobian was born and raised in the South City; his activities were mostly in the South City. He rarely even entered the capital proper. How had he rushed off to Haidian in the northwest corner and gotten killed on the main road? What kind of situation was this?

He knew his brother-in-law too well. Though bold and reckless, he had limits. In this South City, with his brother-in-law covering for him, he naturally dared to do as he pleased. But to go somewhere else and do something that risked his neck? He wouldn't get involved even if you broke his legs.

"What kind of people were the dead?"

"Just people doing no-capital trade on the official road. A few were wearing military uniforms—probably deserters." Seeing that Third Master Qin had no more questions, the messenger untied a bundle from his body and handed it over.

"These are the items found on Master Liu's body; they're all inside. Master Zou ordered them brought back together. Please inspect them, Third Master."

The waiter beside him quickly took the bundle. Third Master Qin didn't open it but nodded. "Go back and thank Master Zou for me. Tell him I owe him a favor." He then ordered, "Give this brother ten taels of silver. Go back and invite the brothers to drink a bowl of wine to dispel the filth."

After sending the messenger away, Third Master Qin ordered someone to buy a thin-skinned coffin and summon a monk to wash the body, dress it, and prepare it for burial. He himself returned to the room in the back courtyard and opened the bundle. Inside were only a string of copper coins, a set of bone dice, a key, and a memo booklet.

The key and the booklet were things he used for his duties in Nanyuan—nothing special. He studied them for a long time but couldn't make sense of it.

"How strange!"

Little Qian sat in the mule cart, letting it carry him along. He heard only the rumble of the cart. He couldn't tell north from south, east from west, nor how far the road was—just twisting and turning, bending east and winding west.

After about the time it takes to eat two meals, the cart gradually slowed. When it stopped and the curtain was lifted, he saw the cart had stopped in a courtyard. Judging by the scale of the yard and the "Daoist robe heart" style of the walls, it should be the residence of some middle-class household.

In the courtyard were two flower beds—one planted with lilacs, the other with a camellia.

This all matched what had been agreed upon beforehand. Little Qian was cautious. He got out of the cart and stood quietly, though his hands were secretly on guard.

The cart driver climbed the steps and knocked lightly on the door several times. The lattice door opened slightly, revealing a face.

"Arrived?"

"Arrived."

Out came a short, capable young man who bowed to Little Qian. "Are you Fifth Master from Jiangnan?"

"Correct." Little Qian answered.

"Please come in."

The room was dimly lit, with very simple furnishings and crude furniture, matching the courtyard. Little Qian waited a moment. Then a person emerged from a side room. "Please sit, please have tea!"

Though the light was dim, Little Qian could see it was a middle-aged man dressed as a merchant. He knew this was the contact from Heliansheng. He thanked him for the seat, and someone brought tea.

"Please have tea," the man said again, then introduced himself. "My humble name is Wu Kaidi."

Before setting out, Little Qian had reviewed all the personnel files of the Capital Station. He knew this man was Leng Ningyun's personal attendant—the "standing Manager Leng," so to speak. He replied, "Pleased to meet you. My surname is Qian."

"You've come so fast!" Wu Kaidi said with some surprise. "But that's good! At least my heart is at ease!"

"How is the situation in the capital?"

"It's hard to explain in a few words." Wu Kaidi sighed. "We put all our strength into a punch, but it was like hitting cotton!"

They had spent a lot of money and used many people. Almost all the connections the Capital Station could mobilize had been mobilized. They had searched everywhere, inside and out. There were plenty of leads, but once verified, none were useful.

"...Originally, we prided ourselves on being sharp-eyed and sharp-eared in the capital. Especially for this kind of thing—through Heliansheng, we could find out anything. Now even they are fumbling in the dark. Information is everywhere, but none of it is real."

After saying this, Wu Kaidi recounted everything from Leng Ningyun's kidnapping up to the recent interception of Lady Sanniang's convoy on the way to Haidian.

"...One strange thing after another, yet we don't even know what the other side wants! They agreed to accept the silver but won't let us redeem the person!"

Little Qian didn't comment. First, how to handle things was Group Leader Min's business; it wasn't his place to judge. Second, Wu Kaidi wasn't involved in the specific handling; there were things he didn't need to know.

After Wu Kaidi finished, he fetched a box of documents from the side room. It contained a daily log of major events since Leng Ningyun's kidnapping, records of related actions taken, and various intelligence gathered.

Little Qian skimmed through the table of contents and asked, "If we need to contact you, how do we notify you?"
