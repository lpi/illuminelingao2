# Chapter 2728: The Capital (Part 80)

The letter prominently featured four characters: "Mushi Daoren" (The Stone-Wood Daoist).

This name had become famous in the Senate's intelligence system in recent years. Especially after the Witchcraft Case, the name "Mushi Daoren" had appeared again and again, and many major cases vaguely pointed to this person. The Political Security Bureau highly suspected this person was "Stone Elder" or his agent.

But to this day, not a single clue about Stone Elder had been found. The organization remained shrouded in fog.

Now, letters mentioning this person had been found among Liu Sha's correspondence! This was tantamount to announcing that Liu Sha had direct contact with the Stone-Wood Daoist, and Wang Yehao was very likely the mastermind behind this organization.

The letter in his hands alone was a major achievement!

This letter was from "Mushi Daoren," warning Liu Sha that the Short-Hairs were turning the capital upside down to find the person. The reward for finding him had been raised to one thousand taels, and even providing information was worth one hundred taels. Under these circumstances, even with the lord's influence, some might take the risk. Especially now that anyone could buy a ticket to Short-Hair territory. So special attention needed to be paid to internal control, to prevent the guards from succumbing to temptation and betraying them.

"Since that's the case, old fellow, you leave me no choice." Min Zhanlian thought. He had to pry this man's mouth completely open.

He immediately ordered his subordinates to "keep a close eye on Liu Sha and prevent him from committing suicide."

Zhou Ruolan asked, "Do we withdraw now or stay?"

"Stay here. Just send back the important information. You go rest; tonight we'll thoroughly interrogate this old fellow. Nine out of ten chances, he knows where Senator Leng is!"

"Go to Nanyuan?!" Wu Cheng was somewhat puzzled. "What's there to do in that godforsaken place?"

"I naturally have my reasons for going. I'll give you one hundred taels of silver. Will you go or not?"

Wu Cheng gulped hard. One hundred taels! In three years in the capital, he couldn't earn one hundred taels!

But he had been in the capital long enough. Though he wasn't a *Jianghu* person, as a Daoist, he had quite a bit of contact with *Jianghu* people. He had heard something about Leng Ningyun being kidnapped and Heliansheng offering a reward for finding him.

With his years of experience, he naturally knew there was much more to this. Better not to get involved.

"Well..." he said, pretending indifference. "What's so interesting about that wretched place? Inside, it's all wild meadows, stinking ponds, dense wild forests, and plenty of wild beasts. That's bad enough, but now they've also settled several thousand castrated men inside. Each one is lawless—it's like a demon dance in there."

"Just say whether you'll go or not." Li Rufeng smiled. The smile carried an unmistakable hint of threat.

"I... I... well..." Wu Cheng was somewhat flustered. He steeled himself and said, "It's not that I refuse to go. It's just that inside is a royal garden. All four gates are guarded by imperial troops. If I bring one or two people, with this face of mine it might pass. But more people—I'm afraid it won't work. Please understand, Chief Escort Li."

"Old Wu, do you think I'm a greenhorn? I certainly don't know the situation inside Nanyuan as well as you. But speaking of getting in and out—the beggars and robbers on the streets aren't all coming out through the Great Red Gate, are they?"

During the Ming Dynasty, Nanyuan had four garden gates: the Great Red Gate to the north was the main entrance. To the south was the South Red Gate, to the east the East Red Gate, and to the west the West Red Gate. Each gate was guarded by capital garrison troops. But because Nanyuan had been neglected for so long, the guards were hardly present. The 120-*li* earthen wall around the perimeter had many collapses from lack of repair. There were over a dozen gaps of various sizes, all passable.

Wu Cheng kept smiling apologetically and made excuses about having business and needing to leave the capital for half a month. Li Rufeng wouldn't let him slip away. He drew his knife and flourished it a bit. Now Wu Cheng could only agree to lead them into the garden to search.

"Let me be frank: although this garden is neglected, it's still a royal place. Whatever you gentlemen do inside, you must be careful..."

"Look how scared you are!" Li Rufeng laughed and patted his back. "We're not highway bandits. We do the honest business of escorting and guarding. We're only going to Nanyuan out of necessity. If you help us succeed, you'll be well rewarded!"

Wu Cheng smiled bitterly. "Yes, yes. I understand!"

"Since you've agreed to guide us, let me fill you in..." Li Rufeng had just started when Wu Cheng interrupted him.

"Chief Escort, please don't fill me in on anything. Just tell me what you want to know, where you want to go, and what you're looking for. I don't want to hear a single extra word."

Li Rufeng laughed. "Well, you're an old hand too!"

"The waters of the Yongding River run too deep, and there are too many immortals," Wu Cheng said. "Even though the rice in the capital is hard to swallow, I still want to eat it for a few more years."

"First, tell me about the situation inside Nanyuan."

Even Heliansheng knew little about Nanyuan. The reason was simple: not only was it a royal garden, but it was simply too large. Few ordinary people bothered with it, and even criminals rarely visited.

"This place was formerly called 'Fangfei Bo' (Release-Hawk Marsh). It was where the Yuan emperors released their hunting eagles. Inside, there's still a stone platform called the Eagle-Airing Platform, supposedly for drying the feathers of gyrfalcons. It wasn't until our dynasty that it was renamed 'Nanhaizi' (Southern Lake Enclosure)..."

The name "Nanhaizi" came from the five "haizi" (lakes) there. Since there was also a "Northern Lake" in the imperial city, this royal garden was named "Southern Lake."

Nanyuan had four gates: the North Red Gate, South Red Gate, East Red Gate, and West Red Gate. Afterward, palaces, traveling lodges, and offices were gradually built inside, managed by dispatched eunuchs and officials. There was a Superintendent's Office for the Upper Forest Park.

"This Superintendent's Office is near the Great Red Gate in the north. The current steward is Eunuch Cao."

The Superintendent's Office for the Upper Forest Park wasn't one of the Twenty-Four Offices. It was a cold, idle office in the palace, basically excluded from the court power circles. But because Nanyuan had "sea households," official farmland, and various income from hunting, timber, and fishing, it was still quite attractive to senior eunuchs who couldn't get ahead. Thus, obtaining this position required pulling strings and flattering superiors.

"This Eunuch Cao reportedly curried favor with the Seal-Holding Eunuch of the Bell and Drum Office and got this position through his connections."

So Eunuch Cao had this connection to Eunuch Yang! Li Rufeng nodded slightly.

"How many eunuchs are inside now?"

"The official count is around a hundred, but actually only twenty or thirty come on duty each day. More come during the summer and autumn when collecting official rents. Eunuch Cao himself rarely comes to the office—he just sends a little eunuch to pick up and deliver documents each day. He only comes for urgent official business."

Besides these hundred-odd eunuchs, there were three or four hundred "auxiliary workers" hired from the capital's idlers. Originally, there weren't many such workers, but because Nanyuan housed castrated men, many more were hired under the name of "looking after" them. About a hundred were on duty daily.

"How many garrison troops are on duty?"

Wu Cheng looked at him with some alarm but didn't dare not answer.

"Eighty at each gate. Soldiers from the 'Upper Twelve Guards' take turns on duty."

At this point, Wu Cheng couldn't help asking, "Chief Escort Li, what exactly are you planning to do?"

Li Rufeng smiled. "I'm doing something important. Don't worry. It won't involve the authorities!"

"Though Nanyuan is neglected, it's still a royal garden. Please be careful in your actions..." Wu Cheng offered more advice before continuing.

Whether eunuchs, auxiliary workers, or guards, most gathered at the gatehouses and offices at the four gates. Few people went elsewhere. Because Nanyuan now housed many castrated men who couldn't enter the palace. They roamed Nanyuan in gangs, hunting wild animals, occasionally slipping out through the gaps to beg aggressively, steal, or even rob in the capital and nearby counties and villages. The managing eunuchs were supposed to "strictly supervise" them, but in reality, they did nothing—only embezzling and pocketing relief money and grain.

"Where do these several thousand castrated men live? They can't sleep outdoors every night, can they?"

"They live in the sea households' houses."

When Emperor Chengzu (Yongle) established Nanyuan, he specifically relocated households from several northern provinces to guard and clean the garden. These were called "haihu" (sea households), totaling 1,600 households, each allocated 24 *mu* of land. These 1,600 sea households lived in various "sea household villages" within Nanyuan. The two largest were near the North Red Gate and East Red Gate. Besides those, there were seven or eight smaller village settlements scattered inside.

There were supposedly 1,600 sea households, but because official exploitation was extremely heavy, many had fled or died out over the years. Now, barely one-tenth of the residents remained in each village. The official farmland lay fallow, making the interior very desolate. Many villages were abandoned, and the castrated men had moved in like magpies taking over nests. Though many village houses had collapsed, leaving only broken walls, it was still better than sleeping in the wilderness. Some gangs, relying on their strength, even seized some of the empty official buildings inside the garden.

"These castrated men are very hard to deal with!" Wu Cheng warned. "Everyone says the barefoot don't fear those with shoes. They've lost even their... *that*. They're utterly reckless. Fights and killings happen there every day. When someone dies, they don't even bother to bury them—just toss them in the forest or meadow. Within ten days or so, wild boars and wolves have eaten them. The garrison and eunuchs inside don't dare get involved!"

After hearing his introduction, Li Rufeng thought for a moment and asked, "Do you know the locations of all these villages?"

"I know the big ones. As for the villages deep inside, to be honest, I've never been there..." Wu Cheng's eyes flickered.

"Ten taels of silver for each one you take us to."

"...There are roads between the villages. Following the roads, we should be able to get there." Wu Cheng swallowed. "But Chief Escort, you'll need to assign me two escort masters specifically, and we'll need a mule..."

Li Rufeng threw his head back and laughed. "Done! Don't worry."

Having come this far, he felt he could speak more plainly. He asked very seriously, "Daoist! If you had to hide someone, where in Nanyuan would you hide them?"
