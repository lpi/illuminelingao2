# Chapter 2583 - Investigation (Part 10)

"You're right—this counterfeit is indeed different!" Lu Cheng said.

As a member of Guangzhou's Political Security Bureau, Lu Cheng had also dealt with counterfeit currency cases, handling no fewer than several dozen over time. Though the current trend was for enemies to use clipped silver for counterfeits, and the authenticity of fake silver dollars was rising sharply—already achieving six or seven-tenths similarity—paper currency counterfeits remained hopelessly inferior. So fake they were essentially unusable.

But this counterfeit note was unusually authentic. The paper, base color, texture, font, even the watermark... every special feature they could think of for Australian paper currency was present on this counterfeit.

The only thing confirming it was a counterfeit was its denomination: ten yuan. The Senate's Central Reserve Bank had never issued paper currency with a denomination higher than one yuan.

Lu Cheng examined it back and forth several times, her expression darkening. She said: "I know where this currency comes from."

"How so?"

"This was altered from the 1633 edition ten-jin grain circulation coupon." Lu Cheng said. "How clever! Credit to them for thinking of it!"

"Grain circulation coupon?" Yuan Shuzhi looked blank.

"Yes, it only circulated in Hainan before."

Though the grain circulation coupon was once the Senate's legal currency before monetary reform, it had actually only circulated within the Senate's actual controlled areas. It was extremely rare in the Two Guangs. Except for some merchants who frequently traveled between Guangdong and Hainan, most people—including current local naturalized citizen cadres—had never seen one. This gave counterfeit currency criminals their opportunity.

"So that's it—real currency altered into counterfeit!"

"The enemy is indeed cunning. Seeing they couldn't break through on printing technology, they came up with this trick!" Lu Cheng wasn't a finance cadre and didn't understand the specific issuance and circulation of grain circulation coupons. But undoubtedly, the enemy had somehow obtained a portion of the now-abolished grain circulation coupons and altered them to look like silver dollar exchange certificates.

Yuan Shuzhi had originally come to Huizhou only to investigate fake medicines. Now a new development with counterfeit currency had emerged en route. Lu Cheng couldn't ignore it and decided to first write a related report to Guangzhou.

"Comrade Old Yuan, what are your next steps? Where will you stay?"

"I'll rest here in the city for a few days and feel out the local situation. Then I'll head to Boluo county seat." Yuan Shuzhi said. "I plan to work as an itinerant bookkeeper. More freedom that way."

---

The Luofu Mountain medicine market was still a hundred li from Huizhou. Even from Boluo county, it was sixty or seventy li. The investigation team couldn't find much in the prefectural city.

Itinerant bookkeeper was a profession that had recently emerged. Because the Tax Bureau was implementing a new tax system to standardize industrial and commercial taxation, small and medium shops that had previously just kept simple running accounts found they couldn't cope with the new tax and financial systems—quite at a loss. So this profession arose to meet the demand.

At first, it was just some shop accountants who'd attended Tax Bureau training classes on the new tax and financial systems coming out to moonlight. As business volume grew, many who weren't accountants but had some literacy and abacus skills also started signing up for this training. After finishing, they'd do "bookkeeping and tax filing" for shops—becoming a whole new profession.

Yuan Shuzhi had this certification, so he'd planned to use this as his cover. The advantage was freedom of movement—using the pretext of soliciting business to enter and exit shops wouldn't attract attention.

"Isn't the medicine market business thriving? Presumably they have lots of transactions and urgently need talent like me." Yuan Shuzhi stroked his beard. "With luck, they might even invite me to join them, heh heh."

"If something like that really happens, you must discuss it with us first." Lu Cheng reminded. "Since they dare to traffic the Senate's medicines, they must be desperate outlaws."

"Naturally. I still want to live a few more years. Risks I shouldn't take—I absolutely won't take." Yuan Shuzhi nodded. "I'll linger in the city for a few days. Once I'm familiar with the routes, it won't be too late to visit the medicine market."

"Alright then. We'll set out for Boluo county a few days ahead. How will we contact each other then?"

"Are you going openly or secretly?"

"Our official cover is a Cheka flying inspection team, so we'll definitely go to Boluo openly."

"Then you'll certainly stay at the Qiwei inn. When the time comes, I'll naturally send you a letter."

The Cheka flying inspection team established mailboxes wherever they stayed to receive various tip-off letters. Using this method to communicate was very convenient.

A gentle breeze brought pleasant weather, with clear skies.

A cargo ship from Lingao puffed smoke and spray, cutting through waves all the way to the dock outside Guangzhou's New World.

According to the shipping schedule, Guo Huiwen arrived at the dock early, waiting for this shipment of "special use" medicines. The escort was Wang Liang, a technician from the General Pharmaceutical Factory.

Zheng Mingjiang had specifically requested him mainly to identify the components of the various confiscated miscellaneous drugs. Currently, the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital pharmacy didn't have this capability.

The ship steadied and lowered the gangplank. Passengers gradually disembarked. This ship was transporting sensitive materials, so it didn't sell tickets to the public—all passengers were naturalized citizen workers.

Guo Huiwen's gaze searched the gangplank. Before long, he spotted Wang Liang's figure and immediately waved his arm.

"Technician Wang!"

"Little Guo!"

After exchanging pleasantries, Guo Huiwen briefly explained the background. Elder Zheng Mingjiang had gone on a business trip to Huizhou. He was there on her behalf to receive this shipment of "special use medicines."

Of course, Elder Zheng hadn't actually gone to Huizhou—this was just her smokescreen. To make the smokescreen more convincing, she'd run off to Sanshui county a few days ago to further spread confusion.

"You received Elder Zheng's telegram, right?"

"Rest assured. Since the medicines were requested by Elder Zheng, I'll definitely deliver them personally into her hands." Wang Liang said.

"Good, good. But when Chiefs like Lin at Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital make requests, how do you deliver?"

"That's more complicated." Wang Liang said. "It depends on which channel, what specific purpose, and what justification the request is made under."

"For normal hospital medicines?"

"There are two channels. One is commercial use—all through the Pharmaceutical Company's channels. The Pharmaceutical Company orders from us. We ship according to the addresses on the shipping manifests they provide."

"So the Pharmaceutical Company doesn't stock inventory itself?"

"The Pharmaceutical Company does keep some inventory. But for large-scale purchases, mostly our factory ships directly according to the shipping manifest. Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital is one of those."

"Are there cases where you ship directly, not through the Pharmaceutical Company?"

"Of course. Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital ships via 'allocation slips' stamped by the Planning Commission. Wherever the address on the allocation slip points, that's where we ship."

"What about special use like today?"

"Special use requires Executive Office documentation. Like this batch requested by Elder Lin—we can only ship after the Executive Office stamps it. Of course, whoever the goods belong to, we deliver to them."

"Doesn't it need to go through Joint Logistics channels?" Guo Huiwen pressed.

"Joint Logistics?" Wang Liang was a bit confused. "Of course Joint Logistics orders go through Joint Logistics channels. But sometimes they also use freight company channels, depending on cargo space availability."

Guo Huiwen interrupted: "Not Joint Logistics medicines—for example, this special use shipment or Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital medicines—would they go through Joint Logistics channels?"

"Why would non-Joint Logistics goods use Joint Logistics channels?" Wang Liang was puzzled. "Normal shipments go through freight companies—maybe the freight company rents cargo space on Joint Logistics transport ships."

Guo Huiwen thought this didn't add up at all! He had to keep asking: "Never at all?"

"There are cases. For example, urgent 'special use' items do go through Joint Logistics. Also medicines destined for remote areas. Non-pacified zones that regular transport companies generally won't serve can only go through Joint Logistics channels. But these aren't large quantities."

The two chatted while walking, heading straight to the Great World guesthouse. The ship's cargo unloading and distribution would take a day or two, so this medicine shipment couldn't be picked up until 48 hours after arrival.

Arriving at Great World, Guo Huiwen again inquired in detail about the factory's medicine shipping procedures and related processes. Though Wang Liang was a technician, he was thoroughly familiar with the factory's operations. He explained in full detail how the factory sold goods, how shipments were transported, and what specific procedures were followed.

Guo Huiwen recorded this entire process in detail. He wasn't a Cheka agent and hadn't studied finance, but from the process Wang Liang described, drug leakage could occur at any channel. As long as procedures weren't strictly followed.

"Wang Liang, tell me—if someone wanted to obtain drugs from the factory, could they?"

Wang Liang was startled and asked back: "You mean..."

"I'm just asking casually. You probably know Elder Zheng is currently investigating drug leakage. She now wants to find out which channel it's leaking from. Distribution channels are a mess of loose ends—hard to sort out quickly. Let's start by looking at the source."

Wang Liang thought for a long while with his head down, then said: "If you're asking whether nothing ever leaks, I can't guarantee that—after all, there are so many production stages in the workshops. But after packaging and warehousing, all inventory is accounted for. Every entry and exit must be recorded. The warehouse manager is responsible for any discrepancy. Plus the warehouse does weekly inventory counts. Write-offs and disposals require procedures too—after write-off, items are destroyed on-site. Waste materials and defective products aren't allowed to leave the factory..."

"So you're saying it's completely impossible to obtain drugs without proper procedures?"

"Correct. Even Elders can't directly take drugs from the factory. Everything requires compliant procedures." Wang Liang said firmly. Then he asked Guo Huiwen curiously: "Weren't these systems originally helped drafted by Elder Zheng? When she came to train us back then, she repeatedly emphasized strict SOP compliance, saying: 'Systems, systems! A pharmaceutical factory must have rigorous quality systems for control!'"
