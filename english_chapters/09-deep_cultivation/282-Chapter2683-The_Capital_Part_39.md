# Chapter 2683: The Capital (Part 39)

"Is the news reliable?" He still somewhat dared not believe it.

"Reliable. The Tangbao [official gazette] from Guangdong will arrive in a few days. The text may have embellishments, but the fact that Shorn-hair Thieves broke into the Pearl River and are pressing on the city walls is something no one dares to conceal."

The intelligence he obtained now was first-hand material sent directly from Guangzhou by Liu Sha; the reliability was much higher than the gazette. No matter the details, the Shorn-hair Thieves' invasion was already an iron-clad matter.

Things having reached this point, he could only discuss with this Hearthstone Immortal, wondering how his Heavenly Book recorded this matter.

He was just about to instruct Wang Liang to invite Hearthstone Daoist, then thought that the situation in Guangzhou was still unclear at this moment. Moreover, this matter was not simply asking him to predict the future trend of the situation; more of it was wanting to probe his background. Nowadays, the gazette and memorial subjects hadn't reached the capital yet, and the news of Shorn-hair Thieves' invasion hadn't spread. Letting him know now, wouldn't it show that he had private individuals in Guangzhou secretly inquiring about news? Better to wait.

Thus, another five or six days passed. Only after the Guangdong gazette arrived in the capital did Wang Liang receive orders to invite Mr. Zhou.

To avoid people's eyes and ears, every face-to-face talk with Hearthstone Immortal was either getting him carried quietly into the Wang Residence in a small sedan chair at night or Master Wang visiting in plain clothes himself.

However, recently Master Wang rarely came to consult. When Wang Liang came to invite, Zhou Lezhi saw the Teacher's face looked quite surprised—and had a trace of unhappiness.

As for why he was unhappy, naturally, it was because the Teacher had recently successfully quelled domestic conflicts and intended to go perform some "plowing" tonight.

Arriving at the Wang family, the consultation would end at the third watch at least. The capital at night was not safe, so he would stay overnight at the Wang family, returning only at the fifth watch. If the Teacher wanted to plow, he would have to wait until dark again.

Zhou Lezhi was in his youth and naturally understood this sense of urgency when blood rushed to the brain. Seeing the Teacher's face full of unhappiness, he felt both sympathy and amusement.

*Humph humph, serves you right for being a full man who doesn't know the hunger of a hungry man!*

Since Master Wang came to invite, there was absolutely no part for refusal. Although Mr. Zhou relied on "foreseeing the future," he also knew that understanding friends were not easy to find. In this capital, Immortals and Demons were only one step apart.

Immediately, two sedan chairs carried the Zhou master and apprentice into the Wang Residence.

Wang Liang didn't say what the specific reason was. Mr. Zhou originally thought it was probably just an ordinary consultation like usual, but as soon as he stepped into the study, he felt things seemed somewhat abnormal. On the desk were placed many boxes of different sizes, and the room was also inexplicably piled with several iron pipes. Just as he was wondering, Wang Yehao had already welcomed him: "Mr. Zhou, something bad has happened!"

"Oh, what happened?"

"There is news of the Australians." Wang Yehao pointed at the various objects on the table and floor, saying, "Teacher please look; these are Australian objects this Official asked people to find."

"That isn't good news?" Mr. Zhou's eyes lit up after hearing this, his face full of excitement. "Where are they? Let's go quickly."

*Master Wang is indeed right; this Mr. Zhou is an Australian!* Zhou Lezhi thought.

Regarding the matter that Mr. Zhou was an Australian, Master Wang had talked with him. Usually when learning with Mr. Zhou, Mr. Zhou also unreservedly said his learning was all "Australian learning." However, he didn't say so earliest on, only claiming it was "overseas secret learning." Only after seeing Australian glass vessels did he change his tune.

"This matter is quite tortuous; Teacher please listen to this Official explain slowly." Wang Yehao signaled Mr. Zhou to sit, then said, "Last time we talked about Australians opening shops in Guangzhou to sell treasure vessels. This time, more than five hundred Australian sea bandits set up a stockade in Lingao County, Qiongzhou Prefecture..."

"What situation?" Mr. Zhou face was full of disbelief. "Five hundred people?" He muttered to himself: "Impossible, impossible, wormhole has mass limits; last time just a cart of things started shaking..."

Suddenly he realized he had made a slip of the tongue and immediately shut his mouth.

Aunque Wang Yehao was far away and didn't hear clearly what he said, he heard the words "five hundred people," "impossible," and "wormhole." Combining with his expression, he immediately understood that this Immortal Zhou indeed had a universe inside him [knew the secrets].

Not only was he an Australian, but he probably also knew the Australians' background very well!

If he himself went to become an official in Liangguang, this person would be of great use!

Mr. Zhou checked the various objects on the desk with doubts. these tattered scraps were picked up by villagers near the Australian camp after the Australians left—actually, they were all worthless trash, purely out of curiosity. Liu Sha specially collected them after receiving Master Wang's instructions and sent fast horses to deliver them to the capital.

In anyone's eyes, this was garbage. Although there were some broken glass vessels, broken glass vessels had no great value besides inlaying windows.

Hearthstone Daoist looked through this pile of trash carefully. The more he looked, the weirder his expression became: sometimes surprised, sometimes disdainful, sometimes confused... In short, the richness of expressions was something Zhou Lezhi had never seen before.

"These are also Australian objects?" Mr. Zhou pointed at a pile of copper and iron piping and castings on the ground and asked.

"Proprietor Guo also built a place of wind and moon in Guangzhou Prefecture called 'Purple Ming Pavilion' [*Ziminglou*], where it is said one can use magic to drive the power of water and fire. These are the tools of the ritual altar. In the Teacher's view, did these all come from the Qiankun Mirror?"

Mr. Zhou looked grave, repeatedly examining this pile of metal trash: "Looks like they should be. Did those five hundred Australians just fiddle with these all the time? Not worth it, right."

"Indeed, glazed glass vessels are the majority. Heard recently they also sold granulated sugar and paper, all not worth mentioning."

"Just now you said they are all entrenched in what Gao place?"

"Lingao County, Qiongzhou Prefecture."

"That is on Hainan Island. Does this county have any special features?"

"Lingao County is located remotely, has no significant produce, and possesses a small population; it is truly unknown."

"They don't do business properly in Guangzhou but ran to that poor country and remote soil to do what?"

"Teacher please look; these are the relevant memorial subjects and gazettes; I asked the private advisor to copy them together." Wang Yehao pushed the booklets on the table over. "According to the report from Lingao County at that time, Australian sea thieves came driving big iron ships..."

"Wait a moment!" Before Wang Yehao finished speaking, Mr. Zhou felt something was wrong. "How come there are also big iron ships?"

"Oh, Teacher don't blame me. Although this matter is unthinkable, there are many memorials corroborating it; it should not be a false rumor. According to reports, this ship is more than ten *zhang* high, more than half a *li* long, completely black throughout, without oars or sails..."

Mr. Zhou listened to Wang Yehao's introduction, his mouth opening wider and wider. It seemed the surprise in his heart had reached the peak.

"Holy crap! Even the mobile base was driven over; the ambition is big enough! Master, I think it is necessary for us to go find those Australians quickly. Delay is inadvisable."

"This matter is probably inappropriate." Wang Yehao's finger tapped on the booklet. "Australians used the sharpness of firearms to occupy Lingao and plot for Qiongzhou. Viceroy Wang gathered the power of the whole province to suppress but could do nothing. The whole army collapsed—now the Australians have arrived outside Guangzhou City..."

Mr. Zhou couldn't care about reserve anymore at this moment. He directly picked up the copy and read it carefully. Zhou Lezhi knew that although the Teacher claimed to have great learning, his skill in reading books was very terrible; most likely he couldn't understand these memorial subjects. Immediately he said: "Teacher, let me read it."

Just like this, Zhou Lezhi read while explaining in vernacular, finally letting Mr. Zhou know what the official documents meant: A guy named Wen claimed to be a remnant of the Song Dynasty, brought more than 500 men to land in Lingao, grabbed territory to engage in infrastructure, and incidentally traded materials. Then the government couldn't stand it and sent troops to suppress the bandits, resulting in being chased around by those 500 people. Now the 500 people were under Guangzhou City.

After listening, Mr. Zhou couldn't care about any demeanor or etiquette. He turned seven or eight circles back and forth in the study, then suddenly said to Wang Yehao: "Master, the Qiankun Mirror is definitely in the hands of that guy named Wen. Since the government army failed to suppress bandits, don't know if the court has any intention to offer amnesty? I am willing to go persuade them."

"This matter is being discussed in the court; there is no conclusion yet. It's just that Viceroy Wang has tried to recruit them before, but the Australian sea bandits have no heart to submit."

"If I go talk to them, maybe they will be willing. After all, that Qiankun Mirror is mine." Mr. Zhou was unwilling to give up.

"This Official thinks this matter is absolutely impermissible."

"Why?" Mr. Zhou asked with a face full of confusion.

"Teacher is confused!" Wang Yehao stomped his foot and beat his wrist, making a heartbroken appearance. "Did the Teacher forget Emperors Huizong and Qinzong?"

Mr. Zhou had a face full of incomprehension: "Those two captured emperors of the Song Dynasty? What about them?"

Wang Yehao sighed long and spoke娓娓 [tirelessly/in detail]: "In the past, Emperors Huizong and Qinzong were trapped in thieves' hands. Emperor Gaozong not only delayed rescue but also issued twelve gold medals to recall Yue Wumu [Yue Fei] to the capital for punishment. What was the purpose of all these actions? All for power and position. Now there is the thief named Wen, with the merit of being the first initiator, occupying the position of bandit chief, falsely claiming to be a descendant of the former Song, not submitting to the Great Ming's enlightenment, and faintly already having the intention of splitting the earth [separatism]. That the Qiankun Mirror is the Teacher's object is true, but how would that sea thief be willing to acknowledge it! If the Teacher goes, do you still think of being the Retired Emperor?"

Mr. Zhou had to admit Master Wang spoke very reasonably. Since it was an armed group, the water inside must be very deep. His own identity was indeed a bit awkward. If he went rashly, maybe he would really be reimbursed [killed] by a gun. However, since that gang opened a base, they should be planning a long-term operation; estimated they wouldn't leave in a short while. Rather than rushing over to send a head [get killed], better to make good preparations before probing.

Wang Yehao saw the other party's eyes shifting, wanting to speak but stopping. He knew the rhetoric just now had taken effect, so he asked along the flow: "This Qiankun Mirror is so amazing; does the Teacher have a method to crack it?"

"Not easy to handle; this Qiankun Mirror is quite hard to deal with." After expressing the difficulty, Mr. Zhou suddenly had his eyes light up and said, "Right, isn't the Lord taking over as Viceroy of Liangguang next year? At that time, we can think of a way to contact the Australians?"

"What did the Teacher say just now?" This time it was Wang Yehao's turn to be surprised. Although some people in the court were discussing this matter, it was firmly blocked by him at home. The Hearthstone Immortal, into whose ears "outside words did not enter," could not possibly know. Speaking so decisively showed it must be written in the "Heavenly Book."
