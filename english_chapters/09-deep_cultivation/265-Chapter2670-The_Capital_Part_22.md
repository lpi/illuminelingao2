# Chapter 2670: The Capital (Part 22)

Zhou Lezhi smiled slightly at the corners of his mouth as he listened to Liu Zhao talk about the failure of the Song brothers' attempt to swindle money at the escort agency. This was something expected. Once this matter came out, which city fox or shrine rat wouldn't want to take the opportunity to take a bite? Even those villains so small they couldn't even drink the soup wanted to lick some blood and taste the fishy smell.

If it weren't for Delong's tough brand and powerful backing, and the person in charge having ideas, saying that Master Leng's family wealth would be scattered by one-third would be an understatement.

"The team maintained by this Master Leng are all ruthless characters," Liu Zhao said. "Not a bit chaotic."

Zhou Lezhi said, "More than just not chaotic; they are probably operating outside. If we don't handle this carefully, I'm afraid we'll be bitten back by them."

Liu Zhao said, "Only I don't know how these Kun thieves will respond to the Master's letter."

"None of these people in the capital right now can make the decision," Zhou Lezhi laughed. "It must be reported to Lingao, and only after the True Kuns discuss it can a decision be made."

"Heavens, won't that take several months!"

"The Kun thieves have wireless radio boxes; messages can be communicated in an instant. This matter involves a True Kun thief, so there will be news in at most a month. Let's not move recklessly and just sit firmly on the fishing platform [remain calm]."

"It's just that Master Wang said last time that the Emperor is preparing to use troops and is already preparing to issue an edict for the Guangdong Suply Tax," Liu Zhao said. "Will it be in time?"

"The court mobilizing troops and horses is not something that happens overnight. Only after this Guangdong Tax is collected and there is silver can troops be mobilized. Don't even think about it without half a year or a year." Zhou Lezhi said seriously, "This period of time is enough for them to deliberate."

Since seeing Leng Ningyun last time and successfully obtaining his handwritten letter, Zhou Lezhi's mood had been very cheerful. In these years of fighting against the Kun thieves, he rarely had the upper hand, always falling into a disadvantageous position, and often receiving cold eyes from Minister Wang. If it weren't for Minister Wang knowing the Kun situation quite well, knowing that the Kun thieves were a serious confidant trouble of the Great Ming, and he, Zhou, being the first person in the Great Ming to know the Kuns, this cooperative relationship would have barely been maintained.

Leng Ningyun was the first Kun thief they had captured. Of course, arresting Leng Ningyun was not difficult; after all, he was right inside this Beijing city.

But catching him was very difficult. In the few years Leng Ningyun had been in the capital, he had already built a reliable protective umbrella for himself, especially the eunuchs in the palace, who treated Leng as the "God of Wealth," sending heaps of silver to his bank to earn interest. Trying to touch him through official channels was simply a fool's dream.

Obviously, the court's confidant trouble was right at the Son of Heaven's feet, yet he could only watch him source from left and right, absorbing financial resources. Not only could they not touch him, but they couldn't even plan an assassination. Otherwise, even Wang Yehao and other grand officials couldn't bear the consequences.

He remembered the "Interest Group" problem the Teacher had mentioned—indeed, this term described it exquisitely, going a step deeper than simple small groups like the "Eunuch Party," "Donglin Party," or "Zhejiang Party"—people gathered for interests.

Speaking of which, wasn't his planning this time to capture Leng Ningyun also for a certain interest group?

The grand officials said this was saving the country and saving lives, but others would say the same. Take these Kun thieves; they also used "saving the people from water and fire" as a guise.

"Lend me, lend me a pair of wisdom eyes..." He unconsciously hummed the little tune the Teacher often hummed back then.

Regrettably, he hadn't even learned one ten-thousandth of the Teacher's bellyful of learning. Not only did he not train a pair of wisdom eyes, but he also had to reluctantly shoulder heavy burdens.

His gaze turned to the corner of the study, to a peculiarly styled banner embroidered with the characters "Hanging Pot to Save the World." The edges were worn, and a gourd was tied to the bamboo staff.

These were all items left by the Teacher back then. Zhou Lezhi remembered the chance encounter outside Guangzhou city in the seventh year of Tianqi [1627]. In the spring of peach red and willow green, the Teacher carried a box on his back and held this banner, trudging on the ridges outside the village. His gait was stumbling, and the straight gown worn on his body was crooked and twisted, very laughable. Not to mention his curious "Guangzhou Mandarin" accent.

But it was a dose of medicine he took out from the gourd that saved him from the death line. Since then, everyone in the village called him the Divine Doctor. Many patients who were sent to Guangzhou city and couldn't be cured by famous doctors in big pharmacies were cured as soon as they took his medicine. Lin Qijin, who first invited him for diagnosis and treatment back then, bragged whenever he was free about how he had the wisdom eye to recognize talent.

Lin Qijin's wisdom eye was worthless, but the fame of the Divine Doctor spread. Before long, Imperial Commissioner Master Wang sent someone to invite the Teacher, and the Teacher entered Master Wang's shogunate [staff] from then on.

If it were just this, it would be nothing more than an ordinary past event. However, not long after Mr. Zhou left, government soldiers arrived at Hetou Village, saying they wanted to catch "sorcerers" and search for "sorcerous items." In the end, the sorcerer wasn't caught, but a few poor people who had taken the white rice relief from Mr. Zhou were taken to the village head and beheaded. The village was in an uproar, all saying the Teacher was a "sorcerer." Those who had taken the Teacher's medicine felt as if a great disaster was imminent, scrambling to burn incense and worship gods in the temple, begging for incense ash water to take—as for whether it was useful, only Heaven knew.

Zhou Lezhi had also taken the Teacher's medicine, but his parents had long died, and no one cared about him, so he was spared from drinking this incense ash water.

Although his body recovered, Zhou Lezhi's future was bleak. He had studied in the clan's private school, but failed the child candidate exams several times. Instead, he was interested in many miscellaneous studies. On ordinary days, he loved to set up a waterwheel in the ditch or set up a pipe with bamboo tubes, which was quite loved by children, but the clan elders and scholars unanimously thought he was a "waste."

However, this "waste" was also a child of the clan. Even without parents, the clan had to look after him. Seeing that he had studied until sixteen and couldn't even write an opening essay, the clan deliberated: it was better to let him learn a craft.

As for what craft to learn, before the elders could decide, the former Imperial Commissioner Master Wang sent Wang Liang to the village, saying they still wanted to search for "sorcerous items." Naturally, the final result was still nothing. Fortunately, they didn't kill anyone this time. Then this Wang Liang said he wanted to find a few youths in the village to be disciples for the Teacher, saying gender didn't matter as long as they were literate.

Everyone then realized that the Teacher was not a sorcerer. But since he wasn't a sorcerer, why take the men and women who had received the Teacher's grace and chop off their heads? No one understood, and naturally, no one dared to ask.

Naturally, it was impossible for the girls to be taken away. First, there were few literate girls to begin with; second, no one had heard of a man taking female disciples. The "Divine Doctor's" attempt was self-evident. It was just that it was neither "betrothing" a wife nor "buying" a concubine, but creating some nondescript "female disciple." If word got out, it would be truly incredible. After some back and forth, the "waste" Zhou Lezhi was selected—at that time, he wasn't called Zhou Lezhi yet.

Zhou Lezhi followed Wang Liang to Beijing in such a muddled way—this was his first time leaving his hometown. Traveling north all the way, taking more than two months, he arrived at the capital, the place of utmost goodness under heaven, covered in dust.

Arriving in the capital for the first time, Zhou Lezhi, who was from Guangdong, felt uncomfortable all over. Not only could he not understand the local Mandarin, but he couldn't understand the Zhejiang dialect spoken by the servants in Wang Yehao's residence. In comparison, the Teacher's strange Guangzhou Mandarin was easier to communicate with.

The Teacher at this time was very different from when he appeared in Hetou Village. He could speak decent Mandarin, had the demeanor a scholar should have in his gestures, and even his clothes didn't have the awkward feeling of the past.

It could be seen that the Teacher was very trusted in the Wang residence. Not only were the servants very respectful to him, but Master Wang also frequently summoned him for dialogues, talking for half a day at a time. He was said to be a "Secretary," but in reality, his treatment was far above other staff members. Master Wang even specially allocated two maids to serve his daily life. Undoubtedly, relying solely on being a "Divine Doctor" wouldn't garner such high regard.

This finally put Zhou Lezhi's suspended heart at ease upon his arrival. Only when the master does well can the apprentice have rice to eat. Otherwise, losing one's job in the capital thousands of *li* away, one wouldn't even know how to open one's mouth to beg for food.

Upon entering the Teacher's tutelage, he first underwent a round of "testing"—he only learned this term later. He was asked many questions, some of which were completely nonsensical. For example, "Do you think thunder is caused by the Thunder God striking or some other reason?" Finally, when he learned that Zhou Lezhi was not only literate but could also do simple arithmetic problems, he was quite satisfied with him.

"You are now my student," he suddenly said in a Mandarin with a peculiar accent. "The first thing is to learn to speak like me."

Zhou Lezhi was full of suspicion. He had never heard of this kind of Mandarin. Although it had some similarities to Capital Mandarin, the pronunciation and vocabulary were quite different.

Since he became an apprentice, naturally, whatever the Teacher said went. Let alone learning to speak like him, even excessive requests had to be agreed to.

"...Don't think I am meddlesome; I have a bellyful of learning here..." The Teacher pointed to his own head somewhat comically. "But this knowledge can only be conveniently taught after you learn the language I speak—do you want to learn my skills?"

Did that even need saying! Zhou Lezhi thought. Wang Liang and others had said when he entered the residence that the Teacher knew astronomy above and geography below, and knew many "supreme studies," which was why Master Wang valued him so much. Leaving aside all that, just the master's medical skills in treating illnesses and making medicine would be enough for him to establish a family and career if he learned them.

So he followed the Teacher, starting with this strange "Mandarin." Later, the Teacher told him this was called "Putonghua" [Common Speech], the language current in his hometown. Once he learned "Putonghua," he could read many "secret manuals" written in Putonghua and learn the knowledge within.

"Isn't the Teacher Master Wang's fellow townsman, both from Shaoxing Prefecture?" Zhou Lezhi asked in confusion at that time. He had heard enough Shaoxing dialect spoken by the Wang family servants on the way and was very familiar with this dialect.

"I am indeed his fellow townsman, and indeed from Shaoxing Prefecture." The Teacher smiled. "It's just that the details are slightly different."

"What is the difference?"
