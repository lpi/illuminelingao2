# Chapter 2563 - Zheng Mingjiang

Zhang Xiao paused, took a sip of tea, and said: "In this great Guangzhou Prefecture, if there aren't ten thousand sons as filial as you, there are at least eight thousand. Those willing to sell... willing to sacrifice everything to save their loved ones' lives are countless beyond number. I'm helping you not because you're most filial or supremely filial, nor because you're well-read. It's because I believe you can still do something for the Senate, for the people—create a brighter tomorrow for this world."

Zhang Jiayu understood Zhang Xiao's meaning. He kowtowed in thanks: "One conversation with you, sir, is worth ten years of books. Jiayu respectfully receives your instruction."

"From today, you're my man." Zhang Xiao said with a touch of mischievous humor. "Consider yourself my staff aide. For now, study at home and go to the Shen'ao Study Society daily to prepare for next year's Guangzhou Municipal Government civil service examination. You must pass."

"Yes." Zhang Jiayu had originally had no interest in this civil service examination, but having obtained the miracle medicine to save his mother and being able to smoothly infiltrate the Baldies as an undercover agent—it could be called killing two birds with one stone. Moreover, from this true Baldy's words, there seemed to be intentions of using him heavily. This would be an advantageous condition for his undercover work.

Zhang Xiao was quite satisfied—after all, he had successfully recruited the famous personage Zhang Jiayu. Though he wasn't a "historical celebrity collector," seeing a famous figure "kowtow in submission" still gave him a sense of satisfaction. It seemed Comrade Little Du's persistence wasn't without reason.

"Get up now. Today I'll personally make the trip for you." Zhang Xiao could have directly hired him as a councillor. But the position of councillor, frankly speaking, was a sinecure for winning people over—once you took it, there was no future to speak of. Old bureaucrats like Wei Bifu and Huang Xiyin could pass time in such positions, but having a promising young person like Zhang Jiayu do it would be too wasteful. Better to have him take the civil service route.

Zhang Xiao instructed the orderly to arrange a sedan to send Zhang's mother to the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital for examination, and also wrote a note specifying that she wanted an Elder physician's consultation.

Just then, Huang Xiyin arrived at the office following Tian Liang.

Seeing Huang Xiyin's wretched appearance, Zhang Xiao was startled. He had clearly been beaten. Who in Guangzhou territory was so bold? He couldn't help asking curiously: "Councillor Huang, did you fall into a ditch? How did even your eye sockets get bruised purple?"

Huang Xiyin, the dignified former Ming dynasty Nanhai County Magistrate, had been beaten until his face looked like a paint shop by Kuang Lu's fists. Utterly humiliated, naturally he couldn't swallow this resentment. He reported to Zhang Xiao: "Chief, Kuang Lu is a villain with sinister intentions. He actually wrote seditious poetry on the Academy library wall. Subordinate was injured by him while trying to stop this villain. Chief, you must punish him severely as a warning to others!"

"Oh, there's such a thing?" Zhang Xiao raised his eyebrows and looked at Tian Liang.

Tian Liang said: "Chief, Councillor Huang was indeed beaten by Kuang Lu. I've already apprehended him—he should be in the detention center now."

"This is the seditious poem he wrote!" Huang Xiyin produced a sheet of xuan paper from his sleeve. "Your student copied it down. The original poem is still on the Zunxin Pavilion wall—please send someone to investigate immediately."

Zhang Xiao took it and looked. He thought to himself that this Kuang Lu was indeed wild and unrestrained: this poem couldn't be more seditious; and he'd struck hard too. Truly a fierce one.

"Since Kuang Lu has already been arrested, let him stew in jail for a few days to cool off. We'll discuss it later." Zhang Xiao shook his head somewhat helplessly and said: "Councillor Huang, come with me to the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital to see a doctor."

"This lowly official is fine, really fine."

"Better get checked," Zhang Xiao said. "After all, it concerns your face—wouldn't want it to be disfigured."

"Many thanks for the Chief's concern!"

Zhang Xiao was in an excellent mood. First, Zhang Jiayu had "kowtowed in submission" and could be taken on as a junior; second, Kuang Lu had actually written seditious poetry openly in the Academy and assaulted an official. Now he had him right where he wanted him. Beating Huang Xiyin wasn't a big deal—Senate law emphasized equality before the law with no provisions for "subordinate offending superior" or "lowly offending noble" adding to the crime. As long as it didn't meet the light injury standard, it was just detention and compensation. But writing seditious poetry—that could be made as big or as small as desired.

Just as he was humming a tune on his way to the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, a messenger came to report: "Director Zheng invites you to dinner tonight."

"Dinner?" Zhang Xiao immediately had a bad premonition. He understood Zheng Mingjiang somewhat—she definitely wasn't someone who would casually arrange dinner gatherings. If she was treating, there was surely something she wanted to discuss.

Zheng Mingjiang had arrived in Guangzhou on the same ship as Zhang Xiao.

Ever since she'd quarreled with her father and left home in a huff to "do something big," Zheng Mingjiang had arrived at Lingao in this timeline.

Gradually adapting to life in Lingao—or perhaps simply accepting her fate—she had set a goal for herself: become the academic authority of this timeline!

This goal was neither novel nor difficult, but Zheng Mingjiang still worked very hard, so as to become the psychological shadow of medical students as soon as possible.

After spending several years in Lingao living a life confined to the county, Zheng Mingjiang had deeply experienced why house arrest was also a form of punishment. So she decided to actively participate in various dispatch and support activities. However, her lifestyle was highly dependent on Lingao's industrialization achievements, so she only wanted to go out for fresh air rather than staying outside for long, taking on positions like hospital director somewhere.

"As an Elder, work when you should work, be a salted fish when you should be a salted fish. After all, I'm the ruling class—I don't need to follow others' KPIs." This was Zheng Mingjiang's famous saying while lying in the sun.

But being a salted fish wasn't that easy either. Zheng Mingjiang was currently the director of both Obstetrics and Gynecology and Neurology at Lingao General Hospital. So this salted fish couldn't be all that salty—after all, so many patients and expectant mothers were waiting. Even if she was the ruling class, she still had a doctor's conscience to get past.

So Zheng Mingjiang decided to go out for some fresh air. Hearing that Zhang Xiao and Lin Motian were heading north to the mainland, she decided to hitch a ride to relax. For this, Zheng Mingjiang submitted an application to Shi Niaoren, saying she was preparing to represent the Health Ministry to inspect and guide work at the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, particularly the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology work and the promotional work for "new-style midwifery."

The application was naturally approved immediately. Zheng Mingjiang, whose purpose was sightseeing, was in excellent spirits. Before departure at the dock, she even broke into song. If she hadn't needed to maintain an Elder's image, she might even have twirled around. But after the ship departed, she got seasick—she had gotten seasick again.

Because of this, she hadn't participated at all in building revolutionary friendship among the Elders; she didn't even want to eat. But just as Lin Motian was actively helping Zhang Xiao take stock of which naturalized cadre stragglers could still be poached, Zheng Mingjiang finally appeared. Due to seasickness, she'd basically slept whenever possible throughout the journey, only crawling up to the deck to join the conversation when they were nearly at shore.

Zhang Xiao was serving as an administrative cadre for the first time, while Lin Motian was returning from a Lingao business trip to continue work at the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, so the three had notably different vibes.

When Zhang Xiao asked Zheng Mingjiang if she had any cadres to recommend, Zheng Mingjiang threw up both hands: "As you know, yours truly only wants to be an academic authority. I have absolutely no interest in being local chief executive or frontier governor, so I know nothing about cadre reserves."

"Fine." Zhang Xiao sighed, once again confronting the reality of the Senate's severe shortage of qualified cadre reserves.

"Chief Zheng, all your luggage is here. If there's no problem, we'll take it directly to the guesthouse."

"Mm." Zheng Mingjiang pointed at her luggage cases while saying: "Take these two rattan-wood cases directly to the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital. Take the rest to the guesthouse." Actually, Zheng Mingjiang didn't know where the so-called guesthouse was or what it looked like, but obviously there couldn't be a better place to stay in this timeline than the Senate guesthouse.

"What's in those two sealed cases?" Hearing that two cases were going directly to the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, Lin Motian suddenly became curious.

"Hehe!" Zheng Mingjiang suddenly felt like she'd come back to life from her seasickness. "These are Lingao specialties that the Health Ministry is sending to the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital. The Senate's radiance warms people's hearts!"

Though Zheng Mingjiang's smile was bright, Lin Motian felt a chill down his spine. He'd thought it was medical supplies, but on second thought, hadn't he himself just been to Lingao on a business trip? What supplies would need Zheng Mingjiang to bring them? Now seeing her benevolent—ah no, benign—smile made it feel even more bizarre.

Before going their separate ways at the dock, Lin Motian expressed that Zhang Xiao and Zheng Mingjiang were welcome to come to the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital for... inspection anytime.

"Don't worry! I'll come once I recover from seasickness!"

The guesthouse was inside the Great World. Though the Great World was reasonably bustling, the guesthouse's location was quite secluded, and combined with the relatively modern décor, Zheng Mingjiang was quite satisfied. On the coffee table in the small sitting room were two plates of small pastries, with a "Zhang's" promotional flyer underneath.

Though the pastries looked nice and smelled nice, out of caution about Guangzhou's sanitary conditions, Zheng Mingjiang still didn't eat them.

After resting at the guesthouse overnight and recovering her spirits, Zheng Mingjiang brought her life secretary out for a stroll, grandly calling it "going to the grassroots." After sufficiently inspecting the Great World's commercial situation, the two arrived at the entrance of Zhang's Food Shop. Zheng Mingjiang hadn't eaten the pastries, but her secretary had finished them all and said they were delicious. This raised her interest in this long-famous confectionery shop.

"Chief, I'm hungry."

"Alright, let's go in and take a look."

Before the two could enter, a shop assistant came forward to greet them: "Welcome, Chief, to Zhang's Pastry Shop! Our humble shop is honored by your presence. Chief, please come in—we have elegant seats upstairs."

"Mm." Since she'd been recognized, Zheng Mingjiang didn't stand on ceremony. "Where are your business license and sanitary permit? Let me see them."

"Right away!" The assistants here had seen many Elders and promptly pointed at the wall: "Look here—the originals of both the business license and sanitary permit are right here. The copies are in the office upstairs. If you'd like to see them, I'll go get them right now."

"No need for the trouble." Zheng Mingjiang said flatly, her expression neutral, giving no indication whether she was satisfied or not. "Do you have a warehouse or preparation room here?"
