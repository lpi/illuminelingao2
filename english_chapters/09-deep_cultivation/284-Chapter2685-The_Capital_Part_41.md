# Chapter 2685: The Capital (Part 41)

Gou Chengxuan stood before the *Ziminglou* on Huifu Street, which had already been looted empty, looking lost and desperate. Thinking of his family broken and perished, and his future completely ruined, an inexplicable grief and indignation welled up in his heart. With no outlet for his nameless evil fire, Gou Chengxuan could only pick up a broken brick from the roadside and smash it vigorously against the door sealed with official strips, roaring through gritted teeth: "Shameless Shorn-hair Thieves, I curse you all to die a bad death!"

"This Young Master, why behave like this?" Gou Chengxuan didn't expect there would be someone in the deep street and cold alley beside him. This sudden voice frightened him into thinking the Shorn-hair Thieves had chased him here, and he almost knelt to beg for mercy. After focusing his eyes to look, Gou Chengxuan discovered the person speaking was a wandering Daoist with graying beard and hair. The Daoist held a banner of "Iron Mouth, Honest Fortunes," sitting upright by the roadside, with a Daoist boy standing behind him, looking quite like an expert from outside the world.

"Who is Your Excellency?" Seeing the other party didn't look like a Shorn-hair Thief, Gou Chengxuan emboldened himself to ask.

"Face reading and character dismantling, eliminating disasters and resolving difficulties." The Daoist smiled faintly, flicking his horsetail whisk to point at the banner. "This Poor Daoist wanders the four seas and happened to pass by your precious land. Meeting today is fate; why doesn't Young Master come to calculate a trigram?"

"I have no money." Gou Chengxuan tightened his cloth robe, ensuring the life-saving silver hidden in his bosom was still there.

"Not taking a penny." The Daoist still wore that smile that made people unable to figure him out. "Forgive this Poor Daoist for speaking out of turn; Young Master is afraid your fate has been harmed by treacherous villains and thus fell into distress here, right?"

Having his sore spot poked by the other party, Gou Chengxuan's curiosity was aroused. He walked up skeptically and asked: "What does the Daoist Master have to teach me?"

"Wealth and honor fate, future prospects and marriage; whatever Young Master wants to ask, just grant a character." The Daoist said as he smoothed out a paper roll, and the Daoist boy respectfully handed over brush and ink.

Gou Chengxuan smiled bitterly, thinking if the Shorn-hair Thieves were not eliminated, what future could he talk about? Holding the brush and pondering briefly, he wrote a "Thief" [*Zei*] character: "Just ask when those Shorn-hair Thieves will run rampant until?"

"Sir asks strangely." The Daoist pointed at the "Thief" character, shaking his head and swaying his brain to dismantle it. "Looking at this character, the Shorn-hair Thieves are probably not easy to deal with. This 'Thief' character comes from *Bei* [Wealth] and *Rong* [Weapons]. *Bei* is wealth and goods; *Rong* is soldiers and weapons. Obtaining these two, one can dominate a region. This time the Imperial Court used troops, firstly not cutting off their money and grain, secondly not blunting their military edge. It seems those Shorn-hair Thieves are probably going to occupy Qiongzhou for a long time."

"Could it be that my Great Ming can do nothing about these bandits?" Gou Chengxuan sighed with a desolate expression and continued to ask, "Can the Daoist Master calculate the future for the lowly one?"

"Sir lend your hand for a look."

Gou Chengxuan reached out his hand, but unexpectedly was grabbed firmly by the Daoist. Startled, he wanted to break free, but didn't expect it felt like being clamped by iron pincers; for a moment he actually couldn't break free. Gou Chengxuan dared not make a scene, so he could only beg for mercy in a low voice: "Daoist Master, why suffer this? If you want money, I still have a few mace of silver here to give you... Ow ow... If you don't let go, I'm going to shout for people!"

However, the Daoist not only didn't let go but instead said smilingly: "Does Sir have enmity with those Shorn-hair Thieves? Might as well say it; this Poor Daoist can analyze it for Sir."

The Daoist hit the mark with one sentence, making Gou Chengxuan shudder involuntarily. However, thinking that Gou Chengxuan was also a master who had escaped death repeatedly, how could he easily reveal his background? Even in urgency, he only laughed it off and said: "Why does Daoist Master say this?" wanting to fudge it over.

"Observing Sir's dropped characters like gold hooks and iron strokes, indispensable of ten years of cold window study. Looking again at Sir's cloth robe, although it is top-grade new material, there are many stains and damages; presuming these days must have been quite wretched. Just now Sir also smashed that Shorn-hair Thief's old nest with brick and stone; the cause and effect therein are not hard to guess." The Daoist paused deliberately, waiting until the appetite was sufficiently whetted, before lowering his voice to ridicule, "Does Sir know recently there are quite a few defeated soldiers fleeing from Qiongzhou? The Governor-General's Yamen entrance still has rewards posted. Anyone escaping privately and refusing to return to camp is treated as a spy."

Gou Chengxuan was spoken to until cold sweat broke out all over his body. He said tremblingly: "You... what do you want to do!"

"Hahaha, Sir don't panic. That few taels of reward silver this Poor Daoist doesn't look upon." The Daoist suddenly put away his smile, asking aggressively with sharp eyes, "I just ask you, did you flee from the front in defeat?"

"If yes so what, if no so what!" Gou Chengxuan turned pale with fright. He was not an ordinary soldier but a private advisor on the roster. Now the sea-crossing army was completely annihilated; he fled back alone. If he didn't report to the Governor-General's Yamen for investigation, being caught would absolutely be no good thing.

If he were a Guangzhou local or an old person in the official army, it would be fine, but he was a genuine "outsider" plus "newcomer," with neither background nor backer, and even had a household registration from the "Bandit's Nest." If he really went to report, wouldn't he be an excellent "spy"? Not guaranteed which Lord or Adult would "borrow his head for a use."

Thinking of this, his soul flew and spirit dispersed—Shorn-hair Thieves were certainly detestable, but the official lords' insidiousness made one tremble even more. In these few months on the campaign journey, he had fully witnessed it.

Thinking of this, he said with a trembling voice: "Daoist Master, Good Fellow, please let the lowly one go. As long as it is what the lowly one knows, I will say all without reserve..."

"Since so, this Poor Daoist has one matter unclear; still hope Sir tells the truth." The Daoist pointed south and asked, "How was Regional Commander He defeated this time?"

Gou Chengxuan's wrist hurt, and he dared not conceal, spilling everything out like pouring beans: "Shorn-hair Thieves' bird guns are sharp; cavalry couldn't even get close. Several charges were pressed back. Cannons are even more terrifying; one shot destroys for tens of *li*. Regional Commander He's Red Barbarian Cannons were simply no match..."

The Daoist listened to the narration, his face becoming increasingly gloomy. only after asking for details did he loosen his hand. Gou Chengxuan felt as if granted a great amnesty; seeing an opportunity, he sprinted out directly. Before the Daoist could recover, he had already run until no trace was seen. Waiting until running out of breath, Gou Chengxuan found a secluded alley directly, stopped, then hurriedly took off his cloth robe, smeared his face with mud, and dressed up as a beggar.

He dared not stay in the city anymore; hurriedly go outside the city to find an uninhabited place to hide for now!

Liu Sha saw him running away without a trace and didn't mind either. He whispered a few instructions to the Daoist boy.

This person being able to escape back from the chaos of the army in Qiongzhou was very simple. In his speech, not only did he have deep hatred for Shorn-hair Thieves, but he was also familiar with the Thief Situation; he was exactly the talent the Master wanted to use. Him running away now didn't matter; in this Guangzhou City, as long as the right door was found, there was no person who couldn't be found.

As for finding such a door, it wasn't difficult for them who came from the Northern Division.

October in the Southern Country still had undissipated summer heat. Even after the third drum of dusk was beaten, it was still oppressively hot. Liu Sha set up the stall for a day and was just preparing to pack up and return to the inn when suddenly a greeting sound came from his ear.

"Liu Mutou [Wood]! Yo, it really is you!"

Liu Sha turned his head to look, seeing a lean, tall man waving at him at the street corner.

"You are... Huang Laoliu! How come I meet you here!"

This Huang Laoliu was originally also a nail monitoring officials in the capital. He had some friendship with the Liu Sha brothers; although not particularly familiar, at any rate, there was the feeling of comrades-in-arms. Having not seen each other for many years and reuniting in a foreign land, both were in high spirits, so they held hands to seek a wine shop to catch up. After three rounds of wine and five flavors of dishes, speaking of current situations, turns out Huang Laoliu also lost his job last year. Fortunately, he had a sworn big brother here, so he came to Guangzhou to make a living.

Reuniting after a long separation, the two's topic went from capital secret news all the way to the Nanhai Shorn-hair Thieves. Here Liu Sha was still lamenting the Shorn-hair Thieves' firearms were sharp; over there Huang Laoliu had a face full of disdain. Don't know if it was the alcohol rushing to his head or deliberately talking big, Huang Laoliu patted his chest and shouted: "Think you and I brothers have capability in vain, surprisingly had rice bowls smashed by those sour scholars; truly fucking frustrating. Look at that bunch of good-for-nothings; can't even deal with a few Shorn-hair Thieves; afraid people will laugh if said out loud."

"Brother Huang's words are wrong; those Shorn-hair Thieves' firearms are sharp; it is said even Red Barbarian Cannons can do nothing!"

"Hehe, Brother Liu is scared gutless by those good-for-nothings' rhetoric. I see those Shorn-hair Thieves' firearms are also common and ordinary." Huang Laoliu spoke to here, deliberately leaning over to lower his voice, speaking mysteriously, "Brother, I have seen the real guys!"

"What real guys?"

Huang Laoliu had a face full of pride. "Since it is own brother, don't fear saying for you to hear. Shorn-hair Thieves although fierce, when falling alone are just human all the same. This Shorn-hair Thief firearm, Brother has one execution."

"Is this true?"

"Could there be fake? Nowadays Brother I am currently seeking buyers for those few bird guns." Huang Laoliu laughed.

Liu Sha was overjoyed upon hearing this, thinking this was truly "wearing out iron shoes searching nowhere, getting it all without wasting effort." He searched bitterly for these few months; unexpectedly, there was still ready-made business. How could such a good thing be missed: "Brother Huang surely has good means! Don't know if this Shorn-hair Thief sharp weapon can let Brother open eyes?"

"This well..." Huang Laoliu rubbed his hands and scratched his head, appearing somewhat embarrassed. "Things are in my hands, but what I do after all is not ordinary business; seeing light and catching wind, fear might move the wealth luck."

Liu Sha heard the joint in the words and quickly took out an ingot of silver from his bosom to flash: "Brother, what other buyer do you seek? As long as it is real goods, price is easy to discuss!"

"Brother Liu good handwriting [generosity]!" Huang Laoliu stared at the silver with eyes glowing, wine also sobering up by three tenths. "Brother Liu, do you have a way to get rich?"

"Hehe, not hiding from you, ever since losing the Town-soothing Division [North Division] job, Brother I joined a master who recognizes talent. This new Master has high position and heavy weight, and is generous as a person, but uniquely loves these Shorn-hair Thief objects. Don't mention your few bird guns; even if there is a cannon, we also collect."

"Good to say, good to say; then in the future will rely on Brother Liu to look after more." Huang Laoliu was just about to take the silver, but Liu Sha shrank back:

"Not seeing the True Buddha, do not burn incense; this is rule of the Jianghu." Saying so, he threw a string of copper coins out. "Keep this running leg money for now; after the matter is done, there will be separate thanks."

Huang Laoliu laughed embarrassedly: "Understood! You rest assured, won't delay matters! Silver or whatever Brother also doesn't care; if there is any chance to serve on duty, still hope Big Brother looks after Little Brother one or two!"

"Good to say."

Huang Laoliu collected the copper coins into his bosom, suddenly frowned, and said: "Not hiding from Brother Liu, this bird gun is outside the city. A few days earlier it was still convenient, but right now Shorn-hair Thieves are doing harm in the Pearl River Estuary; city gate defense is much stricter. Passing goods all must be interrogated. Bird guns must be handed over outside the city."
