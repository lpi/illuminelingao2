# Chapter 2526: Chen Wuren

"Little Zhang, sit." Xiao Zishan drank a mouthful of strong tea and signaled. "I've pondered for a long time. Although you have been fighting on the industrial front, I know that with your ability, you can go even further. Now there is an opportunity; I wonder if you are interested in grasping it?"

Zhang Xiao's eyebrows raised slightly, and a slightly surprised expression flashed across his face. "Director Xiao, you know me. I was originally an outcast of the old world, with no kin or cause, which is why I chose this death-like crossing adventure. It was just to find the meaning of my existence."

"Uh-huh." Xiao Zishan nodded. Having held the position of Director of the General Office of the Senate for many years, he knew the background of every Senator like the back of his hand.

"I have struggled in Lingao for ten years, from basic labor to the Grand Library, from the Grand Library to the factory, from the factory to Fangcaodi, from Fangcaodi to the fields and hospitals. I have left too many beautiful memories. I like this simple life. reducing the suffering of the masses and changing their fate through the technology I replicated. I feel I have already found the value of existence," Zhang Xiao said.

"So, you are not interested in this opportunity? You don't even know what opportunity it is," Xiao Zishan said with a smile.

"In this era, opportunities are everywhere." Zhang Xiao also responded with a smile.

"Good lad! Hehehe, you see things quite clearly." Xiao Zishan showed a look of considerable appreciation. "It seems that without enough temptation, you won't move your nest."

"Director Xiao, look at what you're saying; what kind of person do you take me for? As long as the organization needs it, I absolutely obey arrangements," Zhang Xiao teased.

"Oh?" Xiao Zishan said. "The Organization Department plans to arrange for a Senator who understands biotechnology and chemistry to go to Guangzhou and complete the promotion work of the Mulberry Dike Fish Pond project with Senator Li Yao'er."

Zhang Xiao listened with a dumbfounded look, touching his forehead as if black lines were appearing. "I say, Director Xiao, I'm just a medicine brewer; Mulberry Dike Fish Ponds are poles apart from me—if you insist it's related, maybe the veterinary medicine part is related. With heaps of people in the agricultural sector not chosen, why must it be me?"

Xiao Zishan signaled with his hand for Zhang Xiao not to rush. "Using 'Mulberry Dike Fish Pond' to summarize this project is not quite accurate. Strictly speaking, it is the Guangdong Textile Industry Improvement Plan. Not only Mulberry Dike Fish Ponds, but it also includes the silk weaving industry, cotton textile industry, and printing and dyeing industry. Your major actually comes in handy. Besides, Guangzhou also needs more people." Xiao Zishan picked up a slip of paper and read it out word by a word: "General-Xiao, Deep-Plowing-Task-Heavy, Send-Senator-To-Help-Speedily. You are a smart person; I won't say more."

Zhang Xiao couldn't help but ponder. Although the industrial sector was indeed the lifeline of Lingao currently, having been immersed in it for many years, he knew deeply that the development of an industrial system was definitely not something achieved overnight. Even to trigger the First Industrial Revolution, it was impossible without decades of accumulation. Standing in the industrial sector, needless to say, he would rise step by step in rank, but playing around, he would at most manage a factory, or at big deal, manage a system. In the end, he was still a technical cadre.

Perhaps this was truly an opportunity.

Zhang Xiao replied, "Director Xiao, you have been in charge of the Organization Department for so many years; you should understand the principle of 'if the name is not correct, the words will not run smooth.'"

Xiao Zishan nodded and handed over a list from the desk: Shunde, Gaohe, Xiangshan, Dongguan, Zengcheng, Boluo... It listed a row of names of counties formerly under Guangzhou Prefecture. "If you want to come back in the future, the industrial sector will certainly welcome you at any time."

Zhang Xiao flipped through it carefully, and after a moment, pointed his finger outside the list and said, "I choose here."

"Nanhai?" Xiao Zishan asked suspiciously.

"You said letting me choose."

"You, ah, you..." Xiao Zishan shook his head slightly, smiling yet not smiling. "Since you want to choose Nanhai, let it be Nanhai. However, you lack administrative experience, so we can only let you serve as the Executive Vice Magistrate of Nanhai County. I will add a position of Guangzhou Special City Inspector for you. This way, you can express opinions in other counties—these counties are currently managed by Guangzhou City—and preside over work when necessary, but you must have Liu Xiang's authorization beforehand."

After Zhang Xiao left, Xiao Zishan muttered to himself, "Go, go. As long as you go, I count as having been a good person."

Late at night, in the large private room on the third floor of the Nanhai Café, a small farewell party was being held. As the Senate spread people onto the mainland like sprinkling pepper, the number of Senators coming here became scarce day by day, but it remained a place frequently visited by Senators staying in Lingao.

"Old Zhang, are you really going? Now you're going to be labeled as a 'hypocritical Southward faction, ambitious Northward faction.'" Chen Huan of the Chemical Industry Ministry had an incredible expression, deeply doubting the decision of this die-hard Southward faction member.

"The high-level playing of divide and conquer is quite smooth. If you don't go, you'll be left with a charge of disobeying organizational arrangements; if you go, you are a traitor to the Southward faction. Before leaving, you should still gather with Old Zhou; don't hurt the harmony," said Jin Zhe of the Metallurgy Ministry.

"Old Zhou is not that kind of person." Zhang Xiao said, holding a kvass. "We argued for so long; you and I both know that going south is still for the sake of going north. There is originally no North-South dispute in the world; when more people say it, it exists. If Guangzhou is not governed well, the Senate cannot take root in the mainland. Whether going south or north, it is all for the same goal; this is everyone's common interest. Besides, why do you think I chose Nanhai?"

"Nanhai is where Rebel Ma gilded his secretary," Zeng Kun said with understanding.

"Come come come, brothers, let's have another drink. Wish Birdman Zhang smooth sailing, don't follow in the footsteps of Xie the Kun, hahaha..." Luo Haitao of the Machinery Ministry roared.

"If you become like Xie Erren, I'll f*cking have to throw two rotten eggs at you at the inquiry meeting, hahaha..." Zha Wuchu roared.

Several days later, Zhang Xiao visited Yang Yun of the Human Resources Division of the Livelihood Committee. When he came out of his office, he held a list in his hand.

As an industrial Senator who had managed hundreds of tool-people, he knew it was absolutely impossible without his own team. Although Xiao Zishan promised to keep his position in the industrial sector, he wouldn't touch the people in the original factory: taking technical personnel was of little use, and would instead weaken his influence in the factory.

These days, as the news of his going north spread, people of all stripes in the naturalized citizen group came to find him, hoping to cling to the big tree and rise rapidly. But the interviewees were either frivolous and boastful or lacked experience, and some couldn't even speak smoothly. Zhang Xiao was so angry he made the big orange cat he borrowed from Lin Motian's house with three oranges scream from petting, while still having to feign calm on his face, saying with a淡然 expression: "You are not even willing to call me Senator!"

But thinking about it, the Senate's mainland strategy was extremely short of people. Good and easy-to-use cadres had long been snatched up by others. How could they easily flow into his hands? He had no choice but to find Yang Yun.

Loud leather shoe steps echoed in the corridor of the affiliated factory of Lingao Special City First Prison. Fu Youdi, who had been promoted to Warden, was still very concerned about the grassroots and often went down to the front line to inspect work conditions.

Chen Wuren was busy in the office filling out reports and other management documents. His desk was piled with documents, and the wall behind him was pasted with monthly production progress charts and labor distribution maps. At the very top was a line of large red characters: "Work hard to reform, become a new person."

As soon as Fu Youdi appeared at the office door, Chen Wuren stood up like a spring as if by conditioned reflex. His back was straight.

Fu Youdi looked askance at him: "At ease! Why did you come to work today too? Today is your birthday. You can rest for a day."

Chen Wuren's voice trembled slightly as he replied, "Report, I can indeed rest today, but the monthly plan is about to be reported. I want to audit it again to avoid mistakes."

Fu Youdi sneered, "You are quite active."

Chen Wuren didn't know how to respond to this. He knew it was best to say nothing at this time.

Fu Youdi looked him up and down coldly for a while and asked, "How much longer do you need?"

"Half... half an hour will be fine..."

"I'll give you two hours. Handle everything at hand and hand over the work to your deputy. Then come to the Warden's office." After speaking, the sound of leather shoes gradually faded away.

With a "boom" in Chen Wuren's brain, he trembled all over.

Although it was serving a sentence, there were good and bad places to serve a sentence. Moreover, here, he had already climbed to the "top layer" of prisoners and was the person in charge of the affiliated factory.

Fu Youdi's declaration was equivalent to removing him from his position. Without asking, going to the Warden's office meant "other arrangements."

What arrangements? Chen Wuren had already thought of countless terrifying possibilities. He secretly pondered that he had been conscientious these past few years and hadn't done anything out of line... Could it be...

He dared not think further and could only lower his head to process work, murmuring, "Blind Zhang calculated that my luck would turn at thirty-five, turn luck, turn luck..."

Two hours later, he stood in the Warden's office. Fu Youdi said nothing, only ordering him to wait.

He lowered his head facing the wall, waiting in fear and unease. Beside him was the sound of Fu Youdi pacing. He was smoking—one after another. He knew this fiend was also nervous about something.

In the distance, *clomp clomp clomp*, the sound of leather boots stepping came, getting closer and closer.

"For the Senate and the People!"

The footsteps stopped. Chen Wuren could only hear Fu Youdi's nervous and heavy breathing.

Chen Wuren secretly turned his head to try and take a look at what happened, but his scalp was immediately pressed down firmly by a hand, and his whole person was stuck to the wall like a shrimp, unable to move.

"Let him go!" came a stranger's voice. "Turn around!"

Chen Wuren turned around immediately. A pair of exquisite leather shoes appeared in his field of vision. The corner of his eye twitched: these were special supply leather shoes for Senators!

Zhang Xiao frowned. "You are the former Director of Lingao Ice Cream Factory, Chen Wuren?"

"Yes!" Chen Wuren responded reflexively. The term "Ice Cream Factory" was suddenly mentioned; it was strange yet familiar to him, followed by mixed feelings.
