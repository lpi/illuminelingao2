# Chapter 2772: The Capital (Part 124)

At this moment, looking at the scholar before him, he had some doubts. Could this person shoulder such a heavy responsibility?

He coughed lightly and asked: "You have always known the situation of the thieves. Since that is so, I ask you: regarding the trend of the world today, how should we deal with the Kun thieves?"

This was a question that was bound to be asked, and Qian Taichong had mentally simulated it countless times.

If it were in the past, he would inevitably have advised "痛剿" (painful extermination/severe suppression). However, after running around in the Capital these days and talking with "Mr. Le," he had changed his mind.

The Imperial Court had neither the strength nor the will to "severely suppress" the Kun thieves. A single coin could stump a hero; it was like this in Zhangzhou Bay, and it was like this in the Capital too.

Furthermore, if the Imperial Court wanted to "severely suppress," what could the Zheng family do? Their own little bit of family fortune couldn't even leave Zhangzhou Bay, and as for those relatives, it would be good enough if they didn't take the Kun thieves' money to attack them.

He immediately said: "The Kun thieves occupy Guangdong and Guangxi, and their power is gradually forming. If we want to severely suppress them in one go, the Imperial Court cannot do it without dispatching heavy ministers and mobilizing heavy troops. However, right now the troops are exhausted and provisions are lacking, so it is difficult to raise funds for a time..."

Speaking of this, he slightly lifted his eyelids to gauge the Emperor's expression. Seeing Chongzhen's expression was normal, he knew his guess was correct, so he emboldened himself to continue: "...The only way is to plan slowly."

"Oh, how to plan slowly?" the Emperor asked.

Qian Taichong immediately presented the strategy he had been thinking about for many days. The first few points, such as training troops, purging traitors, and the *Bao-Jia* system, were all clichés with nothing new. It was only when he spoke of "raising provisions" that there was something different.

"...Training troops comes down to nothing more than the word 'provisions' (pay and rations). The world is full of troubles, and it is difficult for the Court to raise provisions. However, what the Kun thieves occupy is but the land of two provinces, yet their provisions are sufficient and their troops are elite. Investigating the root cause, it is truly because they have the profit of industry and commerce!"

Chongzhen had actually heard a little bit about why the Kun thieves were so elite and wealthy, and knew that the Kun thieves "valued industry and commerce" and "slighted agriculture." But exactly what kind of heavy profit industry and commerce brought, he wasn't clear. Hearing Qian Taichong mention it, he couldn't help but become interested.

Although Chongzhen was not as greedy as his grandfather, when it came to the desire for "money," he was not inferior to his ancestor. There were simply places to spend money everywhere.

No matter how many ways they thought of to open sources and reduce expenditure, causing complaints to fill the roads of the court and the countryside, the shining silver didn't seem to increase much, while the silver spent increased day by day. Because the Ministry of Revenue's expenses had increased dramatically, the treasury was washed clean, funds were short on all sides, and the position of Minister had become a job everyone feared. Every time during a summons, as long as money was mentioned, there would be a deathly silence immediately.

"Tell me, how do these Kun thieves have the profit of industry and commerce?"

Qian Taichong immediately reported what he had seen and heard over these years one by one. In fact, the reason why the Kun thieves were so wealthy, according to Qian Taichong's understanding, was that overseas trade was developed, earning a large amount of silver from abroad every year.

That overseas trade could make money was something everyone in the Great Ming understood. But the Imperial Court hadn't obtained much direct benefit from it. The root reason was that tax administration was extremely backward.

Although there were customs duties, the tax rate was actually extremely low, and the collection methods were unscientific. With millions of taels in overseas trade value annually, the tax revenue obtained from it was very little.

Macau, this window of trade between East and West, earned hundreds of thousands of silver in revenue for Portuguese merchants every year, but what the Great Ming obtained was merely a few hundred taels of "ground rent."

Qian Taichong continued to say that the Kun thieves had a complete and precise method for overseas trade. Maritime merchants adjusted the tax extraction quota at any time according to the tightness of market demand for import and export goods. Just from customs alone, they could collect a large amount of tax revenue every year. Moreover, through maritime merchants, they could continuously purchase scarce materials from overseas.

"...The Kun thieves initially occupied Guangdong and Guangxi, and food was scarce. They immediately purchased cloth from India and rice from Siam to supply the market and stabilize prices, so the people of both places were deluded by them..."

Just earning a large amount of silver wasn't enough to explain why they were so wealthy—the real reason was something he only figured out after Mr. Le came to visit him.

That was, the large amount of silver the Kun thieves obtained from overseas trade wasn't saved up and hidden in warehouse cellars like the Zheng family or other maritime merchants, but was turned over and spent again to buy various goods from overseas.

Silver itself was not wealth; this concept was something Qian Taichong had pondered for several days before understanding.

"...Gold and silver are not wealth; they are merely equivalents for exchange. Wealth itself is still rice, grain, cloth, iron, and all kinds of people's livelihood items..."

"If the Imperial Court can open ports widely and reform customs duties, not only can it sit and collect immense silver every year, but it can also purchase military weapons and grain from overseas. Even if there is a bad harvest and insufficiency, importing a few tenths can make up for the official use, without needing additional levies and taxes, and the common people can also catch their breath. For the Roving Bandits, this is also a plan to draw fuel from under the cauldron."

"Importing rice grain from overseas?!" Chongzhen was greatly shocked. Since ancient times, he had never heard of buying grain from overseas to make up for a bad harvest. He shook his head and said, "There are millions of people within the seas; how much rice grain can a mere Siam produce? How much silver can the Imperial Court have?"

"Your Majesty does not know," Qian Taichong said, "When rice is sold in Siam, Luzon, and other places, it is only one or two mace of silver per picul (dan). Counting the water transport fees, when it arrives in Guangzhou, it is only three or four mace of silver. The Kun thieves ship as little as two thousand piculs and as many as ten thousand piculs per ship, transporting day and night in an endless stream. The Siamese and Nanyang rice imported annually is no less than a million piculs!"

Qian Taichong didn't know exactly how much rice the Kun thieves imported from overseas. The specific number was provided by Mr. Le. To be honest, he also felt it was too fantastical, but Mr. Le said this number was only an underestimation, absolutely no exaggeration.

Since he wanted the Emperor to accept his "offered strategy," speaking a bit exaggeratedly wasn't unacceptable.

Sure enough, a look of surprise and joy appeared on the Emperor's face. He muttered to himself: "Maritime trade is one, then what is the second?"

"Maritime trade is 'Commerce', the second is 'Industry'," Qian Taichong said. "The Kun thieves repeatedly win with fewer numbers, relying on nothing more than sturdy ships and sharp cannons; various Australian goods are also nothing more than ordinary items, but with a little processing, they can be sold at a premium of ten or a hundred times. This humble official sees that there are many Australian goods in the Capital. A mere box of Australian matches costs twenty or thirty *wen* (cash). This item sells for only ten *wen* in Guangzhou. Workshops sell them in bulk for only two or three *wen* per box. Like turning stone into gold, how can they not be rich?"

"Thick profit is found in nothing more than industry and commerce." Emperor Chongzhen nodded, "The words of the ancients are truly believable! It is just that what you say, sir, are all the skills of the Kun thieves..."

Qian Taichong quickly said: "This humble official is bold to offer a strategy, hoping the Emperor will forgive the sin."

"What sin do you have? Just speak freely."

"Learn the Kun's skills to expel the Kun!" Qian Taichong paved the way for a long time and finally spoke these words.

At this moment, he felt a burden lifted. He had heard people of insight in the court and the public say this sentence and similar meanings more than once, and he had chatted about similar things with the main leaders in the Zheng Sen group.

But this was only their private consensus. Whether it was Liang Cunhou, Qian Taichong, or others, they were all clear about the resistance they might encounter in the court.

"Kun skills indeed have their strengths." The Emperor nodded, thinking of the "Nanyang goods" in the palace, and asked again, "But how to 'learn' them?"

Qian Taichong saw the Emperor was interested in this and immediately used what he had just learned, rephrasing what Mr. Le had said to him back then.

"The Kun thieves value profit over righteousness. As long as there is enough profit, they are naturally willing to teach."

These days, Qian Taichong had been pondering Mr. Le's words, combining them with the conversations he had with "Know-Thief personages" like Liang Cunhou over the years and the content he read in the Kun thieves' newspapers and books to re-evaluate. Suddenly, he thought of a brand-new strategy.

This strategy was no longer simple technology introduction like running a sugar factory, but to fundamentally improve the Zheng family's situation.

If he wanted the Emperor to support the Zheng family, he had to make the Zheng family "useful" again. Merely staying in Zhangzhou Bay to run a sugar factory could only improve the economic situation of the Zheng Sen group, but could not change the situation of sitting in a besieged city.

Staying in Zhangzhou Bay, Zheng Sen would have no future. Even if the Imperial Court was willing to support the Zheng family, under the strict blockade and division of the Kun thieves, they basically couldn't become a climate, and sooner or later would be abandoned by the Emperor.

The only plan for now was to jump out of Zhangzhou Bay and seek development elsewhere.

Although the old saying was "a man away from home is cheap," in the current Zhangzhou Bay, the original branches of the Zheng group were eyeing the Young Lord like tigers, trying every possible way to seize property. Staying there would just make them a target for all.

Only by jumping out could there be new opportunities.

Originally, when Zheng Zhilong was alive, he focused on managing Taiwan. But since the Battle of Jinmen, the Zheng family business in Taiwan had been taken by the Kun thieves, so that place was not suitable for development.

"Your subject requests the Emperor to open Shanghai as a trading port, imitating the example of Guangzhou in the past," Qian Taichong petitioned.

"Open Shanghai as a port?" Chongzhen was startled.

"Yes. Now that Guangdong and Guangxi have fallen, Guangzhou has been taken by the Kun thieves. Maritime trade revenue has completely gone into their pockets. If a port is re-established in Shanghai, restoring the Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping, specifically managing foreign ship trade and collecting customs duties, the Imperial Court can obtain more than two hundred thousand taels of tax silver every year!"

"Two hundred thousand taels!" This number made the Emperor's eyebrows twitch slightly. Even for the Imperial Court, two hundred thousand taels was not a small amount. In the first year of Tianqi, Zhejiang and the Southern Zhili, the wealthiest provinces among the eighteen provinces, only transported 3.25 million taels of silver to the Capital's Great Granary; in the seventh year of Tianqi, when 370,000 taels of treasury silver were transferred from Guangdong to Beijing, the provincial treasury was emptied. A single Shanghai port could earn two hundred thousand silver just by collecting taxes from foreign merchants?!

But when Zheng Zhilong was alive, it was rumored that the shopkeepers, stewards, and assistant generals under him already had family properties of hundreds of thousands or even millions. After the Battle of Anping, the Secret Police secretly went to Fujian to investigate and said that the Kun thieves plundered "more than three million taels of silver" from Anping and other places in one go.

In this way, a tariff of two hundred thousand taels a year was not outrageous.

Seeing the Emperor was moved, Qian Taichong bragged again about the benefits of setting up a port in Shanghai: Shanghai was backed by the wealthy and bustling lands of Jiangnan, rich in products. Whether it was raw silk, silk fabrics, cotton cloth, utensils, dried and fresh fruits... they were all "hot goods" loved by foreign merchants. There was also the convenience of Yangtze River shipping; products along the Yangtze River could flow downstream and be transported to Shanghai for export.
