# Chapter 2540: Retaking Fengshenghe

Speaking to this point, Chen Lin roughly understood. In the past, the clan was a non-governmental autonomous organization. How it was managed internally, how money was distributed... the government ignored it all. The clan only needed to manage its own one-acre-three-parts of land well.

If it turned into a "Company" or the unknown-meaning "Financial Group Legal Person," that would be "passing the bright road" [becoming official/legitimate]. According to the routine of companies stipulated by Australians now, one had to register, establish accounts, and pay taxes. Finances must be public. The company from clan reform would inevitably be a so-called "Joint-stock Company," and clan members would all be shareholders. The General Manager is just a "Shopkeeper," not the "Clan Leader" or "Elder" holding great power in the past. No matter how formidable the shopkeeper is, he cannot spank shareholders or drown them in pig cages.

Seemingly a simple "Rights Confirmation and Reform," it contained countless mysteries inside.

Chen Lin said: "Australians indeed have good methods!"

"But it is also a great opportunity for us." Chen Ding whispered.

"What?"

"Registering the company..."

Chen Lin turned his brain and understood his uncle's meaning. Don't look at Second Uncle occupying the position of "Head of Case" now; actually, this position was nothing in the government, just recognized by people in the clan—besides, he couldn't even count as the Clan Leader.

If their side acted one step ahead to register the company, wouldn't they directly take back the entire clan property? Of course, things definitely weren't that simple. But now with Chen Xiaobing and two Senators backing him, and Senator Li also clearly expressing "will not intervene," as long as registration was completed, Chen Lin could "Hold the Kun to command the whole clan."

"But if we want to register a company, we must prepare all documents and deeds of the clan property. These things are all in Mr. Lu's hands—leaving aside whether he is willing to give, even if willing, registering a company still requires holding a Shareholders' Meeting."

Given Chen Xuan's current power in the village and the village militia he controlled, if this Shareholders' Meeting was held, they could still elect him as Chairman. The goal of a surprise attack could not be achieved at all.

"Registering directly is naturally not workable; we have to make a move first."

"What?"

"Fengshenghe."

Chen Lin understood. Although Fengshenghe always appeared in the guise of "Clan Property," in fact, from Grandfather starting the factory to Father taking over operation, for these decades it was actually his own family operating it. Although many clan members made a living working in the factory, and Grandfather and Father often handed profits to the clan to buy clan fields and relieve the poor—of course, Fengshenghe also received financial support from the clan when turnover was difficult—the relevant owner on all documents and deeds of this factory was the family of Chen Lin.

虽然 Second Uncle and Third Uncle were both of this branch, they were cousins to his father, not sharing the same grandfather.

"These documents and deeds of your family are more than enough to register a company. Since it is wholly owned, is there still a need to hold any Shareholders' Meeting? Once you get the license for Fengshenghe, you can directly expel Chen Xuan. Rest assured, Chief Li won't put a spoke in the wheel..."

"Why?"

"That Second Brother of mine is number one in eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. But discussing true ability to handle affairs, let alone Big Brother, he doesn't even have one percent of your ability." Chen Ding sneered, "Chief Li is not blind; can't she see even this? It's not like she hasn't dealt with you. I think she sees clearly which is lighter and which is heavier." He continued to guide his nephew, "As long as you reveal your true feelings to Chief Li, that your attitude of cooperating with the Senate won't change, Chief Li will only be happy to see it succeed and will definitely not interfere. Besides, you are handling the cotton textile factory matters now; could she still doubt your sincerity in cooperating with the Senate?"

"That is true."

"As long as you retake Fengshenghe, you can turn your hand and hold the Shareholders' Meeting for clan property disposal according to Australian requirements. This was originally the Australian decree; who dares to defy? Even if Chen Xuan still holds the position of Head of Case, he dares not oppose. He can be arrogant now, bluntly speaking, firstly because Australians back him, secondly because he controls Fengshenghe, this Golden Hen, able to buy off foreign surnames and control clan members. You snatch the silk factory; he is empty-handed. Whether Australians, foreign surnames, or Chen clan members, who will still want him?"

"That's the logic!" Chen Lin nodded excitedly saying yes.

Regarding the various documents and deeds of Fengshenghe, Chen Lin took them with him to Guangzhou when fleeing calamity back then. After returning, he quietly hid all relevant contracts in a double-walled partition in the graveyard—this was a secret only known to the eldest sons and grandsons of the upper three branches of their clan. Specially used to store important wealth and documents.

Taking out the documents, Chen Lin went to Xiangshan with his uncle. Because relevant materials were complete, they handled all formalities without trouble.

After formalities were done, he originally wanted to go straight to Chen Xuan's residence to show his hand [confront], but was stopped by Third Uncle again.

"If you go directly to show your hand, given Second Brother's style, you fear to suffer loss on the spot." Chen Ding said. "The militia in his hands are all rash youths. You going there is breaking their rice bowls. If they don't beat you half to death on the spot, maybe even taking your small life is possible..."

"Then... what to do?"

"Now you are already the owner of Fengshenghe, but the factory is not in your hands; others usurped it. Since it is so, go to Xiangshan County. The Circuit Court is coming these few days; you just go directly to sue..."

"Sue?!"

"Correct. Someone usurped your private property and refuses to withdraw; your lawsuit is reasonable and legal. At that time, once a written judgment comes down, it's not up to him not to scram!"

"But... going to the Yamen to sue is no small matter. The Yamen opens like the character 'Eight'; reasonable but moneyless, don't come in..."

"That was the Ming State times. Now Australians don't practice this rule! Do you still remember matters in Lingao?"

"Remember."

"If under Great Ming rule, even if you were an innocent person falsely accused, could you be released without spending ten-odd taels of silver once you went in?"

Being said like this by him, Chen Lin immediately drummed up courage. Nodding: "This matter is feasible. Just such a big action, do we need to ventilate with Chen Xiaobing first? Also have to let Chief Li have some mental preparation."

"You think comprehensively." Chen Ding smiled. "Chief Li already went to Guangzhou to handle affairs the day before yesterday; she won't be back for ten days or half a month. As for Comrade Chen's side, I will speak to them. You just go sue."

Chen Lin saw he had a well-thought-out plan in his chest [was confident] and couldn't help feeling a bit strange: Third Uncle's rhetoric was seamless, set after set hitting the mark... With further careful thought, he suddenly realized: no matter how smart Third Uncle was, he had only contacted Australians for a few months. Picking these laws and regulations so accurately, could it be he was possessed by an Australian?

Thinking of this, his worries completely disappeared.

After Chen Lin got all document proofs, he went quietly to Xiangshan County a few days later and filed a complaint to the Circuit Court.

The Circuit Court received Chen Lin's complaint. Evidence was conclusive, so they immediately issued a summons to Chen Xuan. Chen Xuan was still in a muddle when he was summoned to court. Seeing it was actually his nephew suing him, he jumped in thunderous rage: didn't expect this kid's respect in former days was all disguise! He wanted to rush over to "beat this rabbit cub to death" right in court. Not only did he lose the lawsuit on the spot, but he was also sentenced to 20 lashes and one week detention for "Contempt of Court."

Chen Lin got the judgment and wanted to go back to retake the factory. Unexpectedly, the court was very considerate and assigned the County Police Department to dispatch a team of police to execute.

Once the police entered the village, someone went to report in panic. Several clan elders rushed over immediately, thinking something big happened.

"Lin'er, how is it you?" A clan elder was surprised.

"Granduncle An! I also had no alternative. Third Uncle Xuan [Second Uncle Chen Xuan, refering to seniority?] has been occupying Fengshenghe. You old elderly know: since my grandfather founded and father took over operation, two generations of management, this was originally my family's private property! Since he refused to withdraw, Nephew could only ask the Australians to uphold justice." Chen Lin said.

"Sigh, sigh, although this is your family affair, it is also a family affair after all..." In the urgency, this Granduncle An didn't know what to say. "Going through officials and disturbing government... this, this, improper... improper..."

"Nephew was also forced and helpless." Chen Lin felt disdain in his heart. *Improper my ass! Why didn't you say it was improper when he seized the factory?!* He couldn't be bothered to haggle anymore, saying: "Retrieving the factory, the clan naturally has benefits. Doesn't it surpass him using this factory to raise foreign surnames now?"

The clan elders originally had complaints about Chen Xuan colluding with foreign surnames to control village administration. Now pointed out by Chen Lin to their faces, no one could refute, speechless for a time.

Chen Lin said again, "Chen Xuan is morally corrupt, seducing foreign surnames, occupying clan property. Now he roared at the court hall in court and has been stripped of the Baojia position by the County Government!" He scanned the elders of various branches from left to right. "Please, elders of each branch, go to the ancestral hall to discuss matters!"

Chen Lin assumed the tiger's might [borrowed authority]. Young disciples in the clan receiving the news also flocked over, clustering around him. For a time, no one dared to question anymore. Chen Xuan had no prestige within the clan usually; in times of danger, even fewer people were willing to stick their heads out for him. The clan elders had to make way.

Chen Lin brought the police to Fengshenghe. Mr. Lu welcomed him out, obviously stunned by the scene before him.

"This is... what is this doing?!"

"Mr. Lu, I came to take back the Fengshenghe Silk Factory." Chen Lin had thought about these words for a long time. "You just tell the workers not to worry. This is a private matter in my clan. Those working just work; they won't miss a penny of wages. Please come to work as usual tomorrow too!"

"Yes..." Mr. Lu saw several police officers coming over and pasting the court notice at the factory gate, knowing this matter was not fake. He was both surprised and appreciative. Didn't expect this Chen Lin, so young, to actually have such means! Acting low and submissive at first, flattering Chen Xuan in every way; seizing the chance to defect to Australians, climbing onto a backer, returning to the village to stand as an equal; now seizing the opportunity for a thunderous strike, crushing Chen Xuan instantly... This means, this scheming!

"Since there is a government notice, this student naturally obeys." Mr. Lu responded calmly. "Ninth Master, you were originally the Young Owner here; now it counts as returning the Jade to Zhao [returning property to original owner]."

The stance of these words was already clear. Chen Lin found it very agreeable, saying: "Mr. Lu, please maintain the situation of the factory temporarily. And these police big brothers, trouble you to entertain them with tea and water. I still have to go to the clan meeting."
