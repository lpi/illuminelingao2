# Chapter 2540: Retaking Fengshenghe

As Chen Ding explained further, Chen Lin began to grasp the situation. In the past, clans had operated as autonomous organizations beyond government oversight. How they managed their affairs internally, how money was distributed—the authorities paid no attention. A clan only needed to tend its own small domain.

But transforming into a "Company" or a "Corporate Legal Entity"—whatever that meant—would bring them into the light of official legitimacy. Under the Australian-mandated regulations, they would need to register, maintain proper accounts, and pay taxes. Financial records would become public. Any company formed from clan reform would inevitably become a joint-stock corporation, with clan members as shareholders. The General Manager would be merely a "shopkeeper," not a patriarch or elder wielding absolute authority. No matter how formidable a shopkeeper might be, he couldn't beat shareholders or drown them in pig cages.

What seemed like a simple "Rights Confirmation and Reform" concealed layers of complexity within.

"The Australians certainly know what they're doing," Chen Lin remarked.

"But it's also a tremendous opportunity for us," Chen Ding whispered.

"What do you mean?"

"Registering the company..."

Chen Lin's mind raced, and he grasped his uncle's meaning. Despite Second Uncle currently occupying the position of "Head of Case," the title held no official government recognition—it was merely acknowledged within the clan. He wasn't even truly the Clan Leader.

If their faction moved first to register the company, they could seize control of the entire clan's assets. Of course, it wouldn't be that simple. But with Chen Xiaobing and two Senators backing him, and Senator Li explicitly stating she "will not intervene," completing the registration would allow Chen Lin to command the whole clan.

"But to register a company, we need all the documents and deeds for the clan property. Those are in Mr. Lu's hands. Setting aside whether he'd be willing to hand them over—even if he were, registration still requires holding a Shareholders' Meeting."

Given Chen Xuan's current power in the village and the militia under his control, such a meeting would simply elect him as Chairman. A surprise attack would be impossible.

"Direct registration won't work, of course. We need to make another move first."

"What move?"

"Fengshenghe."

Chen Lin understood immediately. Though Fengshenghe had always operated under the guise of "clan property," the reality was different. From his grandfather founding the factory to his father taking over operations, the Chen family had run it for decades. Many clan members earned their living working there, and his grandfather and father had often contributed profits to purchase clan lands and provide relief to the poor. Fengshenghe had also received financial support from the clan during difficult times. But on every document and deed, the legal owner remained Chen Lin's family.

Although Second Uncle and Third Uncle shared his family name, they were cousins to his father—not descended from the same grandfather.

"Your family's documents are more than sufficient to register a company. Since it's wholly owned, why would you need a Shareholders' Meeting? Once you obtain the license for Fengshenghe, you can expel Chen Xuan directly. Rest assured—Chief Li won't interfere."

"Why not?"

"That Second Brother of mine excels at nothing but eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. When it comes to actual capability, he doesn't possess even a fraction of your ability—let alone matching Big Brother." Chen Ding sneered. "Chief Li isn't blind. Do you think she can't see that? She's dealt with you before. I'm certain she recognizes who's worth more." He continued guiding his nephew. "As long as you make clear to Chief Li that your commitment to cooperating with the Senate remains unchanged, she'll be happy to see this succeed and won't interfere. Besides, you're handling the cotton textile factory matters now—could she still doubt your sincerity?"

"That's true."

"Once you retake Fengshenghe, you can immediately hold a Shareholders' Meeting for clan property disposition according to Australian requirements. This follows Australian decree—who would dare defy it? Even if Chen Xuan still holds the Head of Case position, he won't dare oppose. His arrogance now stems from two things: Australian backing and control of Fengshenghe, the golden goose that lets him buy off outsiders and control clan members. Take the silk factory from him, and he has nothing. Australians, outsiders, Chen clan members—who will still want him?"

"That's the logic!" Chen Lin nodded eagerly.

When Chen Lin had fled during the troubles, he'd taken all of Fengshenghe's documents with him to Guangzhou. After returning, he had quietly hidden the contracts in a concealed compartment within a false wall at the graveyard—a secret known only to the eldest sons and grandsons of the upper three branches. It was meant specifically for storing important valuables and documents.

Retrieving the documents, Chen Lin traveled to Xiangshan with his uncle. With all the materials in order, the formalities proceeded without difficulty.

Once the paperwork was complete, he wanted to confront Chen Xuan directly at his residence, but Third Uncle stopped him again.

"If you go there now, given Second Brother's temperament, you'll likely suffer for it on the spot," Chen Ding warned. "The militia under his command are all hot-headed youths. You'd be threatening their livelihoods. If they don't beat you half to death on the spot, they might just take your life..."

"Then... what should I do?"

"You're now the legal owner of Fengshenghe, but the factory isn't in your hands—someone has seized it. Since that's the case, go to Xiangshan County. The Circuit Court convenes in the coming days. File a lawsuit."

"A lawsuit?!"

"Exactly. Someone has usurped your private property and refuses to vacate. Your case is both reasonable and legal. Once a judgment comes down, he'll have no choice but to leave."

"But... taking matters to court is no small thing. As the saying goes, 'The yamen gates open wide; with reason but no money, don't come inside...'"

"That was under Ming rule. The Australians don't follow such practices! Do you remember what happened in Lingao?"

"I remember."

"Under the Great Ming, even if you were innocent and falsely accused, could you have walked out without spending ten-odd taels of silver?"

This reasoning bolstered Chen Lin's resolve. He nodded. "This could work. But such a significant move—shouldn't we inform Chen Xiaobing first? And give Chief Li some advance warning?"

"You think thoroughly." Chen Ding smiled. "Chief Li left for Guangzhou two days ago to handle business; she won't return for ten days to half a month. As for Comrade Chen, I'll speak with them. You just file the lawsuit."

Chen Lin noticed his uncle's confident demeanor and felt a twinge of curiosity. Third Uncle's arguments were airtight, each point striking true... Upon reflection, something clicked: however clever Third Uncle might be, he'd only been in contact with the Australians for a few months. How could he navigate their laws and regulations so precisely—unless he'd been coached by one?

With that realization, his worries vanished entirely.

A few days after obtaining all the documents, Chen Lin quietly traveled to Xiangshan County and filed his complaint with the Circuit Court.

The court reviewed Chen Lin's complaint. The evidence was conclusive, so they immediately issued a summons to Chen Xuan. Still bewildered when he arrived, Chen Xuan discovered his own nephew was the plaintiff. He exploded with rage—so the boy's deference had been nothing but pretense! He tried to charge across the courtroom to "beat this rabbit cub to death." Not only did he lose the lawsuit immediately, but he was also sentenced to twenty lashes and one week's detention for contempt of court.

Chen Lin obtained the judgment and prepared to reclaim the factory. To his pleasant surprise, the court proved quite accommodating, assigning a team of police from the County Police Department to execute the order.

When the police entered the village, someone ran to spread the alarm. Several clan elders rushed over immediately, fearing something grave had occurred.

"Lin'er, is that you?" one elder exclaimed in surprise.

"Granduncle An! I had no alternative. Second Uncle Xuan has been occupying Fengshenghe all this time. You elders know the truth: my grandfather founded that factory and my father operated it—two generations of management. It was always our family's private property! Since he refused to vacate, I had no choice but to ask the Australians for justice." Chen Lin spoke with careful deference.

"Ah, well, though this is your family matter, it remains a family matter nonetheless..." In his confusion, Granduncle An struggled for words. "Involving officials, disturbing the government... this, this is improper... improper..."

"I was left with no choice." Chen Lin felt contempt rising within him. *Improper? Where was this concern for propriety when he seized the factory?* But he couldn't be bothered to argue, instead saying: "With the factory returned, the clan will naturally benefit. Surely that's better than him using it to feed outsiders now?"

The clan elders had long harbored grievances about Chen Xuan collaborating with outside surnames to control village affairs. Now that Chen Lin stated it plainly to their faces, none could offer a rebuttal. They fell silent.

"Chen Xuan is morally corrupt," Chen Lin continued. "He seduced outsiders with clan resources and seized clan property. Just now, he made an outburst in court and has been stripped of his Baojia position by the County Government!" His gaze swept across the elders of the various branches. "I ask that you all proceed to the ancestral hall to discuss these matters!"

Chen Lin wielded borrowed authority like a tiger's roar. Young men from the clan, hearing the news, came flocking to cluster around him. For the moment, no one dared question him further. Chen Xuan had never commanded respect within the clan; in this crisis, even fewer were willing to stick their necks out for him. The elders had no choice but to step aside.

Chen Lin led the police to Fengshenghe. Mr. Lu emerged to greet them, clearly stunned by the scene before him.

"What... what is the meaning of this?!"

"Mr. Lu, I've come to reclaim the Fengshenghe Silk Factory." Chen Lin had rehearsed these words many times. "Please inform the workers there's nothing to worry about. This is a private matter within my clan. Those who work will continue working—not a single coin will be missing from their wages. Please come in as usual tomorrow as well."

"I see..." Mr. Lu watched several officers approach and paste the court notice at the factory gate. He knew then this was no bluff. Both surprised and impressed, he hadn't expected someone so young to possess such cunning. Chen Lin had acted submissive at first, flattering Chen Xuan at every turn. Then he'd seized the chance to defect to the Australians, securing powerful backers, returning to the village as an equal. Now, at the opportune moment, he'd struck like thunder, crushing Chen Xuan in an instant. Such methods. Such scheming.

"Since there is a government notice, I shall naturally comply," Mr. Lu responded evenly. "Ninth Master, you were always the Young Master here. Consider this the jade returning to its rightful owner."

The meaning behind those words was clear. Chen Lin found them most agreeable. "Mr. Lu, please maintain the factory's operations for now. And these officers—if you could see to their refreshments. I must attend the clan meeting."
