# Chapter 2720: The Capital (Part 76)

Soon, they had a clear picture of Liu Sha's activities in Tongzhou.

He appeared in Tongzhou as a fortune-teller and geomancer. Reportedly quite effective, he was well-known locally. He had wide associations in Tongzhou—friends in officialdom, commerce, and the *Jianghu*.

"Fortune-telling and geomancy? Have you tested him?"

"I didn't dare show my face directly. Fortunately, his business is excellent. I listened to his words among the crowd. He's not a charlatan; he genuinely knows the 'Plum Blossom Numerology' method," Little Five said with some surprise.

Min Zhanlian said, "Not surprising. The Embroidered Uniform Guard's secret police often have a special skill up their sleeves and are well-versed in *Jianghu* tricks."

Little Five continued, saying Liu Sha had a secondary residence in Tongzhou where he kept a woman. Every time he came to Tongzhou, he stayed there.

"...This woman was originally from a musician household. Reportedly, Liu Sha spent a lot of money to make her his mistress—the house plus expenses came to no less than one thousand taels of silver. He also specifically hired an elderly couple to serve her."

Zhou Ruolan said, "This person definitely has a problem!"

Min Zhanlian nodded. Even if fortune-telling and geomancy brought in good money, keeping a mistress might not be shocking. But to take a woman from a musician household as a kept woman—that expense was not something ordinary people could afford, even if he had once served in the Brocade Guard.

Abnormal spending meant he was definitely making dirty money, or urgently needed to make more dirty money to fill a hole.

Insatiable desire. In his fifteen years in the trade, Min Zhanlian had seen countless people fall because of those words. Come to think of it, if he hadn't coveted the Nanwuliang Cult's high bounty, he wouldn't have fallen into Daoist Fu's hands.

When Liu Sha was in Tongzhou, he told fortunes at teahouses. So Little Five and his team had difficulty pinning down any specific person—the simple reason being that Liu Sha met and spoke with too many people in a day. The surveillance team couldn't possibly track and investigate everyone.

"This slippery fellow is indeed an old *Jianghu* hand," Min Zhanlian thought. Meeting contacts at teahouses, a tail could follow and investigate the people he met. But if he was telling fortunes at the same time as drinking tea, the number became countless. Moreover, both parties could exchange information by secretly passing a three-finger slip of paper.

This being the case, catching his tail in Tongzhou would be extremely difficult. Under normal circumstances, since he was working for bigwigs in the capital and only staying temporarily in Tongzhou, he would eventually return to the capital. As long as they could track his movements in the capital, they wouldn't fear not finding the big boss behind the scenes.

However, Senator Leng had now been kidnapped for over half a month with no word. Now everyone's hopes were focused on this Liu Sha. He had no time to wait for changes—he could only break through this lead as quickly as possible!

After much deliberation, Min Zhanlian decided not to wait any longer. He would directly "invite the God of Wealth" and force out the relevant intelligence. If there was news of Senator Leng's whereabouts, that would be best; if not, he would use him as bait to catch whoever came to meet him, then follow the vine to the melon.

"What if he refuses to talk even unto death?" Little Five was somewhat worried. "He's from the Brocade Guard, after all."

"Impossible." Min Zhanlian smiled. "We've been in the *Jianghu* for years. We have that much skill at least. He only *used to* serve in the Brocade Guard; he's not made of steel. Besides, apart from making him suffer, we can also give him a sweet taste. These people are all money-grubbers."

With the plan decided, Min Zhanlian immediately assigned personnel, formulated the plan, and prepared to capture him.

Unexpectedly, just as they settled on the plan, news came from Little Five.

"There's been a development with Liu Sha!"

"What?!" Min Zhanlian immediately perked up. Change meant opportunity.

"Last night, someone came to Liu Sha's house and knocked on the door. They seemed to be in a great hurry."

In this time and space, anyone with status wouldn't arrive unannounced; they would send someone ahead to coordinate and set a date. Those who showed up directly were either very close friends or had urgent business.

"What did the visitor look like?"

"A middle-aged man in his forties, dressed like a servant or attendant of a wealthy household. Travel-worn, as if he'd come from far away."

"His accent?"

"Not local, nor a capital accent. Come to think of it... it was somewhat similar to Cao Sheng's."

"That's it," Min Zhanlian said. "That's a Beizhili accent. Go on."

"After this person entered Liu's residence, he never came out." Little Five said. "Normally that wouldn't be unusual, but early this morning, the person stationed near their residence to monitor reported that Liu Sha's woman came out personally to shop. She looked panicked."

"Oh?" Min Zhanlian was immediately interested. Women rarely showed their faces in public. Though women from musician households weren't so particular, based on the surveillance over these days, at least when Liu Sha was in Tongzhou, she rarely went out. Shopping and such were handled by the elderly couple serving her.

"Coming out to shop personally was one thing, but she actually went to a lime shop!"

"A lime shop?!" Min Zhanlian's pupils contracted.

As the name suggested, a lime shop sold lime. It had only two uses: first, mixing with mortar for building walls during construction; second, placing lime packets inside coffins during funerals to absorb moisture and prevent odor.

From the outside, Liu Sha's residence showed no signs of needing repairs, and no carpenters or masons had been seen going in or out recently. Obviously, it wasn't for house repairs.

Could Liu Sha be dead?!

If he had died of sudden illness, even in a foreign place, they would have hired a local funeral establishment to hold a simple funeral before coffining the body. There was no custom of coffining immediately upon death. Besides, no coffin had been delivered—why the rush to buy lime?

"Did you ask?"

"Yes. The clerk said the lady said her house needed repairs and asked them to deliver some lime that day."

"Did she go to find masons afterward?"

"No. She bought the lime and hurried back in a panic. Since then, the main gate has been shut tight with no one coming or going. Even Liu Sha hasn't been seen."

"Tell everyone to keep watching." Min Zhanlian was quite excited. He glanced at Zhou Ruolan. "Ruolan, what do you think happened inside?"

Zhou Ruolan smiled slightly. "What else is there to say? Someone died inside! Probably splattered blood all over the wall too. I just don't know who died. My guess is the visitor who came in a hurry. Oh, and Liu Sha probably won't be able to come out to tell fortunes for a while."

"You mean Liu Sha was injured?" Little Five was somewhat skeptical.

"If he weren't injured, why would he send his woman out to handle things?" Zhou Ruolan said. "Something major must have happened. Liu Sha couldn't come out himself and didn't trust the elderly servants, so he had his woman come out."

"If injured, why not call a doctor or buy medicine for wounds?"

"Since he's from the Brocade Guard, how could he not have wound medicine on him? Besides, if they're buying lime, clearly the scene hasn't been cleaned up yet."

Min Zhanlian thought carefully. Zhou Ruolan's reasoning made sense. After a moment's thought, he said, "Very well. A long night brings many dreams. We'll go investigate tonight and see what's really going on!"

Liu Sha's residence wasn't inside Tongzhou city but in the suburb outside, near the canal wharf.

The area was near Tongzhou Granary. Most residents were clerks working in canal transport and the Tongzhou Granary—neither wealthy nor lowly. The location was convenient, quiet amid the bustle—an ideal residence for someone like Liu Sha. The compound was built of gray brick, its facade inconspicuous in the alley.

Little Five's team had been monitoring the residence 24 hours, so there was no fear of ambush. After the second watch (around 9-11 PM), Min Zhanlian's squad scaled the wall and entered. Without effort, they controlled the elderly couple in the gatehouse.

After a brief interrogation, the elderly couple stated that they were the only servants in the residence; there was no one else. "The Master and Madam" were resting in the main building.

Two men immediately climbed the pillars, nimbly getting atop the roof. One held a crossbow; the other held a blade.

The crossbow was a special ratchet compound crossbow made in Lingao, with a tension-storing spring and a built-in drum magazine holding eight short bolts. One draw could fire four shots. The four bolts were loaded in a magazine style. Though size limited its range to 25 meters, it was sufficient for urban special operations.

Little Five climbed the wall. With a toss of powder, a glistening silk thread immediately appeared behind the hanging-flower gate.

Though he couldn't see it, the other end of the thread undoubtedly had a copper bell. As soon as anyone opened the gate, the bell would sound.

He crouched on the wall, silently observing the courtyard. His night vision was excellent. Ever since he started eating from this bowl with his master, his master often bought him liver, fish, and shrimp to eat. At night, his master frequently took him out to "work," so over the years he had trained a pair of "night eyes."

By the dim light, he saw a small path along the courtyard wall. Though the sky was dark, the color had obvious variations in shade. From his experience, it was probably paved with gravel or crushed shells. Anyone stepping on it would make noise.

He gripped the wall top with both hands facing backward, silently descending along the wall, touching the ground only with his toes. Once his body was steady, he edged along the wall bit by bit to the hanging-flower gate, found the copper bell, gripped the clapper, and cut the thread.

From the all-purpose pouch at his waist, he took out a small bottle and quickly applied oil to the door bolt and hinges to prevent squeaking when opened. Only then did he open the hanging-flower gate and let the others file through.

In the courtyard, the main building had a lamp burning like a bean. The air carried the scent of medicine.

His subordinates were about to rush into the main building when Min Zhanlian raised his hand to pause. He signaled everyone to guard the side wing doors and windows. After a moment, Min Zhanlian threw a stone toward the veranda of the main building.

At this hour, all was silent. The stone striking below the steps made quite a loud sound. From inside the main building came a woman's trembling voice: "Who's there?!"

At that moment, the three team members guarding the west wing door had already smashed through the door and windows, charging in like pouncing tigers. In no time, two bamboo whistle blasts sounded from the west wing: Got them!

Immediately, other team members burst into the main building and the east wing.

Two whistle blasts from the main building, but only one from the east wing.

By prior agreement, two blasts meant enemy captured; one blast meant no one.

Min Zhanlian didn't move, still maintaining vigilance. After a moment, a single whistle blast came from the back courtyard direction. Only then did he exhale softly. He said in a low voice, "Move!"
