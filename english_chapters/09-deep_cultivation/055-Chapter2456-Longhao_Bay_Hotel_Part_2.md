# Chapter 2456 - Longhao Bay Hotel (Part 2)

The Senate's power industry had always been a weak link. Due to the inability to produce qualified silicon steel sheets for a long time, the big shots in the power sector finally decided to use pure iron for generator rotors. although the magnetic loss was relatively large, at least it could generate electricity normally.

As for the power, steam engines were used. Under the Senate's industrial system, they could already stably manufacture multi-expansion high-horsepower steam engines. Although there were still certain stability and safety issues with compact marine and vehicle steam engines, large horizontal slow-speed steam engines used for power stations and power plants could roughly meet the demand.

Due to too many technical difficulties in transmission and distribution, plus the prominent contradiction between power consumption and power supply and excessive peak fluctuations, the Bopu-Bairen power grid erected in the early days was declared completely disintegrated. By 1637, self-provided power stations had become the mainstream mode of Lingao's power. Except for Bairen City and East Gate Market which were powered by the Bairen Hydropower Station, major towns like Bopu, Ma'ao, Nanbao, Xinying, and Old Town all adopted the mode of self-provided steam thermal power stations by power-consuming units. Some large power consumers, such as chemical plants and smelters, even had to be equipped with factory-owned power stations.

Naturally, under this power usage mode, the power industry could basically only meet part of the industrial and administrative power needs. Civilian power usage was very little. Except for the Senate's residential area and the residences of a few high-ranking naturalized cadres and technical personnel, most residents still relied on kerosene lamps and candles for lighting at home; public facilities, shops, and road lighting mostly used gas lamps. Only in a few special places with fire prevention needs would electric lighting be used.

So the sensational effect of the "All-Electric Configuration" of Longhao Bay Hotel could be imagined. For this reason, Longhao Bay Hotel built a self-provided power station. The power equipment was the locomobile system brought from the old timeline back then, driving Lingao-produced generators to generate electricity. Although the power was not high, it was more than enough to supply the hotel, and the surplus electricity could even be provided to nearby units such as Lingao Cape Park.

This power station and related supporting electrical equipment were the largest investment items of the entire Longhao Bay Hotel apart from the civil engineering of the building.

In addition to the power station, Longhao Bay Hotel also created quite a few "firsts." For example, it was the first non-Senate investment project to use a reinforced concrete structure overall frame building. After all, many administrative buildings in the Old Town Administrative District were still brick-wood structures or brick-concrete structures.

Although Elder Hong did not appear on the shareholder list, he provided full software support and guidance for "Longhao Bay Hotel." At the same time, after reporting to the Senate for approval, a branch of Shop No. 82 was opened on the first floor of Longhao Bay Hotel, specifically catering to natives and naturalized citizens. In addition, there were rumors that Wu Nanhai's wife, Wu Chuqing, also provided some support and held shares, and so on.

Under Elder Hong's guidance, Longhao Bay Hotel's business was booming after opening, with matchless momentum. Even the Bairen City Commercial Hall Hotel directly managed by the Ministry of Commerce was lonely for a while. If not for the two major selling points of the Commercial Hall's "political status" and "authentic Australian cuisine," Li Mei's face would probably have become very ugly.

The Venus Zero rickshaw team drove mightily into the hotel entrance and stopped under the rain porch. Everyone got off the cars, and doormen came to greet them early. The attire of these doormen was neither "Ming style" nor the "imitation military uniform" style of the old timeline, but the attire of the traditional old service industry: white stand-collar jacket, black trousers, cloth shoes on feet, clean and sharp.

The inspection group passed through the bronze-framed glass revolving door and came to the lobby. The lobby was a three-story high style. painted on the dome was a huge ceiling painting "From the Sea": in huge waves, the Holy Ship was held up by a group of naked young men and women. The skin texture was lifelike; the Chen siblings blushed at a glance and dared not look again. The middle-aged and elderly greasy men of the inspection group watched with relish and exclaimed from time to time: "This lamp is really bright!"

The lamp they spoke of was the one large and two small multi-layered chandelier crystal glass lamps hanging in the center of the lobby. With the addition of electric lights, they were brilliantly radiant and dazzling. Anyone coming to the hotel for the first time would hold their breath and watch for a good while.

The floor of the lobby was paved with Hainan black volcanic rock slabs produced in Hainan. The wooden structure parts all used Burmese teak, and the lobby was embellished with fresh flowers and green plants everywhere. Directly facing the revolving door was a giant red sandalwood carved screen, on which a huge landscape painting "Spring Dawn at Piye" was painted: a red sun was rising from Piye Mountain, the mountains and below were lush with trees, a hundred flowers were blooming, and the Wenlan River meandered in the distance. It was truly majestic.

Just after a few glances, Wu Yijun thought to himself: *Indeed, there is a heart of disobedience!* However, he immediately corrected himself: *This is the atmosphere of founding a nation!*

On both sides of the screen, a curved marble staircase connected upward to the second floor. Lifelike stone statues stood at the ends of the staircase handrails.

Chen Xiaobing let them sit on the sofas in the lobby while he went to the front desk to handle check-in procedures.

Chen Lin sat on the sofa, feeling novel about everything around him. Truth be told, he had been to the Great World in Guangzhou, seen many Australian gadgets, and read many "magazines" and newspapers, so he wasn't some "country bumpkin." But at this moment, deep in the "belly and heart land" of the Kun thieves, the "capital" of a nation... From entering the port, he felt a completely different atmosphere. This huge difference was reflected not only in various "machines" or "facilities" but in the humanities. Of course, Chen Lin did not understand the word "humanities," but everything he saw along the way, whether "things" or "people," was distinct from Guangzhou.

Guangzhou naturally also had Elders and naturalized cadres. But having been in Guangzhou for a long time, they somewhat still had the aura of the old era he was familiar with, while here, everything was brand new. Being in it, he was completely an "outsider."

This feeling made him uneasy. Looking at his sister, she was even more restless. No wonder. Growing up, although she wasn't a pampered daughter raised in deep boudoirs who never stepped out the main or second gate, she had never had the experience of traveling far with a group of men. He wanted to care for her with a few words, but thinking that although Chen Yue was his sister, there was a distinction between men and women after all, and expressing concern publicly in public was too frivolous.

However, he soon saw even more frivolous scenes. Men and women mixed together, laughing and joking as they passed, and there were even young women holding men's arms! Then he saw a pair of young men and women, still wearing old Ming costumes, but the man had his arm directly around the woman's shoulder, and the woman's head leaned on the man's shoulder, openly coming down the stairs laughing. Although Chen Lin was not a strictly moralist disciple, he was somewhat unused to seeing this. Afraid Chen Yue would be influenced, he pulled a long face and whispered to his sister: "Don't look around randomly!"

Chen Yue hurriedly lowered her head, just staring at her toes in a daze.

Wu Yijun smiled without speaking, thinking *this cousin-nephew has quite the 'aristocratic family' style.* Pity the Great Ming is gone, and the Senate likes this tone? What can you do! Only by following the trend closely will one not be swallowed by the waves! Preserving the continuation of the family. This Chen uncle and nephew both have some stubborn tempers.

Chen Xiaobing came back after finishing the procedures, holding a large bunch of key tags in his hand.

"Everyone, I'll distribute the key tags here. Your rooms are on the third and fourth floors. You can take the elevator or walk up the stairs in a while." Chen Xiaobing said, "Everyone can rest in the room. The restaurant is on the second floor. Whether for breakfast or lunch, you can consume with the key tag. You can also walk around the surroundings, but don't go too far. At six o'clock in the evening, the Planning Committee Chief will host a banquet for you."

"Comrade Chen, your arrangement is too thoughtful." Shen Changxi flattered, "We all feel sorry..."

"Never mind, never mind, this is all my job duty." Chen Xiaobing was natural and poised, and exhorted again, "There is a facility manual in the room. If you don't understand, you can ask the attendants—there are some on every floor. Only I have to exhort everyone: since you are nationals of the Great Song, you must abide by the law. You didn't come from Ming territory either; you understand the statutes of the Senate somewhat..."

"Understood, understood, we are clear!"

Chen Xiaobing finished his exhortations and left. The inspection group was relieved. Bumping along the way, they finally arrived at the place, and looking at the appearance of this inn, the Australian-style enjoyment must be the peak of perfection.

At that moment, everyone took their key tags and dispersed, each returning to their room. Wu Yijun and the Chen uncle and nephew's rooms were all on the third floor. The group took the elevator upstairs. When the grille gate closed, they felt quite funny—weren't they becoming beasts in a cage?

They saw the elevator operator pull the lever; the machine overhead roared, the cage box shook violently, and then slowly rose. Although everyone knew the use of the elevator, they still exclaimed in unison.

Wu Yijun said: "If the Great World could install one too, wouldn't it be better!"

"In my opinion, install one at the Zhenhai Tower too! My legs are bad; every time I get downstairs, I can only sigh at the tower!"

"What nonsense are you talking! Is it the Tanhai Tower (Sea Exploring Tower)! Tanhai Tower." Liang Chenlong said righteously.

"Yes, yes, I am confused." The person hurriedly put on an appearance of "old and useless."

Wu Yijun's room was 313. Opening the door, it was a north-facing "Sea View Room." The large glass window was clear without obstruction, giving a panoramic view of Longhao Bay. Because the weather was extremely good today, he could see the Leizhou Peninsula across the strait directly.

"Truly a peerless beautiful view." Wu Yijun sighed. "On the word enjoyment, the Australians have reached the peak of perfection." Seeing a pair of rattan rocking chairs in front of the window, he couldn't help sitting on one immediately, shaking his body slowly, with an expression of enjoyment on his face. Suddenly he seemed to remember something and called out:

"Yongshou!"

Yongshou was his personal manservant, who was currently moving the delivered luggage into the room from the corridor. Hearing the master's summons, he hurriedly replied: "Master!"

"Go run the water in the washroom. Master wants to bathe and change clothes."

"Yes, Master!"
