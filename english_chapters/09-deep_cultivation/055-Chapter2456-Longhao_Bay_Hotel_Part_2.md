# Chapter 2456 - Longhao Bay Hotel (Part 2)

The Senate's power industry had always been a weak link. Unable to produce qualified silicon steel sheets for a long time, the power sector big shots had finally decided to use pure iron for generator rotors. Though magnetic loss was greater, at least it could generate electricity normally.

For motive power, steam engines were used. Under the Senate's industrial system, they could now manufacture multi-expansion high-horsepower steam engines reliably. Compact marine and vehicle steam engines still had stability and safety issues, but large horizontal slow-speed steam engines for power stations and plants could roughly meet demand.

Due to numerous difficulties in transmission and distribution, plus the pronounced contradiction between power consumption and supply and excessive peak fluctuations, the Bopu-Bairen power grid erected in the early days had completely disintegrated. By 1637, self-provided power stations had become Lingao's mainstream mode of electrification. Except for Bairen City and East Gate Market, which were powered by the Bairen Hydropower Station, major towns like Bopu, Ma'ao, Nanbao, Xinying, and Old Town all adopted self-provided steam thermal power stations operated by power-consuming units. Some large consumers, such as chemical plants and smelters, even required factory-owned power stations.

Under this mode, the power industry could basically only meet some industrial and administrative needs. Civilian power usage was minimal. Except for the Senate's residential area and residences of a few high-ranking naturalized cadres and technical personnel, most residents still relied on kerosene lamps and candles for home lighting. Public facilities, shops, and road lighting mostly used gas lamps. Only special locations with fire prevention needs used electric lighting.

So the sensational effect of Longhao Bay Hotel's "All-Electric Configuration" could be imagined. For this purpose, the hotel had built its own power station. The power equipment was a locomobile system brought from the old timeline, driving Lingao-produced generators. Though power output wasn't high, it was more than sufficient for the hotel, with surplus electricity even supplied to nearby units like Lingao Cape Park.

This power station and related electrical equipment represented the largest investment item of the entire Longhao Bay Hotel after the building's civil engineering.

Beyond the power station, Longhao Bay Hotel had created quite a few "firsts." For example, it was the first non-Senate investment project to use a reinforced concrete overall frame structure—many administrative buildings in the Old Town Administrative District were still brick-wood or brick-concrete construction.

Though Elder Hong didn't appear on the shareholder list, he had provided full software support and guidance for the hotel. Simultaneously, after reporting to the Senate for approval, a branch of Shop No. 82 had opened on the first floor, specifically catering to natives and naturalized citizens. Additionally, rumors held that Wu Nanhai's wife, Wu Chuqing, had also provided support and held shares.

Under Elder Hong's guidance, Longhao Bay Hotel's business boomed after opening, its momentum unmatched. Even the Commercial Hall Hotel in Bairen City, directly managed by the Ministry of Commerce, suffered a period of loneliness. If not for the Commercial Hall's two major selling points—"political status" and "authentic Australian cuisine"—Li Mei's face would probably have grown quite sour.

The Venus Zero rickshaw team drove impressively into the hotel entrance and stopped beneath the rain canopy. Everyone alighted, and doormen came forward to greet them. Their attire was neither "Ming style" nor the "imitation military uniform" style of the old timeline, but the traditional old service industry look: white stand-collar jacket, black trousers, cloth shoes—clean and sharp.

The inspection group passed through the bronze-framed glass revolving door into the lobby. The lobby soared three stories high. Painted on the dome was a huge ceiling fresco, "From the Sea": amid massive waves, the Holy Ship was borne aloft by a group of naked young men and women. The skin textures were lifelike. The Chen siblings blushed at a glance and dared not look again. The middle-aged and elderly men of the inspection group gazed with relish, exclaiming from time to time: "These lamps are really bright!"

The "lamps" they spoke of were one large and two small multi-layered chandelier crystal glass fixtures hanging at the lobby's center. With electric lights added, they radiated brilliance dazzlingly. Anyone visiting the hotel for the first time would hold their breath and stare for quite a while.

The lobby floor was paved with Hainan black volcanic rock slabs. The wooden structural elements all used Burmese teak, and fresh flowers and green plants embellished the space throughout. Directly facing the revolving door stood a giant red sandalwood carved screen, bearing a huge landscape painting, "Spring Dawn at Piye": a red sun rising from Piye Mountain, lush trees covering the peaks and slopes below, a hundred flowers blooming, and the Wenlan River meandering in the distance. Truly majestic.

After just a few glances, Wu Yijun thought to himself: *Indeed, the heart of a dynasty-founder!* But he immediately corrected himself: *This is the atmosphere of founding a nation!*

On both sides of the screen, curved marble staircases swept upward to the second floor. Lifelike stone statues stood at the ends of the staircase handrails.

Chen Xiaobing had them sit on sofas in the lobby while he went to the front desk to handle check-in procedures.

Chen Lin sat on the sofa, finding everything around him novel. He had been to the Great World in Guangzhou, seen many Australian gadgets, and read numerous "magazines" and newspapers—he was no "country bumpkin." But here, deep in the "belly and heartland" of the Kun thieves, the "capital" of a nation... From the moment he'd entered the port, he'd sensed a completely different atmosphere. This huge difference was reflected not only in various "machines" or "facilities" but in the culture itself. Of course, Chen Lin didn't know the word "culture," but everything he'd seen along the way—whether "things" or "people"—was distinct from Guangzhou.

Guangzhou naturally had Elders and naturalized cadres too. But those who'd been in Guangzhou long enough still retained the aura of the old era he knew. Here, everything was brand new. Standing in the midst of it, he felt completely like an "outsider."

This feeling unsettled him. Looking at his sister, she seemed even more restless. And no wonder—though she wasn't a pampered daughter raised in deep boudoirs who never stepped out the gate, she'd never had the experience of traveling far among a group of men. He wanted to comfort her, but though Chen Yue was his sister, there was still a distinction between men and women. Expressing concern publicly would seem too familiar.

But soon he witnessed even more familiar behavior. Men and women mixed together, laughing and joking as they passed, and there were even young women holding men's arms! Then he saw a pair of young people, still wearing old Ming dress, but the man had his arm directly around the woman's shoulder, and she leaned her head against his shoulder as they came down the stairs laughing openly. Though Chen Lin was no strict moralist, he wasn't used to seeing this. Afraid his sister might be influenced, he pulled a long face and whispered to her: "Don't look around randomly!"

Chen Yue hurriedly lowered her head, staring at her toes in a daze.

Wu Yijun smiled without speaking, thinking *this cousin-nephew has quite the 'aristocratic family' manner.* Pity the Great Ming was gone—and the Senate favored this tone. What could you do? Only by following the trend closely would one avoid being swallowed by the waves, preserving the family's continuation. This Chen uncle and nephew both had stubborn streaks.

Chen Xiaobing returned after finishing the procedures, holding a large bunch of key tags.

"Everyone, I'll distribute the key tags here. Your rooms are on the third and fourth floors. You can take the elevator or walk up the stairs. Please rest in your rooms. The restaurant is on the second floor—for breakfast or lunch, you can pay with your key tag. You can also walk around the surroundings, but don't go too far. At six o'clock this evening, the Planning Committee Chief will host a banquet for you."

"Comrade Chen, your arrangement is too thoughtful," Shen Changxi flattered. "We feel so sorry for the trouble..."

"Not at all—this is all my duty." Chen Xiaobing was natural and composed. He added one more reminder: "Since you're nationals of the Great Song, you must abide by the law. You didn't come from Ming territory anyway; you know something of the Senate's statutes..."

"Understood, understood! We're quite clear!"

Chen Xiaobing finished his instructions and departed. The inspection group felt relieved. After the long journey, they'd finally arrived, and from the look of this inn, Australian-style comforts awaited in full.

Everyone took their key tags and dispersed to their rooms. Wu Yijun and the Chen uncle and nephew's rooms were all on the third floor. The group took the elevator up. When the grille gate closed, they felt rather amused—weren't they becoming beasts in a cage?

They watched the elevator operator pull the lever. The machine overhead roared, the cage box shook violently, then began rising slowly. Though everyone knew what an elevator was, they still exclaimed in unison.

"If Great World could install one too, wouldn't it be wonderful!" Wu Yijun said.

"In my opinion, install one at Zhenhai Tower too! My legs are bad—every time I go downstairs, I can only sigh at the tower!"

"What nonsense are you talking! It's *Tanhai* Tower! Tanhai Tower," Liang Chenlong corrected righteously.

"Yes, yes, I'm confused," the man hastily put on an appearance of "old and useless."

Wu Yijun's room was 313. Opening the door, he found a north-facing "Sea View Room." The large glass window was clear and unobstructed, offering a panoramic view of Longhao Bay. The weather was exceptionally fine today—he could see the Leizhou Peninsula directly across the strait.

"Truly a peerless view." Wu Yijun sighed. "When it comes to enjoyment, the Australians have reached the peak of perfection." Seeing a pair of rattan rocking chairs before the window, he sat down immediately, swaying gently, an expression of pleasure on his face. Suddenly he seemed to remember something and called out:

"Yongshou!"

Yongshou was his personal manservant, currently moving the delivered luggage into the room from the corridor. Hearing his master's summons, he hurried over. "Master!"

"Run the water in the washroom. Master wants to bathe and change clothes."

"Yes, Master!"
