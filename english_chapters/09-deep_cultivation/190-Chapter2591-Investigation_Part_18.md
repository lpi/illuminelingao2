# Chapter 2591 - Investigation (Part 18)

Though the weather in Guangzhou at this time was still pleasant, the air in every office of the inspection team's unit building was stifling. A crowd squeezed together, sighing and scratching their heads from time to time.

Mountains of ledgers and documents, rain-like clatter of abacus beads, and the whirring of hand-cranked calculators added to the irritation.

Several dozen accountants and auditors squeezed into these offices, reviewing all documents and ledgers in three shifts around the clock.

Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital hadn't been open many years, but the accumulated archives were truly substantial. Before the Lingao Pharmaceutical Company was established, it had also handled Lingao drug wholesale and retail. This business started the day Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital opened—when it was still Ming territory. The hospital's drug sales had once been the health sector's largest revenue source. Only after the State Council required separating medicine from medical care and established Lingao Pharmaceuticals as general agent did Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital stop its drug sales business—this was already after Guangzhou's liberation.

One could imagine how many accounts had accumulated over these years. Moreover, early ledger registration and filing wasn't standardized. Some ledgers had abbreviated dates—determining the specific year required investigation to clarify.

"Ah, my blood pressure's rising." A young woman vigorously scratched her hair. Naturalized citizen cadres now often used catchphrases the Elders had brought—though sometimes not quite fitting.

"No worries, no worries. You've got plenty of hair. Don't worry about going bald."

...

Zheng Mingjiang held a summary meeting every day, with each team reporting current progress and findings. From the portions audited so far, only Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital barely passed—like some university exams graded to exactly 60 points, not half a point more or less.

The first problem the inspection team faced was deciphering so-called "doctor's handwriting." Though Lingao's medical education was limited, it had emphasized from the start that archive writing be legible. Ugly handwriting was fine, but it had to be clear.

In the old timeline, Lin Qiaozhi's medical record writing was very clear. However, under heavy work pressure, doctors grew accustomed to using cursive, shorthand symbols, and such to reduce their burden. Over time, it became hard to recognize.

Senate-governed hospitals had also absorbed some physicians who'd first received traditional medical education before modern medical education. Some retained traditional medical habits, forcibly giving medicines alternative names to increase prescription confidentiality. Others, with traditional education backgrounds, would deliberately show off with cursive calligraphy. Of course, not all doctor's handwriting was synonymous with arcane scripture—Fu Shan, for example, was also a calligrapher. Unfortunately, he hadn't yet come under the Senate's wing.

To solve the handwriting identification problem, Zheng Mingjiang borrowed licensed pharmacists from Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital's pharmacy department to assist with the inspection—part guessing, part deciphering.

Secondly, most naturalized citizens didn't have "quality systems" as a concept in their minds. This required the subtle education of an industrialized society—achieved over time, not overnight. Even though schools and teaching Elders repeatedly emphasized it, naturalized citizens instinctively felt it was "troublesome." The Senate's factories had taught naturalized citizens what "following work instructions" meant only through multiple bloody accidents. Therefore, most ledgers couldn't reach the stage of verifying details—because they had no details at all. A large portion of medical records, prescriptions, and accounts were obviously hastily created after Zheng Mingjiang announced the audit—holding almost no inspection value.

"All of these will be processed as untraceable, lacking original records, and document fraud." Zheng Mingjiang wanted to give the naturalized citizens a deep lesson.

The team members' main complaints were that currently, various archives universally contained contradictory content, confused logic, and incomprehensible entries. But their job wasn't simply to determine non-compliance and point out problems—they had to sift through and find valuable leads to guide the case's resolution.

Yet reality was that the massive data was like a tangled ball of thread, making it difficult to find an end to unravel. In the old timeline, there were various statistical tools to use—analysis tools could quickly identify suspicious points. But the Senate couldn't even provide naturalized citizens with the simplest Excel. Manual calculation undoubtedly increased the audit's difficulty.

Analyze, record suspicious points, analyze, record leads... After this process, the already mountainous archives generated even more archives. Human brains, unlike computers, couldn't conduct linked analysis or remember all details—they relied entirely on daily meetings for communication and analysis. Low efficiency was understandable.

Though the audit situation wasn't clear, Zheng Mingjiang wasn't too worried. The health sector hadn't conducted such thorough, systematic audits before—the opponent's forgery methods were necessarily crude, perhaps not even knowing how to forge. Problems could be easily found.

Once they'd been audited more often, they'd prepare ledgers meticulously according to audit regulations and accounting rules. Then you'd find submitted materials were compliant everywhere—yet everywhere revealed strangeness. To uncover the truth, you could only keep extending audits, expanding investigation scope. Sometimes you'd clearly sense the other party had problems but couldn't find evidence, only watching them slip away.

Ultimately, the current apparent chaos and confusion actually meant the opponent had flaws everywhere. Once the mess was sorted out, exposed weaknesses could be immediately seized.

After several consecutive days of work, Zheng Mingjiang assigned the next work focus: "First, prioritize verifying prescription issuance times, pharmacy dispensing times, and Lingao shipping times—see if there's any connection. Second, verify total requested drugs, total received drugs, total dispensed drugs, compared against Lingao's total shipped drugs—see the gaps. Third, verify whether any non-Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital prescription forms are mixed among prescriptions. The third point especially—everyone must verify carefully!"

The first two points had already uncovered many problems and leads, but they were too jumbled. Some weren't necessarily corruption—purely inadequate management system implementation. With time passed, there was no way to investigate thoroughly. But the third point was clear-cut cheating. As long as outside hospital prescriptions were found mixed among Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital prescriptions, it proved deliberate fraud. Through prescription issuers and prescription flows, the related chain could be excavated.

Through the auditors' tireless efforts, after several weeks of sorting, Cheka finally produced an audit issues summary report—plus a thick "problem list" bound into fifteen volumes.

"Medical record, prescription, and accounting management is chaotic with no mutual correspondence. Late bookkeeping and account-physical discrepancies are common problems. The responsible personnel themselves don't know where things went. Such loopholes are easily discovered and exploited by others.

"Combined with this batch of allocated drugs' distribution, we inspected relevant accounts in departments and pharmacy, discovering many problems. For example, in warehouse entry registration and receipt counterfoils, relevant item numbers, batch numbers, and quantities don't correspond to actual warehouse items—some are even left blank. These drugs simply don't exist in hospital accounts. Also, within the hospital, after drugs are received, they're not registered, causing drugs that exist on paper to actually not exist. Additionally, after drugs are received and registered, they're returned to the pharmacy department but not re-registered for storage.

"Some patients frequently admitted, with large drug quantities prescribed far exceeding recommended dosages and treatment cycles in diagnostic guidelines—yet no consultation records exist. Some patients' names are blurry and hard to recognize; registered addresses can't be verified; some don't even exist in household registration archives. Hospitalized patients exceed bed numbers; outpatient numbers far exceed registration numbers; prescription dates don't match doctors' duty schedules—some even during leave or external training periods."

Though manual bookkeeping inevitably produces chaos, currently audited problems already exceeded normal tolerance ranges.

Zheng Mingjiang expected all this. It seemed shocking, but wasn't valuable for solving the current drug case—only useful as future improvement directions.

The truly valuable content came later: among prescription forms retained in the pharmacy, large numbers of outside-hospital prescriptions had indeed appeared.

These outside-hospital prescriptions were enormous in quantity. Just what auditors had currently sorted totaled over a thousand forms. A complete thorough sorting would find even more. But this number alone was enough to astonish Zheng Mingjiang.

These prescription forms, aside from different serial numbers, were identical to Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital forms. Without specifically comparing serial number stubs, no one would discover these prescription forms had any problems—they were all genuine, just shouldn't have been here.

The drugs the pharmacy dispensed according to these prescription forms were undoubtedly part of those leaked drugs. A rough tally showed the "genuine fake prescriptions" had extracted about thirty percent of antibiotics, twenty-five percent of opiate-containing drugs, and eighteen percent of other drugs from Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital's pharmacy.

No wonder Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital was among the top three drug users yet constantly had drug shortage problems—even Lin Motian was stingy when prescribing. One-third of antibiotics hadn't been used clinically at all! Zheng Mingjiang thought—our internal management system really did have significant loopholes!

These prescription forms had an obvious loophole. Though serial numbers differentiated each medical institution, in actual operation, manual dispensing and bookkeeping couldn't identify this. It required computers and networks. Apparently, in the future, they'd need to adopt some old methods—printing the relevant medical institution's name directly on prescription forms, making it clear at a glance.

Even Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, with an Elder in residence and the strictest management system, was like this. Other institutions' conditions could be imagined.
