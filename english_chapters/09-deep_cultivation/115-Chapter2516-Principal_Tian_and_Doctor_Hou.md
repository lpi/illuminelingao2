# Chapter 2516: Principal Tian and Doctor Hou

Although Tanka people are now allowed to live on shore, they basically belong to the destitute class and cannot afford to build decent dwellings. Therefore, most choose to build wooden sheds and live together on the river tidal flats and "sea skin" (foreshore) near market towns. To solve this problem, the Senate specially passed relevant legal documents, allocating these "state-owned lands" to various newly built Tanka villages in the name of "village collective land." Explicitly defining the four boundaries and occupied area of each village. This is also to prevent phenomenon of disputing land and wrangling in the future.

Tanka people's wooden sheds basically use bamboo and wood as frames, bamboo fences and reed mats as walls, thatch as roofs. Floors and beds are all woven from bamboo strips, leaking wind and light on all four sides. Small ones can only accommodate a body; large ones can hold no more than two beds. All are stilt-style hanging houses.

Kuang Lu and his servant followed Zeng Salmon into the village. Looking all the way, these "houses" were not even as good as the pigsties in his family's rural manor. But for the Tanka households, owning their own houses made them feel extremely proud.

Many fake Kun came to the village today, very lively. The people called "Principal Tian" and "Doctor Hou" were a man and a woman, looking only in their twenties, preaching policy to the villagers. Coming with them were about ten other fake Kun. Some looked like artisans, some like doctors. As for the other fake Kun, Kuang Lu couldn't tell for the moment. But they all wore uniform blue cloth short jackets and carried satchels.

The one called Principal Tian was actually a young man. He spoke with full *qi*, had a strong and martial physique, looking not like a scholar but like a martial artist. Even his expression was a bit clumsy/dull.

*Such a person is also a "Principal"?* Kuang Lu felt surprised.

"Folks, the Chief newly built National Schools in both Guangzhou and Dali, giving our village five public expense study quotas. In the past two years, we have always had literacy work teams going to various villages to eliminate illiteracy. The children in the village have recognized quite a few characters. The Senate's rule is mandatory examination for entry, so we want to organize an exam in the village. The child with the best exam score can get a quota for the Boys' National Demonstration School. The next four in ranking can go to Dali National Primary School to study..."

"Principal Tian, what does public expense study quota mean?" someone among the villagers asked.

"Public expense means tuition for studying is waived. Excellent grades can even get scholarships," Principal Tian explained.

Another villager asked: "What about money for food, clothing, and usage?"

"This... the scholarships given by the Chiefs are sufficient. As long as grades are good, none of it is a problem." Principal Tian knew the villagers were all very poor. Children were half a labor force to them. Asking any family to raise a fully disengaged child to study was actually somewhat difficult.

"What if grades are not good?"

"Can still... apply for student loans, interest-free," Principal Tian said less decisively.

"Loan", although a new word, everyone knew it was taking on debt. Although this was "official debt" and interest-free, it was still a debt in the end.

The villagers listened and started whispering. It seemed everyone's desire to send children to study wasn't that strong. This "Principal Tian" mobilized non-stop, saying the benefits of reading, but with little effect.

On the other side, although Doctor Hou was a woman, she was leading two artisan fake Kun looking at the blueprint in hand. Directing villagers to dig pits on one side, directing villagers to move fire bricks from boats on the other, and also directing the little doctors traveling together to treat villagers' illnesses. A heroine among women.

"What is this doing?" Kuang Lu was interested in the pit the fake Kun were digging and asked Zeng Salmon.

"A few days ago the County Parent issued a notice, saying public toilets are to be built in these new fishing villages of ours. *Sigh*, the Chiefs are good in everything, just managing heaven above, managing earth below, and in the middle also managing... anyway, shitting and pissing all must be managed," Zeng Salmon answered. He didn't quite understand either. Previously shitting and pissing were solved anywhere, going directly into the river.

Kuang Lu pondered slightly and understood the Kun thieves' intention immediately. Shit and piss were indeed filthy and smelly, but it didn't represent garbage that could be discarded at will. quite the opposite, Guangzhou city historically had numerous big and small manure tyrants controlling manure routes. From collection to sales, every link had profit eaters. It's just heard that these big and small manure tyrants had now mostly suffered the black hand of the Kun thieves. This benefit also went to the Kun thieves.

It could be seen that the toilet location was not arranged at will, but selected in a higher terrain place to prevent being submerged when water rose. It looked like it was to avoid losing fertilizer. Kun thieves claimed to build the state with industry and commerce; everything couldn't escape a "profit" character.

What puzzled him was that a dry latrine only required digging a pit. Didn't need fake Kun to make such a big formation. The pit seemed to be dug particularly long, and so many fire bricks were transported. The cost of this latrine was not generally small. Kuang Lu simply stayed to look at what medicine the Kun thieves were selling in the gourd.

Doctor Hou was exhorting a young man about something. Her thin and small stature appeared somewhat weak against the man's strong physique. But the young man was submissive and very respectful. This scene shocked Kuang Lu greatly. According to Zeng Salmon, the young man was named He Lizhi, also a Tanka household. Later he learned some medical skills with the Senate's mobile medical team and became a barefoot doctor. It was he (Zeng) who recommended He Lizhi to be village head. The villagers had no objections either.

Pearl River Tanka households were all under the jurisdiction of the River Anchor Office (*Hebo Suo*) under Ming rule. After going ashore, they established a new village management model according to the Senate's requirements. Tanka New Village residents were all scattered households, unlike people on shore having clan systems. Within a village on shore, most were of a single surname, at most two or three surnames. Everything had Clan Sons and Clan Elders to decide. In this era, knowing a skill everyone needed made it easy to become an authority.

"This kind of three-compartment septic tank toilet is mainly used to intercept parasite eggs in feces. You learned some medical skills in the mobile medical team; remember how feces transmit parasites, right?" Doctor Hou asked He Lizhi.

"Remember, remember," He Lizhi answered. "Parasites are some worms hiding inside the human body, sucking human nutrition, also making people sick. Some worms hide in intestines and also lay many very small eggs. Eggs laid get discharged with stool. If other people contact these feces, they might eat the worm eggs. One spreads to ten, ten spreads to a hundred."

Doctor Hou nodded to express satisfaction. For Tanka people who were basically illiterate, remembering eighty or ninety percent was already very good. So she wasn't in a hurry to correct his errors. Back when she just learned medicine, she was scolded bloody by President Shi every day.

"According to the medical team's research, water dwellers are universally infected with one or more kinds of parasites. Health status is not good. So feces must be managed well. These worm eggs will not only affect your health but also spread to downstream areas with the water flow. Sanshui and Sihui areas also have a local disease called schistosomiasis. Shunde has no *Oncomelania* snails, but when the medical team investigated, they found a small number of cases in Shunde. Probably brought from upstream to downstream when river water roise," Doctor Hou explained.

"Little one understands."

"After sedimentation in the first two compartments, the feces in the third pool basically have no worm eggs and can be used directly to farm fields. The scum and sludge in the first two pools must be composted and fermented to completely kill worm eggs before they can be used. Our agricultural technicians will teach you how to compost. As village head, you must fulfill management responsibility."

He Lizhi patted his chest, "Chief rest one hundred hearts. Whoever dares to shit and piss randomly, directly confiscate crime tools!"

Doctor Hou couldn't hold back and laughed out with a *pu*.

...

While talking, Principal Tian walked over dejectedly.

"A-Liang, how is the school enrollment situation now?" Hou Qing asked.

"Ai, don't mention it. Harder than fighting war..." Tian Liang patted his head, a look of headache. "Exam rankings are out. Among the top five, only two are willing to go. Others all say they don't want to go. I moved the ones behind up to fill spots, result is still no one wants to go. You say such a good opportunity, why don't they want it? On the contrary, those rich ones, every single one fights to send children to school!"

Hou Qing knew that in this spring enrollment, the Chiefs restricted quotas for students of different backgrounds. Originally hoping to recruit more children from poor families to enter school. As for public expense students, restrictions on background were even stricter. Those above middle class, no matter how good the grades, couldn't take it. Must be poor children.

However, judging from enrollment, although gentry big households mostly had clan schools and private schools and looked down on this "Australian learning" in their hearts, they had numerous children. Sending some children of side branches and concubines to sign up casually counted as showing favor to the Senate. Middle-class families were most active. On the contrary, poor families had the lowest will to study. Even public expense students attracted no interest.

One side was middle-class parents asking favors everywhere, trying every way to sends children to school; one side was mobilizing in every way but no one responded. Although Tian Liang was not good with words, the benefits of studying were obvious. Even if just barely getting a Class B diploma like him back then, one could be recruited for work or join the army.

"Raising a child who doesn't work costs quite a lot," Hou Qing said. "You try to mobilize as much as possible. If it really doesn't work, go back and we ask the merchants in Dali Town if there are any willing to sponsor living expenses."

"This matter, ah, very suspenseful." Tian Liang shook his head greatly. "You want merchants to sponsor Tanka children to study? They'd think it's bad luck!"

Hou Qing knew this kind of prejudice couldn't be reversed by a single Senate document. Being anxious now was useless. She asked again: "Then how were today's exam results?"

"Sister-in-law Zhou's eldest boy has a flexible brain and tested best," Tian Liang had a face full of worry. "It's just... her man just died. She brings up four children as a woman alone. Family is truly difficult."

Hou Qing knew his enrollment wasn't going smoothly. She also sighed and shook her head.

"Chief Tian, your school only accepts small children, otherwise I would sign up," He Lizhi joked.

"You just follow the literacy team and medical team to learn, do the village head job well. Strive to enter the Agricultural Cadre Training Institute for advanced studies later." Principal Tian held a belly of anger because of enrollment matters and said grumpily.
