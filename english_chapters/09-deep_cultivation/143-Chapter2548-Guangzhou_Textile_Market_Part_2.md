# Chapter 2548: Guangzhou Textile Market (Part 2)

Now, we can only place hope on Chinese and foreign merchants seeing the potential here and trafficking Indian cotton over.

"Stop, stop, let's not consider this matter first." Li Shan laughed. "However, the smooth operation of the Nansha factory shows our technical direction is still correct!"

Zou Biao adjusted his glasses, saying helplessly: "Honestly speaking, reviving such a technical zombie like hydraulic spinning is truly not a good thing. Hydraulic power, this thing, has too great limitations..."

Ideally located places completely equipped with favorable climatic, geographical, and human conditions like Nansha Village could be said to be hard to meet; afraid not many could be found in the whole of Guangdong. Promoting it was too difficult.

"Moreover, hydraulic machines involve building overflow dams to raise the water head. If the river channel has navigation needs, supporting ship locks and ship lifts must also be built. Don't look at water being free; calculating infrastructure investment doesn't save much either. It's nothing more than low long-term usage cost."

"It's running anyway now, isn't it? Later when coal supply is popularized, just upgrade to steam engines. The whole set of equipment and processes won't need major changes; at least they can fight for another twenty years." Li Shan knew this old partner was full of grumbles, but saying one's own child is handsome is useless. Especially now there were quite a few good-looking children outside; there really wasn't much advantage.

Li Shan tried to cheer him up: "Although the technical zombie is old, it's good as long as it fits our current conditions! How is the Type 07 selling?"

Type 07 was the simple human-driven spinning machine and loom they specially developed for household users. The Type 07 spinning machine was a replica of the "Type 77 Spinning Machine" from the War of Resistance period. The earliest blueprint originated from the "Yamato Spinning Machine" invented in Japan. Zou Biao improved some structures, enabling it to connect to various power sources, including small-head water turbines, animal power, etc.

"The spinning machine is comparatively average, only sold dozens of sets. On the contrary, the loom sells very explosively. Over a hundred units were sold by last week."

This was an improved household loom. The principle was an improved flying shuttle loom with foot pedals, using a large number of standardized wooden and metal parts. Like the Type 07 spinning machine, it could also connect to other small power sources.

The benefit of Type 07 was that it could be placed at home. Women in cities and villages could buy it back, purchase cotton or cotton yarn from the market daily to spin and weave, then take the finished products out for sale.

"If you ask me, Type 07 spinning shouldn't be sold. Although the yarn quality it produces is passable and can go on the loom, it implies encouraging small-scale production in disguise, competing for raw materials with factories." Although Zou Biao was the main designer of Type 07, he wasn't fond of this "small producer tool."

"Local cotton planting is very little; farmers' enthusiasm for selling cotton isn't high, and the cost isn't worthwhile..." Li Shan said, "After scaled enterprises get big, they inevitably rely on purchasing cotton from outside. Letting individual households digest these sporadic productions fits just right."

In the long run, small producers would sooner or later be defeated by factories in cost. But this process might take ten to twenty years. After all, engaging in large-scale cotton textile industry was a long process. But once formed, the push to the entire market and industrial production would be like mountains roaring and seas howling. It wasn't without reason that the Industrial Revolution started from cotton textiles.

Li Shan actually didn't approve of using silk to develop light industry. Besides the inconvenience of silkworm cocoon transport mentioned before, the output was actually also limited.

Silkworms could also "eat people," but in terms of output, silkworm cocoons or wool could never compare with cotton. Due to the energy conversion efficiency problem of inputting into animal fibers, producing an equivalent amount of fiber required sheep or silkworms to use much more land than cotton. If used as luxury goods, their selling price was naturally higher. But as mass consumer goods, plant fibers like cotton and ramie were obviously more suitable for developing large-scale industry. Silkworm cocoons were also very intolerant to storage, unlike cotton and ramie where farmers could store them for a long time just by sun-drying, withstand long-distance transport, and quality wouldn't be affected too much.

Just as Li Shan stepped onto Guangzhou land with his front foot, Chen Lin arrived in Guangzhou with his back foot not long after. Chen Lin didn't come empty-handed either; arriving in Guangzhou with the ship were over ten bolts of blue cloth and over twenty bolts of white cloth.

These cloths were hand-woven by weavers using machine yarn from the cotton mill. In total there were about two hundred bolts. Half were dyed blue using dyes given by Australians; half were prepared to be sold directly as greige cloth.

This blue cloth was dyed cyan-blue by Lame Zhang using Australian dyes. The color was brighter than blue dyes used in the past. Lame Zhang praised it endlessly after seeing it, saying he had never dyed such bright cloth. And it didn't fade at all after rinsing.

Seventy bolts of cotton cloth were handed to several old partners of Fengshenghe for sales. But his own business partners mostly leaned towards silk; selling cotton cloth might be beyond their power. Just as Chen Lin was considering finding another more suitable underwriter, An Jiu recommended her father's Rui He Xiang to Chen Lin—fortunately, they counted as friends who had met once. So another fifty bolts of blue cloth were distributed there for sale.

He packed all the remaining eighty bolts of cloth in one go and consigned them to Guangzhou, wanting to try his luck everywhere to see if he could find suitable distributors. At the same time, he had to give Master Wu an explanation—after all, he was the big boss of this cotton factory.

Arriving in Guangzhou, he first visited Wu Yijun, presenting four bolts of blue cloth and four bolts of greige cloth. Wu Yijun was very delighted after seeing them, and then chatted about this new "International Textile Market."

Uncle and nephew more or less guessed the Australians' purpose in opening the market: to build a comprehensive trading platform for raw materials and commodities.

This was a great good thing for "laymen" like them. Speaking of Wu and Chen, neither was originally a merchant engaged in cotton cloth business. Changing profession involved a very complex "entry" process. Not only needing recognition from relevant guilds, but purchase and sales channels for raw materials and products were also completely dark [unknown], needing exploration from scratch. Sometimes even if you knew the specific network, it was hard to enter.

Now with this government-run platform, there was a direct trading market. Selling what or buying what was placed directly on the table. It was very convenient for both transport merchants and producers.

"This is indeed a good method. Needless to say, we must occupy a seat in this market." Wu Yijun laughed, "Otherwise, selling this cloth might take a huge effort!"

"Cousin-Uncle speaks correctly." Chen Lin also felt this was a matter convenient for both public and private interests. "It's just that the market hasn't opened yet, but there is a troublesome matter right now that must be solved."

"What matter?"

"No cotton." Chen Lin said the factory operation until now had used up all the cotton they spent half a year hoarding. Right now they could only stop production.

"So fast!" Wu Yijun was greatly shocked. He knew Australian spinning machines had amazing efficiency, but didn't expect it wasn't ten or twenty times faster than human power, but hundreds of times.

"Nephew didn't anticipate it either." Chen Lin smiled bitterly. "Nephew already sent people to scour the four villages—but now it is early summer; farm households have almost no stored cotton. Have to wait until autumn for new cotton to appear. Presumably, Guangzhou is a place where merchants and goods from all directions gather; mostly likely there is still stored cotton to buy. I plan to run around inside and outside the city these few days."

Wu Yijun pondered for a moment and said: "It's good for you to run around in Guangzhou city. But the chance of buying flowers [cotton] isn't big. Cotton prices rose fiercely in recent months. Rose almost three times compared to when it came on the market last year."

"Three times?!" Now it was Chen Lin's turn to be shocked. When agricultural products reached the "Green and Yellow not connecting" [gap between harvests] period, stocks dropped while new goods would take some days to appear; price rising was a normal situation. But cotton prices fluctuated extremely little in the past; rising to three times in one go, wouldn't buying it back mean losing money even if starting work?

He immediately lowered his head to calculate costs in his heart. Then he discovered with surprise that even if raw material prices rose three times, as long as the market cotton cloth price didn't fall, there was still profit—just comparatively meager.

"If it rose three times, as long as there are goods, it won't be a loss." Chen Lin said, "Nephew means, as long as not losing money, this factory's production cannot be interrupted."

Temporarily interrupting production originally wouldn't harm the factory. Closing the sluice to stop the water wheel, workers went home individually—no work, no wages. And now was exactly the busy farming time; workers had work to do whether on their own fields or selling labor as short-term workers.

But Chen Lin just executed "Thunderbolt Means" in Nansha. Keeping the Nansha Cotton Textile Factory in operating state had a very important effect on him stabilizing the situation in the village and clan.

"Rising three times and still not losing capital?"

"Indeed not losing," Chen Lin said, "Now the factory has 720 spindles spinning. If women spin at home, one person can only spin one [thread]. Spinning for a day produces yarn that can't match half an hour of machine output. Miss Li and Miss An both said, if cotton is sufficient, we can divide into two shifts to spin, stopping neither night nor day; cost is even lower..."

In factory production costs, labor took up a large proportion. The higher the production efficiency, the lower the cost. This was also the main reason factory machine production could defeat handicraft industry.

"Indeed, Australians spin all night without stopping machines." Wu Yijun recalled his observations in Lingao.

"Cousin-Uncle, how did this cotton rise so fiercely?"

"Australians sold quite a few new looms recently. Not the kind we use, but small ones, can be placed at home..."

"Waist looms?"

"Of course not, foot-pedaled ones." Wu Yijun gestured. "Although this small weaving and spinning machine can't compare to our big machines, the yarn and cloth made compared to past earthen looms [traditional looms] is a difference of clouds and mud. Once launched, weaving households everywhere borrowed money to exchange for this new machine. Once new machines increased, yarn became a popular item, and cotton naturally rose with the water."

"So it is." Chen Lin thought to himself. He recalled seeing such "Improved Machines" in the product exhibition room when visiting Lingao.
