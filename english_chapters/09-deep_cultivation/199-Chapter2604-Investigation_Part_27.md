# Chapter 2604: Investigation (27)

But why would she have this dream? As an atheist, Zheng Mingjiang didn't believe in "visitations in dreams" or "divine revelations." She believed that "one dreams at night what one thinks about during the day." She had been investigating the case and hadn't thought about any research-related issues. Could it be that her subconscious thought this case had some connection to scientific research?

Taking advantage of breakfast time, Zheng Mingjiang quickly straightened out the logical relationships of the case in her mind—the drugs must have leaked during the time from the Bairen General Hospital to the hands of the test subjects. The potential suspects involved were hospital doctors, the test subjects themselves, and unknown persons who collected drugs from the test subjects. Every time they leaked a portion of the drugs, it meant one less portion of drugs used for clinical trials. And if some of them privately disposed of the drugs, the possible impact would be?

"The results data of the clinical trials." In the dream, or rather under the guidance of the subconscious mind brought by years of scientific research experience, Zheng Mingjiang had a new idea.

By checking the experimental data backwards and sorting through suspicious data, it should be possible to find the specific time period of the drug outflow!

She telegraphed this hypothesis to Hao Long—he had presided over the drug trials back then, so the specific data and the files of the test subjects should be preserved in the Pharmaceutical Factory's archives.

Then she told Wu Mu her idea.

"I think it won't be difficult to trace the origin of this Southeast Asian man," Wu Mu said. "His characteristics are too obvious. It's very likely he was trafficked from some slave market through Quark Qiong's channels. Checking the relevant entry records will definitely find identifying suspects; likely a single check will reveal him."

"If he's a slave, how did he run to the medicine market?"

"That's for us to investigate!" Wu Mu became a bit curious. "Actually, this androgen business is very small; why do you care so much?"

"Although the case value is very small, there are too many things in it I can't figure out." Zheng Mingjiang voiced her doubts.

Although she didn't state her doubts explicitly, Wu Mu understood her meaning: from the beginning, she suspected that Senators had a hand in the drug leakage case and had tried hard to investigate in that direction. However, while there were many suspicions, there was no hard evidence, not even a clue worth mentioning.

"I see the biggest problem with this case is why it's linked to Daoist Wood Stone again," Wu Mu said. "He's always haunting the Senate like a lingering ghost."

"Rather than saying it's him, it's better to say it's his superior, Stone Elder," Zheng Mingjiang said. "To this day, the External Intelligence Bureau doesn't even know who Stone Elder is."

"Who he is isn't important. The key is that at this crucial moment when the Liang family is secretly networking and plotting rebellion, why would they intervene in this fake medicine case? Could it be they even bring their own rations to rebel against the 'Kun'? It really doesn't make sense." Wu Mu shook his head.

Actually, this was also the hardest part for him to understand. It was one thing for people like Liang Cunhou to rebel against the Senate, after all, their vital interests were involved. But why would "Stone Elder," a court bigshot far away in the capital with no ritual ties in the Two Guangs, fight the Senate to the death? Could it really be foresight and concern for the country and people? Such ministers did exist in the late Ming, but they could rarely mobilize resources as large as "Stone Elder," let alone organize wave after wave of actions.

Under Zheng Mingjiang's suggestion, the Senators in Guangzhou held another joint meeting on the drug leakage issue to deploy the next steps work. The meeting decided: First, urge rectification and supervise the implementation of problems found by various departments' self-examinations, plugging all loopholes found. Second, regarding the current personnel involved, launching relevant talk-and-return-loot activities for those whose case value is small or who have an "accomplice" nature. As long as relevant personnel realize their mistakes and make a written self-criticism that gets approved, they can be exempted from criminal punishment. Other related penalties would be discussed separately. Third, divide forces to Huizhou to implement large-scale searches and arrests, striving to catch people and loot together.

Because Huizhou belonged to an area where the Senate's rule was relatively weak, both administrative and military-police forces were thin, and grassroots organizations were practically non-existent. Expecting the locally mixed and limited National Army and police to conduct a comprehensive search and suppression of the area around Boluo was unrealistic. Zheng Mingjiang proposed mobilizing other troops.

Finally, it was decided that the newly organized troops training in Huizhou: four battalions of the Northern Vietnam Agricultural Reclamation Detachment would execute this task. Although in these four battalions, the only ones with real combat effectiveness were the armed cadre squadron of each battalion, four squadrons were still a considerable armed force.

After arriving at the farm estate, Yuan Shuzhi was basically considered to have completely "joined the gang." Although the account books sent by Steward Gao were fewer than before, an ominous flavor appeared: many "soldier pay registers" and "grain inventory registers" appeared.

Yuan Shuzhi knew from the pay registers and grain books he handled that this gang wasn't simply reselling the Senate's medicine, but "plotting rebellion." Judging from the accounts handled, this gang had secretly gathered thirty or forty factions of various sizes. According to the numbers in the pay registers, there were fully more than twenty thousand people. Just the monthly pay allocation required more than twenty thousand yuan, plus other scattered expenses. This unknown Daoist had to spend thirty thousand a month just to maintain these troops. It was truly spending money like water.

Yuan Shuzhi was secretly alarmed watching this; it turned out this Daoist had huge ambitions! To be honest, he never dreamed anyone would plan to rebel against the Australians. These Australians had done nothing but good deeds since arriving in Guangdong; everyone had benefited from them, so why would anyone think of rebelling? Truly ungrateful!

So, they painstakingly resold the Senate's "Divine Medicine" not to get rich themselves, but to raise such an armed force. Thinking of this, Yuan Shuzhi couldn't help but secretly despise them.

If they did it to get rich themselves, Old Yuan would still look up to them a bit more; although doing bad things, they were at least smart people. But to use money earned at the risk of losing their heads to fill this bottomless pit was simply both bad and stupid! Thinking of this, contempt spontaneously rose in his heart.

Obviously, such huge expenses couldn't be borne even by the Daoist earning "pecks of gold daily." Because Steward Gao brought the account books and wanted him to verify them one by one according to the Australian accounting book model, especially to clear out the falsely reported parts and suspicious points inside.

This was a piece of cake for Yuan Shuzhi, who had been trained over these days. He was actually not very familiar with Australian accounting laws originally, only at the level of having passed a certification exam, but doing accounts day and night these days had trained him somewhat. In just three to five days, he had cleared out hundreds of empty pay slots, and listed dozens of obvious floating reports, false reports, and contradictory or suspicious points in various expenses on the grain platform, involving an amount of fully more than two thousand yuan.

Once this figure came out, the Daoist looked solemn and specifically called him over to ask if there were any mistakes.

Yuan Shuzhi then detailed his clearing logic and the suspicious points found one by one. He spoke logically and flawlessly. Daoist Wood Stone listened and remained silent for a long time. After a while, he asked:

"Mr. Shu, if everything is cleared up, roughly how much is the amount of false claims and false listings?"

"If verified completely, out of the nearly thirty thousand expenses every month, about ten thousand is falsely listed." Yuan Shuzhi said in a low voice.

"So much!" The Daoist involuntarily exclaimed, then immediately stopped. He thought for a moment and asked, "Does Mister have any method to curb these false claims?"

"This..." Yuan Shuzhi pretended to be in difficulty, lowered his head to think for a long time before saying, "This student has never served in the army and knows nothing about the tricks in the army. However, as long as account books are sent for verification, mostly they can be found out."

"It seems that is the only way," Daoist Wood Stone sighed deeply. "I didn't expect the Australian bookkeeping method to have such efficacy! Alas, what a pity!"

He added, "Mr. Shu indeed has great talent in finance! I will need Mister's assistance much in the future!"

"Yes, this student will definitely serve with all his might." Yuan Shuzhi bowed deeply.

Back at the accountant's quarters, he almost laughed out loud:

"Let you earn black money! Let you rebel against the 'Kun' to restore the Ming!" He felt smug in his heart while clearing the accounts.

Although he hadn't served in the army, he had heard many things about the army. He knew that "pay" was the easiest thing to have problems with in the army. Whether it was high officials of the court or the Emperor, they actually tacitly allowed various corruptions and false claims in the army.

*This Daoist is a novice*, Yuan Shuzhi thought. *Rebelling and fighting wars is a matter of people risking their heads. Those recruited are all kinds of villains, rascals, bandits, and thieves. What righteousness do these people have? They are all held together by money. Once you get serious with them about money, they will immediately cause trouble. At that time, will you still be able to rebel?*

So he worked even harder on clearing the account books, almost to the point of fussing over every penny. Not only did he list all obvious false claims and floating reports, but even wherever there was a slight suspicion, he listed it all. His work attitude was simply that of a model worker.

Daoist Wood Stone also praised him greatly, called him over multiple times to commend him, and rewarded him with money several times. Although Yuan Shuzhi was undercover, he was always happy to have his work affirmed by a superior.

However, this happiness was only momentary. Undoubtedly, the more he knew, the more dangerous his situation became. Escaping was impossible; the security here was stricter than at the Jubao Hall, with absolutely no news from inside or outside. In leisure time, let alone walking around, even standing in the yard for a while longer would result in someone "persuading" him to go back. He could only stay cooped up in the room all day. Every day was doing accounts, auditing accounts, and transcribing and writing "summaries."

As he got deeper and deeper involved, he understood more and more about the scale of this lurking rebellion. He completely didn't expect that more than two years after the Senate had liberated Guangdong, someone could gather a rebel force of such scale, and it was already poised to strike!
