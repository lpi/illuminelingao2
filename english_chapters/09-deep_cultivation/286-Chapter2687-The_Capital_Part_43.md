# Chapter 2687: The Capital (Part 43)

Zhou Lezhi agreed wholeheartedly with this assessment, for up until now, the Teacher had essentially been dancing in the palm of Master Wang's hand. Master Wang knew his every move—even the words he whispered to his two concubines the previous night and how they spent their intimate hours. If Master Wang wished to know something, he could find out.

The Teacher might be a man of great learning, but when it came to the art of officialdom, he possessed not even a hundredth of Master Wang's skill. Even Zhou Lezhi himself was probably several times more capable in such matters.

Yet the Teacher was no mere "bookworm" who knew only his texts. When it came to understanding human nature and worldly wisdom, he could be remarkably shrewd. Viewed in this light, the Teacher was simply aloof and proud—unwilling to wade into the mire and filth of politics.

This thought deepened Zhou Lezhi's admiration by several degrees. Suddenly remembering something, he asked:

"Is the Teacher not an Australian? Have you never thought of returning to Australia?"

"I... cannot go back." At the mention of this, Hearthstone Immortal gazed up at the sky and released a long sigh.

"But aren't they right there in Lingao?" There was a probing quality to these words, for this was precisely what Master Wang had instructed him to determine: Would this Hearthstone Immortal defect to the Shorn-hair Thieves in Lingao?

"Lingao is indeed Australian territory. In a sense, they are my fellow countrymen. But the situation remains unclear, and I dare not go rashly." The Teacher sighed again.

So it seemed the Teacher's notion of defecting to Lingao had not changed, though his attitude remained hesitant.

"Once Master Wang assumes his post in Guangzhou, we can travel there as well. At that time, you can reassess the situation." Zhou Lezhi offered this counsel, his words half sincere and half calculated. In truth, he naturally did not wish for the Teacher to defect to the Australians and vanish forever. Yet if he openly discouraged him, the Teacher would likely grow suspicious.

And if the Teacher became guarded against him, these supreme teachings would become inaccessible.

Though the Wang household servants mocked Mr. Zhou's learning as "Wild Fox Zen"—heretical knowledge, mere miscellaneous studies of no practical use—Zhou Lezhi understood that the Teacher's learning simply lacked a proper outlet for application.

"That seems to be the only option. Fortunately, Guangzhou is not far from Hainan Island. Ah, and there is also *Zizhenzhai*—I wonder if that fellow surnamed Guo will return."

"To a city flowing with gold like Guangzhou? How could he not return? If his wares cannot be sold to wealthy households, could he possibly sell them to the mud-footed peasants of Qiongzhou Prefecture?"

Hearthstone Immortal paused, then laughed. "Quite right, quite right—you speak truly. These Australians have produced so many goods; there must be a market for them."

Their days in Dongyang were not many, but they were the happiest Zhou Lezhi had ever lived. Each day he either followed the Teacher through the mountains, studying geography, rivers, plants, and minerals; or he busied himself at the farm, knocking and tinkering on various projects. Every day brought new knowledge, opening up world after world of discovery.

Before the Teacher's vast ocean of knowledge, Zhou Lezhi recognized his own profound ignorance. And not merely his own—everyone he had ever encountered, including Master Wang who had passed the imperial Jinshi examination, was equally limited.

For the first time, Zhou Lezhi experienced the pure joy of learning. He began to pursue knowledge for its own sake, not because it was "useful," or because it could "earn a living," or for the promise of a "Golden House and Jade-like Beauty."

The manager of the Dongyang farm had already received his instructions: so long as the Immortal did not tear down the heavens themselves, let the Teacher tinker to his heart's content. When the Immortal had squandered all his funds, he would naturally settle down.

Yet Hearthstone Immortal proved worthy of his celestial title. The mosquito incense he produced hit the market precisely when summer brought forth swarms of mosquitoes and insects. Its effectiveness, affordable price, and absence of choking smoke quickly made it a sought-after commodity that sold out rapidly. Though the profits were modest, they were enough to make everyone at the farm—from top to bottom—view this "Immortal" with newfound respect.

Zhou Lezhi studied for more than half a year in this "work-study" environment. Shortly after celebrating the New Year in Dongyang, a letter arrived from Guangzhou, and master and disciple set forth once more for the provincial capital.

When Wang Yehao assumed his position in Guangzhou, he inherited a thorough mess. Though the Governor-General's primary responsibility concerned military affairs, the Governor-General of Liangguang also concurrently held the post of Governor of Guangdong. Moreover, by a twist of fate, the Governor-General's offices—originally based in Zhaoqing—had recently relocated to Guangzhou.

Thus, many of Guangdong's administrative headaches naturally fell upon his shoulders.

The provincial treasury was not merely empty but seemed to have been scrubbed clean, and somehow he found himself saddled with enormous debts. The Prefect of Guangzhou came weeping to his door daily, claiming that subordinate counties had all been plundered by the Shorn-hair Thieves and begging the Lord to memorialize the Court for tax reductions.

As for compensating soldiers and officers who had perished in successive defeats, reorganizing troops withdrawn from Qiongzhou, repairing burned courier stations and residences, reconstructing the various forts at the Pearl River Estuary, pacifying restive Yao settlements... these concerns descended upon Master Wang's head like an endless flurry of snowflakes.

After months of painstaking effort, Wang Yehao finally imposed a rough order upon affairs. Only then did he learn of the Ransom Fees and a privately concluded "Peace Treaty."

The Ransom Fees were manageable; previous arrangements had been proper. Barring any mishaps, he could balance the accounts during his tenure without causing trouble. But this "Peace Treaty" posed a thorny problem.

He summoned Jin Wenchi to study the treaty and identify its hidden dangers.

"Master, though this treaty is a curse, it need not burden you," Jin Wenchi said after reviewing the document. "This treaty was not signed under your authority; the Master naturally knows nothing of it..."

"That much I understand, but the conditions within..."

"Simply pretend ignorance, Master. Plainly speaking, these conditions all pertain to Guangzhou Prefecture's affairs. The Master need only turn a blind eye—so long as you do not provoke the Shorn-hair Thieves, they presumably will not come seeking trouble either." Jin Wenchi continued, "As for the various great lords within Guangzhou City, whose hands are clean? With Viceroy Wang serving as a cautionary example, who would still wish to antagonize the Shorn-hair Thieves?"

Wang Yehao agreed profoundly. Before arriving in Guangzhou, he had already gathered substantial intelligence. After his arrival, the rehabilitation efforts brought him into contact with many of the parties involved.

The Shorn-hair Thieves were vastly different from ordinary sea bandits—certainly not benevolent types. Yet he had also come to understand that they valued their word above all else. So long as he did not court disaster and acted in accordance with the treaty, he would likely avoid provoking them.

But the Shorn-hair Thieves had become a major hidden threat to the Imperial Court—of this, he understood better than most.

"Summon Hearthstone Immortal! Quickly!"

As an "Australian," Hearthstone Immortal presumably possessed considerable inside knowledge of the Shorn-hair Thieves. Given that they must have planted countless eyes and ears throughout Guangzhou City, and that officials and clerks across the various yamens who enjoyed their benefits were likewise innumerable, such a conspicuous figure could not be stationed within the city itself. After much deliberation, Wang Yehao arranged for Hearthstone Immortal to reside at the Governor-General's Office in Zhaoqing—the compound was spacious enough for him to tinker however he pleased.

Since the mosquito incense venture proved successful, Wang Yehao's estimation of Hearthstone Immortal had risen another level. Everyone appreciated earning money. If the Immortal could serve as his advisor in Zhaoqing while producing a second profitable invention like the mosquito incense, would that not be splendid? He had already instructed the Dongyang farm manager to increase production and rush shipments to Guangzhou before the following spring—the climate here was hotter, and mosquitoes appeared very early.

Zhaoqing had once been the seat of the Governor-General's Office. Subordinate officials and numerous troops remained stationed there, making defense and supervision quite convenient. The city lay deep in the interior, removed from Guangzhou's sphere of influence, yet the West River waterway connected them readily. Stationing this special staff team there gave Wang Yehao great peace of mind.

Apart from Jin Wenchi and a few trusted advisors brought from the capital, none of Wang Yehao's counselors knew that such a colleague existed in Zhaoqing.

"Just this gun?" Mr. Zhou examined the "Shorn-hair Thief Divine Artifact" placed on the desk, disappointment plainly visible on his face.

"What does the Teacher make of this object?" Wang Yehao detected the dismissive tone in Zhou Lezhi's voice and felt a secret surprise.

"About what I expected. It appears incapable of continuous fire—you must reload after each shot." Though somewhat disappointed, Mr. Zhou remained intrigued by the weapon before him.

"By the Teacher's assessment, there exist firearms superior to this?" Wang Yehao's eyes gleamed.

"Naturally. In the Qiankun Mirror, formidable weapons abound. This would hardly qualify as entry-level." Mr. Zhou handled the gun carefully for a while, then asked, "Tell me, where was this weapon obtained?"

Liu Sha glanced aside, and upon seeing Wang Yehao's slight nod, recounted the circumstances: "It is quite a coincidence, in truth. Your humble servant had a familiar brother in the capital named Huang Laoliu. When the Court abolished the Guards and Depots, he lost his livelihood and drifted to Guangzhou, where he joined a boat crew for some water-touching work. This bird gun was obtained through the boat owner's fence."

Liu Sha's torrent of underworld slang made Mr. Zhou frown repeatedly. "Speak plainly!"

"A group of Good Fellows set an ambush and robbed a Shorn-hair Thief vessel. This bird gun was seized from their hands."

"Is that true? What manner of Good Fellows are fierce enough for such a feat?" Mr. Zhou was astounded. "Speaking of which, the Court previously dispatched tens of thousands of troops—how is it they proved less formidable than mountain bandits?"

"Ah, one fears Regional Commander He underestimated his enemy. However, Shorn-hair Thief firearms are indeed formidable. It is said that during the camp raid, this bird gun claimed quite a few Good Fellows' lives."

Zhou Lezhi considered for a moment, concluding it was necessary to obtain firsthand accounts from those directly involved. "Master Liu, where is this Huang Laoliu? I wish to question him personally."

"Your humble servant has stationed Brother Huang in Guangzhou to keep watch," Liu Sha answered. "If the Sir has inquiries, your humble servant will send word immediately."

"Have him come here. I wish to learn the detailed circumstances." Mr. Zhou paused, then gave voice to a question that had long troubled him. "Also, is it true that these Australians burn, kill, plunder, and commit every conceivable evil?"

"Could there be any doubt! The Shorn-hair Thieves rely on their sharp firearms to perpetrate every manner of unconscionable deed. Wherever their blades reach, they care not whether you are gentry, young master, or the old and weak, women and children—whoever disobeys faces village slaughter and clan extermination. Several villages outside Guangzhou City were completely annihilated. Your humble servant barely escaped with his life."

"How can this be! Even the elderly, the infirm, women, and children are not spared?!" Mr. Zhou still struggled to believe it.

"That gang of Shorn-hair Thieves possesses a sadistic nature. Each time they sweep into a village, they seek out an open field to erect a high platform as an execution ground, hanging people until dead and leaving the corpses to dry in the wind, forbidding burial. They even have a pretty name for it—'Hanging Lamps'..." Liu Sha embellished his retelling of how the Shorn-hair Thieves raided villages one after another, besieged cities, set fires, and extorted ransoms.

Zhou Lezhi listened with growing dread, involuntarily worrying about his own family's safety. Come to think of it, ever since departing for Dongyang, there had been no letter correspondence for quite some time. This realization set his heart ablaze with anxiety, and he felt the urgent desire to request leave and return home to check on them.
