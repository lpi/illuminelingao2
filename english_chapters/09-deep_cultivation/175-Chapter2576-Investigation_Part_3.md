# Chapter 2576 - Investigation (Part 3)

Cui Hantang couldn't come up with any new ideas for the moment. Seeing the two's belligerence had subsided, Zhang Xiao secretly found it amusing. He said: "This matter can be done, but not spoken of openly. Did you two establish this study society just to provide staff aides for everyone? You at least need to give them some prospects for advancement."

Du Yibin said: "My ideas are bigger..."

"Ideals are ideals, reality is reality. I think sending them out as staff aides isn't impossible. Most Elders taking up local posts are completely in the dark—having a few locals who understand the situation and have reliable attitudes as advisors is actually quite useful. As long as you don't make too big a fuss, the Senate won't come asking questions. This at least gives these people some practical governance learning opportunities. When they take the civil service exam, they won't be shooting in the dark—it's better than sitting in the Study Society cramming past exam papers and practice tests."

With smooth talk, Zhang Xiao finally sent Cui and Du on their way. He thought to himself that this Zhang Jiayu really was a hot commodity! Today's conversation, so confrontational—felt like they were fighting over a romantic interest...

But Zheng Mingjiang didn't depart for Huizhou as scheduled. The day before she was to leave for Huizhou, Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital sent someone over, asking her to come for a "consultation."

"Consultation?" Zheng Mingjiang was startled. As Director of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Lingao General Hospital, nine times out of ten a consultation request meant a pregnant woman facing major risk.

"I'll come right away," she said.

Rushing to the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, sure enough, the nurse who welcomed her brought her to the obstetrics and gynecology department.

"Where's the patient?" She hurriedly asked someone to bring surgical gowns, preparing to disinfect.

"It's not about a patient," the nurse said. "Dr. Fu is waiting for you."

"Dr. Fu? Consultation?" Zheng Mingjiang was thoroughly confused. They'd urgently summoned her for a consultation, but instead of going to the ward, they were having a meeting first? What important patient?

Arriving at the obstetrics and gynecology office, not only was Fu Qiliang there, but Lin Motian as well. Both had somber expressions and said nothing.

"Where's the patient?" she asked.

"I'll take you," Lin Motian said.

The two led the thoroughly puzzled Zheng Mingjiang to the obstetrics and gynecology department's nursery and opened a ward door.

The room contained six or seven small beds, with infants sleeping soundly. Nurses watched over them—everything looked peaceful and serene.

"What's wrong?" Zheng Mingjiang vaguely felt something was amiss.

"See for yourself." Fu Qiliang said in a low voice. "This is the first time I've seen this since D-Day."

The nurse carefully lifted the thin blanket from an infant and undid the diaper. Zheng Mingjiang looked and was shocked, blurting out: "Female pseudohermaphroditism?"

"Yes," Fu Qiliang nodded. "Look at the other children."

The nurse undid the blankets one by one. Zheng Mingjiang examined each—every child was the same, and judging by their ages, the oldest differed from the youngest by at most two months.

"What's going on here?" Zheng Mingjiang was shocked. The incidence rate of pseudohermaphroditism was extremely low—normally only one in one hundred thousand to three hundred thousand probability. In all her experience practicing in the old timeline, aside from seeing one case during residency training, she hadn't seen another in over ten years. Yet here six or seven cases had appeared at once!

Clearly this couldn't have occurred naturally—it must have been caused by some artificial drug. They must have ingested large quantities of male hormones to produce such effects. Zheng Mingjiang suddenly remembered the "fetus-changing pills" she'd seen in Foshan. Could it be that?

But thinking carefully, while some traditional Chinese medicines did contain relatively high levels of male hormones, natural medicines without extraction and purification couldn't achieve such effects. Clearly, this had nothing to do with traditional Chinese medicine.

Fu Qiliang handed over a document: "Take a look. I find this matter very strange. It's quite possibly connected to the antibiotic case."

Thanks to the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital's tireless promotion, some pregnant women from wealthier families in Guangzhou had begun choosing to give birth in hospitals. But recently, the hospital had seen two or three consecutive cases of newborns with ambiguous external genitalia, and the families blamed the hospital. Fu Qiliang found the situation suspicious after taking the cases:

"...You know, pseudohermaphroditism has an extremely low incidence rate. An obstetrician might deliver babies their whole career without encountering one. And they're all female pseudohermaphroditism—that's very strange."

Such concentrated appearance of so many pseudohermaphroditic cases, and all female, in such a short period naturally struck Fu Qiliang as strange. He immediately told Lin Motian about it.

"...So we contacted the Joint Midwifery Clinic and had the midwives report whether there were similar cases in home births..."

The Joint Midwifery Clinic was a medical improvement project that the health sector had launched in Guangzhou and elsewhere. To compensate for the shortage of hospital beds and reduce childbirth risks, midwife training was conducted in various locations. Whether former traditional midwives or women willing to enter the profession, all could participate in free training. After passing evaluation and internship, they'd receive practicing certificates, operate under the Joint Midwifery Clinic, and conduct deliveries at patients' homes. Related deliveries were recorded and archived.

"Upon investigation, we discovered there were multiple similar female pseudohermaphroditism cases involving about ten infants. Additionally, there were over ten cases of abnormal genital development in male infants."

"Testosterone drug abuse?" Zheng Mingjiang blurted out.

"Correct." Fu Qiliang nodded.

"What about these children?" Zheng Mingjiang said. "We need to admit them quickly. Remediation now can still salvage something!"

"Except for a few who died from illness, we've admitted them all in the past few days." Fu Qiliang said. "Dr. Lin and I felt we should ask you for a consultation, do a comprehensive evaluation, then formulate a treatment plan."

"That's no problem." Zheng Mingjiang said. "I can postpone the Huizhou trip or send someone else. But there's a problem with this!"

"Yes, Dr. Lin thinks so too. Only our pharmaceutical factory can produce testosterone drugs. These children's mothers must have used testosterone drugs during pregnancy."

"So more drugs have leaked out."

"Correct. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone affect fetal external genital development mainly during weeks eight through fifteen of pregnancy, while normal pregnancies last about forty weeks. That means if we only start investigating this case after observing newborn abnormalities, this batch of drugs must have arrived in Guangzhou at least half a year ago at the earliest."

"When did this go into production?"

"Strictly speaking, it was never officially in production." Zheng Mingjiang said. "To this day it's still small-batch trial production. There's only small-scale Phase I clinical trials at Lingao General Hospital outpatient clinic. Honestly, I never expected anyone would connect it with fetus-changing."

Lin, Fu, and the others were medical personnel whose perception of pharmaceutical development was like a black box. To be precise, doctors only knew what drugs they currently needed and what drugs the pharmaceutical sector could produce—nothing more. So hearing that the pharmaceutical factory produced testosterone surprised them, since this drug had no use in this timeline.

Zheng Mingjiang had been in Lingao for a long time. She also handled some pharmacy work at Bairén General Hospital, frequently dealing with technical personnel from Danzhou Pharmaceuticals, so she knew this stuff's origins.

"There's not only testosterone—conjugated estrogen went into production at the same time." Zheng Mingjiang said.

"But these two things have no use for us now." Lin Motian was somewhat puzzled.

Conjugated estrogen's main indications were relieving vasomotor symptoms, mucosal atrophy, osteoporosis, and other conditions appearing in female menopause. Testosterone went without saying—there was no Elder who'd heard of having strong demand in that regard. If there was demand, it would at most be for certain external sales markets.

"You're right." Zheng Mingjiang nodded. Demand for testosterone and conjugated estrogen indeed wasn't very large. The factory's R&D was mainly as an introduction to steroid hormone synthesis process research. Zheng Mingjiang didn't understand much about these things, only knowing that Hao Long, who was in charge of R&D, had told her that developing and producing these two sex hormones was a stepping stone for producing hormone drugs next.

"So that's how it is. Being able to produce various hormones would indeed be a great thing." Fu Qiliang said. "But this drug is still a Phase I clinical trial drug with such limited application scenarios—how did it leak out?"

"If we're talking about the source, there are only two places. One is the pharmaceutical factory; the other is Bairén General Hospital's pharmacy." Zheng Mingjiang recalled that she had been very careful about drug control. At that time, she hadn't thought about drugs leaking out—rather, she was afraid the few half-baked pharmacists in the pharmacy would get medicines mixed up.

Could someone be manipulating things in the pharmacy? Zheng Mingjiang's heart suddenly sank.

After a moment's thought, she said: "No good—I need to return to Lingao immediately. These things leaking out will cause endless harm!" With that, she rose to leave.

Lin Motian hurriedly stopped her: "Don't rush! This matter could well be the work of a gang. Since it's come out now, we still need to investigate it thoroughly. I don't think you need to rush this instant. Tomorrow let's first hold a meeting, compile this into a report and submit it to Dr. Shi. Since you're now leading the joint investigation team, why not investigate together?"

Lin and Fu's opinion was to prioritize investigating the antibiotic leakage case. Since testosterone was a trial drug with inherently small production volume, the leaked quantity would necessarily be very limited, without much impact on the overall health sector. It could be investigated later.

Zheng Mingjiang thought their reasoning made sense and nodded: "Then I'll go to Huizhou as planned. However, during my trip to Foshan, I bought quite a few 'miracle drugs.' Some of them also contained purified crystalline substances—possibly leaked drugs as well. There are no testing facilities in Guangzhou..."

"We'll arrange that." Lin Motian said. "We'll send them to the Health Ministry's pharmaceutical laboratory for testing as soon as possible."

"What about treating these children?" Fu Qiliang said. "We've now identified over twenty affected male and female children. Further investigation will probably find more. Drug treatment requires controlled substances—we don't have them here."
