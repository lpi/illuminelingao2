# Chapter 2640: Secrets of Qiaonan Village

Zhang Jiayu was stunned. Local water network spread everywhere. Everywhere were ponds swamps rice paddies. Between villages although having field ridge small roads, using boats was most convenient. Hening actually said wanting to walk land road, and departing while sky color not bright—this was a surprise search.

Where would go? Since walking, at this moment just past fourth watch (2 AM), obviously target wouldn't be too far. Mostly just in place of few *li* around Jiujiang Market.

He suddenly remembered Qiaonan Village searched not long ago. That time Mo Yu went to search, but finally gained nothing. He even raised suggestion...

Could it be—

He suddenly became nervous. Could it be this Qiaonan Village truly had Anti-Kun Righteous Gentlemen manufacturing gunpowder, forging weapons armor in dark. Last time searching not obtained, this time coming a Returning Horse Spear (surprise return)?

Why specially calling myself to follow team again? Could it be because last time I "Offered Diligence," Senator Zhang had heart to "Try" myself a bit?

If really searched out something in Qiaonan Village, what attitude should I use to handle? If searched out certain familiar teacher senior, want or not think way to rescue...

For a time, various conflicting thoughts surged onto his heart. Actually face color somewhat pale, hands feet no place to put.

"Dazed for what? Change clothes quickly ah." Hening pushed him a hand, "Not asking you to go to battle to fight! Scared like this."

Zhang Jiayu smiled bitterly secretly: If going to battle to fight, he was not afraid a bit. Even if possible war death wouldn't have half bit hesitation. But right now this half black not white marginal person situation was more unbearable for him.

Team gathered completely. Under order of that strange cadre, Search Team quietly left Jiujiang Market. Under lead of local police walked forward along field ridge all the way.

Zhang Jiayu once out of Jiujiang immediately dizzy head turned direction. Plus sky color not bright, walking on field ridge hard to distinguish road deep one foot shallow one foot. Extremely disheveled. Fortunately he liked soldiers practiced martial arts in ordinary days, polished a good body. Tightly staring at white identification strip on back of person in front walking fast all the way.

Gradually sky color slightly bright. Zhang Jiayu followed Zhang Xiao "Touring" here before. Had some knowledge on surrounding villages more or less. Eye seeing surrounding scenery becoming more and more familiar—indeed was going towards Qiaonan Village!

Not using boat, light pack on foot. Except leading cadre and guide all were Japanese...

This obviously was organizing surprise attack on Qiaonan Village. Could it be this village truly had some Anti-Kun Righteous Gentlemen manufacturing gunpowder? Then why last time checked nothing out? Could it be Mo Yu was also Anti-Kun Comrade?

While thinking wildly, team already quietly arrived at village entrance. Here was same as other local villages. Entering village entrance all set up Gate Tower. Closed at night. Having Rural Braves guarding on duty. After Senate came, this system continued down. Just Rural Braves all changed name to Militia.

Zhu Clan tribesmen heard Magistrate Zhang these few days was propagating Women Protection like wind and fire, trying various chicken feather garlic skin cases. Felt this person just so so. Purely managing some chicken feather garlic skin matters. Plus searched not long ago. So people in village mostly slacking. Even people patrolling on duty at village entrance also relaxed vigilance. Did not notice approach of National Army slightly.

Two team member vanguards knocked down sentries. After disarming all militias, National Army rapidly occupied various traffic fortifications inside village. Sealing whole village water leaking not out. Zhu Clan a tribe hadn't had time to resist yet, were surrounded water leaking not out under bayonets of National Army.

Zhu Bolian put on clothes in panic. At beginning he thought bandits raided. After seeing clearly National Army uniform, couldn't help greatly surprised. Low voice said: "All left or not?"

"Left long ago."

"This is good." Zhu Bolian heart secretly said dangerous! If they came two days earlier, several artisans afraid couldn't walk away. Now, artisans all left. Gunpowder and relevant utensils were transported away long ago. Nitre Field although still there, inside now had nothing. presumably Kun thieves didn't know what it did either.

Having this confidence, he put on a "Shocked" "Angry" expression, questioned: "Various General Lords! Early morning coming to humble residence, don't know have what advice?"

Guide Mo Yu scolded: "Zhu Bolian! You behave honestly a bit! This is Section Chief Xu (*Xu Kezhang*), specially coming to handle big case!"

Zhu Bolian heart didn't shock. Raising head looking over. Saw this Section Chief Xu thirty-plus years old. Face color hazy pale. Very scary. He emboldened guts to make a bow, said: "Dare ask Lord, what matter did small citizen commit?"

Section Chief Xu said not a word. Seemed saying no necessity to talk to him. Still Mo Yu took out a search warrant. Using lame Mandarin said: "Recently someone reported, Qiaonan Village has stranger appearing disappear. Suspected to be River Ocean Big Bandit. I received search warrant specially coming to search!"

"Director Mo! Some days ago didn't you just come to search? My place here doesn't even have a few strangers. Where come River Ocean Big Bandit..." Zhu Bolian made a "Wronged" "Puzzled" expression.

Mo Yu smiled slightly awkwardly. This search he only knew at dawn today. Woken up by people. Made preparation. Just before departure someone told him destination.

He pulled face saying: "Since none, what is good to fear? Search search, removing suspicion for your family is also good."

Finished speaking, not waiting for Zhu Bolian to speak either, ordered to start search. National Army filed in. Blockading Zhu Residence, Ancestral Hall, Shops etc. various places. Personnel all cleared to outside to register check. Rumaging boxes pouring cabinets. Tossed straight until more than 10 AM morning only then completed search.

Political Security Bureau cadre responsible for copying inspecting brought list. whispered a few sentences in Xu Tong's ear again.

Saying finding what prohibited goods, that naturally none. Hard to say have was no more than dozens of swords, spears, bows arrows and ten-plus bird guns, small amount of gunpowder. These things every village had. Senate never said confiscating either.

Zhu Bolian said to Xu Tong: "This Lord, Bows Arrows and Bird Guns are used by village to resist bandits. Former Dynasty time local bandits rampant. Had to prepare. Lord searched out any River Ocean Big Bandit?"

Xu Tong was very cold. As usual said not a word. Only Looking at list in hand. Seemed in thought.

Mo Yu said: "Though didn't search out Big Bandit, must be he received news in advance escaped. You same can't escape relation!"

Zhu Shilian beside endured for long time, angered: "You bully people too much! Blood mouth spraying people, creating framing out of void is act of current Court?"

Other Zhu Clan young children also restless up. Scene somewhat uncontrollable. National Army here immediately pointed Minie Rifles forward one foot (*chi*). Bright shinning bayonets flashing cold light.

Scene swords drawn bows bent (*Jian Ba Nu Zhang*). But Zhang Jiayu following team relieved. Secretly said today must pounced empty. With Chiefs' style, handling case always stressed evidence conclusive. Now first no human witness, second no material evidence. If conflict rose only increased casualties in vain. Harming without benefit.

Seeing "Section Chief Xu" without any instruction, Zhang Jiayu hurriedly went over to say to Mo Yu in low voice: "Director Mo, since here copied out no violation object, also no suspicious stranger. Why not say a sound to Section Chief Xu end just here. Zhu Family has big family big business locally. Monk can run Temple can't run. Wanting to arrest people anytime can do. Following matters, better hand to Chief to decide."

Mo Yu at this moment also somewhat awkward. Zhu Family locally counted as big household quite "Cooperating Work." Now searching like this without evidence, quite had meaning of intentionally making Difficult. He carried out work here, didn't want to make relationship all stiff either. Immediately looked towards Section Chief Xu.

Saw this Section Chief Xu face without expression. Seeing Mo Yu looked over, nodded slightly.

Since Section Chief Xu no instruction, here also gained nothing, Mo Yu immediately admonished Zhu Clan a round. Organized team to modify back to camp.

Once returned to camp of Jiujiang Market, Xu Tong reported to Zhang Xiao alone immediately.

Zhang Xiao heard Xu Tong's report, thought in heart indeed couldn't play stratagem with this group of human spirits.

"Looks like, this matter still needs coordination of various departments to handle down."

"I don't approve conducting surprise search on Qiaonan Village." Xu Tong's face color pale, "Although can prove they indeed involved in case, also know what they did. But towards whole case has no big breakthrough value."

"Gained nothing..." Zhang Xiao somewhat depressed.

"Gained nothing also not necessarily. At least we knew some relatively important clues. Will be useful when digging root later."

"What do you plan to do next?"

"I plan to return to Guangzhou immediately. Organize these collected clues a bit to hand to Bureau Chief Wu to look over. Propose on Guangzhou City Internal Affairs Security Meeting as soon as possible."

"Also good. I also hung around almost enough. Also time to go back to rest." Zhang Xiao stretched waist body. Suddenly asked, "How do you feel about this Zhang Jiayu beside me?"

"Has surpassing points. Just inner heart entangled."

Zhang Xiao stunned. Subsequently laughed loudly. Thought this Xu Tong sometimes truly somewhat funny. These two sentences truly spoke on point. This person on observing people recognizing people indeed had surpassing points. No wonder was Political Security Bureau's Number One Naturalized Citizen Cadre.

"Then hope he heart without distraction early."

After inspection of Jiujiang ended, this trip counted as coming to a section end. Zhang Xiao considered proposing to Liu Xiang proposal of constructing Jiujiang Development Zone after going back. Opening a National Primary School, an Agricultural Technology School in Jiujiang. Freshwater Fish Breeding Base and Guangdong Sericulture Improvement Base also set here. Zhao Hening would be dispatched to station in Jiujiang to guide sericulture improvement work. Tian Liang responsible for supervising school construction. Chen Wuren appointed as Director of Jiujiang Development Zone. Simultaneously sending a squad of National Army to garrison, to prevent possible riot.

Zhang Xiao and Li Yao'er discussed afterwards both thought Jiujiang as Nanhai County Seat obviously inappropriate. Jiujiang location at southernmost end of Nanhai County. Same as current County Seat couldn't play function of commanding whole area. According to Old Time Space experience, whether Nanhai governing Foshan, or Foshan governing Nanhai, best County Seat location was still in Foshan. Just now Foshan handled to Little Senators to engage in a Pilot Zone. Zhang Xiao running over there to set County Seat again was not quite appropriate. But Foshan currently was still a district under Nanhai jurisdiction. Considering from long term development of Guangzhou, needed broad economic hinterland. As long as Liu Xiang was still Guangzhou Mayor, Foshan's positioning could only be a special Pilot Zone.
