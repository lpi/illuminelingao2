# Chapter 2552: Chu He and Ren Youzi

The two returned from the market and immediately sent someone to deliver the news to the Municipal Government—besides there, they didn't know who specifically to notify. A courier delivered An Jiu's note again, saying Chen Lin requested a meeting regarding the current Paper Cotton situation in Guangzhou.

As soon as the words "Paper Cotton" entered his ears, Li Shan immediately said: "Send someone to find Chen Lin, say I will see him right away!"

The courier turned and went out. In less than an hour, Chen Lin arrived at the two's temporary office in the Great World. He told them everything he heard and saw about Paper Cotton recently face to face, and also discussed his own hidden worries.

"...If cotton prices rise three times a day, let it be; following the market, rising and falling is normal. There is always a reason. But for Patterned Cloth Firms to write a contract on a piece of white paper and sell it as goods, exchanging for shining silver money—from ancient times to now, never heard of such a thing..."

"You don't need to worry too much; this matter itself is just speculation. Some people are too greedy and inevitably will suffer big losses." Li Shan said, "As long as you hold yourselves steady, it's fine! As for the cotton problem you mentioned, we have relevant preparations. In a few days, raw cotton will enter the market."

"Yes, many thanks, Chief!"

"However, don't reveal this news for the time being. Just know it yourself." Li Shan told him "not to worry," but his own heart was actually seven up and eight down [anxious/unsettled], because once the Paper Cotton bubble burst, the price of spot raw cotton would also avalanche with it.

Although the current raw cotton spot bubble was also huge, and returning to normal prices was a good thing, if the price fell too much, it would inevitably damage a large batch of industry stakeholders. Unfavorable to industry development.

Moreover, would this matter affect the status of the cotton textile industry in the Senate's heart? This was what Li Shan worried about more.

Let alone the Paper Cotton incident, even without this matter, shortage of raw cotton and factories lacking raw materials approaching stoppage was also a reality. It proved the consistent reason of many Senators who opposed developing the cotton textile industry in the past: Guangdong's cotton planting industry was simply insufficient to support a scale cotton textile industry. He originally thought he could knock down Songjiang Cloth through dumping machine-woven cotton cloth, forcing cotton export from the Jianghuai region.

The problem was, now even cotton wasn't enough; where would "massive" and "cheap" machine-woven cloth come from? Songjiang Cloth, which should have been "finished" in the plan, not only wasn't finished but was continuously going south, because local cotton textile products, whether from factories or farm families, were simply insufficient to satisfy the appetite of the Nanyang Company, this suddenly emerging gluttonous giant beast.

Counting on Jianghuai cotton wouldn't work, and Guangdong itself wasn't a place suitable for planting cotton. The only hope was India. Thanks to his foresight, last year he sent Penglai Company to conduct relevant negotiations with Portuguese and British people, ordering several future delivery contracts for cotton. Now three Portuguese ships fully loaded with Indian cotton ordered by Penglai Company were anchored in Macau handling quarantine and customs clearance procedures. Once procedures were completed, Portuguese ships would sail directly to the International's cargo wharf to unload. In an instant, hundreds of tons of cotton would go on the market at International.

Undoubtedly, the only result of the Paper Cotton bubble bursting and large amounts of spot goods entering the market would be a comprehensive plunge in spot cotton prices.

How to make prices "land smoothly" instead of having a "hard landing"? Li Shan discussed with Zou Biao in the office for half a day without any result.

The only method they could think of was to ask Liu Xiang to conduct administrative intervention, directly banning Paper Cotton trading and shutting down/seizing the few Patterned Cloth Firms that were the initiators. But what about the subsequent liquidation? Even if the "illegal income" of Patterned Cloth Firms could be fully recovered, it was far from comparing with the market price that had currently expanded more than ten times. Those common people whose Paper Cotton in hand became worthless certainly couldn't accept it.

"I see, we can't discuss any way out of this matter ourselves; still have to find professionals to handle it. As for Indian cotton, I think temporarily don't let it enter the market suitable. As long as it doesn't enter the market, at least the spot market can stabilize." Zou Biao proposed an idea, "Originally, the main customers of raw cotton weren't retail investors in the market either. Let Penglai supply Nansha Factory and Guangzhou State Cotton Factory directly according to internal agreement prices. Try to reduce the impact of spot goods..."

"But doing this, it equals Penglai eating all the capital pressure."

Nansha Factory currently only had 720 spindles, with limited ability to digest inventory; and Guangzhou State Cotton, which had 1200 spindles in phase one, would only complete capital construction and equipment installation by autumn.

"Forget it, go find Old Ren and Chu He to discuss." Li Shan said.

Before they went out, the closing market situation of International Textile Market had been delivered to them. Cotton cloth fell 16% compared to the previous day, cotton yarn fell 23%, cotton fell 27%...

This tragic drop was unbearable to look at. Li Shan knew if it were the stock market or futures market, someone should have jumped off a building by now.

"What's the Paper Cotton market situation?"

"People sent to inquire came back saying Qingyun Tower Tea House, which originally traded Paper Cotton, closed shop after noon..."

"What?! Ran away?"

"Specific situation unclear."

"Call the Municipal Police Bureau in my name, find Mu Min, say I ask her to allocate a few police officers to help me investigate some affairs." Li Shan wrote a note while speaking and handed it to the courier, "Let police report to the Securities Regulatory Commission office."

Then he hurriedly made a phone call to Liu Xiang.

"I already know about this matter." Liu Xiang's voice was lukewarm [neither hot nor fire], "Little Ren and Chu He are working in the Great World; you just hold an on-site meeting there."

Judging from Liu Xiang's tone, obviously, he didn't treat this as some big matter.

"This... Don't you... Don't you send someone over to attend?"

"I think this matter is relatively professional and involves financial stability. As a local administrative leader, I am not suitable to directly take the lead in organizing intervention in this matter." Liu Xiang said, "You discuss first. What are the specific plans? After forming a resolution, I will refer to execute it. Relax, our Municipal Government will fully cooperate."

These words were both evasion and stating a stance, but the meaning was self-evident: Liu Xiang didn't intend to get deeply involved in the Paper Cotton incident and wasn't too interested in "maintaining market stability."

However, at any rate, he counted as stating a stance.

Ren Youzi and Chu He's office was inside the Great World, very close to their office. Li and Zou went over and knocked on the door, finding Ren Youzi actually still absent, only Chu He remaining on guard.

"Old Ren was called by Cheka to help. We have few affairs here; workload isn't enough. But he will definitely come back before dinner." Chu He showed a slightly awkward smile, "Two coming to find us, is it about the recent Paper Cotton matter?"

"That is it, that is it!" Li Shan was already burning with anxiety. Seeing this Chu He still looking like clouds are light and wind is light [breeze/calm], he felt angry unconsciously. Looking again at his swollen eyelids, obviously, he fell asleep just now.

*Such a big mess happened outside, yet you have the heart to sleep!* He criticized endlessly in his heart, but out of politeness still said: "This matter has already become very big now. I worry about accidents, so specially came to find you—after all, both are professionals."

Hearing that he was a "professional," some smiles appeared on Chu He's face. He said modestly: "Professional or not I dare not say; after all, social conditions are very different. You please sit first. Ren Youzi will return in a while; we talk together." After speaking, he called a life secretary to pour tea for the two.

"Regarding Paper Cotton, actually Old Ren and I learned about it long ago. It was in Guangzhou's social situation briefing. Honestly speaking, we are both very interested. This explains one point: commerce and finance are actually inseparable. To a certain degree, without us so-called 'Future Brains' teaching it as miraculous schemes, it will come to this world spontaneously in various forms..."

Zou Biao thought: *Looking at your appearance, roughly you still regard this as a sign of social progress.* But it was inconvenient for him to flair up now, so he had to continue listening.

"On this matter, our view is consistent with Old Ren's. That is everyone can be calm and not impatient; even if it explodes, there won't be too big consequences."

"But..."

Just as Li Shan wanted to raise objections, Ren Youzi came back. Entering the door, he asked: "What is going on? Why did two police officers come? Still saying Mu Min sent them here, to report here..."

"I asked Mu Min to send them to me." Li Shan explained hurriedly.

"Good guy, you are preparing to use police directly for Paper Cotton; defined the nature?" Ren Youzi put down the briefcase, took the towel handed by the life secretary, and wiped his sweat.

"Defining nature or not, I don't have this power either. But our futures market closed doors suddenly." Speaking, he told about Qingyun Tower Tea House closing suddenly after noon, "Paper Cotton is mostly traded in this tea house. I suspect sudden closing means relevant parties have the possibility of running away! So I consider whether to ask police to catch people first."

"Indeed have this possibility." Ren Youzi nodded, "However, the tea house boss himself isn't the issuer of Paper Cotton. What he earns is nothing more than handling fees—whether there are any is still unclear, so catching him doesn't have much meaning. Besides, even if you catch all bosses of Patterned Cloth Firms issuing Paper Cotton, forcing them to spit out all money selling Paper Cotton, can it fill the current hole?"

"This..."

"You two are responsible persons of cotton textile departments; I can understand your mood. But we have always been paying attention to this matter." Ren Youzi said while pulling out a dossier box from the file cabinet, handing it to Li Shan.

"This is the situation regarding Guangzhou Paper Cotton we collected. Matters big and small, all are here."

"So you were paying attention..."

"Otherwise? Could it be we just drink tea and sleep here every day?" Chu He smiled systematically, "I said just now, the appearance of Paper Cotton is a very interesting thing. Whether out of official business or purely satisfying a bit of our research desire, we would pay attention to it."

Li and Zou's hearts settled down somewhat at this time. Seems these two were considered reliable!
