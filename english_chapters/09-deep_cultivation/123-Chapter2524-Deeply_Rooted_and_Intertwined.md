# Chapter 2524: Deeply Rooted and Intertwined

Mu Min began to tease: "Douglas Adams was really good at understanding human nature. How did that saying go? 'Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.' Given the average life expectancy of ancient people, I think these numbers should be advanced a few years."

Lin Baiguang roasted, "Du Yibin pesters Song Yingsheng all day long. Now you guys want to create a 'Lingnan Three Loyalists' boy band. I really can't stand the hobbies of you severe collectors of historical celebrities."

Liu Xiang repeatedly denied it. "No one present should have this hobby. At least I definitely don't."

"But speaking of which, if there were a few historical celebrities around saying 'Chief is wise' from time to time, followed by 'bowing down immediately,' would everyone's sense of accomplishment slowly increase?" Lin Baiguang asked with a smile.

"Needless to say! But alas, there aren't any. Minister Lv says I'm wise and martial every day, but his praise sounds boring."

Seeing the meeting theme straying again, Wu Mu reminded, "Back to business, don't digress. Judging from the intelligence reports and information compiled by the Grand Library, not only in Guangdong but throughout the entire Ming officialdom and gentry group, there are deeply rooted and intertwined relationships. The Senate's various public information must have already spread within this network. The Ming gentry group should have a relatively good understanding of us. Chen Zizhuang and his student Li Suiqiu are currently the core figures of the entire Guangdong gentry group. Their relationships with gentry in the capital and Jiangnan are also very close. How to properly arrange for them concerns the attitude of the gentry group north of the Five Ranges towards the Senate when the Senate launches a full-scale Northern Expedition in the future."

"Who cares about their attitude? Ask the steel guns and cannons in our hands to know what attitude to use!" Mu Min said.

"That is the logic, but according to the Senate's strategy, most areas in the future are estimated to be settled by passing a proclamation to reduce unnecessary casualties and unnecessary loss of productivity; otherwise, recovery will be too slow." Wu Mu explained, "As positive figures in the old timeline, the Three Loyalists of Lingnan still carry some weight in the hearts of many Senators. Many people don't hope they end up with a terrible outcome—some even specifically greeted our bureau, asking us to 'save them in time.'"

"Some things cannot be achieved just by our wishful thinking." Lin Baiguang sighed. "Stance and integrity sound very metaphysical, but when you really encounter them, you realize they are not vain."

Liu Xiang drank a mouthful of strong tea and said to Senator Li Zhuoxian next to him, "Old Li, you'd better introduce this spider-web-like relationship chart of this group of gentry first."

Li Zhuoxian was a Guangzhou native of the old timeline and had considerable research on Ming historical figures. After the Senate started the Guangdong and Guangxi strategy, he naturally followed the team north to carry out work. He opened his laptop and projected a huge mind map onto the screen.

"This is the relationship chart I compiled based on materials and intelligence from this timeline, plus historical data from the old timeline," Li Zhuoxian said.

"Senator Wu Mu is right, but not entirely right. Accurately speaking, Chen Zizhuang and his student Li Suiqiu should be the core figures of the gentry group currently having tendencies to resist, not the core figures of the entire gentry.

"First, a brief introduction to Chen Zizhuang. His family has served as officials for generations. He himself won Third Place (*Tanhua*) in the imperial examination and once resisted the Eunuch Party, so he is very famous. Before being dismissed, he was the Right Vice Minister of Rites and Academician Reader-in-Waiting, serving as a lecturer for the Classics Mat, and acting in charge of the administrative affairs of the Ministry of Rites. In 1635, Chen Zizhuang had a chance to enter the Grand Secretariat, but wasn't selected, and was later dismissed and returned to his hometown. Everyone is familiar with this person, so I won't say more.

"Next are He Wuzhou and Huang Shijun. He Wuzhou and Chen Zizhuang are neighbors and will be in-laws in the future. Historically, Chen Zizhuang's youngest son, Chen Shangtu, married He Wuzhou's daughter. He Wuzhou also served as Right Vice Minister of Rites. Not long after entering the Grand Secretariat, he was fought down by Wen Tiren. In the historical 1636, He Wuzhou founded Xiangshan Academy, where Li Suiqiu, Chen Zizhuang, Xie Wenchang, Kuang Lu, and Chen Bangyan all received instruction under his door. Although this person He currently appears to defect to us on the surface, he is very unreliable. Historically, it was he who instigated Li Chengdong to rebel against the Qing and restore the Ming. However, we can ask the informants in Beijing to keep an eye on Gu Chaojian. This person is from Chao'an and has a very poor relationship with He Wuzhou. Because He Wuzhou led the local gentry of Guangdong and Guangxi to pull strings with the two academies and three offices, since the Xinwei year (1631), Gu Chaojian and He Wuzhou wrestled, but He Wuzhou was powerful, so Gu Chaojian always couldn't win and was very resentful. How bad is the relationship between these two? Bad enough that later when Gu Chaojian heard Li Chengdong pacified Fujian, he personally went to Fujian to meet Li Chengdong and presented a plan to pacify Guangdong. It was precisely under Gu Chaojian's vigorous request that Li Chengdong accepted Gu's strategy, taking Guangzhou almost bloodlessly and destroying the Shaowu regime."

The Senators present widened their eyes upon hearing this, feeling it was incredible. Someone roasted, "What kind of brain circuit is this?"

Li Zhuoxian said, "Ji Liuqi believed that Gu Chaojian 'spoke extremely that within three months one could go straight to Western Guangdong and Guilin, thinking of gaining the first merit to suppress He Wuzhou.' So now that He Wuzhou is dismissed and at home, and trapped in the enemy camp, if Gu Chaojian doesn't take this opportunity to make trouble for He Wuzhou, he would simply be letting down his relationship with He Wuzhou, which is like fire and water. If Chongzhen listens to Gu Chaojian and takes anger out on Guangzhou bureaucrats and gentry like He Wuzhou, will He Wuzhou still have the mood to be loyal to this foolish Emperor Chongzhen?"

"Truly experts at internal strife, amateurs at external struggles!"

Li Zhuoxian continued, "Huang Shijun's resume is even more dazzling. A native of Shunde, Top Scorer (*Zhuangyuan*) in the Dingwei examination of the thirty-fifth year of Wanli. He served successively as Right Vice Minister of Rites, Right Vice Minister of Personnel, and Minister of Rites. Currently, he has been appointed Grand Secretary of the East Pavilion, entering the Grand Secretariat to participate in state affairs. However, this person did not maintain his integrity in his later years. After the Longwu regime was destroyed, he defected to Li Chengdong and shaved his hair and changed his clothes."

Mu Min's professional sensitivity allowed her to immediately discover an interesting point, saying, "All three have served as Right Vice Minister of Rites. That's really interesting."

Li Zhuoxian explained, "The Ministry of Rites is a department gathering Hanlin Confucian ministers. The Ming Dynasty has no Prime Minister. The Grand Secretaries of the Grand Secretariat who participate in state affairs are mostly selected from the Ministry of Rites. Qian Qianyi, Zhou Yanru, He Ruchong, Wen Tiren, Zheng Yiwei, Xu Guangqi—these people were all conferred titles of the Ministry of Rites. You can understand it as a reserve team for Grand Secretaries."

Lin Baiguang said, "From the chart, it can also be seen that the Senate has already become a core node on this relationship network. It can be said that we are related to the entire Ming officialdom from the capital to the localities. Our every move will have an impact within the Ming official-gentry group."

Li Zhuoxian said, "Correct. Never think that Lingao is still shrouded in a thick fog of war to the Ming officialdom. Holding this idea will make us suffer. Chen Zizhuang is a high official in the capital, and his roots locally are no worse than Huang and He. He is an in-law to the Zhu clan of Jiujiang. His cousin Zhu Baolian studied under Li Yingsheng, one of the 'Later Seven Gentlemen of Donglin.' He and Liu Dalin are *jinshi* of the same year. He is a poetry friend of Chen Shiji. His relationship with Hainan gentry is closer than Huang and He. The gentry group centered on him also has an unusual relationship with Yuan Chonghuan. They once collective saw off Yuan Chonghuan, leaving behind a famous literary work 'Picture and Poems of Farewell Banquet for Yuan Chonghuan Supervising Liao in Dongguan.' There are fifteen historical figures in the 'Picture and Poems.' Among them, Deng Zhen, Li Yunlong, and Liang Ji all served as Yuan Chonghuan's staff successively. Han Nuan came from the Han clan of Boluo. Although he wasn't very famous historically, the Han clan is a veritable prominent family locally. His juniors Han Ruhuang and Han Ruyan later followed Chen Zizhuang to raise troops against the Qing. His contemporary Han Rizuan rose to Minister of Rites and Vice President of the Veritable Records Institute for two reigns, dying in office in 1635. The famous Huang Daozhou studied at the Han clan family school in Boluo for two years when he was fourteen and was an initiated disciple of Han Rizuan. Han Rizuan served as the examiner for the Metropolitan Examination twice; Hong Chengchou, Huang Daozhou, Ni Yuanlu, and Qu Shisi were all his disciples. Huang Zongxi's father Huang Zunsu also honored him as a 'Teacher on the Seat.' Qu Shisi was Qian Qianyi's student. Qu was on good terms with Jesuit Giulio Aleni, was baptized into the church, took the name Thomas, and was a fellow believer with Xu Guangqi, Li Zhizao, Sun Yuanhua, etc. He must know the Senate quite well. Li Suiqiu's father Li Mi was also one of the fifteen people in the 'Picture and Poems.' Li Suiqiu is Chen Zizhuang's student, a rising star in the Lingnan literary world, and has a very close relationship with Zhang Pu of the Fu Society. He can even be linked to the Guanning Army; Li's examiner teacher Li Mo once saved Zu Dashou's life deeply in Liaodong. What you wouldn't expect is that Chen Zizhuang and Han Rizuan share a common friend, Zhang Xuan. This person was also good friends with Matteo Ricci, so he should also know our situation through the Jesuits."

Mu Min teased, "Senator Li, if you sort down this web, I'm afraid even the Chongzhen Emperor can be related to us. By the way, I really forgot, our Master Gao, Gao Ju's connections go through to inside the Palace. Maybe the *Yangcheng Daily* and *Lingao Times* have long been in Chongzhen's Imperial Study. Stored in the inner treasury are our melamine plastic bowls, and the Emperor drinks Gushiwushuang [Unrivaled Scholar wine], hahaha..."

"Hehehe..." Li Zhuoxian also laughed. "Jokes aside for now, the locals in this chart, the Ou clan of Shunde and the Ou clan of Gaoming, are also worth noting. Among the fifteen people in the 'Picture and Poems,' Qu Huainian's father Qu Daxiang and uncle Qu Dalun were both *jinshi* and selected as Hanlin Bachelors. Qu Huairui was his brother, and along with Qu Huainian and Ou Biyuan, was a member of the 'Twelve Masters of Nanyuan.' The Qu Huainian brothers later also participated in the anti-Qing movement. Ou Biyuan was the grand-nephew of Ou Daren, one of the 'Later Five Masters of Nanyuan,' and along with his cousin Ou Zhuyu, was also a member of the 'Twelve Masters of Nanyuan.' Ou Biyuan was a classmate of He Wuzhou and Li Sunchen. Li Sunchen rose to Minister of Rites in Nanjing and died in office in 1634. Ou Biyuan's sons Ou Chongxian and Ou Sixian later followed Li Suiqiu and died in battle in Ganzhou."

"Birds of a feather flock together indeed. They are all tough bones."
