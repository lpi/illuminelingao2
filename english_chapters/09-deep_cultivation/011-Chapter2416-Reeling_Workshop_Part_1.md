# Chapter 2416: Reeling Workshop (I)

"This is the *Zhudie Mu* (Beater Stick), used to guide the reed," Chen Lin didn't know what this Australian woman was thinking and introduced.

At the tail of the jacquard loom was the warp beam, used to roll silk threads. In the middle were two *Zhudie Mu* for beating the weft, vertically passing through two wooden sticks about four *chi* long. The two ends of the wooden sticks were inserted into the reed.

"This *Zhudie Mu* appears plain and unremarkable, but it is a crucial component," Chen Lin continued. "Its purpose is to beat the weft. By adjusting *Zhudie Mu* of different sizes and weights, one can regulate the magnitude of the tangential force component and weave various fabrics: for weaving light and thin silk fabrics like *Sha* and *Luo*, the weight should be light. Conversely, it should be heavier. A single Flower Loom being able to weave endless varieties of silk fabrics all depends on this *Zhudie Mu*."

Li Yao'er nodded silently. Such a large machine actually relied on the manpower of two workers to operate. Although the products made were exquisite, the production efficiency was also too low. In the past, she read the history of silk development, which said that places like Suzhou and Hangzhou produced hundreds of thousands of bolts of silk annually, but then thinking about it, these major silk weaving towns had tens of thousands of looms. That is to say, each loom only produced a few dozen bolts per year.

After viewing the Grand Flower Tower Loom, Li Yao'er took Chen Lin to "Workshop Two." This workshop was converted from the original wing rooms and part of the courtyard, used for centrally arranging "Waist Looms." The twenty waist looms that Fenshenghe originally owned scattered in various places were all consolidated and placed here. The original ceiling height of the wing rooms was not as high as the main house where the Flower Tower Looms were installed, so skylights were added during the renovation to increase light. In the absence of industrial lighting, natural light was utilized as much as possible.

Seeing such a renovation, Chen Lin was quite puzzled. Centralized layout looked impressive, but he didn't think it had any practical significance. But since the Chief made such changes, there must be a reason. Never questioning elders to their faces was something Chen Lin had always been praised for as a "virtue," so he naturally remained silent at this moment.

"These are what the workers call Waist Looms," Li Yao'er said. "Why are they called Waist Looms?"

"Chief, please see that wide leather strap. When weaving, the worker wears it around the waist. When weaving, the power comes entirely from the waist and hips, hence the name Waist Loom."

Chen Lin said this was a new loom that had only appeared in the last decade or so. It couldn't weave complex patterns and could only be used to weave *Juan*, *Chou*, *Luo*, and the like with simple patterns that didn't require jacquard. However, the weaving speed was fast, and product quality was good.

"I see it has some similarities to the cotton cloth looms in Hainan."

"The Chief speaks correctly. Waist Looms can also be used to weave kudzu cloth, hemp cloth, and cotton cloth, and the cloth woven is neat and fine, with a solid texture and luster. It is a very useful loom. It's just that it's not yet widely used. If I were to open a cotton weaving workshop, I would use all this kind of Waist Loom."

"Oh? You've also thought about opening a textile factory?" Li Yao'er became interested.

Chen Lin secretly thought he had let slip! But thinking again, it didn't matter to tell the Chief; he just shouldn't reveal the key person, his cousin-uncle.

"Yes, this small one heard in Guangzhou that the Senate has a policy encouraging everyone to open cotton spinning factories, helping to provide equipment and technology, and even managing sales. I thought that there are many sandy fields here, and there are quite a few farmers who grow cotton. With existing weaving workshops and looms, wouldn't opening a cotton spinning factory achieve twice the result with half the effort?" He sighed. "Unexpectedly, Father met with misfortune, and the village was also looted. If the Chief hadn't come to take over Fenshenghe, this weaving workshop would probably be in a sorry state. So I dared not think about it anymore."

"Your idea is not bad." Li Yao'er's heart suddenly stirred.

Her focus in coming here for silk industry improvement was still on the two links of raising silkworms and reeling silk. Weaving was not the emphasis. Because currently, outsiders were more concerned with raw silk production rather than producing various colorful satins.

In terms of patterns and colors, the aesthetic tastes of various countries differed greatly. Back when other countries had not yet mastered sericulture techniques, silks exported from China to Byzantium and Persia were mostly unraveled into threads and then re-dyed and woven. In Ming and Qing silk exports, raw silk also held the primary position.

Therefore, whether it was the foreign trade or industrial departments, there wasn't much interest in improving satin weaving. Naturally, Li Yao'er couldn't get many resources either.

Although ultimately through the efforts of the foreign trade department, she obtained some resource investment and also got Fenshenghe, in the field of weaving, she could only make do and improve existing equipment. This was also why she was so interested in Fenshenghe.

The textile department under the Senate's industrial system was originally a neglected weak unit. Over the years, apart from setting up a textile factory in Qiongshan and Lingao each specifically for special textile products, there were no other textile enterprises. The varieties produced by these two factories were quite numerous, involving clothing, household, industrial, military, and shipping areas, but all products were internally allocated with no external sales. Cotton cloth for civilian use was all obtained from the Great Ming or India.

It was only recently that the Planning Agency launched the "Textile Promotion Act" as part of the "Industrial and Commercial Promotion Act," opening it to private capital in the Two Guangs region.

Although encouraging private capital investment, apart from money, private capital had to rely on the Senate for equipment, technology, and technical workers. Since encouraging cotton spinning, resources inevitably tilted towards the cotton spinning field. The resources the silk weaving industry could get became pitifully few. Among the new textile equipment mass-produced by the Bairen Machinery General Factory, only reeling equipment made the list; satin looms only had a few prototypes made and some upgrade kits for old-style machines.

However, these pieces of equipment all required external power without exception. They were not like Flower Tower Looms or Waist Looms that could be driven by workers treading with feet, throwing with hands, or exerting waist and hip strength. External power equipment had to be used.

Steam engines were out of the question. In the factory construction technical guidance plan given by the Planning Agency for cotton textile factories, water-powered machines were recommended.

Water-powered machines not only had much greater output power than animal-powered or wind-powered machines, but the output power was also stable, very suitable for scaled machine production. The first to achieve industrial production in the British Industrial Revolution were water-powered textile factories.

But its problems were also obvious. It required certain water flow conditions: it had to be close to a river with sufficient water volume; secondly, the investment was large. Using water-powered machines required a large amount of construction work.

Given the current priority level of the silk weaving industry in the Planning Agency, it was impossible for Li Yao'er to get a corresponding power equipment quota and investment, so upgrading equipment could only be a pipe dream. Even the higher-priority reeling machines could only use the foot-pedal basin-beating machines used in Hangzhou.

If this young Chen wanted to open a cotton spinning factory and could pull it off, he could apply for a water-powered machine quota. Then those retrofit parts and samples that were limited by lack of power could all be put into use.

Thinking of this, Li Yao'er immediately became energized and asked probingly, "Your idea is very good! However, opening an Australian-style cotton spinning factory is a big business. Not a single inch of cloth is woven, but the investment is already thousands upon thousands. Can you find the capital?"

"At the beginning, naturally it can't be that big. There are quite a few cotton-growing households locally. Let's first open a yarn spinning factory, spin the yarn and sell it to the textile factories in the prefectural city." When his cousin-uncle talked to him about opening a textile factory, he had already thought through the key points. There were many sandy fields in the Xiangshan area, and many people grew cotton. Cousin-uncle had also bought many sandy fields to prepare to grow cotton himself. The cotton supply should be no problem. First get the yarn factory up and running—since everyone was opening textile factories, demand for cotton yarn would be great; this business could be considered a sure profit without loss.

"As for capital, indeed this small one miscalculated. After being looted by the chaotic soldiers, there's nothing to count on." He deliberately sighed.

"Didn't expect you to be quite smart." Li Yao'er nodded approvingly. She already had her calculations in mind, but just as she was about to speak, she held back. She and this young Chen had only met on the first day. She still knew little about this person's specific situation and background. The factory matter could take its time; no need to rush. First see what this person was made of.

Beside the second courtyard, there were east and west side courtyards. Now the east courtyard had been converted by Li Yao'er into a reeling workshop, prepared to install the same equipment "Jiqi Dajie" (Steam-powered Reeling Machine) that was used in the small reeling factory at Hangzhou's Phoenix Villa. The entire workshop was arranged according to the training workshop model from back then. For this purpose, a boiler was specifically introduced to provide hot water and steam for reeling.

However, in terms of scale, this was much smaller than the training workshop reeling section in Hangzhou, with only a mere one hundred workstations. Any bigger, and the existing boiler couldn't supply it.

"This is an Australian-style reeling room," Li Yao'er said.

Chen Lin looked at this completely transformed reeling workshop with some surprise. He saw this workshop was like other workshops, with ventilation windows on both sides of the walls and skylights on the roof. Only the walls and ceiling were crisscrossed with various pipes and valves—what were all these?

These pipes were each connected to the reeling workstations. Here, like the training factory in Hangzhou, improved foot-pedal reeling machines were used. Foot-pedal reeling machines existed in the Ming Dynasty and were not anything new. It was just that the reeling machines made by the Lingao Machinery Factory had many mechanical improvements, with many components made of metal and bearings installed on rotating parts, so the rotation was smooth and use was more flexible.

However, Chen Lin immediately noticed the differences. First was the stove basin beside the reeling machine—it had changed.

Traditional Chinese reeling techniques had undergone multiple improvements. By the Ming Dynasty, two reeling methods had basically formed.

One was called the "Fire Silk Method," also called the "Hot Cauldron Method." The process was to use one large pot for both cooking cocoons and reeling silk. The pot was placed directly on the stove, with a silk reel installed horizontally above the pot. When reeling, the water temperature was extremely high, which could increase the amount of cocoons cooked in a short time. At the same time, by adjusting the water temperature, thick and thin silk could be reeled. Roughly speaking, for reeling thick silk, the water temperature should be high; for reeling thin silk, the water temperature should be low.

The advantage of the Fire Silk Method was high efficiency in cooking cocoons and fast reeling. However, because reeling was fast, it was not easy to control the thickness of the silk output, and quality was not ideal. Therefore, it was gradually replaced by the Cold Basin Method.
