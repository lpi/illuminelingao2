# Chapter 2638: Rapid Gun Squad

Although having magic arts leaning on body, Li Guangyuan also read books for a few years, knew since ancient times never had achieving career by magic arts. Whether early years' Taiping Dao, or recent White Lotus Sect, no matter how clamoring for a time when uprising, like violent wind torrential rain, finally were all result of defeat.

Although Li Guangyuan thought what he did was exerting effort for Great Ming "Orthadoxy," using such strange power chaos spirits to rise matters, his heart still felt lacking confidence.

Australians' big cannons fast guns, they all saw before. Therefore he often mumbled in front of Luo Hetu, saying if own family could have so a few would be good.

This matter hit Luo Heying's bosom exactly. Then he immediately arranged Luo Hetu to purchase guns. Only then had this transaction.

"Just this rapid gun too expensive. Fifteen guns, thousand bullets wanted two hundred taels silver." Listening to Luo Heying's words, Li Guangyuan couldn't help flesh hurting again. Two hundred taels silver only bought these few. Kun Thieves were rapid gun for every hand.

"If Nanyang Gun, let alone extremely hard to get, even if can get, outside market price is thirty Yuan for one, not matching bullet medicine yet." Luo Heying said, "Wanting to achieve big matter not sticking to trifles, moreover not sparing money goods body family. At that time you Master hold high Banner of Righteousness to Serve King (*Qin Wang*), waiting until Celestial Troops recover Guangzhou, this bit money counts as what?"

He instigated Li Guangyuan many times to destroy family to relieve national crisis, taking all money out to purchase weapons, recruit sturdy men, training an elite of several hundred people. Once uprising, Li Guangyuan leading those "Divine Soldiers" of Eight Immortals Society to fight hard with Kun Thieves, he and nephew could use convenience of commanding to swallow the team.

Although news transmitted by Walrus Monk said Court would send Grand Army South Expedition soon, at that time inevitably attacking into Two Guangs with force of thunderbolt, plowing court sweeping holes—Kun Thieves' days not many. Words although so, Luo Heying also knew this matter feared not so simple. Mere a Jiannu (Manchu), Court fought for ten twenty years also defeated more won less. Commander Xiong in Two Guangs was also complete defeat on ground. How could see once South Expedition Grand Army arrived Kun Thieves would "Fly Ash Annihilate Smoke"?

Spending Li Guangyuan's money, pulling his Luo Family's team, this was Luo Heying's wishful calculation. At that time Court Grand Army winning naturally not need say, discussing merit rewarding naturally not lacking own family; if South Expedition not smooth, Court ate defeat, he having this troops, Court would also heavy use him.

Where did Li Guangyuan know his calculation. Hearing him advising not to heartache money, immediately smiled bitterly: "Not hiding from Worthy Brother, I here eating fingers (dependent people) numerous, family burden very heavy. Also inside outside this many clan relatives to take care. Now training Rural Braves, already income not covering expenditure. I although have heart wanting to buy more, really can't take out this much money."

Finished speaking, he both heart-achingly and cherishingly looked at these bird guns, as if looking at a pile of treasures. Suddenly he asked: "This bullet medicine only one thousand, finished fighting on battle array what to do?"

"No harm. Gun bullets we ourselves can also smelt. Just fire cap is made by secret method. At that time only buying fire cap is fine. Can save quite a lot. Furthermore on this battle array, whether Official Army's bird gun or Kun Thieves' rapid gun, at most shooting seven eight times. Now one gun matches eighty rounds bullet medicine, fighting ten battles綽绰有余 (more than enough)." Luo Heying pretended not minding said, "Besides this rapid gun is only used to disturb Kun Thieves at far distance. Truly wanting to break Kun still ask Fairy Huang to cast spell, Rural Braves invincible to knife gun, rubbing body close combat. Only need close body, Kun Thieves' gun also can't fire. Kun Thieves people few. Rural Braves even several fighting one also always can win."

Speaking of Fairy Huang's magic arts, Li Guangyuan seemed having confidence again, "Fairy Huang said this talisman water refining is very not easy. Between slow urgent don't know if can use up."

Luo Heying cursed in heart this "Fairy Aunt" still playing mystery to get money. He could only say:

"Talisman water used at time of breaking formation frontally is fine. Just need someone charging to Kun Soldiers close body, remaining is easy to resolve."

"Recently village came Kun Thieves' Puppet Troupe—don't know if heard any wind sound." Li Guangyuan worried somewhat.

Luo Hetu also felt this Puppet Troupe came strangely. He ran outside these few days. Yesterday heard nephew coming back soon so came to Li Family Enclosure. Once entering village met Walrus Monk sending people, warning him to be careful. Village had Kun Thieves' spy moving.

Coming not only Puppet Troupe, also Tian Family's woman whereabouts unknown early days. Originally thought she was abducted and sold. Few days ago suddenly came back again. Not only attire brand new, bringing many new gadgets back, also said many good words of Kun Thieves in village, advising village women to weave mats to sell together, engaging in some "Mat Weaving Society," very suspicious.

Momentarily he also couldn't judge intention of Puppet Troupe, even didn't know intention of this Tian Family woman. Pondered for a while said: "Right now we better careful as top—still follow Walrus Monk's arrangement as old, not showing mountain not revealing water, outer loose inner tight. Look at situation then say!"

Li Guangyuan nodded saying: "Opening Altar Cultivating Magic these things now stopped. But these things in village are known to everyone. Village people mouth not tight, unavoidable leaking out."

"Leaking some out also no matter. Opening Altar Cultivating Magic worshiping god doesn't violate law. You here also no violation objects. Kun Thieves aren't most stressing Handling According to Law? Without true proof real evidence they won't do how." Li Guangyuan comforted, "Truly knew something, sent troops over long ago. You just rest heart!"

Li Guangyuan hearing him say so, slightly relieved heart. Luo Heying continued saying:

"This Xiaoyao Market is a vital place. I prepare to set an Ear Eye there. In past few days I personally go to explore and make an arrangement. Only say relative of Brother Li family, buying land opening shop on market as Ear Eye. This matter still ask Master Li to help, hire a reliable person as guide."

Opening shop in Xiaoyao Market, this was matter he and Walrus Monk discussed for very long. Here was not only local traffic thoroughfare, portal of Kun Thieves entering exiting; More importantly, not long ago, a "Police Station" of Kun Thieves established on market, came five policemen stationed usually.
 
Kun Thieves past arriving Xiaoyao Market just passing road. Now already infiltrated tentacle into here. Couldn't not pay more attention.

"This matter easy. Tomorrow I find a person familiar with Xiaoyao Market to come listen to your order." Li Guangyuan hearing his arrangement proper, mood settled greatly. Asked about training matters of this Rapid Gun Squad for a round again, then returned to Inner Residence.

Luo Heying returned to Side Courtyard he lived. Luo Hetu then greeted up, spoke once in detail things seen on escort journey with Luo Heying. Luo Heying finished listening, played with bought Rapid Gun for a while again. This indeed was Folangji Rapid Gun Walrus Monk brought last time.

This kind of rapid gun was just starting to appear recently. Because trafficked from Folangji people hands, so named. Said to be not up not down (on par) with Kun Thieves' rapid gun.

He once secretly test fired this kind of rapid gun. Made comparison with Nanyang Gun trafficked by Kun Thieves. Simply on power, loading speed etc. various aspects two rapid guns were roughly equal (*Bo Zhong*). But Nanyang Bird Gun gun body more exquisite light skillfully, and more sturdy: Nanyang Gun after firing ten-plus times, except gun tube heating, no other change. And this Folangji Rapid Gun muzzle, gun body appeared obvious swelling. Shooting accuracy also dropped a lot. In comparison, Nanyang Gun only gun barrel swelled slightly. Accuracy could still maintain.

Looking from appearance Nanyang Gun's gun barrel tight fit seamless, hun ran one body (integral), didn't know how Kun Thieves made out; In contrast, Folangji Gun was generally same two (identical) as Bird Gun used by Official Army. Gun barrel had seam not say, still had several hoops.

Even though Luo Heying didn't understand smelting manufacturing, could also see manufacturing level of two had huge gap. Could only say this Folangji Rapid Gun was most sharp firearm besides Kun Gun. Having it, at least could fight frontal battle with Kun Thieves.

They already secretly collected some Nanyang Guns, but quantity truly limited. This Rapid Gun Squad wanting to form shape, still had to continue hoodwinking big households to take money out.

He instructed to Luo Hetu: "Master Li now organizes Rapid Gun Squad. You are Instructor. Remember must grasp this Rapid Gun Squad firmly."

Luo Hetu followed Clan Brother fought San Liang, had intuitive knowledge on Kun Soldiers. Immediately couldn't help asking: "Big Brother, no matter how train no more than fifteen rapid guns. Plus what we have in hand, no more than twenty-plus. That Kun Thieves are everyone having. Also already trained for long time. This Rapid Gun Squad trained better, Kun Thieves' large troop arriving also not useful. Besides Kun Thieves also have various big cannons..."

Luo Heying smilingly looked at Luo Hetu issuing complaints. Wait until he finished speaking, only then said: "These ten-plus rapid guns naturally not useful. But, we are not wanting to duel with brilliant army by imposing formation. As long as you train this Rapid Gun Squad well, beat Kun Thieves painful, beat out fame, let those people still watching carefully look, Kun Thieves also not Three Heads Six Arms, battle without not winning. As long as they have confidence, joint force destroying Kun together, we then have winning chance."

He sighed a breath, said again: "Even if failing this time, as long as we can protect this Rapid Gun Squad, in this chaotic world then have capital to settle body establish life! Maybe Court hears these news, also will have people coming to verify. At that time a round of operation, maybe can also have an official status!"

"Official or not indifferent. I just want to follow Uncle, kill a few more Kun Thieves, good to revenge hate of breaking family destroying door."

Hearing Luo Hetu mentioning blood hate of breaking family destroying door, Luo Heying couldn't help gritting teeth creating creaking sound. Silent for half晌 (half a while), Luo Heying only suppressed hate in chest, said: "Tricks played by these side doors left paths of Eight Immortals Society, although momentum huge, no more than fooling ignorant men. Whether can fight over Kun Thieves still two says; Even Court South Expedition's Grand Army, also not necessarily can count on. You must drill this Rapid Gun Squad well. Don't spare money goods, thickly bind people's hearts!"

"Yes!" Luo Hetu low voice answered.

Saying he slowed a breath, "This way coming you are also hard working. These few days Li Family Enclosure handles Temple Festival Opera. You also relax well for a few days. Temple Festival Opera finishes, Rapid Gun Squad will start training. At that time how to pick people, plan well again."
