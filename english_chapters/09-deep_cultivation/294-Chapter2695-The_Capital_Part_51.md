# Chapter 2695: The Capital (Part 51)

"Yes, Mr. Zhou often says one should never complicate simple matters."

At present, Jieyi had merely fallen out of favor temporarily; she hadn't lost all hope. If another woman were brought into the household, the Zhou family's situation would become thoroughly entangled. Should the newcomer prove even more troublesome and Jieyi find herself completely cast aside, any future conflict would be far more difficult to resolve.

Wang Yehao studied his face for a long moment before speaking. "Well said. You've grown considerably these days."

"All thanks to Master's guidance."

"I understand. You may go."

Neither he nor Wang Yehao could have anticipated that such a domestic affair would eventually brew into a momentous transformation.

This boudoir farce finally subsided under Zhou Lezhi's vigorous mediation. After several days, Jieyi's exile came to an end. With Master Wang personally intervening to broker peace, she kowtowed before Mr. Zhou to acknowledge her fault, and the matter was considered settled. From that point forward, Jieyi no longer dared invoke the principle of "first through the door holds seniority," and could only submit to Yourong's authority.

Mr. Zhou also temporarily abandoned his notion of acquiring additional women to enrich the rear house. Clearly, this incident had taught him an invaluable lesson: the inner chambers are not always harmonious, and he did not possess the commanding authority to enforce peace.

Zhou Lezhi felt the Teacher was fundamentally a conflicted man. He possessed every capability to be a "Master," yet insisted on embodying his conviction that "all are equal."

With the household in turmoil and the Kun growing ever stronger, Hearthstone Daoist's excursions diminished significantly. Though he didn't confine himself entirely to Zhaoqing and occasionally traveled through the Jiangnan region—particularly to the "Farm" in Dongyang—most of his time was devoted to writing books and instructing Zhou Lezhi.

These days, he rarely taught specific subjects. More often, he focused on shaping his student's "worldview"—a term the Teacher himself had introduced.

"Australian learning is as deep as the ocean; even I possess but a single drop. What I can teach you probably doesn't amount to even a molecule of water..." The Teacher sighed with feeling. "The only thing I can truly impart is a method of thinking."

...

He glanced at a bamboo chest in the room. Inside lay manuscripts he had recently composed, written based on the learning the Teacher had passed down.

The Teacher's own writings were now all stored at the Dongyang Farm—still Zhou Lezhi's most precious inheritance. These years, consumed by the struggle against the Kun, he'd had no time to take on disciples. He could only set down the knowledge his Master had taught him, along with his own understanding, whenever spare moments allowed.

Each time he reflected on the Teacher's various stratagems, how could he not recognize that his own contest against the Kun was merely a mantis trying to stop a chariot? "Knowing it cannot be done, yet doing it anyway."

He recalled words the Teacher had once spoken: Though the fall of the Great Ming was the inevitable trend of the times and nothing to mourn, he was unwilling to let the Kun win too easily.

"The Kun arrived here bearing technology that spans eras, bullying the weak with overwhelming strength. They act without restraint, treating common people as disposable straw dogs. If we allow them to seize this country with ease, what road to survival will the common people have in times to come?"

At this point, the Teacher had sighed softly. "I know this burden weighs heavily upon you. Whether you bear it or not lies entirely with you. I will never blame you..."

"If you are willing to shoulder this burden, come to my room tomorrow night at the second watch. I will pass on to you all the secrets of the 'Heavenly Book.' But once you know them, I fear you can never again stand apart from these affairs, nor can you live out your days in peace."

...

This burden now rested upon his shoulders.

Zhou Lezhi released a long sigh. He stared at the solitary lamp flickering like a bean in the room. The current Great Ming, as the Master had put it, had reached the point where the oil was exhausted and the lamp was guttering. Even without the Kun, little lifespan remained. To launch a military campaign now—if defeated, the consequences would be far graver than mere loss of army and territory. The Roving Bandits of the Central Plains, the Jianzhou Captives of Liaodong—all would pour through the breach. The Jiangshan and Sheji of the Great Ming would face imminent peril.

Kidnapping Senator Leng had been, in truth, their small faction's desperate gamble. How laughable that Master Wang still dreamed of manipulation and maneuvering, hoping to use this affair to control the Court situation, harboring delusions of entering the Cabinet as a Minister to prop up the Great Ming.

"Sir." A voice called his thoughts back from memory to the present.

"What is it?"

"Daoist Jinshi has arrived."

"Show him in."

Jin Wenchi's face bore a faint look of worry. Kidnapping Leng Yuning was a perilous gambit. Should they lose control, the Stone Old Man faction would very likely suffer a hundredfold retaliation—one need only look at the Zheng family's fate to understand.

"Daoist Master..."

"Sit."

Jin Wenchi was one of the Stone Old Man faction's principal advisors, his standing second only to Zhou Lezhi, who had inherited the identity of "Hearthstone Immortal."

He differed from the Liu brothers—those two harbored doubts about Zhou Lezhi's succession, given his youth. But Jin Wenchi was different. Before Zhou Lezhi inherited the mantle, he had worked alongside the young man on various affairs and engaged in numerous discussions. He knew that Zhou Lezhi's vision and depth were beyond ordinary comparison. Though his learning fell far short of his Master's, his shrewdness and his decisive yet cautious approach to matters surpassed even the Master himself.

"Daoist Master, word has come from outside. The Kun in the capital are mobilizing troops and forces to search for Bandit Leng's whereabouts. With their capabilities, it won't take long to uncover clues... Should we relocate quickly?"

"The storage location shouldn't be moved; moving leaves traces. They failed to find it at the outset—finding it now won't come easily either. Their massive search is meant to pressure us into transferring, thereby revealing our vulnerabilities."

"But... what if they find it? Should we send more men?"

"Gathering so many people in one place will draw notice sooner or later." He pondered for a moment. "We shouldn't add manpower. Instead, we can deploy decoys." He then explained his ideas in detail.

"...Do you think it will work?"

"It should work, but the decoys might draw fire back upon ourselves. We must use people who have no connection to us."

"Leave that to the Liu brothers. They can handle it."

"Daoist Master..." Jin Wenchi showed no intention of leaving, speaking again.

"What does Sir wish to say?"

"Sir's goal is to force the Kun to negotiate peace. But what if the Kun insist on going their own way?"

"Mr. Zhou told us long ago that the Kun's Senators are incomparably precious to them. The Kun will absolutely not risk placing a Senator in mortal danger."

"No matter how precious, surely it's merely the rank of a Prince in our Great Ming. During the Tumu Crisis of this Dynasty, when Yingzong was captured in the north, the Court did not necessarily negotiate peace with the Oirats. The Kun are said to have five or six hundred Senators. When national policy is at stake, how can they yield so easily?"

"Sir, on this point you are mistaken." Zhou Lezhi shook his head. "The Kun's Senators are not 'Princes,' but 'Parliament Members.'" He knew it would be difficult to explain what a Parliament Member or Parliament meant, or what an Aristocratic Republic was. When the Teacher had first taught him, he too had thought it mere fantasy.

Seeing Mr. Jin's bewildered expression, he considered his words carefully. "That is to say, a Senator is essentially like an Emperor... Each Senator possesses the authority to participate in political deliberation. If a colleague falls into danger and the power-holders Bandit Wen and Bandit Ma fail to rescue him with all their might, they themselves cannot continue to hold power."

"So they have no choice but to save him."

"Precisely."

"But Sir, the current mood at Court favors a campaign against the Kun. We speak of negotiating peace, yet the Court wants to send troops. How can we win their trust?"

"The Court's desire to send troops stems from unavoidable circumstances. Even the Emperor sometimes finds himself without choice."

Regarding this matter, Wang Yehao saw more clearly than any of them. Though the Emperor's calculated maneuvers couldn't be spoken of openly, one point was beyond doubt: the Emperor's proposal of the Southern Expedition itself contained an element of ambivalence. As for the ministers at Court, they viewed the prospect even less favorably.

Whether belonging to the "Pro-War Faction" or the "Pro-Peace Faction," most had probably realized that the Southern Expedition could not solve the problem of the Kun. "Advocating Suppression" or "Advocating Appeasement" were essentially pretexts for political struggle within the court hall.

"Could it be..." Jin Wenchi's eyes widened slightly with surprise.

"Precisely so." Zhou Lezhi lowered his voice. "If they negotiate appeasement without a fight, where is the Court's dignity? So this battle must be fought. But you and I both know—once weapons are raised, those who suffer are the common people. The Court's strength will be spent in vain. The Great Ming is already deficient in both qi and blood; it can no longer withstand further losses..."

"I understand!" Jin Wenchi nodded. "No wonder the court ministers speak of appeasement in private circles, yet argue passionately for suppression in the court hall."

"Court ministers and Emperor alike all face their own difficulties." Zhou Lezhi sighed. "If we can hold Leng Ningyun as hostage and force the Kun to proactively seek peace, we can avert this war. Then the Great Cause can be planned at leisure."

"Preserving vitality must be our foremost priority."

"Exactly so." Zhou Lezhi said, "If we can turn spears and halberds into jade and silk—if we can live peacefully with the Kun—perhaps the nation's fortunes might even take a turn for the better."

"What if the Emperor refuses to allow it?"

"That matter will depend on the Master's diplomatic maneuvering. What the Emperor fears most is Court Discussion. As long as the consensus holds that appeasing the Kun is benevolent governance, he will naturally follow good counsel like water flowing downstream..."

"So that's how it is!" Jin Wenchi nodded repeatedly, praising: "Though Sir is young, your insight into the Court situation is penetrating and clear. What a waste that I served as Lord Wei's advisor for more than ten years!"

"Lord Wei was a man of public justice who appointed the upright; he handled affairs with rigid integrity. As his advisor, Sir naturally would not—and disdained to—employ such stratagems." Zhou Lezhi replied. "But in the current age, to accomplish upright things, one must plot in the shadows like demons and ghosts. Otherwise, forget accomplishing anything—even self-preservation becomes impossible."

These words not only justified their various actions but indirectly flattered Jin Wenchi, putting him at ease. He hastened to demur: "You flatter me. I've merely been scraping by in this world."

"How fares Miss Wei's situation?"

"She sent word that the Hengshan Sect lost many disciples in the Lingao Campaign. It's difficult for them to send reinforcements now. If pressed, they can only spare three or four people."

"What about the other sects?"

"They've also agreed to send people, but the situation is similar to Hengshan Sect. Two or three, perhaps four at most."

"That they can send anyone at all is good." Zhou Lezhi said. "Has the silver been distributed?"

"Liu Zhao has already allocated it."
