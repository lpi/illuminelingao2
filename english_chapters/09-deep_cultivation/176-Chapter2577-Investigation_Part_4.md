# Chapter 2577 - Investigation (Part 4)

Treatment for female pseudohermaphroditism generally involves drugs plus surgery. Currently the children were too young for surgery. The common drug treatment regimen used cortisone-type drugs to suppress excessive pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion and prevent further masculinization and premature epiphyseal closure.

"Subsequent corrective treatment requires cortisone-type drugs—these are currently Level 1 controlled substances, only available at Bairén General Hospital's pharmacy," Zheng Mingjiang said. "Let's write a report to admit all the affected children and transfer them to Bairén General Hospital for treatment. Honestly, I'm not very familiar with pediatrics and endocrinology—let's have Dr. Ai and Dr. Shi consult."

"We're of the same mind," Lin and Fu agreed. "Remediation is still possible now. This affects people's entire lives—we can't delay."

Zheng Mingjiang suddenly remembered something: "Did they catch the person selling the fake medicine?"

"Not yet, but the identity is known—a midwife," Lin Motian said. "Police have staked out her home. As soon as she returns, they'll arrest her."

In the past two or three years, Guangzhou's police agencies had already cracked multiple cases of various traveling doctors swindling people under the name of "Australian miracle drugs." So they were quite experienced handling this case. Through questioning victim families, police quickly determined the true identity of the woman selling "Australian fetus-changing medicine"—a local midwife. After the Joint Midwifery Clinic opened and required midwives to work with certification, she didn't get certified and had been secretly delivering babies in the countryside. She conveniently leveraged her long-established connections from years of midwifery to peddle this "miracle drug."

By the time police came looking, the midwife had already disappeared. But through interviews, police learned she had likely gone to Huizhou to stock up, so the case was transferred to the joint investigation team for further handling.

"She also went to Huizhou! How strange. Could Huizhou have become the birthplace of Australian miracle drugs?" Zheng Mingjiang was puzzled. But thinking further, the Luofu Mountain medicine market was renowned as one of the four great markets under heaven—all kinds of medicines were distributed there. "Miracle drugs" concocted with "Australian drugs" probably weren't exceptions.

Zheng Mingjiang now had a premonition: the Senate's drug leakage problems probably weren't the one or two holes they'd originally thought, but rather a sieve.

Returning to the office, Zheng Mingjiang hurried to read the report Fu Qiliang had given her. She noticed it mentioned that the affected children's families all reported that during pregnancy, the expectant mothers had used "fetus-changing medicine."

According to their accounts, the "fetus-changing medicine" was medicinal wine in a porcelain bottle, claiming that rubbing it on the pregnant woman's belly would "change yin to yang."

Needless to say, this mysterious medicinal wine definitely contained testosterone. That's what had caused nearly twenty infants' genital malformations.

"How ignorant and crazy!" Zheng Mingjiang sighed. But she was helpless—never mind the 17th century, in the old timeline people similarly sold male hormones to pregnant women as fetus-changing drugs, causing fetal malformations.

Concepts that decades of the People's Republic couldn't change—the Senate couldn't hope to change either. The only solution now was to cut off the source, Zheng Mingjiang thought.

Fortunately, this stuff wasn't urgently needed medication. As long as the production stage controlled the raw materials and sales strictly controlled prescription rights, it could largely be controlled. The advantage of small usage and few applications was that it was easy to verify quantities at every stage. Compared to antibiotics, it was much easier to control.

So where was it currently leaking from? Zheng Mingjiang was somewhat puzzled. From the documents, the "fetus-changing medicine" appeared as "medicinal wine." This indicated the forger had certain pharmacological knowledge of testosterone drugs. Because directly taking male hormones orally carried considerable risk, potentially causing kidney failure and other side effects, injection or external application was mostly used instead. She'd seen the trial drugs sent to the pharmacy—all gel preparations, also marked "oral consumption prohibited."

The drug faker was probably quite familiar with Australian drug usage and contraindications, which was why they'd changed the gel packaging to medicinal wine form, to avoid deadly lawsuits.

Considering everything, the possibility of leakage through pharmaceutical factory channels was very small. Zheng Mingjiang knew the general level of current pharmaceutical factory workers. They only knew how to produce according to process procedures—they were completely ignorant about drug properties and pharmacology. At most they knew what a drug did, but were mostly unclear about contraindications and usage methods.

This meant the person leaking drugs to make fake medicines should be a medical or pharmaceutical worker.

Suddenly she thought of the "fetus-changing pills" she'd purchased in Foshan—those weren't medicinal wine! What if they contained testosterone? Zheng Mingjiang broke into a cold sweat. If a pregnant woman actually swallowed those, wouldn't it kill both mother and child?

At this thought, she hurriedly found a box of "Fetus-Changing Pills" from that cabinet of drugs, crushed them, and after some operations examined them under the microscope.

After a long while, she breathed a slight sigh of relief: these fetus-changing pills contained no purified chemical crystalline substances—all were fragments of various traditional Chinese medicines. Though she couldn't be one hundred percent certain, they most likely didn't contain testosterone.

So then—these fetus-changing pills sold everywhere on the streets and that fetus-changing medicinal wine weren't the same thing? Zheng Mingjiang's head started to ache. She'd originally assumed there must be some connection between the two, but now it seemed one was fake medicine and the other was a knockoff of fake medicine. Apart from both claiming to have "fetus-changing" miraculous effects, they probably had nothing to do with each other.

Never mind—better go to Huizhou first to investigate. Compared to this inexplicable fetus-changing medicine, the antibiotic problem was obviously more pressing.

But how to start once in Huizhou? Huizhou's situation was much more complicated than Danzhou. Danzhou was just a "prefecture," but Huizhou was "Huizhou Prefecture" with ten subordinate counties. Located on the critical East River route, it was the "key town of Eastern Guangdong." It had always been the political, economic, military, and cultural center of the East River basin and a commodity distribution center. In ancient times it was called "Famous Prefecture of Lingnan" and "Gateway to Eastern Guangdong." It was also a Hakka stronghold, called one of the "Four Hakka Prefectures." Here there were not only Hakka but also large numbers of Cantonese and Chaoshan people, plus Yao people in the mountains. The complexity of the situation was far beyond what Guangzhou and Foshan could compare to.

Though Huizhou had been listed as a priority governance zone due to its geographical position, this priority governance was probably far inferior to Foshan and Guangzhou. If Zheng Mingjiang took a few investigation team members there, people would probably know as soon as they entered the prefectural city.

If it were an ordinary case, going to Huizhou wouldn't be so sensitive. But the drug leakage case obviously involved naturalized citizens whose understanding of the Senate far exceeded ordinary people. As soon as she appeared in Huizhou, various demons and monsters would probably go into hiding...

But not going to Huizhou and entrusting some naturalized citizen—she really couldn't set her mind at ease. After much deliberation, she went to see Wu Mu to seek his opinion.

"My personal opinion is you shouldn't go to Huizhou—the commotion would be too big." Wu Mu was also straightforward. "When an Elder moves, security work has to be arranged; the locality also has to arrange reception. If the other side is paying attention, before you've even left Guangzhou, Huizhou will have gotten word. Once the enemy hears an Elder from the health sector is coming—no matter what pretext you go under—as long as they're not idiots they can guess."

"That's what I was thinking too." Zheng Mingjiang nodded repeatedly. "But if I don't go, I'm not at ease. This drug-related stuff is quite specialized..."

"We've been in this timeline for almost ten years now, haven't we? Some things should be left to naturalized citizens to do. Are we going to handle everything ourselves forever?" Wu Mu said. "My suggestion is you can select one or two naturalized citizen cadres whom you trust and who understand the specialty. The three-person team I originally assigned you stays as is. Just use Cheka's name—they already have a flying inspection system. Suddenly landing in Huizhou to check ledgers and such wouldn't attract attention."

"Your idea is good. Let me think about it." In an instant Zheng Mingjiang had already run through several names of local health sector cadres in her mind. The health sector was different from other departments—because of the strong specialty and involvement in personal safety, almost all workers had been trained in Lingao. Even if Zheng Mingjiang didn't know them, their faces were familiar.

"But this person should preferably have some distance from health sector people, otherwise they'd easily be recognized." Wu Mu said. "Moreover, he should preferably be Cantonese—whether Chaoshan, Hakka, or Cantonese—that way going to the Huizhou medicine market for undercover investigation wouldn't attract attention."

After much thought, she suddenly thought of a suitable candidate—and this person was already in Huizhou.

"I have someone. Though he's in the health sector, he's currently in Huizhou, presently directing all of Huizhou's medical work. Since he's already in Huizhou, just giving him a document can let him join the investigation team's work without attracting others' attention."

This person was actually one of her students—young and talented. Originally she'd planned to invest effort in cultivating him at Bairén General Hospital. Unfortunately, current social conditions meant male obstetrician-gynecologists were difficult for people to accept, and demand for neurologists was also quite limited. After much thought, she could only send him on external assignment to Guangdong for practical experience, training him as a general practitioner.

"Just one person isn't enough. Can you add one more?"

Zheng Mingjiang thought it over and came up with another. In terms of qualifications, he did meet all of Wu Mu's requirements, but this person was too old, always had a pedantic scholar's manner, and was basically an outsider professionally. Oh well—choosing the tallest among the short—he'd do!

"Old Yuan!" A young man with a satchel rode a bicycle, wobbling along the newly-laid cinder road, and braked sharply to a stop in front of a middle-aged man approaching elderly.

This middle-aged man wore a half-new, half-old indigo "cadre uniform," with a fountain pen symbolizing status and culture tucked in his breast pocket. He held a roll of documents in his hand, gesticulating and loudly shouting something. It was none other than Yuan Shuzhi, who had passed as number one in the Municipal Comprehensive Governance Bureau sanitation specialist examination back then.
