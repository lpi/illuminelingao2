# Chapter 2655: The Capital (Part 11)

Assistant Managers Xiao and Wei were whispering in a corner. although they were also Naturalized Citizen cadres, they were not "Lingao Cadres" but recruited in Jiangnan and Guangdong, so their "will was somewhat not firm." Although they didn't doubt the strength of the Senate, being in a dangerous situation now, they wavered somewhat. To be honest, they didn't quite believe Wu Kaidi could come up with a suitable method, but the thought of fleeing had vanished without a trace under Liao Sanniang's fierce gaze. Currently, their mood was mostly "resigning to fate."

While the group harbored different thoughts, Wu Kaidi returned. Assistant Manager Xiao hurriedly asked, "How is it? What is Head Constable Qi's regulation?"

Wu Kaidi said, "He came to notify us that witnesses are to be detained for court appearance tomorrow, and we need to prepare the witnesses. I can't run away; I must go to court tomorrow..."

Assistant Manager Xiao said uneasily, "You are now the backbone of Delong. What if you get detained?" As he spoke, both Assistant Managers showed panic on their faces.

"It doesn't matter." Wu Kaidi sat down and took a sip of tea. "Head Constable Qi said a total of ten people need to be detained. As long as we appear in court personally once tomorrow, there just need to be ten people in the detention cell afterwards. Just remember to be available on call during interrogation."

Saying this, he took out a list. The first name on it was astonishingly Wu Kaidi. Next, besides Hexiang, the two Assistant Managers and several usual backbones of Delong and servants who often handled affairs for Leng Ningyun were all listed.

Assistant Manager Xiao said, "That's what is said, but what if it's a fishing trap to trick us all there and catch us in one net..."

Manager Wei shook his head and said, "Why go to such trouble to catch us in one net? Shuntian Prefecture Yamen could have taken us all just now—could it be you can still run away?"

"Correct," Wu Kaidi said. "There is no need for Head Constable Qi to deceive us. He has sold us a big favor."

With this favor, Wu Kaidi had some confidence in asking the government to "seal" the shop next. Actually, he had already negotiated the price with Head Constable Qi just now: a total of eighty taels of silver as "hardship fee," plus thirty taels of silver for the "substitute" fee for ten people. Head Constable Qi would handle the relevant witnesses.

This was considered giving a lot of face, especially being able to use substitutes, which was a huge help. Wu Kaidi knew that without the tacit approval of Judge Liu or even Prefecture Yin Zhong, Head Constable Qi would definitely not have given this favor.

The crowd discussed countermeasures again, especially how to answer after going to court tomorrow. Wu Kaidi's suggestion was to tell the truth; except for matters involving the Australians, everything else could be said.

"...Actually, our knowledge of this matter is limited, so just answer whatever Judge Liu and the others ask. As long as it doesn't involve the matters of the Senate, there is no need to deliberately conceal anything."

Assistant Manager Xiao said apprehensively, "This... will torture be used during the court session?"

Wu Kaidi smiled bitterly. "You elders rest assured. I will naturally bribe Head Constable Qi's side. Even if torture is used, they won't let you suffer! It's just that this matter must be resolved as soon as possible. Otherwise, if the Emperor gets interested one day and wants the Eastern Depot or Embroidered Uniform Guard to 'ask carefully,' once we enter the Northern Prison of the Imperial Guard, then truly even immortals can't protect us..."

These words made Assistant Manager Xiao's face turn pale, and Manager Wei and the others also showed uneasiness one by one. Li Rufeng looked at Wu Kaidi with dissatisfaction, thinking *it's pointless for you to scare people like this!* Immediately, he coughed and said, "We just need to clarify the matter as soon as possible. Everyone should go back to doing what you should do; don't let your thoughts run wild."

After speaking, everyone dispersed. Li Rufeng, Liao Sanniang, and Wu Kaidi did not leave; there was currently one urgent thing to do: rescue the *Biao* [target/person].

That Senator Leng had been kidnapped was a certainty. Hoping for the government to rescue him was wishful thinking; they could only rely on Delong itself.

"I propose asking Headquarters for help in this matter," Wu Kaidi said. "It concerns a Senator; we cannot be negligent."

"I don't oppose asking Headquarters for help, but even if Headquarters can send people, they won't arrive for ten days. This matter can't wait that long." Li Rufeng said, "Better to rely on ourselves than on others. We should find the person as soon as possible."

Wu Kaidi only felt that what was in front of him was a tangled mess, and he couldn't see a clue at all. Now that he was somewhat flustered, he had to nod in agreement.

Liao Sanniang pondered briefly and said, "Mister Wu, can the people who serve Master Leng personally be called for questioning?"

"This is easy. Hexiang and Yanhong are both in the inner residence. It's just that his original personal page boys and guards were all killed..."

"Apart from the two of them, make a list of anyone who could approach and serve Master Leng. We will check them one by one." Liao Sanniang said, "I'm afraid there was an insider assisting in this matter."

Wu Kaidi was startled and stammered, "You mean..."

"What I said is what I mean. Delong likely has an insider." Liao Sanniang had actually suspected this at the crime scene. To accurately ambush Master Leng on the official road, it couldn't be done without obtaining news in advance. Moreover, to lure Master Leng out of the city, I'm afraid there was also an insider assisting.

The ones with the greatest suspicion of being insiders were naturally the people around Leng Ningyun.

"Miss Hexiang should be..."

"There is no 'should be'," Liao Sanniang interrupted Wu Kaidi. "In my opinion, her suspicion is the greatest."

Li Rufeng held the same view. Immediately, the three called Hexiang and other inner residence close personnel one by one for questioning, focusing on whether Leng Ningyun had any abnormal conditions in the last few days.

This questioning indeed revealed clues.

It wasn't that they found who was most suspicious, but Hexiang and several others who could serve personally usually all reported that Master Leng had been preoccupied with worries in the past few days. When writing the report last week, he hesitated for a long time, putting down the pen and picking it up again, writing and then burning it. This made Hexiang, who was waiting to translate it into cipher, very surprised, because this kind of weekly report was mostly routine. Even if there was important news to ask for instructions and report, he wouldn't be so hesitant when writing the report.

"...Do you know what he was writing?"

"I don't know," Hexiang shook her head. "Originally, our rule is not to ask much when the superior writes the telegram draft, and to translate it only after it's finished."

"When did he start having things on his mind? Are there any remnants of the burned drafts?"

"No, according to the rules, they must be cleaned up completely." Hexiang also knew that the Chief's hesitation was likely related to the disappearance, so she tried hard to recall. "The worry started last Saturday. I don't know exactly what it was about. Originally, Yanhong was called to serve in bed that night, but in the evening, he instructed that it was not necessary."

"And then?"

"Then he called me over," Hexiang said. "I thought..." As she spoke, a blush suddenly flew onto her face. "He gave me a telegram draft and told me to translate it into a telegram immediately and send it out..."

"Did you see any words or phrases on the telegram draft?" Li Rufeng pressed.

"I didn't even have time to open it and look before he took it back and burned it in front of me." Hexiang said she was greatly surprised at the time. Such a thing had never happened before—the disposal of telegram drafts had always been her responsibility; Senator Leng had never burned a telegram draft himself.

"...By the way, although I didn't see the text of the telegram draft, the marking on the cover was 'Red Telegram'."

"Red Telegram" was the highest level in the Senate's telegraph official document system, requiring communication personnel to deliver the telegram to the recipient at the fastest speed.

The three looked at each other. Obviously, the content of this telegram draft was no small matter. However, since he was so anxious, why did he burn it again?

In the following days, Leng Ningyun seemed unable to extricate himself from the cycle of writing and burning telegrams. This continued until the night before his disappearance.

"...Was there anything strange about him the night before?"

"If you talk about strangeness, there wasn't any. I just felt that the person became very excited, and he even gathered the two guards and page boys for a meeting..."

"Are there meeting minutes?" Wu Kaidi pressed.

"No." Hexiang shook her head. "Even I wasn't allowed to enter during the meeting. It seemed they were preparing for something important."

The attendees, except for Master Leng himself, had all become cold corpses now and could say nothing. Li Rufeng suddenly thought of a terrible reality: these two guards, like him, were each issued two revolvers. The firepower was very impressive.

If they carried weapons, and the enemy set an ambush on the official road, yet could easily kill these two guards... moreover, judging from the scene, neither guard showed signs of firing. There were no cartridge cases at the scene, nor were there traces of gunpowder on their fingers and sleeves...

Li Rufeng felt the burden on his shoulders becoming heavier. He inhaled lightly and pressed, "Do you know what Senator Leng and the others brought when they set off?"

"I don't know about this. He didn't mention his going out to me from beginning to end." Hexiang said, "But checking the exit record will naturally show it."

Wu Kaidi immediately brought out the exit record. The items Leng Ningyun carried on the day he went out were impressively registered. Not only did both guards carry revolvers, but even the page boys and the coachman were equipped with weapons. Obviously, he went prepared.

Since he foresaw danger in the meeting, why didn't he notify Heliansheng? The three people looked at each other in dismay.

Liao Sanniang said, "If only we knew what Master Leng saw that caused him to have things on his mind."

"In my opinion, nine out of ten it was a letter." Wu Kaidi pondered. "Master Leng rarely goes out and doesn't meet outsiders casually. Let's check the letter registration log."

Upon checking, a total of twenty-six letters were sent to Leng Ningyun's study on Friday. Because the registration log listed information such as the sender, they quickly found the suspicious letters: two letters marked "No Sender."

"These two anonymous letters were sent from the counter of Delong Bank." Li Rufeng frowned. "I'll ask the fellows who delivered them..."

"Are the letters still there?" Liao Sanniang asked.

"Not in the archives." Hexiang shook her head. "There is no filing number on this, nor a submission date—Master Leng simply didn't hand the letters over."

Needless to say, the letters were either destroyed or he had hidden them secretly.
