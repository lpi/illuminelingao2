# Chapter 2460 - Manager An

"Whether it is Ming cloth, or cloth from the Eastern Ocean, Western Ocean, or Southern Ocean, none have a width as large as this Australian cloth."

Hand-woven fabrics were limited by the reach of human hands, so the width was generally relatively narrow. Narrow width didn't seem to be a big problem for making clothes, but for making large items such as sheets, bedding, flags, and banners, it would increase a lot of workload.

"...Could this be cloth woven by machine? Such width is not what human power can do."

"Guest is indeed an insider!" The shop assistant nodded repeatedly, "These are all Australian machine-woven cloths."

"These machine-woven cloths aren't many, are they? I rarely see them on the mainland."

"Guest is right; they are indeed rare." The shop assistant chatted congenially. Seeing the visitor's bearing and conversation were like a colleague from the mainland, he invited the manager of the counting house to meet him.

The manager was surnamed An, over forty years old, with a chubby middle-aged face that made people happy upon seeing. The two exchanged greetings and exchanged a few pleasantries. Following the principle of "speak only thirty percent to people," Chen Lin only said he came from Guangzhou for the first time to purchase goods. Manager An immediately invited him to the counting house to "serve tea."

Chen Lin saw it was still early, and being invited by a local merchant was a good opportunity to understand the local situation, so he readily agreed.

The two sat down in the counting house. A helper brought tea. They exchanged names and chatted about market conditions. Chen Lin talked about some textile market conditions and news in Guangzhou, and then talked about the local situation.

This Manager An was very talkative and spoke about the local fabric market clearly and logically.

It turned out that retail in Lingao's textile market was not as finely divided as in the Ming era. Although there were "Silk Shops" specialized in selling silk, "Patterned Cloth Shops" specialized in selling cotton cloth and cotton, and various names like "Velvet and Satin Shops," more were "Fabric Shops" that distributed all kinds of fabrics. "Ruihexiang" managed by Manager An was an all-encompassing "Fabric Shop."

"...I dare not say for the whole of Hainan, but to say in Lingao locally, the only one who can have more complete fabric patterns and colors than me is the Mall of the Cooperative General Society—even Friendship Department Store may not have as complete goods as mine. Just take my shop sign; it was written personally by an Elder." Speaking of this, the manager's pride was palpable.

*No wonder the characters on the shop sign have the form but scattered spirit,* Chen Lin complained secretly, *This writing is not even as good as Father's.*

The content Ruihexiang dealt in ranged from silk, cotton cloth, linen, woolen cloth... all the way to "Banana Cloth," a specialty of Hainan Island with extremely small production; it included everything. In terms of product categories, it could truly be counted as comprehensive.

However, from the sales perspective, such a wide variety of fabrics were mostly just "foils"; not much was sold throughout the year. The bulk sales were mainly concentrated on cotton cloth, linen, and woolen cloth; silk sales were very small.

"...Local commoners are mostly uninterested in silk." Manager An said, "Sales are not even a fraction of various cloth types."

"Could it be the price is too expensive?"

"No, no." Manager An shook his head repeatedly, "Although the local area doesn't produce silk, plenty of silk is imported from various places, so it's not rare." He casually quoted the retail prices of several common varieties—although Lingao calculated in "meters," Chen Lin quickly calculated and converted them into tailoring feet in his mind. The prices were almost the same as on the mainland.

"Prices are almost the same as on the mainland..."

"Although the retail price is the same, after all, it is transported from afar, so selling a silk bolt here actually earns less than in Guangzhou; it's just to complete the variety."

"Since the price isn't expensive, why doesn't everyone buy it?"

Manager An said this was a complicated story. In terms of Lingao's total population and the "middle-income" group capable of purchasing silk clothing, Lingao's silk retail sales should not be lower than Guangzhou's. However, this group, originally the main force of silk consumption, was mostly naturalized citizens "eating Australian rice." Because Elders advocated "simplicity," the clothes naturalized citizens wore on weekdays were mainly made of cloth or wool, and silk clothing became unpopular.

"Presumably little brother also knows, 'what those above like, those below will follow'. These Elders set an example by not wearing silk clothes, so even those who can afford to buy and wear them gradually become unwilling to purchase..."

"Yes, I also heard people say this in Guangzhou. saying this is called 'trend', also called 'fashion'."

Unexpectedly, these two Australian terms learned and sold immediately from Li Yao'er made Manager An look at him with new eyes instantly.

"I didn't expect Brother Chen to have studied Australian learning too!" His tone was quite appreciative.

"Dare not, dare not, I was also instructed a thing or two by an Elder."

"Being instructed by an Elder is a great blessing." Manager An nodded repeatedly, "Exactly, it is this fashion trend. Australians like to use Westerners' woolen cloth to make clothes, so it became popular locally. As soon as the weather gets cold, everyone wears woolen clothes..."

So silk sales in Lingao were truly pitiful. Manager An said if not for quite a few big households migrating from outside who still had the habit of wearing silk, sales would be even worse.

"Fortunately, among Australians, there are also Elders who like silk. The special supply channel can still sell a lot every year. It is said that several female Chiefs are engaging in 'Improved Traditional Clothing' and have released some brand new styles. If they can wear them first, this silk material will sell much better, at least local little women will follow and learn..."

Speaking of here, Manager An smiled subtly. Chen Lin was somewhat baffled and asked again:

"Fabric shops here are very few; I wonder why?"

"Lingao commoners mostly buy ready-made clothes and rarely make clothes themselves or hire tailors." Manager An said. Although Lingao had a large population, most were naturalized citizens "eating Australian rice." They either worked in factories and farms or worked in various organs. Their clothing focused on simplicity and durability. Australians ran their own garment factories, mass-producing this kind of ready-made clothing to supply the market.

"When they make clothes, it's not one by one, but thousands and tens of thousands. Buying material in bulk is originally cheap, and machines are used to make clothes in the factory: cutting is one person, sewing is another person, opening pockets and nailing buttons is yet another person. Holding machines, the work is done in an instant... A few thousand clothes can be made casually in a day. calculated by piece, labor cost is equal to zero. So the price of these ready-made clothes is extremely low. Which ordinary commoner would still go make clothes? So tailors can't muddle along without excellent skills."

"Then, doesn't it mean fabric shops all have to do bulk business?"

"Haha, little brother speaks correctly!" Manager An nodded, "In Lingao, if a small fabric shop relies only on market retail, it can scrape by. If it's a big shop like ours, we must have bulk business from big customers."

Customers were naturally garment factories. Fabrics imported from various places were traded in the trading market at the port, and fabric shops went there to bid in bulk.

"The materials Australians used in the past were all transported by themselves, or bought directly from foreign merchants. In recent years, they began to change to purchasing from local fabric merchants."

This was fresh. Chen Lin thought, *Australians are most adept at trade; clearly they can buy the lowest-priced fabric directly from sea merchants. Why let wholesale merchants change hands to earn the price difference? Could there be some trick in this?*

But this question couldn't be asked; he could only hide the doubt. While talking, suddenly there was a commotion outside, seemingly someone talking loudly. Just as Manager An was about to inquire, a helper entered the counting house, his face full of nervousness.

"What is it?"

"People from Master Qu's family have come..."

Manager An frowned and immediately stood up: "I'll go have a look." After speaking, he turned to cup his hands to Chen Lin: "Sorry! Something happened in front; let me go deal with it first..."

Chen Lin estimated it was getting late, so he hurriedly stood up and said: "It's getting late. Manager, please go busy yourself. I will come to disturb you another day."

Manager An didn't ask him to stay either, saying: "Although it's the first time meeting little brother, we feel like old friends at first sight. Since so, please come to talk again when you have time another day!" After speaking, he took out a calling card from the box on the table.

"This is my calling card. If you have any difficulties, bring the card to the counter to find me."

Chen Lin accepted the calling card and thanked him repeatedly. Manager An couldn't care about politeness, lifted his robe, and walked out.

Two people came into the shop hall, a master and a servant, both in Ming old attire. The leading master was aggressive, quite looking like he was here to inflict punishment. Two shop assistants bowed repeatedly to greet him but couldn't quell his anger.

Chen Lin thought, *Could there be some business dispute?* He heard the master say angrily: "The person ran away while buying things in your shop! She is unfamiliar with the place here; if not for your abduction, how could she run away? Now my master says, you must hand over the person whether you hand her over or not!"

The assistant who greeted Chen Lin just now smiled apologetically: "Master Xia! Your insight! We can't be blamed for this matters. Fifth Concubine came to choose material, and the shop understands the rules of big households. Assistants avoided her according to custom, letting her master and servant choose, and reply after choosing. No one expected she would climb the window and run! Besides, Fifth Concubine had a maid beside her, and following servants and cart drivers outside. So many people didn't watch her closely; her running away can't be blamed on the small shop..."

Hearing this, Master Xia flew into a rage, reaching out with a slap directly, hitting the shop assistant so hard he turned around and almost fell to the ground, staggering before barely standing firm. Then came a backhand slap, knocking him to the ground.

"What thing are you! Daring to argue right and wrong with this Master, you are rebelling!" After speaking, Master Xia shouted at the servant: "Are you dead? Beat him hard for me!"

The servant rolled up his sleeves and was about to act when Manager An shouted loudly: "Stop!" After speaking, he rushed out urgently.

Arriving in the shop hall, seeing the beaten assistant still on the ground, he instructed: "Help him to the back and ask a doctor to look at him!" Waiters helped him up. After speaking, he turned and cupped his hands to Master Xia, saying: "Master Xia! I wonder where the small shop has offended your respected self to actually hit people?"
