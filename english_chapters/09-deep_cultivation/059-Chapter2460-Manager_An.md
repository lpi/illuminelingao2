# Chapter 2460 - Manager An

"Whether it's Ming cloth or cloth from the Eastern, Western, or Southern Oceans—none have a width as large as this Australian cloth."

Hand-woven fabrics were limited by the reach of human arms, so the width was generally quite narrow. Narrow width didn't seem a major problem for making clothes, but for large items like sheets, bedding, flags, and banners, it greatly increased the workload.

"...This must be cloth woven by machine? Such width is beyond human capability."

"The guest is indeed an insider!" The shop assistant nodded repeatedly. "These are all Australian machine-woven cloths."

"These machine-woven cloths aren't common, are they? I rarely see them on the mainland."

"The guest is right; they're indeed rare." The shop assistant, finding a congenial visitor whose bearing and conversation suggested a colleague from the mainland, invited the counting house manager to meet him.

The manager was surnamed An, over forty years old, with a chubby middle-aged face that made people happy at first sight. The two exchanged greetings and pleasantries. Following the principle of "speak only thirty percent to strangers," Chen Lin said only that he'd come from Guangzhou for the first time to purchase goods. Manager An immediately invited him to the counting house to "serve tea."

Chen Lin saw it was still early, and being invited by a local merchant was a good opportunity to understand the local situation, so he readily agreed.

The two sat in the counting house. A helper brought tea. They exchanged names and discussed market conditions. Chen Lin talked about some textile market conditions and news in Guangzhou, then asked about the local situation.

Manager An was very talkative and explained the local fabric market clearly and logically.

It turned out that retail in Lingao's textile market wasn't as finely divided as in the Ming era. Though there were "Silk Shops" specializing in silk, "Patterned Cloth Shops" specializing in cotton cloth and cotton, and various names like "Velvet and Satin Shops," more common were "Fabric Shops" that carried all kinds of fabrics. "Ruihexiang," managed by Manager An, was an all-encompassing "Fabric Shop."

"...I dare not speak for all of Hainan, but locally in Lingao, the only one with more complete fabric patterns and colors than mine is the Cooperative General Society Mall—even Friendship Department Store may not have goods as complete as mine. Just take my shop sign: it was written personally by an Elder." Speaking of this, the manager's pride was palpable.

*No wonder the characters on the shop sign have form but scattered spirit,* Chen Lin thought privately. *This writing isn't even as good as Father's.*

Ruihexiang dealt in everything from silk, cotton cloth, and linen to woolen cloth and even "Banana Cloth," a Hainan Island specialty with extremely small production. In terms of product categories, it could truly be called comprehensive.

However, from a sales perspective, such a wide variety of fabrics were mostly "foils"—not much sold throughout the year. Bulk sales were mainly concentrated on cotton cloth, linen, and woolen cloth. Silk sales were very small.

"...Local commoners are mostly uninterested in silk," Manager An said. "Sales aren't even a fraction of various cloth types."

"Could the price be too expensive?"

"No, no." Manager An shook his head repeatedly. "Though silk isn't produced locally, plenty is imported from various places, so it's not rare." He casually quoted retail prices for several common varieties. Though Lingao calculated in "meters," Chen Lin quickly converted them to tailoring feet in his mind. The prices were almost the same as on the mainland.

"Prices are almost the same as on the mainland..."

"Though the retail price is the same, after all, it's transported from afar, so selling a bolt of silk here actually earns less than in Guangzhou. It's just to complete the variety."

"Since the price isn't expensive, why doesn't everyone buy?"

Manager An said this was a complicated story. In terms of Lingao's total population and the "middle-income" group capable of purchasing silk clothing, Lingao's silk retail sales shouldn't be lower than Guangzhou's. However, this group—originally the main force of silk consumption—were mostly naturalized citizens "eating Australian rice." Because the Elders advocated "simplicity," the clothes naturalized citizens wore daily were mainly cloth or wool. Silk clothing had become unpopular.

"Presumably you also know: 'what those above like, those below will follow.' These Elders set an example by not wearing silk clothes, so even those who can afford to buy and wear them have gradually become unwilling to purchase..."

"Yes, I've heard people say this in Guangzhou—they call it 'trend,' also 'fashion.'"

Unexpectedly, these two Australian terms—freshly learned from Li Yao'er—made Manager An look at him with new eyes.

"I didn't expect Brother Chen to have studied Australian learning too!" His tone held real appreciation.

"I don't dare claim that. I was merely taught a thing or two by an Elder."

"Being instructed by an Elder is a great blessing." Manager An nodded repeatedly. "Exactly—it's this fashion trend. Australians like to use Westerners' woolen cloth for clothes, so it became popular locally. As soon as the weather turns cold, everyone wears woolen clothes..."

So silk sales in Lingao were truly pitiful. Manager An said that if not for quite a few wealthy households who had migrated from outside and still had the habit of wearing silk, sales would be even worse.

"Fortunately, among Australians, there are also Elders who like silk. The special supply channel can still sell a lot each year. Word is that several female Chiefs are working on 'Improved Traditional Clothing' and have released some brand new styles. If they can wear them first, this silk material will sell much better—at least local young women will follow and learn..."

Speaking of this, Manager An smiled subtly. Chen Lin was somewhat puzzled but asked another question:

"Fabric shops here are few; I wonder why?"

"Lingao commoners mostly buy ready-made clothes and rarely make clothes themselves or hire tailors," Manager An said. Though Lingao had a large population, most were naturalized citizens "eating Australian rice," working in factories, farms, or various organs. Their clothing focused on simplicity and durability. Australians ran their own garment factories, mass-producing ready-made clothing for the market.

"When they make clothes, it's not one by one, but thousands and tens of thousands. Buying material in bulk is naturally cheap, and machines are used in the factory: cutting is one person, sewing another, opening pockets and sewing buttons yet another. Holding machines, the work is done in an instant... A few thousand garments can be made casually in a day. Calculated per piece, labor cost is virtually zero. So the price of these ready-made clothes is extremely low. What ordinary commoner would still go have clothes made? Unless a tailor has excellent skills, he can barely scrape by."

"Then doesn't that mean fabric shops all have to do bulk business?"

"Ha, you speak correctly!" Manager An nodded. "In Lingao, if a small fabric shop relies only on market retail, it can scrape by. But a big shop like ours must have bulk business from big customers."

The customers were naturally garment factories. Fabrics imported from various places were traded in the port trading market, and fabric shops went there to bid in bulk.

"The materials Australians used in the past were all transported by themselves or bought directly from foreign merchants. In recent years, they've begun changing to purchasing from local fabric merchants."

This was new. Chen Lin thought, *Australians are most skilled at trade. They could clearly buy the lowest-priced fabric directly from sea merchants. Why let wholesale merchants take a cut of the profit? Could there be some trick to this?*

But this question couldn't be asked directly. He could only hide his doubt. While talking, a commotion suddenly arose outside—someone talking loudly. Just as Manager An was about to inquire, a helper entered the counting house, his face full of nervousness.

"What is it?"

"People from Master Qu's family have come..."

Manager An frowned and immediately stood up. "I'll go have a look." Turning to cup his hands to Chen Lin: "My apologies! Something's happened out front. Let me go deal with it first..."

Chen Lin estimated it was getting late, so he hurriedly rose. "It's getting late. Manager, please go attend to your business. I'll come to disturb you another day."

Manager An didn't ask him to stay, saying, "Though it's our first meeting, little brother, I feel we're old friends at first sight. Since so, please come to chat again when you have time!" He took a calling card from the box on the table.

"This is my card. If you have any difficulties, bring it to the counter and ask for me."

Chen Lin accepted the calling card and thanked him repeatedly. Manager An couldn't bother with more politeness, lifted his robe, and walked out.

Two people had come into the shop hall—a master and servant, both in old Ming attire. The leading master was aggressive, very much looking like he was here to inflict punishment. Two shop assistants bowed repeatedly to greet him but couldn't quell his anger.

Chen Lin thought, *Could there be some business dispute?* He heard the master say angrily, "The person ran away while buying things in your shop! She's unfamiliar with this place—if not for your abduction, how could she have run? Now my master says you must hand over the person, whether you like it or not!"

The assistant who had greeted Chen Lin earlier smiled apologetically. "Master Xia! Please understand! We can't be blamed for this. Fifth Concubine came to choose material, and the shop understands the rules of big households. Assistants avoided her according to custom, letting master and servant choose, and to reply after choosing. No one expected she would climb out the window and run! Besides, Fifth Concubine had a maid beside her, and following servants and cart drivers outside. So many people failed to watch her closely—her running away can't be blamed on this small shop..."

Hearing this, Master Xia flew into a rage, reaching out with a slap directly, hitting the shop assistant so hard he spun around and almost fell, staggering before barely standing firm. Then came a backhand slap, knocking him to the ground.

"What thing are you! Daring to argue right and wrong with this Master—you're rebelling!" Master Xia shouted at his servant, "Are you dead? Beat him hard for me!"

The servant rolled up his sleeves and was about to act when Manager An shouted, "Stop!" and rushed out urgently.

Arriving in the shop hall and seeing the beaten assistant still on the ground, he instructed, "Help him to the back and have a doctor look at him!" Attendants helped the man up. Turning to cup his hands to Master Xia, he said, "Master Xia! I wonder where this small shop has offended you that you would strike people?"
