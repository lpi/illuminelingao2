# Chapter 2685: The Capital (Part 37)

"The Master wants to seize his family's property?"

"If the Qiankun Mirror is obtained, what are these properties worth mentioning? Just probing the bottom first. You send a message to Liu Sha, saying weapons and soldiers are approaching; find a way to search for the treasure."

Since the plan was set, there should be no delay. Immediately after returning to the residence, Wang Yehao called Jin Wenchi to arrange two tasks. One was an invitation to Tian Hongyu, inviting him to go to the Lantern Festival lamp viewing together; the gift list accompanying the invitation specially listed a pair of Australian glazed glass cups. The other was a reply to Wang Zunde, saying Viceroy Xiong [Xiong Wencan] pacified the Zheng family and settled the seas of Fujian and Zhejiang, for which the Emperor was quite appreciative. In comparison, the ocean surface of Liangguang was full of group bandits rising everywhere; there were even thieves occupying a county for two years without leaving. If Lord Wang still had no achievements, probablly the court discussions would be unfavorable to him.

Sending away Wang Yehao, Mr. Zhou didn't go back to the courtyard to play with snow but sat blankly alone in the room. Seeing the Teacher lost in thought, Zhou Lezhi went up and whispered: "Teacher! Should these precious vessels be put away and given to Jieyi?"

This sound woke him up like from a dream. The Teacher gave an "En" and said: "Don't give them to Jieyi for safekeeping; store these things in the study."

"Wait!" Zhou Lezhi was just about to tidy up when the Teacher stopped him again. He walked to the table alone and carefully examined these few "rare goods."

He picked up a fruit-plate-like glass vessel and whispered: "Ten yuan." Then picked up a powder box, looked carefully, and muttered: "Ivory [fake?]"; finally picked up that wine bottle clear as water, studied it for half a day, looked at the cap on top again, shook his head, and put it down.

"You look; what problems do these things have?" The Teacher suddenly asked Zhou Lezhi.

Zhou Lezhi picked them up carefully to examine for a while: "Made really well; not done by clumsy hands."

"Fart!" The Teacher sniffed disdainfully. "How did I teach you to look at matter?!"

"Yes, yes," Zhou Lezhi hurriedly looked again and said, "This glass vessel is transparent throughout, but there are a small number of air bubbles inside the vessel, indicating limited degassing technology..."

"Correct."

"Glass is pure and clear, decolorization technology is relatively good, but still has relatively obvious green color, indicating the raw material contains iron, and decolorization during smelting was not thorough."

"Precisely speaking, it is ferrous iron [divalent iron]." Mr. Zhou corrected.

"Yes," Zhou Lezhi was still a mess of confusion regarding concepts like monovalent and divalent, so he could only agree casually at this moment.

"Material spoken well. What about shape?"

"The surface has marks left during demolding, indicating this plate was cast using a mold. Possibly an iron mold."

"En," Mr. Zhou seemed satisfied with his answer. "If you were to do it, assuming all conditions are met, could you make glass vessels of similar level?"

Zhou Lezhi thought for a moment: "Cannot. There are too many processes inside that I don't know."

Mr. Zhou nodded: "Very good. Regarding glass making processes, I also only know one or two things; I understand the principles, but really doing it involves too many details that need study. Here, craftsmen regard these craft technologies as secrets not to be passed on..."

"But technology needs exchange to progress." Zhou Lezhi hurried to repeat the words the Teacher had said countless times.

"Exactly so." Mr. Zhou's interest in talking seemed very high today. "Why is everyone unwilling to disclose?"

"Master, teaching the apprentice starves the master..." Zhou Lezhi blurted out only to realize this was extremely inappropriate, after all, their relationship was securely master and apprentice.

"Hahaha, what you said is not wrong. In the 17th... now, teaching the apprentice will starve the master. So whether apprentices or various workshops, all view their craft as a secret, absolutely not teaching it easily, let alone disclosing it." Mr. Zhou said, "Then tell me why such a situation appears?"

"Because... originally only a few families could do it. If everyone can do it, it won't be valuable."

"Do you say this glass vessel is good or not?"

"Of course good. Beautiful and clean. Good for holding anything; once dirty, wash with water and it's clean."

"It has many other benefits."

"Corrosion resistant, aging resistant..." Zhou Lezhi had been accompanying the Teacher to fiddle with the laboratory recently; his ears had grown calluses hearing glass's advantages.

"With so many benefits, logically everyone should like to use it. Why does no one use it?"

"Few. Expensive."

In the following half an hour, Zhou Lezhi listened to a class on market supply and demand relationships, gaining a preliminary but comprehensive understanding of concepts like "productive forces," "market," "technological progress," "cost," "profit," etc.

When the Teacher imparted knowledge, he would always start from concrete examples and combine them with reality. Often, things difficult to understand could be explained clearly. This kind of instruction was not limited to class time but happened anytime and anywhere. So learning many courses was not boring at all—even quite interesting.

Sometimes he would also talk about things in "Australia" where he cultivated Dao, including how abundant the productive forces in "Australia" were, everyone could eat white rice, had meat to eat, and lived in big houses... making Zhou Lezhi burst with envy while also suspecting the Teacher was bragging.

However, one point he was sure of: whether everyone in Australia could eat big rice meals was hard to say, but the Teacher definitely ate them every meal. Just looking at the Teacher's fine skin and tender flesh was enough to know—toiling people couldn't have that.

"Teacher, is this object produced in Australia?" Zhou Lezhi asked.

"No." The Teacher answered very crisply. "This object is made right in the Great Ming. If it were an Australian product, it absolutely wouldn't be this rough."

"So speaking, it is Australians manufacturing locally. Maybe right in Guangzhou."

"Your analysis makes sense." A smile appeared at the corner of Mr. Zhou's mouth. "Tell me, if you were an Australian, why manufacture in Guangzhou? Clearly, Australian glass vessels are worthless [cheap], and cost is lower."

"Didn't the Teacher just say? The market price of goods is affected by many factors. Although glass products are cheap in Australia, the transport over thousands of li entails huge water transport fees [freight], plus the round trip takes a year. As the saying goes, tofu becomes the price of meat. Of course, making and selling locally is more cost-effective..."

"Well said." Mr. Zhou nodded, seemingly asking and seemingly muttering to himself: "Wonder where they are?"

"Find that Master Guo, ask and we'll know." Zhou Lezhi suggested. "Even if he refuses to say, these goods can't appear out of thin air; there must be transportation and loading/unloading. As long as we let Big Brother Liu buy more spies to stare outside, finding the source is also easy."

"Hehe, didn't expect your comprehension in this aspect is also good!" Mr. Zhou patted the table lightly. "Let's do this! Us men will go to Guangzhou again as soon as spring starts!"

"He wants to go to Guangzhou?" Wang Yehao frowned slightly after hearing Wang Liang's report.

"Yes, Zhou Lezhi said he prepares to set off when spring warms and flowers bloom. Said at that time he also prepares to ask the Master to allocate a few more people with high martial arts, like the two Liu brothers, to accompany them."

"Understood. You go."

Obviously, this Hearthstone Immortal discovered some clues from *Zizhenzhai*'s vessels, so he was anxious to find Guo Yi and the source of the vessels.

He naturally knew the source of the vessels; it was in Lingao County. But this matter temporarily couldn't be known by him.

In case he found clues in Guangzhou and went to Lingao, obtained the Qiankun Mirror or found Australians to join and return to their country, this greatly useful chess piece would be wasted.

Only by holding the channel of information in his own hands could he effectively control Hearthstone Immortal and make him generate greater value for himself.

Moreover, Wang Zunde had already submitted a memorial to the court, preparing to suppress the shorn-hair bandits in Lingao. If Immortal Zhou went to Guangzhou at this time, with his careless and straightforward way of speaking, he might be caught as a spy. If he really found Lingao and didn't leave in time, he might also die amidst the chaos of soldiers—that loss would be big!

There must be something to trip him up!

What method to use? Wang Yehao thought hard. Persuading face-to-face was definitely not okay; if forbidden forcefully, it would hurt harmony. Best to have some "inevitable" method.

He quietly called Liu Zhao and asked if he had any method—after all, these Jinyiwei investigators were best at manipulating human hearts.

"This is not difficult," Liu Zhao said almost without thinking. "I have a method."

"What method?"

"Simplest really, just needs someone by Hearthstone Immortal's side to do it. Don't know if they are reliable or not."

"Speak without harm."

Thus, a change occurred in Mr. Zhou's "Spring Guangzhou Australian Search Trip" when he was preparing to set off enthusiastically—Zhou Juli suddenly fell ill.

The illness came extremely fast. The day before, Zhou Juli was still walking all over the ground, babbling with a rattle drum, flesh on her face bulging out. The second day, she was actually bedridden, the whole person groggy, seemingly asleep but not asleep.

Seeing the baby daughter fall into lethargy, Immortal Zhou was so anxious he spun in circles, personally accompanying and nursing at the bedside.

Speaking of symptoms, it was truly rare. First, no fever; second, no cough... except for sleeping groggily, there were no other symptoms.

Don't look at how Hearthstone Immortal started his career with the name of "Divine Doctor" and now occasionally treated people with reportedly good effects. But facing his daughter's illness, he was helpless, only anxious enough to spin circles in the room continuously. The Teacher's temper also became irritable. Cursing Zhou Lezhi, cursing Jieyi, cursing maids, cursing Liu Zhao... in short, everyone in the Zhou Residence was cursed by him once.

Under Master Wang's care, several famous local doctors were invited, but they had different rhetorics regarding the illness, and the prescriptions opened also had their own merits. The Teacher originally forbade using any, but unable to withstand Zhou Juli not taking water or rice and her face becoming dimmer daily, he had to order trying.

Quite a few decoctions were drunk. Finally, Zhou Juli's condition gradually improved. Because the body was weak, and doctors were invited to recuperate, the tossing lasted until June. Summer was not suitable for long-distance travel, so the Teacher postponed the plan to go to Guangzhou until autumn.
