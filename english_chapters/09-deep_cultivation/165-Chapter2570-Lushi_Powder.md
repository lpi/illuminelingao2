# Chapter 2570 - Lushi Powder

"The result was I waited a year and the prizes never came. In between I had people ask a few times—they said distribution hadn't started yet. I was too busy to follow up, and only before taking this post did I hear that the organizers had already contacted the winners and all prizes had been distributed. Problem is, nobody contacted me!" Talking about this, Zhang Xiao was half-crying, half-laughing.

As the saying goes, when something abnormal happens there must be something fishy. The group had already sniffed out the unusual. As Marx said, when profits reach 300%, they'll trample on all human laws—let alone when drugs offer ten- or hundred-fold profit margins.

"Should we notify Cheka? Audit is their domain, right?" Lin Motian raised a key question. "Speaking of which, hasn't Cheka discovered problems before?"

"Maybe Cheka isn't familiar with the pharmaceutical sector," Fu Qiliang added. "They might not understand drugs."

"Alright, let's not talk about these killjoy matters. Tonight we discuss only romance, not politics. Come—bottom's up."

"This is a big deal." Deng Bojun said with affected seriousness. "We must get to the bottom of this! So many drugs!"

Though he appeared righteous, Lin Motian knew he was actually grieving for the drugs that had been "skimmed off"—how much more money could have been made!

Though their motives differed, Lin Motian felt the same way. If all this medicine could reach the hospital, it could save so many more lives. Leaking out might also treat illnesses, but without proper diagnosis and treatment courses, used casually as "miracle medicine," sometimes it wouldn't save people—it could even harm them.

"I also think we should investigate this thoroughly. After all, drugs aren't ordinary things—misuse can cost lives."

Zheng Mingjiang pulled out her little notebook and jotted this down. "Alright, I'll investigate. Just sitting idle anyway."

"Do you have the authority to investigate cases?" Lin Motian asked.

"Since it involves drugs, let's tentatively classify it as a fake drug case. Our health department does have police, you know. Sanitary police are under our professional guidance. As a health sector Elder, there's no problem with me leading this case investigation."

"A gentleman's son doesn't sit under crumbling eaves. You're a dignified Elder personally taking charge of a fake drug case—please be careful." Zhang Xiao warned. "Just have Cheka or the police handle this. Isn't it too much fanfare for you to go personally?"

"No, no—this matter probably touches quite a few places. As the aggrieved party, our health sector should send someone to show we take it seriously." Zheng Mingjiang said.

"If we can crack this case, it'll truly be manna from heaven." Deng Bojun was gesticulating excitedly. "Our hospital will be able to save so many more patients!"

"Heh heh."

"Since we're actually not short on drugs, I'll try to apply for an emergency shipment." Lin Motian's emotions were hard to describe. "Speaking of which, a couple days ago Du Yibin sent over a note saying Zhang Jiayu's mother was sick. He'd come to Du for help and wanted me to take a look. I originally said I'd get to it after finishing what was on my plate, but got busy and completely forgot. Didn't expect that in the end the person would go directly to County Magistrate Zhang!"

Zheng Mingjiang nodded: "Right. Go ahead and make an emergency request to Lingao—order a batch under the 'special use' designation. Then have Lingao's pharmaceutical company send us the logistics node information separately. That way we can also see which link has problems and investigate all the naturalized citizens who could have accessed it one by one."

The antibiotic situation was like a black box—they only knew that Lingao Pharmaceutical Factory's antibiotics were continuously flowing in, but the antibiotic output was completely mismatched. As for what mechanism was operating inside, they could only guess now.

Zheng Mingjiang decided to start with the Lushi Powder appearing on the market—after all, she was just sitting idle in Guangzhou anyway.

However, Zheng Mingjiang didn't go undercover herself. This wasn't because she was unwilling to get into the field, but because she felt going herself risked tipping them off. After all, that day the shop assistant had immediately recognized her as an Elder, even if they didn't know exactly who. But as an Elder, especially a female Elder, she might indeed stand out too much in Guangzhou. So she sent her guard and life secretary out to investigate.

After reminding Jingshan to be careful when going out, Zheng Mingjiang sat on the sofa drinking tea and reading newspapers. Today's *Yangcheng Express* devoted considerable space to introducing the new Nanhai District head Zhang Xiao, praising this Medicine Master to the skies—light of the Senate, savior of countless lives, kind and charitable, caring for the old and cherishing the poor, loving the people like his own children, and so on. Anyway, boasting didn't cost anything.

"Heh! If I didn't know you, I might have believed it."

After finishing the *Yangcheng Express*, Zheng Mingjiang carefully reviewed materials about the situation around Guangzhou, particularly the traditional herbal medicine markets.

Though the antibiotics definitely came from the Senate, exactly which link had problems, where they'd been stockpiled after leaking, how they were fenced, and how they circulated on the black market—all this was completely unclear. Maybe the center was in Guangzhou, maybe not, but either way it would be connected to herbal medicine.

Zheng Mingjiang's knowledge of traditional medicine markets was still stuck on the old timeline's four major markets: Bozhou in Anhui, Yuzhou in Henan, Hehua Pond in Chengdu, and Anguo in Hebei. Her impression was that Guangzhou had a Qingping Market, but that was from the 1970s and 80s—not even a shadow of it existed in this timeline.

Traditional Chinese medicine was normally Liu San's domain. She had no intention of stealing Liu San's business, so she hadn't paid much attention to this.

Currently it appeared the nearby medicine markets were one in Foshan—where Runshi Hall, which had close ties to the Senate, had a branch. Foshan, one of the famous towns in the realm, had merchants coming from all directions, and unlike Guangzhou city proper wasn't directly under the Senate's watchful eye—perhaps there was distribution there too. The other was Luofu Mountain in Huizhou.

Luofu Mountain's "Dongtian Medicine Market" had been established in the Song dynasty and was once the largest medicine market in Lingnan. At its peak, the market stretched for miles, with medicine merchants from Lingnan and even Southeast Asia all congregating there. In the other timeline, the Luofu Mountain area preserved some medicine market functions with several pharmaceutical companies like Luofu Mountain National Medicine and Xianfeng Pharmaceuticals, but overall it had declined, so Zheng Mingjiang wasn't familiar with it.

Also, though Huizhou was under the Bōbō Army's military reach, it hadn't been deeply administered. Zheng Mingjiang thought this probably wasn't the distribution hub for black market antibiotics—after all, the place barely had any naturalized citizen cadres. Adding the greater distance, from a safety perspective it definitely wasn't as reliable as Foshan. So Zheng Mingjiang decided if she were to go out investigating, Foshan would be the safer choice. Such large-scale antibiotics would certainly circulate to surrounding areas, unlikely to only accumulate in Guangzhou. First, Guangzhou might not be able to absorb it all; second, spreading it out could artificially create scarcity and raise black market prices.

Though she'd come out to relax, Guangzhou municipal government still sent her some internal reference materials. Jingshan had neatly stacked the document boxes on the desk before leaving. Zheng Mingjiang casually picked one up to read: "This expensive!"

According to the External Intelligence Bureau's report, so-called miracle drugs had appeared in Hankou, Nanjing, and even Beijing. Like the Lushi Powder appearing around Guangzhou, they boasted of treating all kinds of redness, swelling, heat, pain, and epidemic diseases—with the highest priced selling for up to fifty taels of silver per box.

Didn't expect the black market circulation to be so fast, Zheng Mingjiang grumbled. Or rather, the case had been going on long enough to spread to these major cities. Fifty taels of silver was a considerable sum even for ordinary naturalized citizen cadres—enough to pay her secretary twenty months' wages, for example. These people were making quite a lot of money. Would be nice to fleece them a bit.

After Jingshan wandered around Guangzhou for a few days, she bought various "miracle drugs" from several small pharmacies and traveling doctors at the high price of one tael of silver per packet. Among them was the so-called Lushi Powder.

"Really expensive," Jingshan complained while organizing the samples she'd bought. "Just the stuff on this table would be enough to buy me. I heard from Jinghan that back in Shandong the prices were even lower—you could buy three or four girls for this. All going cheap to these drug dealers."

"Alright, alright. You have to spend money to catch a wolf. Investigation requires expenses." Zheng Mingjiang took out a microscope and adjusted it. "I'll take you out to play in a couple days."

While observing through the eyepiece, Zheng Mingjiang flipped through the abridged edition of *Traditional Chinese Medicine Identification Studies* approved by Truth Publishing House. This was her blind spot. Through the eyepiece she could observe rows of relatively wide cork layer cells on the cortex, individual or clustered stone cells, bundled pericyclic fibers, and vascular bundles. Well, very typical coptis. Besides that, there was relatively pure powder dyed yellow—obviously the crystalline product of Lingao industry. Unfortunately, chemical analysis couldn't be done in Guangzhou, so the chemical components couldn't be determined for now.

Zheng Mingjiang sequentially observed and identified the dozen-plus packets of "miracle drugs" Jingshan had bought. She found that the additives besides coptis also included other traditional medicine ingredients depending on the packaging and brand. But regardless of what packaging, brand, or name was used, all contained some kind of chemically synthesized powder.

As Zheng Mingjiang expected, these people had apparently mixed antibiotics with powdered traditional Chinese medicines to create so-called "miracle drugs," selling them at high prices for huge profits. This routine could be considered the ancestor of fake and counterfeit drug manufacturing and sales in the old timeline.

She found Lin Motian and had him bring over an experienced pharmacist from Runshi Hall's Guangzhou branch to identify the traditional medicine ingredients in the various Lushi Powder samples by smell.

Finally, after the old pharmacist's identification, these "miracle drugs" contained anywhere from one to five or six traditional medicine ingredients. Besides coptis, there were tian qi, ox gallstone, snake gallbladder, and similar drugs.

Though Zheng Mingjiang didn't understand traditional Chinese pharmacology, she roughly knew these drugs all served to clear heat and detoxify, disperse blood stasis and stop bleeding, reduce swelling and relieve pain in traditional practice, with some anti-infection capability. Mixed in, they could indeed have some effect. It wasn't completely fake.
