# Chapter 2734: The Capital (Part 90)

Leng Ningyun spoke without hesitation. "Thank you for understanding, Third Brother Bao! When you return, please put in a good word for me with Eunuch Yang. As for the withdrawal—the moment Delong reopens, I'll personally deliver the silver to the residence." He gave Wu Kaidi a meaningful glance.

Wu Kaidi immediately presented a red silk pouch. "A small token for the New Year, Third Brother Bao. Please accept it."

Baoyu hefted it in his palm—ten taels at least. A generous gift indeed. His face broke into a broad smile. "Manager Leng, having escaped this ordeal with Heaven's blessing, surely a great enterprise awaits you."

Leng Ningyun seized the opportunity to probe. "Third Brother Bao, why has Eunuch Yang suddenly requested a withdrawal during the New Year? And with such urgency?" Seeing reluctance flicker across Baoyu's face, he quickly added, "Forgive me—I'm overstepping."

Paradoxically, this made Baoyu uncomfortable, especially having just pocketed such a substantial red envelope. Feeling obliged to offer something in return, he leaned in and lowered his voice. "There's been some trouble at home."

"How so?" Leng Ningyun's interest sharpened. He already had his suspicions—for the past several years, all dealings with Delong had gone through Little Eunuch Yang; Eunuch Yang himself had never once inquired.

"It's not really my place to say." Baoyu paused. "But Manager Leng, you're hardly an outsider. Just one word of advice: Eunuch Yang is Eunuch Yang, and Little Eunuch Yang is Little Eunuch Yang."

Clear enough. The rumors of father and son falling out appeared to be confirmed. But Leng Ningyun truly hadn't expected their mutual suspicion had reached such depths.

"Yes, yes. Thank you for the guidance, Third Brother Bao!"

Baoyu hurried off. Leng Ningyun was about to organize and review the materials that had arrived from various quarters, hoping to sort out some useful clues, when a servant appeared at the door.

"Lord Liu from Shuntian Prefecture has sent someone."

"Show them in immediately."

Leng Ningyun thought this was like having a pillow delivered just as drowsiness set in. He had originally planned to wait until after the fifth day of the new year to visit Liu and discuss unsealing the bank. He hadn't expected an emissary on the thirtieth!

The visitor was a clerk from Shuntian Prefecture whom Leng Ningyun recognized. The man dispensed with pleasantries and simply informed him that Magistrate Liu requested his presence at Liuquan House immediately.

Going to Liuquan House at this hour was too late for lunch and too early for dinner. Moreover, today was New Year's Eve.

What could be so urgent that Magistrate Liu needed to see him? Had Eunuch Yang's word already reached Prefect Zhong?

There was no time to deliberate further. He ordered a sedan chair prepared at once and set out for Liuquan House.

Given the earlier lesson, even though Liuquan House stood within the city walls, the escort masters in charge of his protection dared not grow careless. They assigned four escort masters specifically for this trip, supplemented by seven or eight household servants who patrolled at night and knew their way around a fight.

Under normal circumstances, Leng Ningyun would never travel with such a large entourage, but now he could only defer to the escort masters' arrangements. After all, neither Delong nor Heliansheng could afford another incident.

Such a departure could hardly go unnoticed. The various people keeping watch outside Delong pointed and commented freely. Some cursed in anger; others tried to stop the sedan and plead their case; still others hurled refuse and garbage. Fortunately, runners from Shuntian Prefecture were stationed at the entrance to maintain order, and they drove the crowd back before a full disturbance could erupt.

The procession wound its way toward Liuquan House. On New Year's Eve afternoon, the streets lay nearly deserted. Besides refugees huddled in temple doorways, only hurrying clerks and accountants remained—they had to collect debts before dark. Once the door-sealing firecrackers sounded, there would be no more calling for debts. Another year-end would have passed.

The streets were blanketed in white snow. At some point, snowflakes had begun drifting down once more. Sitting in the felt sedan, Leng Ningyun drew his sable coat tighter around himself. In the Ming Dynasty, there had been no custom of wearing furs. With the war against the Manchus severing trade routes, furs had become rarer still. But in this timeline, the Senate vigorously sold Liaodong furs, and the bitter temperatures of the 1637 capital made cotton jackets woefully inadequate. Thus "Nanyang furs"—a convenient cover story—had become fashionable among officials and nobles.

At the entrance to Liuquan House, Shuntian Prefecture runners already stood guard at front and back. From the look of things, Magistrate Liu definitely hadn't summoned him for drinks.

Could this be a Hongmen Banquet? Then again, such measures seemed unnecessary.

Entering, a waiter was already waiting. He led Leng Ningyun to a three-bay cottage nestled in a grove behind the main courtyard.

Having visited Liuquan House many times, Leng Ningyun knew this was an apricot grove. In spring, drinking wine amid the blossoms was a refined pleasure favored by the capital's officials and nobles. After winter set in, the branches grew bare and skeletal. But following a heavy snow, they transformed into trees of jade and silver, particularly serene against the softly falling snowflakes.

He had just reached the veranda when a familiar clerk from Shuntian Prefecture emerged to greet him.

"Manager Leng," the clerk said in a low voice. "Lord Zhong is waiting inside for you."

"Lord Zhong?" Leng Ningyun started. "I was told it was Lord Liu."

"Lord Liu is here as well. But Lord Zhong felt that issuing the invitation in his own name might invite unwanted talk."

"I see, I see."

Hearing that Zhong Lie himself had summoned him, Leng Ningyun raised his guard to full alertness. This Prefect Zhong was renowned for his integrity and uprightness. Though he didn't oppress merchants, he showed them no favor either, treating them strictly according to the traditional hierarchy of the four classes.

When dealing with such a person, one had to be extremely humble. The slightest hint of arrogance would likely earn "forty strokes to reduce his impudence," leaving one's backside in shreds. Yet being obsequious—constantly bleating "Your Honor is wise; this humble one deserves death"—would only earn contempt, and there would be no discussing anything of substance. One needed an attitude that was neither servile nor arrogant.

Fortunately, he had some standing to draw upon. When Leng Ningyun first came to the capital, the Field Bureau had arranged through connections to purchase him an Imperial Academy Student title from Nanjing. Though the Jiansheng title was much derided in the late Ming period, it remained an official court designation. With it, officials couldn't arbitrarily exploit or abuse him—an excellent protective talisman.

The clerk went inside. Shortly after, a servant emerged.

"The Master will see you now."

"Yes. Please lead the way."

"Lead the way" amounted to nothing more than climbing the steps and entering. The attendant lifted the door curtain, gesturing for Leng Ningyun to proceed. Inside, he found a gray-haired elder, perhaps sixty years old, seated at a square table by the window, perusing a folder with evident concentration.

On the table lay numerous folders and letters, along with a set of writing implements. Nothing more.

Hearing him enter, the elder gave no sign of having noticed. Leng Ningyun had no choice but to wait—and wait he did, for several long minutes.

The delay wasn't excessive, but its message was perfectly clear: know your place.

Only when the elder set down his folder and lifted his teacup for a leisurely sip did Leng Ningyun gather the hem of his robe, execute a deep bow, and announce himself.

"Student Leng Ningyun, paying respects to Your Honor."

"Ah, so you are the Grand Manager Leng!" Zhong Lie's eyes were aged and clouded from farsightedness. He had to squint to see people clearly. Yet his gaze remained piercing, as if it could penetrate straight through a man, examining him from head to toe. "I've long heard of your reputation."

"I wouldn't dare presume—I'm merely a student running a money business in the capital, with a modest reputation in the trade."

"Modest reputation?" Zhong Lie's tone turned sardonic. "You're quite famous indeed."

This was no compliment. When Leng Ningyun called on officials in the ordinary course of things, though he held only a Student title, everyone offered him a seat out of respect for the powers backing him. Yet Prefect Zhong hadn't even uttered the word "sit," treating him like a criminal under interrogation.

Fortunately, years of working in finance had cultivated excellent composure. He continued standing respectfully.

"I hear you were recently held by bandits. Now that you've escaped safely—congratulations indeed!"

"Thank you, Your Honor! Speaking of my escape from this ordeal: first, I must credit the investigators of Shuntian Prefecture and Wanping and Daxing counties, who pursued the case with full force, intimidating the villains so they dared not act rashly. Second, I owe thanks to the hired escorts for their effective rescue. All of this reflects Your Honor's excellent governance."

"You certainly know how to speak. No wonder the bigwigs in the capital and the palace are all willing to speak up for you." Zhong Lie nodded. "Sit."

"Thank you, Your Honor." Only then did Leng Ningyun allow himself to relax slightly. He bowed and took a seat on the official hat chair beside him.

Though seated, no tea was offered. Clearly, he didn't count as a guest.

"I've called you here today regarding a matter I wish to discuss with you."

"I wouldn't dare. Whatever is needed, please command, Your Honor."

"People from the palace and from outside have come asking me to unseal your bank as soon as possible." Zhong Lie gave Leng Ningyun a meaningful look. "Regarding the unsealing itself, I have no particular objection. After all, the original seal wasn't my intention."

"Indeed, when Your Honor sealed our establishment, it actually saved us. Without such decisive action, during the days I was held captive, Delong absolutely could not have survived," Leng Ningyun replied with genuine respect.

"Mm." Zhong Lie nodded. "Unsealing itself isn't a major matter—merely a document. But there is one thing that concerns me."

"Please enlighten me, Your Honor."

"Some say Delong is deeply unstable, with internal deficits, and that everyone holding Delong notes and deposit slips is simply waiting for you to open so they can redeem them." Zhong Lie's eyes gleamed. "Though I've never engaged in business myself, I know something of the money trade's tricks. It's all 'ten pots with nine lids.' Unsealing you would be easy enough, but if I find myself having to seal you again, the situation becomes very awkward. And if that triggers civil unrest..." His voice hardened. "Your Student title and the powers behind you probably won't be able to protect you."

So that was his concern. Hearing this, Leng Ningyun's heart settled completely. This was what the prefect worried about!

After a moment's consideration, he spoke. "Your Honor's concern for the market and care for the people's livelihoods moves me deeply. The people of Shuntian are fortunate indeed to have such a parental official."

This was routine flattery. Given Zhong Lie's position, he naturally felt no need to respond—he was only listening for what came next.

"What Your Honor currently worries about is whether Delong's funds are adequate and whether we have the ability to honor redemptions. On this point, I can offer a guarantee: as long as there is no malicious run, there will be absolutely no problem."

"What do you mean?" Zhong Lie asked sharply. "Weren't all those notes and deposit slips issued by your Delong?"

"Your Honor may be aware that when I was held captive, many rumors circulated in the market. Some unscrupulous competitors took advantage of the situation to buy up others' notes at steep discounts. At the lowest point, some paid only ten or twenty percent of face value." He paused. "This is precisely what concerns me."
