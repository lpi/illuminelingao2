# Chapter 2734: The Capital (Part 90)

Leng Ningyun immediately said, "Thank you for your understanding, Third Brother Bao! Please put in a good word for me with Eunuch Yang when you return. As for the withdrawal, as soon as Delong can reopen, I'll personally deliver the silver to the residence." He signaled to Wu Kaidi.

The latter immediately presented a red silk pouch: "A small token for the New Year, Third Brother Bao. Please don't disdain it."

Baoyu weighed it in his hand—at least ten taels. This was a generous gift. His face immediately broke into a smile. "Manager Leng, having escaped this ordeal blessed by Heaven, surely a great enterprise awaits you."

Leng Ningyun took the opportunity to ask, "Third Brother Bao, why is Eunuch Yang suddenly requesting a withdrawal during the New Year? And so urgently?" Seeing Baoyu's reluctant expression, he immediately added, "I'm overstepping!"

This actually made Baoyu feel awkward, especially since he'd just received a large red envelope. Wanting to return the favor, he said in a low voice, "It's just that there's been some trouble at home."

"How so?" Leng Ningyun immediately became interested. He actually had some inkling, because for the past few years, all dealings with Delong had been through Little Eunuch Yang; Eunuch Yang never inquired.

"Ah, it's not really my place to say. But Manager Leng isn't an outsider. Just one word of advice: Eunuch Yang is Eunuch Yang, and Little Eunuch Yang is Little Eunuch Yang."

That was quite clear. It seemed the news of "father and son falling out" was confirmed. But he truly hadn't expected their mutual suspicion had reached this extent.

"Yes, yes. Thank you for the guidance, Third Brother Bao!"

Baoyu hurried off. Leng Ningyun was about to organize and review the materials that had arrived from various quarters to sort out the clues, when a servant came to announce: "Lord Liu from Shuntian Prefecture has sent someone."

"Show them in quickly."

Leng Ningyun thought this was like a pillow arriving just as he was getting sleepy. He'd originally planned to wait until after the fifth to visit Liu and discuss unsealing. He hadn't expected someone on the thirtieth!

The visitor was a clerk from Shuntian Prefecture whom Leng Ningyun recognized. He came in without much ceremony and simply informed Leng Ningyun that Magistrate Liu invited him to Liuquan House immediately.

Going to Liuquan House at this hour was too late for lunch and too early for dinner. Moreover, today was New Year's Eve.

What was so urgent that Magistrate Liu needed to see him? Could Eunuch Yang's word have already reached Prefect Zhong?

He had no time to think further. He immediately ordered a sedan chair prepared and went to Liuquan House.

Given the earlier lesson, even though Liuquan House was in the city, the escort masters in charge of protection didn't dare be careless. They specifically assigned four escort masters, plus seven or eight household servants who patrolled at night and knew martial arts, to escort him together.

Normally, Leng Ningyun would never go out with such a large entourage, but now he could only follow the escort masters' arrangements. After all, neither Delong nor Heliansheng could afford another incident.

But such an exit couldn't be quiet. The various people keeping watch outside Delong couldn't help pointing and commenting. Some cursed angrily; some tried to stop the sedan and plead; others threw refuse and garbage. Fortunately, Shuntian Prefecture runners were stationed at the entrance to maintain order and drove the people away, avoiding a disturbance.

The procession made its way to Liuquan House. On New Year's Eve afternoon, the streets were nearly empty. Besides refugees huddled in temple doorways, only hurrying clerks and accountants remained—they had to collect debts before dark. Once the door-sealing firecrackers sounded, there was no more calling for debts. Another year-end would have passed.

The streets were covered in white snow. At some point, snowflakes had begun drifting down again. Sitting in the felt sedan, Leng Ningyun involuntarily pulled at his sable coat. In the Ming Dynasty, there was no custom of wearing furs. With the war against the Manchus cutting off trade routes, furs were even rarer. But in this timeline, the Senate vigorously sold Liaodong furs, and the 1637 capital's temperatures were far too cold for cotton jackets. So "Nanyang furs"—used as a cover story—became fashionable among officials and nobles.

At Liuquan House's entrance, Shuntian Prefecture runners were already guarding front and back. From the looks of it, Magistrate Liu definitely hadn't invited him for drinks.

Could this be a Hongmen Banquet? Then again, it seemed unnecessary.

Entering, a waiter was already waiting and led him to a three-bay cottage in a grove behind the courtyard.

Having visited Liuquan House many times, Leng Ningyun knew this was an apricot grove. In spring, drinking wine amid the blossoms was a refined pleasure for the capital's officials and nobles. After winter set in, the branches became bare. But after a heavy snow, they became trees of jade and silver, particularly serene with the falling snowflakes.

He'd just reached the veranda when a familiar clerk from Shuntian Prefecture came out to greet him:

"Manager Leng," the clerk said in a low voice. "Lord Zhong is waiting inside for you."

"Lord Zhong?" Leng Ningyun was startled. "Wasn't it Lord Liu?"

"Lord Liu is also here. But Lord Zhong felt that inviting you in his own name might cause undue talk."

"I see, I see."

Hearing that it was Zhong Lie summoning him, Leng Ningyun immediately raised his full alertness. This Prefect Zhong was known for his integrity and uprightness. Though he didn't oppress merchants, he showed them no favor either, regarding them strictly according to the "four classes" hierarchy.

Facing such a person, one had to be extremely humble. The slightest arrogance would probably earn "forty strokes to reduce his impudence," and one's backside would be shredded. But being obsequious and constantly saying "Your Honor is wise; this humble one deserves death" would only earn contempt, and there'd be no discussing anything. One needed an attitude that was neither servile nor arrogant.

Fortunately, he had some standing. When Leng Ningyun came to the capital, the Field Bureau had specifically arranged through connections to buy him an Imperial Academy Student title from Nanjing. Though the "Jiansheng" title was much derided in late Ming, it was still an official court title. With it, officials couldn't arbitrarily exploit or abuse him—it was an excellent protective talisman.

The clerk went in. Shortly after, a servant came out:

"The Master will see you now."

"Yes. Please lead the way."

"Lead the way" meant simply climbing the steps and entering. The attendant lifted the door curtain, signaling Leng Ningyun to enter. Inside, he saw a gray-haired elder, about sixty years old, seated at a square table by the window, perusing a folder.

On the table were only many folders and letters, plus a set of writing implements.

Hearing him enter, the elder seemed not to notice. Leng Ningyun had to wait—and wait he did, for several minutes.

The time wasn't too long, but the message of "putting him in his place" was very clear.

Only when the elder put down the folder and picked up his tea for a sip did Leng Ningyun lift the hem of his robe, make a deep bow, and announce:

"Student Leng Ningyun, paying respects to Your Honor."

"Oh, so you are Grand Manager Leng!" Zhong Lie's eyes were aged and cloudy from farsightedness. He had to squint to see people clearly. Yet his gaze was piercing, as if it could penetrate through a person, examining him from head to toe. "I've long heard of your reputation."

"I wouldn't dare—I'm just a student running a money business in the capital, with a modest reputation in the trade."

"Modest reputation? You're quite famous indeed," Zhong Lie said rather sarcastically.

This wasn't a compliment. When Leng Ningyun usually called on officials, though he was just a Student, everyone gave him a seat out of respect for the powers behind him. Yet Prefect Zhong hadn't even said "sit," treating him like a criminal under interrogation.

Fortunately, having worked in finance for many years, he'd long cultivated excellent composure. He continued standing respectfully.

"I hear you were recently held by bandits. You've now escaped safely—congratulations indeed!"

"Thank you, Your Honor! Speaking of escaping this ordeal, first it was thanks to the investigators of Shuntian Prefecture and Wanping and Daxing counties pursuing the case with full force, intimidating the villains so they dared not act rashly. Second, it was due to the hired escorts' effective rescue. All thanks to Your Honor's excellent governance."

"You certainly know how to speak. No wonder the bigwigs in the capital and the palace are all willing to speak up for you." Zhong Lie nodded. "Sit."

"Thank you, Your Honor." Only then did Leng Ningyun relax. He bowed slightly and took a seat on the official hat chair beside him.

Though seated, there was no tea. Clearly, he didn't count as a "guest."

"I've called you here today about a matter I wish to discuss with you."

"I wouldn't dare. Whatever is needed, please just command, Your Honor."

"People from the palace and outside have come to ask me to unseal your bank as soon as possible." Zhong Lie gave Leng Ningyun a meaningful look. "About unsealing, I have no particular objection. After all, the original seal wasn't my intention."

"Yes, when Your Honor sealed our establishment, it actually saved us. Without such decisive action, during the days I was held captive, Delong absolutely couldn't have survived," Leng Ningyun said respectfully.

"Mm." Zhong Lie nodded. "Unsealing itself isn't a big matter—just a document. But there's one thing that concerns me."

"Please enlighten me, Your Honor."

"Some say Delong is very unstable, with internal deficits, so everyone holding Delong notes and deposit slips is waiting for you to open to redeem them." Zhong Lie's eyes gleamed. "Though I've never done business myself, I know a bit about the money trade's tricks. It's all 'ten pots with nine lids.' Unsealing you is easy, but if it comes to sealing you again, that would be very awkward. If it triggers civil unrest, your Student title and the powers behind you probably won't be able to protect you!"

So that was the concern. Hearing this, Leng Ningyun's heart completely settled. So this was what he was worried about!

After a moment's thought, he said, "Your Honor worries about the market and cares about people's livelihoods. I'm deeply impressed. The people of Shuntian are fortunate to have such a parental official!"

This was routine flattery. Given Zhong Lie's position, he naturally didn't need to respond to it, only listening for what came next.

"What Your Honor currently worries about is whether Delong's funds are tight and whether we have the ability to honor redemptions. On this point, I can guarantee that as long as there's no malicious run, there will be absolutely no problem."

"What do you mean?" Zhong Lie asked. "Weren't all those notes and deposit slips issued by your Delong?"

"Your Honor may know that when I was held captive, there were many rumors in the market. Some unscrupulous competitors exchanged others' notes at low prices. At the lowest, some paid only ten or twenty percent of face value. This is exactly what concerns me."
