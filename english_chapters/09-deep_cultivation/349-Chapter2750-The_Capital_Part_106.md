# Chapter 2750: The Capital (Part 106)

The audience, originally intended for half a *shichen* (one hour), stretched to nearly a full *shichen* (two hours) as questions and answers flowed back and forth. Only when Wang Dehua approached to whisper a reminder about subsequent arrangements did Chongzhen realize how much time had passed.

His spirits soared. Yang Sichang had just presented a strategy to exterminate the roving bandits, and now a man who "knew the Kun" had fallen from the heavens. Surely the restoration of the Great Ming was Heaven's will!

What mattered most was that this person not only "knew the Kun," but as their conversation had revealed, possessed a clear mind and meticulous thinking—a truly practical and capable talent.

Such a man would prove invaluable when the time came to suppress the Kun.

With this thought, the Emperor spoke: "We have noted the matters you raised. You shall certainly be given satisfaction."

"Thank you, Your Majesty, for your profound grace!"

"You understand the Kun situation deeply. Keeping you in the position of Inspector is a waste of talent." The Emperor paused to consider. "The Imperial Court has issued a decree to select talents without adhering to convention. It is a pity you are not a *Xiaolian* (Filial and Incorrupt / Provincial Graduate)..."

Had he been a *Juren* (Provincial Graduate), promotion would have been simple. Sun Yuanhua had been a *Juren*, and became Governor of Denglai just a few years ago.

"The fault lies entirely in this humble subject's inadequacy." Qian Taichong felt a surge of wild joy; it seemed the Emperor intended not only to uphold justice on his behalf but to promote him as well.

"You may withdraw..." The Emperor said, then seemed to recall something. "Where are you lodging now?"

"This humble subject has been staying at the Fujian Guild Hall in the Capital."

"Return there and remain as before. Do not leave the Capital without a decree."

This meant a decree would follow. Qian Taichong, caught between excitement and trepidation, knelt and kowtowed before withdrawing.

Upon leaving the palace, the Jinyiwei officers escorting him were exceedingly polite, conveying him back to the Fujian Guild Hall in a small sedan chair. The guild hall manager had been anxious ever since Qian Taichong was taken away, fearing that some "sensitive" matter might be interrogated and implicate the establishment. Seeing the officers return his guest in a sedan chair, he finally breathed easy.

Before departing, the officers instructed him to "take good care of Master Qian." The manager agreed repeatedly. After watching the officers leave, he could not suppress his curiosity and asked about the events of the past few days.

Qian Taichong brimmed with joy and wanted to pour out everything, but remembering that this matter involved the Emperor, he restrained himself. If word of his being "frivolous" reached imperial ears, there would be no escaping the consequences.

He said simply: "There is now a favorable prospect for the matter that brought me to the Capital."

He had been delayed in the Capital for more than half a year handling affairs, leaving early and returning late each day, and had scarcely seen a friendly face in all those months.

Realization dawned on the manager's face, and he cupped his hands. "Congratulations, congratulations! Presumably, Master has found his channel this time! Things are easy to manage once you have a channel!" He lowered his voice. "A high official at court, I take it?"

"Precisely! Precisely!" Qian Taichong could not contain the joy in his heart. "I accept your auspicious words!"

His spirits lifted by this happy turn of events, Qian Taichong noticed it was still early and asked the manager to order wine and dishes; he wished to organize his thoughts while drinking.

The manager proved most capable. Before long, a servant brought wine and dishes in a food box. Since he was drinking alone, there were only four small dishes, two dishes to accompany rice, and a plate of "rolls."

By now, snowflakes drifted past the window; heavy snow was falling on the Capital once more. Qian Taichong left the window open, admiring the snow as he drank in solitude. This was the first time in years he had felt so at ease—not only because he had gained the Emperor's attention, but because the Emperor seemed intent on dealing with the Kun scoundrels.

The Zheng family's current predicament stemmed ultimately from the Kun scoundrels. Once the Kun scoundrels' momentum waned, the various scattered branches of the Zheng clique would naturally turn to competing overseas rather than fighting over Zhangzhou Bay.

During today's audience, the Emperor had shown great interest in the Kun scoundrels and asked many questions about them. Qian Taichong had discovered that although the Kun scoundrels had already seized the land of two provinces and their power far exceeded that of ordinary bandits, the Emperor knew remarkably little about them.

It made sense, he reflected. Setting aside the Emperor in his lofty position, even in Fujian—now a "frontline" province—Kun goods had long been everywhere. Kun ships loading cargo could be seen at the docks of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, though nominally they all belonged to guest merchants of the Great Ming.

Yet the officials and gentry remained largely ignorant about the Kun scoundrels. At most, they knew only the familiar phrases: sturdy ships and sharp cannons, exquisite appliances.

As long as the Imperial Court was determined to suppress them, mobilizing a great army for a southern expedition to destroy the Kun scoundrels might prove impossible, but dampening their arrogance should not be difficult. After all, the Great Ming was a colossus; how could mere Kun scoundrels be mentioned in the same breath?

At the height of his drinking, Qian Taichong already entertained vague fantasies of entering court as a meritorious minister to offer congratulations, receiving the Emperor's rewards, returning home to bring glory to his ancestors...

Suddenly, a gentle knock sounded at the door. Qian Taichong assumed it was the manager and called out: "The door isn't bolted—just come in."

With a creak, the double doors swung open. The person who entered was not the manager, but an unfamiliar young man.

He lodged at the guild hall precisely for its peace and quiet, unlike inns where people came and went constantly, with strangers wandering into rooms at will.

Qian Taichong, somewhat dazed from wine, took a moment before asking: "Who might the gentleman be?"

The young man smiled slightly. "We are strangers."

"Since we are strangers, why visit so late at night?"

"Though strangers, we share a common enemy."

At this, Qian Taichong sobered considerably, immediately recognizing that this person had not blundered in randomly but had come with purpose. His guard rising instinctively, he said: "This student doesn't understand your meaning..."

"Mr. Qian, you have been in the Capital for eight months; I need not elaborate on why you came. Today's audience in the Yufang Pavilion means your great ambition can be fulfilled. Congratulations."

This time, the wine Qian Taichong had drunk turned to cold sweat, instantly seeping from his back. His tipsiness vanished completely. He demanded sternly: "Who are you?!" As he spoke, he reached for the precious sword behind his back.

"Mr. Qian, please remain calm." The young man smiled. "I bear no ill will in coming here. There are simply some matters I wish to discuss with you."

Qian Taichong's mind raced. He had only just had his audience with the Emperor today, yet this person knew of it that very night. Clearly no ordinary character—perhaps he was from the Factory Guard (Dongchang/Jinyiwei), or some influential eunuch?

"What concern is this of Your Excellency?"

"Sir understands the Kun situation deeply. The Imperial Court will certainly have great use for you when employing troops in the future. But has Sir considered the military strength when Governor Wang attacked the Kun scoundrels back then?"

"The military strength was formidable."

"And did the Kun scoundrels possess their current grand position back then?"

"Far from it."

"Given this, if the Imperial Court deploys its forces, why does Sir believe it won't repeat Governor Wang's disaster?"

This question struck at Qian Taichong's heart. He was someone who had fought the Kun scoundrels and spent two years in Lingao; naturally, he knew that times had changed. Compared to a few years ago, the Kun scoundrels had grown even more powerful.

Back then, with merely a single county's territory and a few thousand infantrymen lacking even armor, they had annihilated more than twenty thousand elite soldiers of the Guangdong provincial army. Now they occupied Liangguang. At sea, from Tianjin Wei in the north to Guangzhou Prefecture in the south, the Kun scoundrels' flags fluttered everywhere, and their fleet—trailing plumes of black smoke—sailed through waters as if no opposition existed.

Even if the Imperial Court could mobilize an army of one hundred thousand, what of it?

At this thought, he sank heavily into his seat. The fine wine and delicacies before him had lost all savor.

He hesitated, then looked up with doubt in his eyes. "What is your purpose in telling me these things, sir?"

A flash of realization struck him, and he spoke with a tremor in his voice: "Could it be—could it be—could it be you are a Kun... scoundrel!"

In that instant, the panic of fleeing during the defeat at Chengmai, the terror of capture, the humiliation of being escorted to Lingao for hard labor, the shock of witnessing the Kun scoundrels' power—all of it surged back!

Apparently seeing the fear in Qian Taichong's eyes, the visitor sighed softly. "I am not a Kun scoundrel; please be at ease, Sir. I came today bearing a few sincere words."

"Yes, yes—please enlighten me."

"Sir's hospitality..."

Qian Taichong came back to himself and hastily said: "Sit, please sit. Forgive my rudeness."

Only then did the young man take a seat. His demeanor remained perfectly composed. Seeing that Qian Taichong still seemed distracted, he smiled and said: "Sir, do not be suspicious. I am irreconcilably opposed to the Kun scoundrels. Knowing that Sir harbors the will to resist the Kun, I came to speak with you."

Qian Taichong finally settled, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead. "Sir came... quite suddenly, indeed..."

"Kun scoundrel spies and informants are everywhere in the Capital; I had no choice but to act thus." The young scholar's voice dropped to a whisper. "There are no outsiders here; we may speak in confidence."

"Might I ask Sir's name...?"

"My surname is Le," the young man said. "A false name, of course."

Such candor left Qian Taichong momentarily stunned. He heard the other continue: "I am an old acquaintance of the Kun scoundrels. I hate them to the bone. I must take such precautions."

Qian Taichong immediately expressed his understanding and inquired again about the purpose of the visit.

"Sir had an audience with the Emperor today and spoke at length about the inside affairs of the Kun scoundrels. Presumably, Sir also grasps the Emperor's intention."

"Indeed, the Emperor appears to harbor the intent to punish the Kun." Qian Taichong said. "The Kun scoundrels have become a festering wound for the Imperial Court, yet the gentlemen of the court remain blind, failing to see the larger picture!"

"Sir speaks correctly. However, this act of punishing the Kun absolutely must not be undertaken!"

Qian Taichong was puzzled. "If they are a festering wound, why must nothing be done? The Kun scoundrels occupy Liangguang, collecting all its money, grain, and population. Given time, their power will only grow stronger. If the Imperial Court continues to appease them, won't the Kun scoundrels become unstoppable in the future...?"

"Sir speaks correctly. But if the official army moves to punish the Kun, it faces certain death and no hope of survival! How much money, grain, and troops does the Imperial Court currently possess to withstand such a catastrophe? Once the elite forces are lost, and the roving bandits and Eastern Barbarians seize the opportunity to rise, where will the Imperial Court find the resources to raise money, grain, and train soldiers again?"

Qian Taichong was rendered speechless. With his experience and knowledge, he naturally could not claim the Imperial Court would certainly prevail. Yet psychologically, he still resisted accepting the conclusion that the official soldiers were doomed to defeat. He ventured hesitantly: "Surely it won't come to that...?"

But thinking further, from the time Wang Zunde was defeated at Chengmai until now, fires had blazed in four directions and smoke risen from eight quarters for the Imperial Court. Setting aside the smaller bands of roving bandits and mobs, the roving bandits in the Central Plains alone, the chieftains in the Southwest, and the Jianzhou beyond the pass meant fighting virtually every day. How many elite soldiers could possibly remain? If defeated in Guangdong, with the crack troops drawn from every region utterly destroyed, the consequences were easy to imagine.

At this realization, he could not help but sit stunned, murmuring: "To punish the Kun means defeat; to merely defend also means defeat. What is to be done?"
