# Chapter 2631: Unexpected Complications II

Huang *Shi* looked fixedly at the person speaking. He was named Wu Yixuan, looking younger than Yuchi Gang. Wu Yixuan was native of Qiongshan, Hainan, graduate of Fangcaodi. Said to be descendant of Tang Dynasty famous official Wu Xianxiu. Father generation sent him into Fangcaodi School to study early, majoring in Law and Politics. After graduation once cooperated with "Little Senators" to hang post (intern/serve) in local place to exercise, tempering management ability. Afterwards, Wu Yixuan was appointed as Guangzhou Circuit Court Judge, responsible for handling appeal cases of Guangzhou Grand Region. Different from Yuchi Gang, Wu Yixuan character outer soft inner hard, eloquence good. Self-considered professional origin, knowledge foundation strong. Once followed "Chiefs" for long term, understanding essence of law thoroughly. Slightly looked down upon retired soldiers.

Yuchi Gang saw Wu Yixuan showing off knowledge, said: "Big Sister, according to your complaint paper, your husband at least violated these regulations of granting divorce in Marriage Law: implementing domestic violence or abuse, abandoning family members; having bad habits like gambling, drug taking etc. repeatedly taught not changing; separated for full two years because of emotion disharmony. Reason why still need opening court to try, is because every family has a difficult scripture to read. Life between husband and wife, bystanders cannot see clearly truly. Although we judges represent public power, judge is also human. Cannot exercise discretion right casually to decide life and death of others' marriage because of personal preference. Proverb says well, prefer dismantling ten temples, not dismantling one marriage. Maybe both sides feel contradiction already reached level unable to resolve, but for judge to judge whether husband wife both sides emotion truly broken through reviewing evidence and both sides' debate within short time, is a difficult matter."

Zhao Hening listened dumbfounded. Originally she thought relying on Huang *Shi* and Guan Zongbao's testimony alone could sentence divorce without hesitation. didn't expect Yuchi Gang actually said he still couldn't see clearly.

Wu Yixuan had some meaning of tit for tat, said: "My viewpoint is exactly opposite. Marriage Law never did and impossible to concern men women's emotion. Whether *Marriage Law* or *Several Specific Opinions of Great Song Supreme Court on How to Determine Husband Wife Emotion Indeed Broken in Trying Divorce Cases*, determination standards inside are all objective standards. Only one thing it wants to determine, that is whether husband wife both sides still have objective conditions to continue fulfilling marriage contract, not some whether husband wife emotion broken."

Wu Yixuan's words made Zhao Hening's heart broad much again. Still one separate two wide, each produce joy is good.

"Then is divorce difficult?" Huang *Shi* asked again.

"Divorce is nothing more than property division, debt division. How much common property do you have?" Yuchi Gang asked, "That is property produced after you married over."

"Sigh, where does home have other property. Only remaining one adobe room in village. Additionally a few taels silver of debt." Huang *Shi* sighed saying.

"Then simple. Nothing more than dividing house. Small items like what pot bowl ladle basin divide half to half is fine. Debt is also so."

"Then, my son follows him?" Huang *Shi* asked again.

Yuchi Gang said: "Blood relationship is born with. No clause in law can cut off blood relationship. Supporting old people is obligation children should fulfill. Your son naturally wants to fulfill support obligation."

Wu Yixuan said again: "However support obligation is absolutely not your so-called Filial Piety. Not blindly satisfying parents' demand, but only providing material foundation not lower than local living standard to guarantee normal life of old people losing labor ability, life unable to take care of self. Right, your son seems not adult yet right?"

"Fifteen this year." Huang *Shi* said.

"Then your son doesn't need to bear support obligation now. Instead your husband wants to bear raising obligation. This involves another problem again, that is custody right of minor children. That is who child lives with after you divorce. Generally speaking, minor children above eight years old, court will judge according to two sides' raising conditions, simultaneously respecting child's true will."

After a detailed legal explanation, Huang *Shi* listened still muddled. Circuit Court was not just handling this one case either. Therefore needed Huang *Shi* to go back to notify Guan Youde to go to Circuit Court location, that is inside this Marching Camp to conduct court trial together.

Huang *Shi* walked out of tent uneasy. Zhao Hening advised her don't worry; this matter wrapped on her body.

At this time, Mo Yu and others also returned to Grand Camp. After obtaining answer of not finding obvious problems, Zhang Xiao only instructed him to continue monitoring.

"Jiayu, how do you see?" Zhang Xiao asked.

"Student thinks, Chief's worry indeed has reason. Just didn't find evidence. Why not send troops to search directly." Zhang Jiayu answered. Ancient times didn't have any Human Rights to speak of. As long as official wanted to search, issuing an order was fine. Let alone now still Military Control State.

Zhang Xiao shook head, "Zhu Shilian dare let Mo Yu go to workshop to look, must have wiped traces already. Moving out now isn't it beating grass scaring snake?"

"Dare ask Chief thinks what trick Zhu clan is playing?" Zhang Jiayu couldn't help thinking. Momentarily no good idea either.

"Hei hei, asked on point." Zhang Xiao laughed, "Just looking from various intelligence, Zhu clan not only acquires Silkworm Feces, but also acquires manure fertilizer. As big landlord, this act isn't impermissible. But acquisition volume is truly too big. Looking from Chemistry angle, fertilizer mainly provides Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium these main nutrient components for crops. Speaking of Nitrogen, I instead remembered past event of engaging in Nitre Field together with Ji Tuisi and Chen Huan back then..."

"What use is Nitre Field?" Zhang Jiayu somewhat didn't understand.

"A path to extract Saltpeter."

"Saltpeter!" Zhang Jiayu was surprised, "Could it be they want..."

"Shh!" Zhang Xiao used hand to make a silencing motion, said: "I didn't say what they want to do."

Zhang Jiayu felt this was a good chance to repay grace, so said: "If preparing gunpowder secretly, must need artisans. Jiujiang Township always doesn't produce gunpowder. Artisans must be outsider strangers. If material evidence not easy to find, Student earnestly request Chief to catch suspicious people in name of catching bandits. Interrogating strictly, must have result."

"This is instead a good idea. We just play a Sound East Strike West trick." Zhang Xiao touched small mustache on chin, shouted: "Hening!"

"Coming. What matter?" Zhao Hening heard someone calling her, ran in.

Zhang Xiao said: "You this Women's Federation Special Commissioner want to exert some function. These days Jiayu accompany you to go down to countryside to propagate Women Protection Policy. Local women mostly possess capability of self-reliance; want to utilize mass foundation well. Therefore, you want to propagate Huang *Shi*'s divorce case vigorously. Let masses of ten *li* eight townships all come to listen to Senate's judgment. Battle array bigger the better."

"Okay!" Zhao Hening agreed readily.

Zhang Jiayu said: "Student doesn't understand. Why want to propagate Huang *Shi* divorce case vigorously? What relation does this have with searching Zhu clan?"

"Of course is paralyzing enemy, letting them relax vigilance. Mo Yu going to investigate should have attracted their attention. Have to let them know this County just likes managing chicken feather garlic skin small matters."

After Huang *Shi* mother and son finished busy in Jiujiang Great Market, returning to straw hut only found uninvited guest coming to home. Turned out to be Guan Youde's Second Sister.

Guan's Second Sister asked impolitely: "What wrong thing did Youde do exactly? You want to treat him like this?"

Guan Zongbao looked at his mom, puzzled when his Second Aunt knew this matter. Huang *Shi* just said nothing.

Guan Zongbao then said: "You might as well ask ask what right thing he did."

"Zongbao, how can you say so?" Guan's Second Sister lectured, "Your dad was also tired sick for your this family. Silver he earned before was all taken home for you to use."

"Said nicely. Don't touch own conscience," Guan Zongbao said: "Money he earned before, eating drinking whoring gambling, getting sick eating medicine. How many copper plates did we spend?"

Guan's Second Sister saw him not moved, changed tone, "Don't blame me this Aunt having many mouths. I also hope your family good, don't suffer outsiders' instigation."

Seeing two not speaking, Guan's Second Sister advised Huang *Shi* again: "Youde said he already knew wrong. You just forgive him this one time. He will live days well in future..."

After Guan's Second Sister advised and left, Guan Zongbao was some angry, asked Huang *Shi*: "Mom, what do you think exactly? Why go to talk this matter to her?"

Huang *Shi* cried saying: "Bao'er ah, this matter without Clan deciding, can't be done."

"Then you still want to live days with him?"

Huang *Shi* shedding tears, hesitatingly said: "I thought a lot these few days too. Night night couldn't sleep. Now since he admitted wrong. He a person never lowering head all life admitted wrong. I still feel want to forgive him once."

Guan Zongbao hearing simply angry exploded, loud voice said: "What? He knew wrong? He didn't even come to apologize himself!"

Mother and son finally broke up unhappily. Each went to busy own farm work, speaking no more.

Zhao Hening received Zhang Xiao's task then worked like wind and fire. Don't know where caught a few storytellers, pulling banner, holding tin sheet trumpet propagating everywhere. Soon ten *li* eight townships all knew Guan Youde's wife wanted to divorce him, and Australians upholding justice. Women embraced Melon Eating Mentality one after another wanting to go to scene to see see.

This time Guan Boyi couldn't sit still. His Guan Clan Shimei Hall's face simply became joke of this township. After teaching Yanchang Ancestor Branch Branch Head fiercely, decided to find Huang *Shi* personally.

Guan Boyi came to Huang *Shi*'s straw hut together with Clan Elders. Everyone sat down, face solemn yet carrying a few points of kindness, giving people a feeling of prestige without anger. Guan Youde stood behind resentfully.

Guan Boyi said: "Huang *Shi* little daughter married into my Guan Clan, indeed suffered quite some bitterness. I seeing today, heart feel ashamed very much. Just why not find elders in clan to decide?"

Huang *Shi* small voice said: "Home small matter, dare not bother Patriarch and various elders."

Guan Boyi said: "Since small matter, then even more no need to bother Official Family. You say right?"

Guan Zongbao don't know where came courage, stood out saying: "Various elders since here, should judge judge reasoning. My Mom suffered his bullying and humiliation for long years, not willing to live days with him. Just should One Separate Two Wide."
