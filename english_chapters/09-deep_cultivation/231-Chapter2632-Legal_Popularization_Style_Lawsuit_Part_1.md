# Chapter 2632: Legal Popularization Style Lawsuit (Part 1)

A Clan Elder said angrily: "Zongbao, this is not words a junior like you should say. I consider you young and ignorant, so I won't haggle with you."

"Guan Youde, you say how to handle this matter?" Guan Boyi looked at Guan Youde.

Guan Youde walked out, pointing at Huang *Shi* saying: "I suffered enough bitterness for this family. I fought life to live till today. It is her! Not abiding by women's path, wearing green hat for me (cuckolding), angering me into this..."

Guan Zongbao roared angrily, "You still rake backwards (counter-accuse), not afraid of suffering Heaven's Condemnation?"

Guan Boyi was also angry, roared: "Shut mouth! Ancestors' faces are all lost by you! This matter not allowed to mention again!"

Another Clan Elder came out to advise: "Past things just passed. Speaking also can't change past. Let's not mention all. Today only speak future matters."

Guan Youde said arrogantly: "From today on, as long as she is willing to treat me well, past things I won't mention completely. Guan Zongbao, as long as you call me a Dad, I still recognize you this son."

Huang *Shi* said: "Then I will treat him well. As long as he is willing to live days peacefully, I also forgive him this one time."

Guan Zongbao was angry straight to laugh, didn't want to say a single sentence.

Guan Boyi seeing fire duration (*Huo Hou*) arrived, said to Huang *Shi*: "I know your family life is difficult. From today, clan supports one hundred *jin* grain monthly. Since Official Family intervened in this matter, can't fold Official Family's face either. Official Family is about to open an Agricultural Technology School in this township. At that time Clan will provide fund, sending Guan Zongbao to study. Is this arrangement good?"

Huang *Shi* naturally thanked thousand times ten thousand times. Guan Zongbao however was like a leaked rubber ball, couldn't be happy a bit.

Next day, Guan Zongbao secretly went to Jiujiang Great Market to find Zhao Hening. Zhao Hening after listening was also angry till unknowing so (confused/furious). Pulled Zhang Jiayu horse not stopping hoof (hurriedly) to find Huang *Shi* to ask details.

Huang *Shi* a look of not wanting to toss about (*Zhe Teng*), said resentfully: "I am also thinking for Bao'er. Even if I divorce him, in future Bao'er same wants to support him. If something happens still Bao'er bears. Might as well I help him block."

Zhao Hening said: "If you want to avoid him, simply don't be too easy. Now under Senate rule River Clear Sea Calm (*He Qing Hai Yan*), you mother and son fly high far away, even going to Nanyang to beg living won't starve you."

"Sigh, Sister, you don't understand. Every family has a difficult scripture to read." Huang *Shi* speaking speaking cried again.

"Simply... simply..." Zhao Hening was angry somewhat incoherent, "I today just know what 'Mourning her misfortune, angering her not fighting' means!"

Zhang Jiayu as a native, could understand Huang *Shi*'s situation instead. But from heart, he still hoped Huang *Shi* could leave Guan Youde to start new life. Zhang Jiayu advised: "Aunt's situation I can understand. But your choice is truly an unwise move. Guan Youde's nature already formed for decades; can't change."

"Right ah. Can dog change eating shit? Have you seen?" Zhao Hening anger didn't strike one place, yet no place to vent. Pulled Zhang Jiayu hammering fiercely a few fists on his back, beating Zhang Jiayu grinning straightly.

Guan Zongbao asked Zhao Hening: "Then can my Mom's marriage still be divorced?"

Zhao Hening said: "Divorce what divorce ah! Divorce is civil lawsuit, needs to have plaintiff. Now plaintiff doesn't want to sue, could it be asking Judge to separate them two forcefully?"

Guan Zongbao sighed a breath, shook head straightly.

Zhao Hening used pity to say: "You watch. Her bitter days are still behind!"

Let Zhang Jiayu and Zhao Hening two people advise how, Huang *Shi* was not moved. Attitude even became more and more determined. Finally no method, two people had to go back with extremely sad and cool mood.

Zhao Hening reported process one by five one by ten (in detail) to Zhang Xiao and Li Yao'er roughly. Sighing while speaking, "I truly don't understand. What exactly is she thinking in brain? Is brain filled with all shit?"

Li Yao'er said: "Not experiencing a matter, not growing a wisdom. Hening, passing this matter you should have some growth. Changing a person's thought how difficult. Especially adults. Wanting a person lived for decades to admit his persistence of past decades was all wrong, is no less than collapse of whole spiritual world! Rather than so, might as well wrong continuously, rest until death."

"Human is just such an animal. No matter did what wrong thing, can find excuse for self, also want to rake backwards (counter-accuse)." Zhang Xiao remembered Liu Dalin's evaluation on Chen Zizhuang before again, shook head: "Sigh, truly as wife despising this person's water and fire, immediately able to rise following husband, die following husband, towards women's path truly never not accusing."

Then said to Zhao Hening and Zhang Jiayu: "However seeing injustice on road drawing sword to help, is what you young people should do. No need to take to heart deeply. Injustice and unfairness in this world exist everywhere. Not relying on a cavity of hot blood can change immediately—changing world is effort of many years many people."

Zhang Jiayu said: "Student received teaching!"

Zhao Hening muttered: "I made such big battle array. Ten *li* eight townships all knew I this Women's Federation Special Commissioner want to make decision for women. She is good, now quitting burden (*Liao Tiao Zi*) directly. Truly too angering people! Pitiful person must have hateful place!"

Zhang Xiao smiled saying: "Little Hening ah, don't be angry. Angry easy to get old. Your propaganda is still very effective right. Huang *Shi* doesn't come still have Zeng *Shi*. Zeng *Shi* doesn't come still have Song *Shi*, Ding *Shi*. We continue playing music continue dancing!"

Speaking to bottom, Huang *Shi*'s case was just a "Typical." No Huang "Typical" also had Li "Typical." Always had people hoping to change destiny boldly. Divorce case kind of cases were not fought for first time in Guangdong either.

Zhang Xiao immediately let people inform to four countrysides "Releasing Accusation": Determined to hold case trial by County Circuit Court in Jiujiang Market on June 15th.

After Witchcraft Case (*Wu Gu An*), Court System strengthened judicial construction in Guangdong. Especially "Circuit Trial" system already developed very maturely in Guangdong these two years. Nanhai, Panyu two counties' courts all established multiple Circuit Tribunals. According to certain cycle conducting trials on cases at various markets within county.

Every arriving a place stayed for about a week time. Mainly conducting summary trials on various civil lawsuits and minor violation cases. Trial open transparent. Cases tried were mostly affairs related to masses' daily production and life. Plus extensive application of Ma Xiwu Style Trial Method, sticking to people's condition people's livelihood as possible. So once promoted, soon obtained very good effect. Could say Senate's initial "Legal Popularization" started from Circuit Court. After all majority common people couldn't read various "Legal Popularization Small Booklets" clearly, but were ears hearing eyes dyed (influenced), impression profound towards process of trying cases and "Summary Statement" of judge at last.

Because effect significant, also gave Liang Xinhu and others confidence to perfect Two Guangs Region legal system comprehensively. After all now naturalized citizen judges of various courts were mostly from three-month short training class origins. Only extremely few people had received two-year Fangcaodi Judicial Training Class legal education after graduating complete primary school.

Circuit Court tried mostly civil cases. Characteristic was case condition complex, very hard to apply law articles simply—let alone *Civil Code* revised by Senate was huge masterpiece. Don't say naturalized citizen judges from three-month crash training class, even Senators of Law Society dared not say self having bamboo in chest (confident) towards this plagiarized code.

After making many not big not small jokes, Circuit Trial also gradually got on formal track. On one hand was drawing lessons from advanced experience of old time space. On the other hand was Liang Xinhu following method of Zhu Yuanzhang compiling *Grand Pronouncements* (*Da Gao*) back then, publishing *Typical Precedents* once a month. These cases some were accumulated cases of Senate engaging in judicial construction in Hainan, some were cases of Old Time Space. Of course, which specific ones to select and compile, mainly was result after organizing and summarizing cases tried by judges every month, to ensure cases could stick to reality as possible.

Looking from their current trial situation, local most civil cases were property disputes. Especially regarding land aspect. Including dividing family analyzing property (*Fen Jia Xi Chan*), tenancy disputes, land ownership...

Among them case conditions involving land mostly relatively complex, involving many "Historical Problems." Especially related deeds, mostly years deep days long, either incomplete, or text ambiguous, true fake hard to distinguish. This made judges scratch head very much. Because ordinary people knew very little about government deeds, adhering completely to retained personnel to identify and organize.

To avoid taking opportunity to commit fraud by this kind of retained personnel, they were centrally arranged in newly established Judicial Appraisal Center as technical personnel, only responsible for appraising materials, not docking with specific cases.

Despite having help of this Appraisal Center, cases involving field property were still biggest headache cases for naturalized citizen judges. Even if Liang Xinhu went out personally to try might not be better to where. After all "Taking fact as basis," but this fact was ambiguous unclear. Many didn't have text material to prove. Regarding "Witness," frankly speaking in this time space where village party, same clan relationships prevailed, truly not quite reliable. Sometimes Liang Xinhu and naturalized citizen judges could only come a "Free Heart Testimony" (*Zi You Xin Zheng* - Free Evaluation of Evidence).

In comparison, cases like divorce and analyzing property appeared much "Easier." Especially divorce case. Generally speaking, wanting to fight lawsuit to divorce in this time space, basically were unable to live on; could say having made determination. Case condition often had great dramatic nature. Every trial also received folks' attention specially. Therefore although case condition simple, out of propaganda purpose, trial instead relatively meticulous. Hoping to obtain best "Legal Popularization" effect.

One week before Circuit Court arrived at Jiujiang, local naturalized citizen cadres posted relevant notices. Those wanting to fight lawsuit prepare relevant text materials in advance. At this moment on streets of Jiujiang Market, inside tea houses, in inns, Litigation Masters holding "Agent Writing Complaint" cloth banners could be seen everywhere, competing to solicit business.

Because illiteracy rate of this time space was very high, and fighting lawsuit must write complaint, so Litigation Masters spread to rural areas rapidly from original Prefecture City, County City following footsteps of Circuit Court.

Although these Litigation Masters hadn't learned "Australian" laws, they were very sensitive to rule type things. Without passing any training, after a few years, actually could write various "Australian" legal documents road familiar door familiar (skillfully). This made Liang Xinhu also feel very surprised.
