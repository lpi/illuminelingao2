# Chapter 2730: The Capital (Part 86)

Leng Ningyun laughed. "That's what I say, but until the very last moment, we definitely can't flip the table. After all, everyone's eating from this table. As long as we appeal to reason and interest, they'll naturally agree."

"But, isn't that the same as counterfeit notes..." Wu Kaidi, not being from a finance background, was momentarily confused. "We still can't tell whether the people coming to exchange silver are from Shanxi House."

"That's why we need to negotiate—get them to put up the silver to help us handle this run."

Wu Kaidi's jaw dropped. Though he'd worked with Leng Ningyun for years, some things were still beyond his understanding—as the saying goes, different trades are like different mountains.

"Boss! That's over a hundred thousand taels! Just transporting it would take several large carts! They'd lend it to us for nothing? Even a short-term loan needs interest!"

"As long as I can convince them to lend, all that is minor." Leng Ningyun's spirit had mostly recovered by now. Perhaps the boredom of twenty-odd days of doing nothing had stimulated him—he seemed unusually energized. Outside was freezing cold, and the room had only a brazier, yet he paced back and forth in just a thin silk-padded jacket.

"Make me a list of all the leading managers and chief managers of Shanxi House, and note down their backing as well." Leng Ningyun had already formed a plan. "Also prepare a generous gift and send it to Lord Liu of Shuntian Prefecture. Thank him for his assistance these days and ask him to unseal the premises as soon as possible. For the silver needed, just draw from the accounts."

"That's easy. I'll see to it when I get back," Wu Kaidi said.

"One more thing. When you return to Delong, have someone clean up, prepare sedan chairs and horses, and make arrangements with the local authorities. The day after tomorrow, I'm returning to Delong with great fanfare. All Delong staff who have no other duties must be present."

"Yes." Wu Kaidi understood his employer's meaning. In business, what mattered was personal credibility and strength. Leng Ningyun's unexplained disappearance these past days had greatly affected his commercial reputation. Now that he was back, everyone needed to know.

On the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month of Chongzhen 9 (January 24, 1637)—Little New Year's Eve—heavy snow fell on the capital. Times were hard, but in the realm's first city, the New Year atmosphere was still quite thick.

On this day, many shops had already closed, sending their clerks home to prepare for the New Year. Most yamen had also sealed their seals and stopped work. Every household that wasn't living hand to mouth was stocking up on New Year goods. The drifting snowflakes also covered the dilapidated buildings and dirty streets, dressing them in silver to await the arrival of Chongzhen 10.

In front of Delong Bank, the street had been swept clean. Though the tightly shut gates still bore Shuntian Prefecture's seals, brand-new lanterns had been hung. The Song-style calligraphy "Delong" stood out strikingly against the white snow.

On the other side, the residence gate, shut for over twenty days, now stood open. Two enormous lanterns hung before the entrance—one reading "Leng Residence" in Song calligraphy, the other inscribed "Jiansheng" (Imperial Academy Student). The latter had been specially procured for Leng Ningyun through a donation to the Nanjing Imperial Academy by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

Though the "Jiansheng" title was mocked by those in orthodox civil examination circles, it meant that the wealthy folk in the capital had to address Leng Ningyun with courtesy.

The managers, chief accountants, clerks, and guards of both residence and bank... all wore brand-new clothes, standing at attention before the gate with puffed-out chests. Runners from Shuntian Prefecture maintained order. Gawkers packed half the street.

A servant in blue came running from the street corner, shouting, "He's coming! He's coming!"

At his call, the servants immediately lit firecrackers. Thirty-six large "Full Spring" double-bangers and six ten-thousand-character red strings all went off together, crackling merrily.

Amid the firecrackers, a blue-felt sedan chair carried by four bearers came slowly from the street corner, surrounded by escort masters from Heliansheng.

In the sedan sat Leng Ningyun himself.

From the day he'd been tricked into leaving Delong until now was only about twenty days, yet those twenty days had felt endless. Now returning to this street, looking at the scenery outside, it felt like a world away.

If he hadn't been greedy for credit and acted rashly, if he'd just been content to be Manager Leng, he wouldn't have suffered so greatly. In the end, it was all about "greed."

He remembered when he first entered the financial world, his mentor had said: in this business, you succeed by greed and fail by greed too. Without sufficient desire for money and drive, you couldn't do this work; yet that same desire often led people into eternal damnation.

Still, that note had been too tempting, and the person had known the Senate too well. With such bait, probably no Senator could resist the temptation.

This Mr. Yue was truly too mysterious. During his captivity, Leng Ningyun had more than once suspected he was a traveler like Hale.

But after several interactions, he didn't quite seem like one.

He was young yet extremely experienced; vastly learned yet quite ignorant in some ways; seemingly very familiar with the Senate yet holding many misconceptions about them.

"Truly a mysterious man," Leng Ningyun thought.

Next, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and Political Security Bureau would both send people to the capital to investigate this matter. This person's origins would certainly be a key focus of investigation.

He had already talked with Li Rufeng at the mule-and-horse inn and roughly understood what had happened during these days. Although he hadn't yet met Min Zhanlian or read the relevant reports, based on what he knew, the people who kidnapped him were almost certainly from the "Stone Elder Group." And this mysterious young man should be a core-level figure in the organization.

"There will be much to do next," he thought silently.

The sedan stopped. A servant lifted the curtain, and Wu Kaidi came forward.

"Master, please alight."

Leng Ningyun solemnly grasped the servant's arm and stepped out of the sedan. The sky was snowing heavily, like scattered cotton. Looking out, everything was pristine white, covering the muddy street and making the formerly somewhat foul air fresh and pleasant.

He took a deep breath of the cold air and smiled. "What a snowfall!"

"Indeed!" Wu Kaidi smiled. "Auspicious snow foretells a good year. Next year will be prosperous!"

The onlookers stirred. Some shouted auspicious words like "Manager Leng has Heaven's blessing," hoping for tips. Others called out, "Please have mercy, sir! Don't renege on my silver!"

Whatever was said, Leng Ningyun paid no attention. He strode to the two escort masters from Heliansheng and said, "This time, thank you both for your efforts."

"It was my duty," Li Rufeng said very respectfully. "It's all thanks to your blessed fortune, sir."

Liao Sanniang said nothing, only curtsied deeply.

Then he walked to the two assistant managers, Xiao and Wei, the chief accountant, and other "executives." The chief accountant immediately led everyone in bowing: "Welcome home, Master!"

Leng Ningyun said nothing, only nodded with a smile. Xiao and Wei felt uneasy—after all, when the incident first broke out, they hadn't been steadfast and had even considered "jumping ship." Many people knew about this. Would Manager Leng punish them upon return?

Now that their employer showed no displeasure but in fact smiled, the group felt even more uncertain.

Leng Ningyun strode into the residence. Inside, the women of the household, led by Hexiang and Yanhong, waited at the steps of the reception hall. Seeing him enter the courtyard, Hexiang's legs gave way and she collapsed to the ground, sobbing uncontrollably.

Her crying set off Yanhong and the other maids, who all started weeping.

Leng Ningyun smiled. "Why cry? Haven't I come back safe and sound?" With that, he helped both of them up and told everyone to rise.

Wu Kaidi sighed. "Since the master disappeared, the two young ladies have worried day and night. They kept vigil every day, not sleeping through the night, just to get news promptly! They even made a vow of abstinence—before you returned safely, no salt in their meals..."

Leng Ningyun looked at the two women's haggard faces and felt guilty. "Why do such things! Ruining your health like this. Does not eating salt make me return safely? Instead, you've wrecked your own bodies!"

He immediately ordered them taken back to their rooms and given some glucose-saline water to drink. He himself returned to the "Yiqiang Studio," where he normally worked.

This hall was where he commanded the entire Delong Beijing Branch. Here he gave orders and directed funds.

Since his kidnapping, the room had remained empty. The furnishings were unchanged; even the letters and ledgers on his desk hadn't moved a bit.

A light finger swipe revealed no dust. The narcissus pots on the stand, the flower clusters—some budding, some in bloom—filled the room with fragrance. A large plate of Buddha's-hand citrons remained golden and glistening.

Clearly, since he left, someone had cleaned and maintained this place every day, keeping it as it was. Thinking of this, he felt moved yet also guilty. The Delong Beijing Branch had several hundred people whose livelihoods and safety depended on him alone. Yet he had been so reckless!

Perhaps he still hadn't escaped the shadow of his "counter-encirclement escape" and had always been trying to prove his "fearless courage."

As he reflected, Wu Kaidi came up with tea and asked, "Master, everyone is waiting for your instructions..."

"Mm," he nodded. "Tell everyone—whether from the inner residence or the bank—to return to their posts and do their duties, and to organize their work. Especially the bank staff—prepare for reopening business these next few days. I'll see them one by one over the next two days.

"As for the Heliansheng people, except for Chief Li, Lady Liao, and the guards, please have the others return first. There will be generous thanks soon."

"Yes."

"Please invite Chief Li and Lady Liao in first."

Though not urgent, Heliansheng had contributed the most during this crisis, and there had been casualties. They should be promptly compensated and rewarded to avoid chilling people's hearts.
