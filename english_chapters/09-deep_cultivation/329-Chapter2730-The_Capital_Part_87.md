# Chapter 2730: The Capital (Part 86)

Leng Ningyun laughed. "That's what I say, but until the very last moment, we must not flip the table. After all, everyone is eating from it. Appeal to reason and self-interest, and they'll come around naturally."

"But isn't that the same as counterfeit notes..." Wu Kaidi, lacking a finance background, found himself momentarily confused. "We still can't determine whether those coming to exchange silver are from Shanxi House."

"Which is precisely why we must negotiate—persuade them to put up the silver and help us weather this run."

Wu Kaidi's jaw dropped. Though he had worked alongside Leng Ningyun for years, some matters remained beyond his grasp. As the saying goes, different trades are like different mountains.

"Boss! That's over a hundred thousand taels! Just transporting it would require several large carts! You think they'll lend it to us for nothing? Even a short-term loan demands interest!"

"Once I convince them to lend, everything else becomes trivial." Leng Ningyun's spirits had largely recovered by now. Perhaps the tedium of twenty-odd days with nothing to do had stirred something in him—he seemed unusually energized. Outside, the cold was bitter, and the room held only a brazier for warmth, yet he paced back and forth in nothing but a thin silk-padded jacket.

"Compile a list of all the leading managers and chief managers of Shanxi House, with their backers noted as well." Leng Ningyun had already formulated his plan. "Also prepare a generous gift to send to Lord Liu of Shuntian Prefecture. Thank him for his assistance these past days and request that he unseal the premises as soon as possible. Draw the silver from the accounts."

"Easy enough. I'll see to it when I return," Wu Kaidi said.

"One more thing. When you get back to Delong, have someone clean the place thoroughly. Prepare sedan chairs and horses, and make arrangements with the local authorities. The day after tomorrow, I shall return to Delong with great fanfare. All staff without pressing duties must be present."

"Understood." Wu Kaidi grasped his employer's meaning well. In business, what mattered above all was personal credibility and strength. Leng Ningyun's unexplained disappearance had dealt a heavy blow to his commercial reputation. Now that he was back, everyone needed to know it.

On the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month of Chongzhen 9—January 24, 1637, Little New Year's Eve—heavy snow descended upon the capital. Times were hard, but in the realm's foremost city, the festive atmosphere remained thick.

That day, many shops had already shuttered their doors, sending clerks home to prepare for the New Year. Most government offices had sealed their official stamps and ceased operations. Every household not living hand to mouth was busy stocking up on holiday goods. The drifting snowflakes blanketed the dilapidated buildings and grimy streets alike, draping them in silver to await the arrival of Chongzhen 10.

Before Delong Bank, the street had been swept clean. Though the tightly shut gates still bore Shuntian Prefecture's seals, brand-new lanterns now hung from the eaves. The Song-style calligraphy reading "Delong" stood out strikingly against the white snow.

On the opposite side, the residence gate—closed for over twenty days—now stood open. Two enormous lanterns hung before the entrance: one inscribed "Leng Residence" in Song calligraphy, the other bearing the characters "Jiansheng"—Imperial Academy Student. The latter had been specially procured for Leng Ningyun through a donation to the Nanjing Imperial Academy, arranged by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

Though the "Jiansheng" title drew mockery from those in orthodox civil examination circles, it meant the wealthy folk of the capital were obliged to address Leng Ningyun with courtesy.

The managers, chief accountants, clerks, and guards of both residence and bank stood at attention before the gate, all wearing brand-new clothes, their chests puffed out with pride. Runners from Shuntian Prefecture maintained order while gawkers packed half the street.

A servant in blue came running from the street corner, shouting, "He's coming! He's coming!"

At his cry, the servants immediately set off the firecrackers. Thirty-six large "Full Spring" double-bangers and six ten-thousand-character red strings all erupted at once, crackling merrily.

Amid the cascade of firecrackers, a blue-felt sedan chair borne by four carriers emerged slowly from the street corner, surrounded by escort masters from Heliansheng.

In the sedan sat Leng Ningyun himself.

From the day he had been tricked into leaving Delong until now spanned only some twenty days, yet those days had felt endless. Returning to this street and gazing at the scenery outside, it seemed like another world entirely.

If he hadn't been greedy for credit and acted so rashly—if he had simply been content to remain Manager Leng—he wouldn't have suffered so grievously. In the end, it all came down to one word: greed.

He remembered when he first entered the world of finance, his mentor had told him: in this business, you succeed by greed and fail by greed too. Without sufficient desire for money and ambition, you couldn't do this work; yet that same desire often led men into eternal damnation.

Still, that note had been too tempting, and his captor had known the Senate far too well. With such bait, probably no Senator could have resisted the temptation.

This Mr. Yue was truly too mysterious. During his captivity, Leng Ningyun had more than once suspected the man was a traveler, like Hale.

But after several interactions, he didn't quite seem like one.

He was young yet extremely experienced; vastly learned yet quite ignorant in certain ways; seemingly very familiar with the Senate yet harboring many misconceptions about them.

"Truly a mysterious man," Leng Ningyun thought.

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau and Political Security Bureau would both send people to the capital to investigate this matter. This person's origins would certainly be a key focus of the inquiry.

He had already spoken with Li Rufeng at the mule-and-horse inn and gained a rough understanding of what had transpired during his absence. Although he had not yet met Min Zhanlian or read the relevant reports, based on what he knew, the people who had kidnapped him were almost certainly from the "Stone Elder Group." And this mysterious young man appeared to be a core-level figure within the organization.

"There will be much to do next," he thought silently.

The sedan halted. A servant lifted the curtain, and Wu Kaidi stepped forward.

"Master, please alight."

Leng Ningyun solemnly grasped the servant's arm and stepped out of the sedan. The sky was heavy with snow, falling like scattered cotton. Looking out, everything lay pristine white, covering the muddy street and making the formerly somewhat foul air fresh and pleasant.

He drew a deep breath of cold air and smiled. "What a snowfall!"

"Indeed!" Wu Kaidi smiled back. "Auspicious snow foretells a good year. Next year will be prosperous!"

The onlookers stirred. Some shouted auspicious words like "Manager Leng has Heaven's blessing," hoping for tips. Others cried out, "Please have mercy, sir! Don't renege on my silver!"

Whatever was said, Leng Ningyun paid no attention. He strode toward the two escort masters from Heliansheng and said, "This time, I thank you both for your efforts."

"It was my duty," Li Rufeng replied with great respect. "All credit goes to your blessed fortune, sir."

Liao Sanniang said nothing, only curtsied deeply.

Then he walked over to the two assistant managers, Xiao and Wei, the chief accountant, and the other executives. The chief accountant immediately led everyone in bowing: "Welcome home, Master!"

Leng Ningyun said nothing, only nodded with a smile. Xiao and Wei felt uneasy—after all, when the crisis first erupted, they had wavered, even considering jumping ship. Many people knew about it. Would Manager Leng punish them upon his return?

Now that their employer showed no displeasure but in fact smiled warmly, the group felt even more uncertain.

Leng Ningyun strode into the residence. Inside, the women of the household, led by Hexiang and Yanhong, waited at the steps of the reception hall. The moment Hexiang saw him enter the courtyard, her legs gave way. She collapsed to the ground, sobbing uncontrollably.

Her weeping set off Yanhong and the other maids, who all began crying in turn.

Leng Ningyun smiled gently. "Why cry? Haven't I returned safe and sound?" With that, he helped both women to their feet and told everyone to rise.

Wu Kaidi sighed. "Since the master disappeared, the two young ladies have worried day and night. They kept vigil every day, never sleeping through the night, just so they might receive news promptly! They even made a vow of abstinence—before you returned safely, no salt would touch their meals..."

Leng Ningyun looked at the two women's haggard faces and felt a pang of guilt. "Why do such things! Ruining your health like this. Does refusing salt bring me back safely? All you've done is wreck your own bodies!"

He immediately ordered them taken back to their rooms and given some glucose-saline water to drink. He himself returned to the "Yiqiang Studio," where he normally conducted his work.

This hall was where he commanded the entire Delong Beijing Branch. From here he gave orders and directed the flow of funds.

Since his kidnapping, the room had remained empty. The furnishings stood unchanged; even the letters and ledgers on his desk hadn't shifted a fraction.

A light swipe of his finger revealed no dust. The narcissus pots on the stand displayed clusters of flowers—some still budding, others in full bloom—filling the room with fragrance. A large plate of Buddha's-hand citrons remained golden and glistening.

Clearly, since his departure, someone had cleaned and maintained this place every day, keeping everything exactly as it was. The thought moved him, yet also deepened his guilt. The Delong Beijing Branch employed several hundred people whose livelihoods and safety depended on him alone. Yet he had been so reckless!

Perhaps he still hadn't escaped the shadow of his "counter-encirclement escape" and had always been trying to prove his "fearless courage."

As he reflected, Wu Kaidi approached with tea and asked, "Master, everyone is awaiting your instructions..."

"Mm." He nodded. "Tell everyone—whether from the inner residence or the bank—to return to their posts and attend to their duties, and to organize their work. The bank staff especially must prepare for reopening business in the coming days. I'll see each of them individually over the next two days.

"As for the Heliansheng people, except for Chief Li, Lady Liao, and the guards, please have the others return first. There will be generous thanks forthcoming."

"Yes."

"Please invite Chief Li and Lady Liao in first."

Though the matter was not urgent, Heliansheng had contributed the most during this crisis, and there had been casualties. They should be promptly compensated and rewarded—to do otherwise would chill people's hearts.
