# Chapter 2505: Burning the Tower (18)

Xu Tong picked up the short knife on the ground immediately. His body was similarly crouched low. His legs were slightly bent, feet shoulder-width apart, forming a deformed boxing defense stance. His left hand was in front shielding the rear hand, right hand behind in a fist shape holding the short knife with a standard grip. He held the knife-holding hand vaguely against his waist, using his front hand and chest to block and hide that fatal aggressive intent. He contracted his chest and abdomen inward as much as possible and went up to meet him without hesitation. unlike what martial arts coaches taught—not to put the knife-holding hand in front when within the opponent's attack range—once the front hand is hit and the weapon is lost, it equals losing all hope. A wasp's sting only extends when fighting desperately. Close-quarters combat is often decided within just a few seconds. In battle, determination and will are more important than skill. Mindset determines life and death. Facing a steel knife, people's subconscious reaction is to flee and hide. Only warriors who dare to face blood and endure pain can maintain the determination to fight to the end. They will not yield or retreat. Facing danger, they are angry and aggressive.

*An old hand,* Xu Tong thought guardedly. That wasn't a flowery stance. The two stared at each other like fighting cocks. Both sides were extremely cautious, not easily entering the opponent's long-reach attack range. The two circled each other, constantly changing positions to probe, each making several futile attacks. After a moment of stalemate, the opponent suddenly took a fierce step forward, knife-holding hand extending, probing forward with a feint. Xu Tong's steps were steady, unmoved, still maintaining his own rhythm. Precise distance sense allowed him to judge that it was a fake move outside of attack distance. If he misjudged, the moment the opponent retracted the attacking hand, he would step in and extend his arm to counterattack. Because launching a counterattack from outside attack distance required the counter-attacker to step forward as much as possible, straighten the arm, and lean the body forward to bring the opponent into range, this could lead to loss of balance or excessive movement amplitude, destroying the defensive stance. Once unable to retract in time, the opponent would close in and stab continuously, deciding victory or defeat in a breath.

After confronting for a moment, Xu Tong suddenly advanced, rushing into the opponent's attack range. With a bob and weave from boxing, he prepared to forcibly snatch the opponent's right side. The opponent was startled by Xu Tong's rapid close-in advance. His body involuntarily turned slightly to the right, and the right-hand knife stabbed out immediately. Xu Tong followed immediately with a right sway, feinting left but going right, a fake move similar to dribbling past someone in basketball, cutting into the opponent's left-side dead angle.

"Won!" A voice shouted in the bottom of Xu Tong's heart. Snatching the left is the winning move in knife fighting. The opponent extends his left hand for defense, right hand holding the knife hidden at the waist and abdomen ready to attack at any time. Then his left side must be empty. So when facing an enemy, one must maintain facing the enemy squarely. Whoever can snatch the opponent's left-side body position can gain the initiative.

Xu Tong's left hand formed a palm, clawing fiercely at the opponent's eyes. At extremely close range, the opponent couldn't help but close his eyes and tilt his head back, left hand retracting to try to shield his left ribs. Xu Tong's striking left palm retracted, changing from clawing to grabbing, seizing the opponent's left sleeve at the elbow. Pulling and squeezing, he made his body turn toward his own left side, causing the enemy's entire left body to be completely exposed. The opponent's left kidney, lung, and heart were completely open. Xu Tong maintained his last bit of rationality. At the moment of thrusting the knife, he flipped his wrist, holding the knife in reverse grip. Using the sharp four-edged metal striker on the knife handle, he fiercely jabbed the opponent's kidney and lung vitals. No pause, continuous and non-stop. The opponent screamed "Ah," the voice breaking halfway as he ran out of breath. But the pain obviously didn't destroy his resistance consciousness. While enduring the blows, the big man struggled to turn his body. Xu Tong grasped his sleeve tightly, pulling his body, not letting him break free. When Xu Tong turned to the opponent's rear side, he smashed the four-edged knife pommel fiercely against the opponent's spine. The big man could no longer bear it. The knife flew out of his hand, and he stumbled forward a few steps clutching the back of his neck.

Xu Tong also threw away the short knife in his hand almost simultaneously. He unleashed his double fists. The fists raged violently. Countless splashing blood spots burst into blood flowers in the air. Xu Tong frantically vented the fear and trembling of wandering on the edge of death. The big man was like a tattered rag doll, beaten swaying left and right, toppling East and West, with no power to fight back. Xu Tong's upper body suddenly curled into a ball. After a moment of stagnation, he suddenly unfolded. All muscles were releasing explosive power to the maximum limit. A violent right uppercut hit the big man's mandible viciously. Accompanied by the sound of the mandible shattering, the big man's body was scooped up into the air. He had lost consciousness the moment he was hit. His feet were carried suspended inches in the air, body like a stiff wooden stake, thrown off the ground at a 45-degree angle, then crashed straight down, falling to the ground with a bang, making no more sound.

Xu Tong's bare upper body was covered with incense ash. Streaks of sweat and blood stains flowed down his body, forming strange mottling, making him look like a Rakshasa from hell. The surrounding noise disappeared, leaving only the rustling of wind blowing through leaves. Xu Tong slowly raised his eyes, revealing infinite fierce light. He looked around and asked in a low, hoarse voice, "who else?"

The field was silent, as if even time had congealed. Xu Tong stood quietly, waiting. All eyes were cast on him, gazes mixed with approval, doubt, indifference, and hatred. Many people were somewhat at a loss regarding everything that had happened suddenly. They weighed their reactions according to their own positions. A layer of fine sweat seeped from Li Baiqing's forehead. The corner of his mouth twitched. Someone had to speak for Xu Tong. Men who licked blood from knife points valued capability and rules. Endless jungle law would bring mutual destruction; only limited rules could let everyone coexist. Someone must speak for Xu Tong, taking the lead to set the rhythm. Xue Tu might go with the flow to remove Xu Tong. While the assassin was falling, Li Baiqing pulled the sleeve of a clansman from the Mutual Defense Association beside him and whispered a sentence to that person. That person was stunned, hesitated slightly, looked at Li Baiqing, then turned his head away.

After a moment of silence, a rough voice suddenly shouted from the edge of the field: "Bullying the few with the many, how seamless!" It was shouted by Li Baiqing's clansman. It was like a big stone thrown into a calm lake, stirring up splashes and countless ripples. The surroundings were immediately in a tumult. Most people followed shouting: "Good man!", "True hero!", "Good skills!" Mixed in were shouts of: "Slaughtering and injuring fellow members, execute family law!", "Kenshiro, I have a hatred deep as the sea with you!"

Xu Tong threw the short knife in his hand onto the ground. The blade stuck into the soil with a "chi" sound. Xu Tong did not speak. He strode toward Xue Tu. Immediately, several knife hands rushed up beside him, protecting Xue Tu in the center. Xue Tu did not stop them, only slowly narrowed his eyes, silently staring at Xu Tong. Xu Tong stopped several steps away from Xue Tu, knelt on one knee with a thud, cupped his hands, then said loudly, "Brothers of various families have clear eyes. I, Li, signed a life-and-death document to fight with Sun Gang. Reading the friendship of fellow members, I originally did not wish to hurt people. Only Sun Gang's master and disciples twice surrounded and tried to kill me, Li, under the watchful eyes of everyone. I, Li, was forced to act in self-defense, inevitably losing a measure of propriety. Since ancient times, without righteousness, one cannot gather people's hearts; without fairness, one cannot manage major affairs. I, Li, act uprightly. How each person acts is witnessed by the brothers of all families. Justice is in the human heart. I also hope the Marshal and Witness Senior Brother Ge will uphold justice." After speaking, he arched his hands and circled them around to the four sides.

Xue Tu waved his hand, dismissing the few guards. He did not answer Xu Tong's question but said slowly, "Brother Li, raise your head."

Xu Tong raised his head, trying his best not to touch Xue Tu's currently sensitive nerves, carefully observing Xue Tu's expression.

At this moment, his life and even the success or failure of the mission all lay in the single thought of this "monkey wearing a hat" before him. Saying this country bumpkin was short-sighted and ignorant was not an exaggeration, but his cunning and viciousness were exceptional, making him hard to fathom.

The corners of Xue Tu's mouth were pursed tightly. His right index finger tapped unconsciously on the armrest of the round-backed chair. This represented that he felt pressure and trouble. Xu Tong knew that he had caused it. These actions disrupted Xue Tu's layout, making the situation appear somewhat chaotic. Everything began to develop in an uncontrollable direction. Xue Tu was thinking. To integrate a group, the first thing was not to split. Xue Tu was indecisive about handling Xu Tong. The knife hands beside him looked at Xu Tong, then all cast their gazes on Xue Tu, but Xue Tu never stated his position.

Xu Tong looked at Xue Tu. The strength of the two was clear to judge. Confrontation would only drive himself into a dangerous situation. Obeying the opponent and giving him what he wanted could soothe his restless emotions. Xue Tu suddenly asked, "Li Jian, look at me. Are you truly a spy for the Kun thieves?" This interrogation pointing straight to the heart arose abruptly and stiffly. After speaking, Xue Tu stared provocatively at Xu Tong. Although Xue Tu didn't know psychology, rich *jianghu* experience told him that guilt and fear would make a person's mindset unbalanced. When facing sudden questioning, there would be facial stiffness, flickering eyes, avoidance, and rapid blinking. Xu Tong met his gaze without hesitation, his face relaxed and natural. Xu Tong's gaze was frank; that was the humility of submitting to the strong. This gave Xue Tu's vanity a small satisfaction.

Xu Tong answered carefully, "Marshal, I, Li, only came to Guangzhou Prefecture to avoid disaster. When I came, I didn't even know what Kun thieves were, how could I be a spy for Kun thieves? This lowly one's family background is clear. If the Marshal has doubts, this lowly one is willing to submit the accompanying card. This lowly one has a number in the Green Dragon Society. Just send a brother to Jiangnan to check and you will know. Since I, Li, arrived in Guangzhou Prefecture, I happened to encounter the Kun rebellion..."

Xue Tu gently stroked his beard with his hand, eyes squinting slowly and slightly. After a moment, he suddenly stood up from the round-backed chair, laughed loudly, came up to help Xu Tong up, and smiled, "Where do Brother Li's words come from? How can I, Xue, not trust you? Just now was just a small joke. That Sun Gang himself did not cultivate virtue; how can there vary be a reason to turn back and blame Brother Li?"
