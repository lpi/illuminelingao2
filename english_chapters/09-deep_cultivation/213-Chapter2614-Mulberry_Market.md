# Chapter 2614: Mulberry Market

Guan Zongbao got up at the fifth watch, replacing Huang *Shi* to feed mulberries, and started a day's labor, only cooking breakfast after finishing housework. The silkworm feces replaced in the morning were collected by him and not used to feed fish. Last year, the local Master Zhu's family purchased silkworm feces in large quantities, saying they opened some patent medicine workshop needing silkworm feces to make medicine. The purchase price was high, so surrounding silkworm farmers were willing to collect silkworm feces to sell to the Zhu family, while fish pond feed needed to be supplemented by harvesting large amounts of grass in the wild fields instead.

At the break of dawn, Huang *Shi*, who had a nap to restore spirit, got up and ate pickled vegetables with rice. Taking advantage of the cool tempearature in the early morning, she and her son carried farming tools like sickles, hoes, and mulberry baskets to the mulberry garden to weed. The removed weeds could serve as feed for grass carp in the fish pond, but this was far from enough, so he also had to harvest a large amount of water grass in the swamp and water surface near the mulberry garden to pile into green manure to supplement fish pond feed.

Morning mulberry leaves were covered with dew. Picking them to feed silkworms easily made silkworms sick. The best time to collect mulberry leaves was after the dew evaporated. After finishing the farm work in front, the two began to pick mulberry leaves.

The mulberry gardens in Jiujiang were different from those in Jiangnan. The amount of mulberry planted depended on the fertility of the land. For fertile land, each row was one *chi* and two *cun* apart; for lean land, one *chi* and five or six *cun* apart. The spacing was mostly seven or eight *chi*. Generally, five or six thousand mulberry plants were planted per *mu* of mulberry land. In contrast, the planting density of arbor mulberry in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River was only 240 plants per *mu*, and Lake Mulberry in Jiangnan was no more than 200 plants per *mu*, forming a huge contrast. The lifespan of Guangdong Mulberry could generally reach thirty years. Mulberries planted before the Beginning of Spring would have mulberry leaf harvests in the last three crops of the year. If planted in the first or second lunar month, there would be harvest only in the second year.

The biggest difference from Jiangnan mulberry gardens was a procedure of "Cutting Branches" (*Yizhi*) around the Winter Solstice every year. Counting from the root of the mulberry plant, leaving about an inch of mulberry head, the mulberry planter cut horizontally with a sickle quickly in one stroke. Cutting twice in a row was not allowed to prevent injuring the mulberry tree. Cutting branches generally coincided with the harvest of pond fish. At this time, it was just right to drain the pond and cultivate pond mud on the dike, utilizing the fertility of pond mud for mulberry to overwinter, and also to prevent weed growth.

But if it was necessary to supply overwintering silkworm seeds, there was the so-called Mulberry Flower Crop. Mulberry planters didn't cut branches at the Winter Solstice, letting some horizontal branches grow, called "Big Tree Tail." At the end of the year and early spring, a few tender leaves sprouted, called "Mulberry Flower." This required seed makers to book with mulberry planters. Due to extremely low yield, this portion of Mulberry Flower could sell for a high price. Branches were cut only after picking Mulberry Flowers, so this portion of mulberry trees couldn't supply the first crop of silkworms, only normally supplying the second crop.

Huang *Shi* bent her waist, holding the branch stem with her left hand and pinching off mulberry leaves rapidly with her right hand. The grasping part and speed were very exquisite, so as to prevent hurting the mulberry tree. Since the first crop of mulberry was new branches and leaves sprouted after cutting branches, growing particularly short and small, one had to bend down to pick, consuming waist and effort. During the first, second, and third crops, the weather was still slightly cold, so tender leaves couldn't be picked clean; five or six leaves must remain on each branch.

The picked mulberry leaves were piled up by Huang *Shi* and put into the mulberry basket on her back. The mulberry basket was woven from bamboo, with good air permeability, preventing mulberry leaves from fermenting and deteriorating.

Guan Zongbao wiped beads of sweat from his forehead and said, "Mom, when we save some silver this year, let's hire people to pick mulberries next year. Working hard day and night like this, we'll collapse sooner or later; the loss outweighs the gain."

Huang *Shi* said, "From the second crop to the seventh crop, each *jin* of mulberry leaves costs four *wen* of labor silver. The first crop is more expensive, costing six *wen*. Not worth it. Wait until we save more money and arrange a marriage for you; it will be good to have an extra helper at home."

When the two finished labor, the sun had already risen high. Guan Zongbao transported the hard-harvested weeds back to make fertilizer, then carried a load of mulberry leaves with a shoulder pole to the Mulberry Market, preparing to sell for a good price.

"So many annoying mosquitoes. Next time I'll bring a box of mosquito repellent tablets to smoke you all to death!" Zhao Hening was somewhat annoyed, holding a local cattail leaf fan to fan the wind and drive away mosquitoes hovering over her head. She rejoiced in her heart for listening to Zhang Xiao's advice, bringing long-sleeved clothes and long trousers when leaving Guangzhou, imitating the attire of local rural girls. Living in Lingao for a long time, she almost forgot the ferocity of rural mosquitoes.

The task Li Yao'er arranged for her was to inspect the operating mechanism of the local sericulture industry. Zhao Hening dragged Zhang Jiayu along with the excuse of needing a local as a guide. Li Yao'er was somewhat worried, so she arranged for Le Ziren, the resident police officer of Jiujiang Police Station, to follow.

Jiujiang Great Market was the market center of Jiujiang, but the Mulberry Market was not set in the Great Market, but in more grassroots villages. In the sericulture area, Mulberry Markets were countless; even small villages had one. Jiujiang was densely populated. Zhao Hening's group set off south from the Great Market for only two or three *li* and arrived at Nanfang Village. Outside the village were ring-shaped fish ponds formed by digging earth, having obvious defensive functions like a moat.

Zhang Jiayu pointed to several thatched "shops" at the water port head outside the village and said to Zhao Hening, "Hening, this is the so-called Mulberry Market."

Zhao Hening was obviously somewhat disappointed and said, "This is also called a market? Just two or three broken thatched huts!"

Zhang Jiayu said, "Guangzhou rural clans often exclude foreign merchants. Village merchants go home after trading, needing no permanent shops built, so a few thatched huts are enough."

Before getting close, they heard the sound of two women cursing each other with spittle flying. Woman A scolded, "You shameless chicken thief, if you like chickens so much, why don't you be a chicken (whore)?"

Woman B scolded, "You are the chicken; your whole family are chickens. Looking at anyone's chicken looks like your family's chicken!"

"Hmph, stealing my chicken and you still have reason!"

"On what basis do you say this is your family's chicken? How come your family's chicken forages in my family's mulberry garden?"

Villagers watching the excitement gradually increased. Someone tried to dissuade but to no avail. A hen was a considerable property in the countryside; no one was willing to give up, let alone admit stealing the chicken.

Zhao Hening saw Le Ziren watching with relish and asked him, "You are a cadre of our Senate anyway; why don't you resolve the dispute but watch the excitement here instead?"

Le Ziren said, "Miss Zhao, isn't it just a chicken? Such trivial matters are too common in the countryside; can't manage them all. Besides, I don't speak bird language [dialect], how do I know whose chicken this is?"

Zhao Hening gave Le Ziren a roll of eyes, thought for a moment, stepped forward, and shouted loudly, "Two aunties, stop quarreling!"

The two women spraying at full strength were startled by Zhao Hening's sudden shout, looking at her, momentarily not knowing the situation.

Neither Zhang Jiayu nor Le Ziren expected Zhao Hening to intervene actively, too late to stop her. Seeing the two quiet for a moment, Zhao Hening continued, "Isn't what you are arguing about who this chicken belongs to? But neither can prove the ownership of this chicken. I have a way."

Woman B rolled her eyes and said, "Yo, whose yellow-haired girl, hair not even fully grown, wants to manage old lady's business?"

Woman A saw someone helping and said, "Hey, the little girl sees injustice on the road. Are you guilty?"

"Guilty of what? Old lady has never been guilty! She, an outsider, comes to manage village affairs?"

"Outsider is good. No relation to you or me; that is fair."

Woman B was unjustified and had to say, "Then let her speak; let's see what way she has."

Zhao Hening said, "How about this, where do you two live?"

The two women pointed to their own thatched huts respectively, both on the mulberry dike not far away. The two families were not far apart.

Zhao Hening said, "Give me the chicken."

To not appear so guilty, Woman B readily handed the little hen to Zhao Hening. Zhao Hening grabbed the chicken wings, led everyone to the middle ground between the two thatched huts, and said, "This chicken doesn't have a name written on it, and neither of you can produce definitive evidence to prove whose chicken this is, but the chicken itself knows whose family it belongs to. Here is the middle of the two families. I put the chicken here. Whichever side's nest it returns to, it belongs to that family. Do you agree?"

Woman A heard it was reasonable—her chicken would definitely return to her nest—and said good repeatedly.

Woman B had a ghost in her heart. A chicken running out from someone else's house naturally wanted to return to someone else's nest. In this way, she would really become a chicken thief. However, she couldn't show cowardice now, so she had to agree bracingly.

Seeing neither had objections, Zhao Hening let go. After the hen landed, it ran back towards Woman A's direction in a puff of smoke. Woman B found a step for herself, saying, "My chickens are all free-range in the mulberry garden. Like some men, not coming home is common. Since it doesn't want to go home, let it be."

A dispute was thus eliminated. No excitement to watch, onlookers soon went to do their own things. Enjoying Woman A's thanks, Zhao Hening was in a good mood and said to Zhang Jiayu, "How was it? Handled beautifully, right?"

"Clean and beautiful, I am ashamed of being inferior!" Zhang Jiayu was somewhat ashamed. He used to pride himself as a chivalrous person, naturally wanting to uphold justice, putting home and country first, not asking about such trivial matters. He didn't expect Zhao Hening to resolve a dispute so cleanly and neatly.

Le Ziren flattered, "Miss Zhao is indeed a top student of Fangcao Di..."

Zhao Hening imitated Zhang Xiao's tone, saying, "Grassroots cadres of the Senate must learn to go deep into the grassroots, familiarize with people's feelings, and shine the Senate's light into every corner."

"Yes yes yes, what Miss Zhao says is right." Le Ziren hurriedly agreed.

The Mulberry Market soon returned to normal. Zhao Hening's group pretended to be farmers buying mulberry leaves and chatted with villagers. In places with relatively developed sericulture like Jiujiang, Mulberry Markets generally didn't open according to market days, but operated for more than twenty days per crop to supply mulberry leaves. The land occupied by the Mulberry Market, either belonged to the village's public property, or a certain clan's public property, or a certain ancestral hall's sacrificial property, or a certain temple's property. Generally, merchants were invited to contract every year or every few years, and the proceeds served as ground rent.

One of the larger thatched sheds was a place specifically for storing mulberry leaves. A small room next to it was the place for trading. Zhao Hening became interested in a young lad wearing patched clothes. This person looked handsome but tanned dark, with wounds and bruises on his face. It was exactly Guan Zongbao.
