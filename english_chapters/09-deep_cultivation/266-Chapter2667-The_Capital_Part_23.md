# Chapter 2667: The Capital (Part 23)

"This, I will tell you later. For now, you just need to follow me and study seriously." The Teacher avoided answering.

Zhou Lezhi heard from Wang Liang that the Teacher was a person from the Yongle Era. He had once gone to sea with the Sanbao Eunuch and cultivated the Dao and achieved immortality overseas. However, most people thought this was just a common trick used by monks and Taoists and not to be taken seriously.

If there was anything strange about the Teacher, it was that his appearance was at most thirty years old, yet he was knowledgeable and well-informed. This was the surprising part, so it wasn't impossible that the Teacher might have cultivated the art of eternal youth.

However, every time others said the Teacher had supernatural powers, the Teacher always said very humbly that he was just a mortal, only having obtained a little "wisdom root" by chance.

As for what this "wisdom root" actually was, everyone up and down the Wang residence kept it a deep secret, and even Zhou Lezhi, as a "disciple," didn't know. This made the Teacher even more enveloped in a mysterious color.

After following the Teacher for a few days, one night just after he had gone to sleep, Wang Liang came to summon him to see Master Wang.

Zhou Lezhi already knew that this Master Wang was the chief official of the Office of Transmission, an incredibly high official for a commoner like him. Hearing that he was to be seen alone, he couldn't help feeling a bit timid in his heart.

He quickly got up, put on his clothes, and followed Wang Liang through winding paths to a courtyard. Entering the room, he saw a middle-aged man sitting upright in the center, looking very dignified. It was the first time Zhou Lezhi had seen such a high official. His knees went soft, and he knelt down with a *thump* and kowtowed.

"You are that child?"

"Yes, yes, it is exactly this small commoner." Zhou Lezhi replied hurriedly.

"Has Wang Liang told you everything when bringing you here?"

"Yes, told this small commoner to study with Mr. Zhou and be his disciple."

"You must learn from Mr. Zhou diligently," Master Wang nodded slightly. "Mr. Zhou is full of learning and possesses extraordinary knowledge, and it is rare that he is willing to teach. You must not be slack."

"This small commoner dares not!" Zhou Lezhi hurriedly kowtowed again, then felt that this answer wasn't quite appropriate, so he quickly added, "This small commoner will definitely learn with my life at stake!"

"Hehe, risking your life is not necessary. As long as you understand it yourself. This is a great future."

"I also ask the Master to cultivate me more." Seeing the Master's words were gentle and were meant to admonish him, Zhou Lezhi felt slightly relaxed and quickly expressed his stance.

"Good child." Master Wang seemed to smile. "Since you have come to my residence, it is also fate. Work hard; I won't treat you unfairly. In the future, earning a future for yourself and bringing glory to your ancestors won't be a difficult thing."

Zhou Lezhi wasn't exactly exquisite in mind, but he could hear that Master Wang was taking him as a private follower. He was warning him to distinguish between primary and secondary, prioritizing his master-servant relationship with Master Wang, and making the master-disciple relationship with the Teacher secondary.

He quickly said, "This small one understands. If the Master has any orders, just instruct this small one!"

"Studying with Mr. Zhou, you naturally have to apply your heart." Master Wang listened and seemed to be deliberating how to say what followed. "Do not harbor a disrespectful heart. It's just that he is alone in my residence. Since I am his employer, I inevitably have to care for him more. But usually I have many matters and can't attend to some small things—you look after him more for me."

This was asking Zhou Lezhi to monitor the Teacher. Although somewhat unexpected, Zhou Lezhi had no psychological barrier and agreed immediately.

After all, he had only been with the Teacher for a dozen days. There wasn't any deep friendship to speak of, let alone any visible benefits. Speaking of which, even the Teacher's food, clothing, and shelter were burdened by Master Wang, so he naturally wouldn't have any independent thoughts.

"This small one understands!"

"You are indeed a smart person." Wang Yehao praised. "In the future, if you have anything, just speak to Wang Liang alone. No need to mention it in front of others."

"Yes [Nuo]." Zhou Lezhi bowed.

"If there are urgent matters, you can also come directly to find me." Wang Yehao stared at Zhou Lezhi and said sternly.

From then on, Zhou Lezhi began his career as both a student and an undercover agent.

To be honest, apart from some inexplicable words usually, appearing a bit crazy, Mr. Zhou didn't have any outrageous speech.

They didn't stay in the capital for too long. Zhou Lezhi followed the Teacher to Shaoxing Prefecture. This trip to Shaoxing was actually Wang Yehao's idea, specially asking for leave from the court. The reason was to "repair parents' graves," but in reality, there was also the matter of discussing land property with his younger brother.

Zhou Lezhi didn't know about any of this. He just followed the main group heading south. Fortunately, they could take the Grand Canal going south. Master Wang was an incumbent high official, so whether it was using boats, requesting services, or accommodation, local officials provided support, making it very convenient. Taking a boat south also saved the fatigue of carts and horses along the way. During the long boring days, the Teacher gave lectures on the boat.

The content of the lectures, besides that awkward "Teacher's Mandarin," added arithmetic.

He had learned arithmetic before. For the future of the clan's children, the clan elders had invited scholars good at mathematics to teach some arithmetic. So Zhou Lezhi not only knew how to use an abacus and calculate "chickens and rabbits in the same cage," but had also studied content from the *Mathematical Manual of Zhang Qiujian* and *The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art*.

Although most of these taught contents belonged to the practical category and were not strong in theory, they covered a wide range, including plane geometry area algorithms, volume calculation formulas, solutions to systems of linear equations, etc. So he wasn't a blank sheet of paper. Except for some difficulty in accepting brand-new numbers and formulas at the beginning, he soon delved into it.

Zhou Lezhi could tell that the Teacher was very hesitant about what exactly to teach him. Sometimes he taught arithmetic, sometimes he taught the study of investigating things [*Gewu*/Science]. Sometimes he lectured on the geographical patterns of mountains and rivers. In summary, the Teacher understood everything, and his rich knowledge made one prostrate in admiration—it was just that his kung fu in writing characters was really too poor. Not to mention his handwriting looked like a dog crawling, it was also full of vulgar [simplified] characters. If he had to recite poetry and couplets, it was even more difficult upon difficult. Let alone a proper scholar, even he, a child who hadn't even passed the opening of the pen, couldn't be compared with.

Arriving in Shaoxing, the Wang family members returned to their ancestral home, but Zhou Lezhi and the Teacher's group were quietly sent to a separate villa.

In the villa, they lived a leisurely life of daily study just like in the capital. If there was a change, it was that Master Wang transferred a pair of beautiful maids sent by the Prefect of Quzhou to the Teacher, and sent the Liu brothers as the Teacher's guards.

Since the arrival of this pair of beautiful maids, Zhou Lezhi saw another side of the Teacher in this separate property. Originally, although the Teacher lacked literary grace, he was still a modest gentleman: treating the maids and servant women in the residence with respect. At this time, Zhou Lezhi realized suddenly that his previous calmness was just because he hadn't met the right people.

Originally, food and sex are human nature, nothing strange. But the Teacher's style was truly unrestrained. As a disciple living in the same courtyard, Zhou Lezhi was also a young lad full of vigor. This torment every other night made him wish he were dead. The next morning, the Teacher would be radiant, while the disciple would be listless.

Mr. Zhou stayed in Shaoxing Prefecture for quite a few days and made a special trip to the Cao'e Temple. It was said that the Teacher's hometown was in Shangyu County. But wandering around Shangyu County, they never found the location of the ancestral home or graves. Master Wang asked the Prefect of Shaoxing to investigate, but nothing came of it.

Looking at the Teacher's daily mood, he seemed indifferent to all this. Zhou Lezhi felt that his so-called "tour inspection" was mostly sightseeing, with absolutely no intention of searching for roots and ancestors, and he never mentioned a word about his ancestors. This was quite shocking to Zhou Lezhi, who had lived in a clan village since childhood and was raised by the clan.

Zhou Lezhi naturally didn't know what Master Wang did in Shaoxing, except that every three to five days, Master Wang would inevitably come to gather with the Teacher. The two would close the door for secret talks. The Master also summoned Zhou Lezhi from time to time, asking if there were any abnormalities with the Teacher and how his behavior was in private.

To this, Zhou Lezhi reported everything truthfully. However, from Master Wang's suspicious eyes, the other party seemed unsatisfied with his answers.

What exactly did this Mr. Zhou talk about with the Master to make the Master so eager to know his "true face"? Zhou Lezhi was very curious amidst his worry.

However, Master Wang's mood seemed to be very good. He was already familiar with the Master's long-time follower Wang Liang. Hearing Wang Liang say that since Mr. Zhou entered the staff, the Master's state of mind had greatly improved. He trusted Mr. Zhou even more, often asking the Teacher for plans before doing big things.

"Everyone says Mr. Zhou has the ability of foreknowledge. You are his disciple; has he taught you?"

Zhou Lezhi shook his head and laughed, "He teaches a lot of things, but they have nothing to do with divination. This nephew has never heard him speak of these either."

"That makes sense. This is his tool for eating; how can he easily pass it to others? Without three to five years, I'm afraid you won't even see the fur." Wang Liang said, patting Zhou Lezhi's shoulder with envy. "Little brother, you are really lucky! With such a master, regardless of high or low in the future, at least you won't worry about food and drink."

"Uncle Wang is joking. How could I have such fortune? To be able to serve Mr. Zhou and mix a mouthful of rice in the residence, this nephew is already very satisfied."

"Eh! You probably don't know how much my Master values Mr. Zhou!" Wang Liang lowered his voice. "The Master has now bet half his life and fortune on him. One can say he obeys his every word!"

Zhou Lezhi was stunned. He had never expected Master Wang to trust the Teacher so much. He doubted, "Although Mr. Zhou has great ability, everyone says he is a person without roots or background..."

"You are right, but he just has the ability. Not a single sentence misses the mark. No wonder the Master trusts him." Wang Liang acted mysteriously. "A few days ago, the Master also instructed us to go to the areas of Dongyang and Jinhua to look for suitable land, preparing to buy it to make a manor and give it to this Mr. Zhou as property."

Zhou Lezhi's eyes widened. He didn't know where Dongyang and Jinhua were, but Master Wang actually wanted to gift a manor to Mr. Zhou. This generosity was truly extraordinary! what supernatural power did the Teacher have that Master Wang valued him so much?
