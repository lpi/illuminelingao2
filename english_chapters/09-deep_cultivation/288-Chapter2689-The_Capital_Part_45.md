# Chapter 2689: The Capital (Part 45)

Zhou Lezhi saw the Teacher's face was pale, full of disappointment and disbelief. Fearing he might momentarily lose his mind and catch madness, he hurriedly called in a low voice by his ear: "Teacher! Teacher!"

Only then did the Teacher recover his wits, whispering: "I am a bit uncomfortable; I won't listen for now. What this Mr. Gou says, you record it down and give it to me tonight."

Zhou Lezhi was suspicious in his heart, wondering what was wrong with the Teacher. Wang Yehao was secretly happy, knowing Gou Chengxuan's words moved Hearthstone Immortal.

*This gang of Shorn-hair Thieves are all rough blanks; where are there any good people!*

It seemed his "sowing discord" took effect; this Hearthstone Immortal, for a moment and a while, wouldn't think of defecting to his accomplices.

Wang Yehao immediately instructed to take Mr. Gou to bathe and change clothes, and arrange lodgings.

"He is handed over to you." Master Wang instructed Liu Sha. "Watch him well! Don't let him run!"

"Yes."

"There is another matter; he said his father and two servants are still around. You must think of a way to find and acquire them."

"The lowly one has connections with the Guandi Temple's men; just entrust them. As long as they are on Guangzhou's ground, they can all be found."

"You must be careful in this matter. Before coming to Guangzhou, I estimated there must be many Shorn-hair Thief spies in the city; probably the Three Judicial Offices and Governor-General's Yamen also have their sitting spies. So I plan to stay permanently in Zhaoqing; you stay in Guangzhou, specially responsible for detecting Shorn-hair Thief matters—must act in secret. Go recruit some past brothers; I will give them a share of money and grain in the Governor's Standard."

"The lowly one understands! Many thanks for the Lord's grace!"

"Mr. Jin..." Wang Yehao turned to Jin Wenchi. "You talk with that Gou Chengxuan daily. Record all the Shorn-hair Thief situations he knows, including this Qiongzhou Campaign."

That night, Zhou Lezhi served the Teacher to rest, sleeping in the outer room himself. Waking up during the period, he vaguely heard tossing and turning in the inner room. Getting up early the next morning, he saw the Teacher's face was dark, eyelids swollen.

"Teacher, didn't sleep well last night?"

"En."

"I'll serve you to wash first, eat some dim sum, and you can sleep a return sleep [nap]..."

"No need, I can't sleep." The Teacher's face was cold and severe. "Where is that Mr. Gou now?"

"Master Wang already settled him properly. Heard he knows many Australian matters; the Master wants him to write everything out from beginning to end..."

Hearing here, the Teacher nodded and said: "Where is Master Wang?"

"Heard today he is going to the Five Rams Courier Station construction site in the Southern City."

"Five Rams Station?"

"It's where we got off the boat coming to Guangzhou, a huge patch of ruins..."

"That is Five Rams Station?!"

"Yes, heard Big Brother Liu say when Australians besieged Guangzhou they fired rockets, burning Five Rams Station. After the Master took office, he started rebuilding it."

"Rockets? Good heavens!" Mr. Zhou made a strange sound. "Unthinkable, unthinkable, Katyusha?"

"What Sha?" Zhou Lezhi didn't understand and asked.

"Nothing," Mr. Zhou, originally listless, suddenly got energy. "Quickly bring breakfast; after eating we also go to Five Rams Station to look!"

Zhou Lezhi didn't know why the Teacher suddenly became interested in Five Rams Station. When they arrived at the Li Family's wharf, it was exactly nightfall; they only saw a huge patch of pitch-black ruins, nothing special.

After eating breakfast, Zhou Lezhi and Liu Zhao's group accompanied Hearthstone Daoist along Chengxuan Street all the way south, arriving at the Southern City of Guangzhou. From afar, they saw the city gate tower was also burned, leaving only a small amount of carbonized wooden structures standing upright.

Not far from the city gate was a massive area of ruins after being burned by fire. Many shacks had already been built in the ruins, with refugees living inside. Between broken walls and ruined ramparts, some low and dirty sheds were built in disorder, and a few patches of vegetable plots were even opened up.

Such a scene had no more emotional impact on Hearthstone Immortal, only that having a massive area of ruins before even leaving the city made him very surprised.

"This is Five Rams Station? Isn't it outside the city?"

"This place was originally residential homes inside the city. Heard Shorn-hair Thieves also shot many rockets in, burning quite a few houses."

Mr. Zhou's face was grave. He instructed to stop the sedan chair, coming out to gaze at the whole patch of ruins. Not speaking for a long while, he saw a shed not far away gathering quite a few people, and asked: "What is that shed about?"

Liu Zhao hurriedly went over to inquire, returning in a moment to report: "Teacher, it is a porridge-giving shed. Several big households give porridge here daily to aid refugees."

Mr. Zhou said "Oh" and strolled towards the porridge shed. Liu Zhao and Zhou Lezhi didn't know the reason—was he not going to Five Rams Station? Hurriedly bringing family servants to follow.

Many refugees had already gathered around the porridge shed. Asking revealed porridge was given once daily here; only common people who originally lived here and suffered soldier's fire could receive it. So when collecting tokens, they still had to pass through the *Paijia* [Tithing Chief].

"Where is the *Paijia*?"

"Old Daddy Jia was still maintaining order here just now; the Liang Residence steward came and he was called away to talk."

"Liang Residence?"

"It is this city's Liang Cunhou, the Liang family."

Liu Zhao had studied the "Record of Guangdong Gentry" specially before coming to Guangzhou, knowing the Liang family was a famous local big household. He whispered: "The Liang family is local gentry."

After a good while, the *Paijia* finally came back. This *Paijia*'s days were not good either; face covered in ash and dirt, clothes tattered. Hearing a Master was looking for him, he hurried over to answer.

Liu Zhao called the *Paijia* over, flashing his waist tag. The *Paijia* trembled all over, almost kneeling down. Liu Zhao said: "No need for excessive courtesy! My Master has a few sentences to ask you; you speak honestly!"

The *Paijia* couldn't speak Mandarin well; fortunately, Zhou Lezhi was a local native and translated in between.

"Why did this place suffer soldier's fire? Didn't the Shorn-hair Thieves not break the city?"

"Master doesn't know; Shorn-hair Thieves fired rockets, quite a few fell inside the Southern City too. This patch just suffered rockets, spreading burning into a disaster. The Southern City still had several places where rockets fell, only the burned places were not this big..."

Saying deeply, he described the night rockets struck, like meteors falling to earth, instantly igniting many houses. Although the Dragon Society extinguished fires at any time, alas the landing points were too many to attend to. Fortunately, the weather was humid at that time; only then did it not cause a whole city fire.

"But the burned places were not few, with this patch being the biggest. Sigh, in one night more than five hundred people were burned to death. Don't know what stuff was packed in these Shorn-hair Thieves' rockets; it burned upon sticking to things. People were all burned into charcoal! Ai ai ai, too miserable..." The *Paijia* spoke, fear still lingering in his heart.

Mr. Zhou's face was already not looking good; hearing the *Paijia* say more, his face became increasingly ugly. He whispered: "Enough!"

Zhou Lezhi busily scolded: "Don't speak anymore!"

Zhou Lezhi and Liu Zhao saw Hearthstone Daoist's face was ashen [iron-green], not knowing what taboo was violated, and dared not speak more. The *Paijia* was even more scared into not daring to make a sound.

After a long time, only then was Hearthstone Daoist seen exhaling a breath, saying: "What is the matter with the Liang family giving porridge?"

The *Paijia* said this porridge shed was set up by *Runshitang*. Ever since this place suffered soldier's fire, they set up a shed to give porridge here.

"Although *Runshitang* has more than ten Directors, nowadays it is the Liang family managing matters. His family's steward has to come over every day."

Hearthstone Daoist listened and made no further expression. The group passed through the ruins, arriving at the wharf outside the city. Looking at the ruins of Five Rams Station, the Teacher stood by the river bank for a long time, a look of grief and indignation appearing on his face.

After a long while, Zhou Lezhi heard the Teacher say softly: "Let's go back!"

The second day, Zhou Lezhi came to ask the Teacher for leave.

"...I want to go home to look. Heard Second Brother Liu say Shorn-hair Thieves killed and looted a lot in the countryside; I worry about people in the clan..."

"You go then." Mr. Zhou waved his hand weakly. "Go early and return early!"

"As long as the clan is safe, Student will return in two or three days." Saying so he was about to withdraw. Suddenly he was called by Mr. Zhou: "I will go with you."

The second day, under the protection of the Liu family brothers and others, they took a boat to Hetou Village.

Hetou Village was only ten-plus *li* from Guangzhou, yet it didn't suffer soldier's fire. The Clan Leader said when the Shorn-hair Thief grand army passed, they indeed sent people to the village, levying grain and fodder and "Reasonable Burden."

"Soldier's edge passing through border, being able to not rob and not burn is already ancestors displaying spirits [blessing]." The Clan Leader said.

"Did they do any other bad things?"

"They left after levying grain and fodder; didn't do any bad things actually." The Clan Leader said, "On the contrary, local bad people took the opportunity to rise and loot quite a lot. Later they were all suppressed by Shorn-hair Thieves."

Hearing this, Mr. Zhou's face looked a bit better. He asked again: "What about nearby villages?"

"Heard there were those organizing village braves to resist because they wouldn't pay the burden; all were slaughtered village [massacred]. Miserable ah!" The Clan Leader spoke seeming to have lingering fear, and also some rejoicing.

"Slaughtered village?! Really such a matter?" The Teacher's eyebrows all stood up.

"Little person also heard people say it, heard people say it..." The Clan Leader saw his ferocious expression and said shrinkingly.

"Which villages are there? You speak for us to hear." Mr. Zhou pressed.

The Clan Leader originally didn't want to say, until Liu Sha said "Since the Master asks you, anyway it won't implicate you! Just speak!" Only then did he shrinkingly say the names of a few villages.

"Teacher, want to go take a look?" Liu Sha asked.

"Go! Go!"

Resting one night in Hetou Village, the next day the group continued to depart, arriving all the way at Sanshan. After staying locally for half a day, they sailed along the direction the Shorn-hair Thief fleet invaded, visiting villages along the way.

With the progress of the journey, the Teacher's face also became increasingly ugly: burned houses, new graves of the dead, crying of family members... pile by pile, piece by piece hammering on his heart.

In Zhou Lezhi's view, Shorn-hair Thieves counted as "Benevolent and Righteous". Whether killing or looting, they were very restrained. As long as surrendering in time and paying money and grain, basically it counted as committing no crime against the people. Except for the people managing matters, they also didn't implicate innocent commoners. The saying of village slaughter was really a bit excessive.

The Teacher obviously didn't see it this way. It could be seen that his anger was gathering continuously.

This day, they cruised to Sanliang in Dongguan. According to convention, they sought local elders to interview about the past events of Shorn-hair Thieves crossing the border. After listening to the deeds of Qingxia, everyone sighed one after another, saying she was truly a strange woman with affection and righteousness. The group arrived at the graves of Qingxia, Luo Tianqiu, and others to pour wine and offer sacrifice.

Returning to the sitting boat at night, Zhou Lezhi only heard the Teacher muttering to himself: "Beasts!" followed by gritting teeth and saying: "Scum!"
