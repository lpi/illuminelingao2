# Chapter 2535: Preparing to Build a Factory

"In the early Qing, with the opening of trade at the Thirteen Factories, Guangdong's manual cotton textile industry, oriented towards foreign demand, developed rapidly. At that time, Guangdong was still not a cotton-producing area. Before the 1820s, the British East India Company shipped large amounts of Indian cotton to Guangzhou. At that time, the Indian manual textile industry had not yet been completely defeated. However, this matter cannot be explained clearly in one sentence." Actually, after the British textile industry began to develop, domestic cotton was also insufficient. The European continent had France as its competitor, causing cotton prices to skyrocket. In the end, Britain also relied on American colonies and external conquest to continuously obtain cotton. Therefore, the Senate should also let the private sector develop the cotton textile industry. When raw materials are insufficient, the Senate's colonization will gain assistance.

"Moreover, we have Jacquard looms, wide-width cloth, and future chemical dyes." Punch cards had been successfully born, and the flying shuttle was not a particularly difficult craft. Once chemical dyes were mass-produced, they would also be very cheap. The printing and dyeing advantage of Indian cloth was not worth mentioning in front of the Senate.

"Did you call me over to design patterns?" Cheng Milian keenly perceived Li Shan's intention. One must know that besides cost, the pain point of consumer goods popularity lies in design. These three machines were almost all selling points centered on product design.

"Of course. Among the few of us, only you have a bit of artistic talent, so we need your help." Li Shan said.

"17th-century European *nouveau riche* style?" Unconsciously, designs of those real estate properties in the old timeline floated into Cheng Milian's mind. Although always criticized by the art design circle, one had to say, if brought to this era in Lingao, it seemed quite trendy.

"Alright, this side depends on you. Brother Zou and I are going to Guangzhou in some time." Li Shan patted Cheng Milian's shoulder and said.

After the Chen uncle and nephew and Wu Yijun returned from Lingao, they did not return to Nansha immediately. Instead, they began the preparatory work for the Nansha Textile Factory in Guangzhou.

According to the textile factory blueprint designed for them by Li Shan and Zou Biao, the scale of the Nansha Textile Factory was not large, implemented in two phases. This was to accommodate the investors' financial capacity. The first phase was spinning, with a scale of eight hundred spindles; the second phase was spinning and weaving, with a scale of one thousand two hundred spindles and sixty looms.

In Guangzhou, they held a preparatory meeting and decided on their respective divisions of labor.

According to the division of labor, Wu Yijun would stay in Guangzhou, responsible for the procurement and transportation of various raw materials and cotton needed for building the factory; the others went to Nansha. Among them, Uncle and Nephew Chen would carry out land acquisition, river canal excavation, and factory building construction. Chen Xiaobing was responsible for coordinating with the local government. The four-person group of textile interns would be responsible for assisting in building the factory and training workers.

After the division of labor was set, Chen Xiaobing called Chen Lin over and asked, "Are there enough houses in your village? Soon, an engineering team and many technical personnel will be dispatched; they all need places to live."

"If you don't disdain it, they can all be arranged to stay in various villagers' homes." Chen Lin said. "The ancestral hall, silk workshop, and graveyard all have houses available for borrowing. It depends on how many people come."

"Not too many people, thirty or forty. It's just coming and going; staying in others' homes is also quite annoying."

"Then arrange them to the graveyard. If not particular, the *Yang* dwellings [houses for living people, usually caretakers] in the graveyard have no problem accommodating a hundred or so people."

Because the workshop was to be built on Nansha's land, although Wu Yijun bought a lot of land locally, growing cotton on these lands was fine, but they might not be suitable as factory sites; moreover, water-powered machines involved the issue of river usage rights. Although Wu Yijun was an investor and Chen Lin's relative, close brothers must also settle accounts clearly. This involved the issue of the Chen family's shareholding in the new cotton textile factory.

Wu Yijun was quite open-minded about this, stating that if factory land needed to be purchased separately, he could spend the money, and could give the Chen family clan one share for free as reward for their assistance in opening the factory.

The total number of shares of Nansha Textile Factory was thirteen. The Chen family occupying one share without spending a penny was considered very generous terms, but Uncle and Nephew Chen hesitated.

It wasn't that they disliked the terms, but that this involved a fatal problem: who in the Chen family had the final say.

The Chen family of Nansha was not a "family" but a "clan," containing dozens of households and hundreds of people. Theoretically speaking, the "Chen family land" in Nansha Village belonged to the "clan." Regardless of who specifically exerted effort or money when buying land or reclaiming wasteland, disposing of land required the consent of clan members.

Currently, the position of clan leader was vacant, and the "Head of Case" [manager of clan affairs] was usurped by Second Uncle. Any contract he and Third Uncle and Wu Yijun signed, Second Uncle Chen Xuan could declare invalid. He might not be able to accomplish things, but putting a spoke in the wheel was absolutely no problem.

Moreover, Second Uncle had a female Australian backing him. Chen Xiaobing was only a "Fake Kun" after all. If Li Yao'er really came forward to support Second Uncle, Chen Xiaobing's appearance would be useless.

Chen Lin told Wu Yijun his worries in detail. Wu Yijun also felt this was a thorny matter, so he took Chen Lin to ask Chen Xiaobing for a plan.

"...If this Chen Xuan doesn't cooperate, we can't buy land or build canals and houses in Nansha."

Chen Xiaobing nodded: "What you say, the Chief has somewhat thought of."

Guangdong's clan forces were very strong, so Li Shan and others had thought of this long ago. Knowing they were from Nansha, they greeted Li Yao'er in advance.

"Chief Li has already written a letter to Senator Li and said hello. You can rest assured. Chief Li went to Nansha to promote the new silk industry and won't mix into the conflicts between clans." Chen Xiaobing deliberated over his words. "Of course, specifically how to resolve conflicts in your clan still depends on yourselves. As for this contract..." He pondered for a moment. "Do you uncle and nephew have land under your own names?"

"This naturally we have," Chen Lin said indignantly. "Not only do we have it, but the house and land of the silk workshop were also bought by my father; there are deeds too..."

"That's it. Since you have real estate and land under your names, this contract doesn't specify which specific piece of land is taken out to 'invest'. You just sign boldly with confidence. The Senate doesn't recognize the concept of clan land. Zhang San's land is Zhang San's; Li Si's house is Li Si's." After saying that, he looked at Chen Lin meaningfully. "Do you understand?"

"Yes! The small one understands!" Chen Lin responded loudly. Immediately he thought of something again and asked in a low voice, "But Chief Li..."

"No need to be too anxious about Chief Li's side." Chen Xiaobing said. "As long as you can get the textile factory running, Chief Li will naturally have other considerations."

Now Chen Lin had taken a reassurance pill. After discussing with Third Uncle, he signed the shareholding agreement with Wu Yijun in Third Uncle's name.

After the agreement was signed, everyone went separate ways to handle affairs. Wu Yijun rented a big house in Guangzhou as a temporary office. Most construction materials were ordered from Guangzhou. Li Shan gave him a detailed order list of construction materials, detailed to model and quantity without omission, including markings for backup manufacturers and reference purchase prices. He just needed to follow the list.

Uncle and Nephew Chen then took a boat back to Nansha with the others to begin preparatory work.

Uncle and Nephew Chen returning openly and swaggering together made Chen Xuan angry in his heart but helpless. Because this uncle and nephew pair not only colluded with Wu Yijun but also brought the Australian's cadres, securing a Senate "capacity diffusion project."

Of course, in terms of status, Chen Xiaobing, this naturalized citizen cadre, could not compare to Li Yao'er. But in the past, as long as he served well and cooperated well with Li Yao'er's work, he could almost "cover the sky with one hand." Now with a Chen Xiaobing, it was difficult—their words carried more weight between them. Moreover, since Chen Xiaobing arrived, Li Yao'er clearly distanced herself from him. Probably Chen Xiaobing gave him some eye drops [badmouthed him].

And Han Changfu and the others he specially sent to Guangzhou, let alone "fixing" Chen Ding, had even lost contact. Chen Xuan secretly cursed himself for stuffing ten taels of silver into a dog hole!

But now, he could only swallow his anger and make do with "cooperating" with Uncle and Nephew Chen.

Uncle and Nephew Chen did not go home either, moving into the *Yang* dwelling of the graveyard with the work team. Subsequently, the internship group began the site exploration work around Nansha Village.

Because the water power textile factory involved the use of water power, site selection was particularly important. The four students of the textile internship group had a special course in school called "How to Build a Factory." This might be unimaginable for the textile major in another spacetime, but at this moment, it was very useful knowledge.

Accompanied by Chen Lin, the internship group conducted extensive exploration around the larger rivers in Nansha to choose a suitable factory site.

The factory site itself had many requirements, such as flat land and good foundation conditions. But the most important condition, Li Guo told Chen Lin, was the flow of river water.

"...Because we need to use water power to drive machines, there must be faster water volume. So the factory site must be as close to the river as possible, and nearby transportation must also be convenient, the closer to navigable rivers the better. At the same time, this land must have enough area to have enough space when expanding."

"So building an Australian factory requires such complicated work!" Chen Lin sighed. Watching them fiddle with various equipment and instruments, he felt ashamed of his unworthiness—he was truly too ignorant.

"The demonstration textile factory in Nanbao doesn't have a big river nearby." He remembered something and asked.

"Good question," An Jiu looked up and smiled. "They use steam engines there—which need to burn coal. Do you have coal here?"

"Coal... we have, but it's expensive..."

"That's it. Whether burning coal or wood, it's a big expense. This water is free to use; isn't that good?"

"Then why didn't the Demonstration Factory use water power? Could it be because there was no river?"

"That's not it. Actually, if conditions allow, using steam engines is more cost-effective. It can drive more machines, tens of thousands of spindles, hundreds of machines. And you can open it wherever you want."
