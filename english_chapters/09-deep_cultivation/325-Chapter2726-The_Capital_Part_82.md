# Chapter 2726: The Capital (Part 82)

Shortly after Liu Zhao left, Zhou Lezhi paced a few circles in the courtyard—an old habit of his. When he felt anxious, he soothed himself this way. It was also a method his master had taught him.

His mood was quite troubled. Kidnapping Leng Ningyun was really a gamble. If the plan was exposed, not only would peace talks fail, but the situation he had painstakingly cultivated for Lord Wang over many years would collapse in an instant.

The Australians were cunning by nature, most skilled at scheming and espionage. They would exploit the slightest flaw. Could Liu Sha's sudden loss of contact mean something had gone wrong?

Thinking of this, he shuddered. Liu Sha occupied a central position in this operation. If he was lost, the entire plan would instantly fall apart. Not only that, it would put himself in danger.

Of course, Liu Sha didn't know where he was, just as he didn't know where Liu Sha was in Tongzhou. But once the other side caught Liu Sha, he couldn't count on Liu Sha's loyalty. Following the vines, they would eventually find traces.

Thinking of this, he could no longer stay calm. He immediately called out, "Wang Zhi!"

Wang Zhi had been busy in the gatehouse. Hearing the summons, he immediately ran over. "Sir..."

"Pack up immediately. We're leaving this place."

Wang Zhi was startled. "Sir, our lease isn't up yet. If we leave now, what do we tell the monks? And you still have scheduled clinic appointments."

"Write a note and hang it on the door. Say we had urgent business and went back to our hometown for now, but will return soon. Tell the monks to keep the house for us; rent is paid through the end of the year," Zhou Lezhi instructed. "Leave everything unnecessary where it is. Just bring the important things."

"Yes!" Wang Zhi acknowledged, then asked, "Sir, where are we moving to?"

"To the lodging in the western part of the city."

For safety, besides the old residence at Wanggong Factory in the south city, he had secretly purchased a small courtyard in the west city as an emergency hiding place.

Several people in Wang Yehao's group knew about the southern city residence. Before planning this operation, for safety, he had quietly moved his family from the Wanggong Factory residence to that place. He practiced medicine at Chongxiao Temple as a contact point.

Now that Liu Sha's whereabouts were unknown, if he had been captured, not only would the southern city residence certainly be raided, but this place wouldn't be safe either.

"Leave someone at the temple to watch if anyone comes asking questions," Zhou Lezhi instructed. "Also send someone to notify Wang Liang."

"Yes, sir."

"This is the Nanyuan Earth God Temple?" Li Rufeng said in surprise.

"It is," Wu Cheng answered.

"Wasn't this temple imperially commissioned? How has it fallen into such disrepair?"

"The Emperor hasn't come for over a hundred years. The Superintendent's Office is falling apart—who would care about an imperially commissioned earth god temple?" Wu Cheng said with feeling. "At least the buildings haven't collapsed."

Ningyou Temple was in terrible shape. Many years ago, when the Emperor still frequently drove to Nanyuan for horseback hunts, this temple had thriving incense offerings. But for nearly a century now, no one had paid attention to it.

Though decrepit, the temple's scale remained. Dozens of ancient scholar trees and willows grew bare around it. Their bare branches swayed in the cold wind.

The terrain wasn't exactly treacherous, but the surroundings were all empty wilderness and marshes. Approaching even slightly would be noticed by those inside. So several *li* away, they stopped advancing and chose a densely wooded area to hide first, observing with binoculars.

The temple seemed surrounded by wild grassland, but looking carefully, the north and east sides had large areas of marshes and waterways, now frozen over. Withered yellow reeds trembled in the cold wind. This place was only about five *li* from the Eagle-Airing Platform—a water country within Nanyuan.

Li Rufeng was secretly alarmed. If the kidnapping had happened during spring or summer flooding, they wouldn't even need temples or buildings. With just a small boat hidden in these thousand *mu* of reed marshes, that would truly be finding a needle in the ocean!

Now that the marshes and waterways were frozen, while it made it easier for the villains to keep watch, it also left them nowhere to flee.

The temple halls had become dens for foxes and rats. The courtyard was overgrown with thorns, the pavilions dusty. The roof was open to the sky, and rotting walls had become doorways. If left unattended, it would eventually be swallowed by the wild garden. But like a centipede that doesn't stop twitching after death, this ancient temple with over ten bays still had places to shelter from wind and rain. From the cleared vegetable garden, the roughly patched walls, and wisps of black smoke drifting up into the sky, it was clear people still lived inside.

It was deep winter now. No one moved outside. From the smoking chimneys, he could tell at least three or four rooms were still occupied.

Suddenly, the sound of horses whinnying came from the temple, followed by several answering calls. Li Rufeng was startled: There were horses inside?

Wu Cheng suddenly became alert. Without waiting for him to speak, he muttered, "Hm? Why are there horses?"

"Old Wu, how many people live in this temple?"

"Just the abbot and his two disciples," Wu Cheng said. "All former eunuchs. The abbot is very old; the disciples are both past fifty. They spent their whole lives muddling through in the palace. Now they stay here, collecting a little money and rice to barely get by..."

"Good!" Li Rufeng was slightly excited. If there were only three people, there couldn't be three or four heating stoves. Though firewood wasn't hard to find in Nanyuan, they were all elderly and gathering wood wasn't easy. They couldn't be so wasteful.

"Good my ass!" Wu Cheng wore only a ragged cotton jacket with many patches. He only had the courage to come out to the wilderness in this season because the escort bureau had given him an old sheepskin vest. But even that couldn't withstand the biting wind of the northern wilderness. Shivering, he wiped his runny nose with his sleeve. "Are you done looking? If so, let's hurry to the next place."

"Don't rush." Li Rufeng chuckled. These Australian binoculars really worked well! He could see clearly from several *li* away!

Perhaps because of the freezing cold, there were no signs of hidden sentries around the temple perimeter. But atop the temple's dilapidated gate tower, he clearly saw a man in black, crouching behind broken lattice panels. In front of him was a small brazier; he rubbed his hands and blew on them from time to time.

A ruined temple, three impoverished eunuch-Daoists—obviously no need to hire someone specifically to keep watch. Who this person was, was now written plainly.

He immediately signaled his subordinates: "Approach from three sides for observation!"

Three escort masters slipped away immediately. Seeing this, Wu Cheng was startled and said in a low voice, "Chief Escort, are you going to..."

"Big things are happening!" Li Rufeng said. "If we succeed, you'll have your share of fortune!"

"This... this... this..." Wu Cheng started trembling involuntarily. "If there's going to be fighting, I'd rather not have my share..." He was about to say "leave," but seeing Li Rufeng's eyes already full of killing intent, he swallowed his words.

"How many people can the temple house at most?" he asked sharply.

"About twenty..."

"Twenty-one or twenty-nine?!"

"In winter... at most... at most twenty," Wu Cheng stammered.

"Besides the main gate, where else can people enter and exit?"

Wu Cheng said with a pained expression, "There's a door in the back. After it collapsed, the abbot blocked it up. There are side gates on both the east and west sides. Also locked every day."

"When was the last time you came here?"

"Since winter set in, I haven't been here. This place is remote, and... and..."

"And there's no profit to be had, right?"

"You understand, sir. I can't live without worldly sustenance."

Li Rufeng was now certain that Leng Ningyun was hidden here. But he had brought only seven or eight escort masters to explore Nanyuan. If there were twenty people inside, he wasn't confident he could take the place in one stroke. The people inside also had horses. If they put Senator Leng on horseback and rode away, his group could never catch up.

After about half an hour, the three escort masters sent to reconnoiter returned. They reported that the north, west, and east sides showed nothing unusual. There were no hidden sentries outside the temple. All three doors were closed. At the dock behind, there was a boat, now frozen into the marsh.

Li Rufeng immediately left three people to monitor the site while he took the others by the shortest route out of Nanyuan—he needed to gather more people.

The temple was dilapidated, with few buildings, but more than twenty people had gathered inside. Sneaking in quietly for a surprise attack was virtually impossible. The only option now was to mass superior forces and rush in all at once to protect Senator Leng's safety. Fortunately, the other side saw Senator Leng as precious cargo and wouldn't easily kill him. As long as their side moved fast enough, it would be fine.

He immediately sent someone by fast horse to Haidian to notify Liao Sanniang, while also gathering more people. Notifying Liao Sanniang wasn't to have her come as reinforcement but to have her guard the silver carefully. According to Min Zhanlian's squad's intelligence, the enemy was eyeing the silver at the estate and planned to "take it by wit"—they had to be extra careful.

Heliansheng had over a hundred people, including escort masters and hired hands. About a third were at the Haidian estate guarding the silver. Over ten more were at Delong Bank providing protection—though with Shuntian Prefecture's seals on the doors, no one would dare touch it, so not many hands were needed. The remaining fifty-plus people took shifts roaming throughout the city, gathering leads.

Li Rufeng decided not to recall them immediately—it would be too conspicuous. Instead, he would wait until after the evening drum. The capital had nightly curfew as usual. The escort masters going out would have to return to the bureau.

That evening, an escort master came to report: "The messenger escort and Little Bazi have returned!"

Li Rufeng was secretly puzzled. If Liao Sanniang had a message, she could just have the messenger escort bring it back. Why specifically send this youth back?

"Chief Escort!" Little Bazi bowed deeply. "I bring a message from Lady Sanniang." He then recited the message word for word: Lady Sanniang now knew the situation and would guard carefully. She asked the Chief Escort to proceed boldly.

"Understood." Li Rufeng nodded. "Go rest."

"Lady Sanniang also said: please look after me, Chief Escort!" With that, he dropped to his knees.

Li Rufeng was startled, then immediately understood Liao Sanniang's intent. He laughed and lightly kicked Little Bazi. "You little monkey! Just gone a few days and you've already grabbed onto Lady Sanniang's thick thigh!"

"Please grant it, Chief Escort!" Little Bazi said loudly.

"Fine!" Li Rufeng nodded. "I agree! Now go sleep!"
