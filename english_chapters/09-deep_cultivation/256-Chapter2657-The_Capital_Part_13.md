# Chapter 2657: The Capital (Part 13)

Liao Sanniang stopped asking questions. She began slapping Wang Shizhen in a steady rhythm. Her hand was extraordinarily hard—harder than the shoe soles specifically kept in the yamen for face-slapping. With each blow, Wang Shizhen's face swelled another layer. The crisp crack of palm meeting flesh sent chills down everyone's spine. Manager Xiao broke out in goosebumps and couldn't stop trembling.

At that moment, the porter keeping watch outside entered again. "Sanniangzi, we've found Steward Zhang. He didn't come to work yesterday—fled, apparently. Not sure what he was thinking, but he returned home today looking for his children, and we caught him. He'll be here shortly."

Liao Sanniang stayed her hand. She drew a Dutch linen handkerchief from her bosom, elegantly wiped the bloodstains from her fingers, gave a slight nod, and said, "When he arrives, bring him in to confront Wang Shizhen."

The porter bowed and hurried out.

Wu Kaidi and the others sitting nearby all drew sharp breaths at Liao Sanniang's display.

Wu Kaidi shook his head. "Everyone says Sanniangzi's plumes are made of gold. Today I realize that saying is greatly mistaken."

Liao Sanniang turned to look at him. "Oh?" she inquired, her raspy voice rising slightly.

Wu Kaidi smiled bitterly. "Sanniangzi's wings are made of knives."

At this, Liao Sanniang covered the corner of her mouth with her handkerchief and giggled, her body trembling with laughter. After a moment, she rested her left hand lightly on the double sabers at her waist and whispered, "My knives—no one has seen them."

Steward Zhang was escorted up. He was a fat man, which was nothing short of a miracle in this Little Ice Age where hunger and cold prevailed everywhere.

Little Bazi kicked Steward Zhang and reported, "Sanniangzi, this filthy rascal knew he couldn't escape and couldn't bear to leave his family behind, so we managed to corner him."

Steward Zhang was panting violently, as though he had just run five thousand meters. Sweat had soaked through several layers of his clothes, and the fat on his face twitched continuously. With trembling hands, he held up a written confession and rasped, "Wang Shizhen, that old pimp, used a prostitute as bait to lure this lowly one into trouble. This lowly one should never have been so blind as to fall for this bastard's beauty trap. But this lowly one would absolutely never dare betray Delong. I was simply too afraid—hesitant, not knowing what to do—and in my confusion, I fled for half a day."

Liao Sanniang asked softly, "Then why did Steward Zhang come back?"

At her question, he shook even more violently, his teeth chattering. In a tearful voice, he stammered, "This lowly one thought it through afterward. Though Sanniangzi has only been handling affairs in the capital for a year, everyone walking the *Jianghu* roads across the thirty-six wards knows that Sanniangzi's reach extends to the clouds. No matter how fast my legs are, they can't outrun Sanniangzi's knife. Running around outside is no better than coming back. Though I've caused a great disaster, it was an unintentional mistake. I beg the Chief Escort and Sanniangzi to see clearly. This lowly one has written a confession to turn himself in. I will bear all the punishment myself—I only beg that my old mother, wife, and children not be implicated." Having touched upon his sorrow, he couldn't help but prostrate himself and weep bitterly.

Hearing that her reputation had grown so formidable, the corners of Liao Sanniang's mouth curled upward with a touch of pride. But when she turned to look at Steward Zhang—a man who had whored and visited prostitutes yet now put on an act of being framed and wronged—she felt a wave of nausea rise in her chest.

Little Bazi leaned in and whispered, "Sanniangzi! Don't believe his tragic story. He only wrote that confession after we caught him. If we hadn't detained his family, he never would have written it!"

Liao Sanniang walked slowly to Steward Zhang's side and took the confession. Glancing at it, she noticed the bloodstains on the signature at the bottom—a blood letter, written by biting his finger. She gently patted his shoulder. "The bandits designed this scheme with great deliberation. Even if this beauty trap hadn't worked, they would have used other methods. Steward Zhang, though your crime is unforgivable, your circumstances are pitiable. The brothel is a pit that traps men. Ruining your own future for a prostitute—why bother? However, you thought to care for your old mother, wife, and children, which shows you have at least a shred of conscience. I appreciate this bit of filial piety. If you can establish merit to atone for your crimes, I will exonerate you. For now, go confront that Wang Shizhen to verify the truth. How you are dealt with depends entirely on how you conduct yourself. Look out for yourself."

With that, Liao Sanniang no longer spared a glance for Steward Zhang or Wang Shizhen. She turned to Little Bazi and asked, "Has that prostitute been caught?"

Little Bazi shook his head. "We didn't get her."

Li Rufeng said, "Nine chances out of ten, she's already been silenced." Then he addressed Wang and Zhang: "Don't think being caught is bad luck. If you hadn't been caught, you'd probably have been silenced by now! The people who dared move against Master Leng's men in the capital—do you think they're the merciful type?"

Liao Sanniang frowned and instructed in a low voice, "We have many matters to attend to here, so we can't deal with this now. Take the two of them away. Don't lock them in the same place—interrogate them separately. Don't take Steward Zhang's story at face value. Pry their lips open. Report to me immediately after we disperse."

Little Bazi nodded without another word, bowed in salute, and took Steward Zhang and Wang Shizhen away with a few of the men.

Though the specific details remained unknown, combining what she had learned from the captured Steward Zhang with the letters, Sanniang had already formed a rough picture in her mind. She had someone bring out a large-scale map of the area outside Xizhimen and spread it on the table to study.

The Wild Tea House at Caoqiao was a fairly well-known establishment outside Xizhimen, situated right along the official road to Haidian, less than three kilometers from the gate. The place had pleasant scenery—river ponds and flowers and trees—a spot outside the city where travelers could rest and enjoy the view. Usually, many passing travelers and tourists gathered there. Choosing this location for the meeting was probably meant to lower Leng Ningyun's guard.

"They struck midway; Master Leng didn't anticipate this," Li Rufeng said. "The Wild Tea House is usually crowded. The owner is the local Tithing Head, and many government runners gather there too."

"But according to the confession Head Constable Qi brought, the man named Jiang who discovered the scene said the attack happened at dusk." Sanniangzi frowned. "On Master Leng's schedule, the meeting was set for noon that day."

For a moment, no one could untangle the specific tricks at play. They all vaguely sensed that this opponent who had attacked Master Leng was not the sort of bandit or robber they were accustomed to dealing with. Yet none of them could articulate exactly what felt "wrong."

Wu Kaidi rested his chin on his hand and sighed. "I've followed Master Leng for several years now. Except for the first year, when I didn't know the Master's background and felt like I was walking on thin ice, the years after that seemed like smooth sailing. No matter how big the wind and waves, I always felt everything was under control. Only today do I find myself somewhat lost..."

Liao Sanniang smiled. "Don't say that—who among us isn't? After all, losing a Senator... this is the first time. This opponent is truly formidable—no ordinary person."

...

Just as they were speaking, someone suddenly reported that Assistant Managers Xiao and Wei had arrived.

"Invite them in," Wu Kaidi said. Li and Liao exchanged a glance involuntarily.

The two Assistant Managers entered and briefly described their visits to clients. They had visited seven or eight in total. Upon hearing the news, most were shocked and urged them to find the person quickly. None had proposed to withdraw their money.

Wu Kaidi nodded slightly, though something felt strange. The clients the two Assistant Managers had visited were all so-called "third-type depositors." Their wealth was ostensibly deposited at Delong in the capital, but in reality, it had already been transferred to Guangzhou. They simply maintained passbooks in the capital for the convenience of using silver. These people knew quite a bit about the Senate, so such feedback was not unexpected.

Just then, Little Bazi suddenly walked up to the hall, looking excited. Seeing him, Liao Sanniang knew something had happened and hurried forward to meet him.

Little Bazi looked left and right, cupped his hand to his mouth like a trumpet, and whispered a few words in Liao Sanniang's ear. Her eyebrows rose, and her expression shifted several times in rapid succession, finally settling into one of joy. When she straightened again, Liao Sanniang had adopted the composure of someone with a well-thought-out plan.

Liao Sanniang surveyed her surroundings, smiled confidently, and announced, "Masters, please be at ease. I will make a bold claim here: within a month, this matter will have an outcome."

Everyone immediately understood that Wang Shizhen must have talked—important confessions must have been extracted. Seeing Liao Sanniang speak with such certainty, their spirits lifted.

Only Li Rufeng's eyes flickered as he glanced at her.

Wu Kaidi was about to ask, but Liao Sanniang's gaze sharpened and she spoke first. "This matter concerns Master Leng's safety; the secret cannot be carelessly leaked. The intricacies of the *Jianghu* are something you masters probably cannot help with. This humble woman must beg your pardon here. After the matter is settled, I will tell you everything."

Wu Kaidi was taken aback and swallowed the question that had risen to his lips.

Liao Sanniang's face bloomed like peach blossoms as she smiled charmingly. "On the day Master Leng returns, I will drink with you all."

The meeting dispersed. Li Rufeng stood facing the hall, his back to Liao Sanniang. He watched the departing crowd, was silent for a while, and then suddenly said, "There is no news, is there? One month. If things don't work out after one month, what then?"

Liao Sanniang replied leisurely, "In this Beijing City, the Political Security Bureau cannot enter, and the Military Intelligence Bureau cannot act openly. The only martial organization that can operate freely is Heliansheng. If Guangzhou sends people, traveling by sea to land at Tianjin, then riding hard—that takes half a month at the fastest. We can't afford to wait; we must sort out a lead as soon as possible. Earlier, I told Little Bazi to come in after a quarter of an hour and report something—no matter what, just whisper a few sentences. Only when everyone sees that things are improving will people's hearts stay steady. Although Wu Kaidi and the others harbor no disloyalty, they come from merchant and servant backgrounds, with timid and cautious temperaments. If not given something to hold onto, I fear they will collapse. In the Australian new language, this is called... Hope?"

Li Rufeng said, "A Spiritual Pillar."

Liao Sanniang laughed. "Right, just like the golden pillar supporting the great hall." She sighed again. "I am calming their hearts—but aren't they also calming ours?"

"There's also the purpose of testing loyalties in it." Li Rufeng chuckled twice.

"It becomes tedious if spoken too plainly."

Li Rufeng sighed. "The harder the Senate's army fights, the more stable we are. Only when the army is at the city gates can we be as steady as Mount Tai."

Liao Sanniang said, "It's just that in the current situation—this fighting and stopping—it has become a limbo, with the most variables."
