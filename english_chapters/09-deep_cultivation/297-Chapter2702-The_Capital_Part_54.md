# Chapter 2702: The Capital (Part 54)

Leng Ningyun existed in a state of twilight within the room, unaware of the sun or moon, having completely lost all concept of time. The room confining him not only had the shutters outside the windows fully lowered but also had an extra layer of black cloth on the inside. A lamp was kept burning at all times. This made him lose track of time entirely.

When tired, he would extinguish the oil lamp to sleep. Upon waking, he would find the lamp lit again, only trimmed very low.

Three meals a day were delivered by someone, and the doorway also had double layers of curtains, inside and out. In short, no light penetrated, and he could see nothing.

Aside from this, the band of kidnappers treated him quite well. The three daily meals were refined and delicious, and the room was even stocked with "Australian books" published by the Wanbi Bookshop. Fresh clothes were sent daily, and two maids served him personally—serving tea, pouring water, helping him wash and change. They even played chess or cards with him, sang songs, or played the qin. If he showed any restless urges, they were available to serve in bed as well.

Leng Ningyun was used to living like a grand master at Delong, but being cared for with such meticulous attention while kidnapped was a first. He truly didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Fortunately, having a background in finance, he had experienced all sorts of situations.

The other party vaguely seemed to be a transmigrator as well. Presumably, they wouldn't be too cruel. They kidnapped him to seek peace; at least for a while, his life shouldn't be in danger.

Given the ethos of the Senate, a Senator's life was paramount. Whether through diplomatic or martial means, he believed that once they received his letter, arrangements would be made quickly.

Thus, he ate and slept well. Since he couldn't go anywhere, he could only do "prisoner fitness" exercises in the room, or perhaps engage in some "two-person combat."

One day—he didn't know when—someone came in and bowed, saying, "Please, Master, we are moving you to a new location." With that, someone entered and bound his hands and feet with ropes—not tightly, just enough to restrict his movement. A gag was placed in his mouth, and finally, a black cloth hood was pulled over his head.

In this darkness, he let others lead him by the hand, taking small steps. Someone ahead guided him to lift his feet over thresholds and down steps. Suddenly, his skin felt cool, and a slight breeze blew past—he was likely outdoors.

"Please enter the sedan chair, Master." Someone guided him into a sedan. Shortly after, he heard a low voice say: "Lift the sedan!"

The sedan rose and swayed along the journey. It was very quiet outside; occasionally, cats or dogs barked, but there was no sound of the night watchman's clapper. It was likely a desolate village. As time passed, the sedan began to bump and heave, and he could occasionally hear the low warning calls of the bearers. The wind outside grew stronger, and the air carried the raw, green scent of vegetation.

*Did we enter the mountains?* Leng Ningyun wondered. The air also carried a faint smell of rotting aquatic plants, suggesting the presence of lakes or rivers.

After an unknown amount of time, just as he was becoming drowsy, the sedan stopped. Someone helped him out, and once again he entered a building, ascending steps into a room where his restraints were removed.

The hood was taken off. Leng Ningyun opened his eyes, but the flickering lamplight stung them. He closed them again, waiting a moment before reopening them to adjust to the dim light.

Although the interior furnishings were different from the previous room, all the necessary furniture and items were present. However, the furniture was much rougher and simpler, and the beams and pillars lacked decoration. The ceiling height was also significantly lower. Though simple, it was still a brick-and-tile structure, looking like the home of a well-off rural landlord.

The windows, like before, were tightly sealed. Outside, there was dead silence.

He estimated he had ridden in the sedan for about two hours (one *shichen*), so he wasn't too far from the original location. He had heard almost no pedestrians along the way; he was likely in a remote part of the countryside.

A square table stood before him, upon which sat an Australian oil lamp. In front of the lamp was a bowl of medicinal soup, its curling steam looking hazy and blurred in the halo of the light.

Leng Ningyun stretched his neck. Turning his head slightly, a long sword leaning against a chair to the side caught his eye.

Immediately, a voice sounded from behind him: "Do not turn around." The voice was gentle and sounded warm, yet it was impossible to distinguish whether it belonged to a man or a woman.

Leng Ningyun's neck stiffened instantly. He replied, "Yes."

The voice spoke again: "You have had a hard journey, Sir."

Leng Ningyun didn't speak, listening silently.

The voice continued: "Blocking your view today is only to allow you to relax a little. Mr. Leng, you are accustomed to a life of luxury and have a delicate body. Now that you are in adversity, I fear anxiety might attack your heart and the hardships of travel might be unbearable. You are a noble person, Mr. Leng; you must not die. Before you is a soup to calm the spirit, dispel internal heat, and replenish *qi*. Please drink it."

Leng Ningyun obediently picked up the bowl from the table and took a sip. The bitterness made him frown.

The voice went on: "Mr. Leng, in a moment, your two maids will come to serve you with washing your feet, using the toilet, drinking tea, and eating. If you hear a knock at the door, please sit facing the wall and do not look at the person entering. As long as you follow arrangements, do not struggle, and do not make trouble, you will remain safe."

Leng Ningyun said, "I will follow your instructions, brave hero."

The voice fell silent for a moment, then suddenly said, "I have read the Australians' books. They are very good; they are theories for saving the world."

Leng Ningyun's heart skipped a beat, and he let out a soft "Oh?"

The person spoke no more. A hand reached past Leng Ningyun and took the long sword leaning against the chair.

Out of the corner of his eye, Leng Ningyun saw the hand taking the sword. It was very pale and had a sheen to it.

The door behind him closed with a thud.

Leng Ningyun looked around the dim room. He suddenly thought of that sword.

Since the Song Dynasty, the long sword had lost its utility as a weapon of war, replaced by the dao (saber), and had gradually withdrawn from the battlefield to become a decorative plaything for literati or a ritual implement for nobles and generals to show status. Some Ming officials and officers even wore wooden swords just to put on airs.

But that sword was different. It was very long, with a scabbard of red sharkskin over wood. The hilt was hand-and-a-half length, allowing for single or double-handed grip. The guard was carved with scrolling flowers, and the pommel had a hole threaded with a dark red wrist retention cord. The wrapping on the hilt had a faint crimson hue—the color of soaked blood—proclaiming it a sword for killing.

Leng Ningyun thought blankly. Among the martial artists he had seen—whether Ming soldiers, escort masters, or gallants of the *jianghu*—no one used a *jian* (straight sword) in actual combat. That was why the sword had left such a deep impression on him.

That sword was red. Red enough to catch the eye, red enough to pierce the heart. Red like a wound.

***

Two sturdy mules pulled a large cart, rumbling along the main road. The cargo on the cart wasn't piled high, but the wheels crushed deep into the unpaved surface, leaving profound ruts that betrayed a heavy load.

Old Feng, bundled in thick cotton clothes, sat slumped on the mule cart, driving.

Old Feng seemed a bit listless, but unlike the man, his whip was exceptionally spirited. The handle was of jujube wood, and the connection to the tanned leather lash was decorated with a tuft of fluffy red tassels. At every ditch or bump, Old Feng would seemingly casually flick his wrist, and the lash tip would crack opportunely over the mules' heads, startling them into exerting force to pull. One crack of the whip added three thousand pounds of strength. Only the best teamsters possessed such composure and languor.

A dozen or so fellows in motley attire walked slowly alongside the cart.

Liao Sanniang, Zhao Liangjian, and Liu Chang each rode a miscellaneous horse. The three horses spread out in a line, guarding the head and tail of the cart. Little Bazi rode a donkey, following behind Liao Sanniang.

Liao Sanniang had been out of the city for some time. The two empty carts used as decoys had already returned. She had circled a few times to ensure no one was following before linking up with the silver cart and heading toward the estate outside the city.

When leaving the city, several constables and helpers from the Shuntian Prefecture guarding the various points had seen them. They would likely report to Judge Liu by now, but Judge Liu had secretly given word that they could "act as they saw fit." As long as they didn't fight and kill within the city or cause a huge commotion, the Shuntian Prefecture would pretend not to see.

Liao Sanniang stopped her horse, took out a handkerchief to dab the sweat from her forehead, and glanced back out of the corner of her eye. Seeing Little Bazi following behind with a heavy heart, she couldn't help but feel strange. She asked, "You monkey, usually you never have a quiet moment. What's wrong today? Did you catch a chill?"

Little Bazi squeezed his donkey's flanks, catching up to stop alongside Liao Sanniang. He hemmed and hawed for a while before suddenly looking up and shouting loudly, "Lady Sanniang, I sincerely wish to acknowledge you as my adoptive mother. I implore you to agree."

Liao Sanniang was startled, then laughed. "How old am I? How could I take in such a big son? It would only make people gossip."

Old Feng glanced over, a half-smile on his face.

Little Bazi hesitated for a moment, then suddenly rolled off his donkey. On the dirt ground, he banged his head three times in loud kowtows and shouted, "Since entering the Bureau, I have been indebted to Lady Sanniang's care and promotion. My gratitude is deep. My family is poor and my life cheap; I have nothing to repay you with. I can only offer this rascal body. Whenever there is fighting or killing, I will be my Adoptive Mother's vanguard, charging in and out of the forests of swords and spears. I will die without regret. Please, Lady Sanniang, grant my wish."

Liao Sanniang lightly pulled the reins. The horse beneath her tilted its head slightly, gave a loud snort, and stood still, its front hooves pawing the ground restlessly.

Little Bazi looked at Liao Sanniang out of the corner of his eye. Against the backlight, he could only see a black silhouette, unable to make out her expression.

The person on the horse remained silent for a long time. Little Bazi's heart sank, feeling that things were going poorly and his wish today might not be fulfilled.

Beans-sized drops of sweat dripped from Little Bazi's cheeks into the dust. He suddenly felt a trace of regret; he shouldn't have been so hasty. Although Liao Sanniang was heroic, she was still a woman, and her skin likely wasn't as thick as a man's. He should have asked someone else to mediate calmly first; it would have been easier to speak openly once both sides were settled. acting so recklessly today was akin to forcing Liao Sanniang into a corner. If she rejected him, there would be no room to turn back.

Suddenly, a raspy laugh sounded by his ear. Liao Sanniang said, "You mischievous monkey. I'll take you in. But my eyes are sharp, my hand is hard, and I have many rules. I don't tolerate sand in my eyes, and I don't forgive mistakes. Can you endure a beating?"

Little Bazi was overjoyed. He scrambled up and said, "Thank you, Adoptive Mother, for granting my wish! My skin is rough and my flesh is thick; I can take scolding and I can take beatings."

Liao Sanniang said, "Get up. Although you are my adopted son, you must still send a formal card and hold a banquet when we return, to be counted as entering my Liao family's door."
