# Chapter 2782: The Capital (Part 138)

Zhao Liangjian spat out the tobacco residue from his mouth and spat another mouthful of phlegm. Ever since the Emperor banned tobacco, his habit of smoking dry tobacco could only be quit. But for people like them busy working outside, staying up late was inevitable, and they couldn't do without something to refresh themselves. Fortunately, Third Sister had plenty of fresh stuff from Nanyang (Southeast Asia). Without dry tobacco, there was still snuff and chewing tobacco available.

Snuff easily caused sneezing when inhaled, exposing the target. So chewing tobacco, which had a stronger kick and didn't cause sneezing, became his new favorite.

He and several partners had been squatting here at Wanggong Factory one after another for several days, and everything was as usual. But today, they discovered an abnormality.

原本, the sedan chair that went out to offer incense only returned one in the afternoon. The other one returned hurriedly only when the sky was about to turn dusk. Judging from the unusually quick steps of the sedan chair bearers and the panic expression that the accompanying servants and maids couldn't conceal, obviously something went wrong.

Zhao Liangjian immediately noticed that the footsteps of the sedan chair bearers were very brisk, and the sedan chair felt "floating," which meant they were carrying an empty sedan chair!

When going out before noon, it was solidly loaded with a person inside. What about now?

Except for visiting relatives or returning to their maiden home, female relatives of big households would absolutely not stay overnight outside. Both You Rong and Yui were outsiders and had no relatives to speak of in the Capital.

Who was the person who didn't return? Although the surveillance personnel couldn't see the person in the sedan chair, they had already figured out who the accompanying servants and maids were when the two "Madams" went out. Generally speaking, while male servants taken outside might change, servant women were close-fitting attendants and wouldn't be changed easily.

The one following the sedan chair was exactly You Rong's servant maid.

So, You Rong ran away!

Zhao Liangjian immediately said a few words to the person beside him, then got up and rushed back to He Lian Sheng (Union Victory) all the way.

"I already know about this matter." Third Sister said calmly.

Ever since knowing that the abductor (Kai Tiaozi) was Pan Cheng'an and he was doing illicit things in Ganlu Nunnery, Third Sister had people keep an eye on this place. Of course, this was against the rules. Because this had neither the employer's entrustment nor the mission's need. However, out of sympathy, Third Sister was unwilling to watch helplessly as You Rong fell into hell.

But since it was a matter against the rules, Liao Sanliang (Third Sister) didn't find it convenient to spend too many resources on this, so she only sent a miscellaneous work teenager to stare nearby.

Like other bodyguard agencies, He Lian Sheng took in many dependents of bodyguards who died in the line of duty at the counter. People's natural endowments were different; not everyone could eat the bowl of rice of a bodyguard. Those who couldn't do it just did odd jobs to mix a bowl of rice to eat.

Fortunately, staking out a fixed location didn't require any talent; being able to endure loneliness and boredom was enough.

"Little Dezi came back more than a shichen (two hours) ago saying something happened in Ganlu Nunnery." Liao Sanliang said, "The nuns in the nunnery are now like ants on a hot pan..."

"So..."

"You Rong has run away for at least more than a shichen. The specific situation is still unknown." Liao Sanliang said, "I have sent people to inquire at various bodyguard agencies. You Rong is not a woman of an ordinary family. Being abducted, Wu Yan inevitably has to bear responsibility. She will mostly likely try to find her."

Reporting to officials was useless for this matter; only asking bodyguard agencies to take action would work.

"Then it doesn't matter." Zhao Liangjian breathed a sigh of relief.

"You'd better continue staring at the Zhou residence. You Rong running away will inevitably alarm the Wang family. Maybe some big fish will be drawn out from this."

"Understood!"

A few days later, He Lian Sheng reported the latest situation to the Zhangjiawan Headquarters using the radio through the communicator stationed in the bodyguard agency.

You Rong was confirmed to have run away. After running away, Wu Yan secretly went to the bodyguard agency to ask someone to find the person. He Lian Sheng didn't take this case, but had already communicated with relevant bodyguard agencies to notify them as soon as there was news.

Xu Ke held the report. The matter of someone seducing a woman in the Zhou residence to elope itself had no profit (value). But the report sent today was very important.

In the few days after the incident, many people entered and left the Zhou residence. Surveillance personnel discovered that one teenager among them was very suspicious. He not only traveled between the Wang residence and the Zhou residence many times but also had very strong anti-tracking and anti-reconnaissance awareness.

It was a pity that there was neither a camera nor a sketch artist here to record the image of the suspicious person in real time. Otherwise, they could let Liu Sha identify him.

However, being able to enter and leave the Zhou residence frequently, it was highly likely he was Shi Weng's person. Ten out of ten Liu Sha had seen him.

He came to the room where Liu Sha was detained. Liu Sha's body had roughly recovered, but he was still very weak.

"Liu Sha, among Shi Weng's subordinates, is there a teenager of fourteen or fifteen years old?"

"Yes."

"Oh? What does he look like."

Liu Sha didn't answer him but asked back: "How do you know there is such a person?"

"He has been seen entering and leaving the Zhou residence at Wanggong Factory frequently recently."

"This chick (young bird)!" Liu Sha cursed in a low voice.

"You know him?"

"Naturally I know him," Liu Sha said, "The only one who is fifteen or sixteen years old and can enter and leave the Zhou residence frequently is my apprentice."

"Your apprentice?"

"Yes, his great name (formal name) is Xu Yong."

"How come you have such an apprentice?"

"It was also a predestined chance." Immediately he recounted the past event of arranging a daughter for Master Zhou back then, "...I kept this child by my side."

"How is this Xu Yong?"

"An extremely smart and capable person. Zhou Lezhi also values him very much, saying that given time, he can greatly inherit his mantle. It's just..."

"Just what?"

"His temper is a bit stubborn." Liu Sha smiled, "For people serving on duty, being too stubborn is not good..."

"Why does he frequent the Zhou residence?"

"He can be considered half a disciple of Mr. Zhou." Liu Sha smiled, "This child values affection and loyalty. After Master Zhou disappeared, he has been concerned about him and takes extra care of Master Zhou's family dependents—not to mention his younger sister is Zhou Juli."

"Does he frequently follow Zhou Lezhi now?" Xu Ke threw out this most critical question.

"Yes." Liu Sha gave an affirmative answer without hesitation.

In this way, tracking Xu Yong had a high probability of finding this mysterious Zhou Lezhi. Thinking of this, Xu Ke's nerves immediately became excited.

Once catching this mysterious person of unknown origin, various strange things of the Shi Weng group would be readily solved.

Now, Xu Ke had no interest in the Shi Weng group anymore; their destructive energy could not shake the rule of the Senate. Whether they survived or not didn't matter much. But the person Zhou Lezhi greatly stimulated the interest of him and the Intelligence Bureau.

"Notify the Min Zhanlian team, ask them to focus on staring at and controlling this Xu Yong! Do not arrest him. Find all the related persons around him!"

Xu Yong was biting a stalk of straw in his mouth, turning it slowly. Looking at the Liu Qi'er couple who were hung on the roof beam and beaten to the verge of death.

Here was the backyard of the Zhou residence. Since the search yielded no clues starting yesterday, interrogation of the servants and maids in the residence began here. From the gatekeeper to the rough-work maids, every one went through the court (interrogation). Family law and severe torture were applied. A group of men and women cried to heaven and knocked on earth (wailed loudly), flipping all the matters in the residence bottom up.

As the managers of the Zhou residence, the Liu Qi'er couple naturally suffered the most. Stripped naked and hung on the roof beam, they were beaten bitterly all night. Although it was for interrogation, there was also Xu Yong's intention to vent his anger.

He had advised earnestly, not hesitating to risk being tracked to come here multiple times to warn about "strict doors." Unexpectedly, this Liu Qi'er was so bold as to dare to continue seducing Granny Shi to come to the door.

The most infuriating thing was that after discovering You Rong's disappearance, she didn't go to the Wang family to report on the same day, but searched privately. Only until the next morning...

Now You Rong had disappeared, and going to trace Granny Shi, she was also nowhere to be seen—this old thing probably knew things were not good and hid ahead of time.

However, finally, some strange things were known from the maids and servants who accompanied her out. Her whereabouts were roughly known.

"...Besides offering incense and going to Master Qian's residence, has she been to any other places?!"

"No... no... more..." Liu Qi'er looked withered, "Miss, went to, places... lowly one, ...all all said..."

Interrogating all night, things that could be known were all known. There must be useful news from the concubine of Master Qian's family, but he couldn't break into someone else's residence to arrest Master Qian's concubine for interrogation.

Of course, if he really wanted to do this, it wasn't impossible, but he had to use connections inside the Jinyiwei (Embroidered Uniform Guard), and the matter would get bigger and bigger. Although Xu Yong was young, he dared not be so reckless.

"It would be good if Master was still here!" Xu Yong thought to himself. His heart was quite uneasy.

Master's *Jianghu* experience was far superior to his. If he were here, there would be a backbone. Right now he could only rely on himself.

He didn't report the matter of searching for You Rong to Mr. Le, because he knew very well how Mr. Le would handle it: Not ask (ignore it).

But Xu Yong couldn't let go of this matter, because taking care of the Zhou residence was entrusted to him by Mr. Le and Master Wang back then—although it was only "assisting Wang Liang," now that Wang Liang's whereabouts were unknown, he had to shoulder this responsibility without turning back.

For him, You Rong was not simply "Mr. Zhou's woman." Whether she could be found concerned his face (standing) in the Shi Weng group.

Even if Master Wang and Mr. Le didn't blame him, he couldn't pass the hurdle in his own heart.

"Little Brother Xu! What to do next?" Although he was just a teenager, his subordinates also had to respectfully address him as "Little Brother."

"You go to the streets and alleys around Master Qian's residence to inquire. In this month, have there been suspicious sedan chairs or mule carts staying for a short time to wait for people? If there were, roughly where did they go? Especially those parked near the back door and side door of the Qian residence."

"Yes!"

What to do next? He had no clue for a moment. He had done what he should do, but whether it was those sent out to search or those intercepting at various city gates, there was not a bit of news so far.

Speaking of which, it was still this pair of dog man and woman who delayed matters! Concealing without reporting, wasting a day's effort in vain. These few days he ran between the Wang family, Zhou residence, and all suspicious locations several times, yet had no clue at all! Had to use torture to extract useful news...

Things having reached this step, it was better to report to Mr. Le. with his intelligence, maybe he could come up with some ideas. After all, tracking You Rong's traces had already started, the raw rice was cooked into cooked rice (what's done is done). Presumably, he wouldn't oppose it either.
