# Chapter 2649: The Capital (Part 5)

"No need to arrest him. Send people to watch him. See where he goes, whom he meets, and what he says. Report back when you have definite information."

"Yes, your humble official will send people immediately!" Wu Mengming felt that "Heaven's will is unpredictable"; he really couldn't figure out why this petty official from Fujian had aroused the Emperor's interest, actually enjoying the treatment reserved for ministers and governors.

"And Wang Yehao..."

"Your humble official has arrangements around him."

Chongzhen nodded. "Let the detectives secretly investigate what relationship exists between him and that Zhou Lezhi."

"Yes!" Wu Mengming waited for a moment. Seeing the Emperor had no new instructions, he took a few steps back, preparing to leave, but was stopped by the Emperor again.

"Delong Bank—how is its business nowadays?"

Wu Mengming was startled. This Delong Bank was not considered a large bank or famous brand in the capital; its fame was much smaller than the "Shanxi Houses" of the old Shanxi financiers. However, it was known to everyone in the capital that this bank had connections with the Hair Rebels. Because from the very beginning, Delong's main business was silver remittance with Guangdong.

It was a long journey of thousands of *li* from the capital to Liangguang. For some people with shallow knowledge, "Guangdong" meant about the same as "barbarian territory." However, there were quite a few merchants and officials of Guangdong origin in the capital, and the flow of silver was quite frequent.

In the past, due to the high mountains and long roads, and the inconvenience of transportation, whether from the capital to Guangdong or from Guangdong to the capital, the remittance premium was very high. Remitting one tael of silver to Guangzhou cost five or six times, or even more than ten times, the premium for Jiangnan. The remittance time was also very long, causing inconvenience to the gentry and merchants of Guangdong.

After Delong opened in the capital, remittances in the Liangguang direction almost immediately opened up a new situation. Their remittances not only had no limit on the amount and charged low fees, but what made the traditional industry most unable to catch up was their remittance speed. For remittances between Guangzhou and the capital, the fastest "wire transfer" took only three days to arrive. This speed, let alone no one in the past could achieve it, even the court's eight-hundred-*li* urgent garrison reports could not match it. Even more rare was that they also had a "mail transfer" with lower fees, which could arrive in ten days.

Such speed completely overturned people's cognition. From Guangzhou to the capital, even if a courier officer traveled by starlight night and day for urgent official business, it would take at least nine days. The transaction of money was also clear and unambiguous. Before long, they completely monopolized the silver remittance between the capital and Guangzhou. Not only did the gentry and merchants of Liangguang praise it greatly, but it also attracted many northern merchants to use it as a funding channel to go south to Guangdong for business. Those great rats who had already sniffed out that the ship was leaking also used Delong to send the silver they had embezzled and exploited continuously to the south, using it to build new nests of comfort.

This kind of north-south remittance later expanded to between the two capitals (Beijing and Nanjing), and soon remittance became Delong's largest business. This north-south remittance continued even after the fall of Liangguang, only out of the routine of "throwing a handful of dust to blind people's eyes," they stopped the wire transfers. However, the "mail transfer" between Liangguang and the capital remained open, with the time extended to one month, naturally citing the war as the reason.

Everyone knew in their hearts whether Manager Leng of Delong was "colluding with the Hairs," but they all kept a tacit understanding. After all, who would want to block this channel? Not to mention that Manager Leng was also a figure known for having "hard backers" in the capital's business world—not only officials from Liangguang but also great eunuchs from the palace. So although Guangzhou had fallen for almost two years, and there were quite a few people who accused Delong of "colluding with the Hairs" seeking wealth and status during this period, they all died regarding "unclear causes." Wu Mengming naturally didn't want to wade into this muddy water.

Now that the Emperor suddenly asked about this, many thoughts flashed through Wu Mengming's mind quickly. Could it be that someone had said something directly to the Emperor? And...

The matter was of great importance, so he dared not answer lightly. He just followed the Emperor's question and replied, "This humble official does not know about this. It is originally a bank; whether business is good or bad cannot be seen from the outside. Wait for your humble official to go back and investigate carefully."

Chongzhen stared dead at Wu Mengming for a long while, watching him until his back broke out in cold sweat. Only after a long time did he lower his voice and say in a voice that only the two of them could barely hear clearly: "This matter must be kept secret! We have heard that someone among the inner officials has a connection with this bank. You go investigate and report back—you do not need to inform the Eastern Depot about this matter. Handle it secretly."

Hearing this, Wu Mengming's legs were already trembling. He felt as if he had suddenly stood on the edge of a cliff. If his response was wrong, being dismissed and punished would be light; he might not even keep his little life.

Wu Mengming didn't know how he came out or how he returned to his yamen. Back in his signing room, other errand were easy to handle, but this investigation of the bank was too thorny.

Wu Mengming knew a thing or two about Delong Bank: This Manager Leng came from Guangdong and was originally a "fledgling" in the capital. Somehow, he found a way to curry favor with Eunuch Yang, the Director of the Bell and Drum Bureau in the palace, and thus gained a foothold in the capital. Also because of Eunuch Yang's relationship, many great eunuchs in the palace deposited silver in this bank.

Investigating Delong or Leng Ningyun was not difficult, but the Emperor's sentence "no need to inform the Eastern Depot" before he left was the most terrifying part.

The Eastern Depot was the Emperor's "domestic slave." As the Emperor's most trusted Director of Ceremonial and Admiral of the Eastern Depot, Superintendent Cao Huachun participated in the most imperial secrets. Although Wu Mengming was also a close minister relied upon by the Emperor, he still had to look at Cao's expression. At this moment, the Emperor wanted him to "handle it secretly," obviously having conceived thoughts of distrust towards Cao Huachun.

If he protected the eunuchs in his reply, the Emperor would inevitably suspect him of colluding with the eunuchs; if he reported truthfully, Eunuch Yang was the Director of the Bell and Drum Bureau. Although his rank was not as esteemed as the eunuchs of the Directorate of Ceremonial or the Directorate of Imperial Horses, he was still one of the managing great eunuchs of the Twenty-Four Yamen, and an apprentice of Gao Shiming—connections in the palace were intertwined. Once he was investigated because of this, Wu Mengming would have offended the eunuchs in the palace to death!

He knew that Eunuch Yang had been fawning over Wang Dehua in recent years. If he offended Wang Dehua because of this, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Wu Mengming's back was sweating, and he paced in the signing room for a long time. He felt he should discuss this matter with Cao Huachun, regardless of Cao's attitude, at least to give him a heads-up. But the Emperor had specifically reminded him today—if the Emperor found out...

He suddenly thought that the Emperor only instructed him not to inform the Eastern Depot, so as long as he didn't explicitly mention this matter to Cao Huachun, it would be fine. Wait Yang had a relationship with the bank, so he naturally had to avoid it. But Wang Dehua was not an obstruction.

Eunuch Yang had always attached himself to Wang Dehua; presumably, he had also shared a portion of Delong's benefits with him. As long as he revealed some news to him slightly, he would naturally understand. As for how to handle it specifically, Eunuch Yang would naturally send someone to lend with him.

Thinking of this, he had a rough idea. He immediately called a few capable subordinates and whispered instructions to them.

The winter night in the capital was chilling to the bone. Except for a very few people who had to run about for a living and the patrol officers and watchmen on routine duty, ordinary people who still had a place to shelter had long hidden back in their homes. The streets were empty and desolate.

In this cold and bleak marketplace, at the west intersection of Huguosi in the capital, there was a courtyard that was brightly lit. This place was the famous Liuquan Ju Restaurant in the capital. This restaurant had opened during the Longqing reign of the Great Ming; even in the Chongzhen reign, it was a century-old shop.

The frontage of the restaurant was not large, just three rooms wide by the street. Compared to other large restaurants, it appeared much more common. However, inside was a different world. Its backyard was broad and open, having a touch of pastoral charm within the city. There was a large willow tree over a hundred years old in the courtyard, and under the tree was a clear spring with clear and sweet water. The shopkeeper used this clear spring water to brew yellow wine, which had a mellow taste and overflowing fragrance, called "Jade Spring Fine Wine" by diners.

Besides the "Willow Tree," "Spring Water," and "Yellow Wine," Liuquan Ju was most famous for its plaque being inscribed by Yan Song. Therefore, it was quite famous in the capital. High officials and nobles came here endlessly for banquets, gathering here day and night to exchange cups and drink happily.

At this moment, inside a private room in the wing of the backyard, a "Dispelling Cold" banquet was in progress.

This was not a formal official banquet, but a casual drink between colleagues and friends. The guests were mostly officials and private secretaries from the Shuntian Prefecture Yamen in the capital, totaling fifteen or sixteen people.

The table was laid with various appetizers to go with the wine: pickled fish, preserved eggs, drunken crabs, dried meat, vegetables, dried and fresh fruits... everything was available, totaling over twenty kinds. Various good wines were also prepared.

The fire walls in the private room were all heated up. Outside, the cold wind was biting, but inside the room, it was warm as spring. The group of guests exchanged toasts and composed poems, enjoying themselves thoroughly.

The middle-aged scholar sitting at the head seat was none other than the Shuntian Prefecture Yin, Zhong Kai. Zhong Kai was upright in his officialdom, known for managing subordinates strictly and treating the people with leniency. The Emperor also praised him as a "choice of clean self and devotion to public duty."

Although he had a reputation for uprightness and integrity, being in officialdom, one could not be blindly harsh and stubborn. Social engagements were also indispensable "work." Today's Dispelling Cold Banquet was initiated by him to reward and comfort his subordinate officials and private secretaries.

Just as the group was in high spirits, Zhong Kai's personal attendant suddenly walked in and whispered a few words in his ear. The colleagues at the table saw his brows furrow slightly, so they all stopped talking and looked at him.

Zhong Kai signaled the long-time attendant to withdraw and motioned for the private secretary in charge of criminal justice to come forward. He whispered a few instructions to him, "...You arrange people to investigate tomorrow. Report to me immediately once there is news."

"Yes, this student will go arrange it right away." After speaking, the advisor took his leave and left the table.

After the advisor left the door, seeing everyone looking at him, Zhong Kai said, "Everyone here is from the Shuntian Prefecture Yamen. This student won't play dumb with you all. A case just occurred; I'm afraid we'll be busy tomorrow."

Everyone looked at each other in dismay. A case that could alarm the Shuntian Prefecture Yin to ask personally must be a major and serious case. They all held their breath, waiting for his following words.
