# Chapter 2630: Gold Pig

This issue of *War History Research* was also a black material series produced by the Ministry of Truth. This black material didn't need special creation and elaboration. Just putting a few self-contradictory places of Liaodong management strategies together, then looking with God's perspective, basically one would know Great Ming's Liaodong war situation had no future to speak of at all. Let alone "Recovering Liao," it was purely a rotten sore bloodletting Great Ming.

Gou Xunli finished speaking. Li Guangyuan let out a long breath, feeling he listened so strictly (nervously) just now. For big households in Guangdong countryside like them, although hearing about Liaodong war matters, it was close to "legend." No one thought this matter had any relation to themselves. But these articles both focused on battlefield situation and interpreted from strategic level, also including geopolitical theories of later generations. Breadth and depth of analysis far exceeded so-called "Military Affairs" of old-time bureaucrats.

Besides nervousness, he was also slightly surprised. Because speaking about Kun thief bandits originally, why dragged onto Eastern Barbarians? This was truly one sky south, one sea north, eight poles couldn't hit together.

Monk specially talking about this matter, obviously had some important matter to say. immediately dismissed attendants, asked: "This Liaodong war situation is dangerous! But what relation does this have with Guangnan?"

Gou Xunli nodded and said: "Master indeed sees clearly across thousand *li*!" Then lowered voice saying: "Master presumably also can see: Liaodong war situation already became trend of complete defeat." Saying he looked at Luo Heying; the other party also nodded slightly.

For an unlearned person like Gou Xunli, that bit of knowledge about Liaodong war situation was all known successively after testing into Old Master Shi's service. But learning now and selling now didn't affect effect. Seeing Master Li indeed took it to heart, appetite also hung up, he knew timing arrived. Immediately pressed voice lower, threw out the long-prepared "Ten Thousand Men Enemy":

"The Court intends to negotiate peace with Eastern Barbarians, abandoning all land outside the Pass. Guan-Ning Iron Cavalry withdraws to Shanhaiguan. Going south to exterminate roving bandits and expel Kun thief bandits before long."

"What?" Li Guangyuan was greatly shocked. He heard reputation of Guan-Ning Iron Cavalry more or less too.

"Master you think, this Guan-Ning Iron Cavalry is elite soldiers raised by the Court spending millions of Provisions and Salary annually. Withdrawing inside the Pass, relying on danger of Mountain and Sea, solidity of strong cities, definitely don't need so many elite soldiers and strong generals. Could it remain to consume provisions and salary in vain? Situation inside the Pass, roving bandits run rampant, Kun thief bandits rampant, all are heart and belly troubles of the Court. Within one or two years, must have big army going south to exterminate painfully."

Li Guangyuan listened, nodded unknowingly. Luo Heying saw Monk Haixiang's "Ten Thousand Men Enemy" explosion already took effect, knew fire duration arrived, immediately came up to fan wind: "This is just rumor. In humble opinion, Court negotiating peace openly is unlikely—after all weight of this Distinction between Hua and Yi is too big. Fear current Emperor dare not make this decision either. However, private negotiation is highly possible."

Li Guangyuan hurriedly asked: "How private negotiation?"

"Naturally dispatching secret envoy to talk secretly. Afterwards probably abandon defense of all passes and cities outside the Pass. Soldiers and common people all withdraw inside the Pass. These generals and soldiers withdraw inside the Pass, relying on Great Wall defense, Eastern Barbarians definitely cannot go south to plunder again. Further, empty land outside the Pass will also attract Mongol tribes. By then Eastern Barbarians and Mongol tribes fight a round again, then won't have strength to go south. This is also currently most usable strategy."

Monk Haixiang said: "From Court's view, this is probably the only optional method too. These hundreds of thousands of soldiers gathered in Liaodong, winning no battle, yet consuming huge amount of provisions and salary. Inside the Pass smoke and fire rise everywhere again; even Imperial Mausoleum in Middle Capital was burned. Might as well withdraw all inside the Pass to use."

"Saying so, the Court is about to use troops south?1"

"Just between morning and evening." Monk Haixiang said very certainly, "If not so, why we take this risk, linking up everywhere? Tell you truthfully, various counties under Guangzhou Prefecture all have Righteous Gentlemen, feeding horses and sharpening weapons, just waiting for Court big army arriving at Five Ridges, then rise in swarms to respond..."

Since ancient times official rank moved people's hearts most. Li Guangyuan was richest in a region in Dongguan, counting as a local tyrant. Helpless no Provincial Graduate, Metropolitan Graduate in clan. Going out always felt a head shorter than people. Especially every time going out, passing other villages, always extremely lost whenever seeing flagpoles.

This was just nominal fame. Regarding real benefit of official rank, truly too many too many. Just from marriage, a matching door benefit couldn't be finished saying. Thinking of arrogance of several imperial examination big clans in county, himself could only look up to their breath, daring not act rashly.

Thinking here, like possessed by ghost, wished Court rushed south immediately, own family good to "Raise troops to respond." Even had some feeling of "Time waits for no one": "Don't know when Court Heavenly Army will go south to wash away group of ugliness?"

Sun already slanted west. Rice on both sides of dirt road bent waist lowered head incomparably humble bearing heavy rice ears. Frogs in distant pond argued ceaselessly about something. Birds stealing food in rice field were suddenly startled into mid-air by solid footsteps, flying hurriedly to a tree, standing in row, looking at the owner of sound walking along dirt road with terror.

Saw this person, cheeks thin, unshaven beard, a short outfit piled with patches, newly worn holes on shoulder and back. Wearing no shoes either, bareing a pair of pitch-black big feet, walking forcefully on dirt road. Carrying a bundle on back, slinging a bulging pouch (*Da Lian*) on one shoulder, carrying large half straw bag of grain on the other. Waist hanging a string of loaches strung with willow branch.

Comer named Li Xiujie—of course this name only existed on clan register. Usually everyone mostly called him "Jin Zhu" (Gold Pig). Early thirties this year. Home just in front Li Family Enclosure. Although surnamed Li, had half cent relationship with local Li family. His ancestor fled famine to here from outside, settling down as Long-term Worker for people here. Until Jin Zhu's father was born. Once Li Guangyuan's grandfather celebrated birthday, sought door to beg Old Master, only then united clan and entered ancestral hall with Li family.

Entering ancestral hall, Li family's family financial situation improved much. Ancestral hall took care of various branches more or less. Seeing his family had no land, rented more than ten *mu* of clan field in clan to Jin Zhu's grandfather to farm, also allocated three straw rooms. Only then counted as having house and fields, settling down henceforth.

Jin Zhu's generation, because many brothers at home, after old father died, brothers divided family. He didn't get even half piece of thin field, only getting ancestral house—three straw rooms. For these three straw rooms also threw in supporting old mother. Could only walk grandfather's old road again, living as Long-term Worker for others.

Originally with Jin Zhu's family financial situation, marrying wife was basically delusion. Li Guangyuan's mother walked inner residence manager lady's road, went to plead again. Li Guangyuan looking at three generations of his family selling strength sentiment, rewarded a rough work slave girl of family to him as wife. This wife was originally fled famine from north, sold self to Li family as slave to survive.

With family inconvenient to be Long-term Worker again. Besides there was an old mother to care for at home. Jin Zhu changed to making living by doing odd jobs. He worked outside. Wife cared for old mother with cough disease at home, also planted a few depressions of vegetable land front and back of house. Additionally took some washing sewing mending weaving work from big households in manor to subsidize family use. Jin Zhu ran to Xiaoyao Market to carry work for people.

Xiaoyao Market was a ferry crossing on river more than ten *li* away. Merchants coming and going Dongguan and Guangzhou mostly passed here. Market also had various forest of businesses. Doing some odd jobs was not worrying. Plus during New Year and festivals clan public granary always had some rice distribution. Some years actually much better than several brothers renting fields. Just since Kun Thief Bandits occupied Guangzhou, boats sailing on river became fewer. Merchants on market also mostly apprehensive, daring not do much business. Collaterally Jin Zhu's income from odd jobs was also a few points less than previous years. Jin Zhu estimated, rice ripening soon, great busy in fields soon. Demand for short-term workers surged. Better go home to look, discuss well with family again after finishing rice harvest.

Arriving at home door when sky just turned black. Home still that crooked look as original. Yellow mud courtyard wall mostly collapsed, patched carefully with bamboo fence. Just on house lintel newly inserted a red lantern. Jin Zhu sized up a few eyes then strode into central room.

Wife was not at home. Mother Li in inner room heard footsteps, leaning on bamboo bed obliquely, after a burst of coughing, shouted loudly: "Who? Who?"

"Mother, it's me. I'm back." Jin Zhu took off bundle and pouch, sleeping straw bag pouring rice into rice vat.

Mother Li already draped clothes and put on shoes, coming to central room. "Jin Zhu ah, cough, cough, Jin Zhu back." Saying taking straw bag pouring empty rice from Li Xiujie's hand, examining son carefully, finding son didn't wear shoes, couldn't help asking: "Why didn't you wear shoes? Where are your shoes?"

Common people at that time mostly didn't wear shoes. Rural common people regarded bare feet as common thing. But Jin Zhu did loading and unloading carrying work. Running on wharf couldn't do without wearing a pair of straw shoes. Otherwise extremely easy to be cut skin and flesh by various broken slags on wharf. And this straw shoes were not made by self, having specialized straw shoe artisan making.

"One pair worn rotten. Another pair fell into river when unloading. Buy again tomorrow going to work." Jin Zhu seemed not caring much about his shoes, just taking off a string of loaches from waist, handing to mother, "Mother, this is loach I caught on road. Heard eating this has benefit for your cough disease. Where is Lian Niang? Sky all dark don't know coming back to cook. Running randomly what?"

Qiao Lian was his wife's maiden name. Because two had no children, called Lian Niang.

Mother Li took loach, covering mouth coughing a few times again, defending for Lian Niang: "Lian Niang went following Fairy Huang to cultivate magic and beg medicine. Estimating coming back soon."

"Cultivate magic, cultivate her rubbish magic!" Because wage got recently was not as good as usual, Jin Zhu held a stream of evil fire in heart all along. Couldn't help cursing: "Young woman not peaceful at home, wild horse wandering. If abducted and sold like Old Tian family wife, she feels good right. I was not at home for just a few days, this woman skin itches again. Watch me whip her a meal! Where is that Fairy Huang wild fox fairy, seducing good family people. Don't know where she is a flower-patting woman (kidnapper)."
