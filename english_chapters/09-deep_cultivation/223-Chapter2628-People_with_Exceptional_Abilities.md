# Chapter 2628: People with Exceptional Abilities

After speaking, he led the group into the manor gate. Li Family Enclosure, as the name implied, was originally polder land formed by enclosing soil dikes in water area river channels and pumping out water. Thus here was surrounded by water on three sides, only one long dike connecting to land. This wharf was at the end of the long dike. Inside was the South Gate of Li Family Enclosure.

Because surrounded by water on four sides, easy to defend hard to attack, so no walls or ramparts were built locally, only surrounded by soil dikes. Densely packed bamboo fences were erected on soil dikes, and watchtowers were built. Guard was quite strict.

Entering the enclosure gate, it was a stone slab road. Slightly some merchants on both sides, the rest were all local villagers. Walking less than half a *li*, facing was a brick-built gate tower—here was Li Guangyuan's manor.

A large flattened sunning ground was in front of the manor gate. At this time it was noon. Many long-term workers and manor households resting were gathering under a big banyan tree cheering frequently. Li Guangyuan said to Luo Heying: "These are the few good fellows who came with your name card a few days ago. I have hired them as instructors. Just waiting for rice to ripen to train village braves greatly."

"Go look first." Luo Heying seemed full of interest, saying and striding towards the crowd.

Under the big banyan tree was an incense table, worshiping a tablet written with "Haotian Golden Palace Supreme Jade Emperor God." Several incense candles inserted in the incense burner were drifting dimly. Before the table stood two men in brown short outfits, waist tied with black belts, heads covered with yellow silk kerchiefs. On the other side was a woman in red tight clothes, head covered with red kerchief. In the center of the crowd was another man with head covered by yellow kerchief, stripping to the waist, performing Iron Spear Locking Throat. Saw this person muscles bulging all over, hands protecting Dantian, face held blood red. Shining spear tip pressed against throat; red tassel under spear tip trembling *tu tu* randomly. Spear shaft bent into an exaggerated arc. Spear tail poked into the ground already grinding a small pit. Onlookers all opened eyes wide, sucking in cool air. Some terrified, some excited, some enthusiastic... various expressions, not one alike.

Not long after, the man withdrew his posture. Everyone then breathed out a breath; following closely shouting "Good" ceaselessly on the whole field. Then that man did another set of "Sword Cut Not Entering," letting the woman hold a big sword to chop violently on his bare belly, but only leaving red marks one by one; even skin was not broken half a bit. Everyone shouted "Good" again for a while.

After this performance, that man rested a breath, first holding fists to bow to everyone. Just about to speak, heard loudly from the crowd: "I have a Kun person's fast gun here. Want to try strong man's invulnerability to swords and guns. Strong man dare?"

Hearing this, the man was startled first, face skin twitching slightly. Looking fixedly, turned out he also recognized, mood settled greatly, smiling said, "Why not? How can Kun demon's carving insect small trick rival my Haotian Great Emperor's grand path?" Saying looking at the red-clothed woman, "Just bother Fairy Aunt to cast spell again, bestowing me talisman water."

Red-clothed woman smiled slightly, not answering either, just putting the round fan in hand on the table. Immediately flipping hands, right hand index and middle fingers clamped a talisman. Hand pinched a seal, mouth chanting spell: "Enter my door, respect my god, Lishan Old Mother transforms into Dao Truth. Not teaching Universe Great Shift, teaching Golden Bell protecting your body. Defending Dao conquering demons requires straight courage, returning to mountain after removing all demons and monsters..." Spells behind couldn't be heard clearly. Only seeing this Red-clothed Fairy Aunt dancing with hands and feet looking very beautiful. Hands crossing, talisman text clamped between fingers ignited spontaneously with a boom. This Fairy Aunt was not panicked or busy either, waiting until talisman text about to burn out before throwing into a wine bowl on the table.

Here chanting spell and casting magic, there the person wanting to test invulnerability to swords and guns also strode into the circle. It was exactly Luo Heying's clan younger brother—Luo Hetu. This person had a dark round face, a pair of sword eyebrows raised obliquely, a pair of red phoenix eyes slightly closed, revealing a posture of despising group heroes. Powerful shoulders and back seemed ready to break out from the loose straight gown anytime. Feet wearing a pair of brown hemp shoes, walking raising dust and bringing soil, sonorous and forceful, as if every step wanted to smash a pit on the ground. Viewers praised: "What a strong man!"

Luo Hetu walked in the circle, first glanced at that man, then squinted around the onlookers manor households, then tied the lower hem of straight gown at waist, revealing a small box at waist. Then took off the diagonally slung bundle from back. After opening, everyone then saw inside turned out to be an Australian Bird Gun, a small leather casket. Luo Hetu first slung that small leather casket diagonally on body, then picked up that Bird Gun.

Everyone couldn't care about watching Fairy Aunt casting spell anymore,纷纷 (one after another) fixing gazes on that Bird Gun.

This Australian Bird Gun had long fame outside. All knew thief bandit firearms were extremely sharp. But everyone only heard, never seen the real guy.

"This is Kun thief's fast gun..."

"Looks more exquisite than Dwarf (Japanese) Bird Gun; just don't know if it works."

"Fart, not working could beat General He into big defeat, could capture Commander Xiong's Zhaoqing within a few days?"

"Heard thief bandits use all continuous bead fast guns. Don't know how this bird gun connects beads?"

"Talking those rubbish nonsense, isn't it enough to watch well?"

...

Everyone surrounded the Bird Gun, discussing widely.

Li Guangyuan's eyebrows raised with joy. Looking at the Kun person fast gun in Luo Hetu's hand in the circle, then looking at Luo Heying beside with self-possessed expression. Didn't expect Luo Heying invited by himself had such ability, actually could get Kun person's fast gun. With fast gun, dealing with Kun thieves was more certain.

Monk Haixiang—Gou Xunli didn't know Luo Heying actually had Kun person's fast gun either. He had seen Kun person's rifle. This gun at first glance was indeed similar to Kun person's rifle generally, but always had some difference he couldn't describe. Immediately didn't think much, only watching Luo Hetu's movements attentively.

Luo Hetu supported ground with gun stock, holding gun barrel with left hand, right hand pulling out a two-finger thick long strip paper pack from leather casket, handing to left hand. Right hand reverse twisted a few times at the tail end of paper pack, twisting open paper pack, then poured gunpowder inside into gun barrel. At the end of paper pack was a thumb-sized lead bullet, one end round one end flat, just stuck on gun barrel. Luo Hetu pulled out a thin strip made of refined steel from under gun barrel. One end of this steel strip had burrs, one end had a flat holder. Luo Hetu used this holder to push that bullet into gun barrel, then rammed solid forcefully a few times, then inserted fine steel strip back under gun barrel. Only then held gun obliquely, broke open fire door (*Huo Men* - nipple/pan), took out a small copper cap from small box at waist, placed on fire door, then held flat, gun stock against shoulder, shouting loudly, "All dodge away, let you know Kun person fast gun's ferocity!" Saying moving gun barrel aiming at another banyan tree twenty steps away.

Onlookers surrounding under gun barrel dodged one after another. Someone squatting for a long time was started and actually couldn't stand up, instead sat butt on ground, but didn't dare to stop much, a roll over, crawling away using hands and feet together. Only heard a muffled sound of "Bang," white smoke sprayed out from gun barrel. That lead bullet was shot out. That person crawling heard this sound, limbs went loose, lying on ground motionless. Immediately people nearby smelled a stink of urine.

Some busybodies hurriedly looked at that person first, finding no major obstruction, ran under that banyan tree again, examined carefully, gestured a few times with short knife carried along, turning head shouting: "Direct hit! Direct hit! This bullet can't be taken down for a while."

Hearing this, everyone was in an uproar again, discussing widely. Some said having seen government soldier or Japanese bird guns, all needing to clip a match rope on top to ignite. This Kun person fast gun didn't use it; wouldn't it fear wind and rain? Some said having seen bird gun bullets hitting trees could be picked down lightly. This fast gun hitting tree, bullet couldn't be taken out; truly evil and domineering.

Luo Hetu stood head high amidst everyone's discussion, looking sideways at that bare-chested man. The man was also unmoved by eight winds, just turning to receive that bowl of wine soaked with charm ash brought by Red-clothed woman, gulping down more than half, then poured remaining wine over head. After returning wine bowl, mouth containing small half mouthful of wine, said a sound: "Come." Then with a *pu* sound spat this mouthful of wine all over palm, opened palm like cattail leaf fan patting on chest *pa pa pa* mountain-loud. Assumed a Thousand Jin Drop posture, motionless.

Luo Hetu saw that man assume posture well, walked a few steps, about ten steps distance from that man. Only then supported ground with gun stock again, pulled out that steel strip again. This time probing into gun barrel with the burred end first, pulling back and forth a few times, then took out paper pack loading bullet as per previous method. When wanting to push in bullet, Luo Hetu instead pinched bullet with two fingers, raising high over head, shouting loudly, "Everyone watch well. Kun person's tiny bullet is most vicious. Hitting into human body rots flesh and erodes bone, no medicine to cure."

Everyone exclaimed again. Luo Hetu then pressed bullet into gun barrel with thumb, compacted with steel strip, installed copper cap, gun stock against shoulder. This time having experience, onlookers dodged away early. Luo Hetu shouted loudly: "Coming!" Before finishing words, pulled trigger.

Everyone watched motionless long ago. Some timid children even hid behind adults, exposing half a head not daring to breathe loudly watching. Some even hugged adults' legs tightly, closing eyes tight.

Following another muffled sound of "Bang," immediately followed by everyone's exclamations of "Ya!" "Ah!" Look at that man again, still assuming Thousand Jin Drop posture, not moving a bit, corner of mouth still hanging a smile. After a while again, saw that man open mouth, that bullet was being bitten between two teeth by the man. Man spat out bullet, raising high over head with hand. Everyone was nervous enough unable to even emit sound of shouting "Good."

Suddenly heard Master Li shouting by ear: "Good—Good! Good divine skill, Instructor Chen good divine skill, Fairy Huang good magic! Come, send two more loads of wine to Instructors." Everyone then recovered spirit, cheering together immediately.

That Luo Hetu was not annoyed either, just collected gun, bowed to Instructor Chen, then stood back behind Luo Heying silently. Luo Heying also only nodded to Luo Hetu, then looked at Instructor Chen and others smilingly.
