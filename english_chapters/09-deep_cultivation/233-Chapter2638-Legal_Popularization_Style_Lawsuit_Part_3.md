# Chapter 2638: Legal Popularization Style Lawsuit (Part 3)

Liang Xinhu thought in heart after all was a scholar, truly "Exporting Mouth Becoming Chapter" (eloquent). However twelve characters said benefits inside clearly and plainly. Immediately said: "Mister said right. Since ancient times King's Law ruthless. One text one character, all concern folks' body family life. Therefore besides this Interrogation Decision Division, this Dynasty ancestors still had system of 'Overturning Difference Separate Survey' (*Fan Yi Bie Kan*)."

Zhang Jiayu's interest was lifted up at this time: "Please Chief bestow teaching!"

Liang Xinhu said Overturning Difference Separate Survey was a judicial system implemented in Song Dynasty. Overturning Difference (*Fan Yi*), i.e. overturning confession; Separate Survey (*Bie Kan*), i.e. separate trial. Song Dynasty criminal case defendants at juncture of recording interrogation, announcing judgment and facing execution, all could cry wrong overturn difference. Once overturning difference, case automatically entered Appeal Procedure of Separate Survey.

From essence speaking, "Overturning Difference Separate Survey" actually was an automatic appeal judicial mechanism. Every time criminal defendant overturned difference, must arrange another judge to try again. Paying huge judicial resources for this, and had to endure slow judicial efficiency.

"...Of course there will be some prisoners utilizing mechanism of 'Overturning Difference Separate Survey,' serving detention again and again, overturning difference again and again, so retrying again and again, endless. To avoid appearance of this situation wasting judicial resources, a balance must be reached between judicial justice and judicial efficiency..."

Method Song people thought of was, giving limit to number of times of making "Overturning Difference Separate Survey." Northern Song implemented "Limit of Three Recommendations" (*San Tui Zhi Xian*), i.e. defendant had three chances of "Overturning Difference Separate Survey." After Separate Survey three times, if prisoner cried wrong again, would no longer accept. Southern Song time changed to "Five Recommendation System" (*Wu Tui Zhi*), i.e. defendant could "Overturn Difference Separate Survey" five times.

Pity after Yuan Dynasty, this system annihilated completely. Ming Qing eras, although also had situations like overturning confession on spot, leapfrog complaining etc., but either having harsh restrictive conditions (Leapfrog Suit), or retrial decision power in hands of chief trial official. Crying wrong overturning confession became a matter with extremely big risk yet not necessarily having profit. If not suffering extremely big unrighted wrong, otherwise very few people dared to try.

Zhang Jiayu listened interest brimming. Criminal Name as official's practice, scholars more or less would involve. But generally speaking not valued. Don't look at Zhu Yuanzhang "Legal Consciousness" very strong, specially formulating *Grand Pronouncements* (*Da Gao*) promulgating under heaven, not only listed as Imperial College textbook and Imperial Examination content, for letting every family read, also stipulated family having this book could reduce crime one grade. But person died politics extinguished. Merely one hundred years effort, to Jiajing Reign this book already few people knew, needing Ministry of Rites to re-promulgate under heaven. Besides this, on market extremely few books specializing in this category. Relevant yamen clerks regarded this knowledge as "Secret Not Transmitted." Therefore Zhang Jiayu towards this was dragonfly touching water (superficial), talking in general terms. Very rarely involving specific practice, let alone Legal Principle.

Liang Xinhu's class finished at lucnh time. After simple lunch, 1 PM afternoon, started first day trial work of Circuit Court. Zhang Jiayu also followed crowd to audit court trial at court.

"Circuit Court" stressed adapting to local conditions. Places having conditions naturally set in high room open pavilion like ancestral hall, temple, old government office. Places without conditions, setting court directly at open space like threshing ground, stage was also common matter.

Jiujiang here actually usable big houses were quite few. But Liang Xinhu to expand influence of Legal Popularization, tried to let more folks can watch trial, as long as condition permitted tried to choose outdoor venue with larger capacity.

Today's court trial was set on a threshing ground of Jiujiang. Middle piled up earth platform, serving as court. Surrounded by wooden fence. A squad of National Army soldiers already set up cordon along wooden fence, separating more and more folks outside wooden fence.

On empty ground, erected several wooden poles. Wired speakers already hung on top.

Zhang Jiayu at Witchcraft Case time also ran to audit to join fun. That case involved so many so wide, could be called "Southern Sky First Case." At that time people going to audit simply ten thousand people empty alley. Guangzhou Municipal Government had to employ large amount of National Army to go maintain order. Zhang Jiayu entrusted quite some relations also couldn't enter court to listen, only listened to interrogation process through "Wooden Box" outside.

Today's Circuit Trial was similarly People Mountain People Sea—for villagers without any entertainment activity, watching trial was entertainment activity. Fortunately this time Zhang Jiayu was "Visiting Minister" status, not only person inside wooden fence, also had a seat.

Following crowd filing into court sitting well in audit seats. Zhang Jiayu looking over saw parties of this trial already arrived fully. First glance this people waiting for trial truly not few, dark mass a big patch, divided into two teams. One side "Civil Cases," one side "Public Security Cases." Latter had police guarding.

According to system design of Law Society, Circuit Court generally didn't try major criminal cases. Mainly tried civil and public security cases.

Zeng Juan only saw Bailiffs on two sides looked at desk clock placed on table, shouted loudly: "Time arrived, please keep quiet! Stand up!"

This shout distributed with amplifier, originally noisy venue gradually became quiet.

Presiding Judge Liang Xinhu walked out from a tent beside Presiding Seat. Saw him wearing *Xiezhi* Crown on head, wearing black robe, wearing A-Grade Replica Black Leather Shoes from Landu Ship on feet. Truly majestic and awe-inspiring, a body of righteousness.

This *Xiezhi* Crown also called Law Crown, Iron Crown. According to record was made by Chu Wen King, worn by law enforcement officials, so called Law Crown. On top had decoration symbolizing *Xiezhi* horn. This *Xiezhi* was a divine beast in ancient legend. Legend said horn on its head nature loyal could distinguish crooked straight. So Law Society specially chose it as judge attire.

This crown was ancient system. Don't say common people mostly didn't know, even ordinary scholars mostly didn't know either. Also thought this was some "New Dynasty Attire." Zhang Jiayu read extensively, knowledge broad, naturally recognized. Just this outfit of Law Robe, truly made him unable to read counted as relic of which dynasty.

Liang Xinhu picked up gavel smashing forcefully: "Below open court! First Case!"

Bailiff immediately brought two parties to court. Routinely first asked name age home address etc. basic situation.

Turned out these two both made living in Jiujiang. Defendant Zhang Cai was shopkeeper of a small inn on Front Street. Inn not big, had seven or eight rooms, mostly rented to small merchants and artisans making living in Jiujiang.

Plaintiff, was his tenant Chen Sanli. Was a small merchant, making living selling fishing gear in Jiujiang. Looking from their business, all were small businesses water not flooding instep. Zhang Jiayu secretly surprised: Such small dealers, had what big matter to make trouble to disturb official government?

Finished asking basic situation, again by two sides stated cause of action and statement respectively. Zhang Jiayu only then understood fact of case: Chen Sanli once signed contract with Shopkeeper Zhang, long lease three years. Originally lived in peace. But after Australians came, four countrysides disturbed. Chen Sanli feared countryside not safe affecting small common people, rolled up bedding running overnight.

This run was large half year. Later situation stabilized gradually stabilized, Chen Sanli returned to Jiujiang to resume old profession again. Didn't expect, Shopkeeper Zhang seeing him run thought definitely died in chaotic army, already rented house out again. Only willing to return original rent.

Originally Chen Sanli also accepted. But current situation stable, business all good to do, rent of local houses in Jiujiang already rose quite a lot. With original money couldn't get such long lease anymore. Chen Sanli felt himself ate loss. Shopkeeper Zhang however felt he ran away himself, and remaining rent also returned to him, therefore confidently expressed impossible to fulfill according to old lease again.

Both felt self had reason, arguing not down. At once dragged till now. Originally dispute folks could resolve by self, after fermentation of few years already became emotional behavior of not fighting money fighting breath. Finally, Chen Sanli decided to sue Zhang Cai.

Court trial proceeded very slowly. Merchants on market not compared to rural farmers, because communicating with people more, speaking counted as fluent. But parties two sides one small merchant, one declined small shopkeeper, neither received systematic education. Logic inevitable upside down, same question had to ask several times to have answer.

"Defendant, you side think Plaintiff leaving Guangzhou, your side can take back house. Have basis?"

"Reply Lord, my street all are such rules." Zhang Cai said, "He just ran like this. One leave was almost ten months. News completely none. How I know if he is dead or alive..."

"Even if dead, I also paid money! You also have to keep for me three years!" Chen Sanli jumping like thunder.

"Silence, don't interrupt casually!" Law police beside warned.

Then Liang Xinhu asked Plaintiff Chen Sanli again. Latter expressed never heard of having this rule.

Subsequently Liang Xinhu subpoenaed several witnesses. Among them there were witnesses proposed by two parties, also local *Pai Jia* and Chamber of Commerce people. All did relevant corroboration.

Regarding lessee leaving without notifying, lease counted as fulfilling or not fulfilling, witnesses each had different statements and insights. Actually have or not have this rule, Liang Xinhu didn't care too much. Because regarding this kind of question, Senate's relevant laws all had regulations. Case condition nothing complex, applying directly was fine. He at this moment purely was for demonstrating to students of study group how to execute trial process correctly.

Interrogation scene was very dull. Zhang Jiayu couldn't help yawning quietly. This case tiny to couldn't be tinier also needed Senator to come out to try personally. This Australians' thinking was truly hard to fathom.

Cross-examination stage ended. Liang Xinhu didn't announce adjournment—this kind of cases not making collegial panel, not conducting mediation either. Judged by judge according to case directly.

Case was not hard to judge. But before judgment he made relevant explanation first. To let new judicial concept occupy high ground as soon as possible, explaining basis of case judgment already became judicial habit of Senate.

Especially Original Time Space's *Contract Law* and other various Commercial Laws' background differed from This Time Space situation far. Rashly applying problem many. Commercial Law of Europe in This Time Space although already had embryonic form, yet was still same problem—not conforming to national condition. And Chinese traditional laws such as *Great Ming Code* involved Commercial Law very little.
