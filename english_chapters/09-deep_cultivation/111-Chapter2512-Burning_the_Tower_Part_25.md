# Chapter 2512: Burning the Tower (25)

Zhao Manxiong exhaled lightly and said, "Not entirely. This operation at least limitedly split the enemy's alliance, provided opportunities for us to plant dispatched personnel to win over wavering targets, obtained data on the hostile organizations' direct leaders and backbone organizations, and preliminarily saw clearly the true face of Liang Cunhou's so-called martial background. Moreover, we had no losses. Having results means it wasn't a failure. At least our goal at the beginning of the operation was just to obtain direct intelligence on the enemy. We must allow them to make mistakes; maturity requires a process."

Wu Mu shook his head, sighed lightly, and said, "Too backward. In this backward era, we ourselves have started to degenerate."

Zhao Manxiong smiled: "A major theory of evolution is 'survival of the fittest.' So losing certain abilities is not necessarily 'degeneration,' but rather a kind of 'evolution' to adapt to the environment."

Wu Mu didn't dwell on this issue further: "Yang Cao's report has already been sent up. She seems to have objections to Xu Tong's actions. I also think it seems a bit too emotional, not decisive enough at the critical moment."

"I've already read the report," Zhao Manxiong said. "Her personal judgment certainly has her reasons. However, as I see it: in that situation, there was no optimal solution, nor a standard answer. The decision each person makes might be different. Since we sent them to execute the mission, we must trust their choices and defend their decisions within the framework of the rules."

Wu Mu said, "They are very different."

Zhao Manxiong said, "Everyone is a unique individual. I am glad our system has such people. Our organization is currently in a transitional period. We are now in an extraordinary time and have to use some unconventional means. This is determined by the specific characteristics of the special period. However, this particularity cannot be from beginning to end, nor can it be unscrupulously used. Do you remember the history of the Stasi I told you about?"

"I remember."

"The Stasi really achieved 'omnipotence' in the end, but it failed to protect the regime—and that was the reason for its existence. This is a very good lesson: the cart cannot be put before the horse." Zhao Manxiong lit a cigar. "Our ruled area is expanding. In about less than twenty years, the Senate will build a real country. 'Governing a large country is like cooking a small fish'; using any means necessary does not suit us. Xu Tong's performance might be 'not decisive enough' by Yang Cao's standards, but I personally appreciate him."

Wu Mu said, "Building from the bottom to prevent trouble before it happens?"

Zhao Manxiong nodded in agreement and said, "Liu Fuqing is a representative of the old era, useful but without potential, and unable to adapt to the changes of the new era; Yang Cao is a sharp sword we forged with our own hands, accepting our governing philosophy entirely, incomparably loyal, and peerlessly sharp; Xu Tong is the scabbard, used to contain the sharp edge, avoiding the sword going astray. King Arthur pulled out the Sword in the Stone, and Merlin warned him that the value of the scabbard was ten times that of the sword blade. But King Arthur eventually lost his own scabbard. Without knowing how to hide the sharpness, it is hard to have a good end."

Speaking to this point, Zhao Manxiong slowly opened his five fingers and said, "So, only children make multiple-choice questions." After speaking, his five fingers closed abruptly, tightly clenching together.

This could be considered very intimate words. Wu Mu didn't pick up his words but said, "Synthesizing intelligence from all aspects, the enemy has likely completed the initial integration of forces. Next, they will likely launch a comprehensive counterattack. It's just that currently we are unclear whether this counterattack is merely in the Liangguang region or if it will receive support from external forces."

"If I were the Great Ming Emperor or the Governor-General, I would naturally tend to have internal forces blossom in the center before the grand army begins the counteroffensive. This is also the optimal solution. However, judging from the relevant intelligence provided by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, whether the Ming court has such capability is in doubt."

"Solely in terms of shocking the court and the public, us capturing two provinces as giant bandits is stronger than the roving bandits and Wild Boar Skin (Manchus), right?"

"The words are correct," Zhao Manxiong said. "We captured Liangguang, taking two of the eighteen provinces. To the court and public, it is an unprecedented huge shock. But to the Ming court, the Manchus strolling just outside the Fifth Ring Road clearly pose a greater threat."

In a medieval society lacking effective communication means, capturing the capital would cause immense shock and a power vacuum. The central court would spare no cost to defend the capital. Yuan Chonghuan's death was largely because he failed to "keep the enemy outside the country's gate," letting the Eight Banners cavalry appear under the city walls of the capital.

For the Great Ming, where "the Son of Heaven guards the gate of the country," the fall of Liangguang thousands of *li* away and the Manchus wandering just a few hundred *li* away were completely different concepts: one was far on the horizon, the other was imminent.

This resulted in the Ming court strictly speaking being "shocked" by the fall of Liangguang, but actually remaining in a state of "discussing without deciding." Although the Ming court hadn't reached the end of its rope yet, the heavy troop group in Liaodong couldn't be transferred, and the few remaining mobile army groups in the Central Plains had to deal with the roving bandits, stretching them to the limit.

"...Although it is so," Zhao Manxiong said, "we cannot take it lightly either. The Foreign Intelligence Bureau comprehensively judges that the Ming court might launch a counteroffensive at the end of this year—the specific scale is unknown."

"So saying..."

"This can also explain why these opposition forces have suddenly become active again now." Zhao Manxiong said in a low voice: "On one hand, they want to seize this opportunity of counteroffensive. On the other hand, they don't have much time. The pace of our strategic adjustment is accelerating. The deployment of some bandit suppression troops has begun to adjust. The transformation of the grassroots level has also unfolded. Armed work teams in various places have started to form. But the Senate's policy is dragging its feet here. Issues like land have not yet been sorted out, and the gentry among the people hold a lot of discourse power. Our internal differences of opinion are too great."

He didn't say the rest of the words, but Wu Mu knew that in the final analysis, the Senate's "New Deal" didn't have enough benefit output. From this point of view, the common people certainly wouldn't come to "rebel," but neither would they "carry food to follow the army like a shadow."

Merely creating a "peaceful time" is not enough; there must also be sufficient "benefits"—whether real or fictional.

"...So, they won't resist if we come, but if someone incites and coerces them to rebel, it's not difficult either. After all, the common people lack the ability to think independently and have a superstitious blind obedience to the traditional dynasty and ruling order. It's only been a few years since the dynasty change; the remaining prestige of Great Ming is still there."

"But policy adjustment and implementation cannot be achieved overnight..."

"Needs time, needs time," Zhao Manxiong closed his eyes. "You go first. Before the case is closed, no need to come report to me again—I need to consider other issues now."

"Yes. Are you going back to Lingao?"

"I'm going to stay here for a period of time." Zhao Manxiong said, "Lingao is already past tense..."

Wu Mu pushed the door and went out. Zhao Manxiong slowly leaned back in the genuine leather office chair. Sunlight scattered over the office desk in front of him, bringing traces of warmth. He suddenly really wanted to touch it, but when he reached out his hand, the sunlight shifted slightly, still leaving him in the dark, seeming to deliberately avoid him. Zhao Manxiong smiled bitterly, leaned back, and closed his eyes. Opposite the sunlight, there was only the shadow of Lingao.

Wu Mu returned to his own office. Yang Cao had been waiting for a long time and began to report recent work to him.

The most urgent thing, besides Liang Cunhou's case, was the "Backbone Training Class" recently organized by the Civil Affairs Department. Although this training class was led by the Civil Affairs Department, the Political Security Bureau was also within the training organization. On one hand, it was to screen "suspicious targets"; on the other hand, it was to conduct necessary "security work training" for the backbone personnel.

Many among this batch were illiterate. Needless to say, the training work was very arduous, but things always had to have a start.

If their cadre training and placement had been concentrated in towns so far, then the next step was to go deep into rural areas.

"According to current intelligence, in areas where clan forces are currently not strong, there is a tendency for secret societies and religious sects to flood, producing many civil and criminal disputes."

"Has the legal article regarding banning secret societies been promulgated?"

"Already promulgated. The National Police are rushing to make relevant proclamations..."

"Wait for the newspaper to come out, then transfer all relevant materials except the 'White List' to Section Nine." Wu Mu said, "Our people are only responsible for collecting intelligence. Specific banning actions are executed by the police and the National Army." Wu Mu said: "I am not too knowledgeable in this aspect. Various bandit gangs and Daoist sects are as numerous as ox hairs. Including the Heavenly Soldier Daoist Spirit Society, I only paid key attention when hearing your report last time. Is there a group specifically responsible for contacting this kind of person?"

"We have a group specifically responsible for the reconnaissance work of secret societies. But a while ago, an intelligence officer lost contact. His work scope included inciting defection of Xue Tu. He has likely died in the line of duty; inciting defection should have failed. Combined with the leak incident of the bandit situation notification document some time ago, Xue Tu should have a major operation after completing the integration of underground forces this time. After the failure of peaceful negotiation, it will inevitably be accompanied by armed struggle. However, our main enemy is not secret societies—their power is the weakest in Liangguang. Far inferior to clans and gentry landlords."

"The Ming state will likely organize a major counterattack. These people must also be guarded against... How is the work on the gentry going?"

"All advancing according to plan."

Yang Cao asked, "Will they accumulate strength to wait for coordination and rear riots?"

"I see they can't wait. Liang Cunhou's martial background gives him a keen sense of smell. They are like rats in a bellows, feeling the pressure from the outside world. Not much time is left for them. They will definitely step up integration recently. You plant intelligence personnel inside as soon as possible. If necessary, controlled materials can be used. We need to grasp first-hand information! Get their movement direction, hiding locations, action plans, and times as soon as possible. At the same time, strengthen information communication with the military. Operation of such scale is not something we can handle," Wu Mu said.
