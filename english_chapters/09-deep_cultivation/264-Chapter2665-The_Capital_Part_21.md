# Chapter 2665: The Capital (Part 21)

In the reduced-column structure hall, the front part was broad and high, while the rear part had thick wooden pillars for support. The mottled paint marks on the beams and pillars were the sediment of time. A plaque hung high in the rear hall, engraved with four large dignified regular script characters: "Righteousness Through the Ages."

Below the plaque was a solid wood partition wall, carved with grass and vine patterns on all four sides. Couplets hung on both sides of the partition. A square table was placed in front of the partition. Li Rufeng sat upright in the grand armchair on the left, tea steam curling up from the table.

The sun had gone down, and the moon hadn't risen yet. The sky was very dark. In the evening mist, the projections of the two people sitting quietly in the hall were dim and blurred.

Liao Sanniang sat in the lower seat, gently pounding her shoulder and back with her fist. Li Rufeng scanned her with the corner of his eye and said, "If you are tired, go rest. This matter cannot be finished in a day or two. You need to nurture enough spirit for what's to come."

Liao Sanniang didn't speak, only shook her head, and said softly with some fatigue, "I'll go rest after the telegram text comes out."

While they were speaking, a fellow supported a large candle, placed it on the table, turned, and retreated.

Liao Sanniang looked at the candle flame, her state of mind drifting leisurely with the rise and fall of the flame.

Li Rufeng was waiting, waiting for an important message.

A telegram came from Lingao. Leng Ningyun's secretary, Hexiang, was decoding it.

The connection between Lingao and Beijing could only be through wireless telegraph. The Beijing Station was equipped with a telegraph machine. Although it was said that the radio environment in this spacetime was pure and signals from small power stations like the Silicon 2-Watt could cross a thousand miles in good weather, Beijing and Hainan were separated by thousands of miles after all. Although the radio assigned to the Beijing Station had relatively high power, it still couldn't communicate stably when encountering bad weather or atmospheric magnetic anomalies. Generally, messages were relayed through the Shandong and Nanjing stations, and timeliness was slightly poor.

This time they didn't wait long. They connected to Lingao at the most needed time and received a reply in less than three days.

Lingao's action was fast. On the issue of Senators' lives and safety, the Senate's deep-rooted procrastination did not exist; actions had always been vigorous and speedy.

Accidents are like diseases, often coming unexpectedly. No one dares to guarantee they won't encounter unforeseen events. The more resources paid to solve others' crises, the more righteously one can apply to call for more resources when one is in danger. Once a special case becomes a precedent, it forms a privilege.

The motto of the Senators had always been: One for all, all for one.

Of course, this motto was limited to within the Senators.

A servant of the Leng residence walked in quickly accompanied by a Heliansheng fellow. Without speaking, he handed a blank envelope directly to Li Rufeng.

Li Rufeng said nothing, waved his hand signaling the two to leave, and then opened a codebook at hand.

After receiving the telegram, secondary decoding was required. Plaintext transmission between personnel was avoided to prevent the message from being lost, stolen, or peeked at during transit and handover. In the Beijing Station, only Senator Leng Ningyun, operator Hexiang, and security head Li Rufeng each had a copy. Other personnel received orders conveyed by Leng Ningyun after Hexiang decoded them.

Li Rufeng fished out a pencil, compared it with the codebook, and recorded quickly on a piece of paper. The pencil rubbed against the letter paper with a rustling sound.

Li Rufeng wrote with difficulty. His rough large hand, covered with knife-grip calluses, holding a thin pencil, appeared abnormally incongruous.

The sky turned completely dark. The hall was quiet. Liao Sanniang watched Li Rufeng silently.

On the candlestick, the wax tears had dried. A fellow came in to change to a new candle. This was already the third candle.

The dancing candle flame reflected on Li Rufeng's angular face, making his expression appear indeterminate in the light and shadow.

After decoding the telegram, Li Rufeng blew the pencil shavings off the paper with a *pu*, read it quickly once, and then handed it to Liao Sanniang.

Liao Sanniang unfolded it and read by the dim candlelight. The telegram read:

**Guang-Secret-Urgent No. 1007:**
**Jan 4, 1637. Your telegram received. The Senate attaches great importance to the Leng Ningyun Case, now designated "Capital Case 01." Upon the date of this telegram, a joint special task force for "Capital Case 01" composed of Military Intelligence and Special Recon has been formed. The task force set sail on a special ship on the same day and will land at Tianjin Port recently, proceeding to Beijing by land. Please ask relevant comrades of the Beijing Station to do a good job in docking, cooperation, and data sorting in advance.**

**Additionally, agree with the conservative response plan adopted by the Beijing Station in the early stage. Specifically propose the following points, please arrange accordingly:**

**1. The case adopts a step-by-step principle: rescue people first, solve the case second. Do not rush to solve the case. The priority is to strive for Leng Ningyun's safe return. Under the premise of ensuring the first step, advance the second step cautiously. If the two steps conflict, the second step can be abandoned as appropriate.**

**2. The right to life outweighs property rights. The Beijing Station can use all resources to ensure Senator Leng's personal safety. Wu Kaidi is now appointed as the Temporary Acting Station Master of the Beijing Station, authorized to handle matters related to the Leng Case with full power. After full communication with relevant comrades of the Beijing Station, he can allocate Delong's working capital, doing a good job in the ledger of relevant fund inflows and outflows for post-event financial inspection.**

**3. Principle of secret investigation. All investigation work of the Beijing Station immediately goes underground. Wait in stillness for movement to avoid provoking criminals and threatening hostage safety. All existing cases show there is no precedent of criminals stopping crime and surrendering under police pressure after family members report to the police. If the situation deteriorates, criminals will kill hostages to vent anger and then flee.**

**4. Comrades Li Rufeng, Liao Sanniang, and others are temporarily seconded from the Qiwei Escort Agency to work for the External Intelligence Bureau from the date of this telegram. Li Rufeng is now appointed as the Temporary Security Person-in-Charge of the Beijing Station, and Liao Sanniang is to assist in the work. The above personnel are to assess the current security situation of the Beijing Station as a reference for the future retention or removal of the Beijing Station. The timeliness of kidnapping cases is crucial. The situation on the front line changes in the blink of an eye. Relevant security personnel must adapt to changes and handle sudden situations flexibly. In case of sudden situations, there is no need to wait for orders; free your hands and feet, dare to take responsibility, and avoid rigidity causing delays in handling timing.**

**5. Being behind enemy lines, with enemies and us mixed, try to avoid armed conflict unless necessary.**

**6. Maintain existing relations with the Usurper Ming court to prevent forming a two-front constraint, causing inconvenience to rescue work.**

**7. Now deploying 3 radio stations from Guangzhou, carried by civilian ships, to temporarily form a network with existing naval warships and military intelligence radios, striving to ensure smooth communication. Please transmit and receive daily between 22:00-23:00, frequency XXX.XX.**

**8. On the day the task force arrives, relevant work of the Beijing Station will be handed over to the task force. The temporary appointments of Wu, Li, and Liao in this telegram will be automatically relieved after handover, and follow-up will be arranged by the task force.**

**Recently, military conflicts between us and the reactionary armed forces of the Usurper Ming in Guangxi have intensified, and the work of mopping up local bandit armed forces in Guangdong has also entered a critical stage. Implicated by the war situation, the intelligence, diplomacy, and commercial work of the Beijing Station have been disturbed and encountered temporary setbacks. Facing difficulties, you gentlemen should hold your original intentions, face difficulties head-on, not fear floating clouds blocking your eyes, and let your ambitions surge. On another day, climbing high and looking far, wherever the cannon fire range reaches, it will all be the territory of the Great Song. Hope you gentlemen work hard, bravely shoulder heavy burdens, establish new merits again. The road ahead is bright; we walk with you.**

**——Center Message copied to Li, Liao. Jan 5, 1637.**

Liao Sanniang finished reading the telegram and let out a light breath. Her heart seemed to have found a bottom all of a sudden. She returned the telegram to Li Rufeng. Li Rufeng took it, read it twice more, brought the translation close to the candle flame to ignite it. When it burned until only a corner was left, he shook his hand, and the embers turned into a puff of flying ash with a *pu*.

Li Rufeng breathed a sigh of relief and said, "This is pumping us up, fearing we can't hold on and the stall will scatter. Although they didn't say the arrival date, the task force should arrive within no more than ten days."

Liao Sanniang said, "Just afraid the situation will change."

Li Rufeng frowned and said, "Changes are certain."

Liao Sanniang asked, "If it really reaches the point where things cannot be done, how many fast guns do we have?"

Li Rufeng said, "Ten Nanyang Rifles, all smoothbores. They can hit ninety paces, cannot compare to the breech-loading fast rifles of the Forbidden Army. The number of people we can entrust with firearms confidently is only this many. You and I have four Repeating Short Guns in total; the barrels are grooved. They are all hidden in the secret cellar."

Liao Sanniang nodded and said, "They can really be useful in critical moments. With only dozens of people in this agency, if we form a formation in the open field, relying on firearms, we can fight two hundred people. Relying on carts to build a fort, we can fight even three or four hundred local bandits. With the short gun, I can hit accurately at ten paces."

Li Rufeng sucked his teeth and said with some difficulty, "I can hit fifteen paces, but if we encounter a large group of thousands of bandits, it will be hard to deal with. Even if the task force arrives, there are too few people. I know someone in the Capital Battalion..."

Liao Sanniang interrupted him flatly, "Absolutely not. Just this one hundred thousand taels of ready silver can invite military chaos. Those who are soldiers, since ancient times, their black eyeballs only recognize white silver. They would kill even their own fathers, let alone friends. If the government army intervenes, you, I, and Master Leng will all die in the chaotic army, let alone..."

Speaking of this, Liao Sanniang paused before continuing, "They are mostly not big bandits. If they really were big bandits capable of gathering five or seven thousand men and horses for an uprising, they wouldn't act like this. The Australian Song's military fame is only on the coast. The roving bandits in the Central Plains have shallow knowledge and are ill-informed. Inland local bandits do not know the sharpness of the Great Song's soldiers and do not have much scruple about the Great Song's prestige in their actions. Local bandits do not know tomorrow's events today; they act recklessly, killing people like cutting grass. Robbing one or two rich households for ransom is just a small matter; no need to hide head and tail. The bandits are unwilling to reveal themselves and act sneakily. They can only be local rich men or sitting local powers, fearing that if the matter leaks, they will have no standing. The Great Ming has always emphasized the center controlling the periphery. The soldiers of the Five Military Commissions of the Capital Battalion entrench in the center. It's hard to say about other places, but there aren't many places for local bandits to hide around the capital. I scouted outside the city the day before yesterday, firstly to set up eyes at intersections and passes; secondly, to collect news of surrounding tycoons. I guess, maybe..."

Li Rufeng leaned forward and cut in, "Just in the prefectures and counties near the capital?"

Liao Sanniang nodded and said, "Just a wild guess, no evidence. This is called, um, a woman's intuition."

Li Rufeng smiled bitterly and said, "I am really too tired. Seeing the matter has no conclusion, I actually wanted to beg the Capital Battalion. Now I still have to use money to redeem life, dealing with moves as they come."

Liao Sanniang said, "Yes, your mind is muddled." She frowned and said, "I just feel it's a bit strange. It is extremely difficult to transport and store one hundred thousand taels of silver. Even if the kidnappers succeed, they themselves will become a piece of fat meat..."
