# Chapter 2533: Baojia

At the beginning of the landing, the entire territory of Lingao County had only tens of thousands of people, and the total population of Hainan Island was no more than two or three hundred thousand. Coupled with years of management, suppressing bandits was much simpler. Moreover, the subsequent increase in population on the island was all taken in and settled by the Senate, managed through the standard administrative village model. The control intensity was not comparable to these newly occupied areas on the mainland.

However, these effective methods were products of a special environment, and trying to replicate them in Guangdong was obviously beyond their ability. According to social surveys and historical data estimates, the total population of Guangdong and Guangxi was about thirteen or fourteen million. The Pearl River Delta alone concentrated millions of people. Even if all the cadres on Hainan Island were moved to the Pearl River Delta, it wouldn't be enough to distribute.

On the mainland, especially in natural villages in the Pearl River Delta, they were often of the same surname, or at most two or three surnames. Foreign surnames were mostly excluded from village administration. It was difficult to plant eyes and ears. Therefore, the government could never control affairs and news within the village in a timely manner.

Currently, what the Senate controlled most thoroughly in the Pearl River Delta were the Tanka villages. After abolishing the debased status, Tanka people were allowed to land and build houses. Under the guidance of the Municipal Government, many brand-new Tanka villages were formed. These Tanka villages were managed uniformly according to the Hainan administrative village model. Not only were government decrees smooth, but the grasp of the grassroots was also very strong.

By controlling these newly built villages, the Senate planted its own informants between various natural villages in some areas. The household registration of Tanka people effectively curbed the activities of water bandits in the Pearl River system. Especially the Four Surnames Water Bandits who were rampant for a time; after the Tanka people went ashore and registered, they lost their survival soil and had been completely cleared under continuous strikes. The situation of openly intercepting and looting ships on the river surface dropped significantly.

It is undeniable that Tanka people were the main source of water bandits in the entire Pearl River basin. The Four Surnames Water Bandits who ran rampant on the river surface were all of Tanka origin. Huge numbers and a drifting lifestyle made them "unstable factors" difficult to manage in all dynasties.

Abolishing the debased status and landing to build villages actually integrated them into the normal social order. Then through the recruitment of "professionals" among the Tanka people: recruiting pilots and sailors let part of them enter "within the system." Although the number wasn't too large, it was a "stabilizer" among the Tanka group.

Liu Xiang was able to quickly clear the large groups of water bandits in the Pearl River basin; the move of Tanka poeple landing could be called a brilliant hand.

The unique pirates of Fujian and Guangdong, since the Senate's Navy dominated the ocean surface, even giant bandits like Liu Xiang [Liu Xiang the pirate, distinct from Prefect Liu Xiang] had defected to the Senate. Small groups of pirates had almost no living space and had basically become extinct.

As for land bandits, because the Senate changed the world and rectified clerks, the situation of official-bandit collusion was cleared up. Public security also improved significantly.

However, Zhang Xiao also knew that completely eliminating bandits was impossible; the old timeline still had "Strike Hard" campaigns in the nineties. So for the governance of social problems, they had to be solved from the root. The common people on this land were always the easiest to manage; provided they weren't unable to survive, they wouldn't rise up to rebel.

All problems, boiled down to the end, were economic problems. However, regarding economic problems, what Zhang Xiao could intervene in was actually limited; it mainly depended on the project investment of the Planning Academy. What he could do was nothing more than "encouraging agriculture and sericulture," striving to boost agriculture.

With familiarity with the county situation over these days, Zhang Xiao also noticed another problem in Nanhai County that ordinary people found difficult to notice, which was that the Nanhai county seat was located inside Guangzhou Prefecture City, almost on the borderline of the entire county territory. This was quite similar to Shunde's situation, but more extreme than Shunde. The county seat being situated in a corner of the county territory was very unfavorable for governing the entire jurisdiction. In Jiujiang, far from the Nanhai county seat, and Longshan area, far from the Shunde county seat, there even circulated the saying "Jiujiang does not recognize Nan[hai], Two Longs do not recognize Shun[de]."

Shortly after the establishment of the Republic of China, various attached counties moved their county governments out of the prefecture city to find another seat, or simply rebuilt a city. It is visible that people at that time had already realized this drawback. After the Reform and Opening Up, there was a second wave of attached counties separating and building new districts.

If Nanhai County was moved out, where would be suitable? From a geographical perspective, the most suitable was naturally Foshan Fort. But Foshan had now been designated as a "Demonstration Management Zone," and would inevitably be established as a separate county in the next step.

How about simply moving to Jiujiang? *Humph humph, since you don't recognize Nan, I'll just move the county seat over, and you won't be able to not recognize it.*

To effectively control remote areas within the county borders and create a good public security environment—this was not an easy task.

Thinking of this, Zhang Xiao suddenly wanted to hear the governance methods of the ancients from four hundred years ago, so he asked Wei Bifu: "If in the previous dynasty, you were the magistrate, what bandit suppression strategies would you have?"

Wei Bifu answered: "In this small person's opinion, the Baojia Law can be strictly enforced. That is, implementing Baojia registration for each Bao and Jia, branding the stern of the boat with the Bao and Jia number and the boat owner's name of a certain county, painting colors on the boat hull or bow and stern for recognition, which can be distinguished even from a distance. Also create detailed registers of household names, two copies of the same kind, one reported to the official, one kept by the Bao Chief, checking from time to time. Boats are only allowed to pole and navigate for livelihood during the day; when evening comes, they gather and moor at the original port. If one boat does evil or poles out privately at night, the Jia Chief and the eight boats of the same Jia are allowed to report clearly to the Bao Chief, jointly sending them to the official for investigation. If nine boats mutually conceal and it is reported by the Bao Chief, the nine boats will be punished together. If the Bao Chief conceals everything and it is discovered separately or found by local officials, the Bao Chief will be punished by collective liability."

Wei Bifu's answer made Zhang Xiao unable to help criticizing inwardly: "It seems Wang Yangming's 'Ten-Family Tablet Law' is really the only choice in ancient times."

The Baojia Law, as an important social governance measure in ancient times, began in the Song Dynasty and continued until the Republic of China. Although Wang Yangming, as a master of Neo-Confucianism, repeatedly taught people to "establish sincerity," when he deeply experienced the unruliness of unruly people, he also suddenly realized the truth of "Warfare is the Way of Deception." Chicken soup in the left hand, political maneuvering in the right hand; one cannot practice benevolent governance towards unruly people. While touring Southern Gan as Grand Coordinator, after arriving at the prefecture office to take office, Wang Yangming issued one of the most famous measures in his military career—*Ten-Family Tablet Law Proclamation to Elders and Children of Assume Prefectures*. The specific content was no different from what Wei Bifu said. The specific content of the check included: Who is missing from whose family tonight, where did they go, to do what, when will they return. Who is extra in whose family tonight, who is it, where did they come from, doing what. If one family violates, ten families share the same crime.

Seeing Zhang Xiao not speak, Wei Bifu continued: "River and sea bandits are mostly treacherous people driving boats to catch fish, often appearing and disappearing in vast oceans and great floods, scouting solitary boats coming and going, acting recklessly to rob and then sailing far away with the wind. If encountering government pursuit pressing hard, they sink the loot to the bottom of the water and remain fishermen. There are also accumulated treacherous net boats, fishing in the port during the day and going out of the port to rob at night. It is the same everywhere, a great harm to the people. Implementing the Baojia Law allows fishing households to supervise each other, incorporating these floating people into the scope of surveillance and control, and also depriving outside strange boats of hiding places."

Zhang Xiao had read historical materials of Yu Chenglong governing banditry in the Taihu Lake basin in the Qing Dynasty, so he commented: "Organizing boats into Bao is only one aspect. Currently, the Senate is incorporating Tanka people and setting up administrative villages, which has largely solved the problem of fishermen. Materials robbed by water bandits need to be converted into silver and money in towns on dry land, so inspection of harboring families on land along the river must also be strengthened. Nanhai County is located in the delta region, with a dense water network, which is equivalent to incorporating all residents into the scope of Baojia. Perhaps the Ming Dynasty has already promoted Baojia measures, but such regulations require Bao and Jia Chiefs to have high quality and be diligent and attentive. Guangdong prefectures and counties delay everything. I saw lawsuits in the former courtyard delayed for five or six years before closing. If not repeatedly urged, it is no different from waiting for a piece of waste paper."

Yu Chenglong also once promoted the decree of organizing and checking Baojia for fishermen and village residents in the Taihu Lake basin, but robbery cases in the Taihu area did not decrease because of this afterwards, and even showed a trend of increasing during the Yongzheng reign. It can be speculated that the execution of Baojia was unsatisfactory; it is very likely that this decree was not executed at all.

However, with the vision of Ming officials, seeing to this extent regarding the governance of river and sea bandits already counted as a capable official. The execution problem pointed out by Zhang Xiao poked Wei Bifu's sore spot at once, making him convinced: "The Chief observes into the minutest detail. This is accumulated malpractice of the previous dynasty. Even if we have ability as big as the sky, we can do nothing."

Sitting for a long time made Zhang Xiao's waist a bit sore. He stood up and stretched his waist, saying, "Didn't the Senate come? We came here to do only three things: Fairness! Oh no, Transformation! Transformation! Transformation!"

"The Chief has such ambition; it is truly the fortune of the ten thousand people. This small person's admiration for the Chief is like the surging river water, endless and continuous..." Wei Bifu flattered.

Zhang Xiao didn't listen to Wei Bifu's flattery, calculating in his heart: this place is indeed full of multifarious administrative affairs. Next, he had to go to the countryside for on-site visits. To become a good successor, he had to abide by the "Pareto Principle," that is, continuing 80% of the predecessor's policies and innovating the remaining 20%. Let's see how he displays his skills.

After ending this dialogue, Wei Bifu immediately asked for leave at the Municipal Government and went to Jiujiang Fort. Huang Xiyin had waited bitterly for many days and was already wearing his eyes out looking. Seeing Wei Bifu suddenly visit to invite him, he couldn't help feeling joy falling from the sky. With slight preparation, he followed Wei Bifu to Guangzhou and met Zhang Xiao.

After chatting simply for a few sentences, Zhang Xiao asked about his resume.

"Reporting to the Chief, this student passed the *Jinshi* examination in the Xinwei year of Chongzhen 4. After observing administration for two years, I was bestowed as Magistrate of Nanhai..."

"Your promotion speed is okay!" Zhang Xiao was somewhat surprised. According to what he knew, the period from passing *Jinshi* to becoming an official for Qing scholars ranged from two or three years to ten or twenty years. Some *Jinshi* even remained candidate officials all their lives and couldn't become officials. Although Ming scholars were much fewer than Qing, this Magistrate Huang's promotion speed could not be said to be unfast.

"Ashamed, ashamed," Huang Xiyin said modestly. "Just lucky."

"Since you served as Nanhai Magistrate for these years, your understanding of county administration and county situation must be more thorough than Councilor Wei. Since I came here to be the Parent Official of Nanhai County, I will ask you to advise and guide more in the future."
