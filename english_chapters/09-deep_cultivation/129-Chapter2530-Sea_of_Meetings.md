# Chapter 2530: Sea of Meetings

Wen Desi first expressed agreement with Zhang Xiao's doubts: "Comrade Zhang Xiao's worry makes a lot of sense; we have lessons in this regard. Let alone Guangzhou, which has an unstable foothold. However, precisely because of this, everyone should understand us more."

After saying that, he turned to Wu Mu and said, "Everyone present is clear about the situation in the past two years. The Senate is unwilling to face instability in the rear while fighting the Ming army, and has to compromise with local forces. These forces have always behaved with detachment—neither can they be truly controlled, nor is it easy to catch handles to suppress them. In extraordinary times, we don't necessarily have to deliberately pursue procedural justice. Our plan can adapt to circumstances completely; even if we arrest them all first, we can always find people to bite them, right?"

The Political Security Bureau Senators were already accustomed to Wen Desi's violent arguments. Previously, he had told the Little Senators in Foshan that if necessary, he wouldn't mind nihilating the tens of thousands of people in Foshan Town.

Wu Mu gave a noncommittal response, but on the issue of whether to insist on procedural justice, Director Zhao obviously had deeper considerations:

"If we don't want to follow in the footsteps of those famous people in history who stopped children from crying at night but were finally thrown away like broken rags, we must insist on 'procedural justice,' because the groups that gain the maximum benefit from 'efficient actions' will try their best to dissociate from it."

At this time, Li Zhuoxian expressed his opinion: "In the stories everyone knows, even in the Shunzhi period when most of the country had been brought under the rule of a certain dynasty, Guangdong remained in an awkward situation of unclear allegiance and semi-Qing semi-Ming for a long time. Tracing the cause, it was still that all strata of Guangdong society faced difficult choices of direction. Later, the Qing Dynasty continued the policies of the previous dynasty and actively wooed local gentry by holding imperial examinations, finally gaining the acceptance and recognition of Guangdong society. Therefore, the rule of these two dynasties was a continuous era. Obviously, the Senate does not intend to continue the Ming Dynasty's policies, so even if we temporarily follow the rules of Xiao and Cao [retain existing rules] in some areas and fields due to insufficient strength now, fierce conflicts with feudal gentry will inevitably erupt in the near future. In my view, bloodshed is unavoidable. But I can understand the worries of some Senators. If there is indiscriminate 'cleansing,' we will encounter unexpected resistance locally during the Northern Expedition in the future. The dispatch of troops must have a justifiable cause; it is best to pull up potential resistance forces by the roots at once."

"This is exactly 'wanting both... and...'" Mu Min couldn't help roasting. As she learned more about Guangzhou society, she loathed these feudal gentry more.

Someone else said, "I still feel that short pain is better than long pain..."

The Municipal Government team obviously didn't quite agree with President Wen's opinion. Liu Xiang's opinion was very clear: without conclusive evidence of a major case like the Witchcraft Case, he did not approve of indiscriminate "cleansing" actions.

*NND, this Prefect Liu's attitude is very ambiguous now*, Zhang Xiao thought. *When he first came to Guangzhou, he was very keen on "fabricating charges" and making a fortune from "raiding homes." Why has his nature suddenly changed now? Could it be that he has some PY [unspeakable]... interest connections with the local gentry? This is worth digging deep into...*

While he was letting his imagination run wild, the meeting mentioned in the briefing on gentry movements that Chen Bangyan might be colluding with the Flower Mountain Bandits.

He was quite familiar with the group known as Flower Mountain Bandits. In the history of the old timeline, they were once an important force opposing the Qing in late Ming Guangdong. In this timeline, Zhang Xiao had seen their great name more than once in relevant newsletters and briefings. Because in this timeline, they were also a potential force threatening the Senate's rule in Guangdong. They were the number one target in the public security rectification campaign shortly after taking Guangzhou.

Unexpectedly, they were still there! Although he knew proposing this doubt was inappropriate, he couldn't help asking, "The Flower Mountain Bandits are still there? I originally thought that after two years of public security rectification campaigns, they should have disappeared."

"This is also something I wanted to raise at today's meeting." Liu Xiang glanced at him and said, "After we occupied various prefectures and counties in Guangdong, the administrative divisions still followed the Ming Dynasty's setup. Flower Mountain is located at the junction of several counties, with dangerous terrain and mixed personnel. It is far from all county seats and has always been a main area where bandits gather in Guangdong, known as the 'Three-No-Governance Land' of Panyu, Qingyuan, and Conghua. It only gradually calmed down after Hua County was established separately in the early Kangxi years. Multiple suppression campaigns were followed by the quick emergence of new bandit gangs, showing that our local governance still has deficiencies."

Another reason Liu Xiang didn't mention was that this area lacked powerful gentry or strong clans. The Municipal Government lacked local assistance to maintain public security in the Flower Mountain area at low cost, which was difficult to achieve. At present, they could only spend great effort to go down and govern it themselves.

"The Prefect means to add a Hua County?" Zhang Xiao understood Liu Xiang's purpose.

"Correct," Liu Xiang said. "Actually, as early as the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, gentry petitioned to establish a county in Flower Mountain. I propose to conform to the needs of the situation and separate Huaning Fort, Sushan Fort, Luocun Fort, etc., of Sanjiang Division of Nanhai District, as well as parts of Panyu District, to combine and establish Hua County, strengthening the management of this zone where no one governs."

Liu Xiang asked Zhang Xiao again, "You have no objection, right? Just arrived and a piece of land is carved out of your jurisdiction."

Zhang Xiao hurriedly said, "No objection, no objection. The water in Nanhai is deeper than the Mariana Trench. Carving out a few more pieces is fine; it just helps lighten my burden."

Liu Xiang nodded. It seemed this "Pharmacist" from an industrial background had done his "homework" in advance. Back then, when Ma Qianzhu saw that the "Little Senator Social Practice" proposal was a done deal in the Senate, he intended to let Hou Wenyong, the District Mayor of Nanhai District, concurrently serve as Director of the Foshan Economic Development Zone Management Committee, leading the Little Senators in their internship. Obviously, psychologically, Senators were unwilling to see naturalized citizen cadres climb over Senators to give orders, even Little Senators. That was why he pushed Zhang Yunmi out and transferred Hou Wenyong to replace Zhang Yunmi as Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, which counted as making the best use of talent. The position of Nanhai District Mayor naturally could only be temporarily held by Liu Xiang concurrently.

Besides the cadres drafted from Fangcaodi Academy and Middle School Division, a batch of Nanhai District cadres also followed the Little Senator to Foshan. With this transfer, although Ma Qianzhu's plan fell through, Liu Xiang himself not only held multiple posts but also had to send away a batch of hands, gradually becoming overwhelmed, which was why he sent a telegram to Xiao Zishan. This "Pharmacist" had just entered the city and appeared not only to have a deep understanding of the local situation but also brought a batch of his own team. It could be said to greatly reduce his pressure. It seemed there was an expert guiding him.

"President Wen, do you see if we should apply to the Government Affairs Yuanyuan for the regional adjustment?" Liu Xiang probed Wen Desi's opinion seeing that no participants opposed it.

Wen Desi said, "According to current regulations: adjustments of administrative divisions at the county level and below in the Guangdong and Guangxi regions can be decided by the Guangdong Region itself. It just needs to be reported to the Government Affairs Yuanyuan for the record. Information on both sides needs to be aligned to avoid information asymmetry."

Just like that, after Zhang Xiao arrived in Guangzhou, he had meetings for three consecutive days—large meetings, small meetings, all kinds of meetings, one after another. The overwhelming information exceeded his brain's processing capacity.

Although he often had meetings in the industrial sector, industrial meetings were mostly technical in nature, with a small amount involving management and resource allocation. The number of participants was usually small, and unless it was a technical breakthrough meeting, long meetings were rare.

Here it was completely different. Almost all lines had to hold meetings, and as the Executive Vice Magistrate of Nanhai County, he not only had to attend the vast majority of Guangzhou City meetings but also host relevant meetings for Nanhai County. The meetings were almost day and night.

He originally wanted to summon county cadres and important figures in the county for individual talks and then go down to "walk around" to understand the grassroots situation. Unexpectedly, after a week in Guangzhou, apart from wandering between various "government offices," he hadn't stepped out of the Nanhai County Government gate. His schedule was full.

Although he hadn't made a public appearance yet, the *Yangcheng Express* had published relevant news on the front page on the day of his arrival: "Industrial Senator's Transformation brings New Atmosphere to Local Governance," formally announcing the appointment of the Nanhai County Magistrate to the Guangzhou public. Liu Xiang also prepared to formally introduce this new helper to the Guangzhou gentry at the New Policy Lecture on the fifteenth.

During the continuous meetings, he also gained a rough understanding of the current situation in Guangzhou and Nanhai. Especially the cadre status and administrative situation he was most concerned about.

Cadres in various prefectures and counties of Guangdong had all studied the three "Civil Servant Guidance Series" drafted by Lin Baiguang: *Outline of County Government Administration*, *Guide to Government Affairs*, and *Common Laws and Regulations for Grassroots Government*. These were compiled based on his experience as a county office director and various "Guides to Being an Official" published in the Ming and Qing eras, combined with actual conditions. There were no problems with the general principles, and they had strong practicality. But books are books after all; they cannot include every possible government issue in minute detail. The abilities of the deployed naturalized citizen cadres were uneven. Many times they couldn't handle problems flexibly combined with actual situations, leading to many policies going out of tune. This contrast also vividly reflected that Senators were the neural center of the entire Great Song; for a considerable period, naturalized citizen cadres still could not replace Senators.

Nanhai's naturalized citizen cadres were known as the "Strongest Lineup" in all of Guangdong, but after actually understanding it, this "Strongest Lineup" had a lot of water content.

The specific water content lay in rural cadres and urban cadres. As everyone knows, Nanhai County is a county attached to the city of Guangzhou. The county yamen is also located inside Guangzhou Prefecture City. However, Nanhai County is not only the part of "Nanhai District" urban area but also includes the vast rural areas outside the city walls. Because of Guangzhou's special attributes, the cadre configuration for the "Nanhai District" inside the city walls is stronger, with top-notch relevant experience and ability. But once in the vast rural areas outside the city walls, the resumes of the cadres appear not so good-looking.
