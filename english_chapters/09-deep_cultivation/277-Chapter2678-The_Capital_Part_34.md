# Chapter 2678: The Capital (Part 34)

With the support of a "cheat" for more than a year, Wang Yehao had successfully risen to occupy the top chair of the Office of Transmission, ranking among the Nine Ministers. The Office controlled the submission and sealing of memorials from both inside and outside the capital. Whether transmitting imperial orders, relaying conditions from below, handling official documents from various offices, or processing suggestions from all quarters—everything flowed through here. It was arguably the most well-informed government office in the entire court. Consequently, the seasonal gifts and relationship-building fees from officials everywhere invariably included a share for this place.

When the Eunuch Party held power, the authority of the Office of Transmission had been greatly diminished, with the Document Office of the Directorate of Ceremonial effectively usurping its position. Since the current Emperor ascended the throne, however, the Office of Transmission had restored its former status, and Wang Yehao's standing rose with the tide.

Yet a "meager gift" delivered to his residence today by Wang Zunde, the Viceroy of Liangguang, had put Wang Yehao in something of a difficult position. It wasn't that Wang Yehao was incorruptible and dared not accept such offerings—far from it—but rather that the item listed on the gift inventory was "Australian Treasures."

He recalled Liu Zhao and Zhou Lezhi returning from Guangzhou and mentioning the Hearthstone Immortal's strange reaction upon seeing "Australian goods." They had also reported that the Immortal told Master Gao he was himself an Australian and had tried to locate these overseas merchants.

From this perspective, even if this Immortal Zhou wasn't truly an "Australian," he at least had some significant connection to this group of overseas merchants.

"Go summon Liu Zhao and Zhou Lezhi. Make sure to avoid Mr. Zhou." Wang Yehao mulled it over repeatedly but remained uncertain, so he instructed Wang Liang to fetch them for confirmation. "Wait—call Liu Sha over as well."

Because Liu Zhao had become most familiar with Mr. Zhou, he had been assigned to continue serving in the Zhou household after returning to the capital—ostensibly as a guard, but in reality for close surveillance. Combined with the student Zhou Lezhi, the attendant Wang Zhi, and the bed-chamber maid Jieyi, Master Wang had practically installed undercover agents around the Hearthstone Daoist inside and out, on the bed and off it. It amounted to around-the-clock, comprehensive monitoring with no blind spots.

Mr. Zhou was not only unaware of this arrangement but actually quite satisfied with it. After all, in this era lacking modern entertainment, having two people he could hold a decent conversation with was far preferable to facing a bed-chamber maid who barely recognized a handful of characters each day. He had already successfully recreated epoch-making pastimes such as *Dou Dizhu* [Fight the Landlord], UNO, and Aeroplane Chess, and was now setting out to develop more sophisticated card games like *Sanguosha* [Legends of the Three Kingdoms].

That night, Liu Zhao, Zhou Lezhi, and Liu Sha gathered in the study as summoned. Wang Yehao's first priority was confirming the secrecy of the meeting: "You came out so late—did Mr. Zhou suspect anything?"

"Master may rest assured. The entire residence is staffed by our people; we guarantee it's kept completely hidden." Liu Zhao replied with a smile. "At this hour, Mr. Zhou should be enjoying himself with Jieyi. Afterward, he'll fall asleep and won't wake until the sun is high in the sky."

"What if he doesn't sleep?"

"This humble one slipped some mood-enhancing medicine into his tea—he'll only be more exhausted afterward."

"You certainly have your methods." Wang Yehao stroked his beard with satisfaction, then suddenly thought of something. "Speaking of which, why is there still no movement in Jieyi's belly? Go back and remind her—if she still doesn't conceive, she won't be made the principal wife."

"Understood. Your subordinate knows what to do." Liu Zhao nodded in acknowledgment, then looked at Wang Yehao, awaiting further instructions.

"This Official summoned you here today to identify some items." Wang Yehao opened the gift box on the desk as he spoke and asked, "Are these Australian objects?"

By the lamplight, several crystal-clear glass fruit plates came into view. Liu Zhao examined them carefully for a long while, then said with some uncertainty: "Master, your subordinate truly hasn't seen such glassware in the Gao Family shop before. However, I only visited once—Zhou Lezhi should have seen more."

"Reporting to the Master, this humble one hasn't seen them either." Zhou Lezhi continued where Liu Zhao left off. "The Gao Family shop carries many rare goods, but they've certainly never sold anything like these. Then again, it's hard to say—perhaps they kept the finest merchandise hidden and didn't sell it openly. However..." He hesitated for a moment before adding, "They do look remarkably similar to the goods in the Gao Family shop!"

While everyone was struggling to reach a conclusion, Liu Zhao suddenly frowned. "No—these aren't from the Gao Family shop. Look, there are characters on the bottom of this plate: 'Purple Treasure Studio' [*Zi Zhen Zhai*]!"

Wang Yehao hurriedly took out the other vessels to check. Without exception, all bore the same stamp.

"Have you seen this shop in Guangzhou Prefecture?" Wang Yehao asked, rubbing his finger over the stamp on the plate's bottom.

"Your subordinate has not. Everyone in Guangzhou knows that Australian goods are sold exclusively at the Gao Family shop—there are absolutely no branch stores." Liu Zhao spoke with complete certainty.

"So if Australian goods are only sold at the Gao Family shop, and the stamp isn't from the Gao Family shop, then these aren't Australian objects?" Liu Sha, who had been listening from the side, asked with evident confusion.

"Master, forgive this humble one for speaking out of turn, but these items do have extraordinary qualities." Liu Zhao offered a different opinion. "Although your subordinate holds a low position, I have seen fine things while on duty at the *Zhenfusi*. May I ask if the Master has ever seen glass cups this transparent before?"

"Indeed, I have not."

"Setting aside that the patterns and dimensions of these glass cups are identical down to a hair, just looking at the stamp underneath—it isn't something ordinary craftsmen could produce." Liu Zhao paused and continued in a grave tone, "In my humble opinion, these glass cups are undoubtedly foreign goods."

"Even ordinary foreign glassware isn't like this." Zhou Lezhi had lived in the suburbs of Guangzhou since childhood and had visited the city proper, where he'd seen both barbarians and foreign goods.

"So you're suggesting perhaps that Australian sea merchant has returned?" Wang Yehao agreed with Liu Zhao's analysis. Moreover, Wang Zunde was merely sending some routine relationship-building gifts—there would be no reason to lie about their origin.

"Your subordinate dares not speak rashly. Perhaps we should ask Mr. Zhou? He might have seen them." Liu Zhao suggested tentatively.

"No. If he learns of this, he'll definitely want to travel to Guangzhou to search for them again. We cannot let him slip away now." Wang Yehao rejected the idea decisively. "Do not mention today's matter to him."

"This humble one understands!" The two were about to withdraw when Wang Yehao said, "Brother Zhou, please stay a moment."

Because Zhou Lezhi counted as the Hearthstone Daoist's disciple, Wang Yehao was quite courteous to him on the surface.

"How is your study with Mr. Zhou progressing?"

Nearly every time Zhou Lezhi met with Wang Yehao, he would inquire about his studies—it had become a familiar refrain.

He quickly replied: "This humble one studies diligently every day. Whatever the Teacher instructs, whether I can master it or not, I first commit it to memory and then seek further guidance when the Teacher has time."

"Never mind what exactly you study," Wang Yehao said. "You've studied for a year now—do you understand even a fraction of his skills?"

"The Teacher's knowledge is vast as the ocean; this humble one has only learned superficialities."

"Hmm. What he teaches you is mostly arithmetic and *Gewu*—useful, but also of no great use. It seems he's unwilling to teach you his true abilities." Wang Yehao sighed.

Zhou Lezhi felt a chill run down his neck; the implication behind those words seemed to convey deep dissatisfaction with him.

Once deemed useless, what would become of him? He knew the answer even without thinking.

He hastily defended himself: "The Master doesn't realize—what Mr. Zhou teaches me are all secret studies learned from overseas. Once mastered, one gains the ability to comprehend heaven and earth. Only this secret study has three fundamental prerequisites that must be learned first before one can approach the advanced knowledge..."

"Oh? Is that so?" Wang Yehao regarded him with skepticism. "What three fundamentals?"

"The first is arithmetic, the second is *Gewu*, and the third is Logic..."

Wang Yehao had no idea what "Logic" meant and remained dubious about Zhou Lezhi's claims. Because he didn't understand, he couldn't challenge it, so he could only offer a knowing smirk to convey that "everything is under control."

Seeing the Master's smile, Zhou Lezhi grew even more frightened and hurriedly added: "The Teacher has also taught me about the administrative successes and failures of past dynasties, and he also said..." At this point, he felt it might be inappropriate and shut his mouth.

"Also said what?" Wang Yehao pressed.

"The successes and failures of this Dynasty..." Zhou Lezhi stammered. "His words are mostly arrogant and contrary; this humble one dares not repeat them."

This actually didn't exceed Master Wang's expectations. Given the man's precise predictions about the court situation, it was only natural that he would make incisive comments on court politics.

"What did he say?" Wang Yehao softened his tone. "Just speak freely—only you and I are here."

"He said, he said: Although the Great Ancestor of this Dynasty drove out the Tartars and restored China, in reality, except for clothing and writing, the old institutions of the Tang and Song were all forgotten; instead, many evil policies of the Jin and Yuan were inherited..."

Wang Yehao listened to his disjointed account and was secretly surprised. Although these remarks were mostly fragmentary and unstructured, with some points biased or absurd, many of the criticisms were things he himself had contemplated or heard others mention when reading in the past.

"Although arrogant and contrary, they don't lack penetrating insight." Wang Yehao said, "After you return, write all of this down and submit it to me every month."

"Yes."

"Study diligently. In the future, his mantle shall be yours."

"Thank you, Master, for your cultivation!" Zhou Lezhi was startled, then delighted.

After sending Zhou Lezhi away, Wang Yehao issued instructions to Liu Sha: "Travel quickly to Guangzhou Prefecture. Investigate the background of this 'Purple Treasure Studio' and the Australians."

"Your subordinate departs tomorrow." After accepting the item, Liu Sha asked with some hesitation, "But why didn't the Master send Liu Zhao or Zhou Lezhi? After all, they're more familiar with the area."

"They must keep watch on Hearthstone; we can't allow him to become suspicious."

"Master, your subordinate knows I shouldn't ask what isn't my concern, but just how capable is this Mr. Zhou that he requires such careful guarding?"

"Is the Daoist Master eyeing his house with envy?" A trace of a smile appeared at the corner of Wang Yehao's mouth, but it sent a chill down Liu Sha's back.

"Your subordinate dares not." Liu Sha hastily denied.

"Has the Daoist Master read *A New Account of the Tales of the World* [*Shi Shuo Xin Yu*]?"

"Forgive your subordinate's ignorance; I have not read it."

Wang Yehao rose and walked to the bookshelf, rummaging for a moment before extracting one volume. He opened it and read in an unhurried voice: "Wei Wu [Cao Cao] had a singing girl. Her voice was the most pure and high, but her temperament was cruel and evil. Wanting to kill her, he loved her talent; wanting to keep her, he couldn't stand her. So he selected a hundred people to be taught at the same time. After a short time, there was another person whose voice matched hers, so he killed the one with evil nature."

After reading this passage, Wang Yehao pulled a previously copied page from the desk drawer and handed it to Liu Sha. "On this trip to *Guangli*, seek learned men everywhere along the way. If you can find someone who can decode this talismanic script, this Official won't need that Rough Stock anymore."
