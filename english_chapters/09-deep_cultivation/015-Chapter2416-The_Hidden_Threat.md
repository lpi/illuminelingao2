# Chapter 2416: The Hidden Threat

"What's there to say about crying in the graveyard—his father died, isn't he allowed to cry a few times? Did anyone hear what they said?" Chen Xuan said impatiently.

"They did hear some, but..." Lai Xiao hesitated, because this Chen Yue was actually the master's own daughter.

"Hmph, you don't need to say it—I know too. This little slu—" Chen Xuan swallowed back the words "little slut." After all, this child was his own flesh and blood. Even if she didn't acknowledge him as her father, cursing her would also be cursing himself. "What did they say?"

"The person I sent didn't dare get too close. They only roughly heard them talking about the master holding power in the village, and also said something about driving away some 'Third Uncle'..."

"That's all?"

"That's all."

Chen Xuan thought this was also to be expected. He had some understanding of this nephew. The boy had been a rule-following child since he was young, not one who could scheme or plot. He could still handle him.

"From now on, send more people to watch him closely—him, Little Yue, and Chen Qing's family. Whatever they do, you must tell me. Understand?"

"This small one understands!"

"What about the matter I told you to watch the Australians?"

Lai Xiao was so scared he shivered and quickly said: "Master, everything else is fine, but why provoke these Australian lords! These people are extremely careful. If they see through us, won't that be greatly disadvantageous to you..."

"Look at you, you seem particularly afraid of Australians." Chen Xuan smiled slowly.

Lai Xiao only felt his scalp go numb and quickly explained: "I've heard that the Australians' surveillance is the strictest. Whether in Lingao or Guangzhou, even the smallest thing, as long as they set their minds on knowing it, they'll know! Master, you just do your job for the Australians. Why know too much..."

"What a loyal and sincere heart you have!" Chen Xuan didn't know why this Chou Scabby Head was so afraid of Australians and scolded: "I do my job for the Australians, true. But in the matters below... hm? How many people are dissatisfied? Not to mention anything else—just the things you've done in the village, if someone were to tell the female... Chief about them, what do you think the Chief would think of you?"

"The Australians still rely on us to do things..."

"True that they want us to do things, but we also have to guard against birds being killed and bows being put away, rabbits dying and dogs being cooked!" Chen Xuan rubbed his forehead. "You have to help keep more eyes open! Especially now that Chen Lin has gone to the factory—we must be on guard."

"Yes, Master." Lai Xiao said helplessly. "I'll tell the people in the factory to watch a bit more..."

Chen Xuan felt some irritation in his heart. He asked again: "In a few days, send someone else to Sanliang. You must find out Chen Ding's whereabouts!"

Chen Ding was the "Third Uncle" in Chen Lin's mouth, the youngest of the three brothers. Although he couldn't be called clever, he was upright, fierce in character, gallant and ready to help others. He was very respected among both clansmen and villagers. If not for relying on the Australians' intimidation back then, he really couldn't have driven away this third brother.

He had originally wanted to label the third brother as a "Ming Dynasty remnant" and have the Australians eliminate this hidden threat for him. But the Australians said they couldn't see any connection between him and the Great Ming. In the end, it was only because Third Brother stubbornly refused to hand over the village's clan field account books and maps that he was labeled a "clan faction element" and driven away.

But although Chen Ding wasn't in the village, he was still very worried about this third brother staging a comeback. He knew very well Third Brother's abilities. Such a gallant and righteous upright gentleman would attract attention wherever he went. If the Australians were recruiting right now and Third Brother were recruited by them...

For this reason, he had sent several batches of people to Sanliang Market. However, the people sent back reported that although Chen Ding's wife and children were all there, he himself wasn't at his father-in-law's house. Moreover, they couldn't find out where he had gone.

This became a matter weighing on Chen Xuan's heart.

"I'll send someone to Sanliang again tomorrow," Lai Xiao hesitated and said. "Master, if you really must find Master Ding's whereabouts, you probably can't find it in Sanliang..."

"Why do you say that?"

"He must have left Sanliang and gone somewhere, entrusting his wife and children to his father-in-law," Lai Xiao said. "How can we find him if we go to Sanliang?"

"The world is so big. If we don't look in Sanliang, where else should we look?" Chen Xuan said. "He couldn't have vanished into thin air. He must have left some instructions."

"In this small one's view, the most likely place Master Ding went is Guangzhou!"

"Hm?" Chen Xuan suddenly became energized. "Why do you say that?"

"Master, think about it. Young Master Lin was in Guangzhou—Master Ding knew that. But Young Master Lin returning to Nansha, he doesn't know." Lai Xiao said, "He can do nothing about you in Sanliang, so the only option is to go find his nephew to discuss countermeasures."

Chen Xuan nodded repeatedly. Although Chou Scabby Head was unremarkable in appearance, when analyzing problems, he was indeed logical. How did he not think of this!

"Now Young Master Lin is already in master's palm. The most worrisome thing is if Master Ding went to Guangzhou and came up empty. He probably won't give up easily. He might find connections and seek relationships in Guangzhou. After all, the place with the most Real Short-hairs now is Guangzhou..."

Chen Xuan slapped his thigh: "You're right! Why didn't I think of this key point!" He thought for a moment. They had no close relatives in Guangzhou city, but there were a few distant relatives. When Chen Lin went to Guangzhou, he sought out Chen Xuan's cousin Wu Yijun.

Quite possibly Third Brother had also gone to the Wu family!

"How about you make a trip to Guangzhou..." He looked at Lai Xiao.

Lai Xiao almost scared his soul away: he had just gotten out of that tiger and wolf den, how could he go back! He somewhat regretted his "offering of a plan" and quickly said: "It's not appropriate for this small one to go. It must be someone who recognizes Master Ding and is familiar with the ins and outs of Guangzhou—and needs to have some status too."

Chen Xuan's gaze turned on Lai Xiao. This Scabby Head showed fear as soon as Guangzhou was mentioned—he probably had some unspeakable past in Guangzhou city, and most likely had a murder case on his hands too.

*Also good. With Scabby Head having a stain on him, handling him will be easier.*

But if he didn't go, who should go?

Chen Xuan pondered for a moment and thought of someone. This person was surnamed Han, named Changfu. He was originally an accountant in the clan. Because of improper conduct—falsifying accounts and embezzling money—he had been dismissed after repeated offenses.

After being dismissed, Han Changfu still hung around Nansha. He was also a second-rate loafer type, so he was quite familiar with Chen Xuan.

This Han Changfu had a blood brother who was also a local ruffian and had always done business in Guangzhou. The two brothers used to interact frequently, so he was very familiar with the situation in Guangzhou and had a local strongman to help him. He was the best candidate to go to Guangzhou.

"Go get Han Changfu."

After the person was called, Chen Xuan explained the matter to him: "You must find out Chen Ding's whereabouts!"

"Master, finding someone isn't hard. As long as he's in Guangzhou, we'll definitely find him," Han Changfu said. "After finding him, what then?"

"After finding him, find a few people and tie him up and bring him back to me!" Chen Xuan said viciously.

"This small one understands!" Han Changfu said. "Only, you need to give me a few more people."

"Isn't your big brother in the Guandi Temple gang? Give him some money, and won't he take care of it for you?"

Lai Xiao quickly said: "Master, that won't do! The Guandi Temple gang has already been wiped out by the Australians. It's not easy to find people to do dirty work. And the Australians have many eyes and ears inside and outside the city. I'm afraid it would be bringing fire upon ourselves!"

Once the people sent were caught and fell into the Australians' hands, they'd spill everything like beans from a bamboo tube. Kidnapping was a serious crime whether under Great Ming or Australian rule. Once implicated, that would be catching everyone in one net.

Chen Xuan thought about it—true. Openly sending people to kidnap someone in Guangzhou city was really not giving the Australians face.

Han Changfu calculated for a moment and said: "I do have a method."

"What method?"

"Since he's hiding outside and won't come back, we'll think of a way to make him come back himself!" Han Changfu was full of crafty ideas. "Hasn't Young Master Lin come back? We'll use Young Master Lin as bait to lure him back!"

"Brother Han's plan is good. Even if Master Ding won't return to Nansha, we can trick him to another place. As long as he leaves Guangzhou city, it'll be easy!" Lai Xiao quickly flattered.

"Good! Let's do it this way!" Chen Xuan's face reddened with excitement. "You two are truly my left and right arms!" Saying this, he slapped both their shoulders hard.

Lai Xiao secretly grumbled—*Being left and right arms is useless; not a single extra coin of silver*—and turned his face just meeting Han Changfu's gaze. The two immediately understood each other: thinking the same!

Han Changfu said: "That's all well and good, but whether Master Ding is in Guangzhou is still uncertain. I'm afraid it'll take a while to find out."

"I'll give you three months. You investigate in Guangzhou for me until you find out clearly." Saying this, Chen Xuan took out a pair of tally tokens. "Go to the accounting room and draw ten taels of silver for travel expenses. Pick two reliable people to go with you. If the matter is handled well, there will be generous rewards when you return!"

Han Changfu thought: *I believe you—you ghost!* Three people going to Guangzhou for three months on only ten taels of silver! As travel expenses and living expenses, it wasn't a small amount, but this wouldn't be easy to accomplish, as money was needed everywhere. Although Han Changle was his big brother, he couldn't use him for free.

Fortunately, Guangzhou was a glamorous world. Now with money and people and his big brother there, maybe he could take this opportunity to score a big haul. This trip wouldn't be a loss.

Chen Lin had spent almost the entire day at Fenshenghe, following Li Yao'er and Shen Su through every corner of the renovated Fenshenghe.

Since he was determined to gain Li Yao'er's trust, he naturally had to put his heart and soul into the silk factory. Every place, every process, every piece of equipment—if he didn't recognize or understand something, he asked to understand it clearly. He could speak of the pros and cons one by one. This made Li Yao'er and her student look at him with new eyes: this young factory owner wasn't just a decorative pillow after all!

After the tour, they returned to the office in the front courtyard. It was already noon. Li Yao'er said: "Since you're here, today counts as your first day of work. Eat lunch here and then go back to rest."

"This..." Chen Lin actually did want to eat here, but eating with two young women like this seemed too wild and improper...
