# Chapter 2637: Folangji Rapid Gun

Zhang Xiao's inspection of Nanhai County came to a section end. Returning to Guangzhou City, although Foshan couldn't be County Seat for now, as his first step of launching work in Nanhai, leaving Guangzhou City was a must. Dealing with Municipal Government and a pile of Provincial Organs in Guangzhou City was extremely troublesome. And also had problem of jurisdiction.

Regarding this problem, he communicated with Liu Xiang. Liu Xiang also approved his view, and expressed future Foshan Town was the most ideal County Seat location of Nanhai County Government. But temporarily could only overcome it first.

After discussing with subordinates, for this location of temporary Nanhai County Seat, he selected three places, respectively Dali, Shishan and Qiandenghu. Finally after comprehensive consideration, he selected Dali as temporary station of New County Seat.

Fortunately it was just station relocation, not involving complex works like building county city wall. And currently he wouldn't take all Nanhai County team away either, because many Local Cadres' homes were in Guangzhou Urban Area and suburbs. Letting them follow to Dali not only increased relocation cost, their work experience was also mostly urban. So after prudent consideration, decided to only take away a part of Nanhai County Government personnel. Remaining personnel directly enriched into Guangzhou Municipal Government. Speaking of current cadre configuration, Guangzhou City no longer set up districts separately, to reduce hierarchy, simplifying institutions. Station of Panyu County would also move to Shiqiao on a selected day.

Busy finishing Autumn Harvest, farmers finally could stretch a lazy waist, slightly relax a bit. Children mostly also could run crazily in village with smile hanging on face, no need to worry about parents' scolding. Some impatient families in village also drifted out fragrance of New Rice. Neighbors smelling fragrance, were somewhat envious, but also couldn't help despising a few sentences saying words like not knowing to cherish blessings.

Some days ago, a small boat came to Xiaoyao Market. People coming on this small boat once making Golden Pig (*Jin Zhu*) uneasy were indeed "Kun People," however, were not some cadres going down to countryside, but Kun people's opera troupe.

Australians' opera troupe was coming to Li Family Enclosure for the first time. But before this, they often appeared on markets. Also came to Xiaoyao Market. So this kind of Improved Puppet Show adopting later Cantonese Opera singing style was not considered fresh matter locally anymore.

Australians' Puppet Troupe then borrowed house in village's Earth Grain Temple (*Tu Gu Ci*) to live. Built up cloth curtain on threshing ground already emptied out. Erected tents, placing opera chests, started singing opera.

Rural areas had extremely few entertainment activities. Whether Opera Troupe, Song Singing, Playing Ten Fan (*Da Shi Fan*), Running Horse Selling Art (*Pao Ma Mai Jie* - Acrobats)... all sought business on markets. If not village inviting, they wouldn't come to run pier in village. In Li Family Enclosure only when big households had happy events would invite them to perform. Otherwise just singing opera to reward gods during God Festivals.

Now Autumn Harvest just ended, farmers' hands wide (money available), farm work also not much. Since fresh gadget "Lingao Puppet Show" came to perform, everyone was happy to watch a lively scene, removing fatigue resolving boredom. Opera Troupe performed two shows a day, one afternoon, one evening. Singing tune good to listen, story also compact interesting, ups and downs. Old and young all loved listening. Every show could hit out quite some money.

Just once this Opera Troupe came, originally extremely active Eight Immortals Society in village instantly extinguished fire. Originally after harvesting paddy, Headmen of Eight Immortals Society led villagers to practice Kung Fu together. Whoever entered Society, in Li Surnamed Public Granary had another subsidy. Other villages also came one after another to invite Headmen to set up altar in their villages. Just originally those slogans about "Kun Thieves" momentarily all changed to "Demon People"—everyone also knew who it referred to. Occasionally some people shouted wrong when practicing, Headmen didn't scold much either.

Now, practicing Kung Fu in whole Li Family Enclosure all disappeared trace. Who didn't know this Australians' Opera Troupe was eating Kun Thieves' ration! If having any abnormality, going back to report to official, this Li Family Enclosure would eat unable to pocket and go (bear unbearable consequences). Not only public practicing gone, even Fairy Aunt God Altar (*Xian Gu Shen Tan*) where Golden Pig's wife often went to cultivate magic also didn't open. Anxious Lian Niang stamped feet straightly. She already gifted Fairy Aunt one Yuan, agreed to cultivate magic for seven seven forty nine days continuously, taking incense ash for forty nine days. Just this less than twenty days interrupted, then had to start cultivating magic from head—this needed one Yuan again!

This one Yuan was offered to Fairy Aunt by her hiding from Golden Pig. Originally hoped cultivating magic could conceive child, taking advantage of happy news to inform Golden Pig. Now not pregnant yet, one Yuan drifted on water (wasted). Also didn't know where to find another one Yuan again!

On small pier of Li Family Enclosure came another boat. Second Butler already waiting on pier, first bowed to Luo Hetu escorting boat, then commanded people, moving down several boxes from boat, carrying and shouldering, walking towards Li family.

Not walking a few steps, saw a group of children, chanting nursery rhymes while playing, running past front of this group of people. Luo Hetu stopped step temporarily to let pass these children. Listening to nursery rhymes, couldn't help shaking head laughing low. He just left for a few days, this Walrus Monk edited out another nursery rhyme again. This person reading book not successful, crooked talent in belly was quite a lot.

Second Butler commanded long-term workers servants carrying loads, going towards village. Luo Hetu walked for a while suddenly asked: "Why detoured road?"

Second Butler knew Luo Hetu now was important Guest Minister in Master's home, immediately said in low voice: "Second Master Luo you don't know, village recently came a gang of Kun Thieves..."

Immediately said matter of Puppet Troupe coming to perform once. Luo Hetu frowned saying: "This is troublesome. This gang of play-acting False Kuns most expert in bewitching people's hearts. This let it be, still are all Kun Thieves' spies. If discovered something by them..."

Second Butler said: "Master already sent people to nearby to invite Opera Troupe to sing Temple Festival Opera (*She Xi*). Said not afraid spending money, invite best troupe, sing rival opera against them, forcing them away to finish matter."

Luo Hetu thought in heart this was also a method. Autumn Grain came on market; this year was Wind Tune Rain Smooth again; various villages originally wanted to sing opera rewarding gods. Wouldn't arouse False Kuns' suspicion.

Second Butler continued saying: "Master said, this is also lifting heart spirit for big guys. Opera Troupe arrives tomorrow! Arrived small one notify them a sound, leave a good seat for you." Finished speaking revealing lewd look, "Heard among them several men women, all grow good appearance, are most romantic agreeable people..."

Luo Hetu originally was one loving lively. This kind of Opera Troupe running piers usually also had prostitution business. This opera naturally wanted to come watch.

Arrived inside Li Family Courtyard, Li Guangyuan and Luo Heying waited here long ago. Seeing Luo Hetu and others arrival, immediately ordered Inner Residence Family Soldiers to receive loads, sending to Inner Residence.

A side courtyard in quiet place of Inner Residence, now was "Headquarters" they planned. Including Walrus Monk and Eight Immortals Society high levels, just lived here. Ordinary days discussed matters here.

Arrived in Main Room, sent away Family Soldiers, Li Guangyuan even could not care about politeness, ordered subordinate trusted aide to open box.

Inside three long strip boxes each loaded five brand new Folangji Rapid Guns. Li Guangyuan rushed step forward, first took out a rapid gun. This gun long about four *chi* (1.28m), weighed about ten *jin* (6kg) around. Tearing off gun cloth wrapped with oil paper, saw shining gun barrel, log original color gun body. Li Guangyuan also didn't care heavy grease smeared on gun, holding rapid gun in hand looking back and forth efficiently. Other two boxes were one thousand gun bullets and matching gunpowder and percussion caps. These five boxes cost Li Guangyuan two hundred taels silver. For him such a countryside Local Moneybag, was not a small number.

Putting rapid gun back into box, wiped hand with handkerchief again. Li Guangyuan only then greeted Luo Hetu, thanking him for not declining hardship escorting all the way.

Luo Hetu just now was staring at Li Guangyuan continuously. Heart couldn't stop slandering Master Li too stingy. Initially after seeing Folangji Rapid Gun brought by himself loving it not releasing hand. Later bridging by Luo Heying, getting online with seller in Min Region (Fujian), once hearing quote then unwilling to buy again. Later Luo Heying went to negotiate personally, talked thoroughly with Li Guangyuan for several times, only then bought fifteen rapid guns, one thousand bullets. Just seller hand also didn't have much existing goods. If wanting more, could only pay deposit first, waiting for several months to transport from Luzon. Li Guangyuan was a master not seeing rabbit not releasing hawk, just asked about when Foreign Ship could send Folangji Rapid Guns again, at that time contact again.

In Luo Hetu's eyes, having these rapid guns was much more useful than Eight Immortals Society's "Magic Arts." Speaking plainly, ignorant rural men coerced up by magic arts were no more than creating a momentum. Truly encountering Australians' fast guns bird guns still would be collapsing into army.

So-called Opening Altar Cultivating Magic, nothing more than enhancing determination of these big households "Return to Righteousness." As long as momentum created up, coming afire everywhere, no matter how powerful Kun Thieves' firearms, also couldn't look after four sides. They then had chance.

This rapid gun was truly useful gadget. This rapid gun training convenient, more than a month could form army. Waiting until arising matters, Li Guangyuan these real estate money goods instead of cheapening Kun Thieves or turning into ashes, might as well exchange some more rapid guns, pulling up a team looking like model looking like sample. Fighting a field with Kun Thieves well, perhaps still had living path.

Just these true words couldn't be said. Said then no one willing to follow doing.

Only heard Li Guangyuan continuing saying: "Worthy Brother rest for a few days first. These few days village just conducting Temple Festival Opera. After Temple Festival Opera still need to trouble you to drill some sturdy men in my village. All are Li Surnamed descendants I selected carefully. Please Worthy Brother Lin spend more heart, let them learn manipulation method of this rapid gun." Saying, let Butler send up a Thanking Gift as hard work fee.

Luo Hetu said thanks, followed Second Butler exiting Manor Courtyard first. Servants also moved boxes into warehouse of backyard. in room only left Luo Heying and Li Guangyuan.

Luo Heying only then leaned forward, saying to Li Guangyuan: "Having this rapid gun, Brother Li can be peaceful some right."

Since Kun soldiers stationed into Xiaoyao Market, Li Guangyuan was somewhat apprehensive. Afraid which day Kun Thieves would cannon hit Li Family Enclosure, swinging himself on swing. Towards matter of organizing militia resisting Kun, also many times wanted to reverse. Until one day seeing Eight Immortals Society's Fairy applied talisman water, letting his several family soldiers drank then unexpectedly could fish copper coins from oil pot with bare hands. Li Guangyuan examined family soldiers' arms repeatedly, no abnormality, only then truly believed Eight Immortals Society's magic arts.
