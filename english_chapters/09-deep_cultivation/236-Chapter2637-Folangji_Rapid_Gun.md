# Chapter 2637: Folangji Rapid Gun

Zhang Xiao's inspection of Nanhai County had reached a natural stopping point. Though he was returning to Guangzhou City for now, Foshan couldn't yet serve as the county seat—but as his first step in launching work in Nanhai, leaving Guangzhou was essential. Dealing with the Municipal Government and the sprawling mess of Provincial Organs there had proven extremely troublesome, not to mention the jurisdictional headaches.

He had discussed this problem with Liu Xiang, who agreed with his assessment. They both concluded that Foshan Town would eventually be the ideal location for the Nanhai County Government, but for now they would simply have to make do.

After consulting with his subordinates, Zhang Xiao identified three candidates for the temporary county seat: Dali, Shishan, and Qiandenghu. After weighing all factors, he selected Dali.

Fortunately, this was merely a station relocation rather than the complex undertaking of building city walls. And he wouldn't be taking the entire Nanhai County team with him—many of the Local Cadres had homes in Guangzhou's urban area and suburbs. Relocating them to Dali would not only increase costs, but their expertise lay primarily in urban matters. After careful consideration, he decided to bring only a portion of the county government personnel, while the remainder would be absorbed into the Guangzhou Municipal Government. As for the current cadre configuration, Guangzhou City would no longer maintain separate districts, reducing hierarchy and simplifying institutions. Panyu County's station would also relocate to Shiqiao on a designated date.

With the autumn harvest finally behind them, the farmers could stretch their backs and breathe a little easier. Children ran wild through the villages, smiles plastered across their faces, no longer fearing their parents' scolding. Already, the fragrance of new rice drifted from the kitchens of the more impatient families. Neighbors who caught the scent couldn't help feeling a twinge of envy, though they also clicked their tongues disapprovingly—"Some people just don't know how to appreciate their blessings."

A few days earlier, a small boat had arrived at Xiaoyao Market. The passengers who'd once made Golden Pig (*Jin Zhu*) so uneasy were indeed "Kun People," but these weren't cadres conducting rural inspections—they were members of an Australian opera troupe.

This was the Australians' first time bringing their troupe to Li Family Enclosure, though they'd frequently appeared at the local markets, including Xiaoyao. Their style of improved puppet show, which adopted the later Cantonese Opera singing conventions, was no longer a novelty in these parts.

The puppet troupe took up residence in the village's Earth Grain Temple (*Tu Gu Ci*), borrowing space there. On the threshing ground, now emptied after the harvest, they erected cloth curtains and tents, arranged their opera chests, and began their performances.

Entertainment was scarce in rural areas. Whether opera troupes, singers, Ten Fan musicians (*Da Shi Fan*), or traveling acrobats (*Pao Ma Mai Jie*)—all made their living at the markets. They wouldn't venture into a village unless invited, and in Li Family Enclosure, such performers only appeared when wealthy households celebrated auspicious occasions, or during God Festivals when opera was sung to honor the deities.

Now, with the autumn harvest just concluded, the farmers had money in hand and little work to keep them busy. Since this novelty called "Lingao Puppet Show" had come to perform, everyone was eager for the spectacle—a chance to shake off their weariness and relieve their boredom. The troupe performed twice daily, once in the afternoon and once in the evening. The melodies were pleasant, the stories tightly woven and full of twists and turns. Young and old alike loved it, and each performance drew a healthy take.

Yet the troupe's arrival had an immediate effect on the Eight Immortals Society, which had been flourishing in the village. Just after the paddy harvest, the Society's Headmen had been leading villagers in martial arts practice. Anyone who joined received an additional subsidy from the Li Surname Public Granary. Neighboring villages had sent invitations for the Headmen to establish altars in their communities as well. The original slogans denouncing "Kun Thieves" had quietly shifted to "Demon People"—everyone understood whom the term meant. When someone accidentally shouted the old phrase during practice, the Headmen didn't make a fuss.

But now, all trace of martial arts practice in Li Family Enclosure had vanished. Everyone knew this Australian opera troupe was eating from the Kun Thieves' bowl. Any hint of suspicious activity, and they'd report back to the authorities—then the whole village would face consequences they couldn't swallow. Not only had the public training ceased, but even the Fairy Aunt God Altar (*Xian Gu Shen Tan*), where Golden Pig's wife Lian Niang often went to cultivate magic, had stopped operating.

Lian Niang was beside herself, stamping her feet in frustration. She had already given Fairy Aunt one yuan, agreeing to cultivate magic for seven times seven—forty-nine continuous days—and collect the incense ash for the same period. But now, with fewer than twenty days completed, the ritual had been interrupted. She would have to start the cultivation from the beginning, which meant another yuan!

That yuan had been offered to Fairy Aunt in secret, hidden from Golden Pig. She had hoped the magic would help her conceive, planning to surprise him with happy news. But now she wasn't pregnant, and the money had drifted away like water. Where would she find another yuan?

Another boat arrived at Li Family Enclosure's small pier. Second Butler was already waiting on the dock. He bowed first to Luo Hetu, who had escorted the cargo, then directed the workers to unload several boxes from the boat. Carrying and shouldering their loads, the group set off toward the Li family compound.

They hadn't gone far when a pack of children came running past, chanting nursery rhymes as they played. Luo Hetu paused to let them pass. Listening to the rhyme, he shook his head and chuckled softly. He'd only been gone a few days, and that Walrus Monk had composed yet another ditty. The man had never succeeded at proper scholarship, but he certainly had a talent for mischief.

Second Butler led the servants and laborers toward the village. After a while, Luo Hetu suddenly asked, "Why are we taking the long way?"

Second Butler knew that Luo Hetu had become an important Guest Minister in the Master's household, so he lowered his voice. "Second Master Luo, you haven't heard—a gang of Kun Thieves recently arrived in the village..."

He quickly explained about the puppet troupe. Luo Hetu frowned. "That's troublesome. These play-acting False Kuns are experts at bewitching people's hearts. And worse still, they're all spies for the Kun Thieves. If they discover anything..."

"The Master has already sent people to invite an opera troupe from nearby to perform Temple Festival Opera (*She Xi*)," Second Butler assured him. "Said he's not worried about the expense—hire the best troupe available and stage rival performances until we drive them away."

Luo Hetu considered this. It was a reasonable approach. Autumn grain had come to market, and this year's weather had been favorable. Villages would naturally want to stage opera to thank the gods. The plan wouldn't arouse the False Kuns' suspicions.

Second Butler continued, "The Master says it'll also lift everyone's spirits. The troupe arrives tomorrow! When they get here, I'll let them know to save you a good seat." His expression turned knowing. "I hear they've got several men and women among them—all good-looking, the most romantic and agreeable sort of people..."

Luo Hetu had always enjoyed lively entertainment. Opera troupes that traveled the circuit usually offered other services on the side as well. He would certainly come to watch.

When they arrived at the Li Family Courtyard, Li Guangyuan and Luo Heying were already waiting. The moment Luo Hetu's group appeared, Li Guangyuan ordered the Inner Residence Family Soldiers to receive the loads and carry them inside.

A side courtyard in a secluded corner of the Inner Residence now served as their "Headquarters." This was where they planned their operations, and where Walrus Monk and the Eight Immortals Society's leadership resided. Day-to-day discussions took place here.

Once they reached the Main Room and dismissed the Family Soldiers, Li Guangyuan couldn't contain himself. He immediately ordered a trusted subordinate to open the boxes.

Each of the three long wooden cases contained five brand-new Folangji Rapid Guns. Li Guangyuan rushed forward and seized one. The weapon was about four *chi* long—roughly a meter and a quarter—and weighed around ten *jin*, about six kilograms. He tore off the oiled paper and gun cloth, revealing the gleaming barrel and the natural wood of the stock. Heedless of the heavy grease coating the weapon, he turned it over in his hands, examining it from every angle. The other two boxes contained a thousand bullets and the matching gunpowder and percussion caps. Together, the five crates had cost Li Guangyuan two hundred taels of silver—no small sum, even for a countryside moneybag like himself.

Finally setting the rapid gun back in its case, he wiped his hands with a handkerchief. Only then did he properly greet Luo Hetu, thanking him for undertaking the hardship of escorting the cargo.

Luo Hetu had been watching Li Guangyuan the entire time, silently scoffing at the man's stinginess. When he'd first shown Li Guangyuan the Folangji Rapid Gun, the man had been utterly smitten, refusing to let it go. Later, after Luo Heying had brokered a connection with a seller in Min Region (Fujian), Li Guangyuan had balked the moment he heard the price. It had taken several rounds of personal negotiations by Luo Heying before Li Guangyuan finally agreed to purchase fifteen rapid guns and a thousand bullets. Even then, the seller's stock was limited—if they wanted more, they'd have to pay a deposit and wait months for the next shipment from Luzon. But Li Guangyuan was the sort who wouldn't release the hawk until he saw the rabbit. He simply asked when the Foreign Ship might bring more Folangji Rapid Guns, and said they'd be in touch then.

In Luo Hetu's view, these rapid guns were far more useful than the Eight Immortals Society's "Magic Arts." To put it plainly, ignorant rural men coerced through magic were merely good for creating a spectacle. The moment they actually faced the Australians' fast guns and bird guns, they'd rout completely.

All this business of Opening Altars and Cultivating Magic—it was really just about strengthening the resolve of the wealthy households to "Return to Righteousness." As long as they could build sufficient momentum and spark fires everywhere, even the Kun Thieves' formidable firearms couldn't cover all fronts. That would be their opportunity.

The rapid guns were the genuinely useful tools. Training with them was straightforward—in little more than a month, you could form an army. When matters came to a head, rather than letting Li Guangyuan's property and wealth fall into Kun Thief hands or turn to ashes, better to convert it into more rapid guns and raise a proper fighting force. If they could hold their own against the Kun Thieves in the field, there might yet be a path to survival.

But these truths couldn't be spoken aloud. Say them, and no one would follow.

Li Guangyuan continued, "Rest for a few days first, Worthy Brother. The village is holding Temple Festival Opera these next several days. After that, I'll need to trouble you to drill some of our sturdy young men. I've carefully selected them—all descendants of the Li surname. Please take extra care, Worthy Brother Lin, and teach them how to handle these rapid guns." He gestured for the Butler to present a gift as payment for Luo Hetu's efforts.

Luo Hetu expressed his thanks and followed Second Butler out of the Manor Courtyard. The servants moved the boxes into the backyard warehouse, leaving only Luo Heying and Li Guangyuan in the room.

Only then did Luo Heying lean forward. "With these rapid guns in hand, Brother Li, you must feel more at ease."

Ever since Kun soldiers had stationed themselves at Xiaoyao Market, Li Guangyuan had been on edge—afraid that one day the Kun Thieves would turn their cannons on Li Family Enclosure and hang him from a gibbet. He'd wavered repeatedly on the matter of organizing militia to resist the Kun. Then came the day he witnessed one of the Eight Immortals Society's Fairies apply talisman water. After drinking it, several of his family soldiers had plucked copper coins from a pot of boiling oil with their bare hands. Li Guangyuan had examined their arms over and over, finding no sign of injury. Only then did he truly believe in the Eight Immortals Society's magic arts.
