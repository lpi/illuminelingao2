# Chapter 2601: Escaping the Tiger's Mouth

On this day, Yuan Shuzhi was continuing his great auditing work. In the past few days, he hadn't seen Daoist Wood Stone much, nor had he seen Quan Youde again. Even Steward Gao, who used to show his face daily, was gone. The servants delivering meals had changed to strangers. The two servants guarding the courtyard gate, whom Yuan Shuzhi had become quite familiar with, had suddenly changed to strangers too, with faces full of ferocity.

He knew this was a very dangerous signal. The successive disappearances of the principals indicated that this place was considered unsafe. That he was left in this unsafe place meant he wasn't an important figure. Since that was the case, once there was a danger of the location being exposed, the fate of a non-core figure like him who "knew too much" would be only one: to be silenced.

Yuan Shuzhi was anxious and fearful but dared not show it. He could only observe secretly every day to see if there was a chance to escape. Although he didn't know the paths in the mountains even if he escaped the farm estate, it was better than waiting for death here in fear.

After finishing the account book, Yuan Shuzhi breathed a sight of relief. He wrapped up the account book, put it in the basket, and carried it out. Every time account books were delivered or taken away, they were put in a basket like this and handed over at the courtyard gate.

Unexpectedly, when he delivered it to the courtyard gate, no new account books were sent. Yuan Shuzhi was stunned.

"No new account books sent over today?" he asked.

"If there aren't any, there aren't any. How would we know?" the gatekeeper said viciously, his eyes full of undisguised contempt.

Yuan Shuzhi screamed *not good* in his heart, but facing the obstinate gatekeeper and knowing nothing about the situation outside, he could only retreat submissively.

*The only plan now is to escape for my life as soon as possible!* Yuan Shuzhi thought. The absence of new account books was an extremely dangerous signal, indicating that his utility was about to run out, and being silenced was imminent!

Just as he was pondering how to escape, Steward Gao, who hadn't been seen for many days, appeared.

"Mr. Shu, how have you been?"

Seeing Steward Gao's gloomy and smileless face, the hair on Yuan Shuzhi's back stood up. He forced himself to be calm and said, "Thanks to Steward Gao's blessing, my body is still healthy."

" I am instructed by my master to move Mr. Shu to another place today," Steward Gao said. "Please pack up, Mister; we will get on the road as soon as possible."

Hearing the phrase "get on the road," Yuan Shuzhi felt like he was struck by five thunderbolts. He thought, "*My life is over!*"

However, with Steward Gao and several ferocious-looking servants present, what could a powerless scholar like him do? He had to submit obediently. He went back to the room and packed his clothes and money properly. He smiled bitterly to himself: *I wonder who will benefit from these things in the end!*

After packing, a sedan chair was already waiting outside. Yuan Shuzhi got into the sedan chair and could only leave his fate to heaven.

At this time, it was already getting dark outside. As the sedan chair and the group walked along the mountain road, hearing the night owls screeching and the mountain wind howling outside the sedan, Yuan Shuzhi's heart was in turmoil. He wanted to lift the curtain to see the outside, but found that the curtain had been fastened shut. This made him feel even more desperate.

After walking in darkness for who knows how long, the sedan chair finally stopped. He heard Steward Gao outside saying, "Everyone has worked hard these days. This is a reward from the Daoist. Twenty yuan for each person. Take it and go back to your respective homes. Do not mention old matters here again!"

He heard several people outside expressing thanks. Then he heard Steward Gao say, "The wine, meat, and dry rations are rewards from the Daoist for you. Take them to eat on the road. There is a ruined temple here. If anyone is worried about the difficulty of walking deep at night, you might as well rest here for a night and leave tomorrow. If you are in a hurry to travel, you can go now."

Wait until the footsteps and voices outside gradually faded away, and there was no sound outside for a long time. Just as Yuan Shuzhi didn't know what to do, the sedan curtain was suddenly lifted. Steward Gao stood outside with a wooden face and said coldly, "We've arrived. Come out."

Yuan Shuzhi came out of the sedan chair and saw a small flat piece of land in the mountains. It was pitch black all around, and nothing could be seen clearly. By the moonlight, he could vaguely see a half-dilapidated building, probably an abandoned old temple.

Above the mountain ranges, a hook of a crescent moon hung high, obscured by clouds, looking indescribably blurry and eerie.

While Yuan Shuzhi was bewildered, Steward Gao said, "Mr. Shu, we have known each other for a while, and today our fate ends. The farm estate is not a place to stay for long. You have earned quite a lot of money in these few months, enough for expenses. Take the money and run for your own future."

Yuan Shuzhi looked stunned. He originally thought that after getting off the sedan chair, he would inevitably face swords and axes, and his life would end here in this wilderness. He didn't expect the other party to say such things.

If he was saying this to trick him, it seemed unnecessary. Having arrived here, he was already meat on the chopping block; why would Steward Gao need to act out such pretentiousness to tease him?

Yuan Shuzhi didn't know what to do at this moment, so he could only bow and say, "Many thanks, Steward Gao. I have been taken care of by you all these days. This student takes his leave."

After speaking, he carried the bundle on his back and was about to leave along the path he came. Steward Gao spoke again, "Do not take that road; take this one." After saying that, he pointed to a faintly discernable narrow path among the grass and trees. "Just walk along this road. Do not look back, and do not think about other paths; they are all dead ends!"

Yuan Shuzhi's heart was in his throat. He said tremblingly, "Student, student understands!"

Just as he lifted his foot to leave, he heard Steward Gao say grimly behind him: "The road is hard to travel; do not be burdened by worldly possessions!"

Yuan Shuzhi only wanted to flee for his life at this moment; how could he care about worldly possessions? He quickly dropped the bundle and left alone.

Walking along the deep grass-covered path, let alone the path, he couldn't even see the terrain clearly in the wilderness. Although he knew this small path had an unpredictable future and there might be life-claiming little ghosts waiting for him ahead, at this moment he could only brace himself and grope forward.

The mountain road was rugged and difficult. In some places, the path only allowed a single person to walk sideways and was very steep. In some places, the trail was completely obliterated by weeds and shrubs, and he could only find the way by the faint moonlight. Yuan Shuzhi walked and crawled, looking very wretched. Seeing that the crescent moon had passed the zenith, Yuan Shuzhi estimated that he had walked quite a distance before stopping to look back. He saw firelight six or seven *li* away, knowing it was mostly likely the ruined temple he had just seen. He felt even more fearful and dared not rest anymore, rolling and crawling along the road.

Finally walking until the sky turned slightly bright, seeing the mountain terrain becoming gentler, he knew he was about to leave the mountains. Although the journey was thrilling, no accidents happened, and he breathed a sigh of relief.

Turning past a mountain col, he saw a wild tea stall by the river beach not far away. His heart relaxed; he had finally reached a place with human habitation!

He had walked quickly all night, not feeling tired because of fear. Now arriving at a place with people, his whole body felt like it had lost strength, and he almost paralyzed on the ground.

After panting on the ground for a long time, after a night of toil, he felt hungry, thirsty, and aching all over. He got up and walked to the tea shed to sit down.

It was still early, but there were already tea guests in the shed. Yuan Shuzhi ignored everything else and called for the waiter.

Unexpectedly, the waiter didn't come, but the old man sitting in front turned around. Yuan Shuzhi couldn't help but be stunned: *Isn't this Old Man Gao who came to Huizhou on the same boat as me!*

Seeing it was him, Old Man Gao was full of joy, stood up, cupped his hands and said, "Mr. Shu, how have you been?"

"Good, good," Yuan Shuzhi was still in shock. Seeing Old Man Gao, whom he had met once, in this barren place, he felt very close to him and couldn't help saying, "I finally saved my life!"

After speaking, he realized he had misspoken. Old Man Gao didn't mind, whispering, "Mr. Shu has great fortune and is a lucky man. Although there is a tea shed here, it is not a place to stay for long. If Mister walks south along this river beach for more than ten *li*, it will be Boluo County Town."

Yuan Shuzhi was greatly surprised, wondering what Old Man Gao's background was.

Old Man Gao laughed loudly and said seriously, "Mr. Shu, although you and I only met once, we have the friendship of sharing a boat."

The implication was self-evident. Although Yuan Shuzhi didn't know the inside story, he roughly knew that escaping death this time was mostly due to this Old Man Gao's help.

Although he didn't know the details, he still had to thank him for saving his life. He hurriedly said, "Master Gao! Although I don't know the reasons within, yet..."

Old Man Gao waved his hand repeatedly and whispered, "I understand your feelings! And I accept them! No need for formalities. It's just that you shouldn't stay in Huizhou anymore. When you get to Boluo, do not linger; return to Guangzhou quickly." After saying that, he gave him a bundle. "This is dried food I prepared for you. Take it to eat on the road."

Yuan Shuzhi felt inexplicably grateful and hurriedly accepted the things. Only when he held it did he realize the bundle was heavy, seemingly containing silver. He didn't refuse either, saying, "Great kindness does not need words of thanks! This student will never forget Master Gao's kindness!"

After drinking a pot of tea, he hurriedly rushed to Boluo.

At this moment, his mind was full of question marks. The various things experienced from last night to this morning were like a strange dream. Steward Gao took them to the ruined temple, obviously to silence them, and the firelight at the ruined temple later seemed to prove this. For such a big matter as plotting rebellion, they certainly wouldn't let relevant personnel live.

But why did this Steward Gao let him go? This was a very risky thing; he might get silenced himself. Yet he actually saved him. Could it be intentional, acting on orders? What did the Daoist intend?

The strangest thing was this Old Man Gao. Although they had met once, it ended there; they couldn't even be called friends, let alone having any kindness between them. Yet this rescue seemed to involve him too.

Connecting the fact that both Steward Gao and Old Man Gao surnamed Gao... Yuan Shuzhi suddenly thought of this and was stunned.

Old Man Gao came to Huizhou from Guangzhou with him, and he also said he was a native of Huizhou. So, they were very likely family!

Although he couldn't figure out the other party's motive, since he had escaped, he should rush back to Boluo County Town as soon as possible and report the relevant situation to Lu Cheng. This gang was not only stealing drugs but also intending to rebel. If he could crack the case in time, it would be a great merit for him!
