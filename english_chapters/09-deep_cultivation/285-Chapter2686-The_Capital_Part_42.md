# Chapter 2686: The Capital (Part 42)

"What is difficult about this? Brother, I have my own ways to carry private contraband."

The two chatted happily until the wine shop closed, then dispersed separately. Early the next morning, Liu Sha took out a token begged from Wu Hai from the bottom of his luggage, then went out of Zhenhai Gate, heading straight for the Mao Family Inn.

Zhou Lezhi accompanied the Master all the way down south to Jiangnan, arriving in Dongyang. He spent this journey very comfortably. In order to rope in the relationship with Hearthstone Immortal, Master Wang not only specially rented a large official boat for him but also purchased a status of "Student of the Imperial College" [Jiansheng] in the capital for Zhou Lezhi.

*Jiansheng* were originally "Disciples of the Son of Heaven" and could be directly appointed to official positions, so their status was quite noble in the early Ming Dynasty. Later, the system relaxed; under the civil service examination system, the outlet for *Jiansheng* became increasingly narrow. Later, one could purchase admission into the College, and gradually they became the protagonists of many jokes in society.

Even so, a *Jiansheng* after all had a status close to a Provincial Graduate [*Juren*]. With such a status, one was not a commoner anymore.

For Hearthstone Immortal, this counted as a not small gift. Zhou Lezhi knew that with the Teacher's identity of so-called "Daoist" or "Divine Physician," let alone local officials could detain and cane him at will, even encountering big households playing rough, he would only have the share of eating humble pie.

But it was different now. Mr. Zhou was now an upright and honest Student of the Imperial College of the Capital—although he just registered a name and didn't even know which way the Imperial College's door opened. But when going out, the boat could hang lanterns written with "Jiansheng" in Song-style characters. When passing checkpoints and asking for lock passage, the soldiers would also be a few points more polite.

As for the main members of the family, they also all followed along—firstly, going to Dongyang this time required staying for a period; secondly, they would depart for Guangdong next year, so there was no need to split into two groups to act.

However, when informed about going to Dongyang, Yourong told the Teacher she couldn't go for now.

"This bondmaid's monthly affair hasn't come for two months; probably have it [pregnant]." When Yourong spoke, her expression was shy.

"What? You have it?!" The Teacher heard and was greatly surprised. After all, he had been plowing everyday these two years, always with zero yield.

Although there was juli [Zhou Juli], for human reproductive instinct, as long as food and drink were not a worry and one didn't need to raise children oneself, one always hoped to have a few more children. Now hearing Yourong say she had it, the Teacher was pleasantly surprised.

Since pregnant, naturally she couldn't accompany the travel. After Master Wang learned of it, he patted his chest and said he would send people to take care of Yourong. Waiting until the child was full one year old, he would then escort Yourong mother and son to Guangzhou to reunite with him.

Things not requiring him to worry, Mr. Zhou naturally agreed fully, even guaranteeing to Master Wang that upon arriving in Guangzhou he could think of more money-making methods to earn money; at that time Master Wang could also earn pots and bowls full.

Thus Zhou Lezhi cheerfully took the boat carrying the whole family to Dongyang. inside the Dongyang Farm, Zhou Lezhi followed the Teacher to toss about, building water trip-hammers and constructing a mosquito incense factory. Vigorously spending the one hundred taels of silver gifted by Master Wang cleanly, obtaining ten thousand catties of mosquito incense.

Zhou Lezhi was now already the Teacher's "Beloved Disciple," deeply trusted; the Teacher speaking in front of him also became without scruples. Regarding this "Mosquito Incense," Mr. Zhou said with a hint of disdain that this was just a "low-tech industry" without "challenge."

Of course, he said the same about the water trip-hammer house at the beginning. Originally Dongyang locally also had craftsmen specialized in building water trip-hammers, but Mr. Zhou expressed dissatisfaction with their building methods, specially drawing blueprints: what "overshot," "breastshot," "undershot," confusing the craftsmen until they didn't know the why. However, the water wheel built according to the Teacher's design didn't appear much faster than the old style; fixing and modifying instead spent much more money. The Teacher took Zhou Lezhi to squat by the water wheel everyday, measuring and calculating, going back to calculate countless drafts on the blackboard.

Zhou Lezhi learned to measure and calculate flow rate, knew how to calculate angular velocity, knew what power meant, and how to calculate...

Finally, the water trip-hammer was built stumbling and bumping. Seeing the surging power pushed out by the water wheel, the craftsmen were convinced after all.

Convinced was convinced, but such powerful power had no use. Whether hulling rice or grinding wood powder, such large output power wasn't needed. Zhou Lezhi was very puzzled.

"The greater the power, the more things can be done," The Teacher's eyes were burning. "This water power is useful; hulling rice and grinding powder is too wasting of talent. Later when we have machines, you will know its use."

"What machines?"

The Teacher scratched his scalp: "Temporarily I haven't thought well yet."

The work of making mosquito incense was much simpler. Discussing mosquito incense itself alone, the Song Dynasty had its prototype, but relatively definitive mosquito incense only existed in the Qing Dynasty. However, the mosquito incense at this time was not spiral-shaped yet, and the raw materials lacked the main component of Pyrethrum; the ratio was various spices plus arsenic, realgar, and sulfur.

Modern spiral-shaped mosquito incense with Pyrethrum components originated earliest in Japan. In this spacetime, Pyrethrum was still in Central Asia, let alone having commercial scale planting. Even if Mr. Zhou had heaven-sized ability he couldn't get it, so he could only walk the traditional path, using arsenic, realgar, mugwort, and tobacco leaves as main insect-repelling components. Using wood powder as burning agent, rosin as combustion improver, all mixed then using starch as binder. After mixing, use molds to press into shape and dry.

Mosquito incense, whether in ingredients, process, or technology, was very simple. Its main advantages were two: one was using repeatedly ground wood powder as burning agent, emitting much less smoke compared to big stick incense rolled directly from burning mugwort leaves and branches, allowing indoor use; secondly, the spiral shape could make incense sticks that burned for six or seven hours at once and were not easily damaged.

During trial production, Zhou Lezhi could tell that regarding making mosquito incense and making water trip-hammers, the Teacher actually didn't know much either. He only roughly knew how to make it, but the specific process wasn't clear. So when making, they could only experiment repeatedly. The ingredients of this mosquito incense, how much to add for each kind, all relied on testing bit by bit to finally produce a suitable formula.

In order to make this mosquito incense, two local coppersmiths were specially hired to make various measuring tools according to his requirements; the smallest spoon could only scoop up a few grains of rice. Just mixing spoon by small spoon like this, testing bit by bit; during the period probably doing several thousand times, finally getting the mosquito incense out.

During this period, Mr. Zhou tirelessly taught Zhou Lezhi the principles and processes of "experimentation," the function each raw material played...

Zhou Lezhi felt he benefited shallowly [greatly], but he still asked the Teacher a question that had puzzled him for a long time: "Teacher, you have such great learning, why take matters of craftsmen so to heart?"

A trace of bitter smile appeared on Mr. Zhou's face, saying: "Are craftsmen's matters not important yet? You are of farm origin; if without blacksmiths making sickles and plow rakes, how to farm? Without carpenters building houses, where to dwell?"

"Ai ai, Teacher, Disciple isn't saying craftsmen are useless, is saying..." Zhou Lezhi was tongue-tied for a moment, not knowing how to express, only saying after a long while, "Teacher has such great talent; if placed on Eight-legged Essays and system production, wouldn't passing for Juren and Jinshi be secure and reliable..."

Mr. Zhou froze, then laughed loudly, saying: "Come come, you say and see, why does everyone feel reading books and system production, testing for a merit/fame is best?"

"Need that be said!" Speaking of this, Zhou Lezhi was clearest. Because the Clan Leader was especially obsessed with merit and fame, at clan gatherings, he would repeatedly instruct the children to study hard and test for a merit to glorify ancestors. Then he would say certain clan because someone became an official, now bought how many clan fields; this clan because of lacking merit, in whatever matter was bullied by others and could only eat dumb loss [suffer in silence]. Speaking to the excitement, truly weeping with voice and tears.

"...Becoming an official has money, and also power! Someone in the clan becomes an official, the County Magistrate is also polite by a few points; runners dare not come to cause trouble..."

The Teacher listened to him say a lot with a smile, then said: "In the end, it means becoming an official has benefits. In books there are houses of gold, in books there are faces like jade..."

"Right, right, right, just like this!" Zhou Lezhi nodded repeatedly. "Even if not becoming an official, passing for a Xiucai, one is also a character in the countryside! At least food and drink are not a worry."

"Becoming an official has benefits; this I feel is no problem. But where do these benefits come from?"

"The Imperial Court's salary..." When Zhou Lezhi said this, he also knew it wasn't that simple, because the Clan Leader also frequently cursed the Magistrate for "scooping money" and "taking black money."

"Put it this way; whether salary or other things, all are the common people's blood and sweat," Mr. Zhou said. "If they were truly for the world and the common people, it would be fine, but in reality?"

What the reality was, Zhou Lezhi naturally knew.

"So this Great Ming's official, I am unwilling to be." When the Teacher spoke to here, the expression on his face was very complex. "Also disdain to do."

"To save the world one must enter the world. Teacher has such great learning; not being an official, isn't it a pity?"

Mr. Zhou froze, laughing loudly: "Well said! But to enter the world doesn't necessarily need to be an official. Engaging in industry can also save the country and people."

"Teacher said before 'Industry Rejuvenates the Nation,' but if not an official, how can this huge property be protected?" Zhou Lezhi said. Whether engaging in commerce or opening workshops, any property slightly larger, if without protection from people on the official face, would be very hard to operate; all had to find a backer or background.

"...I think, backers and backgrounds are not as good as relying on oneself. Master Wang favors Teacher so much now; Teacher might as well take the opportunity to get an official position to do. Being an official oneself, doing anything is easy."

These words of Zhou Lezhi came from the bottom of his heart. Although he was Master Wang's undercover, he hoped from the bottom of his heart that Mr. Zhou would achieve fame and success.

With Mr. Zhou, he was a "Student"; without Mr. Zhou, he was just a slave of Master Wang. Which was light and which heavy, Zhou Lezhi naturally distinguished clearly.

The Teacher sighed lightly: "You speak correctly. If speaking of weighing expediency, this is indeed a good method. But this Great Ming's officialdom is darker than a dye vat; for a person like me to jump in, I fear it is a dead end."
