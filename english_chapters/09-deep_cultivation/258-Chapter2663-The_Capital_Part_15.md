# Chapter 2663: The Capital (Part 15)

Leng Ningyun was startled. He opened his eyes and looked, only to see a young man in his early thirties entering. He wore a snow-blue Taoist robe, a net kerchief on his head, and had three strands of clear beard under his chin, looking refined and measured.

He habitually leaned forward slightly and said, "Sir is..."

"My humble surname is Le," the visitor said very simply.

"Mr. Le." No matter in which spacetime, what Leng Ningyun did most was deal with people. His gaze for judging people was refined to perfection. At this moment, the visitor appeared young and had a dashing posture, looking somewhat like an immortal bones Taoist. However, upon closer inspection, his demeanor seemed somewhat deliberate.

"I wonder why Sir mobilized forces to invite me here. What is your noble business?"

"Mr. Le" smiled faintly, sat down on his own, and said, "Mr. Leng, be calm and don't be impatient. Originally I didn't want to show my face, but the current situation is such that I had to invite Mr. Leng to make a trip."

Leng Ningyun had always felt this person was somewhat strange, but couldn't put his finger on it. After a moment, he reacted: the accent and tone of this "Mr. Le" in front of him were too much like a "Senator."

Since the Senate arrived in Lingao, it had spared no effort to promote Mandarin for almost ten years. However, there were still very few Naturalized Citizens who could speak Mandarin well. The best level was only speaking "Canton-Mandarin" or "Fujian-Mandarin." Although they could communicate, the accent was quite heavy.

The ones who spoke best were naturally the "new generation" children of Fangcaodi who started learning from childhood. The standard of their Mandarin was already very close to the level of the Senators. Including consciousness, thinking, habits, demeanor...

The problem was that such people were few, and the oldest was only in their early twenties. Absolutely no one was of the age of this Mr. Le before him. Moreover, the intonation and tone of his speech were completely different from Naturalized Citizens...

Leng Ningyun shivered: Could it really be...

Actually, he had already had such a thought from the moment he saw the first letter, but the "Mr. Le" appearing before him was practically a living... a "Senator"!

Leng Ningyun broke out in cold sweat. To be honest, the External Intelligence Bureau had long had similar speculations. That was after the "Umbrella" and "Parasol" cases were solved back then, when they first learned of the existence of "Old Man Shi" from interrogating captives and captured written materials. At that time, the External Intelligence Bureau said that from the infiltration methods, contact methods, and action plans, there was too much knowledge transcending the era. In that era when secret operations were basically limited to *Jianghu* people, it was too far beyond their expectations.

At that time, the big shots of the "Center" suspected that besides them and that "looming Japanese," there were other people who had transmigrated to this spacetime, and they specifically wrote a report to the Executive Committee based on the collected intelligence.

No more than twenty people had read this report, and Leng Ningyun was one of them. Of course, he knew this situation because he was going to serve as the person in charge of an overseas station—all Senators in charge of overseas stations had to read this report to understand the potential threats.

Such suspicion reached its peak during the Hangzhou Station Incident, especially the appearance of Hao Yuan, which once drove the Senate near crazy. Although Hao Yuan died in the end, the "fish that slipped through the net," Black, still made the Senate feel like it had a thorn in its back. Based on the intelligence collected, the External Intelligence Bureau's suspicion about the origin of this "Old Man Shi" was also raised to a new height.

However, the suspicion that "Old Man Shi" might be another Black dropped significantly after the "Witchcraft Case" at the Guangzhou Station. Because the Senators found it hard to imagine that a 21st-century "talent" capable of planning the Parasol Action and the riots in Hangzhou, with excellent organizational and incitement abilities, would believe in witchcraft and invest such a huge amount of manpower and material resources to toss about various Feng Shui secret arts and curses. Honestly, wouldn't it be better to use these manpower and resources on other means?

In addition, Old Man Shi's activities had decreased recently, and even such clumsy means as "counterfeit currency" were produced. The External Intelligence Bureau judged that with the basic scientific literacy of a person from the old spacetime, one would know that such a strategy would hardly succeed against quasi-modern currency.

In short, Black's actions were consistent with his logical thinking as a transmigrator, but Old Man Shi's behavior was unconstrained and imaginative, with very high upper and lower limits, difficult to summarize with logic.

Therefore, Old Man Shi was unlikely to be a second Black. At best, he was a genius of this spacetime who knew a little modern knowledge. Therefore, the speculation of the External Intelligence Bureau was that Old Man Shi was likely not a single person, but an organization gathered by certain people.

He had never seen the person before him in any relevant reports of the External Intelligence Bureau. But this man's Mandarin accent and way of speaking, as well as that strange letter, seemed to show that he had countless ties with the old spacetime...

"Mr. Leng, I know what you are thinking," the man smiled, "But, I am not."

Leng Ningyun trembled and said, "You are not what..."

"I am not the person you think I am," Mr. Le said leisurely. "That is, the person the Senate fears most."

"Pah, the Senate fears nothing." Leng Ningyun suddenly found his courage.

"The Senate has strong ships and sharp cannons, possessing the wealth of the four seas; of course, it fears nothing. It only fears this..." As he spoke, he pointed to his own head. "Otherwise, why insist on exterminating Hao Yuan completely?"

Cold sweat appeared on Leng Ningyun's back. he knew about Hao Yuan very clearly. In the Hangzhou Incident, Black and Old Man Shi loomed behind Hao Yuan, always a great hidden danger to the Senate. When he learned that Hao Yuan was killed, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Presumably, other Senators felt the same.

"In that case, your distinguished self is Old Man Shi?"

Mr. Le laughed loudly and said, "It is not impossible to say so. Only it is biased..."

Leng Ningyun's heart settled. Correct, the ones who kidnapped him were the Old Man Shi Group. Now he wanted to clarify two things most: First, why kidnap him; second, whether there was a second Black in the Old Man Shi Group.

The speech and demeanor of this "Mr. Le" before him had a "smell of the old spacetime" that felt quite familiar to Leng Ningyun, but he dared not be certain.

After pondering for a moment, he asked, "What about the unbiased version?"

"There is no such person as Old Man Shi in this world." Mr. Le said not without regret, "But, he is everywhere."

These baffling words made Leng Ningyun savor them for a while. The meaning in his words seemed to be that there really was such a person as Old Man Shi in the past, but now this person no longer existed.

"Mr. Le kidnapped me here; what do you intend?"

"Just in this Beijing City, there are at least two or three hundred people who know the background of Delong."

Leng Ningyun nodded: "This is not a secret."

"Correct, this is indeed not a secret." Mr. Le smiled. "However, knowing what kind of person Master Leng is—there are probably only us."

Leng Ningyun remained silent. unless subjected to torture or life threats, he could not admit he was a Senator. This was the outermost layer of the multi-layer confession provided by the External Intelligence Bureau to all Senators.

Seeing him remain silent, Mr. Le smiled inscrutably, leaned close to him, and whispered:

"Odd changes, even remains; for the sign, look at the quadrant."

Leng Ningyun's eyes widened. Although he had been mentally prepared for such a situation before seeing that anonymous letter with *E = mc*, the shock he felt in his heart when this moment truly arrived was still violent.

After a long while, he said, "You really are..."

"The same as you, right?"

"Aren't you?"

"No." Mr. Le smiled, a smile containing both nostalgia and a trace of sadness.

Now, Leng Ningyun's mind fell completely into disorder. Whether Old Man Shi was another transmigrator or this Mr. Le was another student of Black, he completely couldn't understand their motive for kidnapping him.

"The reason I invited Mr. Leng here is to ask you to be a peacemaker." Mr. Le clarified his purpose.

Leng Ningyun laughed: "Mr. Le must be joking: since the founding of the Great Ming, there has never been talk of ceding territory, paying indemnities, or marriage alliances. What virtue or ability does Leng possess to be this peacemaker? Even if the Senate agrees, can the Emperor agree?"

"As long as the conditions are suitable, the Emperor might not object." Mr. Le said, "You are a Senator, one of the noble Five Hundred. The Senators will definitely not sit idly by while your life is in danger."

"So, you want to use me as a hostage to force the Senate to agree to your conditions."

Mr. Le smiled slightly and did not speak.

"This is wishful thinking..."

"Not necessarily. After all, the Senate has stationed quite a few Senators in the Great Ming territory, such as Senator Zhao in Hangzhou... Actually, even in the Liangguang territory, Senators are scattered in various places, and the protection isn't necessarily watertight. Judging others by oneself, who can guarantee they will be safe forever?" Mr. Le guided patiently.

Leng Ningyun was sweating profusely at this moment. This Mr. Le looked kind and pleasant, but his words were full of murderous intent. The danger to life he spoke of was probably not simple home confiscation and beheading, but "death penalties" with more viewing effect and deterrence like death by a thousand cuts.

Compared to Zhao Yingong, who had deep collusion with the gentry in Jiangnan and existed almost like an independent kingdom, he was indeed the weakest link among all Senators stationed abroad. It was no wonder Old Man Shi's gang would jump over the wall in desperation and start with him.

He broke out in sweat again and again, knowing he was in great danger. Now he roughly understood: the Old Man Shi Group was not a simple anti-髡 bureaucrat group. Their vision was broader than ordinary bureaucrats and gentry, and their understanding of the Senate was deeper. What was certain was that there was a transmigrator pointing out the maze for them—only whether this person was Black or someone else could not be determined.

Continuing to bicker with him was meaningless. The only thing now was to stall for time and wait for rescue. He immediately pretended to submit and said, "Since you insist on thinking so, I have no choice. What do you want me to do?"

Mr. Le nodded: "A wise man submits to circumstances." Saying this, he pushed the Four Treasures of the Study on the table over, "Please write a letter, Mr. Leng."
