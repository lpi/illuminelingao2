# Chapter 2542: Trial Production

While the canal and water turbine projects were underway, the brick-and-wood structure factory building was also under intense construction. The factory adopted the timber truss structure house which was already very mature in Lingao. The overall framework of the house was made of prefabricated parts processed by the sawmill according to design drawings, sent to the site for splicing and installation. A skilled installation team with sufficient hands could erect the house framework in less than a week. Then masons built walls with red bricks. If it weren't for considering the fire resistance of the factory, they could have completely used wooden keel walls to build the station directly. The cost could be lower.

The biggest advantage of truss-structure houses was the ability to build large-span barrier-free factory buildings without needing too many beams and columns for support, which was crucial for workshops needing to arrange machines. After the factory building was completed, another batch of workers changed shifts to assemble equipment.

The machines were transported to Nansha in crates, carefully unloaded, and sent into the factory building for unboxing and assembly. The villagers watched these workers curiously—they were quite different from the previous construction workers who mostly spoke Cantonese vernacular. Almost all of them spoke "Australian Mandarin." Although they also wore similar work clothes and had "Kun heads" [short hair], these people were sturdier, and their whole bodies emitted a "distinctive" temperament. Someone said these machine assemblers were all "Old Kuns," more senior than the "New Kuns" who dug canals and built houses.

The "Old Kuns" assembled mechanical equipment faster. By the end of June, the mechanical equipment was all installed. On this day, Zou Feng conducted the first water turbine test. After opening the sluice gate, river water flowed into the diversion channel and began to drive the water wheel to rotate. Gradually, the water wheel achieved operating speed, the power transmission system operated normally, the line shaft rotated rapidly, and the entire factory building began to tremble slightly. Some people ran out of the house hurriedly, but the internship group remained motionless in the factory building, carefully observing the rotation of the line shaft.

Under Zou Feng's signal, workers pulled the connecting rods in turn. Connecting the transmission belts to the equipment, the equipment began to idle, making deafening sounds. The girls carefully watched the equipment operation, recording in notebooks at any time.

Chen Lin couldn't understand these things, but from the expressions of Zou Feng and the girls, he could roughly see that the operation status was good, so he breathed a slight sigh of relief. Since the start of construction, tens of thousands of taels of silver had been spent. Although most of it was Uncle Wu's money, his own family also participated after all. If it really broke down, the Chen family would be discredited in the future.

The test status was generally satisfactory. Next was the trial production stage. Chen Ding acquired quite a bit of cotton from the four villages [surrounding countryside] and transported it to the factory.

In the old timeline, before cotton was transported to the textile factory, it basically had undergone the ginning process in the production area to clear away cotton seeds. However, in this timeline, only the Senate had ginning machines. To improve efficiency, this process was moved to the factory to be done.

After the cotton seeds were removed by the ginning machine, the cotton was sent into the "Cleaning Workshop." The cleaning workshop was not indoors because this work raised flying dust, so cleaning was carried out in a large reed mat shed built on open ground. Since the power of the water turbine was not yet enough to drive the cleaning machine, this process was done purely by hand. Cotton was placed on wooden frames, and workers beat it with bamboo sticks to clear out impurities mixed in the cotton such as branches, leaves, insects, and soil. The cleaning process didn't require technology, and the demand on physical strength wasn't too high either. In the British Industrial Revolution period, mostly women engaged in this. Here, An Jiu also requested to hire more women to do this work.

"Spinning and weaving work should be done by women, that's fine, but this is strength work." Chen Lin felt it was inconceivable.

"Who said women can't do strength work?" An Jiu said, "Besides, this work isn't considered strenuous."

Chen Lin thought to himself, *If this isn't considered strenuous, what counts as strenuous?* However, he dared not argue with this "Chief's student," only saying yes and nodding.

The cleaned cotton was mixed together, starting the first process: carding.

Regardless of what technology or equipment was adopted, the basic processes of cotton spinning were four: carding, drawing, roving, and spinning.

"Start feeding material!" Li Tang shouted, beginning to operate the carding machine. The first batch of recruited workers gathered around her, watching her operation.

She fed the cleaned cotton into the carding machine. The cotton passed through layers of metal rake teeth crossing and facing each other on the machine, dismantling the entangled cotton fibers and combing them side by side.

"Look, the carded cotton fibers are already roughly parallel." She pointed to the product coming out of the machine. This cotton had already become loose textured strip-shaped objects, known in the trade as "slivers."

Li Tang skillfully picked up the combed sliver, loaded them into the drawing frame in groups of several, roller pressurized and combined together. This was the so-called drawing process. The purpose of the drawing process was to enhance the strength of the sliver. This process would be repeated several times; the specific number of times and the quantity of drawing depended on the raw materials and production process situation.

After drawing, the cotton slivers were loaded into a rotating container called a "slubbing can" for "weak twisting." In the process of weak twisting, the roving frame rollers drafted and elongated the cotton slivers. The cotton slivers were dozens or even hundreds of times thinner than after drawing; this was roving.

After the bobbins full of roving accumulated to a certain quantity, workers moved them to the spinning frame. The spinning frame was actually almost identical to the drawing process, only more refined.

Roving was wound on bobbins, and bobbins were sleeved on spindles. Each spinning frame drove 72 spindles. The entire textile factory had a total of ten such spinning frames.

Roving was drafted into fine yarn by rollers and finally came out from the yarn guide hook to wind onto the spindle, completing twisting and winding by the rotation of the spindle itself. This final twisting was the key step to make the yarn strong, and only when the spindle reached a certain rotational speed could the yarn be sufficiently tough.

"Came out! Came out!" Everyone shouted. It was their first time seeing such a magical and efficient spinning method.

Very quickly, one bobbin of yarn was done. Chen Lin picked up the sample given by the Australians to compare with his own. Looking carefully, there were still some slight differences. If a layman looked, naturally no difference could be seen, but an expert could see at a glance that the Australian one was obviously better.

This made him somewhat puzzled. Could it be the machines given by the Australians had problems? They were clearly the same model. Could it be that what the Australians wove with the power of water and fire would be better than water power?

But this was already good enough. Such yarn, let alone all of Guangdong, probably didn't exist in all of China.

With such yarn, why worry about not weaving good cloth!

Regrettably, the first phase of the Nansha Demonstration Factory did not include a weaving workshop. Cotton yarn was their final product.

Who to sell this cotton yarn to? The Senate didn't need it—they had their own full set of cotton textile enterprises. Fortunately, this wasn't a problem for Chen Lin. The Fengshenghe looms were not working at full load. Besides a few large draw-looms, the accompanying waist looms could all be used to weave cloth. The weavers on these waist looms could weave silk satin as well as cotton cloth.

Another destination was selling the yarn to farmers in the four villages. Although not universal, most peasant households had looms at home. Either weaving cloth or weaving silk, it counted as a sideline. In the past, besides a small amount of high-end textiles, ordinary products of Fengshenghe mostly adopted the putting-out system, distributing silk to various families to weave. Now with cotton yarn, it could be handled similarly. This network was ready-made and took no trouble to use.

Local cotton was slightly cheaper than Songjiang, while cotton cloth was more expensive. So it was still profitable for Chen Lin to make yarn with machines, although the profit was extremely meager. But if labor productivity could be significantly increased, the accumulation of meager profit would also be very considerable.

Traditionally speaking, the spinning process of a bolt of cotton cloth consumed four times the time of the weaving process. In Songjiang, weaving a bolt of cloth averaged seven days, and women produced an average of seven kilograms of yarn a month. Cleaning the cotton for a bolt of cloth needed 21 hours, spinning 49 hours, weaving 11 hours. Now spinning time was greatly shortened. Once the original women got machine yarn, the cloth output speed would double immediately.

After simple calculations, Chen Lin reached a conclusion: if cotton supply was guaranteed and price maintained at the current level, with current capacity, the entire investment could be recovered in just five years. Plus the capacity after Phase II was launched... this wasn't meager profit, it was simply huge profit.

However, a severe problem was immediately placed before Chen Lin: the spinning speed was too fast; based on local cotton production, it was far from enough. Even if he immediately called on villagers to plant cotton on a large scale, they would have to wait until autumn to harvest.

Also, who to sell such a huge amount of cotton cloth to when the time comes? The satin produced by Fengshenghe had destinations—three generations of operation had long formed a fixed sales network. But they had never handled the cotton cloth business.

As for cotton, the problem was even bigger. The cotton used for trial production was contacted with Chen Xiaobing's help and transported directly from Guangzhou. Honestly speaking, Chen Lin didn't even know where it came from. As for Xiangshan local cotton, some was acquired successively, but once officially started, it probably wouldn't last even a month.

In the evening, he mentioned this matter to Li Guo. Li Guo was older and her personality was steadier. Currently undertaking the administrative management work of the textile factory. Naturally, he discussed it with her.

"Cloth sales are easy to talk about. But this source of cotton has become a big problem."

"How does Mister intend to solve it?" Li Guo asked.

"Thinking back and forth, there are a few methods: one is to send people to set up warehouses in nearby market towns to collect cotton; local cotton is harvested in August—however..."

"However what?"

"Local cotton has never been acquired by anyone in the past; it was all spun and woven by farm families themselves. Don't know if it can be collected successfully."

"As long as the price is right, there will always be people selling. After all, spinning takes time. If they can sell flowers [cotton] directly, wouldn't they save labor to do other things?"
