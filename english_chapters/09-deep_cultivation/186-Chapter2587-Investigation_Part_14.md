# Chapter 2587 - Investigation (Part 14)

But Jubao Tang's small customers' business was distinctive—not only few varieties but large quantities. For Lushi Powder, one customer often purchased upwards of a hundred bottles at once. How many markets would one have to travel to sell all that medicine?

Yet customer transactions were extremely frequent. The interval between one batch's delivery and the next was twelve days at most, sometimes only five or six days. Were they eating the medicine themselves or what?

The strangeness didn't stop there. Yuan Shuzhi also discovered from the ledgers that customers all prepaid, then had to wait several days for delivery. This was truly rare—what miracle elixir was in such demand? Looking at prices, they rose and fell, sometimes high, sometimes low.

Though Yuan Shuzhi had never worked in the pharmaceutical industry, he'd received some health and medical training and knew something about traditional pharmacy business practices. None of this fit industry norms.

The current "improvements" mainly targeted these "unreasonable" aspects—especially drastically reducing sales amounts and unit prices. But Manager Gao also said that besides improvements, he needed to make an unmodified "original copy" using "Australian accounting" methods.

When Yuan Shuzhi saw "Lushi Powder," suspicion had already arisen. With Manager Gao's additional requests, he felt increasingly certain something was wrong.

But this alone proved nothing. The key was determining whether their medicines were adulterated with "Australian drugs."

Yuan Shuzhi wanted to investigate, but Jubao Tang's management was extremely strict. After several days here, he'd only seen Manager Gao and that one assistant. He hadn't seen a single other person. His daily life and accounting were confined to the small courtyard. Three meals a day were delivered to the yard. If he was tired, he could walk around the courtyard, but trying to leave it meant being blocked by the assistant. It was like house arrest.

The two sets of completed ledgers and original drafts were immediately taken away. The next day, Manager Gao would bring back the returned ledgers, pointing out what was improper and needed revision. But as he completed more ledgers and better understood the owner's intentions, fewer and fewer ledgers needed revision now.

This made Yuan Shuzhi increasingly aware something was wrong here. Fortunately, before leaving the inn, he'd already sent a secret letter to the investigation team in Boluo informing them of his whereabouts. By now the team should have someone watching this place. So Old Yuan wasn't worried.

Yuan Shuzhi's secret letter reached Boluo county seat through Qiwei's mail channel. Lu Cheng was overjoyed. Because of their special identities, openly appearing at the medicine market would alert the enemy. So the entire investigation team stayed in Boluo county—on one hand conducting proper "flying inspections," keeping Boluo county government busy; on the other, dispatching several undercover agents to the medicine market to gather information.

Now the undercover agents' news hadn't arrived yet, but Yuan Shuzhi had already "infiltrated enemy ranks." From his letter's contents, this Jubao Tang was indeed highly suspicious.

After receiving Yuan Shuzhi's report, the investigation team immediately adjusted their deployment. Through Boluo county's Political Security special agent, they assigned several local "informants" to watch Jubao Tang while secretly investigating this pharmacy.

Investigation revealed that Jubao Tang had only opened about half a year ago. Since opening, its main business was wholesale of prepared medicines like "pills, elixirs, pastes, and powders"—not raw medicinal materials. Normally only medicine peddlers came to stock up. Nothing particularly noteworthy. On Boluo county's tax registration rolls, there were records of Jubao Tang's "market entry tax." From the listed medicine names and values, its monthly drug sales amounted to only a few hundred yuan—mostly mid-to-low-end daily medicines. The largest volume was, conspicuously, Lushi Powder.

So where did this Lushi Powder come from? From the market entry tax register, the Lushi Powder was all marked with "Chun" [Spring] label—meaning all these medicines came from Wanchun Quan. But when sold, they were marked "Ju" [Treasure].

So Jubao Tang's Lushi Powder was simply repackaged Wanchun Quan product.

The problem was, though Wanchun Quan's main store was in Boluo county seat, it also had a storefront at the Grotto Heaven medicine market. Moreover, Wanchun Quan was a century-old establishment, and Lushi Powder was originally formulated there. Though this era lacked trademark registration and patent protection concepts and any pharmacy could sell self-made Lushi Powder, whether considering the shop's longevity or the medicine's reputation, Wanchun Quan's Lushi Powder clearly had more authority. Why would medicine peddlers take a detour to Jubao Tang?

The possibility was that Jubao Tang was "counterfeiting"—buying Wanchun Quan's original medicine, adding other cheap ingredients, turning one portion into ten to profit.

But after secretly investigating Wanchun Quan's shopkeeper, managers, past ledgers, and some medicine market veterans, Lu Cheng discovered this wasn't the case either.

Wanchun Quan's Lushi Powder was indeed one of their main products, but overall its reputation was mediocre—effective but not remarkably so. The formula was simple with inexpensive ingredients, and similar products existed elsewhere. Sales were average. From any angle, there was no point in counterfeiting it.

So what was the purpose of their shuffling? Lu Cheng, recalling the case briefing contents, suspected Jubao Tang was adding Australian drugs to Wanchun Quan's Lushi Powder and repackaging it—hence these bizarre actions.

She instructed Boluo county's Political Security special agent to send a medicine peddler to Jubao Tang to purchase goods—buying some Lushi Powder to send back to Huizhou Prefecture for component identification.

Unexpectedly, identification showed the Lushi Powder contained no compound ingredients.

Was their guess wrong? For a moment, the investigation team was caught in contradictions.

"No." Lu Cheng said decisively. "Though it contains no compound ingredients, that doesn't prove Jubao Tang is clean. Our person was an unfamiliar face—they probably became suspicious!"

"Immediately arrest one of the medicine peddlers who frequently visits Jubao Tang!" She issued the order. "Don't arrest at the medicine market. Wait until he's on the main road, then secretly abduct him."

Since Zheng Xiaoyu had arranged the "Joint Clinic" matter for Boss He and accepted twenty percent dry shares, he and Boss He had become like brothers, frequently visiting He Jun's residence secretly for banquets and entertainment.

This day, He Jun hosted Zheng Xiaoyu at his private residence. He was already familiar with the place by now. Disguised in Ming-style clothing, he quietly took a small sedan chair at night to He Jun's private residence.

This private residence wasn't He Jun's main house but his place for "keeping a golden house for a beauty"—not only housing beautiful concubines and maids but also served by an excellent cook, with a small garden inside. Both secretive and comfortable, it was also where he entertained important guests and conducted "public relations."

After three rounds of wine and five courses of dishes, He Jun saw Zheng Xiaoyu's face flushed from drink with a slightly tipsy air. Feeling the time was right, he first flattered him.

After the flattery, he said quietly: "I see you're young and promising, deeply appreciated by the Elders. You'll surely achieve greatness! If you don't mind, become sworn brothers with me, He Jun. We'll share fortune and hardship, make our business bigger and bigger. Half of my family's enterprise will be yours!"

"Well said, well said." Zheng Xiaoyu now agreed to whatever he said, but still needed to play hard to get. "It's just that the Senate most forbids forming sworn brotherhoods. If discovered, it wouldn't be good for either of us."

"No matter, no matter. However powerful the Senate, they can't control what happens in private residences." He Jun consoled. "We'll just swear brotherhood privately without exchanging birth date cards. Of course, it must be kept secret from outsiders—can't harm your career. After we're sworn, we'll be family. Whatever older brother has, except for your sister-in-law, whatever you want that brother has—just take it!"

"Hehe, you jest, elder brother." Knowing his "enthusiasm," Zheng Xiaoyu knew today's banquet must have "real substance." The earlier parts were just groundwork; now he was being recruited.

He went with the flow: "Becoming elder brother's sworn brother—I'd be more than willing." Then he sighed: "I won't hide it from you, elder brother. I come from humble origins. My parents died when I was young. I struggled alone to survive. I've long wished for a family member who understood warmth and cold. Since elder brother doesn't disdain me, naturally I'm willing..." He even dabbed at his eyes.

Thus the two swore brotherhood under the moonlight. He Jun was older, becoming the elder brother; Zheng Xiaoyu younger, the younger brother.

After their alliance, Zheng Xiaoyu toasted He Jun.

"Since Brother Zheng doesn't disdain me and is willing to become my sworn brother, I'll say nothing more—I'll drink this cup dry!" He Jun immediately drained his cup.

The two exchanged toasts and chatted merrily. Amid the clinking glasses, He Jun inquired whether more "prescription pads" could be allocated to Bailing Tang's Joint Clinic.

"What's difficult about that?" Zheng Xiaoyu laughed. "Send someone to pick them up tomorrow."

He Jun smiled as he poured him wine, then said quietly: "That's not what I mean, brother."

"Then what kind?" Zheng Xiaoyu pretended confusion.

Knowing he was posturing, He Jun smiled warmly: "What other kind? Controlled substance prescriptions, of course."

Before he finished, Zheng Xiaoyu started shaking his head, looking down with a silent smile.

Seeing him not respond, He Jun grew secretly anxious and pressed: "Brother! These prescriptions?"

"Difficult." Zheng Xiaoyu heaved a long sigh. "Elder brother must know—the Senate watches controlled substances closely. These prescriptions are even more strictly controlled. Using them will get you in trouble. Instead of earning money, you'll attract an investigation team and cause yourself problems. Why bother? Just with those four words 'Joint Clinic' plus controlled drug prescription rights, elder brother, you could make money lying down—isn't that enough?"
