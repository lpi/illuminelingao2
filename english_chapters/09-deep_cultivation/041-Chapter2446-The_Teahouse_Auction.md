# Chapter 2446: The Teahouse Auction

Wu Nanhai believed that if natives obtained technology too cheaply, in the long run it would only harm the Senators' interests. When factories were still in early construction stages and workers hadn't fully mastered factory production technology, the technology held by Senators seemed quite important to people—without the Senators' technology, none of this would happen. But when factories were completed and workers had skillfully mastered production, they would only think that everything in the factory was created by themselves and had nothing to do with the Senators. The invisibility of technological knowledge would cause people to diminish the importance of intellectual property. If knowledge was no longer important, then the Senators' glory wouldn't be far from lost.

To ensure workers always recognized and clearly understood the importance of Senators' technology within the Senate, protecting intellectual property seemed very necessary.

And ensuring intellectual property's importance meant that from the very beginning, people had to be instilled with the idea that intellectual property also needed to be purchased with real money, and moreover, like farmland, it could continuously generate money. Only this way would the Senators' glory be ensured long-term.

Furthermore, in the past, their technology diffusion mainly worked through a model of selecting partners. This selection had no specific criteria, but was more often based on individual Senators' views. Often some native merchant, through chance encounter, gained favor from a Senator or department and thus received support. Though overall the supported targets had performed well so far, this was inevitably unfair and carried great speculation and randomness. It also made native merchants scheme even harder. None of this was conducive to creating a fair and open business environment.

Wu Nanhai's theory had gained support from many Senators. As the Senate's strength further increased, Senators who had previously placed great importance on "technology diffusion" had also changed their attitudes. After all, when you have machine guns, you don't obsess over flintlock technology anymore. Moreover, the Senate's current overall industrial situation—not quite there yet, world-leading in technology but with pitifully small output—urgently needed to change. The auction was convened under these conditions.

Wu Nanhai picked up the folder from the table and began browsing. The documents recorded merchants who had paid their deposits. According to the Senate's new regulations, engaging in industry and commerce required a business entity. So this list had many unfamiliar-looking enterprises—all newly registered companies by local powerful families.

Since the Tax Bureau arrived in Guangzhou, local powerful families had been registering companies to adapt to the new tax system, resulting in many new "limited liability companies."

Wu Nanhai turned to the second page, which contained background information on these participating enterprises. He slowly browsed, looking at the actual controllers behind these unremarkable business names—among them were several names he was familiar with, all notable figures from late Ming Guangdong. The others he didn't know, but presumably they weren't ordinary merchants either.

This auction saw no participation from some of the benchmark enterprises previously supported and invested in by the Senate, such as the Zhang family's food enterprise or the Chen Li Ji and Runshitang pharmaceutical enterprises. Many who came had had little previous interaction with the Senate—"newcomers" now hoping to find money-making opportunities under the new system.

However, looking at their backgrounds alone, apart from very few, most actual controllers had no connection to "industry" whatsoever. Over ninety percent had commerce, lending, and agricultural tenancy as their main income sources. Less than ten percent of actual controllers had operated handicraft industries, concentrated in silk weaving, food processing, and handicrafts.

Wu Nanhai had read the *Guangzhou Industry and Commerce Survey* compiled by the Guangzhou Municipal Comprehensive Management Office and understood Guangzhou's industrial and commercial foundations quite well. In a word, there was very little large-scale manufacturing. So almost no such figures existed here.

*Manufacturing doesn't make you rich in any era,* Wu Nanhai thought to himself. Looking at these wealthy families' situations, the richest were almost all in trade and lending.

Guiding them toward manufacturing—which required large investment, low profit, and slow returns—probably couldn't have been done without the Senate's halo.

Of course, the so-called "patents" in this auction were essentially "franchises." No matter which project local merchants won, actual operation meant they put up money (and perhaps land), while the Senate provided technology. And given the Senate's current situation, there was no way they would let these merchants lose money. After spending money, merchants would also be on the Senate's ship—fame and fortune would surely follow. This could probably be considered a win-win situation.

Just after noon on January 15th, Wu Yijun brought his servant and came to the Great World in a two-person sedan chair.

The Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce had an office in the Great World, but the auction wasn't held at the office. The specific location was where the Great World's "Outer World" and "Inner World" intersected. Here, a row of storefronts had been knocked through and uniformly renovated, with a sign reading "Lotus Root Pavilion Teahouse" hanging outside.

This teahouse wasn't much different from local Guangzhou teahouses, except it was run by Australians. What they sold was old-timeline "Cantonese morning tea"—now called "Australian morning tea."

As soon as Australian morning tea appeared, it won acclaim among Guangzhou's wealthy classes. Compared to old-timeline morning tea, the 17th-century archaic version of dim sum was not only crude in production and ingredient selection, but the portions were also truly too "substantial." A single sticky rice in lotus leaf was enough for a meal, its size comparable to Jiaxing meat zongzi. Quite unfriendly for wealthy people.

If a tea patron had any understanding of Lingao and the Senate, they would know the Lotus Root Pavilion name had considerable origins. That's right—not only was it an Australian-run teahouse, it was also the "tertiary industry" of Wu Nanhai's Agriculture and Forestry sector. After South Sea Teahouse was transferred to General Office management with Agriculture and Forestry Ministry only acting as custodian, Wu Nanhai had instructed Ye Yuming to establish Lotus Root Pavilion Teahouses in relatively prosperous commercial cities throughout Senate-ruled territories, operating as a chain. The target consumers were mainly stationed or traveling Senators and naturalized citizen cadres, also receiving local natives who wanted to try something new.

This Lotus Root Pavilion Teahouse in the Great World had naturally also become the favorite destination for various "new nobility" or influential families hoping to curry favor. Holding the auction here was only natural.

Because of the auction, today's Lotus Root Pavilion Teahouse entrance had a "Private Event Today" notice posted. In the open space at the entrance, over a dozen sedan chairs had already parked. Sedan bearers and servants squatted against the teahouse's outer wall, chatting idly.

Wu Yijun glanced at the sedan chairs and servants. He knew most of them belonging to Federation of Industry and Commerce members. A quick look showed not many heavyweight figures had arrived. The most important person already there was Gao Ju, but Gao Ju wasn't participating in the auction today—he was attending as a "leader."

*Still early,* Wu Yijun thought. *These big shots always liked to arrive right on time—probably to show their importance.*

One personal servant could accompany their master into the venue. The servant presented the "invitation" at the entrance, and master and servant were admitted.

Lotus Root Pavilion Teahouse's first floor was a spacious, bright main hall with about twenty-plus Eight Immortals tables. All four sides had gallery corridors. The gallery corridors above were all private rooms—very convenient for gatherings and discussions. This was also one reason why local business magnates liked coming here.

Today was the auction, so naturally no one went to the private rooms. About half the Eight Immortals tables already had guests. As soon as he entered, everyone stood up to greet him. Wu Yijun was responding haphazardly when a tea attendant in a white short jacket came over:

"Master Wu, would you like to sit at the front today or..."

"Front or back doesn't matter. Just somewhere with a clear view."

"Right away." The tea attendant immediately led him to a table against the wall. Wu Yijun looked around—this position had a view of the entire room. He nodded with satisfaction. The servant immediately took out a bill and slipped it to the attendant.

"Thank you for Master Wu's generosity!" The tea attendant bowed and scraped away. Before long, he brought over tea sets and cups. The tea attendants all kept customers' preferences firmly in mind. Without special instructions, they followed the regular routine.

The main hall originally had a small stage for performer entertainment. Today, at center stage stood a gate-shaped frame with a blackboard beside it. On the other side was a small table piled high with sealed folders.

Wu Yijun observed the entire teahouse. The person nearest him was a young man who seemed somewhat unfamiliar. He wondered if the Federation had such a member. Looking more carefully at his appearance, there was a thirty percent familiar resemblance.

*So it's him!* Wu Yijun suddenly understood.

This young man was none other than Shen Changxi, the young master of Jufenghao Exchange Shop.

Jufenghao Exchange Shop, as the most prestigious exchange shop in Guangzhou, had originally been a steady "sitting and eating" business. However, after the Australians issued "Australian dollars" and prohibited circulation of silver taels and copper coins, the exchange shop business was finished. The reason was self-evident. Moreover, the Central Reserve Bank immediately prohibited private gold exchange transactions—that took away the exchange shop's final business too.

Jufenghao naturally had to close. The shop's workers and craftsmen weren't worried about prospects—they were quickly absorbed by the Hong Kong Mint and the Central Reserve Bank's Guangzhou branch. The Central Reserve Bank also extended an olive branch to the Shen father and son, asking them to come work there. After all, these two were rare "technical talents."

But the father and son politely declined the Senate's invitation. The Shen family had been in business in Guangzhou for many years with substantial family accumulation. They were unwilling to just "close up shop" and were preparing to start fresh.

*It seemed they had already chosen a suitable project,* Wu Yijun thought.

Looking farther away was Boss Mi—Wu Yijun couldn't help frowning, as if smelling a stench already. This big boss who had controlled all of Guangzhou's "night soil districts" had sensibly handed over all his "night soil routes," then switched to operating a "fertilizer business," using his facilities and channels to sell "fertilizer" for the Sanitation Office.
