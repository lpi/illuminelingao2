# Chapter 2635: Legal Popularization Style Lawsuit (Part 4)

So when Law Society formulating relevant laws had to make certain compromise to commercial habits of 17th century. Made corresponding regulations to commercial habits of this time space in way of judicial explanation.

These commercial habits looking from legal angle very hard to say completely reasonable. But years deep days long, already deep into people's hearts. Law Society also powerless to make total denial at once. So besides parts obviously violating common sense, violating public order good customs and monopoly style commercial habits, other commercial habits mostly gave tacit approval.

Adhering to such principle, Liang Xinhu made following judgment.

"According to folk commercial habits, only acts like owing rent, transferring rent (subletting?), violating public security etc., landlord can dissolve contract unilaterally. When house renting contract established initially, if term already agreed, except circumstances stipulated by contract, one party of parties regardless when cannot declare dissolving contract. This is caused by nature of contract. Our country's Renting Lending Contract habit, always respects Lessor's ownership. If Borrower has act violating contract and hindering public security, the contract naturally should be dissolved, solidly no need to discuss. However if Borrower does not violate contract, and Landlord cannot dissolve unilaterally. Otherwise not only according to Legal Principle not allowed, even checking against Habit, Human Feeling, also absolutely no such reason."

After explanation finished, Naturalized Citizen Clerk announced all stand up. Liang Xinhu picked up gavel smashing heavily for second time: "...Summarizing above, Plaintiff's litigation request has legal basis. This Court gives support. According to Article 231 of *Great Song Senate Contract Law*, Article 144 of *Great Song Senate Civil Procedure Law*, judgment as follows: 1. Order Defendant Zhang Cai to restore House Renting Lending Contract relationship with Plaintiff Chen Sanli; 2. Order Defendant Zhang Cai within ten days starting from effectiveness date of this judgment, pay Plaintiff Chen Sanli rent silver dollars of past renting period and concurrent interest total 1 Yuan. Interest calculated according to Delong Bank average loan interest. Parties having money payment obligation if not fulfilling money payment obligation according to period designated by this judgment, should pay double debt interest of delayed performance period according to regulation of Article 255 of *Great Song Senate Civil Procedure Law*. Litigation fee four fen borne half by Plaintiff Defendant each."

Judgment finished, Defendant face still revealed unconvinced expression. Plaintiff was satisfied. In crowd auditing someone whispered. Zhang Jiayu faintly heard: "This Australian judging lawsuit is also messy very much!"

According to Zhang Jiayu's understanding, Shopkeeper Zhang also counted as benevolent utmost righteous exhausted, returned rent. Even if not willing to rent again, also couldn't count as any breach of contract. Instead such Chen Sanli, insisting pestering not letting go, obviously was a unruly person (*Diao Min*). If according to his temper, must give him forty big boards first "To correct folk style."

Following lawsuits, mostly similar to it. Mostly chicken feather garlic skin matters. Biggest one was no more than trade dispute. Total less than a few Yuan case value. Liang Xinhu's judgment, some he felt judged well, reasonable; some he also didn't think so. But, Zhang Jiayu towards Australians' justice still held relatively positive attitude. No matter how judging, reasonable not reasonable let alone say, all were according to law articles. And Liang Xinhu towards mastering law articles obviously familiar. When citing, picked up by hand coming, biting words chewing characters clearly and clearly. Presumably this was so-called "Professional." While admiring, also secretly somewhat despising: Liang Xinhu noble as Senator, actually proficiently studied Way of Book Clerks (*Xu Li*), truly self willing to fall...

One by one case tried down. Some cases cause simple, merely three words two languages gave judgment. Issuing relevant legal documents on spot. This efficiency compared to old yamen case trying back and forth for ten days half month, involving many people to "Testify" was much more convenient. Besides money inviting people to write complaint and litigation fee, also no need to spend various inexplicable "Customary Fees" (*Gui Fei*). For common people indeed was good thing.

Liang Xinhu tried continuously for more than two hours, felt tired. Let Yuchi Gang preside trial, himself went back to rest. But he didn't rest completely, but listened to trial process in big speaker momentarily. Making some records on notebook from time to time.

Lecturing how many law articles and cases, couldn't match going to court to try a case personally coming improvement fast. In all cadres under Senate system, judicial cadres were hardest to cultivate. Could not let go hand to let them "Intern" either. Justice not only "Human Life Concerns Heaven," in social moral level also had function of leading atmosphere. Impact of one precedent on whole social order was inestimable. This was also reason why Liang, Shen and others until now still wanted "Hand holding Hand."

Huang *Shi* admittedly didn't come to divorce, but similar cases involving women children rights, yet in past counted as family dispute cases had quite a few. This was case Liang Xinhu tried emphatically. Among them one was Property Dispute Case. Cause of action was old person without son, only having several daughters. After getting old was several daughters son-in-laws rotated providing for old sending end. But after person died, own clan nephew under support of clan elders occupied old person's property. Daughters son-in-laws came to sue for this, requesting to take back property.

Naturally, they coming to sue was also receiving "High Person Pointing." Liang Xinhu every time arriving a place to try, always wanted to make a few "Typical Cases" out.

This kind of Property Dispute Case had in Great Ming rule in past too. Generally speaking, officials mostly judged by way of mixing mud (compromising): marking out a part of property belonging to daughter son-in-law, big head still nephew's or other clan relatives'. But this time was according to *Civil Code*, daughter as direct relative inherited all property. Don't say just own clan nephew, even biological nephew couldn't inherit.

Judgment down, whole venue in uproar. Even Zhang Jiayu was extremely surprised: In his view, old person without son, property inherited by clansmen after death was heaven's principle earth's righteousness. Daughter son-in-law fulfilled filial piety to old person in ordinary days, based on this discretionarily sharing some floating property was conforming to heaven principle human feeling. Let alone these families were not poor destitute. Like this isn't it instigating outer surnames to eat extinction household (*Chi Jue Hu*)!

These days he already faintly felt, Australians held huge hostility towards old clan system. Whether instigating women to divorce (attempted), or judgment of this Property Dispute Case, all were declaring to folks: Senate didn't admit Clan's domination over clansmen's person and property.

As long as reading a few more books of Hundred Schools of Thought, naturally understood where Australians' hostility towards Clan came from. Also no wonder local gentry wanted to be enemy with Senate. Zhang Jiayu's mood at this moment was very complex. From original heart, he came to "Undercover." Australians' "Acting against tide" (*Dao Xing Ni Shi*) would only make "Career" they carried out secretly smooth. Those big households with rat head two ends (indecisive) as long as seeing Australians' style, naturally would understand who was their enemy. However, Australians sparing no effort protecting folks' interests, saying them deeply obtaining Way of "Ren" (Benevolence) was not excessive.

Circuit trial conducted like wind and fire, known to everyone in ten *li* eight townships. Zhang Xiao wanted exactly such effect. Third day early morning, sky color not bright, a specially composed search team already packed and ready to go.

"Jiayu, you also follow team to depart." Before departing, Zhang Xiao suddenly sent someone to give him order.

Zhang Jiayu didn't know still had such an arrangement. Hearing wanting him to follow team to depart to search inspect, couldn't help panicking hands and feet. He knew very little about Chen Ziren and others' layout. Didn't clear what arrangement Jiujiang here had. Last time Zhang Xiao mentioned suspicion of Zhu clan privately manufacturing gunpowder, he already suspected this was "Gunpowder Bureau" arranged secretly by Chen Ziren and others.

Although searching out no violation object at that time, Chief Zhang obviously already suspected Zhu family. Originally he had heart wanting to warn Chen Ziren and others, but himself was beside Zhang Xiao. One word one act all under Kun thieves' eyes and ears. Rashly acting not only couldn't save people, instead put himself in first. Besides didn't find any violation object either.

Today Australians suddenly wanted to search inspect. Don't know where found what spider silk horse track (clues) again. Just in case they searched out some violation things, implicating a group of teachers and friends, wouldn't it ruin big matter...

In a moment, his brain already turned over dozen thoughts. But at this moment he could only forcefully act calm, claiming yes repeatedly.

Arriving in camp, saw Batto Unit (*Ba Dao Dui*) protecting Zhang Xiao already gathered. Zhang Jiayu followed Zhang Xiao for long days, knew this Batto Unit ordinary days mostly served as Senate peripheral guard. This time suddenly gathering them to go on mission must be big matter happening.

He saw Director Mo Yu of Jiujiang Market Police Station also among them—could it be he leading team? However looking again, man commanding there, wearing a suit of ordinary "Cadre Suit," without any mark badge on top. Couldn't see what background.

However whether Mo Yu or Batto Unit Corporal Matsumura Uemon, towards this man all were respectful, completely a look of subordinate to superior.

Zhang Jiayu looked over, this person about thirty-plus years old, face very raw. Not Zhang Xiao's attendant, nor local cadre. But expression capable, two eyes bright and spirited. Although stature not counted as tall and big, looking at his limb movement strong and powerful, obviously a practitioner with Kung Fu in body.

This person probably was Australians' "Steam Bun" (*Zheng Bao* - Political Security) radiocast. Zhang Jiayu heard his name for long time. Although not understanding its meaning, also knew this was Australians' Depot Guard (*Chang Wei* - Spy Agency), specialized in investigating and arresting various rebel thieves. Even noble as "Senator," hearing "Zheng Bao" two words, often also revealed frightened look.

Last time going to Zhu family to search, team leader was only Mo Yu. This time actually Depot Guard sent person to supervise and lead. Obviously obtained some critical news.

Saw Zhang Xiao and this person talked a few sentences in low voice. This person shook head repeatedly. But Chief Zhang seemed to be insisting something. Passing a while, this person finally nodded head...

While figuring out this pantomime, Hening came over, bringing him a suit of Australian outfit.

"Take this for what? I not used to wearing..."

Even for undercover making sacrifice on reputation, shaving hair changing clothes these two things he absolutely wouldn't do.

"You this fool! This time mission needs to walk land road, not taking boat! You wearing this messy long gown cloth shoes, in a while on field ridge stepping all mud! Even road can't walk!"
