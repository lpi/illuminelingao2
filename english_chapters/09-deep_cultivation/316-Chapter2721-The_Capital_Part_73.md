# Chapter 2721: The Capital (Part 73)

An Australian oil lamp lit the main hall brightly.

Li Rufeng stood in the main hall of Heliansheng, eyes piercing.

Before him was a pile of the latest "news" collected from various sources. On top was that from Min Zhanlian's squad.

Besides Min Zhanlian's squad, two more squads had arrived and were deployed toward Zhangjiakou in the north and Shanxi in the west.

Each squad operated independently. Intelligence was compiled manually and sent to Heliansheng, where Li Rufeng screened it. A copy was also sent to the Foreign Intelligence Bureau far away in Lingao.

News came in every day, but so far, the truly valuable intelligence was from Min Zhanlian's squad regarding a series of suspicious points about Nanyuan.

Combined with the recent sudden death of Second Master Qin, their judgment increasingly leaned toward Leng Ningyun probably being somewhere in Nanyuan.

But Nanyuan was simply too large. Rushing in to search would not only fail to find the person but might also alert the enemy.

The night was deep, but he felt no sleepiness. He felt restless energy throughout his body, yet didn't know where to direct it.

An escort master came to report: "Huang Qi is here!"

Li Rufeng's brow relaxed. "Show him in!"

Since he had assigned Huang Qi to investigate Eunuch Yang's affairs, he hadn't received any word from him. This man was known for being meticulous and reliable when he served in the Eastern Depot—not the type to rush back with every rumor. His coming now surely meant he had definite news.

In a moment, the escort master brought in a middle-aged man from outside. This man had an imposing bearing and proper manner; his every gesture carried an "official air." At a glance, he looked like one of the capital's vast population of clerks who "ate official rice" in various yamens.

Though Huang Qi had an imposing appearance, he was a man with no sense of right or wrong who only cared about who paid him. However, the Donglin Party's restoration had taught him a lesson: don't pick the wrong side. When the "Nine Thousand Years" was at the height of his power, who could have imagined that the new Emperor would take his life with a single decree? He himself had been forced to hide in Guangdong for several years.

Now that he was willing to work for Heliansheng, it was naturally because he thought the Australian ship was a good one.

Huang Qi cupped his fists. "Greetings, Master Li!"

Li Rufeng immediately returned the courtesy. "Fifth Master Huang is too polite. Greetings!"

Huang Qi didn't waste words. His eyes swept the room, and Li Rufeng immediately understood his meaning. "No one usually comes in here. The surroundings are all our own people from the Escort Bureau, guarding like iron buckets. Please sit and speak at ease." He immediately ordered someone to bring a bowl of milk tea.

Mongolian milk tea was also available in the capital in the late Ming, though not as common as in the later Qing Dynasty. It warmed the stomach and could fill and energize—mostly drunk by escort masters, soldiers, petty officials... those who worked at night.

Huang Qi drank the milk tea. Seeing the serving attendant withdraw, he said in a low voice, "I've found out everything you asked me to look into. There's nothing strange about Eunuch Yang himself. After Manager Leng was kidnapped, he was very anxious. He sent his adopted son and his subordinate eunuchs several times to gather news. He even specifically sent someone to Shuntian Prefecture, meaning for them to solve the case quickly and unseal Delong so he could withdraw his silver. As for his people coming to Delong, you surely know that better than I."

Li Rufeng said, "Yes, he did send people to Delong."

"But his adopted son, Little Eunuch Yang, is quite suspicious."

Hearing this, Li Rufeng's whole body tensed. In truth, his investigation of Eunuch Yang was mainly to see whether his huge deposits had attracted the greed of petty thieves. But from Huang Qi's tone, it seemed the problem lay with Little Eunuch Yang.

According to Huang Qi's investigation, Yang Tianliang had been acting suspiciously since Manager Leng's kidnapping, frequently associating with the capital's urban foxes and social rats. Normally, eunuchs interacting with local ruffians wasn't unusual. But the people he associated with weren't ordinary ruffians—they were dangerous men who "carried blades."

The capital was the realm's first place of virtue. No matter how powerful ruffians were in the city, they didn't dare carry knives, swords, spears, or similar weapons. In daily brawls, they used sticks and clubs, never blades.

For the yamen, "using blades means violence"—that made you a highway robber, a bandit. For ruffians who wanted to make a living in the capital, this was an inviolable iron law.

Dangerous men who dared use weapons mostly operated in the capital's suburbs: highway robbery, kidnapping, murder and theft. The two worlds were as distinct as the Jing and Wei rivers. Eunuchs generally wouldn't associate with such people.

But this Little Eunuch Yang not only associated with these people but did so quite frequently, often meeting them privately in desolate places in the South City such as Cibei Temple and Hongluo Factory.

"Really?!" Li Rufeng's pupils contracted.

"Really!" Huang Qi said. "The people he meets are all men of repute on the roads around the capital. Some of them you've actually met."

"Who?"

"Didn't Delong have three brothers surnamed Wang who came to claim ransom under false pretenses?"

"You know about that?"

"Of course I know." Huang Qi said leisurely. "Those three blockheads were tricked into coming by a certain big shot with a name. Otherwise, how could they have known the details so clearly?"

"So that means..." Li Rufeng instinctively wanted to say, "Little Eunuch Yang is the kidnapper." He immediately realized the person across from him wasn't "one of us" and swallowed the words.

Yet Huang Qi seemed to know what was in his belly. He continued, "Little Eunuch Yang may not be the kidnapper himself, but he must be deeply connected to this matter."

Li Rufeng nodded. "Does Eunuch Yang know about this?"

"Naturally not. If he knew, he'd be so angry he'd hang himself." Huang Qi said. "Eunuch Yang has gotten old these past few years. His mind isn't as sharp as before. He relies on this adopted son for everything. It's easy to deceive him."

"This is no small matter," Li Rufeng said. "If it was really his doing, not only would he be in trouble if things went wrong, but his adoptive father would also be implicated."

"This Yang Tianliang has long harbored resentment toward Eunuch Yang," Huang Qi said. "When the current Emperor ascended the throne, Eunuch Yang pulled strings and worked connections, spending tens of thousands of silver to get the position of Steward of the Bell and Drum Office. Though it's one of the Twenty-Four Offices, it's a backwater with limited income. The palace is run by eunuchs from Prince Xin's household now. Eunuch Yang himself isn't doing well, so Little Eunuch Yang naturally can't be said to be thriving either."

"I see." Li Rufeng thought this now made sense. Little Eunuch Yang's future in the palace was limited. Though called "Little," he was actually in his mid-thirties. Following his master, he had scraped together some money, but compared to his desires, it was a drop in the bucket. One hundred thousand taels of silver was no small sum; it was only natural that he'd be tempted.

Of course, this also explained why the kidnappers were so familiar with Delong and Leng Ningyun's situation. Because Delong's biggest and most familiar customer was Eunuch Yang.

"Indeed, you guard day and night, but you can't guard against a thief in the family," Li Rufeng thought. He asked, "Is there any other news? Any leads on Manager Leng's whereabouts?"

"No leads, of course. The matter is sealed tight in the capital. But Little Eunuch Yang often meets people in the South City—in that general area. Even if not in the city, it would be the southern suburbs."

The outer city had been built recently and had few residents or merchants, leaving much empty land. So besides the altars and temples, there were various Ministry of Works facilities and material yards: the Glazed Tile Factory, the Red Gauze Factory, the Wood Yard, the Reed Yard... all were located here. Some were managed by officials from the Ministry of Works; some by palace eunuchs. All could hide people. Looking closely, it wasn't necessarily the case that the hostage had to be hidden in Nanyuan.

Among the various people Huang Qi said Little Eunuch Yang contacted in the outer city, Third Master Qin was prominently included. Besides this, Huang Qi mentioned one more thing: Little Eunuch Yang had frequently traveled to and from Tianjin before Leng Ningyun was kidnapped. The problem was that Eunuch Yang had no property or business in Tianjin. He wouldn't have sent his adopted son to Tianjin on errands. So the trips to Tianjin could only be Yang Tianliang's own affairs.

From a timeline perspective, his trips to Tianjin were likely connected to the kidnapping case. After all, Min Zhanlian's people had already discovered related leads in Tianjin.

"What was he doing in Tianjin? Who was he meeting? Any leads?"

"That I don't know. But I bought one piece of information—it cost a lot."

Li Rufeng smiled. "Old Huang, why the suspense? Why squeeze 'Australian toothpaste'? We won't short you a single coin!"

Huang Qi chuckled and took out a slip of paper from his breast.

"I'm not playing hard to get; this slip was hard to come by."

Li Rufeng took it in hand. It was a water-stained slip of paper with blurred ink marks, but the general writing was visible. It was a reservation slip from Qiwei Station.

As Heliansheng's chief escort, he was more familiar with his employer's system than anyone. This was a bearer ticket reservation slip for a first-class cabin on a Qiwei Shipping passenger vessel. These cabins were fully equipped and luxuriously decorated. Besides two main passengers, they could accommodate two servants—a first choice for many officials and nobles on long voyages.

The reservation slip had no specific date or voyage number, only marked as valid for the entire year of Chongzhen 10 / 1637. With this reservation slip, one could go to any Qiwei shipping office at any time, give the code word, and after verification, immediately purchase the nearest available cabin on the desired route.

"How did you get this?"

"Bought it from a little eunuch close to Yang Tianliang." Huang Qi looked rather proud. "This slip was tucked in clothing and accidentally got water-damaged. Yang Tianliang sent him to Tianjin to get a replacement. Once the kid got the new one, he sold me this ruined one!"

"Impressive." Li Rufeng smiled. He studied the reservation slip, somewhat incredulous. What did he want this reservation slip for? Could he be preparing to flee?

Though Qiwei Shipping had multiple river and coastal routes, in the north, the actual destinations were quite limited. From Tianjin, the coastal route went to Shandong, Nanzhili, Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan. The inland route only went from Tongzhou along the Grand Canal to Hangzhou and the wharves along the way.
