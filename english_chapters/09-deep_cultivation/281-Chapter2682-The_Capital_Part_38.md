# Chapter 2682: The Capital (Part 38)

Master Wang showed great concern for Zhou Juli's illness. This concern was not limited to inviting doctors and asking for medicine but went a step further to suggest to Immortal Zhou that he currently had only one child, and a girl at that, belonging to "high risk" regarding heirs. Jieyi had served him for more than two years without getting pregnant, so he suggested whether he should see a doctor and conveniently take a few more concubines.

Immortal Zhou pulled a long face at Master Wang's suggestion to check his body, seemingly very dissatisfied with someone doubting his sexual ability, but he was quite interested in increasing family members. Thus, a few days later, Master Wang sent a small sedan chair carrying a girl named "Yourong" [Has Capacity/Tolerance].

Although Yourong was bought from Yangzhou, she was an out-and-out Shandong big girl. Knowing Hearthstone Immortal liked tall and sturdy women with unbound feet, Master Wang specially sent people to Yangzhou to pick the lowest grade among the "thin horses" in various broker houses.

The so-called lowest grade thin horses were maids specially cultivated for kitchen work, sewing, and washing. They were also cultivated from childhood, with considerable requirements for appearance and conversation, but because they had to do rough work, their feet were not bound, and their bodies were sturdier.

This Yourong was an outstanding one among them. Knowing Yourong's parents were still alive, Master Wang immediately brought her parents to the capital as well, placing another nail in Hearthstone Immortal's bed without any suspense.

However, Yourong's arrival caused a small storm in Hearthstone Immortal's home. Zhiling and Jieyi had sold themselves together back then and later came to the Zhou family together. Not only did they have the friendship of "same batch," but both also came from small families in the same hometown. They could talk easily, and their sisterly affection was quite stable. This newcomer Yourong was different; not only was she good-looking, but she was also literate. Since childhood, she learned the routines of men and women in the courtyards. Deploying various little tricks, she steadily occupied the position of the master bedroom in a few months.

How could Jieyi swallow this breath? Although she was also a concubine, adhering to the concept of "first entry is greater," plus being Zhou Juli's foster mother, she inevitably showed Yourong some color.

Yourong, being a newcomer, could only lie low temporarily. After a few months, seeing her favor not diminishing while Hearthstone Immortal was obviously cold to Jieyi, she turned her face to oppose Jieyi.

Jieyi was born in a commoner's family after all; how could she be an opponent of a woman trained in such a nest of wind and moon? After a few rounds, she was obviously at a disadvantage. So relying on being seemingly Zhou Juli's foster mother and the de facto mistress of the house, she started to create difficulties for Yourong everywhere. Yourong, however, didn't buy it at all.

The two came and went, performing a miniature version of a palace intrigue drama in Mr. Zhou's home, making Mr. Zhou's head full of bumps. In order to avoid the irreconcilable contradictions in the "Papal Court" [household], he could only mix with Zhou Lezhi in the study day and night, even sleeping in the study. Thus, rumors of Mr. Zhou being fond of the "southern wind" [men] spread out again—of course, this was not the first time such rumors appeared.

Mr. Zhou was burnt in the head and rotten in the forehead [overwhelmed], no longer caring about the matter of going south. One day he asked Liu Zhao for a plan. Liu Zhao smiled: "Why should the Master be troubled? Whether Yourong or Jieyi, both are the Teacher's slaves. If you, the Elder, are willing to give each forty strokes of the board, I guarantee the home will be peaceful without valid incidents henceforth."

"How can this be done? Let alone who is right or wrong, even if there is a real fault, one can't beat people casually. Wouldn't this become domestic violence?"

Zhou Lezhi was full of disdain at this moment. Turns out the Teacher was a soft ear [henpecked]; two girls could toss him like this. Fortunately there was no legitimate wife; otherwise, he would be a master who kneeled through the footrest!

Disdain aside, his studies grew greatly in this stage. Because Mr. Zhou was unwilling to go to the rear residence, staying in the study day and night, he used education as a pastime.

Wang Yehao was also overwhelmed here. His wishful thinking originally calculated quite appropriately: on one hand, use the Tian family to collect the Australians' properties in Guangzhou Prefecture, cutting off their money and grain; on the other hand, instigate Wang Zunde to use troops against Lingao, destroying their nest; then send people himself to collect the Qiankun Mirror to achieve total merit.

However, what the Guangdong Tangbao [official gazette] transmitted was news of the government army's great defeat. This unexpected news truly made Wang Yehao somewhat panicked. Although the dynasty's soldiers and generals were often at a disadvantage when dealing with the cavalry in the north, how could mere border corner sea bandits be mentioned in the same breath? Since Junior Guardian Qi [Qi Jiguang] pacified the Japanese plague, the court either suppressed or pacified; when had there ever been such a defeat? Moving the power of the whole province, gathering tens of thousands of elite soldiers, advancing by land and sea, infantry and cavalry moving together, plus Western bird guns in the ranks and Red Barbarian cannons suppressing the formation, actually couldn't beat five hundred Shorn-hair Thieves, even let them capture more than ten thousand prisoners alive, and further trapped the Commander-in-Chief in Qiongzhou. It was truly outrageous.

As the highest chief of the Office of Transmission, the gathering place of the whole country's memorial subjects and gazettes, Wang Yehao knew the military power of various provinces quite well. He knew these tens of thousands of troops were almost the entire family capital of Guangdong. This disastrous defeat was not only a problem of losing soldiers and generals and wasting military pay but might also induce riots by the Li people in Guangdong due to the emptiness of military force. The consequences were unimaginable.

Wang Zunde was in danger!

He closed the memorial subject and put it on the table. The sense of powerlessness from failed planning intertwined with strong confusion, making him doubt whether he truly controlled the overall situation. Since the court troops were defeated in Lingao, those Australian Shorn-hair Thieves would inevitably strengthen their guard. Wishing to obtain the Qiankun Mirror unknowingly again became impossible.

"Could this Qiankun Mirror truly be so powerful?" Wang Yehao sighed in a low voice. Before, he thought Hearthstone Immortal was blowing nonsense; now it seemed maybe there was really some truth.

"Subordinate dares not speak rashly, but up and down the court and wild, all spread that the Australian Shorn-hair Thieves' firearms are extremely sharp." Jin Wenchi hesitated again and again before probing, "Master, for such a big matter, I'm afraid it can't be hidden from Mr. Zhou's side, right?"

Now whether in the court hall or the market well, various news about the Australian Shorn-hair Thieves was increasing. Rather than letting him know by himself, it was better to actively process the news a bit before telling him.

Wang Yehao smoothed his train of thought and instructed: "This matter requires foolproof preparation. Let this Official think about how to phrase it. On Mr. Zhou's side, find a way to make him unable to get away. Also, send news to Liu Sha, let him look: if there are those familiar with the inside information of the Shorn-hair Thieves, don't be stingy with silver."

"Yes, Master." Jin Wenchi didn't leave immediately but lowered his voice: "Master, there is one more thing that needs pre-planning..."

"What thing?"

"Mr. Cunsi failed in suppressing bandits this time, losing the army and territory; I fear it will be hard to explain to the court. He is advanced in age, and heard his body bones are not too good either. News came from Liu Sha a few days ago saying he is already bedridden; I fear the day of not rising is near..."

"What do you want to say?" Wang Yehao understood his meaning somewhat.

"Mr. Cunsi leaving his post is probably just a matter of morning or evening. There are rumors in the court saying the Master might supervise Liangguang..."

Wang Yehao also heard this rumor. He was still hesitating; if he operated appropriately, there was more than eighty percent certainty.

Although the Commissioner of Transmission was one of the Nine Ministers, becoming a border-sealing official [Viceroy/Governor] was one of the highest ideals of being an official, probably only second to entering the Grand Secretariat and becoming a Chancellor.

"If the Sacred Intent is truly so, what does the Teacher think?"

"Master advancing further from the top of a hundred-foot pole to take up a border post is naturally gratifying and congratulatory. It's just that this place of Liangguang is largely not a good place to go."

Wang Yehao nodded slightly, signaling him to continue.

"Nowadays in the land of Liangguang, south has Shorn-hair Thieves rising, west has Yao and Dong tribes encircling, east has Red Barbarians patrolling. Three sides harass; it cannot be peaceful for long. The Shorn-hair Thieves have become a major trouble; if the government fails to clear and suppress, it will inevitably suffer their backlash. Fear that not long after there will be an act of invasion. Confucius said: enter not a dangerous state, dwell not in a chaotic state. In this student's humble opinion, the position of Liangguang is easy to lose responsibility but hard to have achievements; it is truly a miserable policy. The Master came from regular Jinshii but didn't enter the Hanlin Academy; according to convention, I fear it's hard to enter the Cabinet. If you can take up a post in a region, accumulating popularity and seniority, to control a Ministry in the future wouldn't be a bad smooth road. Although Liangguang cannot be gone to, Jiangnan and Zhejiang have potential. Occupying all advantages of geography and human harmony, if operated properly, should not be a difficult matter."

"Teacher's analysis penetrates to the lining, making this Official see light suddenly. Only, does the Teacher not know the rule of avoidance?" Wang Yehao heard this and smiled helplessly. "I cannot go to Zhejiang. If speaking of Nanzhili, I fear my power is insufficient."

Jin Wenchi was stunned. He was only a Xiucai after all; his knowledge of court rules was limited: "So saying, this Liangguang must be gone to."

"There are no less than thirty Viceroys and Governors in the world. Nowadays, those who can rule by hanging down arches [doing nothing], there is probably not a single one." Wang Yehao sighed, "Although Liangguang has all kinds of worries, generally it can still be considered peaceful—as long as we can deal with the Shorn-hair Thieves."

Thinking carefully, was there a more suitable candidate than himself to deal with Shorn-hair Thieves? He held a genuine "Shorn-hair Thief" in his hand. Going to Liangguang, although dangerous, was also a good opportunity. Especially Guangzhou, which was a port for going to sea and trading with foreigners, no less than the affluent lands of Jiangnan. If he obtained this term, he could greatly enrich his financial power. Paving the road for his future prospects...

"We will plan this matter at length." His mind was made up. "Mr. Jin, go outside to collect news of Liangguang; gather all whether official or private, especially news involving Shorn-hair Thieves and Guangzhou."

"Yes, this student will arrange it."

After Jin Wenchi left, Wang Yehao smoothed the matters again. Pondering his own countermeasures, such speech in the court indicated that whether the Emperor or the Cabinet, both had this intention. However, taking over at this moment was absolutely not a good thing. The current situation in Guangdong was chaotic; not only were tens of thousands of troops trapped in Qiongzhou unable to return, but Shorn-hair Thieves might also come to harass. At that time, such a huge mess would have to be cleaned up by himself; slight carelessness would mean losing the whole game.

He called Liu Zhao and asked: "Is there new news from Liu Sha's side?"

"Liu Sha reported yesterday: Viceroy Wang already went to Zhaoqing to recuperate." Liu Zhao said, "Heard his body bones are very bad. In addition..." He lowered his voice to a mosquito buzz: "Shorn-hair Thieves already landed at the Pearl River Estuary, pressing upon the outside of Guangzhou City—Guangzhou City has closed all four gates, enforcing martial law..."

"What?!" This news startled him greatly. "What about those forts? The navy?"

"All destroyed by Shorn-hair Thieves..." Liu Sha [Zhao?] said, handing over the report. "The firearms on the Shorn-hair Thieves' gunships are fierce; in less than half a day's effort, they killed their way into the Pearl River Estuary."
