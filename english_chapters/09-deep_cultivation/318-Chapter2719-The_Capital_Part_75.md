# Chapter 2719: The Capital (Part 75)

Li Rufeng smiled. This Huang Qi was quite something!

What had Second Master Qin said that brought about this "house cleaning"? Whether it was related to Leng Ningyun, they couldn't tell. However, Second Master Qin had indeed come to provide information about Senator Leng being on the official road northwest of the capital.

Could that be why the other side killed Second Master Qin? Looking at the tongue being cut out, it certainly seemed like a warning to others: "Don't talk too much."

But their search in the northwest of the capital had yielded little. The escort masters sent to investigate could only verify that such a cart and group of people had passed through. Whether Senator Leng was actually in the cart, there were no witnesses.

Now Second Master Qin had suddenly been killed, seemingly confirming the information he had provided. Moreover, Second Master Qin's backer was Liu Sha, their biggest suspect.

Several threads of clues intertwined, seemingly pointing in a direction, though still dim.

But even with this lead, their original difficulty remained. There were too many places to go on the official road northwest of the capital. They had no way to investigate each one.

Having a lead was practically the same as having none.

At this point, Chen Cui brought useful news: Cao Sheng of Zhangjiawan and Managing Eunuch Cao of Nanyuan were indeed connected.

"...They're both from Wei County in Daming Prefecture. In terms of kinship, they're uncles and nephews of the same clan. When Cao Sheng first came to the capital to make a living, Eunuch Cao helped him a lot. Later, when Cao Sheng made it in Zhangjiawan, he remained very respectful toward Eunuch Cao. The two have always had a good relationship."

Upon hearing this, Li Rufeng immediately added this thread to the mind map on the wall. Now Liu Sha–Cao Sheng–Eunuch Cao–Liu Xiaobian–Third Master Qin–Second Master Qin–Yang Tianliang... all these people were connected.

These lines, vague as they were, all seemed to point toward someone. Now Li Rufeng could say with certainty: This group had a conspiracy. But he couldn't determine if the conspiracy was related to Leng Ningyun.

The two faced each other in silence for a long while before Li Rufeng said, "I think we don't need to worry about Second Master Qin's situation. Since we know Liu Sha is the most suspicious, let's make him the breakthrough. Have Min Zhanlian's squad secretly kidnap him."

If Min Zhanlian handled this, it wouldn't implicate Heliansheng or Delong. Even if Liu Sha wasn't involved, they could simply silence him and wash their hands of it.

"But once we move on Liu Sha, we'll alert the enemy. With Manager Leng's whereabouts still unknown, I'm afraid we'll spook them," Li Rufeng sighed. "And I'm worried..."

"Worried that Liu Sha doesn't actually know where Senator Leng is?"

"Yes," Li Rufeng nodded. "In an ordinary kidnapping case, grabbing the key figure naturally leads to the hostage. But with their setup—people divided into multiple groups—grabbing just one might not reveal the actual location."

"Let's proceed on two fronts. First, have Min Zhanlian continue to secretly investigate Liu Sha and see if he can uncover more people. Second, we continue searching for Senator Leng's whereabouts at suspicious locations." Liao Sanniang narrowed her eyes. "I have a vague feeling that Senator Leng is still in the capital and hasn't been moved far."

"You mean..."

"Based on current leads, Nanyuan is the most suspicious place," Lady Sanniang said. "We still need to probe Nanyuan!"

In the past, they hadn't ignored this place, but first, it was too large to search easily; second, they had made inquiries through intermediaries and gotten no useful information.

But combined with the recently gathered intelligence, if someone was secretly manipulating the capital's urban foxes and social rats, then the information gathered might not be true. Combined with the suspicious points about Yang Tianliang in the intelligence, the Liu Xiaobian case, and the eunuchs mixed into the bandit group... the likelihood of the hostage being hidden in Nanyuan increased significantly.

Since they needed to investigate again, they couldn't follow the old path. They had to send people specifically for this.

Nanyuan covered an extremely large area. It had "sea households" (*haihu*) responsible for watching over the gardens, eunuch offices in charge of management, and guardhouses where soldiers were stationed... These buildings and structures were scattered across this 120-*li* wilderness. Without a reliable guide, even a world-class hero would be helpless.

When Li Rufeng was training in Lingao, a Senator officer from the Reconnaissance General Bureau had specifically mentioned the importance of "guides." Without guides, assault and reconnaissance operations could not be effectively executed.

But Heliansheng had no reliable contacts inside. Li Rufeng and Lady Sanniang discussed for a long time but couldn't find a suitable candidate.

"We can only borrow an outsider," Li Rufeng said.

"You mean Third Master Qin?"

"Since Third Master Qin is very familiar with the Nanyuan managing eunuch, isn't he a ready-made choice?"

"I'm afraid this Eunuch Cao is probably also connected to the case..." Liao Sanniang said worriedly.

Li Rufeng's face twitched. "We might as well go all in..."

"Absolutely not." Seeing the fierce light in his eyes, Liao Sanniang quickly advised, "If we really tear off all pretenses, we won't be able to survive in this capital either."

Li Rufeng paced around the room several times, then suddenly said, "I've got it!"

"What?"

"I've thought of someone." The person Li Rufeng spoke of was one of the common types in the capital: monks and Daoists.

The old saying goes: "Officials sent out from the capital; monks and Daoists entering the capital." Monks and Daoists from other places, whether they were ordained clergy or wild charlatans pretending to speak for gods and Buddhas, as long as circumstances brought them to the capital and they were lucky, they could rise to prominence in just a few years.

This person was a Daoist who had entered the capital. His surname was Wu, his given name Cheng. He had come to the capital with his master in the early Tianqi era. For a while, he followed his master and lived very comfortably.

He hadn't expected the Tianqi Emperor to die and the current Emperor to ascend. His master's patron fell out of favor in officialdom, and his master also fell on hard times. After much turmoil, his master, disheartened, returned to his hometown to live out his days. Wu Cheng, having seen the prosperity of the capital and unwilling to return home, stayed on to get by.

He had been scraping by ever since. Now Wu Cheng hang his single (*guadan*, lodged temporarily) at a "eunuch temple" in the capital. The capital had many eunuchs who had to leave the palace when they grew old. The wealthy ones retired in comfort at home; those with families returned to their hometowns to be cared for. But most eunuchs came from poor backgrounds, and only a tiny minority rose to power after entering the palace. So most could only seek shelter in various temples and monasteries. Thus, the capital had temples specifically serving retired eunuchs. Eunuchs only had to donate a sum of "incense money" or "lamp oil money" to retire in the temple; after death, the monks or Daoists would handle the burial.

Though Wu Cheng was nominally "lodging," in reality the temple didn't provide his food and drink—not even a place to live. It just gave him a "title." Because of this connection, his main activities were among the capital's eunuch community. He managed to get by.

"Wu Cheng is very familiar with the eunuchs, especially the 'black eunuchs' of Nanyuan," Li Rufeng said. "After all, he's not really a famous Daoist. Eunuchs with any status would look down their noses at him. Only the eunuchs guarding Nanyuan would believe in his Daoist arts. So he often hangs around Nanyuan and knows the inside very well. There's just one thing..."

"What?"

"This person is very familiar with Third Master Qin. If we hire him, Third Master Qin will definitely find out."

This was indeed a concern. Liao Sanniang thought for a moment and lightly struck the table with her fist. "So be it. We'll also 'invite a God of Wealth.'"

Liao Sanniang's idea was to secretly kidnap Wu Cheng, lure him with heavy rewards to act as a guide to find the person. Whether or not they found Leng Ningyun, they would secretly detain him afterward, waiting until everything was settled before deciding to release or silence him.

"Very well, that's the only way," Li Rufeng nodded in agreement. He suddenly sighed, "Working here, we're still so timid! Everything we do has to consider social connections and *Jianghu* honor."

"If we could really act without restraint, what would you need us escort masters for?" Liao Sanniang sighed. "It's precisely because the *Jianghu* exists that we have value."

Li Rufeng was startled. "I didn't expect Lady Sanniang to have such insight!"

"Look at you," Liao Sanniang smiled. "Anyone can see the general trend of the world, as long as they don't cover their own eyes. The *Jianghu* can only exist in times of peace. In chaotic times, who cares about *Jianghu* rules!"

These years, the world had become increasingly chaotic, and the escort masters felt it most keenly. Even though they were in this "first place of virtue," seemingly still enjoying a false "peaceful scene," once they stepped outside the city gates and walked on the official roads, they could feel that the "rules" on which their founding masters had relied were crumbling.

Li Rufeng's heart stirred at her words. Fortunately, they were all subordinates of the "Australians." In this age when everyone walked on thin ice, they had a refuge to pin their hopes on.

"At least we work for the Australians!" he said with a forced smile. "When escort masters really can't make it anymore, at worst we'll go to Guangdong to work as security for factories or wealthy households!"

Liao Sanniang smiled with closed lips. "It won't come to that. You and I can at least be 'cadres.' It's just that the escort trade... probably won't exist anymore." She sighed softly, as if with infinite melancholy.

The information Huang Qi provided was quickly relayed to each squad. Because the people he mentioned were all within Min Zhanlian's surveillance scope, his work suddenly became very important. Fearing they were short-handed, Li Rufeng dispatched another group to Tongzhou and other places to await his orders.

To cope better, he discussed with Min Zhanlian and agreed that Min Zhanlian's entire squad would move to Tongzhou, leaving only two people in Zhangjiawan to relay messages. Li Rufeng's side would have people closely monitor the outer city and Nanyuan.

After much deliberation, Min Zhanlian believed the key to the matter lay in this Liu Sha. This man was likely the front-line commander. Capturing him would be like seizing the "key point" on a board game.

But precisely because his role was so important, making a move on him would shake the entire situation—especially when Leng Ningyun's whereabouts were still unknown. Min Zhanlian's thinking now differed from the beginning. He not only wanted to rescue Leng Ningyun but also wanted to use this opportunity to uncover the mastermind behind the scenes.

Naturally, he couldn't tell his subordinates this, so he only said it wasn't advisable to alert the enemy yet. He instructed Little Five to keep eyes on Liu Sha.
