# Chapter 2733: The Capital (Part 90)

"The Master is right," Yanhong said. "Back in our countryside, when the head of a wealthy household dies, they hold an even grander funeral. If they don't, creditors assume the family is on its last legs, and they all come swarming to demand repayment!"

"What nonsense are you spouting? Slap yourself!" Hexiang scolded under her breath.

Only then did Yanhong realize that speaking of "the head of household dying" at year's end was terribly inauspicious—it even sounded like she was cursing the Master. Panicking, she slapped herself twice and was about to drop to her knees.

"Enough, enough," Leng Ningyun waved dismissively. "What's the fuss over a few words? We don't concern ourselves with such things. Let's finish eating, then quickly list all the New Year preparations and send people to handle them one by one. I'm afraid neither of you will be sleeping tonight."

"Staying up is no trouble—consider it an early New Year's Eve vigil," Hexiang said. "Unfortunately, with so much happening this year, we missed our chance to arrange a theater troupe and head chef. I don't know if there's still time."

"If it can be arranged, do so. Worst case, just pay extra," Leng Ningyun said. Even as he spoke, his entire body gradually went slack. Both women started in alarm and hurried to support him, only to discover he had fallen asleep. They quickly helped him change and put him to bed.

When he awoke, it was nearly noon on the thirtieth—New Year's Eve. Leng Ningyun rose from bed feeling refreshed and full of energy.

There was a mountain of things to do, but unfortunately it was year's end. Whether meeting people or handling affairs, everything would have to wait until after the fifth day. As for New Year's Day greetings, wealthy and noble families sent servants bearing calling cards—the principals themselves never appeared—so there would be no opportunity to "discuss matters."

Calculating thus, there was nothing to do outside the residence. As for inside, Hexiang and Yanhong managed the inner household while Wu Kaidi managed Delong—all running smoothly. Nothing required his personal attention.

As for the aftermath of the kidnapping case, he had received a telegram from Guangzhou before returning. The matter didn't require his involvement; he only needed to submit the relevant reports, and it would be concluded. The specific pursuit of the Stone Elder Group would be handled by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

So all he needed to do was write his report.

He had written one such report immediately after his rescue, but that had been hasty and cursory. Now, back at Delong, he could carefully recall everything from those twenty-odd days, especially organizing the contents of his several conversations with "Mr. Yue." Any clue might prove valuable to the field bureau's further investigation.

In retrospect, this mysterious Mr. Yue was indeed worth investigating. But one thing was abundantly clear: Mr. Yue had kidnapped him to write letters—not demanding ransom, but requesting peace talks with the Senate. This was stated explicitly in the letters. He had written three in all, with similar content.

But the letter Delong received was, first, not written by him; and second, its content had been altered to a ransom demand for 100,000 taels.

Yet the token accompanying the letter was indeed from his personal effects.

One didn't need exceptional intelligence to see from this that the kidnapping gang was not of one mind.

Those at the top had planned to use him as a hostage to force the Senate into negotiations; those below saw him as a treasure to exchange for 100,000 taels.

Fortunately, Leng Ningyun reflected, the court's bounty for Kun officials was a mere 3,000 taels—quite unattractive compared to the bank's tens of thousands. If he weren't a "bank owner," he would probably have been sold to the authorities long ago.

Viewed this way, the Stone Elder Group might seem mysterious and unfathomable, but their internal divisions were severe. This could well prove the perfect opportunity to annihilate them.

He wrote as he thought, his pen flowing like the wind. Within half an hour, the report was complete and placed in a security envelope. Hexiang would encode and transmit it that evening.

With that done, he left the residence and went to inspect Delong.

The bank too was decorated with lanterns and festoons. Clerks and servants rushed about with their tasks. The shop was filled with New Year cheer, the former gloom completely swept away.

It was lunchtime. Leng Ningyun made a point of observing. Since it was New Year's Eve, even lunch was lavish. Each eight-immortals table held a large warming pot—the so-called "first-class pot"—with shredded cabbage at the bottom, topped with braised pork, meatballs, chicken and duck, quail eggs... The pot was packed full. Though none of the ingredients were particularly expensive, in a place where corpses littered the roads and dozens froze or starved to death on the streets every night, this could fairly be called a supreme delicacy.

As usual, there would be another formal dinner on New Year's Eve. Following Leng Ningyun's instructions, the bank's kitchen had made this year's feast even more sumptuous than previous years.

"Grand Manager." Wu Kaidi approached suddenly and gave him a meaningful look.

Leng Ningyun knew there must be something important. He made his way to the counting room and asked in a low voice, "What is it?"

"Someone from Eunuch Yang's side has come."

"From Eunuch Yang? Or..."

Delong's usual dealings with Eunuch Yang were conducted through Yang Tianliang. The eunuch rarely sent people personally.

"No, it's someone from Eunuch Yang's inner circle. You've met him, sir—his name is Baoyu."

Baoyu wasn't a eunuch, merely an attendant in Eunuch Yang's household. Generally speaking, the most trusted people around great eunuchs were junior eunuchs, rarely outsiders. The reason for favoring junior eunuchs was the same as why emperors favored eunuchs—the belief that castrated men with no heirs had only themselves to rely on and thus served more loyally.

Though Baoyu was an attendant to Eunuch Yang and counted among his confidants, his level of trust was considerably lower. Still, Leng Ningyun followed the principle of burning incense wherever there was a buddha, and usually treated him well. Since Baoyu was third among his brothers, he addressed him as Third Brother Bao.

Today was New Year's Eve. Unless something extremely urgent had occurred, Eunuch Yang would never send someone to find him.

"Please show him to the outer study for tea," Leng Ningyun said. "I'll be right there."

The attendant was about thirty years old, wearing a brand-new gray cotton-faced old sheepskin robe with a vest over it, a folded-brim cap, and horn boots. Upon seeing Leng Ningyun, he immediately bowed in greeting.

"Manager Leng!"

"We're old acquaintances. No need for formalities." Leng Ningyun was gracious. "Please, sit."

Baoyu was an attendant under a powerful eunuch. When running errands, not just a mere merchant but even ordinary capital officials had to treat him politely. So he didn't refuse, only bowing slightly before taking a guest seat.

Making social calls on New Year's Eve was improper; arriving suddenly was already quite presumptuous. Baoyu understood this much. After sitting down, he thought for a moment and said with an uncomfortable expression, "Manager Leng, normally there's no reason to disturb you on New Year's Eve. But this matter is so important I had no choice. Please forgive me."

"Third Brother Bao, please. When business is urgent, who cares about the time!"

"Yes," Baoyu said. "Eunuch Yang says that ordinarily, with Manager Leng having escaped his ordeal, he should have come personally to congratulate you. But the palace has been so busy lately he couldn't get away. So he sent me first to offer congratulations. When he has time, he'll host a banquet to help you recover from your fright."

"Please thank Eunuch Yang for his kindness," Leng Ningyun smiled.

"Eunuch Yang also says that though Delong was sealed, he's already asked someone to speak with Prefect Zhong. The seal should be lifted after the New Year, and you can reopen for business."

Leng Ningyun assumed an expression of joyful surprise. "How kind of Eunuch Yang to go to such trouble! I was just worrying about this—this is truly sending charcoal in the snow! Please convey my thanks to Eunuch Yang, Third Brother Bao. There will be generous thanks another day."

Now came the main topic. Baoyu swallowed, apparently finding the words difficult to say. He thought for a while before speaking.

"There's one matter, very urgent. Eunuch Yang asks that you definitely find a way to handle it."

"Oh? What is it, so urgent?" Leng Ningyun sensed something was off. Usually, when Eunuch Yang needed something done, he simply sent someone to tell him directly. This "find a way to handle it" carried a tone of negotiation, a hint of request—a considerably softer manner.

"The 100,000 taels that Little Eunuch Yang deposited at Delong before the year..."

"Yes, that's been taken care of. I've already given Little Eunuch Yang the deposit slip and commission."

"Eunuch Yang's meaning is: can it be withdrawn immediately? The situation in the palace has changed, and he has an urgent need."

Leng Ningyun had expected that Eunuch Yang would send someone to withdraw the 100,000 taels the moment they reopened. But he hadn't expected the eunuch to be so urgent as to send someone specifically on New Year's Eve.

For a matter involving 100,000 taels, logically it should be Little Eunuch Yang appearing in person. Even if Little Eunuch Yang was unavailable, at least one of his close eunuch attendants should have come. But the person sent was merely an attendant, and his manner was evasive.

Something was very wrong here.

Leng Ningyun said, "Yes, yes. Eunuch Yang wants to withdraw—naturally that's no problem. It's just..." He adopted a troubled expression. "Currently, both Delong's vault and accounting office are under Shuntian Prefecture's seals. These are imperial seals—unless an official comes with orders to open them, removing them without authorization is a serious crime."

With the vault sealed, they couldn't access silver. With the accounting room sealed, they couldn't issue notes. These were perfectly legitimate reasons. Even if the visitor were a top Eastern Depot agent or a Brocade Guard commander, he would still have to follow this procedure to withdraw.

"However, the moment the imperial seal is lifted, I'll prepare the silver immediately. Whether cash or banknotes, it will be delivered at once."

Baoyu seemed somewhat disappointed. He said in a low voice, "Manager Leng, don't you have 100,000 taels on hand?"

"Third Brother Bao!" Leng Ningyun made a helpless expression. "One hundred thousand taels! At most, this bank's deposits don't even reach 130,000 or 140,000. How could I personally have 100,000?"

"But..." Baoyu seemed to find it very difficult to say. "I heard that when you, sir, were in distress, silver was specially transported from Delong to raise ransom—100,000 taels..."

Leng Ningyun's heart froze. How did Eunuch Yang know about this? But this absolutely could not be admitted, because unauthorized opening of an imperial seal was a grave crime. Even as a rumor, it would cause endless trouble.

So he said in a very earnest tone, "That's merely a rumor! If I had that much personal property, I would have given it to the kidnappers to free myself. Why would I have suffered until now?"

Baoyu couldn't counter this and had to concede, "Very well. This request may have been asking too much."
