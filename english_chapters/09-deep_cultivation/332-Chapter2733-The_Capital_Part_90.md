# Chapter 2733: The Capital (Part 89)

"The Master is right," Yanhong said. "In our countryside, when the head of a wealthy household dies, they hold an even grander funeral. If they don't, creditors will think the family can't hold on, and they'll all come demanding repayment!"

"What nonsense are you spouting? Slap yourself!" Hexiang scolded in a low voice.

Only then did Yanhong realize that talking about "the head of household dying" at year's end was terribly inauspicious and even seemed like cursing the Master. She panicked, slapped herself twice, and was about to kneel.

"Enough, enough," Leng Ningyun waved dismissively. "What's the big deal about a few words? We don't care about such things. Let's finish eating, then quickly list all the New Year preparations and send people to handle them one by one. I'm afraid you won't be sleeping tonight."

"Staying up is fine—consider it early New Year's Eve vigil," Hexiang said. "Unfortunately, with so much happening this year, we missed arranging for a theater troupe and head chef. I don't know if there's still time."

"If we can arrange it, do so. Worst case, just pay extra," Leng Ningyun said. As he spoke, his whole body gradually went limp. Both women were startled and hurried to support him, only to discover he'd fallen asleep. They quickly helped him change and put him to bed for rest.

When he awoke, it was nearly noon on the thirtieth—New Year's Eve. Leng Ningyun got out of bed feeling refreshed and energized.

There was a pile of things to do, but unfortunately it was year's end. Whether meeting people or handling affairs, everything had to wait until after the fifth day. As for New Year's Day greetings, wealthy and noble families sent servants with calling cards—the principals themselves didn't appear—so there was no opportunity to "discuss matters."

Calculating thus, there was nothing to do outside. As for inside, Hexiang and Yanhong managed the inner residence, Wu Kaidi managed Delong—all running smoothly. He had nothing that needed his personal attention.

As for the kidnapping case aftermath, he'd received a telegram from Guangzhou before returning. The matter didn't require his involvement; he only needed to submit the relevant reports, and it would be concluded. The specific pursuit of the Stone Elder Group would be handled by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

So all he needed to do was write his report.

He'd written one such report after his rescue, but that had been hasty and simple. Now back at Delong, he could carefully recall everything from those twenty-plus days, especially organizing the contents of his several conversations with "Mr. Yue." Any clue might help the field bureau's further investigation.

In retrospect, this mysterious Mr. Yue was indeed worth digging into. But one thing was very clear: Mr. Yue had kidnapped him to write letters—not demanding ransom, but requesting peace talks with the Senate. This was explicit in the letters. He'd written three letters in all, with similar content.

But the letter Delong received was first, not written by him; and second, its content had changed to a ransom demand for 100,000 taels.

Yet the token that came with the letter was indeed from his personal effects.

One didn't need much intelligence to see from this that the kidnapping gang wasn't of one mind.

Those at the top planned to use him as a hostage to force the Senate to negotiate; those below saw him as a treasure to exchange for 100,000 taels.

Fortunately, Leng Ningyun thought, the court's bounty for "Short-Hair officials" was only a paltry 3,000 taels—quite unattractive compared to the bank's tens of thousands. If he weren't a "bank owner," he'd probably have been sold to the authorities long ago.

Thinking of it this way, the Stone Elder Group might seem mysterious and unfathomable, but their internal divisions were severe. This could well be the perfect opportunity to annihilate them!

He wrote as he thought, pen flowing like the wind. In half an hour, the report was done and placed in a security envelope. Hexiang would encode and transmit it that evening.

With that done, he left the residence and went to have a look at Delong.

Delong too was decorated with lanterns and festoons. Clerks and servants rushed about with tasks. The shop was filled with New Year cheer, the former gloom completely swept away.

It was lunchtime. Leng Ningyun specifically went to observe. Since it was New Year's Eve, even lunch was lavish. Each eight-immortals table had a large warming pot—the so-called "first-class pot"—with cabbage shreds at the bottom, topped with braised pork, meatballs, chicken and duck, quail eggs... The pot was packed full. Though none of the ingredients were particularly expensive, in a place where corpses littered the roads and dozens froze or starved to death on the streets every night, this could fairly be called a supreme delicacy.

As usual, there would be another formal dinner on New Year's Eve. Following Leng Ningyun's instructions, the bank's kitchen made this year's New Year's Eve dinner even more sumptuous than previous years.

"Grand Manager." Wu Kaidi suddenly approached and gave him a meaningful look.

Leng Ningyun knew there must be something important. He came to the counting room and asked in a low voice, "What is it?"

"Someone from Eunuch Yang's side has come."

"From Eunuch Yang? Or..."

Delong's usual dealings with Eunuch Yang were conducted through Yang Tianliang. Eunuch Yang rarely sent people personally.

"No, it's someone from Eunuch Yang's inner circle. You've met him, sir—his name is Baoyu."

Baoyu wasn't a eunuch, just an attendant in Eunuch Yang's household. Generally speaking, the most trusted people around great eunuchs were junior eunuchs, rarely outsiders. The reason for favoring junior eunuchs was the same as why emperors favored eunuchs—believing that crippled men with no heirs had only themselves to rely on, and thus served more loyally.

Though Baoyu was an attendant to Eunuch Yang and counted among his confidants, his level of trust was considerably lower. Still, Leng Ningyun followed the principle of burning incense wherever there was a buddha, and usually treated him well. Since he was third among his brothers, he called him Third Brother Bao.

Today was New Year's Eve. Unless something extremely urgent had happened, Eunuch Yang would never send someone to find him.

"Please show him to the outer study for tea," Leng Ningyun said. "I'll be right there."

The attendant was about thirty years old, wearing a brand-new gray cotton-faced old sheepskin robe with a vest over it, a folded-brim cap, and horn boots. Seeing Leng Ningyun, he immediately bowed in greeting.

"Manager Leng!"

"We're old acquaintances. No need for formalities." Leng Ningyun was very courteous. "Please sit."

Baoyu was an attendant under a powerful eunuch. When running errands, not just a mere merchant but even ordinary capital officials had to treat him politely. So he didn't refuse, only bowing slightly before taking a guest seat.

Making social calls on New Year's Eve was improper; arriving suddenly was already quite presumptuous. Baoyu understood this much. After sitting down, he thought for a moment and said with a rather difficult expression, "Manager Leng! Normally, there's no reason to disturb you on New Year's Eve. But this matter is so important I had no choice. Please forgive me."

"Third Brother Bao, please. With urgent business, who cares about the time!"

"Yes," Baoyu said. "Eunuch Yang says that ordinarily, with Manager Leng having escaped his ordeal, he should have come personally to congratulate you. But the palace has been so busy lately he couldn't get away. So he sent me first to offer congratulations. When he has time, he'll host a banquet to help you recover from your fright."

"Please thank Eunuch Yang for his kindness," Leng Ningyun smiled.

"Eunuch Yang also says that though Delong was sealed, he's already asked someone to speak with Prefect Zhong. The seal should be lifted after the New Year, and you can reopen for business."

Leng Ningyun put on a look of joyful surprise. "How kind of Eunuch Yang to go to such trouble! I was just worrying about this—this is truly sending charcoal in the snow! Please convey my thanks to Eunuch Yang, Third Brother Bao. There will be generous thanks another day."

Now came the main topic. Baoyu swallowed, apparently finding the words difficult to say. He thought for a while before speaking.

"There's one matter, very urgent. Eunuch Yang asks that you definitely find a way to handle it."

"Oh? What is it, so urgent?" Leng Ningyun thought the tone seemed off. Usually, when Eunuch Yang needed something done, he simply sent someone to tell him directly. This "find a way to handle it" carried a tone of negotiation, a hint of request—a considerably softer manner.

"The 100,000 taels that Little Eunuch Yang deposited at Delong before the year..."

"Yes, that's been taken care of. I've also given Little Eunuch Yang the deposit slip and commission."

"Eunuch Yang's meaning is: can it be withdrawn immediately? The situation in the palace has changed, and he has an urgent need."

Leng Ningyun had expected that Eunuch Yang would send someone to withdraw the 100,000 taels the moment they reopened. But he hadn't expected Eunuch Yang to be so urgent as to send someone specifically on New Year's Eve.

For a matter involving 100,000 taels, logically it should be Little Eunuch Yang appearing in person. Even if Little Eunuch Yang was unavailable, at least one of his close eunuch attendants. But the person sent was just an attendant, and his manner was evasive.

Something was very wrong here!

Leng Ningyun said, "Yes, yes. Eunuch Yang wants to withdraw—naturally no problem. It's just..." He put on a difficult expression. "Currently, both Delong's vault and accounting office are under Shuntian Prefecture's seals. These imperial seals, unless an official comes with orders to open them, removing them without authorization is a serious crime."

With the vault sealed, they couldn't access silver. With the accounting room sealed, they couldn't issue notes. These were perfectly legitimate reasons. Even if the visitor were a top Eastern Depot agent or a Brocade Guard commander, he'd still have to follow this procedure to withdraw.

"However, the moment the imperial seal is lifted, I'll prepare the silver immediately. Whether cash or banknotes, it will be delivered at once."

Baoyu seemed somewhat disappointed. He said in a low voice, "Manager Leng, don't you have 100,000 taels on hand?"

"Third Brother Bao!" Leng Ningyun made a helpless expression. "One hundred thousand taels! At most, this bank's deposits don't even reach 130,000 or 140,000. How could I personally have 100,000!"

"But..." Baoyu seemed to find it very difficult to say. "I heard that when you, sir, were in distress, to raise ransom, silver was specially transported from Delong—100,000 taels..."

Leng Ningyun's heart froze. How did Eunuch Yang know about this?! But this absolutely couldn't be admitted, because unauthorized opening of an imperial seal was a grave crime. Even as a rumor, it would cause endless trouble.

So he said in a very earnest tone, "That's a rumor! If I had that much personal property, I would have given it to the kidnappers to free myself. Why would I suffer until now?"

Baoyu couldn't counter this and had to say, "Very well. This request may have been asking too much!"
