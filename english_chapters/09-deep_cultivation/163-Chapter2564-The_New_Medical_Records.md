# Chapter 2564 - The New Medical Records

"The pastries are all made at the factory. This shop doesn't have a preparation room, only a warehouse."

"Then let me see the warehouse."

The assistant said with a smile: "May I ask which department you're from, Elder? If you're from the Health Department, please show your credentials. According to the Food Sanitation Management Law, non-relevant personnel are not permitted to enter food warehouses."

This not-so-soft, not-so-hard rebuff left Zheng Mingjiang seeing stars. That's right—she had led the drafting of this very sanitation regulation!

Still, for a shop to dare say this to an Elder's face—this walnut shop was the first. Impressive-plus!

She immediately showed her Health Ministry credentials. Currently, food safety work was led by the Health Ministry, with implementation handled by the sanitary police under the National Police. So this was indeed within her scope of responsibility.

"Then I'll lead the way." The assistant maintained his smile and led the way.

After conducting a spot inspection, Zheng Mingjiang and her secretary sat down at an elegant seat on the second floor. By old timeline standards, the sanitary conditions here were barely passable, but the two had been strolling all morning and were somewhat hungry, so Zheng Mingjiang reluctantly ate a little—traditional pastries and candies were characterized by heavy sugar and heavy oil, and regardless of what sanitation standards they met, she didn't like them. What she did enjoy was Zhang's salted lemon in soda water, which somewhat captured the flavor of an old timeline Guangdong tea restaurant.

Though she didn't like them, her secretary Jingshan certainly did. Almost all naturalized citizens and natives were particularly fond of such pastries. So before leaving, Zheng Mingjiang still had the assistant pack several dozen boxes of various pastries to be delivered directly to the guesthouse.

Afterward, she took her secretary to browse the Great World's jewelry shop.

"Jingshan, today's your birthday. Pick whatever you like." Zheng Mingjiang sat in the jewelry shop and said grandly. But when the manager eagerly laid out all the so-called finest pieces, Zheng Mingjiang was disappointed. Because the Great World marketed itself as embodying the "Australian lifestyle," there was nothing like the "traditional craftsmanship jewelry" she had imagined. Everything sold by the piece here were mass-produced industrial products. Zheng Mingjiang's idea of buying her secretary some artwork representing the crystallization of 17th-century handicrafts had fallen through.

"Never mind. I'll take a look in Guangzhou proper sometime." Guangzhou's traditional crafts were famous—17th to 19th century works had large quantities of export products. Zheng Mingjiang believed such shops should still exist in the city. After all, handicrafts were currently an important export commodity.

The next day, Zheng Mingjiang arrived punctually at the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital. Lin Motian had already led the hospital's main medical staff to the conference room to "welcome" her.

The most conspicuous items in the conference room were the two sealed cases she had brought from Lingao. Supposedly "Lingao specialties sent by the Health Ministry."

Of course, anyone could guess with their toes that the specialties were real, but definitely not the kind of specialties everyone wanted.

Lin Motian watched with some amusement the somewhat apprehensive naturalized citizen doctors. In the eyes of natives and naturalized citizens, they were all miracle physicians who could "grow flesh from bare bones." But by old timeline standards, they were just a bunch of fraudulent quacks.

What on earth was Zheng Mingjiang selling? Lin Motian was quite curious.

After a round of welcome-applause-speech-applause procedures, they finally got to the main topic.

The first case was opened. Zheng Mingjiang pulled out a blue hardcover notebook with "Medical Record Book" written in large characters on the cover.

This medical record book contained no paper inside but was made in loose-leaf binder format. Each was a standard size, with specialized index tabs and a simple instruction card on the outside.

"This is the latest version of the Lingao medical record book, with numerous improvements based on the previous version. It can greatly enhance everyone's work experience. Each notebook is numbered, so you must allocate and use them reasonably. One per person. All medical record books must be properly preserved—not a single one can go missing. You should know that medical records are priceless treasures for a hospital. Later, when you've all become great professors and we've built a library, together with the medical records you'll have a complete set of lucky charms."

"Al...alright..." Xie Yao, the most senior physician at the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, felt somewhat taken aback. "Thank you to the Senate for still thinking of us."

"Of course. Wherever the sun and moon shine, wherever rivers flow, all are lands blessed by Senate benevolence." Zheng Mingjiang said. "There's another matter I hope everyone will pay attention to. In the past, outpatient medical record books were kept by patients, and our hospital only retained medical records for inpatients. But outpatients often lose their medical records and buy new ones when they come for consultation, defeating the purpose of 'medical history.' So the new system requires the hospital to keep the records, and patients are only given a medical record number." As she spoke, she picked up a bamboo tablet tied to the medical record book with a number branded on it.

"This number will be given to the patient when they first receive their medical record book. Afterward, they only need this number to register. When you're providing treatment, write the medical record number and patient's name, sex, and age on the specialized loose-leaf medical record paper. At the end of each shift, the medical affairs department's archives room will be responsible for filing."

Zheng Mingjiang explained the new medical record usage method, then continued: "Of course, considering that patients might misremember their number, which could cause management confusion, our current requirement is that patients must present their medical record number tablet to register. If the tablet is lost, they must first register the loss before reapplying—of course, there will be a handling fee."

Everyone could tell from Zheng Mingjiang's tone when she said "handling fee" that this sum would certainly not be trivial.

Xie Yao raised his hand. Zheng Mingjiang said: "Do you have a question?"

"What if someone uses another person's number tablet to register?"

"Dr. Xie asks a good question. This situation could indeed occur. The current solution is that doctors only care about the number, not the person. The specific verification work is handled by the medical affairs department archives room. The requirement is a four-way verification of number, name, age, and sex. If the information on the loose-leaf doesn't match the registration in the medical record book, a 'doubtful' stamp is added, but it's still filed, serving as a reminder to the doctor."

Completely eliminating this was probably impossible. However, those who could afford to register and see doctors at the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital probably wouldn't bother borrowing someone else's number tablet. After all, anyone could get one after their first registration and payment. And the medical record number tablet wouldn't give the borrower any cost advantages.

...

Zheng Mingjiang went on at length about the new medical record usage methods and specific details, taking about an hour. Only after she'd finished everything did Xie Yao finally breathe a sigh of relief. He quickly called over several helpers to move the two big cases of medical record books out.

"Coming from afar, I didn't bring any gifts for everyone. I bought some pastries from Zhang's Food Shop in the Great World—one portion each. Have them when you're on duty to stave off hunger."

The harmonious atmosphere brought by the pastries didn't last long before Zheng Mingjiang spoke again: "Xie Yao, this afternoon everyone bring your current medical record books back to the conference room. I'll guide you on the new medical record writing standards. Don't always bury your heads in work—stop and learn and summarize sometimes."

Sure enough, all afternoon Zheng Mingjiang spent affectionately guiding the junior residents in writing medical records. Thanks to the Senate's impoverished medical education, these residents' standards could only be called barely adequate.

"Sigh, when I'm old, who'll treat me?" Zheng Mingjiang sighed, incidentally grumbling about Shi Niaoren: "What's the point of a leader who can't recruit students!"

Sighing was one thing, but it didn't prevent Zheng Mingjiang from giving the residents loving education. That evening, she divided the medical record books before her into three piles: upper, middle, and lower. Pointing at the rightmost pile, she said: "Alright, these should all be opened and hung on the classroom outer wall with names posted—in big letters! Hang them for six months!"

"O...okay." Xie Yao felt his speech had been clumsy all day.

"Let this be a lesson to all of you in the future." Zheng Mingjiang then pointed at the leftmost pile. "These are quite good. Keep up the good work. The Health Ministry is preparing to establish a Jiren Scholarship—I'll apply for you." She very solemnly copied down the names of these medical record owners.

"Alright, we've been tired all afternoon. Let's all eat together—my treat."

However, the doctors deeply felt that Chief Zheng's meal was better left uneaten, lest they cause trouble. So some claimed duty shifts, others said they needed to go home and study, hanging from the beam and jabbing their thigh so as not to fail the Senate's cultivation. In the end, Zheng Mingjiang had no choice but to find Lin Motian for dinner.

"Sure!" Lin Motian readily agreed. "Zhang Xiao said he's treating today. I'm free, and so is Fu Qiliang—why don't the three of us go mooch off Zhang Xiao?"

When Zhang Xiao's group arrived at the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital in a flurry, Lin Motian had just finished signing a document on his clipboard and handed it to his assistant. Then he saw Zhang Xiao: "Well well, what wind blew County Magistrate Zhang here? Our humble hospital is honored!"

"Old Lin, stop teasing me." Zhang Xiao laughed. "Coming here today means I'll owe you a favor."

"Oh? What's the matter? Consider it done."

"Yesterday Zhang Jiayu brought a note from Old Du but couldn't find you anywhere. He actually went and blocked me outside the toilet at the Nanhai Academy, so I had no choice but to come in person."

Lin Motian often self-deprecated that his "official IQ" wasn't high. Hearing Zhang Xiao say this, he was also somewhat puzzled—could he have offended some Elder again? He turned and asked his assistant: "Did this happen?"

The assistant girl was somewhat guilty. She explained: "Director Lin, you weren't there yesterday evening. I left the note on your desk."

Lin Motian was a bit angry. He grumbled at his assistant: "Why didn't you remind me?"

The assistant girl just hung her head, not daring to speak. Actually, she was thinking: I obviously put it on your desk, in the most conspicuous spot!

"Alright Old Lin, saving the person is what matters." Zhang Xiao smoothed things over. "The girl is inexperienced—you can educate her slowly tonight. I also have a Councillor Huang here who got beaten up badly. Have a doctor examine him too. I don't think it's anything serious, but this matter should be taken seriously, seriously..."

"Fine, I'll have someone examine him right away and get some muscle-relaxing, blood-activating medicine."
