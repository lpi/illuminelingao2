# Chapter 2707: The Capital (Part 63)

The dart slipped through her fingers, the tip staying level. Sharp, stable, it drew a low, flat arc.

Seizing the initiative, the dart flew like passing electricity.

At the moment the steel dart was thrown, if the arm extended in the direction of the throw, force would be transmitted from the shoulder to the joints. Over time, this would injure the elbow and wrist, so one must unload the force when throwing a dart.

The action looked simple, but in reality, it required thousands of chaotic repetitions to achieve free control of release and retraction.

Liao Sanniang's right wrist rotated and hooked, unloading the throwing force. Following the momentum, she turned her hand to wipe across the chest strap. The second steel dart entered her hand, forming a closed loop of action.

Almost at the same moment, a man rushed out from the bushes in front of her. Just as he leaped out, his vision blurred, and a dart shadow struck his face.

At a distance of four meters, the dart's force was enough to pierce a wooden board.

The first dart shot into the area above the collarbone.

The second dart followed closely, hitting the hard frontal bone. The tip smashed a small pit on the smooth plate of the skull, then slid off and flew away.

The seven-*liang* heavy dart struck the man's head aside, exposing his profile.

The third dart was released, shot with extreme precision and correct force. It hit the pterion region of the skull—the temple. The bone wall here was only one millimeter thick. The steel dart penetrated the bone wall, stabbing deep into the brain, piercing the middle meningeal artery and causing intracranial hemorrhage. Massive bleeding quickly formed a hematoma.

The man's eyes instantly turned blood-red. He seemed to want to rush forward, but rising intracranial pressure compressed his nerves, affecting his functions. His body went out of control, tilted sideways, lost balance, and fell forward.

The inertia of running made him face-plant after falling. His face scraped a shallow half-meter groove in the ground, grinding away half his face.

The man fell, revealing the stunned companion behind him.

Liao Sanniang didn't leave the second person time to react. Her dart-holding hand paused slightly to control the rhythm. As the first man fell and the second exposed his upper body, three darts fired in succession.

Two darts took the chest, one dart took the throat.

*Pu pu pu*, three sounds. One dart stabbed into the abdomen, the second into the chest cavity, the third into the throat.

One "son" (target), three darts; no dart missed.

Six darts fired in succession. Her body didn't move; her hand gesture and orientation didn't change. Striking from stillness was beneficial for exerting force, estimating distance, and aiming.

The dart wounds were not immediately fatal. The man could still move; adrenaline release suppressed the pain. He continued to charge forward with his saber.

Liao Sanniang separated her double sabers and took two steps forward. The two approached each other head-on.

Liao Sanniang's willow-leaf double sabers had narrow blades and sharp points, suitable for piercing.

The man slashed sideways with a waist saber in one hand. As he moved, the steel dart stuck in the cricoid cartilage of his throat vibrated. The tip irritated the wound and the respiratory tract. Unable to suppress the physiological reaction, the man's breath hitched, and his hand shook.

Liao Sanniang thrust her double sabers diagonally. As the two sabers met the waist saber, she felt the weakness in it, knowing the enemy's movements were deformed by injury.

Liao Sanniang stepped forward at a forty-five-degree angle. She separated her sabers left and right. The left saber dragged backward to deflect the enemy's waist saber; the right saber thrust forward with full force, fiercely stabbing the throat.

The tip penetrated the Adam's apple, poking a huge open wound in the man's throat. Under the impact of the sprint, the enemy's body fell backward, the throat wound filling with blood.

Unable to breathe, the man dropped his saber, covered his neck, coughed once, and sprayed blood from both mouth and wound. He fell backward, clutching his neck, struggling in pain.

Liao Sanniang stepped up and stabbed left and right with her dual blades, finishing off the two men on the ground who had been hit by darts.

A rustle sounded behind her—faint, the sound of feet stepping on fallen leaves.

Liao Sanniang turned rapidly. In her peripheral vision, a blur attacked. She couldn't see what it was clearly.

Human vision has a characteristic: under dynamic vision, there is no absolute clarity in the instantaneous state. The impression of moving objects is inherently blurry.

Liao Sanniang blocked outward with her double sabers. The spine of the blades struck the incoming object, knocking it away with a *clang*. It was an iron javelin, heavy in front and light in back, fusiform at both ends, seventy centimeters long.

A medium-sized round rattan shield painted with a baring-toothed tiger suddenly leaped out from behind a tree, appearing abruptly in front of her.

Shields came in two types: long and round; and three sizes: large, medium, and small. Battle formations mostly used large shields that could cover the whole body; private fights mostly used medium shields.

In the early Ming, there was no rattan in the North, so willow wood covered with leather was used to make shields, which were quite clumsy.

The South mostly used rattan shields. Rattan shields were light and agile, usable in mud and rain. Except for being unable to withstand musket balls, they could defend against arrows, sabers, and spears. Later, both North and South used rattan shields.

A rattan shield without a javelin cannot kill the enemy. A shield bearer must carry javelins, just as one practicing double sabers must carry flying darts.

Li Gun, the "Sky-Soaring Great Sage" in *Water Margin*, used a round shield and carried twenty-four javelins on his back, modeled after the Ming shield bearer.

In actual combat, a shield bearer carried two javelins. In battle, the right hand held the javelin, while the waist saber lay across the shield's handle, braced by the wrist and forearm. Waiting for the enemy to approach, they threw the javelin to seize the enemy's eyes and force them to block, then drew the saber in the gap to fight at close quarters.

Throwing the spear, then drawing the saber—two seemingly simple consecutive actions were actually the difficult part. In the chaos of battle, shield bearers often found it hard to link them, missing the combat opportunity.

The distance between the two wasn't far. The shield bearer threw the javelin, pushed his right hand upward behind the shield, and drew his waist saber. The movement was fluid and skilled; he was a good hand.

The usage of rattan shield and waist saber was the same as Yue Fei's side shield and heavy horse-chopping saber (*mazhadao*). Training involved setting up four wooden stakes to simulate chopping horse legs.

Unless necessary, a shield bearer wouldn't open the shield or attack with the shield's edge, losing the intent of protection—the gain wouldn't make up for the loss.

Liao Sanniang quickly closed with the enemy. Her left saber pointed forward, feinting a stab to make the opponent raise the shield to defend.

The shield bearer raised the rattan shield to cover his upper body, trusting the shield forward and upward with force to squeeze Liao Sanniang's space and break her balance. His right waist saber poked out from the side of the rattan shield, sweeping diagonally downward to cut Liao Sanniang's knee hollow (popliteal fossa).

Liao Sanniang didn't retreat but advanced. She turned her body left, sidewards in a bow stance—right leg bent forward, left leg taut behind.

Her lead right saber, tip pointing down perpendicular to the ground, pushed outward halfway. Using vertical to break horizontal, she blocked the waist saber sweeping at her legs. Borrowing the momentum, her right shoulder slammed into the shield, neutralizing the shield's pushing force.

Her left arm simultaneously raised sideways over her head. The two sabers coordinated: one standing to block, one attacking upward. The left saber drew a semi-arc like a curved rainbow, crossing over the shield's upper rim and stabbing toward the enemy's head behind the shield.

The attack was unexpected; the shield bearer was caught off guard.

The blade tip descending from the sky forced him to instinctively tilt his head back. He lifted the rattan shield upward to block the right saber (Note: context implies blocking the overhead attack).

Liao Sanniang was a step faster. She stabbed downward with the tip, then immediately lifted her wrist flicking the tip upward. It slit open the enemy's lip and sliced straight through the right eyeball. Her left saber retracted, scraping against the rim of the rattan shield.

The shield bearer screamed. His right eye went black, losing vision. In panic, his body shrank back.

Liao Sanniang quickly withdrew her bow stance, guarding against a counterattack.

Without stopping her steps, she exploited the enemy's eye injury, advancing to invade the enemy's right side. Her right saber led the enemy's waist saber; her left saber swept across the enemy's right knee. The blade dragged, cutting the fibular collateral ligament on the outside of the knee.

With the joint attacked, the shield bearer lost balance and fell to the ground.

Injured in two places and fallen, the shield bearer lost his bearing. The shield opened up like an opening clam shell.

Liao Sanniang stepped forward and stabbed him dead with a strike to the heart.

Three steps, three moves, three sabers to kill a man.

She counted silently: *Six*.

A flash behind a tree—three enemies appeared together: one with a waist saber, one with a Japanese saber (*wodao*), one with a short spear.

Seeing the three corpses close by and one lying prone not far away, the three were stunned simultaneously, their gazes somewhat dull and hesitant.

Six of the ten men were dead—more than half. The enemy must feel fear and lose the will to fight.

*They will flee*, Liao Sanniang thought.

The next moment, the three looked at each other, their gazes hardening. They split into a T-shape and surrounded Liao Sanniang.

Liao Sanniang raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised. It was unexpected. She sighed inwardly; a woman lacked deterrent power, making people underestimate her.

The tips of her double sabers touched in the air, forming a horizontal acute triangle to protect the centerline of her chest. Liao Sanniang took a step back, leaning against a tree to protect her back.

*Wu-ye* wind sounds. Several pellets shot from the woods behind the enemies—some clay, some iron, flying extremely fast.

Seeing the trajectory, Liao Sanniang knew it was Little Bazi.

In ancient times, there were no slingshots with Y-shaped structures and rubber bands.

Slingshots used bamboo as wood, shaped no differently from ordinary bows. The bow strength was "two and a half force" (*er-jin-ban*); one force was nine *jin* twelve *liang* in old measurements. Slingshots couldn't reach far or pierce armor.

A slingshot had two strings vertically. A bamboo string covered the bowstring to suppress vibration.

There was a bowl-shaped bullet pocket on the bowstring. Unlike a bow and arrow, a slingshot didn't require fitting an arrow nock to the string, so one could shoot fast. The archer held two to three pellets in hand. A pellet was snapped into the pocket and fired immediately. Continuous loading and firing resulted in a high rate of fire.

Iron pellets were cast in molds; clay pellets were fired from white eel mud.

Clay pellets were about the size of longans, smooth and round, not breaking upon hitting the ground. Once hitting an unarmored target, a light hit caused bruising, a heavy one caused fractures.

Arrow shafts were thick; a quiver could only hold twenty or thirty arrows, making them hard to carry.

A cloth bag slung diagonally could hold dozens of pellets, easy to carry and suitable for walking.

Ten pellets fired in succession. The formation of the three enemies fell into disarray, each finding a tree for cover.

Liao Sanniang circled behind the tree and charged at the waist-saber man closest to her.

The appropriate length for double sabers was such that when held in hands hanging naturally, the tips didn't graze the ground. They were shorter than single sabers or Japanese sabers.

Being short, one had to close in quickly and kill while moving.

Single saber looks at the hand, double sabers look at the walk. Wielding double sabers easily caused mutual interference; coordination was extremely difficult. Coordinating double sabers with the lower limbs was even harder.

Two enemies chased from behind. Unmoved, Liao Sanniang charged at the enemy in front of her at high speed.

Liao Sanniang came fiercely. The man was nervous; he took a step back and chopped vertically at her head with the waist saber.

Moving the arm forward then back in a retracting motion is a "cut" (*pi*); from top to bottom is a "smash" (*za*).

Liao Sanniang blocked diagonally upward with her left saber. Following the momentum of the enemy retracting his saber, she pushed up, propping up the enemy's right arm holding the saber.

She ducked and lowered her head, drilling past under the enemy's armpit.

Two figures merged abruptly and separated. The blade dragged a horizontal light as the two crossed paths.

In the instant she drilled under the armpit, her right saber followed her forward step and dragged horizontally across the enemy's armpit.

The entire blade edge dragged across the armpit. The edge was sharp; where it passed, flesh curled and bone was visible. The pleasure of a sharp weapon cutting smoothly transmitted to her hand. The enemy's weapon-holding arm was almost severed at the shoulder.

Turning to the enemy's back, she stabbed with her left hand, piercing through the lower back.

Liao Sanniang pulled out the steel saber, flicking off a string of blood beads. Without stopping, she turned back and charged at the two men behind her.

Little Bazi appeared from behind a tree, rapid-firing his slingshot.

At the moment of releasing the string, the bow-holding hand flipped outward; otherwise, the fired pellet would hit the bow back or the hand holding the bow.

The drawn bow twanged, the string sound flipping. The front hand stabilized the arm and rolled the wrist; pellets poured from the rear hand like rain.

The two men opposite were hit by pellets, separating front and back.

Liao Sanniang and the short-spear wielder attacked simultaneously, meeting the spear head-on.
