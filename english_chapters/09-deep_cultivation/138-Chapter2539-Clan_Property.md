# Chapter 2539: Clan Property

Not long after the meeting ended, Chen Lin hung out a sign in the graveyard in the name of the "Senate Demonstration Private Nansha Cotton Textile Factory Preparatory Office" and began recruiting laborers to start civil engineering works.

This "Senate Demonstration" was specially applied for from Chiefs Li and Zou under Chen Xiaobing's reminder. The purpose was self-evident: to invite a protective talisman.

Once the Preparatory Office was established, the recruitment of civil construction workers began. Although the professional construction team came from Guangzhou, the project still needed a large number of manual laborers. These job opportunities were all reserved for the Chen clan members of Nansha.

The internship group explored around Nansha for a long time and finally selected a nameless river bend as the factory site. For convenience, the internship group called this place "Factory Bay."

According to Li Guo's on-site observation, there was a terrain drop of nearly 3 meters from the upper reaches of the river to here. This head was not too ideal, but enough to drive a water wheel.

After the factory site was determined, Zou Feng of the "Textile Worker Four-Man Group" began to design a water wheel that could effectively utilize river water. He found a room with good lighting conditions in the graveyard as a design room, set up a drawing board and equipment, and started the design work.

Although the four-person group were all "textile workers," their professional directions were actually different. The textile school run by the Senate could not yet achieve the detailed division of labor in the old timeline, and according to the status quo of this timeline, they had to make some "suit measures to local conditions" changes. So Zou Feng's professional direction was textile machinery and textile architecture, and he also knew a bit of printing and dyeing, worthy of being called a jack-of-all-trades.

Zou Feng was male, and his age was older than the three girls, relatively more prudent. He went to explore and collect data every morning and drew blueprints in the "design room" in the afternoon.

The three girls helped copy blueprints and do related calculation and paperwork. For the time being, they had no place to use their skills. Besides helping, they wrote various process flows and specification books. Once entering the factory construction stage, they would shoulder the recruitment and training of workers.

Zou Feng's design plan was actually the "localization" implementation of the Senators' design plan. And this kind of hydraulic machine had been set up many times throughout Hainan; it was a very mature plan.

The specific plan was to build a dam in the river to form a head of about 2 meters. As for the water wheel, the Senate's industrial data had multiple water wheel schemes, each with pros and cons. After comparing objective conditions, Zou Feng chose the breastshot water wheel [Middle Shot].

The principle of the breastshot water wheel relies on the weight of the water in the water wheel buckets to rotate. River water pours into the bucket from the upstream side, driving the water wheel to rotate. Unlike the common overshot water wheel that pours from the top. So its rotation direction is opposite to the flow direction of the river water.

The advantage of doing this is that it can carry away backwater and does not require a large head to drive.

Its pit needs to be carefully built to form a straight line with the edge of the breastshot water wheel. This curved supplement is called the curved section. The gap between the bottom of the pit and the water wheel is very narrow, forcing water to stay in the bucket until it rotates to the very bottom of the rotation cycle before discharging.

After the water wheel plan was selected, Zou Feng began designing the power transmission system. This could also be said to be one of the cores of the entire factory. Without the design plan of the transmission system, even the specific dimensions of the factory building could not be determined.

The rotation of the water wheel drives a vertical shaft to rotate through bevel gears, then transmits to a horizontal shaft known as the "Sky Shaft" [Line Shaft] through another set of bevel gears. This is the "Line Shaft" present in all workshops of the Senate's current factories. All equipment is connected to this main shaft through vertical transmission shafts or belts, utilizing the rotation above to drive the machines. It's just that in most factories, power is provided more by steam engines than water turbines.

How long the Line Shaft needs to be depends on the number of equipment and the layout of the production process. After determining the length of the main shaft, Zou Feng could determine the length of the factory building. As for the width of the factory building, it first depended on the range of machines arranged along the main shaft, and second, the machines should be as close to the walls as possible so that workers could get the best lighting when working.

The factory building was a brick and wood structure. Even though the Senate's steel industry had made considerable development, wood remained one of the most common building materials for the Senate. This factory building was no exception.

Although it was a wood structure, the main structure adopted modern structural materials. Whether it was trusses, beams and columns, floor slabs, wall panels... all were produced by sawmills according to certain standards and could also be customized according to dimensions.

Zou Feng naturally couldn't be said to have "design" ability; he more or less "spliced" according to countless plans he had studied, based on site conditions and specific data. So his design was very fast.

The Phase I factory building of this Nansha Cotton Textile Factory was 20 meters long and 10 meters wide, a brick and wood structure house with a sloped roof and an attic. Although from the outside this building had two layers of windows, it actually had only one floor, only having an attic at the very bottom. To achieve good lighting effects, the windows on the walls were opened very large; part was fixed and unopenable, part was set to be openable for ventilation.

At one end of the factory building, a small shed was designed to cover the canal, used to accommodate and protect the water wheel.

After all these designs were completed, the girls calculated the dimensions and quantities of building materials to be ordered according to the design drawings, and added a five percent margin, forming several order lists. Chen Qing personally delivered them to Guangzhou to Wu Yijun. He would come forward to order.

Chen Lin and Chen Ding these days were busy negotiating with the owners of "Factory Bay" and surrounding lands to obtain the land use rights.

Negotiations did not go smoothly. First, Chen Lin was not the clan leader and could not use clan power to coerce clan members into submission; second, he really couldn't bring out anything to compensate the landlords. After all, the riverside lands were all good lands, and holders were mostly unwilling to let go; moreover, the designated area involved eleven land owners. Nine clan members, two foreign surnames. The magnitude of difficulty could be imagined.

Uncle and Nephew Chen had prestige in the clan and village, so negotiations were not desperate, but over more than a month, they only concluded deals with three families.

"This land is too hard to buy; I've added to three times the market price..." Chen Lin muttered, "They still won't sell. Could it be I have to add to ten times?"

Chen Ding was silent for a long time before opening his mouth: "Just adding price won't work... Even if you add ten times, it won't work. After all, this is people's 'root' for survival. If you buy it, isn't it equivalent to cutting off their 'root'?"

"But they can buy new land; isn't buying more land good?"

"I thought about it just now; swap me in, and I wouldn't be willing to sell either. These lands are mostly by the river bank. Embankments and canals have taken shape over so many years. Unless encountering a great disaster, they are all good fields with guaranteed harvest despite drought or flood. You buy it with three or five times the money, but whether they can buy such good land again is hard to say. Besides, repairing water conservancy is a matter of several generations. Buying land again means starting repairs from scratch; no matter how much money you give, people aren't willing."

"Then what to do? Change places?" Chen Lin spread his hands.

"They spent many days finding such a place. If you say the matter can't be done, how will the two Chiefs view us?" Chen Ding stroked his small mustache. "We have to give them a long-term plan, a long-term plan..."

"Let them work in the factory..."

"This doesn't count as a benefit. In the future when the factory gets big, everyone can enter the factory to work; what kind of benefit is that?" Chen Ding rejected it, but this gave him a spark of inspiration. "Right! We can give shares!"

"Third Uncle! Our Chen family as a whole only occupies one share; how can you give them shares? We can't take out Master Wu's shares to distribute..."

"Speaking of which, going to Lingao some days ago, when Comrade Chen and I chatted during idle times, I heard him talk about a lot of Australian commercial laws. Quite inspiring. I have an idea..."

"What?"

"You probably also know that the Australians have issued an order now, saying to clarify land and standardize property rights."

"Indeed there is such a thing. But we have nothing to say. There are not many people with degrees in the Chen family, and there have never been matters of land commendation [tax evasion via gentry]."

"Sigh, it's not that simple!" Chen Ding said he had roughly studied the relevant regulations. Several articles were specifically aimed at clans.

"You also know, clan land, part is individual, part is the clan's. These clan lands all need to confirm rights this time."

"Confirm rights then confirm rights; could the land deeds be fake?" Chen Lin felt strange.

"Virtuous Nephew, this is your juvenile impetuousness. Government documents all need careful pondering."

According to the new policy, clan lands are confirmed separately. Individual belongs to individual; property under the clan name must transform into "Limited Liability Company" or "Financial Group Legal Person" ownership.

"So in the future, the Chen Clan's land will definitely convert to Chen Clan Company ownership."

"And then?" Chen Lin still didn't understand.

"The one share Master Wu gifted us, logically speaking, should also be incorporated into this company. We will give dry shares [profit-only shares] to the people whose land is requisitioned in the name of this company. Letting them sit and collect profits every year; they will naturally be willing."

"But this doesn't have much meaning. Now, isn't the clan land income also enjoyed by everyone? Every year's annual customary distribution, male heads more or less get a bit, and families with matters get some subsidies..."

"Hehe, why don't you open your mind! Now, regarding income from clan sacrifice land—how to use, give to whom or not—it's all a matter of one sentence from the Clan Leader or Head of Case. At most a few clan elders can express some opinions; others have no share in speaking. Giving or not, giving more or less, is all up to the Clan Leader and Head of Case. Accounts are even more muddled accounts. Changed to a company, that is doing business seriously. How much income a year, how much retained, how much public expense, how much everyone should divide according to shares, are all clear. Isn't this clear share much better than the arbitrary annual distribution? Which one do you think clan members will like?"
