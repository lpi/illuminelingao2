# Chapter 2537: Winning Hearts in the Village (Part 2)

"Uncle Zhang, Second Uncle was indeed wrong in this matter! But right now he is the Head of Case, so it's inconvenient for me to defy him." Chen Lin was very polite.

"Sigh, if your father were here, that would be good!" Lame Zhang sighed, "Your Second Uncle, this person, sigh..." He seemed afraid to continue. Chen Lin knew there was a chance, so he deliberately led him to speak.

"Uncle Zhang, I heard the chicken thief was a Fake Kun brought by the Australians? Do you know what he looks like? I also know a few Chiefs; I can help you sue him to vent this anger!"

Speaking of this, Lame Zhang sighed: "It was dark and black; how could I see what he looked like! I saw him stealing the chicken that day and only shouted once. Unexpectedly, he punched me to the ground, claiming to be the Imperial Guard of Chairman Wen King of the Great Song Senate. I didn't see clearly if he was Australian or not, but he definitely had no hair!"

Now Chen Lin was confident; Chen Qing was right: this Kun person was ninety to ninety-nine percent a fake. He dared not say if Australians had the official position of Imperial Guard. But the Australians only had "Chairman Wen"; he had never heard of anyone called "Chairman Wen King." It might fool and scare country bumpkins, but for someone like him who had been to Lingao, it was fake at a glance.

As for having no hair, that completely matched Qiu Xiao—his hair was pitifully sparse, unable to be tied into a bun at all.

"I think this chicken thief may not be an Australian... Australians are 'Kun' hair [short hair], hair is short, but not bald..."

"Sigh, sigh, I'm actually suspicious too!" Lame Zhang was lame but not stupid. Rumors had long been circulating outside that the chicken thief was Master Xuan's confidant Qiu Xiao. At that moment, he followed his words and said, "Australians treat people very amiably on ordinary days and have money. Even if they want to eat chicken, it's not like they can't afford to buy..."

"Exactly. It's just that originally Uncle Zhang, you are the victim; complaining and suing is also common logic. Second Uncle treating you like this is indeed excessive. It can also be counted as our Chen family's fault. This is a small token of regard; please accept it. Go back to work when your body is better in a few days. The silk workshop cannot do without you, this old master—although you haven't worked these days, I will also tell the accounts office to issue half your wages to you for living expenses."

"Many thanks, Ninth Master!" Lame Zhang was overjoyed. Chen Lin coming to speak soft words already made his mood half better. Hearing he could still get money while recovering from illness was simply a great good thing like the sun rising from the west. Ignoring the swelling and pain in his eyes, he hurriedly stood up to bow.

"Sigh, sigh, you are inconvenient in movement now; don't stand on ceremony." Chen Lin said, "Uncle Zhang, in the future, the Chen family's silk workshop will still need you to worry more."

"Yes, this small old man understands. With Ninth Master here, this Chen family's property won't go bad!"

Lame Zhang sent away Chen Lin. His wife came in and opened the paper package. Inside was a packet of "Clear Fire Asthma Stabilization Candy" produced by the famous Guangzhou pharmacy Chen Li Ji. This was actually a kind of medicinal candy, using Chuanbei [Fritillaria cirrhosa] and other asthma-stabilizing and cough-stopping drugs. It was very symptomatic for someone like Lame Zhang who worked in the dyehouse for a long time and had respiratory diseases.

"This is good stuff." Sister-in-law Zhang looked at the candy packet with some surprise. "Last time I heard Mrs. Wu say that it is most effective for stabilizing asthma and calming coughs. Contained one in the mouth when coughing sleeplessly at night, and it slowly gets better."

Although the thing was good, the price wasn't cheap. Lame Zhang always loved gambling; his earnings, apart from paying back gambling debts, were only enough for food.

"Pity it's not wine..."

"Wine! Wine! Wine! Are you afraid you won't pant yourself to death?" Sister-in-law Zhang scolded, "The doctor said your asthma condition most taboos drinking alcohol! If you drink yourself to death, so be it! This old mother would suffer less of your torture..." Scolding and scolding, she got angrier in her heart and actually started crying.

Lame Zhang didn't care at all. He slowly climbed onto the bamboo couch, thinking, *This Master Xuan is really not a thing! Initially, he said he would treat us foreign-surname craftsmen well, but unexpectedly, it's all the same in the end! It's still Ninth Master; like his father, he is a kind-hearted person!*

Actually, they could all see the subtle relationship between the Chen uncle and nephew. Originally, Chen Xuan vaguely held the upper hand relying on the female Australian's power, but Chen Lin obviously pulled a big backer this time coming back. This uncle and nephew pair was afraid to have a struggle surrounding Nansha.

From the heart, Lame Zhang hoped Chen Lin would ascend to the position. After all, the Chen Lin father and son treated everyone well and were upright. As for Chen Xuan, he gave foreign surnames many benefits after coming to power, but this person had always had incorrect intentions. Right now it was to win everyone over; if he really sat firmly, it was really hard to say what would happen. Those weavers in the silk workshop, one by one possessed by ghosts, following Chen Xuan; afraid there would be no good result in the future...

A few days later, more than ten young men gathered in the graveyard. These were all people Chen Lin successively found from various families to help him. Besides a few of his "diehards," there were also seven or eight young men dissatisfied with the status quo in Nansha.

Originally, he wanted Third Uncle, who had prestige in the clan, to preside over the meeting. But Third Uncle said he wanted him to "learn to handle the scene." Thinking of this, he could only force himself to calm down and go over the words he had thought of beforehand in his mind again.

Seeing that people had mostly arrived, he signaled Chen Qing to go out and look out for the wind, and lowered all the window boards, then said:

"Gentlemen, Uncles, Brothers, Nephews..." Although those who came were all young people, the seniority spanned several generations.

"Some days ago, this Little Brother got an opportunity and went to Lingao under Australian rule. This trip was truly an eye-opener..."

Everyone lived in this rural village in Xiangshan County on ordinary days; life was plain and boring, nothing more than farming and working. In recent years, the place was not peaceful, and the village was looted by rogue soldiers; every household's life was difficult. Originally, the few entertainment and pastime activities were also virtually cancelled. They could only gather together to gossip and tell old stories as pastime.

Although the Australians were right in their village—and a very rare "female Australian" at that—honestly speaking, everyone knew very little about the Australians' situation. They could only know a bit from daily contact. As for what Lingao under Australian rule looked like, there were many speculations and rumors.

Chen Lin went to Lingao; this personal experience was naturally extraordinary. Mentioned by him, everyone became interested and asked him to tell them.

Seeing everyone interested, Chen Lin first detailed what he saw and heard on his Lingao trip, pulling east and west: iron ladder carts that could carry a thousand people using the power of water and fire; looms that wove a thousand feet of cloth a day but only required one female worker; the East Gate Market where lights were brilliant like the Silver River [Milky Way] at night... and the dazzling array of goods in the department store; many goods let alone whether he could afford them, he hadn't even seen them.

After this bragging of "Lingao Observations," the young men were one by one drunk and mesmerized, their hearts yearning for it, wishing they could go to Lingao to see immediately.

Next, Chen Lin began to brag about Lingao's income. This wasn't really bragging; the living standard of Senate workers was a dust-leaving existence [far superior] in 17th century China. Guangdong didn't lack rice and grain; having rice for every meal and fish and shrimp every day wasn't too impactful for these Chen family disciples. But eating meat once every ten or so days, that had killing power.

"...Ninth Uncle! You are bragging! Having meat to eat every six or seven days! It's one thing for one family or household, but tens of thousands of craftsman households eating meat, how many pigs and sheep must be killed!"

"Whether I'm bragging or not, there are quite a few Australian employees in our village. Just ask them when you have the chance. Is it true they have meat to eat every six or seven days?" Chen Lin laughed.

"Come to think of it... my dad helps them purchase for the silk workshop. These people buy half a pig to have a feast every ten days!" Someone said, "Every time those working in the silk workshop can also get some benefits!"

"See, I wasn't bragging." Seeing someone chiming in, Chen Lin's interest grew stronger. Seeing everyone had interest, he turned the conversation and continued:

"Gentlemen, although we young men have different seniorities, at home we are always the 'young.' Doing anything depends on the parents' facial expression. If parents don't allow, we can't want proper things. We have to wait until the beard grows out to execute a few sentences that people listen to. But do you know what I saw at the Australians' place this time?" Chen Lin began to be mysterious.

"Saw what?"

"I know! Australians all don't grow beards!"

"Could it be that young people are all in power?"

...

Immediately, Chen Lin described the scene when he met Chen Xiaobing vividly to the young men present, and said impassionedly: "He is similar in age to us, yet can be an official of the Australians, managing many big shopkeepers to act according to the Australian plans."

These words scratched the itch of this group of young men. For a time, the room was noisy with sounds of discussion. Australians were mostly young people; they had discovered this long ago. Leaving aside that Chief Li was a young woman, the Fake Kuns she brought, and the Fake Kuns who returned to the village with the Chen Xuan uncle and nephew recently, were mostly young people. Especially the four young men and women who came this time; except for the man who was slightly older, the three girls were all maidens under twenty.

"...The few who came with me this time, several girls are under twenty, yet act as the Australians' skilled craftsmen, knowing how to build factories and operate machines. You say, they are human, we are also human; could it be that we can't do it?" Chen Lin said impassionedly, "Now is exactly the time of changing winds and clouds, changing dynasties. We young sons can act to achieve great merits and make the folks look at us with new eyes!"

"Doing is naturally doable, just don't know how to become capable!" Someone echoed.

"Uncle Lin is right! What Australians can do, we certainly can do too!" As if communicated beforehand, one of his diehards immediately responded at this moment, pushing the atmosphere hot again.

Immediately there was a burst of cheering from the side, "Brother Lin, I'll listen to you on what to do!" One person said, and everyone followed in agreement.

"Everyone also knows that now the silk workshop is managed by Second Uncle. Regarding the matter of managing the improved silk industry, this Little Brother is also assisting Senator Li in handling affairs. However, this improved silk industry is not a matter of one morning and evening. Now many disciples in the clan have no career to do. Just right, going to Lingao this time, I heard the Australians intend to open a cotton textile factory in Guangdong, and the location is chosen in Xiangshan County..."
