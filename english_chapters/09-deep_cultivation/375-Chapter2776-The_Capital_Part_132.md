# Chapter 2776: The Capital (Part 132)

Third Sister listened to the report from the man she had sent to gather intelligence, her brow furrowing slightly.

When he finished speaking, she leaned forward. "Are you certain?"

"Beyond any doubt! They've already become entangled!" The speaker was none other than Zhao Liangjian. Ever since he had distinguished himself during the rescue operation, He Lian Sheng (Union Victory) had absorbed him as an "Associate." Though he held no formal title or position, people in the *Jianghu* valued silver and loyalty above all else—and He Lian Sheng possessed an abundance of both. Naturally, he was happy to serve.

In recent days, he and his partners had scattered throughout the Capital, ferreting out suspicious information and monitoring various locations from the list they had been given.

The place assigned to him was the residence of "Mr. Zhou" at Wanggong Factory, based on intelligence provided by Liu Sha.

Unexpectedly, his surveillance had yielded no clues about the residence itself—but it had uncovered an entirely new case.

"What is this man's background? Does he have anyone behind him?"

"Whether he has backers is hard to say, but he has a reputation in the *Jianghu*. He makes his living through the vile business of seducing women and selling them on. People call him 'Jade-Faced Pan An,' though his real name is Pan Cheng'an."

"Jade-Faced Pan An?" Third Sister sneered. "I take it he's remarkably handsome?"

"In truth, his looks are merely average," Zhao Liangjian replied. "But he understands women's hearts with uncanny precision, excels at all manner of little tricks, and his skills in the bedchamber are said to be extraordinary. Once a woman falls into his clutches, he clings to her like maggots to bone—she can never shake him loose."

"That formidable?"

"Exactly." Zhao Liangjian nodded. "Otherwise, how could he prosper in such a trade?"

"Though the trade itself is despicable, one actually needs real skills to succeed in it," Third Sister observed. "Tell me the full story."

"In this residence live two concubines of some Mr. Zhou..." Zhao Liangjian explained that Pan Cheng'an had been eyeing the Zhou residence for some time. With no male master present for so long—only two young women with small children—it was an ideal target.

Yet despite being "fat meat," it proved no easy prey. Pan Cheng'an had spent several months before he finally caught them going out to offer incense and employed his "charm technique" for the first time.

As for the specific process, Zhao Liangjian was unclear on the details. However, the seduction of women followed well-worn routines—nothing more than those familiar few tricks. In short, through their comings and goings, Pan Cheng'an and You Rong had developed mutual affection.

"About two months ago, the two met privately at a nunnery in the south of the city, and Pan Cheng'an succeeded," Zhao Liangjian said. "Recently, I suspect he's preparing to persuade her to pack up her valuables and elope."

"Didn't you say the defense of this residence is extremely strict? Apart from the two concubines taking occasional strolls at the temple fair to burn incense on the first and fifteenth of each month, even the servants rarely venture out."

"Third Sister, you yourself—before your retirement—once served as a guard in inner courtyards. You know the affairs of female relatives better than anyone. Which great household doesn't maintain strict doors? Yet which one can truly prevent these things? Once such thoughts take root, they could manage to get things done even in the Imperial Prison."

Third Sister had no response to that. This matter seemed both related and yet unrelated to capturing "Mr. Le" (Zhou Lezhi), or the even more mysterious "Mr. Zhou." Whether to intervene had become a genuine dilemma.

Logically speaking, since no traces of "Mr. Le" or the more mysterious "Mr. Zhou" had appeared at the Zhou residence, whatever transpired within should be left undisturbed—lest they alert the enemy. But standing by while villains abducted women, watching helplessly as people were pushed into the fire pit without lifting a hand—that violated everything bodyguards held dear.

"Can this matter be resolved quietly?"

"Probably not." Zhao Liangjian shook his head. "Eliminating Jade-Faced Pan An would be simple enough, but many of his peers in the Capital know he's working this case."

If Pan Cheng'an suddenly vanished, everyone would realize someone had secretly intervened. This potential surveillance point would lose all meaning.

"Then we have no choice but to allow him to abduct the woman," Third Sister exhaled with evident reluctance and muttered, "These disappointing creatures! Can't survive without a man, can they?"

Zhao Liangjian had long sensed that Third Sister wished to involve herself in this matter but was constrained by their mission. He thought for a moment. "It wouldn't matter if Third Sister decided to intervene. After Pan Cheng'an succeeds, he'll most likely sell this woman to southern guests on the tribute grain boats. We could simply intercept her at that point."

"How do you know he'll sell her to guests on the tribute grain boats?"

"This residence is a place the Wanping County Yamen has been specifically instructed to protect. Ordinary people wouldn't dare cause trouble there." The Zhou residence was a location Wang Yehao had personally sent a card to the Wanping County Yamen requesting they look after. Thus, common petty thieves and villains dared not make any moves. "Seizing the door and tying up people" was out of the question—that would be suicidal at the foot of the Emperor. But if the female relatives simply packed up their valuables and ran away of their own accord, that had nothing to do with the yamen.

"...Even so, one must guard against the victim using official channels to demand the person's return. Therefore, once he succeeds, he'll sell the woman far away. Only then can the beginning and end be clean, without implicating himself."

"Good grief, what a nest of demons and monsters!" Third Sister's face twisted with disgust. "Fine, we'll follow your suggestion. Send me news immediately regarding any developments over there."

***

Zhou Lezhi listened to Xu Yong's report and set down his pen. He laid it slowly on the desk, pondered for a moment, then asked, "Who do you think they are?"

"Nine times out of ten, they're *Kai Tiaozi*—woman abductors!" Xu Yong said urgently.

Zhou Lezhi recalled what Wang Zhi had said about the You Rong matter, then remembered similar words Liu Sha had spoken before disappearing. He found himself hesitating.

This matter was not groundless; he had heard rumors long ago. But he possessed no hard evidence, and with his status as a mere "apprentice," it was awkward to intervene directly. If he reported it to Master Wang, he feared the affair might spiral beyond control and bring humiliation upon the master's household.

Originally, the master had been quite open-minded about women. He always said "stay if willing, leave if not," and had even stated that if You Rong or Yui ever became unwilling to follow him and wished to marry someone else, he would not oppose it. Not only would he not oppose it—he would provide a generous dowry.

Zhou Lezhi did not insist on making You Rong and the others "keep watch"—remain chaste in perpetuity. After all, whether the master was still alive, and if alive, whether he could ever return, remained unknown. It was hardly surprising that under such "care"—which amounted to house arrest—certain thoughts had stirred in their hearts.

You Rong herself was one matter. The real problem was that she was Zhou Newton's "birth mother." Though he, Wang Zhi, Xu Yong, and the Liu brothers all knew that both Newton and Juli were actually substitutes brought by Liu Sha, after living together these years, the master had developed deep affection for the two children. If You Rong took Zhou Newton away, or if some accident befell them during an abduction, how would he explain it to the master?

"Whether You Rong is a red apricot reaching over the wall or has been bewitched by others, those pursuing her must be villains," Zhou Lezhi said, his voice hardening. "If she truly falls into their hands, I fear it will mean eternal damnation. This matter cannot be delayed—we must report to the Master at once."

"Yes!" Seeing Mr. Le's resolute attitude, Xu Yong grew greatly excited and nodded vigorously. "If she is truly abducted, and the Gentleman returns to find his family member gone, none of us will be able to explain ourselves."

"Summon Wang Zhi."

Wang Zhi had been indulging in novels these past few days, and the task of delivering New Year's goods that Zhou Lezhi had assigned him had been languishing. Hearing Zhou Lezhi's summons now, he assumed it concerned this same matter. The moment he arrived, he launched into a hasty defense: "Sir! It's not that this lowly one refuses to do it, but these past few days my legs have been aching..."

"I'd say it's not your legs that are aching—it's your backside that's itching!" Zhou Lezhi scolded with a laugh. "Have the steward give you forty strokes of the board and you'll feel comfortable all over!"

"Sir, have mercy! This lowly one will go do it right now!" Wang Zhi said hurriedly. Though Zhou Lezhi was usually amiable and pleasant—and young—he was a first-class favorite in Master Wang's eyes. The key was that he differed from the previous Mr. Zhou: he "knew how to be a master."

"Wait!" Zhou Lezhi considered for a moment. "Take Xu Yong with you this time."

"Yes, yes." Wang Zhi nodded repeatedly.

"Have him pretend to be a young servant carrying goods. He shouldn't show his face."

"This lowly one understands!"

"When you arrive at the residence, don't simply put down the items and leave. You must investigate carefully." Zhou Lezhi's voice grew grave. "Especially inside You Rong's room."

Wang Zhi stiffened. "That, I'm afraid, would be inappropriate."

"How so?" Zhou Lezhi asked. "Didn't you yourself say she was 'very restless'?"

"Yes, this lowly one did say so. But after all, she is Mr. Zhou's concubine, and with a son at her knee, her status is no ordinary thing. When we lowly ones go to deliver items, at most we can glimpse the curtain and pay our respects in the courtyard while exchanging a few words. How could we conduct a strict investigation? Leaving aside the distinction between men and women, the hierarchy of high and low cannot be disordered either."

Zhou Lezhi saw the sense in Wang Zhi's words. Whether Wang Zhi or Xu Yong, they were both servants. How could they presume to investigate You Rong, who was half a master? Let alone enter her room.

When it came down to it, he himself was merely an "apprentice," while You Rong and Yui were both "mistresses." Even if he went personally, he could not conduct a "strict investigation."

Yet at this moment, he had no woman of suitable status to enlist for help. He spoke after a pause: "Since that's the case, you two go first. If you can't enter the room, at least walk around the courtyard privately. See if there's anything suspicious." A thought struck him, and he added, "If You Rong truly is up to something, there's probably someone secretly assisting her. If it's not one of the household servants, then it must be some meddlesome three aunts and six grannies. Examine and question the people serving in the residence carefully!"

By now, Wang Zhi understood the urgency. He agreed hastily, then said, "The two families serving in the Zhou residence are both the Master's household servants—most reliable. I suspect outsiders are seducing her."

"I can take responsibility for this matter; you just ask the questions," Zhou Lezhi said. "If anyone proves dishonest, come back and report to me."

"Yes!"

"Xu Yong!" Zhou Lezhi turned to him. "I'll trouble you to guard the residence for the next few days. Someone will definitely arrive to relieve you within three days."

"Yes, this lowly one understands!" Xu Yong hesitated, then added, "If something happens within those three days and this lowly one cannot handle it alone, what should be done?"

"Didn't your master teach you? The Capital lies at the foot of the Emperor—no matter how arrogant the thieves, they wouldn't dare break down the door to seize people. You just need to keep watch and make sure no one runs out!" Zhou Lezhi laughed. "But you think quite thoroughly!"

"Many thanks, Sir." Xu Yong beamed with pride. Being praised by this brain trust of the Master was a matter of great face. It also bore upon his future standing within the Stone Old Man (Shi Weng) group.
