# Chapter 2637: Legal Popularization Style Lawsuit (Part 2)

On the day of court trial, women from ten *li* eight townships all arrived at Grand Camp of Jiujiang Great Market. Although trying not Huang *Shi* divorce case, other cases also satisfied villagers' Melon Eating Mentality greatly, enough for their post-meal conversation resources for one or two years. Medical team going down to countryside with Magistrate also started Free Clinic outside Grand Camp after completing epidemiological investigation. Lively extraordinary. Those not knowing thought a new market opened locally.

Zhang Xiao was greatly inspired by such scene. In his view people coming more the better. This was not only "Legal Popularization," more was a great opportunity to imperceptibly influence masses with new concepts new thoughts. So his "Going down to countryside" besides inspection and finding out bottom, also had certain "Performance Nature."

Magistrate Zhang didn't think his "Performance" was void head eight brains (empty/impractical) thing. Many new things new thoughts, if without events able to bring intense shock to people, were very hard to spread open. Just like opening of railway in past, shocked folks in poor villages remote soils greatly, bringing huge cracks to their world view. This was more direct and effective than effect of a few rural teachers holding hanging charts and textbooks to lecture.

So this time not only opening trial of Circuit Court, free clinic of Medical Team, but also Art Group coming to perform Puppet Show—after Guangzhou Restoration, partly deployed artists from Lingao to Guangzhou, also recruited a batch of artists locally, forming Guangzhou Puppet Troupe. But changed original Lingao dialect singing and spoken parts to Modern Cantonese Opera singing and spoken parts.

Fact proved, in era when art activities extremely scarce, this "Localization" transformation adapted to environment very much. This prematurely born "Cantonese Opera" Puppet Show soon became greatly popular. Performing daily in Guangzhou, one ticket hard to seek. Original one troupe soon expanded, dividing into five or six performance groups, going everywhere to perform various "New Plays."

To prevent art groups from eating Imperial Grain for long term "Rigidifying," Literature and Propaganda Department issued a policy not long ago. Actors and staff of original Guangzhou Puppet Troupe could resign voluntarily to "Jump into Sea" (go commercial) to form drama club. Coming to Jiujiang today was one drama club among them. Repertoire performed naturally were all new play repertoires of Wen Xuan Kou (Propaganda Dept). Among them was *Spending Money* (*Hua Qian*) propagating marriage freedom—actually adapted from *Luohan Qian* (Arhat Coin).

Zhang Jiayu felt very fresh towards these gadgets. Local folk art drama status not high in traditional society. Although having plots of "Loyalty Filial Piety Chastity Righteousness," having certain "Enlightenment" significance, but for government, more still thinking it "Teaching Lust Teaching Theft." Suppressed drama performance often. Sometimes just to reflect own "Correcting Social Atmosphere," detained local troupe actors to cane and pillory.

Like Australians not only not adding restriction, instead big flag drum beating (fanfare) "Official Run," also encouraging organizing new drama clubs, performing everywhere, using this to propagate own concepts, this had huge impact on Zhang Jiayu.

In view of traditional scholars like Zhang Jiayu, enlightening common people was to gather strictly seriously in County School, Prefecture School, at worst had to be at Yamen gate, lectured on Loyalty Filial Piety Chastity Righteousness by officials or local great Confucians. Only this could reflect "Rites."

Australians actually used such means to "Enlighten," truly was incredible. But content of this performance all belonged to various deviant arguments propagated by Australians; actually counted as complementing each other.

Zhang Jiayu watched people around busy busy, feeling novel looking at everything. Wandering everywhere in camp and Jiujiang. Seeing any fresh thing wanted to go look and ask. Zhang Xiao also instructed relevant personnel, no need to limit him, letting him travel. Towards his questions, as long as not involving Secret Level, all could answer truthfully.

Zhang Jiayu only felt following Chief Zhang down to countryside once, truly surpassed his own life experience of past ten-plus years! This Undercover truly didn't work in vain!

He was especially interested in Liang Xinhu's training on naturalized citizen judicial cadres. Because professional personnel needed by Judicial Department gap was very big, but this training was relatively long, couldn't receive effect by short term shock training. So relevant training was conducted in rolling style. Taking old naturalized citizen judges, prosecutors as core dividing into study groups, assigning newly recruited students to groups. Each group not exceeding five people. Adopting method of Old Leading New, combining classroom learning and internship observation.

After students entered study group, morning physical exercise, subsequently explaining laws regulations and judicial concepts, afternoon going to various courts to observe trial, evening writing experience and instilled with Lingao's New Society Concepts by various group leaders.

After three months study, they used group as unit, following Circuit Court to go to various places to "Handle Case." Handling case while learning.

This time Circuit Court was led by Liang Xinhu personally, so study groups coming along were also several more. Once arriving at Jiujiang camp, started lecturing training immediately—grasping every minute time was common characteristic of Senators' work.

Zhang Jiayu also came to "Audit." Compared to traditional Chinese justice, Australian justice was completely different. Before Zhang Jiayu came to "Undercover," he also went to Australian court to "Listen Trial." He was different from ordinary people's "During Lively," didn't simply treat these as "Overseas Anecdotes" to treat. But wanted to know inner spirit more.

"...We continue class. Everyone turn book to page 3. Below I explain concepts of our Great Song State Legal Workers." Liang Xinhu cleared throat: "We cultivating judges prosecutors, is urgent need of implementing basic strategy of Ruling Country by Law. Senate destroying old establishing new, must ensure various works walk onto track of institutionalization, legalization. We these people, are most important link guaranteeing law operation. Meanwhile, you also want to practice personally to spread legal concepts to every corner of society."

This paragraph Zhang Jiayu could still understand—nothing more than being official needing integrity strictness clear that set. This was benefit of having read books; understanding relatively fast.

But, he always didn't understand why Australians wanted to strip function of trying cases from local chief officer. Admittedly, benefit of stripping out was obvious to see—local officials mostly Provincial Graduate Metropolitan Graduate origin, not familiar with criminal name laws, very easily made empty deceived by book clerks below.

But after stripping/separation, original relatively simple local Yamen added a brand new institution. And according to Australians' statement, this specialized case-trying institution was not governed by local Yamen.

Isn't this Politics Out of Many Heads? Zhang Jiayu was quite puzzled at this, immediately asked:

"Chief, Great Ming and previous dynasties officials also had function of trial. What difference with judge prosecutor you said? Why Great Song wants to separate their functions? And heard not subordinate to each other with County Magistrate Prefect. Politics Out of Many Heads, isn't local administration fully convenient?"

"Zhang Jiayu right? You are not student, but listened very carefully ah!" Liang Xinhu knew Zhang Jiayu's situation, nodded quite appreciatingly: "This question asked well. If speaking from root, that can write several big block works. But simply speaking main differences are following points. First, traditional local official is One Hand Grab, managing both administration and justice. Very easy to appear problem of abusing judicial power causing unfair trial for completing superior task. And my Great Song stresses separation of two, avoiding appearance of power abuse problem. Second, Ming Country scholars before being official mostly only read Four Books Five Classics, at most read Grand Pronouncements. Assuming office at local place, wanting to try cases still had to hire a Criminal Name Private Assistant (*Xing Ming Shi Ye*). Not only unprofessional easy to make mistake, but also will appear problem like being made empty by Private Assistant. So legal education we promote strives for Professionalization, Authoritativeness."

"Last point is also most important point." He paused, strengthened tone: "Purpose of existence of Ming Country officials is for rule of Ming Country Emperor. As long as passable on surface, they won't care how folks are. And my Great Song Senate's judges prosecutors, exist for protecting interests of Senate and folks. Whether rich people gentry, or poor people Tanka households, all protected uniformly."

Speaking here, Liang Xinhu also had interest. Started speaking some Song Dynasty judicial systems already annihilated in later generations.

These systems although were Song Dynasty's, seeking their ideological advancement in legal aspect, possessed considerable advancement.

"First is Sealing Case (*Feng An*) System," Liang Xinhu said, "This system, as far as I know, is unique to my Great Song..."

Sealing Case, referred to when Song Dynasty judges trying some minor crimes (below cane) cases, usually after making penalty judgment (e.g. cane eighty) on criminal, based on certain considerations, first putting judgment paper into box, temporarily not executing judged penalty. Actually was Suspended Sentence System, sometimes also called "Sending Cane" (*Ji Zhang*), "Surveying Cane" (*Kan Zhang*), "Surveying Down Cane" (*Kan Xia Zhang*). If criminal could repent former wrong, then penalty not executed anymore; if criminal didn't think of repentance, then opened box taking out judgment paper, executing penalty. This called "Dismantling Decision" (*Chai Duan*).

"...Pity, Former Emperor threw into sea at Yashan, after Divine Land Land Sinking, this Suspended Sentence System vanished without trace." Liang Xinhu said incomparably regretting, "Actually suspended sentence or not, is not main joint. But consideration of balancing Emotion Reason Law inside."

Zhang Jiayu seemingly understood not understood. Although couldn't say a reason, roughly joint was clear. Secretly realizing flavor inside.

"Next down, is 'Interrogation Decision Division' (*Ju Yan Fen Si*)."
 
 *Ju* (*Ju*), i.e. *Ju Yu*, meaning of interrogation; *Yan* (*Yan*), i.e. *Ding Yan*, meaning of examining law to determine crime; *Ju Yan Fen Si*, was separation of "Fact Trial" and "Law Trial." Its principle similar to under Anglo-American Common Law system, Jury responsible for confirming whether crime true, Judge responsible for application of law. Song Dynasty criminal justice universally implemented system of Interrogation Decision Division. Judges responsible for "Fact Trial" and judges responsible for "Law Trial" could not be same person.

"This method wonderful!" Zhang Jiayu after all read poetry and books fully, immediately realized wonderful point inside, "Prison Department infers interrogates, Law Department examines decides, each has department kept, reason to prevent treachery also."
