# Chapter 2616: Seeing Injustice on the Road

"Auntie, are there markets nearby to buy silkworm papers?"

"Yes, Jiujiang Great Market has them. Silkworm paper shops generally rent shop fronts in the market. Also, some seed makers carry on shoulders, or boat alone, shuttling between small markets in townships, setting up stalls to sell on the spot."

"Oh, how many silkworm papers are suitable to buy for each crop?"

"This depends on how many mulberry leaves your family's mulberry land has. However, generally, more silkworm papers will be booked. Early silkworm ants consume few mulberry leaves. If unprofitable, excess silkworms can be discarded. If many seek to buy raw silk, then go to Mulberry Market to buy mulberry leaves, not needing to stick to one's own mulberry land. Furthermore, if encountering flood or disease, booking more silkworm papers prevents total failure."

After asking about silkworm seeds, Zhao Hening got up and said, "Auntie, is it convenient to see your family's silkworms?"

Huang *Shi* also hurriedly got up and said, "No harm, no harm. Just that my humble home is vulgar; fear it obstructs Sister's eyes."

"What is Auntie saying? I also come from a poor family."

Lifting the door curtain cloth, Zhao Hening found the layout of the silkworm room very different from Jiangnan. Small windows were opened on mud walls, and small holes were opened at wall corners, seemingly for ventilation, but all covered with thick paper hemp cloth, probably to prevent flies and insects. Silkworm rooms taboo high temperature and humidity most. Thatched roofs helped ventilation, and mud walls could block moisture, but the floor contacted mulberry dike mud directly. During the rainy season, moisture easily invaded.

"Auntie, why not build a separate silkworm room?" Zhao Hening couldn't help asking.

Huang *Shi* looked embarrassed and said, "Sister is joking. Family is destitute; truly powerless to build another silkworm room."

Zhao Hening shook her head. Humans and silkworms cohabiting in one room, the noisy environment, excessive human *qi*, and filthy space were all unfavorable for silkworm growth. She immediately said, "Auntie, don't blame me for having a big mouth. I have seen other families raising silkworms. Cohabiting in one room makes silkworm babies prone to sickness. Better think of a way to build a separate silkworm room."

"Sister is right. I also plan to raise a few more crops to save some money, then hire people to build a thatched hut."

"Auntie, when will this crop of silkworms 'Go Up the Mountain'?"

"What does the 'Go Up the Mountain' Sister says mean?"

"It means cocooning." Jiangnan area called silkworms going onto the limit/trays to cocoon "Going Up the Mountain." Obviously, Huang *Shi* didn't know.

"Oh, tomorrow is the Third Sleep. Only need one day. Three days later there is another sleep, called 'Great Sleep,' also one day. Four or five days after Great Sleep, silkworms cocoon. Locals call it 'Going Up the Tray' (*Shang Bo*)."

Zhao Hening was relatively interested in the difference between the two places and asked, "Can I see your family's silkworm trays?"

Huang *Shi* then took Zhao Hening to another room. A pile of rectangular bamboo products was piled in the corner. These were silkworm trays. Silkworm trays were about three *chi* and two *cun* long. Bamboo strips formed a skeleton like swimming pool lanes. On the skeleton, thinned bamboo strips were bent into oval shapes one *cun* long and half *cun* wide, forming small spaces convenient for silkworms to spin silk and cocoon, distinctly different from the "Straw Dragon" commonly used in Jiangnan area.

Zhao Hening asked, "Your silkworm trays are very different from Jiangnan. Are there any particular reasons?"

"So Sister is from Jiangnan; no wonder..." Huang *Shi* said, "Jiujiang climate is humid and muggy. Such silkworm trays are easy for ventilation and dehumidification. Before 'Going Up the Tray,' fire must be used to roast silkworm trays, burning off remaining silk after cocoon extraction from the previous crop. One or two days after 'Going Up the Tray,' 'Cocoon Baking' (*Bei Jian*) is needed. Stand silkworm trays opposite like a '人' character, spreading about twenty sheets, all surrounded firmly with straw mats and thick paper. Open a small hole at the top corner to facilitate moisture venting out. In the middle of every eight silkworm trays, place a fire basin. After baking about one and a half double-hours (*Shichen*), flip silkworm trays up and down, baking once more. Thus silkworm pupae are all baked dead before dry cocoons can be taken down safely."

Zhao Hening said, "Presumably this is because the local climate is humid; baking cocoons can prevent cocoons from mildew and rot." Of course, besides this, baking cocoons could also kill silkworm pupae and parasites like fly gnats attached to pupae, fixing cocoons in the state when on the tray, conducive to silk reeling.

"Sister is intelligent, understanding at one hint." Huang *Shi* praised, "It's just baking cocoons costs more silver money."

"Oh, how much silver money?"

"Six sheets per tray consume three *jin* of charcoal, costing about two *fen* (candareens) of silver."

Zhao Hening felt this bit of silver was nothing, but for poor farmers, one more *li* (cash) was also money. Zhao Hening didn't tangle on this matter and asked again, "Is silk reeled by yourselves after collecting cocoons?"

Asking this question was because when Zhao Yingong ran a filature in Hangzhou back then, he encountered the difficulty of cocoon acquisition. Silkworm farmers raised silkworms laboriously; mostly, they were unwilling to sell cocoons just like that because the profit was too low. In the medieval agricultural society, the value of labor was very low. Exchanging a large amount of labor for negligible cash income was a very common phenomenon. Jiangnan silkworm farmers generally made silk themselves for sale, forming a rural sideline labor of considerable scale.

Plus there was a "Silk Cocoon Guild" in the middle monopolizing the small amount of directly sold cocoons. Zhao Yingong couldn't acquire cocoons directly from farmers either, only able to buy from the Silk Cocoon Guild. after thinking repeatedly, Zhao Yingong decided to start from scratch. Control cocoon production directly from the origin. Precisely speaking, it was a small producer cooperative model similar to Leizhou Agricultural Cooperative.

"Indeed reeling silk ourselves," Huang *Shi* was somewhat curious, asking, "Are there people in Jiangnan selling cocoons directly? That's too unworthy. Besides, no one here acquires cocoons."

Cocoon markets were products of the machine silk reeling industry. Without the massive demand of filatures, cocoon markets wouldn't form. The revolutionary significance of cocoon markets was separating the silk reeling industry from sericulture. Zhao Hening thought in her heart: *It seems local sericulture is not as developed as Jiangnan. No one collects sporadic cocoons. This is a manifestation of insufficiently refined social division of labor.*

"Is raw silk selling good?" Zhao Hening asked again.

"Okay. All bought by local silk workshops and merchants."

Zhao Hening was quite strange, saying, "Since Australians came, Frankish merchants increase day by day. Overseas trade surpasses year by year. Haven't raw silk sales increased greatly?"

"Indeed not; just like usual."

Zhao Hening asked, "Is it not said 'Guang yarn and gauze together with Niu Lang Silk, Five-Thread, Eight-Thread, Cloud Satin, bright satin are valued by the capital beyond the ridges, and East and West Oceans?' Someone wrote a Bamboo Branch Song: 'Foreign ships strive to come out as official merchants, Cross Gate opens towards two oceans. Five-thread Eight-thread Guang satin is good, silver money piles full in Haopan Fang.'"

Huang *Shi*, a mere rural woman, the farthest place she went was Jiujiang Great Market. Naturally unknowing of the inside story, she only said she didn't know.

Zhao Hening then changed the topic direction, asking, "Is raw silk traded in the Silk Market?"

Huang *Shi* said, "Naturally."

Immediately Huang *Shi* introduced the situation of the Silk Market. Jiujiang currently hadn't formed a specialized Silk Market. Similar to the Mulberry Market, Silk Markets might be places as small as one or two shops, mostly established in existing markets. Silk Markets generally just provided a place for buyers and sellers to meet and bargain, also setting up public scales, charging a certain percentage of commission from buyers and sellers.

Local Mulberry Markets and Silk Markets both provided loans, with monthly interest about 2%. Once small farmers encountered natural or man-made disasters and cash was insufficient to maintain reproduction, they had to turn to usury.

Seeing Huang *Shi* and her son living in destitution, Zhao Hening couldn't help asking, "They say a family with ten *mu* of land, raising silkworms with mulberry, can fill eight mouths. Why do you live so poorly?"

Huang *Shi* sighed deeply, face sorrowful, but didn't speak.

Guan Zongbao seeing his mother silent, explained, "My family also has a medicine jar, taking medicine all year round, doing no labor all day, also drinking excessively and smoking. Years of savings have long been squandered empty. If not frugal, we mother and son would have long been reduced to slaves."

Le Ziren aside was familiar with the local situation and also explained to Zhao Hening, "Jiujiang takes fish, mulberry, silkworm, and silk as big. Even gentry clans won't give up management. From spring to winter, no need to worry about having nothing to do. With capital, profits from fish and silkworms turn like wheels. Families without capital can also cut grass and pick mulberries, also able to survive. The only thing to worry about is luxury and waste. In other places after autumn and winter, grain goes into barns, passing the year peacefully and fully. Jiujiang worries about 'mulberry branch tail hard.' If not frugal and saving during silkworm and mulberry days, there is nothing to resist winter. Widows feeding themselves by their own labor instead have surplus funds; this is the reason for frugal living. So the proverb says: 'Widows have grain to sell'."

Unlike other farmers planting rice, farmers based on mulberry dike fish ponds had products not of grain, but commodities like fish, raw silk, and mulberry leaves. Unable to achieve self-sufficiency like rice farmers, they needed to exchange for grain from the market to survive. Therefore, their living conditions were constrained by income. Factors affecting income: first, this model required large capital investment; second, products needed to be put on the market directly. Thus, farmers' lives were in relatively high risk. When floods came, fish escaped, mulberry failed. Silkworms having no mulberry leaves or getting sick also meant no harvest. If one crop of silkworm and mulberry failed, the loss would likely affect the production of the next crop. Market turbulence also made farmers' lives hard to stabilize. What mulberry dike fish pond farmers held after selling products was currency, also facing temptations like gambling and alcoholism. Worrying about "mulberry branch tail hard" meant fearing that capital invested on ordinary days was much, and if not frugal usually, it would be hard to have savings to buy rice and grain to resist winter.

Zhao Hening was somewhat puzzled, asking Guan Zongbao, "Who is the medicine jar you mentioned? Your wife or child?"

Guan Zongbao said, "It's my Dad."

"Why don't we see him?"

Huang *Shi* said, "He just came here to cause trouble last night, forcibly demanding one tael of silver, saying he was going to Guangzhou to do business."

Hearing this, Zhao Hening revealed a quite sympathetic expression, sighed, and said, "So pitiful. How can there be such a dad in the world?"

Guan Zongbao said instead, "Sister, if possible, I want to ask Officer Le to uphold justice for my Mom."

Facing the sudden request, Le Ziren looked confused. He, a small resident police officer, had no roots locally. He probably couldn't manage domestic trivia, so he looked towards Zhao Hening.

Zhao Hening said without hesitation, "I person can't stand injustice in the world most. Whatever grievance Auntie suffered, just speak up. We will definitely help if we can." After speaking, she also looked at Le Ziren and Zhang Jiayu.
