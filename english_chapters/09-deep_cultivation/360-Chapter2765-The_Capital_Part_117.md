# Chapter 2765: The Capital (Part 117)

"Yang Tianliang is dead." When Liu Sha heard this news, he didn't show much surprise, as if he had foreseen this result long ago, and repeated it quite indifferently.

"Yes, Yang Gonggong is holding a funeral for him with great fanfare these few days," Xu Ke said.

"This old castrated wretch can do it!" Liu Sha sneered, "He can accumulate another sum."

It could be seen that Liu Sha's perception of eunuchs was very poor.

"Yang Tianliang is dead; Yang Gonggong can be said to have lost a son in old age. Although he adopted another one, whether this adopted son is reliable or not is hard to say."

Liu Sha laughed: "As long as there is silver in hand and his brain isn't muddled, what difficulty is there to find someone to care for him in old age! He is just too greedy. Having ten thousand, he wants twenty thousand. Like Han Xin counting troops, the more the better. Otherwise, why does Shopkeeper Leng fawn on him so much! Don't just say Leng Ningyun; even the shopkeepers of other money shops in the Capital treat eunuchs as Gods of Wealth. In the Capital City, the richest people, excluding the Emperor, are probably them..."

He began to talk about the family property situation of some eunuchs in the Capital. Xu Ke didn't interrupt him—originally, the purpose of his conversation today was about anti-Senate intelligence in Guangdong, especially Liang Cunhou's intelligence. But what he was saying now was also very useful. When the day came to need eunuchs to "joyfully donate," these would all be evidence.

More importantly, he wanted to maintain this good atmosphere. After days of interrogation, Xu Ke had deliberately built a relaxed conversation environment. In this environment, the other party had no mental pressure and wouldn't try to hide anything too deliberately. Often, important news would be spit out inadvertently.

For intelligence work, there is no useless intelligence. Especially since their current intelligence collection in the Capital is limited, they are very interested in the intelligence provided by Liu Sha. So while they talked, a tape recorder was spinning slowly.

"Eunuchs happen to differ in accumulation; I think the aristocratic families are not bad either." Waiting for him to finish a segment, Xu Ke took up the conversation, "You dealt with Liang Cunhou quite a lot. Tell us about his family's affairs."

Liu Sha chuckled and said: "Knew you were most interested in his family. Speaking of which, he is your great benefactor."

This had somewhat of a provocative flavor. Xu Ke didn't get angry and smiled: "Great benefactor is true. Without him, perhaps the Senate wouldn't have been so smooth. It's just that he looked down on this overflowing wealth of the Senate and insisted on walking one path to the dark. Since we can't be brothers, we can only be enemies."

Liu Sha said: "Why doesn't this overflowing wealth fall on my head."

Xu Ke knew he was probing, but the crimes committed by this person were immense. He dared not and could not decide whether to pardon him, so he didn't take up his stubble and continued: "He looked down on this wealth. It would be fine if he honestly acted as his rich man. Unexpectedly he would do things that harm heaven and reason!"

Liu Sha said leisurely: "As the saying goes, 'Those who achieve great things don't stick to trivial matters.' I also heard in Guangzhou that the Senate has a famous saying 'Victors are not judged.' Presumably, it acts so too."

Xu Ke didn't expect this Liu Sha to slap his face directly. Speaking of which, the Senate had done quite a few unseen things. Xu Ke, as a member of the secret front, naturally understood a lot.

Fortunately, he had long trained his thick skin, smiling faintly: "Although we don't judge heroes by success or failure, the general trend of the world is those who submit prosper and those who resist perish. He, a head of an aristocratic family, should understand this bit of principle."

"The general trend of the world, how can one see it clearly," Liu Sha lamented, "Back when I served in the Jinyiwei and was seconded to the Eastern Depot, the Nine Thousand Years had power over the court and opposition, and all officials in the court trembled and obeyed orders. Was this the 'general trend'? Alas, in a few years, this general trend turned around again!"

Xu Ke laughed: "Yours is not called a general trend! Just a bit of waves! If you had read a few history books, you would know that powerful eunuchs controlling the court discipline and bringing disaster to the country have happened in all dynasties. Not to mention far away, just your Great Ming had Wang Zhen, Liu Jin, and Wang Zhi. Wei Zhongxian was called Nine Thousand Years, but Liu Jin was called 'Standing Emperor'. What was the end of these few? The political situation of the court changes; some go up and some go down. Whether loyal ministers or treacherous ministers, they are all passing clouds. The true general trend of the world does not lie here!"

Liu Sha didn't care and asked: "Then where does it lie?"

"The general trend of the world lies only in the support or opposition of the people's hearts!" Xu Ke had quite a stance of impassioned speech, "He, Liang Cunhou, never understood this point from beginning to end, always entangled in the distinction between Hua and Yi, moving at every turn to maintain the Teaching of Names (*Mingjiao*). Little does he know that the common people are sinking in the sea of bitterness; where do they have the time to listen to his preaching!" He glanced at Liu Sha as he spoke, "Actually, take you for example. You work for Master Wang, to put it bluntly for silver. Could it be for the Zhu family's world?"

These remarks were quite fresh. Liu Sha digested them for a good while before reacting, saying: "Saying so, doesn't it want all people in the world to become profit-seeking disciples?"

"What's wrong with seeking profit? Could it be that everyone has to become a hypocrite?" Xu Ke laughed, "Admitting that people are all profit-seeking, and guiding according to the situation can achieve great things. No matter how big a loyal minister, if asked to serve the public on an empty stomach every day, even if he doesn't complain himself, sooner or later he will starve to death."

"Never mind, can't explain clearly to you." Liu Sha waved his hand, "You have too many ways (*Dao-dao*)."

"Don't talk about these ways." Xu Ke laughed, "Continue to talk about Liang Cunhou."

"I don't need to say about Liang Cunhou's family background; presumably you know it better yourselves. Speaking of his affairs, there are thousands of threads. I don't know which ones you want to know?"

"First tell us how you hooked up with the Liang family." Xu Ke said, "The Wang family and the Liang family differ by several thousand *li* and never served in the court together. What made you walk on the common road of the Great Cause of Anti-Kun together?"

This brand-new metaphor made Liu Sha very unused to it. He thought for a while before saying: "This matter, speaking of it, has some relation to me."

When Liu Sha served in the Jinyiwei and Eastern Depot, because of "monitoring hundred officials," he stayed in Guangdong for a long time. Not only did he learn a mouthful of Guangzhou vernacular, but he also had relationships with the local Three Teachings and Nine Streams.

"...The few flower-拍 (*Pai Hua* - kidnappers/sorcerers) in the Witchcraft Case you mentioned were known at that time."

"Why did you befriend such people?" Xu Ke was quite puzzled, "Since ancient times, there is a saying, 'Thieves also have a Way.' This trade has always been despised by people. People in the *jianghu* are also unwilling to associate much with them."

"Isn't this what you old man said, that people are all profit-seeking?" Liu Sha smiled quite mockingly, "Despised is despised, but they have money, really have money. We servants, seemingly majestic on all sides, feared by everyone. But we brothers doing 'inspecting hundred officials' can't reveal our identities easily. We can't be as majestic as other brothers coming to investigate cases, able to arrest officials and people anytime and anywhere for severe torture. Naturally, getting silver is not too convenient."

"So you accepted their silver." Xu Ke said.

"Yes, those doing this trade have committed grave crimes. People in the yamen don't dare to accept their incense easily. Naturally, they can only come to honor someone like me who taboo nothing." Liu Sha laughed at himself, "Falling into your hands now counts as karma retribution."

"However, what does this have to do with the Liang family?" Xu Ke said, "Could it be that the Liang family is tainted with them?"

"The Liang family naturally cannot have any connection with them. This relationship is a long story..."

Because of this relationship, Liu Sha incidentally got to know many local musician households (*yuehu*) in the flower streets and willow lanes. For the trade of prostitution, except for musician households who were hereditary pariahs and had no choice, most were sold by human traffickers. The "stocking" channels of human traffickers were diverse. Some were bought from common people, and some were obtained from the hands of "flower-拍". Especially since *Pipa* girls (*Pipa Zai*) needed to be cultivated from childhood, many girls were abducted and sold.

"So, you knew Han Qiaojie through the channel of Fu Wen?"

"People like Fu Wen are hated by gods and ghosts; even prostitutes would absolutely not deal with him. Actually, it was transferred through the manpower of the Guandi Temple."

Xu Ke thought: This matches. As soon as the Mao Family Inn was broken, Gao Tianshi immediately attempted to silence them. The relationship between the two is obvious.

"How did this person Fu Wen get to know you? Even if you were a Jinyiwei officer back then, he wouldn't give you silver for no reason."

"Back then, he acted on the West River and was captured by constables in the local yamen. He entrusted people to reach me eventually, promising five hundred taels of silver. I fished him out. Counted as saving his life."

"No wonder Fu Wen could do such things for you!"

"Hehe, how can it be so simple! Such people who mutilate live people are most heartless and unrighteous. I saved his life, sparing him the pain of a thousand cuts, but this thief felt heartache for his silver. Seeking his own death, he actually wanted to murder Poor Daoist by the river at midnight."

Xu Ke couldn't help but be stunned. He knew a little about the *jianghu* of the 17th century. Fu Wen's practice, no matter under which mountain's good fellows, was the most despised behavior.

"Fortunately, Poor Daoist has deep magic power and captured him on the spot. Since he delivered himself to the door, I was not polite either. I extracted one of his souls and one of his // pos // (*hun po*), making him driven by Poor Daoist for life..."

"Stop, stop..." Xu Ke couldn't help interrupting him here, asking in surprise, "What did you say?!"

"Extracted one of his souls and one of his pos." Liu Sha said leisurely and complacently.

"Daoist Liu, I know you are proficient in Daoist arts. But it has come to this point; don't play god and ghost anymore. Just say it clearly, won't you?"

Liu Sha laughed and said: "I know you don't believe it. You Australians don't believe it. Also, if you believed, you wouldn't have been tricked. You don't believe if you don't believe; anyway, he believed."

"So that's how it is." Xu Ke thought this guy really had some tricks! According to the interrogation record, that Witch Daoist also thought he had a soul and po extracted by him, so he was driven by him.

"Otherwise, how could he be willing to go to Guangzhou to do such a big thing?" Liu Sha was quite proud, "Naturally, having big business to do is also one reason."

Although the case of the Mao Family Inn had been solved, there were many doubts in it. What the organizer in front of him revealed was naturally the most precious first-hand material.
