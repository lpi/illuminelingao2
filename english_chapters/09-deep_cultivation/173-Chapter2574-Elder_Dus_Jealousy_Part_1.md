# Chapter 2574 - Elder Du's Jealousy (Part 1)

Word that Zhang Jiayu had successfully "sought medicine" and, through a stroke of fortune, become Zhang Xiao's staff aide spread swiftly through the Shen'ao Study Society. The news caused an immediate sensation, along with no small amount of envy. After all, the scholars gathered here—aside from a handful genuinely seeking knowledge—mostly harbored burning ambitions for fame and fortune, viewing the Study Society as their stepping stone to leap the dragon gate.

And now this young licentiate, simply by seeking medicine, had won an Elder's appreciation and been elevated to his side. It practically opened the door to advancement through favoritism.

Such advancement had occurred throughout history, but in the eyes of scholars and officials alike, it remained a genuine pejorative—a "breaking of the rules." So while most greatly admired Zhang Jiayu's talent and courage, they were quite displeased that he'd risen to a Chief's side through such means.

Naturally, some defended Zhang Jiayu, but they were a minority in the Society. For a time, the place buzzed with contentious discussion.

When this talk reached Cui Hantang's ears, he saw the danger. With public opinion in an uproar and signs of division emerging, he felt obligated to calm the scholars' emotions. During the weekly lecture session, he addressed the matter directly, clarifying that Zhang Jiayu was currently only an intern staff aide—not the "councillor" everyone claimed, much less a civil servant.

"Moreover, I must clarify one point," he said. "Young Zhang isn't following behind Zhang Xiao all day. Right now, he's mainly staying at the hospital attending to his old mother. This is—ah—filial piety. Yes, supreme filial piety! Zhang Xiao recognized this virtue and gave him an opportunity. In the future, if Zhang Jiayu wants to become a civil servant in our Great Song, he'll still have to pass the examination. It's not as though Zhang Xiao can make someone an official with a single word!" He paused, then shifted his approach. "Besides, you shouldn't complain. This is actually wonderful news for all of you. It shows that our Great Song Senate's Elders highly value the Study Society. Zhang Jiayu is proof of that."

Advancement through favoritism broke the rules, which made everyone dislike it. But if such fortune might fall on one's own head—well, that was another matter entirely. Cui Hantang's words temporarily soothed the students' emotions.

Once they'd settled down, Cui Hantang retreated to his quiet room and cursed under his breath.

"Damn you, Medicine Master Zhang—you actually dare steal this Daoist's catch! If you weren't an Elder and I had some Miao people around, I'd put a gu curse on you. No, I can't swallow this anger. I must go have a word with you. Even if I can't get Zhang Jiayu back, I need to vent."

He cracked his knuckles—*crack, crack*—and prepared to tidy up and pay Zhang Xiao a visit, to give those skinny-as-a-stick shoulders of his a good patting.

But just as he was about to leave, he reconsidered. He couldn't let Zhang Xiao off so easily. When you got down to it, he and Zhang Xiao were both Elders. They couldn't actually come to blows. Even roughing him up enough to need plasters for a few days wouldn't satisfy the hatred in his heart. Better to give Zhang Xiao something to worry about long-term...

He suddenly thought of his "cooperation partner." This Little Du was a collector of famous persons, always scheming to acquire the "Three Loyalists of Lingnan." In Cui Hantang's view, Du Yibin's ideas were somewhat fantastical—but fantastical wasn't his concern. Zhang Jiayu being taken by Zhang Xiao—once Little Du learned of it, he'd certainly be furious. Cui Hantang might as well contact him for some mischief-making.

With that thought, he immediately drafted a telegram and sent it to Du Yibin in Enping.

"Goddamn it!" Du Yibin slapped his thigh hard upon receiving the message. "My Jiayu got snatched by you?!" He tossed the telegram aside. "Quick, prepare a boat! I'm returning to Guangzhou!"

Zhang Jiayu had originally come seeking him. Who would have thought Zhang Xiao would pick up the slack? He had to find a way to get even.

Du Yibin stared at the fat Daoist's telegram with the expression of a man betrayed. He'd already planned everything: Zhang Jiayu would work for him, then convert to New Daoism and become a devotee, then make a grand appearance at some jiao ritual—fooling old Cui in the process. A perfect plan! But because he'd forgotten to bring his personal seal, Zhang Xiao had snatched the prize. What the hell was this? At the thought, he decided to severely punish his life secretary tonight. Who told her to forget his seal?

As for the staff around Du Yibin, they were completely baffled. No one knew who this "Jiayu" was. Seeing their Elder's behavior, they assumed it was some romantic affair.

Having been robbed of his prize, Du Yibin naturally refused to accept defeat. Daoist Cui's telegram was clear in its meaning: an invitation to raise a ruckus together.

But how exactly should this ruckus-raising work? Du Yibin found himself stumped. He couldn't carry on like Daoist Cui—bold and unrestrained, with an "I'm just a rough fellow" or "straight up villain, take my axe!" attitude. There had to be a proper rationale.

After much thought, he decided Song Yingsheng was most suitable for this kind of thing. He summoned him and explained the whole story.

"Zhang Jiayu is indeed an outstanding talent. Following County Magistrate Zhang wouldn't be wasting him." Song Yingsheng arranged his face into an expression of regret. "However, he simply wasn't fortunate."

The words were perfectly balanced—offending neither side while soothing Du Yibin's emotions.

Du Yibin, oblivious to Song Yingsheng's tactics, found the reasoning sound. He sighed.

"You're right. Unfortunately, among so many in the Study Society, few his age can compare. Such fine talent, taken by Zhang Xiao—I can't swallow this!" He spoke huffily.

Song Yingsheng wasn't familiar with Zhang Jiayu. He was a Jiangxi man who'd only served as Enping County Magistrate here in Guangdong. Zhang Jiayu in Guangzhou was merely a licentiate without much reputation to speak of. But this single telegram had moved three Elders to look favorably on him, and Chief Du's thinly-veiled jealousy made one thing clear: the young man must be an exceptional talent.

"Daoist Cui is unhappy," Du Yibin continued. "I'm also very unhappy. I'd originally planned to request him after he passed the civil service exam, but since he's already with Zhang Xiao, there's no way to ask for him back. Mr. Song, do you have any way to let that fat Cui—I mean Daoist Cui—vent some steam, while also making Zhang Xiao pay?"

Song Yingsheng silently grumbled. Even if Zhang Jiayu were Guangdong's number one talent, it wouldn't warrant going this far. Really undignified!

He thought for a moment. "Since this matter is already settled for now, this student thinks there's no need to rush. If we go raise a ruckus now, we'd only damage harmony."

"Harmony my ass!" Du Yibin blurted. Seeing Song Yingsheng's astonished face, he quickly added, "Go on."

"Yes. Since Chief Zhang has already made him an intern staff aide, the matter isn't finalized yet. After all, a staff aide isn't an official—ah, Great Song civil servant." Song Yingsheng paused. "I recall the Chief telling this student that after Great Song civil servants pass the examination, they must all be assigned through the Cadre Department..."

"Exactly. Though some positions are designated, they still have to go through assignment procedures."

"That's it, then." Song Yingsheng nodded. "This Zhang Jiayu will certainly pass next year's civil service examination. But if Chief Zhang wants to use him, he won't have him apply for a specific designated position—nine times out of ten, it'll be the 'administrative civil servant' general category..."

"Mr. Song, I didn't expect you to understand our Great Song's civil service system so well..." Du Yibin was surprised.

"These examination, selection, and appointment systems—though each dynasty has its own rules—are actually much the same. The Senate is no exception." Song Yingsheng smiled.

"You're right. This 'civil service examination' of various countries was originally copied from the imperial examinations." Du Yibin blurted out another sentence, unwittingly exposing certain secrets. "And after passing?"

"Since he's passed, the destination of these administrative civil servants, I've heard, lies in the Cadre Department's hands. Even if Chief Zhang is a noble Elder, he probably can't interfere in such appointment matters, can he?"

"Right, right—that makes sense!" Du Yibin grasped his meaning at once. Zhang Xiao's so-called "intern staff aide" was essentially trying to claim the person early. But Zhang Jiayu was still an ordinary citizen now. Once he passed the civil service examination, he'd become the Cadre Department's "civil servant awaiting assignment." Exactly where he'd be assigned and under whom—that wasn't for Zhang Xiao alone to decide. He and Cui Hantang could work their contacts to snatch the person back, and Zhang Xiao would have nothing to say about it.

"Mr. Song, you're truly as talented as Zhuge Liang. Impressive, impressive." Du Yibin praised him repeatedly.

Song Yingsheng thought to himself: *Finally fooled him again!* This Chief's working ability was passable, but his political acumen was truly lacking. He knew perfectly well that intercepting Zhang Jiayu after the civil service examination had very little chance of success. It was merely a way to ease Du Yibin's mind temporarily. But he guessed the Chief still harbored some reluctance, so he decided to add a bit more.

"Though Zhang Jiayu is temporarily lost, the Chief can still lock the barn after the horse has fled. Why not reply to Daoist Cui and have him select one or two students from the Study Society to serve as the Chief's staff aides? You're about to take up your post in Zhaoqing—having a few more people to advise would certainly be useful. This way, you'd not only win over the hearts of the Society members, but also attract more people to join."

"But there's no one in the Society who can compare to him..."

Actually, whether there truly was no one, Du Yibin himself didn't know. But none of the Society members had a bigger reputation than Zhang Jiayu—that much was certain.

"Even if there isn't, the Chief can still reap the benefits of buying a horse's bones for a thousand gold pieces. In the future, when recruiting talents, you'll find it easier to win people's hearts."

Du Yibin, having gotten this idea, felt somewhat better. After thinking it over, he asked, "Nothing going on in the county lately, is there?"

"Everything in the county is peaceful. Besides, aren't you about to be transferred to Zhaoqing, Chief?"

"I'll go back to Guangzhou for a bit," Du Yibin said. "Keep an eye on things for me these few days. Also, start preparing for the move."
