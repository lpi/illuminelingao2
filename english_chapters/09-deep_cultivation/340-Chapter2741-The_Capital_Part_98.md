# Chapter 2741: The Capital (Part 97)

Though his words sounded fine, the momentum had noticeably dropped, completely lacking the earlier "destroy them before breakfast" spirit. Manager Shen was puzzled—how had everyone suddenly changed in just a few days?

Could Leng Ningyun have secretly met with them and made some... private deals?

Manager Shen looked suspicious, glancing at Manager Qin. They exchanged looks and separately found excuses to step outside. Seeing no one around, Manager Shen asked: "Old Qin! What's going on in there? Everyone's gone soft!"

"I don't know either." Manager Qin looked bewildered. "Before the New Year, everyone agreed! When we split up to buy notes, everyone was enthusiastic. Besides, even if Delong's notes become waste paper, each house loses only a few hundred taels at most."

"Could that Short-Hair Leng have used some trick and promised them benefits?"

"That... surely not?" Manager Qin hesitated. "We Shanxi Houses have always been united—all for one, one for all. What could Leng Ningyun offer to buy everyone off?"

Manager Shen thought about it—true, Leng Ningyun didn't really have any cards right now.

"How strange!" he muttered.

"I think Leng Ningyun must have used some trick," Manager Qin said. "We should probe everyone's thoughts first."

The two returned to the room one after another. They heard Manager Lu of Feng's speaking expansively: "...This Leng Ningyun will definitely come tonight. If he doesn't, I'm your grandson..."

Manager Shen frowned slightly, thinking: This Manager Lu is still so crude!

Most Shanxi House managers came from humble origins—apprentices and junior clerks who'd worked their way up. Most had only a few years of private education and were barely literate. But years of business polishing had taught them merchant's speech and manner. Only this Manager Lu remained true to form, revealing his nature within a few sentences.

Manager Lu paid no attention to Manager Shen's disdainful expression and continued enthusiastically: "He asked Shuntian Prefecture to unseal, then visited the minor peers. He's clearly planning to open and tough it out. If he's going to tough it out, how could he not show his face at the God of Wealth banquet? He might even be hoping to get some short-term funds from us!"

"Ha ha... Speaking of which, isn't Delong's owner a Short-Hair? I hear the Short-Hairs are quite wealthy!"

"Pity that however rich they are, you and I can't go to Guangdong to collect. Otherwise, we could take our Delong notes to Guangzhou and get full payment—we'd be rich!"

"Dream on! Delong never admits to being Short-Hairs. You go to redeem, and the Guangzhou Short-Hairs say you're a court spy—dragged to the beach and beheaded..."

"Ha ha ha..."

The hall was actually filled with laughter. To Managers Shen and Qin, this cheerful laughter sounded inexplicably strange.

Up to this point in the meeting, on how to run on Delong, no one had offered any strategies. Instead, many were pouring cold water.

How peculiar. Manager Shen had been in the capital over twenty years, working with these people for at least seven or eight years. He knew that though their temperaments differed, in business they were all decisive and ruthless.

Yet the arrow was on the string and had to be released. If this arrow wasn't shot, he couldn't answer to his backers, let alone his owner...

Thinking of his owner, his forehead began to sweat. His decades of reputation, his later years and descendants' prosperity and honor—all depended on this.

He coughed and said: "If the Short-Hairs really reached the capital, our heads would probably be quite unsteady."

"The Short-Hairs reached Guangzhou, but no Guangzhou peer lost his head." Someone said.

Many Shanxi merchants did business in Guangzhou. Haoban Street, where Director Guo had made his fortune, had many Shanxi merchant businesses. They had some idea of the Short-Hairs' situation from correspondence.

"Heh, that's different." Manager Shen sneered. "The Guangzhou peers never offended the Short-Hairs. But we... we've offended Manager Leng terribly..."

These words immediately chilled the previously merry hall. Speaking of running on Delong back then, all eight houses had been involved. Especially when Delong first came to the capital—the eight houses had joined forces and even mobilized official power. If Eunuch Yang behind Leng Ningyun hadn't intervened, Delong would have been destroyed long ago.

Later, though cooperation had been smooth enough, when the Short-Hairs landed in Guangdong, the eight houses had again conspired to label Delong "rebel property" and Leng Ningyun a "Short-Hair spy"—this time far more serious. Had it succeeded, Leng Ningyun might not have survived.

"...Think about it, gentlemen. If you were Leng Ningyun, could you swallow this? Wouldn't you have all of us taken to the execution ground, sitting outside Heniangtan Pharmacy watching your enemies being sliced alive?"

Seeing the frightened expressions on everyone's faces, Manager Shen felt secretly pleased. Look at you fence-sitters!

He continued his incitement: "Beat the snake without killing it, and you'll suffer! Leng Ningyun has just been rescued, and Delong is at its weakest. There are already plenty of rumors outside. All we need is to add fuel to the fire. Without much effort on our part, the depositors and notes outside will run them into the ground!"

More whispering filled the hall. These words weren't groundless.

"Short-Hairs reaching the capital? Unless the sun rises in the west." Manager Lu looked disdainful. "Besides, if the Short-Hairs really came, why would we still be here—greeting them with food and wine?"

"Not doing business anymore?"

"Business? Having offended Leng Ningyun to death, are we supposed to sit in the capital waiting for him to slice us alive? Naturally, we'd quickly pack up and go back to Shanxi. Business can be done anywhere. And life matters more than business..."

Manager Shen most hated this fellow's joking manner, but these words weren't unreasonable. If the Short-Hairs gained power, they couldn't survive in the capital. Conversely, as long as the Short-Hairs didn't come, the capital remained their domain.

Manager Cao coughed—a signal for everyone to stop arguing. He wanted to say some "fair words."

"Everyone, stop arguing. Delong is still a member of our trade guild. Whether they're Short-Hairs, there's no need to guess. If the authorities say so, then so; if the authorities say not, we treat them as not." Manager Cao spoke slowly and deliberately.

"That's right." Everyone nodded in agreement. Manager Shen grew anxious and was about to say something, but Manager Cao waved his hand and continued:

"As for whether Delong is gravely wounded or thriving, that's their own business. We're peers; we can just make a few comments."

Manager Shen was furious. This was practically "defeatism." He was about to challenge this when Manager Cao calmly continued: "As for each house's Delong notes, each does their own business. Those who feel uncertain can redeem them when they open these next few days. Those who think Delong can hold on can just keep them. Bad notes and bad debts are part of daily business in the money trade."

These words covered all bases and were watertight. But Manager Shen knew the previously agreed "united as one, speaking with one voice" plan to crush Delong had become empty words, replaced by "every man for himself."

Though Manager Shen was certain each house was pessimistic about Delong's prospects, and with great profit at stake the run was inevitable, the force of eight houses united versus acting individually were completely different. United action could coordinate pacing and dispatch resources, leaving Delong unable to breathe. Acting separately gave Delong much more room to maneuver.

He wanted to say more, but Manager Yuan muttered: "If Delong really collapses, Eunuch Yang probably won't let it go."

Eunuch Yang was the Director of the Bell and Drum Office. Though it couldn't compare to real power agencies like the Directorate of Ceremonial or Directorate of Imperial Horses, it was still a head of one of the Twenty-Four Offices. Offending him to death would bring consequences they couldn't afford.

"What's there to fear?" Manager Qin said. "Eunuch Yang has already sent people to withdraw his money. The moment they unseal tomorrow, Leng Ningyun will have to obediently hand over a hundred thousand taels. Once Eunuch Yang has his silver, whether Leng Ningyun lives or dies is none of his business."

"True enough..." Manager Yuan was clearly not confident. They'd twice tried to destroy Delong, and twice Eunuch Yang had intervened. The second time, when Delong was suspected of Short-Hair connections, Eunuch Yang had seemed ready to abandon them—yet Delong had safely weathered it anyway. This made them suspect Delong had even more powerful backing beyond Eunuch Yang.

"Eunuch Yang's attitude is probably fifty-fifty." Qiao Wannian, who'd been silent, finally spoke slowly. "He's rushing to withdraw money, showing he's not optimistic about Delong and probably won't strongly protect them. Otherwise, he wouldn't withdraw this sum."

"Old Qiao is right! If he really treated Delong like a godson, he'd be sending timely help, not pulling the rug!" Manager Qin immediately agreed. "He's just watching from the shore as the flood rises. If Delong survives, great; if Delong falls, he hasn't lost much."

"Yes, at worst we can pool a few thousand taels for him afterward." Manager Shen said.

Manager Lu said: "I don't have that much silver to throw down a dog hole..."

Manager Shen was about to argue, but Manager Cao intervened: "That's all future business! What are you arguing about?"

"Speaking of backing, who doesn't have some? Is there any need to fear some Eunuch Yang?" Manager Qin encouraged everyone. "When Wei Zhongxian was in power, he was already friendless. When the current Emperor took the throne, he wasn't a Prince Xin Mansion eunuch. He only climbed to Director of the Bell and Drum Office by flattering former mansion servants. His connections with the inner ministers probably aren't very deep. It's nothing serious."

"Easy for you to say. What if Delong has shares belonging to some inner minister? They just don't show it publicly and have Eunuch Yang hold them on their behalf!"

"If that were true, could Leng Ningyun have been kidnapped?"

...

Just as they were talking animatedly, suddenly a junior servant came in to announce: "Delong's Leng Ningyun, Manager Leng, has arrived!"
