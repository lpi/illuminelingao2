# Chapter 2671: The Capital (Part 27)

Not long after Mr. Zhou returned to the boat, perhaps due to shock or catching a cold on the boat, he developed a fever the next day. Hearing this, Wang Yehao wanted to hire a doctor for him.

"No need for a doctor. Just bring my medicine gourd," Mr. Zhou ordered.

Zhou Lezhi quickly brought the gourd, fetched water from outside, and served him the medicine.

"I'm fine," Mr. Zhou said. "That powder compact..."

"It has been put away in the Teacher's book box." Zhou Lezhi knew this powder compact was expensive but didn't understand why the Teacher specially wanted it back and instructed him to keep it carefully.

"My illness is nothing serious; I'll be fine after a few days of rest." Mr. Zhou said in a low voice, "Go find out for me where Miss Youqing's powder compact came from."

Zhou Lezhi was secretly surprised. The Teacher paid no attention to the female assassin who almost took his life but cared so much about a famous courtesan's powder compact. Could it be he had feelings for Miss Youqing?

With his status and qualifications, he naturally couldn't inquire, so he had to go to Wang Liang.

"Miss Youqing and the old Procuress are now detained in the Prefectural Yamen. I'm afraid they won't pass this hurdle without shedding a few layers of skin," Wang Liang looked around and whispered, "Why do you ask about her? Better to mention it less!"

Zhou Lezhi relayed the Teacher's instruction: "Just want to find her to ask where the powder compact came from."

Wang Liang was amused: "I thought it was something serious! So it's for this powder compact from *Guangli*! Mr. Zhou has good eyes. This thing is the favorite of women nowadays; it sells for forty or fifty taels apiece outside..."

"*Guangli*?"

"It's Guangzhou City! Isn't your home just outside Guangzhou City?" Wang Liang said, "There were two pairs among the gifts presented by the Prefect of Yangzhou yesterday."

"Oh, oh, so it came from Guangzhou!" Although Zhou Lezhi was a "country bumpkin," there were many overseas merchants in Guangzhou, and various "foreign goods" were common. He thought it made sense if this thing came from overseas.

Immediately, he reported the news to Mr. Zhou. He saw Mr. Zhou's eyes widen, seemingly not even feverish anymore, and asked: "Really?!"

"Really. I heard the Lord Prefect also gave two pairs to the Master."

"Go find Master Wang immediately and say I want to see the powder compacts sent by the Prefect."

So Zhou Lezhi had to go to Wang Yehao again. Wang Yehao couldn't understand what this Mr. Zhou was up to again, but there was no harm in letting him see since he wanted to.

"Just take them to him. If he likes them, it doesn't matter if he keeps a pair..."

Seeing the pair of powder compacts brought to him, Mr. Zhou studied them over and over for half a day, his brows tightly furrowed. He also took the one swiped from Miss Youqing's room and compared them back and forth, not speaking for a long time.

Zhou Lezhi waited for half a day but didn't hear the Teacher speak. Thinking the Teacher liked them, he said cautiously, "Master Wang said, if the Teacher likes these powder compacts, just keep them..."

"I don't want the things; I just wanted to verify something." Mr. Zhou exhaled deeply.

"Verify?"

"En, a guess." Mr. Zhou said briefly. At this moment, his wretched energy from last night was completely gone, transformed into a man of vicissitudes full of worry.

"Who was that assassin?" he suddenly asked.

"This student doesn't know." Zhou Lezhi was very clever. "Shall I go ask Master Wang?"

"Okay, go ask."

"Could it be the Teacher has intentions towards the assassin?"

"Nonsense! What's so good... to look at about a female assassin!" A smile appeared on Mr. Zhou's face. "But I almost kicked the bucket; I should at least know the origin!"

"No harm in him knowing." Hearing Zhou Lezhi's relay, Wang Yehao had already calculated in his heart. "Just go invite him over."

It turned out this female assassin was named Wei Yi, the daughter of Wei Dazhong, the "Black Whirlwind" of the Donglin Party listed in the Eunuch Party's *Roll Call of Generals*. After her father was framed and killed, the Eunuch Party didn't stop but threw her eldest brother Wei Xueyi into jail in the name of recovering ill-gotten gains. Before long, the brother died of illness in prison. Fearing the Eunuch Party would cut the weeds and dig up the roots, the family members scattered and hid.

A few days ago, she accidentally heard that the government took away her father's former advisor Jin Wenchi. Later, strangers went to investigate around the Wei family. She thought the Eunuch Party had some conspiracy again, preparing to fabricate charges to persecute her family. Relying on some martial arts she had learned in the past, she followed Liu Zhao with the assistance of an old servant.

Although Wang Yehao wasn't a member of the Eunuch Party, his "Zhejiang Party" was very close to the Eunuch Party. Wei Yi thought he wanted to persecute her family to seek merit, so she had the thought of assassination. Following the fleet to Yangzhou, she heard the Prefect was hosting a banquet at the Moon Plucking Tower, so she climbed the wall into the brothel at night, sneaked into the courtesan queen's room, and prepared to wait for the rabbit by the tree.

"Tsk tsk, this Miss Wei is a heroine among women." Mr. Zhou danced with joy upon hearing this. "Isn't the Wei family from Wuxi? Unexpectedly, Jiangnan girls are also so staunch."

"She is different from ordinary official young ladies. She went to Mount Heng at the age of ten and bowed under the Mount Heng Sect. She counts as half a daughter of the *Jianghu*."

"So that's how it is, so that's how it is. This definitely warrants a meeting."

Wang Yehao thought letting them meet was fine; anyway, these two were grasshoppers on the same string now. He immediately asked for Miss Wei to be invited out.

After Miss Wei was captured, she had already met Jin Wenchi, and Jin was someone Master Wang had settled. She was young after all and didn't know much about officialdom matters. How could she be a match for an old fox of officialdom? She was coaxed by Master Wang in a few words, thinking this Master Wang was "body in Cao camp, heart in Han" [secretly loyal]. She regretted incessantly on the spot, saying this was a "misunderstanding."

As for the "victim" Mr. Zhou in this misunderstanding, she inevitably had to apologize.

"Isn't your family a scholar family? How can you fight so well?" Mr. Zhou rubbed his still aching bruises, expressing incomprehension. "Truly a heroine in a headscarf!"

Zhou Lezhi vaguely felt that the Teacher's praise wasn't that pure. Looking at his beaming face, he seemed to have completely forgotten the danger of almost losing his life at the scene a few days ago.

"This is a long story. Years ago, Mr. Guo Yuan [Wei Dazhong] knew the official path was dangerous and feared no eggs would remain intact under an overturned nest. Also, the Miss was weak and sickly. He specially entrusted her to Abbess Miejin of Mount Heng." Jin Wenchi explained.

"Entering the mountain gate, the little girl originally ignored worldly affairs. Who knew the Prefect of Datong, to please the Wei Rebel [Wei Zhongxian], insisted on building a Living Shrine for that castrated goods in my pure place. The Abbess refused, so bailiffs created all kinds of difficulties. I feared my background would be exposed and implicate others, so I bid farewell to the Abbess, went down the mountain, and returned to my hometown. Only after returning home did I know my father and brother had lost their lives at the hands of the Eunuch Party..." Wei Yi cried again at this point.

"I wonder what your plans are for the future?" Mr. Zhou looked concerned, moving Zhou Lezhi secretly.

"No need to worry about this. I have planned to let Mr. Jin accompany Miss Wei back to Shaoxing to settle temporarily—hide from the wind in my manor for a few months, and make plans later." After speaking, he gave Mr. Zhou a deep look. Zhou Lezhi couldn't help wondering secretly what kind of move this was.

Sending away Jin and Wei, Mr. Zhou ran to find Wang Yehao again impatiently. Entering the door, he didn't even care about saluting and said directly: "My Lord, let's go to Guangzhou. I know the clue to the Universe Mirror!"

"Teacher, don't be anxious. This official already has a plan for this matter." Wang Yehao said unhurriedly. "This official still has public duties and took leave to come out this time. Now having been away for many days, I must return to the capital to report back and cancel leave, and can no longer travel with the Teacher. This place is ten thousand *li* away from Guangzhou Prefecture. If the Teacher goes alone, I fear there will be many dangers and obstacles. This official intends to send Liu Zhao and Wang Zhi to go together to take care of the Teacher's daily life. Presumably, the Teacher already knows that although Liu Zhao is called a family servant, he is actually a Jinyiwei. Going this time, he will surely protect the Teacher's safety."

Zhou Lezhi had long heard the Teacher and Wang Liang talk about the Universe Mirror. Wang Liang, in particular, gritted his teeth whenever the Universe Mirror was mentioned—he had been beaten dozens of strokes for this rubbish item, and his buttocks couldn't touch a stool for several days. But what use this Universe Mirror actually had, Wang Liang didn't know, and the Teacher kept his mouth shut, only saying it was a very important thing.

"Many thanks to the Master for the arrangement. I plan to set off as soon as possible."

"Good. This official has already notified them. Once packed properly, you can choose a day to depart." Wang Yehao seemed somewhat reluctant to part. "Thinking about it, this official meeting the Teacher can also be said to be a strange fate. Going to Guangzhou this time, I don't know when we can meet again."

"No problem. Once I find the Universe Mirror, I can reach the capital with a *swoosh*." Zhou Lezhi really couldn't compliment the traffic speed of this spacetime. Wait until the wormhole is found, better to travel back to modern times and take a flight to Beijing.

"Truly godlike skill. When the Teacher returns, this official will invite all the courtesan queens in the capital to wash the dust for the Teacher."

"Good, good, good, it's a deal!" Although the Teacher failed twice in plucking flowers, he was still very persistent.

"This official has one more matter to ask the Teacher for advice." Wang Yehao looked around, and Zhou Lezhi and others retreated immediately.

Seeing no one around, he leaned over and asked in a low voice, "The Teacher checked the Book of Life and Death before and said the matter of Prince Xin ascending the throne—is it true?"

"That must be true!" The Teacher said confidently, with an expression of having everything under control.

"Since the Teacher has asserted it, this official naturally believes it. Just that parting this time by ten thousand *li*, and the court situation changes in a blink of an eye, does the Teacher have a silk bag [tips/tricks] to teach me?"

He took out a codebook, looked at it, and said, "It's a matter of August, two more months. Then Eunuch Wei will be in trouble. By December, the big situation will be set, and the Eunuch Party will be wiped out in one pot."

"The matter of seeking the mirror is not urgent. What Your Excellency said before was indeed effective. But the matter is significant. Now separating and acting independently, contacting from the middle, letter exchanges need an address. I wonder if the Teacher has an elegant title? We can use this to address each other in the future without naming names."

Mr. Zhou thought for a moment and said, "In the future, Master Wang just needs to call me 'Hearthstone Immortal'."

"Hearthstone Immortal..." Wang Yehao twisted his beard and muttered, "Good! But the title 'Immortal' is inevitably too conspicuous. How about calling 'Hearthstone Daoist'?"

"No harm, no harm." Mr. Zhou agreed and asked back, "In that case, how should this student address the Master?"

"En," Wang Yehao muttered for a moment and said, "Since the Teacher has entered my staff, this student is the Teacher's East Host. You can just call me 'Shi Weng' [Stone Old Man]."
