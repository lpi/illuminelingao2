# Chapter 2628: Kun Thieves Go to the Countryside

Jin Zhu watched very curiously, turning head to ask a person watching together beside: "Why does Master practice nursing home (guards) in this place?"

That person seeing it was Jin Zhu, also greeted: "Brother Zhu back. This is not practicing nursing home, is practicing Manor Ding (*Zhuang Ding*). Our manor opened an altar, named Eight Immortals Society. Wait until after rice harvest, whole manor wants to practice together. Those three heads wrapped in black kerchiefs are three apprentice brothers creating altar and performing magic. The one on left is Third Apprentice Brother Sha Er, practicing Iron Head Skill, hand using a chain whip, nickname is 'Iron Chain God Whip.' Right side, that fat one on right is Second Apprentice Brother, called Ma Jin, practicing Iron Belly Skin, using a white wax pole, nickname 'Changban Golden Spear.' The most formidable is Eldest Apprentice Brother, the one inspecting. Eldest Apprentice Brother calls Chen Sheng, practicing Golden Bell Cover, whole body invulnerable to swords and guns. Few days ago, someone took Kun thief's fast gun to test Eldest Apprentice Brother's Golden Bell Cover, firing a gun at Eldest Apprentice Brother. You guess what happened?"

Saying that person wiped full mouth of saliva, looked at Jin Zhu complacently. Seeing Jin Zhu listening with full concentration, continued saying: "Eldest Apprentice Brother caught that gun bullet in one mouth, *ga beng ga beng* like chewing fried beans, swallowed the gun bullet. Then patted belly saying, 'Didn't put salt, too tasteless.'"

Jin Zhu couldn't help surprised saying: "Really so formidable?"

"That's not it!" That person said firmly, "Whole manor people were all watching at this threshing ground then." Three or two idlers watching together beside also chimed in together. Also someone pointed to a banyan tree, "Then tested a gun at that banyan tree first. That gun bullet hasn't been taken down till now."

Jin Zhu pointed to incense table asking: "Is this opened altar also White Lotus Sect?"

"Talking nonsense." A person who didn't insert words just now said urgently: "What we worship is not White Lotus Sect. That is Jade Emperor's tablet!"

Since Shandong Smell Incense Sect (*Wenxiang Jiao*) riot in Tianqi period, this old brand folk religious sect White Lotus Sect was already known to all under heaven. Xu Hongru was also famous far and wide; various legends about his "Magic Power" already reached the level of "Strange Power Chaos Spirits." Even in place like Guangdong where folk religious sects were not too flourishing, White Lotus Sect's name was also no one unknown. That person hearing "White Lotus Sect" three words, immediately came a Denial Three Combo (*Fouren Sanlian*). Then hurriedly explained: "This time it is Jade Emperor Great Emperor seeing lower realm Kun thieves using demon art to stir wind and make waves, ordered West Queen Mother (*Xi Wangmu*) to come out of mountain to accept disciples, conquering demons and catching monsters, protecting Great Ming rivers and mountains. Fairy Huang is West Queen Mother's personal disciple. Round fan held in hand is two magic treasures bestowed by Queen Mother. That fan can fan Five Elements Wind. Fairy Huang is extremely efficacious. Now leading women in manor cultivating magic and refining immortal formation in Master Li family's villa. Practicing seven seven forty nine days can succeed. By then can move Heavenly Soldiers and Heavenly Generals to come to assist. Brother Zhu your home one also practicing magic with Fairy Huang; she didn't talk to you?" Saying realized Jin Zhu up and down again, then laughed meaningfully.

Although Jin Zhu farthest only circled in nearby few villages, Xiaoyao Market was also a place people coming and going. Compared to ordinary rural village men counted as seeing more world. Listening only half believing half doubting. But since this was Master Li's idea, he naturally dared not question. Watched sword practice for a while again, then continued to look for work.

Originally when harvesting early rice and planting late rice around May was exactly the season rural short-term workers were busiest. Harvesting, sunning paddy, threshing. Finishing early rice, without catching a breath immediately needed ferilizing, tilling land, releasing water, transplanting seedlings... planting late rice down. Truly not wasting a quarter hour. Working from morning till dark, no time to rest. Head sunning by sun, feet on scalding field. But this was also season short term workers income most abundant, eating best. Not only three meals of rice a day enough, but also seeing meat/fish. Now already end of May; every family was preparing for Summer Harvest Summer Planting season. Any family with much land had to agree with short term workers in advance, avoiding being caught off guard when time came.

Jin Zhu went to old customers of previous years for a round, named "Asking Peace," actually going to agree on work. What comforted him was that labor demand did not reduce. After Australians came to "Clarify Fields and Acres," although New Field Tax promulgated by Australians was nominally higher than Great Ming, because property rights were distinct, field tax calculation clear, payment simple, no longer needing to bear many additions and allocations coming from unknown origins, burden of many landlords lightened instead. Plus Australians' demand for grain increased significantly, many families expanded planting area, labor use also increased. Some field households seeing he was a good hand at work, asked him not to do short term work, better come to be a Long-term Worker, treatment excellent.

Li Xiujie only said "Think about it," actually didn't take these invitations seriously. Wanting to be Long-term Worker better go to Master's family. Anyhow same clan, more or less had some care. Besides how much money could Long-term Worker accumulate? He ate enough losses these years: Master family said nicely when being Long-term Worker, how much silver a year, eating wearing all Master family's; arriving at Master family, everything needed money. Calculating big account at year end, getting sixty or seventy percent wage counted as not bad. What made him most unwilling was besides farming and working, Master family also used them as slaves. Any heavy work rough work in residence called Long-term Worker to do, not even a reward money.

Fortunately after walking this round, he filled up time of following two months too. Wage was also more generous than past. He calculated finishing these two months busy, could also save up a sum of money. Could go to Dongguan to buy a few pills of "Cough Suppressing Pill" (*Zhenke Wan*)—said that medicine cured coughing most efficaciously, effective once taking. Just price expensive; one pill cost fifty *wen*.

Although incense ash of Fairy Huang begged by wife also showed effect, couldn't achieve curing root; eating a dose only better for a few days. And he was unwilling wife went to "Cultivate Magic" every day. He always felt this "Cultivating Magic" had problem. Even if no problem, Lian Niang wasting half a day every two or three days he was not reconciled either—with this time, doing what was not good!

Money saved from buying medicine, save up first. Waiting when Clan Family released reclaiming again, use this money to interact relationships, could also receive reclaiming ten or so *mu* land. Reclaimed out would be own tenant land. He wouldn't need to live by doing odd jobs like this anymore. If own mother could cure cough asthma disease well, helping hand at home, Lian Niang could credit some silkworm cocoons from Silk Warehouse back home to reel silk, earning a few money more or less, family could be broader again...

On the way back yet, sun shone on his face, hot烘烘 (warm), Li Xiujie didn't feel uncomfortable at all. This hot feeling rarely made [him] feel comfortable. This days having hope people also had spirit—although everyone said neither Great Ming nor Great Song, whoever came had to pay tax and pay grain. Didn't expect Australians coming this time, actually made his days much better. He pondered since wanting to do farm work, had to buy some new farm tools at market.

Most important farm tool for harvesting paddy saw a handy sharp sickle. This object his family naturally always prepared; using feeling handy too. Just some days ago he saw Australian New Farm Tools in a shop at Xiaoyao Market. That was truly steel edge good, using handy too. Just thing looked very light and thin, more or less made him doubt "Not durable." Speaking of price, originally very expensive, now also not differing few money from ordinary sickle.

A few days ago he heard people bought saying, Australian farm tools were very sturdy, not as delicate as he thought. So he also planned to buy one; doing work would be brisk some—after all he had to do work for own land in future!

Thinking here, Jin Zhu heart beautiful *zizi*, footsteps brisk rushing back. When fast arriving Li Family Enclosure, saw a small boat coming in river channel, heading towards village direction.

River channels crisscrossed in Dongguan here; mostly used boats replacing steps. Coming a small boat was most common. However people on this ordinary small boat attracted his attention. Three or four young men squatting or sitting on boat bow, were talking and laughing loudly.

From their short hair and button-down short jacket, Jin Zhu immediately knew: This was "False Kuns" coming!

Speaking of Kun thief bandits Jin Zhu had seen quite a few when doing odd jobs at Xiaoyao Market. Initially Kun soldiers just sat on small fire wheel emitting black smoke arriving at Xiaoyao Market. Merchants and folks on market fled empty. Only Market Master led a few servants staying to prepare supporting errand. Kun thief bandits had a meal and rested for two hours (one *shichen*) then boarded boat leaving. Didn't buy anything, didn't conscript anything either, just called Market Master's manager to boil several big pots of boiling water to supply.

Later, he saw "Tax Bureau" people coming to market to levy tax again, also sitting small fire wheel, coming to Xiaoyao Market under escort of a squad of Kun soldiers. Also starting from that tax collection, Australian Silver Dollars and Notes started circulating—because tax collectors didn't recognize white silver and copper coins. Various shops panicked for a while; no one knew where to find these "Australian Money." Fortunately not long after a grocery shop on market hung out sign of "Exchange Agency."

Later, it was Australian "Work Team" last winter, coming here to "Clear Property Clarify Tax" again. People coming this time were much more. Many young Kun people, slinging bags, going down to countryside to measure land under protection of teams of Kun soldiers. At that time this Work Team's lair was set on market. Tents built relying on wharf. Wharf parked full of small boats, also small fire wheels mounting cannons. Jin Zhu was also called to work, helping unload mysterious wooden boxes one by one from transport supply ships, all written "Secret" with black paint on top.

Later, Kun thief bandits didn't show face much. Although occasionally a few False Kuns handled affairs on market, or passing Kun ships docked to have a meal. Never saw people going to countryside anymore. Common people all breathed a sigh of relief. This "Kun" finally finished passing.

Who was emperor, who was County Magistrate, common people didn't care much. But starting from old habits, very afraid of seeing "Official Family" coming to countryside—as long as these people showed face, either losing money or being beaten, absolutely no good thing.

What did these "False Kuns" come here for? Jin Zhu heart a burst of nervousness. Going down along river, was Li Family Enclosure!
