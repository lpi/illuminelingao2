# Chapter 2711: The Capital (Part 67)

Zhangjiawan was no more than twenty *li* from the capital, yet it was a major destination outside the city. Five major waterways converged here: the North Canal, the Tonghui River, the Xiao Taihou River, the Liangshui River, and the Ganggou River. With excellent water transport conditions, it was an important water-land transportation hub and logistics distribution center at the northern terminus of the Grand Canal, known as the "First Wharf of the Grand Canal."

Goods transported on the canal were mostly distributed here. Merchants coming and going by boat north and south also boarded and disembarked here. Thus, the town's warehousing and lodging industries were highly developed. Even though the world was in turmoil, because of the capital's presence in the north, the flow of goods and people on the canal continued unabated. The market remained thriving. At this hour of evening lodging, inn and restaurant attendants carried lanterns, hawking for customers along the street.

The party pushed through the crowd, ignoring the touts along the way, and walked until they were near the town's north gate. Only then did they stop in front of a large inn.

The attendant welcoming guests at the door immediately came forward, face beaming with smiles. "Do you guests need a meal and lodging?"

The steward nodded. "My master dislikes noise and has womenfolk with him. Do you have a private courtyard?"

The inn attendant hastened to reply, "Yes, yes, we have a spacious courtyard right now. It's guaranteed to be quiet. Only it's a bit pricey—two taels of silver a day."

A whole courtyard was naturally much larger than a single room, but two taels of silver was still a jaw-dropping price. So the attendant quickly added, "Our place is a big establishment. We have ten dishes, five fruits, singing performers and courtesans—whatever the guest needs, just ask..."

The steward cut him off. "None of that is needed. Silver isn't a problem; we only want quiet and clean. First, my master most abhors idle people disturbing him. Second, the mule cart must be parked inside the courtyard. Can you manage that?"

The inn attendant hurriedly said, "Certainly, certainly."

"Take me to see the rooms first."

The steward inspected the guest rooms. The courtyard turned out to be a small three-sided compound—not large, but very quiet. When the door was closed, it was a world unto itself. The steward was quite satisfied. He followed the attendant to the front hall to register in the guest book, then went out to give the signal. Before long, the wealthy young master entered the guest rooms, surrounded by his entourage.

When the mule cart arrived in the courtyard, the mule was led to the inn's stable to be fed—no need to mention that. The inn attendant brought two large buckets of hot water and was about to enter the room to serve when an attendant stepped sideways to block him. The attendant was tall, arms tucked, fists clenched, glaring and frowning, startling the inn worker.

The steward stepped forward with a smile. "My master isn't accustomed to strangers. We'll serve him ourselves; no need for trouble from Second Brother at the inn. Just leave things at the courtyard gate; someone will receive them."

The inn attendant repeatedly said, "Yes, yes." He thought to himself that these wealthy families had so many rules!

The wealthy young master removed his felt hat and took off his cloak. It was none other than Min Zhanlian, the "Soul-Seeking Sword," whom the Daoist Fu had subdued in Shandong years ago.

Min Zhanlian and his junior sister had followed Daoist Fu ever since their subjugation, serving as guardians and propagators. It was not until 1635 that their loyalty was affirmed and they were transferred back to Lingao to receive comprehensive, systematic education. Afterwards, they were formally transferred into the Special Operations Team under the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

Although this Special Operations Team was administratively and personnel-wise under the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, its training was handled by the Special Reconnaissance Team of the Reconnaissance General Bureau. Its purpose was to replace the Special Reconnaissance Team in certain operational scenarios.

Though the Special Reconnaissance Team had outstanding combat capability, because its personnel and training model were "Old Time Space-ified," they themselves had become "Old Time Space-ified." This made them—especially when infiltrating enemy-occupied areas—seem "out of place" in demeanor and speech even with wigs and changed attire. Enormous effort went into disguise.

Thus, the powerful agencies conceived the idea of training a covert action force that could rapidly deploy to enemy-occupied areas. Especially after the Hangzhou Station incident, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's Special Operations Team was established.

The operational team was modeled after the National Police's Tenth Section. Most personnel were former *Jianghu* figures. Among them were "great robbers" like Min Zhanlian, as well as members of "orthodox sects," and escort masters from escort bureaus and households. They originally had rich *Jianghu* experience; doing the work came more naturally to them than the Special Reconnaissance Team, and they were harder to expose.

This time, with a Senator kidnapped, the first group dispatched was the cream of the Special Operations Team: Min Zhanlian's squad.

Back in Shandong, he had lost his crew, leaving only his junior sister Zhou Ruolan. But over these years, he had rebuilt his crew using his original methods. Only this time, the crew was stronger.

At this moment, in the main hall, he silently washed his face with the hot water brought by the attendant. Several years of "serving the Senate and the people" had made his temperament even more steady and experienced.

The attendants returned from patrolling the entire compound and reported: No problems with the inn; it was indeed an established old establishment.

"Old Six, Old Nine, you two take the high watch!" Min Zhanlian ordered. "If we encounter 'road-seekers' at night, just send them off. No need to hide."

The two went off. The others gathered under the lamp.

"This is Zhangjiawan, a major wharf where the canal enters the capital. Dragons and fish mingle here; no matter whose payroll you're on, everyone has eyes and ears here. News of our arrival will be known to many by tomorrow night. There might even be visitors tonight. Everyone sleep lightly."

The attendants nodded in unison.

"We'll stay in Zhangjiawan for a few days. We'll decide based on the situation." Min Zhanlian continued to assign tasks. "The capital is a big place, with dragons and fish mixed, and even more people from the official side. Once inside the city, we'd face many restrictions. Here, although there are also officials, there are no yamens or circuit officials, so it's more convenient to act."

After receiving the mission, Min Zhanlian deeply felt its difficulty. First, a Senator being captured was unprecedented—the pressure was immense. When he followed Daoquanzi (The Daoist of the Stolen Spring), he had faced danger several times and emerged safely. This time, not only was a Senator captured, but there wasn't a single clue. With hundreds of thousands of people inside and outside the capital, in a sea of humanity, how could they search? Second, this mission was extremely urgent, making it difficult to move without a trace. Even if the Intelligence Bureau's ships could deliver them to Tianjin, there were still over a hundred *li* from Tianjin to the capital. A dozen capable men with varied accents traveling light would be noticed the moment they set foot on the official road. Since the enemy dared to kidnap a Senator, they likely knew the Senate's ins and outs well and would probably have planted many observers along the route.

How to quickly and covertly reach the capital became his first problem. After much deliberation, he proposed that rather than "hiding," it was better to "show." The entire squad would present themselves as "*Jianghu* personages"—which was their true face anyway. Without excessive disguise, there would be fewer flaws.

The capital was full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Whether high officials or great merchants or local tycoons, all had secret matters they couldn't or wouldn't do themselves. The Emperor had the Brocade Guard, the Eastern and Western Depots; the nobility used "*Jianghu* personages." Though the Son of Heaven's domain was under strict law, it was also a place where *Jianghu* people thrived like fish in water.

Min Zhanlian planned to use this image to swagger into the capital and act when the opportunity arose.

"Little Qian, tomorrow morning go to the Juchun Garden Teahouse outside Chongwen Gate to meet with the Escort Bureau people." He immediately assigned tasks. "Ruolan, tomorrow investigate news in the town. See how many informants are here, and whether the inn's owner is connected to sea routes or has mountain backers. Little Li, go to the South City. Scout around the Altar of Agriculture, the Sun and Moon Altars, and other sacrificial temples for anything suspicious..."

In no time, he had assigned tasks to everyone. Logically, they should get detailed information after meeting with the Escort Bureau people tomorrow, but Min Zhanlian had another consideration. With Delong's financial power and Heliansheng's connections in the capital, they had surely spread the word about finding the person. The entire capital had probably been turned upside down by various urban foxes and social rats. But this had two unfortunate consequences: first, the kidnappers, fearing their power, might move the hostage; second, taking advantage of the widespread inquiries, they might deliberately release all sorts of smokescreens to confuse the Escort Bureau's vision.

The two escort masters in charge at Heliansheng were either coming up empty-handed or drowning in a sea of leads. Min Zhanlian had no intention of repeating their mistakes.

After assigning tasks, he told everyone to rest and conserve their energy. From the moment they stepped into Zhangjiawan, the mission had officially begun.

The information he received before departing Lingao was about a week old compared to the current situation, so the specifics of how to act would have to wait until Little Qian returned from his meeting tomorrow. But one thing he was fairly certain of: Senator Leng was still in the capital—or at least in the surrounding counties. He hadn't been transferred elsewhere.

The kidnappers hadn't struck randomly; this was premeditated. Such a heavyweight figure would never be casually moved to a place too far away, beyond their reach.

So his focus was simple: first, find an opportunity to locate Leng Ningyun's hiding place.

Once the person was found, the situation would be broken. As for who the mastermind behind the scenes was, he didn't care.

Speaking of the capital, he was no stranger to it. When Min Zhanlian first emerged in the *Jianghu*, he had sold his sword here for several years to officials and nobles. He had killed for the Eunuch Faction and had rescued remnants of the Donglin Faction. Right or wrong, he didn't care—as long as they paid.

Now he served the Australians for no other reason than that they were stronger and wealthier. One day, when dynasties changed, he would be a founding meritorious official, no longer a *Jianghu* assassin who secretly took lives.

What could be easier for advancement than rescuing a Senator?

This heaven-sent opportunity had landed in his hands; he had to seize it well. All along the way, he had been recalling his past experiences in the capital bit by bit—especially those old "connections." From the Brocade Guard and the Eastern Depot to the yamens of Shuntian Prefecture, Daxing and Wanping counties, and the various urban foxes and social rats in the city—he had a few "friends" everywhere. Though he had been out of touch for a long time, as long as the money was right, they should still recognize him.

"I wonder what news the Escort Bureau will have tomorrow."
