# Chapter 2755: The Capital (Part 107)

"The only plan for now is to endure temporarily. Facilitate peace negotiations," Mr. Le said somewhat disappointedly.

"Peace negotiations..." Qian Taichong thought about how the Emperor had indeed revealed such intentions during the audience today, but then thought about the capital gazttes he had read recently and shook his head. "The Imperial Court recently discussed levying the Guangdong Tax to prepare for suppressing the Kun. Since things have come to this, how can we talk about peace negotiations? Moreover, the Kun scoundrels have always had wild ambitions and insatiable greed. They view the Imperial Court as an enemy. When this student was in Lingao, whenever the Great Ming was mentioned, it was either 'False' or 'Usurper', showing a great intention to regard themselves as legitimate..."

"Not so, not so." Zhou Lezhi immediately explained in detail the current internal disputes within the Senate regarding marching south versus north, and the pressure on finances caused by the sudden increase in ruling costs after occupying Liangguang.

Qian Taichong was more surprised the more he listened. Among the scholars in the Great Ming territory who could be called "knowing the Kun", he could be ranked among the best. Not only had he fought with the Kun scoundrels, but he had also been a captive of the Kun scoundrels, received training, and done clerical work. When he was released, he received an invitation to stay deeply employed. If he hadn't been unwilling to "follow the thieves", he would be a "fake Kun" by now, maybe even a "cadre" in some county in Liangguang.

Speaking of understanding the Kun scoundrels' system, internal situation, and personnel, he believed that no second person in the Great Ming knew so thoroughly.

Unexpectedly, after talking with this Mr. Le, he realized that his own knowledge was truly like a drop of water in the ocean.

Ideally, the one who truly understood the "Imperial Court" of the Kun scoundrels and knew the "Senator's mind" was only this Mr. Le in front of him!

He was surprised: "Sir has great talent! To actually know the Kun scoundrels so thoroughly..."

He suddenly realized that when this eloquent young man in front of him spoke of the Kun scoundrels, he had quite the temperament of the Real Kun and Fake Kun he had seen in Lingao. Could it be that he is...

Mr. Le seemed to know what he was thinking and sighed: "It would be good if I were!"

"Why does Sir say this?"

"If I were a Kun scoundrel, I would definitely try to persuade the Senators to be friendly with the Great Ming. We are all of the Huaxia lineage; why attack each other! Wasting money, grain, and human lives in vain, and letting the barbarians take advantage!" Speaking of this, he couldn't help but get excited.

Qian Taichong said: "What Sir says is extremely true. It's just that even if the Kun scoundrels are willing to negotiate peace for a while, I'm afraid they will turn their faces ruthlessly in the future..."

Mr. Le sighed: "In the current situation, dragging it out for a moment is a moment. Besides, the Kun scoundrels are humans, and my Great Ming's officials, gentry, and common people are also humans. If they can build big cannons and fire-wheel ships, can't we build them?"

"But we have no one who understands these. When this student was in Lingao, all machinery and appliances were manufactured by the Real Kun and taught to the Fake Kun to use. The Fake Kun only knew how to follow the rules. They knew nothing about the reasons within. Important machinery was absolutely not put in the hands of the Fake Kun."

"If we don't understand, just let the Kun scoundrels teach us," Zhou Lezhi said. "Master the Kun skills to resist the Kun."

Qian Taichong only felt that this Mr. Le was indulging in wild fantasy and said: "The Kun scoundrels and the Great Ming are enemy states. Even if both sides can negotiate peace, how could the Kun scoundrels come to teach?"

"Hehe, Sir does not know. The Kun scoundrels govern the country as merchants, and their nature is the most greedy. As long as there is silver to earn, how can they not earn it?" Zhou Lezhi smiled contemptuously. "Sir probably knows that in these years, various military towns have purchased many so-called Nanyang guns, right?"

"I have heard a little; I heard they are guns from the Kun scoundrels."

"Exactly. With the two countries at war, they still sell such sharp weapons for killing. How is it different from handing a knife to someone?" Zhou Lezhi sneered. "Not to mention the Kun scoundrels, even for the Great Ming, the merchants of the Shanxi family trade at Shahukou and various border walls, saying they do business with the Mongols, but in reality, they are all trading with the Tartars. The Tartars' ironware and grain are mostly obtained from sales within the pass!"

"There is actually such a thing!" Qian Taichong felt blood rushing to his head; he didn't expect such things to exist. "Does the Imperial Court not care?"

"The Imperial Court naturally wants to care, but with this profit of one gaining ten, as long as it is achieved, who is willing to let go? Since ancient times, it is said that no one does a losing business, but someone does a business that risks beheading. let alone this ten-fold, twenty-fold profit!"

Qian Taichong was dumbfounded. In these years, he had been tossing about around Zheng Sen and indeed hadn't paid attention to the domestic situation. He didn't expect it to have eroded to this point!

"Mr. Qian, you have stayed in Zhangzhou Bay for too long. Do you not understand the situation outside at all?" Zhou Lezhi said slowly, "The Imperial Court's situation is already as precarious as a pile of eggs! Punishing the Kun is quick death; negotiating peace can still save a breath. Mastering the Kun's superior skills to strengthen ourselves and planning slowly, perhaps there is still salvation!"

Qian Taichong shivered and praised loudly: "What a 'Master the Kun skills to strengthen ourselves'! One word from Sir is better than ten years of reading poetry and books!"

"You flatter me. This is actually not my own insight either. The Yuyuan Society in Guangzhou has the largest collection of Kun books and knows the most about the Kun situation. It's just that with the fall of Liangguang, the members are scattered, and these collections probably can't be preserved..."

Qian Taichong hesitated slightly and asked: "This head of the Yuyuan Society, I heard he is Master Liang Cunhou?"

"Oh, you know him?"

"I know a little." Qian Taichong hid a little; in fact, Liang Cunhou had sent someone to contact him, intending to rope in the remnant forces of the Zheng family, and he even made a special trip to Guangzhou to discuss it. It was just that Liang Cunhou later discovered that the Zheng clique was torn apart, so the intention of alliance could not be realized.

"Master Liang is loyal to the Imperial Court! Unfortunately, trapped in Guangzhou, living among tigers and wolves, I'm afraid he can hardly protect himself," Zhou Lezhi sighed.

"It is a pity; the Liang family is a prestigious family in Guangdong..."

"Even if it is a prestigious family, it probably won't play any role at this moment. I only worry..." Zhou Lezhi frowned, "He can't hold back and will waste his life in vain!"

Speaking of this, the two sat facing each other, sighing. After a while, Qian Taichong laughed: "You and I should work together for the Imperial Court to recover the Divine Land. Why make the sigh of Xinting?"

"Sir is right!" Zhou Lezhi laughed. "In the future, when handling Kun affairs, I will still need Sir's great assistance."

"I am willing, only the Young Master..."

"Sir, if you only focus your eyes on this tiny Zhangzhou Bay, even if the Emperor is willing to lend you a hand, the Zheng family cannot return to the past."

Qian Taichong was dumb for a moment, and only after a while did he say: "This student only seeks a clear conscience."

Zhou Lezhi smiled: "I, on the other hand, believe that if Sir wants to revitalize the Zheng family, you must start from this 'Kun affair'."

Qian Taichong was startled, and after thinking again, he laughed: "Sir does not know about this. If we talk about dealings with the Kun scoundrels, Zheng Lian and Zheng Cai have long been doing it."

Although the Kun scoundrels blockaded the Zheng family's overseas trade channels, they did not cut off the Zheng family's trade. Therefore, the various factions of the fragmented Zheng clique turned into product suppliers on the spot, selling all kinds of Fujian products to the "Kun merchants" who came to Zhangzhou to trade.

"...Although they hang all kinds of signs, one can know with their heels that most of them are the Kun scoundrels' properties, or otherwise, merchants supported by the Kun scoundrels."

These merchants came to various places in Zhangzhou Bay, buying raw materials on a large scale and dumping various "Kun goods" and the table salt that Fujian lacked. Business was very booming.

"...It just happens that Anping is the poorest. Back then, the Kun scoundrels broke the city and stripped Anping bare, leaving nothing behind. Rebuilding the residence and city walls cost a lot of money. As for the Zheng family's trade routes and shops, the Young Master didn't touch a bit of them. Now we can only rely on a few farm manors and a few thousand mu of land to collect rent for a living! Even these few thousand mu of land cannot escape their coveting!" Qian Taichong sighed. "If not for this, I wouldn't have rashly come to the Capital to find a channel!"

"Do the Kun scoundrels also have business dealings with you?"

"Naturally, they do. It's just that I have nothing but fish catches and rice here, which can't sell for a good price."

"Why not plant sugarcane?"

"Plant sugarcane?" Qian Taichong was stunned; he really hadn't thought about this. First, he was not a Fujianese; second, he was very unfamiliar with farming. He more or less still had the concept of "grain as the foundation." "This has never been thought of. However, the farm manors have always grown sugarcane. If we switch to other crops, I'm afraid the tenants won't know how."

"Now everywhere in Fujian grows sugarcane. If you want to switch, presumably it's not difficult," Zhou Lezhi said. "The Kun scoundrels have two biggest businesses." He held up one finger, "Silk." Then he held up a second finger, "Sugar."

He said slowly: "As long as you have sugarcane, you don't have to worry about not being able to sell it. And... you can run a sugar factory yourself, turn the sugarcane into sugar, and then sell it to the Kun scoundrels. You can earn a lot more money."

Plant sugarcane? Make sugar? Qian Taichong pondered for a moment and said, "Sir's idea is excellent, but running a sugar factory and boiling sugar is more difficult than planting sugarcane. Where to find such manpower..."

"Naturally, go ask the Kun scoundrels for teaching."

Qian Taichong was dumbfounded. After a long while, he said: "Sir, do not joke! Although this student has business dealings with the Kun scoundrels, this sugar is the capital for their rise to fortune. How could they be willing to teach the art of sugar making to us? Wouldn't they earn more by buying sugarcane at a low price, making sugar, and selling it at a high price?"

"Hehe, this is Sir knowing one but not knowing two," Zhou Lezhi laughed. "To open a sugar factory and make sugar, you need workers, a site, housing, and warehouses... Before the sugar is made, your seven necessities for opening the door all require money everywhere. This sugar factory requires huge investment, yet can only operate for less than half a year. In comparison, by directly buying your sugar and selling it to Westerners and Easterners, they save the expense of processing. Isn't it more profitable? You calculate the accounts in this!"

Qian Taichong was still a bit confused. Seeing that his brain couldn't turn the corner for a while, Zhou Lezhi reminded him: "Not talking about sugar, just talk about rice. Is it the farmer who grows rice and sells grain who makes more money, or the grain merchant?"

Now Qian Taichong suddenly realized and said: "That's it! Those clad in silk are not the silkworm rearers!"

"That's it. What the Kun scoundrels want are commercial channels. This is also the most profitable thing. Making sugar is not a matter of state strategy. If you want to do it, they will be eager for it." Saying this, he mentioned that in Lingao and Guangzhou, the Kun scoundrels had solicited merchants to build factories and transferred technology and equipment.

"...Guangzhou also auctioned several projects. The Kun scoundrels helped build factories and train craftsmen, and even the machines were arranged by them. If you want to run a sugar factory, you can also follow this method."
