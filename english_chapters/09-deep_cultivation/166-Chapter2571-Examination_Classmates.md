# Chapter 2571 - Examination Classmates

There were also several varieties that, though containing the same yellow powder, revealed their true nature under the microscope—some kind of mineral. These were completely fake drugs with no antibiotic ingredients added at all.

From the different formulations, she speculated that these Lushi Powders probably came from different drug merchants, but the antibiotic raw materials they used should come from the same supply channel. After all, only the Senate could produce this stuff. However, neither Jingshan nor the guards could discover the source of these "miracle drugs."

"Looks like the criminal gang in Guangzhou is quite vigilant." Zheng Mingjiang had a bad feeling.

By rights, her investigation could end here. She could compile the findings into a report and hand it over to Mu Min to handle. A drug leakage case was definitely no small matter—the National Police would certainly spare no effort in investigating it.

But Zheng Mingjiang wasn't willing to let go just yet. As the saying goes, different trades are separated by mountains. Though the National Police's establishment included sanitary police, they mainly handled epidemic prevention and sanitation inspections—they weren't closely connected to pharmaceuticals, so there was no specialized expertise to speak of. Having them investigate might well miss important leads.

But investigating the case herself was somewhat risky. As a female Elder, she frankly stood out too much. Even wearing hanfu couldn't disguise her identity—the moment she opened her mouth, her cover would be blown.

After much thought, Zheng Mingjiang decided to first take a trip to Foshan—because of the minor Elders doing internships there, it was currently a priority governance zone with comprehensive safeguards.

"Alright, rest a bit first. Pack your things and get ready to head out. Might as well take this opportunity to go have some fun."

"Where are we going?"

"We'll visit Foshan first," Zheng Mingjiang said.

Before going to Foshan, Zheng Mingjiang went to see Liu Xiang with an official document bearing Shi Niaoren's signature and the Health Ministry's official seal. She expressed the Health Ministry's concern and support for health and sanitation affairs in the Guangdong Region, particularly hospital operations, and stated willingness to further guide medical and health work in Guangdong. Therefore, they had decided to conduct inspections and guidance on medical records, prescriptions, pharmacy ledgers, and related accounts in the Guangdong Region, especially Guangzhou Special Municipality, and hoped Mayor Liu would provide support.

"Grand Prefect, I just came from the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital and found that our young doctors urgently need guidance from the Senate. Otherwise, when our generation gets old, who will treat us? The Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital is already considered the model of excellence for the Guangdong Region—other regional hospitals and clinics need the Senate's care even more."

After obtaining Liu Xiang's support, Zheng Mingjiang also went to Joint Logistics to see Elder Hong Huangnan, expressing that supporting and helping the Bōbō Army and National Army receive proper treatment and care at field hospitals was an unshirkable responsibility of the Health Ministry. She similarly obtained Joint Logistics' support.

"Sigh, when I set out, I really just wanted to guide the kids on writing medical records." Zheng Mingjiang sighed. She hadn't expected to use official documents this way—she wasn't even sure if it was compliant.

After completing these tasks, she specifically instructed the secretary she was leaving behind: "Little Guo, you've come at a good time. Remember to follow up on getting the prescription ledgers submitted from various locations. If you don't push them, they'll definitely drag it out day after day, and eventually there'll be no more news. Also, properly organize and register everything when it arrives. The rest can wait until we return from Foshan."

"Yes, Chief." Little Guo reported holding a telegraph notepad: "Just received a telegram from Lingao saying the medicines you requested have all been shipped. A pharmaceutical company representative is accompanying the shipment. You said this matter was important, so I came to find you as soon as I received the telegram."

"Mm, very good." At this point Zheng Mingjiang's indecisiveness flared up again. Should she proceed as originally planned, pretending nothing had happened, letting the naturalized citizens receive and transfer the goods as normal, ultimately throwing the drugs into the black hole, then try to trace the vine to find the melons? Or should she alert the snakes by disturbing the grass? After hesitating for three seconds, Zheng Mingjiang decided not to overthink it—just go with her sixth sense.

"If he arrives in Guangzhou before I return, go to the dock to meet him. Instruct him to strictly follow procedures and wait for me to return before handing off directly to me."

"Regional Deputy Commander, intelligence from Police Section Nine." The Political Security Bureau investigator placed a document on Yang Cao's desk.

Yang Cao had been contemplating the portraits on the wooden blackboard and the dense network of different-colored cotton threads. Only upon hearing the staffer's voice did she come back to her senses. She picked up the file and quickly flipped through it, saying: "Salmon went to the Academy. Didn't expect the bighead carp from Dragon Mountain to surface for air too. That's another confirmed sleeper for bighead carp, and they also caught a minnow. Good work. With Elder Li's organized materials, these stupid fish are much simpler than the old loach."

After reading, Yang Cao pinned another small paper slip onto the network on the wooden blackboard, representing a new target, connecting them to the existing portraits with red thread.

For internal communication convenience and to reduce information leakage risk, Political Security had given these target individuals codenames. Chen Zizhuang's codename was "Salmon," Chen Bangyan was "Bighead Carp," Kuang Lu was "Minnow," and Liang Cunhou was the slippery "Old Loach"...

The investigator reported: "Salmon has arranged to meet Old Turtle [He Wuzhou] and Liu Dalin at Donggao Villa. Should we conduct surveillance?"

"Liu Dalin is Chief Councillor of the Senate's Consultative Assembly. Political vetting grade 2C—reliable. With manpower tight right now, no need to allocate extra people to watch these fish this time. The undercover line should be careful not to get exposed." Yang Cao flicked ash from her cigarette into the ashtray.

"Understood."

After taking a final drag, Yang Cao stubbed out the cigarette butt in the glass ashtray, then added several paragraphs of explanation to a document that had already been drafted, handing it to the investigator with instructions: "Deliver this personally to Elder Zhang Xiao in Nanhai County."

To avoid repeating the mistakes of the "Parasol Project," the "Internal Security Conference Affairs Bureau" required all strong-arm organizations to share intelligence with the heads of county governments under Guangzhou Municipality's jurisdiction, so as to respond to the increasingly complex situation.

After participating in Senate-organized official activities, Liu Dalin left his son at the Guangzhou National Model School to wander around and gain some experience, while he himself, welcomed by servants from the Chen household, took a sedan to the eastern suburbs outside Guangzhou city. The eastern outskirts, being near the hills, had remained largely countryside in the Ming dynasty—open land with sparse, scattered residents.

Unlike the Qing dynasty when wealthy families clustered in the western suburbs, the eastern outskirts in the Ming had many villas belonging to great local gentry families, among them quite a few historically famous figures.

Here was an estate called Donggao Villa, a garden that Chen Zizhuang and his cousin Chen Zilü had developed on existing structures in the fourth year of Chongzhen. The surrounding area was Chen clan farmland. The name "Donggao Avenue" in the old timeline derived from this very place.

Donggao Villa's style was very close to the Jiangnan garden tradition of capturing nature in miniature. Before the gate was a path lined with verdant bamboo, the gate inscribed with two characters: "As Though Appointed." Chen Zizhuang had been waiting at the gate to welcome them. Liu Dalin, whose legs were inconvenient, was assisted by two servants into a wheelchair they had brought, and was pushed by Chen Zizhuang into the garden.

Upon entering, one saw halls with painted beams and carved rafters standing beside a lake called "Huanqing." Outside the hall, bamboo lined the path with artificial mountains standing like screens. The lake was called "Vegetable Leaf Lake," named for vegetables leaves that would drift down from Luofu Mountain—allegedly "the lake extends dozens of li across." In the lake stood Shuxiao Tower, surrounded by lotuses and willows, with three white stone peaks rising before it, several zhang tall. Along the lake, banyan embankments and bamboo groves meandered step by step, small channels threading under bridges, seeming to connect and yet break apart. From Yiqing Hall onward, the entire path was alive with rising and falling strange rocks. Features resembling sheep-resting knolls and caverns interspersed with flowers and trees. The flowers weren't mixed but planted by type, distinguished by five colors. Pavilions amid the groves were named for their flowers, their vessels, tables, and window lattices all shaped after those flowers. Climbing to the terrace, the Pearl River curved before, White Cloud Mountain embraced behind. The waters of Pujian and Wenxi streams flowed in curving intersections, all crossed by Jade Belt Bridge as they emerged. Dense pine forests stretched all the way to the paths of Red Hill Mountain. Sweet osmanthus clusters and winding vines never ended, leaving walkers often circling in confusion.

East of the garden stood Jinsu Pavilion, its gate lined with osmanthus flowers. Beside it was a small hill topped by a terrace called "Moon Bath." Descending its steps was a pool named "Crane Bath," with a flower islet in the pool—bamboo fence and thatched cottage surrounded on all sides by lotus. Chen Zizhuang had named it "Green Cloud Heap"—though at this season the lotus leaves had yet to sprout. Further east was a great expanse of rice paddies. South of the garden were Plum Island, Crane Path Pavilion, and a small hill for climbing to view the scenery, named "Yuan Lan." Standing on the hill, one could gaze at the vast waters in the distance, as well as the railway tracks extending from Guangzhou's Great World.

West of the garden was Huaixin Pavilion, taking its name from Tao Yuanming's poem "The good sprouts also embrace the new." Behind the pavilion was a goldfish pond with various colorful fish, called "Playing Scales." Before the pavilion, vegetable plots crisscrossed, refreshing to the spirit. Beside the plots was a lychee grove, with the Jade Belt River winding past. Under a great banyan by the river, one could sit quietly and fish. Beside the fishing rock were moored colorful four-leaf boats—drifting on them, enjoying the pleasures of mountain and water, gave one a sense of transcending the mundane world. Further west stood a tower rising beside the water, facing Shuxiao Tower in distant dialogue across the lake. Climbing the tower to gaze afar, Kaijing Hall lay to the south, Changchun Nunnery to the north. The entire Donggao Villa covered at least several hundred mu.

"Mengliang, do you remember when we placed on the golden roll together? You and I, freed from examination pressures, toured the majesty of the capital, dressed in grand ceremonial robes, unburdened by documents. Once we spread the banquet table andt played 'High Mountains and Flowing Water' together, toasting each other—how exhilarating that was! Who would have thought that our parting in the capital would already be eighteen years past? Time truly flies like an arrow." Chen Zizhuang pushed Liu Dalin's wheelchair, reminiscing about the beautiful times of their youth. The garden's scenery had become footnotes to time.

"Indeed, eighteen years." Liu Dalin sighed: "Jisheng, you're more haggard than I imagined. Truly, bureaucratic seas age people quickly."

"Ha ha ha, I have no fortune to enjoy Mengliang's life as an idle cloud and wild crane. If you hadn't fallen ill back then and been unable to take office, by now you'd probably be even more haggard than I am."

"I thought these sick old bones should have been buried long ago. Who would have known that through chance encounters, I'd actually become more spirited the longer I live. Fate plays with people, fate plays with people!" Liu Dalin couldn't help but sigh too.
