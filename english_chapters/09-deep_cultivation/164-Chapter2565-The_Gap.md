# Chapter 2565 - The Gap

After examination, Mother Zhang most likely didn't have tuberculosis—it should be a common infection from streptococcus, mycoplasma, or similar pathogens. This was a common illness in middle-aged and elderly people, just that it had been dragging on for quite a while and the condition was relatively serious. As long as adequate antibiotics were administered, she would quickly recover. But under ancient medical conditions, one moment of carelessness and she might have departed for the Western Paradise.

"Then admit her as an inpatient." Lin Motian signed the admission approval on the medical record. Because Mother Zhang was "self-paying," she was required to pay first before admission. Zhang Jiayu naturally couldn't produce this sum, so Lin Motian had to specially approve admission on credit.

"You'll need to settle this hospital bill. Otherwise, when Deng Bojun sees it, he'll start arguing with me again..."

"What? He's here too?"

"What do you mean 'here too'?" Lin Motian smiled wryly. "Ever since the plague ended, Section Chief Deng has been stationed long-term at the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, rolling out all kinds of medical services... damn! It's making gold by the bushel every day!"

Zhang Xiao gave a few dry laughs. Though Deng Bojun's essential purpose in running the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital was to rake in money for the health sector, it had to be said that the chemical enterprises also profited handsomely from it. The pharmaceutical factory was now one of the highest gross-margin enterprises among the state-owned enterprises under the Planning Commission. If not for the incomplete upstream industries requiring massive investment, with some raw material prices being high, they could have removed the "one of" qualifier.

Zhang Xiao's dinner party that evening was set in the upscale restaurant on the top floor of the Great World guesthouse—the chefs here had all been transferred from the Consulate Hotel and had received guidance from Liu Xiang, so the cuisine particularly suited Elders' tastes. Elders coming to Guangzhou made this a must-visit dining spot.

The dinner guests were Elders from Guangzhou's health sector. Besides Lin Motian, Fu Qiliang, and Deng Bojun from the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, there was the visiting Zheng Mingjiang.

Of course it was splendid to have someone else paying. After three rounds of drinks, the group critiqued the dishes for a while before naturally turning to work—three sentences without leaving their profession.

"Dr. Lin, I looked at some medical records and prescriptions this afternoon, and there's something I don't understand." Zheng Mingjiang set down her sparkling water. "Why are you all so stingy with medications? It feels like excessive economy. Our Senate may be poor, but not that poor. I see you're reluctant to use even sulfonamides and oxytetracycline, let alone penicillin and streptomycin. Even if it's to prevent drug resistance, there's no need to be this miserly."

Lin Motian heaved a long sigh: "Ah, you're in Lingao so you don't know how hard it is out here. The old saying goes 'with grain in the barn, there's no panic in the heart.' Now go look at our pharmacy—many drugs don't even have 24 hours of basic reserves. And we're constantly running out of stock every few days. How can I not use them sparingly?" He smiled wryly. "The moment I get back to my desk at the end of shift, I get a headache. Every day there are notes from Elders asking for such-and-such medicine... Yes, looking 45 degrees up at the sky won't help—I'm talking about exactly your type!" Lin Motian said to Zhang Xiao. "With these note requests, you people play the good guys while we play the villains. Outside, how many patients who've paid and queued are waiting for medication and getting delayed!"

Zhang Xiao could only plaster on a smile and pour him wine.

"So now I'm telling the doctors to use antibiotics cautiously, especially penicillin and streptomycin—these are out of stock every few days. I'm afraid we'll encounter a patient with a severe infection and have nothing to use. Right now even oxytetracycline isn't available."

---

Lin Motian poured himself a glass of wine and continued venting his frustrations: "Earlier Liu San saved a man named Yu Qing—he was a good prospect for medical training. He'd been on the front lines during the plague helping with epidemic prevention, and we'd planned to focus on cultivating him after the epidemic ended. Sigh..."

A faint sadness surfaced in his expression. "Unfortunately, he got infected on the front lines. Couldn't save him. You know, if I'd just had one box of streptomycin, I could have saved his life! Even tetracycline or oxytetracycline would have been fine, but I didn't have a single box! All I had on hand was sulfonamide!"

Zhang Xiao found this strange: "Before the plague, I was doing small-scale research trials on streptomycin. Previously, due to the Planning Commission's annual plan, we'd been pushing the penicillin project, but after the plague we urgently switched to tetracycline and streptomycin. Still, oxytetracycline was a variety that went into production long ago—surely there couldn't have been none at all?"

Lin Motian thought about it: "Could it have been used for the front-line troops? After all, war burns money and materials."

Fu Qiliang explained: "I was doing battlefield medical work at the front before. With the front lines under pressure, it was probably all allocated to the Bōbō Army."

"The Senate has always been short of all kinds of materials. Everything we do is stretched thin—we always have to scrape things together. And didn't you also say streptomycin capacity was just a fraction of a ton..." Lin Motian said.

"Hey now, my dear Director Lin, let me break down our inventory for you." When it came to pharmaceutical capacity, Zhang Xiao didn't just know the details—he knew them inside out. "After our pharmaceutical factory went into production, sulfadiazine annual capacity is 20 tons—I designed it! Add in various other sulfonamide varieties, 30 tons a year is no problem. Streptomycin is a bit less, but still five or six hundred kilograms a year. Tetracycline is essentially an upgraded oxytetracycline production line—by changing the additives in the fermentation process, you can also get chlortetracycline. Oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline are both human and veterinary drugs, so production is massive. Only the penicillin project gave way to streptomycin, but it was in production before I left—outputting a ton a year is no problem. The four major varieties used most after the People's Republic was founded—oxy, tetra, peni, strep—I've assembled them all for you. Though due to raw material and equipment issues production has been fluctuating, never able to run at full stable capacity, even at the worst we could maintain fifty percent capacity. It shouldn't have left you this strapped!"

Deng Bojun shot Zhang Xiao an admiring look, his mental abacus clicking away: "Sulfonamides can basically be used freely. Once the four major antibiotics scale up, this Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital will simply be a beacon of humanity. All that gleaming white silver..."

"Your capacity hasn't come up yet, and anyway these few hundred kilograms or a ton or two feels like it's not even enough to fill the gaps between teeth." Lin Motian and Fu Qiliang both thought this way.

"A fraction of a ton is actually a lot—you know, 100,000 units of penicillin is only 0.6 grams, and streptomycin is just 1 gram." Zheng Mingjiang reminded them.

Zhang Xiao said: "Let me tell you two—in 1943, the Americans had only about a ton of annual penicillin capacity, and that was enough for the entire Far East allied forces. Compared to the WWII Far Eastern allied forces in scale, the Bōbō Army is practically a shrimp. Don't carry over your old timeline habit of casually using millions or tens of millions of units of antibiotics per dose. During WWII, a hundred thousand units per injection was considered a lot. What we're commonly producing now is ten thousand units."

He went on to give them an accounting. The factory's drug output had two price tiers: one was the "internal transfer price," set by the Planning Commission, allocated to the hospitals, clinics, and other institutions under the health sector, mainly supplying publicly-funded medical care for naturalized citizen workers, military personnel, and their families. The other was the "commercial wholesale price," purchased by the state pharmaceutical company as sole distributor, then wholesaled out. Customers were mainly large private pharmacies like Runshi Hall and Chen Liji. Additionally, public medical institutions like the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital also purchased some drugs through this channel for self-paying outpatient services.

"Currently about a third of the factory's capacity goes through the internal transfer channel, and two-thirds through commercial wholesale. I don't know your hospital's specific purchase volume, but in absolute numbers it's definitely not small—because you're ranked second on the pharmaceutical company's customer sales list, and fifth on our factory's transfer channel sales ranking, after only Joint Logistics, Land Reclamation, Nanyang Company, and Lingao General Hospital."

"There's a problem here." Zheng Mingjiang summarized. Everyone's gaze immediately fell on Deng Bojun.

Deng Bojun saw everyone looking suspicious and quickly defended himself: "What are you looking at me for?! All drug movements are recorded. How much comes in through which channel, how much goes out—every step has receipts and records. One check will reveal everything."

"I also feel the problem probably isn't on our end. Drug receipts are reported to me daily, along with settlement documents. Though I don't look at every one, I do spot checks regularly. And I trust Old Deng—after all, this Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital was originally... Anyway, I think the problem is probably at other links."

With Lin Motian backing Deng Bojun, no one could probe further in that direction.

"Now that you mention it, I'm reminded of something." Fu Qiliang said: "A while back there was something on the market called 'Lushi Powder,' supposedly the ancestral secret formula of some mountain hermit. Claims to treat all kinds of redness, swelling, heat, and pain—forget sword wounds, even if another plague came, it would cure it right up. I originally thought it was just quack talk, but I heard the effects were actually quite good. It's rare for a traditional Chinese medicine preparation to effectively fight infection. I'd thought about getting a sample to test the ingredients, but got too busy and let it drop. Now that I think about it, this might not be so simple."

Zhang Xiao added: "Zhang Jiayu also bought two oxytetracycline tablets from some traveling doctor for the high price of one tael of silver."

Zheng Mingjiang pulled out her little notebook and jotted this down. "I'll look into it when I have time. Since I've come across it, there's no reason to leave empty-handed."

"Director Zheng, I support you! Investigate thoroughly! These bastards need a beating!" Zhang Xiao thought of his previously embezzled prize and was so angry his Sichuan dialect came out. "Do you all remember two years ago when the State Council organized that video editing competition among Elders? I originally didn't have time for it, but when every other department was participating enthusiastically, I figured someone from the medical sector should represent us, so I edited a short film for the health sector called *The Senate's Medical Enterprise*..."

"Mm-hmm, I know. It even won second prize. You're the pride of our health sector." Deng Bojun praised.

"What health sector pride—I really did get 'cleared out!'" Zhang Xiao was full of grievances.
