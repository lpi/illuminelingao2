# Chapter 2503: Burning the Tower (16)

Xu Tong estimated Sun Gang's punching power. The fist was not heavy; obviously, there was a big problem with the way force was generated. The movements also seemed a bit sluggish to Xu Tong. Lacking testing equipment, Xu Tong could not measure the weight of his own punch, but after sparring with him, Chen Sigen estimated it to be between 140 and 160 kilograms. Although this value was very inaccurate, it was already very good among middleweight amateur boxers. After a simple probe, a trace of contemptuous smile appeared at the corner of Xu Tong's mouth.

Seeing Xu Tong retreat, Sun Gang performed a "Rolling Pearl Turning Clouds." His left arm swung up, sweeping horizontally toward the root of Xu Tong's ear. Xu Tong quickly raised his right arm, elbow and jaw forming a straight line, protecting his right ear and jaw, blocking the punch. Immediately after, his left hand quickly unleashed consecutive jabs, striking Sun Gang's eyes and nose.

Under the pressure of continuous jabs, Sun Gang retreated a step slightly. His head unconsciously tilted back. This is a normal natural reaction for people; only through constant training can one overcome this instinct. Sun Gang reached out with both hands in an "Immortal Strokes Top," trying to stroke Xu Tong's left hand, but missed completely. Traditional martial arts emphasize defeating the enemy with one strike and lack awareness of retraction. Techniques like stroking, plucking, pushing, and leading are all built on the basis that the opponent also lacks this awareness. They are difficult to be effective against the instant-strike-instant-retract strikes of boxing. Coupled with insufficient confrontation experience and a lack of distance sense, situations where the eyes arrive but the hands do not often occur. In Xu Tong's daily training, the sparring partner would hold shield pads and constantly change distances, sometimes suddenly rushing forward, sometimes suddenly retreating, to train the boxer's judgment of striking range and safe distance.

Xu Tong quickly seized the opportunity. He took a deep breath through his nose, pushed off forcefully with his rear right foot, and violently twisted his waist, hips, and upper body to the front left. His center of gravity shifted to his front left leg, driving his right arm, shoulder, elbow, forearm, and fist peak into a straight line. His left hand recovered to protect his jaw, and a rear-hand heavy punch burst forth. The air was torn by the fist wind. A fierce light flashed in Xu Tong's eyes. It was time to show real technique.

Yun Ting watched everything before him coldly. If it weren't for the old grudge with the Kun people making them unacceptable, submitting to anyone wouldn't be a problem for him. As a convicted and dismissed Embroidered Uniform Guard officer, he urgently needed a way to rise again and return to the Town pacification. What he wanted was only power. In his heart, Wooden Stone Daoist, Xue Tu, and Young Master Liang were all just stepping stones for advancement. Now that Stone Old Man was willing to lend a hand and introduce him to powerful eunuchs, he had to seize this opportunity. If they wanted money, he would bequeath huge sums; if they wanted lives, he would make corpses fill the fields of Guangzhou Prefecture.

Yun Ting slowly looked at Xue Tu. He saw Wooden Stone Daoist walk to Xue Tu's side and whisper a few words. Xue Tu's face remained unmoved, but he cast his gaze toward Yun Ting. Their eyes met, and each understood the other. Yun Ting turned his head and saw the dark-skinned man in black clothes he had just arranged leading two men in green robes to the table of Pockmarked Chen and Sun Gang. After exchanging a few words with Sun Gang's head disciple, that disciple's eyes flashed. Not long after, he led the two green-robed men to squeeze slowly to the edge of the field. The dark-skinned man turned his head to look at Yun Ting and nodded almost imperceptibly. Yun Ting knew that everything was arranged properly, and his heart relaxed slightly. He continued to watch the fight in the field.

Ming Dynasty martial arts valued weaponry over pugilism. In fact, Ming Dynasty martial arts paid more attention to "practicality," which meant pursuing "lethality." Fighting techniques like boxing and palm methods obviously could not reflect this advantage in battle formations.

Qi Jiguang recorded in the "Fist Classic Shortcut Chapter" of *New Book of Effective Discipline*: "Boxing methods seem to have no preprocessing for the skills of great wars, but moving hands and feet and habituating the limbs to diligence, this is the art for beginners to enter the gate." Whether in the army, among mountain bandits, or in the *jianghu*, whether in private fights or battle formations, big sabers and long halberds were used. There were almost no times of facing the enemy bare-handed. The development of theory and techniques was far from comparable to modern bare-handed combat.

Traditional martial arts were not incapable of actual combat. The Wen Family Seventy-Two Rows of Fists practiced by Sun Gang was an effective combat boxing method. At this time, metaphysics like so-called internal energy and internal qi had not yet appeared. Although lacking scientific induction, martial arts still retained their original face. The development of martial arts cannot be separated from its environment and soil. The low overall living standards and productivity of medieval society determined the height that sports could reach. In actual combat, because ancient martial arts faced opponents trained by similar systems, when facing an ordinary person, a trained expert could end the fight directly with a random straight punch to a vital point or a grapple. When facing an opponent of similar level, because neither side could defeat the enemy with one move using so-called lethal unique skills, once tangled, it often turned into wrestling and sumo. Kyokushin Karate and Muay Thai's "War Dance" both went through difficult metamorphosis to complete the transformation from traditional martial arts to modern competitive sports. When facing a completely new concept of fighting skills, ancient martial arts would be at a loss due to a lack of coping experience and means.

In Xu Tong's view, it made no difference which school of boxing the opponent used. Although modern society has diverse fighting skills from various countries, in the end, they often coincidentally adopt the same techniques. Just as all ring and actual combat boxing since modern times have adopted boxing as the striking method, the fact that boxing methods reach the same goal by different routes shows that to generate force effectively, one cannot violate human physiological structure and laws of motion. This leads to the inevitable convergence of technical movements.

Xu Tong's right punch struck out. Sun Gang's left arm drew a semicircle outward with the elbow as the center, touching Xu Tong's attacking hand but failing to parry it aside. Xu Tong's fist smashed heavily onto Sun Gang's elbow joint. Sun Gang let out an "Ah," his left arm numb and sore. He retracted his hand, his feet involuntarily retreating two steps, quickly opening the distance from Xu Tong. Xu Tong did not stop. After gaining the initiative, he used a forward slide step followed by a left diagonal advance to rush quickly to the right side of Sun Gang's body. Sun Gang's right step retreated, quickly adjusting his stance to maintain facing the enemy head-on. At the same time, he turned his body sideways, sent his hips forward, twisted his crotch, supported with his right foot, and swept horizontally with his left foot. A "Withered Tree Coiling Roots" kicked out two legs in succession toward Xu Tong's ankle and knee. Traditional boxing generally considered high kicks impractical, with the saying "legs do not pass the knees." Xu Tong quickly lifted his right foot, dodging the low sweep kick. Immediately after, his right leg lifted again to hip joint height. His upper body sank slightly, elbow joint and knee forming a wall of bone, using the tibia to block the mid-level sweep kick. Borrowing the moment Sun Gang adjusted his balance, he ducked and sidestepped, cutting into the right side of Sun Gang's body. His center of gravity shifted to his left foot. Simultaneously turning to the left, he struck the left side of Sun Gang's head fiercely with a right hook.

Traditional martial arts, regardless of the school, had no concept of defense in their opening stance. They were either wide open and close, or one front one back, or one up one down. In the view of modern competitive sports, there was completely no awareness of protecting the head and ribs. When facing continuous combination strikes, it was almost an open door. Accompanied by a violent tactile sensation, Xu Tong's fist hit Sun Gang solidly on the face. Sun Gang's face flung fiercely to the right. A mouthful of blood foam sprayed out backward with a "pfft" following the swing of his head. After the first hit landed, Xu Tong pushed off with his left foot and turned to the right, a left uppercut striking Sun Gang's abdomen. Sun Gang's waist bent, and his hand unconsciously sank down, trying hard to block the incoming fist, but blocked nothing. Xu Tong had long since changed his stance, retracting his left fist, and smashed a right hook onto Sun Gang's left face again. Ruptured capillaries and accumulated blood made Sun Gang's face swell up immediately. Sun Gang staggered. The continuous blows made him dizzy. The swelling closing his left eye affected his vision. He retreated two steps in succession. Xu Tong did not press immediately but quickly adjusted his body position. His right foot stepped forward, left foot back. waiting for the distance between the two to open up to a leg's length, he performed a quick spinning side kick. This movement is difficult to execute in actual combat because at the moment of turning before the kick, the back is briefly exposed to the opponent, easily inviting a counterattack. When turning, if the opponent moves or blocks at the same time, it is also possible to misjudge the opponent's position and distance. generally, it can only be effective when facing a linear attack and waiting for the opponent to reveal a flaw. Xu Tong focused his attack consciousness on Sun Gang's chest. placing the pivot point of rotation on the ball of his right foot, his body rotated 180 degrees from right to left. At the moment of turning and kicking, he raised his head slightly, eyes slightly above the height of the kicking left leg, locking onto the target one last time for the hit. Xu Tong's waist drove his left leg to snap kick fiercely from bottom to top behind him. His head was slightly high, shoulders, hips, and legs in a straight line with Sun Gang. Accompanied by a loud *thump*, a heavy kick stomped on Sun Gang's chest. Sun Gang was like being hit hard by a car. His body flew backwards abruptly. Sun Gang's large fat body traced an arc, falling heavily onto the green slate covered with weeds. He rolled a few times and lay motionless.

The combat was like lightning and thunder; it ended in the rise and fall of a rabbit and falcon. A burst of noise erupted outside the field, sounding like a gasp of cold air. The two green-robed men slowly moved to the outside of the field, exchanged a glance, and were about to enter the ring. Suddenly, two strong men rushed into the field from beside a wine table and helped Sun Gang up. Sun Gang caught his breath at this time, propping himself up with one hand, coughed twice, waved his hand, and just said, "Don't..."

One of the men had already rushed up, shouting loudly, "Injuring my master, I will definitely not rest with you today. I'll fight you to the death!"

After speaking, he rushed close, not even announcing his name. A left punch attracted Xu Tong's gaze, followed immediately by his right hand probing with two fingers, going straight for Xu Tong's two eyes. Xu Tong bobbed and weaved, dodging the opponent's left punch. Then, without dodging, he threw a left straight punch. With a crack, the opponent's right two fingers collided squarely with Xu Tong's fist, breaking instantly. The man screamed "Ah," then his body shifted back, right leg snapping up, fiercely kicking at Xu Tong's groin. Xu Tong took a step back and swayed back; the opponent's kick missed. Xu Tong then sidestepped to the right, moving to the man's left side. He was somewhat annoyed in his heart. Fighting with Sun Gang, he had kept a sense of proportion, causing at most a mild concussion and blood stasis injuries, definitely no disabilities or life-threatening dangers. But this person came up with insidious eye-gouging and groin-kicking. This ignited a trace of anger in his heart. In fact, these so-called unique skills aiming straight for vital points counted for nothing in the eyes of athletes with long-term confrontation training.
