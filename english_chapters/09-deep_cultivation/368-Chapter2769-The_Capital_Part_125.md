# Chapter 2769: The Capital (Part 125)

However, the Emperor hesitated. Honestly speaking, this was outside his cognitive range.

The Great Ming's overseas trade itself was a complex topic. Like many things in the Great Ming, there was no specific agency to manage it, nor could one speak of unified management standards.

Chongzhen ascended the throne in his youth and did not receive a complete imperial education and training during his boyhood, so he knew very little about the systems of the Imperial Court. Although the suggestion Qian Taichong proposed seemed beautiful, for him, it was filled with uncertain risks. Although Qian Taichong used an old system name, "Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping," the strangeness of "Maritime Trade" still caused him to subconsciously feel fear.

Seeing the Emperor hesitating and indecisive, Qian Taichong knew that such a major event could not be decided by his words alone. It would inevitably have to go through a court deliberation. Fortunately, Mr. Le had told him that there were quite a few big shots in the court and the public who supported engaging in "Thief Affairs" (Kun Affairs).

Immediately he said again: "This humble official has written this matter into a summary, I beg the Emperor to look it over." With that, he took out a thick folded memorial from his bosom and presented it.

The attendant eunuch hurriedly took the memorial and placed it on the imperial desk. Qian Taichong said again: "If the Emperor grants your subject's request, your subject wishes to lead the Zheng clan and their subordinate officers, soldiers, ships, and assets to move to Shanghai, to serve the Imperial Court as the original Thirty-Six Hongs of Guangzhou did."

The Thirty-Six Hongs were the thirty-six brokerage merchants who acted as agents for foreign merchant trade in Guangzhou in the past. Serving as a maritime trade broker certainly yielded rich profits and could rival a country in wealth, but the broker merchants themselves also needed abundant capital and rich trade channels to be competent.

With the strength of the Zheng Sen group, serving as maritime trade brokers was not a difficult task. Once they obtained the Ministry of Revenue's brokerage license, they would become "Imperial Merchants" with the blessing of the Imperial Court's halo. Moreover, Zheng Sen himself was a genuine hereditary military officer. With both combined, wouldn't Shanghai become the Zheng family's world!

The Emperor nodded slightly. Indeed, considering the Zheng family's past history, this was indeed a way for them to fully utilize their strengths. Staying in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, they were almost useless. Shen Youlong reported in his memorial that the various factions of the original Zheng family in Zhangzhou Bay were incompatible with each other like fire and water, posing no restraint on the Kun thieves and instead vying to trade with them.

Since they were willing to move out, it wasn't a bad thing. Chongzhen thought, regardless of whether the establishment of the Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping in Shanghai could be accomplished in the end, as long as the Zheng Sen group arrived in Shanghai, they would be completely at the Imperial Court's disposal. It would be far from the situation in Fujian where the sky is high and the emperor is far away, listening to transfer orders but not announcements (obeying orders but not summons). Although the Zheng family was not what it used to be, at least they still had a large fleet and thousands of troops that the Imperial Court didn't have—and the Imperial Court didn't even have to pay them. Simply using them to guard Jiangnan would also be useful.

He immediately said: "Beloved minister's earnest heart is commendable. Regarding the memorial to establish a Maritime Trade Supervisorate in Shanghai, the Imperial Court will have its own disposition. If the Zheng clan is willing to move to Shanghai, the Imperial Court welcomes strictly. When the time comes, I will issue a decree to the locality, and there will naturally be proper arrangements."

"Thank you, Emperor." Qian Taichong couldn't suppress the excitement in his heart and hurriedly knelt down and kowtowed. Although the matter of establishing the Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping was not agreed to, allowing the Zheng family to move north to Shanghai showed that the Emperor attached great importance to the Zheng family.

Although Shanghai was only a county under Songjiang Prefecture, it was in the heartland of the Southern Zhili and very close to Nanjing. If there wasn't full trust, it would be impossible for the Emperor to let a semi-independent maritime merchant group like the Zheng family move to Shanghai.

For Qian Taichong, gaining the Emperor's trust was the key to achieving his career. Especially for the Zheng family, where "the Lord is young and the State is suspicious," without the Imperial Court's shelter and support, and without him having the talent of Zhuge Liang, wanting to revive the Zheng clan would be like a tree without roots!

Now, the Emperor had fully expressed his trust in the Zheng family—no, in him! Whether the Zheng family was loyal or traitorous, the Emperor might not be clear; it all depended on his words and deeds to reach a conclusion.

Thinking to this point, while shedding tears of gratitude, Qian Taichong couldn't help but feel afloat.

"...As for you, loyal to the state body, extremely commendable!" The Emperor said, "I intend to promote you. Your original post is Inspector of the Zhangzhou Maritime Defense Sub-prefecture Office. How about this: you are temporarily appointed as the Registrar (Zhishi) of the Maritime Defense Sub-prefecture Office. Specially assigned to Anping maritime defense matters."

"Thank the Emperor for his vast grace!" Although the Inspector of the Sub-prefecture Office was an "official," he was "unranked" without a grade. A Registrar was a proper official of the 9th rank. Moreover, "specially assigned to Anping maritime defense." Although he rarely went to the Zhangzhou Maritime Defense Office to serve in the past and was mostly active in Anping and other places, now with this title, his activities in Anping would be even more justified.

"You should not leave the Capital for the time being." The Emperor continued.

"Your humble subject understands." Qian Taichong felt a burst of wild joy: this meant there would be continued summons!

Judging from the two previous summons, the Emperor was quite satisfied with him. If the next summons went appropriately and the matter of the Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping could be handled smoothly, he would be "noted in the Emperor's heart," and his future would be immeasurable.

Although he was just a student of the National University by donation, now that national affairs were becoming urgent, the Imperial Court's employment of people was gradually becoming eclectic. Sun Yuanhua was merely a Provincial Graduate (Juren), and having been in official service for only a dozen years, he was now a proper Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou holding the rank of Vice Minister of War.

He asked himself if his talent was no worse than Sun Yuanhua's. It was nothing more than Sun Yuanhua having a good father-in-law and utilizing some connections with the Kun thieves to rise rapidly. Although he didn't have a good father-in-law, he had dealt with the Kun thieves much more than Sun Yuanhua. If the Imperial Court really started handling Kun Affairs, he would be a first-class talent. Maybe in less than ten years, he could also become a high regional official...

With such burning thoughts, Qian Taichong was sent back to the guild hall from the palace by the Imperial Guard. That night, "Mr. Le" drifted in again. Upon arrival, he repeatedly said "Congratulations."

Qian Taichong was surprised in his heart, thinking he didn't know what background this Mr. Le had. Whatever he discussed with the Emperor today, this person knew it all by evening.

Mr. Le first congratulated him on his "promotion," then praised his proposal to open Shanghai as a port. He also stated that he would definitely do his best for it, striving to get the Imperial Court to pass this matter.

"Speaking of which, this student is actually worried about this matter." Qian Taichong was not a three-year-old child, nor was he new to officialdom. He knew the maladies of the Imperial Court deeply. Whenever the Imperial Court had a major measure, it would often drag on for months, discussing without deciding. With the Emperor indecisive, many officials would oppose and obstruct it in every possible way for various purposes.

"Sir's worry is correct." Mr. Le nodded, "This matter is indeed not easy to handle. However, there are many people of insight in the court and the public. My master is secretly contacting them to form public opinion in the court; naturally, it will yield twice the result with half the effort."

"Who is your master..." Qian Taichong couldn't help but be very curious.

Mr. Le smiled slightly and didn't answer. Qian Taichong knew he had asked presumptuously.

"Let's not discuss this for now," Mr. Le said. "Do you know a thing or two about the situation in Shanghai?"

"I know a little."

Qian Taichong had acted as the "Prime Minister" of the Zheng Sen family these years, handling everything big and small. Naturally, he knew some things about the situation in Shanghai.

"I heard that the gentry in Shanghai jointly organized a large shipping firm called the Merchants Bureau (Zhaoshangju). It specializes in shipping routes in the Northern Ocean. Business is very booming."

"Do you know who the shareholders of this Merchants Bureau are?"

"No need to ask, naturally there are Kun thieves."

"Correct," Mr. Le clapped his hands, "Besides the Kun thieves?"

"I heard it's Shen Tingyang of Chongming. I know a little about this person. His family was originally the leader of the Sand Boat Gang in Shanghai, controlling hundreds of sand boats, specializing in North-South Ocean trade."

"More than him."

"Jiangnan gentry, probably many have shares; it's not surprising."

"Sir only knows one, but not the other." Mr. Le shook his head, "These four words 'Jiangnan Gentry' cannot be glossed over with the four words 'not surprising'."

These words aroused Qian Taichong's curiosity, and he asked: "Which other big shots?"

"To tell you the truth, the third largest share of the Merchants Bureau mostly belongs to the gentlemen of the Restoration Society (Fushe)."

"The Restoration Society?!" Now Qian Taichong was dumbfounded. Even though he had been active in the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou area all these years, he knew about the group called the Restoration Society. He knew the great names of people like Zhang Pu.

"How could they engage with the Kun thieves?" Qian Taichong couldn't help but panic. If the Kun thieves had the backing of the Restoration Society in Jiangnan, even if a Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping was established in Shanghai, there would probably be no business to do. Let alone the tax revenue of "two hundred thousand taels a year."

"This, what should be done then?"

"Don't panic." Mr. Le first calmed his mind, "Tianru (Zhang Pu) cooperating with the Kun thieves was originally just coping with them civilly. Now that the Kun thieves' wolfish ambition has been completely exposed, Tianru also wants to eliminate them. It's just that this matter of cross-sea business..." As he spoke, he looked at Qian Taichong with a half-smile.

"Yes! Yes! As long as the Imperial Court grants the opening of the port in Shanghai, this student will naturally do his best!" Qian Taichong understood his meaning and immediately agreed, "It's just that I don't know if the Imperial Court can approve this matter of opening the port."

"There is no need to worry too much about this matter." Mr. Le said, "There are many big shots in the court and the public who hold the view of 'Learning Kun skills to expel the Kun'. Moreover, Tianru also holds this view. With his help, it can be said to be twice the result with half the effort!"

"Yes, yes, relying entirely on your respected father's planning!" Qian Taichong hurriedly flattered.

Mr. Le said solemnly: "Sir praises too much! Anyone with insight in the world knows that our China's enemy is not the Roving Bandits, nor the Eastern Barbarians, but the Kun thieves! How can the gentlemen of the court and the public not know the critical point here? It's just that the Kun thieves have sturdy ships and sharp cannons, and the world is in a turbulent autumn, so we can only plan slowly."

"Yes, yes, this student admires!"

Mr. Le looked Qian Taichong over and said: "Sir is familiar with the Kun situation. In the future, you will surely be a capable official handling Kun Affairs. Your future is immeasurable!"

"This student is ashamed."

Mr. Le smiled again and whispered: "There is one more thing I want to discuss with you here. To do it or not depends on you..."

"I wonder what it is?"

"Tianru is planning for Yizhai (Zhou Yanru) to return to the premiership. This matter is quite thorny. If Sir helps Tianru at this critical juncture, presumably Tianru will appreciate it, and roughly Yizhai will also thank the Zheng family."

"I don't know where the thorniness lies..." Qian Taichong didn't understand for a moment, but before his voice fell, he suddenly realized and cursed himself for being "stupid." He quickly said, "This is a small matter, it's just that this student and Tianru have never met..."

"This is my visiting card; take it and go to Suzhou." Mr. Le took out a visiting card from his sleeve, "He generally knows about your affairs. As long as you present this card, he will naturally see you."
