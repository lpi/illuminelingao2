# Chapter 2769: The Capital (Part 125)

Yet the Emperor hesitated. In truth, this matter lay beyond the boundaries of his understanding.

The Great Ming's overseas trade was a complicated subject in itself. Like so many things in the empire, no dedicated agency existed to manage it, nor could one speak of unified standards governing its conduct.

Chongzhen had ascended the throne in his youth without receiving the complete imperial education and training that should have prepared him during his boyhood. Consequently, he knew precious little about the systems of the Imperial Court. Though Qian Taichong's proposal seemed attractive on its surface, to the Emperor it bristled with uncertain risks. The term "Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping" was borrowed from old precedent, yet the novelty of "Maritime Trade" still stirred an instinctive wariness within him.

Seeing the Emperor waver in indecision, Qian Taichong understood that such a momentous matter could not be resolved by his words alone. It would inevitably require court deliberation. Fortunately, Mr. Le had assured him that considerable support for engaging in "Kun Affairs" existed among the powerful figures both within the court and beyond.

He spoke again without delay: "This humble official has compiled this matter into a detailed summary. I beg the Emperor to review it." As he spoke, he produced a thick folded memorial from his bosom and presented it respectfully.

The attendant eunuch hurried forward to receive the document and placed it upon the imperial desk. Qian Taichong continued: "Should the Emperor grant your subject's request, I wish to lead the Zheng clan—together with their subordinate officers, soldiers, ships, and assets—to relocate to Shanghai. There we would serve the Imperial Court in the manner of the original Thirty-Six Hongs of Guangzhou."

The Thirty-Six Hongs had been the consortium of brokerage merchants who served as intermediaries for foreign trade in Guangzhou in years past. Serving as maritime trade brokers certainly yielded rich profits—wealth enough to rival a nation—yet the broker merchants themselves required abundant capital and extensive trade connections to perform such duties capably.

Given the resources at Zheng Sen's disposal, serving as maritime trade brokers would present no great difficulty. Once they obtained a brokerage license from the Ministry of Revenue, they would become "Imperial Merchants" blessed with the court's official sanction. Moreover, Zheng Sen himself was a genuine hereditary military officer. With both advantages combined, would Shanghai not become the Zheng family's domain?

The Emperor nodded slightly. Considering the Zheng family's history, this arrangement would indeed allow them to exercise their particular strengths. Remaining in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou rendered them nearly useless. Shen Youlong had reported in his memorial that the various factions of the former Zheng family scattered around Zhangzhou Bay were at each other's throats, completely incapable of restraining the Kun. Indeed, they competed among themselves to trade with the enemy.

Since the Zheng were willing to relocate, Chongzhen reasoned, it could only benefit the court. Regardless of whether the Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping in Shanghai ultimately came to fruition, once Zheng Sen's group arrived in Shanghai, they would fall entirely under the Imperial Court's control. Gone would be the situation in distant Fujian, where the sky stretched high and the emperor remained far away, where men obeyed transfer orders but ignored summons. Though the Zheng family was but a shadow of its former self, they still possessed a sizeable fleet and thousands of troops that the Imperial Court lacked—forces the court need not even pay to maintain. Using them simply to guard Jiangnan would prove worthwhile.

He spoke at once: "Beloved minister, your earnest heart is commendable. Regarding the memorial to establish a Maritime Trade Supervisorate in Shanghai, the Imperial Court will make its own determination in due course. Should the Zheng clan wish to relocate to Shanghai, the Imperial Court welcomes this arrangement wholeheartedly. When the time comes, I shall issue a decree to the local authorities, and proper provisions will naturally be made."

"Thank you, Emperor." Unable to contain his excitement, Qian Taichong quickly knelt and pressed his forehead to the floor. Though the establishment of the Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping had not been approved, permission for the Zheng family to move north to Shanghai demonstrated that the Emperor placed considerable importance upon them.

Shanghai was merely a county under Songjiang Prefecture, yet it lay in the heartland of Southern Zhili, quite close to Nanjing. Without complete trust, the Emperor would never permit a semi-independent maritime merchant group like the Zheng family to establish themselves in such a strategic location.

For Qian Taichong, earning the Emperor's trust was the key to advancing his career. This was especially true for the Zheng family, where "the lord is young and the state suspicious." Without the Imperial Court's shelter and support, and lacking talents comparable to Zhuge Liang's, any hope of reviving the Zheng clan would be like nurturing a tree without roots.

Now the Emperor had fully demonstrated his trust in the Zheng family—no, in him personally! Whether the Zheng family proved loyal or treacherous, the Emperor could not yet know; that judgment would rest entirely upon Qian Taichong's words and deeds.

As this realization crystallized in his mind, tears of gratitude streamed down his face even as his spirit soared with elation.

"...As for you personally, your loyalty to the state is most commendable!" the Emperor declared. "I intend to promote you. Your current position is Inspector of the Zhangzhou Maritime Defense Sub-prefecture Office. Henceforth, you are temporarily appointed as Registrar of the Maritime Defense Sub-prefecture Office, with special assignment to Anping maritime defense matters."

"I thank the Emperor for his boundless grace!" Though the Inspector of a Sub-prefecture Office was technically an "official," he was "unranked," without formal grade. A Registrar, however, held a proper position of the ninth rank. Furthermore, the "special assignment to Anping maritime defense" legitimized his activities there. Though he had rarely attended the Zhangzhou Maritime Defense Office in the past, spending most of his time active in Anping and its surroundings, this new title would grant official justification to his presence.

"You should remain in the Capital for the time being," the Emperor continued.

"Your humble subject understands." Wild joy surged through Qian Taichong's chest. This meant there would be further summons to come!

Judging from the two previous audiences, the Emperor seemed quite satisfied with him. If subsequent summons proceeded favorably and the matter of the Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping could be handled smoothly, he would be "noted in the Emperor's heart." His future prospects would become boundless.

Though he was merely a student of the National University by donation, the urgency of national affairs meant the Imperial Court had grown increasingly flexible in its employment of talent. Sun Yuanhua was only a Provincial Graduate, and after barely a dozen years in service, he had risen to become Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou, holding the rank of Vice Minister of War.

Qian Taichong believed his own abilities no less than Sun Yuanhua's. The man had simply enjoyed the advantage of a well-connected father-in-law and had leveraged certain dealings with the Kun to climb rapidly through the ranks. Though Qian Taichong lacked such advantageous family connections, his experience with the Kun far exceeded Sun Yuanhua's. If the Imperial Court truly began formal engagement with Kun Affairs, he would rank among the most capable candidates. Perhaps in less than ten years, he too might become a high regional official...

Burning with such ambitions, Qian Taichong was escorted back to his guild hall lodgings from the palace by members of the Imperial Guard. That very evening, "Mr. Le" drifted in once more. Upon arrival, he repeated congratulations several times over.

Surprise flickered through Qian Taichong's mind. He could not fathom what background this Mr. Le possessed. Whatever had transpired in his audience with the Emperor that day, this man somehow knew it all by nightfall.

Mr. Le first congratulated him on his "promotion," then praised his proposal to open Shanghai as a port. He further pledged to exert his utmost efforts on the matter, striving to guide it through Imperial Court approval.

"To speak truthfully, this student harbors concerns about this very matter," Qian Taichong replied. He was no naive child, nor was he new to the ways of officialdom. He understood the maladies of the Imperial Court all too well. Whenever a major policy arose, deliberations often dragged on for months, endlessly debating without reaching decisions. With the Emperor already inclined toward hesitation, numerous officials would oppose and obstruct such measures in every conceivable way, each pursuing their own purposes.

"Your concern is well-founded," Mr. Le agreed with a nod. "This matter will indeed prove difficult to advance. However, many men of insight exist both within the court and among the public. My master is quietly contacting them to shape opinion at court. With such groundwork laid, success should come with far less effort."

"Your master..." Qian Taichong could not suppress his curiosity. "Who might that be?"

Mr. Le offered only an enigmatic smile and made no reply. Qian Taichong recognized he had overstepped.

"Let us set that aside for now," Mr. Le said. "Tell me—do you know something of the situation in Shanghai?"

"I know a little."

Having served as the de facto "Prime Minister" of Zheng Sen's household these past years, managing everything from great matters to small, Qian Taichong had naturally acquired some knowledge of Shanghai's circumstances.

"I have heard that the local gentry in Shanghai jointly organized a large shipping firm called the Merchants Bureau. It specializes in routes through the Northern Ocean, and business has been exceedingly prosperous."

"Do you know who the shareholders of this Merchants Bureau are?"

"There is no need to ask—the Kun must certainly be among them."

"Correct." Mr. Le clapped his hands together. "And besides the Kun?"

"I have heard Shen Tingyang of Chongming is involved. I know something of this man. His family originally led the Sand Boat Gang in Shanghai, controlling hundreds of sand boats and specializing in the North-South Ocean trade."

"There are more than just him."

"Jiangnan gentry—many probably hold shares. That would hardly be surprising."

"You perceive only the surface, not the depths." Mr. Le shook his head. "These words 'Jiangnan gentry' cannot be dismissed so casually as 'hardly surprising.'"

This remark piqued Qian Taichong's interest. "Which other prominent figures are involved?"

"To speak plainly, the third largest share in the Merchants Bureau belongs largely to the gentlemen of the Restoration Society."

"The Restoration Society?!" Qian Taichong was stunned. Though he had spent recent years active in the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou region, he certainly knew of that organization called the Restoration Society. The name of Zhang Pu in particular was famous throughout the realm.

"How could they possibly engage with the Kun?" Alarm rose within Qian Taichong. If the Kun enjoyed the backing of the Restoration Society in Jiangnan, then even should a Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping be established in Shanghai, there would likely be no trade to conduct. The promised tax revenue of "two hundred thousand taels annually" would remain a fantasy.

"What... what is to be done then?"

"Do not panic." Mr. Le first calmed his agitation. "Tianru's cooperation with the Kun was originally nothing more than a pragmatic arrangement, maintaining civil relations out of necessity. Now that the Kun's wolfish ambitions have been fully exposed, Tianru himself wishes to see them eliminated. It is merely that this matter of cross-sea commerce..." He trailed off, regarding Qian Taichong with a knowing half-smile.

"Yes! Absolutely!" Understanding dawned, and Qian Taichong agreed at once. "Should the Imperial Court grant permission to open Shanghai as a port, this student will naturally devote his full efforts! It is only that I do not know whether the court will actually approve this matter."

"You need not worry overmuch about that," Mr. Le assured him. "Many powerful figures in both court and society share the view of 'learning the Kun's skills to expel the Kun.' Moreover, Tianru himself holds this position. With his assistance, success will come far more easily."

"Yes, yes—I rely entirely upon your esteemed father's guidance!" Qian Taichong hastened to flatter.

Mr. Le's expression grew solemn. "Sir, you praise too generously. Any man of insight in the realm understands that China's true enemy is neither the Roving Bandits nor the Eastern Barbarians, but the Kun themselves! How could the gentlemen of court and country fail to recognize this critical truth? Yet the Kun possess sturdy ships and devastating cannons, and these are turbulent times. We can only proceed with careful, patient planning."

"Yes, yes—this student is filled with admiration."

Mr. Le studied Qian Taichong appraisingly. "Sir, you are thoroughly familiar with matters concerning the Kun. In the future, you will surely prove a capable official in handling Kun Affairs. Your prospects are truly limitless."

"This student is unworthy of such praise."

Mr. Le smiled once more and lowered his voice to a whisper: "There is one additional matter I wish to discuss with you. Whether you choose to act upon it is entirely your decision..."

"What matter might that be?"

"Tianru is working to restore Yizhai to the premiership. This endeavor has encountered certain difficulties. Should you assist Tianru at this crucial juncture, he would surely appreciate it—and Yizhai himself would doubtless feel gratitude toward the Zheng family."

"I do not quite understand where the difficulty lies..." Qian Taichong began, but before he finished speaking, sudden comprehension struck him. He cursed himself silently for his slowness. "This is a small matter. It is only that this student has never met Tianru..."

"Here is my visiting card—take it with you to Suzhou." Mr. Le drew a card from his sleeve and extended it. "He is generally aware of your affairs. Present this card, and he will certainly receive you."
