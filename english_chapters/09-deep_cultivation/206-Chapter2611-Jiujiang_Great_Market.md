# Chapter 2611: Jiujiang Great Market

Huang Xiyin didn't expect Zhang Xiao, an outsider, to be so clear about the local water conservancy facilities in Jiujiang. Bringing this up was presumably to praise the achievements of the Song people, so he flattered, "After this enclosure was built, the tidal fields of Xiqiao had no bad years, and Guangzhou also became the largest rice market in China, with large amounts of surplus grain supporting Fujian and Zhejiang, known as 'Guang Rice.' It is truly an act with merit in the contemporary era and benefits for a thousand autumns."

Zhang Xiao didn't feel awkward about Huang Xiyin's flattery. The Sangyuan Enclosure was indeed the crystallization of the wisdom of ancient working people, protecting the fourteen *bao* of Nanhai and Shunde, with thousands of *qing* of fertile fields and a large population. It was one of the most important embankments and an important source of taxation within the jurisdiction of Guangzhou Prefecture.

Zhang Xiao continued, "There is a section of the dike in the Sangyuan Enclosure. Although it is only a few hundred meters long, it is crucial to the Sangyuan Enclosure."

"Chief, I wonder which section it is?" Zhang Jiayu's interest was piqued, and he asked.

"The Heng Dike of Jizan Village, which should have been built in the Yuan Dynasty." Zhang Xiao said, "This dike is located at the foot of Xiqiao Mountain. If the Dalu Gorge Dike breaks, river water will rush into the plain behind the mountain from here. After the Jizan Heng Dike was completed, the accumulated water in the swamp inside the Sangyuan Enclosure could be pumped out by waterwheels to develop arable land and residential areas. Villages moved from the foothill terraces to the lowland plains. The dikes were equipped with sluice gates to control the entry and exit of tidal water, and single-cropping rice became double-cropping rice. However, in the Ming Dynasty, the riverbed outside the water outlet of Daoliu Harbor accumilated high silt. Whenever floods surged, not only could the accumulated water inside the enclosure not be discharged, but the floodwater of the West River would flow backwards and pour in, flooding houses and rice fields, with the damage becoming increasingly severe day by day. In the 29th year of Hongwu of the Ming Dynasty, Chen Bowen of Jiujiang, together with the Guan, Cen, and other large clans, dammed Daoliu Harbor, sinking boats loaded with stones into the river to block the flow, plugging this water outlet of Daoliu Harbor. Apart from this place, the dikes of dozens of *li* in the jurisdictions of Nanhai, Xinhui, Sanshui, and Shunde counties were linked to form an enclosure, blocking the backflow of tidal water."

Zhao Hening, who had been looking around on the Dafa boat before, was also attracted by the discussion of Zhang Xiao and the others and asked, "Chief, since the impact of the Sangyuan Enclosure is so huge and it blocked the key tidal water, why do I see ponds everywhere here but few rice fields?"

Zhang Xiao smiled and said, "Little girl, things are a unity of opposites. Wherever there is a benefit, there must be a disadvantage; it is nothing more than choosing the lesser of two evils. After the Sangyuan Enclosure was closed, although it blocked the backflow of tidal water, it also made the interior of the Sangyuan Enclosure face the situation of flood prevention. In order to prevent waterlogging, the villagers in Jiujiang, Longshan, Longjiang, and other places dug fields that were low-lying and easily flooded into ponds. Ponds have the functions of both storing water and raising fish. Digging deep ponds to store water, the dug-out mud was piled up around the pond. The fields by the pond are called 'Ji' (base/dike), which is also a variant of the 'Ji' of the embankment."

Zhao Hening looked at Zhang Xiao with a gaze of admiration and said, "I didn't expect the 'Dike-Pond' (Ji-Tang) to come from this."

"Yes, Dike-Ponds first developed from the lowest-lying places like Jiujiang, Longjiang, and Longshan. This was a major change in the farming system of the Sangyuan Enclosure in the early Ming Dynasty."

Seeing the scenes along the way, Li Yao'er also felt that indeed everything requires "favorable timing, geographical position, and human harmony." There were naturally tens of thousands of *mu* of fish ponds here; why did they insist on digging new ones in Xiangshan before? Blame it on the rampant bandits in the countryside before; they never found a chance to inspect everywhere and went directly to Xiangshan where there was a textile handicraft industry.

Along the journey, Zhang Xiao's group still saw quite a few rice fields distributed in higher-lying areas, but the grain produced within the Sangyuan Enclosure had already been insufficient for self-sufficiency as early as the Wanli era. The closer to the low-lying areas of Jiujiang and the two Longs (Longjiang/Longshan), the more patches of dike-ponds distributed like a chessboard appeared. On the pond dikes, shrub-like plants were planted, cut off neatly from the roots by people, just sprouting new branches and tender buds. There were also quite a few pond dikes planted with fruit trees like longan, lychee, and citrus.

"Chief, everyone says Jiujiang is the birthplace of mulberry dike fish ponds, but why don't we see mulberry trees?" Zhao Hening was born in Jiangnan, and the mulberry trees she saw were mainly Jing Mulberry and Lu Mulberry. Driving along the Jiujiang Creek, she never saw the mulberry trees she was familiar with, so she couldn't help asking Li Yao'er. Jing Mulberry and Lu Mulberry were general terms for a type of mulberry tree, belonging to deciduous arbor trees. Jing Mulberry had many mulberries, small leaves with serrated edges; Lu Mulberry had few mulberries, stout branches, and large, thick leaves.

Li Yao'er wasn't surprised either. After Zhao Hening returned to Lingao from Hangzhou, she lived a normal person's life. Following the Initial Class to school, the agricultural knowledge she was exposed to was slightly less than the children trained by the Agricultural Committee. She pointed to the new branches on the pond dikes and said, "Isn't that it? The mulberry tree variety here is very different from that in the north. It is called Guangdong Mulberry, a shrub plant."

"Oh, so it's like that." Zhao Hening scratched her head somewhat embarrassedly, a blush floating across her exquisite face.

Zhang Xiao couldn't help laughing. "Yo, how come Hening also 'doesn't exercise the four limbs and can't distinguish the five grains' now?"

"Teacher Zhang, you laugh at me too! I'm better at raising silkworms than you! Hmph!" Zhao Hening pretended to be angry, crossing her arms over her chest.

Zhang Jiayu had been following Zhang Xiao for some time. He had contacted quite a few "Chiefs" and found that Australians indeed didn't have such strict hierarchical concepts towards subordinates, but he was still surprised by Zhao Hening's behavior. Zhao Hening was said to be Chief Zhao's "adopted daughter." In the eyes of Ming people, so-called adopted sons and daughters were just a means to evade the court's ban on ordinary families keeping slaves. Yet Zhao Hening looked every bit like an unruly princess, having not a shred of self-awareness as a servant. While thinking, Zhang Jiayu unconsciously stared at her.

Zhao Hening naturally didn't know. She only felt a pair of eyes behind her seemed to be staring to watch her joke. Turning her head to teach a lesson, her eyes met Zhang Jiayu's. Being targeted by such a handsome young man, Zhao Hening's heart suddenly accelerated, and her face turned bright red. To cover up her embarrassment, she could only say coquettishly, "Hmph, you all bully me! I'm ignoring you all!" After saying that, she ran to the stern of the boat to watch the water spray kicked up by the propeller.

In this moment of eye contact, Zhang Jiayu was stirred by those clear eyes. Only then did he realize his gaffe. He wanted to go up and apologize, but felt that men and women should not touch. His two legs seemed rooted like a big tree, unable to move a step. He froze in place in a dilemma, saying in his heart: "Look not at what is contrary to propriety; look not at what is contrary to propriety. Zhang Jiayu, you are truly a beast!"

Zhang Xiao and Li Yao'er looked at each other and smiled, shaking heads or shrugging shoulders.

"What place is that?" Zhang Xiao suddenly pointed to a direction in the distance that seemed to be planted with large patches of Guangdong Mulberry and asked Huang Xiyin.

"Answering the Chief, over there is Datong. There is a market nearby called Datong Market, which is already within the territory of Jiujiang Fort." Huang Xiyin answered.

Just like this, unknowingly, the fleet slowly approached Jiujiang Great Market. Along the way, they didn't encounter anyone blind enough to dare plot against these two steamships emitting black smoke. The bayonets of the National Army Battōtai on the ship reminded passing merchants and boat households that a group of Australians was coming.

"This place is so lively!" It was Zhang Xiao's first time seeing such a prosperous rural scene. Compared to Lingao at the beginning of D-Day, this rural scene was no less than the difference between clouds and mud.

According to historical records, from the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty to the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, there were two cities and fifteen markets in the Sangyuan Enclosure area. Almost every *bao* had a market, distributed flatly. The commodities traded in the markets were rich, mainly rice farming products. Jiujiang Township, benefiting from the monopoly trade of fish fry and the developed silk weaving industry, formed a high-density distribution of markets different from other areas.

Due to the needs of agricultural production, several intermediate markets within the enclosure were mostly located at the junction of water networks, becoming transit stations for communication between the entire Sangyuan Enclosure and the outside world. However, there was not much complementarity between intermediate markets; they were relatively independent, mainly covering their surrounding grassroots markets, only needing to satisfy the market demand of a larger area.

Before the Jiajing era, common people were forbidden to set up family temples to worship ancestors; only official families could establish family temples to worship ancestors by imperial bestowal. After Jiajing, the Emperor allowed common people to set up shrines to worship ancestors. Since then, family temples and ancestral halls stood in great numbers in the Pearl River Delta region. As the saying went: "Shunde ancestral halls, Nanhai temples (family temples)." And the construction of markets was led by clans, thus forming the characteristic of distribution with shrines and temples as the center and shops surrounding the ancestral hall. The boundaries of markets in the Sangyuan Enclosure in the late Ming were closed, with gates set up at entrances and exits. Many entrances and exits led to neighboring villages or river creeks.

In the first year of Zhengde of the Ming Dynasty, Jiujiang villagers utilized the advantage of water transport to successively build Tianfei Temple Front Market and Kaibian Market along Shima Creek and Li Hai (Jiujiang Creek). In the late Ming and early Qing, a situation where Li Hai, Liangcun, and Yuewan three markets stood like a tripod was formed. A total of more than a hundred market pavilions used for commercial activities were built. Gentry of successive generations like Huang Zhong, Junior Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices; Chen Wanyan, Censor; Huang Yingxiu, Prefect; Zhu Rang, Guan Jiyi, etc., all participated in the construction of the markets. By the middle of the Qing Dynasty, the three markets were collectively called Jiujiang Great Market. In the Republic of China, it was set up as a separate city along with Foshan, Jiangmen, and eight other areas, having the name of "Little Guangzhou," showing its prosperity.

The development of Jiujiang Great Market was relatively similar to Foshan; both gradually flourished due to the development of local handicraft industries, not towns established by the government. The straight street of Jiujiang Great Market was built along both banks of Jiujiang Creek. Shops facing the water were built on both sides of the creek. The shops on both sides of the straight street formed "palms joined together," and the other streets and alleys were distributed in a "Fei" (非) character shape along the river creek. Rice shops, money houses, silk and satin fabrics were all available. Because the streets were narrow, only more than two meters wide, every market day on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th, it was truly a sea of people, jammed with water unable to leak through. From morning to night on market days, heads moved, a scene of liveliness.

After taking office, Zhang Xiao studied Ming Dynasty and Senate policies on rural trade. Since ancient times, imperial power did not go down to the countryside. The Ming court was basically in a laissez-faire state towards such rural markets, neither encouraging trade nor interfering in it. If the scale of trade was not large, officials would basically not be set up to collect taxes. These small-scale rural trades would not be directly affected by the court's commercial tax policies. However, below the county level was not completely ungoverned. Since the Yuan Dynasty, Patrol Divisions (*Xunjian Si*) were set up under county-level yamen. Patrol Divisions were set up at all key towns, markets, and passes, under the jurisdiction of the county magistrate. The Inspector (*Xunjian*) was generally rank 9a. The Patrol Division was not purely a civilian post. Although its purpose was mainly for public security, emphasizing military functions, over time, a distinction between civil and military inspectors gradually emerged, having the functions of a county dispatched agency.
