# Chapter 2567 - Examination Classmates

Several varieties of the powder, though identical in appearance, revealed their true nature under the microscope—mere mineral dust. These were complete counterfeits, containing not a trace of antibiotic.

From the varying formulations, she deduced that these batches of Lushi Powder likely originated from different drug merchants, though their antibiotic raw materials probably shared a common supply channel. After all, only the Senate could manufacture such substances. Yet neither Jingshan nor the guards had been able to trace the source of these so-called miracle drugs.

"The criminal gang in Guangzhou is more cautious than I'd hoped." A bad feeling settled in Zheng Mingjiang's gut.

By rights, her investigation could end here. She could compile her findings into a report and hand everything over to Mu Min. A drug leakage case of this magnitude would certainly command the National Police's full attention.

But Zheng Mingjiang wasn't ready to let go. As the saying went, different trades were separated by mountains. Though the National Police technically included sanitary officers, they primarily handled epidemic prevention and hygiene inspections—pharmaceuticals lay outside their expertise. Turning the case over to them risked missing crucial leads.

Yet investigating personally carried its own dangers. As a female Elder, she stood out far too much. Even dressed in hanfu, her identity would be exposed the moment she spoke.

After much deliberation, she decided to first visit Foshan. The minor Elders interning there had made it a priority governance zone with comprehensive safeguards in place.

"Get some rest," she told her companions. "Pack your things. We might as well enjoy ourselves a bit while we're at it."

"Where are we going?"

"Foshan first," Zheng Mingjiang said.

Before departing, she called on Liu Xiang bearing an official document with Shi Niaoren's signature and the Health Ministry seal. She expressed the Ministry's concern for health and sanitation affairs in Guangdong, particularly hospital operations, and their desire to provide further guidance on medical matters. To that end, they intended to inspect medical records, prescriptions, pharmacy ledgers, and related accounts throughout the region—especially in Guangzhou Special Municipality. She hoped the Mayor would lend his support.

"Grand Prefect, I've just returned from the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital. Our young doctors desperately need guidance from the Senate. Otherwise, when our generation grows old, who will treat us? If that hospital represents Guangdong's finest, imagine how much more the regional clinics need the Senate's attention."

With Liu Xiang's backing secured, Zheng Mingjiang visited Elder Hong Huangnan at Joint Logistics, emphasizing the Health Ministry's unwavering duty to ensure proper treatment and care for the Bobo Army and National Army at field hospitals. She obtained his support as well.

"When I set out, I truly only meant to teach the children how to write medical records," she sighed. She hadn't anticipated using official documents this way, and wasn't entirely certain it was proper.

Before leaving, she gave final instructions to the secretary remaining behind. "Little Guo, you've arrived at an opportune moment. Stay on top of collecting prescription ledgers from the various locations. If you don't push them, they'll delay endlessly until the matter dies. When the documents arrive, organize and register everything properly. The rest can wait until I return from Foshan."

"Yes, Chief." Little Guo held up a telegraph notepad. "A telegram just arrived from Lingao. The medicines you requested have shipped, and a pharmaceutical company representative is accompanying them. You said this was urgent, so I came immediately."

"Good." Zheng Mingjiang felt her characteristic indecisiveness flare up. Should she proceed as planned—pretending nothing was amiss, letting the naturalized citizens receive and transfer the goods normally, watching the drugs vanish into the void before attempting to trace them back to their source? Or should she risk alerting her quarry? After three seconds of hesitation, she decided not to overthink it. Trust the instincts.

"If he arrives before I return, meet him at the dock. Instruct him to follow procedures strictly and wait for me to hand off the goods personally."

"Regional Deputy Commander, intelligence from Police Section Nine." The Political Security Bureau investigator placed a document on Yang Cao's desk.

Yang Cao had been studying the portraits pinned to the wooden blackboard and the dense web of colored cotton threads connecting them. Only at the staffer's voice did she stir from her contemplation. She picked up the file, flipped through it quickly, and said, "Salmon went to the Academy. And the bighead carp from Dragon Mountain has surfaced for air—that confirms another sleeper. They also caught a minnow. Good work. With Elder Li's organized materials, these stupid fish are far simpler than the old loach."

After reading, she pinned another small paper slip onto the network, marking a new target, and connected it to existing portraits with red thread.

For internal convenience and to reduce information leakage, Political Security had assigned codenames to their targets. Chen Zizhuang was "Salmon," Chen Bangyan "Bighead Carp," Kuang Lu "Minnow," and Liang Cunhou the slippery "Old Loach."

"Salmon has arranged to meet Old Turtle and Liu Dalin at Donggao Villa," the investigator reported. "Should we conduct surveillance?"

"Liu Dalin is Chief Councillor of the Senate's Consultative Assembly. Political vetting grade 2C—reliable." Yang Cao flicked ash into the tray. "With manpower stretched thin, no need to watch these fish this time. Tell the undercover line to stay careful."

"Understood."

She took a final drag and crushed the cigarette in the glass ashtray, then added several paragraphs of explanation to a pre-drafted document. Handing it to the investigator, she said, "Deliver this personally to Elder Zhang Xiao in Nanhai County."

To avoid repeating the "Parasol Project" debacle, the Internal Security Conference Affairs Bureau now required all enforcement organizations to share intelligence with county government heads under Guangzhou Municipality's jurisdiction—a necessary response to an increasingly complex situation.

After attending the Senate-organized official activities, Liu Dalin left his son at Guangzhou National Model School to wander and gain experience, then accepted Chen household servants' invitation to travel by sedan to the eastern suburbs. This area near the hills had remained largely countryside during the Ming dynasty—open land with scattered residents.

Unlike the Qing dynasty, when wealthy families favored the western suburbs, the Ming-era eastern outskirts hosted many villas belonging to prominent local gentry, including several historically famous figures.

Among these estates stood Donggao Villa, a garden that Chen Zizhuang and his cousin Chen Zilu had developed on existing foundations in the fourth year of Chongzhen. The surrounding lands belonged to the Chen clan. In the old timeline, Donggao Avenue had taken its name from this very place.

The villa's style closely followed the Jiangnan tradition of capturing nature in miniature. Verdant bamboo lined the path to the gate, which bore the inscription "As Though Appointed." Chen Zizhuang waited there to welcome them. Liu Dalin, whose legs troubled him, was helped by two servants into the wheelchair they had brought, and Chen Zizhuang himself pushed him through the garden.

Inside, halls of painted beams and carved rafters rose beside Huanqing Lake. Bamboo bordered the paths while artificial mountains stood like folding screens. The waters bore the name "Vegetable Leaf Lake," so called for the vegetable leaves that supposedly drifted down from Luofu Mountain—legend claimed the lake stretched dozens of li across. Shuxiao Tower rose from its center, ringed by lotus and willow, with three white stone peaks standing several zhang tall before it. Banyan embankments and bamboo groves wound along the shore, small channels threading beneath bridges in patterns that seemed to connect and break apart. Beyond Yiqing Hall, strange rocks rose and fell along the entire path, interspersed with sheep-resting knolls and caverns among flowers and trees. The flowers were planted by variety, distinguished by five colors. Pavilions scattered through the groves took their names from surrounding blooms, their vessels, tables, and window lattices shaped to match. From the terrace, the Pearl River curved before and White Cloud Mountain embraced behind. The waters of Pujian and Wenxi streams flowed in winding intersections, all crossed by Jade Belt Bridge. Dense pine forests stretched toward Red Hill Mountain. Sweet osmanthus and trailing vines wound endlessly, leaving visitors circling in pleasant confusion.

To the east stood Jinsu Pavilion, its gate framed by osmanthus. A small hill rose beside it, crowned by a terrace called "Moon Bath." Stone steps descended to "Crane Bath" pool, where a flower islet sat surrounded by lotus, its bamboo fence and thatched cottage enclosed on all sides—Chen Zizhuang had named it "Green Cloud Heap," though the lotus leaves had yet to sprout this season. Beyond lay a great expanse of rice paddies. To the south were Plum Island, Crane Path Pavilion, and a small hill called "Yuan Lan" for viewing the scenery. From its summit, one could gaze at distant waters and the railway tracks extending from Guangzhou's Great World.

West of the garden was Huaixin Pavilion, named for Tao Yuanming's poem: "The good sprouts also embrace the new." Behind it, a goldfish pond called "Playing Scales" held fish of many colors. Before the pavilion, vegetable plots crisscrossed in patterns refreshing to the spirit. A lychee grove grew beside the plots, with the Jade Belt River winding past. Under a great banyan by the water, one could sit and fish in quiet contemplation. Colorful four-leaf boats moored beside the fishing rock—drifting upon them through mountain and water gave visitors a sense of transcending the mundane world. A tower rose further west beside the water, facing Shuxiao Tower in distant dialogue across the lake. From its height, one could see Kaijing Hall to the south and Changchun Nunnery to the north. The entire estate covered at least several hundred mu.

"Mengliang, do you remember when we placed on the golden roll together?" Chen Zizhuang pushed the wheelchair, his voice warm with reminiscence. "You and I, freed from examination pressures, toured the capital's majesty in grand ceremonial robes, unburdened by documents. We spread the banquet table and played 'High Mountains and Flowing Water' together, toasting one another—how exhilarating that was! Who would have thought our parting in the capital would already be eighteen years past? Time truly flies like an arrow."

The garden's scenery had become footnotes to their shared history.

"Eighteen years indeed." Liu Dalin sighed. "Jisheng, you look more haggard than I imagined. The bureaucratic seas age a man quickly."

"Ha! I lack the fortune to enjoy your life as an idle cloud and wild crane, Mengliang. If illness hadn't prevented you from taking office back then, you'd probably be more haggard than I am by now."

"I thought these sick old bones should have been buried long ago." Liu Dalin shook his head in wonder. "Who would have known that through chance encounters, I'd actually grow more spirited with each passing year? Fate toys with us. Fate truly toys with us."
