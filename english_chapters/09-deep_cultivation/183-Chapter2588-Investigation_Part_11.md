# Chapter 2588 - Investigation (Part 11)

Guo Huiwen was at a loss for words. Yes, weren't these all systems Elder Zheng had created? Moreover, the pharmaceutical factory had long operated under the supervision of several Elders, with very thorough management measures. Saying leakage from the factory was impossible would be wrong, but the difficulty would be enormous.

"No matter how rigorous a system, there are always gaps." Guo Huiwen said. "In your view, if someone wanted to obtain drugs, which channel would be most convenient?"

"Well..." Wang Liang thought this question was asked with ill intent. Though it was just idle chat, the person across from him was a secretary close to an Elder. Whichever distributor or channel he named, word getting out would offend someone.

So he said very carefully: "If you're asking about channels, any channel is possible. It's really hard to say which channel would be easier to obtain things from. After all, we don't know their methods, right?"

Guo Huiwen was startled, thinking—you're my former classmate from Fangcaodi, and I never expected you to be so slippery!

Knowing the other party was now on guard and would offer nothing new if pressed further, Guo Huiwen thought the factory was probably the least likely source anyway. He'd wait until the medicines were picked up, then see the specific distribution.

Two days later, Guo Huiwen, Wang Liang, and a representative from Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital's pharmacy went together to the freight depot to receive the shipment. Guo Huiwen's current role was as Zheng Mingjiang's representative. Since this batch of medicines had been requested in her name as "special use" and wasn't part of the factory's shipping plan, Guo Huiwen held her authorized pickup slip.

After the three parties verified everything was correct, Guo Huiwen presented the pickup slip and took the goods. Then he and Wang Liang signed the handover documents. As for the medicines themselves, they were handed to Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital's pharmacy for storage.

Guo Huiwen and Wang Liang followed the pharmacy staff to the pharmacy. Just as they were about to open and count the inventory for storage, Guo Huiwen stopped the pharmacy staff. He said to Wang Liang: "Let's verify now!"

This was part of the plan. Though this batch of special-use medicines hadn't been specifically marked, every box and bottle had its serial number recorded.

The medicines were packed in specialized standard packaging boxes. They checked the seals, confirmed they were intact, then opened them. They randomly spot-checked several bottles/boxes against the manifest, confirmed everything was correct, then nodded to indicate they could proceed with storage.

The pharmacy staff then counted, registered, and stored the medicines, finally reporting: quantity, type, and specifications all matched the shipping manifest exactly.

Clearly, no drugs had leaked during transport. So the leakage must be happening at the end-user level.

That scope was enormous. After much deliberation, Guo Huiwen decided to report the current situation to Zheng Mingjiang for now.

In Sanshui, Zheng Mingjiang read Guo Huiwen's report, her heart full of sorrow.

She'd raised this matter; the Senate had given its support. Yet day after day passed, and the timeline on either side of her carefully prepared PowerPoint remained smooth—nothing to write. She could only console herself that the investigation was progressing steadily.

Neither the investigation team dispatched to Huizhou nor Guo Huiwen receiving goods in Guangzhou had provided her any useful materials.

The only progress, if any, was that the bait medicines had successfully entered Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital's pharmacy, disproving her first hypothesis: theft or substitution during the sea voyage. Next was to see whether someone could somehow extract medicines from the pharmacy.

One thing she could basically confirm: the fake medicine dealers probably weren't obtaining drugs through the self-pay medical channel. Though anyone who could afford the consultation and medication fees, had a symptomatic condition, and had a doctor's prescription could openly buy antibiotic medications from any hospital or private pharmacy—these drugs were extremely expensive, leaving too little profit margin for fake medicine dealers. Unless they transported them far to Jiangnan, the capital, or elsewhere, this approach wouldn't make much money. And such long-distance traded medicines particularly emphasized being "original and authentic"—the packaging and everything had to be completely intact. This was a completely different approach from the current disguised products.

To obtain excess profits, the key was getting "publicly-funded channel" medicines. Under the current dual-track system, publicly-funded medicine prices were only one-tenth to one-fiftieth of "commercial channel" prices. This profit differential was already large enough to kill for.

People will do business that risks beheading; no one does business at a loss. The commercial channel didn't need watching. The crux of the matter was the "publicly-funded channel."

What she could do now: one option was to closely monitor the newly arrived antibiotics—Wu Mu had already planted several people in the hospital, constantly watching the pharmacy's drug flows. The moment serial-numbered drugs moved, corresponding tracking would begin immediately.

The other was to place more hope in the Huizhou side. Lu Cheng was an experienced political security worker. But she hadn't made any progress since arriving in Huizhou.

Though the Senate was omnipotent, that statement had a premise: the new world the Senate had built possessed powerful forces that all other powers in this timeline lacked. Relying on this generational gap, an ordinary naturalized citizen cadre appeared omnipotent in natives' eyes. Operating independently outside the Senate, the complex Ming society would immediately educate you with reality about what "a scholar is useless in a hundred ways" meant.

Zheng Mingjiang now felt she wasn't much better off than going solo. Huizhou wasn't the Senate's deeply-cultivated sphere of influence. Many methods, tools, informants, and systems that political security, police, and even tax personnel relied on for investigations didn't exist here. As for the adversaries, they knew nothing. The deep gulf between the Senate and the Ming dynasty increased the investigation's difficulty. Like the famous joke from the old timeline—America trained a Black spy to go to Russia, but he was exposed the moment he got off the plane. Beyond this situation of the enemy being in the dark while they were exposed, the Senate was probably also leaky. The mastermind behind the scenes might not fully grasp the Senate's movements, but certainly had various ways of gathering intelligence. If even large quantities of antibiotics could be trafficked, what of mere words?

Oh well. After this was over, she'd just honestly go back to being an academic authority. Zheng Mingjiang secretly grumbled, then opened an urgent telegram from Zheng Xiaoyu.

Opening the telegram, her originally worried frown transformed into delight. Why? Someone at Zheng Xiaoyu's location had actually "delivered themselves to the door."

Zheng Xiaoyu currently oversaw all pharmaceutical, health, and epidemic prevention work throughout Huizhou Prefecture, including health clinics in each county. Naturally, he also controlled drug distribution channels.

His telegram said a local pharmacy owner had contacted him under the pretense of wanting to "open a new-style clinic." Opening a "new-style clinic" involved issues of physician qualification certification and controlled drug prescription rights. And the threshold for both was very high. According to Health Ministry regulations, a physician needed at least one year of general practitioner training at the Lingao or Guangzhou medical vocational school to obtain a practice license and prescription rights. These prescription rights were also quite limited—many controlled drugs couldn't be prescribed, and the clinic itself couldn't stock drugs. Patients had to take prescriptions to pharmacies with controlled drug sales permits.

In Huizhou, only one pharmacy had a controlled drug sales permit: the Runshi Tang Huizhou branch located in Huizhou prefectural city.

So this owner's purpose, besides discussing opening a "new-style clinic," implicitly wanted to obtain a controlled drug sales permit. And he'd hinted to Zheng Xiaoyu that he could give him and relevant personnel "dry shares." To show sincerity, he'd already gifted him fifty yuan.

"Fifty yuan—such generosity!" Zheng Mingjiang thought—this owner had really invested heavily!

Zheng Xiaoyu's idea was to use this person to create an image of himself as "greedy for money." That way, even if this owner had no connection to the fake drug syndicate, the syndicate would likely see him as someone who "could be bought" and actively approach him. This would achieve the goal of infiltrating the enemy.

This was indeed a good opportunity, Zheng Mingjiang thought. Once word of Zheng Xiaoyu "falling into corruption" spread, drug merchants and dealers were all connected—very likely it would attract fake drug syndicate members.

What she needed to do was stir up a wave of "pharmaceutical ledger audits" in Guangzhou—the bigger the fanfare the better. That way, their supply channels would become more cautious and reduce activity. The fake drug syndicate would then urgently seek new supply channels...

Zheng Mingjiang annotated at the end of the telegram: "Approved. Be careful."

After the investigation team moved to Boluo, they immediately launched operations at the medicine market, deploying multiple surveillance points. They conducted round-the-clock monitoring of all pharmacies, stalls, and individuals claiming to sell Australian miracle drugs, trying to find the upstream suppliers.

The original great hope—Wanchun Quan, the source of Lushi Powder—yielded disappointing results after secret investigation. This Wanchun Quan had been selling Lushi Powder for decades—it was the shop's "ancestral secret recipe." That is, this Lushi Powder wasn't some suddenly-appearing fake medicine but a traditional Chinese patent medicine that had existed for many years. Investigation team members bought Lushi Powder in batches for analysis, proving this medicine was ordinary Chinese patent medicine containing no compound ingredients whatsoever.

Lu Cheng convened a meeting to analyze the situation. Everyone concluded that the counterfeiters were likely stealing Lushi Powder's name. Their method was probably buying large quantities of the original medicine from Wanchun Quan, mixing it with sulfonamide and other antibiotic powders, then selling it—creating a cover.

Lu Cheng decided: strengthen surveillance of Wanchun Quan, especially tracking where large Lushi Powder transactions went. Since the counterfeiters needed to mass-produce fake medicines, their purchase quantities couldn't be small. Following large Lushi Powder shipments would lead to the counterfeiting workshop's location.

"Wonder if Old Yuan has arrived yet."

Yuan Shuzhi had departed several days before the investigation team. By rights, he should have reached Boluo by now. Though Lu Cheng somewhat disdained this wily old investigator, his undercover investigation might actually uncover something useful.
