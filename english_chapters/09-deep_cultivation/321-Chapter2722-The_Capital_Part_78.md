# Chapter 2722: The Capital (Part 78)

Min Zhanlian saw his mind wavering and knew he already had the will to survive. He deliberately said, "I imagine you're just following orders, scheming for a few coins. Why be so loyal? You think your schemes are so clever? I bet your master already knows."

This was actually Min Zhanlian's bluff. Zhou Ruolan had said earlier, "I'm afraid the upper and lower levels aren't of one mind." Combined with the visitor killed yesterday... all this suggested that Liu Sha was not only disloyal but had his own schemes.

He hadn't expected that as soon as he said this, Liu Sha's cheek twitched. Min Zhanlian was now more certain. He leaned in and said in a low voice:

"You killed the visitor. That was the worst possible move! Even if your master can't turn on you right away, once things settle down, he'll certainly investigate. What will you say then? I know you must have ways to destroy the body and erase traces, but once trust is gone, I'm afraid it will never be regained..."

Though Liu Sha strove to keep his expression unchanged, Min Zhanlian, the old *Jianghu* hand, had already seen the panic in his eyes. He was right! He thought. Liu Sha's killing was exactly what the instructors called a "stress response"—no careful thought behind it. This stress was likely caused by panic after his scheme was exposed.

One hundred thousand taels of silver—indeed enough to make someone risk their life!

"You're really the Short-Hairs' people?" After a long while, Liu Sha finally spoke.

Min Zhanlian reached into his clothes and pulled out a gleaming blue revolver.

"A Seven-Star Chain Pistol—you must know what this is."

Liu Sha was silent, speaking weakly: "Very well. All my scheming was for naught!" He slumped down as if all strength had left him. After a long while, he opened his eyes and said, "I'll tell you the truth. I really don't know Manager Leng's whereabouts—I wasn't the one hiding the hostage."

"What were you in charge of?"

"Ransoming," Liu Sha said weakly.

"The one hundred thousand taels was your idea, wasn't it?"

"Yes. What my master wanted wasn't money," Liu Sha said with difficulty.

"What was it?!"

"Negotiations!" Liu Sha shook his head.

Min Zhanlian drew a sharp breath. This was getting more and more complicated. Liu Sha's plan was fantastical. According to him, the condition his master proposed for releasing the hostage wasn't a ransom, but a meeting with the Short-Hairs' top leaders.

"Who is your master?"

"Since it's come to this, it doesn't matter if I tell you: Minister of War, Lord Wang Yehao."

Min Zhanlian knew a bit about the officials of the capital, but he had no impression of this Lord Wang. Ever since he had stepped down from his positions as Governor-General of Liangguang and Governor of Guangdong, he was no longer a key target of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

"Do you still have the original letter sent to Delong?"

"I've destroyed it."

"Can you remember the contents?"

"Roughly. The letter said kidnapping Manager Leng was a last resort. At a critical moment of life and death, they had no choice but to take this drastic measure. They simply requested that one or several of the Short-Hair Senate's top leaders meet at a safe location to negotiate."

"That's all?"

"There were also some polite words—basically saying war would harm both sides, and peace talks would benefit everyone."

No wonder the masterminds could hold their nerve! Min Zhanlian thought. For something this major, even if the Senate had wireless telegraph and could send messages a thousand *li* in an instant, negotiating peace with the court would still require days of meetings and discussion in the Senate to reach a conclusion. Liu Sha was exploiting exactly this gap.

According to the plan, after kidnapping Leng Ningyun, Liu Sha was to arrange for Leng's personal token and a letter to be delivered to Delong Bank. At this point, Liu Sha had made his move—swapping out the original letter and replacing it with a ransom demand for one hundred thousand taels.

Then he sat in Tongzhou, secretly controlling his subordinates to monitor Delong and Heliansheng.

He chose Tongzhou for three reasons: first, he had traveled here before as a fortune-teller and had a minor reputation, making him half a local; second, it wasn't far from the capital and allowed remote control; third, the capital was surely being turned upside down by Heliansheng, so it was better to lie low and avoid having flaws discovered.

No wonder Delong had hung out the cloth strip agreeing to the terms but got no response. Min Zhanlian thought: Indeed, everyone had their own agenda.

"Since Delong agreed to pay the silver, why not hand over the person?"

"Because the person isn't with me," Liu Sha said with a bitter smile. "Someone else is guarding him. Damn it!"

So the separation of ransoming and guarding was beyond Liu Sha's expectations.

"How did you come up with this idea? Besides, even Delong might not have one hundred thousand taels in reserve at the bank."

"It was Little Eunuch Yang's idea."

He learned from Little Eunuch Yang that Delong had just taken in nearly one hundred thousand taels from over a dozen palace eunuchs. The money was definitely there. So he conceived the idea to intercept it.

"So Little Eunuch Yang also gets a share."

Liu Sha nodded weakly. "Exactly."

With the silver stored in Delong, it was as safe as a mountain. Not to mention that one hundred thousand taels of silver weighed six or seven thousand *jin*—transporting it would require dozens of carts. Just brandishing weapons in the city would be suicide.

So the silver had to leave the city. Only in the suburbs could they make their move.

"In that case, why was Heliansheng's silver cart intercepted on the way?"

"That was to test whether Qiwei was actually transporting silver to the estate."

"What if the bandits had actually succeeded in robbing it?"

"Those bandits were no match for Heliansheng," Liu Sha said. "I know Heliansheng's strength all too well."

"What about Liu Xiaobian and the eunuchs from Nanyuan among the bandits?"

"They were sent to monitor the bandit gang. Never expected they'd lose their lives!"

"In all these days since the letter was delivered, didn't your master get suspicious?" he asked slowly.

"Suspicious, of course. Otherwise, why would he have sent someone here?" Liu Sha said with a bitter smile. "Fortunately, except for hiding the hostage, I handled everything from start to finish. The informants outside are all my people, so I could keep him fooled."

He didn't hide it. The man killed was named Wang Liang, sent by his master to inquire about the ransom.

"...I tried to fool him, but somehow he'd gotten wind of something. He made a scene here, threatened to expose me, and refused even silver. I had no choice but to send him on his way." A look of unwillingness showed in his eyes. "Give me three more days, and it would have worked! What a pity..."

"That's strange. Even outside the city, could you muster forces to attack? Even if you could, after taking the estate, with such treasure tempting everyone, could you control the scene?"

"Of course we couldn't attack by force," Liu Sha said with a bitter smile. "We'd take it by wit."

"By wit?" Min Zhanlian could barely contain his laughter. "How would you do that?"

"I don't know the details. Little Eunuch Yang would arrange it."

Min Zhanlian laughed. "You're a *Jianghu* person too. I don't know where the estate with the silver is, but knowing Heliansheng's ways, it's probably built like an iron bucket. Even with several hundred bandits attacking, it might not be taken. You believed a eunuch who grew up in the palace when he casually said 'take it by wit'?"

"What choice did I have?" Liu Sha said helplessly.

Min Zhanlian stared at his face. It was indeed full of helplessness, but he still felt Liu Sha wasn't telling the whole truth.

He thought: No matter. As long as the man was in their hands, they needn't worry about him not telling the truth. He asked again:

"After it was done, how much of the silver would Little Eunuch Yang get?"

"He didn't want a single coin," Liu Sha said. "Just one condition."

"Was it to use you to eliminate Eunuch Yang?"

Liu Sha nodded.

"Since you've confessed everything, I'll give you a way to live," Min Zhanlian said. "If you have any other important information, telling it would greatly benefit your future."

"What benefit could there be?" Liu Sha looked utterly disheartened. "I've worked for Lord Wang for over ten years, through wind and rain, not to mention licking blood off knife edges—countless times. From start to finish, I was just a pawn to summon and dismiss at will!" He heaved a long sigh.

Min Zhanlian understood how such people thought. After loyally serving their masters for years, they gradually felt their contributions didn't match their rewards, and their minds turned crooked, hoping to make a big score and jump ship. But often, heaven didn't comply. After all, compared to their masters, their resources were far smaller, and they had too many vulnerabilities. Often after much planning, their schemes mostly came to nothing, and they even gave their masters a legitimate reason to dispose of them.

Especially since he'd gotten emotionally involved with a woman. He'd heard the Chiefs joke: When middle-aged men and women fall in love, it's like an old house catching fire—it won't stop until it burns to the ground. Taking a woman from a musician household had obviously stretched Liu Sha thin.

At this moment, for Liu Sha, whether the Australians or Wang Yehao were friend or foe didn't matter. He was simply full of resentment.

Since he was resentful, there was an opening. Min Zhanlian had him taken to a side room for detention. They could slowly work on him later. Even though he didn't know Lord Wang's background, his desire for peace talks was significant intelligence.

"Bring the woman," he ordered. "Everyone else, clean the house and bury the body. Get ready!"

Since this was Liu Sha's headquarters for commanding the kidnapping, there might be other contacts arriving.

But the most critical thing was transcribing the entire interrogation record neatly. He particularly emphasized the report about Yang Tianliang's plan to "take it by wit"—whether true or not, Heliansheng needed to be prepared.

Shortly after, the woman was brought into the room. Her blindfold was removed. Seeing Min Zhanlian, she "thudded" to her knees, kowtowing repeatedly and begging for mercy. She kept insisting she was just a musician's woman and knew nothing about Liu Sha's affairs.

"Don't be afraid," Min Zhanlian said gently. "Stand up and speak."

Zhou Ruolan helped her up and offered a few comforting words. When Min Zhanlian saw her expression had calmed somewhat, he asked, "What is your name?"

"This slave is called Ruijie."

"How many years has Liu Sha kept you?"

"Only... only one year," Ruijie said timidly. "But he's been coming to my family to drink for three or four years."
