# Chapter 2663: The Capital (Part 19)

Liao Sanniang's left foot landed before Liu Wu's. She shifted her steps laterally to adjust her position, driving Liu Wu's body to move his center of gravity forward. At the same time, she withdrew her hands, changing from throwing to grappling. Her left hand grasped Liu Wu's right wrist so he couldn't break free, then her body turned back to the left. She used her right arm to push and press the big man's left elbow joint, and kicked the big man's knee hollow with her right leg.

Liu Wu hugged his body tight, bent his arm and retracted his elbow, breaking free from control before the grapple was formed. Liao Sanniang quickly changed her stance, retreating half a step to create a little space between their lower bodies.

Liu Wu's right foot had also landed at this time, but Liao Sanniang had preemptively destroyed his position, forcing him to defend constantly. This caused his center of gravity to be high, and the vertical line of his center of gravity was close to the limit of the support surface of his two feet, nearly on the edge of instability. Because he couldn't completely adjust his body posture, Liu Wu's right leg was unnaturally splayed outward.

Liao Sanniang's grasp of timing was extremely precise. In that hair's breadth of a moment, she lifted her right leg and stomped viciously with her heel on the proximal end of Liu Wu's hip.

The human hip is extremely solid, but the posterior inferior wall of the hip has no ligament fixation and is a weak point.

At this time, Liu Wu's right leg was abducted nearly forty degrees, already in an unnatural state. The greater trochanter of the leg bone formed a lever fulcrum with the hip. Under Liao Sanniang's violent stomp, the femoral head slipped forward and downward, dislocating the joint and the leg bone.

Liao Sanniang grasped Liu Wu's thumb with both hands and twisted, borrowing the force of the stomp to push forward. Liu Wu screamed miserably and was kicked flying.

As soon as Liu Wu hit the ground, Liao Sanniang caught up with a step and kicked with her toe. The steel-tipped toe of her shoe poked Liu Wu's forehead. Liu Wu only had time to let out one cry before fainting.

Liao Sanniang was like an eagle fighting a rabbit, changing three moves of throwing, grappling, and striking in an instant. All offense and defense transitions were just micro-adjustments of body posture. In the eyes of bystanders, the two had just grabbed each other when Liu Wu was kicked down by Liao Sanniang, and victory was decided in a split second.

Song Da felt a great chill in his heart. This Liu Wu was a famous local wrestling expert; usually, five or seven people couldn't get close to him, yet he was put down by this woman in one encounter.

Liao Sanniang leapt towards Song Da. Song Da couldn't avoid it, which instead stimulated the ferocity in the bottom of his heart as a big *guanggun* [bare-stick/rascal].

Song Da roared, met her directly, and swung his fist violently with all his might.

The fitting thin silk shirt accentuated Liao Sanniang's curvaceous and graceful figure.

Liao Sanniang took a deep long breath. In people's line of sight, Liao Sanniang's back figure suddenly expanded a circle. Her inverted triangular body shape unfolded like a fan. The mountain range composed of trapezius, spine of scapula, acromion, deltoid, rhomboid major, and latissimus dorsi undulated continuously, the lines appearing clearly through the shirt.

Pushing off the ground, turning the body, twisting the hips and sending the shoulder, extending the arm and swinging the fist—no tricks, no moves, hard against hard, tough against tough. A woman who could use heavy double sabers could only be a natural-born strongman.

The knuckles of the two fists collided, making a muffled *peng* sound. The two punching arms connected into a straight line. The cracking sound of breaking hand bones came from the ear, making the listeners' hair stand on end. Song Da's outstretched right hand slowly went limp. He knelt down bit by bit, holding his right hand and groaning in pain. The groans became louder and louder. Song Da's body collapsed into a pile of mud. Holding his wrist broken in two, he cried and rolled on the ground, sad as a child without a mother.

The body under Liao Sanniang's silk shirt slowly tightened and returned to a soft and lovely body.

She pulled a handkerchief from her bosom, wiped the bloodstains on her knuckles, walked over and picked up her own cloak. The cloak had a large hole poked by the sharp knife. Liao Sanniang stroked the cloak, sighed, and said faintly to Li Rufeng, "Chief Escort, I bought this at the Lingao Department Store with half a month's salary. Look, what should be done?"

Li Rufeng wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, gave two dry coughs, and said, "Reimburse, full reimbursement!"

Song Da lay on the ground clutching his right wrist, his body trembling violently from fear.

Li Rufeng walked slowly to Song Da. His burly body gave a huge sense of pressure. From Song Da's perspective, he looked like a giant supporting the sky.

Li Rufeng took out a bank note of twenty taels from his bosom, shook his hand, and tossed it out. The bank note floated lightly onto Song Da's face. Li Rufeng's deep voice sounded: "Brother, take these twenty taels back to recuperate your body. A small punishment to warn against big mistakes; grow some memory. Since ancient times, only one stick of first incense is burned. This time it was a hand broken; next time what is sent..."

Li Rufeng's voice sank, "Will be a life."

After speaking, he waved his hand, signaling Song Da to leave.

Song Da climbed up, clutched the bank note tightly in his uninjured left hand, knocked his head hard twice on the ground, and hissed, " Many thanks to the Bureau Chief for sparing me today. You receive thunder on the high mountain, I drink the west wind on the flat ground. We lowly people dare not touch the tiger's might again in the future. If we don't meet on small roads, we'll meet on big roads. This lowly one engraves the Bureau Chief's grace in my five viscera. May the Chief Escort cross mountains and seas smoothly in the future, a flat river ahead."

After speaking, Song Da struggled to stand up.

Liao Sanniang walked over from the side and supported Song Da's shoulder with her hand. Seeing her, Song Da's face couldn't help changing, and his whole body shuddered.

Liao Sanniang smiled gently and said softly, "Brother, don't panic. This slave knows the measure of my hand. The three of you have broken skin and dislocated joints, but they are just superficial wounds. You will be fine in a few days. Only do not delay; you must treat them quickly. The escort agency can beat people, but can save people even better. For various falls and injuries, heavy or light, we have good prescriptions and medicine. The senior brothers in the agency all possess secret methods of bone-setting. If you are willing to let us treat you, no aftereffects will be left."

Song Da understood the implied meaning immediately. He kowtowed and said, "Sanniangzi is a Bodhisattva reincarnated. When we lowly people go back, the outside world will immediately know that Grandpa Bureau Chief and Sanniangzi have clear ears and eyes and cannot tolerate sand. Even if there are still those fools blinded by lard with greed, they wouldn't dare to come to the door to trick the Master again. We will definitely ensure peace and quiet for your ears."

Liao Sanniang nodded and said, "This slave has weak Qi and blood and cannot stand much noise bothering my heart. We didn't know each other until we fought. I accept Brother's good intentions here."

Liao Sanniang shouted to the outside, "Bazi, take the three brothers down to set their bones." After speaking, she gently patted Song Da's shoulder.

Little Bazi agreed, called up a few fellows, and carried the three down.

Liao Sanniang walked to Little Bazi and whispered, "Set their bones and send them back. Check where they are staying."

Little Bazi nodded and went down quickly.

Seeing the people carried out, Li Rufeng sighed, shook his head, and said, "There are many such deceptive people. If a wealthy family encounters such a kidnapping, sometimes multiple families come to propose ransoms at the same time after the incident occurred. One doesn't know which is true and which is false, adding chaos in vain. But usually, they don't fight like this; they just drive those idlers away."

Liao Sanniang said indifferently, "That Song Da acted like a fool and wanted to start first. Besides, having a fight isn't a bad thing. It lets the outside know we are not those muddled chaotic worms. We shouldn't let people look down on us."

Wu Kaidi said to Li Rufeng from the side at this time, "I'm afraid the Chief Escort cannot leave here. In that case, I will go back to Delong to handle the situation first. You and I will gather later."

Li Rufeng nodded and said, "Alright. Sorry to trouble Mister Wu so much."

Wu Kaidi said, "It was originally my duty, as it should be." After speaking, he cupped his hands and walked out quickly.

After Wu Kaidi left, Liao Sanniang asked Li Rufeng, "Did you manage to ask anything from Wang Shizhen and Steward Zhang?"

Li Rufeng shook his head and said, "If they knew any critical joints, how would the bandits allow them to live?"

Although he said so, they still learned a few key things: Wang Shizhen acted on entrustment and received four hundred taels of silver; as for who entrusted him, he confessed, but by the time the escorts rushed to catch the person, this person had already hanged himself—needless to say, he was 'suicided'. Secondly, Steward Zhang was promised five thousand taels of silver after success. Half of the silver had been prepaid, and the other half was said to be given to him after he escaped to the designated location.

"If he received that other half, he would probably be dead by now."

"Not receiving it is just living a few more days." Liao Sanniang sighed. "Who gave him the promise?"

Given Steward Zhang's experience and worth, simply finding someone to persuade him wouldn't work, nor would taking out silver on the spot make him determined. The middleman must have considerable status and prestige.

"Speaking of which, it's an old acquaintance," Li Rufeng sneered. "It's Steward Qiao of the Xia Family Shanxi House."

Since Delong opened in the capital, friction between the Shanxi Houses in the capital and Delong had never ceased. It was really because Delong had a strong backing that although the Shanxi Houses had abundant funds, they dared not use tactics of extermination and could only make some small moves to disgust Delong.

"So it was him!" Liao Sanniang sneered. "No wonder, no wonder!"

"I think he was also ordered by others and may not be the real culprit." Li Rufeng said, "However, to reassure Steward Zhang, they had to borrow him for use."

Without such a leading figure in the banking world coming forward, Steward Zhang wouldn't have made the determination to betray Master Leng.

"Where is Steward Qiao? Jumped into the river or hanged himself?"

"They say it just happened to be his turn for the once-every-three-years annual leave this year, and he went back to his hometown in Shanxi."

"In this chaos of war, not staying in the capital but rushing home—is he not afraid of being robbed by bandits on the road? Besides, even if he returns to Shanxi, there are roving bandits everywhere. Rushing back for what?" Liao Sanniang ridiculed.

Needless to say, whether dead or alive, they wouldn't find Steward Qiao.

"Even if Steward Qiao can't be found, the Xia family must be aware."

This kept being useless. Among the eight Shanxi Houses in the capital, although Xia's was not the biggest, Shanxi Houses shared the same voice and breath due to fellow villager relations. With years of operation, they were deeply rooted and leafy. Their power was far from what Delong could compare with. Wanting to find the Xia family to inquire about the situation was wishful thinking.

Liao Sanniang sighed with disappointment.

Li Rufeng said, "Just now Old Wu said we could make a guess..."

Wu Kaidi said that whoever could make the Xia family act must not only be a big shot in the court but also inevitably an important client of the Xia family. Just speculating along this line of thought, the mastermind behind the scenes would be nine out of ten identified.
