# Chapter 2517: Court Discussion

Yang Cao asked, "Is there a need to close the net within the city?"

Wu Mu said, "Don't move for now. The bandit gangs have strong mobility. After the failure of pursuing Xu Tong, Iron Beam Temple has long been empty of people and empty of the mountain. The inner city is now a dead chess move, with no interaction with outside the city. Currently, the enemy is in the dark and we are in the light; sources of information are relatively singular. We need to expand intelligence sources as much as possible. Leaving this bait might catch fish. They will contact Liang Cunhou sooner or later. Besides, if we hit the Liang family, should we hit other families? Knocking out the lackeys outside the city, those inside the city are just fish meat on the chopping board. If the dishes can be more sumptuous, I don't mind starting dinner a little later."

The Capital, Forbidden City.

Palace of Heavenly Purity. The largest hall in the Inner Court, nine bays wide and five bays deep. Gray-white light and shadow reflected in from the window lattice behind the throne, dappled in the hall. The purple copper incense burner on the throne platform emitted curling faint smoke, misty and hazy, shrouding everything in a layer of twilight mist.

Chongzhen hesitated a bit, picked up a memorial from the imperial desk in front of him. Xiong Wencan's memorial had been transferred from the Wenshu Room for some time. The fall of Guangdong made Chongzhen somewhat stunned. The Kun thieves, or Australians, were mellow wine in a glazed bottle on the desk yesterday, but now they had become a difficult problem placed on the Empire's desk that needed to be faced.

The fragrant tea on the imperial desk had long gone cold. The tip of the vermilion brush had also dried up. Chongzhen stood up suddenly from the throne, standing silently with his back to the gold-lacquered screen for a long while. Suddenly he slammed the memorial in his hand onto the steps below with a *snap*. The memorial unfurled in the air like a fluttering butterfly, drifted suddenly, and fell weakly onto the gold bricks in front of the hall.

Chongzhen paced quickly and impatiently in front of the imperial desk, suddenly shouting loudly: "Xiong Wencan misleads the country! Powerless in fighting the Eastern Barbarians! Without method in pacifying roving bandits! Now he cannot even resist sea pirates! Since occupying the throne, We have been intent on invigorating things, approaching gentlemen and repelling petty men, abolishing guarding eunuchs, employing the Donglin, placing heart and soul in them, entrusting them as shielding walls. When these people entered the court, they only knew to argue about differences in opinion, fight for power and seize influence, form parties and pursue private interests. What has this exchanged for? Defeated soldiers and scarce pay. The Eastern Barbarians press under the Capital city, confronting Us across a wall! Now Guangdong is lost again. Who caused all this? Civil and military officials, We have never not added trust and use, but who has truly raised their spirits to do things wholeheartedly? Xiong Wencan spoke big and inflammatory words beforehand, tried to shift blame and gloss over errors afterward. Failing to soothe, failing to win in battle. We tolerated again and again, only hoping he would redeem crimes by recovering soil, but it only became doubly rotten, failing again and again, betraying grace and neglecting duty. Now he has the face to come ask for troops. Xiong Wencan is incompetent! The people of Guangdong deserve execution!" After speaking, a patch of abnormal flush appeared on Chongzhen's pale face. Heavy panting sounds echoed *whoosh whoosh* in the hall. But in the empty hall, no one answered his questioning.

Wang Chengen walked down the steps soundlessly, bowed and knelt down, whispering, "Your Majesty's body is tied to the state; ten thousand hopes that you protect the Sacred Body." Chongzhen sat back on the throne somewhat dejectedly, his panting gradually calming down. He waved his hand lightly and said, "State affairs are numerous and complicated. Since the beginning of the year, the Xian thief (Zhang Xianzhong) and Chuang thief (Li Zicheng) overcame Xingyang, trapped Zbongdu (Fengyang), causing Us to be guilty before the spirits of Heaven, Earth, and Ancestors. Now Guangdong is lost again. Fire on four sides, wind leaking on eight sides. We have seen enough of these bad luck matters that never end all day long. Accumulated for a long time, letting out some complaints. These words are only nagged to you intimate people. It is nothing. Summon the Grand Secretariat to enter for audience and reply." He muttered, seeming to speak to Wang Chengen, but his gaze stared blankly out the window, eyes tired and blurred.

Silence. The Palace of Heavenly Purity hall was abnormally quiet. several Grand Secretaries, eyes lowered to their chests. Everyone had already seen Xiong Wencan's memorial, but everyone seemed to be ignoring it intentionally or unintentionally. There were enough troubles. But no matter how unwilling, reality always had to be faced.

Chongzhen said: "The Kun thieves knocked on the sea (invaded), Guangdong has been lost for many days. Previously Xiong Wencan's memorials were all given to the Grand Secretariat for drafting comments and handed to the Ministry for reconsideration. Now Xiong has sent a letter asking for help again. Have the ministers discussed a countermeasure? Wen minister (Wen Tiren), since you are the Senior Grand Secretary, you speak."

Wen Tiren advanced calmly and bowed. To him, everything was already familiar. Reality struck this young monarch's fragile self-esteem one after another. The uncompromising nature of his youth made him appear impatient and overwhelmed in the face of the complex political situation. The experience of being a close relative prince did not accumulate the foundation of an emperor for him. Faced with the grass hut that was Great Ming, few people truly supported and upheld it. Most would only scoop a piece of mud or pull away a handful of thatch from it while it was in chaos, letting it sway more and more in the wind and rain.

The young emperor no longer trusted gentlemen in the wild (out of office), nor directed ministers in office. No one could bring him a sense of security. Renewed trust in eunuch factory officials was an unfriendly weather vane for court officials. For Wen Tiren, however, it might not be bad news. An isolated monarch and an isolated minister must rely on each other in trust. Isolated minister or dictator? It didn't matter; power was the true peak.

Wen Tiren said loudly: "Your Majesty, regarding the Kun thieves, the Grand Secretariat and the Ministry of War have had many meetings. However, the Kun thieves are visitors from overseas and are located in the remote Qiongzhou. Very little is known about their situation. observing Xiong Wencan's submission, although the Kun people falsely claim to be remnants of the former Song, they all have short hair and coarse clothes. Observing their clothing, etiquette, calendar, artifact manufacturing, and firearms, they are mostly similar to the overseas Red Barbarians. Their people mostly have Northern accents and should be sea bandits wandering in foreign lands adjacent to the Red Barbarians, absolutely not proper descendants of our China. They occupied Lingao, smuggling and trading privately with Guangzhou Prefecture for several years. Only today did they start to cause trouble and plunder. Although fierce, ugly, and arrogant, it can be known that the Kun thieves have no great ambition in their chests; otherwise, since their weapons and armor are sharp, why bother imprisoning themselves in Lingao? Xiong Wencan claimed that the fall of Guangzhou Prefecture was actually due to the Kun thieves taking advantage of convenience, inciting treacherous evils, wrapping up unruly people, and planting hidden spies for several years before being able to trick the city into falling. Observing their combat methods over time, it is obvious they are good at naval fleet water battles. The defeat of Qiongzhou lay in being struck while crossing halfway. Our dynasty lost all boats and ships, leading to tens of thousands of troops being trapped in the desperate land of Qiongya, without aid or food, resulting in this defeat. This strategy of attacking Guangdong, first defeating our water forces, then relying on ship cannons to bombard the shore, then taking Humen. At Lingyang Gorge and Zhaoqing, it was also like this: using the naval fleet as the vanguard, foot soldiers following, only then was there infantry combat. But once the water force was defeated, foot soldiers could not support alone, retreating again to Wuzhou. At Wuzhou, the Kun thieves used the old trick again, using ships to carry General Cannons to bombard the city, forcing common people to fill moats and attach like ants (climb walls), and with treacherous people echoing, causing the military city to fall. After the city broke, the Kun thieves set fire to burn the city, did not sheath swords for three days, taking pleasure in slaughter, heart set on looting. Corpses covered the wild horizontally, heads like mountains, tragic beyond description. Xiong Wencan led troops to fight the Kun thieves at Bangshan outside the city, facing enemies on four sides, resisting the Kun spearhead nine times, but the general trend was hard to reverse, thus leading troops to retreat into Guangxi. From this, it can be known that when Kun thieves march, soldiers do not leave boats, land does not leave water; advancing troops only follow river channels. Kun people have always been known for sharp firearms. Their firearms should be no less than the Ferengis. Also heard that Kun people are not only strong in water battles but also brave in land battles. Presumably, soldiers are all skilled in combat techniques. This can be compared to the Japanese pirates (Wakou) of those years. The likes of Wang Zhi formerly occupied a corner of Japan, repeatedly knocking on the seaside, causing very severe disasters. Until Qi Shaobao (Qi Jiguang) came out, created the Mandarin Duck Formation and Three Talents Formation. Although the Japanese pirates had sharp sword skills, Qi Shaobao used troop formations to frustrate their momentum of conflict. Advancing together and striking together, winning every battle, unsuccessful nowhere, then the Japanese disaster was immediately pacified. Therefore, we think, the Kun thieves never fight us in formation, obviously being good at water battles and solitary fighting, not good at formation. Therefore, they always play up their strengths and avoid their weaknesses. Although the Kun thieves' bandity flames are rampant, in the end, they are just a mob of bandits. Never heard that Kun people are good at practicing archery and horsemanship. Now they pause troops at Wuzhou, finding it hard to advance an inch, only confronting Xiong remotely. It shows their momentum is already an exhausted teacher and tired soldiers, having no heart for progress. In the end, it is just a scabies disease. Only need a strong army as the trunk, invite battle in the wild with a disciplined army, force a decisive battle, raise upright banners, arrange dignified formations, use foot soldiers as orthodox, horse soldiers as surprise, gathering like clouds and scattering like wind, changing and separating, destroy their chief culprit's house servants, then their coerced civilian soldiers will inevitably scatter like stars. Breaking them should not be difficult. If Zhejiang soldiers can be deployed to assist in suppression, then the Kun disaster will inevitably be resolved."

Chongzhen lowered his head listening seriously. Wait for him to finish speaking, he said: "Fighting war, what is fought is nothing more than soldiers and horses, money and grain, materials. What Minister Wen said—where does the pay come from?"

Wen Tiren pondered slightly and said, "The ministers conferred.Currently there is no place to get money. Only by adding levies again. Can increase levies for Guangdong Supplies (*Yueshuang*). Guangdong Supplies are divided into two items. One is equal transport, that is, assigning grain into *mu*. For every *mu* of field, levy an additional *Yueshuang* grain rice of six *ge* (0.6 liter). Calculating one *shi* of rice as eight *qian* (0.8 tael) of silver, about 1.8 million taels of silver can be raised. The second is excess land. Since the Wanli reign's land survey, registry records have been unclear, causing many fields not to be counted in collection. Now state affairs are difficult. After verifying these lands clearly, levy uniformly. Like this, another few hundred thousand taels can be produced. Two items combined can levy at least about 2.1 million taels more. The levy period is one year. When the Kun disaster is pacified, the Guangdong Supplies stop. Salt tax silver and student exemption silver can also be slightly increased. Like this, it should be enough for use."

Chongzhen sighed lightly and said, "Chongzhen Year Three added new supplies. Like this continuous adding of levies, the people's strength cannot get a slight breath. This is the policy of draining the pond to catch fish."

Wen Tiren was silent for a moment and said, "Your Majesty sympathizes with the people's will, but military intelligence is as urgent as wind and fire, cannot be delayed for a moment. Lu Xiangsheng, Hong Chengchou, and other Governor-Generals fight over a thousand *li*, urging for food and pay very urgently. Now breaking fronts and pulling banners, right at the critical moment. Still need soldiers to forge ahead; absolutely cannot fall short of success by one basket. Only when the world is pacified can we take turns exempting grain taxes and rest with the people."

Speaking to this, Wen Tiren paused slightly and continued: "The Kun disaster is a minor matter. Currently, roving bandits are raging, spreading disaster to several provinces. It is an affliction of the elbow and armpit. Your Majesty should still take this as the main focus."

Chongzhen said, "How should Xiong Wencan be dealt with?"

Wen Tiren said, "Can allow him to bear guilt and be demoted while temporarily acting in his post. Although Xiong Wencan lost division and lost land, currently there is really no one who understands Kun affairs and knows Kun situations. Changing the commander before battle, fear the army's heart will waver. Not knowing the details, on the contrary, lose the situation formed with difficulty right now. Xiong has frustrated the enemy spearhead repeatedly, but defeated repeatedly and fighting repeatedly, willing to risk arrows and stones, and can charge ahead bravely. Now he hopes to invigorate, contacting Guangdong loyal and brave righteous people. Soon he will raise the bamboo pole for uprising. In his person's memorial, he requested to be given the power to act as circumstances dictate, to praise loyalty and righteousness. After the ministers discussed, felt we can allow what he requested."

Hearing this, Chongzhen nodded lightly, exhaled lightly and said, "Allowed. Who can be the Governor-General for conquering the Kun?"

Wen Tiren said, "Hong Chengchou, Lu Xiangsheng, etc., are all commander subjects, but suppressing roving bandits requires Mount Sumeru not to leave for a moment. Still invite the Sacred Heart to decide alone."

Chongzhen said, "Later you and I, monarch and subjects, will discuss together."
