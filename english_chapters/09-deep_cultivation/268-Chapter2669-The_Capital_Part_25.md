# Chapter 2669: The Capital (Part 25)

Yangzhou sat at a vital juncture of the Grand Canal, its prosperity born of the endless stream of north-south traffic. This flourishing economy had given rise to an equally thriving entertainment industry. Whether government music bureaus or private brothels, business boomed everywhere—truly confirming the old saying: "Green towers in every lane, songs through every night." It was precisely this unique position that had allowed Prefect Zhou Song to hone the art of hosting to perfection. Once official matters concluded, he invited Wang Yehao to visit the designated reception venue the following day: the Moon Plucking Tower beside Slender West Lake in the northern quarter of the city, there to drink and make merry.

Strictly speaking, court law forbade officials from visiting prostitutes. Indeed, the prevalence of male homosexuality in the capital was largely an unintended consequence of this very prohibition. But the Ming Dynasty had endured for many generations, and its laws had grown lax over time. One need only recall when the "Three Yangs"—Yang Shiqi, Yang Rong, and Yang Pu—had once joined together to invite the famous courtesan Qi Yaxiu to serve wine. The Grand Secretary had mocked her as a "bitch without manners." Quick-witted as she was, the courtesan replied, "If I am a Mother Dog, then surely the Lord is a Male Monkey"—playing on the homophone for "Public Marquis." The exchange became a celebrated tale of its time. Yet during the Xuande reign, Censor Zhao Lun of Huguang had been punished with exile to Liaodong merely for "fornicating with a music woman." Everyone understood what such cases truly meant: those impeached for such transgressions were masters who had no protectors above and who carelessly made enemies below.

Before monstrous power, a few "Thin Horses" counted for nothing. Thus Wang Yehao focused on attending to the feelings of this "Rough Stock" Mr. Zhou. After their formal meeting, he hinted obliquely to Prefect Zhou: arrange fewer literati for the entertainment. As for the singing girls, there was no need to fuss over their voices—"beautiful appearance" was the priority. To put it plainly, they would be going straight to the "meat market," so there was no need for elaborate peripheral programs. Prefect Zhou was rather surprised once he grasped these demands. This Master Wang was a *Jinshi* degree holder, after all—why did he carry himself like a hungry ghost? But then, literati often harbored strange predilections, so this little preference was nothing unusual. Prefect Zhou promptly assured him he understood the Master's meaning and arranged for only one companion: Squad Leader Tian, a local veteran of the pleasure quarters.

A Squad Leader—*Bazong*—in the Ming Dynasty differed from its Qing Dynasty counterpart; it was not a low-ranking military position. Though Squad Leader Tian could not be called extremely wealthy, he possessed substantial assets. He loved pleasure, appreciated beauty, excelled at networking, and was renowned as one of Yangzhou's most romantic figures. His daughter, Tian Xiuying, had been selected as a side consort for Prince Xin, which made him, by extension, a royal relative.

In truth, Wang Yehao had no refined interest in appreciating Thin Horses; he purely wished to please this Mr. Zhou. Lately, his trust in the "Immortal" had grown ever deeper. He had encountered many such immortals in the capital before—monks, Taoists, and warlocks who all claimed they could commune with spirits, summon gods, and divine fortune from misfortune. But most of their pronouncements were deliberately vague. If matters were not arranged beforehand, they resorted to forced interpretations afterward. A "Prophet" like the Teacher, whose appearance bore no mystical air whatsoever yet whose predictions proved accurate to the very day—that was truly an anomaly.

With Mr. Zhou at his side, the court situation became as clear as watching flames. Dimly, Wang Yehao sensed he now held the general tide of affairs in his grasp. *Heaven is truly helping me!* He felt secretly smug. He had stumbled upon a treasure indeed! Now everything hinged on whether the prophecy of the Nine Thousand Years' downfall would come true. If it did, then entering the Grand Secretariat, becoming Prime Minister, reaching the pinnacle of officialdom—all would lie within his palm!

Yet he was an official tempered by many years of cultivation, so he still made two-handed preparations: continuing to deal perfunctorily with the Eunuch Party while secretly arranging an escape route in advance. When he had returned to Shaoxing and discussed building a Living Shrine for the Nine Thousand Years with Prefect Zhang Luwei, he had cunningly avoided putting pen to paper. The situation remained unclear; the proposal for the shrine could be verbally agreed to, but no written evidence must be left behind. Claiming credit was easy enough, but clearing one's name later proved troublesome.

The person who had inexplicably joined his entourage represented exactly one of these escape routes. His name was Jin Wenchi, a former advisor to Wei Dazhong—one of the "First Six Gentlemen" of the Donglin Party.

After Wei Dazhong's arrest and subsequent death in the Imperial Prison, most members of his circle had been persecuted by the Eunuch Party and gone into hiding under assumed identities. Jin Wenchi was among them. Though he held a *Xiucai* degree, he dared not return to his native place or reveal his true identity. Instead, he set up a stall at Anchang Ferry in Shaoxing, writing documents for others.

Poverty and frustration eventually forced him into a property dispute case, forging documents on someone's behalf. The forgery was discovered; he was hauled before the county magistrate, and under interrogation, his true identity came to light.

Wei Dazhong was already dead, and Jin Wenchi could hardly be counted among the high-ranking "backbone" members. So with just a few words, Wang Yehao had secured this man for himself.

To the Eunuch Party, Jin Wenchi held little value. But to Wang Yehao, Jin's identity as "Wei Dazhong's advisor" was remarkable. Should heaven and earth overturn, this man could serve as a strategic piece held in reserve.

Thus, although Jin Wenchi wore shackles throughout the journey, he suffered no real hardship. Upon reaching the Yangzhou boundary, the shackles were simply unlocked, and he was treated to good food and drink—more comfortable than his usual circumstances. Once they arrived in Yangzhou, Wang Yehao took advantage of their stopover to win him over once more.

Zhou Lezhi naturally did not understand Master Wang's painstaking calculations. He had only heard from Wang Liang that the prisoner was an advisor the Master intended to recruit—and because a case hung over him, he had to wear shackles while on the road.

"If he's a prisoner, how can he become an advisor?"

"How naive you are!" Wang Liang sneered. "Guilty or innocent—isn't it just a word from the Prefect? And who does the Prefect listen to? Doesn't he have to heed our Master?"

That evening, as lanterns first flickered to life, guests and hosts took their seats. Delicacies and jade-colored wines spread before them; rouged cheeks, powdered faces, and fluttering feminine presences surrounded them on every side. As host, Prefect Zhou began by introducing the attending guests to one another.

"This is Master Wang. Last year he toured Guangdong as Imperial Inspector, providing disaster relief and pacifying the populace. His merit is high and his labors hard. Upon returning to the capital this time, he will surely rise to great heights!"

"Long admired, long admired." A sturdy middle-aged man beside him cupped his hands in greeting.

"And this is Master Tian—formerly an Imperially Appointed Squad Leader, now enjoying leisure at home. When it comes to patrons of Yangzhou's romantic establishments, if Squad Leader Tian claims second place, no one dares claim first!" Prefect Zhou was obviously well-acquainted with him, speaking without reserve. "The second wife Squad Leader Tian took back then was none other than Miss Xue, the finest zither player of this very Moon Plucking Tower. Such romantic fortune truly makes others envious! Originally, his daughter at home also learned a masterful hand at the zither—but alas, she was selected as a Princess Consort and departed for the capital a few years ago. We no longer have the pleasure of hearing her play."

"Master Zhou jests." The middle-aged man was quite at ease, having already pulled a girl into his embrace.

As the saying goes, the speaker may have no intent, but the listener hears with purpose. Upon hearing this introduction, Wang Yehao immediately inquired, "General Tian, is the Tian family's side consort—the one Prince Xin took in earlier—your noble daughter?"

"Ha! Indeed, that is my little Xiuying." Squad Leader Tian beamed with pleasure. "That child has a fortunate fate. Her mother was originally renowned for her zither skills. We taught her a bit of the art, merely hoping some gentleman might take a fancy to her someday. Who could have imagined she would be selected for Prince Xin's residence? Her life can be considered free of worry now."

Wang Yehao thought to himself, *This is far more than just freedom from worry.* If Mr. Zhou's prophecy held true, the man sitting before him would become the future Imperial Father-in-Law. If he did not cultivate this connection now, when else would he? "I have long heard that General Tian is heroic and chivalrous, comparable to the legendary Lord Mengchang. Meeting you today, I see your bearing is indeed extraordinary. My respects, my respects."

Though Tian Hongyu counted as a royal relative when one lined up such connections, in reality his daughter was merely a side-chamber concubine newly married to a prince who had not yet departed to his fief. Few people bothered to "warm his cold stove." Wang Yehao's flattery today made him feel quite gratified; his mood improved, and his words flowed more freely. "You're too kind, too kind. Lord Mengchang kept three thousand retainers—how could I compare? Raising three or five Thin Horses is enough to satisfy me."

"When it comes to the art of raising Thin Horses, Squad Leader Tian's expertise surpasses his skill at raising soldiers!" Prefect Zhou quipped from the side.

"General Tian is truly a romantic scholar of renown!" Wang Yehao continued his flattery.

"Speaking of raising soldiers, Tian dares not claim any expertise." After several cups of wine, Tian Hongyu's spirits rose. "But speaking of raising Thin Horses—there, Tian does have some insights."

"How fortunate we are tonight. Please enlighten us, General Tian."

"Gladly, gladly." Tian Hongyu accepted the wine offered by a girl and continued, "Raising Thin Horses requires attention to seven words: Thin, Small, Sharp, Curved, Fragrant, Soft, Upright. They must enter the trade at six or seven years of age. Any older and they become tainted with worldly *Qi*—the common air of ordinary life. No matter how rigorously they are disciplined afterward, they can never become first-class goods."

He spoke with great animation, and the Zhou master and disciple listened, entranced. Strictly speaking, this was the first time either had seriously visited a pleasure establishment. The luxury and indulgence of this brothel exceeded anything Zhou Lezhi—a poor youth from the Guangdong countryside—could have imagined. In comparison, Mr. Zhou's eyes held more curiosity than surprise.

The various dishes on the banquet table also broadened his horizons. Huai-Yang cuisine had always been celebrated for fresh ingredients and refined technique. Though the specific dishes differed from those of later generations, the essence and sophistication remained consistent. He longed to sample the flavors, but no one reached for their chopsticks. He had no choice but to continue sitting idly, exchanging pleasantries and flattery.

When he heard Tian Hongyu's discourse, however, his investigative curiosity stirred once more. He asked, "General Tian, forgive this younger brother's limited knowledge—do these Thin Horses have formal grades as well?"

"Naturally they do. I see this brother is unfamiliar with such matters." Tian Hongyu recognized a novice at a glance and assumed the posture of a seasoned mentor. "These Thin Horses are divided into three grades. The lower grade practices needlework and cooking; only wealthy households can afford to keep them. The middle grade learns arithmetic, writing, and practical arts—keeping accounts, managing household affairs. Such girls can be called true helpmeets. The upper grade learns poetry, songs, zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting, possessing a hundred forms of attentiveness and a thousand shades of ineffable sentiment. Only these can be called genuine Beauties."

Zhou Lezhi listened with growing fascination, thinking ruefully that he would probably never have the fortune to enjoy such "Thin Horse" companions in this lifetime. The Teacher beside him, however, found the whole discussion rather beside the point. With his own abilities, even upper-grade Thin Horses could not hold a real conversation with him. All this talk of romance was far less practical than simply taking a proper bath.

Yet after only two rounds of wine, his perspective shifted. The brothel was not simply a place that traded on beauty—it more closely resembled a high-end entertainment establishment. The professional quality of the girls accompanying them and singing songs was remarkably high; they could make any type of guest feel comfortable. So no matter what nonsense the Teacher spouted, or even when he began expounding on "What is Physics" after a few extra cups, the girls could earnestly play the role of enthusiastic listeners, offering cheers and exclamations at appropriate intervals, greatly satisfying his vanity.

The banquet lasted nearly four hours. Driven by Tian Hongyu's convivial energy, the atmosphere remained warm and harmonious throughout; both guests and hosts thoroughly enjoyed themselves. When it appeared they had celebrated enough, Prefect Zhou turned to Wang Yehao and said, "Master Wang, there is a queen among courtesans in this Moon Plucking Tower—she goes by Miss Youqing. She leads the way in allure and is unmatched in both beauty and artistic accomplishment. Ordinarily, she does not easily grant audiences. But knowing the Master visits tonight, she waits specially in the pavilion. Why doesn't Master Wang go enjoy a cup of fragrant tea with her?"
