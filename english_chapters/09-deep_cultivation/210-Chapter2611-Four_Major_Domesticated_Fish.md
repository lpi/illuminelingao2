# Chapter 2611: Four Major Domesticated Fish

Thinking that Guan Youde used to be a "Zhuangjia," Chen Wuren asked about fish fry again: "Brother Guan, I heard that Jiujiang's fish fry are all caught from the West Sea (West River). Why not sell them directly to Zaojia to put into ponds for raising? Why the need to pass through the hands of Zhuangjia?"

Guan Youde said, "Old Gentleman is indeed a meticulous thinker. The fish fry caught by Dan households are impure, containing all kinds of fish species. They must not be mixed raised at will, otherwise within a pond, I fear no remnants will be left. The merit of Zhuangjia lies in separating the fish fry caught by Dan households, leaving only Grass carp (*Huan*), Silver carp (*Lian*), Bighead carp (*Yong*), and Mud carp (*Ling*), called the Four Major Domesticated Fish."

How to separate fish fry was naturally the secret of Zhuangjia, mostly inherited for generations by Zhuangjia and kept secret from others.

As a local, Chen Wuren still had the concept of the Four Major Domesticated Fish. Before the Tang Dynasty, the main variety farmed by fishermen was carp (*Li*). Because the Tang Dynasty emperors' surname was Li, Li and Carp sounded the same, and "Carp" symbolized the royal family, it could not be caught or sold. Therefore, fishermen had to find new farming varieties. *Huan* is grass carp; *Lian* is silver carp, also called white silver carp; *Yong* is bighead carp, also called flower silver carp; unlike the Yangtze River basin, Jiujiang villagers didn't raise black carp but raised mud carp, commonly known as local mud carp or mud carp male (*Ling Gong*), which is a unique variety in South China. By the early Ming, the coordinate farming of Four Major Domesticated Fish was already very mature.

"If my clan raises fish, how many fish should be stored in one *mu* of pond?" Chen Wuren asked.

Zhong Ji, who was following along, listened to such a retarded question and laughed, "For every one *mu* of pond, store thirty grass carp, one hundred and twenty silver carp, fifty bighead carp, and more than a thousand local mud carp."

"Why is the number of local mud carp so disparate?" The one asking was Lin Chengwen, promotion manager of Tiandihui in the Guangzhou area. In his impression, Lingao didn't raise them like this.

Zhong Ji said, "Brother doesn't know. As the saying goes; 'Mud carp cannot be raised.' Mud carp like heat and have difficulty surviving winter. By autumn and winter, not one in ten survives. If they don't overwinter, they won't be fat; if not fat, the price is cheap."

"Oh? The selling prices of the Four Major Domesticated Fish are different?" Chen Wuren asked.

"Every year is slightly different, but in summary, the price is expensive for bighead and silver carp because they grow easily without consuming grass. Mud carp are hard to grow, rarely weighing up to one *jin*, and must pass winter cold to be fat, while grass carp consume grass, so the price is cheap." Zhong Ji replied.

"How much grass do grass carp consume?" Lin Chengwen asked.

"For every hundred grass carp, one hundred *jin* of grass is needed daily. Grass carp eat grass, while bighead and silver carp eat the gum liquid of grass, or the feces of grass carp can also fertilize them." Zhong Ji said.

As a cadre of Tiandihui, Lin Chengwen had contacted freshwater fish farming in Lingao. He knew that silver carp and bighead carp were both filter-feeding fish, generally using gills to filter plankton in the water, and also liked to eat bean cakes, wheat bran, and other feeds. Because fertile water bodies bred more plankton, these two kinds of fish liked to chase fertile water bodies and often were active in the upper layer of water. Grass carp belonged to herbivorous fish, mainly eating grass, also eating some grains, bean cakes, silkworm pupae, earthworms, etc., liking to wander and forage in the middle and lower layers of water. Local mud carp were the smallest, belonging to omnivorous fish, often eating debris of higher plants and bottom humus, generally active in the middle and lower layers of water bodies.

The large amount of food debris and feces left by grass carp in the middle layer of water were excellent nutrients for plankton. Mass-reproduced plankton provided a large amount of food for silver carp and bighead carp. Bottom-layer mud carp carried out the final cleaning of food residues of upper and middle-layer fish. The existence of the latter three prevented food residues and plankton from enriching in large quantities, ensuring fresh water quality in the fish pond. Fish in different water layers chased food, stirring the water body, which increased dissolved oxygen in the water. Therefore, the coordinated farming of Four Major Domesticated Fish was a huge leap in agricultural technology history, conducting a relatively thorough utilization of limited water bodies.

Chen Wuren asked Zhong Ji, "I wonder how to transport Summer Fry back to Xiangshan after buying?"

Zhong Ji said, "There are few Gengzhongjia in Xiangshan and few fish markets. Old Gentleman should hire people to transport them back. If selling to nearby places, fish fry are big; if selling to distant places, fish fry are small. Those traveling by land carry two baskets on a pole, swaying their shoulders, forcing the baskets to move up and down to agitate the water to make waves, making fish feel like in a pond. After walking another two or three *li*, sink the baskets into the river to change fresh water, then fish get their nature. If traveling by water, carry fish in a fish fry boat. Two waterwheels beside the boat turn water day and night, making fresh water enter the boat while old water doesn't stay, then fish fry won't get sick. Water transport from Jiujiang to Xiangshan is convenient. Since Old Gentleman is from a big household, water transport is better. If booking with me, I can find a fish fry boat for Mister to deliver to your esteemed township."

"Oh? What is the price of fish fry now?"

"Actually, the price of fish fry is about the same as adult fish," Zhong Ji held out four fingers of his right hand and said, "Four taels of silver per hundred *jin* of bighead and silver carp, two taels for grass carp, one tael for mud carp."

The investigation team didn't really want to buy fish fry. Chen Wuren listened and laughed it off, "There is still some time before Summer Fry hit the market. No rush, no rush. Wait until I return home to arrange digging dikes. When things are done, I will definitely come to find Brother Zhong."

"No harm. Even if business isn't done, benevolence and righteousness remain."

Chen Wuren remembered a thing missed before and asked Guan Youde, "Dare I ask Brother Guan, how are the fish fry of Four Major Domesticated Fish screened apart?"

Seeing he wasn't booking fish fry but asking this, Guan Youde felt somewhat displeased in his heart. Although not showing it on his face, the tone of his answer was somewhat blunt: "Old Gentleman's questions are a bit too many. Fish fry, fine as needles, tens of millions in one scoop; only Jiujiang people can distinguish them. 'Piehua' (Skimming Fry) is the skill we Zhuangjia eat on; it has always been a family-transmitted method, never taught to outsiders."

Chen Wuren stayed in Lingao for a long time and developed the habit of asking why when not understanding. Only when Guan Youde said this did he realize it was inappropriate. In ancient times, any skill with a bit of technical content was basically family inheritance or master-sect inheritance, and passed to males not females, afraid that daughters would take the technology to their husband's family when marrying. Apprentices had to work like oxen and horses for masters, acting as free labor for several years, to learn the skill from the master. Masters often held back a trick; otherwise, how could there be the saying "starve the master to death after teaching the apprentice."

But in Lingao, except for a few secrets, which Senator didn't wish to pour all knowledge down to the naturalized citizens under them, afraid they wouldn't learn. Whenever meeting a naturalized citizen who liked to ask why, technical Senators were as happy as winning a lottery, holding them in palms like treasures. Comparing the two, Chen Wuren sighed endlessly; why was the gap so big?

Wandering in the Fish Fry Market for a long time, the sun had risen to the top, and the temperature gradually rose. Guan Youde was a medicine jar; feeling somewhat physically exhausted, he bid farewell to the investigation team: "Master Mo, my body is a bit weary, head dizzy and brain swollen. I won't accompany you all; hope you forgive me."

Mo Yu had been stationed in Jiujiang for two years and knew Guan Youde wasn't lying, so he didn't keep him. After Guan Youde and Zhong Ji left, Lin Chengwen said to Chen Wuren, "Section Chief Chen, forget it if we didn't ask the Skimming Fry method. In the future, we rely on artificial breeding; eggs of different varieties are separated from the beginning, so the link of Skimming Fry won't exist. If they want to guard this secret, let them guard it; best take it into the coffin."

Chen Wuren nodded, "Indeed. However, the Chief instructed us to figure out all links of Jiujiang Township's fish fry production; there must be his reason. It seems this matter isn't so easy to figure out."

Hearing it was the Chief's instruction, Mo Yu said, "This is simple. Next time some blind Zhuangjia falls into my hands, I will definitely make him explain clearly, otherwise don't think about slipping away from my hands."

Chen Wuren said, "Brother Mo, the Senate has always ruled the country by law. Extorting confessions by torture will be punished."

"Thanks for Section Chief Chen's reminder. I can make them confess honestly without torture, hehe..." Mo Yu smiled sinisterly.

"Actually, I heard an agriculture ministry Chief mention the principle of Skimming Fry before. Roughly, it distinguishes fish according to different species' habits of living in different water layers. The rest is a matter of proficiency." Lin Chengwen said, "Usually floating at the very top are bighead carp, in the middle are silver carp, slightly lower are grass carp, and the bottom layer are mud carp. After putting fish fry in a bamboo basket, let them swim for one or two hours, then use a wooden fish plate painted with white paint to gently stir the water, skimming fish out from top to bottom according to different layers of various fish in the water."

Chen Wuren said, "There is a difference between principle and actual operation. Don't forget that besides the Four Major Domesticated Fish, other fish species are mixed inside. Some fish species live in the same water layer, and fish fry are fine as needles; distinguishing them is not easy."

Lin Chengwen said, "Doesn't matter. Anyway, it's a skill going into the coffin. Judging from the information currently visited, Jiujiang's freshwater fish farming technology is not stronger than ours, although this already represents the highest level of the natives."

"Little Lin, are you serious?" Mo Yu was somewhat surprised. Although he followed the Senate very early and knew the Senate did better than locals in everything, he didn't expect the Senate to have technical advantages even in raising fish.

Lin Chengwen said, "Isn't it! Take the stocking ratio of Four Major Domesticated Fish for example. Lingao stocks at least one hundred grass carp per *mu*, and mud carp is just five hundred. They stock only thirty grass carp, showing they don't have enough fodder grass. Mud carp requires stocking one thousand, which is because they haven't figured out the overwintering technology for mud carp yet. But the biggest problem still lies in the dike-pond ratio..."

Hearing Lin Chengwen actually questioning the dike-pond ratio of Jiujiang Township, Mo Yu's curiosity arose instantly, asking, "What should be the correct dike-pond ratio?"

"There is no correct or incorrect, only suitable or unsuitable." Lin Chengwen didn't keep him in suspense, saying, "Lingao's dike-pond ratio is 'Six Waters Four Dikes,' while here it's the reverse, 'Four Waters Six Dikes.' The productivity of fish ponds hasn't been brought into full play. Moreover, according to my observation, the area of local single fish ponds is mostly under five *mu*, while Lingao's fish ponds aid for between seven *mu* and ten *mu*. However, 'Four Waters Six Dikes' should be adapted to the local people's production mode. Since it's called mulberry dike fish pond, the sericulture industry also influences the fishery industry."

Mo Yu listened thoughtfully and said, "Makes sense. The profit of Jiujiang relies mostly on fish fry, next sericulture, next rice, next longlongan, next taro. If the fish pond area is small, with many dikes and few ponds, the income is naturally insufficient. Indeed, there is still much room for improvement."
