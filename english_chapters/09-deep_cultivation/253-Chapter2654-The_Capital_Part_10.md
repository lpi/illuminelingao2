# Chapter 2654: The Capital (Part 10)

"If that's the case, all the better!" Both assistant managers voiced their agreement. Li Rufeng, however, remained skeptical. "Are you confident this will work?"

"I can't guarantee anything, but there's always hope." Wu Kaidi had already formulated a plan. "We mustn't delay. We'll divide our efforts. Masters Li and Liao will investigate the circumstances of the Master's disappearance. I'll go to Shuntian Prefecture to feel out my connections and see if there's any room for negotiation. As for the two assistant managers, your priority is to stabilize the bank. Continue processing receivables and payables as normal for now..."

Assistant Manager Xiao interjected, "If we can't suspend operations, the counter can hold out for three to five days at most—and that's assuming the major account holders don't come calling for their deposits."

The large depositors held anywhere from several thousand to over ten thousand taels each. One stroke of bad luck, one major withdrawal request, and the counter would be bled dry. The big clients had to be placated first, and one of Delong's primary customer bases was the eunuchs of the imperial palace.

These eunuchs had always been renowned for their avarice. From the Director of Ceremonial down to the lowliest unranked servants, all regarded the accumulation of wealth as the measure of their capability. When one considered it, this was hardly surprising. Eunuchs were rootless men—without children, without true families. The only thing they could depend upon was their gold and silver. Thus, they guarded their money as fiercely as their own lives. Should a bank run truly erupt, it would become a powder keg threatening to destroy Delong entirely.

Even if Leng Ningyun himself were present, he would have little confidence facing such a predicament—let alone now, when his whereabouts remained unknown. Small wonder that Wu Kaidi placed his hopes on having the authorities "seal the shop."

Wu Kaidi heaved a sigh. "If only we could devise some method to keep the depositors calm."

Assistant Manager Xiao furrowed his brow in thought, then spoke. "Delong's major clients can be divided into three categories based on their motivations. The first type deposits purely for profit and interest. The second type fears the shifting winds at court—the possibility of conviction and confiscation of their estates—so they split their wealth between two locations as a safeguard, a path of retreat prepared in advance. The third type understands something of the Australian Song's situation and intends to transfer their funds early, hoping to preserve their lives and families when the time comes."

Liao Sanniang spoke up from the side. "For this third type, we can share certain information with them. When the Australian Song army eventually marches north, we should advise them not to misjudge which way the wind is blowing."

Assistant Manager Xiao hesitated briefly, then addressed Li Rufeng. "Once we leave here, I'll immediately split up with the clerks to visit each client personally. These latter two categories can be reassured. But as for the first type..."

Wu Kaidi sucked his teeth and nodded grimly. "The ransom money—I'll do everything in my power to raise it. Delong should be secure in the short term. Our major clients are all cabinet ministers at court, influential figures in the provinces, and noble eunuchs in the palace. Protecting Delong means protecting their own fortunes. But if this drags on too long, there's no telling what complications might arise..."

Li Rufeng and Liao Sanniang bowed once more to Wu Kaidi and the assistant managers. "We're placing ourselves entirely in your capable hands."

Manager Wei raised another concern. "How will the two Eunuch Yangs view this situation? They're also shareholders."

Assistant Manager Xiao snorted derisively. "Those two? They'll probably rush to send someone over to withdraw their silver the moment they hear. Did you really expect them to weather this storm alongside us? We'd have better luck counting on the Liaohai Firm..."

"Master Li's Liaohai Firm certainly has substantial resources, but they're not going to hand us tens of thousands in cash without good reason..."

Countless thoughts churned through Wu Kaidi's mind. If one were to speak of merchants in the capital who possessed both the willingness and the means to mobilize large sums of silver on their behalf, the only candidate was indeed Li Luoyou's Liaohai Firm Beijing Branch. However, ever since the Senate had captured Liangguang, Master Li's attitude toward them had grown noticeably cooler. Although their business dealings hadn't been severed outright, Master Leng had extended several dinner invitations to Li Luoyou—each one politely but firmly declined.

Now that they found themselves in such desperate straits, the chances were nine in ten that Li Luoyou would be unwilling to wade into these troubled waters.

Still, compared to approaching the Shanxi banking houses, this avenue at least offered a glimmer of possibility worth pursuing.

Wu Kaidi spoke again. "Old Xiao, Old Wei—this approach is worth attempting. It's better than sitting here doing nothing. The Liaohai Firm has made considerable profit through its dealings with the Senate over the years; they might be said to share our fortunes, for good or ill. If they truly abandon us in our hour of need, I doubt they'll be able to face the Senate when negotiating future business."

"We'll have to try." Though both men agreed verbally, the expressions on their faces betrayed their lack of confidence.

Seeing that Liao Sanniang had concluded matters on her end, Li Rufeng cleared his throat loudly to reclaim everyone's attention. "Let's discuss the essential business."

He pressed against the armrest, leaning his body toward Wu Kaidi. "Mister Wu, has this situation been reported to Guangzhou?"

Though Wu Kaidi still harbored some resentment over Li Rufeng's earlier conduct, he recognized this was no time for pettiness or tantrums. Suppressing his displeasure, he replied, "It has. However, the telegram equipment cannot transmit over such distances. I fear we won't receive instructions for some time."

Li Rufeng nodded and rose to his feet, speaking with clear deliberation. "Even if Guangzhou dispatches someone to assume control of the Beijing Station, the round trip spans four thousand *li*. It will take considerable time. We can't expect anyone to arrive within ten days, perhaps not even half a month."

He glanced at Liao Sanniang before continuing. "On our way back, Sanniangzi and I discussed several proposals. We'd like to present them now for everyone's consideration."

The group bowed together in acknowledgment.

Liao Sanniang spoke first. "The Chief Escort and I discussed this at length. Since the authorities haven't made any move against us, we can conclude that neither the Eastern Depot nor the Embroidered Guard are responsible. Master Leng has no enemies in Beijing. Our rival banks certainly lack the ruthlessness and capability for such an operation. To employ methods like these, it must be the work of major bandits."

Wu Kaidi started in surprise. "What could they be after?"

Li Rufeng answered from beside her. "Most likely wealth."

At this, everyone exchanged glances and fell to whispering among themselves.

Liao Sanniang continued. "Such incidents occur in both the north and south—they're hardly rare. In Guangxi, the Yao and Zhuang peoples abduct people in broad daylight to demand ransom, a practice they call '*Duo Jin*.' In the north, it's known as 'Capturing for Ransom.' To have expended such effort investigating Master Leng's background shows genuine calculation on their part. Since the bandits have such valuable goods in hand, why would they waste them? They will certainly make contact with us. Masters, please remain calm and patient. There will undoubtedly be news before long."

Li Rufeng nodded in agreement and took up the thread. "Firstly—and this hardly needs saying—our most urgent priority is saving the Master. If the bandits truly seek money, we must prepare in advance to avoid being caught off guard. The Australian Song has a saying: Problems that can be solved with money aren't problems at all. If we can avoid violence and recover Master Leng safely in exchange for a considerable sum of money and goods, then even if we bear some responsibility for the loss, we can justify our actions."

He paused, contemplating for a moment as he slowly turned the walnuts in his hand. "In hostage situations of this nature, the government has never set a precedent for paying ransom to redeem captives and letting bandits escape unpunished. More often than not, they pursue outcomes where both bandits and hostages perish together. The constables and petty officials typically exploit such circumstances as excuses to extort the victim's family for bribes and kickbacks. Therefore, we must absolutely not pin our hopes on the authorities. They want to apprehend criminals; we want to rescue a life. Our fundamental objectives are at cross-purposes—it's impossible to achieve both. We cannot simply sit with our hands bound, waiting for fate to decide. We must make every effort to rescue Master Leng ourselves. After we disperse, Sanniangzi and I will dispatch people to contact the leaders and headmen of the city's beggars, rascals, bare-sticks, and ruffians. We'll cast our nets wide to gather intelligence. These denizens of the marketplace are invariably the best informed. This is work of the drilling, poking, spying sort—a business that often demands splashing hot blood. You gentlemen of refinement naturally have no knowledge of the filthy, underhanded tricks of this *Jianghu*. This aspect of the task falls within my domain, so Sanniangzi and I shall bear the burden. However, I must ask Mister Wu to direct some silver our way to cover the necessary expenses. Matters of this sort require spending money like water—frugality won't serve us here. We also need to raise the ransom in advance."

Wu Kaidi exchanged troubled looks with Assistant Managers Xiao and Wei. "While the Leng residence does have some silver reserves, it's not a substantial sum. As for Delong's operating capital, diverting those funds would be... problematic."

Li Rufeng pressed the point. "However difficult, we must find a way."

Liao Sanniang turned to address Wu Kaidi as well. "Secondly, we need Mister Wu to personally handle the various official matters with Wanping County and Shuntian Prefecture—greasing palms high and low, gathering intelligence from government channels. Mister Wu, is there anyone in the Leng residence who can serve as the 'suffering host'—the formal plaintiff?"

Wu Kaidi leaned forward slightly. "Master Leng has a personal secretary named Hexiang. She ordinarily manages documents and attends to Master Leng's daily needs. To outsiders, we've always maintained that Master Leng's official wife remains at their home estate and didn't accompany him here. Hexiang serves as Master Leng's managing concubine. She can step forward to handle all such matters."

Li Rufeng nodded. "Good."

He then turned to address the Delong managers. "Thirdly, we must trouble you managers to stabilize Delong's situation. We'll need funds, so the bank cannot suffer additional upheaval. But when it comes to banking operations, I'm like a rolling pin trying to blow fire—utterly ignorant. I entrust this entirely to you all. Li bows to you here." With that, he bent low in a deep obeisance to the Delong representatives.

Assistant Manager Xiao and the others hastily clasped their hands and returned the bow. "We wouldn't dare accept such courtesy—we're only doing our duty, our duty."

Just as they were speaking, someone arrived from outside to report that Head Constable Qi of the Shuntian Prefecture Fast Squad had come.

The announcement sent a jolt through everyone present. It was Wu Kaidi who kept his composure, instructing the others to wait there while he personally went out to handle the situation.

Li Rufeng made no objection. He was well acquainted with the ways of government offices: it was standard procedure for the Fast Squad to come and detain witnesses. That the Head Constable himself had come in person indicated two things—first, that they regarded this matter as highly significant; second, that there was room to "discuss the weight"—that is to say, terms could be negotiated. Otherwise, this Head Constable would have long since turned up his nose, disclaimed all personal connection, and handled the affair by strict official protocol.

What occupied Li Rufeng's thoughts most urgently was precisely why Leng Ningyun had ventured beyond the city walls with only his personal attendants, without employing the escort agency's protection. Given Leng's personality and usual principles of conduct, this was profoundly unusual.

If they could determine why he had gone out, they would have a thread to follow in searching for him.

Unfortunately, both of Leng Ningyun's personal page boys had been killed. Although Wu Kaidi was a trusted confidant, his position ordinarily didn't grant him access to the inner quarters where he might have attended the Master directly. The only remaining sources of information were the two chamber maids who served in Leng Ningyun's private rooms.

Of these two maids, one was a Life Secretary assigned from Lingao, known as "Hexiang" at the Beijing Station. After arriving, she had also assumed the role of Leng's Confidential Secretary; all important documents passed through her hands. The other had been purchased locally after they reached the capital. Her name was rather common—"Yanhong"—and Leng Ningyun hadn't bothered to change it. Though this second maid was unaware of Leng Ningyun's true identity, she too had "received great grace" from him. Having undergone a thorough background investigation by Heliansheng, she had been confirmed as an ordinary girl of clean origins. There was nothing suspicious about her loyalty.

Nevertheless, these two women attended to Leng Ningyun in his daily life and should possess considerable knowledge of his affairs. Li Rufeng resolved that he should begin his inquiries with them.
