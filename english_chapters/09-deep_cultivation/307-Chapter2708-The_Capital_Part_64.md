# Chapter 2708: The Capital (Part 64)

The branches in the forest were uneven. Short weapons were agile, while thrusting with a long spear was cumbersome due to the inability to swing or maneuver easily.

Short spears were stiff. The key to applying force lay in the wrists. The arms pushed the wrists, the body aided the arms, and the legs braced the body—the whole body synthesized a single, unified force.

When double sabers engaged a spear, if one saber merely blocked while the other attacked, it was equivalent to using one arm's strength against the enemy's two arms and waist power. It wouldn't push the spear aside and would allow the spear to thrust through the center.

The spear shaft was long. After attacking, the enemy would retreat to maintain space.

To defeat long with short, one must risk danger. With decisive spirit, the saber must seek the spear, pressing forward relentlessly with no thought of retreat.

In spear techniques, "Center Level" (*Zhongping*) is king. The four-edged tip of the short spear thrust straight at the chest.

Liao Sanniang held her left saber vertically, blocking the short spear outward.

Her right saber performed a "wrapping head and coating brain" (*chantou guonao*) maneuver. However, the blade didn't actually coil around her head and neck; instead, she flipped her hand in front of her body, sweeping outward toward the spear shaft. Twisting her waist to generate power, both sabers combined force to block and trap the spear shaft.

With a *ka* sound, the two sabers knocked the spearhead aside. Seizing the opportunity, she rushed forward to press.

The enemy reacted extremely fast. As soon as the tip was deflected, he immediately circled it back. The spear shaft whipped back, slapping with a *pa* against Liao Sanniang's large left arm (upper arm).

A slap from the spear shaft couldn't cause injury.

By this time, Liao Sanniang had already slipped past the spearhead's striking range and intruded into the inner circle of the shaft. The short spear became useless.

Liao Sanniang's right hand held the saber with the edge facing up. Half-flipping her wrist, her right saber chopped at the enemy's left neck.

The saber was fast. The range of motion had to be small. There was no power in just placing the saber; lethality depended on dragging the edge back.

A slice of the blade—the cut went deep to the cervical vertebrae. The left jugular artery was severed. Blood sprayed like a fountain, instantly filling the air with a heavy metallic scent.

Two sabers to defend, one saber to advance.

In the space of a breath, two men were dead.

The battle turned. The third man, holding the Japanese saber, retreated but dared not expose his back to turn and run.

Liao Sanniang walked over leisurely, sabers hanging down. She looked at the opponent and tilted her chin provocatively.

The enemy opposite was covered in cold sweat. His legs trembled slightly; he dared not attack.

Liao Sanniang suddenly extended her left saber, touching the Japanese saber and pressing inward on the enemy's blade tip.

The enemy's nerves were highly sensitive. Under high tension, he used the spine of his saber to hook Liao Sanniang's left saber outward.

Liao Sanniang seized the centerline. Turning her body and stepping forward, her double sabers slid along the Japanese saber's blade, stabbing diagonally forward. The right saber pierced into the opponent's chest cavity, the tip twisting.

The enemy was timid, losing both strength and skill. It was effortlessly easy.

The corpse fell. Liao Sanniang shook her head in disappointment.

She counted silently: *Nine*.

The sound of a bowstring rang in her ears. A figure, pressured by Little Bazi's pellets, leaped out of the bushes and ran toward her.

Liao Sanniang looked toward the sound. It was the man who had spoken during the ambush earlier.

Seeing the ground covered in corpses, the man screamed involuntarily.

While he was dazed, Liao Sanniang flashed out from behind the tree and threw a dart with a flick of her hand. It hit his leg, and the man fell over.

Liao Sanniang approached. Her left saber slashed his ankle, and her right saber knocked the waist saber from his hand.

The man was terrified. Enduring the pain, he struggled to crawl up, knelt on both knees, and said with a trembling voice to Liao Sanniang, "Grandma spare my life, Grandma spare my life."

Behind her, Little Bazi appeared, slinging the slingshot diagonally across his back and drawing a sharp knife to stand by her side.

Liao Sanniang walked up to the bandit and said, "You have great skill, killing and rapping so many women."

The bandit kowtowed repeatedly, bruising his forehead. He pleaded tremblingly, "This small one dares not. This small one was originally a local hooligan who only joined this Greenwood group yesterday. I just wanted to scrounge some loose silver for spending money. So I pretended to be wicked, blowing hot air and bragging wildly. This small one is cowardly; let alone killing people, I don't even dare kill a chick." He continued kowtowing after speaking.

Liao Sanniang laughed. "Oh, so that's how it is. I didn't expect to find a vegetarian do-gooder among bandits."

The bandit nodded repeatedly, saying, "Yes, yes!"

The expression on Liao Sanniang's face suddenly became gentle. She said softly, "Good, I believe you."

After speaking, her double sabers suddenly patted the bandit's shoulders—left saber on the right shoulder, right saber on the left shoulder. The blades faced inward, crossing in an "X". She scissored the sabers, and his arms spread out in a "T" shape.

Both arteries on the sides of the bandit's neck were severed simultaneously. A sheet of blood red filled his vision, a mist of blood mixing with the fragmented backlighting into a dim gold. In his trance, a golden phoenix spread its wings before him, clad in armor, with quills of steel and feathers of iron.

She counted silently: *Ten*.

The kneeling corpse slumped forward.

Liao Sanniang turned. Crossing her double sabers in front of her chest, she flung her arms back. The blades shed the filthy blood, forming two parallel lines of blood on either side of her body.

Little Bazi walked to her side and said, "Adoptive Mother has good methods, truly a brave hero like in the legends."

Liao Sanniang smiled self-mockingly. In twenty knife fights, she was unscathed. Only six were true life-and-death struggles; the rest were either organized formation battles or relied on firearms, gathering everyone's fame onto herself.

Only she knew: she was strong because she relied on Qiwei and had Lingao at her back.

Old Manager Sun was old and shrewd. He saw that Lingao's political system was different and women's status would rise. He needed to win the support of female Senators, regardless of whether Qiwei remained a martial escort business in the future.

Qiwei disciples had already entered the Intelligence Bureau, but supporting the household required not just men, but also conspicuous women.

Du Wen needed a woman who could defeat men. Old Manager Sun needed a "Red Line Lady" (*Hongxian Nü*) who could steal the box for Qiwei. There was only one woman who walked the external escort routes; Liao Sanniang happened to be in the right place at the right time.

Lingao's political scene was full of undercurrents with unknown directions. A prominent woman would be swept into it involuntarily.

Many things couldn't be said or figured out.

Hearing Little Bazi's words, Liao Sanniang was moved. She glanced at Little Bazi and said, "Legend? Hero?"

Little Bazi raised both thumbs and praised, "Adoptive Mother is naturally a heroine."

Liao Sanniang smiled self-mockingly. "Yes. Lingao needs legends. Qiwei needs stories."

Saying this, she paused, then said indifferently, "Every story needs a hero."

On the main road, the Escort Bureau and the roving bandits engaged.

From the middle of the formation, Zhao Liangjian shouted, "Form the Mandarin Duck Formation (*Yuanyang Zhen*)!"

The ten guards of the Escort Bureau took a step back, raised their weapons, and arranged themselves into the Mandarin Duck Formation.

Escort convoys couldn't carry Wolf Brush spears (*langxian*). The Escort Bureau's Mandarin Duck Formation was simplified in both formation and weapon mix.

At the very front were two rattan shield bearers with waist sabers, providing cover for the long spearmen behind. If the spearmen went too deep or overextended, the shield bearers would immediately charge up to cover their withdrawal.

Behind the shield bearers were two Pear Flower Spears (*Lihua Qiang*), partially replacing the Wolf Brush. Three fire tubes were tied to the Pear Flower Spear. The fire tubes were like fireworks, spraying poisonous smoke and fire sand. Each tube could fire for several seconds. When one finished, the fuse automatically lit the next. They were designed to spray the eyes.

Pear Flower Spears lacked the branches of the Wolf Brush and couldn't block, isolate, or trap weapons, but they had blinding and shielding effects. They assisted the long spears in attacking, covered the shield bearers, and could also attack on their own.

Behind the Pear Flower Spears were four long spears, the main attackers, specializing in thrusting and protecting the Pear Flower Spears.

Bringing up the rear were two tridents (*chaba*), called "three-tine steel forks" in the North, used to parry long spears, sabers, and staffs.

The late Ming army's Mandarin Duck Formation added three-eyed guns or muskets, increasing lethality.

Old Feng hid in the formation, using a short gun to kill enemies. It was worth two three-eyed guns and had even greater power.

The remaining two men, one with a fork and one with a shield, sealed the rear of the formation to prevent enemies from circling behind.

The Mandarin Duck Formation formed a whole. The weapons mutually supported each other like the Five Elements, generating endlessly, compensating for weaknesses, and flowing ceaselessly.

At a local point, it formed a temporary advantage of numbers against few, killing quickly and disintegrating enemy morale.

The fire tubes of the two Pear Flower Spears ignited. The spears swept horizontally, spraying poisonous smoke and fine fire sand one meter in front of the spearheads, blocking the row of enemies in front.

Several bandits facing the Pear Flower Spears at close range got smoke and fire in their eyes. The stinging was unbearable; they coughed and wept, hacking at the fire tubes on the spears with their weapons.

Four long spears hid under the Pear Flower Spears, darting out in turn like snake tongues. A cluster of long spears thrust in and out, rising and falling, constantly rolling forward. With the extending and retracting of spears, three men were instantly stabbed down.

Some bandits realized and shouted loudly: "Run away, run away! Wait until their fire tubes run out, then fight up close!"

It was too late. The guards never protruded alone. Relying closely on each other, they advanced steadily.

Ten guards formed an efficient killing machine, ruthlessly harvesting the lives before them.

Covering each other, the guards bit into the bandit group, not letting them disengage. Following the wall of Pear Flower smoke and bathed in acrid gunpowder smoke, they crashed violently into Martial Yama's bandit squad, cutting the seemingly fierce bandit group in two at the waist. The enemy formation collapsed in the blink of an eye.

Japanese pirates (*Wokou*) were fierce and good at jumping. In battle, they wielded Japanese sabers and leaped about. When Ming troops faced them, their courage would be stolen by a single slash, instantly losing the will to fight. For combat agility, Wokou mostly wore infantry armor or no armor. The Mandarin Duck Formation was specifically designed to restrain highly skilled groups skirmishing. Common roving bandits had habits similar to Wokou—good at private fights but incapable of formation warfare. Organized beating unorganized, disciplined beating undisciplined, coordinated beating uncoordinated, trained beating untrained—it was invincible.

Martial Yama, seeing his team scattered from behind, was stunned. Moments later, he woke up and shouted loudly: "Archers! Shoot arrows, shoot arrows!"

Liu Chang, hidden behind the crowd, heard Martial Yama's shout. Following the direction of his cry, his gaze was electric. He saw the reflection of cold metal in the roadside bushes and realized archers were hiding behind the trees.

Liu Chang prepared before the enemy. Standing sideways facing the roadside, his right index finger and thumb formed a bird's beak, pecking into the quiver at his left waist. He caught an arrow, clamping the nock with two fingers and twisting the tip to align the nock.

The arrow shaft was inserted diagonally into the bow. His right hand pulled back, seating the nock groove onto the string, with the main fletching facing outward.

Moments later, two archers flashed out from behind the roadside trees. The distance wasn't far, about forty meters. The two archers drew their bows, aiming at the Escort Bureau crowd.

Among the eighteen martial arts, archery is supreme. In a shooter's eyes, there are only enemy shooters.

Liu Chang fixed his eyes on the two archers. With a few steps, he climbed onto the mule cart. His field of view opened up instantly, his shooting range exceeding everyone else's.

Liu Chang's leap to high ground involved large movements, attracting attention. An archer opposite spotted him, turned, and raised his bow to aim at Liu Chang.

Archers shooting at each other is like gambling with life.

In traditional archery, drawing the bow uses only the thumb—a "single finger hook." The thin bowstring creates pressure on the thumb and can slice the finger, so a thumb ring (*banzhi*) is needed to hook the string and protect the finger.

Liu Chang wore a slope-shaped thumb ring made of deer antler on his thumb.

Thumb ring, anciently called *She*, assists launching.

Liu Chang's index finger pressed over his thumb, clamping the arrow nock.

Both arms raised high, elbows above the head. Front hand pushing, rear hand pulling. Back muscles engaged. High lift, flat draw. Drawing the bow near full.
