# Chapter 2642: Storm over Xiaoyao Market (Part 2)

Saying, took out several coins from bosom.

Li Guangyuan took one. Only seeing this coin was a circle smaller than Yongle Tongbao. Weight also lighter some. Although entering hand silver shining heavy, but was not silver money—One Yuan, Half Yuan, Twenty Cents silver coins issued by Australians he all carefully played before. Entering hand size, texture and weight completely different.

Twisting up coin leaning close carefully sized up. One side of this coin convexly carved "One Wen" (*Yi Wen*) in Song typeface. Below surrounded by wheat ears and Tashik (Arabic) numerals and some Western Barbarian characters; Other side used large size Tashik number carved "1" character style. Background was a pointed head big boat. Not asking knowing, this was Kun Thieves' Big Iron Ship.

Senate earlier issued Yuan and Fen. One Yuan exchanged one hundred Fen. However in actual usage, Fen currency's face value was still too large. So on market still used various bronze coins remaining in society for small amount transactions, even moving together to buy sell goods. Bronze coins popular on market had very many types. Weight quality not uniform. So exchange rate between bronze coin and Fen currency was not fixed. Some places recognized five Wen money as one Fen, some places ten Wen, some places sixteen Wen. These all brought inconvenience to Senate internal economic activities, commodity circulation. Also affected Senate recycling copper resources in bronze coins. So below Fen currency continuing to issue subsidiary currency with smaller face value was put on highest order of currency issuance very fast.

Unit of subsidiary currency was positioned "Wen," to cater to common people's usage habit and oral address. However specifically adopting what as Wen currency, everyone made difficulty. Ordinary bronze coin was absolutely no go. Since Senate landed always lacked copper. Through trade to Japan and mining, had certain relief, but copper price still stood high. Issuing bronze coin basically couldn't collect Seigniorage, even possibly melted privately by people to pull Senate's sheep wool.

Issuing steel coin naturally was optimal solution. But Senate didn't have ability of producing stainless steel. If using carbon steel to make, very fast would be corroded in circulation, severely harming seriousness of legal currency.

As for using Nickel coin—this was also most common metal material for small amount subsidiary currency in Old Time Space. Unluckily this kind of cheap non-ferrous metal was scarce material to Senate. Corresponding still had Aluminum coin.

Final compromise was issuing paper money. Anyway current Yuan and Fen all issued paper money. From acceptance degree and liquidity speaking counted as acceptable. Therefore Wen from beginning appeared as full paper money. Exchange rate was one Fen exchanging ten Wen.

Li and Luo two people towards Kun Thieves' Fen and Wen paper money already practiced to be common. At this moment suddenly appeared hard coin, naturally somewhat surprised.

This actually wanted to look carefully. Li Guangyuan thought in heart.

Looking from texture entering hand, this new "Wen" adhered to characteristics of Australian Silver Dollar. Material smooth clean. Pattern exquisite. Outer rim like hard coin (coin) had convex loop (*bian*), very exquisite. Just didn't have fine dense carved lines (milled edge) like silver dollar. But leaning against light looking carefully, on convex loop actually had Foreign characters fine like mosquito gnat. Truly didn't know how carved up.

"This is One Wen money?!" Luo Heying was somewhat hard to believe. Although certain material of this coin was neither silver nor copper, but such exquisite casting work was already price not cheap. Actually was only smallest One Wen money?!

Li Guangyuan said: "Sheared open to look color or not?"

"Indeed is One Wen money." Apprentice said, "Shopkeeper took clip shear to shear, couldn't shear open. Filed a bit again. Outside silver shining this layer is wrapped up—don't know used what method. Inside is iron core."

"Iron money!" Luo Heying sneered, "Since ancient times where had Court issuing iron money!"

This words not false. Starting from Qin Shi Huang casting Half Tael (*Ban Liang*), China's cast currency was always copper coin. Just following rise and fall of dynasty, copper component had more had less, size weight had big had small merely. Besides Tang Dynasty's Fanzhen (feudal town) and some local regimes, never had formally casting iron money.

Seeing Kun Thieves started casting iron money, Luo Heying was somewhat excited. In his view this was sign of Kun Thieves "Treasury Depot Deficient," starting to walk onto dead end road of poor path.

But Li Guangyuan knew this had no significance. Because Australians now all face values had paper money, and passed through unimpeeded in Two Guangs. Merchant travelers common people all recognized. Using what material to cast coin actually no harm to elegance.

Li Guangyuan and Luo Heying didn't know, "One Wen" held in their hands was first batch small face value hard coin subsidiary currency manufactured by Hong Kong Mint. Just sent from Guangzhou's Central Reserve Bank to Dongguan, starting circulation. This hard coin was still brand new brand new.

Manufacturing subsidiary currency hard coin was not sudden whim, but improvement compelled to do for improving currency circulation.

Paper money admittedly printing, using and transporting storing were very convenient. But result of actual application was Senators of Finance and Financial Mouths all had quite some complaints. Indeed currently basically various levels currency all issued corresponding paper money, and circulation also counted as normal. But malady exposed inside was growing with days.

Yuan Coin, Half Yuan were smallest problem. Because these paper monies basically only passed in Guangzhou and Hainan. People of outside places usually rarely used such big face value money. Also had no confidence to take it to hoard save, putting body family life on a piece of paper.

And Guangzhou and Hainan, Senate's policy promotion was deepest. From ninety years old old man to yellow mouth small child, all heard lecture on preventing fake currency, saw propaganda poster of currency anti-counterfeiting. True note also saw not once. Even if imitator had capability as big as sky, also couldn't achieve same touch same look as true note.

Therefore even if appeared fake currency cases for several times, in Guangzhou and Hainan didn't happen large scale circulation.

Simultaneously, people using large amount currency also cherished. Money all put in specialized wallet. Light take light put. Circulated for many rounds still same as new one.

But small amount currency problem was big. Especially Fen currency and Wen currency. On one hand, Senate out of cost, on small amount currency didn't make exquisite anti-counterfeiting means. Always adopted special paper and steel plate printing anti-counterfeiting. Consequence of this was in Guangzhou surrounding area happened cases of altering currency many times: Technology of steel plate printing was not hard to grasp. Fake currency traffickers could carve tin plate. Also would think method to wash away face value printed on small amount paper money. Then used tin plate or copper plate to print on new face value pattern. Also had using Grain Circulation Coupons already exited circulation to forge. Although fake currency forged like this comparing with true currency carefully examining very easy to discover wrong, but towards group with anti-counterfeiting notion not strong had huge deceiving nature. This kind of altered fake currency solemnly already became mainstream.

Another problem was damage of small amount paper money was too serious.

In Tax Bureau, Delong Bank's basic level, all appeared window staff, unable to endure, taking out a stack of broken broken rotten rotten papers, complaining to superior situation. Several thousand pieces of One Fen paper money wrinkled like toilet paper, needed every piece carefully spread flat, distinguish true fake, count clear quantity. To people on window was greatest torture.

And these departments, often after closing door still needed to recount once.

Basic level banks where small amount paper money prevailed, when business volume big, frequently appeared exchanging lining up long queue. Clearing work also wanted to overtime to deep night situation.

Later passing calculation, circulation of One Wen paper money not exceeding 30 times needed recycling. But circulation cost far higher than Ten Fen hard coin of silver copper alloy.

Therefore, Wudaokou (PBC) Senators originally counting on paper money to pull Seigniorage, always wanted to promote hard coinization of small amount currency.

Passing simple combing and discussion with Industrial Mouth, final set plan was issuing four kinds silver coins, i.e. One Yuan, Half Yuan, Twenty Fen and Ten Fen. Latter two adopted silver copper alloy. Simultaneously correspondingly issuing four kinds face value silver coin exchange coupons.

Separately issuing Five Fen and One Fen two kinds Fen currency. Similarly was hard coin and paper money equal amount circulation. Taking hard coin as main. One Fen hard coin material adopted Zinc Alloy Copper Plated hard coin. This plan in Old Time Space was widely used on small amount hard coin, such as famous Lincoln Head One Cent.

Smelting history of elemental Zinc was not long. Ming Dynasty Late Period only successfully refined elemental zinc. And previous zinc was all brass obtained by smelting together with copper ore. Therefore in Ming Dynasty zinc was still belonging to high price metal same as tin. Could support its Fen currency face value.

Zinc in Senate's metal inventory was not deficient. After taking down Guangdong extended its source in large scale. Using to make secondary subsidiary currency roughly enough to use.

But material of Five Fen let everyone make difficulty. A Five Fen wanted to equal five One Fen. Merely enlarging money size slightly, changing a pattern was no go. Must have obvious distinction with One Fen, to support its face value, increasing folks' acceptance degree. Simultaneously increasing forging difficulty—these hard coins similarly wanted to circulate to countryside without anti-counterfeiting notion in large quantity.

Mint's design was adopting Bi-metallic Currency. This kind of Bi-metallic Currency, ancient times many countries governments tried to use. Result was manufacturing craft too difficult. Until 20th century only successfully used on circulation currency. Therefore Senators had full confidence on its anti-counterfeiting performance.

Initial plan was hard coin of purple copper (pure copper) inner core, brass ring. But result was inner core too soft. Easy to combine with outer ring not tight falling off. And purple copper and brass before corrosion color difference too small. Not beneficial to distinguish with fake currency.

Later improved plan was brass covering white copper (cupronickel) or silver copper as inner core. Brass as outer ring. This plan inner outer ring combined well. Inner core had beautiful silver color luster.

Biggest shortcoming of this plan was needing Nickel. And Senate right now only controlled a few small nickel mines in Guangxi. I.e. haven't able to large scale exploit. Nickel's industrial demand still very big. Causing nickel price under Senate rule higher than silver price. White copper price also slightly higher than s800 silver used for jewelry. But considering trouble of changing currency, and large scale nickel mine development about to start, finally still adopted brass covering white copper inner core plan. Since raw material insufficient, temporarily only make small amount issuance. Mainly issuing One Fen coin.

As for Wen currency all adopted hard coin. Original paper money after recycling gradually eliminated. It only had one kind face value: One Wen.

Material of this subsidiary currency, Senate had strange thoughts wonderful ideas including glass coin, ceramic coin, bamboo stick coin etc. But final discussion result was still issuing Iron Coin. Main material was wrought iron. After pressing into exquisite hard coin then hot dip galvanizing. Not only could prevent corrosion, moreover could endow currency with silver light shining luster.
