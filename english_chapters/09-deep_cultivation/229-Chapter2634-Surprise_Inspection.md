# Chapter 2634: Surprise Inspection

Coming out from Patriarch's home, Guan Youde who knelt for two hours (*one shichen*) already couldn't bear it somewhat. He didn't understand he was like this for so many years; why Patriarch would get angry today. Complained to Guan Richang again: "Branch Head, why you make big topic on small work. Whose family doesn't have a difficult scripture to read?"

Guan Richang was also angry, casually gave Guan Youde a slap, scolding: "Still don't know repentance right?"

Guan Youde covered face, gloomy saying nothing.

Guan Richang said: "Quickly go find your wife, advise with good words. If can avoid entering Public Court, henceforth you live days with her well, don't generate incident again. If entering Public Court, you wait to be removed name from Clan Register."

After Mo Yu got Zhang Xiao's instruction, first arranged several Tanka boys to monitor every move of Qiaonan Village secretly. Found every few days ships transporting Silkworm Feces entered, but already reduced significantly compared to previous days. Every day also small amount of ships transporting things out. Inspected a few times, only found some manure soil similar to farmyard manure. Said to be remaining medicine dregs after refining this year's patent medicine almost finished.

Only gain was confirming position of Zhu clan's patent medicine refining workshop. Seeing no clue, Qiaonan Village was water splashing not enter (impenetrable) again. Mo Yu decided to take two Resident Police to walk a trip personally.

Local large village stronghold patterns all had obvious military defense functions. Outside village mostly utilized fish ponds and natural river ponds to form water channels similar to moat. Village periphery buildings uniformly opened doors and windows towards inside. Between buildings utilized terrain to build enclosing walls, fences, arrow towers and other facilities. Roads entering and exiting village also only had a few fixed entrances and exits. Closed at night, people responsible for guarding at day.

Mo Yu and Le Ziren could only enter from village entrance. Don't know coincidence or arranged early, when arriving at village entrance, Mo Yu met Zhu clan's Old Butler.

Zhu Butler seeing Mo Yu, asked greetingly with smile: "Master Mo, truly rare guest ah. What wind blew your old man here today?"

Mo Yu looked east looked west a circle, said: "Nothing, nothing. I just turn around everywhere. These days Chief Zhang goes down to countryside to experience people's feelings. Must earn a earn performance, avoiding being scolded by Chief."

Zhu Butler smiled understandingly, "Master Mo what words. With Master sitting in this township, those demons and monsters ran no shadow long ago."

Mo Yu said casually: "Coming all came, Zhu Butler doesn't invite me inside to sit sit?"

Zhu Butler stunned, immediately said: "Aiyo, look at me this old muddle. Master Mo please inside. I arrange down immediately."

Not walking to Zhu Residence yet, Le Ziren smelled bursts of foul smell coming from air, couldn't help covering nose with hand. Zhu Butler seeing situation, said smilingly: "Several Masters don't mind. Countryside place, taking fish mulberry as profession, manure fertilizer used much. Stink is a bit stinky, yet is what we these farming households like most."

Mo Yu said instead: "No harm. Our newly appointed Chief Zhang manages finely. How Fish Flower fished, how fish fry raised, where fertilizer come from, all want to ask. These days my pressure mountain big. Zhu Butler might as well take me to see, tell us how to compost, also let Chief Zhang know I wait (we) serve Senate with all heart."

Zhu Butler somewhat compelled, said: "That kind of filthy place, fear obstructing Master's eyes. If known by my Master, definitely punish me. Master Mo better follow me to main hall to sit sit, taste top quality Limu Mountain Oolong Tea."

Mo Yu insisted on going to see. Zhu Butler had to take them to a composting place. Indeed was place farmyard composting, no abnormality. Immediately Mo Yu asked some composting details again. Zhu Butler also answered one by one.

Le Ziren knew where workshop position was. Just here could see workshop roof from afar. Pointed to distance asking: "Zhu Butler, what does that side do? Why also peculiar smell coming. Looking not like composting place."

Zhu Butler heart tightened, on surface still calm and self-possessed, said: "That is my Master's newly opened Patent Medicine Workshop."

"Patent Medicine?" Mo Yu asking pretending curiosity.

Zhu Butler could only continue answering: "My Sixth Master got a medicine formula from a high person some years ago. He saw fellow villager Chen Tiquan, Li Shengzuo joint operating Chen Li Ji Hall making medicine to save people, deeply loved by villagers. Momentary whim rose heart of hanging pot to help world (*Huan Hu Ji Shi* - practicing medicine). So made this formula into Patent Medicine. Also counts as accumulating virtue for children and grandchildren descendants."

"Oh, Patent Medicine ah," Mo Yu nodded, said: "Our Chief Zhang proficient in art of making medicine, people call 'Pharmacist.' We few just worry not knowing how to throw Chief's favor. Zhu Butler explain one or two for us. We report in detail going back. Chief happy, brothers' future expectable, definitely won't forget Zhu Butler's benefit."

Zhu Butler look of quite difficult to handle, "Several Masters, this truly embarrasses small one. Every family's unique skill always not transmitted outside. If leaking Patent Medicine making method because of this, small one can't bear ah."

Le Ziren said: "Healer Benevolent Heart. Since for hanging pot to help world, people knowing making this Patent Medicine aren't the more the better? If your Master blames you because of this, I see he is just a hypocrite fishing for fame and hook for praise. You better leave early, find another good master better."

"Zhu Butler don't blame. This brother of mine is a rough person, heart straight mouth fast. Don't take his words to heart." Mo Yu sang Red Face (Good Cop), "You also know, we are all big old roughs. Don't know a few bowl-mouth big characters. Can't eat this bowl of fine work rice of your Master. Just our this new Magistrate handles everything personally. Sesame big matters all want to ask. These days truly feel pressure doubled. Brothers have to take out some dry goods (real stuff) to cope over."

Le Ziren said again: "Zhu Butler decline like this, could it be having something not seeable to people." Saying walked straight towards workshop.

Zhu Butler wanted to block but didn't dare to move hand really. Only blocking in front of everyone, walking backwards following their steps on one side, persuading loudly on one side. Attracting other Zhu clan children, surrounding several people roundly. Seeing conflict about to rise, behind crowd came Zhu Shilian's voice: "Who makes noise here?"

"Sixth Master, a misunderstanding," Zhu Butler walked to Zhu Shilian's side, said respectfully: "Master Mo of Market Police Station visits today, wants to go to Patent Medicine Workshop to look. Small one dare not make decision, therefore annoyed several Masters. Small one willing to receive punishment."

Zhu Shilian said: "So it is such small matter. Should punish. Deduct ten fen money from this month monthly money. All descend."

After Zhu Butler left, crowd gathering around also scattered. Zhu Shilian smiled to Mo Yu saying: "Master Mo has such elegant interest. Shilian accompanies personally is it good?"

Walking into workshop, Zhu Shilian started introducing uses of various utensils, how to input material, how to process, until how to pack into finished product. Environment still a smell of fecal stink. Seeing policemen face having difficult color, Zhu Shilian explained: "This medicine of mine, is extracted from Silkworm Feces. Processing inevitable some smell. But medicine is excellent. Can cure Qi Blood both deficiency, dizziness tinnitus, palpitation short breath, spirit weary fatigue. Gentlemen wind dining dew sleeping, working hard day and night, inevitable Qi Blood not flourishing. Later I let Butler gift a few boxes of Patent Medicine to Gentlemen, chatting to express heart intent."

Although Mo Yu was retired Fubo Army Navy, after all just Tanka origin. Didn't have high knowledge as young soldiers receiving formal education later. He learned steam engine operation slightly in Navy, had a little impression on mechanical operation, but towards slightly advanced Enthalpy Value, Entropy Value already like Heavenly Book. Electricity, Engineering Mechanics etc. were regarded by him as god-like knowledge; only Senators had qualification to master. Towards Chemical Industry was even a blank sheet. Don't mention what Raw Medicine Patent Medicine.

Seeing Zhu Shilian took them to visit workshop actively, didn't hide or conceal, and couldn't see any doorway (trick), Mo Yu praised a few sentences casually then said sorry to disturb. When returning to village entrance Zhu Butler really gave a few boxes of Patent Medicine each person.

"Sixth Master, didn't get looked out anything right?" Looking at receding figures of several False Kuns, Zhu Butler asked Zhu Shilian.

"You did very well. Didn't let them pass just now," Zhu Shilian breathed a sigh of relief, "Fortunately Brother Shimin moved fast. Only difference a little bit."

Inside Marching Camp outside Jiujiang Great Market, Zhang Jiayu was leading Huang *Shi* to write complaint paper. He volunteered to write for Huang *Shi* today. A hand of Pin-Flower Small Kai Script (*Zan Hua Xiao Kai*) written very beautiful, making Zhao Hening drool straightly. Huang Xiyin with extremely high calligraphy attainment also praised ceaselessly. Complaint paper finished writing, Huang *Shi* pressed a hand print on it.

"Lord, if he is not willing to divorce, what do folk woman do?" Huang *Shi* asked worriedly.

Yuchi Gang quick person quick words, said: "If he has domestic violence, fault, causing you two husband wife emotion broken, unable to live together, and unable to mediate, reasonably should sentence divorce."

Huang *Shi* hesitated somewhat, said: "Others I don't worry. Just his body of illness, divorcing fear suffering people gossip. Clan Elders in clan also may not necessarily agree."

At this time, another voice came: "This Big Sister, what you said are all things of moral level. You feel he will live difficultly after leaving you, so you sympathize with him. This is your personal moral emotion. *Marriage Law* implemented by Senate, its substance is equivalent to Contract Law. Contract, is agreement, understand? Stressing concluding both sides equal, voluntary, and legal. Marriage and *Marriage Law* are two matters. What does *Marriage Law* protect? Using specialized words to speak—legal rights and interests formed because of marriage relationship. Removing unnecessary modification, remaining key point is rights and interests, that is benefits."
