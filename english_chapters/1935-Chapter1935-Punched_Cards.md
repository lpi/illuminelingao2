## Chapter 1935 - Punched Cards

The dispute between Quweima and standard telegraph code lasted for a short while. Finally, Quweima won the tentative approval of the majority of participants because it directly linked with the future GB code for Chinese characters in electronic computers.

"Agriculture wants to control land, Industry wants to control technology, Finance wants to control currency, Military/Admin wants to control seats. When it comes to our IT circle, we must control standards, ah standards." Feng Nuo smiled mysteriously, thinking secretly.

What the Administration Council wanted to control was big data. Feng Nuo knew very well the significance of statistics to the Administration Council. Without figures, all administrative measures were trees without roots, water without specific sources. The Senate's Administration Council system had a huge demand for data collection and organization, and many venues needed to be rolled out.

"If we use a 4-digit numeric code for 1 Chinese character, each punched card can store 20 Chinese characters." The encoding scheme itself and the representation of the encoding on the punched card were actually two issues. If viewed from the binary perspective of punched or not, each column actually had 12 bits, one and a half bytes of information. Enough to encode more than 4000 characters.

"That's too few. It seems even less than the information content of 80 English letters. It takes 7 cards to post a Weibo tweet, not counting punctuation," someone commented.

"A 4-digit Chinese encoding can be represented by two columns in practice, only the difficulty of mechanical design will increase. Please check Appendix 3 for the specific scheme."

It turned out Feng Nuo's idea was to punch 3 holes per column to represent two digits, where punching two holes in the 0-9 positions of each column represented two digits. Punching in Row 11 of the High Zone indicated the two digits punched below were arranged from small to large; punching in Row 12 indicated the two digits punched below were arranged from large to small.

"What if the two digits are the same?"

" Punch rows 11 and 12 simultaneously, and punch only 1 hole in 0-9. Explanation on the next page."

However, although the 3-hole method could reduce the length of Chinese encoding by half, allowing one card to store up to 40 Chinese characters, obviously neither electromechanical system nor control system design could be done in a day. After much discussion, the meeting decided that the card design for this census would adopt 4-digit numeric coding for Chinese characters. After all, European and American names also easily ran to a dozen letters; comparatively, Chinese names weren't that long.

Feng Nuo then briefly introduced some content in the materials and finally said specifically: "We did this work in a rush, and some data might not be thoroughly researched. We will continue to perfect it later. Governor... Secretary Ma has researched mechanical computers for a long time and very deeply; we hope he can give us some guidance on direction and supplements on details."

Ma Qianzhu smiled and said, "I decided today to bring only my ears. But since your discussion is so lively, I'll say two words as an enthusiast. Your work is very sufficient and meticulous. I only raise two points. One is the manufacturing of electromechanical equipment; is there assurance for relay development? Work should go from easy to hard, urgent to gradual. For the census, what is most urgent? Punching machines—mass-producible, reliable, portable, durable punching machines. And the punching machine is the most basic and simplest equipment in the punched card machine system. It is also the easiest to design and manufacture. The survey takes time; subsequent equipment can be developed and manufactured synchronously. When the survey is done and cards are collected, waiting a bit is acceptable. Better to let data wait for machines than machines wait for data. That's the first point."

"The second point is the cards. I think precision requirements should still conform to the status quo of our productivity. I suggest you invite comrades from the paper mill and printing plant to discuss together. Delong is printing banknotes now; their experience should also be heard. What is the card standard that is mature in technology, capable of stable mass production, and acceptable in cost at this stage? Being a bit slow or rough at the start doesn't matter. Once there's a prototype system, later things will be easier to handle..."

"I can supplement regarding 1890 punching card technology. I looked up some materials before. The 1890 US census also used 80-column cards, but round holes were punched then, and card dimensions were different from the IBM card we talk about now. The punching equipment was extremely simple, almost like the ticket punchers we used to take trains with—manual punching, without the function of printing corresponding values. The error rate and skew rate were as high as 1/20. The sorters and tabulators of the same period presumably weren't very precise either. Yet with such crude machine equipment levels, statistical efficiency was still hundreds or thousands of times higher than the 1880 census. We can completely surpass such a level."

"Industrialization isn't achieved overnight, nor does the tech tree grow a single branch; all points must advance side by side. The hand-cranked calculator project exposed many of our shortcomings in mechanical manufacturing and drove the leap of some of our technologies; punched card computers involve all aspects of industrial technology of the pre-digital age and will also encounter various problems. Conquering these difficulties one by one will mark our industrialization level stepping up another new level."

...

Feng Nuo nodded while taking notes. Although these instructions had little technical effect, he could write a news article to send to the *Lingao Times* to fully reflect "leader's attention"—things would be much easier to handle.

Ultimately, the punch scheme was determined to be a fully mechanical structure. Since Feng Nuo's proposed 3-hole double-column Chinese encoding scheme was temporarily postponed, the punch could now completely imitate the 1923 IBM-011 numeric keypunch. This model was suitable for 45-column cards in the early days. After the 80-column standard IBM card was determined in 1929, it was redesigned to a scheme adaptable to standard IBM cards. This model had no English letter punching; it was a purely numeric punch. It had 14 keys: 0-9, X, Y, S, R. 12 keys punched in rows 0-9, 11 (X), 12 (Y) respectively. S was for Space (no punch), R for Release (end punching).

The IBM-011 was small in volume and easy to implement structurally, sufficient for the current census needs. The only regret was the lack of a physical object to copy. Feng Nuo rummaged through the Data Center to find some technical parameters and a few blurry photos. Fortunately, the principle was relatively clear. Elders in the mechanical sector learned from the typewriter project team a few times, and finally, the blueprints were settled.

After the project passed, Feng Nuo temporarily had no specific work. He was responsible for the technical route and standards, but implementation into manufacturing was the Mechanical Sector's business. The Mechanical Sector had already written a long memorandum listing technical difficulties needing to be "tackled" and various material and process issues needing support. Feng Nuo received a copy of this memo, but he couldn't understand most of it, so he put it aside for now.

"There's nothing I can interfere with next, but I still have to keep a close eye on this project. This is the key work for my transformation."

He patrolled the computer room once again. After confirming everything was normal, he decided to walk to the front—he hadn't been to Xu Yicheng's place for a long time. Speaking of which, this project also had a great relationship with him.

Xu Yicheng and Feng Nuo's relationship was administratively that of superior and subordinate, overall charge versus specific charge. In terms of computers, it was the relationship between peripherals and CPU; translated to the human body, it was the relationship between the brain and the eyes/arms. For most Elders and naturalized cadres who frequently came to the Computing and Data Center for official business, Feng Nuo was almost non-existent; Xu Yicheng was the symbol of the Computing and Data Center.

Of course, this might not be bad for Feng Nuo, who was exhausted by repairing computers and maintaining the server room. After all, Xu Laowu took care of all miscellaneous matters; he only had to be responsible for technical issues.

He wanted to call Feng Shan to bring the "memorandum" he placed on the desk—this was the report he had to submit every week, covering status, problems, and improvement measures. This was important evidence for Xu Laowu to battle at the Planning Commission.

After shouting a few times with no answer, he remembered she had gone to find several naturalized technicians for a "project coordination meeting" today. Because she ran to the Mechanical Sector with Feng Nuo frequently some time ago, Feng Shan ultimately didn't choose a basic science topic like Zhong Xiaoying but selected a topic on alloy thermal processing properties, reported it, and got approval.

Feng Nuo looked at the operation of the computer room through the glass again, checked the temperature and humidity records, then checked the backup power room—Lingao's self-produced UPS had huge battery dimensions but tiny capacity. To ensure the stable operation of two backup power systems, they had to be given a dedicated room each, enjoying the same treatment as servers.

Today all indices were within normal range. Computer room equipment was also normal; no abnormal sounds except the monotonous and steady hum of fans.

He told the other part-time Elder on rotation to watch the computer room a few points of attention, then walked outside himself.

Opening the first sealed door of the computer room, he changed out of his anti-static work clothes and shoes in the changing room, put on ordinary Elder uniform, then opened the second sealed door and entered the passage to the outside world.

He received a call from the printing plant early in the morning, notifying him to attend the discussion meeting on punched card printing technology improvement. The printing precision of numbers on punched cards had always been less than ideal, only passable, while using banknote printing technology was too costly. It was said there was a breakthrough this time.

"Once the card hurdle is passed, the census can finally start from June. This project can be considered to have shown initial results, making it easier to continue fishing for projects later. Although I'm just an ungraduated PhD, my former boss's move works every time." He breathed a sigh of relief, thinking somewhat shrewdly.

Although Feng Nuo's surname was also Feng in the old timeline, he wasn't called Feng Nuo. walking, he suddenly remembered that when he signed up for the crossing, he gave this name thinking that in the new timeline, even if he couldn't compare to Von Neumann, he should at least reach half his level.

He opened the door leading to the outside.

This is just the beginning, he thought, feeling the morning sun a bit dazzling.
