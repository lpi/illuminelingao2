# Chapter 646 The First Day's Victory

Wang Xi and Li Guang's men and horses also routed subsequently. Li Guang's personal soldiers were all killed, and even the big flag was almost lost. He himself was hit by a bullet and was rescued with great difficulty. Wang Xi was killed in action while commanding men and horses to cross the trench.

He Rubin watched the men and horses rolling and surging under the earthen dike, constantly attacking up the dike and constantly being forced down, feeling secretly anxious. At this time, he saw the Training Guerrilla's men and horses sent as follow-up reinforcements retreating one after another. He couldn't help but fly into a rage. Just as he was about to order drums to urge the attack, he saw the men and horses who had already attacked to the edge of the trench were also retreating. In an instant, the four or five thousand men and horses on the battlefield scattered completely like an avalanche; the ground was full of routed soldiers throwing away helmets and armor.

"Should we let the ambush troops move out?"

"No, the enemy's capital hasn't been used up yet. He Rubin's own Regional Commander's Standard and house guards haven't moved out." He Ming looked at the situation on the battlefield. "Tomorrow He Rubin will have to use his bottom dollar. We rely on the position to thoroughly cripple them, and then defeat the enemy in one drum beat when they are disheartened and see enemies in every bush!"

On the Chengmai city wall, receiving the news that Guangdong Training Guerrilla Wang Xi and Governor's Standard Guerrilla Wang Daoji were killed in action successively, the atmosphere among the observing officials and generals dropped to the freezing point. The optimistic atmosphere was swept away: just today, two regular military officers of Guangdong were killed in action, and other military officers of Chiliarch rank and above killed reached more than twenty. Such heavy losses were enough to meet the standard of a "disastrous defeat."

He Rubin was covered in cold sweat. With such heavy losses, if he couldn't completely exterminate the Hair Bandits, it would be difficult for him to account to the Viceroy and the Imperial Court. He ordered: "Beat drums!" He decided to commit his own Regional Commander's Standard and house guards this time to break the enemy stockade in one fell swoop.

It was Zhao Ruyi who stopped him: "Our army has suffered a setback; morale has declined today. Attacking again would only injure soldiers in vain. General must not act on a moment of anger. Fortunately, our army's vitality is still there. Withdraw troops for now and fight again tomorrow."

The retreat gong sounded over the entire battlefield—actually, even without the gong, the government army's offensive had already collapsed. The Fubo Army gradually stopped firing after large groups of government troops routed. Those officers and soldiers who were wounded but could still walk limped and fled back.

Smoke gradually dispersed from the battlefield. Only at this time could both sides clearly see the result of this slaughter lasting nearly 3 hours. Inside and outside the trench were filled with corpses everywhere. The corpses under the earthen dike were especially dense; in some places, they were piled up more than half a man's height. On the earthen dike, and even on the slope of the dike, corpses hung everywhere. Blood flowed gurgling down along the earthen dike like black creeks.

A strong smell of blood, sweat, and gunpowder smoke shrouded the battlefield, making people nauseous.

The Fubo Army infantry and militia, each with tattered clothes, faces and bodies covered in smoke and dust, some even wounded. They supported their bodies with rifles. Those who lost rifles carried government soldiers' long spears and big sabers picked up, looking at the fleeing government soldiers with dull expressions as if they had just had a dream.

Seeing the Ming army withdraw, retreating team by team into their camp, the Fubo Army soldiers who just came to their senses burst out in waves of victory cheers—they had defeated the fierce attack of four or five thousand elite government soldiers and stood tall. Cheers were transmitted wave after wave along the earthen dike, resounding over the entire battlefield.

Compared to the native officers and soldiers, the emotionally rich Senator officers almost wept with joy—this army they built with their own hands and trained bitterly for two years finally showed that they were a true combat-capable army, not just a team marching in neat columns on the parade ground. He Ming noticed several Senator officers were wiping their eyes and couldn't help laughing:

"What? Everyone wants to cry? Like women!"

"I am... happy..." Wei Aiwen always presented himself as a German-style iron-blooded tough guy, but at this moment he couldn't help wiping his eyes too, "Our army... finally succeeded! We won't lose! We won!"

"Little Wei, what 'Triumph of the Will' do you blow about all day? Still shedding cat pee now." You Laohu carried the blood-stained Frontier Army Long Saber, saying triumphantly. He was covered in blood everywhere, even on his face, but he didn't wipe it at all, seeming to show off his reckless close-quarters combat. "Look at me, I chopped off a dozen heads in one breath..."

Just as he finished this sentence, he suddenly fell to the ground. People present were all startled. The accompanying doctor Zhang Tumu hurriedly checked his condition.

"No big problem, wound blood loss plus exhaustion." Saying so, he opened his portable medical kit and gave You Laohu an injection. "Carry him to the Health Station!"

"Old You is really fierce..."

"Being fierce like this, sooner or later he'll pay with his little life." Zhang Tumu said, "Covered in wounds. Not deep, but losing too much blood will still cost a life."

Dongmen Chuiyu said: "This way You Laohu won't be able to participate in combat tomorrow. Have to appoint an Acting Commander for the 3rd Battalion quickly."

"Let Lin Shenhe act. He performed quite well today." Dongmen Chuiyu said, "He mentioned to me several times, wanting to transfer his relation to the army instead of being an ordnance engineer all day. I think it's okay. Isn't he very familiar with this line infantry shooting stuff?"

"No, he's not familiar with the 3rd Battalion." He Ming considered, "Yu Zhiqian will be Acting Commander of the 3rd Battalion. Lin Shenhe will fill his Company Commander position first. Re-adjust after the war. This battle is almost fought; the outcome will be seen tomorrow."

Although the Ming army still had large numbers of men and horses, He Ming knew the enemy's morale had declined. Even if He Rubin used his house guards and Regional Commander's Standard tomorrow, it was unlikely to be as fierce as today—the key was that his own soldiers already had the conviction of inevitable victory. They would fight even more bravely in the impending decisive battle.

The snipers on the towers all came down. They played a huge role in the chaotic battle, not only killing many officers, disrupting the organization of the government army's attack more than once, but also directly using rifles to seal breaches at the most critical moments. At this moment, their faces were covered in smoke, fingers swollen, and some had bleeding hands. But everyone was high-spirited, carrying pockets filled with large handfuls of bullet casings, cheerfully discussing their combat achievements.

"I took out at least three officers! And that general!"

"That general was clearly hit by me! At least a Regional Commander!"

"Bullshit! There's only one Regional Commander. The one you hit was at most a Squad Leader."

...

The total score of the Senator Sniper Team was 247 kills, a quite impressive result. But just as Zhou Weisen said, the enemies were densely crowded together; it was hard to miss. He claimed to have shot a general at 1000 meters, but Qian Shuiting insisted he hit him. The two had a fierce argument.

Qian Shuiting's total kills were 14, but his records were the most detailed, with various symbols like bows, spears, three-eyed guns, army flags, helmets, etc., on paper to represent the target types killed. Zhou Weisen laughed at him for taking too long to draw pictures, resulting in less time firing guns.

Dingding crawled out of a gun emplacement—today he thought he fully understood what "narrow escape" meant. Decades later, he would often show off his bravery that day to a certain grandson whose name he couldn't call: how the enemy charged at him, he kept filming until the enemy rushed to one meter in front of him without moving; he killed seven or eight government soldiers with the camera tripod alone; he singled out a government general and knocked him down, the opponent saying "I submit" before dying, etc.

In fact, Dingding's situation was indeed very dangerous. He was originally filming on the command platform. After the first attack ended, in order to get better and more intuitive footage, he handed the professional camera to his assistant, took a DV onto the earthen dike himself, filmed on a sentry tower for a while, then entered a gun emplacement used by snipers. He originally thought the government soldiers would collapse directly under the earthen dike like the first attack. He didn't expect the enemy to rush up. At the most intense moment, government soldiers and Fubo Army infantry engaged in hand-to-hand combat right outside the gun emplacement. Government soldiers tried to break into the emplacement he was filming in several times, but were driven out by the soldiers protecting him with bayonets.

Until the enemy fully retreated, Dingding rested for quite a while before coming out of the gun emplacement, still clutching the DV spasmodically in his hand.

"Damn, this was too exciting... too exciting..." He muttered to himself.

The DV footage shot inside the gun emplacement was extremely stimulating. Because it was too bloody and violent, a part had to be cut when publicly screened.

The Medical Corps and soldiers were clearing the post-battle field on the earthen dike. Whether dead or alive, they kicked anyone they saw. Those who could move, whether government soldiers or their own, were all put on stretchers.

Tian Liang was found by medics from the pile of corpses. He dazedly felt someone kicking him, so he moved a bit.

"The Second Lieutenant is still alive!" A voice said in the distance.

"Establish transport to the Dressing Station quickly."

Then he felt his neck being put in a hard thing to fix it immobile, and then moved onto a stretcher. The movement pulled his wound, making him scream.

Someone immediately poured some cool liquid into his mouth, with a strong medicinal taste. He felt comfortable all over, the wound didn't hurt anymore, and then fell into a drowsy sleep.

The total casualties of the Fubo Army, including militia, reached more than 300, with over 100 deaths, one-quarter of whom were officers and NCOs. This casualty ratio made He Ming and others both happy and worried. Many officers and NCOs killed in action showed that leading by example had taken root in people's hearts, but losing the painstakingly cultivated backbone like this made people feel very regretful.

Weapon losses were very serious, not only damaging hundreds of rifles and many long spears but also damaging three cannons. Ammunition consumption was even more astonishing.

Zhang Tumu's Health Station was busy as a beehive. Six or seven hundred wounded from both sides were concentrated on the open ground outside the Health Station's big tent. Rows of stretchers were arranged on the ground. Fubo Army's light wounded squatted aside smoking and chatting; some sat motionless, seeming dead, but would groan in pain if touched.

Government soldier wounded sat together with gloomy eyes. Except for those in unbearable pain, no one dared to cry out. They looked fearfully at the blood-covered Hair Bandits going in and out of the big tent, from which screams came occasionally.

Zhang Tumu's sleeves were rolled up, arms full of bloodstains. His white gown was splattered with fresh blood, looking like a butcher. The medics beside him were about the same, each covered in blood—he had already performed several surgeries.

You Laohu was carried into the tent and placed on a clean emergency table. The strong smell of blood and disinfectant woke him up. He saw medics gesturing with big scissors between his legs, was startled, and hurriedly protected his key parts.

"What are you doing?"

"Taking off your clothes." Zhang Tumu said, "Otherwise how to treat the wounds?"

"I have no wound 'down there'. Please ask him not to wave the scissors around, okay? If cut ruined, there's no place to install a new one!"

"It's fine, he cuts a lot." Zhang Tumu joked, "Help the Lieutenant Colonel clean the wounds well."

When the stimulating disinfectant touched the wounds, You Laohu's face turned pale, but to guarantee his tough guy image, he endured without shouting out.

"No need, shout if it hurts." Zhang Tumu deftly checked the wounds, "Record! Multiple tearing skin wounds on left and right arms, left and right shoulders, chest, left and right thighs. One deep tearing wound from bladed weapon on left ribs, no internal organs visible, no fracture." Finishing, he ordered, "Inject tetanus immediately. Are you dizzy?"

"Dizzy!"

"You lost quite a bit of blood, but not to a dangerous level yet, otherwise I'd have to mobilize soldiers to donate blood for you—Intravenous injection of 500cc glucose saline! Another shot of morphine!"

"No need for morphine." You Laohu didn't want to touch that stuff.

"You'll want it when sewing your wounds later." Zhang Tumu instructed the medic, "I'll go deal with others first. I'll do the sewing personally."

Zhang Tumu left You Laohu and performed emergency surgery on a soldier stabbed in the belly. He felt strange he could do this surgery because back then he went to muddle in the emergency room precisely because he couldn't pass the surgery hurdle.

"Doctor Zhang! One hit by a three-eyed gun!" A medic ran in hurriedly.

"Carry to Doctor Ning!"

Balding, slightly chubby Ning Jinghai looked at this wounded man full of holes and bleeding all over the floor, complaining: "Which one is this? Can't remove all warheads without an X-ray machine..."

"Save his life first; take X-rays at Muniao later." Zhang Tumu said, "This guy looks like he needs a blood transfusion."

"Blood pressure, heart rate dropping!" The medic shouted.

"Quick, Atropine injection! Transfusion!" Ning Jinghai shouted, flipping open the ID tag on the wounded man's neck, "Type A blood, call four or five Type A blood militia to draw blood!"

The Medical Department hadn't established a full-process blood supply system yet, adopting the "donor" method to supply clinical blood. Plasma used during surgery relied entirely on on-site blood donation by medics and militia who passed blood tests. If necessary, draw from healthy militia and laborers.

Tian Liang was carried to Yang Baogui. He had just finished sewing a soldier's wound and was washing and disinfecting his hands.

"Puncture wound on left leg!" Yang Baogui glanced and shouted, "Prepare to extract arrow head! Inject tetanus!"

The scalpel cut open his muscle; forceps carefully pulled the broken arrow head out of his leg. Yang Baogui carefully checked if any fragmented parts were left in the wound, then cleaned and disinfected it for him.

Tian Liang groaned and woke up.

"How is it? Second Lieutenant." Yang Baogui said, "Took an arrow in the leg. You're lucky; didn't hurt major blood vessels or touch the bone. Through and through. You'll be jumping around again after a month's rest."

Yang Baogui's skill in treating wounds was very exquisite; no one could tell he was actually a veterinarian. He followed to the camp preparing to treat wounds of mules and horses left by the Ming army when the battle ended. For now, he guest-starred as a military doctor temporarily.

Most wounded were not heavily injured. After cleaning and suturing wounds, thanks to the two magic weapons of tetanus shots and antibiotics, many soldiers' lives were preserved. With the help of blood transfusion, infusion, and surgery, many soldiers originally destined to die from heavy wounds also survived.

"...In the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign, the Ministry of Health used homemade drugs and instruments to treat the wounded on a large scale for the first time. This was also the first time homemade antibiotics and tetanus serum were put onto the battlefield for rescue. Under the efforts of the vast medical staff, good results were achieved, saving many people's lives..." (*Health Annals Vol 1*)

The homemade tetanus serum used horse serum. To get horse blood, the Ministry of Health and Nick engaged in quite a verbal lawsuit, only obtaining enough horse serum on the premise of ensuring drawing horse blood wouldn't affect the horses' health. How much actual curative effect the tetanus serum manufactured consuming large amounts of resources had, nothing could test the effect better than using it in battle.

Captured government soldier wounded also received treatment. This was firstly out of "humanitarianism," and secondly out of "pragmatism"—everyone was a precious labor force. The Lingao regime lacked people the most.

"Ryan! Stop chanting scriptures," Zhang Tumu was so busy his feet didn't touch the ground. Seeing Ryan, who was responsible for quarantine and epidemic prevention, doing some last rites prayer for a heavily wounded soldier, anger rose up. "About to clean the battlefield. You are the team leader; go report quickly!"

"...In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen." He made a cross for the dying wounded man, turning his head, "Martyrs need spiritual comfort..."

"Doctor... Chief... I'm still alive..." The wounded man said, "Doctor Zhang said... I won't die."

"Oh—is that so. God is omnipresent..."

"Go quickly!" Zhang Tumu urged repeatedly. Ryan stood up reluctantly. So-called battlefield cleaning was cleaning and burying corpses. This job was disgusting and strenuous. Who told him to be in the direction of preventive medicine, specializing in epidemic elimination and control? And he also had to do tasks assigned by the fake Christian Director Wu. It was said to be for expanding the Church's influence. For this, he had already given confession to several dying government soldier heavy wounded. Muttering while doing it whether what he did was appropriate.
