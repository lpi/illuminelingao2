# Chapter 1588 - Emergency Notice

The sun was setting in the west, and the burning clouds dyed the towers, terraces, carriages, and horses in Lingao County seat with a layer of faint red.

A Dongfeng carriage drove unhurriedly through the newly paved street. The coachman lightly lifted the reins, and the well-trained draft horse slowly stopped beside a building with a plaque reading "Central Experimental Art Troupe". A female Senator walked out of the carriage, her black hair tied up in a "Paris Bird's Nest" bun, skirts fluttering, bearing dignified, elegant with a hint of charm. It was none other than Liu Shuixin.

Just then, another identical carriage followed closely and arrived. Before the carriage stopped steadily, a figure jumped down. It was a young girl wearing a blue sailor collar dress with white trim.

"Ah, Teacher Liu! What a coincidence! Long time no see! You look so good! Wow, such a beautiful skirt and it's so new, looks like it's made in Lingao, they finally learned to make clothes!"

The girl skipped all the way to Liu Shuixin and asked questions like a maximizing gun. For Liu Shuixin, she was very familiar with every "Little Senator", especially girls. She taught them body shaping classes every week.

"Ziqi, what are you doing here? You are not participating in the performance." Liu Shuixin smiled, "I think you could also do a program."

"I can't," Lin Ziqi shook her hands repeatedly, "Singing is a car crash scene, dancing is a dance of demons... No talent. Today I'm here to accompany her to rehearse!" She pointed to Zhang Yunmi who just got off the car behind her. The latter had changed into performance costumes and greeted with a smile: "Hello Teacher Liu! Coming to guide at this time, you've worked hard!"

"Hello Yunmi! For the quality of the program, a little hard work doesn't matter. But it's very good that you can come to lead the dance! The rehearsal is about to start, let's go in!" Zhang Yunmi's dance progress in these few days of rehearsal could be called rapid. Liu Shuixin appreciated it very much. This girl not only had good comprehension but also could endure hardship: dancing was easy—as long as one looked cute, had a good figure, plus a little musical sense, girls dancing Otaku dances to music could get countless "Likes". But to dance well with expressiveness, one had to put in considerable hard work to practice. Zhang Yunmi didn't have any dance foundation. Her body was a bit stiff when she started dancing. She relied completely on sacrificing rest time to practice repeatedly, so words also carried intimacy.

Liu Shuixin originally didn't have a very good perception of the Checkered Skirt Club engaging in some idol group. The reason was that in another spacetime, she had also seen many girls uploading dance videos to the Internet. In her opinion, some girls with great looks, figures, and smiles put little effort into dancing. Even for very simple Japanese idol dances, they danced in a way of swaying hands and feet slightly as if cherishing physical strength extremely. If it weren't for Dongmen and others explaining in many ways that they were building a "professional group", and she indeed had an itch to show her skills, she wouldn't have wanted to take the job of rehearsal teacher for this idol group originally.

However, after these days, she enjoyed it. After so many years, this was the first time she had seriously choreographed a dance for someone to prepare for a performance. The long-absent work made her radiant and feel much younger.

The three walked into the building. Lin Ziqi, dragging behind, didn't forget to make a gesture to signal the guard to leave with the carriage.

Approaching the Cultural Festival performance, several organizers of the Checkered Skirt Club paid extra attention to this overtime rehearsal. Not only were they all present, but they also directed the members to complete various stage preparation works.

Zhang Berlin stood behind the mixing console, a layer of fine beads of sweat already on his forehead.

Because Nan Gonghao himself was a jack of all trades and really couldn't spare himself to take care of the troupe's four seas performances anymore—of course, the "Old Men" of the Checkered Skirt Club thought this was absolutely Okamoto's "deliberate" arrangement—so the task of operating playback and amplification equipment on-site fell on Zhang Berlin of the club. The main reason for letting him go up was that he was the youngest and said to have the fastest reaction.

Operating playback and amplification equipment at the performance site was a technical job and also a careful job. Hands absolutely must not shake to make mistakes, otherwise, light consequences would lead to chaotic music and ugly dancing, and heavy consequences would burn out equipment due to operational errors. Especially for the order of accompaniment, once the wrong segment was played, actors who danced strictly according to the music rhythm would immediately fall into chaos.

Zhang Berlin had to follow Nan Gonghao as an attendant to learn. After several days of hard study, he could barely operate the recording and playback equipment independently.

In the rehearsal hall, areas had been marked on the floor with paper tape according to the size and shape of the stage. Sunlight projected down from the skylight, reflecting the numbers on the floor clearly.

White Arabic numerals, from 0 to 15, from front to back, a total of three rows, sixteen standing positions.

A group of girls were already waiting in the rehearsal room. They had put on makeup and wore head flowers and small accessories according to the requirements of the performance. To maintain the beauty and integrity of clothes and accessories, no one sat, all standing by the wall.

"Okay, everyone stand in your positions! We start the rehearsal." Liu Shuixin didn't bother to exchange pleasantries with the gentlemen of the Checkered Skirt Club. Coming out of the changing room, she directly entered the state.

She changed into a leotard and dance shoes, and her hair was tied directly behind her head with a handkerchief so as not to get in the way. Her expression was serious, seemingly a completely different person from the charming young married woman just now.

The girls quickly stood in their positions according to the rehearsal. Although there were sixteen standing positions, three people had no standing positions, standing in the last row. They were substitute members. Although they also wore costumes and makeup according to the performance requirements to participate in the full rehearsal, they could only stand aside and wait for substitution during the performance.

Zhang Yunmi stood at No. 0, which was the position in the center of the front row. This position was the so-called Center Position (C-position). The focus of the audience's attention. No. 1 position was Lin Aili's, and No. 2 position was Zuo Yami's. It was said that this was instructed by Dongmen Chuiyu. Originally Liu Shuixin's opinion was to let Zuo Yami stand at the No. 1 position. Dongmen's reason was ample: Zuo Yami was an "amateur activist", while Lin Aili was still a full-time student. In terms of age, Lin Aili was also younger, obviously having greater potential as an artist.

"Come on, the first song!" Liu Shuixin clapped her hands and shouted in the direction of Zhang Berlin, "The Only Flower in the World!"

Music in the style of another spacetime sounded. Led by Senator Zhang Yunmi, the girls wearing checkered skirts danced trippingly.

Liu Shuixin stood aside, watching everyone's dance movements seriously, nodding or frowning from time to time.

When the song ended, Dongmen Chuiyu and others sitting aside applauded, but Liu Shuixin shook her head slightly: "There are still some small problems. Starting from Yunmi, come to me alone in turn. I'll emphasize the details."

Lin Ziqi had long found a comfortable chair to sit down. Seeing her best friend walking over from Liu Shuixin, she busily took out Kvass from her bag and handed it over, praising at the same time: "You look really good wearing Japanese style! If in the old spacetime, surely many people would surround you asking for autographs!"

Zhang Yunmi took the drink smoothly but didn't pick up the conversation. Fear of ruining makeup, she dared not use a towel to wipe her face, only using tissue to blot sweat: "Phew, so tired. Uncle Dongmen organizing rehearsal at this hour, should arrange dinner, right?"

"Of course!" Lin Ziqi answered loudly, "Our Fangcaodi Initial Class Beauty is here, how can we slight her!"

Zhang Yunmi revealed a shy smile and shook her head: "Don't talk nonsense, what have I become?" She didn't take the Kvass but shook her head, "You have to insert a straw for me."

Because of lipstick and foundation, one could only use a straw to drink water after makeup.

"Ah, I forgot!" Lin Ziqi hurriedly rummaged for a straw from her bag and inserted it into the bottle. Handing it to her again.

"Thanks. Ziqi, you are really considerate."

"You work so hard." Lin Ziqi looked lovingly at her best friend holding the glass bottle, sipping the drink in small mouthfuls, "I originally thought it was just for fun..."

"Actually I think it's okay. Dancing is very interesting. When dancing, the mind is blank, don't have to think about anything, just follow the rhythm. Like floating." Zhang Yunmi smiled slightly, "It's a pity I don't dance well."

"If you count as dancing badly, others don't need to live..."

Zhang Yunmi shook her head: "Teacher Liu just said my expressiveness is not enough."

"This is too nitpicking."

Zhang Yunmi smiled slightly: "I've somewhat fallen in love with being an idol. Although my dancing is not so great."

Dongmen Chuiyu happened to walk over, heard Lin Ziqi's words, and said with a smile: "Little Zhang, you actually dance very well. Your stage feeling is much stronger than those girls. Their expressiveness is limited by the times after all, and can't compare with you! I have already arranged for the Commercial Officer Restaurant to send food over in a while, won't starve you. You rest for a while first, I'll go see the situation on Teacher Liu's side." After speaking, he walked to the other end of the hall.

"Mn... Uncle Dongmen arranged very thoughtfully. Good, no need to go back to eat." Zhang Yunmi squeezed out a faint smile.

Lin Ziqi naturally understood the meaning in the words. She didn't know what to say for a moment, just patted the slender shoulder of the girl beside her.

At this time, a guard soldier walked into the rehearsal hall and exchanged a few words with several Senators. Wu Ciren's face changed, and he said: "I'll step out for a while, tell everyone not to disperse," and hurriedly followed the soldier leaving the rehearsal hall.

They came to the Art Troupe office. A duty officer handed the receiver to this "Police Chief" who was enthusiastic about art.

"It's me, I'm Wu Ciren, who is this? Director Wu Mu of the Political Security Bureau? Wait a moment!" Wu Ciren covered the receiver, waved to dismiss the people around. Wait until soldiers and employees all left the office, he then spoke to the phone: "What can I do for you?"

After listening to Wu Mu's narration on the phone, Wu Ciren's brows locked tight, especially the last sentence: "Currently there is no evidence proving that Police Officer Zuo Yami has any behavior opposing the Senate, but surveillance has been arranged on her suspicious social interactions. Please pay attention to safety, strict department, and cooperate with our work at the appropriate time." It made him unable to make heads or tails of it.
