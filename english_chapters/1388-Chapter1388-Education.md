# Chapter 1388 - Education

Hao Yuan smiled: "Except for one Nanxiawa, there are millions of poor people under heaven. How can there be so many lucky stars." He put the big bowl on the table, "I still have some income now. besides eating full alone, there's surplus. Naturally helping everyone a bit counts as a bit. I saved your father's life and helped many people here. But out of this Nanxiawa, don't know how many more Nanxiawas, how many poor bitter people there are. Could we just count on more people doing good deeds and accumulating virtue?"

"When we poor families encounter big things, what else can we count on besides people showing kindness?" The girl sighed somewhat helplessly, "Those with good fate, have a noble person like you to save them. Those with bad fate, isn't it just let come what may: a life is gone just like that." As she spoke she wiped her eyes, "I originally had an older brother above me. Loved me very much since childhood. Three years ago he went to a carpentry shop as an apprentice. I ran to the city and even talked to him at the shop door. That night he was carried back: said he went out to deliver goods for the shop, got heatstroke on the way and was gone. At that time if he had a packet of Plague Avoiding Powder on him, blowing into the nose could save the person. Plague Avoiding Powder only costs four wen, but he didn't even have four wen!"

Speaking here tears were rolling down. Hao Yuan silently patted her head.

She wiped her tears: "Mr. Hao, in Nanxiawa this kind of thing counts for nothing. A person dying really doesn't even make a sound. Rolling up in a reed mat and burying in the charity graveyard behind is the end. Just today don't know why I thought of him again—do you know since you came, how many fewer people died here, how many fewer people were taken away by human traffickers?"

Hao Yuan nodded: "So you say I'm a lucky star—" He took out a handkerchief and handed it to the girl, "Wipe your tears. A big girl already, still wiping tears and snot on sleeves."

The girl took the handkerchief, quietly glancing at him: "Knew you were from a young master background... looking down on me, this poor girl."

Hao Yuan smiled: "Don't say such words again." His face became very serious: "I'm no young master. Coming here wasn't to be a noble person or philanthropist either."

The girl blinked her bright eyes, seeming somewhat puzzled. Hesitated a bit before asking: "Then what did you come here for?"

Hao Yuan avoided answering; his expression was both heavy and cheerful. The girl was somewhat confused. Suddenly she clapped hands laughing: "I know, Mr. Hao came to help poor people."

Hao Yuan smiled and nodded: "Tell me, why are poor people so poor?"

"Fate is bad—didn't get born into a good family."

"So those rich people just have good fate?"

"Then you tell me, why is their fate good?"

"Because... because..." The girl couldn't think of it, "Masters in the temple say that comes from accumulating kindness and practicing virtue."

"But look at those rich people, how many accumulate kindness and practice virtue?" Hao Yuan asked, "Even if there are a few among rich people, are they many or few?"

"Few—" The girl hesitated a bit and said, "But masters in the temple also said merit in previous lives is also very important."

"Accumulating kindness and practicing virtue in previous life, doing evil in this life? Isn't this too strange."

The girl couldn't speak; her eyes became somewhat bewildered.

"Then you tell me why is this?"

"Because this world belongs to them rich people, not us common poor people." Hao Yuan said, "Your father carries a load out to do small business every day. Next door Shuigen's family does short-term labor growing vegetables... Grain and vegetables in the field, silk and cotton cloth worn, houses and utensils, which one isn't made by our common people's blood and sweat? Your family makes dumplings and boils lotus root starch every day, but you can't even afford to give me a bowl of lotus root starch dumplings—where did the things we worked hard to make go?"

The girl was somewhat confused—she had never thought about these things, only felt her own family was poor. As for why so poor, she hadn't thought about it.

Hao Yuan continued: "Because this world is theirs. With one sentence, they can take away the things we worked hard to make."

"Doesn't this world belong to Emperor Zhu?"

"Emperor Zhu also snatched the world from Yuan Dynasty emperors. He was originally just a poor monk, had to go out begging for food during famine to not starve to death." Hao Yuan said, "You say was his fate good or bad? Why could a person who was originally going to starve to death become emperor in the end?"

"Um..." This logic was really a bit hard to understand for a teenage girl. But a ray of light seemed to suddenly project into her originally blocked and dark heart, instantly illuminating something.

Hao Yuan said firmly: "So there is no 'fate' in this world. Even if there is, we can change it."

"Really?" A look of both doubt and excitement appeared on the girl's face.

"Correct. Since feeling the fate given by Old Lord Heaven is unfair," Hao Yuan said, "Only rely on oneself to change it."

"How to change, how to change?" The girl pressed, "Sir, you must know how to change fate. I've long wanted to change my own fate—or changing father and mother's fate is also fine. Not asking to eat fish and meat, wear silk and satin, at least eat a few meals of fine grain, have a few decent clothes to wear."

Hao Yuan was amused by her words: "I'm not a fortune teller, how to change fate pattern? Even those who say they can change it are deceiving people—they don't understand the Great Dao truth, only playing some metaphysical small tricks. Not walking the right path."

The girl was confused: "Then what is the Great Dao truth?"

Hao Yuan didn't continue, asking: "You want to know?"

"Want!"

"Ever studied books?"

"Of course not..." The girl shook her head.

"To understand the Great Dao, must first recognize characters. Otherwise being a biologically open-eyed blind person, rich people will bully you even more." Hao Yuan said, "I teach children to recognize characters here every night. You come too." He looked at the oil lamp, "It's late, go back to sleep. Have to get up early tomorrow."

"Good!" The girl responded standing up, then added: "Mr. Hao, don't blame me for talking too much. The two people who came today didn't look like good people. One with a scarred face looked just like a river and lake bandit."

Hao Yuan nodded: "They are indeed not good people. But their badness hasn't reached the root yet..."

"If river and lake bandits killing and arson haven't reached the root, what bas?"

"River and lake bandits, killing and arson seeking wealth. But one person or a few persons' strength is limited after all. Saying what they can destroy, nothing more than taking a few lives, seizing some wealth for their own use. But once wind leaks, caught by government, or intercepted by militia during robbery, unavoidable death. Licking blood on knife edge to hang out, hanging out well or not, ultimately no good end.

"True great villains and evildoers are all those hypocrites looking dignified, usually called Masters by people. If there is famine, they even take out money and rice to relieve the masses—but when they do bad things, how many families broken and people dead because of it, still don't know it's him doing the bad—not knowing aside, he snatches everything from common people, turns hand to take out some residue to give charity, common people still have to be grateful with tears. Really implies killing people and exterminating households invisibly."

"Ah, there are such bad people?!" The girl said indignantly, then turned to worry, "Then doesn't it mean no one can do anything to them?"

"Correct, because this world is their world. We common people are deceived by them, can't see clearly who are real bad people, treating a few river and lake bandits as unforgivably bad people." Hao Yuan said, "But as long as more and more people see clearly their faces, they can no longer deceive people, bully people like this. Not only that, we also want to take back the things originally belonging to us—"

Speaking here, Hao Yuan felt he said too much. The other party was just a young girl after all, might not be able to fully understand his words. Instilling too much at once might cause indigestion.

"I understand." The girl said, "To change everyone's poor fate, must first understand Great Dao truth. Knowing Great Dao truth, those bad people can no longer deceive us."

"Right, you are really smart." Hao Yuan nodded smiling, "Hurry back to sleep."

"Uncle Hao you be careful..."

"Doesn't matter." Hao Yuan said, "I am here, together with everyone, afraid of no one."

 seeing off the girl, Hao Yuan checked again the straw mat blocking the translucent shell, and arranged the straw mat serving as door, pressing bricks on corners, trying not to let light leak out.

Finishing all this, he picked bright the oil lamp wick, added two more wicks, sat before the wooden board serving as desk, spread out a few thin white papers, and started drafting a placard. Also took a tattered current essay booklet and a half-smeared schoolwork scroll placed aside.

If someone suddenly came in, they would only see a poor scholar studying hard.

While grinding ink, Hao Yuan considered the content of the placard. This was preparing to expose Zhao Yingong colluding with government, manipulating silk prices. He had been considering for several days how to write it to be both easy to understand and use fewest words to express.

Placards were to be printed in large quantities. Writing too long and complex, carving blocks would take too long—time was urgent.

Hao Yuan wrote on thin paper while thinking. His characters were the most ordinary Yan style, calligraphy not good-looking, but written very powerfully.

Placard written, he corrected once, recopied clearly again. Waiting for ink to dry, carefully put the draft in a bamboo tube, stuffed in a wall hole in the corner. Then he took out a letter just received from Qiwei Private Letter Bureau today, pulled out the letter paper inside, carefully toasted over lamp fire.

On the blank space of the letter paper, brown handwriting gradually emerged under flame roasting. Hao Yuan read carefully several times, put both letter and placard draft to lamp fire to ignite, watching them burn clean.

Finishing all this, he washed hands, poured himself a bowl of cold boiled water, sat at table, eating bite of coarse grain cake, drinking mouthful of cold water.
