# Chapter 223 - The Banquet

Most delegates weren't harboring ulterior motives like Huang Bingkun. They adhered to the standard traditional Chinese mindset: muddle through one moment at a time. Since the baldies were powerful—and even the yamen's Master Wu sat on the stage—going along with things as common folk wasn't unreasonable.

The afternoon session was relatively simple. After a round of tea was served, Wu De asked each village to nominate a "liaison officer." The liaison officers would come to the Baireng public office on the first of each month for meetings and to receive instructions from the transmigrator collective.

"Liaison officer—you might as well just have each village establish a maintenance committee," someone had said uncomfortably when the system was first being designed.

"The term 'liaison officer' is quite neutral—nothing wrong with it," Ma Qianzhu hadn't seen the problem. "No need for maintenance committees. Later we'll just have each village establish a village committee."

The liaison officer system nominally received directives from the Baireng public office, but in practice served as the transmigrator collective's means of remote command over each village. It was also stipulated that whenever public office personnel visited villages, the liaison officer would be responsible for reception and support.

"All support will be paid for with circulation vouchers at market rates," Wu De explained. "Circulation vouchers can be used to offset villages' allocated grain quotas."

For items whose value couldn't be immediately determined, public office personnel would issue receipts in duplicate, detailing the support provided, with both parties signing or making their marks. The liaison officer would bring the receipts to the public office each month for price verification and settlement, offsetting the grain levy.

This system was both simple and clear, and didn't harm the people's interests. The delegates expressed their approval. However, many privately doubted whether such a system could actually be implemented—those in power saying one thing and doing another, breaking their own word, was the most familiar common knowledge to Chinese commoners.

The Political Consultative Conference was coming to an end. All major policies had now been explained; what remained were details. Details couldn't be clarified in such a large gathering of hundreds, so group meetings were convened, with transmigrators explaining matters to each group.

The attendees were divided into groups by *du* and *tu* districts, with a transmigrator assigned to lead each group. At most, each group had only thirty or forty delegates. Anything they didn't understand could be asked immediately, making communication much more efficient.

First, each village was issued a set of simple measuring instruments: a set of large and small 500-gram weights, designated the "big *jin*," and a one-meter wooden ruler, designated the "big *chi*." Both related to future material collection and were the first standards the transmigrator regime needed to unify.

Wen Desi had also wanted to promote the Gregorian calendar, but calendars had always been the imperial court's prerogative. Unauthorized promulgation of calendars was tantamount to rebellion, so they ultimately decided not to issue one. They'd deal with that after completely breaking with the court.

Finally, each village was issued a booklet of circulation voucher samples, with written instructions on usage and exchange methods. This booklet also bore the public office's credentials—in the future, transmigrators going to the countryside only needed to carry credentials to request support from villages.

It was nearly dinner time. Among the village elders and clan heads were many old foxes. Taking advantage of the face-to-face discussions, they insisted that militia sent to join the Security Regiment must be led by their own sons and nephews. How could that be allowed? This unreasonable demand was immediately rejected by the Executive Committee.

At this point, some landlords from along the Wenlan River raised the land issue—some of the land currently occupied by the transmigrators was supposedly unused wasteland but actually had owners. In the past, landlords had been afraid of the transmigrators' force and no one dared raise the matter. Now, seeing their friendly attitude and reasonableness, some came forward weeping that such-and-such land was their family's, that their entire household depended on it for food, and now that the lords had taken it, the whole family was going hungry and so on.

Ma Qianzhu frowned. The government troops hadn't even come yet, and these landlords were already trying to settle accounts for regime change! Now they were demanding land. When they'd occupied the land, they'd been very careful not to disturb or harm the people. Any land showing signs of cultivation or use had been left alone; they'd only selected overgrown, desolate wasteland—Linggao had no shortage of wasteland, including along the Wenlan River. Looking at the complaining delegates—each one plump and well-fed—none of them looked remotely hungry. He was about to react sharply when Wen Desi stopped him:

"Don't, don't do that. We've just arrived here—this is the time to win the people's trust. We can't be too heavy-handed."

This rightist really did have a soft spot for the exploiting class. Ma Qianzhu was quite displeased, but now was the time for cultivating local goodwill, and landlord elements were targets for united front work. He couldn't afford to break with them, but he couldn't be too soft either, lest they push for more.

After consulting with Wu De, they announced: if transmigrators had occupied owned land, landlords could bring their deeds to process transfer procedures, and the public office would purchase at market rates. Since Linggao had so much wasteland, uncultivated land was essentially worthless—purchases wouldn't cost much.

Unexpectedly, as soon as this decision was announced, Wu Ya also emerged to solemnly point out that much of the land occupied by the transmigrators, though wasteland, was government land. The transmigrators still hadn't processed deed transfers since occupying it. He suggested the public office go to the county yamen to arrange the deeds—now that the transmigrators had the entity of Baireng Village, they could handle various paperwork.

---

Damn—even the government wanted a piece of the action. They really spared no effort in revenue collection. Wu De thought: with the handle of a sword in hand, the other party wouldn't dare quote outrageous prices. Grease a few officials' palms, and state assets would naturally come cheap. They'd seen this game played many times; he hadn't expected to experience it firsthand in this timeline. He readily agreed, saying he'd pay a visit another day. Wu Ya was delighted, thinking these baldies were becoming more and more sensible.

This matter also reminded the transmigrators of the need to further investigate the county's land situation. Their development plans included road network construction and development of industrial and mining zones—all requiring collection of land data.

The First Linggao Political Consultative Conference finally drew to a successful close. Wen Desi delivered the closing address. Then he announced that all delegates would be hosted at a banquet that evening, with entertainment performances.

The evening banquet was held in the Commercial Hall at East Gate Market. The main hall was put to good use. Originally a bare shell, the hall had been renovated for this conference. The interior decoration was the joint handiwork of Dongmen Chuiyu and Dugu. To impress this timeline's natives with a level of material civilization beyond their era and inspire awe, the *Fengcheng* once again served as provider of modern goods. Despite the Navy's fierce objections, Dugu Qiuhun led a team to strip the *Fengcheng*'s banquet hall of its crystal glass chandeliers, decorative paintings, wall tapestries... all of which became the Commercial Hall's interior décor.

According to Dongmen Chuiyu's original plan, the floor would have been covered entirely with natural stone like marble. But stone-cutting machinery was currently in short supply, and no one knew how to do it, so they settled for a traditional brick floor—decorated with red corridor carpet salvaged from the *Fengcheng*.

As Office Director, Xiao Zishan handled all these matters. Preparing a banquet for over three hundred delegates would have been convenient in the modern timeline—everything was readily available. Here, everything had to be done from scratch. They sorted through the captured loot from Gou Manor and cleaned up over a thousand pieces of porcelain tableware. Chopsticks were easy—the woodworking shop could produce them immediately. Food ingredients were more difficult. Though vegetables were now plentiful, meat, eggs, poultry, and cooking oil were all tight. Lin Quanfu rushed out to purchase and managed to obtain some chickens, ducks, and live pigs. The dishes would have to focus on fish and shrimp. The Naval Forces Department used ship refrigerators to make ice and sent over plenty of fresh fish and shrimp, frozen. Fortunately, the canteen wasn't short on seasonings and spices, allowing for diverse preparation.

To demonstrate grandeur, a huge block of salted ice was specially made in the *Fengcheng*'s cold storage and sent to the Commercial Hall. This ice block had now been carved into a lion by the area's most skilled stonemason—it was the only thing he knew how to carve.

This ice lion now stood on a table in the center of the banquet hall. Under the chandelier's illumination, it gleamed brilliantly, wisps of white vapor rising from it. Around the ice sculpture, various tropical fruits and fresh flowers gathered by the Long-Range Reconnaissance Team from the Li territories and Gaoshanling mountains were arranged in brilliant colors. Every dish and vase was glassware from the glass factory.

The delegates had never seen anything like this. They were all dumbstruck—these short-hairs were truly extravagant! And extravagant far beyond their imagination! But what amazed them most wasn't the ice sculpture or the glassware—it was the glass chandelier hanging overhead, continuously releasing soft, bright light.

The delegates had long heard rumors that every night, the short-hairs' camp glittered with brilliant light, making even stars and moonlight pale in comparison. At this moment, almost everyone was gazing at the chandelier, nearly entranced.

"Everyone please be seated, please be seated," Wu De called out, snapping everyone back to reality. They took their seats.

Since they used local eight-immortals tables, eight people sat at each table. The dishes weren't numerous—the standard was six dishes and one soup, which by Ming dynasty banquet standards was quite modest. But because the cuisine was novel, everyone was quite satisfied. Especially the white liquor that was served—exceptionally mellow, far superior to the local hooch. At first the delegates were somewhat reserved, but after Wu De and others made rounds encouraging drinking and a few cups were emptied, the atmosphere quickly livened up.

"Who would have thought these bal—short-hairs could even make such fine wine!" a gentleman couldn't help sighing.

"Indeed, I just can't figure it out," another delegate said. "Looking at how they eat, dress, and live—even the wealthy families in Guangzhou city might not compare. Why didn't they stay in their homeland? Why travel thousands of *li* to come to our poor backwater?"

"Look how small they build their houses, and they love building multi-story. Perhaps their homeland is short on land with too many people."

"I think they're short on women," a gentleman who'd had a few too many blinked and laughed lewdly. "Look at those real baldies—basically all men. And women giving orders? If they weren't short of women, would they let womenfolk climb all over them?"

Everyone roared with laughter, agreeing heartily.
