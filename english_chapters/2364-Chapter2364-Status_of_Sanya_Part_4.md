# Chapter 2364: Status of Sanya (Part 4)

Next, Tang Menglong introduced Sanya's population situation in detail. Sanya currently had a registered population of over 50,000, plus more than 10,000 slave laborers without household registration. The total population was nearly 70,000. In addition, there were several thousand troops and short-term dispatched personnel who could not be counted in the population.

This figure left a very deep impression on Xu Yanliang. Not counting Guangzhou, Lingao, the "First Metropolis" of the Senate, only had a population of less than 200,000.

The current population was mainly concentrated in Hexi District, Tiandu District, and Jinling District. Among them, Jinling District had the most. This area had much flat land and ample water supply, and most farmers coming to Sanya lived in this area. Several local farms of the Agricultural Reclamation Bureau were also mostly set up here. The second gathering area was Tiandu. The third was Hexi District.

This introduction lasted until the evening. That night, Tang Menglong played the host, and the two drank and chatted happily. Borrowing the alcohol, Xu Yanliang revealed some of the "ambitions" of the Nanyang Company in the future, and Tang Menglong also patted his chest to guarantee "full support." The two parted only after enjoying themselves to the full.

The next day, Tang Menglong said he would take him to Hexi District. Xu Yanliang declined—today he was going to meet the staff of the Southeast Asia Company's Sanya trading station, and it would be inconvenient to have Tang Menglong around, so he just asked him to arrange a guide. Tang Menglong then arranged for a secretary from the municipal government to lead the way.

This secretary was not old; he had just graduated from the administrative class of Fangcaodi last year and was assigned to Sanya. As soon as Xu Yanliang came out of the City Hall, he saw him waiting under the steps with two Venus Zeros and four guards riding bicycles.

Seeing him come out, he immediately performed a standing attention and nodding salute:

"Yuan Fei, Secretary of the General Office of Sanya Municipal Government, reporting to you!"

There were few departments in the Sanya Municipal Government, and the number of cadres equipped was very small. This so-called secretary was a "handyman" who did everything.

"How old are you?" Looking at the rather immature teenager in front of him wearing an ill-fitting cadre uniform, Xu Yanliang couldn't help laughing.

"Report to Chief, seventeen years old!"

"So young, why didn't you study for a few more years?"

"Report to Chief..."

"Stop with this chatter, answer the question directly!"

"Yes! The Senator teacher said I was 'rotten wood that cannot be carved,' and it was better to start working as early as possible. At least I can accumulate a few more years of seniority."

"Arranging 'rotten wood that cannot be carved' to Sanya as a secretary; come, tell me who this unconventional Chief is."

"It's, it's Senator Yang Xinwu."

"It's him." Xu Yanliang almost laughed again. But he held back, "Can you ride a bicycle?"

"Of course!"

"Then send this broken rickshaw back; we'll ride over!"

"Yes, Chief!"

The group rode bicycles along the Senate Avenue, returning along the route of yesterday. After arriving at the pier, they continued to ride forward. This area on the west bank of the Sanya River and east of the coast was a narrow strip running north-south. In the simple planning, it was the commercial and living center of Sanya City.

Not far from the pier was the Trading Station District. Commerce and freight transport in the 17th century were not yet completely separated, and merchants engaged in trade mostly traveled with their goods. Therefore, countries set up buildings like "trading stations" or "factories" in port cities.

Trading stations were roughly based on a country, a region, or a company, integrating accommodation, negotiation, and inventory, and also having functions like currency exchange and remittance. Trading stations generally adopted fully enclosed management, partly to ensure the personal and property safety of merchants, and partly to facilitate local government management and taxation. From the earliest "Steelyard" of the Hanseatic League in London to the barbarian factories of the "Thirteen Factories" in Guangzhou, they were similar institutions. In the early days, such trading stations also had the role of consulates.

Because Sanya was positioned as an "International Trade City," land was specially designated near the pier at that time to set up trading stations. However, because trade here was not prosperous, so far, only the British East India Company, the Dutch East India Company, and the Portuguese had set up trading stations here.

Xu Yanliang arrived at the Trading Station District and felt it was cold and deserted. On the huge open space, there were only a few small buildings and supporting warehouses. A few flags fluttered listlessly.

"That house is the trading station of the Southeast Asia Company." Yuan Fei pointed to a distant house while riding.

The location of the Southeast Asia Company's trading station was near its dedicated pier. It looked equally desolate. The open-air cargo stacking area of the pier was clean, without even a broken box, only seagulls flying up and down foraging everywhere. The heavy steam cranes and supporting boilers were cold, without a single spark. More than a dozen merchant ships were moored by the trestle bridge. Not only were the sails furled, but some ships even had their masts removed. There were no sailors on the ships, only two guards standing guard by the trestle bridge in boredom. A scene of depression in winter break.

"Is it always this deserted here?" Xu Yanliang felt more discouraged as he looked and asked.

"It's winter now. It will be lively when the wind direction changes next spring," Yuan Fei said.

Xu Yanliang stopped the bike, looked around the pier, and asked, "What ships come here?"

"Mainly British ships. There are also Dutch ships. Portuguese ships rarely come."

"Rarely come but still set up a trading station?"

"Few ships come. But this trading station is quite busy; local merchants often interact with the Portuguese here."

"Oh, why is that?"

"Not clear," Yuan Fei said.

Xu Yanliang became suspicious: it was not strange that Portuguese ships rarely came—they could go directly to Macao to do business, no need to detour to Sanya. But since few ships came, why did the Portuguese set up a trading station locally? And since many local merchants were so-called "shell companies," why did they often interact with Portuguese merchants?

Since ancient times, no one gets up early without profit; behind these abnormal behaviors, there must be some interest connection.

Yuan Fei was about to lead him over, but Xu Yanliang said, "Take me around Hexi first. We'll go to the trading station last."

Since this place was to be a long-term base, it was better to find out the situation clearly when first arriving.

The convoy passed the pier area and went north along the north-south Xintiandi Avenue. The market here was much more prosperous than in Hedong District, and the atmosphere of urban life was much heavier. The shops on both sides were two-story "Qilou" (arcade buildings) in the style of "Old Guangzhou" and "Old Haikou"—very practical in hot and rainy places like Sanya.

He got interested and immediately got off the bike, saying, "Let's walk over and have a look!"

Yuan Fei naturally couldn't spoil his fun and immediately led the way in front, with four guards protecting them, patrolling along the street.

The road construction standards here were exactly the same as Senate Avenue. The sidewalks were paved with local stone. The Qilou of various sizes and heights were also built with stone and red bricks. Not only was the construction excellent, but the building design and appearance were also very exquisite, even better than Bairen City. Xu Yanliang even noticed the gas lamps here. Compared to those simple geometric iron lamp bases in Lingao, the gas lamps here had complex and gorgeous patterns.

The Senate really pinned high hopes on this place back then. Xu Yanliang lamented in his heart. Now, the Senate's attention was focused on the mainland, and this original "pearl" of Sanya inevitably seemed a bit dull.

How can it radiate light? Xu Yanliang couldn't help falling into thought again.

He roamed under the Qilou, browsing shop after shop. Judging from the signboards, there were all kinds of trades here, and the stocks in the shops were sufficient. But he noticed that most shops here were commercial firms dealing in consumer goods like food, daily necessities, and catering. That is to say, their customers were mainly locals. Probably the capital wouldn't be too large either.

Logically speaking, this was a foreign trade port, and there should be a considerable number of firms engaged in overseas trade. For example, shops selling imported spices, textiles, and handicrafts, etc.—this was very common in Guangzhou. But he walked several hundred meters here and didn't see many. It could be seen that foreign trade did not play a dominant role here.

Seeing his solemn face, Yuan Fei felt a little uneasy. Suddenly he heard Xu Yanliang ask:

"Are there any big businesses here besides these small trading firms?"

"Yes, yes, the biggest firm here is Qionghai Hao..."

"Qionghai Hao? Isn't this Li Luoyou's business?" Hearing this familiar word, Xu Yanliang blurted out.

"Li Luoyou? No, no, the boss of this firm is surnamed Gu..."

"Oh, oh, right, right, called Gu something Cheng."

"Gu Baocheng."

"Right, Gu Baocheng." Xu Yanliang was a bit strange, "Isn't he in Lingao?"

He knew this Gu Baocheng; he was the apple of Li Luoyou's eye, closer than a son. Putting him in Lingao was to save up a family business for him so that he could be a rich man with peace of mind. Why did he run to Sanya again?

"It's the Sanya branch of Qionghai Hao. Master Gu is not here; someone else is the shopkeeper."

Xu Yanliang thought that this firm was an old partner firm of the Senate and had stood the test. Although Li Luoyou's attitude was ambiguous, and after the recovery of Guangzhou, he ran north to Nanjing in a flash. However, his firms in Guangdong had not moved and were still operating normally.

"How is this branch operating locally?"

"Standard, doing some maritime trade business. The business is not big. There are ships taking the Kaohsiung route, and ships going to the Portuguese side."

"Any others?"

"There is also a branch of Dongshan Ju. Originally, the business was quite prosperous, but news came a few days ago that their boss Liu was arrested in Guangzhou. The head office of Dongshan Ju was also sealed up. Now Dongshan Ju is in chaos from top to bottom. Business can't be done anymore."

"Who is the shopkeeper of this firm now?"

"The shopkeeper here is named Chen Huamin, said to be Boss Liu's cousin. A few days ago, he came to ask our Chief for help, pleading tearfully."
