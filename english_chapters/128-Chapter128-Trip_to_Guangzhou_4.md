# Chapter 128 - Trip to Guangzhou (4)

The future blueprint Xiao Zishan drew for Qiwei Escort Agency was actually restructuring it into an armed freight company—the social order at the end of the Ming Dynasty had begun to disintegrate gradually, and long-distance transportation was impossible without armed escort.

Sun Kecheng was dumbfounded, thinking this person had a big tone. Opening escort agencies wherever business reached—not to mention he didn't have so many fellow disciples, disciples, and grand-disciples to work, even with the three forces of officials, bandits, and local (tyrants) everywhere, he didn't have the ability to befriend them one by one.

"This doesn't matter." Xiao Zishan didn't care, "For the time being, we only need to open a new escort route, which is from Guangzhou to Haikang and Xuwen."

"Haikang, Xuwen?" Sun Kecheng was puzzled. Haikang was the head county of Leizhou Prefecture, and Xuwen was a subordinate county below. Both places were considered remote and poor in Guangdong. As for products, only sea salt and cane sugar were major items. There were not many wealthy big households either. He knew what the Australian maritime merchants sold—all rare treasures worth cities. Doing this kind of business in Leizhou would be losing everything.

"Correct." Xiao Zishan nodded. There were two main purposes for opening this trade route: First, to open up the land transportation line between Hainan and Guangzhou. Opposite Bopu Port was Denglongjiao in Xuwen. The two places faced each other across the sea. If the sea route was blocked, the transmigrators could cross the sea from Bopu and take the route via Leizhou to Guangzhou. Second, to obtain local cane sugar. The climate and soil of Leizhou Peninsula were suitable for sugarcane cultivation. There were local sugar mills since the Eastern Han Dynasty. By the Ming Dynasty, local sugarcane planting and sugar making were already very developed. Around 1700, the annual output of local sugar reached 10,000 tons, most of which was exported. Sugar was one of the most profitable goods in China's overseas trade during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The transmigrators certainly couldn't let it go. Although they were currently unable to directly control Leizhou Peninsula, setting up points for acquisition and striving for sources of goods could still be done.

What Xiao Zishan wanted Qiwei Escort Agency to do was to open a branch in Haikang and Xuwen counties respectively within a month, and then gradually open large mule and horse inns or cart shops in important villages and towns along the road, forming a postal station-style transportation line. As for the funds needed to open outer counters everywhere, they would bear all of them. In addition, another three thousand taels of silver were given to Qiwei for recruiting personnel, befriending local officials, and paying all miscellaneous fees.

"A month is too tight," Sun Kecheng shook his head repeatedly, "Qiwei has no escort route in Leizhou and has to send people to explore the way. This matter can't be done in less than two or three months."

"Two months then. This matter is relatively urgent." Wu Nanhai had already notified him that the harvest period for sugarcane was autumn and winter every year. If the escort route could be opened in time, it would still be possible to set up shops in Leizhou to collect sugar, and large-scale white sugar could be produced next spring—the transmigrators' export goods would also be settled.

"These are easy to say." Sun Kecheng didn't seem very excited, "Forgive me for saying too much: The shopkeepers came from afar. Leizhou is a remote and poor place. Think thrice before doing business there..."

Xiao Zishan was somewhat moved. In another time and space, unknown numbers of people racking their brains to invent names to cheat appropriations, polishing others' things a bit and claiming them as their own, easily cheating hundreds of millions of common people's hard-earned tax money. This escort agency shopkeeper, whose business situation was not good, asked him to "think thrice" about investment projects! The realm of people is really too far apart.

"Don't worry, we have our reasons." Xiao Zishan knew that without a serious reason, merchants like escort agencies who conducted themselves extremely uprightly were hard to move simply with money. Fortunately, the reason for buying sugar was ready-made: "Leizhou produces sugar, and Australia needs cane sugar most. Going back and forth is profit matching the capital. We just want to set up shops locally in Leizhou to collect sugar."

Only then did Sun Kecheng suddenly realize, praising them repeatedly for having "foresight," and agreed readily. Xiao Zishan immediately proposed three requirements: First, recruit manpower as soon as possible to expand the escort agency's team; second, help find mature and reliable shopkeepers and assistants locally for opening business firms; third, establish a liaison system between both sides. Because Gao Di was learning martial arts in the escort agency, he was a relatively suitable candidate. So it was agreed that contact between Huifu Street and the escort agency would be once every seven days. In case of emergency, contact could be made on the same day. After both sides settled the plan, Xiao Zishan handed the silver note taken from Gao Ju to Chief Escort Sun. The cooperation between both sides was thus established.

In the following days, Xiao Zishan ran between Qiwei Escort Agency and the Gao residence. He had too many things needing help from these locals. Xiao Zishan also witnessed the huge influence of merchants like Gao Ju in Guangzhou. Many things could be settled just by him sending a steward out with a calling card. It was more convenient than leaders in modern society writing notes or making phone calls.

Soon, the baojia (community self-defense system) for Guo Yi and others was handled, counting as officially registering households. Actually, things like household registers and yellow books were no longer needed in Guangzhou at the end of the Ming Dynasty; baojia was mainly a security measure. As for their origin, naturally, they couldn't say Australian maritime merchants, just saying they were fellow villagers of the Gao family. With the Gao family steward coming forward, the local baojia head dared not neglect and settled the matter immediately. Xiao Zishan knew that such semi-official semi-civilian "little devils" were the most difficult characters to deal with in both the past and present, and easy to cause trouble at critical moments. He immediately took out a thick reward packet of five taels. Sure enough, the other party beamed with joy and became even more respectful.

Except for a few people left to guard the ship, the personnel of the purchasing group moved into the residence on Huifu Street. After resting for two days, they all clamored to go out for a walk to see the appearance of this 17th-century southeastern metropolis.

Xiao Zishan knew that hindering them would only invite complaints, but going out in a swarm like this without causing trouble would be strange. After all, these people were too well-nourished, and their behavior was not very coordinated with the surrounding environment. So he divided people into groups of five or six, each group accompanied by two escorts invited from Qiwei Escort Agency to ensure safety. In addition, each person was given one tael of silver and one thousand wen of copper coins as pocket money.

The profession of escort, having friendships with both the underworld and official circles, bred a unique guarantee relationship. Generally, people in the underworld who had "made friends" with the escort agency would be accompanied and taken care of by people sent by the escort agency when entering the city for medical treatment, sightseeing, or purchasing things, enjoying good food, drink, and fun, and finally being escorted out of the city politely—but there was one rule: those entering the city could not cause trouble in the city. Not to mention committing crimes or violence, even whoring or gambling, escorts would not accompany them as a rule, and friends in the underworld also kept this rule. Over time, when the runners and detectives arresting in the city saw bandits accompanied by escorts, they would not arrest or interrogate them as a rule. Xiao Zishan knew that the transmigrators looked too distinctive. Going out in groups would immediately be targeted by detectives in the government office. It was safer to ask escorts to accompany them.

Everyone went happily. Bei Wei brought a few students and also went out accompanied by escorts. However, they were not sightseeing but conducting field surveys of Guangzhou's topography, drawing accurate maps of important facilities such as roads, government offices, granaries, and city gates in the city. Xiao Zishan, Guo Yi, and their group were guided by Liu Gang to stroll randomly on the streets, mainly to explore future business development models.

The group changed their clothes, came out of Huifu Street, walked through several small streets, and arrived at the busy market. Shops stood in great numbers here, extremely prosperous. Merchants from all over gathered here, with various goods from the two capitals (Beijing and Nanjing), various provinces, and foreign countries. In terms of era and scope, there were various antiques since the Three Dynasties, fashionable brocades, silk fabrics, embroidery, cloth, household utensils, as well as self-chiming clocks and rare gadgets from the West. Shops were classified by industry, each occupying a section of the street. After breakfast, big and small streets were flooded with people, becoming extremely crowded after the hour of Si (9-11 am). People buying things, watching excitement, looking at rare things to broaden horizons, and also specifically looking at people, crowded back and forth, laughing and talking. It was truly better looking than scenes in many movies and TV dramas. Several people stared blankly—thinking that in less than twenty years, in the chaotic war of the Ming-Qing transition, how much of the accumulated wealth of three hundred years in this prosperous capital of the southeast in the red dust would be burned to ashes or looted, and how many people making a living or sightseeing here would turn into dried bones, they couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

The further they walked, the more crowded it became, and the more lively the business was. Everyone didn't know what to look at. Liu Gang was very familiar with the roads. Where it was too crowded to pass, he led them to detour through small paths. While walking, Yan Maoda saw a very large jewelry store by the street. He signaled, indicating he wanted to go in and take a look. Everyone felt curious, so they went in together to browse casually. The Cantonese boss in the store was inviting a guest to look at a mirror—the pink plastic rim made Xiao Zishan remember immediately: Wasn't this the Wenzhou mirror he wholesaled from the small commodity market? Surprisingly, it could be sold in a jewelry store.

"Must this mirror be sold for one hundred and fifty taels? Can it come down a bit?"

The merchant answered extremely respectfully: "Really can't be less. Nowadays, even if you go to the Gao family's shop to buy, you can't find such a crystal rosy jade mirror. If you want an ordinary black jade mirror, this humble one only asks for one hundred taels. Let me tell you, even Master Gao doesn't know when goods for this crystal colored jade mirror will come again! For this rare pink one, probably in another ten or fifteen days, it will have to sell for two hundred taels."

Obviously, the Gao family was not only retailing but also wholesaling. Gao Ju was quite smart on this point. As long as the Australian maritime merchants could supply goods continuously, controlling the source of general wholesale channels covered a much larger area than just selling goods through his own shop. Although earning a little less on unit price, the total sales volume went up.

The guest examined the mirror for a while and said: "Okay, I'll take it. This mirror is indeed remarkable, reflecting people so clearly!"
