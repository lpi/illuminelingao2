Chapter 65 Bailaren Beach (1)

With the completion of the road, the development of Bailaren Beach officially began.

This was a comprehensive project involving hydropower stations, fortresses, industrial zones, etc.

The first was the construction of the hydropower station.

"We need to build a dam here." Wang Luobin pointed to the narrowest part of the river, "Intercept the water flow and raise the water level."

"Building a dam requires a lot of cement and stones."

"We have them all."

Trucks of cement and stones were transported to the construction site. Excavators and bulldozers roared.

Hundreds of workers (including Transmigrators and hired locals) worked day and night on the river bank.

They built cofferdams, poured concrete, installed sluice gates...

A majestic dam rose from the river.

At the same time, the construction of the fortress was also underway.

Bei Wei designed a star-shaped fortress (Bastion fort). This kind of fortress has no dead ends and can maximize firepower advantages.

"This is our strongpoint in the interior." Bei Wei said, "It can control the traffic arteries of Lingao and protect our industrial zone."

Within the fortress, they built barracks, warehouses, command posts...

On the walls, they installed cannons and machine guns.

"With this fortress, we are impregnable!"

Next to the fortress, the planning of the industrial zone was also completed.

Steel plants, machinery plants, chemical plants... will be moved here one by one.

Bailaren Beach will become the industrial heart of the Transmigrators.
