# Chapter 1639 - Banditology

After this banquet, Huang Binkun was considered a "member" of this group of scholars. Only towards the end of the banquet did he learn that most of these scholars were members of the "Yuyuan Society," which claimed to "delve into essays, recite poetry, and compose fu," but was actually a group of people mixing together to eat, drink, play, write poems, and discuss national affairs.

This society had a loose organization. Members were not limited to students of the Nanhai County School; there were also *juren* like Liang Cunhou and scholars without degrees like Wu Ming. Among them, Lin Zunxiu was the financier, while Liang Cunhou was vaguely the leader among them.

A few days later, Huang Binkun was invited by Lin Zunxiu to his "villa" for recreation.

The Lin family's villa was at the foot of Baiyun Mountain, given the elegant name "Bamboo Garden," but was actually just a separate house in the mountain woods. The furnishing was ordinary, but the surrounding scenery was beautiful and the environment quiet. It was not far from Guangzhou City, allowing entry and exit from the city on the same day. Lin Zunxiu used this place as a gathering venue for Yuyuan Society members, especially the core members.

When Huang Binkun arrived here, he discovered Young Master Liang had already arrived. Seeing the slight smile at the corner of his mouth, he immediately understood that inviting him here must have been Liang Cunhou's idea.

This was a bit confusing. Although Huang Binkun knew that most members of the Yuyuan Society held good will towards the hair-bandits and intended to gain benefits from their rise, Young Master Liang's attitude was very ambiguous. Huang Binkun instinctively felt that his thoughts were more complex than those of other members.

Besides Young Master Liang, there were a few other scholars. Some he had seen at the restaurant, some hadn't been present at the banquet—that Scholar Shi and Wu Ming, who liked making shocking statements, were both present. Lin Zunxiu introduced them one by one.

After servants served tea and they chatted for a while, Scholar Lin got to the main topic.

It turned out that these few were all scholars obsessed with "Bandit Affairs." Among them, the one with the greatest interest was actually Young Master Liang, who rarely talked about "Australians" outside.

Speaking of historical connections with the Australians, in this Guangzhou City, he was probably second only to Gao Ju. Back when Guo Yi organized the charity hall and started businesses, the Liang family had contributed a lot. Later when the Ming army suppressed Lingao, the Liang family also secretly protected Guo Yi's properties and personnel remaining locally in many ways. So as soon as Guo Yi returned to Guangzhou, he had quietly gone to pay a visit.

However, their interaction was limited to this. The Liang family, being a family of officials for generations, was extremely cautious about interactions with Australians, unwilling to be tainted too much by their color. After all, associating with overseas people not only sounded bad but also easily courted disaster.

Although keeping a distance, Liang Cunhou had always been extremely interested in everything about the Australians. In his view, although the Australians' influence in Guangzhou City was increasing day by day, and there were many scholars talking about "Australians" and "Banditology," most were scratching an itch from outside the boot—no one truly understood the hair-bandits.

The Yuyuan Society group gave him a great opportunity to gather like-minded people to study the Australians—because of his status, it was inconvenient for him to openly discuss "Banditology" or collect hair-bandit materials everywhere. With the cover of the Yuyuan Society, it was much easier. Around him, a group of scholars obsessed with Banditology gathered. They used this place to discuss Banditology, collect various "Australian books," envisioning that one day they could organize "Bandit Affairs" to enrich the country and strengthen the army, supporting the Great Ming's restoration.

Huang Binkun was secretly alarmed—he hadn't expected such a group of people to exist in Guangzhou City! However, looking at their speech, they were neither like those scholars in the restaurant anxious to "follow the dragon," nor like the officials fearing bandits like tigers. Instead, they had some thoughts of "worrying about the country and the people."

*These are the talents I'm looking for!* Huang Binkun rejoiced secretly.

The topic started from a copy of the Australian book *Elementary Knowledge of Physics* that Scholar Lin had newly bought. The reason for buying this book was that they heard many of the Australians' "ingenious objects" were based on this. Actually, this book was based on popular science physics books, talking about mass, interaction of forces, conservation of energy—these most basic physics concepts. It contained no practical knowledge. For scholars who were always steeped in poetry and books, it was truly a bit too abstruse.

Because Huang Binkun had read Huang Ping's textbooks and heard him explain some of it, he could explain the whys and wherefores. Immediately, he selected what he knew and explained it in detail.

"Banditology is indeed abstruse," Lin Zunxiu shook his head, "It seems that to really start Bandit Affairs, specialized talents are absolutely necessary."

"Back then, Chief Manager Li wanted to buy a cannon factory from the Australians and hire craftsmen, but the Australians didn't allow it either." Scholar Shi said, "I think this matter is difficult."

"If he won't hire, can't we send people to learn!" Huang Binkun interjected.

"Go learn?" Several people stared wide-eyed.

"Exactly," Huang Binkun nodded, "The hair-bandits love to be teachers. They run schools in Lingao, teaching the learning of the hair-people. They collect children everywhere to enroll—this younger brother once sent a young page boy to learn the Bandit Learning."

"How did he learn?" Liang Cunhou was very concerned, "Did he learn the methods of building cannons and ships?"

"That is the highest learning within Banditology, he hasn't learned it yet. But this book," Huang Binkun pointed at *Elementary Knowledge of Physics* with his fan, "he understands everything in it."

"There is actually such a thing!" Lin Zunxiu was very excited, "I wonder if Brother Huang has connections? I also want to send a few page boys to learn Banditology!"

"Worthy Brother Lin, don't force others." Liang Cunhou said, "This matter can be discussed slowly later."

Huang Binkun hurriedly said: "The Australians inspect very tightly internally and externally; they generally don't accept outside students. But if one wants to find a way, it's not impossible, however..."

"However what? Could it be the tuition is expensive? That's no worry."

"It's not a matter of money," Huang Binkun thought of his own Huang Ping and couldn't help sighing, "Gentlemen may not know, Australians are most skilled at confusing people's hearts. A perfectly good child, if they enter their school, in just a year or two, becomes a 'Fake Bandit.' Forgetting the master, indifferent to ancestors, all kinds of heavenly principles and human feelings are cast aside—all become Australian learning, Australian rules..."

"Must find older, determined children who can read to go."

"Where to find such children!" Scholar Shi said, "Which family would be willing to send a child who can read to learn Banditology? If it's ordinary servants and page boys, who are dull and ignorant, if it's as Brother Huang said, wouldn't they also be confused after going..."

"It seems this matter is very difficult."

Speaking of Banditology, Lin Zunxiu had the greatest interest and considered himself the deepest researcher. He unconsciously launched into a high-flown discourse: "Hard to do, still must find a way to do it! Banditology is the urgent matter of the moment! Since the iron ship went north in the early years of Chongzhen, entered our Qiongzhou, and defeated our Royal Army, in just three or four years, they have become like a state. They build machines, repair warships, entice commoners to cross the sea to join them. The government cannot control them! This is indeed a great change unseen in three thousand years. China's bows, spears, and bird guns cannot match the hair-people's guns and cannons; China's boats and ships cannot match the hair-people's steam engine warships. Therefore, we are controlled everywhere. In today's situation, to talk extravagantly of expelling barbarians and driving them out of the borders is surely delusional talk. Even wishing to preserve peace and guard the territory, without guns, cannons, and warships, is empty talk. This student believes that the way of self-strengthening lies in mastering their skills and seizing what they rely on. Therefore, we cannot help but learn Banditology and manage Bandit Affairs. Set up cannon factories, build shipyards. These hair-people's guns, cannons, and warships are mostly made in Qiongzhou. The iron used is Chinese iron; the craftsmen are but exiled commoners. Yet they can hold these to invade and bully our Great Ming. If we can truly master their methods deeply, we can also build ships and cannons like the hair-people's. Perhaps we can even surpass them. At that time, we won't worry about not being able to exterminate the hair-bandits!"

Huang Binkun listened with rapt attention to this grand discourse, extremely appreciative of the argument "a great change unseen in three thousand years" that he raised. This was a deafening cry, a pity that the Emperor, the ministers of the central government, the governors, inspectors, and surveillance commissioners of various provinces couldn't hear this cry. Apart from one "Australian Goods," practically no one had truly realized the depth of the hair-bandits' schemes.

"Brother Lin, to summarize today's situation with the phrase 'a great change unseen in three thousand years' is very concise and moving. With this phrase as the tenet, you could very well write a great article using the content you just mentioned, circulate it, and let everyone under heaven be shaken."

"Hehe, if I wrote this article, the scholars under heaven would curse me to death." A helpless smile appeared on Lin Zunxiu's face, "Saying I'm 'alarmist' would be light; if they say I'm 'blaspheming sage learning,' I would be beyond redemption."

Liang Cunhou gently tapped his palm with his fan: "Worthy Brother Lin worries too much. Whether learning Banditology, managing Bandit Affairs, or borrowing their good methods and systems, there is a fundamental point to always remember: it must be based on our Chinese Confucian moral code. Take China's ethics and moral code as the foundation, supplemented by the hair-people's techniques of wealth and power."

"Exactly! Brother Liang speaks well!" Several people clapped in agreement, "So-called Banditology for utility, Chinese learning for essence. The Australians' strengths must be learned; the ancestors' mantle must not be discarded even more!"

Huang Binkun deeply agreed. Just as he was about to speak, Scholar Shi interjected: "Learning Banditology and managing Bandit Affairs—leaving aside whether we can exterminate the Australians, at least we can protect ourselves." Don't let Scholar Shi's image of an overweight man aloof from worldly strife fool you; when talking about matters, he had no ambiguity at all. "Back then when the Australians' troops approached Bai'etan and burned the Five Rams Station, our troops had no power to strike back. Fortunately, the Australians love commerce and value profit. Otherwise, I'm afraid this Guangzhou City would have fallen into their hands long ago!"

Wu Ming laughed coldly: "Is it not theirs now? I'm not being alarmist—if the Australians want this Guangzhou City, it would be as easy as lifting a hand."

"True, inside this Guangzhou City is a mountain of gold and a sea of silver."

"Then why don't they take it?" Liang Cunhou suddenly asked.

"For business." Wu Ming closed his fan with a snap, "It's not hard for the Australians to take Guangzhou. The hard part is once they take Guangzhou, they can't do business with the Great Ming. So what if there's a mountain of gold and a sea of silver in the city? What they value isn't money!"

Huang Binkun couldn't help chiming in: "What you say is extremely true! Although the hair-people say they love commerce and pursue profit, in reality, what they plot is not this!"

"Then what do they plot?"
