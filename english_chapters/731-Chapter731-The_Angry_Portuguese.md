# Chapter 731 - The Angry Portuguese

Because the Municipal Council and the Portuguese merchant group held sharply divergent views, the negotiations made no progress. Furthermore, Macau lacked an organized "Spanish Naval Detachment"; most armed vessels in the port were merchantmen. Except for a few light vessels belonging to the Municipal Council and the Governor of Macau, almost all were privately or corporately owned. With so many interests involved, the details requiring decision were numerous: shipowners were unwilling to serve the Municipal Council for free; even if willing, compensation for casualties, ship repairs, and ammunition costs had to be clearly apportioned.

The Jesuits, whose influence would be decisive in the final resolution, had yet to express their view—though everyone knew they favored the Australians, given the tremendous assistance the Australians had provided regarding missionary work in China. It could be called a breakthrough.

With the Jesuits' attitude ambiguous and the Municipal Council and Chamber of Commerce holding inefficient, lengthy debates day after day, Li Luoyou waited anxiously—nominally negotiating, but with nothing actual to discuss. Most of his time was spent waiting for the Portuguese to conclude their internal meetings.

His intelligence sources in Macau, however, became even more active: news of the Australians' military parades along the Pearl River kept arriving. Li Luoyou understood clearly: the Australians were conducting continuous small-scale military operations but refraining from directly attacking Wuchong, the gateway to Guangzhou, precisely to pressure the Guangdong authorities into speedy peace negotiations—forcing peace through war.

Synthesizing various intelligence gathered in Macau, Li Luoyou became more certain of his theory. Especially after learning that over a month ago, several Australians had come to Macau attempting to establish contact with Guangdong officials. These Australians were still lingering in Macau, seemingly waiting for something.

They must have conveyed a request for peace talks to Guangzhou or Zhaoqing through some channel, to which the Guangdong local authorities had made no response. That was why they launched the campaign into the Pearl River's inland waterways.

Li Luoyou secretly wrung his hands. If the highprovincial officials had reacted in time and privately sent someone to negotiate, perhaps this matter could have been concluded then and there, without escalating to this state.

Since the Australians had drawn their swords, they would not sheath them without blood. By the time peace was eventually negotiated, who knew how many more widows and orphans, how many wandering ghosts there would be, and how much wealth and housing would be torched.

He decided to find an opportunity to privately contact the Australian representatives to hear their specific conditions and thoughts. This way, once peace negotiations started, much travel time could be saved.

Gelaazzini spoke softly in his usual tone: "My child, do not rush. Speak slowly."

"Yes, Your Grace." Lando glanced at the Superior out of the corner of his eye. Only the old fox's calm was feigned; his hand had trembled just moments ago. Lando felt very confident about this matter.

"Your Grace, I obtained astonishing news in Lingao," Lando feigned great anxiety. "The Chinese court will soon revoke the right of merchants here to enter Guangzhou for trade, and will blockade the entire Pearl River estuary, forbidding foreign merchant ships from entering or leaving. They supposedly even intend to order local Chinese merchants to stop supplying Macau with grain, vegetables, and meat."

Gelaazzini had long heard rumors of such a trade ban; they had circulated in Macau for months. Initially just vague hearsay like "I heard trade might be banned." The Superior naturally wouldn't believe such baseless rumors, but they had gradually become more concrete, details accumulating until recently he learned that the advocate for banning Portuguese trade was Guangdong's highest judicial official.

Now, Lando not only repeated the rumor but stated specific details. Its credibility rose to over eighty percent—it no longer seemed groundless.

"My child, is your news reliable? There are at least thirty or forty such rumors in the city every day."

"Your Grace, absolutely reliable." Lando bowed. "I have already reported to the two Fathers, and they both believed it necessary for me to report to you personally. Here is their letter." He presented a letter written by Luruohua (Trigault). It not only confirmed Lando's account but specifically noted that Lando's source was a "high-ranking" Catholic Senator among the Australians—who expressed great concern for the safety of Macau, "the Church's lighthouse in the Far East," hoping the Portuguese would prepare in advance.

Lando added: The Australians not only knew the specific details but also possessed direct evidence.

Reading the letter, Gelaazzini frowned. Was this sowing discord? The Australians likely knew the Guangdong authorities sought Portuguese aid. If the Portuguese sided with the Ming, it would naturally be very disadvantageous for the Australian military operations in the Pearl River. Perhaps they revealed this news to the Lingao mission for this very reason.

He pondered. If the news proved true, there was absolutely no possibility of the Portuguese helping the Guangdong authorities. The Portuguese helped the Chinese maintain Pearl River security to protect trade, not to protect Ming subjects. If trade were interrupted by the Chinese government, then the lives of Chinese subjects and the safety of the Pearl River were of no concern to the Portuguese.

That the Australians revealed this so casually to the Jesuits suggested they held sufficient evidence to prove it, needing no circuitous means to verify their reliability.

Gelaazzini felt his back sweating. If Guangdong's highest judicial official had truly petitioned the Chinese Emperor to cut off trade, Macau's future was precarious. Leaving aside whether the Chinese would use various means to force the Portuguese out, what future did a city built on circulation and shipping have if it lost its primary—almost sole—trading partner?

Gelaazzini thought of several commercial cities he'd visited in Italy and the Netherlands that had declined due to geographical changes. Once-prosperous streets overgrown with grass enough to feed horses, populations falling to a tenth of the past. Beautiful merchant houses and mansions empty, doors boarded up. A scene of desolation.

He couldn't imagine Macau surviving if this happened—it was just a small island on a cape, unable even to feed itself. After trade was cut, the city would immediately decline into ruin.

The Jesuits would have to abandon this best missionary base at the gateway to South China and move to the distant Philippines, under Spanish control.

The thought made him shudder. He detested the Spanish—openly so. Needless to say what treatment awaited them in Manila.

"My child, do you have other evidence? Just this news alone will not satisfy the gentlemen."

"The Australian who revealed this said that if the Lords are interested, they will provide all evidence to prove it."

"I understand. Go and rest." Gelaazzini nodded.

After Lando left, Gelaazzini ordered Li Luoyou to be invited to the residence immediately.

"Jacob," Gelaazzini used his baptismal name, speaking directly. "I learned from a well-informed source that Guangdong's judicial official has submitted a memorial to the court requesting a total ban on trade with Macau. Do you know if this is true?"

"I am not clear, Your Grace." Li Luoyou was startled and unsure why he was suddenly summoned. Hearing the question he least wanted to answer, he forced himself to remain calm. "You know, this rumor has circulated for a long time. I am not an official and cannot judge its truth."

"And based on your insight and logic?" Gelaazzini pressed.

"This..." Li Luoyou hesitated, feeling that whatever he said might be impossible to justify later. Gelaazzini suddenly calling him for talk clearly meant he possessed important news, so he decided not to conceal it further.

"In my view, it is highly likely true." Li Luoyou nodded heavily. "Inspector Gao has always been dissatisfied with the Portuguese and the Holy Church. However, until now there were only rumors, no confirmed news."

"The Australians say they have sufficient evidence." Gelaazzini looked into his eyes. "Do you think they do?"

Li Luoyou had no answer. He realized his mission was likely about to fail. He thought briefly: "Superior, I wish to call your attention. Even if this matter is true, and Inspector Gao indeed wrote this memorial, it does not equal a court decree. After the memorial reaches the capital, it requires not only the Emperor's sagely decision but also discussion by the Grand Secretariat and the Six Ministries. If diverse opinions appear at any stage, Inspector Gao's memorial remains just a memorial. It cannot be viewed as a decree—it is equivalent only to a 'petition'."

Li Luoyou deliberately used the weakest European term.

Gelaazzini knew he was right. He pondered for a moment: "You know I respect you..."

"Thank you, Superior."

"...But I do not quite trust the words of Chinese officials. Before this, several members of the Municipal Council inquired about this matter with multiple powerful Chinese officials in Guangzhou and Xiangshan, and they all categorically denied it. Now it seems they were likely lying."

Li Luoyou didn't know what to say, though he knew it was likely instructions from above, probably Li Fengjie himself.

"...If this matter is true, I can only suggest the Municipal Council not provide any form of assistance to the Guangdong authorities. I think if you were in our position, you also could not agree to help." Gelaazzini said. "If merchants cannot trade, what relation does Pearl River security have to the Municipal Council?"

Li Luoyou answered painfully: "Yes, I fully understand your meaning."

"...Unless the Guangdong authorities can provide concrete clarification regarding Macau's future," he continued, "including guarantees for trade."

Li Luoyou knew that without concrete guarantees, this troop-borrowing talk would have no result. Clearly the Australians were playing tricks. He just didn't know what the Australians used to move the famously suspicious Jesuits. Wracking his brain in his residence: considering the authorities still had no concrete measures and only used feigned ignorance to delay, it was no wonder the Jesuits trusted the Australians instead of them.

A few days later, the Macau Municipal Council was thrown into uproar. A batch of carefully organized documents was released through the Jesuits. These documents included drafts of Gao Shunqin's memorial and translated copies of letters discussing the matter with the Six Ministries, the Grand Secretariat, Supervising Secretaries, and Censors in the capital.

These translations caused immense fear among the Municipal Council and Portuguese merchants—many had lived and traded in Macau for years, some were born there; their property, careers, and families were all on this tiny patch of land. Now suddenly told they might lose everything!

When they learned the Guangdong authorities were requesting their military aid while simultaneously petitioning the Emperor to expel them, the fury of the Municipal Council and Chamber of Commerce erupted. No matter how Li Luoyou explained the rules of Chinese officialdom—that Li Fengjie was only Governor and had no right to interfere with what Gao Shunqin said to the Emperor; and that Gao's memorial might not be approved—he was still cursed roundly. Many told him to "Get out!"

Li Luoyou complained bitterly in secret. Not only did the mission fail, but he, the representative, suffered collateral damage—his reputation was severely harmed.

He was summoned to the Governor's Palace, where the Governor clearly expressed his stance:

Unless the Guangdong authorities could provide official documents explicitly guaranteeing no interruption of trade, no ban on Portuguese entering Guangzhou for trade, and no use of supply cutoffs to force Portuguese departure from Macau, they would only then consider dispatching warships to patrol the Pearl River estuary to help the Ming expel the Australian detachment. Otherwise, the Portuguese would not interfere in either side's actions.

Li Luoyou naturally knew Li Fengjie would not provide this. If expulsion and trade severance were used as threats in the past to make the Portuguese submit, now that these threats were imminent realities, they no longer had any effect.

"Bastards! A bunch of corrupt, incompetent villains! Sage's disciples! Bullshit! A bunch of despicable, shameless scoundrels! This great land will be ruined in your hands sooner or later!" In Li Luoyou's Macau residence, a Chenghua porcelain cup shattered with his angry shout. Tea soaked into the expensive Persian carpet, leaving a large, striking stain.

The servants and maids were too frightened to enter—they had never seen the Master so angry. Li Luoyou stared at a painting of the Madonna and Child before him, trying to suppress his rage. He was truly too angry. Though he had anticipated such a result before departing, the experiences of these past days, combined with everything he had witnessed in Guangning years ago, generated immense doubt in him regarding this government, this system, and the people in power.

A wave of dizziness struck. Li Luoyou knew his illness was flaring up again. He quickly drank some medicinal wine—specially gifted by Liu San, very effective—struggling to calm his mind.

His activities in Macau were a total failure. Returning to Guangzhou was meaningless; Li Fengjie was likely another who wouldn't shed a tear until he saw the coffin. He decided to stay in his residence and play completely deaf and dumb. Since Governor Li hadn't sent a single subordinate in order to completely dissociate himself, it saved Li Luoyou much effort in concealment and dealing with others.

With borrowing troops failed, his resolve to find an opportunity to contact the Australians and discuss peace terms solidified. He dispatched capable servants to inquire about the Australians' residence and activities in Macau.

Li Luoyou's mission failed under Intelligence Bureau intervention, leaving the Pearl River Estuary Task Force with no rear concerns. The Navy naturally didn't fear the Portuguese great galleons, but the current target was the Ming; there was no need to make too many enemies and disperse forces.

After receiving the situation report from the Intelligence Bureau, Chen Haiyang transferred most warships remaining outside the estuary into the Pearl River channel, assembling at Humen. Meanwhile, the Marine detachment finished its month-long grand tour of the Pearl River Delta, returning to base for rest and reorganization, ship and gun repairs, preparing to break through Wuchong in one stroke and enter the "Provincial River"—the Guangzhou channel.

The waterway to Guangzhou went upstream past Wuchong to Huangpu Island—the site of Guangzhou's old port. Past Huangpu Island, the Pearl River was divided by Henan Island into two channels. Upstream along either channel led to Bai'etan (White Goose Pool).

Bai'etan lay southwest of the Ming city of Guangzhou, a confluence of three rivers where the West River, North River, and Pearl River met. The tides here were smooth, siltation light, and the river surface broad and misty. It had ample room to anchor the entire task force.

Chen Haiyang's military operation's final destination was Bai'etan, to posture a siege upon the city.

Of course, to lead the fleet to Bai'etan, a series of obstacles had to be breached. Besides Wuchong and Huangpu, multiple emergency batteries had been erected on Henan Island, mounting Red Barbarian Cannons. Many channels had also been blocked. Three lines of iron chains and timber rafts had been laid across the waterway to intercept ships.

Compared to the Pearl River channel, the Provincial River channel was much narrower, shallower, and filled with sandbars. These were manageable; Chen Haiyang most worried about several river sections already blocked. Although common sense told him blocking major river navigation was rarely successful—whether clogging the Pearl River in the Opium War or the Yangtze in the War of Resistance—most efforts were futile.

For prudence, he decided to specially equip and modify a vessel for clearing river channels. Though high in tonnage and volume, the *Great Whale* was a shallow-draft vessel with a wide deck and steam engine power. Modifying it to serve as a temporary clearing ship was more than sufficient.
