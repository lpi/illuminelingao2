# Chapter 98 - Work in Li Area (1)

After announcing the twenty-day busy farming holiday, the entire camp was jubilant. Many people asked Wu Nanhai if he could sell some rice directly instead of cooked rice, as they wanted to take it home. He agreed readily. It was sold at the price of one work point for 100 grams of mixed rice, the same amount as each portion of cooked rice. Sales of salted fish also increased a lot. Except for those who were already homeless and prepared to work wholeheartedly, almost all laborers spent all the work point coupons on hand.

Wu De didn't say much, only said that they had to return on time. If there was a delay, they must ask someone to bring a message, otherwise, work points would be fined at twice the number of days late for however many days late. In addition, he also asked laborers to bring words to various villages: anyone willing to come to do business or work is welcome here, guaranteeing the safety of their person and property.

At dawn the next day, laborers left happily in twos and threes, carrying small bundles wrapped in rattan and rags on their backs, containing salted fish and rice. Some were from the same village and traveled together. Wu Nanhai watched the backs of these people slowly disappear into the morning mist and couldn't help sighing—birds with nests can't be raised tame. To cultivate new farmers, we still have to start with orphans.

Just thinking, he suddenly saw Zhang Xingjiao also carrying a small bundle, leaning on a wooden stick, walking out slowly, so he greeted: "Mr. Zhang is also going back?"

Zhang Xingjiao had learned Mandarin quite well these days—he originally knew a little Mandarin. Hearing Wu Nanhai ask, he hurried bowed: "Chief Wu, I'm also going back for a trip, will be back in four or five days."

"Anyone else at home?" Wu Nanhai had heard about him from Wu De: his life experience was miserable, and there was nothing left at home.

Zhang Xingjiao smiled bitterly: "Where does this lowly one have any relatives," he touched the bundle, "When I was in trouble, I was taken care of by a few kind-hearted fellow villagers. Thanks to the Masters thinking highly of me and rewarding so many things, I take them back to give to people as a thank you for their kindness. In the future, this lowly one is yours even in death. Where the Masters go, this lowly one goes..."

Really a person with affection and righteousness. Wu Nanhai couldn't help looking up and down at this Daming scholar. Dressed in a tattered scholar's robe, hair all shaved unifiedly, now wearing a tattered hat on his head. Face pale gray, looking lost. It seems that "following bandits" is still a helpless choice for him.

Wu Nanhai remembered and hurriedly asked: "Mr. Zhang, are there any orphans in your village?"

"Orphans?" Zhang Xingjiao thought for a while, "There are, but they are raised within the clan, so they can't be counted as orphans."

"Oh." Wu Nanhai was a bit annoyed. He remembered that the clan society in ancient China actually exercised many social functions instead of the government. Especially in places like rural areas where the clan system is particularly consolidated, unless wars or famines cause displacement, it is difficult to adopt many orphans.

"There is actually a widow and orphan." Zhang Xingjiao thought for a moment, "Life is very bitter. Originally came from the mainland across the sea to reclaim wasteland. Unfortunately, the man died of plague, leaving the mother and daughter behind, sigh..." He kept sighing.

"Mr. Zhang, tell them, if they are willing to come, come to us to work."

This time it was Zhang Xingjiao's turn to be surprised: "Widow and orphan, can't do much work. The girl is still small, and the mother is not as capable as local women."

"It's okay. If the mother and daughter are willing, just bring them back."

Zhang Xingjiao hesitated for a moment, thinking there was no reason for these pirates to add mouths to feed for no reason. Even if buying slaves to work, naturally young and strong men and women are better; if for pillow service, naturally girls in cardamom years (13-14 years old) are needed. What use are such a middle-aged woman and yellow-haired child? Thinking so, he dared not ask more and went.

The captives all scattered. The work on Li people here also entered the final stage. After discovering eight Li captives from the interrogation, the Executive Committee discussed whether to use this opportunity to connect with local Li people. Various mineral resources needed by transmigrators are basically located in the inland of the island. Establishing a good relationship with Li people has practical significance.

Mu Min, who originally assisted Guo Yi in interrogation, applied for this task on her own initiative. The reason was simple: her ancestral home was Hainan Li ethnic group. Although migrated to Sichuan several generations ago and was essentially a Li ethnic group on the household register, due to her ethnic background, she knew something about Hainan Li ethnic group usually. She could be considered a rare professional among transmigrators who was relatively familiar with Li people.

Her understanding of her own ethnic group made it easy for her to dispel the wariness of several Li captives, and they told all about the local Li situation.

Several captives could speak Han dialect. From this point, transmigrators roughly knew they were "Shu Li" (Cooked Li/Civilized Li), that is, Li people who were registered households and paid taxes and served corvee. There were quite a few such Li people in various counties of Hainan. Mu Min communicated with them and knew they were the so-called "Bupei Li" (Note: This is indeed the self-proclaimed name of Shu Li in Lingao County in the past), highly sinicized, speaking Qiongzhou dialect—that is, Hainan dialect, which functions as a lingua franca in Hainan. Surnames also used Han surnames. According to their confession, thirty of them came. When the master in the county conscripted them, he promised each of them twenty jin of salt bars.

From questioning, it was known that most of them had some fields, but the yield was much less than that of Han people's land. Most people still had to rent some land from the Dong Lord (Cave Lord/Village Head), work short-term jobs, and go hunting in the mountains or collecting red and white rattan to sell in the market for salt, rice, and farm tools when nothing to do. However, going to the Han area not only had to pass the Patrol Inspection Division, but what was terrible was that there were Ming army camps on the way: lightly extorted for road money, heavily robbed of goods and even lives. Most people's lives were very bitter.

Besides the Patrol Inspection Division, there were troops guarding the road to the Li area. This news attracted the attention of the Executive Committee. Obviously, there were still Ming troops stationed in Lingao, just that their task was defense against Li. From the conversation, Mu Min felt that local Li people had quite a feud with the government. Thirty years ago, because of the riot in Tinan Village, official troops went to the Li area to suppress and killed many people indiscriminately. They also hated the Han peddlers in the market—mountain goods couldn't sell for much money, a wild boar couldn't even exchange for two or three jin of salt. They all liked Han people's iron farm tools, but the price was ridiculously expensive. Several large baskets of grain could only exchange for a sickle. Except for the Dong Lord and a few wealthy landlords, no one could afford it.

Mu Min's report let the Executive Committee know that the ethnic problem in Hainan was much more complicated than they thought. Someone proposed using the dissatisfaction of Li people with the government and Ming army to send a small detachment deep into the Li area through these eight captives to mobilize the masses. Not only could they gain an ally, but also a source of soldiers. Since they often couldn't even eat salt, recruiting soldiers would be much easier. Many people in the Military Team supported this suggestion, especially Wei Aiwen, who proposed the suggestion of recruiting Li and Miao warriors to establish a mountain infantry battalion, and enthusiastically promoted this suggestion. Establishing a new army of local people was obviously an extremely attractive idea. Since local Han people all had worries about "following bandits and attaching to rebels", it would be much easier to recruit Li people who didn't buy the government's authority and had hatred to be soldiers.

"Give them a part of the captured knives and guns, arm the Li people, so the Ming army can't deal with us." Wei Aiwen mentioned his package plan, "We can also help pull out a few Patrol Inspection Divisions leading to the Li area, annihilate those Ming troops, so we can gain their full trust." Then he recommended himself as the captain of the armed working team to the Li area.

This bold plan was immediately opposed by everyone. Although the Han-Li contradiction in Hainan in history had a large number of economic and political factors, the repeated killings between the two sides for many years had created deep ethnic contradictions. Now that 30 years of peace had finally been maintained, it would be extremely dangerous for transmigrators to break it or even provoke it. I'm afraid the entire Hainan would fall into social chaos by then. Before gaining a firm foothold, the small country with few people of the transmigrators couldn't maintain it even with Zenith Star technology.

After discussion, everyone agreed that the relationship with Li people is best maintained on a friendly tone. So-called friendly means neither hostile nor allied. Try to open up a traffic line, trade with each other, and exchange what one has for what one needs. Strive to recruit some new recruits in the Li area.

After such a keynote was set, a trade caravan was formed. The captain was Lu Rong, a Guangxi native who could speak Hakka, Hainan, Cantonese (Baihua), Leizhou, Zhuang, Minnan, Southwest Mandarin and other dialects. Sales background, eloquent, outdoor sports enthusiast, knew some martial arts, and just returned with the long-range reconnaissance and survey team, having certain experience in local field activities, very suitable for this job.

Mu Min accompanied the team as a "National Consultant". Wei Aiwen, as the main promoter of the recruitment plan, also joined this team.

The entire team consisted of twenty people. Everyone carried an SKS rifle, a machete, and a camping backpack. There were also exploration and measurement personnel accompanying the team.

The Diplomacy and Commerce Committee prepared gifts and some barter trade items. Knowing that the Li area lacked salt, the bulk goods were refined salt brought along, and some novel small gadgets—they were dealing with local Dong Lords, not poor common people, so there must be some ingenious things to move them.

"We killed more than twenty of their people. Should we give them some compensation? Give some silver to each person." Wei Aiwen remembered, "I remember that killing people in ethnic minorities can be resolved by paying life price."

"No need," Xiao Zishan opposed, "You figure out the cause and effect first. They joined the militia team to attack us first. Releasing people is already a very friendly gesture. Still paying life price? Please, we are not the Great Qing, ceding territory and paying indemnities after winning."

"Still killed their people—"

"Why suddenly so loving?" You Laohu, transferred from the Military Team to escort the team, retorted sarcastically, "Why didn't you want to pay life price for the hundreds of Han people who died on Bairen Beach that day?"

"Isn't this ethnic policy?"

"Not good," Lu Rong shook his head repeatedly, "Such ethnic policy is unwanted. We won and releasing people on our own initiative is enough. Paying life price will make people think we are weak and come to beg. If they raise the price, it will be a lion opening its mouth wide."

"I think so too," Xiao Zishan nodded repeatedly, "So-called equality is non-discrimination. Not discriminating against others, and even less discriminating against oneself. This keynote must be grasped well."
