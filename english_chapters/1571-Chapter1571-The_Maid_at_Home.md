# Chapter 1571 - The Maid at Home

"Don't talk nonsense, how do you know they're lip-syncing?" Qian Duoduo said.

"Isn't it obvious? Even if they're actually singing, the Senators aren't there to listen to songs anyway. Men, hmph, are all like the drunken man whose thoughts are not on the wine. Have you heard? Director Fang even went specifically to Chairman Wen to requisition silk stockings. Hahaha. I can't even imagine what Chairman Wen's expression was like at that moment." Zhang Yunmi was apparently picturing the scene and burst out laughing, unable to contain herself.

"He was definitely wearing a serious face while secretly delighted inside, thinking: more legs to look at." Lin Ziqi chimed in.

The girls all burst out laughing together.

The carriage stopped at Gate Three of the South Sea Farm. Lin Ziqi didn't want the school bus to make a special trip into the farm just for her, circling around for half an hour and wasting everyone's time, so she got off here.

South Sea Farm was in the Green Zone, so Lin Ziqi could walk alone without any safety concerns. No naturalized citizens other than farm employees and their families could enter here at all. Even naturalized personnel who came on business could only enter and exit the administrative compound with an access permit. Going anywhere else required applying for a special pass, and they had to be accompanied by designated personnel. The strict security protocols were not only to ensure the safety of the Senators—the farm was responsible for supplying food to the Senate, and many Senators came to the café for leisure—but also to ensure that the various seedlings and seeds on the farm were not stolen or damaged.

"Please take care, be careful on the road." The young soldier from the Guard Company politely held her hand and helped her down the steps.

"Thank you." Lin Ziqi beamed a smile. The Guard Company soldiers nowadays were all jointly selected by the General Staff Political Department, the Political Security Bureau, and the General Affairs Office. Not only were they required to be absolutely politically reliable—having served the Senate for over two years, having family members with good family relations residing and working in Lingao, possessing good military training, quick reflexes, and actual combat experience—but there were also considerable requirements for their appearance: height no less than 165 cm, proper facial features, loud and clear voice, and Mandarin proficiency of at least Level 2B.

These soldiers, who could be considered tall and handsome among the naturalized citizens, stood ramrod straight. Even wearing just the simple cotton uniform, they appeared capable, upright, and dashing.

"For the Senate and the People!" The soldier saluted, watching her walk through the farm gate before returning to his position on the rear footboard of the carriage. At the same time, three other soldiers maintained a state of alert, ready to draw their weapons at any moment.

Lin Ziqi nodded slightly in response to the salute from the Petition Police at the gate. Once through the gate, she was on a tree-lined path. The windbreak forests planted on both sides of the road had already achieved a modest scale. Farm workers wearing conical hats and work clothes streamed back and forth on the road, with horse carts and handcarts passing by from time to time. Some who recognized her would remove their hats from afar to greet her, and she didn't stint on smiles and words in return.

This stretch of road was quite long, taking nearly half an hour on foot, but Lin Ziqi declined her father's offer to send a rickshaw to pick her up—she didn't consider walking a burden. The fields, woods, and gardens on both sides of the road were like the most beautiful landscapes, and walking among them filled her with a happiness as if strolling through a painting.

After walking for over half an hour, the residential area of the farm finally came into view. From the outside, it looked like a clean, pretty village nestled among woods and fields. The main part of the village consisted of dormitories for the farm's naturalized cadres. Beside it was a separate small district where the Senators who worked at the Agricultural Committee lived, along with some Senators in the biology fields who had moved in due to their early service to the Agricultural Committee.

There was also a Guard Company duty station at the entrance to the Senator residential area. Wu Nanhai had originally felt this was somewhat disconnected from the masses and suggested using Petition Police instead, but the General Affairs Office disagreed, believing that close protection of Senators should still be handled by the Guard Company.

"Sister Ju, you're busy?" Ziqi spotted Sister Ju, the maid at Wu Nanhai's house, drying vegetables as soon as she entered the residential area.

Although every household here had a courtyard, the maids still preferred to dry vegetables in the public square: more room to spread out, better sunlight. So all the way in, dried vegetables were laid out along the roadsides and in the open spaces. If Wu Nanhai hadn't firmly banned it, there would have originally been large quantities of foul-smelling salted fish, fish sauce jars, and other preserved products drying here.

Sister Ju turned and saw it was Lin Ziqi. She hurriedly wiped her hands on her apron and greeted her with a smile.

"Oh, Ziqi, school's on break?" Wu Nanhai emerged from the small church at one end of the residential area, wearing a genial smile as he greeted her.

Ziqi's smile became even brighter. "Yes, Uncle Nanhai." She had always called Chu Qing "Sister," yet called Wu Nanhai "Uncle"—a small mischief of Ziqi's.

It wasn't even five o'clock yet. Although Wu Nanhai was one of the few "new good men" among the Senators, he rarely came home before work was officially over. This struck Lin Ziqi as a bit odd.

Overtime was routine in the Senate. Working several more hours after official hours was the "norm." Like the families of Lin Ziqi's neighbors, one usually couldn't see the masters of the house at all during normal hours—they all came home in the wee hours of the night. Every time Lin Ziqi saw their maids sweeping the front of the house or going out to buy things, she would speculate about their state of mind—were they lonely and desolate, neglected by their men, experiencing all sorts of emptiness, loneliness, and coldness...

This speculation only ended when the maids of these households, one after another, developed big bellies, and then some were seen holding babies. Clearly, they weren't as empty, lonely, and cold as she had imagined.

She returned greetings along the way, carefully avoiding the toddlers "running rampant" everywhere in their tottering steps, and arrived at the gate of her own courtyard.

Lin Ziqi's father, Lin Fatian, had been a horticulture technician at a landscaping company before the crossing. After D-Day, he was naturally assigned to the Agricultural Committee as an agricultural technician. His current official titles numbered seven or eight, but Lin Ziqi hadn't memorized a single one. That her father was a Senator, a "Chief"—that was enough.

The courtyard gate stood open. This was the one thing she most couldn't stand about her family's Life Secretary: the door was always open, she never knocked before entering a room, and no matter what you were doing, she'd just push the door open and walk in.

This Menglan—well, she wasn't bad-looking—which was why Lin Ziqi had been interested in giving her "a very nice, very poetic" name back then. But she apparently hadn't done well in the maid training class.

Yet if you scolded her, she'd just listen with her head bowed and tears welling up, and if you got a bit harsh, she'd simply kneel down. Once, when Lin Ziqi lost her temper, Menglan came over with tears in her eyes, holding a rattan cane, and knelt before her, presenting it with both hands. That taught Lin Ziqi what "bearing thorns to plead guilty" really meant.

"Attitude excellent, absolutely refuses to change"—after several such episodes, Lin Ziqi couldn't be bothered to nag about this issue anymore and just locked her door every time she returned to her room.

Fortunately, she was fairly nimble with housework, and her cooking was quite good. The hygiene habits Lin Ziqi had worried most about were actually decent too—according to Menglan, they'd been "beaten into her" with the cane. Every time Menglan spoke of her experiences in the maid training class—"who knows how many canes were broken," "beaten until she couldn't sit down, sleeping on her stomach every night," "tears shed by the jarful"—Lin Ziqi actually felt a bit sorry for her: when you thought about it, Menglan was only in her early twenties, just a few years older than herself. Though she naturally found her own father pleasing to look at, he was still a man in his mid-forties, tanned dark from working in the fields—hardly some handsome man.

If she herself had to marry a man of such appearance, Lin Ziqi would absolutely refuse.

But normally, one couldn't tell that Menglan had endured so much "suffering": she did her housework cheerfully every day, attended to her father with meticulous care, and when Lin Ziqi came home, served her the same way—if anything, even better. In short, no woman from the old spacetime, including her mother who had divorced her father, would ever, absolutely never serve her father this way. Lin Ziqi began to understand why her uncles, as well as her father, had risked their lives to come to this other spacetime.

Entering through the gate, the small courtyard wasn't large, but it was kept clean and tidy. The center was paved with flagstones, and flower beds lined the walls, planted with various flowers and ornamental plants. One flower bed contained various herbs—this was Ziqi's "little garden," though her father was now looking after it. In one corner was a wisteria trellis with a round table and rattan chairs beneath it, where Lin Fatian often sat to smoke, drink tea, and relax.

The courtyard also had several long stone tables displaying various bonsai trees—Lin Fatian's hobby. He would pick up good stumps whenever he found them and make a few pots. When he had too many, he'd give them away. His works were displayed in the Executive Committee and Senate office buildings.

Menglan was sweeping the courtyard. She was just twenty years old and had been Lin Fatian's Life Secretary for three years, living with them the whole time. She wasn't particularly pretty, but she was quite proper-looking with a medium build. The black and white maid outfit suited her well. Though Lin Ziqi knew this was a quirk of the Senators, as long as it looked good, she didn't mind.

Seeing it was the rarely-returning Young Miss, Menglan immediately set down her broom and came over to receive her, taking Ziqi's canvas bag. "The Chief did mention you'd be coming back. I thought it would be a bit later. How long is your break? You must be hungry? Dinner won't be for a while yet. Let me go get you some snacks."

"No need, I had some treats on the way. I'm not hungry now. I just have two days off. I may have to go back to school early. Is the bathwater ready?" Ziqi spoke as she walked.

The hot water supply in the Senator dormitories relied on copper heat exchangers installed inside the stoves, using wood or coal briquettes to heat the tap water. Similar to a gas water heater, but since Lingao lacked high-calorie gas, they had to rely on stove fuel like wood or coal briquettes for heating. This type of stove required adding fuel and heating up each time before use.

"Everything's ready. Would the Young Miss like to bathe now? I'll go add wood to the fire right away." Menglan followed behind her through the courtyard into the vestibule, immediately kneeling down to bring out grass-woven slippers and help her change out of her shoes.
