# Chapter 109 - New Education

"We can't lump adults and children together, right?"

"We can split them into two batches, day shift and night shift." Du Wen proposed her plan, "Children during the day, and change to adults at night."

"You can't do it like this." Wang Luobin shook his head repeatedly, "You haven't stayed in the countryside—children are also half a labor force in the countryside. If they all go to school during the day, the villagers definitely won't agree."

Du Wen thought about it and realized it was true. In comparison, she was more interested in adult night school: "Then half a day of class is fine, focus on the night school..."

"Even more outrageous." Before Wang Luobin could speak, Chen Haiyang shook his head vigorously, "When my relatives went to the countryside to jump the queue (work in rural areas) during the Cultural Revolution, night schools were also popular then, but they were all suspended during busy farming seasons—farmers have high labor intensity. After working all day, they need rest. Who would come to your night school?"

"Correct." Wang Luobin nodded repeatedly, "And before realizing the benefits of being literate, it's hard to attract them to learn."

Seeing that they all objected, Du Wen got a bit anxious: "Then we just don't do it?"

"Do it. Start a training class first, let's also have elite education." Xi Yazhou said half-jokingly.

The so-called elite education Xi Yazhou mentioned was actually a cadre training class. Such temporary short-term training classes were often used in local work in the past: cultivating activists close to the organization—although their purposes varied, through training to raise their awareness, enhance organizational discipline, learn working methods, and finally become the transmission gears driving the masses in countless grassroots organizations.

Of course, this is easy to say but not easy to do. Opening up a situation in a place is the hardest. Especially in a fairly closed and conservative traditional rural society. The crisis faced by the salt field gave the transmigrators an excellent opportunity to penetrate local society. In this regard, Great Household Gou was their meritorious contributor.

So who were the activists? There were the Tan father and son, Village Head Tan's daughter counted as one, and some young people who were friendly with Tan Chengqing. Single girls naturally found it inconvenient to attend class with a group of men at night, so initially, this night school only had men.

Wang Luobin was not eager to gather people formally. He just approached Tan Guihuang first, saying he wanted to run a school for the children to teach them reading and abacus. Tan Guihuang looked troubled, saying that children in the village usually had to help with farm work, and he feared parents wouldn't agree to let them go to school. Wang Luobin guaranteed that there would only be half a day of class daily, ensuring farm work wouldn't be delayed. Tan Guihuang barely agreed to talk about it. To be safe, Wang Luobin also sent Zhang Xingjiao to lobby. Xi Yazhou originally wanted to promise free lunch for children coming to study, but this was too difficult for the dwindling grain reserves.

In the end, quite a few children came. Although most people felt that their children studying was useless, knowing some characters and calculating accounts wouldn't harm a farming family. Moreover, school was only for half a day and didn't affect work in the fields.

The school curriculum was four hours of class every afternoon, starting from 12 o'clock and ending at 4 o'clock. However, the salt workers, like most ancient residents, rarely had a precise concept of time. To establish this concept, an electric loudspeaker was installed in the Ge Hong Temple camp, automatically playing once every hour: "It is now Lingao time X o'clock sharp"—Xi Yazhou knew that rather than instilling the concept of hours and minutes, such subtle influence was more useful.

The work team members invested great enthusiasm in this education plan. The curriculum arrangement highlighted simplicity and practicality. The main content at the current stage was literacy and calculation.

General Chinese reading requires mastering at least 500 basic Chinese characters, so Wang Luobin's literacy plan was based on 500 basic Chinese characters. For this school, he specially returned to Bairen City once and queried two suitable textbooks from the computer database of the Intelligence and Data Group: the 1959 edition of "Rural Literacy Textbook" and the 1971 edition of "Rural Practical Mathematics." Both were textbooks specifically edited for rural education back then, easy to understand and highly targeted. Especially "Rural Practical Mathematics," which not only had simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division but also practical contents like calculating yield per mu, volume calculation, and simple geometric measurement.

However, there were many words and sentences with strong era colors in these two textbooks, such as the frequent appearance of "Great Leader Chairman Mao" and "In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution..." Wang Luobin copied and rewrote overnight, finding Zhou Dongtian in the printing room and asking him to print 30 sets.

"30 sets?" Zhou Dongtian was also a bit stingy now—his paper reserves hadn't been replenished. And these were two books, not a document of a few pages or a tabloid.

"Yes, 30 sets, elementary textbooks. The sooner the better!"

Zhou Dongtian flipped through the draft and hesitated seeing many illustrations inside; just the workload of drawing these would be considerable. However, he promised to produce the finished products as soon as possible.

However, in the textbook, Wang Luobin added the teaching content of Hanyu Pinyin from elementary school Chinese language—Wang Luobin always believed: Simplified characters and Hanyu Pinyin were the two magic weapons for New China to popularize basic education.

He showed this set of textbooks to Zhang Xingjiao, and as expected, encountered opposition from this middle-aged Tongsheng (entry-level scholar). In Scholar Zhang's view, these "vulgar characters" were not shocking, but as education, he opposed including "vulgar characters" in textbooks—"Misleading the children," he commented.

Wang Luobin said this was mainly to simplify education and facilitate children's reading and writing. Besides, their purpose in educating these children was not for taking imperial examinations or composing poems and couplets, but just to be able to write names, write letters, and read some simple books.

However, Zhang Xingjiao still felt quite awkward. Actually, he recognized almost all these simplified characters. In his view, simplified characters could only be used for utility, not for the main body: "Students taught by you like this will make people laugh to death. The articles written will be full of vulgar characters. Even if others don't laugh, we would be ashamed to be teachers." Speaking of this, he got emotional, seemingly wanting to defend traditional characters to the death.

Zhang Xingjiao also disapproved of the literacy textbook. In his view, the Three Character Classic, Thousand Character Classic, and Hundred Family Surnames were enough for elementary education; newly compiled books were superfluous. Seeing the beautifully printed literacy textbook, he cried out it was a pity—and criticized many phrases and sentence structures in the textbook as "ungrammatical."

After enduring Zhang Xingjiao's nitpicking for more than an hour, Wang Luobin proposed a fair competition to him: both lead a class to see who learns to recognize and write characters first. This stunned Zhang Xingjiao. He carefully looked at the literacy textbook again and said after a long while: "Your set of simplified characters saves trouble in both recognizing and writing; naturally, you have the advantage..."

"Correct, our set of simplified characters has the advantage of being easy to learn and remember. The populace doesn't need profound learning; literacy is just to facilitate life." Wang Luobin explained patiently. Zhang Xingjiao was the first intellectual they had deep contact with. His attitude roughly showed what kind of views Ming Dynasty intellectuals held towards the transmigrators' culture.

After some persuasion, Wang Luobin took a step back: proposing to teach simplified characters and traditional characters simultaneously. Zhang Xingjiao was still reluctant, but seeing these people from overseas running a school for poor children, their hearts were commendable. Besides, he was making a living under them and couldn't make things too stiff. Thinking of this, he finally agreed to assist Wang Luobin in teaching. Ancient scholars more or less still had a sense of responsibility to educate the common people, unlike modern ones who go to be teachers for the guaranteed income and winter/summer vacations.

But for Wang Luobin, he was dissatisfied. He failed to truly persuade a petty intellectual of the Ming Dynasty to accept his arguments.

To avoid interference, in the initial stage, he started teaching from Pinyin letters, teaching children the pronunciation of Pinyin letters—mastering Pinyin meant mastering the correct pronunciation of Mandarin. After all, the transmigrators were going to use Mandarin for education. Children's language learning ability is far superior to adults', getting twice the result with half the effort in education.

In Zhang Xingjiao's view, Wang Luobin's teaching method was completely inconceivable. For a Confucian scholar like Zhang Xingjiao, the enlightenment education method received since ancient times was cramming. Students entering school first started reading the Three Character Classic, Thousand Character Classic, Hundred Family Surnames, and Poems for Child Prodigies. Learning to write was tracing red characters with a brush. The teacher basically didn't explain, just led the children to read a passage every day, letting children read aloud and recite repeatedly. Such teaching generally didn't end until finishing the "Four Books." Ordinary students could recite the Four Books backwards and forwards, and recognized almost all the characters.

But Wang Luobin's class started teaching from squiggly things like ghost talismans that he completely didn't understand, saying "a, o, e, i," and made many beautiful cards: the letter 'e' was a goose (é), teaching the sound very intuitively. Students remembered these things as if singing songs, and then used these characters to mark the pronunciation of each word. Seeing this use, Zhang Xingjiao suddenly realized that the Pinyin letters Chief Wang talked about all day were used for phonetic notation, similar to the fanqie (reverse cut) method learned by scholars. (Note: Ancient people had various methods to mark pronunciation, the most common being fanqie. Learning ancient Chinese requires studying this in Chinese departments.)

However, Zhang Xingjiao also admitted that after learning this set of "Pinyin letters," recognizing new characters became much faster. Even some smarter children could recognize characters by themselves directly according to the Pinyin marked in the textbook. This quick method interested him greatly, and he repeatedly asked Wang Luobin which great scholar came up with this. Wang Luobin said this set of Pinyin and simplified characters were researched by a great overseas scholar named "Wen Kaiwei" (Note: Likely a pun or reference to Wen Desi, perhaps) who exhausted his life's effort—the purpose was to enable all Huaxia people under heaven to read and write. Such a great ideal made Zhang Xingjiao feel deep respect.
