# Chapter 109: New Education

"Can't we lump adults and children together?"

"We could do two shifts—day and night," Du Wen proposed. "Children during the day; switch to adults at night."

"That won't work," Wang Luobin said, shaking his head repeatedly. "You've never lived in rural areas—children are half a labor force there. Parents definitely won't agree to full-day schooling."

Du Wen realized he was right. Comparatively, she was more interested in adult night school. "Then half-day classes, focus on night school..."

"Even worse." Before Wang Luobin could speak, Chen Haiyang was already shaking his head vigorously. "My relatives *went down to the countryside* back then—night schools were popular too, but during busy seasons they all closed. Farmers work hard labor all day; they need rest. Who'd come to your night school?"

"Right," Wang Luobin agreed. "Plus, until they recognize education's benefits, attracting them to study is very hard."

Du Wen, seeing opposition, grew anxious. "So we just don't do it?"

"We'll do it—start with a training class. Let's do some elite education," Xi Yazhou joked.

Xi Yazhou's "elite education" was actually cadre training. Such short-term intensive courses were commonly used in past local work: cultivating organization-friendly activists—though with varying motivations—raising their consciousness through training, strengthening organization and discipline, and teaching work methods. Ultimately, they'd become transmission gears driving the masses in countless grassroots organizations.

Of course, saying this was easy; doing it wasn't. Breaking into a locality was the hardest part—especially in a closed, conservative traditional rural society. The salt field's crisis gave the transmigrators an excellent opportunity to penetrate local society. In this sense, Landlord Gou was their benefactor.

Who were the activists? The Tan father and son; the village head's daughter counted too; also some young men friendly with Tan Chengqing. Single girls naturally couldn't attend evening classes with a group of men, so initially this night school was men-only.

Wang Luobin wasn't anxious to formally convene everyone. He first approached Tan Guihuang, saying he wanted to run a school for children—teaching literacy and abacus basics. Tan Guihuang looked troubled—village children had daily farm chores; getting parents to agree to schooling would be hard. Wang Luobin promised only half-day classes—guaranteed not to interfere with farmwork. Tan Guihuang reluctantly agreed to try convincing people. For insurance, Wang Luobin also sent Zhang Xingjiao to persuade. Xi Yazhou originally wanted to promise free lunch for attending children—but this was too much strain on dwindling grain reserves.

The turnout wasn't bad. Most people, though believing their children's education was useless, thought literacy and arithmetic wouldn't hurt farming. Plus, schooling was only half a day—not affecting field labor.

The school schedule was four hours each afternoon—noon to 4 PM. But salt workers, like most ancients, had little precise time sense. To build this concept, the Ge Hong Temple camp installed an electric loudspeaker that automatically announced hourly: "This is Lingao time, X o'clock"—Xi Yazhou knew that rather than lecturing about hours and minutes, such subtle influence was more effective.

Work team members invested great enthusiasm in this education plan. The curriculum emphasized simplicity and practicality—current content focused on literacy and arithmetic.

Basic Chinese reading required mastering at least 500 characters, so Wang Luobin's literacy plan was based on 500 fundamental characters. For this school, he specially returned to Bairren Fortress, querying the Intelligence Group's computer database for two suitable textbooks: the 1959 edition *Rural Literacy Textbook* and the 1971 edition *Rural Practical Mathematics*. Both were specially compiled for rural education—accessible and targeted. The mathematics book particularly included not just basic arithmetic but practical content like yield calculation, volume measurement, and simple geometric surveying.

However, both textbooks contained heavy period-specific language—frequent "Great Leader Chairman Mao" and "In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution..." Wang Luobin copied and revised them overnight, then asked Zhou Dongtian at the printing room for 30 sets.

"30 sets?" Zhou Dongtian had become stingy—his paper reserves hadn't been replenished. And these were two books, not a few pages or a small newspaper.

"Yes, 30 sets—elementary textbooks. As fast as possible!"

Zhou Dongtian flipped through the draft, seeing many illustrations that would be quite laborious to produce. But he promised to deliver finished products as soon as possible.

Wang Luobin also added Pinyin teaching content from elementary Chinese—he'd always believed simplified characters and Pinyin were New China's two treasures for universal basic education.

He showed this textbook to Zhang Xingjiao, unsurprisingly drawing opposition from this middle-aged failed-examination scholar. In Zhang's view, these "vulgar characters" weren't too shocking, but as education, he opposed including "vulgar characters" in textbooks. "This misleads students," he commented.

Wang Luobin explained this was mainly to simplify teaching, facilitating children's reading and writing. Besides, their educational purpose wasn't imperial examinations or poetry composition—just writing names, writing letters, and reading simple books.

Yet Zhang Xingjiao still felt awkward. He actually recognized almost all these simplified characters—in his view, simplified characters could only be used casually, not formally. "Students taught this way would be laughingstocks—compositions entirely in vulgar script. Even if others don't laugh, we'd be ashamed as teachers." Growing agitated, he seemed ready to defend traditional characters with his life.

As for the literacy textbook, Zhang Xingjiao was also dismissive—in his view, *Thousand Character Classic* and *Hundred Family Surnames* were sufficient for children's education. New compilations were unnecessary. Seeing the beautifully printed textbook, he lamented—and criticized many phrases and sentence structures as "grammatically incorrect."

After enduring Zhang Xingjiao's critiques for over an hour, Wang Luobin proposed a fair competition: each would teach one class to see who learned to read and write faster. This startled Zhang Xingjiao. He re-examined the literacy textbook carefully. Finally, he admitted, "Your simplified characters are easier to recognize and write—naturally you'd win..."

"Exactly. Our simplified characters are easy to learn and remember. Common people don't need advanced scholarship—literacy is just for convenient living," Wang Luobin patiently explained. Zhang Xingjiao was their first deeply contacted intellectual—his attitude roughly indicated how Ming intellectuals viewed transmigrator culture.

After much persuasion, Wang Luobin compromised, agreeing to teach both simplified and traditional characters simultaneously. Zhang Xingjiao still wasn't entirely willing, but these overseas people establishing schools for poor children was already commendable. Besides, he was eating their rice—he couldn't be too difficult. Ancient scholars at least had some sense of responsibility for educating the masses—unlike modern people who became teachers purely for stable pay and summer vacations.

But for Wang Luobin, this was unsatisfying. He hadn't truly convinced a Ming junior intellectual to accept his viewpoint.

To avoid interference, he initially started with Pinyin letters—teaching children pronunciation. Learning Pinyin meant mastering correct Mandarin pronunciation. After all, transmigrators would use Mandarin for education. Children's language-learning ability far exceeded adults'—teaching was doubly effective.

To Zhang Xingjiao, Wang Luobin's teaching methods were utterly bizarre. Zhang and his kind—Confucian scholars—had always received infusion-style education. Students began with *Three Character Classic*, *Thousand Character Classic*, *Hundred Family Surnames*, and *Children's Poetry*; writing meant tracing red models. Teachers rarely explained—just led daily readings for rote memorization. This continued until finishing the *Four Books*. Most students could recite the *Four Books* backwards and recognize most characters.

But Wang Luobin's classes started with completely incomprehensible squiggly "ghost writing"—*a*, *o*, *e*... He'd made beautiful flashcards: *e* was a goose—intuitive pronunciation teaching. Students learned these like songs. Only then were these symbols used to annotate characters. Realizing this purpose, Zhang Xingjiao suddenly understood—so this "Pinyin alphabet" Chief Wang constantly mentioned was for phonetic annotation, similar to the scholars' *fanqie* method. *(Note: Ancient Chinese phonetic annotation used various methods, most commonly *fanqie*—a required subject for Classical Chinese majors.)*

Still, Zhang Xingjiao admitted: after learning this "Pinyin system," learning new characters was much faster. Some clever children could even sound out characters directly from textbook annotations. This quick method fascinated him. He repeatedly asked Wang Luobin which great scholar invented this. Wang Luobin said both Pinyin and simplified characters were developed by the overseas great scholar "Wen Gaiwei" *(Wén Gǎiwéi = "Literary Reform Committee")*—his life's work—aiming for all Chinese everywhere to be literate. Such a grand ideal earned Zhang Xingjiao's deep respect.
