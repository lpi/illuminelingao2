# Chapter 40: The Prophet

After a few pleasantries, he took his leave. Returning to the base, Manager Sun of the Qiwei Escort Bureau had been waiting for some time. Before Xiao Zishan could bow in thanks, Manager Sun was already bowing in congratulations. Xiao Zishan paid out one hundred taels of silver as a token of gratitude.

"The shopkeepers truly excel in both civil and martial arts!" Manager Sun took the silver with a smile like a blooming flower. "Such skill! Such fierce weapons! My disciples and nephews all said they'd seen hostage rescues before, but never one so clean and swift."

"Without the help of Qiwei's experts, we strangers would still be fumbling in the dark."

"Please—Qiwei only did its modest part." Manager Sun handed the silver to a junior disciple behind him. "I have something to say—please consider it, Shopkeeper Xiao."

"Please speak."

"Though the rescue went smoothly, the criminals have been here before and know the layout. Guard against retaliation. As the saying goes: a thief may commit crime one day, but no one can guard against thieves for a thousand days. With so many valuables here, you must be careful."

Xiao Zishan couldn't quite discern his intentions. Having just been tricked by the fox Gao Ju, Manager Sun's smile now also seemed fox-like. He remained warily silent.

Seeing him not respond, Manager Sun had to be direct: the Qiwei Escort Bureau was willing to provide night-watch services for the residence—essentially acting as night-shift security. Besides store-sitting, this was an escort bureau's main city business.

Night-watching wasn't the same as being household guards. The bureau didn't concern itself with daytime affairs. Only after the evening watch, when each room in the residence was latched and lit, would the guards enter to patrol.

"If the shopkeepers find that inconvenient, you could buy a few servants, and we'll train some good hands for personal protection."

So he was selling security services. Xiao Zishan thought night security probably wasn't a good idea—too many secrets in this residence. Escort guards were shrewd and capable; over time, they'd inevitably notice things. Training guards, however, could be useful—but he couldn't decide on his own.

But the Qiwei Escort Bureau connection was something the Executive Committee had decided to fully utilize. Currently, Gao Ju was their only agent, and their social reach was too narrow. By comparison, escort bureaus interacted with all levels of society—from high officials to bandits and thugs. They knew everyone and could deal with everyone. This would be very convenient for the transmigrators' future work.

Compared to other professions and social classes, escort-bureau personnel were the most traditionally virtuous—valuing trust and righteousness. Once won over, they would be reliable allies.

To win someone over required showing favor. But escort guards weren't ordinary people. Though they "pointed spring" and "made friends" with bandits for their livelihood—that was just to make a living. In reality, they were very careful about friendships. Trying to win goodwill through lavish spending wouldn't work; they might even be labeled a "mark" and looked down upon.

Fortunately, China had always been a society of personal relationships and clan ties. The bonds between relatives, clans, and master-disciple relationships were strongest. Working through these would be easier.

Following the approach the Executive Committee had discussed, Xiao Zishan said: "Sun Chang contributed greatly to this affair. We've discussed freeing him from bondage."

"This is tremendous grace." Manager Sun rose and bowed deeply. For slaves, freedom wasn't necessarily a good thing—especially if, after being freed, there was nowhere to go and the master refused to keep them. It could be a death sentence. But regardless, Sun Chang was both his clan nephew and martial nephew; his servile status reflected poorly on this senior uncle.

"He earned this grace himself." Xiao Zishan deliberately glanced at Gao Xian, who was serving tea nearby. "A servant who doesn't shrink from trouble when the master is in danger, who steps up and contributes—naturally shouldn't be mistreated."

He continued: "Though Sun Chang will be freed from servitude, he's loyal and capable. If he's willing, we'd still keep him on staff."

"You're too kind to this boy." Manager Sun looked moved. Even if the bureau's business improved enough to add him as a guard, he'd just be running escort routes his whole life. Staying with the Australian shopkeepers held far better prospects than being an escort guard.

"When he's out running errands, please look after him as an elder."

"Naturally." Manager Sun readily thumped his chest. "Whatever the shopkeepers entrust is Qiwei's business. We'll do our best."

Good—things were starting to click. Indeed, family matters were handled more wholeheartedly.

He gestured for Gao Xian to withdraw, then continued: "There's also Gao Di. You've met him—a young servant here. We've assigned him to gather market news. He's extremely clever and smart. But I worry he's too young; spending too much time in the streets might lead him astray. Also, without martial skills, he could get hurt. Please have Qiwei train and discipline him. Though an escort bureau deals with all sorts, they're notably upright. Entrusting him to you puts our minds at ease."

"The shopkeeper flatters us." Manager Sun brightened visibly—the Australian shopkeepers really respected them.

Seeing the moment was right, Xiao Zishan said no more. Both sides exchanged a few pleasantries and parted.

That evening, Xiao Zishan crossed back to report the situation to the Executive Committee. Whether to allow Gao Ju credit sparked debate—both sides had compelling arguments, and neither could convince the other.

Yu Eshui's comment offered a new approach.

"What month is it over there now?"

"The thirtieth of the fourth month."

"The thirtieth of the fourth month in the seventh year of Tianqi." Yu Eshui nodded. "In eighteen days, Emperor Xizong will go pleasure-boating at the West Garden after sacrificing at the Fangze Altar. Wind will capsize the boat, and he'll fall into the water. Though rescued by Tan Jing, his health will decline from then on."

"He doesn't die until the eighth month. Are you suggesting Gao Ju delay the shrine project until August? Even if you play prophet, you can't possibly make him bold enough to wait for the emperor to die." Quick minds already understood his thinking.

"Heh, you underestimate bureaucrats' sensitivity to political winds." Yu Eshui said. "Why did Wei Zhongxian become the 'Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Years'? Because of the emperor's favor. His entire fortune depends on Emperor Xizong's life and death. Tianqi was never healthy; after this incident, he never recovers. Once the emperor dies, Prince Xin will inevitably succeed. Wei Zhongxian, even if not toppled, couldn't wield power like during the Tianqi reign. In that case, bureaucrats won't rush to declare allegiance when the situation is unclear.

"This Eunuch Yang isn't part of Wei Zhongxian's faction—he just wants to curry favor while he can. If the situation suddenly becomes uncertain, he'll be the first to postpone. By not building the shrine, he maintains the status quo. If he builds it and the emperor dies with a new lord ascending, things will almost certainly reverse. Why would he make trouble for himself?"

"You think Wei Zhongxian will just watch Prince Xin take the throne? We know Tianqi was followed by Chongzhen, but those bureaucrats don't."

"Tianqi has no heir—naturally it goes to a brother." Someone explained.

"Actually, Tianqi had three sons in total, but none survived to adulthood. According to historical records and modern scholars, the princes were likely killed by Wei and Madam Ke. By the seventh year of Tianqi, his youngest son had been dead two years. Once the emperor fell ill, the only one to inherit was his brother, Prince Xin, Zhu Youjian.

"Though Tianqi was foolish, he was devoted to Empress Zhang and his fifth brother Youjian. Wei Zhongxian once tried to fabricate a major case implicating the empress's father, Zhang Guoji, in 'plotting to install Prince Xin'—to strike at enemies. The eunuch Wang Tiqian, knowing the emperor's temperament, dissuaded him: 'Our lord is confused about everything except brother and wife. If anything goes wrong, we're all dead.' Wei Zhongxian was terrified and immediately abandoned the plan. This shows everyone knew how much Xizong trusted the empress and Prince Xin. Unless Tianqi had another heir, if the emperor died, Prince Xin's succession was certain. The bureaucrats understood this perfectly."

"Once the emperor falls ill, Wei Zhongxian's blue-chip stock in the Ming market becomes shaky, and Prince Xin's potential stock gets bullish. Who would heavily buy stock that might plummet below issue price or be delisted tomorrow?"

"So I should tell Gao Ju to delay past the eighteenth of the fifth month?"

"News won't travel that fast. It takes at least ten days for Beijing news to reach Guangzhou. Better to tell him to wait until month's end—the outcome will be clear then."

"Hehe, though I'm not fond of playing prophet, I think on this matter we can show a little predictive ability—explicitly state that on the eighteenth of the fifth month, there will be major changes in court politics. Predicting the future holds powerful allure for anyone—especially such major political upheaval. Once verified, the impact could be tremendous. It won't make anyone immediately bow and swear allegiance, but it can powerfully reinforce that we're following Heaven's mandate." Yu Eshui said with a smile.

This solution was not only clever but greatly satisfied the transmigrators' appetite for playing "prophet." Soon someone suggested Yu Eshui act as "prophet" and meet directly with Gao Ju and Little Yang. Others proposed he go to Beijing and find Cao Huachun—perhaps they could earn credit for supporting Chongzhen's enthronement, and the transmigrators could use modern technology and ideology to directly reform the emperor, leading China into a democratic, harmonious, prosperous Ming utopia...

Yu Eshui immediately lost his appetite. Did these people think the Eastern Depot and Embroidered-Guard were deaf? Such "heretical speech" about the emperor's life and death—they'd immediately be dragged to the imperial prison to sample the eunuchs' tortures. Even if Cao Huachun were willing to listen to such ravings, Prince Xin was currently keeping a very low profile, barely seeing even close attendants—much less some "prophet"! If this resolution passed, whoever wanted to be a prophet could go—he wasn't joining this circus.

Fortunately, hotheads were few, and the wild proposal didn't pass. Yu Eshui then offered some practical details: don't speak too plainly, lest Gao Ju get frightened. Fear could trigger unpredictable reactions. Just say there would be major changes on the eighteenth of the fifth month. And don't claim personal knowledge—say someone had "read the celestial signs" and whatnot. Keep it vague and mysterious.

"One thing to absolutely remember: don't say Wei Zhongxian will be toppled or when the emperor will die. Such earth-shaking words will definitely reach Little Eunuch Yang through Gao Ju. Given their nature, to earn merit or avoid disaster, they'd immediately report and have you arrested!" Yu Eshui emphatically warned them at the end.
