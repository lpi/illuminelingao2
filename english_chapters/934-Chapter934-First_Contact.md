# Chapter 934 – First Contact

The team members were also smoking and chatting in twos and threes, getting ready to sleep. A few were organizing today's survey data by the firelight. But as night fell, they heard suspicious growling sounds.

To ensure the group passed the night safely, the survey team built up a roaring bonfire and set trip-wire signal mines around the perimeter. Soldiers and team members took turns standing guard, constantly adding large amounts of fuel.

In the darkness, they seemed to see beasts prowling stealthily around the camp from the brush, and the two military dogs barked occasionally. But the night passed peacefully. The next morning, they were all up by 5:00 AM, ready to hit the road again.

After consulting, Qian Shuixie and Liu Zheng decided not to return the way they came, but to take a different route down the mountain, allowing them to see more of the local conditions.

After hacking their way down Dagou Mountain and resting briefly, they pushed inland along a small river. Being summer, the water volume was abundant and the current swift. Liu Zheng thought the agricultural conditions here were far better than Lingao—just the water resources were much richer. No wonder Wu Nanhai and his lot thought about this "Treasure Island" every day.

The survey team marched along the riverbank. Without dense vegetation, the team's speed increased significantly. Shortly after 8:00 AM, the two military dogs leading the column suddenly barked furiously.

"Attention, enemy activity!" Qian Shuixie shouted. "All units alert!" As he spoke, he swiftly clicked off the safety of the submachine gun on his shoulder, unfolded the stock, and dropped to a half-kneeling firing position.

Before his voice faded, a chaotic roar erupted from the grass and woods. Then, fifty or sixty almost naked natives, waving weapons and howling, charged violently from the brush and trees.

Qian Shuixie pulled the trigger the instant he saw dark brown figures lunging from the grass.

"Back to back! Open fire!" he roared without looking back. The Special Reconnaissance Team had gone through thousands of drills, turning all tactical movements into instinctive bodily reactions.

Gunfire instantly erupted around him. Acrid gunpowder smoke assaulted his nose. The gunstock tapped lightly against his shoulder—the recoil of the .22 caliber submachine gun was very light, and Qian Shuixie easily controlled the muzzle climb. His second burst knocked down a native holding a spear and shield.

Qian Shuixie had participated in many shooting competitions and training sessions, firing at all kinds of human-shaped targets, but he had never shot at a living person. At first his shooting was a bit panicked, but he quickly controlled his emotions, steadied his body, and constantly shifted his aim, harvesting the charging ambushers with three-round bursts. Under the gunfire, men stumbled and fell continuously; others let out great howls and turned to flee into the deep grass.

Although the .22 LR was a low-power police round, firing at nearly naked living people at less than 50 meters turned into a one-sided slaughter. The gunfire lasted less than two minutes. The riverbank became a bloody slaughterhouse, with over twenty corpses and dying men lying in disorder. The ambushers had vanished completely.

"Cease fire!" Qian Shuixie shouted. The gunfire stopped. The riverbank fell instantly deathly silent, save for the sound of wind blowing through grass and branches.

"Are they natives?" Liu Zheng was still shaken. Though a veteran trekker with some military training, his reaction to sudden situations was much slower. He had only managed to draw his Glock 17 and fire two rounds before the battle ended. The enemy had disappeared as quickly as they came. The survey team members dared not rashly chase into the grass, maintaining their hastily formed circular defense formation.

Qian Shuixie nodded. "Definitely." He scanned the riverbank; all was quiet. The two military dogs were snorting, eager to give chase, but they weren't barking anymore, indicating the enemy had gone far.

"Check casualties!" He lowered the muzzle of his submachine gun.

"No casualties," the NCO replied.

"Recover shell casings!" Qian Shuixie stood up, his finger off the trigger but still outside the trigger guard, ready for any sudden developments. "Search the battlefield!"

Hot shell casings were collected into specialized bags by designated personnel, while team members covered each other as they began inspecting the bodies on the riverbank.

All the bodies were male. By the standards of this era, they could be called tall, sturdy, and strong, with aesthetically pleasing physiques—quite unlike the imagined short, wretched appearance of Austronesian natives. Except everyone had pierced ears with huge wooden plugs.

"These must be the so-called Takau people," Qian Shuixie said. The corpse at his feet lay face down on the river pebbles; the water flowing beneath was stained red. These men were almost naked; aside from small woven-rattan and wooden shields, they had virtually no defensive means.

"These should be javelins," Qian Shuixie looked at the weapons collected by the team. Most were ordinary bamboo or wooden spears. Some bamboo javelins were thin and flexible; he weighed one in his hand and felt the balance was quite good. If thrown in a volley, they would inflict considerable damage. Besides these, there were a few stone axes and iron knives—very crude, probably flowed in from the mainland. Qian Shuixie didn't think they likely had smelting capabilities.

"Why did they ambush us?" Liu Zheng was still a bit shaken.

"We are strange outsiders. To them, that means dangerous enemies." Qian Shuixie thought that not just in the constantly conflicted coast of 17th-century Taiwan, but even in the deep backwoods of 21st-century America, intruders might not get a friendly reception.

They examined the bodies carefully but found nothing more worth mentioning. Qian Shuixie had originally hoped to find a salvageable captive to treat and turn into a brave collaborator—or at least learn more about the local natives. But the few who hadn't died instantly had severe wounds and died one after another before long.

Qian Shuixie noted the distance between the ambush site and their marching path on the riverbank—less than fifty meters on average. If the enemy had decent bows and arrows, they could have opened fire first. A rain of arrows—even soft bows and bamboo arrows—would have caused some injuries. Mixed with javelins, his side would definitely have suffered casualties.

It seemed the Dutch choice to campaign in winter made a lot of sense. At least in winter, there wouldn't be this man-high grass for enemies to hide in.

Another thing was the great utility of dogs—dogs detected the ambush earlier than the point man, and in this wilderness terrain, dogs' rapid pursuit ability was far more agile than slow-moving infantry. According to Dutch experience, the most useful things for punitive expeditions against local natives were horses and dogs—which was similar to the Spanish experience in the Americas.

If they had a military dog unit of dozens of dogs, whether as point or pursuit, they would be very lethal against natives lacking protection and weapons.

Qian Shuixie returned to the formation. Chandler reported: The *Haitian* was calling, asking about the gunfire just now.

He took the walkie-talkie handset: "We encountered an attack by local natives... No, no casualties, the enemy ran. Looks like they were watching us for a while."

After this attack, Qian Shuixie decided not to advance further inland—after taking such a big loss, the other side would either be scared witless or gather more able-bodied men to seek revenge. If several hundred men really came, in this complex terrain, his dozen-plus men would still be at a disadvantage.

Because of the attack, the survey team stopped risking deep inland penetration. Qian Shuixie led the team along the coastline instead, so they could receive support from the *Haitian* at any time.

They concentrated their efforts on surveying the terrain around Dagou Mountain and Dagou Harbor, measuring water depth, and mapping the planned roads into the Kaohsiung Plain.

During this time, local natives didn't conflict with the survey team again. Liu Zheng had hoped they might send someone to make contact—almost all colonists and pioneer teams venturing into savage lands encountered such a process: attacked - repelled - negotiation - exchange of gifts - finding collaborators. But they operated locally for four or five days, and no natives ever came to the temporary camp near the river mouth.

Liu Zheng had intended to establish preliminary cooperative relations through contact with the natives, thereby gaining freedom of movement in tribal territory—after all, he had studied historical materials left by the Dutch before setting out. There were conflicts between the major aboriginal tribes in the Tainan area; the Sinkan tribe and the local Takau tribe had land disputes and armed conflicts. The Sinkan people eventually acted as accomplices for the Dutch.

The Dutch used conflicts between native tribes in Taiwan, acting as arbitrators and allies, constantly "inciting the masses to fight the masses." He felt the Transmigration Group would inevitably have to use this trick to gain a firm foothold here initially. The easiest conflict to exploit was between the Takau and Sinkan. Striking at the Sinkan would indirectly strike at Dutch power, preventing them from expanding toward the Kaohsiung Plain. Tayouan was only two days' journey from here, less than 40 kilometers in a straight line—after the Christmas Campaign of 1635, the Dutch expanded their territory to the Kaohsiung Plain, settling Fujian immigrants in this area to reclaim land for farming.

However, all this depended on finding a suitable liaison. Liu Zheng himself didn't have the guts to go find local natives alone. Taiwan's natives all had the head-hunting habit; if he went to find them himself, his head might very well become a dried trophy on a wooden stake in a native village.
