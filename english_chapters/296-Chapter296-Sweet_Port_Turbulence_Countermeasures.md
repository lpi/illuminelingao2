# Chapter 296 Sweet Port Turbulence – Countermeasures

"Liao Dahua said he has already booked a courtyard in Xuwen County seat. If it really doesn't work out, we can flee into the county seat." Wen Tong brought up Liao Dahua's suggestion.

"That's just silly," Chen Tianxiong said. "No matter how important the South China Factory is, we don't necessarily have to martyr ourselves for the factory. I think Bei Wei and Liao Dahua should discuss together and prepare a plan for escaping in case of emergency. How to go, whom to take..."

There were several hundred people in the factory. Bei Wei only brought two or three team members, and the escort agency could at most send ten or so people over. It was obviously impossible to protect all workers to escape. Fortunately, the other side mostly only wanted their lives; they wouldn't exterminate ordinary employees.

"Send the Wen brothers and the women away. It's useless for women to stay here. I spent a lot of effort training the Wen brothers; it would be a pity if they were killed," Wen Tong said. The key was that these people lived with the transmigrators day and night and had developed some feelings. "Also the key personnel in the sugar factory and their families." He shook his head, "But public sentiment has just been gathered. If we do this, when South China is restored in the future, the people's hearts will be scattered."

This was self-evident. Once the trouble started, there would inevitably be casualties among the sugar factory employees, while their leaders and cronies hid safely in a secure place long ago—no one would like such a thing.

Thinking of this, everyone couldn't help but feel dispirited. Xiao Gui said: "I feel that doing this is a bit too selfish and somewhat despicable." He said that since they were thinking of asking the employees to exert effort to defend the sugar factory now, but would leave them behind to their fate when the time came, South China's reputation would stink to high heaven in the future.

"I think," Chen Tianxiong said, "The Wen brothers shouldn't be sent away either. They are an important channel for us to communicate with the locals. In addition, the women shouldn't be sent away either. To avoid affecting morale."

This implied sacrificing the pawns to save the general. Everyone knew in their hearts that keeping a few female slaves in the sugar factory was useless. But at least it was an attitude—everyone in the sugar factory knew that the few female slaves were the masters' concubines.

Xiao Gui originally admired Chen Tianxiong's calmness and organized way of doing things, but now he somewhat disagreed: "Even worse," Xiao Gui said. "What we should consider now is how to defend the South China Factory, not thinking about how to escape, let alone preparing rhetoric to deceive the employees after escaping!"

These words were spoken with righteousness, and everyone was speechless. Wen Tong's face turned green and then white: "Fine. I have a gun anyway. If I fight for my life then, at most I'll be the first to enter Cuigang."

Cuigang Cemetery; no transmigrators were buried there yet. Saying he would be the first to be buried there was obviously spoken out of spite.

Chen Tianxiong was still lukewarm: "The sugar factory must definitely be preserved as much as possible. But if the workers really fight their way to the door, even risking our lives might not necessarily save it."

Bei Wei asked: "What about the third point?"

"The third point is to inquire about news and get a clear picture of the overall situation. Although I don't approve of blowing Master Zhu's head off, preparations for this matter still need to be made in advance. If it really doesn't work, rather than letting him blow our heads off, we might as well blow his off first." At this point, everyone smiled a bit. "Besides Master Zhu, who else is key? What are their attitudes? We have to inquire about everything one by one, including getting to the bottom of their backgrounds. That way, when the time comes, whether to fight or pull strings, we can have a plan. Otherwise, even if we want to commit murder and arson, we won't know where to find the people!"

"This is reasonable." Bei Wei agreed. "Send all the people from Start Might out to check."

"Start Might's people are inquiring about news outside right now. Since there is a clear target, I will instruct Liao Dahua again!" Wen Tong said.

"With exact intelligence, things will be easier to handle. If it really doesn't work then, we'll trouble Old Bei to go out and settle it. This job is a bit 'dirty'..."

The so-called "dirty" meant that this was different from a war between countries, which had a legitimate cause. This was truly a struggle for benefits. Letting Bei Wei, who came from a proper military background, do underworld deeds, Chen Tianxiong was afraid he would feel uncomfortable in his heart.

"There is no need for such words," Bei Wei said. "Since we came to this timeline, we must consider the overall situation of the Transmigration Group."

"Good, it's enough to have these words." Chen Tianxiong said, "Actually, I have another idea, which is to pull the firewood from under the cauldron. But I'm not very confident."

The so-called pulling the firewood from under the cauldron was to lobby the sugar shed workers who were preparing to rise up. Whether letting them "understand the great righteousness" or buying them off with heavy gold, as long as they didn't rise up, the matter would be more than half successful. But the current situation was unclear, making Chen Tianxiong feel somewhat unable to start.

"Don't they have no work to do? At worst, we'll recruit them all." Mei Lin said. He got excited, seeming to have discovered a new continent, "If wages are paid, I don't believe they will still cause trouble."

"Originally it was possible, but we are too late." Wen Tong was a bit depressed, "Now the sugar factory doesn't lack people. What would we recruit them for? We can't support them for nothing."

"Even if they get paid for nothing, it's fine; at least it serves the function of 'stability maintenance'!" Mei Lin said, "Besides, two hundred or so workers, at twelve taels of silver per person per year, is just over two thousand taels."

This idea wasn't bad. Although it had the suspicion of spending money to buy peace, it was always a more feasible method.

Chen Tianxiong nodded: "Your saying this has given me an idea. Leave this matter to me. I will definitely appease all the workers."

Everyone was stunned, not knowing what clever plan he had, but seeing his mysterious appearance, he presumably had great confidence.

"However, this matter requires everyone's cooperation. Especially Wen Tong." Chen Tianxiong said, "But I have eighty or ninety percent confidence it will succeed—at least it can cause internal chaos among them and delay the disturbance for a few days."

With the plan decided, Wen Tong asked: "What about the sugar transport matter? Transporting sugar to Guangzhou is urgent, but how to solve the safety problem?"

"Yes, either ask the Executive Committee to help send ships for escort, or we have to equip all ships of the Highland Shipyard with weapons and soldiers, but that would be troublesome."

"It doesn't matter. I have an idea, but it needs the Executive Committee's help. It's like this—"

With the plan set, everyone went to do their own tasks. Chen Tianxiong discussed secretly with Wen Tong for a while, then immediately called Liao Daxing in and asked many questions. He also asked him to list those in the sugar factory who were originally sugar shed workers, and used a pen to note clearly one by one what they did originally: sugar boiling, fire burning, or general odd jobs. He also asked Wen Xiu to bring all the "confessions" written by the workers during the "Anti-Corruption" movement, comparing them one by one, busy for a long time.

Wen Tong found it strange and asked: "What does this mean?"

Chen Tianxiong said: "To put it plainly, it's not rare. It's just the trick of inciting the masses to struggle against the masses."

The method Mei Lin mentioned of hiring all unemployed workers would indeed have been a good strategy of "pulling firewood from under the cauldron" if used a month earlier. But now it was a bit late. The unemployed workers were obviously organized and had leaders. This leader was most likely controlled by Haiyi Hall. Proposing to give jobs now might not gain the trust of the unemployed workers. Even if the other side was willing to talk, the asking price would probably be ridiculously high.

"Think about it: the unemployed workers are already like an arrow on the bowstring. If we say now that we are willing to give them jobs, if you were an unemployed worker, what would you think?"

"Of course, I would think the other side is afraid."

"Exactly right," Chen Tianxiong nodded, "This will make them realize their own power—right now these people haven't thought that much."

"This will instead promote their unity."

"Hehe, exactly." Chen Tianxiong said with a smile, "So the first thing is to divide them. Sugar shed workers, although spoken of as one body, are actually divided into several types."

Wen Tong knew this. The sugar boiling masters had the highest technical requirements, so every sugar shed was headed by him. Next were the fire burners, who controlled the intensity of the fire at any time according to the boiling master's instructions. Both of these types of people had technical expertise, and their income was also the highest. Especially during the crushing season, the income of good masters was quite substantial. The others were just unskilled laborers selling their strength.

"Pull who and hit who?" Wen Tong asked.

"According to you?" Chen Tianxiong suddenly kept him in suspense.

Wen Tong said: "Generally speaking, it's always better to pull people with skills. Firstly, skilled people are useful to pull in, and secondly, they have a greater voice in the group. But we don't need their skills—"

Chen Tianxiong nodded repeatedly: "Correct, Old Wen, your brain turns faster than mine. At first, I also wanted to start with the sugar boiling masters, but later I realized it wasn't appropriate—" He first flattered Wen Tong, "...The price to buy them is much higher than buying ordinary workers."

These people were "having seen the ocean, it's hard to settle for water" in terms of income; South China couldn't buy them without spending a big price. If the price spent was high, it would not only cost money but also cause dissatisfaction among the people in the sugar factory. Comparing both sides, the loss outweighed the gain.

In contrast, general workers only wanted rice to eat, clothes to wear, and their families not to starve to death. Although they were numerous, the cost was actually not large, and their psychological expectations were small. Proper placement could satisfy them, and they might even be grateful.

As long as there was stable rice to eat, even if there were many complaints, no one would easily be willing to be a mobster. Both Chen Tianxiong and Wen Tong understood this principle clearly.

Some wanted to be mobsters, some didn't want to. This temporarily organized worker group would inevitably have internal strife. Supplemented by other means, disintegrating it would be easy. Although Master Zhu was the black hand behind the scenes, he wasn't a Communist after all; engaging in labor movements wasn't his specialty.

As for Chen Tianxiong looking for the list of sugar factory workers, Wen Tong understood. They had no connections among the sugar shed workers, so they could only use the people already in the factory to act as go-betweens. After all, they used to eat from the same pot.

"You found the confessions; presumably, you want those whose 'sore spots' we have grasped to go, right? Not afraid of them turning traitor, nor afraid of them not doing their best."

"Correct," Chen Tianxiong said. "However, those who wrote confessions are basically sugar boilers and fire burners. There are very few general coolies. They have no skills, and dividing the loot wouldn't reach their turn."

"It's good that there aren't any! At least their character is still okay."

"True. I selected a few. I'll meet them in a while to see how their adaptability is. I'll let them go out to carry out activities tomorrow morning!"

Chen Tianxiong also planned to go out for activities himself, but he didn't say this first. Firstly, he didn't want everyone to worry, and secondly, he wanted to show off his skills in front of everyone. Not to mention others, although Bei Wei was just a captain of the special reconnaissance team, he was a core member under the Executive Committee. Leaving a deep impression on him would be of great benefit to future development.

Early the next day, Chen Tianxiong set off with Zhou Shizhai. He had already learned a mouthful of Leizhou dialect in Lingao. Although not very standard, communicating with locals was no longer a problem. Plus, his skin was relatively dark, so after changing into local clothes, he looked very "Ming Dynasty."

Originally, Liao Dahua wanted to send the one with the best martial arts in the Start Might Leizhou Branch to follow, but Chen Tianxiong still chose Zhou Shizhai. Compared to others, he was obviously more reliable, and having been in Lingao for a long time, he also understood the transmigrators' style of doing things, requiring no extra explanation.

The purpose of this trip was to visit Lin Zhuang. Start Might's people easily found out that he was the leader of the unemployed sugar shed workers. They also knew he had been to Haiyi Hall several times.

"Lin Zhuang's skills are average," Zhou Shizhai said. "Mainly, he is more 'outgoing,' speaks well, and has some small connections with all walks of life in Xuwen. So among the sugar shed workers, he counts as a head. He was the one publicly recommended to come forward for the lawsuit last time."

"How is his character?" Chen Tianxiong asked.

"A decent person." The escort said. Of course, this person wasn't a bad guy, but because he liked socializing, he inevitably contracted some bad habits. Eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, he had a share in all, so he couldn't save much money. So at over thirty, he still had no wife and was a bachelor.

Lin Zhuang was a bachelor, so naturally he wouldn't have much of a home. Right now, he was living in the Zou Monk Temple. The surroundings there were now full of unemployed sugar shed workers dragging their families along, preparing to go to South China to demand an explanation. Going to find him there was a bit risky.

"It doesn't matter. If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you get the tiger's cub?" Chen Tianxiong was extremely confident. Since Lin Zhuang had vices, he wouldn't be a person with a firm stand. Buying him off was extremely likely to succeed. Even if it didn't succeed, just spreading word of today's matter with vivid details would be enough to destroy the little prestige he originally had.

A snake cannot move without a head. Removing this backbone, combined with the strategic action of "masses fighting masses," this group of temporarily gathered rabble would disband immediately. It would be much easier to clean up the mess then.

The two came to the front of the Zou Monk Temple and saw that this temple was quite large-scale—because Monk Zou was the patriarch of the sugar industry, and Leizhou's sugar industry was developed, the Zou Monk Temple was built particularly well. Originally, this was also the place where Haiyi Hall performed operas to thank the gods once a year.

But at this moment, inside and outside the temple, there were crowds of people dragging their families everywhere. The corridors were full of people living there. Adults shouting and children crying; it was as lively as a market. Some were dressed reasonably completely, while others were simply in rags, close to refugees.
