# Chapter 123 - Women's Cooperative

The news of the transmigrators breaking Gou Family Stockade spread throughout the county within three days. The reactions of all kinds of people from top to bottom to this news were extremely complex. The gentry and big households were happy that Gou Xunyi, this guy hated by everyone and dogs, who ran rampant and tyrannized, was completely finished, but they were also worried about the short-hairs' growing power. However, the poor people within a radius of dozens of li all received relief, and everyone was happy and grateful. People from far away admired it upon hearing the news and spread it everywhere. As the common people benefited, people constantly came to secretly tell the transmigrators the details of many big households' stockades. Some were willing to be insiders, inviting them to go and break the stockades. Even small groups of bandits came to contact and discuss "sharing wealth." The transmigrators received them warmly and noted down the situation. As for breaking stockades, they expressed that they needed rest and reorganization and would not conduct this business for the time being.

Within a hundred li, no big household failed to send congratulatory gifts to the short-hairs. Even Huang Family Stockade sent people to bring pigs, sheep, and cloth. The transmigrators let bygones be bygones, not only accepting everything but also heavily rewarding the coming and going envoys, and asking them to take back a message: Bairen City has opened a new market. Everyone is welcome to do business, safety guaranteed, no fees charged. Dongmen Chuiyu tirelessly took groups of envoys to visit East Gate Market, showing them the brick and stone road being paved and the red brick houses being built along the street...

Pirates opening a market to do business, this was really a fresh thing! There were not many markets in Lingao. The whole county had only fourteen markets in total, and even the dignified county town only had a simple county gate market. Now Bairen Beach actually came up with an East Gate Market! The big households heard from their returning family members that the market there was no worse than other places. Just the short-hairs themselves purchased many things every day, and recently they were open to acquiring grain at a very high price! Many big households with large grain reserves were moved and joined the team selling grain to the transmigrators. The daily arrival of grain made Cheng Dong stomp his feet in heartache—silver was flowing out like water!

After intense preparations, the transmigrators' first business—the salt shop—opened amidst the crackling of firecrackers. Because the factory (trading station) was not yet built, this salt shop was just a simple bamboo shed. Behind the counter were piled bags of sea salt transported from Maniao Salt Field, sold in units of 50 grams, both wholesale and retail, with the price one-third lower than the market price.

Although the sales volume was negligible at first, as people doing business here spread the news that East Gate Market had cheap salt for sale, people from all directions rushed to buy salt, and sales surged immediately. Especially some small salt peddlers flocked to it like ducks, buying in baskets. In the past, the salt field was occupied by Great Household Gou, and salt was hard to get, let alone the official salt in the county town—snow-white salt turned black and yellow like mud and sand after passing through official hands, and the price was outrageous. Finally, even the cook of the county office came to buy salt. He didn't ask for an invoice, but the reimbursement was undoubtedly based on the official salt price.

Encouraged by the success of the salt shop, the second shop of the transmigrators also opened. This shop was somewhat special. The reason it was special was that it was not a "state-owned shop," meaning the ownership was not by all transmigrators but a joint-stock enterprise.

This joint-stock enterprise was drummed up by Li Mei of the Ming family of four. Not long after moving to Bairen City and settling down, Old Lady Li, accustomed to fighting in the business world, began to sit still no longer. Currently, her daughter-in-law became a police officer, her old companion put on his Type 87 navy uniform without collar badges and hat emblem every day to serve as some naval advisor in the military group, and although her son was useless and didn't get a public office for a while, he worked outside every day. She, however, spent all day helping in the cafeteria with a housewife, Cao Shunhua. How could this do! She was, after all, a veteran of the business world, always calculating to start a company or something, at least open a shop.

Opening a shop was a piece of cake for Li Mei in the original time and space. She had capital and channels. But here, the whole family had nothing but a pile of luggage. The transmigrators themselves had no goods to sell either. Even a clever housewife cannot cook a meal without rice. So she had to wait for an opportunity. Old Lady Li firmly believed one thing: opportunities to get rich exist in any time and space, as long as you can grasp them.

When the transmigrators opened up trade relations with Li Dong and made a fortune in Gou Family Stockade, East Gate Market also began to take shape. Li Mei knew the opportunity had come.

The Planning Committee transported countless spoils from Gou Family Stockade, having everything from porcelain and furniture to clothes. These items needed to be digested and turned into usable cash and grain. This was her source of goods.

The next question was, how to turn the source of goods into merchandise in the shop? She had no money, but this was not difficult for her at all. After some whispering and networking with the women she met in the cafeteria, Li Mei returned to her simple room, put on a suit she used to wear when going out to discuss business from her trunk, and put on a pair of medium-heeled leather shoes. Washed her face and combed her hair carefully, immediately transforming from a cafeteria auntie to a strong business woman.

She went out straight to the Executive Committee compound, found an opportunity to catch Wen Desi, and told him her idea of opening a shop.

"Open a shop?" Wen Desi was a bit confused, "We don't produce industrial products in large quantities yet; there's nothing to sell."

"There are things, just those things transported back from Gou Family Stockade, those clothes, daily necessities, miscellaneous wood furniture and so on. These things are basically old. They can't be sold to others in bulk. I want to acquire them on behalf of the company and then sell them."

Wen Desi suddenly felt this woman was a bit whimsical. Isn't this just selling second-hand goods? Her company acquires, with what money? He knew Old Master Ming's wife used to be a manager of a trading company, probably very wealthy, but RMB assets—not to mention whether she brought them, even if she did, they were worthless.

"What do you use to acquire? And company? I don't remember establishing a company."

"The company is here," Li Mei took out a piece of paper densely covered with words, "This is the agreement for the establishment of the company. Logically, it should be registered with the Industrial and Commercial Administration first, but Dongmen Chuiyu said he didn't know if he had the power to manage this. So I brought it to show you."

Wen Desi took it and looked. It roughly wrote that these people voluntarily invested to establish a "Hainan Women's Cooperative Co., Ltd.", with a business scope of: daily necessities, general merchandise, catering, hardware, etc. Below were the share distribution ratios and signatures of more than a dozen women—at a rough glance, almost all female transmigrators, even Aunt Cao, known for her simplicity, had shares.

"But what is your capital injection? Where does everyone have money now? Isn't it all supply system?"

"President Wen, I remember all officially registered transmigrators receive wages—"

Wen Desi didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He had forgotten this matter. Because there was absolutely nowhere to spend wages, few people remembered they had this income. But this accidental involvee remembered clearly.

"These shareholders all invested with the coupon income under their names. I think the Executive Committee definitely won't deny that these coupons equivalent to RMB have purchasing power—"

"This—" Wen Desi certainly couldn't deny it; otherwise, everyone would raise hell immediately. He struggled a bit, "But only three months' wages have been issued so far. This little money, even as capital, can't acquire so many things."

"We will acquire a part first temporarily, and then use the sales proceeds for turnover." Li Mei saw President Wen's face was very wrong and immediately stated the follow-up, "The first batch is acquired with coupons. Later purchases from the Executive Committee will be settled with coupons, work point coupons, gold, silver, and copper coins together."

"Good, this is good." Wen Desi finally breathed a sigh of relief, "But since you are selling to natives, there won't be new coupon income."

"Oh, actually many things can also be sold to comrades. I know, I know," she stopped Wen Desi who was about to speak, "Our group is currently under the supply system, but non-essential goods can totally be bought by everyone with coupons—otherwise what's the meaning of having coupons? I heard a few days ago someone wanted to buy a long table for his room. The Executive Committee wouldn't issue this too, right? Also, if more working capital is needed, I also plan to issue corporate bonds—of course, with the Executive Committee's consent."

"We'll talk about the bond issue later." Wen Desi thought you really prepared for a Great Leap Forward in commerce, "Running a joint-stock company is a good idea. I personally agree. But the Executive Committee has to discuss it before giving you a formal reply."

"I have an idea," Li Mei continued to add to her bargaining chips, "This company can be made into a public-private joint venture commercial stock enterprise. The Executive Committee can invest on behalf of all transmigrators and occupy a part of the shares—for example, 20%."

"Hmm, this is not bad." Wen Desi began to listen to her ideas seriously.

"The income from this part can be used to pay dividends to everyone, for welfare expenses, or for future administrative expenses of the Executive Committee—" She said slowly while watching the changes in President Wen's face, "Think about it, the supply system is abnormal. Once we stand firm, a salary system will always be implemented. At that time, everyone will care about income. Everyone would like to have some extra cash distributed."

"But the Executive Committee cannot issue more coupons," Wen Desi frowned, "Coupons are just a virtual currency, automatically adding a number to everyone's salary and bonus account every month. The value is hard to estimate. This is one aspect. Another problem is that the Executive Committee has no coupons to use at all."

"The value issue, we can calculate again. There are people who studied economics in the group; they should be able to come up with a method. As for the Executive Committee having no coupons, this is not a problem at all," Li Mei smiled slyly, revealing her true purpose, "Can use goods to invest shares."

Wen Desi was startled: You are getting something for nothing (white wolf with empty hands)! After all this, Li Mei didn't have a single penny, all empty talk. But he couldn't come up with any reason to object because she grasped the deadly point that the Executive Committee dared not deny the value of coupons.

The proposal to start a company was quickly approved at the meeting. Besides the concept of public-private joint venture, the financial and commercial departments also supported this proposal. Cheng Dong believed this could withdraw some coupons from circulation. Once the huge amount of coupons accumulated by so many people over a long time suddenly joined market circulation, it would cause severe inflation.

Du Wen was particularly active in supporting it at the meeting—it turned out that besides all transmigrators owning 20% of the shares of this public-private joint venture stock company, the "Women's Federation" Du Wen had been advocating to establish occupied 5% of the shares before it was even established. The biggest beneficiary was of course Li Mei herself. Although she didn't have a single yuan of coupon, she still got 12% of the shares as a manager—this was decided by vote at the general meeting of shareholders.
