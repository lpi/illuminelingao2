# Chapter 57 - Camp

Chapter 57 Camp

The lively celebration passed, and life returned to peace.

The Transmigrators began to adapt to the life in the camp.

Every morning, the wake-up bugle sounded on time. Everyone got up, washed, did morning exercises, and ate breakfast.

Then, they went to their respective posts to start a day's work.

Workers went to factories, farmers went to fields, soldiers went to drill grounds, teachers went to schools...

Life was regular and busy.

In the evening, after work, everyone would gather in the canteen or club to chat, play cards, and watch movies (using projectors).

Although there was no Internet or mobile phone, the relationship between people became closer.

They helped each other and cared for each other, forming a big warm family.

Of course, there were also conflicts and frictions.

For example, disputes caused by uneven distribution of materials; quarrels caused by different working concepts; and emotional entanglements between men and women...

However, under the mediation of the Executive Committee, these problems were resolved one by one.

"We are a community of destiny." Wen Desi often said, "Unity is strength."

In addition to internal construction, they also began to explore the surrounding environment.

Scouts went deep into the interior of Lingao and drew detailed maps.
Botanists collected various plant specimens and looked for useful resources.
Geologists prospected for minerals and looked for coal and iron ore.

They found that Lingao was indeed a treasure land. There were fertile land, abundant water sources, and rich mineral resources here.

"As long as we develop it well, this place will become a paradise on earth!" Wu Nanhai said excitedly holding a handful of black soil.

However, they also found some hidden dangers.

Bandits were rampant in the mountains and forests nearby.
Pirates often appeared on the sea surface.
The local government was corrupt and incompetent, exploiting the people.

"These are stumbling blocks on our way forward." Xi Yazhou said, "We must remove them!"

"Don't worry." Wen Desi said calmly, "Take your time. We have time and strength."

Night fell again. The lights of the camp lit up, shining like stars in the dark wilderness.

This was the light of civilization, illuminating the direction of the future.
