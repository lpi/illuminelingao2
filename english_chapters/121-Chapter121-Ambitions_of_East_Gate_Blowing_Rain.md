# Chapter 121: Ambitions of East Gate Blowing Rain and Solitary Seeking Marriage

In the second-floor meeting room—featuring public standard-measures in the hall below—the East Gate Market Administration Office held its first meeting. Conditions were crude: walls only whitewashed with limestone, not yet fully dry from rushed construction. Floorboards were raw wood—Industrial Department hadn't found lacquer trees yet; modern paint was the far-distant future. No ceiling or paneling whatsoever. The only modern equipment: a single lightbulb hanging high from the roof. Yet the furniture was luxurious—in the 21st century, worth several million at least. Rosewood painting-tables, red-sandalwood official-hat chairs, huanghuali round stools—arranged haphazardly into a conference setup. All spoils from Gou Manor.

Seven or eight attendees—all interested in commercial work. Some had experience; others, pure hobbyists. The leader, a young man who claimed to have worked as an urban-management auxiliary officer, had adopted a completely new name upon learning he'd head East Gate Market: "Dongmen Chuiyu" *(East Gate Blowing Rain)*.

Beside him sat his deputy: iron-gray uniform-style shirt, black trousers, black cap—armband reading "Administrative Law Enforcement Auxiliary." Face murderous—the look of a street-vendor terminator. Like Dongmen Chuiyu, his original name was unknown. In future Republic historical records, he appeared under the bizarre name "Dugu Qiuhun" *(Solitary Seeking Marriage)*. These two would create an entirely new commercial model in Ming-dynasty Lingao County.

In the not-too-distant future, transmigrators' commerce would span all seas—their overseas trading network covering Europe, Asia, and Africa. But at this moment, their entire commercial operation occupied the unpaved dirt lot below their building. Fortunately, Wen Desi had declared: commerce was a Committee priority—whatever money or materials needed.

Where the flag points, trade opens the path. Historical colonial expansion invariably used commercial trade as breakthrough. Trade brought not just profits but became crucial means for colonizers to establish footholds. For transmigrators—having already seized territory by force—the next step was increasing local contacts, transforming from fierce, murderous pirates into merchants with abundant novel goods. Wealth's attraction would draw ever more wary locals to their side, ultimately linking their interests together.

Travelers themselves also needed trade support—especially basic necessities like grain and supplementary foods, which had to come from local farmers. Relying on imports carried major uncertainties. Ancient Romans often experienced political upheaval when Egyptian grain-ships were delayed—absolutely to be avoided.

The meeting first reviewed yesterday's grain procurement. When scouts reported farmers beginning to deliver grain to landlords, transmigrators immediately set up grain-purchasing stations at East Gate Market. Local rice price: 1.3 *liang* silver per *shi* *(94.4 kg)*. Calculating typical 70% milling rate, unhusked-grain purchase price was set at 0.8 *liang* per *shi*. This price didn't account for rice-price transportation and profit margins—Commercial Department estimated local unhusked-grain prices at under 0.5 *liang* per *shi*. Offering 0.8 *liang* was already remarkably high.

Procurement went smoothly. Nearby commoners—from small farmers to major grain-holders—seeing their eagerness to pay silver for grain, were all tempted. Initially just scattered individuals; recently, over 100–200 people daily, shoulder-carrying or cart-pushing sacks and baskets of grain. Commercial Department's seven or eight people couldn't cope—Agricultural Department staff were called to help.

Initial confusion occurred because locals habitually used *dou* *(peck)* as the grain-measurement unit—ten *dou* to one *shi*. *Dou* came in official and private versions of varying sizes. *Dou* tops were open—should the surface be level or heaped? How high a heap? Everyone was stumped. After confusion, they decided: immediately implement new weights and measures—purchase by weight. Price: 0.8 *liang* per 100 kg, termed "metric *shi*." A floor-scale salvaged from the ship was used. Surprisingly, this measurement change provoked no seller objections or protests. From their perspective, if buyers wanted to purchase grain, what units they used was their business. This amazed Dongmen Chuiyu—no wonder landlords used "small out, large in"—commoners had no awareness of measurement-standards' importance.

Comparatively, commoners showed keen interest in preventing grain-weight fraud. Initially, inexperience and chaos meant purchased grain contained mixed chaff, even husks and sand—taking losses. Someone suggested making grain-probes for sampling. Wu Nanhai urgently trained them on grain quality, moisture content—reducing quality-fraud.

"...As of today, we've purchased 90 tons of unhusked grain. 2,100 kg of peanuts." Dongmen Chuiyu reported procurement status to attending Committee members.

"How much more can you purchase?" Wen Desi asked. 90 tons unhusked grain—milled to brown rice: barely 70 tons. Looked like a lot, but more and more mouths to feed, plus commoner relief—somewhat tight.

Yu Eshui opened his notebook: "Purchasing capacity remains. Per county-gazetteer records: during the Wanli era, Lingao's autumn grain-tax principal was 7,646.927 *shi*; newly-reclaimed land: 6.079 *shi*; total 7,686.079 *shi*. That's just principal. Adding miscellaneous surtaxes, meltage fees, and official-layer skimmings, actual delivered grain was surely over 10,000 *shi*. Now—late Ming—when wealthy households' land-and-population concealment was most severe—substantial acreage likely wasn't grain-taxed. So I estimate Lingao's total autumn-grain output: 50,000–70,000 *shi*. Purchasing 3,000–5,000 *shi* is no problem."

Someone questioned: "Is stockpiling this much grain necessary? Gou Manor yielded over 1,000 *shi*. Plus—salt village is already selling salt to the mainland—trading salt for Guangdong grain. We could also buy grain from Vietnam."

Wu Nanhai took food issues very seriously—immediately rebutted: "More grain, the better. Grain in hand, peace of mind. Guangdong, Vietnam—those are distant waters. If supply gets cut, it'll destabilize morale."

Wen Desi added: "At this stage, grain is harder currency than silver. Any famine—grain prices skyrocket, silver devalues. Don't forget—this is the Little Ice Age. Natural disasters are frequent. We're not just a few ships and a few hundred people anymore. Think county-scale. Prepare for every contingency."

"I also flag trade balance and silver reserves for Committee attention." Cheng Dong spoke for Finance. "Currently, our trade shows severe deficit—silver flowing out rapidly. After Gou Manor, our silver reserves rose to 15,000 *liang* (old system). These few days, nearly 1,000 *liang* flowed out. This can't continue—circulating currency also has demands."

"Xiao Zishan went to Guangzhou. Have him withdraw a few tens of thousands from Gao's?"

"No need." Wen Desi said. "Lingao is small—too much silver influx isn't good. We have another substitute—salt." Salt had historically served as currency. He planned to use it for partial grain and labor payments.

But some opposed: to commoners, silver was clearly more attractive than salt—easier to carry and use. Commoners had tasted cash-purchasing benefits—they wouldn't like sudden forced barter.

"Open a salt shop." Dongmen Chuiyu had a sudden inspiration. "Specialized salt sales. They sell grain with their left hand, get silver—spend it back to us with their right. Haha, I'm such a crafty merchant—"

"Good idea. Using grain and salt as equivalents isn't sustainable long-term. We control county salt production now—perfect for currency recovery." Cheng Dong nodded approval.

Dongmen Chuiyu struck while hot—quickly handed over a document: "This is our Commercial Group's East Gate Market development plan. Please approve promptly!"

"Development plan?" Committee members were startled. Their free market outside Bairren Fortress was meant only for promoting trade and local relations. How to manage it—few had seriously considered. They'd imagined it like domestic free-markets: farmers and vendors coming to sell goods—at most, maybe exempting stall-fees.

"Indeed, a development plan." Dongmen seized the moment, standing. "Committee members, allow me to present this comprehensive plan. I believe: with this plan, under Committee's correct leadership, guided by Director Wen, strongly supported by Commissioner Cheng—"

"Cut the crap! We're in Ming Dynasty—still doing this routine?!" Dugu Qiuhun was impatient.

"—our East Gate Market will become all-Lingao's, no—all-Hainan's most prosperous commercial market!"

Dongmen Chuiyu had unofficial civil-service experience—couldn't be bothered by Qiuhun's grumbles. After his preamble, he quickly hung a newly-drawn plan on the blackboard behind him. He'd visited Construction Engineering Group—sweet-talking endlessly, offering several cigarette-packs—to get this.
