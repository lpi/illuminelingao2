# Chapter 826: Ally

The envoy was a middle-aged man. Although he wore decent traditional Chinese clothes, had his hair neatly coiled in the unique bun of a Chinese man, and wore a graceful gauze cap—decorations only wealthy Chinese adopted—the Governor still felt he could smell the stench of seawater and rotting fish and shrimp on him.

Obviously, the envoy felt quite uncomfortable in these decent Chinese clothes; De Carpentier noticed him tugging at his clothes from time to time, seeming ill at ease.

Liu Xiang's envoy bowed deeply before him. De Carpentier only nodded slightly; as the Governor-General of the East India Company, he considered himself the representative of the authority of the seventeen directors of the United Provinces, with no need to treat pirates of the South China Sea with courtesy.

"Well, what new proposal have you brought?" the Governor asked.

What the envoy brought was Liu Xiang's proposal requesting support from the Dutch. Specifically, Liu Xiang hoped that the Dutch could dispatch warships from Tayouan to support him in the battle against Zheng Zhilong—he was preparing to launch a maritime campaign against Zheng Zhilong recently, and if possible, completely destroy Zhongzuo.

Besides hoping for direct Dutch participation in the battle, the accompanying requests included asking the Dutch to provide cannons, matchlocks, gunpowder, and craftsmen and soldiers capable of using and repairing European guns. He could pay for all of these. If the Dutch were willing, he would buy or rent a few European-style "clamp-board great ships," naturally with the sailors to operate them.

"This is a big request," the Governor thought. Tayouan only had two permanently stationed ships, one of which was a yacht. But he had always been cautious about directly intervening in the conflict between Liu Xiang and Zheng Zhilong—after all, most merchants going to Tayouan Port now came from Fujian. If Zheng Zhilong was angered, he might very well blockade this trade route. That would inevitably be a loss outweighing the gain.

The relationship between the Dutch and Zheng Zhilong was subtle. First, Zheng Zhilong defeated the Dutch attempt to meddle in the trade of the Fujian seas in 1627, forcing Nuyts, stationed at Tayouan Port, to sign the three-year trade agreement with Zheng Zhilong the following year. Although this trade agreement was not implemented later, the Dutch remained wary of Zheng Zhilong's power. In 1630, Putnam, the representative of the East India Company, went to the mainland to conduct special trade negotiations with Zheng Zhilong and reached a trade agreement. Since then, there had been a period of "friendly relations" between the two sides. The Dutch provided some help for Zheng Zhilong to sweep away the warlords on the sea, including allowing his ships to enter Tayouan Port at will.

However, the expansion of Zheng Zhilong's power eventually made him the middleman for Dutch trade in the Zhangzhou Bay: goods shipped by the Dutch to the Fujian seas could only be sold to the Zheng Zhilong Group, and likewise, Chinese goods could only be purchased from the Zheng Zhilong Group.

The East India Company was very dissatisfied with this trade monopoly status. At the same time, there was friction between the two sides on the trade route to Japan. The Dutch hoped to monopolize trade with Japan, while the Zheng Zhilong Group also regarded trade with Japan as their exclusive domain.

Under various factors, the Dutch had always hoped to support another force to strike and weaken Zheng Zhilong, so that the Chinese maritime merchant groups on the Fujian and Guangdong seas could not monopolize coastal trade, opening the door of free trade for the Dutch.

Supporting the Liu Xiang Group was a reasonable choice for the East India Company. Of course, considering the fragile status of the Tayouan trade, Dutch support for Old Liu Xiang had always been rather implicit. Secretly providing aid such as cannons and ammunition had been ongoing, but providing ships was too big a matter—besides, the Dutch did not have many ships in the East Indies either.

Overall, the East India Company did not wish to see a decisive battle between Old Liu Xiang and Zheng Iquan. The final result of a decisive battle would inevitably be the winner taking all. At that time, a group sitting on the monopoly of coastal trade in both Guangdong and Fujian provinces would be a nightmare for the East India Company.

The message brought by the envoy complained that the pressure from Zheng Zhilong was increasing—after Zheng Zhilong defected to the Imperial Court, having an official status gave him full convenience for activities along the Fujian and Guangdong coasts. He could easily obtain supplies from the shore and even receive intelligence and weapons support from government troops. Even in competition on land, Zheng Zhilong had gained the upper hand: whether it was Zheng Zhilong or Liu Xiang, they both had allies known as "Mountain Masters" on shore acting as nests. "Mountain Masters" were half-farmers, half-bandits; they were not simple bandits but communities formed by displaced peasants who gathered in the mountains to log, burn charcoal, and reclaim land to plant cash crops. The Mountain Masters not only provided material replenishment and safe nests after landing for pirate-merchants but were also the main source of cash crops exported by the sea merchants, the largest commodity being indigo. Indigo was another cash crop exported in large quantities from China at that time and was a major source of profit for sea merchants. After Zheng Zhilong obtained official status, the Fujian authorities made it clear they supported Zheng Zhilong's activities. Under such dual pressure, the attitude of the Mountain Masters shifted significantly—Liu Xiang had fewer and fewer "friends" on shore, which threatened his business and even his survival.

These problems converged, finally forcing the Liu Xiang Gang to make the decision to have a showdown with Zheng Zhilong—comparatively speaking, Zheng Zhilong's strength was not yet too great. Launching a decisive battle at this time offered at least a fifty percent chance of success.

A fifty percent chance was really not a good opportunity to launch a decisive battle, but as time passed, Zheng Zhilong was constantly becoming stronger. In the past, he was just a force on the Fujian and Guangdong seas; now, with the support of Xiong Wencan, he had seemingly become the strongest power on the seas. And this strongest power showed no intention of "sharing wealth and honor," clearly wanting to swallow everything alone.

"Does Old Xiang really want to fight to the death with Iquan?" The Governor raised his eyelids, looking at the envoy standing before him.

"Your Honor, you see clearly! Iquan is becoming more and more terrible now! That old ghost Xiong Wencan gave him many large ships and many Red Barbarian Cannons. He can recruit as many people as he wants in Fujian. He fights without fear of losing people or destroying ships. If this goes on, our Gang will be dragged to death sooner or later."

The envoy said that recently Zheng Zhilong's fleet had approached the core area of Old Liu Xiang in the Chaoshan area many times. In order to defend his core territory, the Liu Xiang Gang had to urgently withdraw from the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary and return continuously to defend the Chaoshan area, preparing to meet Zheng Zhilong's challenge.

Losing the territory near the Pearl River Estuary was a very serious problem for Liu Xiang—this was his main source of income. Although he could not monopolize the route for foreign goods trade due to Portuguese naval patrols, the "passage fees" collected from various other coastal trading ships entering and leaving Guangzhou were equally lucrative. Although Zheng Zhilong's actions did not provoke direct naval combat between the two sides, they made Liu Xiang very passive. He could not risk losing the basic territory near Chaoshan and having his nest raided by Zheng Zhilong to continue staying at the Pearl River Estuary to generate income and do business; but now, forced to return entirely to the Chaoshan area, the Pearl River Estuary territory he had gradually conquered since the end of the Tianqi era would slowly be seized by others exploiting the void. Without territory, there was no money; without money, there was nothing.

For the Liu Xiang Gang, fighting might not ensure survival, but not fighting meant certain death. Relying solely on the resources of Chaoshan could not sustain the Gang's survival.

De Carpentier naturally understood Liu Xiang's current predicament. But he had absolutely no intention of sending any ships to support Liu Xiang—since Liu Xiang did not have the assurance of inevitable victory, it was an unwise choice to bet everything now. Even if Liu Xiang luckily defeated his opponent, given Zheng Zhilong's current strength, he might not necessarily decline. He would inevitably use a blockade of the Tayouan route as retaliation. Giving support in terms of weapons and personnel could be considered. The Company had two sailing ships in very poor condition in Batavia harbor: the *Alert* and the *Ardent*. These two 300-ton brigs leaked so severely that they had to be pumped throughout the voyage. Without a surplus of sailors, they could not sail far. But their rigging and armaments were complete; one had 12 cannons, the other 18. Selling them together to Liu Xiang would be a good choice. The Chinese would repair them; they had enough shipwrights and ship timber.

but this was not the main issue. The Governor had to consider another possibility after the Liu-Zheng war began: What if Liu Xiang failed in the decisive battle? Zheng Zhilong would undoubtedly sweep down to the Guangdong seas. At that time, the Company's bargaining power with him would be even smaller. Eventually, it would definitely degenerate to the state of trade dealings with Xu Xinsu at Tayouan Port back then—at that time, the Company's merchant stationed at Tayouan had to purchase goods brought by Xu Xinsu at 50% above the market price.

The Governor suddenly thought of the Australians in Lingao. He asked, "What kind of people are the Australians in Lingao?"

The envoy was stunned, probably not expecting the Governor to suddenly ask about the Australians.

"Oh?" The Governor suddenly became interested.

"The Imperial Court has already dispatched a great army to exterminate the Australians in Lingao. They only have a few thousand people in total and not many ships; how could they be a match for the Court?" The envoy did not hide anything and narrated the whole story of Liu Xiang ordering his subordinates to attack Lingao and suffering failure. He also talked about the recent gathering of Ming troops near Guangzhou, preparing to cross the sea for a massive attack—Liu Xiang's withdrawal from the Pearl River Estuary was also to avoid direct conflict with government troops. And another important factor for why he thought of a decisive battle with Zheng Zhilong was that the government troops were about to suppress Lingao, so the Australians would definitely not have hands free to deal with him. This removed a worry from the rear.

"...At that time, the Great Shopkeeper didn't know their firearms were powerful and miscalculated a move," the envoy said nonchalantly. "In the end, we lost about a thousand men."
