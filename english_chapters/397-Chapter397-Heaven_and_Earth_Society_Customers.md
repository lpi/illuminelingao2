# Chapter 397 - Heaven and Earth Society Customers

Funding shortages constantly plagued the county academy. Regarding educational investment, Lingao County's academy fields totaled four or five hundred *mu*—quite substantial. Academy fields were a type of official land, traditionally farmed by official tenants—Wu Nanhai's disciple Lu Jia's family was one. This system worked well in early years, but over time problems accumulated. Official tenants' burdens grew excessive; gradually tenants began fleeing. Now barely one in ten remained. Recruiting replacements failed. Wang Ci was a scholar—what did he know about economics? Besides seeking help everywhere, he was helpless. Several hundred *mu* of prime riverside paddy fields outside the county gate lay fallow while the academy was penniless, unable to afford pigs for the several annual Confucius sacrifices. Academy *xiucai* hadn't received their lamp-oil stipends for years and rarely visited. The academy was desolate—couldn't even afford to repair the Confucian Temple. The famous Moli Pavilion study hall had become a dangerous structure.

As they say, desperate times call for desperate measures. Seeing the academy deteriorating daily, Wang Ci knew getting county funds was impossible. Soliciting gentry donations wasn't sustainable. He had to start with academy fields. But scholars disdained farming, and no one wanted to tenant. Hearing that Australians were willing to help with farming, Wang Ci came requesting their assistance.

Ye Yuming couldn't decide himself, quickly reporting to the Agricultural Committee. Wu Nanhai had long coveted the academy fields outside the west gate. Hearing this, he immediately agreed, telling Ye Yuming to accept and provide "VIP" treatment technical services.

The Heaven and Earth Society and Lingao County Educational Officer Wang Ci signed a technical service contract—strictly speaking, this wasn't a technical service contract but more like a management contract. Academy fields now had barely a few struggling official tenants—no laborers otherwise. Everything depended on the Society.

This matter drew Wu De's keen attention—this was the transmigrator collective's first step into Lingao's official lands. He reported to the Executive Committee, and everyone agreed this was an excellent opportunity to deepen control of Lingao county government. Though the academy was merely an educational institution, it managed all county scholars. Gaining good reputation in this matter would greatly help win local intellectuals' hearts.

Finally, following Chinese customs, this originally simple commercial activity was elevated to political importance. Both county yamen and Executive Committee "highly valued" it, sending personnel for "close consultations."

Prefect Wu preferred not provoking these Shorn Bandits, but he couldn't obstruct Wang Ci. The county's most important landmark Moli Pavilion was nearly collapsing; the academy was dilapidated. He'd never allocated a single repair coin—only Liu Dalin and local gentry donations kept things patched together. For years, Wang Ci had received nothing from the county besides his meager salary. He'd maintained the academy through constant fundraising.

Secretary Wang advocated for this arrangement, citing many reasons. County Magistrate Wu had already adopted a laissez-faire attitude; Wang Zhaomin's analysis convinced him it benefited the county without harm. He tacitly approved. Naturally his personal benefits were included.

The Agricultural Committee commissioner personally took charge—Wu Nanhai became the academy fields project's main supervisor. He brought Lu Jia and Lu Yi brothers to personally inspect the academy fields.

Wang Ci led the remaining academy field tenants, including the Lu brothers' father Lu Da—the fields' overseer, a semi-manager whose appearance was no better than the others. This dozen people waited at field's edge, respectfully welcoming this "Chief's" arrival.

Wu Nanhai exchanged pleasantries with Wang Ci. The educational officer was at least a *xiucai*; though he couldn't speak Mandarin, he could manage crude Cantonese. Combining speech and gestures, they communicated without interpreters.

Wang Ci was seeing a "Shorn Bandit" leader up close for the first time. Finding this person with proper features and kind expression, not the fierce villain imagined, he felt relieved.

"This time we trouble Mr. Wu." Wang Ci bowed. "Farming is no small matter. Academy field quality affects Lingao's scholarly morale..."

"I understand." Wu Nanhai smiled. "Rest assured—come autumn, there'll be a good harvest!"

Wang Ci thought: this man boasts right away without even basic pleasantries—truly an overseas barbarian.

"Then we rely on everyone."

"This is the fields' overseer, Lu Da." Wang Ci called. "Come greet Master Wu!"

Lu Da ran over and kowtowed. Wu Nanhai was meeting his disciples' father for the first time. Thin and small, typical traditional farmer, blue cotton clothes patched to tatters—barely better than a beggar.

Wu Nanhai first inspected the academy fields, repeatedly expressing regret. These fields were far better than the Meitai Yang land—near the river, easy irrigation, no waterlogging problems. Excellent local land.

Lu Da respectfully presented the field register. Wu Nanhai couldn't read the hieroglyphic-like diagrams, only asking: "How much land? How much paddy, how much dry?"

"Reporting to Master: 326 *mu* 4 *fen* paddy, 115 *mu* 1 *fen* dry, 13 *mu* garden land."

"No other land?"

"None."

"What do you plant?"

Lu Da reported the main crop was rice; dry fields grew local millet. Some tenants grew sweet potatoes and peanuts, but little.

Plenty of land but lacking cultivators. Lu Da had planned recruiting hired hands for fallow land. But calculations showed: hiring hands to farm all fallow land meant paying more taxes—he'd not only gain nothing but lose money. Better to leave it fallow.

The garden land was most useful: growing vegetables, plus using squash and such to feed pigs—these tenant households barely survived.

Wu Nanhai had his assessment and began planning his academy field transformation.

One morning, laborers from Bairren Commune arrived carrying tools, pushing newly-produced "Purple Lightning" mass-production wheelbarrows, appearing outside the west gate. Students studying surveying brought crude measuring instruments. Amid the commotion, a branch began extending from the Bairren-Lingao highway, leading straight to the west gate.

Building roads before working was the transmigrator collective's consistent style. Lu Da watched the bustling road construction dumbfounded—wasn't the Society supposed to help with farming? Why were they first building roads to the fields? He'd thought they'd deliver seeds, send a few people for guidance—hadn't expected this.

He hurried to bring the academy fields' able-bodied tenants out, encountering "Chief Wu" leading the team, his two sons beside him carrying green satchels. Lu Da was about to kneel and kowtow when Wu Nanhai stopped him.

"No need for ceremony. Gather all academy field tenant households—I need to count population and assign work."

"Able-bodied men are all here awaiting Chief's orders—"

"Bring out women, elderly, and children too. Lu Jia, prepare registration!"

"Yes!" Lu Jia took out a notebook from his satchel.

"I'll fetch them." Lu Da wondered what was happening. Without daring to delay, he rushed to a side street by the West Gate where the tenants lived, summoning all household members—elderly, women, children, none excluded.

The count showed seven tenant households, over forty people of all ages. All checked and registered. Then Lu Jia, following the pre-made plan, assigned work based on gender and physical condition. Strangely, all able-bodied men were told to stay, awaiting further notice.

The road crew was laboring while another work team arrived—bringing tools, vehicles, oxen, and horses. Leveling land, digging channels. The haphazard, crisscrossing field ridges were all demolished, replaced by large square grid fields. Crude earthen ditches became a crisscrossing channel system with separate irrigation and drainage.

Then came herds of cattle. These oxen pulled huge iron-and-wood agricultural machinery. Before diesel and steam engines, America had already developed large draft-animal farm machinery—some requiring four horses, others over a dozen. Lu Da was seeing such large machinery for the first time—here modified for ox-power. Over a dozen oxen spread across the field, dragging massive equipment for deep plowing. The spectacle drew many passersby who stood watching, reluctant to leave.

The entire transformation site buzzed like a hornet's nest. This massive concentration of manpower and materials for agricultural production deeply impressed Lu Da:

"Farming can be done like this!" he muttered. He saw his elder son standing imperiously on a field ridge, holding some strange object and gesturing. His younger son held a wooden board, writing something. Peering closer, the board had paper clamped with a large iron clip, covered in writing and hieroglyphic-like marks—he'd heard these were "Arabic numerals," numbers Australians used. Lu Da couldn't even recognize Chinese numerals; seeing his sons fluently writing while occasionally shouting at workers, he felt a bit proud—the boys had made something of themselves! But also a bit sour—he himself hadn't advanced at all...

His reflections didn't last long. Academy field tenant men, led by Lu Yi, were all assembled and sent to Bairren Commune for fifteen days of Society farming training.

Training participants included not just academy tenants but other Society planting promotion customers. Per notice, each household sent one to three people. Most were landlords themselves and household laborers—small landlords often farmed personally. Fu Buer came with his household's hired hand.

Wu Nanhai's curriculum focused on common crop cultivation and field management. These farming methods were proven effective through long practice. He'd discovered Lingao's agricultural technology level was extremely low—many planting techniques and tools already widely used in Ming-era elsewhere were completely absent here. He'd asked the educational officer if local bookshops sold farming manuals—the officer said there were no bookshops at all. Buying books required going to the prefectural capital. As for important classical farming texts, even the famous *Qimin Yaoshu* was unknown to scholars like Wang Ci.

Never mind 21st-century modern agriculture—even 17th-century advances hadn't been absorbed. So Wu Nanhai's textbook prioritized simplicity, incorporating contemporary advanced techniques, focusing on rice, wheat, and sweet potato cultivation. In trendy terms: "appropriate to current social productivity levels."

Clearly, the Agricultural Department's strategy of demonstrating success before promotion was correct—otherwise, with Wu Nanhai's occasionally bizarre theories during lectures, these farmers would never believe him.

While teaching, Wu Nanhai drafted planting plans. He didn't intend giving these customers too many new crop varieties. Actually, he preferred making them single-crop farms.

Rice was the main grain production focus. Wu Nanhai planned promoting short-stalk lodging-resistant rice varieties in customers' fields this year. Given this time-space Lingao's lower accumulated temperature compared to modern times, he'd adopt a rice-rice-wheat rotation.

Though wheat yields were lower, compared to rice, wheat required far less field management labor. Another factor: many transmigrators liked wheat-based foods—everyone hoped the cafeteria could occasionally make buns, steamed bread, noodles, and flatbreads. Finally, the Navy hoped future naval hardtack could be baked biscuits rather than strange rice cakes.

Next was sweet potatoes. He planned planting this high-yield crop in all customers' dry fields, quickly demonstrating promotion effects so more farmers would accept it. Mass sweet potato production meant starch industry; starch industry meant modern food industry. Both starch and food industries produced byproducts usable as feed.

With feed, livestock scale could expand further. Livestock manure returned to fields provided abundant soil nutrients.

Meanwhile, contract poultry farming promotion continued. Following voluntary application principles, Ye Yuming signed breeding agreements with several farmers near Bairren, lending them chicks.

Chicken applications exceeded expectations. Only 20 eggs exchanged for one chicken, with Australians guaranteed to purchase all future eggs—quite attractive. Low value meant even small farmers could afford this speculative risk.

Chick quantities were limited; only twenty households received the first batch. Others could only register and wait. Ye Yuming thought this was fine: the promised formula feed, due to earthworm farming not yet scaling up, couldn't be fully delivered yet. Rashly expanding scale while failing to supply promised goods would seriously damage reputation.

Ye Yuming completely separated breeding households, basically adopting one-household-per-village along the main agricultural villages on both Wenlan River banks. This aimed for better demonstration effects. Additionally, he planned making these breeding households future agricultural technology transmission points in each village.

Besides intensive promotion work, the Agricultural Department was also developing high-yield fields here. Wu Nanhai couldn't split himself, so he entirely delegated high-yield fields to Fa Shilu. Everyone was extremely busy. Consequently, the planned pesticide factory was neglected. After much consideration, Wu Nanhai decided to jointly establish the Agricultural Pharmaceutical Factory with the Health Department—besides producing crude pesticides, also manufacturing veterinary medicines.

After fifteen days of training, Wu Nanhai announced everyone could return to their villages to prepare tools and fields. On-site "agricultural technicians" would soon arrive for specific guidance.

The attendees had been confused by class content—mostly illiterate, unable to take notes, worrying about remembering everything. Hearing about on-site guidance, they burst into praise.

"On-site technicians require no payment—this is included in your service fees. You provide lodging; they pay for their own meals."

Hearing technicians paid for their own meals, everyone felt it too generous. Someone said:

"That's unnecessary—even hiring laborers means providing meals. No need for food costs."

"Technicians eat three meals daily, half a *jin* of rice each meal..."

"Even a full *jin*, we can afford that."

"One chicken daily; if no chicken, a fish works—one *jin* each; plus one egg daily..."

Those enthusiastically offering free meals fell silent. Only Liu Youren from Jialai said:

"No problem—my household can provide this."

"Landlord Liu's household can afford anything of course." Someone spoke sourly.

Wu Nanhai could now understand some Lingao dialect. He studied this person who claimed he "could afford it." Man appeared around thirty, stocky and robust, dressed like ordinary local farmers, but clothes weren't torn or patched—neat and clean, feet in blue cloth shoes splattered with mud. Wu Nanhai knew old-time farmers rarely wore cloth shoes—field work wore them out quickly. Usually barefoot or in straw sandals. They'd carry shoes to town, put them on entering, remove them leaving. Someone this careless with shoes must be wealthy and indifferent. His waist also held a Xiangfei bamboo pipe with a white jade pendant.

He casually checked the personal file. Liu Youren came from Jialai Village, self-reporting over 300 *mu*. But Intelligence Committee people told him Liu Youren actually didn't live in Jialai Village but in a fortified compound several *li* away—a typical rural strongman. The entire Liu Family Stockade controlled at least five or six thousand *mu*. Liu Youren joining the Society was probably testing the waters.

*Note: Moli Pavilion is Lingao's most famous landmark, founded in Shaoxing 2 of the Southern Song Dynasty. In Shaoxing 18, when Hanlin Academy's Hu Quan was exiled to Jiyang Army (modern Sanya), he passed through Lingao. County Magistrate Xie requested he lecture at the academy for over a year. Several years later, local student Dai Dingshi passed the provincial examination—Lingao's first-ever *juren*. Moli Pavilion held high status among local scholars.*
