# Chapter 267 Wang Tao's Ideals

"What about materials?"

"Bricks, tiles, and cement. The fleet left us a few bags of cement, and we have some bricks and tiles too. We'll make the wooden planks ourselves—after all, we don't need much for a covered channel. As for iron nails and lime, we'll just buy them across the bay at the market."

"Alright then. I'll go to Anyoule Market tomorrow and sell off some goods, so we don't have to dip into those fifty taels of emergency reserves."

The next day, Wang Tao took Wang Degang along with Shi Jinxi and others, changed into local clothes, and headed to Anyoule Market again. This time he brought simple gifts of four varieties, as was customary for a new neighbor visiting to pay respects after moving in. Hu Xun reciprocated in kind, sending back two soup-ready sheep as a return gift. He also took the opportunity to bemoan his hardships: maintaining order in the area wasn't easy, the county had no money, tax collection was heavy, and the burdens on the locality were great. Since Shopkeeper Wang was planning to establish an estate here, he would naturally need to deal with the county officials, arrange for a land deed, and share in various miscellaneous taxes and levies in the future. His words were exceedingly polite. Wang Tao naturally agreed to everything. Striving for the tolerance and support of local powers was aligned with the current guiding principle of cooperating with indigenous forces.

Wang Tao led his people on a stroll through the market, selling some distilled spirits and white sugar—both of which were very well-received—and earning some bits of silver and copper in return. He bought several bolts of indigo-dyed local cloth, intending to find a tailor to make some native-style clothes—the marines' Year One uniforms were too conspicuous. But there were no tailors in the market, so he had to ask Hu Xun again, requesting that his household's maids make some. He also bought some rice, pumpkins, and vegetables from the market to improve their meals. Seeing iron pots and clay jars for sale, he bought a few of those too. Just as everyone was packed up and ready to leave, he spotted live chickens for sale at two *fen* of silver each. Wang Tao bought five or six, had the marines truss them up and hang them from carrying poles to bring back.

After exiting the stockade gate, they found a lime kiln on the shore that specialized in burning lime from oyster shells and bought several sacks of lime. Shi Jinxi haggled for a long time with the fishermen on the beach and for one tael of silver bought a small sampan. The boat was tiny, capable of holding seven or eight people at most, but it was sufficient for use within the bay. Upon returning to Yulin Fort, Wang Tao ordered the pots and jars to be placed in the kitchen for use—from now on, they wouldn't have to cook everything in mess tins. At least they could boil some soup or cook some rice.

"You bought all these chickens back to fatten us up for a feast?" Old Di was somewhat puzzled.

"For the eggs. We'll raise them." Wang Tao had the chickens set down. "With such a big courtyard, it would be a waste not to raise chickens."

"Chicken droppings everywhere? It'll stink to high heaven!"

"We'll fence off a chicken pen."

"What are we going to feed them with?"

"Leftover rice. Coconut meat works too. During the day, let the chickens out of the fort to forage on their own; at night, round them up and give them some feed. It's very economical." Wang Tao was confident.

"These would be all-natural, free-range chickens. Alright, suit yourself." Old Di wondered if Wang Tao had suddenly decided to become a gentleman farmer. Then he remembered something and pulled a telegram transcript from his pocket.

"What's this?" Wang Tao took the telegram. It was an encrypted message; the originating call sign was the exploration fleet's *Hangzhou*, and the receiving call sign was Lingao Telecom Main Station.

"Strange, this isn't a Navy Secret message."

"That's right. Shen Yuefeng received it and couldn't decode it with the codebook. It's definitely not Navy Secret."

"That is odd. Didn't they say before we left that the entire exploration team would use Navy Secret for transmissions? Even us garrison forts use Navy Secret for communications."

"And it was sent from the *Hangzhou*, not the flagship *Zhenhai*."

"It's probably a message from the Intelligence or Internal Affairs sections. Only they have that authority."

Wang Tao had his people cut branches from the woods and gather crushed stone from the beach to build a chicken coop along the wall of Yulin Fort's courtyard, complete with a perimeter fence. When the weather was bad, they could let the chickens move about in the enclosure.

Some of the marines came from farming families and were familiar with such things. Seeing the officer engaging so enthusiastically in agricultural work, they became interested too. Someone suggested they grow some vegetables themselves, so as not to waste the chicken and human manure.

"Really? We're even going to use human... stuff?" Old Di was shocked. He recalled the unforgettable aroma of the fertilizer pits by the roadside during rural training exercises back in the day.

"Of course. Otherwise, the latrine will just fill up, won't it?"

"I was planning to dig a drainage ditch and flush everything straight into the sea."

"Flushing it into the sea is such a waste. Let's just dig a pit outside the fort. Flush everything into the pit; put a lid on top, and it won't smell that much."

"I'll say this upfront: when it's time to shovel out the fertilizer, don't expect me to do it—"

The vegetable garden was set up outside the walls of Yulin Fort, in a sheltered corner. However, the coastal soil layer was thin and sandy. Planting directly would be futile. So Wang Tao had them first build a raised bed of about fifty square meters out of large stones, with proper drainage. Then he led the marines to dig up mountain soil from the slopes and haul it back with the hand-carts the *Zhenhai* had left them, cartload by cartload, filling in the bed.

Everyone was baffled by this former corporate trainer's inexhaustible energy; it was as if he planned to make this his permanent home. Bai Guoshi couldn't help but ask if he was planning to be stationed at Yulin Fort long-term. Wang Tao laughed heartily:

"Of course not. My goal is that one day the Executive Committee will grant me a large tract of territory. Then I'll lead my extended family and a few hundred immigrant households to colonize and cultivate the land as a lord. I'm just practicing now, so I'll have experience later."

"Oh?" Bai Guoshi was intrigued. "Where do you want to colonize?"

"Australia, Tasmania, or New Zealand—any of them would be fine." Wang Tao was getting a bit tired from the work. He pulled a pipe from his pocket. Wang Degang, nimble as always, filled it for his master and fetched a glowing wood splinter from a nearby fire heating water. Wang Tao took it, lit up, and took a few satisfying puffs:

"Smoking pipe tobacco is so much better than those damned 'Holy Ship' brand cigarettes—" He exhaled a plume of blue smoke. "As for China, let the Executive Committee crowd worry about governing it slowly."

Wang Degang asked curiously, "Master, where are these places you mentioned?"

"On the other side of the ocean." Wang Tao pointed towards the horizon. "There are great islands that are green all year round."

"Maybe I'll be your neighbor in the future then." Bai Guoshi suddenly found himself yearning for such a life: blue skies and white clouds, green pastures, and snow-capped mountains in the distance—probably an impression of New Zealand left over from watching the *Lord of the Rings* behind-the-scenes features.

"Sure, but would your girlfriend agree to you taking a bunch of concubines?" Wang Tao teased him, pipe clenched in his teeth.

"Zhao Xue—she's not my girlfriend yet." Bai Guoshi was a little embarrassed. "We'll see then. No concubines, but surely I can bring servants and the like."

"You really are an obedient, pure-hearted young man. But I don't think you'd actually enjoy that kind of life, Little Bai." Wang Tao chuckled. "As for the future, who can say? Maybe by then Lingao will have become a world metropolis greater than New York or Shanghai. Being a senior cadre in the New World's great metropolis wouldn't be bad either."

Work on the vegetable garden continued for two days. Everyone also put up a fence around the precious plot to keep out wild animals. Then they threw themselves into digging the channels. Bai Guoshi and Shen Yuefeng went out on expeditions every day. Because Jiang Hanqiu's immigration plan was likely to be implemented, besides surveying resources, they were also looking for potential future colonial sites and land for cultivation.

Old Di himself led another group in digging the water channel. He'd never done this kind of work before. But the Great Library had printed a small pamphlet, *Simple Surveying and Construction*, for the exploration team's use. Following the instructions in the book, he made some surveying instruments like spirit levels himself. The intake channel wasn't large in diameter, but because it needed to be covered with a layer of soil on top, it had to be dug deeper. The intake was set at a sandy section of the riverbank, so the water drawn was relatively clean and also less likely to be discovered. Except during the dry season, the intake would be below the waterline for most of the year.

The channel passed through the fort wall and led all the way into the courtyard. There had already been a water cistern here, but it had originally been fed from the moat and the water quality wasn't as clear as drawing directly from the river. After the river water was introduced, it could be used after settling. Excess water was channeled through another conduit to the latrine to flush the pit, with wastewater flowing directly into the fertilizer pit outside Yulin Fort. The sandy soil would quickly absorb excess moisture. For safety and hygiene, the pit opening was covered with a wooden lid. Wang Tao also drilled a hole in the lid and inserted a piece of bamboo with the nodes punched through.

"What's this for?" Everyone was puzzled.

"To vent the methane inside."

"Can't we use it for fuel?"

"Too little. But if a cigarette butt falls in, it would be enough to cause quite the *shi*tstorm."

Finally, they covered all the channels with curved roofing tiles and then with dirt. After a few more days, once the signs weathered away, none of the channels would be visible.

While Wang Tao and his team were hard at work on infrastructure, Bai Guoshi and Shen Yuefeng, during one of their expeditions, bagged a muntjac. This small deer had tender, delicious meat. After it was brought back, almost nothing was left of it—only a pelt and gnawed-clean bones remained. Even the intestines were washed clean, salted, and hung under the eaves to dry.

There was plenty of wildlife here; they didn't even need to go deep into the mountains. Hunting was mainly Shen Yuefeng's job. He had hunting experience, and his shooting skills were far more seasoned than Bai Guoshi's. To save ammunition and avoid making too much noise, they hunted with steel crossbows. Shen Yuefeng regularly brought back common game like pheasants and rabbits. The entire garrison ate so well that grease ran down their chins. For people engaged in heavy physical labor every day, having an experienced hunter like Shen Yuefeng was truly a blessing.

Seeing Shen Yuefeng bring back game every few days, Wang Tao got another idea. He proposed digging a well inside Yulin Fort.

"What for?" Old Di found the suggestion baffling.

Bai Guoshi objected: "The groundwater here is definitely salty. It wouldn't even be good for watering the vegetable garden, let alone drinking."

"Who said we're going to drink the water inside?" Wang Tao said. "This is a refrigerator! A refrigerator, understand?"

Ancient people had no refrigerators. Except in the north, where rivers froze and ice could be stored in winter for use in summer, the only way to store perishable foods like pork and mutton elsewhere was to use a well. No matter how high the outside temperature, the temperature inside a well generally stayed around a dozen degrees Celsius—enough for storage lasting several days.

So they began digging a well. Well-digging was skilled work and prone to accidents. Although their copy of *Simple Surveying and Construction* had instructions on how to dig wells, Wang Tao didn't dare act rashly. By this time, they were running low on bricks and lime. Wang Tao took another trip across the bay to Anyoule Market to buy materials. Seeing several wells in the market, he inquired and found someone locally who did well-digging as a side job. He hired them to do the work.

The water table at Yulin Fort was very high; water appeared at only five or six meters down. Since the purpose wasn't to draw water for drinking, the well's diameter was only about one meter, with brick-lined walls. The well-digger was full of praise for their cement-sand-lime mortar, as its bonding strength was simply excellent. He offered to waive his fee for the well-digging if they would give him a few bags of cement. But the garrison had no surplus, so they had to politely decline, saying perhaps in the future.

Wang Tao said, "This shows that many of our goods have a market. We don't need to just focus on mirrors and white sugar. There's demand for cement right here in the market—"

"The demand for cement is pitifully low." Shen Yuefeng was dismissive. "You've all seen what the locals use to build their houses around here—lime mortar works well enough for them. It's only for jobs like lining a well that cement mortar shows its superiority."

Wang Tao thought about it and agreed. There really wasn't much here that was in particular demand. White sugar and distilled spirits sold well, but the local consumer population was simply too small. Sales would saturate quickly.

"Let's just focus on collecting resources. Let the Foreign Affairs Ministry worry about the trading business."

After several days of surveying, Bai Guoshi identified a timber harvesting site. It was about three kilometers from Yulin Fort, but close to the bay—logs could be dragged out two or three hundred meters and put into the water. If they had to carry the timber felled each day to Yulin Fort on their shoulders, it would simply be impossible.

Most of the marines' job was to fell timber at this site every day. The felled trees were stripped and barked on the spot, then dragged to the shore with ropes. Five to ten logs were bundled together with rattan into rafts. Four or five rafts made a group, which were then towed by the sampan to the beach in front of Yulin Fort and hauled ashore.

Despite having a sea transport leg, the overall labor was still grueling. Fortunately, Shen Yuefeng could provide a steady supply of meat—small in quantity but still meat. Shi Jinxi also continuously provided seafood. The few chickens also contributed eggs daily. The food wasn't bad. To boost morale, Wang Tao, no matter how tired he was, told a storytelling episode every night. To raise the soldiers' consciousness, he no longer told segments like *Intrigues of the Bureaucrats*. Instead, he told *The Complete Story of Yue Fei* every night, the purpose naturally being to prepare for ideological education for the future war against the Manchu barbarians. He also frequently added venomous barbs aimed at the Great Song Dynasty, drawing parallels to current events and expounding at length to glorify the Transmigration Collective's "great, glorious, and correct" image of saving China from the Great Ming government. After the *Yue Fei* story, Wang Degang would perform a solo crosstalk segment to lighten the mood before everyone went to bed. Implemented this way, morale remained surprisingly good.
