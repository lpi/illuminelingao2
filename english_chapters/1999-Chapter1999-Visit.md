# Chapter 1999 - Visit

Wang Qiyi shook body gently with bumps in sedan, calculating revenue forecast of third quarter in heart. Coming to Guangzhou for over a year, tax collection framework basically turned, fiscal system construction also pushed forward step by step. Only this "Striking Local Tyrants" heard from Lingao to Guangzhou, himself had not a bit action, really somewhat unjustifiable.

"Looks like 'Confiscation Revenue' on third quarter report will look very good lo." Wang Qiyi breathed a sigh of relief, slanted eyes glancing at Inspection Division Director Li Fulai opposite who flipped files out again.

"What, Director Li? Forgot bringing things?" Li Fulai was seven or eight years younger than Wang Qiyi, biggest among Guangzhou Finance and Tax Bureau "Hainan Gang" naturalized cadres. But Wang Qiyi called his title for public and private matters instead of calling him "Little Li" like calling others. No other, this Li Fulai was "Basic Team" Ai Zhixin brought from Qiongshan. Originally he was an inconspicuous small accountant in Qiongzhou Prefecture City. Not long after Senate took Qiongshan "Came to submit with hair bun [traditional hairstyle]."

Not that his consciousness high, knowledge wide, could see Senate was "General Trend." Truly without submitting to Bandits no rice to eat—put plainly called forced by circumstances. So-called "Poor till showing balls."

Li Fulai was Guangdong native, read few years books, apprenticed. Also worked as accountant for others. Literate and knew account books. Person also very clever. Not long stood out among Grain Collection Bureau naturalized cadres. Became person in charge of Qiongshan County Grain Collection Bureau in few years. Even then Qiongshan County Office Director Liu Xiang praised him. Whenever County Office meeting involved tax matters called him to attend. Few children all studying in Qiongshan Primary School. Wife also entered County Clothing Factory Liu Xiang organized to work. Whole family counted as standard Roots Red Seedlings Upright. When Guangzhou City Finance and Tax Bureau just opened, Ai Zhixin mentioned work ability and "Loyalty" regarding Senate of several naturalized cadres intentionally or unintentionally. This Li Fulai Wang Qiyi heard most. As a cadre hung post in old timeline this bit of political sensitivity existed. Moreover as Wang Qiyi observed Li Fulai indeed had two brushes. Thus "Basic Team" matching "Basic Chassis," Li Fulai was appointed as Inspection Division Director very naturally.

"No." Li Fulai immediately put away files corrected body sitting posture. "Director Wang, I feel checking again is more assuring. Don't know what situation encountering later. Didn't you say grinding spear before battle, not sharp also shiny."

"Haha, correct. But gentry like Liang Family, Director Li should not be unfamiliar right."

"Yes, Director Wang. I know one or two about such families." With Li Fulai's shrewdness easy to hear this was talking about his past working as accountant in Hai Shuzu Hai Family. But he didn't mind. He wasn't the only one abandoning Master leaving back then. "I worked in Master Hai's home in Qiongshan back then. Later rumored Master Hai's big ship running ocean was robbed not only capital lost but also owed much. People demanding debt blocked door. Advisors and Big Accountants all left. I naturally dispersed in uproar not even counting as Second Accountant."

Actually after resigning from Hai Family hastily back then, Li Fulai hadn't found next home. Days lived tight. Later heard Hai Family prospered again. Several times asked acquaintances to speak, planning to return. Unexpectedly Master Hai "Declined Not Accepting" all those staffs servants unable to "Share Adversity" initially. Watching Hai Family climbing Australian relationship oiling fire with oil, adding flowers on brocade. Self fell to state almost selling wife selling children let alone, still pointed behind back scolded "Betraying Master" "Deserve It."

So after Li Fulai arrived at Finance and Tax Front, combat power especially strong, stance especially firm. Towards figures like gentry big households always "Merciless," hand ruthless. This related to his unbearable looking back past.

"True too, human nature. Must find a mouthful of rice for wife children. Since you are familiar with ways of these gentry, then you say how will they cope with us?"

"This I feel Director Wang you conversely need not worry."

"Why?"

"Methods of these gentry big households, speaking of brilliant are truly brilliant. If counting one by one fear can't say a small half till we get off car. But this brilliance is only brilliance under old system..." Li Fulai paused slightly. "So-called Great Skill No Craft. Under my Senate rule, Chiefs conquering their ten thousand methods with just one sentence 'Must Abide by Law.' My Great Song Senate stresses Law most, also understands Law most..."

Hehe, Wang Qiyi thought in heart this horse-patting [flattery] skill is enough. Draft you handled compiling had nearly twenty households, now only remaining seven or eight. Whether "According to Law" you Li Fulai opening eyes telling lie Senate "Must Abide by Law," truly no number [idea] in heart?

Although knowing it was flattery lie, heart still accepted it comfortably.

"Director Wang, Liang Family arrived."

Guard following outside car opened car door. Wang Qiyi stepped down car ladder unhurriedly seemingly casually stamped feet. Also put on act dusting uniform sleeves. Wearing stock brought from old timeline today. Not only custom made but shoulder badges chest tags all complete. But because conflicting with existing CI design, shoulder badges and emblems above were removed. Changed to products customized from Lingao Shop 82. Although real gold white silver, fine work detailed making, after all somewhat dissonant with this old timeline uniform.

Police already deployed defense around Liang Residence gate. Gate wide open. Several servants stood with hands down serving. Wang Qiyi just got off sedan, before stepping up stairs, an elder inside gate rushed forward hurriedly. A deep bow upon meeting. Scared Wang Qiyi a big jump.

"Old Man Liang Wendao, seeing Director Wang."

"Don't... Master Liang why need perform such big rite." Seeing such an elder one generation older than himself bowing in front, Wang Qiyi still couldn't pass psychological pass brought from old timeline. Held Liang Wendao at once. After he stood straight, Wang Qiyi sized up this Jinshi [Imperial Scholar] said to have been Prefect for two terms carefully. Saw him in green robe plain clothes body thin. Three strands of clear beard under jaw. Eyes carrying smile but not servile. A look of asking not worldly affairs cultivating true cultivating immortal. Unknown how much higher than Fatty Cui.

"Old Man since returning home idle, illness on body. Movement inconvenient. Son not striving, failed to visit personally. Hope Director Wang forgive."

"Master Liang need not be so. Cihui Hall helping poor saving difficult. Usurper Ming starting war recklessly, Senate properties in Guangzhou City also troubled Liang Family to preserve much. Saying so should be me coming to visit Master Liang first."

"Dare not be, dare not be. This truly killing Old Man. Director Wang, please."

"Please..."

Big households with Jinshi in two generations like Liang Family were first class gentry in Guangzhou city. Not only flag pole at gate. After entering gate, saw eaves heavy heavy, magnificent magnificent.

Liang Wendao invited their group to Main Hall "Serving Tea." After seating Wang Qiyi looked around. Decorations in room sparse and elegant. From calligraphy painting on wall, to antique ornaments on table, all revealing "Scholarly Elegant Interest" of this family.

Guests Hosts sat settled. Another round of serving tea greeting inevitable. Dawdled for nearly half hour before Wang Qiyi cut into main topic.

"Master Liang, coming today is also routine business. One is listening what opinions our taxpayers have on our Finance and Tax Bureau; two is seeing if dealing account books are complete. Just coincidental I am in this group. You Old need not worry about other meanings."

"Where where," Liang Wendao arched hand towards Wang Qiyi with smile in eye corner. "Director Wang words heavy. Whatever requirement Old Man family must answer every plea. Just..."

Wang Qiyi eyelid jumped. This is wanting to play move?

"Master Liang speak straight if having difficulty."

"Sigh—" Liang Wendao patted armrest sighing deeply. "Director Wang knows not. Old Man body became more unsupported these years. Big small affairs in family all handed to legitimate son to manage. Not hiding from Chief, Old Man I obtained this son only after thirty. Spoiled too much since small. Causing him often having willful acting arbitrary actions. Now deeply fear him handling things not considerate, touching Great Song's rules."

"Master Liang referring to Liang Cunhou, Young Master Liang?"

"Exactly that Unworthy Son."

"Haha, Master Liang you worried too much. Young Master Liang public-spirited righteous. I heard early when in Lingao. Since mostly he managing in family, then trouble Master Liang calling him here to chat. I can also know well." Wang Qiyi spoke awkwardly half literary half vernacular for a pause. Liang Wendao heard awkwardly too. But after all meaning was clear. Immediately expressed Liang Cunhou was in study. Sent person to call immediately.

Tea cup on desk moved not a bit. Servants wanting to add water change tea several times were driven out by Liang Cunhou. Just sent away Lin Zunxiu, obtained news Bandits wanting to come door checking account books. This made Liang Cunhou heart thump. True Bandit coming out personally this time, looks like my Liang Family still has some weight. Liang Cunhou involuntarily smiled wryly. Folding fan in hand also opened closed following thoughts. Month Temple of Guan Yu personnel disappeared, father talked with him by candle light several times. Words still by ear then.

"Son, I asked not worldly affairs these years. Family big small affairs all handed you to manage. Seeing you co-founding Charity Hall with Australians, climbing friendship. Then when Australians burned Five Rams Station city big households flocking to fawn, drifting apart from Australians day by day. In this near and far, your mind father knows all..."

"Father..."

"Father knows. My Liang Family received Imperial Grace for generations. Emotionally reasonably shouldn't live ignobly like this. You chest having resentment is also natural..."

......

"Son, have you read Zhi Du old matter?" Liang Wendao hand stroking knee seemed having ten million thoughts. Said with heavy voice: "Father knows you worry this Australian walking not only path of changing dynasty, but also digging root of Teaching of Names. But World Trend vast and mighty. Those obeying prosper those resisting perish. Australians already said clearly enough. Father fear days remaining not many. Other day you be Family Head. Painting one stroke and clan hundreds of lives which light which heavy. Must weigh clearly."

"Pa" a sound closed folding fan in hand. Liang Cunhou gaze like torch. As if determined ten thousand resolutions. Tidied clothes and cap slightly. Then went towards Main Hall hands behind back.
