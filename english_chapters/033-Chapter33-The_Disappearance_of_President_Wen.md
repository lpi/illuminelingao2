# Chapter 33 - The Disappearance of President Wen

Chapter 33 The Disappearance of President Wen

While fighting wits and bravery with the Oriole Society, an unexpected incident happened.

Wen Desi is missing!

That day, Wen Desi went out to inspect the market as usual. He brought two guards and drove a carriage.

According to the plan, he should have returned to the stronghold before noon. However, until the evening, he was nowhere to be seen.

Xiao Zishan called his mobile phone (walkie-talkie), but no one answered.

"Something happened!" Xiao Zishan had a bad premonition.

He immediately sent people to look for him along the way.

Soon, the search team found the carriage Wen Desi took in a remote alley.

The carriage was overturned on the ground, and the horses were gone. The two guards fell in a pool of blood, dead. Wen Desi was missing.

"Kidnapping!" Xiao Zishan's brain buzzed.

Who did it? Oriole Society? Pirates? Or other enemies?

"Check! Check it out for me!" Xiao Zishan roared, "Dig three feet into the ground to find President Wen!"

The entire intelligence network of the Transmigrators was mobilized.

Gao Di led his "Children's Corps" to search the streets and alleys.
Gao Chang mobilized his brothers in the underworld to inquire about news.
Lin Baiguang used his connections in the officialdom to check suspicious people.
Zhao Manxiong even used "extraordinary means" to interrogate several suspects.

Finally, a clue was found.

A beggar saw a group of men in black劫持 (hijack) a man who looked like Wen Desi and get on a boat at the riverside.

"Boat? What kind of boat?"

"It seems to be a... flower boat."

"Flower boat?" Xiao Zishan was stunned. Why kidnap him to a flower boat?

"Could it be..." Lin Baiguang analyzed, "Kidnapping for ransom?"

"Possible." Xiao Zishan nodded, "These bandits usually seek money. As long as they want money, President Wen is safe for the time being."

However, they waited for a day, but no blackmail letter came.

"This is not normal." Zhao Manxiong frowned, "If it's for money, they should have contacted us long ago."

"Unless..."

"Unless their purpose is not money."

"Is it revenge? Or political purpose?"

The atmosphere was tense. Everyone was worried about Wen Desi's safety.

At this time, Gao Di ran in panting.

"Master! I found it! I found it!"

"Where?"

"At White Goose Pond (Bai'etan)!" Gao Di said, "I saw that flower boat. It's parked on the river surface of White Goose Pond."

"Are you sure?"

"Sure! I recognize that boat. It's called 'Xuanzhu' (Dazzling Pearl)!"

"Good!" Xiao Zishan slammed the table, "Assemble the team! Rescue immediately!"

White Goose Pond was a wide river surface in the Pearl River, where merchant ships gathered and lights were brilliant. It was also a gathering place for flower boats (floating brothels).

Under the cover of night, a commando team composed of Transmigrators quietly approached the "Xuanzhu" flower boat.

The team members were fully armed. Xi Yazhou held an AR-15, Bei Wei held a sniper rifle, and others held shotguns and pistols.

"Action!"

With an order, the commandos launched a surprise attack.

"Bang! Bang! Bang!"

Gunshots shattered the tranquility of the night.

The bandits on the flower boat were caught off guard. They had never seen such fierce firepower.

"Official troops? No, it's monsters!"

The bandits fled in panic or were killed.

Xi Yazhou kicked open the door of the cabin and rushed in.

"President Wen!"

He saw Wen Desi tied to a chair, his mouth stuffed with a cloth, looking wretched.

"Woo woo!" Wen Desi struggled.

Xi Yazhou hurried forward to untie him.

"Damn, finally saved!" Wen Desi took a deep breath, "I almost confessed here."

"Who are they?" Xi Yazhou asked.

"I don't know." Wen Desi shook his head, "They didn't say anything, just arrested me and beat me up."

"It seems someone wants to deal with us." Xi Yazhou's eyes were cold.

After returning to the stronghold, Wen Desi recounted his experience.

It turned out that he was ambushed by a group of masters on the way. These people were highly skilled in martial arts and ruthless. His guards were killed without even a chance to resist.

"Masters?" Zhao Manxiong pondered, "Could it be people from the martial arts world?"

"No matter who they are." Wen Desi gritted his teeth, "This debt, we must pay back!"

Through the interrogation of the captured bandits, they finally found out the mastermind behind the scenes.

It turned out to be a pirate leader named "Wang Mazi". He heard that the Australians were rich, so he wanted to kidnap the leader for a big ransom.

"Wang Mazi?" Wen Desi sneered, "A small pirate dares to touch the tiger's whiskers?"

"Destroy him!"

The Transmigrators decided to launch a retaliatory operation to let all forces in the Ming Dynasty know the consequences of provoking the Australians.
