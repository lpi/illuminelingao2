# Chapter 63 - Ambush

Chapter 63 Ambush

The road construction team was advancing towards Bailaren Beach.

Suddenly, gunfire rang out.

"Bang! Bang!"

Bullets hit the bulldozer, splashing sparks.

"Enemy attack!" The workers laid down on the ground.

A group of armed men rushed out from the woods on both sides of the road. They held fowling pieces, bows and arrows, and machetes, shouting and killing.

They were the local militia and brave men of Lingao, instigated by the gentry to ambush the Transmigrators.

"Protect the machines!" The captain of the engineering team shouted.

The soldiers escorting the team immediately fought back.

"Da da da!"

The SKS rifles fired fierce tongues of flame. The militia fell in rows like wheat.

However, there were too many enemies. They swarmed up like a tide, regardless of life and death.

"Request support! Request support!" The captain shouted into the walkie-talkie.

At the base command center, Xi Yazhou received the distress signal.

"Damn! These locals really want to die!" Xi Yazhou was furious, "Emergency assembly! The First Battalion, set off immediately!"

A mechanized infantry battalion (actually taking trucks and tractors) rushed to the scene of the incident.

When the reinforcements arrived, the engineering team was already in a hard fight. Their ammunition was running out, and the defensive circle was shrinking.

"Charge!"

Xi Yazhou led the soldiers to jump off the trucks and charge at the enemy.

"Boom! Boom!"

Grenades exploded in the enemy group, blowing them upside down.

The militia had never seen such a battle. They collapsed instantly.

"Run!" They threw away their weapons and fled in all directions.

"Chase!" Xi Yazhou ordered, "Don't let one go!"

The soldiers chased for several miles, killing and capturing hundreds of enemies.

The battle ended. The Transmigrators won a complete victory.

However, they also paid a price. several workers were injured, and a bulldozer was damaged.

"This is a provocation!" Wen Desi looked at the messy battlefield, his face gloomy, "We must fight back!"

"Attack the county seat!" Xi Yazhou suggested, "Capture Lingao City and catch those gentry who instigated behind the scenes!"

"No." Wen Desi shook his head, "Attacking the county seat will completely break with the Ming court. We are not ready yet."

"Then what should we do?"

"Kill the chicken to scare the monkey." Wen Desi said coldly, "Choose a leader of the resistance and destroy him!"

Their target was locked on the "Huang Family Stockade".

The Huang Family Stockade was the nest of the Huang family, a big landlord in Lingao. Huang Shoutong, the master of the Huang family, was the main planner of this ambush.

"Destroy the Huang Family Stockade! Leave no one alive!"
