# Chapter 63: Ambush

"No need for that—we're all friends, right, Li-ge?"

"Don't try to get familiar with me." Li Jun pulled out a piece of gum as a makeshift toothbrush, dodging Wei Aiwen's greedy hand. "You're already in your early twenties—two years older than I was when I enlisted in the mobile unit. Sleeping when you should be on duty? In the army, your squad leader would've beaten you. And you have the nerve to complain?"

"Situations are different—we're not the army..."

"Bullshit. The Committee treats us exactly like the army. Didn't you tell Xi Yazhou and Beiwei that you most wanted to be a soldier and fight? Sleeping on duty, heh heh..."

"Shh, quiet—something's happening!" Beiwei waved his hand. The two crawled over and squatted at the edge of the hollow.

The morning mist was gradually dispersing. On the postal road outside the city, transmigrators began appearing—twos and threes carrying shoulder poles, driving pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks, supporting the elderly and carrying children toward the town.

"Why are they going in? Market day?" Wei Aiwen found the steady stream of people strange.

"Refugees. Fleeing into the city for safety."

"Refugees—are the Japanese coming?"

Beiwei couldn't follow Wei's logic: "Japanese? Why would the Japanese be here?"

"Didn't the Ming have *wokou* pirates all the time..."

"These people are fleeing from us." Li Yunxing watched the ragged, indistinct figures on the road, feeling a chill. *Can we really communicate with these Ming subjects of 1628?*

"But we haven't done anything wrong." Wei's thinking was still modern.

"They probably already believe we're green-faced fanged monsters who eat children and molest grandmothers..."

Just then, the people on the road suddenly scattered to the sides. A group came down the road—a cluster surrounding three hand-pushed two-wheeled carts. At the front, one man wore an iron helmet and armor, a long saber at his waist—a military officer.

"Looks like Ming soldiers." Beiwei spoke while counting the people passing. One, five, ten...

Excluding the leader, there were thirty men total, plus two handcarts. Mixed in with the crowd, they were hard to see clearly. The cargo was unknown, but judging from the pushers' numbers and posture, the loads were heavy.

"Definitely Ming soldiers—all armed." Through binoculars, this group looked reasonably well-equipped, but except for three or four, none wore armor. Those better off had helmets. Each carried only a long spear.

The carts were clearer now. The first held an iron cannon, dark and indistinct—probably around the three-pounder level. The following carts carried boxes and jars—likely ammunition.

"Wei, take photos!"

Wei Aiwen raised his digital camera and used the telephoto lens for continuous shots—the column, soldiers, cannon, plus close-ups of the commanding officer and armored soldiers' faces.

"Look!" Li Yunxing suddenly cried out—loud enough to startle everyone. "A foreigner!"

Beiwei adjusted his view. Indeed, at the column's rear walked a disheveled foreigner. Brown hair was conspicuous. His hands were bound behind him with rope; he was dragged along barefoot, shins bloody, wearing half a fisherman's straw cape. A soldier behind kept prodding him with a spear to hurry him along.

Merchant? Missionary? Pirate? A series of questions flashed through Beiwei's mind. Seeing foreigners along the Ming-era Guangdong and Fujian coasts wasn't unusual. How had this one been captured and brought to Lingao? Foreign pirate?

"Get me Command on the radio."

At sunrise, the Ming family and the Sino-American special-agent trio had gathered on the beach outside the camp gate, utterly bewildered.

After breakfast, Xiao Zishan—who'd been babbling about the Ming Dynasty—had returned. The Ming family, sick of his ranting, thought he'd come to spout more nonsense. Instead, he politely announced they were being released.

Before they could react, a launch ferried them and their luggage ashore.

The beach camp, the harbor ships, vehicles and machinery racing across the sand, soldiers with rifles... it all seemed too unreal. These bandits were incredibly bold. If not for the bay, the family would have assumed they'd reached the legendary Golden Triangle.

"See, all your luggage is here—untouched. You can check it." Xiao Zishan smiled graciously at the still-dazed family.

Ming Langzhen bent to unzip the luggage but was stopped by his mother, who smiled at Xiao Zishan: "We trust you, we trust you."

"What is this place? If you're dumping us here, at least tell us where we are." The pretty policewoman spoke up.

The elder quickly cut off her daughter-in-law: "No need, no need. Young comrade, just tell us which direction leads to a highway. This place looks too desolate—we need some direction to walk."

"Ma'am, I told you yesterday—this is Bopu Port in Lingao County. That river is the Wenlan River. There's no highway. Follow the river upstream and you'll soon reach the county seat—only it's the Ming Dynasty county seat." Even Xiao Zishan felt he was talking crazy.

The old man snorted: "Bopu? Why not say this is New York?"

"Look—I'm not lying." Xiao Zishan gestured toward the beacon tower. "That's Lingao's beacon tower. Beyond that is Lingao Cape. Old sir, you served in Hainan—you should recognize this place."

"Lingao Cape? Where's the lighthouse? Where'd the Liberation Memorial go—did you eat it?"

*(Note: Lingao Cape's two landmarks: the Guangxu-era Customs lighthouse and the Liberation of Hainan Landing Memorial.)*

"This is 1628—our great People's Liberation Army hasn't come to liberate Hainan yet."

The old man looked disdainful, about to say more, but his wife nudged him silent.

"Fine, Bopu it is. Thank you—we'll be going now. Please head back." The old lady smoothed things over. Xiao Zishan just smiled. When Guo Yi's group was also brought over, he said:

"This is Comrade Guo from Public Security X Department. He happens to be escorting two foreign guests. You can all travel together—better to look after each other."

The Ming family tensed, unable to guess what Xiao Zishan was plotting. As for Guo Yi and company—they too found this family baffling. That morning, Ran Yao's men had brought them off the ship. Guo Yi had assumed the whole way they'd be eliminated en route: first expecting a bullet in the back on deck, then preparing to be fed to the fish on the launch, then facing a firing squad on the beach. Instead, they found an intergenerational family with all their boxes and bags.

"Guo, just travel with Elder Ming's family along the river to Lingao County." Xiao Zishan watched these two groups eye each other with mutual distrust, finding it secretly amusing. Yu Eshui was truly devious. Thinking about what this group might encounter on the road to Lingao, he couldn't really laugh. Hopefully everyone would be safe.

Seeing their heavy luggage, Xiao Zishan called a beach farm truck to take them to the riverbank.

"This is as far as we go." He made one last sincere attempt: "This is 17th-century Hainan... so..." Then he only saw seven backs departing at full speed.

As both groups harbored suspicions—each thinking the other was planted by the bandits—they walked in silence at first. Then the Ming family gradually fell behind.

"Silly boy, why walk so fast?"

"I'm not tired..." Ming Lang didn't understand why his mother was upset. The path wasn't great, but mostly flat. He was young—carrying a suitcase wasn't tiring.

She glanced at the three ahead: "Slow down—we have more luggage..."

Ming Lang understood—Mom wanted distance from those ahead. So the family slowed, gradually falling back.

Guo Yi's group had little luggage; all were law enforcement—their pace was naturally fast. Seeing the family fall further behind actually pleased them. He touched his regained Type-64—though he couldn't quite understand these bandits' reasoning, at least he'd escaped their clutches. Their current location was unknown, but along the way they'd seen signs of human activity—it shouldn't be some remote wasteland. Soon they'd find inhabited areas; people meant communication; communication meant contacting the organization.

"Old Xue, what do you make of this?" His mood lighter, he asked Xue Ziliang walking beside him. The burly man carried an enormous backpack, moving easily through the rocks and weeds.

"No idea." The ABC shrugged. "Maybe they didn't want to offend American law enforcement."

*Bullshit.* Guo Yi thought this American—regardless of skin color—had forgotten his roots after just two generations. That self-important expression.

"Xue, that's a pretty thoughtless thing to say."

"So what now? We don't even know where we are. By the way, did he say we're in... Linshi?"

"Lingao. A county in Hainan Province."

Clearly Xue Ziliang had no concept of Hainan geography—he actually asked if it was Chinese territory? Nearly collapsing, Xiao Guo had to give him a brief geography lesson.

"But it might not be true, right?" Xue Ziliang said.

"Mm. If we were really in Lingao, with all this commotion, the police station would've come long ago. And phones wouldn't have zero signal."

"Exactly. Guo—" Xue Ziliang walked and talked. "We don't even know the basic situation around us. How can we speculate? Let's just get to where there are people."

The terrain gradually rose—not dramatically. They were climbing a gentle slope. The land showed signs of cultivation everywhere—traces of human activity. Occasional small rice paddies lay by the river, irrigation channels dug into the bank... Beyond that, there was endless wild grass and weeds, some taller than a person. Few large trees stood—just scrub woods and bushes. The river flowed on, looking quite clear.

"Let's rest a bit." A rumbling sound came from ahead. Xue Ziliang suggested: "Salina isn't feeling well."

"Really? Caught a cold?" Guo Yi sat down and pulled out his Type-64—eager to check the gun's condition. The bandits returning his pistol was unexpected. Whatever their motive, it spared him considerable trouble—losing a service weapon was a serious matter.

"No, it's not—" Xue Ziliang started to say something.

Suddenly, urgent gong-clanging erupted from the grass. All three froze. Then over a dozen arrows flew from the grass and trees!
