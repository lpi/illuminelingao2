# Chapter 312 - Sweet Port Crisis: Burning the Temple

Xu Yingjie said, "These equipment haven't been tested in actual combat yet. Hearing there was an operation in Leizhou, I brought them along. You can all rest assured; weapon trials have been conducted many times. I only brought them because they are relatively mature."

Chang Shide said, "Just in time for an operation. Some things can be tested." He turned to look at Beiwei.

Beiwei nodded: "Good."

"As for the rest, this sleeve arrow concept isn't bad, but I feel it's a bit dangerous," Chen Tianxiong pondered for a moment. "Make it emergency equipment for the subordinates. I want five sets of chainmail vests. Although I have protection myself, the managers at the sugar refinery don't; I'm asking on their behalf."

"We can't make too many chainmail vests right now; materials are limited. Only two sets. I brought four sets of sleeve arrows; equip them to the subordinates first."

At midnight, the moon had already moved west, obscured by floating clouds, leaving everything on the earth in a state of semi-darkness. Dew floated on the ground, and the group gathered in the courtyard was already slightly damp. Li Yunsheng's sweat-soaked body felt a bit cool under the breeze.

Seeing the moon pass the zenith, he felt uneasy, constantly looking towards the direction of Xuwen County.

Li Yunsheng was one of the few indigenous members of the Special Reconnaissance Team brought by Beiwei from Lingao. Like the Army and Navy, the Special Recon Team had begun absorbing indigenous soldiers, but the standards were particularly strict. First, they had to be orphans with no ties; second, they had to be young—those over fourteen were rejected. Those with vagrant habits, slow reactions, or who loved to play petty tricks were all rejected. Finally, they had to pass a series of physical and skill tests—truly one in a hundred. Except for drill and cultural classes which were the responsibility of the Military and Political School, everything else was conducted within the Special Recon Team. They ate, lived, and trained together with the transmigrators of the Special Recon Team to form a strong sense of belonging and combat camaraderie.

Beiwei instructed the team members: "Treat the cadets like your sons and brothers! They are not only the future seeds of the Special Recon Team! They are also the future guards of the Transmigation regime."

These cadets had only been trained for three months, and their missions were mainly reconnaissance. This was Li Yunsheng's first time going out alone to execute a mission.

He disguised himself as a betel nut vendor, hawking his wares all the way from Xuwen County directly to Hai'an Street. To avoid suspicion, he kept selling until afternoon, finally circling around to the Zou Monk's Temple. Using the opportunity of selling betel nuts, he toured the front and back, inside and out. Following his usual training requirements, he memorized the building structure and every entrance and exit. Then he returned to Hai'an Street, found a dilapidated temple to rest, and didn't come out until it was completely dark to wait at the intersection.

According to the plan, at midnight, Chief Bei would personally bring people to meet him, and then take action based on the intelligence.

While he was getting anxious, he saw a row of figures walking swiftly from the field ridges. There were vague white cloth strips on their arms—the identification signal. He hurriedly asked:

"Password?"

"Sweep!" It was Beiwei's voice; he had indeed led the team personally.

The whole team had fifteen people, including those Beiwei brought from Lingao last time and the newcomers this time. Spirits were high and courage full. Xu Yingjie also tagged along, aiming to observe the practical effects of the weapons on site.

Everyone gathered in a circle, hiding in a chaotic graveyard by the roadside. Li Yunsheng reported the intelligence he had gathered during the day and roughly drew the topography of the Zou Monk's Temple on the ground with twigs and small stones.

According to Li Yunsheng's description, the Zou Monk's Temple was large, with as many as four courtyards deep.

"The punks are all gathered in the side rooms and under the eaves of the first courtyard," Li Yunsheng gestured. "So after dark, the temple sexton closed the gate to the second courtyard. The main gate closes relatively late. Besides the main gate, there is a back door behind the temple, but it doesn't connect to the front courtyard."

Based on his intelligence, Beiwei quickly formulated a plan. He divided the fifteen people into four groups, specified each group's combat division of labor, and then strictly laid down discipline: "This is close to Hai'an Street. Unless absolutely necessary, shooting is forbidden. Try to resolve the battle with knives and crossbows. Don't leave a single thing behind!"

"Move out!" Beiwei pulled down his hood.

With Li Yunsheng as the guide, walking in front with Beiwei, they followed the vegetable gardens, wheat fields, ditches, graves, and tree rows on the periphery of Hai'an Street, all the way to the back of a collapsed pavilion north of the Zou Monk's Temple. The team members silently took cover, watching the temple. Under the moonlight obscured by floating clouds, the surrounding scenery was clearly visible.

The temple gate was actually half open. Two punks, probably drunk, were snoring asleep under the threshold. There were faint lights inside.

Beiwei carefully observed the surroundings with the only infrared telescope. Although the Zou Monk's Temple was on Hai'an Street, it was actually at the end of the street. The surroundings were very desolate, full of vegetable plots and chaotic grave piles. Only the open ground in front of the temple looked somewhat decent, with many sheds for small businesses set up—now it was midnight, so the sheds were naturally empty.

A few minutes later, the temple door suddenly opened. Two people came out, each carrying something, looking around furtively before heading towards their hiding place.

They slipped along the edge of the vegetable garden. Probably seeing no one around, they straightened up and walked over nonchalantly. Just as they rounded the corner, two team members hiding there silently pounced from behind, tackling them by the waist. The two punks were startled and were about to shout when their throats were choked by hands. They were dragged behind a grave, knife points aimed at their chests.

The two punks were scared into lying back against the grave mound. They thought they were being robbed by bandits and begod repeatedly: "Great Kings spare our lives! The little ones have a few taels of silver on us, we offer it all to the Great Kings."

"No taking!" A team member flashed his knife.

"Are you Zhao Jijiao's men?"

The two looked at each other, seemingly realizing who the visitors were. One of them had already retracted half of his fear, grinning cheekily: "I wondered who it was, so it's the people from Huanan—"

Beiwei flicked his wrist, and a dagger sank into the man's chest. The man's eyes went wide instantly, his face full of disbelief, and he died.

Everyone immediately smelled a stench. The other one had lost control of his bowels.

"Are you Zhao Jijiao's subordinate?"

"Yes, yes, this lowly one is."

The terrified punk answered hurriedly, daring not to put on an indifferent hooligan act anymore.

"What were you doing going out at midnight?"

"Going to Huanan to set fire."

Searching their belongings, it was indeed true. Each carried a bundle of firewood stuffed with oil-soaked dry twigs, and they had fire starters on them.

"Who told you to go?"

"It, it was our boss."

"Zhao Jijiao?"

"Yes, yes, it's him."

"Who gave the money for the arson?"

"Heard Zhao Jijiao say it was given by Third Master Zhu."

"How much?"

"This the lowly ones don't know; silver and money are all managed by Zhao Jijiao. We get one tael for going to set a fire once. Ten taels if something burns!"

The price was really not small. Beiwei listened to the Q&A. Master Zhu, you are truly generous.

"Where is Zhao Jijiao?"

"Just, just gambling inside the front hall."

"How many people are inside?"

"Twenty-something."

"Are they all inside?"

"One went out to set a fire yesterday and hasn't come back! There are also a few drinking outside."

"How many haven't returned?"

"Three or four. People come and go; this lowly one doesn't know fully. Beg the Master for mercy!"

"Does Zhao Jijiao have any acquaintances or friends outside?"

"Just a regular whore he visits sometimes."

Seeing the questioning was about done, Beiwei nodded. The interrogator thrust the knife forward, finishing him off.

They stripped the corpses and threw them into a deep pit in the chaotic graveyard—unclaimed bodies were often dumped here. The group headed straight for the Zou Monk's Temple. Beiwei left one person to keep watch outside the temple, led seven others to climb a human ladder over the north wall, stepped on the wall to climb a large pine tree, and slipped into the back of the first courtyard hall.

The front hall was small in scale and looked quite dilapidated—completely mismatched with the halls behind. Moreover, there was a high wall separating the front and back. This was because the first courtyard had long been a gathering place for beggars, vagrants, and punks. To give these people a place to shelter from wind and rain and avoid nagging trouble, the renovation simply abandoned the first courtyard, directly refurbishing and expanding the rear three courtyards. Once the middle door was closed, it became a self-contained entity.

From the windows of the front hall, light shone out, accompanied by the noise of gambling and the gibberish of drunks. This group really knew how to enjoy nightlife.

Under the gable wall, piles of thoroughly dried firewood and baskets of clear oil were stacked, along with many bamboo torches imported from north-south goods firms—the heads of these torches were processed to ignite easily and burn for a long time.

Beiwei led his men along the gable wall to the door. Squatting in the shadows and looking inside, the front hall didn't even have clay statues anymore, only empty pedestals and an incense table. A group of people was gathered around it, shouting and gambling. The floor on both sides was covered in straw, with people sleeping in disarray.

Along the walls, there were many sticks of various sizes, presumably their weapons—using knives was a felony; the punks were very legally continuous and absolutely wouldn't let anyone catch them on that handle, so they strictly used sticks when committing violence.

He soon confirmed that Zhao Jijiao was in the crowd. Capture the brigands, capture the king first; this man absolutely could not be allowed to live. Beiwei shrank back and signaled. Two team members rushed to the main gate, silently dispatched the sleepers on the threshold, dragged the bodies in, and dumped them under the gable. Several people busied themselves around the perimeter.

"Action!"

The four windows of the hall were smashed simultaneously, and four incendiary grenades werethrown in. These were the Molotov cocktails of this timeline—renamed Xu Yingjie Cocktails in this timeline to honor his great self-sacrifice in concocting this disgusting mixture.

The porcelain bottles shattered on the ground, and flames ignited immediately. This flame not only had an extremely high temperature but also strong adhesion; it could sustain combustion even on steel plates until the fuel was consumed, far more intense than throwing torches.

One of the first batch of grenades fell on a straw bed, and flames leaped up instantly. Before the people inside could react, a second batch was thrown in. One hit directly on the gambling table; the burning mixture splashed onto people, instantly setting them on fire. Screams and cries for help erupted into chaos.

"Quick, put out the fire!"

"It's burning, it's burning!"

"Go get water!"

Amidst the chaos, many bamboo tubes were thrown in, bursting on the ground. Grey powder exploded everywhere; the choking smell of pepper made the people inside cough and sneeze, making the scene even more chaotic.

"Someone's crashing the place! Grab weapons!" Zhao Jijiao reacted quickly, kicking over the burning table. Covering his nose with his sleeve, he quickly extricated himself from the pile of people to grab a stick from the side. Just then, a large black object was thrown through the window, landing at the base of the wall and shattering with a snap, splashing liquid all over him.

Zhao Jijiao licked it—it was oil!

This was clearly the clear oil he had bought, prepared to set fire to Huanan!

His mind worked extremely fast; this was giving him a taste of his own medicine. It must be Huanan's men!

They wanted to burn them to death!

Thinking of this, Zhao Jijiao was terrified out of his wits. Forget the stick; he roared: "Everyone run! Huanan's men are he—"

Before the word "here" could leave his mouth, several more grenades were thrown in. One landed right beside him. The splashing high-temperature flames ignited the surrounding clear oil. He let out a scream and was instantly swallowed by the fire.

Those quickest to react ran to the hall door, only to find it already aflame. Unbeknownst to them, dry wood had been piled at the door and was burning fiercely. The bravest rushed out, only to be shot back by crossbows from those waiting outside. The arrow-struck men fell directly into the fire, screamed once, and stopped moving.

The dry wood and clear oil piled under the gable walls were ignited. The sea breeze blew strongly, and the entire front hall was soon enveloped in flames.

The fire grew larger and larger. Screams and cries for help were carried far by the wind, but this place was still some distance from Hai'an Street. Being midnight, the street's fire brigade dared not come out alone to save it.

Beiwei listened intently. In the distance, the fire gongs signaling an emergency were beating loudly; presumably, the local militia was also gathering.

Running from Hai'an Street to here would take at least five minutes. By the time they finished forming up and set out, his men would be long gone.

Beiwei asked, "Has the fire spread to the back?"

"No," a team member reported. "There is some distance, and the partition wall is a fire wall. Probably when building it, they feared fire in the front courtyard."

"Mm." Beiwei responded. That was best. Not to protect cultural relics, but the Zou Monk's Temple was, after all, renovated collectively by the Hai'an sugar merchants. Burning it completely would provoke them too much.

"Anyone come out from the back?"

"Heard movement of people getting up, but no one opened the door! Sounds like someone is splashing water on the door from behind!"

This was a measure to prevent the fire from spreading. Them not coming out relieved Beiwei; he didn't want unnecessary killing.

Seeing the fire was already massive and the sounds inside gradually fading, he waved his hand: "Withdraw!"
