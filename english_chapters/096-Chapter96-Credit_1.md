# Chapter 96 - Credit (1)

"What is the use of this work point?" He said, "Work points can now be exchanged for extra food. Equivalent to money. Want to eat more fish? Use work points to buy. Want to eat more rice? Same." He paused, "In the future, you can also use this work point to buy more things, such as those farm tools and tools. As long as work points are enough, they can all be sold to you..."

At this time, someone raised his hand timidly. It was Ma Peng: "Then can I buy rice for my mother to eat?" Probably afraid that Wu De thought he wanted to escape, "I can bring my mother here to eat..."

Everyone laughed in an uproar: "Lost your mind? What use do the Masters have for your old mother."

"Of course you can." Wu De seized this opportunity to preach his new policy, "This is the money you earned. How to use it is your freedom. In the future, we will launch more things that can be bought with work points."

Some people whispered below, whispering to each other. Everyone was obviously very interested in getting paid for work. Someone continued to ask: "Then do we have to pay work points to eat the rice we eat every day now?"

"No need. As I said before, it is exchanged for extra meals." Wu De explained that the food supply was still based on two meals, one dry and one thin.

"Master Wu said in the past that those who work well can turn into 'employees'. Do 'employees' also earn work points?"

"Earn." Wu De explained the difference between the two. The work point income of employees would be higher than theirs. For the same work, they get 1 work point, employees get 1.2 work points—explaining what a decimal point is was not easy, worrying Xiong Buyou to death. Finally, two fruits were used: one fruit represents 1.0, and the other cut into 10 slices, take out 2 slices, counted as 0.2. Such an intuitive education method finally explained it clearly.

Employees enjoy free three meals supply of two dry and one thin, housing provided, and in the future, giving some private plots can also be considered—such conditions made many people envious. However, the concern that being an employee meant following bandits made most people have no hope for this bright prospect.

Wu De knew their concerns, so he didn't say too much. overly enthusiastic propaganda would be counterproductive. Chinese farmers are the most realistic and also the most suspicious. Without tangible benefits, they won't easily get on your pirate ship.

Sure enough, everyone was skeptical about this work point system. Some people thought it was deceptive. Asking captives to work and giving money, where in the world is such a good thing. But since then, Zhang Xingjiao was responsible for assigning work and recording points every day. After a week—they already knew that "Chiefs" calculated days in units of seven days a week—everyone received varying amounts of work point coupons, ranging from seven points to ten points. This work point coupon had four different denominations: one fen, one li, two li, and five li.

Given that work point coupons were actually a disguised currency, the issuance of work point coupons was evaluated by economic professionals of the Planning Committee. After discussion, it was considered that there was no problem. Work point coupons were actually a grain-standard internal circulation coupon. They could only be exchanged for food in the two cafeterias of the transmigrators. The issuance and usage scope were very small. As long as the transmigrators had enough grain in their hands, maintaining their basic credit was no problem.

Moreover, the value of the work point coupon itself was insignificant. One work point could be exchanged for a bowl of dry rice (100 grams of rice), a bowl of porridge cost half a work point (50 grams of rice), and a salted fish cost two work points.

The work points earned every day could actually only improve meals limitedly. The consumption of the transmigrators' food reserve was negligible. Furthermore, just as Wu Nanhai said: "If half a year after landing, we still don't have the agricultural ability to feed laborers, it's better to commit mass suicide for a quick end."

As the first attempt to issue currency, for caution, a financial working group was established by the Planning Committee to make a series of regulations on the issuance, printing, circulation, and storage of work point coupons. Work point coupons were printed with lithography in the printing room. The paper was card paper brought along. The size was about the size of an RMB one jiao banknote; one li, two li, and five li were the same size as the old version of one fen RMB. The pattern was printed directly with black ink without color registration. The front was the majestic appearance of the Executive Committee Building, the back was the ship shadow of Fengcheng wheel, and the pattern was coconut trees. Only the denomination part used different colored inks to show the distinction. Each work point coupon had a unique Arabic numeral serial number.

Xi Yazhou volunteered to inscribe "Transmigration Central Bank" for this new banknote, but Financial Group Leader Cheng Dong thought this thing was just a rough token coupon, similar to cafeteria meal tickets. There was no bank at all right now. It's better to keep its true color as a token coupon temporarily, not to use the name of a bank indiscriminately, to avoid leaving any sequelae in the future.

Finally, the flower paper head that arrived in Wu De's hand only simply inscribed the three words "Work Point Coupon", and the issuing unit was "Bairen Production Team". Because the printing was very simple and crude, and the paper was not very suitable, the effect was a bit like rough hell money sold outside the cemetery on Qingming Festival, but in terms of technical content, no one in Daming could imitate it.

There was a beautiful black seal script seal on this thing. Looking carefully, it was exactly his name seal. Making Wu De didn't know whether to laugh or cry. What does this mean?

Cheng Dong said doing so appeared more formal and made the work point coupon look more solemn, equivalent to using Wu De as a guarantee of credit—after all, those laborers didn't know any executive committee members.

"If there is nothing on it, wouldn't it become real flower paper head (waste paper), the military currency of the Great Japanese Empire?"

After the work point coupons were printed, they were all handed over to the Financial Group. Wu De collected them in person every week based on the score sheet. Because making payroll is meticulous work, people like Wu De without accounting experience couldn't handle it, so he only needed to bring the weekly score sheet over, and people from the Financial Group who had done personnel payroll would summarize the payroll and issue work point coupons according to the amount.

For the laborers of the Production Team, this was a fresh gadget. Copper coins, everyone used; silver, could also be seen; gold, heard of. Sometimes without money, use self-produced vegetables, chickens, ducks, and coarse cloth to exchange for salt and general merchandise. Using paper pieces to buy things, this was the first time heard.

Paper money was issued in the Ming Dynasty. However, this currency once vigorously promoted by the government had long died under the joint manipulation of emperors and bureaucrats with no financial common sense. Such a remote place had been a world of copper coins and silver many years ago. Although there were exchange proofs similar to silver drafts of later generations, ordinary common people could not touch them at all.

After getting it, everyone looked at me, I looked at you, no one believed this thing could be exchanged for food. Thinking if I rashly went to exchange for rice: Chief Wu said it could be used, what if Chief Wu in the cafeteria said it couldn't be used? Even in the government, this yamen often says east, that yamen says west. Chief Wu was fair and looked blessed, a very amiable person, but buying things with a flower paper head, maybe he would get angry—immortals fight, common people suffer, such things are too many.

Finally, under everyone's instigation, and after getting the guarantee that if Chief Wu wanted to beat people, Lin Xing would go ask Wu De to save people, Ma Peng took out a five li note and handed it over tremblingly, buying a bowl of porridge. As a result, the person delivering food accepted it very happily and added a bowl for him.

The people around saw Ma Peng got the porridge, watched him slurp it down, then looked at the person delivering food over there who didn't look like coming over to punish Ma Peng. After dazing for a long while, everyone swarmed up, scrambling to take out work point coupons, buying rice, buying salted fish. Hu Yicheng from the Food Office who came to deliver food was caught off guard, and soon sold out all the remaining things—no one expected such a sudden buying frenzy, so not much extra food was prepared—those who didn't buy looked at him eagerly. Chewing sounds were loud all around. Greedy eyes seemed to want to swallow him too. He hurriedly made a phone call to Wu Nanhai.
