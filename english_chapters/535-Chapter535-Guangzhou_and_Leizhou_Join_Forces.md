# Chapter 535 - Guangzhou and Leizhou Join Forces

Yan Maoda's current role at the Guangzhou Station was overseeing Purple Treasure Studio, the jewelry and curio shop. Purple Treasure Studio's business had now matured: production and sales were both thriving, and it was doing well in attracting deposits. He had gradually run out of things to do. As a former jewelry-company manager, he obviously did not intend to simply repeat his old profession in this new timeline. Even if only for amusement, he needed to find a new project.

Meng Xian had a different angle. Trade between the Guangzhou Station and Gao Ju brought in large amounts of cash. Most was reinvested to purchase materials and labor that Lingao needed; the remainder inevitably sat idle. This left the Delon Bank Guangzhou Branch, which Meng Xian ran, with very healthy cash reserves.

Holding large amounts of cash was a good thing, of course, but deposits in a bank did not grow on their own—they had to be lent out to earn profit. Meng Xian did not dare meddle lightly in China's traditional credit industry; the waters were far too deep, and its customary commercial rules were beyond an outsider like him.

So far, only a portion of the Guangzhou Branch's vast deposits had been lent out, and the borrowers basically came through the Gao Ju network. Though the loans were reasonably secured, Meng Xian felt the lending scale was still too small—less than twenty percent of cash reserves.

The enormous demand for cash that the Leizhou Station had displayed during the "Sugar War" turned Meng Xian's attention to the Leizhou Sugar Company market.

The sugar industry's demand for working capital was staggering—not only in procurement funds during the milling season but also in the sizable investments in cane cultivation. Beyond the cane plantations the Leizhou Sugar Company controlled directly, it was gradually promoting "sugar-cane cultivation cooperatives." Within these cooperatives, issuing small loans to cane farmers was an essential means of boosting output. And the amounts each cane farmer needed were far larger than the micro-loans Tiandihui was running in Lingao. The sums were large, and the procedures quite cumbersome. Everyone at the Leizhou Station regarded the work as an ordeal.

The two sides hit it off on the funding issue. Meng Xian proposed that the Guangzhou Delon Branch establish an office in Leizhou specifically to issue loans to local cane farmers.

"Don't worry about staffing. Even if Lingao can't supply enough people for the time being, I can run a training class right here in Guangzhou. Micro-loan officers don't need advanced financial knowledge." Meng Xian patted his chest.

"Will the Finance and Monetary Commission approve this?"

"Cheng Dong won't refuse. Leizhou is a bit special—cash flow is explosive, swinging wildly up and down; there's hardly any steady business to be done. Setting up a dedicated bank and stationing a financial expert there—he'd be reluctant to spare one. If our Guangzhou Branch opens an office to run some small-scale operations supporting production, he'll definitely agree."

For Chang Shide, Guangzhou was Leizhou sugar's main sales market. Whether for domestic or export sales, close cooperation with the Guangzhou Station was essential. Leizhou was, after all, a small place that in many ways depended on the Guangzhou Station's support. The powerful fund-coordination capability the Guangzhou Station had demonstrated during the Leizhou Sugar War had left Chang Shide and Wen Tong deeply impressed.

"How will the personnel be managed?"

"Overall, they'll be under your management. Since they're all indigenous, we need our own people keeping an eye on them," Meng Xian said. "As for business operations, let the indigenous professionals manage themselves—that day has to come eventually."

"Do you think they're up to it?"

"Ha ha! I don't think you need to worry about that," Yan Maoda laughed. "Do you really think we're superior to the indigenous population?" He pointed at himself. "Without Lingao's modern industrial-technological system backing us, we'd probably be sold by the locals and still be counting the money for them."

"I'm just afraid they won't understand…"

"Relax. The indigenous people are no worse than us in learning and cognitive ability. Some may even be much better than certain parties among us."

The second cooperative venture concerned trade in Vietnam. The Leizhou Sugar Company had opened a sugar-for-rice trade route, which not only absorbed large quantities of sugar but also delivered a stable, ample supply of rice from Vietnam. Henceforth, the transmigrated collective was freed from the peril of food shortages. This laid a solid foundation for large-scale immigration and financial stability—on this point alone, Chang Shide's contributions ranked among the very top of all transmigrators.

Leizhou's sugar-rice trade had attracted intense interest from the Guangzhou Station—especially from Yan Maoda. If Leizhou sugar could find a good market in Vietnam, then the ever-increasing variety of light-industrial goods Lingao supplied to Guangzhou could also find buyers. For instance, their signature product, mirrors—clearly Vietnam had wealthy people too; from Chang Shide, Yan Maoda had heard of Wu Yujia. A plantation owner of such magnitude could certainly afford a mirror—probably several.

The various handicraft products made locally in Guangzhou should also find a place in that market. As for payment, rice or women would both work. Vietnam, he heard, had always suffered a severe gender imbalance; even if that was unscientific nonsense, the decades of civil war between north and south must have killed off plenty of young men, leaving an abundance of women.

But Guangzhou was too far from Vietnam. Leizhou was much closer—only a day or two by sea—and already had established commercial channels. These were advantages to exploit.

Thus, at Yan Maoda's proposal, the two sides agreed to jointly form a trading company focused on Vietnam. The company's headquarters would be in Leizhou. Trade goods—aside from sugar and rum—and the company's working capital would be supplied by the Guangzhou Station. The Leizhou Station would provide premises and basic personnel. Day-to-day operations would be Yan Maoda's responsibility.

"Old Zhan! How about you becoming the general manager of this Vietnam Trading Company?" Yan Maoda proposed. "I can't be stationed in Leizhou full-time; someone needs to manage things here."

"I'm in intelligence. Taking on trade is a bit beyond my scope," Zhan Tianxiong cautiously demurred. "Besides, commerce wasn't my original profession."

"I don't think it matters. It would just be incidental for you—just keep the Vietnam Trading Company running smoothly; I'll handle the actual business." Yan Maoda pressed on. "And incidentally, you could gather some intelligence on Vietnam."

This last point intrigued him. He was still hesitant, though: "Let me think about it. If I really do this, my cover identity changes. I'd prefer a relatively low social profile for my intelligence work."

"If we're going to do intelligence work on Vietnam, we'd better add one or two more comrades. Otherwise, we're shorthanded," Chang Shide said. "You can't be in Leizhou every day; I still have my sugar association and cooperative matters. Without dedicated people, mistakes could slip through."

"That's easy. There are still plenty of comrades without specific assignments; anyone who gets an overseas posting will jump for joy," Yan Maoda said with a hint of contempt. "Mark my words—once word gets out, people will beat a path to our door trying to volunteer."

"Overseas postings carry some risk, and trading with Vietnam on top of that…"

"Ha ha! Trading with Vietnam means the opportunity to buy Vietnamese girls at will. Think they'd be willing or not?" Yan Maoda clapped Chang Shide on the shoulder. "The power of example is limitless. How many people are denouncing you by mouth while secretly hoping to become 'Chang Shide the Second'?"

"Heh heh heh." Chang Shide laughed with slight embarrassment. "If that's the case, I'd recommend Bei Kai. He went to Vietnam with us. Good man. The other would be Zhang Dabala—that old pirate speaks Vietnamese."

"If possible, it would be best to set up an outpost in Vietnam as well." Yan Maoda was ambitious. "Yu Eshui says Vietnam is split between north and south right now, with huge demand for arms. The Portuguese and Dutch are both meddling; we ought to stick our oar in too—try to fish in troubled waters and force a few unequal treaties."

"First order of business should be taking out Wu Yujia." Chang Shide still seethed over the "humiliation of the sugar sale." Wu Yujia had utterly shattered his protagonist aura. This grudge had to be settled.

Guo Yi offered no opinion throughout the talks. He simply nodded agreement when Yan Maoda asked for his views. In his judgment, a Guangzhou–Leizhou joint venture was necessary. Yet he harbored doubts: might such a partnership invite suspicion from the Executive Committee? The overseas stations had already become tall trees catching the wind; even if the Executive Committee approved, internal public opinion would not let them off lightly.

"We should do a public-relations campaign," Guo Yi said thoughtfully. "The overseas stations' image isn't great right now."

"Nobody notices that Lingao's industrial system only functions thanks to our overseas stations' efforts," Yan Maoda agreed. "Without the steady supply of labor and materials the overseas stations provide, the machines here couldn't run at all."

"All people talk about is how many women we've taken—such a huge deal they can't let go." Chang Shide grumbled. "Is it easy for us? Back when we were earning money for the transmigrated collective, hundreds of rioters outside wanted to hack us to pieces—nobody mentions that anymore!"

"We need to talk to Ding Ding," Meng Xian proposed. "Ask him to run a few feature reports on the overseas stations—show everyone we've had it tough too. It's not like we spend every day chasing women, drinking, and bullshitting our way through things."

"The *Lingao Times*?" Yan Maoda sneered. "The masses' attitude toward that paper—and toward Ding Ding himself—isn't great right now. I suspect the main reason is the jealousy he attracts for being able to sleep with his foreign-mare girlfriend at will." The Guangzhou Station had learned many details of the Maid Revolution through various channels.
