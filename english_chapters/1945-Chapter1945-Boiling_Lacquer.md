# Chapter 1945 - Boiling Lacquer

Although Feng Nuo wasn't too satisfied that the machinery factory ultimately only allocated one new worker who had just graduated from vocational school, something was better than nothing. To actually trial-produce relays, there was far more trivial work than the previous "designing" while sitting and talking. Moreover, these tasks didn't require skilled technicians, so having a helper could free up a lot of his energy. He calculated the schedule in his mind, unaware that the teenager in front of him occasionally glanced towards his office.

Feng Nuo had been neglecting sleep and food for the past two days to study the documents on enameled wire manufacturing provided by Faraday. Generally speaking, Faraday had also trial-produced enameled wire, taking a rather complex route, using both modified tung oil and modified raw lacquer. No matter which was used, the abrasion resistance of the lacquer film was very poor and had to be reinforced with cotton yarn winding. It could barely be used on motors—the downside, naturally, was affecting service life.

"Looking at it this way, it doesn't seem too difficult." Feng Nuo looked at the materials and felt he was confident enough to give it a try.

The electrical department also generously shared some silicon steel sheets said to be of very good quality with him. This counted as one foot in the pit of relay manufacturing. Hearing that he was ambitious about this cause, the electrical department and Senators interested in electronics wrote letters, called, and visited to offer advice. For a time, Feng Nuo's residence and office were crowded with visitors, and his motivation increased slightly.

Once the project started, he learned that there were people in Lingao engaging in things like enameled wire, but that was another research direction. The project name was "Electronic Component Development Group," and the host was his peer Xiu Yuxuan.

Xiu Yuxuan originally came from a communications engineering background. Since landing, his main job had been maintaining the computer room of Lingao Telecom. Although the work locations were different, the work done was basically the same.

Seeing that this computer room maintenance implementation really had no future, Xiu Yuxuan used Zhong Lishi's connections to enter the "IInstitute of Electronics" under the Ministry of Science and Technology, serving as the director—of course, a commander without soldiers.

Xiu Yuxuan was busy "restoring" various electronic components in the Institute of Electronics—speaking of which, the manufacturing of electronic components wasn't difficult; the difficulty was that raw materials relied heavily on fine chemicals, so Director Xiu's work didn't go smoothly.

Now hearing that someone wanted to gnaw on the bone of relays, Director Xiu not only visited in person to exchange experiences on running projects and maintaining computer rooms, but finally sent a set of technical materials he specially collected from the Great Library.

Sending off Xiu Yuxuan, he casually opened the folder sent by Xiu Yuxuan. The first one was a mimeographed booklet "Simple Method for Manufacturing Enameled Wire." Below was a line of words: Internal reading material of the Ministry of Science and Technology, pay attention to preservation.

Looking at the title of the booklet, Feng Nuo muttered in his heart. Opening the preface, although many words with characteristics of the era had been removed, the familiar writing style immediately made Feng Nuo understand that this was a so-called "indigenous method manufacturing" booklet.

Feng Nuo's eyelid twitch jumped again. In the past two years, the Manufacturing Commission and the Planning Agency had issued documents to various departments multiple times, specifically requiring technical R&D groups in the industrial, technological, and military sectors to use "indigenous methods, simple methods" with caution. Pay attention to standardization issues and eliminate overly backward technologies. In particular, it was pointed out that using such indigenous methods must first undergo small-batch testing and could not blindly scale up for production.

But for him, a hundred percent layman, such booklets were easier to understand and experiment with.

"Forget it, make do with what we have. Which of these things in Lingao didn't start from copying indigenous methods? Why should our project align with the standards of the old timeline from the beginning?" Feng Nuo thought.

"The entire production process of enameled wire includes several processes: wire drawing, lacquering, baking, and wire collection. Specialized enameled wire coating is applied to clean bare copper wire, and after high-temperature baking at 300-400 degrees Celsius, the coating polymerizes and tightly wraps the wire, then cools to become enameled wire. This is a continuous production process. A whole enameled wire successively goes through various processes in parts during production without stopping."

This book seemed quite reliable, written clearly, and honestly stated who was consulted and which factories' processes were referenced. A table in the book also recorded the number of lacquer layers, lacquer layer thickness, and room temperature resistivity for various wire diameters, all excerpted from Soviet industrial data.

According to the records of this simple method, the equipment for boiling insulating lacquer was extremely simple: basically, a stove and a pot. Of course, this pot was specially manufactured. The pot lid had a flue attached, and was also equipped with a thermometer, a stirring rod, and a bubble viscometer tube. The stirring rod could be inserted through a small door on the pot lid. The bubble viscometer tube was used to measure the viscosity of the coating. The thinner the wire diameter, the lower the viscosity of the coating should be.

He looked at the equipment and tools listed in the booklet; there didn't seem to be anything Lingao couldn't manufacture.

The formula for insulating lacquer was 17% phenolic resin, 43% raw tung oil, 0.35% lead oxide, 0.1% cobalt drier, and 40% lamp kerosene. Seeing this, Feng Nuo breathed a sigh of relief. These raw materials could all be produced in Lingao. He didn't know if there was phenolic resin, but synthesizing phenolic resin was the simplest organic experiment in high school chemistry classes back then. As for the raw materials phenol and formaldehyde, Lingao's chemical plants manufactured them; tung oil went without saying, this was considered a traditional Chinese bulk export trade commodity and was widely used among the people, playing an important role even in the Senate's industrial system; lead oxide had existed since ancient times, the so-called litharge. This was a by-product of alchemy, a product deposited at the bottom of the furnace when refining silver and lead from sulfide galena group minerals. It counted as a quite important Chinese medicinal material, and ancient cosmetics also used this as a whitening agent. Direct preparation wasn't difficult either; kerosene was naturally plentiful; only the cobalt drier remained. The materials also introduced the preparation method and mentioned that manganese drier made from manganese dioxide could also be a substitute. The Senate controlled manganese mines, so presumably, it wouldn't be a problem...

Feng Nuo felt more and more that this material was good. The basic design of the enameling machine was also there. Among them, some substitute indigenous methods, such as using brick/wood instead of steel for the frame, using multi-groove ceramic insulators instead of lacquering wheels, and using waste materials to manufacture the oven, were no longer necessary to copy in Lingao. Not all-steel equipment and necessary ceramic components were completely producible.

More importantly, the empirical data in the material was relatively complete. For example, the temperature range for boiling, the temperature range for baking, the distance between the wire and the furnace wall, the amount of drier, the line speed of the lacquering process, and the thickness of the felt for polishing all had empirical values. Even the preparation of ventilation equipment and acids and alkalis used for copper wire drawing and cleaning equipment were introduced. However, Feng Nuo didn't need to consider these. At least he planned to rely completely on the Standard Parts Factory for wire materials. The basic facilities of the workshop were also ready-made, and acids and alkalis could be directly withdrawn from the Planning Agency warehouse.

Finally, Feng Nuo noted down the finished product specifications and quality inspection methods recorded in the materials. Since he was going to do it, the specifications and quality achievable by indigenous methods during the Great Leap Forward era were the minimum requirements.

In the following days, Qian Yuzhi was ordered around by Feng Nuo, running here and there to transport various raw materials, and had to try boiling insulating lacquer according to the formula every day under conditions with little protective measures.

Although the order for the lacquer boiling pot had been placed, because it was a special product, there was a certain manufacturing cycle. So what Feng Nuo gave him was really an ordinary iron pot, not even as good as the pot with a flue and stirring port on the lid in the Great Leap Forward booklet.

The boiling temperature was as high as over 200 degrees, and the baking temperature was 300-400 degrees. The smell emitted was even more touching. Gas masks were naturally non-existent, not to mention 3M masks. The labor protection Qian Yuzhi could get was just a Lingao-produced 24-layer gauze mask plus a pair of clumsy safety goggles.

To prevent burns, he wore thick work clothes when boiling lacquer. Within a few hours, his clothes were like they had been fished out of water.

Because the pot was heated directly, temperature control was very difficult. Overheating often occurred. Once the raw materials were scrapped, not only was hours of hard work wasted, but the Chief's face would also become very unpleasant.

Qian Yuzhi was hot and sweaty every day, dizzy from the fumes. When he returned home, he collapsed on the bed like a dead dog, completely forgetting about the beautiful girl in the College of Arts and Sciences uniform living in the attic.

Listening to Qian Yuzhi's snoring downstairs, Li Jianai couldn't sleep at all. Not because he snored—she had something on her mind.

In the darkness, she opened her eyes wide and stared at the beams under the roof—she had lost contact with the "organization" for several months.

This was something that had never happened since she entered the Lingao Quarantine Camp three years ago. It seemed like a heavy stone was pressing on her heart, or as if a cold gap appeared in her heart. She couldn't help shivering, shrank her body further into the corner, and wrapped the blanket tighter around herself.

When she was in the Quarantine Camp, she was an orphan and small, so she was developed by the Quarantine Camp as a "monitor" and stayed for several extra terms of quarantine until her physical development accelerated a year later. Due to her good performance in monitoring work and good physical and appearance conditions, she was subsequently assigned to the Maid School and formally developed into an "hidden cadre" of the Political Security Bureau. Over two years, she successively received a lot of secret training and continued to do internal security work in the Maid School and the restructured College of Arts and Sciences.

Upon graduation, the "organization" notified her that waiting until she reached the assigned job post, a new "superior" would assign tasks to her.

However, this was her last contact with the "organization."

With the passage of time, Li Jianai became more and more nervous. During training, the instructor said that long-term latency or retirement would receive clear instructions. Failure to contact the contact person after the deadline would be treated as defection. But in the few months since entering the Tiandihui to work, no one had contacted her. According to discipline, she couldn't actively contact the previous contact person either. Now she didn't know where the problem was in her situation. The loneliness of worrying about being "abandoned" by the organization and the panic of fearing being "disposed of" by the organization gradually ate away at her spirit.
