# Chapter 1976 - Money Distribution Plan

The Finance and Tax Bureau trio had long had ideas on how to balance central and local interests regarding tax revenue. They even had internal discussions at the Ministry of Finance while still in Lingao, and Cheng Dong had privately discussed this with various bigwigs.

The problem was that the fiscal system involved too many and too deep aspects, affecting everything from the political system to government structure and departmental checks and balances, so there had been no clear statement. Before coming to Guangzhou, Cheng Dong had specifically instructed that this was an opportunity to experiment outside Lingao and Hainan, and they must seize it. They should strive to use Guangzhou as a pilot to thoroughly roll out the Australian Song fiscal system reform. But in reality, the transmigrators in Guangzhou, even including Liu Xiang himself, cried poverty louder than anyone usually. But whenever Ai Zhixin and the others came with a plan to solicit opinions, they would laugh it off, either being vague or claiming they couldn't understand—not that they really couldn't understand, but mainly fearing falling into the Finance Province's "trap" and falling into a passive position financially later... So Ai Zhixin decided to give them a sense of urgency in this meeting that they would have no money to spend if they didn't face reality, forcing everyone to sit down and discuss properly.

"We have two methods, a gentle one and an explosive one. Which one do you want to hear first?" Wang Qiyi planned to ease the serious atmosphere.

"The explosive one!"

"Let your wife say it!"

"Right, I don't want to listen to this greasy middle-aged man's babbling either."

Everyone knew the Wang couple had good tempers, so they didn't have many scruples when cracking jokes.

"Alright, I'll talk about the explosive one first," Zhang Xiaoqi felt her husband truly understood these crude embryos too well. "The Finance and Tax Bureau will divide the tax department into the National Taxation Bureau and the Local Taxation Bureau..."

"National and Local separation? You guys have no creativity."

"Creating another set of institutions for nothing; how many more civil servants do we have to recruit!"

...

"Listen to me finish. Currently, Guangzhou is most worried about having no money. Besides this, regarding own money vs. central money, how to divide and calculate... Mayor Liu, do you really have no selfish calculations at all?"

"No, of course not. Even if I want a bit more, it's for developing and building Guangzhou."

"That's right. After all, tax funds are collected from Guangzhou, aren't they? As the person governing Guangzhou, naturally you want these tax funds to stay in Guangzhou—taken from the people and used for the people. No problem. Right? Everyone can understand. So assuming we take all tax funds to the Center, and you have to write a report every time to use it, would you still be so enthusiastic about tax collection? Would all of you sitting here still look after our Finance and Tax Bureau so much? Probably not. Would you find ways to get some convenient money from other channels? Definitely. Of course, I think this has nothing to do with selfishness; if I were a local official, I'd do the same. This is called 'butt decides head'."

Liu Xiang nodded slightly. He had come out early to serve as a local chief official. In the position of Qiongshan County Director, for the matter of "income," he didn't know how many times he ran between Lingao and Qiongshan, consuming a large amount of time and energy. Although he managed to create a "Model County," he had long been very dissatisfied with the issue of local fiscal autonomy. But back then, Qiongshan's fiscal revenue was mainly agricultural tax—grain—and engaging in construction basically relied on central subsidies for everything from funds to materials, so his complaints weren't too big. Now in Guangzhou, suddenly "striking it rich," his mentality was vastly different.

"Let me tell you a story. Do you know why the National and Local Tax Bureaus separated in '94 in the old timeline? Not because the locals had no money, but because the Center had no money. Before the separation, the government only had one set of tax institutions from top to bottom. On the eve of the separation in 1993, the Central Government's finances were in an extremely difficult predicament. Data shows that the proportion of central fiscal revenue in national fiscal revenue had slid all the way from 40.5% in 1984 to 22.0% in 1993. Central fiscal revenue and expenditure even had to rely on local fiscal revenue remittances to balance. Was it that governments at all levels in China disregarded and ignored the Center back then? Of course not; it was the system.

"So later, adopting the separation of National and Local Tax Bureaus and establishing Local Taxation Bureaus was actually the Center ceding part of the tax revenue to local governments, incorporating income into the formal tax system while giving locals sufficient financial sources to avoid the generation of gray fiscal income. We absorb the lesson from the old timeline, cutting the collection scope cleanly, not engaging in centralized payment to the Center or such stuff. Of course, doing so has disadvantages. First is institutional bloating and personnel waste. We don't have so many hands now. Even if personnel are complete later, taxpayers probably face double tax compliance costs. Also, the tax categories left to you, Grand Magistrate Liu—that is, the Local Taxation Bureau's tax categories—probably like in the old timeline, belong to the part that is hard to collect, has low tax rates, and small total amounts. The easy-to-collect and easy-to-manage ones are definitely in the National Tax Bureau..."

"Isn't this blatantly bullying the locality??"

"Otherwise how did central revenue increase in the old timeline? To prevent you from graying all tax revenue, he gives you some soup when eating meat. That's the meaning, because the decision-making power lies with the Center, not the locality."

"Then how do you think the Center will divide it?" Liu Xiang was determined to ask clearly.

"First, stamp duty, which is easiest to collect, is definitely Central. Same in the old timeline. Property tax, which is easy to determine, has low accounting costs and stable tax amounts, is definitely Central too. Then what remains is circulation tax. Well, this is the big head, but it's hard to manage and has high collection costs, so it's very likely to be handed to the Local Taxation Bureau. But... this tax has a huge tax base, so the Center will likely demand direct sharing."

"This is empty glove white wolf! How can you do this! We do the work, and still have to share with the Center; isn't that working for free?"

"Hehe, that's how it was done in the old timeline." Wang Qiyi smiled.

"Then tell us about the other plan?" Liu Xiang didn't participate in this chorus; his face was somewhat gloomy. He felt something was wrong but couldn't think clearly for the moment.

"The other plan is this," Zhang Xiaoqi was waiting for Liu Xiang's words. Actually, they mainly promoted the second plan, but if they didn't come up with two choices, it would feel like Liu Xiang and other transmigrators were forced to accept. Therefore, the first plan was made quite hastily and emphasized the disadvantages.

"Tax sharing, budget grading. Simply put, tax revenue is shared according to a proportion negotiated by the Center and the locality. This is called budget level. After the National Treasury receives tax funds, it directly transfers the local share to the locality. As for the sharing ratio, it depends on the opinions of the Center and the locality. This ratio can be adjusted at any time; it's not trouble. The benefits of doing this... besides money coming fast and the locality having its own fixed tax source, it's also conducive to streamlining institutions, improving personnel quality, facilitating management, reducing collection and compliance costs, clear tax assignments, etc. Shanghai in the old timeline never separated and did quite well. The bad part... this sharing ratio depends entirely on everyone's efforts in the Senate."

"Isn't it still the Center having final say..." Liu Xiang was unwilling.

"Haha, my Grand Magistrate Liu, what are you struggling with? 'Center' this, 'Center' that—have you forgotten your identity? You are a Senator, a Senator of the Senate; you yourself are a person of the Center! Just dispatched outside. Everyone sitting here, who isn't a person of the Center? Do you plan to settle down in Guangzhou for a lifetime? To be honest, this provincial-level high official position will sooner or later belong to naturalized citizen cadres. In the future, *you* will be the Center in their mouths."

Wang Qiyi felt that the people in the room had stayed in Guangzhou too long and unconsciously identified themselves psychologically as Guangzhou Municipal XXX Director (Chief), forgetting their original identity.

However, this was excusable—after all, political achievement required an economic foundation.

"Leaving aside others, Mu Min, you are the Guangzhou Police Chief, but you aren't *only* the Guangzhou Police Chief. And Fatty Cui, you are the Abbot of the entire New Taoism, not just the Abbot of this Guangzhou Five Immortals Temple."

"Mm, you have point." Liu Xiang suddenly turned this corner. He had poured too much effort into Guangzhou and really let himself treat himself as a pure Mayor of Guangzhou. He would eventually return to the Center. It was returning, not promotion.

"Then what about now? You have to give me money to do things, right? Even if I return, I want to achieve results in Guangzhou before returning."

"This can be fought for. Let's take an example: property tax. This tax source is formed by Guangzhou locals and has little relation to the outside. We can totally demand high local sharing. Bluntly put, just like in the old timeline, for those tax categories closely related to local economic conditions, you can demand significantly higher sharing. Whoever develops well benefits more—this makes sense everywhere."

"Everyone," Ai Zhixin saw everyone falling into thought and decided to finalize it, not giving them a chance to entangle, "our entire Finance Department has discussed internally many times. Most people think the second plan fits our current reality very well: now is the founding stage, everything must be simplified. Adopting a sharing system for tax revenue can guarantee local financial sources and also ensure Central revenue. Now everywhere is engaging in construction; we will definitely support localities in sharing. But putting sharing aside, isn't there quite a lot of direct investment from the Center and Central departments in local construction? Take the medical system: the Guangdong General Hospital in Guangzhou was built by the Construction General Company; medical staff are directly transferred after training by Ministry of Health units and schools; equipment is allocated by Lingao Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Factory, and so on... Isn't this also another type of transfer payment besides fiscal appropriation and sharing?"

......

"I prefer the second plan," Liu Xiang pondered for a while after listening to Ai Zhixin's concluding speech. "How about we vote?"

"Don't rush yet. This matter isn't small; I think everyone should go back and consider it. I prepared quite a few copies of this draft plan; everyone take one." Ai Zhixin felt that for such pilot matters, it was better to consider safety and strive for maximum support before pushing forward.
