# Chapter 2519: Tanka Village

"Kuang Yan, let's go." The scholar called to the servant boy and walked onto a "Qiwei" mule cart.

"Coming, Young Master."

After getting on the cart, the scholar ordered the servant boy to prepare brush and ink. At this moment, literary thoughts surged in his heart; he got a good poem.

"Young Master, the cart is bumping terribly. How can one write good characters? I'm afraid the ink juice will spill all over the floor," the servant boy called Kuang Yan muttered.

The scholar glanced at him sideways and said, "Would your Young Master care about these?"

Kuang Yan had no choice but to take out the Four Treasures of the Study on the bumpy donkey cart. Prepared properly, the scholar lifted the brush and wrote:

*Return Excitement*
*Last year with books and sword returned to Xianyang,*
*Climbing high on Lushan to gaze at hometown.*
*Did not see Qin city selling Zhao jade,*
*But heard Feng prison abandoned Ganjiang.*
*Hongdu creeping grass pulls clothes belt,*
*Dayu plum blossoms laugh at guest's attire.*
*Today light carriage faces strange characters,*
*One area full of dust reading desk.*

*Signature: Kuang Lu, Bingzi Year*

During the Longxing reign of the Southern Song Dynasty, the Kuang clan fled from Zhuji Lane in Nanxiong to Dazhen Township, Dali Fort, Nanhai County to settle down. Kuang Lu and his servant's trip this time counted as re-walking the "Long March" road of their ancestors. Walking all the way, remembering the past of ancestors moving south, couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

Speaking of which, a wanderer returning home always has many expectations and joys. However, Kuang Lu had absolutely no such mood.

Once entering Nanxiong, it was "Enemy Country."

Guangdong, where his family had lived for generations, was now actually "Great Song" territory. Kuang Lu felt both absurd and sad. Didn't know how his beloved Guangzhou city and family and friends were doing...

Nanxiong was the station of the Lingnan Sub-provincial Administration Commissioner in the Ming Dynasty and mostly an important distribution center for Guangdong-Jiangxi goods. Qiwei and Dachang both had distribution points along the North River trade route. In the Ming Dynasty, there were no passenger boats direct from Nanxiong to Dali. Kuang Lu, master and servant, sometimes took boats and sometimes took carts, bumping all the way. Fortunately, the whole journey was arranged by Qiwei Travel Agency. Whether taking a cart or sitting in a boat, lodging or eating a quick meal, someone arranged it properly. The road was actually smooth. Just saw patrolling Australian patrol teams and patrol boats often along the way. There were often checkpoints and towers at key passes. Frequent inspections and interrogations made the atmosphere somewhat tense.

This day they arrived at Dali Fort. This place was located on the Pearl River Delta alluvial plain. The water network was dense, river channels crisscrossed, and water transportation was very convenient. Just following the boats coming and going between various strongholds on the North River trade route, one could return home in a few days.

Originally thought that with Kun thieves rebelling, everywhere must be broken walls and ruins, people having no way to live. But the scenes seen along the way made Kuang Lu feel quite surprised. Although collapsed houses and many traces of fire could be seen in riverside market towns, the villagers going to market came and went in bustles. Traveling merchants were endless on the road. Basically, former prosperity had been restored. Many simple shacks were newly built on waste lands along the river. Looking from afar, they looked like small villages.

"Boatman, what is the matter with these stilt shacks? Why haven't I seen them before?" Kuang Lu asked the boatman rowing the oar.

The boatman pointed to the riverbank with his finger. "Guest is talking about Tanka villages, right? Listening to your accent, you don't sound like an outsider. Don't you know the Senate's grace?"

Kuang Lu smiled bitterly and said, "Honestly, I offended the magistrate a few years ago and went to wander the world. Heard that the world changed in Liangguang before daring to go home to fulfill filial piety. Indeed do not know the changes in the hometown."

Hearing this, the boatman couldn't help but rise in respect and said: "The dog officials of the former dynasty had few good things. Sir not fearing power must be a good person."

"Ashamed..." Kuang Lu was a bit embarrassed. The past events between him and Magistrate Huang were actually mostly acting on impulse. That person surnamed Huang was certainly not a good thing, but he himself was just acting out of temper.

"The former dynasty not only collected fish tax from us Tanka people, but also collected feathers, fish bladders, fish oil. Poll tax silver couldn't be less either. Also wanted us to perform corvée labor. Our taxes were heavier than anyone else's, yet we weren't allowed to study and take imperial exams, not allowed to marry with us, not allowed to live on shore. Not allowed to wear shoes on shore either. Big water fish eat ants, dry water ants eat fish. Big bully small, small bully short. If none to bully, bully Tanka boys..."

The boatman recounted the hardships of life. Unknown why, there was light in his eyes again: "The Senate issued an edict as soon as they came, saying everyone is equal under Great Song's heaven, abolishing all former dynasty base status. Also exempted many of our taxes, and allowed us to live on shore, allowed us to study, join the army, participate in imperial exams. Truly like dreaming! Those stilt houses Master sees were built on waste lands where the Chiefs allowed us to settle. The surrounding waste lands were also allowed for us to reclaim, exempting five years of field tax. Harvest on shore wasn't good this year; there was famine everywhere. The Senate organized many dike repair jobs. Just go work and there's a bite to eat."

Hearing this, Kuang Lu was surprised in his heart. He understood the situation of Pearl River Tanka households quite well: when water was high and fish were plentiful in spring and summer, they could have a full meal. Poverty all year round. for survival, wives and daughters selling smiles was also a common thing. Kun thieves abolished their base status as soon as they came, treating them like good citizens; these people would ultimately not be used by Great Ming.

Kuang Lu asked the boatman: "You also did things for the Australians, right?"

The boatman laughed: "How could I not have! Not hiding from Master: three years ago someone sat on my boat and asked me 'If someone lets you build houses on shore, live like people on land, start a family and career the same, would you support it?' I said 'I don't understand what support means, I only know if there is such a parent official, I'll listen to him for everything.' Later, the Chief attacked Wuzhou and recruited boatmen. I brought more than a dozen brothers to help Chiefs sail boats and transport grain."

"Oh, why didn't you mix into a half-official position?"

"Master is joking. Old man is sixty years old this year. Don't know a single big character, can't learn even if I try. We people beg for life on water all year round, a body full of pain. Every rainy day, joints and bones all over the body hurt. Also living in this narrow boat bending waist all year round, back is also hunched. Don't mention being an official, didn't even have the ability to be a runner."

The boatman's clothes were full of patches. Under the shrimp hat, temples were spotted white. Wrinkles on the face were like scars drawn by years. Once the chatterbox opened, everything poured out. "We Tanka households were base people looked down upon by others. Little old man only started a family at over fifty. Wife was a widow, also Tanka household. Remarried to me only after husband died. Originally thought she was over ten years younger than me, I could always rely on her till old age. Didn't expect she actually died before me! Didn't get to see today. She was a good woman. Washing clothes, cooking, catching fish, transporting goods, grabbed to do everything. The holes in these clothes of mine were repaired by her. Without her, I'd still be wearing clothes leaking wind and rain. I think she must have owned me a debt in previous life, came to repay in this life. She also says so. But why only repay for a few years and left? She died, my soul was like lost. Almost fell into the river to drown several times..."

A cool breeze blew past. The corners of Kuang Lu's eyes were somewhat moist. Speaking truthfully, he had seen too much human suffering; this counted as nothing. These few drops of tears were not shed for this Tanka household, but for this world. He didn't want the boatman to see, walked out of the boat awning, gaze falling exactly on the couplet with blurry whitish handwriting on the boat awning. Written crookedly:

*Tanka born Tanka die in boat several generations of Tanka*
*Cross wind go cross wind come inside awning a life of cross wind*

*Horizontal scroll: Die early is better*

Seeing him looking entranced, the boatman said: "This was written by a scholar for me a few years ago. I don't know characters; friends on water don't know characters either. Guests coming and going all laughed when seeing it. Presumably a good couplet."

Kuang Lu said, "Good is good, just a bit old. How about I give you a new one."

"Good ah. Sir is truly a person of temperament. Our village is not far ahead. Wait for me to go ashore to find a pair of red papers." The boatman spoke and sailed toward the direction of the Tanka village ahead.

"Also good. I just happen to want to buy some dried Xiang fish goods."

"Little old man has no silver money. These things are plenty. Since Master likes them, little old man will take some to honor you!"

Kuang Yan pulled Kuang Lu's clothes corner secretly, signaling fear of eating board blade noodles (being robbed/killed). Kuang Lu patted his shoulder, comforting in a low voice: "No harm. Young Master I am proficient in six arts, complete in civil and martial skills. Ordinary people can do nothing to me. This place has entered Fen River, not far from Dali. I heard there is a team of Australian troops right in Dali. There are also frequent Australian patrol boats on this river surface. Not a place without King's law. Also exactly right to reduce the Australian rule is what kind of River Clear Sea Calm."

"Young Master, what couplet do you want to give him?"

"Winter goes spring comes, joy east south west north bid farewell to old year. Bitterness ends sweetness arrives, gaze lake sea river stream celebrate new life. Horizontal scroll: Great Good River Mountain." Kuang Lu added heavy stress on the last four characters.

"Young Master hates Governor Xiong for losing this Great Good River Mountain, right?"

Kuang Lu did not speak. *Was it Governor Xiong who lost it?*

At this time, Saltwater Songs were hummed from the bow:

*"Three mud piles build a stove ne, sand pot cooking rice no bottom wind stove ah li,*
*Rice va no leftover overnight rice luo, stove pit no strip of overnight firewood ah li!*
*Others marry daughter have a red skin trunk luo, we marry daughter a rotten chicken coop ah li;*
*Others marry daughter have flower sedan chair to sit ne, we marry daughter just boat crossing to boat ah li!*
*Above possess treasure ship below possess skiff eh, without your older brother the skiff so miserable ah li,*
*Rattan strip bamboo strip bag bundle everywhere luo, head shake tail swing like deep sea fresh dragon ah li.*
*Master fix boat but not prevent leak luo,*
*Your sister-in-law sleep down at night look fish swim ah li,*
*Master fix awning but not lay leaves luo, your sister-in-law sleep down at night also look Sky River (Milky Way) ah li."*

The lyrics were sad and sorrowful; the singer was in high spirits. The small boat moved forward briskly accompanied by the singing voice. Before reaching the shore, someone on shore shouted: "Uncle Salmon, Principal Tian and Doctor Hou are coming..."

The boatman shouted back: "Alright, I'm coming right away!"

"What fish is Salmon?" Kuang Yan asked curiously.

"What milk name (childhood name)? That's only for people on shore!" The boatman said, "Little brother doesn't know. My original name was Zeng Carp. When I helped the Chief transport grain, the Chief said, carp living in ponds, the pattern is too small. Salmon is a kind of deep-sea fish. Have to be like salmon, trekking thousands of *li* to find the place one came from. This is called Salmon's Dream. If people don't have dreams, what's the difference from salted fish? I haven't seen salmon, but since the Chief said so, presumably it is very good. Later I changed my name to Zeng Salmon."

Kuang Yan sniffed at this, thinking secretly: *"Kun thieves are indeed crude."*
