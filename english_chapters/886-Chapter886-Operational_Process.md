# Chapter 886 - Operational Process

Specifically, Lingao's standard code system was a knockoff of the NSN (National Stock Number). The NSN sorting rule is 4+2+7 digits. The first 4 digits are the classification code. The pre-1974 code was a 4+7 pattern, with the latter part being a serial number. From 1951 to 1974, a 7-digit code was used, called FSN (Federal Stock Number). After 1974, a two-digit country code was added before the serial number. Now it can support up to 100 million to 1 billion types of items and parts. The Americans themselves used 00, 01, 02—meaning they used over 20 million types in total. Before FSN, there was no classification code, only a serial number; it was 5 digits in the early WWII era and 6 digits by the end.

"Even the US military only used 20 million. Even if we expand to the entire industrial sector, our total varieties won't exceed 20 million. We'll be staying in the five-digit range for a long time. So for now, using a 4+2+5 digit system is fine. Later we can add digits just like upgrading phone numbers."

"The biggest advantage of the American coding is that categories are pre-assigned. Following the category number makes it easy to retrieve any class of things, and then you can quickly find any specific item within it."

Adopting a standard code system laid the foundation for future electromechanical card database management, even if electronic computers couldn't be used for management temporarily.

Scardal took a sip of water: "Aren't we short of manpower right now? We should minimize repetitive labor as much as possible. Code all existing parts and establish files. When anyone needs something, they check first—if a common part can be used, use it. Doesn't this save manpower? Especially for elders working as designers and engineers. It's also very convenient for organizing logistical supply."

"Judging by the internal trial situation in my Ministry of Colonization recently, we're currently only using a few thousand types of raw materials and parts in total—not even as many varieties as in a single small sedan from the old time-space. Two or three indigenous clerks can manage the entire archive. If I want to check the file of any commodity, someone brings it to my desk within three minutes. Even when there are more items later, it'll just be a human-flesh database. I propose establishing a centralized Standardization Information Archive where all departments can come to retrieve and consult information, improving efficiency."

"You're too idealistic. Without the support of the modern IT industry—barcodes, automatic scanners, and databases—standard codes can only achieve low-level functions. Just compiling a cross-reference book will become a complex project by then." An elder who had worked in ERP expressed that this was an impractical "Great Leap Forward."

"It's not that complex," Scardal argued plausible. "This system existed during WWII. Where were the things you mentioned back then?"

He continued to explain: The purpose of classification codes is to assign different things to different people to handle. A major category is assigned to a logistics department, such as the Electronics Section or Hydraulics Section. A minor category or several minor categories are assigned to a person or a team. Specific management is directly assigned to individuals—whoever manages items with problems, non-standard files, or failure to keep up with development gets their pay deducted.

The original serial numbers remain serial numbers, continuing to be arranged in order. This part is managed by a master catalog.

"...Although we don't have computers, these codes can be perfectly managed by naturalized civilian staff using human power. Train them simply in library retrieval skills, mastering the use of card indexes and file compilation. At our current level of technological development, we'll use at most a dozen major categories and fewer than 100 minor categories. The total code vlume will be at most tens of thousands. A professional team of twenty or thirty people can manage it very well, at most adding a few supervisors to check for errors."

Before IT systems, FSN had a complete paper-based system run via forms. This system was used for decades. Even after IT equipment and software appeared, this paper system continued to exist as a backup, only now printed directly from the database for preservation.

"To further explain to everyone how this system operates, I'll use the Hong Kong Shipyard as an example," Scardal said. "Actually, it's mainly form operations. Different activities have different forms."

For example, if the shipyard needs a certain model of 20cm ship nail, they can send a requirement form to the Guangzhou Station. The Guangzhou Station then notifies qualified indigenous workshops or artisans to quote, then signs a contract to buy the goods. Great Wave Shipping, acting as the receiving agent, signs for items one by one with the form, then transfers them to Shi Jiantao. Delong pays based on the signed receipt documents.

Every day, each workshop of the shipyard reports its requisition plan to the warehouse. The warehouse determines the inventory plan based on consumption and stock levels. After the plan is approved, it's transferred to the supporting department to find the Guangzhou Station to place orders. After Great Wave Shipping receives the ships, it also accepts maintenance parts. Based on the consumption rate of parts, warning lines are set; orders are added when the line is reached.

"Similarly, we can apply this to logistical supply, trade management, and many other aspects. I could do all this work manually when I first started working; it's not impossible to implement without complex computer management—efficiency just drops a bit. The purpose of the NSN code is to ensure that transmitted information doesn't distort at all stages of the process. At the same time, all additionally generated information—such as a supplier's capability, the fault and damage records of the part itself—can be entered into the archives based on this unique clue, then forwarded to those who should know this information."

"In this way, the speed of information exchange becomes very important," Shi Jiantao expressed concern.

"We have wireless and wired telegraphs; data can be exchanged via telegram. More complex tables can be delivered by mail."

"I have deep doubts about such data exchange. First, the timeliness is a mess. Second, are you underestimating the complexity involved..."

...

Both sides debated this issue for over ten minutes. Finally, everyone's eyes fell on Wu De, who was in a "contemplative state." As the meeting host, he had the final say on this matter.

"Mm, what everyone says makes sense." He suddenly "woke up." To cover his zoning out, he coughed once. "I think the standard code system should still be implemented. Better early than late—take advantage of the current few material types to establish the system first; it will save a lot of trouble later. I say we follow Scardal's plan and give it a try."

The meeting decided to first use the Hong Kong Shipyard and the Logistics Command of the Amos Army [Fubo Army] as pilot units to implement the Imperial Standard Code System.

After the meeting ended, Wu De picked up his fake BOSS briefcase and walked out of the Planning Commission conference room; he had another meeting to attend. At this moment, someone chased up from behind, taking three steps in two.

"Ah De! Wait up."

"What's the matter?"

Scardal said: "Implementing standard codes this time and preparing for shipyard parts outsourcing—can the Letter of Credit system also be rolled out in Guangzhou?"

"Let's discuss that later. I don't think there's a problem." Wu De had always held an indifferent attitude toward things like Letters of Credit—anyway, the Planning Commission had never been very keen on financial matters. "Just get it passed at the Executive Committee meeting."

"The problem is that everyone seems to lack understanding in this area. Promoting the Letter of Credit system has great benefits for import-export trade; it's good for both sides, not some financial trickery..."

Wu De didn't listen much to Scardal's complaints. He had been somewhat absent-minded since the meeting began—the concept of Imperial Stock Codes was something he strongly advocated. Originally he knew nothing about the FSN concept; it was entirely the result of Hong Huangnan and Scardal constantly coming to lobby him. And the *Weekly Thoughts* compiled personally by Wen Desi, circulated weekly to the Executive Committee, Standing Committee of the Elder Council, and heads of various ministries, also frequently mentioned the concept of "standardization" of all things.

It was under this double stimulation that he developed a strong interest in the FSN system and took the lead in organizing its implementation. But having only a code system merely facilitated management; the objects to be managed were still far from sufficient.

The launch of the Dengzhou and Zhejiang operations was imminent. The Elder Council had no precise numerical requirement for the population to be obtained from these two operations, only saying "transport with all effort, transport as many as possible." Despite this saying, in private conversation with Ma Qianzhu, Wu De believed these two operations would only be valuable if they obtained at least two hundred thousand people. Currently, the number of refugees in Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi had decreased, and the pace of absorbing population at various stations had greatly slowed. If a crisis wasn't artificially created, absorbing large numbers of new population from Guangdong would become difficult.

"Those who come on their own are certainly good, but compared to indentured servants, I prefer indentured servants," Ma Qianzhu said. "They are stronger than average people in work enthusiasm and easier to manage. Furthermore, we also need to change the demographic structure ratio."

The Elder Council was also very dissatisfied with the current situation where there were too many Guangdong and Fujian natives among the naturalized citizens. Most naturalized citizens were recruited from Guangdong. Due to geographical conditions, this inevitably resulted in the largest populations being Cantonese and Fujianese. In Lingao, Cantonese and Minnan dialects not only had the potential to replace the Lingao dialect, but even the official Mandarin language was losing ground. Although the elders vigorously promoted Mandarin in schools and government offices, in production enterprises, these two dialects showed a tendency to gradually become the lingua franca among workers.

In the final finalized refugee transport plan, the Planning Commission prepared to transport one hundred thousand people from Northern Zhejiang and at least one hundred thousand from Dengzhou—the vast majority to be transported back to Lingao, with ten thousand settled in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Additionally, two or three thousand would be settled locally in Zhejiang as labor for Zhao Yingong's Jiangnan industries.
