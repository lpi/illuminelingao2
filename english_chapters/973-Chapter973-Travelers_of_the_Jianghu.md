# Chapter 973 - Travelers of the *Jianghu*

Lu Wenyuan's face showed an inscrutable smile. This island was quite good—apart from the worrisome winters. Upon returning, he immediately made the decision to purchase the land.

Sun Yuanhua was quite surprised when he heard that "Master Zhao's nephew" had selected this piece of land. To preserve Zhao Yingong's continuing influence after his departure, Lu Wenyuan had reluctantly agreed to be designated as an "nephew through the maternal line"—ancients trusted blood relations more than business partnerships. However, Zhao Yingong explained he had specifically chosen this land to test the feasibility of farming saline-alkaline and sandy soil.

Though Sun Yuanhua was quite skeptical about Zhao Yingong's "introduction of new crops," he still expressed strong support. He recalled how, years ago, when Xu Guangqi had introduced sweet potatoes in Jiangnan and Tianjin, skeptics had been the majority then too, but ultimately it had succeeded. Perhaps these two Guangdong men really could develop crops suitable for coastal saline-alkaline land—if so, it would be a tremendous merit.

With Sun Yuanhua's direct patronage, Lu Wenyuan's land purchase on Qimu Island proceeded quickly. Excluding the sand spit, the total area of Qimu Island was four square kilometers, or about 6,000 *mu* of land. Lu Wenyuan ultimately purchased most of the island's land for 320 taels, including all the hills in the island's northern section.

Zhao Yingong had successfully inserted Father Jean-Baptiste Jinliger into the Shandong church, and combined with Lu Wenyuan's Catholic identity, they had formed considerable influence over the Shandong church. With support from the Shandong church—especially the gentry within it—the Qimu Island development plan proceeded quite smoothly. Hearing that "Master Lu" had backing from Governor Sun, the Huang County magistrate was very courteous to Lu Wenyuan when he came to handle procedures and file contracts. Not only did all paperwork proceed smoothly, but the magistrate specially dispatched yamen runners to Qimu Island to "maintain order."

Lu Wenyuan thought this was somewhat unnecessary and tried to decline, but the magistrate insisted this was to "intimidate troublemakers and prevent them from causing incidents at this opportunity." Lu Wenyuan had worked on construction sites during his internship in the old timeline and had seen gate-blocking, lying in front of bulldozers, gang fights, and material theft—all kinds of stories. So he agreed—of course, it still required spending money on gifts for the magistrate, the deputy, and the runners.

"320 taels for the land, 80 taels in red envelopes. Corruption! Such corruption!" Lu Wenyuan grumbled to himself after leaving the Huang County yamen.

Complaints were complaints, but for now the protection of the Huang County yamen was still needed. Once Kong Youde started making trouble, he could do whatever he wanted. But for now, he still needed the "local government" to protect his rights as a "developer."

Zhao Yingong's main assignment for him was to rapidly construct a fortified estate locally and build dock facilities capable of accommodating ships of at least two to three hundred tons.

"As for farmland and water conservancy—just do the bare minimum. The key is ensuring Qimu Island's security. Under no circumstances can Kong Youde be allowed to attack and capture it."

He estimated that when Kong Youde advanced, he wouldn't specifically march along the coast to the Longkou area—historically, he had led his forces directly toward Huang County seat. However, many small units might come out to plunder grain and conscript civilians. Historically, rebel and bandit forces all did this while marching. Small parties running to Longkou was still possible—after all, there were some villages along the coast, and Longkou had a trading market. Additionally, considering that Kong Youde ultimately escaped by ship, if he needed to gather vessels, Longkou—where foreign merchant ships gathered—would also be a suitable target. So overall defensive requirements didn't need to be too high, but reasonable self-defense capability was still necessary.

"I'm leaving Wang Qisuo for you," Zhao Yingong said. "He's a local salt smuggler and military household, very familiar with local conditions. You can use him temporarily, but remember he hasn't been through political vetting, so don't reveal too much to him."

"I know. Anyway, I'm just a landlord fortifying myself for protection. That's all they need to know. Besides, I don't have many naturalized personnel under me to begin with."

Ever since Huang Ande had connected with Sun Yuan, he had cultivated the relationship intensively, and it quickly grew warmer. Using opportunities to visit friends and relatives, he went in and out of the water city constantly. He also gave gifts of Zhejiang local products—not expensive, but good for building relationships. Before long, he no longer needed to sneak in with craftsmen and laborers but could come and go openly. The officers at the gates knew he was a former local garrison soldier with many acquaintances, and didn't stop him. Huang Ande not only became sworn brothers with Sun Yuan but also recruited seven or eight reliable former comrades, frequently treating them to drinks. They had become something of a small clique. He could quickly learn about any trivial matter happening inside the water city.

Though most of the intelligence he gathered had no value for Zhao Yingong, successfully infiltrating Dengzhou Water City and establishing a small network was a good accomplishment. However, he would soon need to return to Hangzhou—once his master left, if his "personal attendant" kept coming and going in Dengzhou, it would attract too much attention. Instructions came through Huang Ande's superiors for him to relocate to Huang County with Lu Wenyuan, visiting Dengzhou twice a month to keep tabs on the situation.

Before leaving Shandong, Zhao Yingong also made arrangements regarding Master Daoquan's refugee collection in Yizhou. The matter of receiving refugees had already gained Sun Yuanhua's tacit approval, so official obstacles weren't major. The key was having enough grain and shelter prepared.

"I just wonder how Taiwan is progressing?" Zhao Yingong knew that according to the schedule, the first fleet to Taiwan should be arriving at Kaohsiung in the next few days. If refugees from Yizhou could arrive in time, they would perfectly fill the gap in the pioneer team. But he didn't know if Master Daoquan's work was going smoothly? The letters he had received mentioned his current situation—in danger at every moment.

Just as Zhao Yingong and Lu Wenyuan were busy preparing to receive Yizhou refugees, Master Zhang was in extreme peril.

Despite maintaining a deliberately low profile in Yizhou and rarely proselytizing New Daoist doctrine, his presence had still attracted the attention of certain forces. Just as he was eagerly expanding his influence while waiting for missionary personnel to be dispatched from Lingao, a group of people had already arrived in Yizhou.

The flood-ravaged land of southern Shandong stretched barren for a thousand *li*. Apart from bleached bones along the roads and the occasional passing groups of refugees, everywhere was deathly silent.

Suddenly, hoofbeats sounded on the road. Seven or eight riders spurred their horses past. In the hot weather, the riders appeared listless, wide-brimmed sun hats pulled low, reins loose, letting their horses go where they would, as if dozing in the saddle. Swords and pouches at their waists—clearly long-distance travelers of the *jianghu*.

Approaching the official road near Yizhou, there was gradually more sign of human activity. Here the waters had receded and commerce had somewhat recovered. The watermarks left on the Yizhou city walls when the flood came were still visible. The walls, thoroughly soaked by the water, were now cracking and flaking under the scorching sun. Many bricks had fallen; at one point there was even a gap of several *zhang*. Above and below the walls, bricks and yellow dirt were piled high—though the people were struggling, local officials dared not relax city defenses in the slightest. In recent years, almost every major disaster had been followed by refugee uprisings.

The moat outside the city, due to the flood, was unusually full—normally by summer the moat only held a thin line of water in the center, barely ankle-deep.

East of the road outside the north gate was a large awning selling tea, water, and flatbreads for travelers to rest and refresh themselves. Because behind the awning was a grove of lush green jujube trees, the thick shade offered some coolness. On the packed-earth grounds to the left and right of the awning stood three cart sets and four or five sedan chairs. At the hitching posts under the trees were a dozen or so mounts—donkeys, horses, mules—drinking from a large stone trough filled with water drawn from the well.

Quite a few travelers were resting under the awning. Since they wouldn't hit the road again until the afternoon sun had declined, some travelers who had banded together took turns napping—this close to the city, there wouldn't be bandits, but petty thieves weren't something officials bothered with. One had to look out for oneself. Losing money or provisions on the road here meant a dead end—one couldn't even beg successfully.

They couldn't risk heatstroke by traveling at midday; they had to wait until the sun shifted west and the heat eased before setting out. Under the scorching sun, heatstroke and sun-death weren't rare. Especially after the flood. The ground moisture steamed upward—the air was hot and humid, making it almost impossible to breathe. It was like being inside a giant steamer.

When the riders reached the awning, they dismounted to rest. Their movements were extremely coordinated—some went to water the horses while others claimed tables and ordered the waiter to prepare tea and provisions.

Though each wore a grass hat with eye-gauze, and coarse cloth traveling clothes, three of them had slender figures—obviously women.

"I didn't expect such a cool spot here," one of the women said.

Her voice was clear, like silver bells—obviously a young, charming woman. She patted the dust off her clothes, removed her grass hat, and took off her green eye-gauze and face-covering cloth. Her appearance, while not striking, was enough to set imaginations running. But the group's attire and weapons all proclaimed them true children of the *jianghu*, ready at any moment to draw swords and spill blood.

The tea shop attendant had already hurried over with a face full of smiles. This group was obviously not to be trifled with, so he served them with extra care.

These riders varied in height and build, some old, some young, male and female, but each was spirited with a fierce air. Even the three women had occasional cold glints flashing in their gazes. Several timid travelers simply turned away rather than look at them, to avoid bringing trouble upon themselves—these days, a dead person on the road was no different from a dead bug.

"It's cool here—but on the other side of the wall is a living hell," said a middle-aged man with a local accent. "The gruel station is south of the city. That's where all the starving people gather. Every day they carry out dozens of corpses to the cremation grounds."
