# Chapter 2784: The Capital (Part 136)

"Don't talk nonsense! Just go quietly." You Rong said, taking a small piece of silver wrapped in mulberry bark paper from the drawer and giving it to her.

Granny Shi weighed it in her hand. It was at least five taels. She was overjoyed, curtsied again, and said: "Many thanks, Miss! Leave the matter to this old body to arrange!"

Three days later, You Rong indeed came up with a way. She had several good sworn sisters in the Capital, mostly concubines in big households, who usually visited each other somewhat. One of them was now the favorite concubine (Red Auntie) of a Vice Minister of a certain Ministry in the Capital. Wang Yehao made wide connections in the Capital, so naturally, he wouldn't miss this route of relationship. usually, he also allowed You Rong to visit these sisters to connect feelings.

It happened that this sister gave birth to a son recently. Although he was born of a concubine and was of shu (concubine-born) status, the big household also had to have a celebration. You Rong routinely had to go to congratulate too.

Because her status was low, she was considered "not fit for the table" (unpresentable for formal occasions). But this had an advantage, which was that she was the sister's "private guest." She didn't need to go through the "official household" (formal family management), nor did she need to register in the guest book. Once entering the residence, she was a free body.

It was lonely and boring at home. Every time there was such an opportunity to go out, You Rong would leave early and return late, staying in someone else's residence for a whole day.

Although the incense burning on the first and fifteenth was temporarily stopped after Xu Yong came to rectify, "moving around" at a best friend's house was allowed by Master Wang. The servants couldn't say anything. Xu Yong was not there, and the Liu Qi'er couple wouldn't hinder things even more.

Immediately she agreed on the time with Granny Shi. On that day, she arrived at the best friend's residence, sent back the sedan chair first, only asking them to "come pick up at dusk." The accompanying servant woman stayed outside to wait. Entering the backyard, she first reminisced with the best friend, then asked her to "make it convenient." The best friend knew clearly about such matters and immediately said: "I'll just pretend you have already gone back; I know nothing else..."

Immediately she sent a personal old maidservant to verify quietly lead her to the back door of the residence and let her out. Out of the door, a small sedan chair carried by two people with green cloth cover was already waiting in the shabby alley. The servant boy beside the sedan chair was exactly the servant following Pan Cheng'an. You Rong felt relieved all over. Immediately she gave a wink and got into the sedan chair without saying a word.

The sedan chair was lifted, walking through streets and alleys all the way, out of Chongwen Gate, passing the Tax Division Yard (Choufen Chang). The area southwest of the Tax Division Yard was a depression in the Ming Dynasty, dotted with large and small "lakes" (Haizi). The scenery was pleasant, so temples stood in great numbers. Ganlu Nunnery was situated among them.

Ganlu Nunnery was not large, a small three-entrance courtyard. You Rong had been here many times. The abbess of this nunnery, Wu Yan (No Flame/Desire?), was not a real monk; of course, she couldn't be said to have an ordination certificate. She was originally a dismissed concubine of a powerful eunuch in the palace. The "Master" at home was of the Eunuch Party. After his downfall, the maids and concubines scattered, each seeking a way out.

This Wu Yan was originally from a Music Household in Jinling (Nanjing). She mixed in the eunuch's residence for a few years, had quite some savings, and also some connections. After leaving the residence, she was unwilling to return to her hometown just like that, so she took an old nun as her teacher, bought land in the Southern City to build a nunnery, and bought a few girls to act as little nuns, claiming to be "practicing Buddhism."

In reality, Wu Yan had no heart for practice. The reason she "left home" (became a nun) was merely to earn the convenience of freedom of movement. Because the surroundings were all serious temples, Wu Yan dared not openly hoist the banner of beauty and engage in the business of a "Flower Nunnery" (brothel disguised as a nunnery). Privately, she often did some illicit matchmaking business, opening the door of convenience for men and women of big households to have secret rendezvous.

But her technique was superb. Outsiders still thought that although the smell of red dust here was a bit strong, bent on clinging to and catering to the female relatives of wealthy and powerful families, it was still a clean place for practice. How could they know the tricks inside.

You Rong got off the sedan chair. A little nun had already welcomed her and led her to a courtyard on the east side. Entering the moon gate, there was a grape trellis. Freezing cold, only a few old stumps remained. In the courtyard, there were also two big vats, originally planted with lotus flowers, but only some residual leaves and broken stalks remained in winter. The three bright and two dark main rooms were not built largely but were quite exquisite. The beams and pillars didn't have the colorful paintings common locally, just natural color Canton lacquer.

This scene often reminded You Rong of the appearance of her hometown. Plus, Wu Yan was a person from Jinling; language and diet were similar. In this Capital where people and places were unfamiliar, naturally, a closeness was born. This was also the reason she was willing to come here to burn incense initially.

Under the steps, a woman had already come out to welcome her. She was about thirty years old, with beautiful appearance, dressed between half-monk and half-layman. Although wearing a monk robe, a head of black hair was covered with a hairnet, yet it couldn't hide her gentle and charming quality. When You Rong saw her initially, she knew she was a "fellow daoist" (of the same trade). Sure enough, when the two reminisced, they were actually half fellow townsmen.

Both originally thin horses, and both fallen in the Capital. Naturally, a feeling of mutual pity arose. This Wu Yan also treated her especially warmly.

Seeing her arrival, she immediately took her hand and whispered: "No obstacles coming out this time, right?"

"Used a Golden Cicada Sheds its Shell stratagem." You Rong smiled playfully.

Wu Yan smiled, immediately led her to offer incense in the hall of the main courtyard first, then invited her into the clean room for tea. This set of procedures was followed regardless of the purpose of the comer. This was also the retreating step left by Wu Yan.

"Has he come?" You Rong was eager to see Pan Cheng'an and asked.

"Came long ago," Wu Yan smiled and teased, "What are you anxious about?"

You Rong's face blushed and said: "I have important things to say..."

"It's not yet noon now, time is ample." Wu Yan said, "If you show anxiety, won't you be manipulated by him? Even if there is a sky-big matter, you have to let him hang for a while first."

"Sister speaks correctly." Being said so by Wu Yan, You Rong had to restrain her temper and drink tea and chat with her. Fortunately, she also had matters she wanted this sister to advise on, so she recounted the matter of Xu Yong coming to the residence to rectify.

"...This little brat seems to know something."

Wu Yan listened carefully but didn't open her mouth. Until she stopped, she asked: "What plan do you have?"

"I don't know either." You Rong revealed a bitter smile, "Guarding the four-sided sky of the home and enduring day by day, don't know if it counts as waiting in widowhood or watching for the husband!"

"If you ask me, you must make up your own mind properly." Wu Yan held a white copper hand warmer, "Do you want to stay in the Zhou family? If you can't endure it, better go beg Master Wang to let you go back South. Anyway, you have given birth to a son for the Zhou family."

"How can it be so easy!" You Rong said, "Back then the Wang family gave my family three hundred taels of silver. I have the silver; if I am willing to beg, probably this body price can be waived. It's just that my parents are not good people either. If I go back, before my buttocks sit warm, I will be sold by them again!"

Wu Yan's family situation was similar to hers. Hearing her say so, she felt a great sense of mutual pity and sighed, "Being human, don't be a female body; joy and sorrow of a hundred years depend on others! Since you still want to stay in the Zhou family, it is better to break off with Master Pan early. If the Wang family really caught some handle and handed you to the official matchmaker for sale, that would be truly falling into hell!"

Thinking of this terrible prospect, You Rong couldn't help shivering. She wasn't Newton's biological mother. Even if she were, if such a thing happened, she would still be sold by the master family.

Seeing fear on her face, Wu Yan struck while the iron was hot: "You must make up your mind early! This matter can only be hidden for a time, not for a lifetime! If caught by someone really, then it won't be up to you!"

"What break or not break." You Rong sighed long, "Now it is already the second month. Next month when the river ice melts, Master Pan will naturally go South. By then, it will be broken even if not broken."

Seeing that she still had reluctance to part, Wu Yan continued: "Master Pan leaves, there will be Master Li, Master Wang. Sister, I am a Xu Niang halfway old (middle-aged woman), but you are still at a flower-like age. Guarding inexplicably, having thoughts is most ordinary! Going on like this is not a solution."

These words touched You Rong's state of mind, and she pondered secretly. Wu Yan took the opportunity to say: "Ever since you came to me to offer incense, I felt that you and I sisters are very compatible. Speaking of which, we are considered half fellow townsmen. You have no reliance up or down now; you should also plan for the future..."

Hearing meaning in her words, You Rong asked: "Sister means..."

It turned out that although Wu Yan had this property, she was not content. She intended to make the incense fire more prosperous. Amass a big sum of money, buy dozens of mu of field as temple property, and also planned to build a garden, hire a few good hands for making vegetarian meals... making this place a resort for female relatives of big households to burn incense and tour on normal days.

The ambition was big, and there were ways; she could enter the inner halls of many big households in the Capital and speak up. But she dared not let go of her hands and feet to do things for the time being. Because a single log cannot make a forest, she had no helper. The few nuns in the nunnery were either old or young; those of suitable age were all poor women just to mix for a meal. Meeting strangers, they couldn't even speak fluently. They could only do some clumsy work.

Since You Rong came to burn incense, the two had compatible tastes and congenial temperaments. Unconsciously, it aroused her "lofty ambition" again. You Rong had a beautiful face, and had undergone a full set of "Thin Horse" training since childhood. Whether speech, response, etiquette... no faults could be picked out. If she was used to receive guests, wouldn't it be a huge help?

You Rong was not a local, wouldn't become too big to control (tail too big to wag), and could only rely on her. Moreover, she had at least several hundred taels of private savings and many jewelries. With her Wu Yan's wrist, naturally she could coax her to take them out for "investment" then.

"How about coming to my place?" Wu Yan whispered, "Isn't it freer than being a concubine in someone's house?"

"You mean... become a nun?!" You Rong was somewhat surprised, probably didn't expect she would propose such a suggestion.

"Whether to become a nun or not is entirely up to yourself. It doesn't matter much." Wu Yan said. Originally, becoming a nun meant one could practice with hair (without shaving)—anyway, she herself was like this. If unwilling to wear monk robes, one could also live long in the nunnery as a lay believer.

"...You are smart, capable, and can talk. Being a helper for me, isn't it better than living like a widow in the Zhou family inexplicably?" Wu Yan bewitched, "Living in this nunnery, you are not restrained by the master family. Except for having to cut off meat and fish inside the nunnery and not being able to wear full dress and magnificent clothes, you can make decisions for yourself in everything else. Moreover, if you come, you are the Guest Prefect (Zhike), naturally someone will serve you. Not tired, and don't need to look at people's faces. In free time, we sisters can also accompany each other to kill time."

These words moved You Rong's heart. Other things aside, the point of being able to "make decisions for oneself" was particularly attractive to her.
