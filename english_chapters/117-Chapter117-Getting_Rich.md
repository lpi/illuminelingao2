# Chapter 117: Getting Rich

"Astonishing." Xi Yazhou watched goods continuously carried from the compound—truly eye-opening. "How could he have so much?"

"Den-master." Wu De answered briefly. Though Hainan was on major overseas trade routes, it wasn't known for maritime trade—rather, pirates frequently visited. Pirates used this place as hunting ground, supply post, and loot-stash. Remote, poor, sparse population—government administrative capacity weak. The Gou family as pirate-dens and fence-operators naturally had this much. Their manor's armaments exceeded typical militia: six small wall-cannons, twenty-plus pack-guns, more bird-guns and muskets than their guards, five or six thousand *jin* of black powder in storage, plus quantities of arrows, blades, spears, iron-shot. Apparently they also stocked weapons and equipment for pirates.

"Normal people—excluding super-corrupt types like He Shen—who'd store over ten thousand pieces of porcelain at home?" Wu De pointed at porcelain being carried from storerooms. "These were probably robbed from merchant ships."

"No wonder this place is like Ali Baba's cave—everything's here." Xi Yazhou sighed. "Just these porcelains and hardwoods—how much RMB would that be?"

"Can't convert to RMB, but we've definitely struck it rich." Wu De's earlier discomfort had mostly faded. After this victory, transmigrators were truly established in Lingao—sufficient grain, salt-field controlled. Combat effectiveness verified. He'd known from the start: without eating big households, transmigrators couldn't successfully launch. Even landing in wild America, they'd have started by slaughtering Indians.

"Right—now we can give the salt village more relief. The people suffer terribly, making salt half-starved. Empty stomachs mean low labor productivity. But Wang Engineer designed new brine-concentration equipment—should improve things."

"Wang Engineer's truly versatile. Speaking of—with all that cloth, my production team can finally get new uniforms. Before, cloth seemed scarce—everything rationed. Now we can outfit them fully—underwear, outerwear, spare sets."

"Will your production-team workers return?"

"After this battle, they'll not only return—they'll probably bring more." Wu De's worries had completely vanished. He laughed heartily—truly liberating. Money breeds courage.

"Let's start a garment factory. Not just the production team—future new armies, plus our own spare clothes."

"Your village has women—mobilize them for side-work."

"Good idea—" Xi Yazhou was interrupted by a commotion. Zhang Xingjiao, wielding a stick, was viciously beating a pathetic old man. The man's silk robe was torn, covered in mud. Several transmigrators struggled to restrain this literary man—couldn't overpower him.

Xi Yazhou moved to stop it. Wu De shook his head: "Let it go. Zhang Xingjiao's entire family was ruined by the Gou family. This old man probably isn't good either."

"No wonder he insisted on coming." Xi Yazhou recalled—originally they hadn't planned to bring him. But hearing it was Gou Manor, he'd insisted—couldn't be stopped. He'd come for revenge.

This old man was a Gou family hanger-on—he'd suggested seizing the Zhang family gravesite for "feng shui" reasons. Whatever feng shui, it clearly hadn't favored the Gou family or him. The old man had taken countless blows—if Zhang Xingjiao weren't weak, his skull would've cracked long ago.

Eventually Zhang Xingjiao was subdued—alternately crying and laughing, somewhat crazed, circling the Gou compound. Wu De worried he might burn down the compound in fury—major disaster—and quickly sent two men to restrain him.

Xi Yazhou inspected the compound with Wu De—especially monitoring the inventory. So many goods here—chaos during inventory would be terrible.

Planning Committee's Dai Xie handled all inventory work—unknown if this suited his statistics-major expertise. He'd carried his beloved crossbow but hadn't fired a single arrow. Now fully staffed, he sat behind a laptop, constantly processing new data. Helpers around him were overwhelmed.

After preliminary warehouse and compound inspection, Dai Xie organized inventory teams: one for grain and cloth; one for silver and coins; one for valuables—jewelry, antiques, ornaments; one for various goods. Items were immediately logged and boxed. Boxes were Bopu wood-factory products made specifically for this "hunting"—designed for gold, silver, jewelry, and coins. Full of silver, each weighed about 100 *jin*—convenient for loading and transport. Very useful—scattered jewelry and coins could be lost easily. Centralized storage was safe and convenient for verification. Warehouse copper-coins, many loose, were directly boxed.

Porcelain, timber—bulky goods that couldn't be immediately transported—were only inventoried and numbered, then sealed in place, awaiting future transportation.

Detailed clearing reached household valuables. Compared to massive goods, gold and silver weren't that much: various-grade silver over 3,000 *liang*, gold over 100 *liang*, copper coins over 4,000 strings. Surprisingly: over 1,000 foreign silver coins of various types—mostly Manila-minted Spanish coins, some small gold coins. Jewelry and ornaments—countless.

Xi Yazhou knew commoners' consciousness wasn't that high. Villagers he'd brought only carried items—no pocketing allowed. Entry and exit monitored. With such a large property and so much to inventory, chaos guaranteed—gold, silver, and jewelry would disappear into private hands. Grain would be scattered carelessly. Fragile items smashed—sometimes pure destructive impulses. Especially salt-villagers full of hatred for the Gou family—wanted to kick everything in sight. Upon entering, some had tried to smash commoner homes—even breaking roadside water-jars. Without Xi Yazhou having Tan Chengqing stop them, many would've massacred Gou Manor on the spot.

"Any more of this—immediate beheading!" Xi Yazhou told Tan Chengqing bluntly. "Don't think I don't know your intentions. I'm telling you—no!"

"Everyone's been stifled. The Gou family harmed us for so many years—"

"You were harmed by the Gou family—not Gou Manor's common people!" Xi Yazhou scolded. "They're also honest folk, oppressed and exploited by the Gou family. Their days were even harder than yours. Yet you—didn't dare whisper when the Gou family was strong. Now they're finished, you want to be heroes against poor commoners!"

Tan Chengqing blushed deeply—promised to keep villagers disciplined. Xi Yazhou softened: "The village head and elders are rescued. Take good care of those elders—they've suffered much."

Amid the bustle, noon arrived. Debris and corpses were mostly cleared. Reports came in. Total transmigrator casualties: 19 wounded. Except for the fall-victim, others weren't serious. The compound's 200-some men, women, children—nearly half dead. Many women had committed suicide. Twenty-to-thirty had jumped walls to escape, but most fell to snipers along the route. Only three or four escaped. Besides these, 200-plus militia were virtually all killed or captured.

Most critically—the Gou brothers weren't found. A servant revealed: after Gou Xunli was ambushed on the road, he'd arrived at the manor for a brief overnight discussion, then left at dawn next day. But Gou Xunyi's whereabouts were unknown. Corpses were individually identified—none was him. However, his wives, concubines, and children were mostly found—dead or captured. Various Gou kinsmen and hangers-on were also captured. How to handle them—Wu De hadn't decided. That was for the Committee.

Though the two main family heads weren't captured, Wu De and Xi Yazhou weren't worried. When powerful and wealthy, they'd crumbled at one blow. Now homeless dogs—nothing to fear.

Order restored, Wu De had Zhang Xingjiao summon village leaders to announce: everyone go home and prepare for a meeting at the Gou compound gate. First: pacification. Second: search for hidden enemies or concealed assets.

Simply put: they were preparing a "struggle session"—the Party's historically proven mass-mobilization technique. With Zhang Xingjiao as a native, everyone's background was known. He'd compiled a list: who were Gou lackeys, who had conflicts with Gou the Elder/Second, who was a blacksmith, who was a carpenter... all clearly noted. Of course, his personal grudges featured. Someone who'd once cursed him as a "starve-to-death pedant" was now listed as "Gou family lackey."
