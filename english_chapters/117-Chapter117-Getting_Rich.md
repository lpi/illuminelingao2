# Chapter 117 - Getting Rich

"Too amazing." Xi Yazhou looked at the items constantly being moved out of the residence, truly an eye-opener, "How could he have so many things?"

"Harboring stolen goods." Wu De answered his question briefly. Although Hainan is located on the main route of China's ocean trade, it has never been known for ocean trade. Instead, it is a place frequently visited by pirates, who use it as a hunting ground, supply base, and place to hide stolen goods. Because the land is remote and people are poor, the population is sparse, and the administrative capacity of the government is weak. As a harbor master and stolen goods handler for pirates, it is normal for the Gou family to have so many things. Just look at the armaments in his stockade, which exceed ordinary village braves. There are six small cannons on the stockade wall, more than twenty wall guns, and the number of various fowling pieces and blunderbusses is simply more than the village braves and family guards. There are five or six thousand jin of black powder in the warehouse, as well as a large amount of feathered arrows, swords, spears, and iron pellets—it seems he also has a business of purchasing and storing weapons and equipment for pirates.

"For a normal family, except for super corrupt officials like Heshen, who would store tens of thousands of pieces of porcelain at home." Wu De pointed to the porcelain being moved out of the warehouse for cleaning, "These should all be robbed from maritime merchants' ships."

"No wonder his place is like Ali Baba's cave, having everything." Xi Yazhou lamented, "Just these porcelains and hardwoods, how much RMB would they be worth?"

"Even if not exchanged for RMB, we made a fortune this time." Wu De's unhappy mood had faded a lot. After this victory, the transmigrators could be considered to have firmly established themselves in Lingao, with enough grain and control of the salt field. Everyone's combat effectiveness was also verified. He was clear from the beginning that without "eating a big household" (expropriating the rich), the transmigrators couldn't start smoothly. Even if they landed on the wild American continent, they would have to start by massacring Indians.

"Correct. Now we can give more relief to Salt Field Village. The common people are suffering, drying salt while half-starved. Without a full stomach, labor productivity won't go up. However, Engineer Wang designed a new brine concentration equipment, which should improve it a lot."

"Engineer Wang is really a multi-talented person. Speaking of which, with so much cloth, my production team can also change outfits completely. Originally, I always felt there wasn't enough cloth and used it sparingly. Now I can help them prepare both underwear and outerwear, and even have two extra sets for replacement."

"Will your production team members come back?"

"After fighting this battle, not only will they all come back, but maybe they will also bring many people." Wu De's worry and unhappiness were swept away. He laughed loudly, simply heartily. It seemed that having money makes one bold.

"Let's set up a garment factory. Not just the production team, there will be a new army in the future, and our own clothes also need replacement."

"Aren't there women in your village? You can mobilize them to engage in sideline production."

"That's a good idea—" Just as Xi Yazhou finished speaking, he suddenly heard a commotion nearby. He saw Zhang Xingjiao dragging a stick, chasing and beating a wretched old man. The silk shirt on the old man was torn, and he was covered in mud, looking extremely miserable. Several transmigrators pulled desperately but couldn't hold down this frail scholar.

Xi Yazhou was about to go over to stop it, but Wu De shook his head: "Forget it. Zhang Xingjiao's family property was destroyed in the hands of the Gou family. This old man is probably not a good person either."

"No wonder he insisted on coming today." Xi Yazhou thought he originally didn't plan to ask him to come, but upon hearing about going to Gou Family Stockade, this person insisted on coming and couldn't be stopped—it turned out he came for revenge.

This old man was a Qingke (man of letters living as a parasite in a rich man's house) of the Gou family. The idea of occupying the Zhang family's grave land came from him, for some "Feng Shui" reason. Anyway, this "Feng Shui" was obviously seriously disadvantageous to the Gou family and also disadvantageous to him. The old man received countless blows. If Zhang Xingjiao weren't weak and lacking strength, his head would have been broken long ago.

After a while of trouble, Zhang Xingjiao was finally suppressed. He cried and laughed, seeming a bit crazy, running around the Gou family residence. Wu De worried that in his anger, he might set fire to the Gou family residence, which would be a big disaster, so he hurriedly asked two people to follow and detain him back.

Xi Yazhou went to the Gou family residence to take a look again, patrolling everywhere with Wu De, especially checking the situation of confiscation. This stockade was so rich in materials that chaos during confiscation would be disastrous.

Dai Xie, sent by the Planning Committee, was responsible for all confiscation work. Unknown if this counted as the specialty of someone with a background in statistics, he carried a beloved crossbow on his back but didn't even get a chance to shoot an arrow today. With sufficient manpower now, he sat behind a notebook, constantly processing newly added data. There were also some helpers around, all extremely busy.

After a preliminary inspection of the warehouses and the residence, Dai Xie divided the confiscation personnel into various groups: one group specialized in confiscating grain and cloth, one group specialized in silver and money, one group specialized in various valuables including jewelry, antiques, and ornaments, and one group specialized in various goods. After items were taken out, they were immediately registered and packed. These boxes were manufactured by the Bopu Wood Factory for this "hunting," specifically used to hold gold, silver, soft goods, jewelry, and copper coins. After being filled with silver, including the box, it generally weighed about a hundred jin, convenient for loading, unloading, and pack transport. This item was indeed useful. Large amounts of jewelry and similar things were easily scattered. Placing them centrally like this was reliable and safe, and inspection was also convenient. Many copper coins in the warehouse were also loose, so packing them directly was more convenient.

For bulky goods like porcelain and timber that couldn't be shipped immediately, only the numbers and names were confiscated without leaving the warehouse. Seals were directly pasted, waiting for transportation tools to move them later.

The clearing work gradually entered the soft goods inside the residence. Compared to the huge quantity of goods, gold and silver money was not too much, only yielding more than three thousand taels of silver of various purity and more than a hundred taels of gold. There were more than four thousand strings (guan) of copper coins from various eras. Somewhat unexpectedly, thousands of silver coins of different styles from various countries were also seized, mostly Spanish silver dollars minted in Manila, and some small gold coins. Countless gold and silver jewelry were also seized.

Xi Yazhou knew deeply that the awareness of the common people was not that high, so the villagers brought along were only responsible for moving items and were not allowed to take anything privately. Entering and leaving the residence were supervised by personnel. This place was large, and there were many things to confiscate. Just counting the porcelain in one warehouse was enough to keep people busy for a while. With many things to do, many gold, silver, jewelry, and various valuable things would fall into private hands. Grain would be scattered at will. Fragile and breakable things would also be smashed a lot—sometimes people just purely vented their desire for destruction, especially these Salt Field Village villagers full of hatred for the Gou family. Everything looked displeasing to them, and they wanted to kick everything they saw. When they just entered the village, some people attempted to smash and loot the dwellings in the stockade, even smashing several water vats outside the houses. If Xi Yazhou hadn't asked Tan Chengqing to lead people to stop them, many would have blood-washed Gou Family Stockade on the spot.

"If such things happen again, behead immediately!" Xi Yazhou said unceremoniously to Tan Chengqing, "Don't think I don't know what thoughts you harbor. I tell you, forbidden!"

"Everyone is stifled. The Gou family harmed us for so many years—"

"You were harmed by the Gou family, not the common people of Gou Family Stockade!" Xi Yazhou reprimanded, "They are also honest people, oppressed and driven by the Gou family, living even harder lives than you. You guys are good; when the Gou family was strong, you didn't dare to fart. Now that the Gou family is finished, you want to play hero on poor people!"

Tan Chengqing blushed deeply and hurriedly promised to restrain the villagers well. Xi Yazhou's face then softened, "The village head and several elders of the village have been rescued. Take good care of the elderly first—they all suffered a lot."

Amidst the busyness, it was already noon in a blink of an eye. Rubble and corpses were almost cleared up. Reports from various places also came out. The total casualties of the transmigrators were nineteen injured. Except for the one who fell, others were not serious. Nearly half of the more than two hundred men, women, old, and young gathered in the residence died. Many women committed suicide. No less than twenty or thirty people jumped over the stockade wall to escape, but the vast majority fell to the snipers along the way; only three or four escaped. Besides, the more than two hundred village braves and family guards were basically not spared; most were killed, and a small number were captured alive.

However, the most crucial two brothers of the Gou family were not found. A servant confessed that after Gou Xunli was attacked on the road that day, he hurriedly talked with the stockade master for a night at the stockade and left early the next morning. But no one knew where Gou Xunyi was. Corpses were identified one by one, and none was him. However, the whereabouts of his wives, concubines, and children were mostly found; some were killed or committed suicide, and some were captured. In addition, many of the Gou family's clansmen and Qingke were caught. As for how to deal with them, Wu De hadn't thought it through. This might have to be decided by the Executive Committee.

Although the two main family heads were not caught, Wu De and Xi Yazhou didn't take it to heart—they were vulnerable even when they had great wealth and power, let alone now being stray dogs.

Once order was stabilized, Wu De asked Zhang Xingjiao to come forward and call out several main figures in the village to go separately and beat gongs to notify every household to gather in front of the Gou family residence for a meeting. The meeting was firstly to pacify the people, and secondly to check if there were any fish that slipped through the net and other clues to hidden property.

To put it bluntly, this was preparing to hold a struggle session. It was a wonderful method repeatedly tested in the history of our party to mobilize the masses for revolution. Because the transmigrators had Zhang Xingjiao, a native of this village, they knew the details of every family very well. He listed who were the Gou family's lackeys, who were at odds with Gou the Elder and Gou the Second, who was a blacksmith, who was a carpenter... and so on, all listed clearly. Of course, his personal grudges were unavoidable. For example, a certain person who once scolded him as a "sour scholar who deserves to starve" became a lackey of the Gou family on the list.
