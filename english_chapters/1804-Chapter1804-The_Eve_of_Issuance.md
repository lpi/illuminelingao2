# Chapter 1804 - The Eve of Issuance

The letter was addressed to Young Master Liang, his patron. The Liang family had always been his backer and a major client. From the moment word of the currency reform had leaked out, Young Master Liang had taken great interest, instructing him to monitor the Australians' every move.

In the letter, he wrote in detail about the meeting's proceedings and everyone's reactions, particularly noting how Gao Ju had tirelessly promoted and championed the Australians' cause. It appeared the Australians were absolutely determined to push through this currency reform. At the meeting, preliminary agreement had been reached: the various trade guilds would allocate quotas for exchanging new currency, apportioned by scale and capital strength. The currency guild had been assigned the largest quota—two hundred thousand silver dollars in exchange. The guild believed this figure was acceptable—after all, the exchange terms the Australians had offered were fair, accounting for both weight and purity. Silver for silver dollars—it couldn't really be called a loss.

Yet Liang Chenlong also wrote his concerns into the letter. He worried that silver-for-silver-dollar exchange was merely the first step; the next would be forcing them to accept a certain amount of silver dollar circulation vouchers.

Having written this far, he heaved a deep sigh, thinking of the next step that would surely involve converting collected copper cash into fractional vouchers—this was virtually certain. Copper cash might not be worth much, but it was still money. Exchanging it for slips of paper genuinely pained him.

Having finished the letter, he sealed it, pressed on his secret seal, and called a trusted servant, whispering a few instructions.

As usual, the letter wouldn't be sent to the Liang residence directly. It would go to the Fangchun Pleasure Quarter, to Miss Yuewan there. Yuewan had been "combed" by Liang Cunhou—she was essentially his kept woman in the pleasure district. Many matters unsuitable for open channels were handled through her.

The servant acknowledged his orders and departed. Liang Chenlong watched his retreating figure and couldn't help but exhale.

Liu Xiang sat at his desk, looking at the latest population statistics. According to the first household registration census conducted after the Guangzhou police system had been established, he now knew the exact population of Guangzhou Special Municipality for the first time.

Based on the old Ming administrative boundaries of the two attached counties of Nanhai and Panyu, plus the suburban areas planned for incorporation—including Henan Island and other locations—the registered population totaled 283,700 persons. This included all permanent residents with fixed dwellings in Guangzhou. It did not include "vagrant populations" like those gathered at the Guan Di Temple—this group numbered at least ten thousand more.

The new household registration made no distinction between agricultural and non-agricultural populations, because in the 17th century the line between these two categories wasn't particularly clear. Besides shop assistants, clerks, and artisans who returned to the countryside to help during busy farming seasons, and rural farmers who came to the city for short-term work, Guangzhou also housed a fair number of bona fide farmers who cultivated land within the city walls. Therefore, only broad occupational categories were registered—after all, in this era, one's occupation was essentially lifelong.

The registered population did not include the Tanka boat-dwellers. The data received from the River-and-Lake Patrol Office was ancient, dating back to Zhang Juzheng's era. According to this obsolete information, 22,000 Tanka were registered with the Patrol Office. But the veteran clerks retained from the office said the actual Tanka numbers far exceeded this figure. Because they had no fixed abode and drifted constantly, precise counts were impossible. However, Tanka regularly active in the waters of the West River and Pearl River outside Guangzhou city numbered no fewer than 40,000.

To truly determine how many Tanka there were, they would have to be settled on shore. In 1950, the first major civil works project undertaken by the Guangzhou municipal government was constructing Tanka housing and resettling them on land—thereby gaining control, for the first time, over this group that had always existed outside mainstream society.

Controlling the Tanka and bringing them ashore as registered subjects would yield tremendous benefits for security along the entire Pearl River system, even for Guangzhou itself. Since ancient times, rivers, lakes, and waterways had been natural refuges for outlaws.

But Liu Xiang's current Guangzhou Special Municipal Government lacked the capacity for such an undertaking. He had no choice but to temporarily abandon ambitions to control the Tanka and focus his main efforts on the new currency issuance.

The key to the new currency's credibility was ensuring its purchasing power. Liu Xiang knew perfectly well that once currency issuance began, banknote printing would rush out like floodwater bursting through a dam.

First was Guangzhou's own monetary circulation demand. How large this figure actually was, no one knew—the Great Ming had no statistics bureau, nor modern banks. How much silver and copper cash actually circulated in the market was anyone's guess. The Finance Ministry could only roughly estimate that approximately one million yuan in circulation vouchers would be needed. Fearing this insufficient, the Finance Ministry had already ordered the Hong Kong Mint to print several million more yuan in notes. Second was Guangzhou Municipal Government expenditures. These had ballooned a hundredfold compared to the old Guangzhou Prefecture administration. Establishing and operating numerous new agencies, rapidly expanding public employees, absorbing former officials, providing disaster relief, municipal works... plus ever-increasing military expenses—all dramatically increased the quantity of new currency that needed to be released into the market. After Liu Xiang and the Finance Ministry special team made rough estimates, they already harbored concerns about inflation of the new currency.

Liu Xiang picked up another secret report: the latest Guangzhou grain inventory statistics. After abolishing the brokers and establishing two wholesale markets for bulk commodities—with mandatory regulations that all large-scale grain transactions take place within these markets—long-distance grain traders, farmers and landlords selling bulk grain, and local wholesale and retail grain merchants all had to conduct business within market premises. Council of Elders state enterprises, cooperatives, and the Dachang Rice Company had also set up trading offices within the market, serving as windows for operating and intervening in the grain trade.

Simultaneously, through the General Chamber of Industry and Commerce and the trade guilds, inventory statistics were compiled for the city's wholesale and retail grain merchants large and small. With this, the municipal government finally had a rough picture of Guangzhou's bulk grain reserves. Total rough rice inventory held by transport traders, local wholesalers, and retailers amounted to approximately 2,600 tons—enough to supply the entire Guangzhou market for about one month.

At 2,600 tons, based on the municipal government's earlier population estimates, this wouldn't even last a month. However, Lin Baiguang believed the previous estimates were unscientific. Though the total population estimate roughly matched the census, the figure of 14 kilograms of grain consumption per person per month was too high. First, the elderly and children couldn't eat that much. Second, urban residents could barely manage on 11 kilograms per month. The city's impoverished population—accounting for over half the total—ordinarily consumed nowhere near 11 kilograms monthly. Moreover, wealthy Guangzhou households typically maintained substantial grain stores—this was customary. Major households often stockpiled enough grain to feed their entire establishment for two or three months. They could also obtain grain from tenant farmers in the nearby suburbs. Grain supply wasn't a problem. Since household registration of the gentry and wealthy included large numbers of servants, with anywhere from twenty or thirty to several hundred people per household, this considerably relieved supply pressure.

Additionally, the old granaries left by Guangzhou Prefecture's one-prefecture-two-county administration, plus grain from confiscated "traitor properties," added up to seven or eight hundred tons. A portion had already been allocated as salary and expenses for municipal government personnel. Roughly 200 tons remained.

Beyond local grain, the Guangzhou Grand World warehouse and warehouses on Hong Kong Island stored rough rice shipped in from Southeast Asia and Hainan over the past three months—10,000 tons. This was Liu Xiang and the Finance Ministry's trump card, held in reserve to counter grain speculation.

Every major currency reform was almost invariably accompanied by frenzied speculation in grain and other necessities. Especially given Guangzhou's circumstances, even Liu Xiang—who had never worked as a merchant—recognized this as a prime opportunity for grain speculation.

Guangdong's grain supply depended on Guangxi. The sixth and seventh months saw the early rice harvest in both Guangdong and Guangxi. Ordinarily, grain prices should decline at this time. But Guangdong itself was grain-deficient, and Guangxi remained under Ming control—Wuzhou had established a river checkpoint, strictly prohibiting all boat traffic upstream or downstream. The grain trade through Wuzhou had halted. Under normal circumstances, the mere news of Wuzhou's grain shipments stopping would be sufficient to trigger a grain price surge.

Fortunately, in the course of abolishing brokers and clearing broker debts, the Council of Elders had received reciprocation from the Chaoshan grain merchants. Though the Chaoshan merchants' wholesale grain prices on the market had risen slightly, they remained stable. The Chaoshan merchants had also leveraged their trade network to transport grain from other parts of Guangdong to supply Guangzhou, greatly easing supply pressure. This allowed Chen Ce, who held full authority over economic and monetary policy in Guangzhou, to avoid large-scale use of reserves, instead occasionally using cooperatives to release small quantities of grain to keep price increases in check.

However, relying solely on the Chaoshan merchants' "reciprocation" was insufficient. Merchant morality was profit-oriented. Their current sacrifice of profits was partly gratitude and reciprocation, and partly because they understood the Council of Elders' capacity for violence far exceeded the Ming's. But once profit margins grew large enough, neither conscience nor fear would restrain them. Therefore, containment of speculation and currency stability had to rest on the Council of Elders' own strength.

In addition to stockpiling large quantities of grain on Hong Kong Island, the Planning Office was simultaneously transferring salt, cotton and hemp textiles, cured and dried seafood, and tea from various regions to Hong Kong Island, ready for deployment to Guangzhou to stabilize prices.

To ensure sufficient distribution channels, beyond wholesale channels, the retail arms—Commercial Cooperatives, Dachang, and Wanyou—had opened over forty branch stores throughout Greater Guangzhou through acquisitions, transfers, and direct purchases. Their retail network now basically covered the entire Guangzhou urban area and major suburban market towns. To guarantee supply to rural towns, twenty mobile sales boats had been converted, fully staffed with clerks and stocked with goods, conducting mobile retail operations in villages and towns that had been largely pacified. Zheng Shangjie had instructed the sales boats to also purchase local rural products according to market conditions, further stimulating the rural economy and preparing the ground for currency circulation in the countryside.
