# Chapter 1532 - Night Talk at Bairenfort

In the other half of the dormitory room, crammed in surprisingly, stood an antique-style, exquisitely crafted grand piano.

"You have a piano?" Okamoto was somewhat surprised—he didn't recall any Yuanlao bringing a piano personally. Some had brought small instruments like accordions.

But he quickly realized it was a product of this timeline: a harpsichord.

"I bought this privately from Macau," Dongfang said. "Without a real piano, this will have to do."

The two sat down in silence and poured wine. They faced each other, seemingly unsure where to begin.

"Mm, thank you for the expense," Dongfang suddenly spoke. "Since there's wine, I needn't ask about tea or coffee. Bach, Mozart, or Brahms? Or perhaps you prefer Tchaikovsky?"

"Huh? What?" Okamoto was beginning to find he couldn't keep up with this person's rhythm at all.

"Mm? Just asking what you'd like to hear. Can't eat dinner without music, can you?"

"I see... Whatever you like. Bach, then." Okamoto's astonishment was giving way to the feeling he had found the right person.

"Fine. Goldberg Variations all right? Gould or Tureck?"

Okamoto was already getting used to this style of conversation. "The High Priestess. Let's eat and listen slowly."

Dongfang Ke opened the cabinet and started looking for CDs, then connected the player to the speakers. Okamoto glimpsed the densely packed alphabetical index cards inside the cabinet.

Clear, refined piano notes floated from the speakers. Okamoto picked up his chopsticks and said, "Your private collection... must be one of a kind in the Yuan Elder Court, right?"

"Actually no. The Executive Office and Planning Commission have more professional entertainment equipment. But among private collections, nothing beats my cabinet. Before the transmigration, I really couldn't bear to leave my three-star marked records behind, so I brought them. The speakers were hand-assembled by someone I found." In the quiet room, Dongfang Ke's tone seemed somewhat more normal.

"Mm, what a treat. But you can only listen to these yourself—can't let the naturalized citizens see them. Bach isn't even a liquid yet at this point in time!"

"Ha, true. Even if released, no one would understand. The Yuan Elder Court's external propaganda is simple and crude. The Army and Navy folks just copy some old military music and that's enough. I've even written lyrics for them."

"Speaking of which, I've done that too! If I hadn't reworked the lyrics for the Navy's *Warship March*, it would've been unsingable."

The atmosphere, catalyzed by dinner and music together, became much more natural. The two chatted about many topics in music appreciation.

Then, emboldened by wine, Okamoto asked the question that had been puzzling him: "Why are you still living in such a small dorm? And where's your maidservant?"

"Ah, because it's close to the office building—no worrying about oversleeping and being late. Also, living alone, the bigger the place, the more trouble—cleaning and all that." Dongfang Ke replied nonchalantly.

"What? Alone? You mean you didn't buy a maidservant either? As far as I know, among single male Yuanlao, the only ones who didn't buy maidservants are that Ji Xin who protects natives and that... that... Cui something..." Okamoto was suddenly so startled he stumbled over his words.

"Alright... don't doubt my direction... I'm straight, not a two-way plug either..." Dongfang shook his head helplessly. "As for the maidservant, I just randomly drew Class B. I took her since it's a subsidy anyway, but I really don't like having someone around to bother me, so I sent her to the Yuanlao villa district to look after the house for me."

*This guy's tone when talking about maidservants is completely different from typical transmigrator otaku*, Okamoto thought. *Could there really be someone who didn't transmigrate for endless girls?*

"Then why did you transmigrate? Not for power, not for women—in a few years your speakers might break and you won't even be able to listen to lossless audio."

"Oh, the transmigration... just boredom. If not for girls, there's other stuff. The 17th century is way freer than where we came from, haha. Besides, the 21st century had nothing worth staying for." A strange smile, one never seen before, appeared on Dongfang's face. Okamoto decided not to continue this topic and got straight to the point.

"So, about the opera troupe—any good suggestions? The preparations are still quite difficult. Not enough people!"

"Before we enter this discussion, I have a question."

"What's your position?"

"I'm the newly appointed Director of the Arts Groups Management Office—and concurrently General Director of the Central Arts Troupe."

"So what you're discussing with me is an approved project."

"Of course. Without approval, it's just armchair strategizing." Okamoto enthusiastically laid out his plans—opera, ballet, symphony orchestra, and so on, wishing he could replicate every arts organization from the old timeline... before Dongfang Ke promptly cut him off:

"Mm, none of that has any meaning. What we lack most now is teachers—especially professional teachers. In the 1950s, China was impoverished, but at least it had the Soviets as mentors, plus a few returnees who had studied abroad. Now we ourselves represent the most advanced productive forces and social culture—there's nowhere to import from..."

"Indeed. I've reviewed the resources myself. Whether teachers or equipment, we're starting from scratch."

"Probably don't even have a modern piano, right?"

"Actually, we do have a piano: the recreation room on the *Fengcheng* had an old Nie'er brand. Looks like it's been sitting for at least thirty or forty years. But repairing it would require a tuner." Okamoto looked troubled. "I certainly don't have that skill."

"The piano isn't critical. Because harpsichords and clavichords already exist at this time. The latter is very similar to modern pianos. I believe tuners can be found in Europe. If we're willing to invest more, getting a few technicians to replicate modern pianos based on samples shouldn't be too difficult."

"The Planning Commission previously asked Kuake in Europe to procure instruments and recruit musicians and craftsmen. Instrumental music should be fine."

"Mm. For arts troupes, even Europe at this time has no systematic *bel canto* training. I think you'll need to build relationships with Dean Wu and seek help from the Church—get a couple of choir members. Italian vocal music has also just started, at least slightly better off than us. And there's Mrs. Liu, currently teaching music and dance at Fangtso Di and the Maidservant School—we could ask the Executive Committee to lend her to us. By the way, I wonder if that Italian Lando has any of his nation's innate talent points? As for me, I can't do *bel canto* at all, but I can help with piano and notation. As for rewriting lyrics and plagiarizing—that's routine. Just commission me whenever needed."

"Wonderful! The deputy artistic director position of the future Central Arts Troupe is yours. But composition and original work still can't be solved! I only studied voice, after all."

"No big deal. Besides records, I have lots of electronic archives here—several hundred gigabytes. Basically all classical and modern operas, even the revolutionary model operas, though those are folk art. The Grand Library database resources are probably measured in terabytes—surely there are score archives. We can simplify the arrangements. After all, in this timeline, the Yuan Elder Court is the source of all creativity!"

Dongfang Ke sipped his rum as he spoke. "But a symphony orchestra still isn't feasible for now. High-quality instruments can't all be purchased externally—besides violins, most Western instruments haven't appeared yet at this time. To produce them domestically, we'll need to experiment for a while. There are no suitable craftsmen domestically, so we'd have to bring them all the way from Europe. Also, we don't have a conductor."

"Mm, what I really want most is opera. I was originally worried about composition and orchestration, but seeing your private collection today, I finally have confidence! Come! A toast!" Okamoto excitedly raised his glass and drained it.

Dongfang Ke got up and changed the record—the *Brindisi* from the opera *La Traviata*. Pavarotti and Sutherland's soaring voices floated through this otherworldly night.

Years later, the published *History of the Arts, Volume One (Part One): The Founding of the Central Arts Troupe* recorded the "Night Talk at Bairenfort" between the Troupe's founder, the renowned conductor and playwright Yuanlao Okamoto, and amateur musician Yuanlao Dongfang Ke. Of course, the book's account had the two Yuanlao envisioning the organizational structure of the opera troupe and symphony orchestra by gaslight in the simple Bairenfort dormitory, with Yuanlao Dongfang even playing some conceptual pieces on a primitive early piano, while Yuanlao Okamoto brought out scripts he had accumulated over years to discuss vocal arrangement—fully demonstrating the first generation of Yuanlao's arduous pioneering efforts during the Empire's founding, laying a solid foundation for the great and glorious achievements that followed.

Shortly after this conversation, Dongfang Ke was formally transferred out of the Finance Directorate and became the Deputy Artistic Director of the Central Experimental Arts Troupe. Though he had changed positions, Cheng Dong still frequently assigned him stacks of account books. Yuanlao Dongfang, as cool as ever, silently accepted and continued doing work for the Finance sector. When Okamoto asked why he still took on this work, Yuanlao Dongfang, as cool as ever, replied: "Because the arts troupe has nothing to do." Okamoto nearly choked.

Though the Central Experimental Arts Troupe was now an approved project, few were enthusiastic about it. While Yuanlao Dongfang continued to immerse himself in HI-FI and account books, Okamoto ran around everywhere securing resources. Fortunately, the Executive Office was considering how to transition the Maidservant Training Class, and Xiao Zishan saw the arts troupe as a good place to absorb the Maidservant Academy graduates, providing ample support. Only then did the arts troupe open its doors quickly, settle into the county seat, and gather various resources.

Okamoto and Dongfang naturally contributed all their personal assets. The Planning Commission also allocated all stored odds and ends related to performance to the arts troupe. Pre-transmigration preparations had not prioritized the arts much—apart from purchasing bugles, fifes, and military drums for army needs, other instruments had not been on the procurement list at all. Fortunately, quite a few Yuanlao could play instruments and had personally brought some along.
