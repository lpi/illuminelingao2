# Chapter 737 - Sky-High Price

The peacemakers in the city finally reached a consensus after some bargaining. Once decided, Gao Ju ordered Manager Yan to be summoned.

This Manager Yan, nicknamed "Yan Little-Hat" because he always wore a Six-Direction Unity Cap, also bore a nickname reflecting how others viewed his conduct—naturally not in a positive light.

Yan Little-Hat was one of Gao Ju's confidants. Previously tasked with gathering intelligence on Wen Desi and his group, often using various excuses to get close to them, he was considered an old acquaintance of the Australians, familiar with their situation and quite clever. If Shopkeeper Wen and the others had been in the fleet back then, Yan Little-Hat himself would be the best proof.

Furthermore, Yan Little-Hat had long been removed from the household register; theoretically, he was no longer a servant of the Gao family. If anything went wrong, clearing the connection would be relatively simple.

He rewarded Yan Little-Hat with ten taels of silver, ordering him to be lowered down the city wall after dark to go to the Australian camp.

Yan Little-Hat was somewhat fearful. Crossing a war zone into an enemy camp was something he'd only seen in books. Going rashly like this might get his head chopped off directly.

"No need to worry. The Bandits are Australians, subordinates of Shopkeeper Wen. They all know you. Why would they harm you?"

"It's Master Wen?" Yan Little-Hat was surprised. "They have such powerful firearms?" News of the Bandits conquering everything along the Pearl River had spread throughout Guangzhou.

"Those who can create Australian wonders, can they not build a few cannons?" Gao Ju snorted. "Go boldly; I won't treat you unfairly. When you see them, say this..."

He explained the details for the next contact meeting.

"If they are unwilling, bring back their message. Tell me everything exactly. No written paper allowed, understand?"

"Yes, Master!" Yan Little-Hat said. "But Master, what if Shopkeeper Wen isn't in the army—I heard he's actually some Australian Prime Minister—how do I prove myself?"

"Rest assured, the Australians are probably waiting eagerly for you right now," Gao Ju said confidently. "They will ask you many things; just answer truthfully—don't lie, don't fabricate. Say what you know, say you don't know if you don't. They will naturally believe you."

"Yes, the lowly one understands." Yan Little-Hat felt Master Gao's confidence was unreliable, but he agreed—he was half a desperado, knowing successful completion meant huge benefits for his future, far beyond tens of taels.

Near the third watch, supervised personally by a guerrilla general of the Governor's Green Standard Army guarding the south city, several soldiers lowered Yan Little-Hat down the wall. Outside was pitch black, but the opposite bank of the Pearl River on Henan Island was brightly lit—the Australian camp. Led by a guide waiting below, Yan Little-Hat stumbled to the riverbank, where a fishing boat was prepared.

Shortly after the fishing boat rowed out, passing mid-river, it was intercepted by a patrolling Small Fa boat. Two Australian sailors holding machetes and carrying short rifles leaped over. They were short and capable, wearing identical blue-and-white short jackets and round wide-brimmed straw hats—strange but neat attire. The fishermen kowtowed in fear, motionless. Yan Little-Hat emboldened himself to state his purpose.

"Board our boat. We'll take you." The leading Australian sailor said, allowing him to transfer. "Bringing anything?"

Yan Xiaomao quickly pulled out a tael of silver: "For the vice-lords to buy a bowl of wine."

"Keep the silver; we don't use it." The leader waved his hand expressionlessly. "You, sit there! Don't move." He pointed to a row of seats at the stern.

"Yes, yes." Yan Little-Hat sat quickly on the fixed wooden bench. Not accepting silver—truly rare. The Australians must be rich, feeding soldiers with silver. A glass lamp hung at the stern, illuminating everything brightly. The boat looked small, seating at most a dozen people. It felt made of wood. In the center was a black object topped with an iron chimney like a stove—a wave of heat confirmed his guess.

"Set sail!" The sailor called, sitting opposite Yan Little-Hat. The chimney suddenly spewed thick smoke mixed with sparks. Yan Little-Hat felt his body lurch forward, then jerk back as the small boat emitted a *putt-putt* sound and moved forward.

Rumors of Bandits having fire-driven boats without sails or oars had long circulated in Guangzhou. Yan Little-Hat hadn't expected to be the first to enjoy a "fire-wheel boat" ride. Amidst anxiety lay curiosity; ignoring the night, he looked around. The sailors seemed accustomed to his curiosity and didn't stop him.

Yan Little-Hat was taken to the headquarters area at a restaurant, subjected to a full body search, stripped of all objects, and brought before Wen Desi.

Yan Little-Hat recognized Wen Desi immediately. He knelt and kowtowed respectfully, fearing doubt would cost him his mission and life.

Wen Desi remembered him, though not his name. Yan Little-Hat reported clearly. Asked about Gao Ju's age, business, wife, and staff, Yan answered without error. Someone brought Gao Ju's comprehensive dossier from the Intelligence Bureau, finding Yan Little-Hat's file and photo to confirm his identity as Gao Ju's manager. He was then taken to another tent under guard, where specialized personnel discussed details with him—Yan Little-Hat's rank was low; his visit was merely to arrange negotiation preparations, not requiring Wen Desi's personal attention.

Yan Little-Hat presented Gao Ju's suggestion: negotiation location at a nunnery on Henan Island.

It was agreed: the two sides would meet the next night at the Lotus Vihara on Henan Island. It was close to the city and convenient.

"What? Gao Ju chose a nunnery for negotiations. Does he have bad intentions?" Chen Haiyang was uneasy.

"You don't know the tone here; it's not a real nunnery." Wen Desi, a Guangzhou native, knew much of Guangzhou's historical romantic and decadent pastimes. "This is a service industry establishment hanging a Buddhist sign. The nuns inside are women who kept their hair."

"You mean?" Chen Haiyang didn't know Guangzhou history had such style.

"Correct," Wen Desi nodded. "This business was very prosperous in old Guangzhou. A rich man like Gao Ju probably dabbled in such things, maybe he's a patron. That's why he wants to meet there."

"Negotiating in a brothel, truly wonderful."

"But it's safe. The enjoyments inside should be top-notch," Wen Desi said. "Just maybe not to our taste."

Chen Haiyang summoned the fleet's Political Security Commissioner, ordering him to deploy security at Lotus Vihara early next morning.

The next night, Gao Ju arrived as promised. Secret negotiations began in the Vihara.

Gao Ju had communicated with Li Fengjie beforehand. The government's primary condition was the Australian fleet withdrawing from the Provincial River, preferably from the Pearl River Estuary. Other details were negotiable, but this had to be done quickly. The longer the fleet stayed at Bai'etan, the harder for Li Fengjie to explain.

Overall, Li Fengjie and others believed the Australians launched the attack in anger over Wang Zunde "unauthorized border provocation" and Tian Da closing the Purple Enterprise. Thus, the conditions he allowed Gao Ju to promise were merely: Purple Enterprise could reopen immediately, all seized properties and equipment returned; goods confiscated and sold would be compensated with 10,000 taels; Australians could trade freely in and out of Guangzhou under a local agent's name, with the government promising not to arrest or ban them.

These three terms were formulated by Li Fengjie and his advisors. They believed overseas merchants only sought the right to trade with the Ming; granting this would satisfy the Australians—a privilege previously enjoyed only by the Portuguese.

As for returning houses and small silver compensation, it was merely to show Guangdong's "sincerity."

Wen Desi naturally wasn't satisfied with such conditions. Nor would the Senate be. A significant portion of the Senate conceptualized signing a Ming version of the "Treaty of Nanjing"—cession of territory, indemnity, five-port commerce.

However, in the Executive Committee meeting, everyone agreed this was unlikely, especially in the Ming's specific historical context. Neither Li Fengjie nor Wang Zunde had the guts to do such a thing. Forcing an unequal treaty would only result in a breakup and an awkward "no war, no peace" situation.

After repeated deliberations, the Senate set minimum negotiation requirements: First, immediate end to hostilities and restoration of normal trade—Lingao was a regime highly dependent on foreign trade. This was the Pearl River campaign's primary goal. Second, confirmation that Hong Kong Island and surrounding outlying islands belonged to the Transmigrators; government troops could not pose military threats to that area or ships sailing there.

As for the latter, it didn't need a written signature, just a tacit agreement. Such a territorial cession treaty—even Chongzhen himself probably wouldn't dare agree.

Wen Desi presented these terms one by one. Clearly, there was no objection to the first. But ceding Hong Kong and surrounding islands greatly exceeded Gao Ju's tolerance—the Portuguese spent immense effort to get Macau and still worried about expulsion. The Australians opened their mouths demanding Hong Kong and dozens of surrounding islands. Lantau Island alone was bigger than Hong Kong Island!

The Ming didn't care much about coastal islands, generally letting them sink or swim. Including Li Fengjie, most Guangdong officials didn't care how many islands the province had or their conditions. But ceding land violated a supreme Ming taboo.

Gao Ju dared not agree. He pondered for a long time: "Shopkeeper Wen! Actually, whatever goods, money, or servants you want now is easy. But this ceding of land, the Governor will absolutely never agree to."

"This, you can discuss slowly. We aren't in a hurry." Wen Desi smiled, examining the meditation room hosting them—clean, elegant, with exquisite snacks on the table. "This place is so comfortable. We've squatted in that small place Lingao for two or three years; shouldn't we relax properly here for a few months?"

"Yes, yes, naturally." Gao Ju realized terms wouldn't be easy. He said he had to ask Li Fengjie, but hoped the Australians would withdraw from the Provincial River quickly before asking, to avoid prolonged martial law in Guangzhou which made it hard for Commission Li to explain.

"Withdrawing from the Provincial River is acceptable. But we came all this way; withdrawing on just a word from Elder Gao makes it impossible for us to answer to the Senate."

Gao Ju knew other conditions were coming. Regardless, Li Fengjie made Australian withdrawal the top priority.

Wen Desi's condition: Guangzhou pays 300,000 taels immediately as a Ransom Fee; disband remaining water-braves; destroyed forts along the way must not be rebuilt.

Once paid, the Task Force would withdraw immediately. Detailed negotiations could continue in Macau.

"Three hundred thousand taels?!" Li Fengjie almost screamed—this was a lion opening its mouth wide. He thought granting trade permission was immense grace enough to soothe everything. Unexpectedly, they demanded 300,000 taels ransom—the entire Provincial Treasury held only 370,000 taels. Even if he could pay, he couldn't find a pretext to expense such a huge sum.

Li Fengjie slapped the table, indignant: "They don't know the height of heaven and depth of earth! Allowing trade is already immense grace! Insatiable! Ignore them, see what they can do! I don't believe their few dozen ships and thousand men can breach Guangzhou with a few cannons!"

Gao Ju remained silent; he also felt the conditions were harsh. But if Governor Wang hadn't insisted on "Exterminating Bandits," the Australians would still be trading peacefully. If Li Fengjie had been decisive in negotiating months ago instead of stalling, sending envoys to Lingao then, it wouldn't have come to enemies under the city walls forcing a treaty.

The government definitely couldn't produce 300,000 taels. Gao Ju thought even if forced, it would fall on the wealthy merchants—for this Bandit affair, the Gao family had been extorted of no less than 20,000 taels from "Assisting Rations" to "River Defense Aid." Opening a 300,000 hole meant paying thousands more.

Li Fengjie sat silent with closed eyes for a long time, then opened them: "The Bandits really say they'll withdraw upon payment?"

"Exactly." Gao Ju recounted Wen Desi's conditions in detail. "After withdrawing from the Provincial River, other terms can be discussed slowly in Macau."

Li Fengjie kept a wooden face, pondering again: "Do Australians keep their word?"

"Australians founded their nation on commerce; trust is their root."

"But ancients say, no merchant is not treacherous," Li Fengjie muttered, seemingly forgetting the tall official before him was a "merchant."

Gao Ju sneered inwardly. Li Fengjie was at his wit's end, yet still postured as calm and confident. Officials indeed cultivated thick skins.

There were ways, but with Gao Ju's status, giving Li Fengjie ideas was bad—it might endanger his own interests. Considering repeatedly, he decided to say nothing and leave.

Li Fengjie naturally couldn't think of a brilliant plan. The number 300,000 weighed on his heart. Pay, he couldn't; don't pay, these greedy Australians wouldn't withdraw—they extorted endless food and wealth from the countryside and could stay as long as they liked.

He summoned trusted advisors to discuss countermeasures. Some said the Bandits were bluffing and wouldn't attack; some said delay response to see reaction; some suggested Gao Ju bargain down the price; others suggested the old rule—make big families pay.

He Chengzong remained silent: 300,000 taels was nothing in Guangzhou past. Gathering big merchants and explaining the crisis would raise it easily. But now it was different. Within a year, big families had been squeezed several times. Forcing them again was hard—these weren't small merchants with thin capital; most had high backing in provincial or capital officials. Provoking them was unwise.

After a while, he spoke: "Current plan, asking big households is hard. Only borrowing!"

"Borrow?"

"Yes." He Chengzong nodded. "The city can raise not just 300,000 but 3 million. Summon the big households, explain the stakes, then ask each to lend to the government, with government guarantee and appropriate interest—this benefits both public and private; they will agree."

Governor's Yamen borrowing money—the guarantee was solid. And it contained an implied warning against "refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit." Big households would understand.
