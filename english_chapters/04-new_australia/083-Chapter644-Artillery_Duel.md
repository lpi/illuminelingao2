# Chapter 644 Artillery Duel

The Number 6 Gunner standing next to the ammunition box immediately opened the lid, searched for the number he needed from a table pasted on the inside of the lid, and then answered loudly:

"Elevation 4 degrees 40 minutes!"

The Number 3 Gunner standing on the right side of the breech immediately turned the handle to adjust the cannon to the correct angle—the new gun mount developed by the Mechanical Department not only could adjust firing direction but also improved the elevation adjustment system. The angle indicator was installed directly on the breech; the Number 3 Gunner could quickly adjust it into place by turning the handle, reducing the work of the Number 4 and Number 1 Gunners. Meanwhile, the Number 6 Gunner took out a shell from the ammunition box and handed it to the Number 5 Gunner waiting aside. The shell was an old-style fixed ammunition: the spherical solid shot was tied together with a propellant bag wrapped in cloth strips and cotton cloth. The Number 5 Gunner put the shell into a wicker basket and then carried it to the Number 1 Gunner for inspection.

"Ammunition correct! Load!"

The Number 2 Gunner received the shell, oriented the propellant bag towards the breech, and put the shell into the muzzle. The Number 3 Gunner holding the rammer immediately inserted the rammer into the muzzle, pushing the shell all the way to the bottom of the bore. The Number 4 Gunner standing on the left side of the breech pricked a long awl through the vent of the breech into the bore, piercing the wrapping cloth outside the propellant bag, took out a friction primer, hooked the pull ring on the primer with the hook on the lanyard, and inserted it into the vent.

"Ready!"

This dazzling series of complex movements took only a short few dozen seconds. The coordination between the 6 gunners had to be very skilled to be busy without disorder. A well-trained M1857 artillery crew could reach 4 rounds per minute during rapid fire. However, the cannon would overheat quickly and fail to fire this way. Now the artillery on the earthen dike adopted a sustained rate of fire of one round per minute.

"Fire!"

The Number 4 Gunner immediately pulled the lanyard in his hand hard. With a huge bang and a long burst of fire, the entire cannon and the gunners around it were enveloped in a cloud of huge white smoke. The cannon, pushed by the huge recoil, jumped backward.

"M1857, cheap price and sufficient quantity." Lin Shenhe, who stood beside Zhang Berlin holding binoculars, muttered to himself. He claimed to be here to inspect the performance of weapons and equipment and the results of artillery training on the field, but actually, he was here to watch the excitement. Incidentally, to see what new gadgets he could tinker with.

The killing effect of solid shots was very satisfactory, but amidst such a surging tide of people, it seemed difficult to force the enemy to rout. Two Ming army units were still shouting and charging towards the Grand Camp.

"Don't worry!" Lin Shenhe pretended to be calm, "According to Civil War experience, infantry has to persist until they eat canister shot within 100 meters before they rout..."

"Boss, this is the Ming Army, not the Union Army or the Confederate Army." Zhang Berlin regarded Lin Shenhe as an expert among experts because all muzzle-loading artillery gunnery and tactics were taught by him. "Shouldn't a medieval army like the Ming Army collapse very quickly?"

"That the Ming Army will collapse once shelled is not what I said." Lin Shenhe shrugged, "However, causing the whole army to collapse just by shelling is probably something only the Great Qing can achieve."

According to his observation, the density of shelling was still a bit low relative to the surging crowd. This density of fire was just an average level in the Civil War era.

"Quick! Pull quickly!" Soldiers of the Firearms Camp roared, constantly whipping the conscripted laborers and oxen/horses. Red Barbarian Cannons were dragged toward gun positions one by one amidst cursing, groaning, wailing, and the neighing of oxen and horses. Last night these heavy cannons had been set up behind trenches in various camps as defensive weapons. Since the cannons were fully four *li* away from the Hair Bandit camp, the shots couldn't reach at all. Li Baidao organized men and horses to drag the cannons, seeking to get as close as possible before firing.

But the movement of men and horses in front blocked the Firearms Camp's advance. The road wasn't cleared until the Chaozhou soldiers began to attack. Li Baidao dared not delay, hurriedly urging soldiers to push the cannons.

"The enemy is transporting cannons." News came from the observation post.

"Where?" Ying Yu pushed his hat back on his head, raising binoculars to look, "Saw them!" He shouted, then picked up the telephone:

"Berlin, government troops are pushing Red Barbarian Cannons on your front right! Hurry give them a beating with shells!"

"Load solid shot, target distance 1320 meters!" Zhang Berlin went into battle personally, holding binoculars to range, "Whole company rapid fire!"

A few minutes later, an artillery company organized by Zhang Berlin immediately opened fire on the Firearms Camp's moving Red Barbarian Cannons.

Solid shots fired by 12-pounder Napoleon guns smashed down on the Firearms Camp one after another. The first round of shells landed in the infantry ranks lining up not far from the Firearms Camp, causing a burst of chaos. Li Baidao looked pale with fright as shells fired from the earthen dike dragged smoke trailing over the charging infantry in front, falling straight towards here!

"Bad!" Just as this thought flashed through his mind, the second round of shells already smashed down on the Firearms Camp's team overwhelmingly.

A shell landed not far away, then bounced and flew towards the column. It directly broke an ox in two, then the bloody shell jumped up again and brought down several laborers, leaving a ground of severed limbs and mince. Then several more shells landed in the column. The entire Firearms Camp was in chaos with men shouting and horses neighing. Runaway horses and frightened oxen scrambled in the column, ruthlessly trampling wounded soldiers on the ground. Cannons overturned; one gun carriage was hit directly by a shell, the gun barrel knocked upright then heavily crashing down, smashing the brains of several unlucky guys. The gun carriages, sturdy to the point of being clumsy, fell apart with just a graze from the flying shells.

Li Baidao watched as the most powerful Red Barbarian Cannons either overturned on the ground or had their carriages destroyed by shells, sinking into the mud unable to move. Not to mention heavy casualties among oxen and horses, the frightened oxen ran wild everywhere with blood-red eyes. Surrounding infantry were charged by oxen and horses, throwing the formation into great chaos. Some were cursing "Pujie," some cursing "F*ck your mother."

Fortunately, the 12-pounder rapid fire didn't last too long, so Li Baidao managed to pick up his little life. The most valuable and powerful Red Barbarian Cannons in his Firearms Camp had been beaten to pieces. Some broke in two, some barrels cracked, some carriages were destroyed, and cannons sank deep into the mud. Great manpower would be needed to dig the cannons out.

Li Baidao already knew the enemy's artillery range far exceeded his own and could no longer entertain the idea of pushing cannons closer to fire—going further forward, he feared he couldn't even set up the cannons.

Immediately, he gathered the remnants and gathered back, preparing to use two 4000-jin heavy cannons that could fire fifteen-jin cannonballs. These two Red Barbarian Cannons could reach up to three *li* away at furthest. But what they could hit was hard to say.

"The Ming Army opened fire!" The observation post shouted in the walkie-talkie. Zhang Berlin was startled and subconsciously squatted down. He saw two black shadows tearing through the smoke flying towards here, but both shells landed one after another in places still far from the trench, only kicking up a large amount of dirt. Then two more shells flew over; one bounced a few times on the ground and finally fell into the trench.

Ying Yu called the observation post via walkie-talkie: "Find the enemy gun position!"

Soon the place where the Firearms Camp fired was found. Ranging showed they were firing from about 2100 meters away.

"At this distance, the Red Barbarian Cannon's range can't reach at all." Lin Shenhe said.

Seeming to confirm his words, the two Red Barbarian Cannons fired several shots, but not a single shell hit the earthen dike. The farthest one only rolled into the trench by bouncing.

Seeing that after firing the shells didn't even touch the enemy's dirt skin, Li Baidao was greatly anxious. He shouted loudly "Add more powder!"

The gunners had originally loaded the maximum gunpowder according to the gun scale. Now hearing to add more powder, everyone turned pale with fright. Because cannons exploding was a common occurrence in the army at that time; once a cannon burst, surrounded gunners would hardly survive even if not killed on the spot.

"Add powder!" Li Baidao drew his waist saber and slashed in the air, "Violators—beheaded!"

Under the threat of beheading, the gunners added one-third more gunpowder. To show he wasn't afraid of overloading, Li Baidao lit the cannon personally.

The 4000-jin Red Barbarian Cannon burst out with a huge bang violently. The heavy gun carriage retreated almost jumping. Two soldiers who couldn't dodge in time were immediately knocked down, vomiting blood and dying.

This shell finally flew over a distance of nearly two kilometers and hit a bastion of the camp, but at this time the trajectory was already so low that it only smashed fiercely against the bastion wall, knocking down a piece of dirt.

"Enemy artillery bearing..." The observation post finally discovered the smoke when Li Baidao's Red Barbarian Cannon fired through the dense gunpowder smoke.

"Knock out the enemy gun position!" Ying Yu ordered, "I don't want enemy artillery interference."

But even Lin Shenhe couldn't guarantee to immediately destroy these two isolated gun positions at a distance of 2000 meters using M1857s. Several shells fired in succession deviated very far. While everyone was busy aiming and calculating, suddenly a loud bang came from the direction of the Firearms Camp gun position, and a plume of thick smoke rushed straight into the sky.

"Unknown explosion at enemy gun position!" The observation post reported.

"Did the powder magazine explode?" Zhang Berlin hurriedly raised his binoculars.

Lin Shenhe shook his head: "Powder magazine explosion would be much more violent. I think it's a burst barrel."

His estimate was not wrong. After firing twice with "super-strong charges" in succession, a heavy cannon suddenly burst. The shockwave and fragments instantly killed more than a dozen people around. Li Baidao escaped a calamity only by being washed away more than ten meters by the shockwave and falling on a dead horse.

Li Baidao propped up his body and climbed up. His head was dizzy, ears buzzing. He shook his head hard and found the surrounding soldiers had all fled, leaving even that intact Red Barbarian Cannon behind. several of his personal soldiers ran over to hold him up. Li Baidao wanted to continue loading and firing, only to find cracks had already appeared on the barrel of this intact heavy cannon. Firing another shot would undoubtedly mean his own death. He was so angry he slashed his saber wildly in the air.

The whistling of Hair Bandit shells flying over sounded in the air again. A personal soldier hurriedly snatched his saber, saying: "Garrison Commander Sir, quick, take cover, the Hair Bandits are firing again." Several other people held him up and ran back.

"The enemy artillery position is finished." Zhang Berlin phoned Ying Yu.

"Very good, quickly organize artillery fire to intercept enemy infantry!"

Although the 12-pounder cannon fire was fierce, it didn't make the enemy waver quickly. Although the huge killing effect produced every time a shell landed caused a portion of soldiers to waver and rout, they quickly surged up again driven by officers. The main body of government troops had surged to a place five hundred meters from the earthen dike. Fubo Army's howitzers also joined the roaring ranks, explosive shells constantly falling into the columns. Although the killing effect was average, the fact that shells exploded upon landing caused great vacillation among the officers and soldiers.

When they finally approached to about three hundred meters from the rampart wall under artillery fire, the Fubo Army infantry officers on the rampart wall raised their command sabers simultaneously:

"Sights 300 meters—Fire!"

Hundreds of Minié rifles emitted crackling gunshots. Dense rain of bullets swept through the entire vanguard. Hundreds of people were hit and fell to the ground instantly. This sudden blow finally made the already wavering infantry unable to hold on. The road rushing towards the enemy seemed never so distant and dangerous. Tong Yizhen beheaded several routing soldiers in succession but still couldn't stop the tide of soldiers retreating. He was shouting loudly, demanding generals to maintain order and not allow soldiers to rout. But a bullet suddenly knocked his horse down. He fell to the ground instantly. His personal soldiers hurriedly held him up. Lieutenant Colonel Tong immediately jumped on a second horse, but at this time his standard-bearer's armor suddenly exploded before his eyes; the standard-bearer fell from his horse without even a hum.

This terrified him to the point of splitting his liver and gall. The Hair Bandits were shooting with some firearm he couldn't see. He knew he was already in a very dangerous position and no longer insisted on continuing the attack, allowing personal soldiers and house guards to protect him retreating down. Once the main general retreated, the soldiers ran even faster. Smoke dispersed, leaving only a ground of flags, armor, weapons, and corpses.

The soldiers on the earthen dike burst out a wave of cheers from the heart. Many had prepared for a desperate battle, not expecting the government army to retreat so quickly. Pride, contempt, and a sense of pride filled their chests. Many waved their weapons and cheered for their first victory.

He Rubin watched helplessly as four thousand combat soldiers routed under Hair Bandit artillery fire without even approaching the enemy's earthen dike. The Firearms Camp, on which he placed high hopes and thought comparable to Hair Bandit artillery, was beaten upside down by enemy artillery before even setting up gun positions. His face darkened completely. How to fight such a battle? Not even a chance for close combat! He had already seen that Hair Bandit cannons shot further and more accurately than Red Barbarian Cannons, and the speed of fire was much faster. Compared to Red Barbarian Cannons that took a long time to fire one shot, the cannons set on the Hair Bandit earthen dike were spewing thick smoke and fire almost non-stop, pouring bullets like rain on the heads of officers and soldiers.

"Reporting to Your Excellency!" A personal soldier ran over hurriedly and knelt down, "Leilian Lieutenant Colonel General Zhao was killed in action!"

"What?!" He Rubin was startled. He hurriedly raised binoculars to look towards the direction of Zhao Qiansi's main attack. Those two thousand people were fleeing back in total defeat.

A great general died before even engaging in close combat! He hurriedly asked: "How did General Zhao die in action?"

"Reporting to Your Excellency, he was hit by a bird gun..."

"Nonsense!" He Rubin could no longer contained his panic, "This Commander saw clearly, his big flag was fully six or seven hundred paces from the stockade wall, how could he be hit by a bird gun?"

The personal soldier didn't know why his Excellency was so particular about what killed him, and hurriedly reported: "Small one dare not speak nonsense. General Zhao's body has been snatched back and is now in the camp. Confirmed hit by bird gun."

"Get out!" He shouted angrily, gasped a rough breath, and loudly ordered: "Beat drums!"

With the drum sound, a new wave of fresh troops marched out from the camp. This was the Training Guerrilla's men and horses, plus the Governor's Standard and Regional Commander's Standard. It could be called the most elite men and horses in this expedition. Of course, he still had the Regional Commander's Standard Troops and five hundred house guards, but this was his capital; he wouldn't use them until the most critical moment.

He called the battalion generals of the three battalions over to give confidential instructions.

"Everyone saw it." He had a gloomy face, "Hair Bandit cannons are very severe. Shoot far, shoot accurate. Li Baidao's Firearms Camp was crippled before opening fire—can't count on them. When you spread out the formation in a while, remember, the ranks must be spread loose. Separate squad by squad. Don't crowd people together like Generals Tong and Zhao did just now, densely rushing up!"

"Humble generals understand!"

He Rubin said slowly, "Whichever General's men and horses ascend the stockade first, this Commander will record the top merit for him!"

He Ming was very surprised seeing the government army rout before approaching the Grand Camp. He secretly counted; the cannon that fired the most on the entire earthen dike only fired just over fifty shells. The artillery fire was far from dense, yet four or five thousand men and horses retreated just like that. Even for a medieval army, back then the Zulus fought the British until corpses littered the field before dispersing. It seemed the Ming Army's combat will was not high. However, he heard people from the Great Library History Research Team say that the difference between Ming Army elite and general troops was very big.

"The ones launching the attack just now were the Leilian Lieutenant Colonel and Chaozhou Lieutenant Colonel units." Dongmen Chuiyu had already obtained the latest report summarized by observation posts.

"According to observation post observations: at least 31 Ming officers of Chiliarch rank and above participated in the attack. Our side confirmed killing 5, probable killing 7. According to sniper reports, Leilian Lieutenant Colonel Zhao Qiansi was hit by a sniper during the battle, current life or death unknown."

Hearing that a sniper hit a major Lieutenant Colonel, He Ming nodded. The sniper's power was indeed not to be underestimated. After all, cannons, no matter how powerful, couldn't achieve such precision strikes.

"Artillery fired a total of 493 shells, 371 solid shots, 122 explosive shells." He turned a page, "Destroyed eleven Red Barbarian Cannons."

"Our side's casualties and equipment loss figures."

"Five lightly wounded, no deaths, no losses."
