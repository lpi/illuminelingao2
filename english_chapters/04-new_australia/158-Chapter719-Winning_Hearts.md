# Chapter 719 - Winning Hearts

"Women's foolishness!" Luo Tianqiu silently cursed. But he did not say it aloud. The Lady's maiden family were also influential gentry, and she had always been capable in managing the household. With the outside situation chaotic, "domestic harmony" came first. He only shook his head: "Now is the time to win hearts. Talk of confiscating land and sealing houses—aren't you afraid some mud-leg will betray us to the crop-heads!"

The Lady realized he had a point and sighed in frustration. She had the maids lay out the meal. One compartmented food box held eight appetizers; there were also six dishes. The Lady poured him a cup of *Guoshi Wushuang*—specially purchased from Guangzhou. Luo Tianqiu was very fond of this pure, crisp grain liquor. It came in clear crystal bottles, pleasing to the eye.

"There isn't much of this wine left. The steward says the distillery in Guangzhou was sealed by the government." The Lady's complaints emerged.

Luo Tianqiu smiled: "That distillery belongs to the crop-heads. Of course it got sealed."

"The crop-heads'? Isn't it the Australians'?"

"The crop-heads are the Australians; the Australians are the crop-heads."

"Heavens! So that famous Pei Xiuli in Guangzhou—she's a foreign woman?"

"Well, the Australians are still considered Chinese. They claim to be descendants of the Song at Yashan. Their leader is surnamed Wen—a descendant of Chancellor Wen."

"Then wouldn't they be loyal retainers' progeny?" The Lady said in surprise.

After lunch, Luo Tianqiu could not sleep. The crop-head invasion was imminent; he needed to prepare. Besides, rent collection would soon be on the agenda.

"I'll go to the outer courtyard first." Luo Tianqiu headed for the outer residence.

His household affairs office was "Camphor Flourishing Hall." Several stewards and accountants awaited his instructions. But Luo Tianqiu simply said: "Let's see the Rent Court!"

The Rent Court was large, its walls entirely brick-and-stone—precautions against arson. The gatehouse was thick with iron-clad doors. Above the gate was a loft for guards to fire through loopholes. During riots or bandit attacks, the gates would close and several hundred attackers could not break in.

Luo Tianqiu passed through to the Rent Court. The courtyard was empty—rent season had not begun. Rows of buildings surrounded the yard. At center was the verification station with scales. Piles of baskets and grain sacks stood ready for collection.

Luo Tianqiu inspected and felt satisfied. He proceeded to the rear courtyard—the granaries. He asked how much of last year's stock remained. When the manager's figures matched his memory, he was pleased. He randomly ordered granaries opened to verify figures.

In several granaries he detected problems. Grain totals were correct, but deterioration was severe—worse than when he had inspected last year. Luo Tianqiu snorted. The old switch-and-swap trick. He glanced at the men behind him. "A dog can't stop eating shit"—the phrase surfaced in his mind. Every one had received great kindness from him. The manager Sun Yulin had been his page boy and catamite. In less than five years, the once-handsome youth had grown fat—and skilled at embezzlement!

Luo Tianqiu did not make a scene. These past years he had not watched subordinates as closely—still waters run clear when there are no fish. As chaos increased, treating underlings harshly bred resentment. If someone conspired with bandits as an inside man, consequences could be severe.

He would resolve this quietly. Then he said he wanted to visit the west wing.

"Master! Why there? It's dirty and stinking..." The steward asked in surprise.

"To have a look." Luo Tianqiu said simply.

The west wing—the "Interrogation Station"—was the Luo family's private jail. Tenants who could not pay rent were brought here for imprisonment and torture.

The courtyard was large. Over a hundred defaulters were imprisoned. Someone was sobbing; others moaned. In the center, a man was strapped to a punishment bench, buttocks bloody, crying out loudly. Guards sat nearby drinking water.

Luo Tianqiu normally did not concern himself with such matters. But with crop-heads so close, holding so many prisoners—what if some family member betrayed Sanliang Market?

"What's this man's story?"

"This is Hao Shengke. He didn't pay last year's rent in full. He signed a promissory note but still couldn't pay. We told him to send his wife to work off the debt. He claims he's divorced her—obviously trying to cheat..."

"Master, I wouldn't dare..." Hao Shengke was terrified. "My mother fell ill last year. Please grant a few months' grace. I'll pay everything..."

"Hao Shengke, is it? His family have been tenants for generations." Luo Tianqiu said slowly. "You treated your mother's illness—that's filial piety! This master will make an exception. This beating settles your old debts." He gestured: "Clean him up and let him go!"

The manager was startled. He hastily called for men to untie the prisoner.

"Everyone in this west wing—review their cases." Luo Tianqiu ordered. "Those whose offenses are minor—release them all."
