# Chapter 635 - The Hair Thieves' Background

Granular gunpowder is a step up compared to powdered gunpowder. Powdered gunpowder easily absorbs moisture, and during storage and transport, it gradually separates due to shaking, resulting in more charcoal powder in the upper layer and more sulfur powder in the lower layer. This causes uneven mixing, which is unfavorable for both the power and safety of the gunpowder.

Li Modao watched the craftsmen granulating with great interest and inquired about the details. It turned out this technique was also introduced by Westerners. The craftsmen said that such gunpowder not only ignited reliably but was also less prone to moisture, much better than the powdered gunpowder used previously.

"Another Western idea!" Li Modao felt a hope in his heart that he could simply meet a Westerner and ask him face-to-face about the usage of these Western firearms.

"How much gunpowder has been made?" he asked.

The manager of the Gunpowder Bureau reported: "Reporting to the Master, ten thousand catties have been made so far. Mostly propellant, with a small amount of explosive powder. Also toxic gunpowder and powder cakes."

"That's too little. Ten thousand catties isn't enough."

"Yes, but the hemp stalk charcoal needed is hard to find; we are switching to willow charcoal." The manager said, "Making gunpowder now is different from before; saltpeter and sulfur must both be purified before use. Just purifying raw sulfur requires beef tallow and lard; ten catties consume two or three catties of fat. It takes quite some time to procure."

Leaving the Gunpowder Bureau's enclosure, three or four li away black smoke soared into the sky. This was the location of the Blacksmith Battalion. Most military weapons were made of iron. Although the government had specialized bureaus to manufacture weapons, the army still carried some blacksmith tools, iron stock, and charcoal to repair weapons at any time, and rush-produce some high-consumption weapons like arrowheads and iron shot when necessary. Now the Blacksmith Battalion was rushing to make cannonballs and bullets day and night.

In the camp, clanging sounds of forging and repairing swords and spears came from a shed, while seven or eight iron-smelting furnaces burned fiercely in the open air, melting pig iron to cast cannonballs. The ground was full of clay molds of various sizes.

Li Modao saw the stockpile yard on one side piled high with various iron materials, including iron bricks and rods bought from ironworks, as well as various discarded weapons and objects from the army. Used crucibles and broken clay molds were piled into mounds several feet high. Newly cast cannonballs of various sizes were held in rattan baskets, piling up over an area the size of several mu. Li Modao knew small baskets held large cannonballs, while large baskets held grapeshot.

The Thousand Household officer managing the camp hurried out to greet him upon seeing his arrival. Like gunpowder, Li Modao had an urgent demand for producing more cannonballs as quickly as possible. Cannonball consumption was huge during battles, especially since they prepared for a long siege this time. If the situation arose where the Firearms Battalion had no ammo available and missed a war opportunity, his head would not be secure.

He looked at the large cannonballs in the baskets. The casting quality was uneven; some were very round, while others had significant differences in diameter. The surface finish of the projectiles also varied. Some large cannonballs were extremely rough, almost honeycomb-like. More critically, for the same 5-catty cannonballs, sizes actually varied slightly, with some differing greatly—visible errors in dimensions at a glance.

"These large cannonballs must be sorted." He said to the Thousand Household officer managing the Blacksmith Battalion who greeted him. "Only the roundest and smoothest can be used for Red Barbarian Cannons. The others can only serve as grape shot/canister shot. Also the dimensions—some big, some small. Must be sorted too."

Li Modao knew big cannonballs like this were fine as grape shot for old-style cannons like Crouching Tigers, but using them in breech-loading Frankish cannons or Red Barbarian Cannons would cause loading jams or, in serious cases, even barrel bursts.

Years of experience firing firearms told him that if the projectile wasn't smooth and round enough, even the best-cast cannon would leak gas, failing to shoot far, or worse, explode.

The next day, He Rubin was speaking with his staff in the main tent when someone suddenly reported that a person from Qiongshan had answered the recruitment call, claiming to be a Lingao native who had fought the Hair Thieves and knew their details extremely clearly, wishing to serve before the army.

"Good, send a dispatch to Guangzhou to have this person escorted here immediately." He Rubin's spirits lifted. So far, he hadn't recruited a single Lingao local, let alone one claiming to have fought the Hair Thieves.

"According to the Qiongzhou Prefect's report: This person is named Gou Chengxuan. He was stripped of his Xiucai degree by the province for 'colluding with bandits' and is also wanted by the county. I fear he is not a good person."

"Colluding with bandits?" He Rubin thought, could this person have worked for the Hair Thieves? If so, he would be easier to control. If he were a Xiucai, he would have to be polite, but since he was a fugitive colluding with bandits, he could mold him however he wanted. "Let Qiongzhou Prefecture send him here as soon as possible."

Gou Chengxuan had escaped from Lingao a few months ago. During the autumn tax collection, he originally waited for the gentry and landlords to stir up trouble so he could fish in troubled waters and create a huge scene, making the Hair Thieves suffer. Unexpectedly, Huang Bingkun disdained allying with him. He acted alone and failed completely, allowing the Hair Thieves' land measurement plan to succeed.

Failing to stir up trouble, he could no longer stay in Lingao County City. As the transmigrator group took over the county yamen, massive cleaning and rectification of Lingao County City began. Beggars and vagrants formerly surviving in the city were all arrested. Gou Chengxuan knew continuing to disguise as a beggar in the city wouldn't work. If caught by the Hair Thieves, even if his identity wasn't exposed, he'd be taken to quarry stones or dig sand, suffering Fu Youdi's whip. He quickly retrieved clothes and a small amount of silver from a hiding place and escaped the county city under the cover of the Lai brothers.

Seeing he couldn't stay in Lingao, Gou Chengxuan could only prepare to flee. He let Lai Xiao, who worked in the county school, continue lurking in the city, while he took Lai Da to run to Qiongshan County City to settle temporarily. However, Gou Xunli, whom he went to Baopang Mountain to seek refuge with as a sworn brother, remained missing. With no news of his father, family wealth lost, and no way to take revenge, Gou Chengxuan almost wanted to drown himself in despair, fortunately persuaded by Lai Da who followed him.

Hearing in Qiongshan that the Court wanted to suppress Lingao, Gou Chengxuan, who had already despaired, finally felt Heaven had opened its eyes. Seeing recruitment for people knowing Hair Thief internal affairs, he enlisted immediately.

After being questioned for a while in Qiongshan, Gou Chengxuan and Lai Da were sent to the main camp in Guangzhou by the Qiongshan Magistrate.

He was sent to Humen Main Camp wearing a cangue and lock like a prisoner. Once off the boat, they unlocked him and let him wait in a tent.

Gou Chengxuan's heart was in turmoil. It seemed the government was very rude to him. Was it because his crime of "colluding with bandits" was known to the government? This matter had to be defended no matter what.

Before he could catch his breath, a personal guard came to summon him:

"By order of the Commander-in-Chief: Summon Gou Chengxuan to enter!"

"Yes, please lead the way, Deputy Master." Gou Chengxuan felt a burst of nervousness—this was his first time seeing such a high official.

He couldn't help trembling all over, hastily tidied his clothes and hat, and followed the guard toward the central army tent. A group of guards standing at the camp gate blocked him with horizontal swords. A guard leader looked him up and down and asked:

"You are Gou Chengxuan?"

"Yes, this lowly person is Gou Chengxuan." He answered in a low voice, trembling slightly.

"Do you carry knives or swords?"

"This lowly person is a mere scholar..."

"Cut the crap, do you or not?" The gate-keeping guard leader looked impatient.

"No, really no." Gou Chengxuan hastily defended himself.

The guard leader still wasn't reassured and searched his body before letting him enter the gate. The central army led him to kneel before He Rubin's desk. His heart beat like a drum; daring not lift his head, he said:

"Lowly commoner Gou Chengxuan pays respects to Your Excellency the Commander!"

"Are you the one who answered the recruitment notice, saying you understand the Hair Thieves' internal affairs?"

"It is this lowly person."

"You say you know the Hair Thieves' internal affairs; then you must serve the Court earnestly, and the Court will naturally reuse you." He Rubin sized him up, feeling this person looked treacherous and not kind. He didn't tell Gou Chengxuan to rise, just sipped tea slowly, asking after a long while:

"You claim you know all the Hair Thieves' details. Who are you yourself?"

"Answering Your Excellency, this lowly person is surnamed Gou..." Gou Chengxuan first told his background, naturally daring not mention the Gou family's glorious history in Lingao—harboring pirates, local bullies. He didn't even dare mention he was once a Xiucai, fearing they'd ask about his stripped degree—remember he was still a wanted criminal named by the government. He only said the Gou family was ordinary local gentry. When Hair Thieves first landed, lacking grain and men, they targeted Gou Family Village, gathered troops to break the village, killed his eldest uncle's whole family, robbed grain and wealth, and coerced all villagers. Only he and his father escaped alone.

Reaching the painful parts, Gou Chengxuan shed tears secretly. But inside this central army gate, he dared not cry aloud. He just narrated the causes and consequences once.

He Rubin saw him speaking through gritted teeth with red eyes. Knowing his words were likely true and he was unlikely a spy sent by Hair Thieves, he asked:

"You father and son are both wanted criminals named by Lingao County for 'colluding with bandits.' What do you have to say? Speak the truth!"

Gou Chengxuan's brain buzzed; this was what he feared most. He steadied himself before kowtowing and crying:

"The lowly one is truly wronged!" Saying this, countless thoughts turned in his mind. The first was whether to reveal Wu Mingjin's collusion with the Hair Thieves. He wanted to bite this magistrate hard, but dared not. Officials protected each other; who knew what backing Wu Mingjin had? If he made accusations, silencing him would be easier than crushing an ant for an official.

Currently, he could only push all blame onto the Hair Thieves. It wouldn't be too late to take revenge after gaining the government's full trust.

"The lowly one was framed by the Hair Thieves." Gou Chengxuan sorrowfully fabricated a story, saying after breaking his family's village, the Hair Thieves feared government prosecution, so they bribed corrupt county clerks to deliberately plant pirate flags, documents, and seals on him.

As for who this corrupt clerk was, it didn't matter. Anyway, county clerks were either killed by Hair Thieves or had completely joined them; no fear of them biting back.

"Master Wu listened to villains' slander, thinking the lowly one's whole family colluded with pirates. The lowly one is truly wronged; beg Your Excellency to perceive clearly!" He bowed repeatedly as he spoke.

He Rubin didn't care if he was wronged, just wanted to use this to beat him down a bit so he would obey orders submissively. Seeing him kowtowing like pounding garlic, he said:

"Whether wronged or not, you will be given an explanation after defeating the Hair Thieves! Only you must do your utmost. Even a guilty body can atone for crimes with merit. If you truly have great merit, earning a status isn't difficult."

"Thank You Commander for your vast grace!" Hearing he wouldn't pursue the crime and might even grant a degree for merit, Gou Chengxuan wept with gratitude, banging his head loudly on the ground. "The lowly one will surely do my utmost to repay Your Excellency's grace as high as heaven and thick as earth!"

" The Hair Thieves' firearms are reputed to be sharp; have you ever seen them?"

"Answering Your Excellency." Gou Chengxuan said carefully. "Hair Thief firearms are indeed sharp. The most sharp are their bird guns and volley guns."

He then explained that such bird guns were divided into two types: one used by submitting Fake Hairs, one used by True Hairs themselves. Regardless of True or Fake Hairs, issued bird guns needed no match cord and could fire upon raising.

"Guns used by Fake Hairs are called Minié. Similar to bird guns used by government troops. But firing requires no match cord, nor incense stick. Just placing a copper cap on the nipple allows firing. Can fire even in wind and rain. Each gun uses only one ball, but power is huge; not only pierces iron armor, range is also beyond four hundred paces."

Everyone in the central tent showed disbelief. A bird gun shooting beyond four hundred paces—could that still be called a bird gun? Even medium Frankish cannons couldn't hit that far.

Gou Chengxuan then said bird guns used by True Hairs were even more powerful, not needing reloading after each shot. Ammo was stored in an iron box on the gun body; soldiers fired at will. Called Repeating Bird Guns.

Now everyone disbelieved even more. Gou Chengxuan knew they didn't trust his words, so hurriedly explained:

"Days after Hair Thieves landed, Magistrate Wu commanded thousands of county militia to storm the enemy camp. But enemy bird guns rained bullets; militia were mostly dead or wounded before getting close. This is known to all in Lingao; the lowly one does not deceive the lords."

"What is a volley gun?"

"A volley gun is over ten bird gun barrels connected together. The gunner pulls a trigger, and the bird gun can fire continuously, either three or four shots, or seven or eight, or all at once. Bullet power is no different from Minié—pierces iron armor at four hundred paces."

A burst of surprised sighs rose in the tent. Although Ming people hadn't seen repeating guns, they could realize the power of rapid-fire weapons.

Sitting aside, Chang Qingyun couldn't help saying: "Bunch of nonsense! All firearms in the world need ignition. Without match cord or fuse, and without incense stick to light the vent, how to ignite gunpowder? Firing by placing a copper cap—isn't that sorcery!"

Other staff officers were also very suspicious. After all, this exceeded contemporary common sense too much. Lu Yizhong was more prudent, saying: "Overseas lands have many strange things, like crystal mirrors, self-striking clocks, iron fast ships. Hair Thieves are known for strange skills; having such firearms isn't strange."

Seeing Gou Chengxuan dared not speak, He Rubin said: "You needn't fear, just speak."

"Yes, yes." Seeing someone defend him and the Commander not refuting him, Gou Chengxuan's courage grew. "Australian... no, Hair Thief firearms actually use gunpowder no different from Great Ming. Only their gunpowder manufacture is finer, and they have several secret medicines used on guns and cannons, specifically fearing no wind or rain, self-igniting."

"Do you know how to make this secret medicine?"

"Secret medicines are all made in the Hair Thieves' Hundred Fathoms Stockade. All manufacturing passes through True Hairs' hands; Fake Hairs only do menial work. So the lowly one does not know the method."

Gou Chengxuan then said Hair Thief land soldiers all wore no armor, only short cloth jackets and rattan helmets. None used swords, spears, or shields; all used Minié fast guns equipped with triangular short spears, extremely sharp.

"...Hair Thieves shoot from afar, stab with triangular short spears up close."

Hearing Hair Thieves wore no armor, just cloth and rattan helmets, several generals couldn't help laughing scornfully. Rumors already said Hair Thief troops didn't wear armor—not even cotton armor. As for wearing rattan helmets, it was even stranger. Imitating the rattan armor troops in *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*?

"Hair Thief whole army uses bird guns; do they not drill with swords and spears?"

"Yes, the lowly one only saw Hair Thieves firing bird guns, occasionally drilling stabbing techniques. However, coerced commoners have those trained in long spear use."

"Heard Hair Thieves set up a giant cannon on the Bopu beacon tower, shooting ten li. Do you know of it?"

"The lowly one knows. There is one on the beacon tower, and one on the big iron ship's deck."

"One shot ten li, is there such a thing?"

Gou Chengxuan had seen the test firing of these two cannons. The Bopu naval fort artillery conducted live-fire drills every month. He had witnessed the amazing range of the shells, but the officials' reaction just now made him hesitate whether to cater to them and understate the range. However, if he understated it, when the Hair Thieves opened fire, his lie would be exposed immediately, perhaps leading directly to beheading by the government army. He thought for a moment before saying, "The lowly one has not seen it personally, but every firing shakes ten li. People say it can indeed shoot balls ten li away."

He Rubin asked again: "How many troops do Hair Thief land and naval forces have? How many True Hairs among them?"

"Answering Your Excellency, Hair Thief land force has over ten thousand." Gou Chengxuan naturally knew Australians didn't have that many troops, but decided to exaggerate to avoid angering the official lords by saying too few. "Navy also has ten thousand." He quickly added, "Among them True Hairs are very few, only over a thousand. All are Fujian/Guangdong maritime traitors and coerced commoners from everywhere."

"How many cannons do Hair Thieves have?"

"From what the lowly one saw, almost everywhere." Gou Chengxuan said Australian cannons could be seen everywhere in Lingao—many road towers had small cannons. As for field cannons, he had seen over ten. He also told He Rubin and others: Hair Thief cannons were lighter than Red Barbarian cannons; barrels not thick, carriages very light, easily towed by horses. The smallest cannon carts could be pulled flying by a single Sichuan horse.

"Hair Thieves lack mules and horses, only use forced laborers and Fake Hairs to pull cannons. One cannon needs dozens of people. So field battles only use light cannons, not heavy cannons."

"So, Hair Thieves have no Red Barbarian Cannons?"

"From what the lowly one saw, indeed none." Gou Chengxuan hesitated before saying.

"How is the power of Hair Thief cannons?"
