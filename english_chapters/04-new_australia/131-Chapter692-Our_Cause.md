# Chapter 692 - Our Cause

"Very simple." Rando said. Besides loading some emergency weapons and supplies onto the lifeboat, he and Hale had also packed another set of emergency supplies in a magnetic box, attaching it to the ship's hull.

"Anyone who can dive two or three meters can easily retrieve the box at low tide."

Lin Chuanqing laughed: "You really are a cunning fellow."

"If I weren't cunning enough, I'd have died many times over—when taking risks, always have a backup."

"Well said. Come, let's drink to our success tomorrow." Qian Shuiting poured soda for everyone.

Rando said: "To my ticket price."

The Navy's motorboat chugged along belching black smoke, towing behind it a huge cigar-shaped object covered in various marine organisms. At first glance it looked like a dying whale or sea beast bobbing in the waves. Yellow oil drums were strapped in rows on both sides of this huge thing as reserve buoyancy.

Two rowing boats full of Marines and sailors followed carefully. Their task was to constantly watch this object and prevent any accidents.

This huge thing was carefully towed to the shallows, where it grounded. Sailors jumped from the boats and in waist-deep seawater pushed the big thing forward, using poles and pulleys to load it onto the beach track and slowly pull it up to the pier. People gathered curiously in a circle.

"Not bad work." Qian Shuiting lowered his binoculars and lit a cigarette for himself. "Who would have guessed you'd drop a caisson in the waters off Dongsha Island. Without the coordinates you provided, we'd never have found it."

"When the caisson was dropped, a buoy floated up to mark the position," Weiss said. "Of course, no buoy would last three years. At the time we'd gone off course toward Dongsha Island—thought we'd definitely encounter Taiwan Coast Guard patrol boats for inspection. In the rush, we decided to drop it."

"No wonder your ship's stern was made as a ramp, with such a long slide from behind the bridge to the stern, and a crane under the gantry mast." Meng De said. "At first I thought it was for lowering fishing skiffs. You mean you kept this thing, over half the ship's length, up there the whole time?"

The former mercenary nodded.

"If you'd noticed certain clues when salvaging the *Maquarello*, you should have guessed there was still cargo on board. Of course, without precise coordinates, salvaging anything from the sea is difficult."

Qian Shuiting took a deep drag on his cigarette. The butt arced from his hand into the seawater. "Let's go, Mr. Weiss. Let's see what new gifts you've brought us."

The salvaged caisson had been pushed into a newly erected shed, still dripping water. Made of double-layer steel plates, the caisson was a long, thick cigar shape, its surface crawling with attached marine life. In the dim light, it looked like an oddly shaped reef.

The atmosphere inside and outside the shed was extremely heated, just like when Vessel A was brought up. A light ladder was raised. Gao Xiaosong and others climbed to the caisson's top, using knives to scrape off the marine growth and waterproof sealant from the cargo hatch bit by bit. The wheel turned. With several clanging sounds, the cargo hatch slowly opened. The watching crowd cheered and crowded into the shed, eager to be first to see.

Only Weiss sat under a coconut tree outside the shed, leisurely smoking.

The caisson's cargo hold was slightly damp but hadn't flooded. "What's this?" Gao Xiaosong opened a sealed iron box and took out a rectangular object wrapped in dark green aluminum-plastic film, seemingly a large bar of soap, with some English letters on it. He switched on his headlamp and examined it carefully.

Zhou Weisen came over: "This is 1.25-pound C4 explosive." He pulled back the waterproof cloth, counted the boxes, and exclaimed: "My God, so much!"

The mountain of explosive crates frightened away many enthusiastic spectators. Although everyone knew American military-standard demolition equipment was far safer than Lingao's homemade dynamite, being near a pile of explosives was still daunting.

When Weiss walked into the shed, Qian Shuiting was waving an ugly-looking short gun just taken out:

"What a letdown! I thought there'd be tactical nuclear warheads in this caisson. You were planning to use this to scam dollars from the Karen Army? Truly a heartless arms dealer."

"Looks like a submachine gun. What model?" Gao Xiaosong scrutinized the weapon, turning it over and over. A toy-like body assembled from plastic shells, a stock made of bent wire folded under the body. The crate also contained several translucent plastic drum magazines. Since dealing with the gun-savvy North Americans, the former Coast Guard captain had discovered his firearms knowledge was actually quite poor.

"MGV-176, a Yugoslav copy of the American American-180 submachine gun," Qian Shuiting said. "Police equipment. This gun's passable. High rate of fire, decent accuracy in automatic fire. But the .22 ammunition it uses is too weak."

"Why fuss over a few submachine guns?" The former mercenary and smuggler crossed his arms, leaning against a shed pillar. "If needed, your factories could mass-produce Stens or M3 grease guns. After all, you're not short on ammunition."

"Ammunition is exactly what we're short of. If we could mass-produce ammunition, we might've already started making AKs."

Guns were brought out of the cargo hold and inventoried one by one. Besides the unpopular MGV-176, the subsequent haul was more satisfying. Over twenty brand-new M240B machine guns were lined up on the ground. Barrels and components still had a thin coat of rust-preventive oil. FAL automatic rifles—including fixed-stock, standard-barrel types with bipods, and folding-stock, short-barrel carbine types—totaled 316, all shrink-wrapped. The middle of the cargo hold was stuffed with crates of ammunition. Besides the .22LR for the MGV-176 submachine guns, everything else was 7.62×51mm NATO rounds, sealed in specially made polyester packaging crates. Zhou Weisen, Gao Xiaosong, and Planning Committee representative Sun Xiao climbed up and down counting with several helpers—over a hundred crates.

"Enough to start a small war." Qian Shuiting told Weiss. "If you hadn't met us, you could've made a fortune from this deal." The latter just nodded. "Keep looking. King Solomon's treasures don't end here."

"You mean this?" Lin Chuanqing pointed at the crates brought out from the cargo hold's rear, plus devices resembling rocket launchers. Lao Di was startled: "Anti-tank missiles, Red Arrow 73!"

"Do you know how to use this?"

"No, but I saw them during military exercises. These aren't just for hitting tanks—they're also great for hitting landing craft, speedboats, bunkers, whatever."

"This isn't domestic Red Arrow 73, but definitely an AT-3 series anti-tank missile." Gao Xiaosong said. "There's writing on the packaging. 'Yugoimport-SDPR'—is that the manufacturer's name?"

"Yugoimport-SDPR is Serbia's state-owned arms company. No, wait until we're back at the base lab before you start tinkering with it." Weiss stopped Lin Chuanqing's attempt to open the airtight packaging.

"Twenty-four missiles, with shaped-charge and thermobaric warheads. Alright, everything's here. Count carefully—don't miss anything."

"Question is, who are we planning to use this on?"

Like the disposable rocket launchers salvaged from the ship's cabin, this was another puzzling question.

The 8154 cruiser sounded its whistle, escorting this modest-sized fleet away from Dongsha Island. Jiang Shan found Weiss on the aft deck. He was leaning on the railing, gazing at the white foam churned up by the propellers.

Jiang Shan briefly introduced himself. The former mercenary shook his head slightly: "I saw you that night in the interrogation room."

"Just received this telegram." Jiang Shan took out a transcription paper. "A congratulatory message from Chairman Wen to the entire search and salvage team. He specifically mentioned your name."

Weiss glanced at it and handed the transcription back: "I can't read Chinese characters."

"You'd better learn."

"Chinese characters are too difficult." Rando spat his cigarette butt into the sea. "But I'll try to learn to speak Chinese—it's the language of the transmigrators."

"What are you planning to do next?"

"Do what?" Weiss squinted at the waves. "I'm poor now, so I want to go back to Macao and collect the six hundred silver pesos owed to me."

"Li Siya won't give payment for nothing." Jiang Shan reminded him. "What are you prepared to exchange for that money?"

"That depends on what you want her to know, or what you want the Dutch to know. I'm very happy to be of service in that regard." Weiss guessed this Chinese intelligence chief was satisfied with his answer, because he called over a naval steward carrying a tray with a bottle of rum and two glasses.

"Let's have a drink." He said.

Weiss didn't take the glass. Instead, he pulled an engraved silver cup from his pocket. He had won this from a rich but foolish Spanish gambler. When he mingled in Macao, he often showed off this beautiful goblet as evidence of his fabricated Italian noble background. Now he filled this silver cup with rum: "So, what shall we drink to?"

"To our cause." Jiang Shan said.

"To our cause." Weiss murmured. He tilted his head back and drained the cup in one gulp, then with a flip of his wrist, tossed the exquisite silver goblet into the sea.
