# Chapter 578 - The Englishman's Usefulness

At this point, the Executive Committee members began to understand.

"What dirty work?" Zhan Wuya asked.

"The Englishman's old trade, I suppose." Ma Jia shook his head. "I'm against it—the cost-benefit ratio isn't favorable."

"Drug trafficking? Are we having them sell opium?" Ma Qianzhu objected. "India has plenty of that. The small amount Li Huamei's channel brings in is enough for medicinal use. Ade, don't tell me you're going the drug trafficking route too? That's a double-edged sword—it cuts others and cuts yourself."

"Not drug trafficking—slave trading. Something the English are doing quite enthusiastically right now." Wu De said.

"Importing black uncles?" Zhan Wuya shook his head vigorously. "I don't want a future where the Chinese mainland has some African tribe. Black uncles' racial characteristics are too distinctive! Even after several generations they'll be difficult to assimilate. If we must use slaves, I'd rather have Japanese or Koreans—at least they'll blend in eventually."

"Who said anything about black uncles?" Wu De replied. "I mean Southeast Asian natives."

"No good, no good." Ma Jia objected. "Southeast Asian natives' endurance and physical ability aren't great. Besides, the mainland has plenty of refugees—why not put more effort into recruitment instead of going all the way for Southeast Asian natives?"

"Use them at Tiandu and Shilu, wouldn't that work? And Taiwan later." Wu De said tactfully. "Besides, endurance isn't genetic—it's entirely nurture. Once they're sent to the mine, I'd like to see who still isn't hardworking."

"Capturing and transporting slaves costs money! The price won't be low. Do we have the purchasing power?"

"Capture and transport is the English's business; we don't manage that," Wu De said. "As for payment, we pay with sugar and tea. Silver would work too, but we don't have much stockpiled."

"Why do we need slaves?" Ma Jia remained doubtful. "In terms of labor efficiency, slaves are far inferior to free workers. And if the death rate is too high, you constantly need to buy more—ongoing costs might not be any less than hiring laborers."

"When being used as consumables, slaves are obviously better than laborers." Wu De said. "Have you all read the report from Sanya?"

Ma Jia replied: "The incident has been resolved. Carrot and stick, all handled—by the way, I don't really approve of the decimation order. Long-term, it's inappropriate. Once development construction is complete, I propose establishing a formal court in Sanya rather than letting Wang Luobin proclaim the law at will, executing whoever he pleases. Natives' basic rights should still be guaranteed. Also, the Political Security General Administration's report says: current emotional status among laborers is blue. Importing slaves isn't necessary."

"This disturbance is just the beginning." Wu De said. "Tiandu development hasn't even reached the mining stage. When it does, death rates will rise again. Heavy manual labor, subtropical climate, mountains and forests—these three together will kill more people than the malaria outbreak. Mining development in such an environment means filling in with human lives."

"Manpower attrition, if controlled within certain parameters, is still acceptable." Ma Qianzhu flipped through his notebook. "I recall you submitted an attrition and replacement plan."

"Yes, but people have feelings; they're not numbers in a computer game." Wu De said. "Suppression is fine, but have you considered this? From recruitment to becoming usable, how much time and resources do we invest in a laborer? These people could be trained as industrial workers or soldiers—consuming them in low-skill physical labor like mining is too wasteful. Better to use slaves."

Wu De elaborated his thinking: laborers already in Sanya would gradually undergo training. Some would become technical workers and managers at the mine; others would be integrated into Sanya's industrial and agricultural enterprises. The hardest, most dangerous mining work would be left to Southeast Asian slaves.

"This approach has two benefits. First, it firmly places laborers in our hands—the labor force becomes our ruling foundation in Sanya, not a potential stability-maintenance population. Second, it avoids the drain of constantly shipping population to Sanya. Let the English deliver slaves directly there; we only need to ship sufficient sugar and other trade goods."

This reasoning moved the Executive Committee members. Ma Jia still disagreed but yielded: "I abstain on this issue, but I oppose a comprehensive restoration of slavery."

"That issue is for the Yuan Elder Council to decide." Wen Desi said. "Let's vote?"

Liu San gave Yang Shixiang a perfunctory verbal response about the pacification suggestion—not that he wasn't interested, but such matters were for the Yuan Elder Council.

He changed the subject, discussing the "Great Ming Watson's Chain Pharmacy" idea. Yang Shixiang was interested but worried about mainland branches. First, he feared unsettled times; second, branch pharmacies were difficult to manage, especially with Chinese patent medicines where quality couldn't be verified once processed.

"Don't worry about that. The troubles are in the north and west." Liu San said they'd focus on developing the Jiangnan market—it would remain relatively stable for twenty years.

"As for substituting inferior products, we can find solutions." Liu San pointed out that Li Luoyou's visit was an excellent opportunity—with his support, the matter could be accomplished with half the effort.

Yang Shixiang nodded. After partnering with Liu San, he'd become more willing to take risks.

"Good. Once the pharmaceutical factory starts construction, I'll personally survey Jiangnan."

"Good, I'll go with brother." Liu San had long wanted to see the Qizhou medicine market.

"But with your hair..." Yang Shixiang said. "Best if you could grow it out."

"I'll pose as a wandering monk. Just buy a tonsure certificate." Liu San had no intention of growing long hair.

"If you become a monk, what about my sister-in-law?" Yang Shixiang joked. "Since you'll be staying here a while, I'll have Xuanchun come to attend you."

Liu San wanted to refuse but couldn't bring himself to. In truth, he missed Xuanchun. Since that night of intimacy, her image had lingered in his mind.

"Matters of the heart are truly hard to understand," Liu San muttered, realizing he was falling for her.

Yang Shixiang then said: "Looks like we'll have to properly entertain Master Li tonight. I'll host the welcome dinner; brother, you arrange for tomorrow evening."

They discussed how to ensure Li Luoyou's satisfaction with meals. Liu San suggested: "Simple home-style dishes. When one's tired of delicacies, plain rice porridge and small dishes are more appetizing."

"Good, that's decided." Yang Shixiang then added, "Those Australian gadgets newly installed in the guest courtyard—I'd like help finding someone dedicated to their maintenance."

The East Guest Courtyard had been renovated by the Lingao Construction Company with bathing and sanitary facilities. The high-mounted water tank, water pipes, and heating furnace had cost substantially; the Executive Office subsidized half.

Yang Shixiang had requested similar renovation for his own residence. Besides the guest courtyard, a set was installed in Suochun Studio in the garden. Liu San noticed a double massage bathtub in the order and understood—Manager Yang wanted romantic shared baths.

Considering Mrs. Yang's recent displeasure, Liu San understood his sworn brother had probably committed the classic male vice of "extravagance and debauchery," likely getting his hands on household maids.

Just a few days after installation, Liu San had already had to find someone to unclog drains and fix faucets.

"Just train someone from your household; I'll arrange for him to learn." Liu San said, exasperated.

"Good, brother is too kind." In ancient thinking, free learning was practically charity.

Before returning to Bairren City, Liu San went to the agricultural station, instructing Fu Wuben to pack for Runshitang. He decided to use this opportunity to check his disciple's homework.

Liu San's education of Fu Wuben focused on medicine—having him memorize herbalism texts and the *Chinese Herbal Medicine Pharmacopoeia*. Beyond memorization, there was daily gardening work. With this disciple, the gardening required little attention, freeing Liu San to focus on new drug development.

Fu Wuben was happy for the chance at personal instruction. He packed early and waited at Bairren City's gate.

"Master."

"Let's go." Liu San's expression wasn't pleasant—he'd just had another quarrel with Wuyunhua.

Wuyunhua had always had a fierce temper. Liu San's guilty conscience made him evasive, which only increased her suspicions. Arguments had become frequent. Leading Operation Willow let him temporarily escape his domestic troubles. This gave him some relief.

Liu San walked with Fu Wuben toward the county town, questioning him on bookish knowledge. Beyond memorizing texts, Fu Wuben's daily tasks included gathering medicines throughout Lingao—training his identification ability while mapping the distribution of Chinese medicinal herbs.
