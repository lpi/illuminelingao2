# Chapter 772 – Conditions

Li Luoyou's business network and economic strength were far greater than that of scattered petty merchants, and his channels were broader than those of Gao Ju, who relied mainly on trafficking foreign goods. Not only was his supply volume large, but he also had significant price advantages. Consequently, *Qionghai House* soon became the largest mainland supplier in the Lingao commercial system. Gu Baocheng's role was largely just handling the money. However, Li Luoyou gave him considerable freedom in purchasing; of the monthly procurement budget for *Qionghai House* in Lingao, Gu Baocheng could decide half of it, choosing goods he believed would turn a profit on the mainland.

The encirclement campaign launched by the Guangdong authorities had interrupted *Qionghai House*'s business for a time. But not long after the Great Victory at Chengmai, Gu Baocheng—who had remained in Lingao—quickly resumed bilateral trade and made a tidy profit. This gave Li Luoyou some confidence in his management ability.

Li Luoyou placed great importance on the development of *Qionghai House*. The funds to open it came from his "private purse." Although his family possessed immense wealth, those were Li clan assets; Gu Baocheng was, after all, an outsider. To avoid clan gossip and to provide for Gu Baocheng should anything happen to himself—Li Luoyou needed to give his nephew a secure foundation. The clan eyed his existing assets, whether entities or shares, with hunger; even his own son might not inherit everything intact, let alone a nephew.

Now the Australians had fully demonstrated their capability and their resolve to defend themselves. From this perspective, present-day Lingao—and the future Qiongzhou Prefecture—might serve as a viable "retreat." Li Luoyou grew increasingly pessimistic about the situation in the Central Plains and the future of the Great Ming. The shadow of approaching chaos weighed heavily on him.

His trip to Lingao this time was partly to carry out Li Fengjie's negotiation mission and partly to put *Qionghai House* in order. If the world fell into chaos, this southern island might prove a sanctuary.

The carriage arrived at the entrance of *Qionghai House*. Two servants hurried out to take the horses. Because of the steps, the carriage had to stop outside; it couldn't be carried into the courtyard like a sedan chair. Li Luoyou made a mental note: *Remind Baocheng to renovate the entrance so carriages can enter.*

He had already instructed Gu Baocheng to buy a carriage from the Australians for his own use—as for the horses or mules, he would send them from the mainland.

"Nephew using such a vehicle... isn't it too ostentatious?" Gu Baocheng had been startled. The "Red Flag" carriages were rarely seen on Lingao's streets; even the Australian elders seldom used them. They didn't ride carriages or even sedan chairs—they either walked or rode "iron-wheelers." For a mere shop manager to parade around in one seemed inappropriate.

"It matters not," Li Luoyou said. "You are the manager of *Qionghai House* now; you must maintain the necessary appearance."

*Qionghai House* was located relatively far from the center of East Gate Market—in modern terms, on the outer ring. They had chosen the location for its cheap land and ample room for expansion. Moreover, *Qionghai House* focused on wholesale trade and didn't require a prime storefront.

Though the location was somewhat remote and the frontage modest, the renovation of the compound was extremely fastidious. It followed the traditional *Yingzao Fashi* (Building Standards) while incorporating many Australian comforts, such as glass windows, bathrooms with hot and cold water, and flush toilets. Li Luoyou particularly admired Australian sanitary equipment. In traditional residences, no matter how luxurious, the latrine was always a place one dreaded entering; no amount of expensive incense could fully mask the lingering stench.

A small garden had been built within *Qionghai House*—a "modern-style" classical garden designed by Li Xiaolü. It suited Li Luoyou's taste perfectly. After changing clothes, the two men sat in the garden's waterside pavilion to talk.

Li Luoyou had already reviewed the account books Gu Baocheng gave him. The books showed a large surplus of circulation notes, currently deposited in Delong Bank. Gu Baocheng proposed reducing exports to Lingao and increasing imports from Lingao to use up the bank deposits quickly.

He remained deeply skeptical of paper currency's creditworthiness—no matter what, it wasn't gold or silver; even copper coins felt more substantial.

Li Luoyou listened to his thoughts and pondered for a long while.

"There is no rush to use this surplus," Li Luoyou said. "You must have a plan—*Qionghai House* will be your property in the future; this is your domain. Think more about how to invest this money locally."

Gu Baocheng couldn't think of how to spend the money other than increasing stock—the *Qionghai House* premises were large enough, and he felt the land he had already stockpiled was sufficient: there were still large tracts of wasteland he had bought around the house growing vegetables. Although vegetables sold easily in Lingao, they weren't worth much. Spending huge sums on land just to let it bask in the sun seemed wasteful.

"It is not wasteful—has the value of the land you bought not risen?" Li Luoyou smiled. "The Australians are just beginning to exert their strength in Lingao; land prices will only rise, never fall."

He instructed Gu Baocheng to keep a portion of the circulation notes from sales on hand rather than converting everything into goods for the mainland. A portion of the retained cash should continue to be used to buy land—land prices in Lingao were rising faster than anywhere else in the Australian-controlled zone, especially near East Gate Market. This *jōkamachi* (castle town), originally intended for trade with natives outside Bairen City, was expanding so rapidly it threatened to swallow Bairen City itself. Many elders were already tired of living in Bairen City; it was too crowded and periodically plagued by industrial exhaust and noise.

"Uncle, though the price is rising, we can't sell it immediately—it's a market with prices but no buyers..."

"Naturally. There is still vacant land in the inner ring of East Gate Market, so land out here is hard to move. But when the inner ring is full? If you buy abundantly, land will become scarce. When demand exceeds supply, people will come to buy your land."

"Uncle teaches wisdom," Gu Baocheng said quickly.

As for the remaining money, it was to be saved for now, awaiting opportunity—though exactly how to use it, he hadn't decided.

"In addition, do more charity," Li Luoyou said. "Donate to the church—the Lingao church is a new parish. Though it has Jesuit help, it lacks roots and property. Father Wu runs a seminary and charities; his expenses must be high."

"Yes, Nephew donates a sum to the church every month..."

"And the various benevolent societies run by the Australians, and their schools—you must donate to them as well. The amount need not be large, but you must give to all of them. Do not miss any."

"Nephew understands."

Li Luoyou nodded. "It is easy to make money in Lingao. Therefore, one must cultivate good karma broadly to live here long and peacefully."

As they spoke, they heard that Australians had arrived to visit—Li Luoyou's spirits lifted: presumably the Senate had finally reached a conclusion on the negotiations. He had been in Lingao for over ten days, waiting for a formal audience to begin talks.

"Quickly, invite them in!" he ordered loudly. "Serve tea in the main hall!"

As the servant turned to go, he added, "Who has come?"

"Among them is Elder Liu. I do not recognize the others."

Elder Liu was Liu San. Liu San obviously hadn't come to negotiate—he was there to make the atmosphere more relaxed as a familiar face.

The person in charge of negotiations was Xu Tianqi of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The transmigrators' interests in Guangdong had already been specified in the *Treaty of Macau*; this negotiation was merely wrap-up work. Xu Tianqi's task was simply to inform Li Luoyou of the conditions discussed by the Senate and the Ministry.

Xu Tianqi was an acquaintance of Li Luoyou—back when they were first received, Xu Tianqi had been primarily responsible for negotiating with Kwak Chung.

After exchanging pleasantries, servants served tea. Xu Tianqi looked around and felt the main hall was too open for a confidential discussion.

Seeing him glance about, Li Luoyou knew he likely brought the negotiation terms and needed a private place. He immediately ordered the group to be led to his study—this was the deepest courtyard of *Qionghai House*, off-limits to ordinary servants and clerks other than Gu Baocheng.

The conditions Xu Tianqi presented on behalf of the House of Elders were:

The Guangdong authorities would tacitly consent to the Transmigrator Group occupying the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture and exercising control. In return:

The House of Elders guaranteed that the Great Ming's personnel appointments for Qiongzhou Prefecture and its subordinate counties could continue; in other words, the Great Ming could still appoint and remove officials in Qiongzhou as normal. At the same time, the House of Elders guaranteed the personal safety and property of these officials and their families.

The House of Elders guaranteed the full payment of the official tax quota for the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture—including the surcharges and additional levies from the Ministry of Revenue. However, provincial surcharges would not be paid.

Ming garrisons in Qiongzhou could remain, provided their presence was benign. The House of Elders guaranteed the personal safety and property of the Baisha Water Fortress, the Haikou Battalion, and Tang Yunwen himself and his subordinates.

Starting from the date the treaty was signed, the Australian-Song Navy would repatriate all civil and military officials and soldiers trapped in Qiongshan County to the mainland in batches. The drop-off point would be designated by Guangdong. Officers and soldiers of the Baisha Water Fortress, Haikou, and other local Qiongzhou garrisons would return to their respective units; the Fubo Army would not impede them.

Repatriated personnel could carry weapons, baggage, banners, and ten days' rations. They were not permitted to carry gunpowder, cannons, livestock, or fodder. Officers of guerrilla rank and above could bring their own horses. Everyone, officer or soldier, could bring their private property—limited to ten kilograms. Abandoned government vessels belonging to the Baisha Water Fortress would be returned; all other vessels would be confiscated.
