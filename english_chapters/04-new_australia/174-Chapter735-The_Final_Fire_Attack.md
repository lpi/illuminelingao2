# Chapter 735 - The Final Fire Attack

To intensify the fire, the ships were piled with barrels of sulfur and gunpowder, along with so-called toxic smoke-producing herbs. Xu Tingfa estimated that with so many fire ships and rafts attacking simultaneously, the bandits couldn't withstand it even with powerful cannons. Burning just one-third of the bandit ships would disrupt their defense. Xu Tingfa gathered the remaining naval war-junks and forty-some commandeered rice and salt boats serving as auxiliary warships, preparing to charge into the enemy formation amidst the chaos of a successful fire attack, letting water-braves board and slaughter. Li Fengjie offered unprecedented rewards: one tael for killing a Fake Bandit, fifty taels for a True Bandit. Fifty taels for burning a small bandit ship, one hundred for a large one; two hundred taels for capturing a bandit ship.

While the Fubo Army was delayed at Ershawei clearing remnants on Henan Island, Xu Tingfa ordered Chen Qian to lead the fire ship squadron slowly down the Provincial River, with himself leading the main fleet in the rear.

"You brat deserted twice; this is your chance to earn merit and atonement!" Before departure, Xu Tingfa told Chen Qian fiercely. "The Governor has authorized me to act as I see fit—you watch yourself!"

Chen Qian cursed inwardly at Xu Tingfa—who ran faster than a rabbit himself but now used him as cannon fodder vanguard. But he dared not disobey; everyone knew Governor Li was red-eyed with desperation. Another defeat meant heads would genuinely roll.

"This general will surely lead bravely!" Chen Qian said insincerely.

"Save official talk for later," Xu Tingfa grunted viciously. "If the bandits enter Bai'etan and fire three or four shots at the Provincial Capital, both our heads will move! Of course, yours goes first!"

"This general knows." Chen Qian bowed respectfully with clasped hands. Sweat poured down. Officers were masters of buck-passing, but now he couldn't pass this buck. His defense sector was Humen; having fled all the way to Guangzhou, if the Governor wanted a scapegoat for execution, he was the perfect candidate.

But as for leading bravely—he truly lacked the guts. Chen Qian saw clearly: attempting face-to-face combat with the bandits on the water was suicide.

But with Li Fengjie and others pressing down, he had to go even to his death. Helpless, Chen Qian chose two fast, maneuverable "Long Dragons" as his command ships and handpicked dozens of water-skilled personal guards good at boat handling. He planned to dodge aside as soon as the fire ships went in, then decide based on the situation.

Night fell.

The Task Force anchored at Ershawei lowered its flags and entered night rest mode. Sentries lit bonfires on the abandoned Ershawei forts. They watched the river vigilantly—officers on land had sent out long-range patrols, specially trained to spot human silhouettes in pitch darkness. Any attempt to attack the fleet from land was impossible.

Danger came from the water. Despite thorough arrangements—large ships in the core, small boats on the perimeter as fixed sentries, plus patrol boats for constant night patrol—in such narrow waters unfavorable for maneuvering, room for error was small in a sneak attack.

Night commander Le Lin sat in a chair on the fort, wrapped in a thick military wool cloak—made from fabric bought from the Portuguese, warm and waterproof, one of the preparations for the future continental campaign. Armies and sailors couldn't operate in tropical/subtropical zones forever.

Le Lin wrapped the cloak tight. As a Hong Konger, he'd never felt Guangdong nights this cold in the old timeline—even Christmas in Lan Kwai Fong required at most a jacket. Yet here, even wearing his British Navy-style sweater, he felt the chill biting. Damp cold penetrated everywhere.

"Why is this Little Ice Age so cold—" he muttered, occasionally lifting his Russian-made infrared binoculars to scan the surroundings to pass boring time.

Sun Tianbiao cursed secretly. Since fleeing the Lingao Wei post by night to report the emergency at Haikou Battalion, he'd been kicked around like a ball—Haikou, Zhaoqing, Guangzhou, Haikou—involved in everything related to "Bandits." In the rout at Chengmai, he jumped into the water to escape, finding a fishing boat to cross back to the mainland. After a hard journey to Zhaoqing, he was almost taken for a beggar. Governor-General Wang asked a few questions with a bad expression, then nothing followed. Sun Tianbiao had scraped by in the Governor-General’s guard for a few days before being kicked to Guangzhou "for assignment."

Finally, he managed to fill a vacancy in the Humen Navy—commanding no troops, just drawing a salary. And he had to drill and patrol occasionally. How could this compare to his comfortable life as a landlord master at the Wei post?

Not only that, this time he was assigned the lead in the fire ship attack—supposedly because he was familiar with bandit affairs. Forced, Sun Tianbiao boarded the first wave of ten ships, hiding in the hold, calculating when to jump and flee. In his heart, he cursed Chen Qian’s eighteen generations of ancestors.

Seeing the shadowy silhouettes of the bandit fleet appearing in distance. Sun Tianbiao’s heart jumped to his throat. Others might not know, but he was well aware of the "legends" about the bandits. Besides powerful firearms, there were legends of "Thousand-League Eyes" that could see at night. Sun Tianbiao intended to report this to Commander Chen Qian, but the man wouldn't even see him, just told him to "advance bravely."

"Bravely to death?" Sun Tianbiao muttered, then cursed, "Row slower! Too much water noise!"

The ships needed almost no power, drifting slowly downstream with the current. Sun Tianbiao relaxed slightly—this way, everyone could jump ship far away, no need to row until ramming distance. Before his thought finished, the river surface lit up brilliantly. For a moment he couldn't open his eyes—amidst his surprise, a powerful beam of light projected from the bandit fleet, illuminating the entire fire ship squadron.

What projected was just a medium-power stage spotlight, but enough to light up the attacking fire ship squadron clearly on the water.

"Ignite!"

"Open fire!"

Orders came almost simultaneously from the fort and fire ships.

Bandit cannons roared instantly, interspersed with continuous sharp screeches like tearing cloth. Shells and lead bullets flew in succession, landing among the fleet. Several fire rafts were sunk by waves before they could ignite. A fire ship suddenly shuddered violently, wood chips flying as if whipped by an invisible lash. The sailors on board twitched, jumped, and fell into the water.

A shell screamed in, directly hitting a fire ship. The fuel-laden vessel instantly turned into a sea of fire. Sun Tianbiao even thought he heard sailors screaming.

Sun Tianbiao quickly grabbed a tinder pot and smashed it into the fore-hold already sprinkled with gunpowder. Flames whooshed up. Without a word, he rolled over the side into the water. Others on the ship jumped too.

Ignition was the order. Ship after ship lit up. The first wave of over a dozen fire ships drifted downstream toward the Task Force at Ershawei.

"Steady, brothers!" Chen Qian in the rear hadn't expected the bandits to have such a trick, producing such immense light out of thin air in the dark night. Now sneak attack was impossible. To escape safely, the only way was to light all ships and rafts immediately and let them drift down in a swarm, hoping to catch the bandits off guard and hit a few ships by blind luck.

However, this distance was indeed too far! Chen Qian thought—drifting like this, the bandits would run long before impact. In normal times, everyone would just light up and run. But this time no shirking was allowed. Chen Qian commanded remaining ships to row faster and charge, forbidding ignition before reaching enemy ships.

"Anyone igniting unauthorized or abandoning ship will be beheaded!" He shouted, waving his saber on his command ship. "Charge! The bandits have few guns! Those hit are unlucky; those missed will have riches!"

The fire ship pilots were desperadoes. Shouted at, with eyes only for silver, seeing shells falling among Sun Tianbiao’s vanguard, they buried their heads and rowed desperately toward the fleet.

Three minutes after Le Lin ordered fire, the fleet's main commanders rushed to the deck. Chen Haiyang raised binoculars; burning ships were everywhere on the distant river. Enemy fire attack! Special Service Boats on the outer perimeter were firing furiously with cannons and Typewriters. Searchlights swept back and forth across the river. Chen Haiyang estimated the distance and felt slightly relieved—the nearest firelight was still about 2 kilometers from the fleet perimeter. According to known Ming army and pirate tactics, once lit, ships were unmanned, relying on current and wind—given current river speed, it would take at least 30 minutes to drift to the anchorage.

At this speed, many fire ships would likely burn and sink before reaching the anchorage. Not to mention cannons and Typewriters were constantly shooting at them.

"Tell Le Lin to proceed with the anti-fire–ship contingency plan," Chen Haiyang ordered. "Strengthen observation! The enemy may have unlit ships moving in the dark!"

Ships raised anchor chains. Sailors manned stations. Especially Typewriter gunners—they quickly removed oilcloth covers, loaded drum magazines, and rotated gun mounts, watching the dark water.

Sun Tianbiao’s vanguard was blasted to pieces by cannons and Typewriters, turning into burning wreckage drifting, swirling, and sinking. The following fire ships passed through the wreckage, continuing their "special attack" with a rare bravery.

Several small steam launches, kept under steam, rushed from the anchorage, moving forward hundreds of meters to sweep the following fire ships with Typewriters. Dense bullets swept the decks, tearing sailors apart. Lead fire ships lost control and slowed; some turned sideways and collided with ships behind them.

Chen Qian saw the vanguard intercepted again by Australians and knew breaking the blockade was hopeless. Hateful, he ordered ignition. Over thirty fire ships and nearly a hundred fire rafts ignited together. For a moment, flames soared on the water, a spectacular sight.

These fire ships and rafts drifted slowly downstream. Being slow and unmanned, several collided and sank en route; others clustered and burned out prematurely on the water. The remainder, approaching within 500 meters, were hooked one by one to the riverbank by Marines on sampans with long iron hooks, left to burn out.

Xu Tingfa saw the river filled with firelight and thought they succeeded. He immediately led 40 war-junks downstream, planning to attack with the momentum. Unexpectedly, before getting close, they were hit by fierce fire from Special Service Boats. The lead three war-junks immediately caught fire. Xu Tingfa steeled himself and ordered a fierce attack, placing dozens of fifty-tael silver ingots on the deck, waving his sword and shouting: "Advancers, rewarded! Retreaters, beheaded!"

While shouting to charge "to repay Court favor," someone brought the dripping wet Sun Tianbiao before him.

"General—the bandits' firepower ahead is fierce; ships cannot pass..."

Sun Tianbiao hadn't finished when Xu Tingfa immediately shouted: "Drag him down, behead him!"

Guards immediately dragged the stunned Sun Tianbiao to the prow and chopped off his head with one stroke. They presented the bloody head.

"Hang it on the mast!" Xu Tingfa shouted. "Anyone daring to flee faces this end!"

The troops trembled. Shouting war cries, they fired firearms toward Ershawei indiscriminately—Two Dragons Out of Water, One-Nest-of-Bees, Fire Doves. Regardless of range, they fired everything—spectacular indeed. Missing the bandits, they accidentally injured many sailors who had jumped from fire ships.

"You bastard... look before you shoot..." A water-brave, hit by a rocket for no reason, cursed and sank.

"Attention! Enemy range 430 meters. Solid shot, one round load!" Gunners on Special Service Boats shouted while observing.

Xu Tingfa’s final general offensive lasted until midnight. The river was filled with firelight, gunfire, screams, curses, and cries for help. As the night deepened, more ships caught fire. Finally, the Ming army's last counterattack was declared bankrupt. Xu Tingfa narrowly escaped, swimming ashore with guards to flee. Chen Qian fled into the West River with his command ship. of the 40 participating war-junks, except 4 that fled during battle, all were lost. At dawn, the exhausted Le Lin and others saw only floating corpses and broken ship wreckage emitting wisps of smoke filling the river.

The Army Task Force lost 5 sampans and 1 Long Dragon in this night battle. One steam launch was hit in the boiler by a cannonball, causing an explosion that killed 2 sailors and heavily damaged the launch—the Navy's most serious loss. Several other ships were hit but remained combat-capable. Total casualties were 3 dead, 14 wounded. Ming losses were unaccountable; few prisoners were taken in the dark, and many swam away. But local villagers fished five or six hundred corpses from the water after the battle.

On November 3, 1630 (Western Calendar), as the thin mist over Bai'etan just dispersed, the Australian-Song Fubo Army Pearl River Task Force sailed into Bai'etan.

Iron chains rattled as anchors were dropped into Bai'etan's green waves. Black cannon muzzles pointed straight at Guangzhou City.

Guangzhou's city gates were tightly shut—news of Xu Tingfa's failed counterattack had long been brought back by fleeing soldiers. The gates, usually open early, were exceptionably unopened.

Guangzhou Prefect Yu Baocun watched from the city wall. Seeing the fleet arrive, he quickly descended and entered his sedan chair.

"Quick! To the Governor's Yamen!"

Li Fengjie was completely out of plans. Xu Tingfa's counterattack failed; he didn't even know where the man was. Forts along the way were useless. Of five thousand hired water-braves, between death and desertion, less than two thousand remained. And the *Folangji* (Portuguese) people he pinned high hopes on showed no intention of sending warships to cut the bandits' rear. According to Li Luoyou's letter, the *Folangji* seemed to definitely know about Gao Shunqin demanding to close the border and expel them—let alone "borrowing troops to help," not taking the opportunity to loot was already due to Li Luoyou's great effort.

Though the letter didn't say explicitly, the implication was obvious: make peace with the bandits quickly to avoid greater blows.

Peace, peace. Li Fengjie was half dejected, half angry. He had wanted to negotiate peace originally, but miscalculated, hoping to save some face before contacting the Australians. Now not only was face gone, but the lining was almost stripped too. Now the bandit fleet was anchored in Bai'etan, ready to shell Guangzhou anytime—putting him in a dilemma.

Seeking peace would inevitably invite attacks from many, especially Gao Shunqin, who held extreme hostility toward all overseas people. Heaven knew how he would impeach to the Court.

If they fought, there was absolutely no assurance of victory—even if the bandits didn't take Guangzhou, losing his post after this turmoil was a certainty. If the bandits breached the city, even his life wouldn't be guaranteed.

Thinking of this, his brows knit tight. He sighed continuously.

He Chengzong whispered: "Your Excellency, the only way now is to quickly negotiate terms, getting the bandit navy to withdraw from Bai'etan. If days drag on, we cannot answer for it!"

"We already cannot answer for it now!" Li Fengjie grumbled.

"Your Excellency, right now we can still find a story to cope. If the bandits really start fighting outside Guangzhou city, there really won't be any story left!"
