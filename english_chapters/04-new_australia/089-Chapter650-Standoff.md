# Chapter 650 Standoff

"Double canister shot! Fire!" Following the artillery officer's command, two 12-pounder mountain howitzers fired simultaneously amidst the rifle volleys. A storm of projectiles swept across the entire enemy column, and this charge collapsed without any suspense.

Sha Jianbi led the Central Army to attack the 1st Infantry Battalion fiercely twice more, but was beaten back each time. Seeing his own main force's ranks gradually falling into chaos—many soldiers unwilling to crash into the Hair Bandits' gun muzzles again, disobeying officers' orders, some even drawing knives—he realized the situation was hopeless. An Assistant General of his who wanted to reorganize the troops was dragged off his horse and killed.

He gasped for breath, feeling that nothing could be done. At present, the only way was to retreat troops quickly to a safe place to wait for the arrival of follow-up forces, combining forces before making plans. Immediately he ordered conch shells blown, letting all units retreat slightly to assemble.

Just as he was about to retreat, Zhu Mingxia, who had been waiting for the opportunity, immediately ordered the 4th Battalion lurking behind the mountain to repeat the old trick, charging out suddenly to sweep the government army's flank directly.

The army, whose morale was already wavering, was suddenly attacked by such a fresh force. Many people turned and ran after slight resistance. This kind of flight was contagious; the organized and orderly retreat of officers and soldiers terminated, followed by total chaos, scrambling to escape and trampling each other. The fleeing soldiers not only left behind flags and weapons but even threw away helmets completely.

Sha Jianbi beheaded several soldiers in a row but still couldn't stop the terrible situation of total collapse. He had to stop caring about the lives of his subordinate officers and soldiers, and had no time to consider issues like punishment for losing the army. He fled in panic with dozens of personal soldiers.

The speed of the government soldiers' flight was very fast, so much so that the 4th Infantry Battalion could hardly encircle them; they only intercepted a portion of the government soldiers. High-pitch speakers constantly shouted "Those who surrender will be spared." Many people were exhausted and could only drop weapons and kneel on the ground to surrender.

Zhu Mingxia personally led the troops to pursue for two or three kilometers, capturing several hundred more exhausted soldiers and seizing many materials and weapons, before stopping the pursuit. He gathered the troops quickly.

"Beat the assembly drum! Gather the troops."

The drummers quickly stood in a row and began to beat the drums. After ten minutes or so, the originally dispersed troops began to gather towards the army flag direction from all sides.

The Special Reconnaissance Team was already issuing warnings to him: the enemy's follow-up men and horses were not far from him.

He pondered for a moment. The enemy's follow-up troops were arriving—according to the Special Reconnaissance Team's report, there were also two thousand men. If continuing the defensive counterattack mode just now, soldiers had been fighting continuously for almost a day since morning; physical strength and ammunition consumption were huge. Fighting another battle might not be as easy as the previous two times. Moreover, under Shishan, the battlefield was being cleaned and captives captured; once government soldiers committed fresh forces, these things would all be interrupted.

Considering this, he made a prompt decision: decide to lead the 4th Battalion directly to meet the reinforcement troops, tailing the routed soldiers to pursue, using the routed soldiers to disrupt the reinforcement troops, and then throwing into battle directly to rout their whole army.

Seeing the troops assembled, he called Xiong Maozhang via walkie-talkie:

"I'm going to meet the follow-up troops; you hurry up and take people to grab captives and clean the battlefield!"

Saying so, he immediately led the whole battalion, shouting and chasing fiercely in the direction of Sha Jianbi's rout on the post road.

Sha Jianbi took the routed soldiers withdrawing more than ten *li*. Originally thinking the enemy had stopped pursuing, he was about to gather men and horses to join Li Guang's reinforcement army. At this time, he heard another burst of killing shouts from the rear unit, especially the unique bugle and snare drum sounds of Hair Bandits among them. He knew if he ran again at this time, not only would his own whole army be annihilated, but even Li Guang's two thousand men would be disrupted by his defeated army. He immediately ordered people to erect his big flag on a small hill beside the post road, personally leading house guards and personal soldiers to gather troops.

But the sound of guns and cannons in the rear unit was constantly approaching. Officers and soldiers with no will to fight were unwilling to continue fighting, fleeing downwards one after another. Sha Jianbi beheaded several fleeing soldiers in a row but still couldn't stop the rout. While helpless, he saw Cao Xiangjiao retreating from behind covered in blood. His Vanguard Battalion Garrison Commander post didn't last long before his men and horses all dispersed. Relying on the desperate rescue of a few personal soldiers, he escaped from the paddy field with difficulty. Just now he managed to gather some men and horses on the road with great difficulty, intending to turn back to resist upon hearing enemy pursuit sounds, but was quickly routed. Cao Xiangjiao was wounded by a bullet, struggling to escape here with difficulty.

"General, go quickly!" Cao Xiangjiao shouted, "Hair Bandits caught up again! Humble General will resist here for a while!" Saying so, he shouted and waved his saber to turn back again.

Sha Jianbi wanted to support for a while longer, but the officers and soldiers around him were already in chaos. Ignoring whether he gave the order or not, they clustered around him directly fleeing backward.

Cao Xiangjiao stood on the post road with his personal soldiers for a while, watching defeat troops surging past him like a tide. Until there were no more men and horses on the road. Only then did he lead his few personal soldiers to throw away the flag and flee into the small woods by the roadside.

Zhu Mingxia's pursuit made it impossible for the government army's routed troops to stop and reorganize. Routing like this for seven or eight *li*, they also crashed through all of Li Guang's two thousand men. Li Guang attempted to gather men but was also wrapped by chaotic soldiers retreating towards Chengmai direction. Zhu Mingxia led troops chasing closely. Chasing out another five or six *li*, capturing large numbers of captives.

In the series of battles surrounding Shishan, government soldiers suffered heavy losses, not only losing large amounts of weapons and horses, but of the seven thousand men reinforcing Shishan three times in succession, less than three thousand returned. Those who didn't return were either corpses on the battlefield or captured by Hair Bandits. A Regional Commander was also lost. This completely bankrupted the statement "Hair Bandits are not good at field battles" originally unanimous among generals and private secretaries. Large numbers of routed soldiers escaping back to the camp caused morale in the Chengmai stockade to drop to rock bottom. Many generals and officers were already packing things, preparing to flee. The camp was full of noises of chaos. He Rubin and Zhao Ruyi racked their brains, sending people to comfort and suppress, and containing all defeated soldiers separately into a battalion to avoid them spreading rumors everywhere.

Ye Zhengfang, responsible for suppression, beheaded more than twenty soldiers and low-ranking officers agitating for flight in various camps. He Rubin's Regional Commander's Standard and house guards remained intact and calm, finally settling the once chaotic atmosphere of the Grand Camp.

He Rubin gathered all main generals of the army into the big tent for a meeting to discuss countermeasures. Some generals advocated withdrawing the whole army east immediately, rushing a path from Shishan back to Qiongshan to camp and rest; some advocated confronting on the spot, sending men and horses to attack Shishan again tomorrow. Sha Jianbi believed Hair Bandit troop strength was insufficient. Those defending Shishan were actually no more than two thousand; if dispatching five thousand to attack at once, while ordering the stay-behind troops in Qiongshan to attack from front and rear, Hair Bandits could totally be forced to abandon Shishan.

But everyone didn't approve of this arithmetic, because seven thousand people were sent out today in total, yet still beaten into a disastrous defeat. What use would dispatching another five thousand be?

"Today our army committed the taboo of underestimating the enemy." He Rubin said, "General Yan, General Sha, and General Li's units were thrown into the battlefield in three batches. Each time our army did not occupy superiority. The enemy army defended the stockade to the death with firearms, waiting at ease for the fatigued enemy. Our army attacked with hungry and tired soldiers after a long march; originally lacking ability to do what the heart wished, hence inability to break the enemy."

He Rubin's judgment of the battlefield situation was still accurate. He realized very clearly that because of momentary impatience, he committed the mistake of "Fueling Tactics." He was unwilling to withdraw troops just like this. Once retreating to Qiongshan, Hair Bandits making a comeback would surely capture Chengmai. Losing army and territory, losing a Great General, the consequences were unimaginable.

So he strongly advocated holding fast locally, continuing to send heavy troops to open up communication with Qiongshan. He estimated Hair Bandit troops and provisions were limited and couldn't divide forces for long. As long as both sides remained in a stalemate, Hair Bandits would inevitably retreat from Shishan.

Inventorying provisions, there were still more than ten days' grain storage in the army. Plus quite a bit of storage in the Chengmai County granary, calculating generally, the whole army could still support for half a month.

"Only this provision..." Zhao Ruyi asked somewhat skeptically. Half a month's grain reserve couldn't make people reassured no matter what.

"Within three to five days, first strive fully to open the grain route!" He Rubin said, "When necessary, transport grain from the sea route again!"

"Hair Bandit navy is formidable; I fear it won't go as wished."

"This is a strategy prepared but not used." He Rubin said, calling out:

"General Tang!"

Tang Yunwen knew this "good errand" would inevitably fall on his head, immediately standing out to answer: "Humble General is here!"

"Transporting grain from Qiongshan by navy, do you have certainty?"

Tang Yunwen dared not say "no certainty," having to say: "This matter can be done, but the ships of Humble General's unit, expenses for ship repair over the years have never been sufficient, usable ships are also few..."

"There are sealed merchant ships and fishing boats in Haikou; you can commandeer all of them."

"Yes!" Tang Yunwen said, "Please give Commander's arrow token immediately, Marshal. Humble General will send people back to handle it immediately."

He Rubin said: "No, you go back to handle it personally. I give you ten days. Grain and fodder must be delivered! Otherwise don't blame this Regional Commander for naming you for severe impeachment!"

"Yes, Humble General will surely not disgrace the mission!" Tang Yunwen was both happy and worried. Happy that he broke away from this desperate place certain to be defeated—unlike other generals and private secretaries, he fully knew the strength of Hair Bandit military power; the government army would surely be defeated this time. Worried that although supplying grain by sea was not absolutely impossible, whether it could be supplied within ten days was uncertain. Once the government army suffered a great defeat, his failure to supply grain on time would become He Rubin's excuse to shirk responsibility. At that time, even a hundred mouths couldn't explain clearly.

That night, Tang Yunwen took his few close followers to board a fishing boat quietly at Xiaoyingchang, leaving quietly along the coastline under the cover of night, going towards Qiongshan. His men and horses were led by White Sand Stockade Chiliarch Chen Renjie.

To receive grain and fodder from the sea, He Rubin decided to reoccupy Xiaoyingchang. This time officers and soldiers fully learned the lesson, not only sending two thousand men and horses but also reinforcing with many firearms, preparing to defend to the death.

In the following two or three days, the government army silenced flags and drums, not exiting the stockade to fight. He Rubin only urged generals to constantly repair stockades and dig ditches, reorganizing ranks. Preparing to personally lead the heavy troop group with Regional Commander's Standard and house guards as main force after resting for a few days like this, to rout the Hair Bandit whole army at Shishan in one fell swoop, retake Shishan, and rebuild the grain route.

Inside the camp was busy with a solemn atmosphere. A courtyard inside Chengmai County seat presented another scene. This was the stockade of the county's richest family; the owner was surnamed Song, also having a status of Imperial Academy Student (Jiansheng). During the Hair Bandit siege of Chengmai this time, he exerted the most effort in defending the city. Once the government army came, he also flattered greatly, taking out a part of his private residence for high officials in the army to live. Because generals needed to control the army and effectively express the meaning of "sharing weal and woe" with officers and soldiers, only civil officials and private secretaries moved in. Student Song also treated this group of private secretaries as a "protective talisman," entertaining and supplying very diligently.

At this time Chang Qingyun, Qian Taichong, and a dozen private secretaries who usually communicated well were drinking tea and enjoying the connect in the garden of this residence accompanied by the residence owner Song Zonghui. This Master Student was quite elegant and had some money; the residence also had some embellishment of springs and stones, possessing a little beauty of gardens, which was very rare in this southern frontier land.

Because they were attending military affairs, private secretaries dared not summon prostitutes to accompany wine openly, just setting up a few tables in the garden, placing some tea, fruits, and dim sum, chatting idly under the moonlight.

Because the war was unfavorable—losing several great generals in a row, grain route cut off again—the situation of the whole army was very dangerous. Except for a few who could still drink and eat freely, joking as usual, most private secretaries were worried. The optimistic atmosphere from Qiongshan times was swept away.

Quite a few people realized that this campaign against Hair Bandits was lost, only no one dared to say so openly. Also some people still unwilling to admit Hair Bandit abilities were limited to "strange techniques and craftiness." Even if the Fubo Army defeated three government army units continuously at Shishan in field battles, they considered it purely due to objective factors like "Shishan is strategically perilous." As for whether Shishan was "perilous" and how the battles were fought, they were totally uninterested.

Qian Taichong was much more pragmatic than these people. He had been listening to military councils in the big tent recently and had personally visited low-ranking officers who participated in battles, learning many first-hand materials from their mouths. He knew Hair Bandits were not only pure and skilled in firearms but also neat in ranks and strict in discipline; fighting battles was not inferior to government soldiers at all. He felt this was a great enemy, because in the past, sea lords and bandits here in Guangdong never had such men and horses. Hair Bandits were a bit like Franks (Portuguese), but whether Franks or Red-haired people (Dutch), they couldn't concentrate so many troops to unfold offensive and defensive field battles with the Imperial Court's Grand Army.

At this moment he grabbed Gou Chengxuan continuously, asking him to talk about Hair Bandit matters. Especially Hair Bandit firearms, which Qian Taichong and others cared about relatively more. Gou Chengxuan had to tell what he knew one by one. Especially bird guns and cannons used by Hair Bandits; because the era gap was too big, they couldn't help but leave an extremely impactful feeling on Qian Taichong and others.

"So, most Hair Bandit firearms are made in Lingao?" Qian Taichong asked seriously.

"Exactly." Gou Chengxuan nodded, "Cannons, bird guns, powder, and bullets, none are not."

"The Imperial Court using Red Barbarian Cannons made by Westerners since the Tianqi reign are also sharp weapons of the military and state. I didn't expect Hair Bandit cannons could actually improve to such a degree." A private secretary sighed, "Bullets exploding to injure people, Little Brother has seen in *Wubei Zhi* (Treatise on Armament Technology), not considered rare. Just this bullet capable of exploding in the air is truly unheard of since ancient times."

"Whether those so-called Heaven-Shaking Thunderbolt Fierce Fire Cannons in *Wubei Zhi* work or not, only Heaven knows." Qian Taichong sniffed at it, "Haven't seen them for a long time except made by the Armament Bureau during the Jiajing reign."

"Little Brother thinks this kind of blossoming cannon is nothing more than the Song/Yuan 'Fierce Fire Oil Cabinet', the meaning of 'Ten Thousand Men Enemy' of our dynasty. Only trebuchets were used back then, cannons are used now." Chang Qingyun was considered understanding firearms, supplementing immediately, "If discussing Western cannon making, it's nothing more than the vestige of Great Song's Fire Lance..."

"'Nothing more', 'That is all', said again and again, but in the end still strictly need Westerners to help build cannons!" Qian Taichong slapped the table excitedly, "Now Hair Bandit guns, cannons, and firearms go up another story compared to Westerners. People like us can only sigh in vain!"

Everyone felt it was very abrupt, wondering why this Cultivated Talent was so excited. Qian Taichong probably also felt he lost composure somewhat, drinking a mouthful of tea and falling silent.

An older private secretary said: "Although Hair Bandit firearms are sharp, they possess no more than one county's land, not enough to be a worry. The most worrying thing is that the Fake Hairs under them are actually willing to go through fire and water for them, risking dangers of sharp edges and arrows. Such art of confusing people's hearts is the great scourge of the Imperial Court."

Presently everyone lamented with words like "Mean people chase profit" and "Public morals are degenerating daily" for a while.

Qian Taichong said in a firm tone: "However, current accumulated abuses are more than just these few ends! In Little Brother's humble opinion, I still think rather than seeking treatment for minor details, it is better to treat the root. The so-called root is 'Education'..."

He spoke with spittle flying for a long time, arising a burst of discussion among private secretaries. Some talked about "Qi" and "Heart," others talked about Wang Yangming's "School of Mind." Just as they chatted enthusiastically, suddenly a burst of desolate horn sound came from outside the county seat, shaking the firmament. Interrupting their discussion. Everyone realized that them discussing these at this time was not only ridiculous but also absurd.

Chang Qingyun turned back to talk about his method of "Water Mine Defeating Enemies" again. In his view, whatever fast ships and iron ships of Hair Bandits would vanish in puff of smoke upon encountering the "Mud Dragon" he advocated strongly. Once Hair Bandit navy broke, the grain route could be opened immediately.

"That place Shishan, let Hair Bandits occupy if they want. When those tens of thousands of *jin* of grain are exhausted, these three thousand men and horses of Hair Bandits will be an isolated army, falling into chaos without fighting." Chang Qingyun spoke with spittle flying.

Everyone knew his so-called Water Mine Battalion had somewhat fanciful components. It might have been useful when besieging Bopu; now Hair Bandit ships only anchored near the shore, let alone the current water flow was opposite. Everyone ignored him. Only Qian Taichong sneered:

"Once the sea grain route opens, I fear countless will drift away (be embezzled) again. At that time, if fifty or sixty percent of money and grain can reach Chengmai, it would be good." He said, "Little Brother thinks it's still the best strategy to open the [land] grain route."

"Yes, if the grain route cannot be opened, grain in the city is little; I fear it won't support for many days." Song Zonghui finally found a chance to interrupt. He was different from this group of private secretaries; his whole family and property were in Chengmai. The success or failure of government soldiers suppressing Hair Bandits directly related to his family property and personal safety; he couldn't help but care.
