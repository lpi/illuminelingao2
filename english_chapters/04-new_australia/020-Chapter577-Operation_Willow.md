# Chapter 577 - Operation Willow

Saoye had never encountered officials who refused money. The shock left him so stunned that he forgot to signal the sedan chair bearers to resume. Advisor Han quickly issued the order, and only then did the party finally set off again.

Once the sedan chair passed through the city gates, the county town revealed few overt traces of Australian presence. Yet a discerning eye could detect their handiwork everywhere: the main street had been freshly paved and leveled, and drainage channels were still being dug along both sides.

What surprised Li Luoyou most was the remarkable cleanliness. Not only were there no stagnant muddy pools or scattered garbage, but even the usual urine and excrement that accumulated in wall corners—unavoidable even in Guangzhou—were entirely absent. To find such standards in a remote backwater like Lingao was extraordinary.

The shops lining the street were few—a handful of general stores, teahouses, and the like. Though modest in size, their frontages were neat and spotless. Li Luoyou could tell these buildings had been recently renovated: walls not merely whitewashed but brickwork properly repaired.

The county town seemed rather deserted, yet the atmosphere was peaceful and calm. Li Luoyou found himself wondering: how did Lingao's county magistrate coexist with these Australians? Could he truly be cowering in his yamen, playing deaf and dumb? Such composure would be quite impressive.

Lingao's county town was small. After barely two or three hundred paces, the sedan chair turned onto a cross street and arrived at Runshitang's premises. Rather than entering through the main gate, it turned the corner through a side entrance and was carried directly to the second reception hall, where stewards and servants stood waiting.

The carrying poles were removed, the armrests taken down, and Saoye hurried forward to lift the sedan curtain.

"Greetings to Master." The receiving stewards and servants immediately kowtowed.

Li Luoyou observed that Runshitang was quite substantial, and the servants conducted themselves with the proper manner of a great household. This pleased him somewhat. The complete absence of hierarchy among the Australians' staff had irritated him greatly.

Li Luoyou's arrival had already been reported to the Executive Committee by Liu San. This merchant's basic information had been added to the intelligence department's files after Liu San's visit to Foshan, later upgraded in priority due to his large-scale iron purchases across Guangdong. However, Li Luoyou's file remained fairly sparse. Beyond the stations in Guangzhou and Leizhou, the transmigrator collective had no intelligence sources on the mainland.

After the External Intelligence Bureau was established, they conducted supplementary investigations of important native figures whose files dated from the Intelligence Committee era. Li Luoyou was among them. The Guangzhou Station collected considerable material about him from various public sources, and gradually his profile came into focus.

The External Intelligence Bureau didn't know the precise depth of Li Luoyou's relationship with the Later Jin, but they knew at minimum that he maintained trade relations with Later Jin-controlled territories—and that these relations were far from superficial.

"Consider, everyone, what does this Li Luoyou sell?" Yu Eshui said. "Liaodong goods. Especially ginseng. Anyone who can trade ginseng must have influence within the Later Jin regime."

After Nurhachi raised his banner, the Later Jin placed extreme importance on ginseng as a medicinal material, even establishing a special official—the *Wor-huo-da Zhang-jing*—specifically to manage ginseng collection, storage, and sales. It was their primary export for purchasing goods from within the passes, its importance comparable to oil for Gulf states.

For Li Luoyou to trade ginseng, he must not only possess certain connections within the Later Jin but also be colluding with military families at the various Liaodong border garrisons. Otherwise, with the court's ban on Liaodong trade, he could not possibly transport goods back and forth over such vast distances.

In other words, gaining Li Luoyou's cooperation would be equivalent to opening a Hainan-Liaodong trade route. Trade and intelligence networks could thereby be established.

Moreover, Li Luoyou wasn't merely an adventurous Liaodong trader—he also possessed extensive commercial networks within the passes. The transmigrator collective could leverage his connections to establish their own intelligence and commercial networks.

Previously, the collective had refrained from expanding their mainland networks. Manpower shortage was one factor, but lack of local contacts and unfamiliarity with the territory were equally problematic. Ancient local societies were remarkably closed; without introductions and protection from local connections, outsiders found it extremely difficult to establish themselves. Though Gao Ju's influence was extensive, beyond Guangdong he was only useful in the capital—elsewhere he counted for nothing.

They weren't in a hurry to reach the capital, but Jiangnan was a region the transmigrator collective urgently wanted to penetrate. In their future plans, Jiangnan would serve as their primary market for selling goods and procuring materials.

Jiangnan's rice, cloth, and silk in particular were trade commodities the collective coveted, and the region's flourishing commerce provided an ideal market for their financial services.

Thus, while Li Luoyou was still in Foshan awaiting departure, Lingao's various departments had already begun mobilizing.

Though they didn't yet fully understand his purpose, Li Luoyou's objective in visiting Lingao was obviously to conduct business. And the most likely possibility was weapons and munitions.

The External Intelligence Bureau had learned that Li Luoyou was lobbying the Governor-General and Governor's offices in Guangdong, hoping to cast cannon for the government. His visit to Lingao was probably for similar purposes—after all, the transmigrators were renowned for their "formidable firearms."

But within the transmigrator collective, there was little enthusiasm for exporting weapons. While arms dealing was the most profitable trade, it consumed their "strategic materials": metal and coal. With both in short supply, large-scale exports were hard to justify.

As for the technological gap and the possibility of Ming or Later Jin forces copying their weapons, the Industrial Department felt there was no cause for excessive concern. Given the sophistication of Lingao-manufactured weapons, hand-crafted imitation was virtually impossible. At most, copies might approximate the appearance and structure, but the gap in material quality and processing standards would degrade their performance to very low levels.

The final decision was to avoid mentioning weapons first, instead attempting to sell him other industrial products. These could be distributed nationwide and to Liaodong through his channels. A money-making opportunity—Li Luoyou surely wouldn't refuse. The transmigrator collective especially hoped to use his commercial network to promote their financial product, Delung Bank bills of exchange, to major cities, then roll out the collective's currency when the time was ripe.

All this depended on Li Luoyou's impression of the transmigrator collective. A special working group was therefore established to handle him, composed of temporary personnel from Intelligence, Political Security, Trade, and Administrative departments. The operation regarding Li Luoyou was codenamed "Operation Willow."

---

The person chosen to lead Operation Willow was Liu San. Li Luoyou had come to Lingao through the Yang Runkaitang-Runshitang connection. Liu San was both an Elder and a Runshitang shareholder, as well as Yang Shixiang's sworn brother, and had once met Li Luoyou. Whether from principle or personal connection, having him make contact was most appropriate and convenient.

Liu San received all intelligence materials on Li Luoyou. To avoid over-stressing his sworn brother, Yang Shixiang wasn't informed about Operation Willow. Liu San thought it better to let contact occur naturally—ideally with the other party making the first move, to gain some initiative in negotiations.

Yang Shixiang was already waiting in the flower reception hall beneath the eaves. After they met, there followed the customary round of courtesies and polite phrases about "long admired" and "honored to meet." Li Luoyou inevitably complimented him on "reviving the family business." This was Yang Shixiang's proudest achievement, and the flattery naturally hit its mark. He'd been curious about this merchant introduced by his cousin: the letter had only mentioned the visitor was very curious about the "Australians" and hoped to tour Lingao, perhaps finding business opportunities with them.

Though his cousin's letter was vague, Yang Shixiang knew his cousin wouldn't write specially for an ordinary merchant. This person must be quite important—possibly even a government official.

Yang Shixiang observed the man before him: about forty, medium height, a long face with a short beard, possessing the air of a prosperous gentleman. But looking closely, his gaze was quite sharp—this was a man who had weathered great storms.

Yet at first sight, Yang Shixiang felt a strange sense of familiarity, as if he'd seen him somewhere before. He pondered this privately. Seeing the servants had already served tea, he asked: "Has the guest room for Master You been prepared?"

"Yes, Master You will stay in the East Guest Courtyard," the steward quickly replied. "How should the red-haired gentleman be accommodated? Please instruct us, Master."

"Please have him rest in the East Guest Courtyard for now." Yang Shixiang had already known from the letter that a red-haired merchant would be coming.

The East Guest Courtyard was newly expanded by Runshitang. Since their prosperity, visiting merchants and colleagues had increased, and the original guest quarters proved insufficient. This new one was built specifically for honored guests—five rooms wide with front and rear wing rooms, enough to accommodate Li Luoyou's entire party. Furnishings and supplies were complete.

Li Luoyou's trunks and luggage were checked off item by item by Saoye and sent to the guest courtyard for arrangement. Li Luoyou had also brought four types of Foshan local specialties as meeting gifts.

The gifts weren't too substantial—meant to show friendship—but weren't light either, since he was unfamiliar here and would be imposing on his hosts for everything.

"Master You, this is too generous." Yang Shixiang felt somewhat uneasy; for their level of acquaintance, the gift was rather lavish.

"No matter. I'll certainly be troubling Manager Yang for assistance." When Li Luoyou saw that irrelevant people had withdrawn from the flower hall, leaving only himself and his counterpart's personal servants, he spoke:

"My surname isn't You." In truth, he'd met this manager before, as well as Liu San—though it had been a brief encounter. There was no need to hide his true identity from them. "My surname is Li. Liaohai Trading in Guangzhou is my establishment."

"So it's Master Li the Great Merchant! My apologies! My apologies!" Yang Shixiang was greatly surprised. Everything suddenly clicked into place. Wasn't this Master Li the great merchant he'd seen at his cousin's banquet when he'd traveled to Foshan with his sworn brother?

He hadn't paid much attention to this great merchant's background before, but as Runshitang's position in Guangdong's pharmacy circles rose, he'd learned something of this influential figure. This man was quite legendary in Guangdong merchant circles. As a youth in Macau, he'd worked as an errand boy for the Portuguese and learned fluent Portuguese. Later he went to Liaodong to manage the family business. When Guangning's garrison was abandoned, he'd fled from the city, barely surviving the harrowing journey. The Li family's century of Liaodong property was lost overnight. Returning within the passes and relying on the remnants left in the capital, he traveled south to Guangdong to pursue foreign trade. Within barely ten years, he'd rebuilt the family fortune, becoming a renowned great merchant in Guangdong.

That Li Luoyou traded Liaodong goods was an open secret in Guangdong merchant circles; officialdom naturally knew as well. With just money, without some backing and means, he couldn't peacefully enjoy being a wealthy gentleman.

"My visit has several purposes I'd like to request help with." Li Luoyou came straight to the point, not at all hiding his intentions.

"Of course, of course." Yang Shixiang nodded thoughtfully. For Master Li of Guangdong's merchant circles to come under an alias meant there must be important matters to discuss. And these matters likely involved the Australians. One must be cautious.

Beyond caution, he couldn't help feeling a small sense of pride. When he'd been what he once was—tending to a half-dead little pharmacy—how could he have dreamed of a great personage like Li Luoyou coming to pay him a visit!

But for such a person to suddenly venture alone to Lingao to see him, the matters to be discussed were surely no small thing.

"I'd like to meet with the Australians, and I hope Manager Yang can act as intermediary."

Yang Shixiang felt quite hesitant. This wasn't unexpected, but the Australians in Lingao numbered a thousand if not five hundred—which ones did he want to meet? If he wanted to meet major leaders like "Director Wen" or "Lord Ma," Yang Shixiang wasn't sure his sworn brother's word would even carry weight.

"I'll do my best." Yang Shixiang nodded, deciding not to reveal Liu San's true identity for now. Better to consult with Liu San first before making any decisions.

That very evening, he sent for Liu San and conveyed Li Luoyou's request.

"This brother dared not promise him first, nor did I say you're Australian. This matter is of great importance and must be handled cautiously." He specifically reminded Liu San that Li Luoyou might well be a government agent sent to probe Lingao's situation—or he might be here to negotiate something on behalf of the government.

"At that banquet in Foshan where we first met Li Luoyou, there was an official present."

Liu San naturally knew about this—not just knew, but knew this official was a Jinyiwei probationary centurion. But there was no need to tell his sworn brother; it would only frighten him.

"Brother's advice is wise," Liu San said. "Since he wants to meet with us, you may promise him."

"I don't know the Australian hierarchy. What level of person does this Master Li want to meet? What if he wants to meet your major leaders?"

"I'll handle that myself." Liu San said. "If he wants to meet Director Wen, I'll convey the request. Whether to meet or not is another matter."

"Good." Yang Shixiang nodded, then added: "Brother should notify your colleagues to devise a response strategy." Yang Shixiang warned him, "With you building cities and training troops here like this, the court will get involved sooner or later. If a large army arrives, there'll be devastation. You should plan ahead."

Liu San remained unconcerned, only instructing him to host their distinguished guest well. As for Liu San himself, he'd be staying at Runshitang frequently going forward. For convenience, he hoped Yang Shixiang could allocate a quiet, out-of-the-way courtyard with easy access for his use.
