# Chapter 744 - Bopu Shipyard

Finally, restarting the Project 854 Modified was approved. The Executive Committee agreed to immediately start construction of one 1630 Class Cruiser, four 500-horsepower steam tugboats, twelve 200-ton class barges, and six 500-ton class vessels with hybrid wind-steam power.

Additionally, according to Wen Desi's suggestion: Continue mass-producing Type II triangular sail patrol boats. Changing single masts to double masts. With a launching speed of at least 2 boats per month.

This shipbuilding plan became the first "Great Leap Forward" for Lingao's shipbuilding industry. Before this, Lingao's shipbuilding industry had only built light vessels with tonnages around 200 tons. However, through large-scale construction of single-mast/double-mast triangular sail patrol boats in the previous stage, Bopu Shipyard had accumulated considerable shipbuilding experience.

The Planning Agency had a detailed plan for shipbuilding itself in the Five-Year Plan. According to Ma Qianzhu and Wu De's thinking, large-scale shipbuilding would start one year before the end of the First Five-Year Plan. According to the timeline, in that year, the Transmigrators would fully occupy Hainan and expand their power overseas.

Fortunately, the Planning Commission and later the Planning Agency recognized that the shipbuilding industry was a long-term investment industry. Construction of Bopu Shipyard began in the first year of the Five-Year Plan. This shipyard was greatly strengthened by a large number of shipbuilders and materials captured from Baitu Village. The shipyard started with modifying ships, then successfully imitated the *Americas*, completing the first step of self-made Western-style sailing ships.

Due to the lack of large keel timber, after launching the *Zhenhai* (an imitation of the *Americas*), the shipyard began to unwaveringly follow the path of iron ribs. Although there was some controversy between the two technological routes of jumping directly to iron hulls or using wood hulls as a transition. During this period, there was also a motion to build concrete ships on a large scale.

Ultimately, adopting wood-hulled ships was mainly because the industrial base of the Transmigrator Group was still too weak. According to experiments done by the Navy in water tanks, ship hulls made of wrought iron corroded very quickly in seawater, and Lingao's chemical industry could not yet produce paint that could protect ship hulls. In the 19th century, the solution was to wrap a layer of wooden planks outside the iron hull, but this method was too labor-intensive. Although iron-hulled ships had many advantages in manufacturing and usage that wood-hulled ships could not reach, this unsolvable reality finally made wood hulls the mainstream of shipbuilding.

As for concrete ships, they also received the support of many people. As a cheap water transport tool, concrete ships indeed had their superior points. Their advantage lay in cheap and easily available materials, and almost no specialized shipbuilding technology was needed; construction workers could build them with little training, without needing complex ship timber processing: steel bars and wire mesh could easily create the frame, and a few masons pouring cement could finish one in a few days.

The world's first concrete ship was built by Frenchman J.L. Lambot in 1848. Early concrete ships had small tonnage, simple craftsmanship, and heavy self-weight. Generally only used for small tonnage cargo transport in inland rivers. During the two World Wars, due to steel shortages, two waves of constructing reinforced concrete ships occurred.

Since 1958, China built a large number of reinforced concrete ships and wire mesh cement ships, widely used as pontoons, inland and coastal small and medium-sized motorized cargo ships, inland barges, agricultural boats, and fishing boats. China's concrete ship holding reached millions of tons, ranking first in the world. In the 60s, countries like the USA, Canada, Norway, and New Zealand began trial-producing wire mesh cement ships. Because concrete ships had heavy self-weight, small cargo-to-weight ratio, and excessive fuel consumption, their economic efficiency never met standards, so they were never applied on a large scale. China once built a 5773-ton coastal concrete cargo ship in the 70s, which ended its navigation forever and was abandoned on the shore after completing its first freight voyage.

However, according to the promotion of the "Concrete Ship Party" led by Si Kaide: Concrete ships have impact resistance exceeding wooden ships. Seaworthiness comparable to wooden ships, exceeding steel-hulled ships. Easy to repair. Do not rust or rot, long life. It is the best emergency shipbuilding plan for Transmigrators.

Si Kaide, the Office Director of the Ministry of Colonization and Trade, was so enthusiastic about concrete ships that he constantly promoted how "Great, Glorious, and Correct" concrete ships were in the Transmigration cause during his spare time. He not only preached the various benefits of concrete ships at the Executive Committee's working meetings but also frequently went to the shipyard to talk big about the technical issues of concrete ships, bluffing the few indigenous technicians of the shipyard into a daze, all pestering the Senators of the shipyard and Navy wanting to know what "building ships like building houses" was all about. Li Di, annoyed beyond measure, simply ordered sentries not to allow Si Kaide to enter the shipyard again. And declared concrete ships as "Heresy."

Li Di disliked concrete ships—because concrete ships did not fit the glorious image of the Navy. But Si Kaide did not give up; he specifically submitted two so-called standardized ships designed by himself to the Planning Agency—conducive to mass production. One was a 250-ton single-mast yuloh (oar) concrete ship as a transition, the other an 800-ton double-mast steam concrete ship.

Concrete ships used shallow-draft flat-bottomed hull forms. Rigged with sails, using Chinese-style sails to simplify maintenance support and reduce manpower consumption.

In terms of firepower, one or two types of standardized carriage-recoil type rotating gun mounts were designed, barrels could hold 20-60 pound smoothbore cannons or 70mm-130mm rifled cannons. Small concrete ships pre-installed 1 gun position, unused normally; large concrete ships pre-installed 3-4 gun positions, normally equipped with only 1-2 cannons, fully equipped in wartime.

Deck positions were reserved on the ship. In wartime, 12-20 pound cannons and small rifled guns could be installed; large ships could mount 8-12 light cannons. Small ships could mount 4.

Si Kaide enthusiastically displayed the blueprints he drew to Wu De in the conference room, explaining the ideas of manufacturing and usage.

"Suppose we have a fleet of 100 ships; mobilizing half in wartime would give us 500 cannons of various sizes, plus dozens of typewriters (machine guns), with firepower exceeding the British fleet during the Opium War. When we build ten or twenty, we'll find an opportunity to hold a public joint exercise first, shocking the Guangzhou Prefecture and the Portuguese, letting them know we can insta-kill any walled city or fleet on the Pearl River even with cargo ships!" Si Kaide talked with spittle flying; Wu De gradually became impatient. He was from a Navy background and had zero interest in concrete ships, which couldn't even be counted as ships.

"...We first design and build the lead ship in Lingao, then move the cast-in-place and final assembly parts to Macao (Xiangshan Ao), with Lingao providing raw materials. Once we control the coal mines in the Xijiang River basin, we can move the cement plant to Macao. Once we control the high-grade iron mines in Zhaoqing, we can build a steel plant, and after that, we can build iron ships..."

Wu De said: "I've never seen a concrete ship floating on the sea." He intended to directly shoot down the proposal for concrete seagoing ships with this. "Besides, I remember concrete ships are not resistant to collisions. Installing cannons on top? Won't firing cannons crack the hull? And defending against cannons! I rode concrete ships often in my hometown when I was young; they are very afraid of collisions."

"Actually, there were." Si Kaide hurriedly cited examples that France and China both built thousand-ton class concrete seagoing ships, showing this wasn't impossible. He continued saying wooden ship construction cycles were too long; shipbuilding timber must be hard wood, naturally air-dried for three to five years, otherwise it would rot quickly. There wasn't enough copper to sheath the bottoms either.

As for firing and defending against cannons, the concrete shell should be more impact-resistant than wood. Wood strictly lacks transverse strength; steel bars are grid-like, cracks can be patched on-site. Cannons of that time couldn't hit below the waterline; at most, adding a layer of steel mesh at the waterline to strengthen against cannon impact would suffice. Gun mounts had bases underneath, isolated from shock with steel embedded bolts and thick wooden blocks...

Wu De patiently listened to his "Concrete Ship Superiority Theory" mixed from materials found casually and solicited conjectures, then spoke: "If concrete ships are really so superior, why were they eliminated later?"

"However superior, they can't be more superior than steel ships." Si Kaide said, "But they are definitely superior to wooden ships."

However, facts were not so. Wu De consulted multiple Senators who knew a little about shipbuilding technology, and almost all reached the conclusion that "concrete ships are not worth developing."

The impact resistance of concrete ships is very poor, whether reinforced or wire mesh. Wire mesh concrete ships only slightly improved crack resistance compared to reinforced concrete ships, but not revolutionarily—so the claim that wire mesh concrete ships are more impact-resistant than wooden ships doesn't hold water.

Large-scale adoption of wire mesh in concrete ship manufacturing mainly lowered the cost, not improved performance. Concrete ships have an almost unsolvable problem of small usable volume and huge self-weight. Huge self-weight means high fuel consumption and low cargo capacity. Therefore, concrete ships are only suitable for engineering ships and pontoons with low requirements for self-weight and fixed or seldom moved berths, or as a substitute of last resort during steel shortages.

Furthermore, steel bars and cement could not compare in quantity with the relatively abundant forest resources of this spacetime no matter what. And the wire mesh and cement produced by Lingao industry were still quite inferior in quality.

Ultimately, the Planning Agency shot down all motions to build concrete ships, directly listing concrete ship technology as an "Eliminated Project."

Under the sunset of the first half of the 17th century, two people sat on stones on a small hill. Pistols hung loosely by their sides. A plastic sheet was spread in front of them, on which was a box stuffed with a few bottles of Kvass, Lingao's latest beer, and ice cubes, as well as a few pieces of beef.

Several Political Security Bureau plainclothes personnel watched the surroundings vigilantly; one person was roasting a leg of lamb and grilled fish a bit further away. Below the mountain was a construction site, its area comparable even to a modern shipyard in another spacetime. Ship hulls of various sizes, awaiting repair or under construction, lined the riverbank. Among them, shining rails and rising steam could be seen. The creaking sounds of steam cranes rotating and lifting, along with the sharp whistles warning workers to pay attention to safety, were heard from time to time.

Crowds of busy people wearing rattan safety helmets of different colors. The only flaw was that, although there was some distance, some unpleasant smells could still be smelled. The smell of wood tar and coal tar lingered, not to mention those steam engine boilers spewing black smoke day and night.

The footprint of the shipyard far exceeded most industrial projects in Lingao. Since the first year of the Five-Year Plan, the Planning Commission and Planning Agency had expansion and technical renovation projects for the shipyard every year. A shipyard of considerable scale had formed here. The mangroves in the Bopu estuary area were completely felled; large tracts of land in the estuary area belonged to the shipyard.

The shipyard successively built a thousand-ton dry dock, large steam cranes, and multiple hundred-ton slipways. It also installed large forging machines in the forging workshop for Project 854 to forge keels, ship ribs, and iron plates.

Wait, Project 854 hadn't started yet according to the previous chapter? Ah, this chapter says "For Project 854... installed large forging machines". It means the facilities were built *for* it previously.

Other supporting workshops were also built successively: The Timber Complex built a large timber fumigation kiln here, responsible for treating shipbuilding timber. "Small" timber for ship hulls treated in the drying kiln for about 3 days could achieve results equivalent to half a year of natural air drying. As for keel and rib large timber, they could also be processed within half a month. However, since implementing the guideline of iron-ribbed wood-hulled ships, the supply of large timber had relatively lightened a lot—quality timber used for keels and masts was already very rare in China's southern coast at the time, and prices were very expensive.

The timber processing workshop using a full set of large timber processing equipment self-made by Lingao Machinery Factory had just been completed not long ago. The equipment inside dumbfounded the shipyard's indigenous technicians who were used to "Australian Miracles." This huge workshop was used to process special planks for shipbuilding. Large blocks of timber treated by the fumigation kiln, driven by steam engines into woodworking circular saws and gang saws, could be cut into large amounts of ship planks and mast timber within a few minutes, which would take dozens of workers a full day to cut. The cuts were smooth and neat, with almost no waste. A few days later, they witnessed the inhumane terrifying power of these machines: an apprentice was inadvertently cut in half by a circular saw during operation—from his scream to dismemberment, it took less than half a minute.

Indian Jute for rope making was shipped in shiploads from Goa by Li Huamei. These jutes were mixed with local hemp in the rope and cable workshop and processed by machine rope makers into huge ropes—although iron anchor chains were more convenient to use and corrosion-resistant. But to save iron, most small and medium-sized ships in Lingao still used hemp ropes for anchor chains; these ropes were also used as sail cables.

Sailing ships required large numbers of pulleys (blocks). The shipyard's dedicated pulley production workshop had 5 workers producing using simple lathes: Annual output of 80,000 pulleys—although the Navy and Shipyard couldn't consume this many currently. Pulley shells were elm; hubs and rotating shafts were all lathed from extra-hard woods like the best Red Sandalwood and Blue Japanese Oak.

Ship sails were made from canvas self-made in Lingao. Cotton yarn came from India—Indian merchants tailored the required specifications of cotton yarn according to the Ministry of Colonial Trade's request, then shipped in bales to Lingao. Woven into canvas in Lingao's textile factory. Of course, the Ministry of Colonial Trade didn't give up opportunities to purchase canvas directly.

The workshop for sewing ship sails was an iron-framed shed covered with reed mats—typhoon season would lose some roofs, but as long as the wrought iron trusses were intact, it didn't matter; they could be repaired quickly. The workshop area was as big as half a football field. Dozens of specifically trained female workers used semi-mechanized treadle sewing machines to sew ship sails. However, threading ropes through sails was still done manually by female workers sitting on long benches.

The layout and setup of the entire shipyard largely referenced the setup of British shipyards in the materials. The shipyard employed over eight hundred workers. It was one of the few large enterprises in Lingao.

"With such a big shipyard, what else to do if not spamming ships? Keep it as a theme park?" Wen Desi smashed the glass marble in the beer bottle down, drank big mouthfuls with his neck raised, and let out a satisfied sigh.

"Finally, there's some beer taste." Wen Desi said, "Although this is typical rice beer, I'll make do."

"Governor Ma is just dogmatic..."

"The Navy, he doesn't understand." Wen Desi waved his hand, "Shipbuilding, he's even more of a layman. Hmph, if not for Wu Kuangming telling him timber can be fumigated and dried, nine out of ten he'd still think it all needs natural drying for three years. In a place like Lingao, it wouldn't dry well in thirty years."

Chen Haiyang drank a mouthful of beer; he wasn't willing to comment much on Ma Qianzhu's rights and wrongs. He changed the topic.

"General Wen, what did you mean by suggesting building more patrol boats?"

"Divide the sea surface into many areas, use small and fast boats to patrol by area responsibility. After discovering enemies, use radio to notify nearby warships to solve the problem, then use dedicated transport ships to send supplies and replacement personnel. This is our countermeasure for current insufficient resources."

"Wolf packs on the sea, huh."

"Similar, but not completely. Our goal isn't to destroy the enemy as much as possible, but to absolutely control this ocean. Speaking of which, whether Liu Xiang or Zheng Zhilong, sooner or later they have to make a move on us."

"If only we could find Liu Xiang's lair, launch a Pearl Harbor-style surprise attack." Chen Haiyang said, "Blocking them in the harbor to fight, our advantage isn't small."

"So we need to build more light patrol boats; this kind of boat is fast and flexible, endurance is passable too. Good hand for reconnaissance." Wen Desi narrowed his eyes gazing at the shipyard, "That bunch in the Executive Committee are short-sighted! Only knowing to stare at the little resources in front of eyes calculating how to allocate to cover everything. Still talking about whether resources are enough now—don't they know there's an opportunity to make a big fortune next year? To make this big fortune without ships, especially large ships for long voyages, how!"

"What opportunity to make a big fortune?" Chen Haiyang became interested.

"You'll know when the time comes." Wen Desi didn't want to say much. He was still considering this proposal. Of course, he wasn't the only Senator with similar considerations; especially a group in the Great Library was actively searching historical materials. The success or failure of this action had a direct relationship with the Navy's combat power, transport capacity, and endurance.

"When I've thought it through clearly, naturally I'll discuss it with you." Wen Desi said, "Right now, it's not mature."
