# Chapter 628 - Drill

"A siege drill will be conducted shortly. A few people always get injured during drills. Chief Dongmen instructed that medics should also enter the field and participate."

"There's a drill? I want to watch."

"Please follow me." Xie Shu led He Ping to the hillock where the dressing station was located and fetched him a pair of binoculars. It was merely a small mound, but quite a few officers were already standing on it. He Ping spotted He Ming there too, observing something through binoculars. Standing behind him was a group of Army officers—He Ping saw Wei Aiwen, Ying Yu, Zhang Bolin, and others, wearing gray uniforms and puttees, binoculars hanging on their chests and leather map cases slung over shoulders. Some held map boards and pencils. Several staff personnel were spreading maps on folding tables, busily working.

Behind them stood a dozen orderly soldiers and guards, carrying short Minié rifles or Lingao-version revolvers. They stood holding their breath, awaiting orders.

Incongruous in this typical 19th-century war scene was a radio set, where several female operators were calling out codes.

Seeing He Ping approach, He Ming nodded slightly to him without speaking.

He Ping silently took an unobtrusive spot and looked in the direction they were watching.

About two or three kilometers from the hillock stood a temporarily built earthen walled city. This earthen city was extremely small; the distance between the two opposing gates was only about one hundred and fifty meters. Though small, it had everything: crossroads inside, shops and houses on both sides of the streets, and a drum tower in the center of the crossroads. It had all the defensive measures common to Ming city walls. A moat surrounded the outside. Beyond the moat, abatis were deployed; the defenses looked quite tight.

"This was built by the Third Battalion in cooperation with the Engineer Company over three days," Xie Shu said. "The outside of the walls isn't clad in brick or tile, and the main gate is improvised from tree branches."

More than a kilometer away from the earthen city, through the thin mist, He Ping could see troops already arrayed. The scale looked about the size of an infantry battalion. Twelve cannons were lined up behind gun emplacements, with artillerymen rushing back and forth.

He knew a siege drill was about to unfold. Looking through binoculars, he could vaguely see figures moving on the city wall—probably soldiers playing the defenders. A flag fluttered on the drum tower in the city center, but he couldn't make out what was written on it.

Suddenly, a green signal flare flew into the sky. Five minutes later, three red signal flares rose. The twelve cannons deployed at the front fired one by one. White dense smoke sprayed from the muzzles. It was the first time He Ping had seen such concentrated artillery fire. The trajectories of 12-pounder cannon and 24-pounder howitzer shells drew white smoke trails in the air. Round shot smashed onto the earthen city; dirt and tree trunks flew through the air. The power of the 12-pounder solid shot dumbfounded He Ping; some shells knocked battlements and parapets flying. A dummy cannon used as a target was hit by a shell, broken in two, and sent flying. 24-pounder grenades swept the human-shaped targets serving as defenders on the wall; black smoke filled the top of the wall, and fragments flew wildly.

A watchtower on the wall took concentrated fire from 12-pounder cannons and quickly collapsed.

A red signal flare rose into the sky. Amidst rapid drumbeats, the attacking troops began charging in company column formation. Ahead of the columns were grenadiers deployed in skirmish lines. Soldiers ran forward to charge; many carried bundles of fascines, and some carried lightweight scaling ladders.

The artillery began extending fire, suppressing enemy reinforcements heading toward the city gate. Howitzer shells flew over the wall, landing on streets and houses near the gate inside the city; debris and timber flew.

At this moment, war drums thundered, shaking heaven and earth. Soldiers loudly roared "Kill!" The charging soldiers had fixed bayonets, gleaming white. Cannon fire also sounded continuously from the wall, with smoke rolling.

Grenadiers rushed to the foot of the wall, firing at the top to suppress enemy fire. Infantrymen quickly chopped open abatis with axes or pulled them away with hooked poles, opening gaps for advance. While they destroyed abatis to clear gaps, others shouted and fired fiercely and continuously at the wall top. Above and below the wall, killing shouts were deafening, gunfire thundered, and smoke shrouded everything. A gust of wind blew, dispersing the smoke slightly; in the blink of an eye, three company columns had opened gaps. Bundles of fascines were thrown into the moat, and scaling ladders were quickly erected. Grenadiers originally responsible for suppression fire began climbing the wall while constantly throwing hand grenades onto the top.

In a flash, grenadiers had cleared the "enemy" from the wall top. Some riflemen continued climbing to expand the breach, while others began attacking the gate tower, preparing to open the gate. The defending "enemy" relied on the gate tower's height advantage to fire weapons in fierce resistance. Grenadiers fired and threw grenades, advancing quickly to the foot of the gate tower and clearing the defenders. Moments later, the city gate opened wide, and the drawbridge was lowered. All infantry providing suppression fire outside rushed in. A government army flag fluttering on the drum tower was pulled down. Three red signal flares rose into the sky, announcing the end of the assault operation.

"Incredible!" He Ping couldn't help sighing. He checked his watch; from the first shot to the end of combat, the whole process took only thirty-four minutes. Not only was the firepower intense, but the coordination of soldiers' offensive movements was extremely smooth. Worthy of well-trained troops.

Officers around He Ming were commenting:

"We should have concentrated artillery fire on the gate tower at the start; then the enemy couldn't rely on it to suppress the gate-seizing troops."

"Grenadiers still had too few hand grenades. Some ran out once they attacked the gate tower."

"Artillery should accompany infantry. Our lightweight 12-pounder mountain howitzers can absolutely advance with assault columns. If the enemy gathers a large reserve near the gate, once we open it, their counter-charge could very well push the siege troops out."

"With howitzer suppression fire, the enemy can't mass troops behind the wall."

"If we had cavalry, we could wait out of enemy range until the gate opens, then charge—no need to brave artillery fire to gather near the gate."

He Ming offered no opinion. Only after everyone's comments paused did he say: "Third Battalion fought well. Coordination between units was smooth." He asked: "Who commanded the grenadiers?"

"Platoon Leader Huang Ande, 1st Platoon, Grenadier Company, 3rd Battalion."

"To command the whole battalion's grenadiers like this for the first time is very good," he said. "His decision-making when the gate assault was blocked was very decisive."

"This Huang Ande seems to be from the Ming army, right?"

"Yes," Wei Aiwen hurriedly said. "He was a battalion soldier from Shandong, and a clansman of Huang Xiong. They are cousins within five degrees of kinship."

"Huang Xiong." He Ming quickly recalled this person. He was among the earliest Army personnel and of Ming officer background, so He Ming had some impression. "This man is very valiant; seems he was in the first batch promoted to second lieutenant. Where is he now?"

"Leading the mine guard platoon at Jiazi Coal Mine."

He Ming nodded. He thought of the security issues of several dispatched outposts besides Lingao.

Jiazi Coal Mine's safety wouldn't be a problem for a while. There was a mine guard platoon and hundreds of militarily trained miners, and the place was remote.

As for the Leizhou sugar factory, although its combat power was weaker, it still had several hundred workers—Leizhou was far from the emperor, and government control wasn't strong; the sugar factory's strength was sufficient for self-defense. If there were any mishaps, Xuwen was opposite Lingao; rescue was very convenient. Even without the Army, Navy reinforcement alone would suffice.

However, just issuing instructions for them to "pay attention to defense" wasn't enough; someone would definitely nitpick during the post-war review meeting. At the very least, a label of "disregarding Senate safety" would definitely be slapped on him.

The crowd didn't know he was thinking about this. They assumed he wanted to see Huang Ande. Unexpectedly, he only said:

"Does anyone else have views on this drill?"

Pan Da said: "Artillery power is very strong; my assault engineers were useless." In the operational plan, if seizing the gate didn't go smoothly, Pan Da's engineers would deliver explosives to blow it open.

"This city is small scale; if we fight a big city, your assault engineers will be useful," He Ming said. "After all, it's acting. It can only partially test combat effectiveness. Against a big city, our modest firepower isn't enough."

Lin Shenhe said: "If attacking a heavily fortified big city with determined enemy resistance, then proceed according to formal siege warfare: dig zigzag trenches to approach, then bring siege guns close for direct fire at the gate, breaking right in."

"Armstrong rifled guns aren't large-caliber smoothbores; no need for zigzag trench approach fire. Even if accuracy is lower at distance, firing from a kilometer away is sufficient," Ying Yu said. "Using zigzag trenches to approach the enemy city for infantry assault is still a very good tactic. Covered by mortars."

City walls were a major siege subject for the Fubo Army. The Ming Dynasty was an era that emphasized fortification; even county town walls were built very solidly. Never mind 19th-century artillery—even in the 20th-century War of Resistance and Civil War, modern high-explosive shells were often helpless against many county walls. Sometimes artillery would riddle a wall with holes, but rarely collapse a whole section.

"If we can launch rockets on a large scale, we can further disrupt enemy troop movements inside the city and lower enemy morale. It just does too much damage to civilian buildings and people inside."

He Ping wasn't interested in listening further. He saw another team heading toward the earthen city with wheelbarrows, tools, and building materials. Xie Shu told him they were going to repair the city. After this earthen city was repaired, it would continue to be used as a training facility.

"Take me to see the dressing station."

"Yes, Chief." Xie Shu led him down the slope.

"What were you writing during the drill?"

He Ping had seen him fully absorbed in watching the drill, writing something in a notebook.

Xie Shu said: "I was recording the drill process and some of my own observations."

"Really? You're devoted to tactics and the art of war." He Ping said. "Why be a logistics staff officer? Why not an operations or training staff officer?"

"Because your war is fighting logistics. The Fubo Army's system—never mind government troops being far inferior, even purely military books through the ages haven't written about it." He said. "Everyone knows 'fodder and provisions precede troop movement,' but that's just a general saying. The Fubo Army is different. Everything is calculated to the utmost."

"That is modern warfare."

"What did you say, Chief?"

"Nothing," He Ping said. "Being a logistics staff officer is very trivial; you don't mind the tedium."

"I don't mind. Although being this 'provisions officer' is indeed trivial, everything is orderly and has regulations. Especially methodical," Xie Shu said. "I heard government troops also have set rules and various thresholds for handling pay, uniforms, and weapons, but the clerks handling them treat it as secret family knowledge, hidden from others. Military books don't record it in detail either."

He Ping found it increasingly curious. When discussing these things, this person's eyes shone, rather like a modern military enthusiast. *Thinking: is this person reliable? How did the Army recruit such a character!*

"How did you think of becoming a soldier? You look quite respectable. And the Great Ming always values literature over martial arts."

Xie Shu was slightly embarrassed. He nodded: "My family actually had some silver when we came to Lingao; my father did quite well here. I joined the army after seeing the Fubo Army's drill. I felt that besides firearms, the Australians' art of war was equally endlessly profound. Thinking I'd read countless Chinese military books but knew nothing of Australian art of war, I joined up when I encountered recruitment."

"Just like that?" He Ping found it incredible.

"Just like that." Xie Shu nodded solemnly.

"What does your father do in Lingao?"

Xie Shu gave him a strange look. "He works as a doctor under the Health Department..."

He Ping suddenly remembered that the Health Department had indeed recruited quite a few Chinese medicine practitioners from immigrants and local indigenous people. About twenty people, of varying quality. There was indeed one surnamed Xie among them.

"You're Xie Yao's son?"

"That is my father."

He Ping laughed. Xie Yao was a very interesting person. His family had indeed actively defected to Lingao, settling in Jialai Commune. He wasn't actually a doctor, just someone who had read many medical books and liked treating people. His medical skills weren't actually high. When the Health Department scoured for doctors among immigrants, he had insisted on enlisting, saying Australian medical arts were profound and he wanted a glimpse. Not only did he insist on being a doctor, he insisted on learning surgery.

This father and son were quite alike; both had strong thirst for knowledge and practiced what they preached.

He Ping toured the dressing station. A dozen wounded had been sent here, all injured in the drill just now. Most injuries weren't serious; the most severe case was someone hit by wood sent flying by a cannonball because he didn't dodge in time—appearing to have a broken bone. A bone-setting doctor was treating him. Others mostly had contusions or burns; medics applied medicine and bandaged them up, which was sufficient.

He Ping inspected the dressing station, including instruments and equipment—medicines and instruments were well-prepared. This was a battalion-level station, mainly responsible for collection and initial treatment. Besides two or three Chinese medicine doctors, there were medics. He Ping checked the casualty registry, seeing every wounded soldier's service number, name, and unit registered clearly. Each person also had their own medical record. Management was very standardized; he nodded in approval.

He Ping checked other hygiene and epidemic prevention measures, pointing out many deficiencies, which Xie Shu recorded one by one.

By the time inspection finished, it was evening. Dongmen Chuiyu sent an orderly to invite him to dinner. He Ping went gladly. On the way, he met Wu Shimang and Yang He. The three went to the officer canteen together.

He Ping had already visited the officer canteen once during his afternoon hygiene inspection. It was a shed built of bamboo poles and reed mats, for use by officers of second lieutenant rank and above. Actually, unit officers ate in their own companies; only headquarters and direct unit officers dined here. It was quite empty inside.

According to General Office policy, He Ping and the others had collected meal tickets before leaving. This was one of Yi Fan's specific measures for integrity building, completely cutting out official entertainment expenses. Personnel on business trips collected daily meal tickets before departure. With tickets, they could collect a standard meal at any unit, or eat assigned meals at village offices along the route, with the hosting unit settling accounts with the Ministry of Finance afterward, facilitating audits at any time.

"Amazing, there's actually Spam today." Dongmen Chuiyu, back from getting food, raised his eyebrows. "This stuff is becoming rarer and rarer."

On the tray was bitter melon stir-fried with Spam. The Spam was cut into domino sizes; though small, the quantity in the dish wasn't small—at least one-third was Spam.

"Of course; it'll expire if not eaten." He Ping thought of the last inspection of old timeline food in the Planning Institute's direct storage; there were still many untouched cans nearing their expiration dates. They had been reserved for the most critical moments; this time they were probably all being brought out.

Meals in the officer canteen were simple but nutritious. Facing a major war, even kvass containing trace alcohol wasn't supplied; everyone drank tea instead of wine.

"Once the POW camp is built, our church wants to set up a small chapel to guide these lost lambs," Wu Shimang said, taking large bites of bitter melon and Spam.

"The Army won't like you training future soldiers into believers."

"Future soldiers?" Wu Shimang shook his head. "How can this kind of Ming professional soldier serve as a soldier! They're all soldier-rouges and old sweats. The Army has no interest in absorbing them in large numbers. At minimum, they must serve as laborers for a few years to transform their temperament and habits. At most, the Army just won't recruit believers. I think nine out of ten will be sent to Sanya or Vietnam."

"Sending them to Taiwan for development would be good too."

"I think Southeast Asia is better—make a colony, mine, grow rubber or something. Since we want to go south, these soldier ruffians may not have great skills, but their ability to plague commoners is first-rate; let them go for military colonization in Southeast Asia."
