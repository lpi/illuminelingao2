# Chapter 672 - Advance Detachments

The idea to prosecute "war criminals" had been proposed by several members of the Law Society. The mastermind behind it, of course, was Ma Jia.

Though the Law Society-controlled Arbitration Court spared no effort in promoting "rule of law," producing—or rather, plagiarizing—numerous regulations and statutes while actively publicizing and encouraging commoners to seek litigation, their judicial business remained sparse.

For Lingao's population of roughly a hundred thousand, only the East Gate Market's simplified court had enough petty security and commercial cases to stay busy. The other three courts were practically deserted, going weeks without a single case. Besides helping compile laws and statutes, judges had nothing to do and were frequently seconded to other departments for administrative or miscellaneous work.

Idleness was a dangerous signal, and Ma Jia was worried. Too much personnel secondment would gradually disperse morale.

*I need to give them something to do!* Ma Jia thought. But the Arbitration Court's caseload couldn't be conjured from thin air. The busiest department was obviously the Political Security Bureau, but that was essentially independent—he neither wanted nor could interfere.

The judicial system lacked important, attention-grabbing cases. After the great Chengmai victory, Ma Jia's entire focus shifted to the "war criminal" issue.

For many transmigrators, the "war criminal" matter was pointless grandstanding. They had the prisoners. Whether to kill, flay, or otherwise abuse them was entirely at their discretion. What was the point of trying war criminals? And under what law or treaty? It would just be another exercise in talking to themselves, directing and acting their own play.

But Ma Jia's proposal won majority support in the Yuan Laoyuan. "Everything according to law" might sometimes seem affected, rigid, or even laughable, but compared to a system where a few could arbitrarily arrest anyone, it was far more progressive.

So Ma Jia's "war criminal trials" were decided upon. A Special War Crimes Tribunal was established, with prosecuting attorneys and defense counsels designated.

Of course, from a fairness standpoint this was absurd—this timeline had no international treaties, no international law. The Ming government had never acknowledged, signed, or participated in anything of the sort.

The so-called "war crimes trials" were simply the transmigrator regime imposing its new social order on this timeline. But even within the Law Society, there were differing views on this approach.

If they truly followed the old timeline's international law and treaties, the transmigrator regime had committed no fewer war crimes in their battles with imperial forces. Yuan Qiushi had hanged dozens of prisoners at the POW camp; they had engaged in massive prisoner enslavement...

These things could arguably constitute "war crimes." So some opposing transmigrators felt that pursuing "war criminals" was asking for trouble and tying their own hands.

Under such questioning, the Yuan Laoyuan Standing Committee held a hearing on the necessity and reasonableness of "war crimes trials."

The hearing's purpose, of course, wasn't to discuss "fairness" but "reasonableness."

"So-called war crimes," Ma Jia said at the Standing Committee hearing, dispelling transmigrators' concerns with a single sentence, "are crimes only the losers have."

Ma Jia further explained: trying "war criminals" wasn't simply about intimidation or revenge, but about seizing the moral high ground and proclaiming one's own "righteousness." This was extremely important in the ideological domain.

So the war crimes trials proceeded with great fanfare.

By this time, the Executive Committee and Yuan Laoyuan's attention had shifted elsewhere—specifically, to the entire island of Hainan.

The plan to occupy all of Hainan, at Wei Aiwen's suggestion, had been renamed "Summer Awakening"—Spring Awakening's results had been too poor, drawing unanimous opposition. As a compromise, it was seasonally renamed.

Under General Staff adjustments, the army, after resting for several days following the parade, began executing the "Summer Awakening" plan.

"Summer Awakening" deployed four battalions, divided into Eastern and Western Advance Detachments.

The Western Detachment, built around the 3rd Infantry Battalion reinforced with artillery, engineering, logistics, and medical units, aimed to occupy Danzhou, extending the Lingao regime's "Purple Zone" control to the Danzhou–Changhua border.

The Eastern Detachment had much larger objectives. According to General Staff plans, the first phase of expansion eastward would complete the occupation of Chengmai, Qiongshan, Ding'an, and Wenchang—four counties. It was built around the 1st, 5th, and 6th Infantry Battalions.

These four counties, like Lingao, were foundations of Ming rule in Hainan: developed early, populous, with deeper administrative roots. Taking these counties would announce the complete collapse of Ming rule in Lingao.

As for the southern prefectures and counties—sparsely populated, with only a few thousand registered men, women, old, and young per county, many with county magistrate positions long vacant—Ming rule was purely symbolic. They could be plucked whenever convenient.

Each detachment included not just military personnel but also county work teams personally selected by Liu Muzhou. Each team, besides transmigrators, had several native cadres to immediately begin work and take over county administration.

The first phase of occupying all Hainan proceeded extremely smoothly—one might say they "pacified by proclamation." With naval support, the army conducted an "armed grand tour." Villages along the route surrendered at the first breeze. Danzhou fell first—actually, the army hadn't planned to assault the city. They had intended to first make camp, then use carrots and sticks to compel city officials to follow orders, the slow-boiling-frog approach. But the officials in the city surrendered proactively. This was so smooth that Battalion Commander Yu Zhiqian, in charge of the western expansion, was greatly surprised. He had expected the city officials to barricade themselves, making things difficult.

The Danzhou prefect killed himself with great integrity. This *jinshi* who had barely been in office half a year attempted no further military resistance that would only add to the transmigrators' prisoner count. Knowing it was futile, he simply and decisively took poison.

The surrender was organized by the Danzhou County Bailiff. He and the city gentry tremblingly awaited the Western Detachment's arrival at the city gate.

After rest and reinforcement, the Western Detachment's military spirit was even higher than before the Chengmai battle.

The letter had been sent by the Danzhou County Bailiff. Like Lingao's County Bailiff Sun Ruiwu, he had lost all hope for a career as a miserable official in this remote, evil posting. Though he wouldn't openly defect, he maintained a wait-and-see attitude. So he neither killed himself nor fled, using "protecting the official seal" as an excuse to stay and organize the surrender. If the bald bandits could stay long-term, he had no objection to changing his allegiance and serving these Australians.

"I thought we'd have to camp outside the city. Didn't expect to get in this easily."

Detachment Commander Yu Zhiqian said triumphantly to the Danzhou Work Team leader, Liu Yixiao.

"Easy gains mean trouble ahead." The work team leader said grimly. "Who knows what schemes these officials are cooking up? We must stay vigilant!"

The prefect's suicide was the bailiff's claim. Who knew whether he was really dead or if there was another trick? Liu Yixiao believed they must maintain full vigilance to avoid being exploited by enemies.

According to regulations, except for small parties taking over city defenses and key facilities, the main military force wouldn't enter the city. This wasn't for reasons of benevolence or not disturbing the people, but because the Health Department had serious concerns about local urban hygiene. Until necessary epidemic prevention and disinfection were performed, the army generally avoided densely populated areas to prevent contracting disease.

But for the gentry waiting at the city gate, this was a great relief—truly, the Australians deserved the words "not a hair harmed"!

Liu Yixiao exchanged a few courtesies, then followed the bailiff and gentry to the prefectural yamen. Danzhou had slightly more population than Lingao and was marginally more prosperous. But the streets were now empty, devoid of pedestrians. Outside the yamen, a sparse gathering of a dozen or so runners and clerks stood at attention, expressions wooden.

The yamen was decrepit—it looked worse than some historical replicas from the old timeline. Liu Yixiao went inside and looked around. In the courtyard stood a coffin—the prefect who had killed himself.

"Open it!" he ordered.

There was nothing worth seeing about a corpse. He wanted to confirm the prefect was really dead. Liu Yixiao pulled a notebook from his satchel—a "Danzhou Basic Situation Compendium" compiled by the External Intelligence Bureau. The first section contained biographies and photographs of yamen officials large and small.

The photos, taken with telephoto lenses, were somewhat unclear, but facial features were recognizable. The corpse in the coffin, though face distorted from poisoning, was clearly the same person.

Liu Yixiao sighed and nodded: brave men were always respected.

"Prepare him properly for burial," he said. "Are the prefect's family still in the city?"

"Yes, yes." The bailiff said cautiously, studying his expression. "They're all in the rear residence. Would Your Honor like to see them...?"

"No need. Tell them not to kill themselves!" Liu Yixiao had no interest in the prefect's family. "Prepare a boat immediately. Send twenty taels of silver as condolence money. Let them leave with the coffin."

"Your Honor's grace—they will never forget..."

Liu Yixiao nodded impatiently and asked a few more questions. Most runners and clerks had fled—word of what had happened to their counterparts in Lingao had reached here. The petty officials feared suffering the same fate and had long since absconded with their valuables.
