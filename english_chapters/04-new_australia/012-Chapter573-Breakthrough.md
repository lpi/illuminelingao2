# Chapter 573 - Breakthrough

"Good, but don't expect much support. The Executive Committee is very stingy with funding and personnel allocations for the Religious Affairs Office. The Catholic Church is currently spending mostly Jesuit money."

"I don't need many resources." Zhang Yingchen said modestly. "Just allocate me the necessary personnel—a dozen or so orphans will do. As for funding, current needs are limited; I can cover it myself for now."

"Personnel is very difficult—everyone's competing for them." He Ying said. "And you want orphans? Do you know orphans are a scarce commodity?"

"There must be some. My requirements aren't high—ten people would be enough. All boys—ages 11 to 16, preferably thirteen or fourteen. The fair-featured type. I'll personally train them."

"Everyone else is thinking about raising lolis, but your tastes are truly distinctive." He Ying said.

"Not at all," Zhang Yingchen coughed a few times. "I do have requirements! No orphans tainted with underworld flavor; no orphans who are too honest and inflexible. Preferably those who've received training in theater troupes or similar places, who understand musical instruments. Ideally with high hatred values—the more they hate this era, the more they suit our needs."

"Submit a report after the hearing passes." He Ying said. "Purely a queue-up formality—the chances of getting people immediately are slim."

Ultimately, Zhang Yingchen's proposal passed the Standing Committee's hearing and was also approved by the Executive Committee. As for the novices he wanted, there were none for now. As He Ying had said: orphans were a scarce commodity in high demand from all quarters. This application wouldn't go through without waiting several months.

Zhang Yingchen decided not to wait any longer. He chose to make the Sanya region currently under development his first missionary testing ground. There were large numbers of laborers there who needed religious solace. Moreover, starting missionary work directly in Lingao could easily create conflict with Old Wu. Though Old Wu was no crusader, it was better to avoid such direct intrusion into someone else's territory.

He decided to use his medical skills as much as possible to spread his doctrine. To this end, he had He Ying temporarily transfer his personnel file to the Health Department, preparing to compete for assignment to Sanya for health service. To be prudent, he also had He Ying write an introduction letter from the Religious Affairs Office, stamped with the State Council's seal. The Elders in charge at Sanya—Wang, Xi, Zhuo, Li, and the rest—were no gentle souls. If they mistook him for some "cult" operator and arrested him first to ask questions later, that would be embarrassing.

Besides this precious letter, Zhang Yingchen's belongings were extremely simple. He intended to emulate those missionaries who had blazed trails through thorns and ventured into remote areas, carrying only the most essential supplies, attempting the simplest lifestyle for living and proselytizing. This was not only to ensure the simple, humble appearance required of a religious person but also to lay the groundwork for future missionary activities deep into wilderness areas.

Besides the self-made Daoist robes he wore, he carried only a double-shoulder wicker backpack made by the Lingao Clothing Factory, containing several sets of coarse cloth undergarments issued to laborers; similarly labor-issued towels and enamel cups; a tin lunch box, an oilcloth rain cloak, two spare pairs of leather-soled cloth shoes, and Army-issue cloth puttees. His Swiss Army knife was the only modern equipment. Beyond this was a standard medical kit, containing mainly various Chinese patent medicines developed under Liu San's supervision, plus a few crude antibiotics.

Zhang Yingchen decided to train himself using this equipment at Yulin first. For this, he specifically went to the Long-Range Exploration Team and participated in a four-week wilderness survival training course, learning various skills like direction-finding, route selection, and foraging. He also began learning several local dialects, including the most widely spoken Hainan dialect and military dialect. As for Li language, there was nowhere to learn it for now.

When Hippo returned, he brought smoking braziers, medicine, food, more nurses, and this suddenly appearing doctor.

Wang Luobin and the others had already left the command office; only Zhuo Tianmin remained on duty. He'd suffered considerable physical injury in the riot and was temporarily staying at the command post.

Zhuo Tianmin looked at this person's dispatch certificate, then at this strange man with his strange clothes and hair, carrying a wicker box on his back and a standard Health Department medical kit slung over his shoulder, a Model 29 jungle machete hanging from his belt, a bamboo hat on his shoulders, and several water-filled bamboo tubes around his neck.

In this getup, he looked less like an Elder and more like an ordinary native.

"You're a doctor?"

This tall Daoist smiled and extended his hand: "I'm Zhang Yingchen. I heard the Sanya Development Zone needed more medical personnel, so I came here first. I'll need your help a lot going forward."

"Oh, your appearance—" Zhuo Tianmin studied him.

"This is the indigenous equipment setup," Zhang Yingchen said. "I plan to go deep into the interior to explore and gather herbs, and incidentally make contact with the local Li and Miao natives to see how receptive they are to doctrine."

"I see." Zhuo Tianmin nodded. "But this equipment is too crude."

"It's fine," Zhang Yingchen wore a gentle smile. "Natives travel the same way I do, perhaps even worse off. If they can manage, so can I."

Zhuo Tianmin had no interest in his peculiar hobbies but was skeptical of his mission. This person kept claiming to be here as a doctor, yet his introduction letter and dispatch certificate bore the Religious Affairs Office's seal.

Wang Luobin wasn't interested in whether the medical personnel temporarily supporting from Bairren City was a Daoist or a priest. Once this self-proclaimed medical worker presented his attending physician certificate from Bairren City's medical system, he was directly cleared to go assist at the clinic.

But Zhuo Tianmin was somewhat uneasy about this fellow who looked more like a religious huckster than a doctor.

In his view, the appearance of such a strange doctor in Sanya—where people were already nervous due to constant workplace accidents—was itself an uncertain factor. Having personally experienced the Li boss's riot, Zhuo Tianmin couldn't help but express his doubts to Wang Luobin.

Wang Luobin was unconcerned. In his view, this Zhang Yingchen was at least properly trained. His medical skills were surely better than the hastily trained veterinarians and nurses among the transmigrators, and a clergyman's appearance would be a timely emotional stabilizer for native workers.

"The Portuguese and Spanish brought priests to the Americas and Southeast Asia," he replied without looking up from the engineering reports. "Religious brainwashing is an indispensable weapon for colonizers. Worst case scenario—Old Zhang is one of us, an Elder too. Surely you don't worry he'll carve a one-eyed stone figure at midnight and bury it at the work site to organize these natives for revolt?"

The discussion about the newly arrived Daoist doctor ended inconclusively. Zhang Yingchen, currently busy treating patients and promising the dying that he could definitely transcend them to the Elect Heaven, had no idea two of his development colleagues had just had a somewhat unpleasant argument about him.

However, he soon tasted his colleagues' hostility toward his missionary activities. That day, he was paired with Guo Fu. During a break, he expounded some doctrine to her. The next day, Hippo summoned him for a very serious talk:

"I know you came to Sanya with an experimental missionary assignment. This was approved by the Central State Council." Hippo said. "But you should know that according to Executive Directive 1-61, employees like nurses cannot be targets of proselytizing."

"Executive Directive 1-61 only says no proselytizing in schools, government offices, and the military. It doesn't say nurses can't be proselytized..."

"At this stage, hospitals and clinics are government offices. Nurses are public servants—no proselytizing." Hippo didn't like his nurses having religious inclinations—even though religious organizations running hospitals was common worldwide.

To Zhang Yingchen, this seemed like baseless interference. But he didn't argue. To establish himself here, he needed support from the local Elders; arguing would accomplish nothing and would only hurt his prospects.

So he redirected his missionary targets to ordinary laborers. He believed management wouldn't interfere with such proselytizing. Moreover, after the riot, the Sanya Military Committee bosses would surely be eager to find some spiritual opium to soothe the masses.

When Zhuo Tianmin got Hippo's report, he felt somewhat uneasy. After a conversation with Wang Luobin, Xi Yazhou received orders to "keep an eye on that Daoist."

According to various reports, Zhang Yingchen wasn't particularly interested in traditional Daoist occult arts and immortal ascension. His missionary theory, in Zhuo Tianmin's view, was practically a variant of Christianity.

Setting aside his abstract explanations of "the Dao" as Daoism's supreme object of faith, what this short-haired Daoist constantly talked about was: "The Lord Laozi pitied mankind's many hardships, and thus dispatched five hundred true immortals aboard one iron ship, descending upon the South Sea, manifesting as Holy Sovereign forms to enlighten the people, awaiting the arrival of the Land of Great Peace. Those who follow this enlightenment are the Heaven-chosen people, who will surely have a place in the Land of Great Peace; even if they unfortunately perish, they will ascend to the Elect Heaven."

This was practically nonsense. Zhuo Tianmin thought. But he also acknowledged that under current harsh conditions, giving native laborers some spiritual sustenance was beneficial. Those who knew a good place awaited them after death would be braver facing death.

Through everyone's collective efforts—particularly the widespread distribution of compound antimalarial tablets and significant nutritional improvements—the malaria tide suddenly receded after reaching its peak. Mortality plummeted. By the end of the second month, there were no new cases of illness or death. Sanya development had finally weathered the first hurdle.

Though workplace injuries still occurred from time to time, the lifting of epidemic fears greatly calmed minds. Combined with Zhang Yingchen's tireless preaching that those who died from disease or accidents had ascended to the Elect Heaven, the dual effect of material and spiritual support finally settled the previously anxious native laborers. As the environment was further modified and the hygiene campaign expanded, mosquitoes, flies, leeches, and various parasites saw their habitats deteriorate and densities plummet. Illness rates dropped dramatically, and project progress accelerated substantially.

On April 20th, amid crackling firecrackers, the railway finally reached the site of Tiandu Iron Mine. To enthusiastic cheers from the railway workers, Wang Luobin, Zhuo Tianmin, and others symbolically drove the last few spikes into the rails. The Yulin-Tiandu Railway was officially opened—the transmigrators' first formally operating railway line, not one of those industrial tracks for moving raw materials around Lingao's industrial zone. This less-than-twenty-kilometer railway was later called the "Road of Blood" by certain commentators: hundreds had died from workplace accidents and epidemics during its construction. The famous independent scholar Dubai wrote in his work *The Bloody Giant Beneath the Modernization Mask* (now banned):

"...According to statistics, during the initial phase of 'Project Giant' implementation, the foundational engineering work—railway, road, and communications construction—saw nearly a thousand laborers die from accidents, overwork, disease, and malnutrition due to extremely harsh climate and living conditions along the construction line, compounded by the inhumane forced labor under certain individuals like Zhuo, Wang, and Pan. For this reason, this section of the project was later called the 'Road of Death.'"

Yet for the Elders managing Sanya development, the completion of this line represented a decisive victory. The railway was like a great blood vessel, finally able to continuously transport construction materials and labor to the front lines of construction. Wang Luobin wrote in his reminiscences: "...If we still had doubts about the prospects before this, then at the moment the railway was completed, I believed Sanya development's success was only a matter of time."

Meteor No. 2 locomotive—Meteor No. 1 had been completely damaged due to inadequate component strength and had no repair value; it was brought back to Lingao for dismantling and recycling—departed from the crude wooden platform of Yulin Stockade station amid firecrackers. Meteor No. 2 used a Mozi Type 3 steam engine with 500 horsepower output. The huge boiler devoured premium Hongji anthracite, boiling thousands of liters of water into scorching steam, driving pistons and levers. The black iron wheels slowly turned. The fully loaded train of construction materials accelerated steadily, finally reaching twenty kilometers per hour as it headed toward Tiandu Station.

The Elders laid a foundation stone at the original site of Tiandu Town, declaring the formal commencement of Tiandu Iron Mine development. Under the support of bulldozers, explosives, and the "Purple Lightning Kai" wheelbarrows, labor teams using steel tools completely destroyed the local vegetation and original landforms. Wetlands were buried under waste soil and rubble; grass and shrubs were completely cleared. Vast swaths of brush were simply burned away. The river valley once filled with subtropical vegetation had now mostly become barren wasteland. The Tiandu River had also dried up—upstream it was temporarily dammed, and the riverbed would be dredged and deepened. Wang Luobin also planned to build a small reservoir nearby to supply Tiandu Town and the mining district with domestic and industrial water. If the water volume was sufficient, they might add a small hydroelectric plant as supplementary power.
