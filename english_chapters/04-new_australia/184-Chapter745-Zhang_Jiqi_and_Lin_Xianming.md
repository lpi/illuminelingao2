# Chapter 745 - Zhang Jiqi and Lin Xianming

At the place nearest to the two of them, a three-masted wood-hulled warship was undergoing hull installation in the dock. Workers labored on the scaffolding. Hull planks, steam-bent into certain arcs, were hoisted in bundles by steam cranes and sent to various installation stations.

This warship, assembled with iron ribs and steam engines manufactured using advanced technology from another spacetime, would become the most powerful war machine in this spacetime.

On the largest slipway, the wrought iron keel of another, smaller armed three-masted ship had been laid. Numerous cranes driven by gas engines were moving iron ribs close to assembly positions on the keel. Workers wearing safety helmets bustled back and forth under the direction of the foreman's red and green flags; chants and whistles rose and fell.

Zhang Jiqi was on the dock of Project 854, watching the progress of the hull planking work. He wore blue denim work clothes and a rattan safety helmet. In the entire Bopu Shipyard, his status was the highest among indigenous employees; his title was "Shipbuilding Technician"—this title was unique not only in the shipyard but also among all indigenous workers. By comparison, Lin Xianming and Lu Youtian, who migrated from Baitu Village with him, were only Associate Technicians. Of course, even Associate Technicians were amazing; knowing the mechanical system, indigenous workers who could be rated as "Mechanic" could already walk proudly.

Although Zhang Jiqi didn't have much education, his comprehension was extremely strong. He especially possessed the ability of a traditional Chinese craftsman to never forget what he saw. As long as Wen Desi showed him the details of a ship model, he would firmly remember many of the details. He might not understand the "why" of some design structures, but he could at least quickly know the "how." For the Senators, this was enough—after all, what they needed now were workers with strong hands-on ability, not designers.

Zhang Jiqi was originally a shipwright. After receiving guidance and education from Wen Desi and others over the past few years—especially after learning several European ship styles and shipbuilding technologies—he integrated Chinese and Western knowledge, making his shipbuilding skills even more refined. He became the most important indigenous technical person in the shipyard. He was responsible for the final assembly of Project 854.

On the rails, baskets of specialized iron nails and clasps for assembly were unloaded from flatbed cars pulled by diesel locomotives. These were manufactured in the Metalworking Workshop where Lu Youtian served as Workshop Director—the standard parts factories in Lingao's industrial system did not produce these special parts; most metal parts needed for shipbuilding were manufactured by the shipyard's own workshops.

On the scaffolding, workers installed hull planks exactly as taught in their training. The sounds of hammers and drills rose and fell. Occasionally, calls of "Watch out!" could be heard; following the sound, a red-hot rivet would tumble through the air, be caught firmly by a riveter above with iron tongs, inserted into the rivet hole while hot, and quickly hammered tight with a sledgehammer.

Other workers were busy caulking with a mixture of hemp fibers, tung oil, and oyster shell lime. The process was strictly calculated to ensure production efficiency was optimized.

Each shipbuilder was trained for thirty days. They didn't need to master much theoretical knowledge, nor did they need to learn special crafts or have extremely high comprehension; they just needed to follow the master. This kind of worker didn't need to understand shipbuilding, only how to hammer nails, drive rivets, install planks, and caulk. This practice greatly simplified the training process for shipbuilders.

A steam whistle sounded—this was the whistle for shift change. Night shift personnel were lining up to enter the factory. Zhang Jiqi's quitting time had also arrived. But he didn't plan to get off work—work at the shipyard was unprecedentedly intense; currently, there were 6 ships under construction on the slipways simultaneously. Yet there were very few mechanics capable of giving technical guidance.

Zhang Jiqi didn't have consciousness like "laborers are the masters," but he had the simplest feeling of gratitude. This wasn't just about material benefits—back in Baitu Village, the Lin family also treated him, a shipwright, as an honored guest. Rather, the respect and understanding he received here were unobtainable anywhere else. Zhang Jiqi knew very well: in terms of learning and ability, the Senators were hundreds and thousands of times better than him, yet every one of them was very polite to him, asking him to sit when talking, and some Senators would even offer him cigarettes—this was different from the polite attitude of the Lin family back then. Zhang Jiqi knew clearly: in the past at Baitu Village, he relied entirely on his skill for security; once he became old and frail or lost his technical secrets, becoming useless to the Lin family, all courtesy and material enjoyment would disappear.

But here, he didn't worry about any of this. The Australians not only didn't covet his skills but constantly taught him brand new techniques. And as long as he worked earnestly, he could get generous pay. Even if one day he was too old to work, the Australians wouldn't abandon him—the treatment the Australians gave their subordinates was surprisingly good. There had been several casualty accidents in the shipyard, and the compensation was generous. Usually, masters who were willing to give a few taels of "burial silver" were considered kind-hearted, but the Australians not only gave burial silver but also took care of the deceased or injured workers' families: schooling for children, support for the elderly, jobs for those willing to work. Even for those disabled by work injuries, appropriate tasks were arranged so they wouldn't be displaced.

This thing the Australians called "Welfare" filled Zhang Jiqi with trust in them. He was willing to use all his strength and skill to work for them.

Zhang Jiqi came out of the duty room next to Dock Number Zero—this dock got its name because it built Ship Number Zero back then—and decided to get something to eat first, then check the shipbuilding progress in other slipways and docks to see if there were any problems to solve.

The shipyard canteen was just a big shed by modern standards, but for 17th-century workers, being able to shelter from wind and rain was already very good. Rows of wooden long tables and food serving windows gave many Senators a familiar feeling. However, in terms of variety, it couldn't compare with 21st-century canteens—just those fixed few kinds, not rich or colorful. Protein was mainly provided by seafood; eggs and meat were hard to see.

But for indigenous workers, having enough brown rice to fill their bellies was already an excellent meal; having a little fish sauce and vegetables was wonderful gourmet food. Of course, Zhang Jiqi's canteen was slightly more particular than theirs; having some vegetables and fish or meat every meal made him very satisfied.

All indigenous employee canteens under the Transmigrator Group were not free but provided meal tickets of a certain amount monthly to subsidize workers. The level roughly ensured they could eat their fill, guaranteeing physical strength and basic nutritional needs. Workers who needed to eat better could purchase extra meal tickets. All meal tickets were valid for the current month; this ensured workers ate all the food into their own stomachs instead of buying it to take home to families. In the past, factories directly issued meal allowances, only to find most workers used the currency coupons to subsidize household expenses instead of eating. Malnutrition occurred from time to time.

Zhang Jiqi belonged to the high-income strata among indigenous employees—according to Du Wen's classification, he belonged to Lingao's "Labor Aristocracy." Moreover, Zhang Jiqi had no wife or children, a bachelor; if he was full, the whole family was not hungry. Naturally, he was much more generous in eating and drinking than ordinary workers.

Zhang Jiqi bought a portion of Fried Rice Noodles with Shellfish and Seasonal Vegetables. The fried rice noodles were made of rice flour mixed with sweet potato flour, stir-fried over high heat, looking oily, the favorite meal of workers lacking oil in their daily diet—but also the most expensive. Most workers were used to buying cheaper Soup Rice Noodles. He also bought a bottle of Kombucha (Red Tea Fungus); this thing was sweet and sour, perfect for drinking after a meal.

Kombucha was a beverage indigenous workers rarely bought; it was mainly prepared in the canteen for Senators working in the factory. So every time Zhang Jiqi raised his neck to drink Kombucha, it would attract a burst of envy from the workers—this also made him very proud.

Zhang Jiqi took the plate piled high with rice noodles back to the table—this potion was fully 250 grams. For workers engaged in heavy physical labor, it was nothing. There were plenty of workers who ate half a kilogram or even one kilogram per meal.

He saw Lin Xianming sitting at a table, burying his head eating a portion of brown rice, with only a vegetable for a side dish. He couldn't help but be surprised. Lin Xianming was the shipyard's General Woodworking Foreman, titled Associate Technician. With rank salary plus title salary, his income was only slightly less than Zhang's. Furthermore, his children were all adults, wife and children all had jobs; he shouldn't need to save to this extent.

"It's you, Old Lin," Zhang Jiqi put his plate opposite him and sat down. "Why represent this?" (Wait, text says "Why eat this?" - *Ni zenme chi zhege?*)

"Oh, it's you," Lin Xianming was somewhat listless. As General Woodworking Foreman, there were many woodworking assembly tasks recently. Like Zhang Jiqi, Lin Xianming hadn't gone home for several days. " heavy burden, ah."

"You must be joking. Your son and wife both have jobs and income, earning enough for themselves. What burden?"

Lin Xianming sighed: "Who told me to be surnamed Lin?"

The Lin clan activities had remained active. Many poor immigrants surnamed Lin, coveting relief from the clan, also successively joined the Lin clan (Lian Zong). The result was that Lin Xianming's economic burden as Clan Head became very large.

Although as Clan Head, he could collect some money from clansmen to help poor new clansmen, after the Lin family came to Bopu, his authority was not what it used to be—he could no longer shout an order to open the ancestral hall, arrest disobedient clansmen to be beaten, made to kneel, fined, or even directly executed.

Although current Lin Clan activities were still frequent, after experiencing two dismemberments, cohesion was not what it used to be. Losing major income sources and being integrated into Lingao's security system, the benefits the clan brought to clansmen in terms of economic interests and safety were very few.

Distant branches within the clan, whose words carried little weight, began to disregard the authority of the main branch—resentment caused by unfair interest distribution in the Lin Clan in the past also gradually surfaced. This way, for Lin Xianming to maintain the entire Lin Clan, he had to pay a greater price than before. Ancestral worship ceremonies had to be grander, and various clan activities more frequent; while newly joined Lin clansmen almost all needed relief, many clansmen were unwilling to pay out of pocket to help them. They thought these people actually had no relation to their main family and this was spending wasted money.

In the past, clan expenses could be rigidly apportioned to each branch; now many clansmen refused to pay or paid less, and the deficit part was practically filled by him alone. On one hand, apportionment income was getting less and less; on the other hand, various expenses did not decrease but increased. Lin Xianming's burden naturally became heavier.

Zhang Jiqi knew a little about these things. He somewhat watched the fire from the other side of the river. After all, Zhang Jiqi had grudges with Lin Xianming over interest distribution in the past. But now he felt much more open-minded; besides, both sides had generally cooperated happily in Baitu.

"How is Gonglao?" Zhang Jiqi feigned concern. Actually, he hated this so-called "Nephew" (Shi Zhi) the most. That arrogant and rude appearance of a young master had always made him unhappy—although on the surface he always generously expressed liking and tolerance for this "Nephew." But when assessing shipyard worker qualifications, he unhesitatingly gave Lin Gonglao and Lin Gongxun zeros. He secretly cheered when Lin Gonglao was moved to Sanya at the beginning of the year.

"Very bitter!" Lin Xianming felt heartache for his son, couldn't help sighing, and lowered his voice, "Someone sent a message back saying many died in Sanya due to malaria. But the project is progressing fast."

"Rest assured. Gonglao is young and healthy."

"Can only think that way," Lin Xianming looked worried. "No need to speak of Gonglao's matter; he's an adult. Ideally, this clan matter is the headache. Spending is so big, everyone refuses to pay—only caring about themselves."

"Old Lin, what's the point of you struggling to support the clan? It's become your personal affair. Is it worth it?"

"Sigh, sometimes I also think it's not worth it." Lin Xianming ate a mouthful of boiled vegetables, chewing without appetite. "But our clan fled from Fujian to Hainan, managed to grow to this point; I'm not reconciled to it just scattering like this."

"You aren't reconciled, but others don't care," Zhang Jiqi said. "Take the Joining Clan matter. People who have absolutely nothing to do with your clan, just surnamed the same 'Lin,' are taking monthly money from you for free—this isn't Baitu Village back then; everyone lives on wages. Is it worth doing this? Do you owe them, or do you expect some benefit from them?"

Lin Xianming also felt it was pointless, but he still adhered to the traditional concept of "the more clansmen, the better."

"Many clansmen means not being bullied; there is strength in numbers," Lin Xianming said.

"Hehe." Zhang Jiqi laughed. "Old Lin! Your brain isn't working! Strength in numbers, that was in Baitu Village. Your whole family is now in Bopu; if you still want 'strength in numbers,' what are you preparing to do with that strength?"

Lin Xianming was startled, immediately understanding the meaning in his words. He instantly broke out in a cold sweat.

"The government is the government, the clan is the clan; two unrelated things. Even the biggest clan dare not fail to pay imperial grain and taxes... How could the Chiefs not understand this principle?"

"If I say you are muddled, you are muddled." Zhang Jiqi looked around. "Think for yourself unless the Chiefs truly, as you say, 'understand this principle,' why did they take a dozen households from your clan and even Gonglao to Sanya? You still engage in Joining Clan and pulling in heads all day! Little brother, I am not trying to scare you—if this goes on..." He shook his head repeatedly.

This sentence was like a bolt from the blue, stunning Lin Xianming. It took a long while before he stammered; "Unlikely, right. I... We... Our Lin family has no disloyal heart!"

"Whether you do or not, you and I don't count." Zhang Jiqi slurped his fried rice noodles, revealing a smile.

Watching Lin Xianming leave the canteen in a trance without even finishing his meal, Zhang Jiqi felt a bit smug—You Lin Xianming, befuddled by being Clan Head! What the Australians taboo most is clans. You still want to engage in big Lin Clan activities; I reminded you for the sake of old sentiments, otherwise, later it would be the lot of home confiscation and clan extermination!

While Zhang Jiqi and Lin Xianming were having this conversation, Lu Youtian was eating at another table with Jiang Ye and others. According to custom, factories usually had 2-3 Senators with professional knowledge on night duty to be ready to guide work and solve problems at any time. They generally lived in specialized "Senator Offices"; theoretically, they ate separately, but many found waiting for the Senator Canteen to deliver food troublesome and cold, so they simply went directly to the Staff Canteen to eat. This invisibly closed the distance between them and indigenous workers.

Lu Youtian wore black grimy work clothes, covered in sweat—the Metalworking Workshop had furnaces, forging, sand casting, and casting. Since indoor temperature was above 40°C at any time. Lu Youtian ordered a large plate of Vegetable and Prawn Fried Rice, wolfing it down while chatting with Jiang Ye and others about work.

"Chief Wen said to sheath the ship bottom with copper; how to make this copper sheet? Hammer it? Like beating gold leaf?"

"Rolling mills making copper sheets is no problem," Jiang Ye said. "It's just how to sheath it on; I haven't figured it out yet."

Lu Youtian still couldn't understand: "The ship bottom is so big; how large should the copper sheet be to be suitable?"

At this time, Zhang Jiqi came over—with Senators present, he felt he should absolutely come to say hello. After exchanging greetings, the group continued to discuss the craft of copper sheathing on the ship bottom at the dining table.

"I've seen Chief Wen's ship model; the copper sheets are small pieces nailed to the ship bottom with nails. Edges interlocking with each other." Zhang Jiqi said, "This should work."

Zhou Bili nodded: "So that's how it is! But the area of the ship bottom isn't small. Copper sheet consumption definitely won't be small."

"This is the Planning Agency's affair. I think there are always some reserves of copper material." Jiang Ye drank a bottle of iced Kvass in one gulp. "Besides, our rolling mill should be stronger than the British; the copper plates rolled out will be thinner."
