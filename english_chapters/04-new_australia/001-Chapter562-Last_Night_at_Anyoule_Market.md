# Chapter 562 - Last Night at Anyoule Market

Dawn was approaching, but the night remained thick. The light from oil lamps and torches in shops and homes along the street cast a faint glow onto the gravel road. There was still light in the taverns, small eateries, and brothels, with occasional bursts of revelry. The merchants, managers, and sailors from ships wintering here to catch the trade winds and stranded in this remote "edge of the world" had nothing to do all day but spend their energy and time on wine and women.

Hu Xun wore a silk robe and a cloak, heedless of the predawn chill, striding proudly down the center of Anyoule Market's only main street. Behind him followed an odd procession: a handsome young page carrying a teapot wrapped in a cotton-padded brocade cover, next to a man with the long gown and beard of a private secretary. Behind them, a servant carried a folding chair on his shoulder. Another held a bamboo strip—an instrument of punishment. Then came a squad of militia armed with clubs, swords, and spears.

Hu Xun was performing his duty as the local *baocheng*—night patrol. Questioning any suspicious persons. Though Anyoule Market was small, public order was a serious problem. This place regularly saw large crowds of people who made their living at sea. Once released from the tedium and exhaustion of life at sea, relaxing on land, theft, quarrels, brawls, and even stabbings were common occurrences. At peak times, several people died in fights every day.

Hu Xun didn't report deaths to the county—that would only invite trouble, and the county couldn't solve it anyway. Once you left the town, this was wilderness. A few dozen *li* out, you were in Li tribal territory—where would you chase down murderers?

But as a prominent figure in the area, he still had to maintain basic order. Every night, Hu Xun personally led patrols through the streets. Anyone drunk and rowdy, or carrying knives and clubs, was detained first. This also brought in some income—ship captains had to pay to get their men released. If no one came forward to bail out some penniless wretch, that was no problem either—when the next wave of ships arrived, they'd sell the man off. Ships had extremely high mortality rates; losing a third of the crew on a single voyage wasn't unusual, so managers were happy to stock up on extra hands.

Tonight, Anyoule Market was quiet, but quiet didn't mean peaceful. As the last stop before heading to the Southern Seas, Anyoule Market looked quite profitable to certain people. Hu Xun's top priority in preventing theft was screening suspicious persons—pirates might well send scouts to find an opportunity to "open the gates."

Especially as dawn approached—when the sky was still dark and the night watchmen were tired and drowsy—that was when surprise attacks were most likely to succeed. So at this hour, Hu Xun always came out personally to patrol.

Walking from the end of the street to the head, he climbed up the west gate watchtower. Several militiamen stood bleary-eyed, keeping watch over Dadonghai Bay. A few storm lanterns swayed in the sea breeze. Hu Xun leaned against the wooden palisade wall and gazed outward. Lights burned at the dock below the palisade, and riding lights were lit on the various ships. The vessels rose and fell with the sea, and all he could hear was the sound of waves crashing against rocks and ships.

Across the bay, a few points of light were visible—that was the fortification built last year by the Lingao sea merchants. Although the two sides traded goods and dealt with each other, exchanging smiles, Hu Xun secretly remained extremely wary, fearing they had ulterior motives.

Yet throughout all these months, the number of people inside the compound never exceeded thirty. Every day they went out early and returned late—either growing vegetables, raising chickens, and fishing for their own sustenance, or harvesting coconuts and cutting timber. Their activities had brought vitality to Anyoule Market. Many impoverished local villagers were employed by them to cut timber and harvest coconuts, selling their labor for daily wages. And the people from the compound across the bay occasionally came to Anyoule Market to purchase goods and hire craftsmen.

But Hu Xun was certain of one thing: Manager Wang's claim that they were merchants specializing in the Southern Seas trade had been a lie. Almost every week, ships docked at the pier in front of "Lingao Stockade," carrying away coconuts, raw timber, and other local products, bringing in uniformly sized crates.

Hu Xun had never been to the Southern Seas, but he'd seen countless passing merchants. He knew a bit about conditions there. Timber and coconuts were even more worthless in those parts, so obviously the cargo wasn't being shipped south.

He was almost certain this group was dealing in contraband goods. As for exactly what, he didn't care—as long as everyone minded their own business, why pry into others' affairs?

"Any unusual activity?" Hu Xun asked the watch commander on the tower.

"Nothing unusual. All is peaceful."

The night sea breeze was rather biting. Hu Xun couldn't help pulling his cloak tighter. The moon was about to set; phosphorescent plankton flickered on and off across the sea's surface. Nothing appeared amiss.

"Make sure everyone stays alert. No falling asleep on duty!" With that, Hu Xun descended from the tower to go cuddle with his concubine.

Less than ten nautical miles away, Ruan Xiaowu, captain of Special Service Boat "Yu-Te-04," observed through binoculars the long column of vessels breaking waves behind him. A full fifty ships.

In front of him were fast single-masted sailing vessels. Their light hulls heeled over in the wind and waves, nearly touching the water's surface. Several times Ruan Xiaowu thought they were about to capsize, but at the critical moment, the bow always swung around. It kept viewers constantly on edge.

These single-masted cutters were all crewed by petty officers in training and the most daring, skilled sailors. They operated these fast, agile small craft ahead and on the flanks of the fleet, constantly probing for abnormalities. Behind the fast cutters came a long column of special service boats of various types, loaded with weapons, sailors, and all manner of supplies packed into their holds.

Then came the spectacular five-masted great sailing ship *Sanya No. 1*. Its five great masts spread their enormous sails, standing out prominently in the fleet. Together with the less impressive ships around it, it carried thousands of laborers, soldiers, building materials, tools, vehicles, and grain.

But it wasn't the core; the true core came behind: those vessels mysterious to ordinary natives, requiring neither sails nor oars, breaking through the waves. The *Xunjing* self-propelled barge, the *Dajing* flat-deck barge, the Type 67 landing craft, and two 8154 fishing trawlers. *Xunjing*'s broad deck was piled high with strangely shaped large objects tightly wrapped in oilcloth. The landing command headquarters was established aboard one of the fishing trawlers.

On the starboard side of all these ships was another formation: led by the *Zhenhai* and *Fubo*, six three-masted sailing warships proceeding in column formation, their gun ports shut tight.

Ruan Xiaowu felt proud to be sailing in such a magnificent fleet. True, there were maritime lords with more ships than the Australian leaders, but what were their ships compared to these? Filthy, decrepit decks; patched-together sails; crude cannons—few and far between—actually tied down with rope. When fired, the cannons might even jump and do somersaults in the air! Gunpowder was heaped haphazardly below deck, and scrap metal serving as shot was stored in baskets, mixed in with pebbles and broken pottery shards! That's exactly what the captured pirate ships looked like when the Naval cadets inspected them. Every cadet had worn a scornful smile—a bunch of bumpkins.

On the flagship, the future Sanya Special Zone's main leadership was crammed into the command room converted from the former freezer hold. The 8154's displacement wasn't large, and the hull pitched considerably in the waves. Zhuo Tianmin's seasickness was severe, so he simply lay on a long bench for the meeting.

The four of them crowded around a small table. In two more hours, dawn would break, and the landing operation would officially commence.

Although this wasn't an opposed landing, with no artillery, minefields, or machine guns on shore, coordinating a force of this scale to land on an unfamiliar coast remained a formidable task. The fleet was laden with all manner of supplies, equipment, and personnel; getting them safely ashore was complex and delicate work.

To prepare for this crucial all-out landing, detailed planning had been underway for almost a month. A joint working group composed of the General Staff and the Planning Council, under Wang Luobin's direct leadership, had developed detailed procedures for the landing plan.

The problems they faced were incredibly complex—while such landings had many military precedents, the transmigrator collective was doing this in the seventeenth century, with extremely limited modern support capabilities. It was even more complex than D-Day. On D-Day, they'd only had five hundred people; now they had to land three thousand!

They had a heap of questions to resolve. Where should they land? When was best? How many people should be in the first wave? How many laborers, how many soldiers? How many vessels were needed to transport these people? How many days' worth of dry rations needed to be prepared before the mobile kitchens could fully provide hot meals? How many people would land via small boats, how many via piers, and how should they be organized for staged disembarkation? Rope ladders were needed to get from ship to pier or small boat—how many small boats were needed? How should these small boats be transported?

These were merely a small fraction of the many questions the planners had to answer. There were many, many more. By the time their plan was finalized, it had become a thick tome. Every detail of Project Giant was meticulously specified, with corresponding contingency plans for possible problems.

"When formulating the plan, don't first think about what to do if you win—first think about how to pick up the pieces if you fail." Wang Luobin had made this requirement at the working group meetings.

"Who could defeat us?" Those involved in planning found this inconceivable. "The militiamen of Anyoule Market?"

"Consider all possible situations," Wang Luobin said. "For example, the fleet encounters a major storm and half the ships sink; or we're in the middle of landing and Zheng Zhilong's fleet attacks... All of these must be considered."

"How discouraging—thinking about this before we've even started..."

"Whatever you do, you must consider the worst possibilities," Dongmen Chuiyu expressed support for Engineer Wang's view. "How to respond to contingencies is an important part of our planning. The more thoroughly everyone thinks it through, the better."
