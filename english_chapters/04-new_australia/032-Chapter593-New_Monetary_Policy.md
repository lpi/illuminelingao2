# Chapter 593 - New Monetary Policy

Yi Fan said: "I dare not agree with his line of thought. First, the Pound and US Dollar are founded on the basis that they were primarily manufacturing powerhouses. Our current production capacity has high efficiency but low total volume. Most of the limited capacity and products must be invested in self-upgrading—in the short term, we can't even effectively meet the industrial consumer goods demand of the Chinese mainland, so relying solely on selling Lingao's goods to support large-scale export of credit paper money is hard. As for using force to make currency circulate, that's even more impossible."

"I don't approve either; Director Ma's thinking is still that planned economy panacea stuff," Wu Di said. "He just indefinitely belittles the role of financial instruments. It's nothing more than the model from decades ago where the whole country only had the People's Bank acting as both central bank and retail bank, and later the People's Bank retreated to the second line, creating four specialized banks to take over."

"Let's put aside this issue for now and discuss the new monetary policy," Chen Ce said. "Planned economy, we are originally a planned economy, and a planned economy more planned than Soviet Revisionism."

"Monetary policy is a 'menstrual' issue; not a month goes by without people talking nonsense about this on the BBS. Everyone wants to be an economist," Yi Fan said. "I see the Executive Committee already has a head as big as a bucket on this issue—first, they know there are problems with grain circulation notes; second, they don't know what to replace them with; third, and a fundamental problem, too many opinions."

Wu Di said: "From our perspective, basically copying the silver standard system is the most operational stable system right now. Easy to implement, and commoners can accept it."

The current system was obviously an unsustainable temporary measure, so with the idea of being prepared, people in the fiscal and financial department had held multiple working meetings on this issue, and differences still existed to this day.

Chen Ce said: "We are a service department; we can't act against the Executive Committee on this matter. The production and sales departments are the dominant ones; we only coordinate with their work to solve problems existing in the great cause of transmigration, forecasting five to ten years ahead at most."

"Alright, blab about your plan." Everyone present knew Chen Ce was actually commissioned by the Executive Committee to draft the new monetary system. His speech meant setting the tone.

"Current theories are strange and varied, but boiling down, they are largely two lines of thought," Chen Ce said. "One is the silver standard, two is pure credit currency. Both have benefits. I personally feel that given Lingao's current situation, we can implement a credit currency system linked to silver."

"I feel using a silver standard at this stage is very good, convenient, intuitive, and credit is guaranteed," Wu Di said. "Referencing the use of Spanish Pillar Dollars in China: silver coins with only 90% fineness are actually more useful than scattered silver of 92.5% fineness in real circulation because they are beautifully minted and easy to value. In many cases, a 0.72 tael silver dollar can be used as one tael in transactions! Minting itself can generate profit. Also, you have to consider foreign trade demand; without silver, you simply can't buy goods."

"Mechanized silver dollars," Yi Fan said. "Once circulated out, they will definitely become objects of hoarding for mainland landlords. Bad money drives out good money; must guard against this. China's silver black hole is not called that for nothing."

"It's fine; let them hoard. Anyway, they always have to bring silver to buy things in Lingao. Outflow and inflow balancing is good enough. According to our development momentum, the future will probably see a serious trade surplus with severe inflation," Wu Di said.

"Probably not that simple. What we need most are bulk goods. Merchants selling bulk raw materials may not want to buy anything from us. They will leave directly with silver, instead of purchasing our goods to take away. Besides, what they take away is standard silver dollars, but what they bring may not be 92.5% silver. Everyone tends to spend the worst currency."

"Correct, the role of silver for us is equivalent to foreign exchange." Chen Ce tapped his teacup with a pencil. "What about our circulation notes? actually, they are RMB before the 90s. The Executive Committee really hopes circulation notes can circulate on a large scale, but in fact, this is impossible—at least temporarily impossible. Despite various measures, the quantity retained in the hands of foreign merchants is still limited. Circulation notes have no purchasing power outside Lingao. Foreign merchants will only choose to either accept silver or spend all circulation notes."

"You want to link currency with silver?" Yi Fan immediately grasped his meaning.

"Correct. Denying the value of silver is wrong, at least wrong now. Let's first look at where our problems lie?"

He opened his notebook:

"First is the scarcity of raw materials. Except for steel which will soon be self-sufficient in the short term, everything else relies almost entirely on imports; second, export products rely almost entirely on indigenous channels; third, the controlled population is too small."

"This is very similar to the early British!"

"Correct, but our burden is much greater than the British," Chen Ce said. "Britain only needed a sufficient navy, while we have to simultaneously build and maintain a strong army. Army, navy, merchant fleet; constantly expanding administrative and technical teams; large-scale basic education... All these require huge investments. And our productivity? Unfortunately, the majority of industrial goods produced in Lingao must be used for infrastructure construction and expanding new capacity, with only a small portion for export. Maintaining the balance of payments in the current account..."

Yi Fan coughed. Chen Ce realized he was discussing national secrets. He said, "Everyone understands my meaning."

Yi Fan said: "Of course, in the foreseeable future, Lingao's industrial production capacity is insufficient to effectively meet even East Asia's demand for industrial consumer goods, so exporting grain circulation notes is impossible; people won't recognize them. So, actually, there is only one answer—copy history's method, temporarily promote paper money based on the silver standard, especially since this is the only precious metal we can master in large quantities and is recognized by everyone."

"No, this is too wasteful!" Chen Ce saw he spoke a lot but was directly tampered with by Yi Fan. "It's credit currency linked to silver exchange rates!" He continued, "The existence of silver circulation in Lingao's domestic economic activities is itself a waste of resources!"

"Use silver dollar certificates," Wu Di said. "No silver dollars seen on the market, just stipulate one dollar paper money exchanges for one silver dollar; or do an incomplete silver standard. Stipulate the silver content of banknotes but limit the amount of silver exchange. Avoid a situation of sudden run and inability to exchange."

"If I had to choose one of two, I'd rather choose the first. The second will only accelerate credit bankruptcy given our low credit. If it cannot be exchanged for silver 100%, what meaning is there in stipulating silver content? If one day a big merchant comes to exchange a large sum of circulation notes, and you say 'Sorry, this exceeds the exchange limit. You better buy goods back.' Do you think he will understand what is an incomplete silver standard with restricted exchange? He won't." Chen Ce emphasized his tone, "He only knows one fact: circulation notes can't be exchanged for silver anymore. Then everyone doing business with us will know this, and our banknote credit is finished. If it can't be exchanged, simply don't stipulate how much silver content it has."

"You are making a Great Leap Forward." Yi Fan knocked on the table. "Let's not mention if your so-called credit currency can be realized, first talk about how big Lingao's economic scale is? You have to know that without knowing the total economic scale, you can't talk about total currency issuance. Can't print money according to demand, or we'll be Chiang Kai-shek the Second."

"Isn't the accounting of Lingao's economic scale your responsibility?" Chen Ce kicked the ball back directly. "The Ministry of Finance has issued a document requiring all departments to establish a primary financial system. This thing, train indigenous accounting personnel a bit, and they can pick it up quickly."

"Hard!" Yi Fan said just this one word. "Very hard. I have no one to do auditing now; talking about this is simply delusion." He drank some tea. "Just accounting alone is enough to make you faint."

"Let's discuss this later; I'll continue discussing my line of thought." Chen Ce continued discussing his monetary policy. "Simply put, currently we can imitate the Celestial Dynasty's monetary system. Prohibit precious metal circulation within the terriroty. Not only foreign merchants, but commercial activities within the controlled area must also all switch to circulation notes. Except for using circulation notes, no one can buy anything. Through withdrawing precious metals and redemption, gradually master all precious metals in the controlled area into the hands of the Transmigration Group to reserve and use as foreign exchange. Paper money hooks to silver at a managed fixed exchange rate. This is not the same as the silver standard; the exchange rate between silver and circulation notes only has meaning in trade."

"I understand your meaning." Yi Fan said, "To sum up: use circulation notes entirely within the Transmigration Group's controlled area; foreign small merchants exchange for circulation notes through designated banks to buy Lingao products; bulk trade transactions are all priced in circulation notes but settled in currencies acceptable to the other party, completed by specialized agencies; foreign trade enterprises within the Transmigration Group's controlled area trade externally through designated banks, priced in circulation notes; circulation notes will no longer solely use the grain standard but hook to a basket of basic agro-industrial products; circulation notes will designate an exchange rate with silver."

"Roughly so." Chen Ce said. "The key to this policy is to enforce mandatory settlement and sale of foreign exchange. Under the influence of Lingao's infrastructure, technology, and policy, a batch of domestic joint ventures and wholly-owned enterprises will inevitably be born. The silver and gold earned from their exports must be mandatorily settled at Delung Bank; for their domestic consumption, expanding production, and recruiting labor, circulation notes are enough; silver needed for their imports is sold only after Delung's approval. Of course, with the outflow of circulation notes, certain daily consumption circulation will also occur in overseas locations like Guangzhou and Leizhou. Different from deposit slips, circulation notes in Li Luoyou's hands can purchase certain consumer services and products from Lingao-controlled enterprises in Guangzhou. But this amount will be very limited in the near future, with little significance."

"Your thing is essentially still a disguised silver standard. Only you are now using mandatory foreign exchange settlement to control financial risks within the Lingao economy. You have to be clear on one point: industrial products are priced in currency, not currency priced in industrial products. For Lingao, the biggest and most important imports now are coal, iron, and grain. Once Hongji and Tiandu production capacities are normal, the most important import will be people. Mines use slave labor; enterprises and agriculture use people imported from the mainland. As long as we don't fall out with Great Ming, how much can refugees cost? Ultimately it's a grain problem. And the possibility of self-solving the grain problem is high. Lingao will inevitably have a trade surplus in the long run; what needs consideration will only be inflation capability. This closed economy can only prevent itself from being played to death by inflation through capital export and technology diffusion."

"This is a problem to consider later," Chen Ce said. "The fact at this stage is we have a deficit. And this deficit will exist for quite a long time."

"Your system still relies on constantly increasing silver reserves in the early stage. Otherwise, the risk remains huge." Ji An recorded for a long time in his notebook. "The problem is our export growth recently isn't very ideal."

"After the First Five-Year Plan, when light industry capacity comes up, trade will definitely be a surplus. I'm not very worried about this."

"Fine, actually it boils down to one fundamental question: what is Lingao's economic scale? The issuance scale of bank notes can't be calculated based on silver reserves, but based on Lingao's economic scale."

"Doesn't this still need you to labor over?" Chen Ce said with a smile.

"Fine, fine. If your policy passes, I have to talk to Cheng Dong. Must expand the accounting office stall. Best create a Statistics Bureau too, enforce a unified financial accounting system," He thought for a moment. "Currency is singly hooked to silver. Gold coins follow market prices."

"Correct."

"Let's do it this way for now. In the long run, silver is unsuitable as currency." Yi Fan stretched his body. "Silver volume is still too large. Ideally, a gold standard—or stainless steel standard or the like is better."

Wu Di said: "Speaking of stainless steel standard, there's another thing. regardless of what plan the Executive Committee ultimately implements, I strongly demand enforcing a unified legal tender in Lingao, cancelling the circulation of various silver and copper coins currently. Circulation in the market is too chaotic now. Silver, copper cash, circulation notes. Copper cash and silver fineness vary; bank conversion is too hard."

"This matter, Director Ma discussed multiple times, but he started from industrial needs. Mainly to reclaim copper cash—there is little silver in Lingao's daily circulation. Copper cash is the bulk. But even the most inferior copper cash contains a large amount of lead. Isn't it better to spend it and use it as metal?"

"If you ask me, might as well ship it directly to Southeast Asia. This kind of inferior small cash is the most widely used currency in Southeast Asia. Some maritime merchants specifically traffic this to Manila."

"The reality is we need subsidiary currency most; circulation links also need small denomination subsidiary currency most." Wu Di said. "Subsidiary currency is best minted in metal. The 1-fen, 5-fen, 10-fen paper notes used now aren't ideal; common people aren't used to them. Copper cash still circulates a lot for small payments."

Several people pondered for a moment. Continuing to mint copper cash was best, but this was a strategic material; demand was huge for both military industry and power industry. And copper's self-lubricating property made it more useful in trans-industrial applications. Lingao's copper reserves were low to begin with; the Planning Agency definitely wouldn't agree. Nor could they issue iron coins—this thing's status in people's minds was too low. And eras issuing iron coins were generally not good; it belonged to currencies with bad reputations.

"How about issuing steel coins? Like RMB. Shiny, looks similar to silver. Let's call it 'Mithril'!" Wu Di devised a plan.

"RMB uses stainless steel. Ordinary steel stamped coins look okay at first, but rust before long. Commoners know it's iron at a glance; you'll get a reputation for forgery. Not advisable."

"What does making stainless steel require?" Yi Fan had long designed on stainless steel coins. If he had this "Mithril," why bullshit so much? Just use a stainless steel standard directly. Anyway, only the Transmigration Group could make stainless steel; not a gram of stainless steel existed in this spacetime. Issuance and use didn't need to consider external factors. And "Mithril" looked good, wasn't light; replacing silver if done well wasn't impossible!

"Needs nickel."

"Do we have this stuff?"

"For non-ferrous metals, the Holy Ship basically brought a little reserve of everything—including quite a bit of stainless steel. But the Executive Committee bunch won't possibly bring it out for minting—according to these engineers' plans, best to use silver in industry too."

"As long as there's a suitable substitute, I don't object." Yi Fan said. "Can nickel be imported?"

"Have to import from Southeast Asia, might even have to mine it ourselves—these days everything has to be done ourselves. Seemingly Guangdong area also has it. But making stainless steel probably isn't that simple."

"We can report it up. Let the industrial department solve it." Yi Fan said. "Right, we can also do aluminum coins. Aluminum products were very strong back then, priced comparable to silver. As long as we control output, it can also act as Mithril."

"Aluminum coins are too light, and don't look good after a long time. I quite like the stainless steel concept." Wu Di said. "If I knew earlier, should have brought more one-yuan and one-jiao RMB. Issue and use directly. New coins don't have country names; don't even need explanation."

"Too heavy. Rather than bring that, better to bring more stainless steel; at least you can define denomination and size yourself."

"Alright. We'll take two plans up. Subsidiary currency problem must be solved."

Everyone reached a basic consensus on this issue. The next step was to decide various details in the working meeting and formulate a plan. This plan had to be reported to the Executive Committee for discussion, and after passing, sent to the Senate Standing Committee for approval. The latter was basically a formality.

"On the Executive Committee side, Director Ma's attitude is hard to say." Chen Ce said to Yi Fan, "He is very indifferent to the comprehensive accounting of the economic system you proposed."
