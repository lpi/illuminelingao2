# Chapter 671 - Lai Da's Journey of the Heart

Though outwardly confident, he was inwardly deeply uneasy. He and Gou Chengxuan knew all too well how powerful the bald bandits were. The imperial army would need hard fighting just to pressure them into leaving. The gentry probably shared this view—otherwise they wouldn't refuse even token, hedge-betting gestures that cost nothing and kept escape routes open.

So Lai Da waited bitterly. But what came was not victory but news of the imperial army's catastrophic defeat at Chengmai. The Lai brothers, who had been waiting to become the "Returned Homeland Corps," were thunderstruck. As captured spoils streamed continuously back from Chengmai, the two fell into utter despair.

Their options now reduced to two: flee back to Qiongshan to stay by their master's side, living precariously day by day, waiting for a chance to rise again; or quietly settle down in Lingao—where finding a livelihood was easy enough for anyone willing to work.

The Lai brothers discussed privately for a long time but couldn't decide. While wavering, Lai Da one day spotted Chu Qing at the farm gate.

Chu Qing had completely changed to Australian dress. Had her face not happened to turn toward the construction site at that moment, he might not have recognized her.

She glanced absently in Lai Da's direction, and his heart nearly stopped—she had grown so beautiful! Lai Da had always thought Chu Qing attractive, but after years apart, she was radiant.

This brief encounter made Lai Da unwilling to leave. He not only abandoned thoughts of leaving Lingao but also violated his earlier principle of avoiding busy locations and main roads. He began frequently passing by the farm gate, hoping to see Chu Qing again—if possible, to exchange a few words.

But Chu Qing rarely appeared—there was endless work to do at the farm. She was not only Wu Nanhai's "life secretary" but also managed many small matters there. Very busy. Lai Da came several times without seeing her. So he took work as a day laborer hauling and digging dirt at the construction site—working while waiting for Chu Qing to appear.

He worked more than ten days straight without seeing her again. One day, unable to bear his lovesickness, Lai Da—as if possessed—approached an "Australian bald bandit" walking out of the farm.

Learning that Chu Qing was indeed at the farm, Lai Da was overjoyed. Though he had lived a precarious, wandering existence these years, he had never stopped thinking of his "bride-to-be." He yearned for the day when he would drive out and kill the bald bandit who had seized his woman. Reclaiming his woman had been the spiritual pillar sustaining him through adversity.

When the imperial forces gathered at Qiongshan, preparing their great expedition with clouds gathering, Lai Da had calculated and recalculated: once the bald bandits fled, how should he deal with Chu Qing after reclaiming her?

Having been taken by a bald bandit—whether as servant or concubine—she was probably no longer pure. After Lingao's conquest, Lai Da would be a meritorious contributor to the imperial victory. Plenty of fine women would be his for the choosing—perhaps even a wealthy family's daughter. He couldn't marry such "spoiled goods" properly. But he was a man of feeling and principle. Chu Qing's loss of chastity was more the bald bandit's fault than hers. It would be appropriate to keep her as a concubine out of sentiment and propriety.

Lai Da had many times fantasized about how Chu Qing would kneel before him, begging; how grateful she would be after he pardoned her...

News of the imperial army's catastrophic defeat at Qiongshan shattered his daydream. Lai Da's feelings for Chu Qing reverted to "bride-to-be." His longing intensified daily.

Now, blood boiling, Lai Da wished he could rush into the farm immediately, meet Chu Qing, pour out his heart, and then flee with her far away—forgetting Young Master Gou Er, the bald bandits, the court, the imperial army... The farm's walls weren't high, but the dense hedge looked difficult to cross. Bald bandit sentries stood guard at the gate—sneaking in wouldn't be easy...

Lai Da's reverie lasted an hour before he awoke. Ancients lacked modern concepts of time. They also underestimated the reaction speed of modern-style violence systems. He knew he shouldn't linger, but his definition of "linger" was measured in days.

Lai Da was taken to the Political Security Bureau's Investigation Division and thrown into an interrogation room.

The investigating officer was a native investigator named Wu Ming. He had been a caravan guard whose fighting was too brutal for escort-agency work. After being fired by multiple agencies, he was recruited by Guangzhou Station personnel who had heard of him. Sent to Lingao, he first served as police. Ran Yao considered him shrewd, capable, decisive, and ruthless—a rare "hawk and hound" type who, properly trained, would make excellent claws and fangs. After the Political Security Bureau was established, he was transferred in as an action-team member. When Zhao Manxiong became First Deputy Director, he quickly became an investigator.

Under his sharp, relentless questioning, the unprepared Lai Da contradicted himself, quickly exposing countless holes. He tried to respond with silence, but when two burly men entered carrying unfamiliar implements with obscene, suggestive smiles, he immediately spoke in terror.

The investigator learned his name was Chen Da; he had worked as a servant elsewhere and, after being dismissed, had just returned to Lingao. He had no ID. Seeing inspectors, he feared getting into trouble. As for why he had asked about Chu Qing, Lai Da couldn't hide it. He said vaguely she was an old neighbor; he had seen her on the road and wanted to ask how she was doing—nothing more.

This story was plausible. Normally it might have passed muster. But Wu Mu had already ordered Gou Buli summoned to identify the prisoner from a secret room next to the interrogation chamber. He immediately recognized the man: this was Lai Da.

The investigator opened the "Wanted Roster." On the second page, Lai Da's name appeared prominently, marked "Level One."

"Caught ourselves a big fish." Wu Ming immediately called Wu Mu.

Wu Mu was very satisfied. Capturing Lai Da had little practical value, but if it led to the escaped Gou Er father and son, the transmigrators' reputation for omnipotence would rise another level.

"Very good," Wu Mu said briefly. "Well done."

"Serving the transmigrators and the people, Director!"

"Now you may continue your service. In ten minutes, a document will arrive. You must pry his mouth open following the outline it contains."

"Understood, Director!"

Wu Mu hung up. With Lai Da captured, Gou Chengxuan might well be active in Lingao or Chengmai. He immediately drafted orders for searches in both places.

The search, of course, didn't find Gou Chengxuan. He was neither in Lingao nor Chengmai—nor even in precarious Qiongshan. Knowing the imperial army was utterly unreliable and that all of Hainan would fall eventually, Gou Chengxuan had long since fled back to the mainland.

Under interrogation, Lai Da revealed everything: Gou Chengxuan's activities in Guangzhou; his scheme to ally with the Huang family against the bald bandits... He also confessed that Gou Er's father, Gou Xunli, was in Lingao.

But no matter how hard they pressed, Lai Da couldn't give Gou Xunli's exact location—only that he was "in the mountains."

"In the mountains!" Wu Mu thought this was useless. Lingao's mountainous areas were vast, connecting with neighboring counties and the Li regions. The mountains were densely vegetated with thickets and scrub. During bandit suppression, that was manageable—large bandit gangs had to come down for food. But catching someone like Gou Xunli with just a handful of people would be very difficult. He could easily retreat to Danzhou to rest, then return to Lingao.

It wasn't that the transmigrators absolutely couldn't catch him—just that the cost-benefit ratio didn't justify making it a "special case."

Wu Mu felt somewhat disappointed. Seeing nothing more useful to extract, he ordered Lai Da detained pending disposition.

"Report, Director," Wu Ming said. "Lai Da requests to see Chu Qing."

"Chu Qing?" Wu Mu had learned from the confession that Lai Da's capture was closely tied to his unceasing longing for Chu Qing.

If a meeting could produce more substantive, valuable intelligence, he would certainly arrange it. But now, Lai Da had been squeezed dry. Letting him see Chu Qing had no value and would only cause trouble—what if the girl still had feelings for him? That would upset Wu Nanhai, and Wu Nanhai's displeasure would surely be blamed on the Political Security Bureau. Most inappropriate.

"No." Wu Mu organized the interrogation report. He had already made up his mind: Lai Da was no longer useful. Better to make him disappear quickly. Otherwise, his former engagement to Chu Qing would become very unpleasant.

Thinking this, he said sternly to Wu Ming: "All interrogation records regarding Lai Da are to be consolidated here with me. Also, the contents of this interrogation are to be kept completely confidential. Understood?"

"Yes!" Wu Ming didn't know exactly what had happened, but seeing the chief's stern expression, he sensed some earth-shattering secret and grew very nervous. "I will absolutely maintain secrecy, Director!"

"Yes, I believe you will do very well," Wu Mu said. "I now congratulate you on receiving a commendation signed by Division Chief Zhou."

"Serving the transmigrators and the people!" Wu Ming snapped to attention.

After Wu Ming left, Wu Mu reviewed the materials. After much deliberation, he removed Lai Da's confession regarding his engagement to Chu Qing and compiled a revised version. Then he called Zhao Manxiong.

"...Yes, yes. I've removed it. Should I destroy the original?" Wu Mu asked over the phone.

"The original interrogation record must be preserved and filed. Otherwise, if anyone ever reviews the case, there'd be no way to explain what you removed." Instructions came from the other end.

"Yes, I understand."

The next day, Lai Da was transferred to the Arbitration Court's Special Tribunal for prosecution as a "war criminal."
