# Chapter 599 - Black Dragon Society

"If it's Jiangnan, it's nothing more than Nanjing, Suzhou, Yangzhou, and Songjiang, these few places." Yu E-shui said, "Actually, for planting in Songjiang, one can choose Shanghai County. Songjiang itself is an industrial and agricultural city. Although producing large amounts of cloth, its value in commercial shipping is not as big as the port of Shanghai County."

"What about Beijing?"

Jiang Shan said: "For Beijing, Delung Bank will definitely go to plant a station. Yan Ming is also planning the business of absorbing illicit money from corrupt officials and eunuchs. Our Intelligence Bureau should also open a small shop or something to inquire about first-hand news of the court."

"We shouldn't forget Liaodong." Strange light emitted from Lin Baiguang's eyes, "Relying completely on Li Luoyou as a middleman isn't very secure. Besides, this person may not be fully trusted. We send people directly to master first-hand materials locally. If necessary, setting up a commercial station is also deserved."

"Going to Liaodong for long-term stationing requires shaving heads and keeping pigtails; no one is willing."

"Sending someone to look first is also good; not necessarily long-term stationing." Jiang Shan thought, whether long-term stationing was possible was still a big question mark.

With plans settled, Jiang Shan organized the issues discussed at the meeting into a document to report to Ma Qianzhu.

After reading the report, Ma Qianzhu asked a few more questions, then said:

"I have no objection to you filling up personnel. Go to the Organization Department to see how many people are willing to transfer to the Intelligence Bureau. Also, the Organization Department recently issued a document regarding the staffing of various departments. Look at it first and write a staffing table."

"Yes, I'll go in a while." Jiang Shan knew Secretary Ma was a leader particular about "Soviet-style comrade etiquette," liking brief, crisp answers and neat expressions.

"Personnel staffing includes not only Elders but also indigenous personnel." Ma Qianzhu said, "Discuss this issue more. This involves next year's fiscal budget problem—starting next year, all administrative institutions must have budget and final accounts. Have a number in your heart."

"Understood!" Jiang Shan nodded crisply. "There are a few things I obtain instructions on."

"Speak."

"The 'Government-Supervised, Merchant-Managed' collection line of thought mentioned in the intelligence activity plan submitted, and setting up stations on the mainland," he said, "This all involves how to handle the business relationship with the Colonial and Trade Ministry."

Although intelligence personnel could use various covers, merchants were after all the most common and easiest cover identity, and could establish commercial networks on the mainland thereby, killing two birds with one stone.

"I have to discuss this matter with the Vice Minister of the Colonial and Trade Ministry." Ma Qianzhu said, "Since both sides benefit, newly opened commercial stations should be invested by them suitably. You doing intelligence is just a side matter."

"Yes, that's what I thought too." Jiang Shan was very happy seeing the Governor Director accurately identify the key part of his words and express approval.

"As for whether to send people to Liaodong, my personal opinion is there is no need. Since we have Li Luoyou as our middleman, why send another Elder? Redundant effort. The Later Jin total plate is just so big; smash it lightly and it's shattered. Who cares what Huang Taiji, Dorgon, Da Yu'er, Xiao Yu'er think."

"I feel clarifying the situation in Liaodong has certain significance for future military operations to conquer Liaodong." Jiang Shan said, "My idea is to imitate the activities of Japanese Ronin, collecting basic intelligence on Liaodong's geography, weather, walled villages, commerce, population, etc., to provide intelligence support for future military action and comprehensive elimination. Long term, there is no need to send Elders, but in the early stage, an Elder should be sent to sit in command."

"If you feel there is this necessity, and there is an Elder willing to shave his head and take this risk, I don't oppose—lest people say we don't respect public opinion." Ma Qianzhu expressed indifference, "But the person going must be approved by the Organization Department. Talents with certain special skills cannot go."

"Okay." Jiang Shan felt a chill. He had a feeling he couldn't say out loud: Governor Ma saw Elders basically no different from indigenous people.

"Regarding dispatched intelligence stations," Jiang Shan continued reporting, "besides overseas stations in cooperation with the Colonial and Trade Ministry, I plan to establish a separate system, which I call the 'Black Dragon Society' system."

Ma Qianzhu put on an uninterested look: regardless if you are Black Dragon Society or White Dragon Society, or Red Flower Society, he knew Jiang Shan's intention very well—nothing more than asking for funds.

Doing intelligence costs money, and large amounts of money. Circulation coupons can't be used. Gotta use handfuls of silver or goods exchangeable for silver. Silver now has the status of "Foreign Exchange," requiring application case by case. Procedures are very troublesome.

Jiang Shan continued talking perseveringly: "The Black Dragon Society organization is a non-governmental organization. Funded by private capital under the Transmigration Group system to set up stations everywhere on the mainland. The Intelligence Bureau only dispatches key personnel to lurk inside for command. Can even consider recruiting intelligence and action personnel locally on the mainland..."

He talked for over ten minutes about the organizational system and operation mode of this Black Dragon Society. Ma Qianzhu then spoke:

"Have you considered which capitalists in Lingao will be the funders of the Black Dragon Society?"

The government-supervised, merchant-managed idea of the Black Dragon Society was not bad. The problem was overseas stations were Transmigration Group property, cooperable by an executive order from the Executive Committee. But private capitalists, their only thought was pursuing profit. Without sufficient profit, who would take this risk to join some Black Dragon Society!

"I have considered well. One is Lin Quan'an's Quanfu Firm. Lin Quan'an made his fortune relying on shouldering bulk purchases for us. Now that our supply system is gradually perfect and the foreign trade system is established, the days of him obtaining profits relying on early monopoly supplier status will end sooner or later. He will inevitably choose to transform." Jiang Shan had done research. Lin Quan'an's orders from the Transmigration Group were decreasing recently, and profits were much smaller. Of course, he obtained a part of profit compensation from the rapidly expanding local population, but overall he was in a downward trend.

Jiang Shan believed: Lin Quan'an was currently anxious to find new commercial outlets. Cooperating with him was very possible.

"Lin Quan'an already has extensive commercial connections everywhere in Hainan, but the Hainan market is small. Many materials originally purchased by him have become directly acquired by ourselves, so he has the intention to go out to develop on the mainland."

"Mm." Ma Qianzhu gained a bit of interest, "Go on."

"The reason Lin Quan'an delays moving is mainly because he feels he lacks backing on the mainland. After all, his fortune relied on us, and we also provided convoy protection for his commercial development. Once on the mainland detached from Lingao's power, he has no confidence in this.

"So I prepare to utilize this psychology of his, making him fully feel we haven't forgotten him, our interests are bundled with him, and moreover, there will be a powerful organization supporting him behind the scenes. Lin Quan'an will be willing to become a member of the Black Dragon Society."

"Very good." Ma Qianzhu commented simply, "What else."

"Of course Runshitang."

"You are catching all Lingao capitalists in one net."

"Yes," Jiang Shan said, "Liu San of the Ministry of Health had a memo regarding establishing Great Ming's 'Watson's' chain pharmacies relying on Runshitang.

"Runshitang's proprietor Yang Shixiang is investing in mechanized production of proprietary Chinese medicines, and most of his products are sold relying on the mainland. Expanding investment on the mainland is his original intention; we only utilize this intention..."

"Cough," Ma Qianzhu coughed: "Yang Shixiang originally had his own commercial network on the mainland. His dependence on us isn't as great as Lin Quan'an. Is there possibility for you to ask him to risk participating in the Black Dragon Society to conduct intelligence work against Great Ming?"

"Possibility fifty-fifty." Jiang Shan said frankly, "At the start, no need to let him know. We only use his branch institutions as cover—directly planting intelligence personnel into his institutions. Tell him after he witnesses our intelligence agency's capability."

This was of course possible. But Runshitang was different from Lin Quan'an's Quanfu Firm. Quanfu Firm only remained as a model for the Transmigration Group; Runshitang was equivalent to a subsidiary of the Transmigration Group. Moreover, Yang Shixiang and Liu San prepared to follow the chain pharmacy route in Great Ming. If one failed, the whole army would be wiped out. Not to mention what Yang Shixiang's attitude would be, just Liu San and the Ministry of Health investing in Runshitang would jump in thunderous rage.

"This matter, you must communicate well with Liu San, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Commerce." Ma Qianzhu reminded him.

"Yes, if they don't agree, we will suspend the Runshitang plan." Jiang Shan said, "Using the Black Dragon Society system we can reduce investment greatly. A part can be borne by these capitalists..."

The other part naturally is borne by us. Ma Qianzhu thought, talking for half a day still returned to the key issue.

He said: "Alright, write a plan, estimate the budget and send it up."

Ma Qianzhu instructed Hou Wenyong: All documents regarding the Foreign Intelligence Bureau received these few days should be delivered to his desk with priority. Hou Wenyong had been promoted to Secretary of the State Secretary. He was happy to hold a "Private Advisor" level position at a young age, but also awkward because he quickly discovered secretaries of various departments were almost all young females. Every time a secretary meeting convened, he became the "one spot of green among ten thousand reds."

"Then go to the Colonial and Trade Ministry compound, invite their Vice Minister to come over." Ma Qianzhu instructed, "Mm, don't come to the State Council compound, go to the General Office lounge."

He thought: Although the other party is a Vice Minister, he is after all a Vice Minister of a department equal to his own. The two sides have no subordination relationship. Calling him directly here appears too domineering. Reputation would be bad.

The Colony and Trade Minister hadn't been elected yet. According to the *Common Program*, the nine Executives were all political officials requiring election by the Senate. But several of them hadn't been produced yet. These positions were either unattended or coveted by too many people. The Senate held several plenaries and still hadn't solved it.

So personnel aspiring to these businesses took the administrative official route. Positions below Executive were appointed. Si Kaide took this route, smoothly becoming the Office Director of the Colony and Trade Ministry—currently equivalent to the Vice Minister of this ministry, and actually exercising most administrative powers of this ministry.

Si Kaide studied Radar—there were a few radars here, but building radars was very difficult. He immediately understood what "Dragon Slaying Skill" (useless high skill) meant. Until now his entire professional experience was maintaining the few radars of the Transmigration Group.

Ma Qianzhu knew this person. This person was politically an oligarchist, opposing parliamentary democracy, irreconcilable with the Qian family brothers who were head figures of the North American Branch, and called Shan Liang "ambitious man on a soapbox." Ma Qianzhu felt this person was suitable to be an official in the Colony and Trade Ministry: people too universal-value and democratic couldn't do this ministry's work. But characters nakedly promoting genocide and the like weren't suitable either—they were too extreme, always wanting to express loyalty to ideals, not knowing many things had to be done in stages.

He put a "Away" sign on his desk—this sign had two colors. One green, meaning short absence within fifteen minutes; one yellow, indicating absence might be as long as an hour. To avoid people waiting in vain.

Ma Qianzhu went downstairs, opening the door from the back courtyard of the office building—there was an indigenous guard here. He showed his pass. The guard carefully verified the photo and his face, then wrote down the time of his departure and pass number in the register.

He looked at this guard's dark face, meticulously copying Arabic numerals clumsily according to guard regulations, thinking: our system is really being implemented. Since people can be reformed, society can also be reformed.

"Your pass, Chief." The guard stood at attention, opening the back courtyard door.

"Thank you." Ma Qianzhu put away the pass and walked out slowly.

Opening the back door was a long open-air alleyway, leading directly to the courtyard where the Executive Committee General Office was located. The alleyway between various agency compounds allowed personnel of various departments to move directly between each other's buildings without exiting the main gate, facilitating security and access control.

There was no one in the alleyway, very quiet. Ma Qianzhu could even hear birds singing. Such bird songs were heard less and less near Bairen City. The roar of machines and thick smoke from the neighboring industrial zone drove away birds and animals here.

Yet the bird song was so cheerful. Right, spring had arrived in Lingao. This place was subtropical after all; winter was short and inconspicuous. Leaves didn't wither, flowers bloomed in four seasons. At noon, you could always run around in shirts or even undershirts. Ma Qianzhu liked places with distinct four seasons, able to feel plant glory and withering, the passage of years in seasonal replacement...

He put his hands in his pockets. Recalling the documents regarding system construction of fiscal system, tax system, and accounting system sent by the General Fiscal Directorate recently. And the conversation content of Yi Fan, Chen Ce and others at the Wudaokou Financial Meeting. He felt an unprecedented pressure surging toward him.

This pressure was hard for others to understand, or they wouldn't understand—fiscal and economic systems, isn't this dignified system construction? Just as someone said: without accounting and fiscal systems, repress to a barter system?

No, not like this. Ma Qianzhu thought, this is a line struggle.

Simply put, it is the conflict between engineers and accountants, a line struggle of two different development thoughts.

Accountants are anxious to engage in finance, using economic indicators to control society, managing enterprises in the way of managing enterprises. Engineers intend to use a complex set of technical indicators to expand industry as soon as possible.

Ma Qianzhu believed accountants' thinking only suited individual enterprises, and specifically those able to switch among multiple suppliers, multiple logistics providers, and multiple sales methods at any time. Only such enterprises could be managed centering on capital.

He wrote in his secret memo:

...Under the current economic state of Lingao, Yi Fan and others' thinking is meaningless. Capital cannot be used equally among different suppliers—ie other factories' production processes. Cannot linearly exchange one indicator for another. Current circulation coupons are not real currency. Industrialized products have no mature market in this world to apply microeconomics casually. So marketization holds no water. Must use complex indicators, i.e., technical core control. Only common technologies, mature technologies, i.e., technologies openable to indigenous operation, can follow the pure capital control route.

...

High technology never follows the market. Because value itself cannot be measured by the market. At this time it is only reasonable to follow the Engineer Core Route. Planned economy must be maintained in core industries, using monopoly profits to cover development costs, using technical superiority to deal with micro-efficiency losses.

...

However, from the perspective of a government, it is hard to deny the roles of currency, accounting, auditing, and calculation. It can even be said that without this system, modern government cannot operate, including the minimum fiscal budget and final accounts of modern government operation. So, how to achieve balance therein is a key matter.

He thought he should talk to Cheng Dong. He should be able to understand his theory. Of course, Cheng Dong now also supported the plan of Yi Fan's gang—this was natural. Once this plan was passed, the power of fiscal and economic departments would rise geometrically. People couldn't resist this temptation.

He suddenly remembered, among documents sent by the General Fiscal Directorate to the Executive Committee Secretariat recently, one was a request report regarding adding "Full-time Bank Security Personnel." This report was inconspicuous, placed among a pile of routine reports. According to procedure, as long as passed in the Executive Committee, then passed three readings in the Senate Standing Committee, this matter was done.

Ha! Ma Qianzhu thought, you want to create a Ministry of Finance Secret Service. Can this matter be a bargaining chip? He immediately vetoed his own thought—the chip was too small. Can such an agency like Ministry of Finance Secret Service be mentioned in the same breath as power affecting the overall situation?
