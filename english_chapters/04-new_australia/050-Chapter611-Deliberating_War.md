# Chapter 611 - Deliberating War

He slowly folded the letter, creasing it neatly, and reinserted it into its envelope. With his veteran savvy in official matters, he had a set of methods for deflecting and delaying any troublesome government business. After all, no matter how great or important the matter, nothing could withstand the word "delay." A few months later, who knew what new winds might be blowing at court?

This time, he probably couldn't avoid producing some achievement in pacifying the seas. The Emperor had ascended the throne not long ago and still harbored an enthusiasm for diligent governance—and from the mouths of eunuchs close to the Emperor, he'd learned that His Majesty was an extremely industrious person. If he kept deflecting and delaying, he probably wouldn't be able to muddle through. When the time came, if that hothead Gao Shunqing submitted an impeachment memorial, things would become very troublesome.

Back when he'd been rectifying the governance of the two Guangs, he'd offended quite a few people. These people all had old friends and fellow examination graduates in the capital. If he made one misstep and lost imperial favor, impeachment memorials would pile up, and his fate would be clear—loss of office would be the lightest punishment.

And Gao Shunqing's attitude was truly hard to predict. This man was young and held a position on the remonstrance circuit, inevitably making him arrogant—he himself had been a remonstrance official and well understood their temperament.

The Inspector Gao despised maritime merchants, sea pirates, and Westerners alike. He'd approached Wang Zunde several times, hoping to prohibit trade with the Portuguese. Wang Zunde had always been vague and noncommittal. According to rumor, Gao Shunqing was already quite dissatisfied with him.

Gao Shunqing's hatred of the Portuguese was mainly because they had "towering ships and giant cannons," and "no one dared approach them." They also traded in various contraband goods. Wang Zunde felt that much of it was because this Guangdong territory actually had a place that "did not submit to imperial civilization."

For Wang Zunde, although the Portuguese occasionally caused some local trouble, they were generally tactful. Being tactful didn't mean paying their annual rent of five hundred taels to Xiangshan County on time—that was merely a drop in the bucket for all of Guangdong Province.

Recently, the Portuguese had repeatedly sent merchants to Guangzhou, presenting generous gifts to various parties—presumably they'd heard about Gao Shunqing's recent moves and were intensifying their lobbying.

Then there was the matter of the Portuguese wanting to jointly suppress Liu Xiang with the Ming—they'd said Liu Xiang was colluding with the "Hollanders" who had raided the coast during the Tianqi reign and occupied the Pescadores to build fortresses, plotting against the Great Ming. Whether this was true or false, only Heaven knew. Wang Zunde couldn't help but sigh: maritime affairs were truly intricate and complex, yet the government knew nothing about this mysterious sea world.

He paced in his study, admiring the shadows cast on the bamboo curtains, then suddenly called out in a booming voice: "Someone!"

A personal attendant appeared at the door.

"Go now and invite Advisors Lü and Li."

He'd invited these two advisors because he wanted to hear their views on pacifying Guangdong's coastal waters. He wasn't in any hurry to see Li Fengjie—if he went to see him now, that man would just say "I follow the master's lead." Of course, since the Governor-General handled military affairs while he as Governor focused on civil administration, such a statement wasn't unreasonable.

As for the other provincial officials, large and small, they were all slippery as eels that left no trace. Each was more skilled than the last at passing the buck and avoiding responsibility. Having served as an official for many years, Wang Zunde knew it wasn't just the two Guangs that were like this—it was the same everywhere.

If he wanted to hear some practical advice, he could only rely on his staff.

These two men were his most trusted advisors. Lü Yizhong had served several terms as a prefect, while Li Xijue was a *jinshi* from the Tianqi reign who had never received an appointment and had been living at home in idle retirement. Both were in their early to late forties—the prime of life when energy was abundant. Both were well-read and also deeply familiar with practical government affairs.

But for the moment, these two advisors couldn't come up with any brilliant ideas either—strategy was built on the foundation of intelligence, and without intelligence, when you couldn't even tell who the enemy was, where could strategy come from?

Since the late Wanli reign, various maritime heroes had risen and fallen, their names numerous. Government documents recorded dozens of major gangs. But the government knew very little about their actual situations—most was hearsay.

As for this Liu Xiang, he was merely a force that had risen at the beginning of the Chongzhen reign. Only recently had his expansion become the fastest, having already become a scourge at the Pearl River estuary, which was why people had begun to pay attention.

Though Advisors Lü and Li were eager to share their master's burdens, they themselves didn't understand these sea pirates any better than Wang Zunde. How could they offer counsel? Advisor Li, after racking his brains, could only come up with the stale tricks that Hu Zongxian and others had used against the wokou decades ago. Nothing new to speak of.

But Lü Yizhong remained silent throughout. In his view, Advisor Li's strategies were all feasible but couldn't solve the fundamental problem. Their master had no intention of launching a large-scale campaign against sea pirates—even if he wanted to, he lacked the capability. There was no money.

Whether it was coastal evacuation, tightening inspections on shore-based goods exports, or training coastal and riverine militias—all these measures required time and money. The government's current situation was simply lacking money. Without money, nothing could be done.

The government lacked both money and time. And Governor-General Wang felt he lacked time. Lü Yizhong was more astute than others at reading his master's intentions. Combining recent court politics with the situation in the two Guangs and Fujian, he quickly understood his master's true thoughts.

The glory of suppressing southeastern sea pirates couldn't all go to Xiong Wenhan. Since Zheng Zhilong had accepted pacification, various major pirate forces along the southeastern coast—Yang Liu, Yang Qi, Zhu Cailao's gang—had been destroyed one after another within two years. Xiong Wenhan's reputation as a "capable official at pacifying the seas" was now recognized by both court and public.

Given this situation, Liu Xiang, who continued to entrench himself in Guangdong waters and was even expanding, became an embarrassing contrast. The Governor-General of the two Guangs had to demonstrate some accomplishment.

Though he understood his master's thinking, offering ideas was another matter entirely. He pondered the situation before them: this wasn't the Jiajing reign, when the court still had ample funds to build ships and train soldiers. Now Wang Zunde only had limited resources available. He couldn't attack on multiple fronts; he could only identify one gang and crush them decisively, achieving a great victory and capturing the bandit chief.

Moreover, the court's navy had always been ineffective at sea battles. Success must come from land combat.

"If only there were a place like Shuangyu or Tunmen," Lü Yizhong said.

Li Xijue was a quick-witted man and immediately understood, nodding along: "Exactly."

Wang Zunde naturally grasped their meaning, but where Liu Xiang's lair was, they had no idea. As for other pirate gangs, that went without saying.

Just as they were at a loss, Lü Yizhong quietly said: "What about Lingao?"

All three nodded together. This place would indeed be excellent!

The fact that the Australians had built a fortified camp at Lingao was no longer a secret in Guangzhou. Just as the three Purple-Character establishments being backed by Australians was also no secret.

"It should be Bopu—what the pirates have seized is precisely Bopu. Lingao County itself hasn't fallen," Li Xijue reminded them. "All taxes and grain levies have been paid in full."

"Precisely," Lü Yizhong nodded. "The imperial army attacking Bopu would remove a scourge from Lingao. It would benefit both the state and the people."

This wasn't just a detail—it was a crucial point.

If they "suppressed the sea pirates entrenched at Lingao," someone at court would inevitably raise questions about why Guangdong had never reported the county's fall. But by mentioning only Bopu, the story was watertight. Besides, Lingao truly hadn't fallen—this wasn't deceiving the throne.

Thinking of this, Wang Zunde felt as if clouds had parted to reveal the sun. He nodded repeatedly but said nothing more.

Lü Yizhong and Li Xijue knew he'd already approved this idea in principle, but still needed to weigh the pros and cons. What they needed to do now was to work out the details. Where would the soldiers, ships, and provisions come from? How much would be needed? How would military pay and miscellaneous expenses be arranged? All these details had to be thoroughly considered, with multiple contingency plans prepared. When it came time for actual execution, the Governor-General could choose.

These matters couldn't be handled by themselves alone. Fortunately, the Governor-General's office had a large staff of advisors, ranging from retired officials who'd served as prefects to frivolous literati who only knew how to compose poetry and songs. Though a mixed bag, there were quite a few capable and talented men among them.

Lü Yizhong quickly gathered a dozen or so of Wang Zunde's most trusted advisors to discuss the matter.

But his "brilliant plan" soon met with objections.

"The Governor-General wanting to destroy the hair-shorn pirates at Lingao is certainly gratifying," one person said. "But I've heard they have connections in the Imperial Palace. I'm afraid they can't be touched easily."

Another advisor said: "The Australians have deep ties with Gao Ju, and I hear Gao Ju is connected to Eunuch Yang in the palace. These internal connections may be beyond our ability to untangle."

At the mention of eunuch involvement, everyone fell silent. The days when eunuchs wielded overwhelming power weren't long past. The Emperor had removed the Nine Thousand Years upon ascending the throne, but the Prince's household eunuchs were equally in positions of power. If they offended some mysterious "inner chancellor," when the time came for retaliation with some malicious words, everyone would be in deep trouble.

"No matter," Lü Yizhong said. "Gao Ju's backer, Eunuch Yang, isn't one of the eunuchs who followed the late Prince. During the days when Wei the Traitor held power, he requested an idle posting to avoid trouble. After the Emperor ascended the throne, he has little influence in the palace."

"Though he's a eunuch, he still has a voice from inside the palace. We shouldn't offend him lightly," someone still urged caution.

"No problem," Lü Yizhong said. "The hair-shorn pirates have no connection with Eunuch Yang—Gao Ju is Eunuch Yang's man. The Australians merely do business with Gao Ju. Eunuch Yang has always been wise and principled. How could he make trouble for a court official on behalf of a band of sea pirates?"

Gao Ju had extensive dealings with the Australians. Even without the Australians, the Gao family was famously "colluding with foreigners." Finding evidence of their "consorting with sea pirates" would be easy. Would Eunuch Yang really walk into such a trap and get things backward?

Eunuch Yang had little influence left in the palace. The Australians' destruction wasn't the same as Gao Ju's destruction. As long as Gao Ju remained unharmed, the benefits owed to Eunuch Yang would continue flowing, not one wen less, and no one would dare shortchange him. With the Australians—these sea pirates—destroyed, would Eunuch Yang personally confront Wang Zunde? Wang Zunde was a top-ranking court official with a reputation for integrity and uprightness. Eunuch Yang wasn't a powerful grand eunuch; why would he wade into these muddy waters?

As long as Gao Ju wasn't harmed, letting the Gao family pass through peacefully, Eunuch Yang naturally wouldn't interfere. Lü Yizhong's calculation lay precisely here. When the time came, they could compensate part of the Australians' properties in Guangzhou to the Gao family. Even if they had some grievances, they'd have nothing to say—Gao Ju wouldn't be so lacking in tact as to oppose Guangdong's officialdom.

"Furthermore, the Australians building a walled camp at Lingao is exactly the old trick the Portuguese used to occupy Macau. Back then, the court permitted the Portuguese. Would they now permit the Australians as well?" Lü Yizhong reminded them. "This matter must be resolved sooner or later. Better sooner than later."

After his analysis, everyone found it quite reasonable. No one objected to attacking the hair-shorn pirates anymore.

"But how do we deal with the Australians' iron ships?" someone asked. "I've heard they're as tall as city walls, even taller than the great carracks of the Red-Hairs and the Portuguese. Our navy has no ships to fight them!"

"The so-called giant iron ships are merely street gossip. Not to be taken seriously," Lü Yizhong said. "Even if such massive vessels truly exist, the imperial forces can use fireships to drive them off. Moreover, the imperial campaign should advance by both land and sea. The naval force would merely be a diversion; the land force would be the main effort. Once their Hundred Fathom Camp is broken on land, with nothing to rely on ashore, they'll have no choice but to weigh anchor and leave. The imperial forces can then claim victory."

This idea was still based on the "drive them away" approach: this wasn't showing mercy or friendship, but the local officials' accurate assessment of their own military strength. During the Tianqi reign, mobilizing seventy or eighty thousand troops and several hundred warships had only managed to "persuade the withdrawal" of a dozen Dutch ships. Obviously, completely destroying the Australians was even more impossible now. Of course, expelling the Australians who'd entrenched themselves at Lingao for years could still be counted as a significant achievement.

Lü Yizhong's calculation was to find a way to "force the Australians to retreat," achieving victory with minimal losses. The strength of the Australians at Lingao was somewhat known in Guangzhou.

"The true hair-shorn ones in Lingao number only about a thousand," Lü Yizhong said. "The rest are local traitors who've shaved their heads and attached themselves—fake hair-shorn ones. Their total doesn't exceed several tens of thousands. But they're a mix of men and women, old and young, only drawn to Lingao by the pirates' petty favors. They absolutely won't fight to the death for the pirates. When the imperial heavenly troops arrive, they'll melt away like ice in the sun."

"Even with only a thousand, relying on their ships and fierce artillery, they won't be easy to deal with," one advisor said. "I've heard that besides the great iron ship, they have fast iron boats and repeating firearms. Whoever faces them is swept away. They shouldn't be underestimated."

"I suggest we could also borrow troops. After all, the Australians have formidable ships and guns. They also have fast iron boats and repeating cannons to assist in battle," this person continued to propose. "The Portuguese have always sought our favor and have been quite obedient to the court. They recently presented cannons. If we borrow their aid in suppression, our forces could achieve twice the result with half the effort."

"The Portuguese have red barbarian cannons and great carrack ships. Our weakness in ships and guns could be somewhat compensated." Many agreed with this proposal.

"Why not have the Governor-General order Zheng Zhilong to dispatch a detachment to assist? Zheng Zhilong's forces are experienced at sea and could serve as the vanguard."

"I'm afraid Governor Xiong wouldn't agree. He relies on Zheng Zhilong as the Great Wall of Fujian's seas. With Li Kuiqi and others not yet captured, how would he be willing? Inadvisable, inadvisable."

Some proposed reviving the old tricks of Yu Dayou and Dong Long from the Jiajing era, when they'd eliminated pirates at Humen—enticing foreign pirates with promises of ships and goods and heavy rewards to join the attack.

"That's inadvisable," Li Xijue shook his head vigorously. "Foreign pirates cannot be enticed. Otherwise, we'd be repelling the tiger at the front gate only to let the wolf in the back. These aren't the old days anymore. If we must borrow troops, we can only use the Portuguese."

"What about borrowing troops from the Hollanders?"

"Back then, they tried to occupy the Pescadores. If we borrow their troops, would we have to let them return to the Pescadores?"

"That's a mistake," the advisor who'd made this suggestion thought himself clever. "Back when the Hollanders agreed to withdraw to Tayouan, our dynasty promised that merchants could go trade there. We could use this as leverage: if the Hollanders don't lend troops for suppression, we'll prohibit merchants from going to Tayouan..."

"Utterly wrong!" Li Xijue had to step in to refute such absurd reasoning. "Prohibit merchants from trading? Since the Jiajing reign, the maritime ban has been lifted and reimposed, reimposed and lifted. It has never truly been enforced."

This method might have some use against the Portuguese. But Tayouan wasn't Macau—right at Guangzhou's doorstep. The thousands of miles of Fujian and Guangdong coastline simply couldn't be sealed off. Besides, those trading at Tayouan were mostly Fujian merchants, with Zheng Zhilong being the biggest of them all.

Zheng Zhilong wouldn't heed orders from the Governor-General of the two Guangs, and Fujian's coastal merchants wouldn't buy it either. Xiong Wenhan wouldn't necessarily be willing to issue such an order for Guangdong's sake. So this idea was completely impractical.

"Setting aside borrowing troops—once we mobilize, where will the provisions and military pay come from?"

This was the key to warfare. It wasn't that the court lacked troops, but the troops could only be said to be alive. To get this mob of armed beggars to march to battle, first they had to be paid—all back pay couldn't be issued, but at least a portion had to be, otherwise the soldier-lords wouldn't budge. Second, by custom, departure required settling-in allowances and rewards. After the battle, win or lose, casualties had to be compensated. If victorious, there'd need to be additional funds for celebrations.

As for the provisions needed for the march and campaign, those also had to be prepared in advance. Soldiers could go half-hungry on ordinary days, but couldn't be expected to serve the state on empty stomachs when fighting. The provisions issue was relatively easier to solve in Guangdong. The region generally had two harvests a year, and government granaries were still well-stocked. Qiongzhou Prefecture also had several granaries specifically for military provisions against the Li people, with tens of thousands of *shi* of grain stockpiled year-round that could be requisitioned nearby.

"As for compensation and celebrations, those are matters for later. We don't need to discuss them now. First, let's raise the funds for departure," Lü Yizhong said.

"Currently, all armies are nearly half a year behind on pay. Each soldier's pay is the equivalent of two taels per month. We'd need to back-pay two or three months. As for settling-in allowances, each man needs another three taels. Before the army even moves, each soldier already costs at least seven taels. If we mobilize ten thousand men, seventy thousand would be spent before they even left camp!" Someone's tongue clicked at the calculation.

"You've calculated too low. Marching also requires public-use and miscellaneous expenses, plus various other costs. Without ten to twenty thousand more, they can't even depart," an advisor with military experience said. "And what about repairs to artillery and ships? Don't those cost money?"

"You don't need to calculate," Li Xijue said. "When Commander Yu drove out the Red-Hairs from the Pescadores during the Tianqi reign, it cost the provincial treasury nearly four hundred thousand taels. This mobilization will cost no less than that. Military expenses will be at least three hundred thousand taels. That's being frugal. If we're generous, we'd need to double it."
