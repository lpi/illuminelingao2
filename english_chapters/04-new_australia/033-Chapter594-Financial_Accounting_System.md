# Chapter 594 - Financial Accounting System

"I know, his theory differs from mine." Yi Fan said, "His argument is: before industry is fully expanded and resources can be allocated at will to control the capacity of various departments, finance and accounting are just bookkeeping. However, even current capacity is estimated based on project needs; accurate and timely budget accounting cannot be separated from production. Finance is not just government expense investment, but also a party regulating currency. Currency issuance and withdrawal cannot be separated from finance."

Yi Fan spoke with enthusiasm. His concern for monetary policy was far less than his enthusiasm for the fiscal and tax system. He had always prided himself as the "Chief Accountant," and secretly calculated that Cheng Dong's position as Fiscal Comptroller was a political appointment; he would step down after at most two terms, and by then Yi Fan would be a very competitive candidate for this position.

From a nameless middle manager to suddenly entering the position of the Nine Elders—this hope made Yi Fan always spare no effort in things where he could perform. Although the Wudaokou group hadn't formed a very strong organization, at least now it could make a loud enough voice.

He talked excitedly about his package of fiscal and tax plans. Some things were actually already implemented, while others only existed in his notebooks and countless memos—writing memos and formulating policies were basically Yi Fan's main recreational activities usually.

"What is the most basic and urgent problem in Lingao's economy currently? Fiscal tax, accounting, and market!" He slapped the table fiercely. "Without this modern system, we might as well cancel all currency and regress to an economic structure of physical rationing and barter."

"If you put it that way, the Director will definitely approve," Chen Ce said. "Talk about your plan; less commentary."

Wu Di also said: "Don't mention names; let's discuss the matter itself." Saying so, he glanced around uneasily.

"Fine," Yi Fan said. "Many people just treat taxation as a means of accumulation. Actually, fiscal tax issues are very complex. Fiscal tax determines investment and consumption of public goods, determines the scale of public debt, determines control over financial markets; as for accounting, I believe everyone understands: a fiscal system cannot be built without economic data. Accounting determines the grasp of economic data, determines investment direction, determines the scale and details of imports and exports; the market determines whether there are locations and institutions to execute currency issuance and withdrawal, determines the government's control over currency..."

His speech was trivial to those present. This was common sense. Yi Fan spoke like this mainly to practice his speech for the formal Senate Fiscal and Financial Hearing—he intended to leave a full and profound impression on the Elders with this. For this purpose, he had practiced many times alone by the Wenlan River.

"The root of fiscal tax is tax. In adopting a tax system, besides the direct tax like agricultural tax we must inherit, new tax types should try to follow the turnover tax system of the old spacetime. As for a two-level tax system, there is no need to inherit it—our territory is still very small; under the condition of few indigenous tax personnel with low quality, having two sets of institutions is inappropriate. So temporarily only the National Tax Bureau holds control. Local government finance relies on full appropriation from superiors; as for public debt, it is issued to all Lingao residents, underwritten by Delung, and repurchased by Delung when necessary. At the current scale, it is not necessary to immediately establish corresponding market institutions, but Delung internal divisions must be clear. Audit must be stationed in Delung to prevent indiscriminate issuance and excessive repurchase. It is necessary to establish a Financial Committee combined of the Ministry of Finance and Audit to make quarterly plans for Delung's regular and irregular businesses."

"Public debt can wait, especially when our jurisdiction is just Lingao," Wu Di said. "At this stage, the simpler this stuff is, the better; otherwise it distracts too much energy."

"Without public debt, what currency can you issue? How did you learn finance?" Yi Fan already found Wu Di disagreeable; now he just sprayed him directly.

"I didn't say we can't issue it, but just swapping hands between the Ministry of Finance and Delung is enough; don't sell publicly." Wu Di said. "In such a small place like Lingao, is there any meaning in playing too many tricks? Not to mention free purchase, even if you allocate sales, who can you sell to?"

"Many people in Lingao got rich relying on us; shouldn't they contribute a bit? Anyway, they are secretly transferring assets outside."

"How much can that be? Besides, people transferring assets is because we haven't exuded 'Tyrant's Qi'," Wu Di said. "They still lack sufficient confidence in our prospects."

"Alright, you continue." Chen Ce said.

"Then comes accounting, which is the foundation of the entire economy and finance. Currently, although Lingao has over a hundred product lines, they mainly boil down to heavy industry using coal, iron, and non-ferrous metals as raw materials with internal infrastructure as consumers; light industry mainly processing food, cotton cloth garments, matches, etc., with Lingao residents as the main body gradually increasing foreign exports; and luxury industry mainly consisting of sanitary ceramics, clocks, cosmetics, mainly for export and gradually promoting internally.

"In these three product lines, the first type is the main item Lingao needs to pay externally for, and priced in silver it doesn't directly generate profit. The second type's raw materials are mostly imported too, but the profit from the export portion can support the continued development of the entire industry, while domestic sales priced in grain coupons actually convert to silver pricing ultimately. The third type is supported by the first type of industry and is one of the main sources of profit. Simultaneously, Lingao also has imports in the pure consumption field: grain, population. Grain supports population import, and population costs must add inspection, quarantine, physical recovery, etc. So this block needs human resource cost accounting to determine the direction and method of population import through detailed accounting.

"The above accounting is just a general discussion on costs. Expense accounting requires a large number of basic accounting personnel. Given the relatively simple production situation currently, a centralized accounting department can be set up under the Ministry of Finance to uniformly account for all units, but prepare reports separately, gradually expanding the scale of the general ledger and accelerating the preparation of monthly consolidated reports. Simultaneously, accounting and taxation are inseparable; not only central SOEs need accounting, Fiscal Tax and Delung need it more."

"The stuff you're talking about, I bet most of the Senate don't understand." Chen Ce said.

"Isn't that nonsense? People who understand this stuff are all in the fiscal and financial department. Doesn't Director Ma advocate 'Engineers Running the Country' all day long? We also count as a type of engineer."

Chen Ce suddenly realized this guy was ambitious; his ambition should have been seen from his creating that whatever Cheka. He couldn't help but feel vigilant.

"So I see you better not do unified accounting. This touches the material planned allocation system Director Ma always insists on." Wu Di reminded him again, "He won't give up this concept easily."

"I know this." Yi Fan recently nodded. "This is a proposal, not a final draft. Even if my plan is fully approved, there will be various problems in implementation; we'll adjust then."

"Finally is the market. Mainly referring to financial markets," Yi Fan continued. "Currently, joint-stock operations already exist among Lingao civilians and between civilians and the Transmigration Government. Then first establishing an over-the-counter market to carry out government-guided stock trading is a problem that must be solved as soon as possible. Similarly, Zichengji, Delung, and Leitang's external joint ventures can also be included in this market. Zichengji's point in Guangzhou can be seen as the prototype of a Guangzhou Stock Exchange. However, the stock market is currently only a very small pilot in the financial market. For Lingao's fiscal and monetary system, the most important thing is to establish a bond market as soon as possible, starting with public debt issuance. Public debt can play a role in regulating currency scale through the fiscal side, while Delung regulates currency on the bank side through credit scale. At the same time, the financial market must also include maritime and fire insurance institutions. Grand maritime trade is based on two points: one is shareholding system, two is insurance system. regarding commodity trading, the Cooperative is now a prototype of a commodity exchange..."

"Securities, commodity exchanges, and your insurance companies—don't bullshit about them for now; same as the bond market. Economic scale is too small; it's meaningless to engage in this. And there aren't enough clients now." Chen Ce interrupted his further high discourse. "At least wait until unifying Hainan and occupying Guangdong. The grander you make it now, the greater the possibility of getting shot down. The Executive Committee bunch may not like Director Ma's theory, but they all believe in the 'Simple is Good' theory."

"Fine, fine, I'll simplify it and be done."

"Director Yi, you talked for half a day all on theory. How exactly to organize this accounting and audit system?" Jin Zhijiao had been silent in the meeting, but spoke up now. "According to your statement, our 'Cheka' equals shouldering audit, accounting, and statistics all in one. How to coordinate relations with corporate accounting departments becomes a problem."

"I have an idea for this," Yi Fan said. "The accounting system actually focuses on central SOEs and shareholding enterprises. Due to shortage of qualified accounting personnel and small scale of individual enterprises, we can adopt a setup where a centralized accounting center handles all Lingao enterprise account data. Internal transactions among central SOEs can be treated as related-party transactions currently; only imports and exports generate cash flow. Separate the expense accounting department to handle all enterprise expense expenditures. Additionally, set up a Planning and Budget Department to coordinate budgets of all enterprises in Lingao, Guangzhou, Lei, and Sanya."

"Discussion on this is premature." Chen Ce said, "I think you just need to improve the financial systems of each enterprise. Once data collection is complete, anything can be done later."

"Fine, fine. By the way, regarding adding bank security personnel for Delung Bank, Cheng Dong has no objections, right?" Chen Ce asked.

He was asking Du Mo, the Office Director of Delung Bank—this person was one of the very few who hadn't lost a pound since D-Day. He had done finance work, so became a member of the fiscal-financial staff. He worked in Cheka for a time, then after Delung's separation, he changed to become Delung Bank Office Director because he had handled office reception before.

Du Mo and Yi Fan were completely consistent on many concepts, so he was Yi Fan's diehard fan and Yi Fan's basic personnel in Cheka. This transfer came suddenly and he couldn't refuse. regarding Yi Fan stuffing Jin Zhijiao to him from the Organization Department suddenly, he had considerable complaints—the Cheka in his imagination was a place like the Independent Commission Against Corruption, not an accounting firm.

"Committee Member Cheng signed after seeing it. I estimate next time the Executive Committee holds a standing meeting, it will be a process passed in one stroke." Du Mo said it was wrapped in a large pile of signed reports, a tiny bank business request.

Subsequently, everyone continued to chat about heaven and earth, discussing only romance (idle talk). Yi Fan felt he drank too much water and needed to go to the toilet.

"I need to go too. Let's go together." Chen Ce said.

In a modern small toilet on the third floor, two men urinated side by side. Just as Yi Fan let out a groan of relief, Chen Ce whispered:

"Your plan actually has the meaning of creating a SASAC (State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission). This will probably face sniping from the Director, and Wu De will definitely ally with him—with a SASAC, the Planning Agency's status drops greatly. Once these two get together, your plan will be hard to pass."

"I am aware of this point." Yi Fan maintained his urinating posture, whispering, "There are nine Executives after all, aren't there."

"Very risky." Chen Ce expressed worry. "Don't forget, President Wen—don't look at him being a liberal in the past, a small capitalist, he is essentially also a planned economy element. He is a standardization fanatic—from this angle, his desire for control is stronger than the Director. As for Zhan Wuya, a thorough engineer, he will definitely stand on President Wen's side. Ma Jia is slippery, and since this matter doesn't concern him, no need for him to jump out. Others have similar attitudes, mainly 'buying soy sauce' (bystanders)."

"What about the Senate Standing Committee? The Executive Committee doesn't cover the sky with one hand."

"Your plan is so complex and professional; do you expect Standing Committee people to understand? They can only decide direction—you want them to decide appropriation amounts and allocation, no problem. You want them to decide how much currency to issue, how accounting entries go, these are professional issues; they shouldn't manage them originally."

Yi Fan was silent for a moment: "I still want to try."

"I think you better stay calm and prepare a simple one for submission."

"I have a simple one too," Yi Fan said. "Submit the complex one first, make a fuss, then bring the simple one; it'll be easier to pass." He buttoned his trousers. "Overly simple things won't have problems for a moment, but will definitely have downsides over time. Anyway, I've said it beforehand; the decision power is above."

"What do you plan to do about the redemption of precious metals and copper cash?" Cheng Dong received the three main generals submitting the plan in his office. "This matter involves people's livelihood and hearts; we cannot be incautious."

His office was a bit crowded. Most numerous were filing cabinets, stuffed with various financial documents and dossiers. In the past, this was the aggregation point for all financial data of the Transmigration Group. As departments became more numerous, quite a few dossiers transferred to where they should go. The originally crowded and messy office finally looked somewhat decent.

Standard furniture was still the earliest manufactured plain wood tables and chairs; decorations were only a few potted green plants. Many people hung Ming calligraphy and paintings looted in their offices, or at least hung a few Fujian-produced Kraak porcelain plates as decoration. But here there were none at all. The walls were dazzlingly white.

Yi Fan sometimes felt this person's plain living in this regard reached the point of pretentiousness.

"Someone come." He shouted. A young woman wearing a female clerk dress uniform appeared at the office door. "Pour tea!"

"Yes." The secretary withdrew.

"You finally have a secretary too." Wu Di patted a horse's butt (flattered) calmly, "Counted as rare among Executives, right?"

"Not rare. President Wen and the Director still don't have one. Now that Elders have hope of being assigned secretaries, I dare to use one. Otherwise, I'd be a target." Cheng Dong smiled bitterly. The secretary brought three glass cups of Kombucha drink a moment later.

"Only this; make do for now."

"No problem, I love drinking this." Wu Di immediately drank half a cup in one breath.

Yi Fan didn't drink, going straight to the topic: "Simply put, issue a public notice stipulating a final deadline for circulation of silver and copper cash. After expiration, prohibit all circulation of metal coins not issued by us in Lingao."

Seeing Cheng Dong frowning straight away, he knew the other party didn't quite approve of this proposal—this was within his expectations.

"—This is an administrative measure, which must be supplemented by specific implementation methods. My idea is..."

"Before stating your idea, there is one point I must clarify with you first." Cheng Dong said, "I, and also the Executive Committee, although approving the redemption of gold, silver, and copper cash on the market, absolutely do not wish to leave commoners with an impression that we are looting wealth. Commoners won't care about your economic policy or monetary policy. They will only think you are looting this for self-enrichment, that's one; even worse, they might think we are about to run away, hence looting gold, silver, and copper cash so desperately. Public sentiment fits 'hard to raise, easy to ruin'; commoners have long been pitted by the government to be extremely suspicious. Such major economic measures must be very careful. Absolutely cannot leave a handle of competing with people for profit."

"Actually, there is indeed such an intention—"

"I know this of course; the key is 'eating conventions' (optics/manners). Eating conventions." Cheng Dong emphasized, "Cannot be too ugly, especially in our first base area."

"Yes, we understand this." Yi Fan nodded repeatedly. "So in our discussion, we try to use soft means as much as possible. Achieve the goal through commodity circulation and taxation. But this will take a longer time."

The specific measures were: all retail and wholesale channels controlled by the Transmigration Group in Lingao would switch entirely to pricing in circulation notes after a transition period, no longer accepting silver and copper cash; during the transition period, shops would set up exchange counters to accept silver and copper cash and pay out circulation notes; during the transition period, execute dual pricing, adopting devalued pricing for silver and copper cash to urge consumers to use circulation notes...
