# Chapter 675 - The Target

"To the villages." Hu Lanyan nodded. He had heard plenty about how fearsome the bald bandits' "going to the villages" was from bandits who had joined them from other gangs.

They knew the bald bandits placed great emphasis on "going to the villages." In Lingao, they had heard of "work teams"—parties of soldiers escorting small groups that penetrated deep into the wilderness and remote corners. Some went to villages to gather intelligence, set up camp, and train militia. Others climbed peaks and traversed ridges, making maps of mountains and rivers, collecting various rock and plant specimens. These unassuming small parties were like spiders spinning webs in all directions, ultimately enmeshing all of Lingao, killing all who refused to submit, forcing everyone to obey.

"The Australians are foreigners—why were they able to establish themselves in Lingao?" Gou Xunli brushed taro skin from his hands. "The most critical thing was 'going to the villages.' If you stay in the county seat, even with countless troops, you can't know what's happening in the countryside. Once they go to the villages and establish a foothold in rural areas, naturally many people feed them information."

Hu Lanyan said: "Brother speaks truly. But what should *we* do?"

"What to do?" Gou Xunli said viciously. "When a party comes, we slaughter it. Make sure their work teams go to the villages and never come back!"

"The bald bandits have powerful firearms—if our men try to kill them, we're just throwing our lives away." Hu Lanyan was greatly alarmed. He had never faced the bald bandits directly, but he had heard plenty from others. Generally speaking, rumors were more terrifying than reality.

"I'll think of a way." Gou Xunli thought for a moment. "Summon Xin Nari."

Xin Nari had barely escaped with his life from the ambush at Daolu Village. After wandering through the wilds for a long time, encountering Hu Lanyan's men had finally given him a place to belong.

The Australians had shattered his nerve. In the ranks, whenever someone mentioned Australians, he would embellish tales of their might—how they appeared and disappeared like ghosts, how terrifyingly powerful their firearms were.

When he heard Gou Xunli planned to specifically target village work teams, he was startled. This was exactly what Dang Nagi's remnants had thought. Their inside-outside coordination scheme had been well-planned, yet they had been caught in an ambush they never understood, annihilated completely. Even his sister had been captured by the bald bandits.

"Second Master!" Xin Nari said cautiously. "Work teams may have few men, but they've got thirty or forty, and every one has an Australian musket. Face to face, we're no match."

Gou Xunli said viciously: "Who said anything about face to face? We play dirty!"

Xin Nari thought that they had played plenty dirty back then, and still couldn't beat the Australians—in fact, they had lost their remaining men and even his sister.

At this moment, Xin Nari didn't dare show weakness, lest this ruthless Second Master Gou mark him down. He was a career bandit from Lingao who knew something of this Second Master Gou's infamous reputation in both underworld and mainstream circles, and was quite wary of him. Besides, Second Master Gou was now the gang's second-in-command—far above his lowly station.

"All according to Second Master's brilliant scheme..."

"Cut the empty talk," Gou Er said impatiently. "You've dealt with their work teams before. Come, tell me the details."

"We're strangers here—coming out to the countryside is rather nerve-wracking," Wang Wu said, looking out at the pitch-black night with concern. As he spoke, he unconsciously touched his pistol holster—containing the Lingao-version revolver.

Liu Dazhu was making grass sandals for himself and laughed carelessly: "Those who get a bit of money turn into cowards. We've got guns, thirty-plus people counting team members and soldiers. What clueless bandit gang would have the guts to come and die?"

Wang Wu felt a little embarrassed. "Well, that's true." He murmured. He wanted to object but felt the other had a point. They were only ten *li* from the garrison at Danzhou city, and most bandit gangs had only a few dozen men—a hundred counted as a large gang. With guns, grenades, and a sturdy building for cover, any bandit foolish enough to raid their camp would be practically suicidal.

"You're exactly what Chief Du calls a 'petty proprietor with wavering revolutionary will'!" Liu Dazhu expertly peddled the teachings he had swallowed whole from Du Wen. "Struggle against enemies involves all kinds of danger. If you're afraid of this and that, how can you possibly do the work?"

"Yes, you're right." Wang Wu couldn't talk as well as Liu Dazhu and could only awkwardly agree.

Both Wang Wu and Liu Dazhu were from Daolu Village. After the Thirteen Villages area was pacified, this region became a pilot zone for "bringing the regime to the villages." Many people were absorbed into various local pilot organizations and training courses. One was the Village Cadre Training Course, specifically training grassroots rural cadres and village work-team members.

When Du Wen selected future village cadres, she preferred poor peasants, believing them approximated the proletariat and had struggle consciousness. Liu Dazhu, the poorest peasant in Daolu Village, joined the training course. His motivation was simple: the Village Cadre Training Course provided free meals three times a day—something his family could never achieve.

Though Liu Dazhu was poor, he was clever. With no property to manage, he quickly poured tremendous enthusiasm and time into this career that let him eat his fill. He became a good student, earned a Class C diploma, and spent almost all his time at the cadre course, voraciously reading the various educational pamphlets printed by the Education Department. He quickly became a "highly conscious" trainee, greatly valued by Du Wen.

As for Wang Wu, a rich peasant who had property and business, he had no intention of becoming a "village cadre." But the transmigrators' bandit suppression had taught him the concept of "property comes from the barrel of a gun." When the Thirteen Villages Backbone Militia Company was organized, he immediately enlisted in the backbone militia. Wang Wu was very enthusiastic about defending the "new life." With plenty of family labor, he devoted much time to militia organization and training, becoming a militia squad leader.

"Summer Awakening" required large numbers of work-team cadres. Not only were all transmigrators willing to serve on work teams drafted, but many native cadres and students from Fragrant Garden and the communes were also conscripted to fill out the ranks. Wang Wu and Liu Dazhu were drafted into the Danzhou Work Team under these circumstances.

Once Liu Yixiao had established a preliminary foothold in Danzhou and built up the liaison officer system, he divided his work-team members into numerous small parties. Each work team consisted of seven or eight native cadres and students, plus an infantry platoon as a guard force. Following the principle of near-first, far-later, they would expand village by village until village-level regimes were established throughout all of Danzhou's territory.

The work team assigned to the two of them had arrived at Zhaopu Village, a settlement more than ten *li* outside Danzhou city.

It was a small village—over thirty households. Though not far from the prefectural city, the terrain was quite rugged, requiring half a day's walk on foot. The route was all wilderness; the surrounding environment was very desolate.

The villagers farmed the land at the mountain's base for a living, and had also cleared some terraced fields. Water sources were scarce; farming depended entirely on rain. The people lived in great hardship—of course, this was the norm for rural areas in this timeline, nothing unusual.

Because they were poor, there were no wealthy-peasant-level households locally. It was a desperately poor village through and through. Its selection as a first-priority target for "bringing the regime to the villages" was partly because it was nearby, but mainly because it was poor.

Poverty breeds desire for change. Such villages had no appeal for young people. Poverty meant small amounts of material incentive could satisfy people. The work team could easily cultivate the first batch of usable personnel among the local population. A portion of the large quantities of grain and cloth from Danzhou's granaries had been locally allocated to Liu Yixiao for current operational expenses.

After the Zhaopu Village work team arrived, they began work according to the procedures in the *Work Manual*. Division of labor: Liu Dazhu was responsible for "village administration"; Wang Wu for "militia." Liu Dazhu's clan niece, a women's training graduate named Liu Bing, was responsible for youth and women's work.

The work team surveyed local conditions and distributed some grain and supplies, providing relief to the poorest families. They convened a meeting of household heads. When the people discussed local conditions, the main theme was "poverty."

The village barely produced enough grain for subsistence. With poor transportation, essential consumer goods like salt, cloth, and iron tools had to be brought from outside, making them prohibitively expensive and the people even more impoverished.

Bandit problems weren't severe here—apparently the area was too poor and too remote for even bandits to bother. Wang Wu paid careful attention to whether any locals had become bandits. After checking through various channels, he found none.

Liu Dazhu took guards to tour the village and its surroundings. He was no stranger to farming, but here there was little land and much mountainside—completely different from Daolu Village.

"We need the Tiandihui to come." He murmured to himself. He decided to add this to his report.

That evening, they held a meeting and wrote reports by gas lamp light.

"There's surplus young, able-bodied labor here—they could absolutely be absorbed as the first recruits for the Danzhou Garrison Company."

"I tentatively tested their interest. Quite a few are willing. We could send at least twenty soldiers. That's practically one adult male per household."

"Then won't the local militia have no one?"

"A village this small, everyone able-bodied is naturally militia. The remaining men can still form a militia platoon."

"How's the Azure-Blue Plan going?"

The "Azure-Blue Plan" was the transmigrator regime's special program for taking in orphans from occupied territories—an important metric for work-team performance evaluation. To make his team's intake numbers look good, Liu Dazhu had been vigorously persuading particularly poor multi-child families to hand over their underage children to the work team for transport to Lingao for upbringing. This practice wasn't against regulations—in fact, it was encouraged. The Education Department welcomed more children falling into their hands, to be molded into a generation of "new people."
