# Chapter 584 - Slave Trade

"Mm." Li Luoyou thought, the Court probably lacked the ability. Leaving aside how sharp Australian firearms were, just with Australian defenses at Bopu and fast ships in the strait, unless the Court mobilized tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of warships, the Australians wouldn't even bother looking.

"No need to worry. Australians have sturdy ships and sharp cannons; moving them won't be easy." Li Luoyou deliberately didn't lower his voice, checking his nephew's expression. Seeing no fear, he felt this was feasible.

"Even if there's trouble, Baocheng, you drop the shop and leave immediately. I won't blame you. As long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of running out of firewood. It's not shameful."

"Yes, nephew will remember Master's teaching."

The three discussed who to send to assist, how to do business, what goods to prepare, how to escape if trouble arose, and how Guangdong would respond. Only after everything was settled did they rest.

While the Li family deliberated, Quark was quietly invited to Liu San's office in Runshitang.

Led by a servant with a lantern through dark passageways and unmanned alleys, dizzy from turns, he was brought to a courtyard. The courtyard was brightly lit. Liu San, who had negotiated with him earlier, waited before the room.

Quark was welcomed into a wing room and was astonished upon entering—why was the light so bright? In the courtyard Li Luoyou stayed in, the Yang family provided their best; with four candle stands in a room, yet lighting them all still left it dim. This room looked like dozens of candles were lit.

The light source came from a lamp on the table. Under a glass cover, a flame jumped, emitting light that made the whole room snow-bright.

The room was simply furnished: a Chinese desk, a few beautiful rattan chairs. Besides Liu San, there was a young man he hadn't seen—medium build, slightly chubby, ordinary looks, scholarly air, wearing a frame on his face inlaid with two pieces of glass. Quark knew these were spectacles, but seeing them perched directly on the face was a first. He couldn't help looking curiously.

The man sat in a chair, silent. Just looked him up and down.

"Mr. Quark, please sit." Liu San smiled. "We have another deal to talk about. You will definitely have great interest."

"Very good." Quark thought, a deal discussed only with him obviously wasn't something good.

Liu San rose to close the door and draw the curtains tight. Seeing such secrecy, Quark felt uneasy, wondering what they were up to.

"Mr. Quark, to talk business with peace of mind, we have to be cautious." The spectacle-wearing young man on the rattan chair suddenly spoke. And in fluent English.

Quark was startled. In this spacetime, English was neither an academic nor noble language, just one of countless European languages. Few outside Britain spoke it.

His greatest pain coming to Great Ming was the near non-existence of English speakers, forcing him to learn Chinese himself. His Chinese was passable, but expression was sometimes difficult. Hearing someone speak English now, he felt greatly relieved.

Difference existed between Old English and modern British English, but communication was unimpeded.

The speaker was Xu Tianqi, a university language student fluent in English and German. Useless after D-Day, he fell into the basic labor pool until Ma Qianzhu's mechanical card data system needed technical translation, borrowing him to the Grand Library. Afterward, he returned to labor.

After the Second Plenum, the masses of basic laborers excitedly declared "Our spring has finally come." Xu Tianqi was formally transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Actually, there wasn't much to do there; main work remained translating technical data. This time counts as formal work.

"Mr. Quark, have you traded slaves?"

Quark shook his head: "That is dangerous business!"

Slave trading was hugely profitable; even if half died en route, a ship could earn hundreds of percent profit. But risk was immense. Ships waiting at African slave stations for inland dealers often saw crews die of terrible fevers. High profits meant constant prying eyes; attacks on slave ships and stations were frequent. If caught by Spanish en route to South America, from captain to sailor might be hanged or given to the Inquisition—even converting to Catholicism meant years of slave-like hard labor before release.

Those daring this trade were the boldest, most ruthless, and unbridled men. Quark hadn't considered it even at his lowest point.

"Now there is an opportunity—" Liu San explained through Xu Tianqi the business of shipping Southeast Asian natives to Sanya. "...Natives you ship to Sanya, we pay with sugar, tea, or raw silk."

Quark hesitated: "You need slaves, I understand. But why these natives? They are small, lazy, and very ferocious. Not working material."

"Are there lazy and ferocious slaves?" Xu Tianqi said.

Quark nodded: "Fine. But capturing and shipping them is difficult."

"That counts in your cost." Liu San said. "I believe British merchants are troubled by finding no suitable trading port with China."

British merchants had no footing in Nanyang, forced to operate in Dutch territory. The Dutch wanted monopoly trade with China, causing friction in Banten, then killing eight Englishmen in Ambon. The British bore a grudge, crying "Ambon Massacre" daily as a pretext for revenge, but their East Asian strength was negligible against the Dutch. Portuguese and Spanish were deeply rooted; even the Dutch couldn't dislodge them, let alone the British.

"You mean—"

"Please look." Liu San opened a map of the South China Sea.

"You drew this?" Quark was astonished. The map was exquisite, depicting coastlines previously unmapped or guessed.

"Correct," Liu San said. Maps were Level 1 controlled items; he didn't want to dwell on it. "Here is Qiongzhou Prefecture." He pointed to Hainan Island.

"We are here." Pointing to Lingao.

"You plan to open this as a free trade port?" Quark asked.

"No, not here. Lingao has deficiencies as a trade port." Liu San said. "Specifically, here." He pointed to the southern tip of Hainan.

"There is nothing here." Quark said.

"No, we have a port here." Liu San said. "Transport slaves there, and we pay you best white sugar, crystal sugar, and raw silk."

"You have a port there?!" Quark shouted exaggeratedly. He didn't know the name, but geographically it was a choke point between China and Southeast Asia. Superior location. Closer to China than Dutch-held Formosa. Very convenient for British ships.

If he set up a warehouse there... Gold began dancing before Quark's eyes again.

"I want to see for myself. As for slaves..." Quark hesitated. Slave trading was profitable but hard to start. No existing chain like African slaves. Southeast Asia had no such industry; Quark had to build the chain.

Referencing the African model: bribe local chiefs to capture slaves, exchange goods for captives, build fortified trading stations to hoard slaves. Stations needed defense against jealous rivals or backstabbing chiefs.

This was a huge expense. Quark calculated costs. Finally shook his head:

"I cannot do this deal. Initial investment is unbearable." To prove he wasn't lying, he listed expenses to Liu San.

"I need to build or buy ships, hire enough hands; station needs fortification, cannons, weapons, a small garrison, precious gifts for chiefs—otherwise they won't catch slaves or give land for the station."

"We issue you a slave trade patent." Commerce and Diplomacy had prepared this. "Granting you monopoly on slave trade to Sanya for five years."

A patent! Quark's eyes lit up. With this, he could organize a joint-stock company, raise shares, pull in more merchants. Financial problems solved.

"How about it? You can form a joint-stock company." Liu San seemed to know his thoughts.

"Yes, with a patent, funding is easy." Quark lost interest in Li Luoyou's gun factory—how could that compare to slave trading's quick money!

"But it needs considerable time." Quark said. "I must go to Surat to raise shares. Buy ships, recruit men. Earliest first shipment by year's end."

Year-end coincided with Tiandu infrastructure completion and mining start. First batch would arrive just in time.

"Acceptable. But hurry. If you cannot deliver the first batch by December end, patent is void."

Quark, seeing wealth but having to wait half a year, burned with anxiety but agreed: "Good, I guarantee delivery."

"This patent includes only Southeast Asian natives. You may not traffic other slaves. Unless we request." Liu San warned. "Found carrying others once, patent void."

"I ask to set up a warehouse in this—San... ya." Quark proposed.

"Allowed. Since it's a trade port, merchants are welcome. As long as you follow our laws."

Simultaneously that night, a state meeting convened in Bairen City to discuss selling munitions to Li Luoyou.

Most opposed selling munitions: dangerous to sell quality weapons to a potential enemy. If Great Ming attacked, transmigrators didn't want to taste their own 12-pound Napoleon cannonballs. If Li Luoyou resold to Liaodong, consequences were severer—disrupting mainland balance. Historically Guan-Ning Army was a supply team, losing many firearms to Later Jin. The upcoming Dengzhou Mutiny would give Manchus fireams, soldiers, and technicians, enabling their own Red Barbarian Cannons. If Li Luoyou resold, firearm advantage would tilt to Later Jin earlier. Great Ming's firearm-reliant defense might collapse.

Some suggested making inferior cannons, slightly better than Red Barbarian ones, and selling good matchlocks. Open a weapon workshop for Great Ming.

"Comrades, weapons need metal. Our iron and copper rely on imports; they are strategic materials. Checked how much iron or bronze a cannon needs? Importing from Guangzhou to cast cannons to sell—too strange! We don't lack that money." Ma Qianzhu said. "Plus energy consumption—electricity or coal isn't abundant."

"Processing supplied materials? Li Luoyou supplies copper, iron, coal, plus extra..."

"Little significance." Zhan Wuya said: "Don't forget labor hours and machine wear. All costs."

Exporting weapons was vetoed. Someone proposed exporting Lingao's Type 30 Revolvers—low metal/labor, ammo uncopyable by Ming/Jin. Buying meant relying on Lingao for ammo.

"Revolvers can't be used in battle formations; to natives they're just ingenious contraptions. Generals and officials would love one for self-defense."

"Possible, but they might not want it. knowing it's a toy, Li Luoyou isn't stupid; he knows it's useless for big wars. Won't buy many."

"Also, I fear a Jinyiwei agent sneaking up on an Elder watching an opera and putting a round in his skull with a Type 30," said Wu Mu of Political Security, assessing risks.

Final decision: no munitions sales. Wu De suggested helping Li Luoyou build a gun factory.

"Not selling guns but selling a factory?" Cheng Dong couldn't understand. " putting the cart before the horse."

"Strictly speaking, selling simple equipment. Moderate technology diffusion," Wu De suggested selling simple industrial equipment.

"Like boring and rounding the bore—not in Chinese tradition. Selling dedicated cannon boring machines drastically improves their imitation of Red Barbarian Cannons. Power improves limitedly, not affecting our safety or mainland balance."

Besides boring machines, he suggested iron mold casting technology. Improves yield, durability, and efficiency.

"Iron mold casting isn't advanced. We'll use Rodman method and solid casting deep drilling. Iron mold won't affect our lead."

Also blowers to improve efficiency.

"Power? Steam engines?"

"Stage one: water turbines or windmills." Wu De said. "Of course provide gearboxes, otherwise useless."

"What benefit?" Ma Qianzhu didn't understand.

"Selling guns consumes resources; selling machines too."

"We can sell services. Seeing the parts maintenance bill, Li Luoyou will go mad." Zhan Wuya said.

"Don't just think of money. Selling guns to Chongzhen is net consumption; selling machines is blood creation," Wu De said. "We can't produce everything forever. Uneconomical. Sooner or later open production to private sectors. Since opening, we don't want them using handicrafts, or our equipment manufacturing won't develop—lack of orders."

Anyone seeing transmigrator factories was awed by industrial efficiency. Yang Shixiang wanted to mechanize his medicine factory, but Lingao's economy was weak; few could invest. Industry consumed population. Labor was tight; adding private industry demand worsened bottlenecks.

If the nearby, capital-rich, populous Pearl River Delta joined industrialization, Lingao's equipment manufacturing would develop hugely. And create dependency. Machine supply, maintenance, upgrade would rely on Lingao.
