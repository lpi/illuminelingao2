# Chapter 633 - Lai Da Takes Action

Gou Chengxuan remained cautious and didn't dare interject. Only after their discussion on the distinction between Huaxia and Barbarians concluded did he continue: "It is reported that Wen Desi's official title is 'Chairman,' while Ma Qianzhu's is 'Secretary of State.' The two titles together are called 'Executive Committee Members.'"

He hadn't gotten the names and titles wrong—they were displayed on bulletin boards and official documents.

"Or so it is said: this gang of Hair Thieves are descendants of high officials and dignitaries in the Aus-Song country. Due to political turmoil in their homeland, they could not establish themselves in Australia, so they led their troops and escaped by ship. Having long admired China's wealth, they crossed ten thousand *li* of ocean to reach these shores."

"Since they are descendants of Song people, why didn't they submit a memorial to become vassals in the beginning?" one staff officer asked. "The Court would surely have treated them favorably."

"The Hair Thieves learned strange skills and clever tricks overseas, believing they could dominate a corner by relying on iron ships and firearms. Is this not treating my Great Ming as if it lacked capable men? Only through severe suppression and extermination of this ugly kind can we cut off these overseas barbarians' covetous ambitions toward China!" The speaker was quite young—only twenty-seven or twenty-eight. He was not one of He Rubin's staff officers but Qian Taichong, a secretary of Zhao Ruyi, the Left Administration Vice Commissioner and Sub-prefectural Magistrate of Hainan, specifically sent to Guangzhou to serve as liaison between the two sides.

Qian Taichong had passed the *xiucai* examination at seventeen and become a stipended scholar. He enjoyed a considerable literary reputation in his hometown and was appreciated by a circle of local gentry. Since then, however, he had failed the provincial examination four consecutive times. Feeling too ashamed to face his neighbors any longer, he had simply left home to become a traveling advisor.

This man possessed real learning and talent and usually thought highly of himself. Although he had been recommended to Shi Bangyao's staff by fellow townsmen and teachers, his relationships with other staff members were far from harmonious. Zhao Ruyi had simply dispatched him to Guangzhou to handle liaison duties with He Rubin's army.

His impassioned statement compelled everyone to voice agreement, saying "Indeed it should be so," and similar affirmations.

After several more questions from the staff and generals, He Rubin instructed the personal guards to escort Gou Chengxuan out and keep him under guard within his own old camp.

"Take him down, give him wine and food. Treat him well."

Gou Chengxuan finally felt his suspended heart settle. The experience of appearing before officials and undergoing interrogation had been deeply uncomfortable. He quickly kowtowed several more times, then cautiously withdrew with the personal guards.

He was assigned to a special tent where Lai Da had been waiting. After a while, a personal guard brought him several sets of clothing—including scholar's attire like the square cap and scholar's robe. This made Gou Chengxuan, who had sometimes disguised himself as a beggar and sometimes dressed as a farmer, feel this was a good omen: the Commander-in-Chief seemed highly satisfied with his answers, otherwise he would never have been treated so kindly.

Lai Da also received several sets of new clothes. Master and servant bathed and changed, feeling refreshed. Then soldiers brought food, and the two ate their fill. Gou Chengxuan lay on the straw bunk, contemplating how he would take revenge and extort money after returning to Lingao with the government army. He calculated again and again, and before he knew it, fell into a deep sleep.

The next day, Chang Qingyun came to see him for a chat. Because he was a stripped *xiucai*—still half a member of the scholar-official class—Chang Qingyun was quite courteous, not requiring him to kneel when answering and conversing in a relatively casual manner.

After some polite exchanges, Chang Qingyun asked for clarification on details there hadn't been time to explore the previous day. Gou Chengxuan told everything he knew without reservation, explaining each point clearly. He also produced a written list of the major gentry and prominent households in the county, noting how much property each possessed and whether they maintained village militia.

Chang Qingyun was delighted to obtain this list. With it in hand, he could follow the map upon arriving in Lingao, knowing roughly how much military provisions to demand from each prominent household and how much "respect" each should contribute. Seeing that Gou Chengxuan had answered fluently and appropriately in the grand tent yesterday, he knew this man was no simple character and felt inclined to cultivate him. So he smiled at Gou Chengxuan: "May I ask for Brother Gou's courtesy name?"

"I dare not presume," Gou Chengxuan replied, but seeing Chang Qingyun's pleased expression and his inquiry about his courtesy name, he understood he was on the right track. With the recommendation and protection of the Commander's trusted secretary, he would not only be exonerated but his future fame and fortune would be assured—provided he curried favor successfully. "This lowly person's courtesy name is Zhongwei."

"His Excellency the Commander values you highly, saying you are worthy of being a loyal and righteous scholar of the Great Ming." Because Chang Qingyun still needed Gou Chengxuan to risk his life for the next stage, he fabricated a few encouraging sentences first. "The Commander intends to recommend you for a degree—"

At this point, he deliberately paused to gauge Gou Chengxuan's reaction. Seeing his eyes light up, knowing he had taken the bait, he continued: "However, you remain a wanted criminal, and your *xiucai* degree has been stripped..."

"This lowly brother was framed by the Hair Thieves," Gou Chengxuan sighed. He understood that if he had silver now, offering fifty or a hundred taels immediately to request this secretary's mediation could certainly remove his "wanted criminal" status. But he was penniless now, unable to produce money at all. "To be honest with brother, this lowly one possesses considerable land and property in Lingao. As soon as the Hair Thieves are driven out and I recover the family assets, I will surely reward you generously..."

"Ah, Brother Zhongwei treats me like a stranger by saying this." Chang Qingyun laughed. "As long as His Excellency the Commander achieves victory in this campaign, your crime can be washed clean, and you may even receive a commendation for merit."

Gou Chengxuan lacked experience in official circles and was easily deceived by a few sentences. "Yes, yes—this lowly brother will definitely serve like a dog or horse!"

Chang Qingyun then stated his purpose: He Rubin wanted him to return to Lingao to gather military intelligence and mobilize the village militia to support the government army.

"Brother Zhongwei is a Lingao native. Returning to Lingao with the Governor-General's proclamation to mobilize gentry and village militia—this is precisely a great opportunity for meeting the wind and clouds, for establishing merit and career!"

Gou Chengxuan was greatly alarmed. Barely escaped from the dragon's pool, and now he had to plunge back into the tiger's den? This was sending him to his death! In Lingao, he was a person hated by all, despised even by dogs. Even his own wife and father-in-law disliked him. If not for disfiguring his face and adopting disguises back then, he would have been caught and hanged by the Hair Thieves long ago.

Now Commander He actually wanted him to sneak back into Lingao. He understood the Australians' formidable capabilities all too well—their internal control and external defense were a hundred times better than the Court's. Local gentry and prominent households, no matter how dissatisfied with the Hair Thieves, would never dare openly oppose them. Moreover, everyone constantly feared that the Hair Thieves possessed some sorcery of "Thousand-*Li* Voice Transmission"; even private secret meetings might be detected.

If he made any move back in Lingao, there was only a dead end.

He replied tremulously: "This lowly person thanks His Excellency the Commander for the grace, only these Hair Thieves are different from other bandits..."

Chang Qingyun's expression changed. "Brother Zhongwei, this is the army. Do you understand that military law is merciless!"

"Yes, yes," Gou Chengxuan's legs went weak with terror. Setting aside his wanted criminal status, even an innocent commoner slapped with a "Hair Thief Spy" accusation could be beheaded instantly on command. "Please intercede for this lowly brother," he immediately dropped to his knees, begging piteously. "The Hair Thieves hate me to the bone. Once captured, I will be immediately executed by lingering death..." He knew empty begging like this was useless, so he quickly added that he possessed detailed knowledge of several major merchants supported by the Hair Thieves in Lingao, and he would share this intelligence exclusively with Chang Qingyun, "to count as brother's merit."

Seeing that there was no profit to be squeezed from him, Chang Qingyun cursed silently: *Country bumpkin! Pauper!*

The extortion opportunity had evaporated. But he couldn't push Gou Chengxuan too hard. After all, He Rubin hadn't explicitly ordered that Gou Chengxuan be sent to Lingao. If this man actually went back and was caught and killed, the government army entering Lingao would lose an important source of intelligence. Although Sun Tianbiao of the Lingao Wei-Suo was rushing from Zhaoqing day and night, he was a military household member with limited understanding of civilian affairs—far less useful than a local serpent like Gou Chengxuan.

Furthermore, Gou Chengxuan didn't look like a trustworthy person at first glance. Having no family or property here to serve as hostages, pushing him too hard might cause him to flee—or run directly to the Hair Thieves and betray government army intelligence.

The so-called proposal of sending Gou Chengxuan to Lingao to mobilize village militia was something He Rubin had merely mentioned in passing, with no fixed decision attached. Chang Qingyun had simply used threatening language to intimidate him, hoping to squeeze some profit.

Seeing there was genuinely nothing to gain, Chang Qingyun had to retreat a step, preparing to use his intercession before He Rubin as a favor owed.

He pondered for a moment and said: "This matter may have room for negotiation, but His Excellency the Commander's strict orders..." He deliberately assumed a troubled expression so Gou Chengxuan would feel obligated to him.

Gou Chengxuan said hastily: "Brother Qingyun, this lowly brother has a follower named Lai Da. This man is clever and quick-witted, also a Lingao native. He can undertake this mission."

Chang Qingyun saw that he was willing to offer a substitute, so he happily went along with it—but still uttered various words about the difficulty involved, making Gou Chengxuan beg piteously for quite a while before agreeing.

Having finally sent Chang Qingyun away, Gou Chengxuan hurriedly wiped the sweat from his brow. He had experienced the formidability of these officials—compared to the magistrate who pretended to be deaf and mute, these were all tigers that devoured men without spitting out the bones. Gou Chengxuan felt the terribleness of officialdom even more keenly.

He immediately called Lai Da over and told him everything that had just occurred. Gou Chengxuan sighed: "I have no choice either; I can only trouble you temporarily to go out and hide for a while."

Whether it was himself or Lai Da, even carrying an Imperial Decree to Lingao might not actually mobilize the village militia to support the government army. The prominent households wouldn't act until they saw the Hair Thieves truly defeated and fleeing. So his plan was to have Lai Da cross the sea to Qiongshan first, then lie low, waiting for the grand army to advance toward Lingao before following along behind.

Once the situation became clear, the village militia would probably stir into action. By then, Lai Da mixing among them could provide sufficient justification.

Unexpectedly, Lai Da didn't agree with this plan:

"Master, this can never deceive the lords." Lai Da said, "This small one is willing to go to Lingao!"

"You'll go to Lingao?" Gou Chengxuan was surprised. "Isn't that throwing your life away for nothing? Those prominent households originally had rifts with the Gou family, and now, awed by the Hair Thieves' might, they absolutely will not dare support the government army." The only people at his disposal now were the Lai brothers. If any prominent household hoping to curry favor with the Hair Thieves caught Lai Da and handed him over, he would either lose his life or be condemned to dig stones.

"Not necessarily." Lai Da said. "Except for a few families who have followed the Hair Thieves to the bitter end, most prominent households are fence-sitters. Why wouldn't they fear the government army's arrival for suppression?"

As long as they were afraid, they could be managed. Returning to Lingao with the Governor-General's and Commander-in-Chief's official documents, the prominent households wouldn't dare to respond immediately—but they absolutely wouldn't dare to harm him either.

"...The Hair Thieves have been in Lingao for three years; prominent households inevitably have dealings with them. After the government army recovers Lingao, the Court will appoint rehabilitation officials. The first order of business will be investigating Han traitors. If they have government documents in hand, they will not only escape the crime of aiding rebels but also gain the merit of maintaining local order..."

Gou Chengxuan grasped his meaning. This scheme did carry risks, but the returns were enormous. He couldn't help regarding this wretched-looking servant with new eyes.

"I never expected you, at such a young age, to harbor such deep strategy in your breast!"

"This small one was forced into it!" Lai Da's eyes blazed with fire. "Since the stockade fell, we two brothers escaped with our lives by luck. Day and night, we think of nothing but revenge..."

Gou Chengxuan understood why Lai Da hated the Hair Thieves so intensely. Beyond losing his former status as a powerful household slave—no longer able to act tyrannically, now trampled upon by others—another critical reason was that the woman he had wanted, Chuqing, had been abducted by the Hair Thieves. Chuqing had been a maidservant in Second Master Gou's household, originally promised to Lai Da. After the Gou family's destruction, he heard she had fallen into the hands of a Hair Thief surnamed Wu who managed a farm. This man already had three wives and four concubines, yet he had taken Chuqing as well. Lai Da had glimpsed Chuqing on the road several times, his eyes practically spitting fire, yet he dared not step forward to say a word—he had even deliberately avoided her. Such bitter hatred for a stolen woman was incomparable.

Lai Da continued: "...As long as this small one isn't captured by the Hair Thieves, there is absolutely no risk with the prominent households. I can also gather some military intelligence along the way."

"Excellent! This matter is entrusted to you!" Gou Chengxuan pretended to be generous. "All gifts from the prominent households—I want none of them. They shall all be your reward!"

"This small one thanks the Master for his magnanimous reward!" Lai Da immediately knelt and kowtowed. "After the government troops recover Lingao, with the Master's abilities and status as a local native, how could the government's rehabilitation effort possibly lack his services? This small one goes ahead to pave the way for the Master. When that day comes, those prominent households will have no choice but to conform to your will, round or square!"

"Which family will you approach first?"

"Huang Family Stockade."

Gou Chengxuan was unwilling. He had originally planned to accuse the Huang family of "attaching to the thieves" and destroy them utterly.

"Master!" Lai Da understood his thoughts. "We cannot bring down the Huang family! The mere fact that his third son was killed by the Hair Thieves puts him in an unassailable position! Huang Family Stockade commands strong soldiers and well-trained militia, and they bear a blood feud with the Hair Thieves. Asking them to mobilize their village braves for support will not be difficult."

Gou Chengxuan considered and found this reasonable, so he grudgingly accepted. He could only curse Old Dog Huang and Villain Huang resentfully to himself. Then he sighed: "I only regret that Father's whereabouts remain unknown. Otherwise, his forces and Uncle Hu's men could also lend their aid."

"Since the Hair Thieves did not capture Master Hu, the Old Master must naturally be safe as well," Lai Da reassured him. "This small one will search secretly after returning!"

After the discussion was settled, Chang Qingyun went to deal with the Commander once more. He Rubin was originally indifferent to this matter, but seeing that someone was willing to take the risk without costing him a single soldier, he immediately issued the necessary documents and rewarded ten taels of silver. Lai Da folded the issued papers into strips, wrapped them in oiled paper, sewed them tightly in cloth, and then stitched them into his belt. Someone arranged for him to take passage on a troop transport to Qiongshan.

---

In the operations room of the Maniao Headquarters, staff officers were conducting battle planning around a massive sand table. He Ming and all officers of battalion level and above overlooked the entire layout from a slightly elevated viewing platform nearby. This sand table had been constructed using electronic maps brought from the old space-time, supplemented by field survey corrections from the Special Reconnaissance Team and Exploration Team. Not only was the scale accurate, but the detail was rendered with astonishing precision—this was the handiwork of a group of scale-model enthusiasts. Even the bridges and villages on the sand table—though pitifully tiny—had been given weathering treatment.

The sand table represented the terrain from Lingao to Qiongshan County, compressed into this enormous tactical display.

Where to engage the suppressing Ming army was the first question the General Staff had to decide.

He Ming and most of his officers believed that defending within Lingao's territory was not feasible. The Fubo Army must crush the Ming forces outside Lingao while ensuring that most prisoners could be captured.

The first option was a battle near Qiongshan County seat. The Fubo Army would exploit its ships and overland marching mobility to appear suddenly beneath Qiongshan's walls while the Ming army had just assembled and hadn't yet established a secure foothold, routing He Rubin's entire force. The routed enemy would inevitably retreat into Qiongshan County seat, whereupon the Fubo Army would storm the city to capture prisoners.

The chief advantage of this plan was minimizing prisoner escapes, ensuring that most routed soldiers were captured. The disadvantage was that troops would have to carry heavy weapons and supplies for a hundred kilometers to reach Qiongshan. Although ships could transport some material, soldiers would still need to carry their own essential equipment. They would be severely exhausted by such a long march.

Finally, if Qiongshan fell, the Great Ming would lose a prefecture and county. Moreover, Qiongshan was the capital county of Qiongzhou Prefecture—the shock of losing the prefectural seat was far greater than losing a mere county town. Furthermore, the Surveillance Vice Commissioner and Sub-prefectural Magistrate of Hainan were both inside Qiongshan's walls. On the day the city fell, the officials committing suicide for the dynasty wouldn't include only a simple seventh-rank magistrate, but also the Qiongzhou Prefect, the Hainan Sub-prefectural Magistrate, and other important figures. The incident would become very large indeed.

For these reasons, this plan was quickly rejected.

The second plan proposed fighting beneath the walls of Chengmai County seat, using You Laohu's camp as a base to defeat the Ming army. The marching distance would be considerably shorter. The disadvantage was that some Ming troops would flee toward Qiongshan, some into Chengmai, and still others would scatter in all directions.

The third plan called for an ambush at the mountain pass south of Ma'ao (Maniao). They would position troops in ambush on the mountains flanking the route, using Ma'ao's Small Round City as a frontal anchor point, hoping to capture the majority of Ming troops on the battlefield. The advantage was that their side would be rested and waiting. Battlefield infrastructure was also very comprehensive. The disadvantage was that routed Ming soldiers might flee into Lingao territory.

After evaluation, consensus emerged that engaging the enemy within Chengmai's territory represented the most balanced choice. The geographical position was moderate; the Fubo Army's maneuvering distance would not be excessive, conserving transport capacity. Evacuating wounded and prisoners would also be convenient.

For the government army to attack Lingao, given their mobility and logistical constraints, they would inevitably advance via the postal road.

Departing from Qiongshan County seat, the postal road passed through Binlian, Yelie, Beipu, Daotang, then on to Chengmai County seat. The Fubo Army could intercept the government forces at any point along this road.
