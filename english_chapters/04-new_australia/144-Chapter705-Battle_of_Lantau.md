# Chapter 705 - Battle of Lantau

Could it be internal strife within the gang? Zheng Bao feared infighting most of all. His men had been hastily assembled over recent months, their relationships barely more than simple partnerships. He'd only been acknowledged as "Boss" because his force was the strongest. Who knew what might have sparked a conflict below?

A trusted follower burst in: "Boss! Outside! Outside..." His face was contorted with terror, unable to form words.

"Damn it!" Zheng Bao cursed, knowing something serious had happened. He hurriedly strapped on his saber and rushed out, surrounded by his retainers.

Zheng Bao saw the most terrifying sight of his life: Trails of fire dragging black smoke crisscrossed the sky, plunging toward Tung Chung like meteors.

Ships in the harbor and buildings on shore blazed furiously. Black flames of fire in the sky emitted horrifying shrieks, continuously crashing down. Flames and explosions blanketed the entire Tung Chung harbor.

For a moment, Zheng Bao thought he was dreaming, standing frozen in shock.

"Boss, what do we do now?" his entourage asked urgently.

Zheng Bao started, suddenly awakening: "Quick! To the ships!" He waved his hand and led the charge toward the Tung Chung docks.

Zheng Bao made his living through murder and arson—unconscionable acts. Sometimes he'd thought about things like "hell." He'd never imagined he would see hell while still alive. The road to the Tung Chung docks was strewn with charred corpses and collapsed buildings. Everywhere lay scattered, twisted black iron casings. Not a single building wasn't burning; even the jetties had caught fire. Looking out, the harbor waters were covered with burning ships, some already half-sunk.

Above their heads, rockets occasionally emitted their terrifying screams before slamming into the ground. Each impact made Zheng Bao shudder. Some men simply dropped to the ground, crawling on all fours as if this might take them farther from these terrible death-gods in the sky.

They finally fought their way to the shore. The jetties had burned to fragments. Ships in Tung Chung harbor that hadn't caught fire were all weighing anchor and setting sail, heading for the mouth of the bay. Surrounded by followers, Zheng Bao found a small boat, and they bundled him aboard his flagship.

"Quickly! Weigh anchor and set sail. Raise my banner!" The moment Zheng Bao boarded, he didn't bother with his disheveled appearance, issuing order after order. The situation was chaotic; everyone was thinking only of escape. If he didn't immediately sail out of the bay and show his colors to steady morale, his "great pirate band" would scatter like frightened birds in an instant.

Through Shi Zhiqi's telescope, the effect of the rocket bombardment on the harbor was highly impressive. The burning ships in the bay were the best demonstration of this tactic. Through the smoke, he could see many ships racing toward the bay mouth. Some ships were already on fire, pirates fighting the flames while fleeing.

"Report to the Commander: The majority of enemy vessels are fleeing toward open sea," Shi Zhiqi said with satisfaction. "The pirates have collapsed inside Tung Chung harbor."

The female signals operator beside him quickly recorded his order, then ran to the walkie-talkie operator—in reality, just a two-way radio.

Shi Zhiqi commanded: "Fire another hundred!" The rockets hauled up the mountain couldn't very well be carried back down; might as well expend them all.

The bombardment of 400 rockets transformed Tung Chung harbor into a hell of fire and smoke. By comparison, the shells fired by the few 12-pounder howitzers had negligible effect.

Chen Haiyang's fleet waited in battle formation outside Tung Chung Mouth. Every special-service boat had its broadside facing the bay entrance. All gun ports were open. When stray pirate ships fled out of the harbor, they were met by concentrated volleys. Not a single ship could escape the terrifying combined firepower of a dozen special-service boats opening fire simultaneously. After the dense smoke of each salvo cleared, pirate ships showed only toppled masts, shattered planks, and decks strewn with corpses—many headless or limbless, some reduced to bloody chunks of human flesh.

The expected naval battle never materialized. Only the special-service boats methodically firing and adjusting their headings. The sailors were already highly experienced, using a Sino-Western hybrid sailing technique: controlling the ships with sails and sculls. Gunnery masters trained by naval artillery sergeants used simple wooden rangefinders to measure distance and angle, observed currents and wind, then rapidly calculated firing angles on their slide rules. Gunners in the smoke-filled decks and gun compartments adjusted their aim, then pulled the firing lanyards on command. A devastating broadside needed only one hit to cripple a pirate ship.

Outside Tung Chung Mouth, pirate ships drifted everywhere with toppled masts and broken yards, burning fiercely, littered with corpses—the devastation matching that inside the bay.

Wang You and the ten-odd ships he'd brought along fled the bay in chaos and disarray. He silently cursed the Australians for attacking without so much as a warning—he'd barely escaped with his life. But he knew this wasn't the time for complaints. He ordered his men to hoist the white flag and signal colors secretly agreed upon with Shi Fourteen and the others at the masthead. Sure enough, the Australian warships avoided firing at any ship bearing the agreed signal. Wang You's ten-odd ships reached the open sea unscathed, then were disarmed one by one by waiting special-service boats coming alongside.

The surrendering pirates raised not the slightest complaint, obediently submitting to disarmament under marine guard and sailing toward Hong Kong Island. After witnessing the overwhelming firepower of the Australians, no one believed they had any bargaining position left.

Zheng Bao's flagship struggled out of the bay and barely managed to rally seven or eight ships. He had already heard from the gunfire outside that Australian warships were blocking the exit, but he had no choice but to fight his way out—staying inside Tung Chung harbor under artillery suppression from the surrounding heights meant certain death.

In a moment when the smoke cleared, he glimpsed the Australasian Song fleet in the sunlight—neat columns, flying banners, cannons glinting with blue-green light... A profound sense of inferiority welled up within him. Just days ago, he had actually thought he could challenge the Australians.

Overestimating himself. This thought had barely flashed through his mind when several special-service boats fired simultaneously upon him. One salvo swept across Zheng Bao's flagship deck; a cannonball grazed past Zheng Bao, tearing him in half.

Zheng Bao's death caused little reaction on the battlefield. No one even noticed. In fact, before his flagship sank, the entire pirate fleet had already disintegrated. Each ship, each man, thought only of personal escape—and so they crashed one after another into Chen Haiyang's guns.

By 5 PM, Chen Haiyang ordered a cease-fire, allowing a handful of ships to escape—they would serve as unpaid promoters of the Australasian Song military's might. The entire sea surface outside Tung Chung lay in ruins, everywhere burning ships. Some vessels hadn't caught fire; their battered hulls drifted aimlessly, lifeless. The sea was scattered with individual pirates who had jumped overboard to escape. Ships whose crews had been quick-witted enough lowered their sails and flags, signaling surrender.

Shi Zhiqi commanded the marines and the temporary landing force of sailors as they charged down from the mountains around Tung Chung, occupying the villages and docks the pirates had infested. They captured several hundred pirates who hadn't made it onto ships in time and seized many abandoned sampans and long-dragons, plus several large ships. The marines encountered virtually no resistance as they took complete control of Tung Chung harbor.

Shi Zhiqi, accompanied by guards, orderlies, and signalmen, swagger into the still-burning Tung Chung. He stood by the burning jetty, the marine banner flying behind him.

Shi Zhiqi lit a pipe—though he'd never actually smoked one. Huang Zhuazi raised his camera and clicked off seven or eight shots from different angles: Shi Zhiqi leisurely smoking and observing the battlefield in the sunlight; Shi Zhiqi with burning ships in the background; Shi Zhiqi with the marines who had just occupied the jetty and taken Tung Chung behind him...

"Are you satisfied now? All glorious images."

"Pity the *Lingao Times* is so stingy about publishing photos." Shi Zhiqi coughed a few times, emptied the pipe, and had his orderly stow it away.

Pirates who hadn't reached the ships or had swum back from the sea were being rounded up in droves. Lines of prisoners bound together in strings stumbled toward the shore, awaiting vessels to transport them to Hong Kong Island—they would undergo "reformation" in the local purification camp while serving as much-needed labor.

After 5 PM, all land and sea fighting concluded. The navy's total casualties amounted to seventeen wounded—all minor injuries. But ammunition consumption had been enormous; the Hale rockets originally reserved for the Pearl River campaign were nearly exhausted.

Yet captured prisoners alone exceeded 2,000. Ships towed back from the sea or seized in the bay numbered 24 large vessels that were intact or repairable with minor work. Despite the massive destruction, over 50 sampans and long-dragons—highly useful in inland waterways—remained intact or salvageable.

Even vessels beyond repair were all towed back if they hadn't sunk or burned up. Chen Haiyang planned to salvage their timber. Even the useless portions could serve as fuel. The marines recovered large quantities of supplies and treasure from Zheng Bao's old camp in the villages—quite a windfall.

Tung Chung's two villages had been half-destroyed by the rockets. The fishing boats moored at shore were almost entirely destroyed. Chen Haiyang ordered the remaining villagers evacuated to Hong Kong Island for resettlement. The other villages would go untouched for now. Lantau was unsuitable as a military base; after conducting necessary sweeps, Chen Haiyang ordered the entire force to withdraw to Hong Kong Island.
