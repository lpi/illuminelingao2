# Chapter 636 - Continuing the Hair Thieves' Background

"Although the Hair Thieves' cannons are not heavy, their power cannot be underestimated." Gou Chengxuan then described the scene of firepower demonstration during the military parade. He even shrank his neck when mentioning the violent explosion in the target area during the bombardment.

"The Hair Thieves merely buried sulfur and saltpeter under the mound and ignited them with cannonballs, that's all." He Rubin smiled and said to his attendants, "This kind of trick is nothing new; it only scares ignorant locals."

The staff and generals offered another round of praise, such as "Your Excellency has high insight," "Seeing clearly like looking at a fire," "Foreseeing with candle-like illumination," and so on.

"You said you fought the Hair Thieves yourself. What formations do they use when engaging? What methods do they mostly use to break stockades and attack cities? How do they slaughter? Explain one by one!"

Gou Chengxuan secretly complained; saying he had fought the Hair Thieves was nonsense. When the Gou Family Village was massacred, he had fled with his father long ago; how could he have seen how the Australians attacked the stockade? He only learned from others later that they finally broke the stockade by blowing up the gate with gunpowder.

As for the Australians' field battles, when Huang Shoutong led the county's village braves to attack Bairen Stockade, the Gou Family Village sent over ten braves. So although he didn't go to the front personally, he learned a lot from the returning braves, enough to bluff.

He then narrated the process of the transmigrator group attacking Gou Family Village and Huang Shoutong leading militia to attack Bairen Stockade. Naturally, there was much fabrication in it, but Gou Chengxuan was a Xiucai after all, with literary logic and eloquence superior to ordinary rural tyranny and commoners, so he spoke quite coherently. The staff and generals present listened very carefully.

He Rubin asked a few more military questions. Gou Chengxuan actually knew very little about the military aspects of the transmigrator group. After all, he was just a commoner and dared not watch the excitement near training grounds and ports often to avoid suspicion. He basically relied on street gossip; even so, he was considered someone who knew much about the "Hair Thieves'" military affairs.

What Gou Chengxuan actually knew more about was intelligence on the transmigrator group's civil administration, infrastructure, and social relations, but He Rubin had little interest in this. The Hair Thieves building roads, digging rivers, and building dams had no meaning to him.

Regarding He Rubin's questions, he answered as much as he knew, and for those he wasn't clear about, he casually made things up. He also picked things he knew the Great Ming people would find novel and described them with embellishments. For example, the Hair Thieves kept a group of women specially responsible for caring for patients, and there were also women in the Hair Thief army, organized into a separate team for running errands and delivering messages, etc.

"The Hair Thieves claim to be descendants of the Great Song. I see that even if it's true, having been overseas for a long time, they have been infected with the customs of overseas barbarians." A staff officer said.

"The Hair Thieves are truly a gang of lewd and lustful people!" Chang Qingyun couldn't help but comment, "Actually employing women in the army! The army is a place of supreme yang; women mixing in it violates the Heavenly Way. How can they not be defeated!"

"This statement is incorrect! There were women in armies in ancient times too; it's not strange." Although He Rubin was very polite to Lu Yizhong after he joined his staff and gave generous gifts, he obviously "honorably supported" him and didn't talk much with him during real discussions. This made Lu Yizhong, the Advisor known for "knowing soldiers," very unhappy. Especially Chang Qingyun, relying on being the Commander's confidant, was most prominent usually. This time Lu decided to severely dampen his spirit, so he commented immediately, "From Princess Pingyang of the Tang Dynasty in the distant past to Pacification Commissioner Qin of our dynasty recently. Last year when Pacification Commissioner Qin led troops to serve the King, she was summoned once by the Emperor on the platform and bestowed four imperial poems, which is still praised within the seas. What is so strange about Hair Thieves having a few women in the army?"

This hat was not only big but heavy, citing both ancient and contemporary examples. Qin Liangyu's reputation was huge at the time, and she had received the Emperor's bestowal; Chang Qingyun didn't even have room to defend himself. His face flushed red, and he fell silent in embarrassment.

Because there was an example from the current dynasty, and Lu Yizhong brought out the Emperor's brand, no one dared to say words like women in the camp violated the Heavenly Way anymore.

"Your Excellencies may not know, but among the Hair Thieves, there are many female officials and female generals." Seeing the lords were very interested in this matter, Gou Chengxuan knew the topic was on the right track, so he hurriedly listed the famous female Senators in the transmigrator group one by one. Although there were dozens of female Senators in the transmigrator group, for a local like Gou Chengxuan who was not in the system, the ones they were most familiar with were those who often appeared in public, such as Li Mei, Du Wen, and Dong Weiwei.

"...Hair Thief women are mostly tall, mostly over five chi. They claim to be descendants of Huaxia, yet are very different from Chinese women—"

Gou Chengxuan stole a glance at the expressions of the staff and generals. Seeing they didn't show impatience or annoyance, he continued to say that Hair Thief women were not only tall but also had larger body frames than Chinese women, with very fair skin, all having natural feet, walking and running freely. They read and recognized characters the same way, and even practiced using firearms...

He spoke with flying spittle, adding many hearsay and fabricated elements. Everyone listened entranced. Chang Qingyun thought to himself, wondering what these Hair Thief women with thin waists, broad shoulders, big breasts, fat buttocks, fair skin, and big eyes looked like, and couldn't help feeling a burst of restlessness in his heart. He calculated that once success was achieved, he must find a way to seek a few True Hair women to interrogate carefully.

Until He Rubin coughed, Gou Chengxuan's speech about "Hair Thief women" finally came to a pause.

"You have been in Lingao for a long time. How do the local gentry of Lingao get along with the Hair Thieves? Is the heart of the people usable?"

Gou Chengxuan's spirit rose greatly: as long as he insisted a certain household colluded with the Hair Thieves, when the Imperial Army arrived, this family would at least lose wealth or at worst suffer extermination. It was a great opportunity for personal revenge and enriching his own pockets.

Precisely because of this, he had to handle it carefully. having stayed in various places in Guangdong for over a year following his father to file complaints, his horizons had broadened greatly. He knew the local gentry had immense power; many small rural officials looked unimpressive and didn't have much wealth, yet were connected to central officials in the provincial capital and the two capitals of North and South by myriad ties. Same year graduates, fellow townsmen, old family friendships, teachers and friends... linked into networks that even high court officials had to scruple. If he accused improperly, he would only invite imprisonment or even death upon himself.

Gou Chengxuan had long secretly noted the few households who colluded deepest with the Hair Thieves, originally preparing to take the opportunity to extort a big sum once the government army arrived in Lingao. There were also a few households who couldn't be said to collude with Hair Thieves, just following the flow to supply grain, pay, and laborers. But because they had either offended the Gou family in the past or were wealthy, they were all listed in Gou Chengxuan's "Seducing Hair Thieves" list.

First, he wanted to punish Huang Shoutong. This old villain had always been hostile to the Gou family in the past, speaking ill of his family before the magistrate several times. Gou Chengxuan also knew Huang Shoutong had once conspired with the previous magistrate to arrest the entire Gou family in one stroke for the crime of harboring bandits. Fortunately, the previous magistrate feared arresting the Gou family would invite pirate retaliation, so he dropped it.

If he could label this old bastard Huang Shoutong as "submitting to thieves" this time, the Huang Family Stockade would be doomed eternally! Gou Chengxuan secretly hoped so.

But Huang Shoutong was no ordinary figure. He himself had cooperated with government troops many times to fight Li people and defend against pirates, a renowned figure locally. The Hainan government troops relied on him heavily. His second son had an academic degree. Back then, he was the one who took the lead in attacking Bairen Stockade, and his third son was killed by the Hair Thieves; this was known to everyone in Lingao. It was hard to implicate him.

Recently, due to land measurement, Huang Shoutong's second son Huang Bingkun had linked up with Liu Dalin again. The weight of one word from Liu Dalin was much stronger than his own. Thinking of this, he decided not to name who colluded with the Hair Thieves for now, leaving some room.

Gou Chengxuan said cautiously: "Although Lingao is a southern border land, the Court's heavenly prestige still exists. There are those who collude with gentry in secret, but this lowly person has never seen anyone openly submit to thieves. If investigated carefully, there might be matters handled covertly..."

Gou Chengxuan raised his head slightly and looked at He Rubin. Seeing him smiling yet not smiling without expression, he knew the Commander didn't want to determine who was "following thieves" so quickly, and understood the superior's mind. "Once the Court's heavenly soldiers arrive, the gentry will naturally serve the Court with utmost sincerity."

"So, Lingao's public sentiment is usable?"

Gou Chengxuan knew that although most Lingao people feared being implicated after the government army arrived, they had absolutely no good feelings for the government. Many people, having just lived a relatively stable life, even held great aversion to the government's suppression. Even among local gentry and big households, not a few had such thoughts—compared to Hair Thieves occupying Lingao, they feared the government army arriving to rob grain, kill people, and extort wealth at will even more. As for the changing Australians' own subjects, they were even more hostile to the government, showing quite a spirit of hatred against the common enemy. The government didn't even have the people's hearts in Lingao; how could it be "usable"?

But he dared not say such words, so he had to say very euphemistically:

"Lingao people long for the King's Master like longing for rain during a drought. only the Hair Thieves have monstrous power in Lingao, with strict laws and harsh punishments usually, and many spies and patrols. A slight carelessness in speech leads to arrest for hard labor. Moreover, Hair Thief firearms are sharp; breaking stockades is as easy as turning a hand. Even gentry and big households have to compromise, daring not slacken slightly in giving grain and men."

"Magistrate Wu is still in the county city; the Great Ming government is still there. Why are the people so afraid of the Hair Thieves?"

Hearing this was a chance to speak ill of Wu Mingjin, Gou Chengxuan quickly said: "Although Master Wu holds the county city without loss, he is trapped in an isolated city. Government orders don't go out of the city gates. Hair Thieves enter and leave Lingao County almost like it's uninhabited land."

He Rubin just uttered an "Mm." Whether Wu Mingjin neglected his duty or not had nothing to do with him. He was most concerned about Lingao's local grain and village brave situation.

Gou Chengxuan said there was not much grain stored in the county. There was a wind disaster last year; the Wenlan River flooded, subordinating many fields. Autumn grain production decreased a lot.

"Since production decreased a lot, where does the Hair Thieves' grain come from?"

"Hair Thieves abducted commoners from the mainland to farm for them. Hair Thieves have secret methods for farming, harvesting much more grain than ordinary commoners." Gou Chengxuan knew army fighting was an opportunity for everyone from top to bottom to make a fortune. To inspire morale, he immediately spoke extravagantly, claiming Hair Thieves stored massive amounts of grain and rice in their stockade, and much sugar transported from Leizhou. As for various Australian goods, they were piled up like mountains... This speech made everyone present reveal looks of greed. The wealth of Australians already had a small reputation in Guangdong, especially with the confiscation of the three Purple shops' properties, which reportedly seized countless wealth and goods; everyone involved made a small fortune. Since Lingao was their base camp, wealth and goods must be countless.

As for village braves, Gou Chengxuan said although there were many local village braves, being weak and unable to match Hair Thief firearms, they only defended within stockades.

He Rubin and the staff generals asked about the Hair Thieves' deployment in Lingao again. Gou Chengxuan said the Hair Thieves had five camps in Lingao, not just the one Bopu camp. This news attracted great attention from him because so far, all garrison reports mentioning Hair Thief camps only mentioned Bopu, never mentioning other ones.

He Rubin immediately ordered a map brought and asked him to mark the locations one by one.

"This lowly one doesn't know maps..."

"No matter, just say the place names." He Rubin instructed a master advisor in charge of maps to mark them on the map according to the locations he said.

"Hair Thieves have five main camps in total: Bairen, Bopu, Maniao, Gaoshan, and Nanbao. There are also multiple arrow towers and forts." Seeing the Commander paying such attention, Gou Chengxuan couldn't help feeling invigorated and showed off.

The advisor circled the locations on the map according to the names he said, then presented it to the desk.

He Rubin took a rough look and was secretly startled. If this Gou Chengxuan was correct, then the Hair Thieves' penetration in Lingao far exceeded original estimates. They didn't just occupy the river mouth and coastal ports like Westerners—Nanbao was already on the border of the Li area, the hinterland of Lingao County.

"Hair Thieves use Bairen as the heartland; most True Hairs live there," Gou Chengxuan said. "It is heard that Fake Governor Wen Desi and Ma Qianzhu also live there. All Hair Thief orders issue from Bairen Stockade. This stockade is extremely strictly guarded, with high walls and deep ditches, surrounded by iron thorn nets. Even their trusted Fake Hairs cannot enter. They set up a market outside the stockade to seduce merchants to trade..."

He Rubin suddenly darkened his face and scolded: "Bold!"

Gou Chengxuan was speaking enthusiastically when suddenly He Rubin shouted angrily, scaring him to kneel prostrate immediately, daring not speak.

Because Lu Yizhong was present, Gou Chengxuan's statement overturned the original claim that Hair Thieves used Bopu as their base camp. And this was the tone set by the Governor-General. Now this local Lingao native openly said there was a Bairen Stockade less than ten-odd li from the county city, which was the Hair Thieves' old camp.

What this person said was nine out of ten true, but denying the leader's judgment was unacceptable—true in ancient and modern times alike.

"This Commander has long heard of the Hair Thieves' old camp, which is at Bopu. Where does your so-called Bairen Strong Stockade come from?! Are you deceiving this Commander?"

"Lowly one dares not, lowly one dares not," Gou Chengxuan kowtowed repeatedly, thoughts spinning fast. He was speaking fine; why did Lord He suddenly deny Bairen Stockade's existence? Bairen City's scale and defense were second to none among Australian camps in all of Lingao. Even if he didn't say it, spies sent by the government army could see it.

His mind was extremely flexible, deciding instantly: whatever the reason for He Rubin's anger, he must follow his words. He hurriedly said:

"Yes, yes, lowly one is ignorant. This was originally hearsay of this lowly one; unable to distinguish for a moment, I spoke nonsense. However, there is indeed a stockade at Bairen, defended by hundreds of Hair Thieves."

He Rubin glanced sideways at Lu Yizhong, seeing him only stroking his beard and nodding. Knowing Gou Chengxuan's words were fairly appropriate, he softened his tone: "Continue!"

"Yes, yes." Gou Chengxuan kowtowed and then described the location and defenses of several camps. He hadn't personally spied on Nanbao and Gaoshan Ridge camps—he heard Nanbao was mining and quarrying and feared being grabbed for labor if he went rashly. As for Gaoshan Ridge, although it was on the old site of Gou Family Village, he heard the defense was very strict, completely prohibiting unrelated locals from going. So he dared not spy either.

But from He Rubin's attitude just now, he surmised the government army didn't hope for Hair Thieves to have many camps. So he described Nanbao, Gaoshan Ridge, etc., as small stockades not large in scale, each garrisoned by a few hundred Fake Hairs. But he dared not say the same for Maniao, because he passed Maniao when leaving Lingao and saw with his own eyes that a round city and forts had been built there, with large numbers of troops assembled. If he made the government army underestimate the enemy and suffer a defeat at Maniao, his own head would be lost.

Fortunately, seeing he was quick-witted and admitted Bopu was the Hair Thieves' old camp, He Rubin showed no signs of further anger. He then boldly finished his words.

Lu Yizhong suddenly asked: "You said the Hair Thieves' heads are named..."

"Reporting to Your Excellency, one is Ma Qianzhu, one is Wen Desi."

"Have you seen these two?"

"The lowly one only saw from a distance." Gou Chengxuan spoke the truth here. He simply dared not get too close to the transmigrators, let alone the big chiefs among them.

"What positions were these two given in their country? Do they have noble titles? Why not avoid the danger of ten thousand miles of waves to lead Hair Thieves to my Great Ming to harass?" Compared to He Rubin, Lu Yizhong cared more about the Hair Thieves' origins. "Heard they claim to be descendants of Huaxia; is there such a thing?"

Gou Chengxuan said: "Reporting to Your Excellency, Hair Thieves indeed claim to be descendants of Huaxia. They know Han characters, only use vulgar forms for writing entirely. According to their own claim: they are descendants of Song people. After the ancestors were defeated at Yashan back then, they led troops and ships south, experiencing hardships, and encountered a big island named Australia. Seeing its water and soil were abundant, they established a country in Australia, named 'Aus-Song'."

This rumor had reached Guangdong long ago, but not in such detail. Lu Yizhong became very interested.

"Since they use Song as the country name, is the ruler a descendant of the Song Emperor?"

"The lowly one does not know." Gou Chengxuan got these from hearsay too.

A staff officer beside said: "If they are descendants of the Song house, how can they cut hair and wear short clothes? Isn't that changing Xia into Yi?"

"When in Yi, enter Yi; when in Huaxia, enter Huaxia." Lu Yizhong shook his head and rolled his brain, saying, "Listing in overseas barbarian lands for a long time, it is unavoidable."

"In this student's view, this gang of Hair Thieves merely falsely use the name of the Song house."
