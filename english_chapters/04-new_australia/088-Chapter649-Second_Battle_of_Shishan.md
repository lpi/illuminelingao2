# Chapter 649 Second Battle of Shishan

"It's a Regional Commander." Zhu Mingxia said with some regret, "I thought it would be at least a Vice General..."

Xiong Maozhang crouched in front of the corpse and examined it for a long time, saying: "There is only one Vice General in the whole of Guangdong. I heard people from the Great Library say that Regional Commanders, Vice Generals, and Regional Commanders are all very valuable right now. Not like later when Regional Commanders and Vice Generals were all over the streets."

"Huizhou Regional Commander, Huizhou Regional Commander..." Zhu Mingxia thought for a long time before remembering. *Isn't this one of the five Regional Commanders and one Guerrilla of the Ming army coming to suppress us mentioned in the [Enemy Intelligence Report]?* The report explicitly stated at that time that these six generals were regular military officers of the Imperial Court who established their own headquarters, not comparable to ordinary Regional Commanders and Guerrillas.

If put that way, this battle was roughly equivalent to killing an enemy Major General Division Commander.

Commanding a battle for the first time and achieving such a great victory, Zhu Mingxia couldn't help but be secretly happy, repeatedly saying "Good," "Good."

Several soldiers beside him saw the Battalion Commander so happy and knew they must have killed a great general of the government army. According to the custom at that time, the head should be cut off to present for merit. A soldier picked up a big saber from the side and was about to chop off the head.

"Don't chop." Zhu Mingxia stopped him. "He died for his country. Encoffin him properly and bury him with military honors!"

At 4 PM, the three thousand men and horses led by Sha Jianbi appeared less than three kilometers from Shishan. Because Yan Zungao urged men and horses to walk fast, causing many infantrymen to fall behind and finally be defeated fighting Hair Bandits with insufficient strength, he did not urge his subordinates to walk fast. Along the way, he also collected many routed soldiers from Yan's unit and learned the whole process of the battle from their mouths.

However, he could get absolutely no situation report beyond the visual range of front, back, left, and right of the post road. No matter how many scouts and spies he sent out, not one could return. A wounded scout once galloped back madly, but was suddenly killed by a "bird gun" before reaching him.

What flustered him most was that he actually didn't know where the bird gun was fired from—no smoke, no people. He sent a squad of infantry to search back and forth within four hundred paces around where the scout fell, finding nothing in the end. Only two small black holes on the scout's body proved he was killed by a bird gun.

Fear of bird guns that showed no smoke, no people, and even no sound had begun a few days ago. The officers and soldiers secretly called it the "Shadowless Cannon."

Sha Jianbi's unit marched all the way and also suffered quite a few "Shadowless Cannons," losing forty or fifty officers and soldiers along the way, causing panic up and down. If not knowing Li Guang's two thousand men and horses were coming to reinforce from behind, these three thousand people would probably have dispersed in a hubbub before reaching Shishan.

After walking blindly in such panic for most of the day, the vanguard reported: Shishan lay four or five *li* away.

"Where is the enemy army deployed?"

"Right under Shishan." The vanguard Chiliarch reported.

He stood up straight on the stirrups. There was a stockade on Shishan, flying the Hair Bandits' red flag. This was part of the original government army grain depot. The originally lush Shishan had become bare; both Ming army and Fubo Army had carried out work to clear the field of fire. A gray battle line lay horizontally at the foot of the hill, blocking the post road.

This battle line was very thin. Sha Jianbi saw the Hair Bandits lining up at the foot of the hill were no more than a thousand people, yet they set up a battle line of two hundred paces. This was simply crazy! With such thin depth, wouldn't it be broken by one charge? Were the Hair Bandits confident in their firearms to such a degree? One must know they defended strictly behind earthen dikes in Chengmai!

But the disastrous defeat the previous day had long made the government army jittery. Sha Jianbi dared not get too close either, deeply fearing being hit by the "Shadowless Cannon." Immediately he ordered people to set up formation on the spot, preparing for battle.

Sha Jianbi gathered his subordinate Assistant Generals and Chiliarchs.

"Everyone saw it. The Hair Bandits are no more than a thousand; the formation is also thin. In haste, they lined up relying only on the trench and low wall. If we concentrate the whole army to attack fiercely, we can squeeze and break their formation!" Sha Jianbi pretended to be fully confident, "I looked; that 'One-Character Long Snake Array' has only two rows of people. No matter how powerful the firearms are, they can only fire a few volleys!"

"General Sha!" A Chiliarch said, "Listening to General Yan's defeated soldiers, one part of the Hair Bandits lines up and another lies in ambush. Waiting for my soldiers to attack fiercely, the ambush soldiers will attack my flank..."

"No hindrance." Sha Jianbi said, "I intend to use Wheel Tactics. Three thousand men and horses divided into three teams."

Three teams of men and horses attacking alternately. The Central Army waits to deal with sudden situations. One team goes up to fight, one team fires arrows behind the formation to cover. When the front team is tired, the rear team takes over.

Sha Jianbi thought this would firstly prevent the Hair Bandits from resting—the enemy had few people after all and no rotation. Even if their firearms were pure and skilled, firing continuously would exhaust the soldiers. When the enemy's gunfire became sparse, two teams of men and horses would charge out together, routing the enemy formation in one fell swoop.

"...Once the enemy ambush soldiers come out, our army will meet them with one thousand Central Army soldiers. According to routed soldiers, Hair Bandit ambush soldiers are no more than a thousand. Moreover, when Hair Bandits fight, they all set up stockades beforehand to control me with firearms. White blade stabbing is not their forte. My soldiers fight with long spears and big sabers; what enemy troops use are merely short blades on bird guns. They surely cannot fight for long!" Identifying this, he said sternly, "General Mao!"

"Humble General is here!" An Assistant General responded immediately.

"You take one thousand men as vanguard to attack first," Sha Jianbi instructed confidentially, "Hair Bandit firearms fire extremely fast; the columns need not be neat, just charge fast. Let officers and soldiers carry more bows and arrows. Release a round first at the edge of the trench before charging the formation—Hair Bandits have no armor; those hit by arrows will die or be wounded."

This General Mao was not Sha Jianbi's own man. He originally belonged to the Training Guerrilla, temporarily assigned under Sha. He knew Sha Jianbi wanted him to lead men to take the brunt, leaving the big credit to his own Central Army. But he dared not disobey orders, so he had to lead troops to organize columns.

"General Zhao!"

"Humble General is here!"

"You take one thousand men to support one *li* behind General Mao. Also carry more bows and arrows. If General Mao's men and horses cannot support and retreat, you continue the attack!" He patted General Zhao's shoulder, "General Mao charges the Hair Bandits for a bout; you taking men and horses up again surely will achieve success!"

General Zhao forced a smile, saying: "Many thanks for General Sha's cultivation!" In his heart, he secretly cursed Sha Jianbi for wanting them to roll on a bed of nails in front while taking his own men and horses to pick up ready-made credit.

Sha Jianbi didn't entirely plan to send Generals Zhao and Mao into the tiger's mouth, but his own men and horses were few. Moreover, the ranks were intact and hadn't suffered defeat; morale was good. They had to be used at the critical moment—he still had no news about where the Hair Bandit ambush soldiers were. Being without a capable and reliable force in hand wouldn't do.

So the government army quickly set up a stockade on the road, dividing men and horses into three teams preparing for battle. Sha Jianbi's unit also took in more than two hundred survivors of Yan Zungao's unit along the way. He ordered a Squad Leader to command them temporarily, staying in the Central Army for use.

The position established by Xiong Maozhang at the foot of Shishan consisted of a chest-high breastwork. In front of the breastwork was a deep trench, and in front of the trench were many abatis piled up from temporarily collected materials, including many wheelbarrows captured at the grain depot. The 1st Infantry Battalion deployed formation behind the low wall, directly intercepting any army attempting to pass the post road at the foot of Shishan.

The 1st Infantry Battalion deployed a standard double-rank line—Minié rifles fired much faster than flintlocks, so there was naturally no need to adopt a three-rank line. Xiong Maozhang deployed the battalion's 6 line infantry companies into a 150-meter line. The Battalion Grenadier Company served as reserve behind the whole battalion, covering the flank when necessary. The 1st Light Infantry Company and the 4th Battalion's Light Infantry Company were pulled out separately to form a garrison, defending the camp on Shishan together with logistics troops, while covering one wing of the 1st Infantry Battalion.

Of the 4 12-pounder mountain howitzers brought along, 2 were directly reinforcing the 1st Infantry Battalion, and the other 2 were arranged in the camp on top of Shishan, ready to provide fire support depending on the situation.

Xiong Maozhang held binoculars observing the government army men and horses a few *li* away. According to the Special Reconnaissance Team's report, this batch of enemies had a total of three thousand men. Behind them, separated by about ten *li* or so, followed two thousand men. However, Chen Sigen made it clear: "Those two thousand people behind are obviously here to 'buy soy sauce' (slack off)." Walking and stopping, their fighting will was not strong.

"Must break these three thousand people as soon as possible," Xiong Maozhang said to Zhu Mingxia, "Otherwise when the follow-up two thousand dawdle over, and the enemy have more people, they will be hard to chew."

Zhu Mingxia didn't speak. He looked at the government soldiers lining up in the binoculars: "Looks like the enemy's main attack direction is still your position. But have to guard against them attacking the stockade on the mountain."

Xiong Maozhang put his helmet on his head: "I have to go to the position, otherwise I won't be at ease."

While they were talking, the government army's signal cannon sounded once. One thousand men and horses attacked under the leadership of an Assistant General. When they rushed out more than one *li*, another signal cannon sounded, and another team of government soldiers sortied to kill towards the 1st Battalion's position.

"The enemy wants to use Wheel Tactics." Zhu Mingxia said. He continued to watch the government army's dynamics. The first team of men and horses had very fierce momentum, quickly rushing to a place less than a hundred meters from the position. Soldiers shot arrows while running; because the distance was too far, they posed no threat at all. Xiong Maozhang's 6 line infantry companies opened fire simultaneously at a distance of 150 meters. Bullets swept the wildly running columns. Government soldiers turned upside down. Before approaching the trench, their formation was in chaos. Then the second rank infantry fired a volley. In the thick smoke, Zhu Mingxia realized some enemies were already retreating.

Zhu Mingxia vaguely felt something was wrong. The enemy shouldn't just simply repeat the frontal assault tactic like this. For prudence, he didn't ask the 2 mountain howitzers in Shishan Fort to open fire, preparing to provide fire support at the critical moment.

There were many officers and soldiers in Sha Jianbi's vanguard battalion whose courage had already been broken yesterday. Now having to crash face-to-face into Hair Bandit firearms, the officers and soldiers appeared very cowering. After taking a few volleys, they were even less willing to move forward. Officers and generals shouted desperately to urge them, threatened with beheading, and encouraged with silver, finally making the men and horses continue attacking upward with great difficulty.

At this time, the second team of government soldiers surged up again.

"Shoot arrows! Shoot arrows!"

Government soldiers hurriedly shot a row of feathered arrows, but most people fired randomly before entering range. Almost not a single arrow fell into the formation; most fell on the trench and abatis.

"Steady! Sights 120 meters!" Officers constantly corrected the firing distance, "Fire!"

Volleys roared, smoke filled the air. Government soldiers could never even approach the trench. Every time they barely entered within a hundred meters, they were routed by volleys. Although soldiers were constantly urged by officers to rush up, they soon retreated in defeat again. Sometimes under the leadership of a few brave officers, they could assault to the front of the trench, but at this time the double canister shots from those 12-pounder mountain howitzers would mercilessly kill them all by the trench edge.

Smoke filled the air. Killing shouts, groans, and shouts shrouded the entire Shishan. The battle lasted for more than an hour. No matter how Sha Jianbi and his subordinate Assistant Generals encouraged and urged soldiers to charge, the government soldiers' assault became weaker and weaker. Especially after the mountain howitzers began to bombard government soldier columns 800 meters away with grenades, government soldiers had to retreat the columns to two *li* away each time to regroup and line up. Soldiers consumed large amounts of physical strength on this back-and-forth journey. Many officers and soldiers had been marching on the road since noon—most of the day without food or water. Attacking several times at this moment, they were already exhausted. Some soldiers simply fell by the roadside refusing to move.

Seeing his so-called Wheel Tactics had absolutely no effect—attacking for nearly an hour, rotating teams several times, achieving no progress except leaving a ground of corpses in front of the Hair Bandit trench in vain, while enemy volleys still hit steadily and fiercely without any sign of thinning—Sha Jianbi was greatly anxious. Dragging on like this, before enemy ambush soldiers came out, his own whole army would collapse.

He turned to order an all-out attack on the stockade on Shishan. There were only two light infantry companies and some logistics soldiers in the stockade, but there were 2 howitzers supporting. Grenades, canister shots, and solid shots beat down the government soldiers attempting to climb the mountain to seize the stockade overwhelmingly.

Although a government army young general was very brave, under his lead, a dozen fierce soldiers followed him to rush once to a place a dozen meters outside the stockade wall. Just as he waved the flag and got up to pounce on the stockade wall, a canister shot fired by a 12-pounder mountain howitzer hit him.

Government soldiers attacking the mountain stockade also constantly suffered harassing fire from bird guns of Hair Bandit infantry lined up below the mountain. Government soldiers attacked upward desperately several times. As corpses left on the slope became more and more, the attacking momentum also became weaker and weaker. The team attacking the mountain stockade retreated again—but this time they didn't even reach halfway up the mountain, shouted a few times perfunctorily, and retreated rolling and crawling as soon as bird guns fired in the mountain stockade.

Sha Jianbi's own men and horses hadn't moved out all along. Seeing his subordinate men and horses had lost their sharpness—let alone routing Hair Bandits to retake Shishan, they couldn't even deal with a team of Hair Bandit men and horses in front of them, suffering many casualties in vain—wouldn't he be blamed by superiors? He glared, ordering loudly: "Tell General Zhao and General Mao to attack desperately! Must open the post road, otherwise come see me with their heads!"

"Reporting to General, General Mao has been killed in action." A young general coming to report to him said panting.

Hearing an Assistant General had been killed, Sha Jianbi was even more terrified. He gasped a rough breath, seeing the young general in front of him—although helmet askew and armor slanted, he looked very burly and sturdy. A round face with a pointed chin, sparse whiskers, upturned nostrils, small eyes. Looked quite capable too.

"What is your name?"

"Humble General Cao Xiangjiao! Originally an Assistant General under General Mao..."

"Good, General Cao! This General now appoints you as Vanguard Battalion Garrison Commander, leading General Mao's unit," His horse whip pointed at the 1st Infantry Battalion's battle line under Shishan, "You lead the team immediately to detour from the paddy field to attack one wing of their battle formation! As long as you break the enemy formation, I will recommend you before the Regional Commander!"

"Thank General for the cultivation! Humble General will surely strive forward courageously!" Cao Xiangjiao was originally a newborn calf not afraid of tigers. At this moment stimulated by his few words and having hope of promotion, he instantly became high-spirited. immediately mounting his horse, lifting a big saber to charge the formation.

After issuing this series of orders, he also knew relying on this hothead Cao Xiangjiao to charge the formation didn't have much certainty; he had to lead officers and soldiers personally to attack fiercely.

So he shouted: "Beat drums! Line up!"

Although Hair Bandit ambush soldiers hadn't appeared yet up to now, he couldn't care about much else. He thought, as long as the battle formation was charged open, even if Hair Bandit ambush soldiers came out, he would have time to turn around to meet the battle. Sha Jianbi believed that as long as not attacking the Hair Bandit stockade, Hair Bandits were absolutely not matches for government soldiers in hand-to-hand combat.

Amidst deafening war drum sounds, Sha Jianbi mounted his horse. Personal soldiers hurriedly brought his big saber. He held the saber; his own Central Army and personal soldiers/house guards had lined up with bright helmets and shining armor, waiting to set off.

Sha Jianbi stood on the stirrups looking into the distance trying to see as far as possible. He saw Cao Xiangjiao's men and horses had already detoured into the paddy field, moving towards one wing of the Hair Bandit formation. Only the paddy field was muddy, movement speed was very slow. From time to time people fell to guns and cannons, but Cao Xiangjiao waved his big saber, urging officers and soldiers to walk fast. Meanwhile, General Zhao's unit was still attacking feebly.

He waited nervously for the success of Cao Xiangjiao's detour. About the time it takes to eat a meal, he saw Cao Xiangjiao's flag appearing on the flank of the Hair Bandit formation. Sounds of guns and cannons rumbled, smoke filled the air; he knew Cao Xiangjiao's attack had begun. He waved the big saber, shouting: "Kill! Break the Hair Bandit grand formation, five taels of silver reward per person!" His subordinate officers and soldiers let out a howl. Following him to charge and kill fiercely from the front.

Cao Xiangjiao's detour indeed brought a threat to the 1st Infantry Battalion. Xiong Maozhang immediately ordered the Battalion Grenadier Company acting as reserve to rotate to the flank to line up immediately. Two volleys repelled the government soldiers' first charge. Subsequently, Zhu Mingxia ordered the 2 mountain howitzers on the mountain to open fire.

"Use shrapnel shells!" Solid shots couldn't bounce in paddy fields, and killing power was limited. Canister shot range was insufficient. Air-bursting shrapnel shells became the best long-range killing weapon. Round after round of shrapnel shells drove Cao Xiangjiao's men and horses back again very quickly. Muddy paddy fields made it difficult for soldiers to move quickly; they fell under the Grenadiers' precision shooting one after another.

Sha Jianbi's Central Army threw off General Zhao's already chaotic unit, the whole army pouncing towards the center of the battle line in one breath. Preparing to break through the battle line in one fell swoop while Cao Xiangjiao attracted Hair Bandit firepower interference on the flank.
