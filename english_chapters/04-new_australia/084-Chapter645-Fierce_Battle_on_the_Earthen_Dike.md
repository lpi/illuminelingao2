# Chapter 645 Fierce Battle on the Earthen Dike

The battle situation was indeed as the Staff Department had estimated. He Ming thought. Although the Ming army had lost one bout, the opponent's flags were not disordered, and there were no signs of wavering among the men and horses. Judging from the drum sounds and the movement of army flags, the enemy was intensifying troop deployments. In this bout, the enemy would definitely mobilize elite main forces to attack with full strength.

"The enemy is mobilizing new troops." The observation post continuously sent new intelligence. "The enemy is transporting things out of the city!"

He Rubin deployed troops and generals, actively preparing for the second attack. To resist the Hair Bandits' firearms advantage, large batches of wheelbarrows from the Firearms Camp and Baggage Camp were concentrated. Piled on top were many sacks filled with sand and soil and straw bags, all soaked with water. Some carts were also loaded with large numbers of thick, heavy wooden doors dismantled from the county seat; even the few thick iron-sheeted gates of the county yamen were taken down. Liu Jingxuan, following the Central Army's order, personally led runners everywhere to dismantle wooden boards and collect wheelbarrows and sacks, to avoid "delaying military opportunities." Carpenters and blacksmiths in the army hurriedly carried out modifications.

No matter how thick the door planks were, even if covered with iron sheets, they couldn't withstand cannonballs. He Rubin understood this basic logic perfectly; what he was guarding against were the enemy's bird guns.

Judging from the several engagements starting yesterday, besides the Hair Bandits' sharp cannons, their bird guns were also very "sharp." Just the power to take human lives from three hundred paces away was enough to make soldiers lose courage. No matter how many cannons the Hair Bandits had, there were only twenty or thirty. Compared to the bird guns, of which everyone arguably had one, the threat was actually not considered too great.

Sandbags and door planks were used to screen soldiers and block lead bullets during the charge. Once at the bottom of the trench, they could be used to cross the trench. With the help of the telescope, He Rubin saw clearly: the Hair Bandits' earthen dike was very wide but not high, at most two *zhang* high. Apart from a low wall piled up with sandbags, there were no defensive works on top. As for those towers built with wooden poles, they were too flimsy to mount huge cannons, at most holding a few bird gun shooters, constituting no great threat.

While He Ming watched the Ming army's movements, he ordered high-calorie dry rations and water distributed to the soldiers—the afternoon battle would likely be very fierce and last a long time.

"Eat quickly, prepare to fight!"

The second attack unfolded in the afternoon. Launching the attack were the Ming army's elites in this punitive expedition. In the center were one thousand five hundred Standard Camp combat soldiers of the Governor's Standard, commanded by Guerrilla Wang Daoji, known as a fierce general. On his left wing were one thousand Governor's Standard combat soldiers under Governor's Standard Guerrilla Li Guang, and on the right wing were one thousand two hundred combat soldiers under Training Guerrilla Wang Xi.

As soon as the cannon sounded, only wheels rolled rolling. Hundreds of wheelbarrows, either piled with earth sacks or erected with wooden boards, opened the way in front. Behind them were government infantry following in long columns.

The government army generals had already witnessed the Fubo Army's artillery advantage. This time they no longer adopted a dense formation surging up together, but dispersed men and horses into relatively sparse columns, pulling open the distance between columns to avoid the Hair Bandits cutting a bloody alley with one cannon shot.

Wave after wave of men and horses surged forward amidst drum sounds. Dust rolled. Generals rode horses shouting loudly in the ranks, driving the troops forward. Behind them great flags fluttered, clustered by varying numbers of personal soldiers and house guards, each with sword drawn and arrow nocked, ready at any time to protect their main general and fight the enemy or fleeing soldiers.

The cannons on the earthen dike opened fire again. The thick smoke and firelight when cannons fired made all Ming army generals and officials tremble once. They already knew that along with that thick smoke and firelight, something terrible would happen to the soldiers and officers running forward on the open ground. Everyone watched the battlefield with bated breath.

The black shadows of cannonballs emitted terrible whistling sounds, landing in the columns one after another. Nothing could stop these black, bouncing iron balls. Once landing in the ranks, a burst of screams and wails would sound. Smoke dispersed, leaving only piles of corpses and severed limbs and minced meat on the ground. When the cannonball was about to hit the ground, its speed was already slow enough that it seemed one could catch it by reaching out. A reckless Squad Leader raised his iron spear upward, waving it fiercely like batting away an arrow, foolishly wanting to knock the cannonball to the ground. The cannonball broke the spear tip; a huge force transmitted through the spear shaft to his arm, tearing half his body apart alive. Someone turned to flee, only to be instantly cut down by the supervising officers behind.

"Charge forward! Charge forward!" Generals were issuing orders. They weren't safe themselves either; besides cannonballs that killed regardless of rank upon contact, occasionally someone would suddenly fall from their horse. Some rode horses circling, waving swords and roaring pretentiously, but didn't walk forward anymore themselves.

As the troops approached closer and closer to the earthen dike, artillery fire became denser and denser. As the Ming army rushed to a distance of five hundred meters, the artillery began firing shrapnel shells and explosive shells. Shells exploded in the air or upon landing; fragments and iron balls knocked down soldiers in rows and groups.

"Charge fast! Charge fast!" Officers waved swords, "Charge under the earthen dike!"

Soldiers let out a thunderous roar, surging forward rapidly like dying beasts. A black mass of formation charged fiercely towards the front of the earthen dike. Fubo Army gunners had all stripped to the waist, firing shells rapidly with all their strength. Cannon sounds rose and fell; the entire earthen dike was completely shrouded in thick white smoke. Only the watchtowers protruding above floated on the smoke like pavilions in the clouds. Below the cloud layer was the surging crowd tumbling like stormy waves approaching. The snipers on the watchtowers had already lost the leisurely air of slowly loading, personally finding targets, carefully aiming and shooting, shaking or nodding heads, and then drawing a mark on the wooden board beside them. Everyone rapidly worked the bolt, aimed, fired, and then hurriedly found the second target.

"Target 300 meters, canister shot!" Zhang Berlin finally shouted the command to load canister shot. The battle finally entered the level of close-quarters combat. More than a dozen cannons quickly loaded canister shot to fire.

"Fire!"

27 canister balls sprayed out with every jump and recoil of the muzzle, forming a dense curtain of bullets. Many soldiers were killed before even approaching the trench.

"Infantry fire!" He Ming watched as the government troops disregarded artillery fire and approached the trench. Some soldiers were already throwing earth sacks, wheelbarrows, and corpses of fallen soldiers into it, trying to fill out a path. Although they were quickly killed in swathes by canister shot, follow-up men and horses were surging in continuously.

"Sights 150 meters, Fire!"

The smoke from artillery fire was too thick; no one could see the targets clearly. Infantry set the sights and fired volley after volley directly without aiming. Crisp gunshots rang continuously. Many people fell to gunshots before approaching the trench. Some retreated, but He Rubin had already sent an additional two thousand men and horses rushing up closely behind. The rolling crowd filled the battlefield again. The front ranks were pushed by the rear ranks pouncing forward fiercely.

"Charge! Five taels of silver reward for killing across the trench! Ten taels for ascending the stockade wall!" Several officers led personal soldiers galloping along the already chaotic government army columns, roaring to encourage morale.

"Everyone charge for Daddy! Two taels of silver reward for cutting off one Hair Bandit head! Fifty taels for cutting off a Hair Bandit Chief! Those who shrink back and flee from battle will be beheaded!"

Wang Daoji led the charge in front. Half of the house guards and personal soldiers beside him were already dead or wounded. The standard-bearer had also been changed twice, but he was still the first to lead the troops to the edge of the trench. Some archers were already nocking arrows and drawing bows by the trench, releasing dense arrows. The first wave of casualties appeared on the earthen dike. Three-eyed gunners also followed to fire three-eyed guns.

Tian Liang stood on the right side of his company. His ears were almost deafened by the sound of guns and cannons. He saw the Company Commander—disregarding life or death—simply jumped onto the low wall, waving the command saber in his hand and roaring. His voice almost drowned out the sound of the whole company's volley fire. At this time, five or six feathered arrows shot out from the smoke; one of them hit the Company Commander. He groaned and fell from the earthen dike, instantly having his head cut off by government soldiers.

The soldiers were stunned, actually forgetting to fire for a moment. Tian Liang was so shocked his command saber almost fell to the ground—the Company Commander, who consistently ranked among the best in military training assessments and dared to fight and charge, died just like that!

"Quick, Second Lieutenant Tian, it's your turn!" The Company Quartermaster saw Tian Liang still dazed and hurriedly pushed and shoved him under the company flag.

Tian Liang almost forgot the command to shout for a moment. Finding a Company Commander killed in his battalion, You Laohu, who ran over to supervise the battle, kicked him hard:

"Why are you dazing! Fire!"

Tian Liang finally reacted. His command saber slashed down violently.

"Volley! Fire!"

A gust of sea breeze blew over, dispersing the thick gunpowder smoke. A red fire snake flew along the earthen dike. Soldiers firing arrows and filling the trench by the trench edge fell into the trench one after another under the crossfire from the left and right flanks, but the second batch of people surged over again.

Fu Sansi held an SKS rifle, paying attention to the condition of the whole battalion while firing a few bullets occasionally. He specifically targeted projectile troops like officers and archers by the trench. His marksmanship was very accurate, and he was unaffected by the outside world when shooting, basically one shot, one kill.

Seeing several sections of the trench already filled with corpses and sandbags, more and more Ming troops surged under the stockade wall. Although they avoided frontal fire, rifle fire from the oblique side still knocked them down in batches.

However, with large numbers of archers and firearms troops rushing to the trench to provide covering fire, casualties on the earthen dike also increased. Fu Sansi felt the time had come. He picked up a grenade from hand, pulling the ring and throwing in one breath.

"Throw grenades!" He ordered loudly at the same time the grenade left his hand.

"Throw grenades! Throw grenades!" Repeated orders were passed along the earthen dike. Soldiers shooting arrows and filling the trench only saw many small iron lumps falling from the earthen dike.

Grenades exploded one after another. Although the killing effect of black powder grenades was average, the power and momentum of throwing many grenades together were still astonishing. Then the second and third rows of grenades were thrown down continuously. At this distance, canister shot could no longer play a role and could only fire into the depth. Grenades became the best weapon. Crowded by the trench, government soldiers under the earthen dike had almost no place to hide under the grenade rain, falling dead one after another.

Before the previous batch of people fell, the next batch had already surged over under the driving of generals. Soldiers fell dead in batches in the open space between bastions. Every volley on the earthen dike harvested a batch of lives quickly like a sickle. Smoke shrouded the earthen dike; people in the distance could only see the firelight when rifles and cannons fired.

Casualties on the earthen dike were increasing. Many infantrymen were hit by arrows and iron pellets fired by three-eyed guns. Medics constantly dragged away fallen casualties. The infantry line on the earthen dike began to thin, and firepower became sparse accordingly.

Taking advantage of the thinning firepower, the first batch of government soldiers had already pulled out or chopped down the bamboo spikes planted obliquely on the earth slope. Although people constantly rolled down after being shot, people behind still surged up batch after batch. They had climbed up using ladders or simply using hands and feet. They were immediately resolved by infantry bayonets, but more and more people climbed up. Some three-eyed gunners also climbed up; after firing, they used this heavy iron weapon as an iron club. Many charging government soldiers threw burning fire pots onto the earthen dike while climbing. Although these ceramic fire pots couldn't explode, the flames and smoke after landing caused certain chaos among defenders. Infantry began to be forced back step by step, formation in great chaos. A Squad Leader jumped fiercely onto the earthen dike. His long saber chopped a soldier's rifle in two with one slash and stabbed him down. Subsequently, he chopped down another pouncing infantryman. Two militia pouncing up with spears actually retreated repeatedly under his wild slashing momentum. Seeing more and more government soldiers coming up behind him, the Squad Leader's courage grew even stronger. He rushed forward a few steps, forced back the routed militia, reached out and planted an army flag onto the earthen dike. Ming troops above and below the wall were greatly boosted in morale, emitting a burst of fierce howling simultaneously, charging here disregarding death. Seeing that a breach was about to be opened on the earthen dike. Lin Shenhe, who was originally shooting one by one with a civilian version semi-auto M14 to his heart's content, gave a loud shout and rushed over with the bayoneted M14 in hand. Seeing both sides about to engage in close combat, he flashed aside and shouted: "Fire!"

A "Typewriter" mounted on a wheelbarrow behind him immediately emitted a huge roar. Dense and scorching lead bullets swept away all government soldiers climbing onto the earthen dike. One person's head was shattered on the spot; one was torn into pieces by lead bullets. Those lucky enough not to be hit also fled rolling and crawling down the earthen dike.

Breaches appeared everywhere, but militia and reserves of each battalion constantly sealed the breaches, beating down government soldiers who broke through the defense to occupy the earthen dike. The battle entered a white-hot stage: on one side was a crowd engaging in desperate hand-to-hand combat; on the other side, artillery fire and volleys were still spewing firelight and thick smoke incessantly.

The place where Tian Liang was located was exactly a breach where Wang Daoji's house guards and personal soldiers concentrated their full strength to pounce. The company he temporarily commanded had already suffered one-third casualties. Government soldiers took the opportunity to climb onto the earthen dike to unfold hand-to-hand combat. His command saber was lost somewhere during the fierce battle. After emptying the revolver, he had no time to reload before a government soldier charged at him. In desperation, he smashed the revolver fiercely onto the opponent's face, picked up a three-eyed gun conveniently, swung it round, and smashed the enemy's brains out with a blow to the head.

He had no time to find another weapon; government soldiers had already surged in front of him. At the life-and-death juncture, his military regulations were completely forgotten. Relying only on a desire for survival, he waved this heavy iron fellow striking left and right, smashing fiercely; no one could stand against him. At this time, a feathered arrow shot through his thigh. Tian Liang gave a miserable scream and fell into the pile of corpses on the earthen dike. Seeing a scabbard hanging at his waist, a government soldier knew he was an officer, jumped over waving a waist saber to cut off his head, but was immediately stabbed to death by bayonets of infantry swarming up to save their Acting Company Commander. Both sides engaged in back-and-forth slaughter at the place where Tian Liang fell.

Staff personnel on the command platform began to lose their cool, watching more and more enemies board the earthen dike to start hand-to-hand combat—some fighting unfolded right next to the cannons.

"Commit the reserves." Zhu Quanxing ran over personally to request battle.

"Wait a while longer; they can still hold." He Ming picked up binoculars to carefully observe every breach on the earthen dike. True, government soldiers boarded the earthen dike in many places, but every gap had Fubo Army soldiers and militia engaging. He deeply believed strictly trained soldiers could repel these few government soldiers.

You Laohu fully exerted his role known as "One Track Mind" in the battle. He rushed into breaches one by one with a happy roar, slashing chaotically with the Frontier Army Long Saber without any technique. While chopping down large numbers of government soldiers, he almost cut off his own head. But his craziness drove the morale of a large batch of militia and infantry. They surged up following him to slash and rush fiercely, sealing one breach after another. Facts proved that the government soldiers' resoluteness in one-on-one hand-to-hand combat was far inferior to the well-trained infantry of the Fubo Army. Examples of three or five infantrymen beating back a group of government soldiers with bayonets occurred frequently.

At 2 PM, although Wang Daoji organized men and horses to storm again and again regardless of casualties, soldiers were hit by cannon fire by the trench, suffering many deaths and injuries. The defense on the earthen dike also gradually formed resilience. Militia filled the vacancy of casualtied infantry, using long spears to poke down government soldiers who barely climbed onto the earthen dike. The "Typewriters" played a crucial role in the specific battle of sealing breaches. This terrible rapid-firing monster thoroughly destroyed any determination attempting to occupy breaches on the earthen dike. Lead bullets pouring like raindrops swept away incoming government soldiers. Artillery fire cut off follow-up men and horses from time to time. Government soldiers who boarded the earthen dike couldn't get timely reinforcement and were driven down one by one unable to open breaches.

Wang Daoji was still shouting to ascend the stockade when a Minié rifle bullet hit him. He swayed and fell from his horse. The soldiers could finally persist no longer, letting out a whistle and fleeing backward.
