# Chapter 569 - Malaria Strikes

The blasting accident's zero fatalities was luck, but luck couldn't last forever. In the feverish atmosphere of the Elders pushing to extract iron ore at all costs, safety incidents occurred regularly. Almost every day brought workplace accidents.

When the Mechanical Works rushed production, the result was products manufactured by native workers going directly to Sanya. Combine that with hastily trained native operators whose skills were unpolished and safety awareness weak, and the high accident rate was unsurprising. Within the first week, two boilers exploded, killing eleven. Then an automatic brick-making machine threw parts during operation, killing one and injuring several.

Injuries and deaths from careless machine operation happened every few days. On average, the site was killing 0.778 people per day. This was still near the beaches—once they moved inland, wouldn't the death toll climb higher?

Wang Luobin had no interest in Zhuo Tianmin's proposal to "reduce workload and strengthen safety education."

"What we need now is iron ore. More iron ore," Wang Luobin said. "Deaths are up, yes, but will education really help?"

"Our mission is to extract iron ore as quickly as possible. Everything must center on that goal."

Zhuo Tianmin still hesitated. Wang Luobin added: "Have them reinforce education during meals and before sleep. Assign some people as construction safety officers."

"And the quality of the machines—this is treating lives carelessly!" Zhuo Tianmin was indignant.

"We can submit a report on this issue to the Manufacturing Supervisor," Wang Luobin said noncommittally.

Zhuo Tianmin wanted to press further, but realized even if he pushed, there would be no results. Wang Luobin would never agree to any measures that slowed construction. After all, Project Giant was being called a "matter of national destiny" in the newspapers. If he went against the current, he'd only smash his own head.

"Then let's write a report," Zhuo Tianmin said. "I'll write it."

"We can co-sign this report," Wang Luobin said. "As for morale issues, we can take other measures to comfort everyone."

So the next day, He Fanghui received an assignment: find a cemetery site.

"The terrain should be high and dry. Surroundings should be scenic," Wang Luobin instructed. "See if there's anyone among the natives who's been a fengshui master. Take him along."

"For burying laborers?"

"Of course. Burying the dead wherever they fall is bad for morale. The dead don't really care, but the living can't handle it."

After considerable effort, He Fanghui found a suitable gentle slope. The cemetery would follow Cuigang's model—no mounds, just flat stone tablets flush with the ground. Grass lawns, trees and flowers all around, made to look like a park.

He Fanghui brought in labor teams for clearing and construction. After more than ten days, it took some shape. After a brief memorial service, the first batch of deceased laborers' ashes were buried there. Those drowned or killed in explosions had symbolic graves with articles of clothing.

Yet the posthumous honors couldn't stop mounting casualties. The Yulin-Tiandu railway construction accounted for the vast majority of workplace injuries. The route passed through subtropical jungle and valleys with complex geological conditions. Casualties from falling rocks, toppling trees, and landslides were numerous.

The leeches caused enormous trouble. The transmigrator collective could only take protective measures—laborers were issued multi-layer anti-leech socks. Trouser legs, sleeves, and necks were all covered. Everyone received a tube of salt.

Shan Daoqian employed crude physical methods, using bulldozers, blasting, and burning to destroy leech habitats. He ordered all vegetation within fifty meters of the route stripped, supplemented by terrain modification including raising the roadbed and digging drainage ditches.

Drainage was the primary concern—elimination not just leeches but also mosquito breeding grounds. Every day, laborers went to work bundled up, laboring in nearly 30-degree temperatures. They rotated rest every hour. Smoke from burning qinghao wormwood drifted everywhere to repel mosquitoes.

The roadbed extended meter by meter. A locomotive powered by coal gas pulled flatbed trains along the just-laid track, bringing replacement laborers, food, medicine, and materials to the front lines.

But the most severe test was yet to come. Finally, cases of "shaking fits" appeared. Hippo, assigned for health work, visited the ward: six patients, some pale and shivering, others flushed and sweating. Classic malaria symptoms.

"This is malaria," Hippo concluded. "Isolate them first. Put mosquito screens on the windows."

"Yes, Doctor." Serving as head nurse was Guo Fu. She was now core nursing personnel. The Health Department was considering training her as the first native doctor.

"Tomorrow you'll hold a meeting with health workers," Hippo continued. "Have them inspect each camp's mosquito prevention. Those with mosquito nets should hang them properly. Barracks without nets must install window screens. Qinghao must be burned 24 hours a day."

"Second—distributing antimalarial drugs to health workers you must do personally, ensuring every one takes medication on time. Including yourself."

"Third—though the Army and Navy have their own health workers, you should still inspect and supervise them. Especially the Army—they often venture inland."

"Assign two nurses specifically to care for malaria patients. Regular medication goes without saying. Watch for keeping them warm, cooling them down, and hydration. Give patients Grade 1 sick rations."

"Our difficulties are just beginning." Hippo pulled a cigarette. Guo Fu lit it. "It's been about 40 days since D-Day. The malaria incubation period is passing. Soon we'll face an outbreak peak."

"With you here, Doctor, any difficulty can be overcome." Guo Fu wore an expression of complete trust.

"I'm not a deity." Hippo smiled bitterly. Antimalarial drug reserves were finite—would they be enough?

"Doctors aren't deities, but divine healers." Guo Fu smiled sweetly. That smile made Hippo's heart flutter.

The news of malaria cases drew the command's attention—this had been everyone's primary concern. An emergency meeting was held inside Yulin Stockade to discuss countermeasures. If large numbers of laborers fell ill, that alone would delay the development schedule.
