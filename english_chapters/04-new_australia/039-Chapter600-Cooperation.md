# Chapter 600 - Cooperation

Yet this matter could serve as a warning bell—alerting other Executives, particularly Wu De, President of the Planning Agency. Once the "Yi Fan-Chen Ce" system was adopted, the impact on the Planning Agency, as direct successor to the Planning Committee, would be immediately apparent to him.

Ma Qianzhu rang the doorbell at the end of the alleyway. A small window immediately appeared in the iron-clad door, revealing a pair of watchful eyes.

"Pass."

He handed it over.

A few minutes later, the door swung open. The guard stood at attention and saluted: "Hello, Chief."

"Good, good." He mumbled a few words, took back the pass, and asked casually: "Is Xiao Zishan in?"

"Yes, sir."

Ma Qianzhu glanced at the blue-brick building in the courtyard. Xiao Zishan's office occupied the top of the second floor. If he looked down from the window, he would see Ma Qianzhu—and according to his consistent practice, would certainly come down to exchange pleasantries. Anticipating this, Ma Qianzhu quickened his pace to escape that line of sight.

The General Office Lounge was located in the General Office's rear courtyard. Xiao Zishan had commissioned Li Xiaolü for a landscape design, resulting in an open-pavilion-style pseudo-antique structure, with transplanted flowers and trees on all four sides. Jasmine was blooming vigorously now—snow-white blossoms covered the branches, their fragrance almost overwhelming.

This was a place resembling a teahouse. The interior was bright and spacious, furnished with rattan chairs, very much like the teahouses Ma Qianzhu had visited in Suzhou and Hangzhou. There were no waiters, however. Tea leaves, boiling water, and beverages came pre-packaged and arranged neatly on a low cabinet. One could bring one's own cup or use those provided. A sink ran along the wall, with spare brushes and small packets of bleaching powder. A notice was pasted on the wall: "Please wash tea sets yourself after use!"

Ma Qianzhu brewed tea for himself. After waiting leisurely for several minutes, Si Kaide arrived in haste.

"Hello, State Secretary." He greeted him. In truth, he and Ma Qianzhu were not especially familiar—they had only met a handful of times at Executive Committee Enlarged Meetings.

"Just call me Ma Qianzhu, Comrade Si Kaide."

"Very well." Si Kaide nodded. He was approximately thirty, 175 centimeters tall, with a rather standard build and an unremarkable face. According to the General Bureau of Political Security's political assessment, this man was a chauvinist, harboring hostility toward Britain and America. His ideal was establishing a colonial empire and entering the Third Industrial Revolution within his lifetime. Regarding this last point, Ma Qianzhu felt they might possess some common ground.

Ma Qianzhu outlined the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's station deployment plan.

"...Jiang Shan's concept is that for the current mainland layout, we should essentially adopt a system that combines intelligence and commercial functions. This maximizes the efficiency of people, money, and materials while avoiding redundant construction."

"You mean something like the Guangzhou Station model."

"Roughly speaking. But such stations may not achieve the scale of Guangzhou Station."

"Investment and operations under the Colonial and Trade Ministry's responsibility, while supporting intelligence personnel activities—is that the idea?"

"Precisely." Ma Qianzhu nodded. "But I want to correct one point. Strictly speaking, all investments are provided by the Planning Agency and the General Fiscal Directorate." He detected a hint of bargaining intent and moved quickly to foreclose that possibility.

"Yes," Si Kaide nodded. "What I mean is, if our ministry is responsible for commercial activities, then commercial considerations will inevitably factor into station site selection—rather than purely intelligence considerations. Some locations the Intelligence Bureau deems of critical importance, warranting permanent stations, may not generate sufficient profit from a commercial standpoint, or may even fail to cover the station's own operating costs."

"If such locations exist, the Intelligence Bureau will assume sole responsibility for them." Ma Qianzhu was direct.

"In that case, I agree to cooperate. But I hope the Intelligence Bureau provides a list of proposed deployment sites so the Ministry can conduct a comprehensive assessment."

"No problem." Ma Qianzhu said. "I'll instruct Jiang Shan to contact you. You must keep this location list strictly confidential."

"Naturally," Si Kaide said. "I'm drafting a report on expanding overseas stations. Since the Intelligence Bureau is also considering this matter, we could draft the report jointly with them."

"You can discuss the details with Jiang Shan." Ma Qianzhu said nonchalantly. "How do you plan to approach your deployment?"

Si Kaide grinned. "Regarding large-scale deployment, the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Light Industry are equally anxious. They all want to expand the mainland market."

Ma Qianzhu understood. Silver reserves had been steadily declining. The Transmigration Group's primary revenue source—Leizhou sugar's crushing season—hadn't yet begun. Meanwhile, industrialization expenditures continued without pause. As the departments chiefly responsible for earning "foreign exchange," the anxiety of the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Light Industry was understandable.

"We've discussed and decided to prioritize deployment in Jiangnan—Nanjing, Yangzhou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. These four locations offer the greatest commercial value. Our high-quality industrial products will find markets there. It would also be ideal to establish one or two points in Fujian."

Fujian was a major production region for export porcelain. Kraak porcelain was manufactured primarily in that area. The province also boasted abundant tea resources. Both were crucial export commodities. For the Transmigration Group's own needs, kaolin and tea were highly desired resources.

Second priority: Beijing and Zhangjiakou.

"Zhangjiakou? Extracting money from Shanxi old wealth won't be easy."

"Zhangjiakou is a major trading hub for Mongolian goods. Furs and horses—doesn't the Executive Committee want those?"

Of course they did. Furs could be re-exported—Europeans possessed enormous appetite for furs. As for horses, the Transmigration Group suffered chronic shortages. Never mind that the Agricultural Committee people disdained Mongolian horses for their low shoulder height and small stature—this breed tolerated rough feed. Acquiring a few hundred for draft work would be quite valuable, certainly more maneuverable than plodding oxen. Besides, the army also had urgent demand for horses. Zhang Berlin had complained countless times: using substitute livestock for troop transport and artillery hauling was a barbaric and backward military system.

"How would we transport Mongolian goods? From Zhangjiakou to any coastal port inside the passes—that's no short distance."

"That's where the intelligence department needs to get creative. First, we must cultivate relationships with frontier army generals, obtaining their assistance with transit procedures—otherwise horses simply cannot get on the road. Second, we need to secure a port in the northern coastal region for loading goods traded from the north directly onto ships."

"Are these all the deployment sites under consideration?"

"Yes. Commercial deployment in the Jiangnan region can be denser—Zhenjiang and Shanghai could also receive stations. But we'll limit it to these for now. Too many sites, and investment runs short."

"Very good." Ma Qianzhu jotted key points in his notebook.

Si Kaide couldn't tell whether this "very good" was praise for his work or simply meant "that's all." He coughed:

"Besides the mainland, I propose establishing a point in Macau."

"Macau already has a fellow named..."

"Huang Shunlong." Si Kaide reminded him. "This man serves as our agent in Macau. But he's not very proactive in business. His operation amounts to sitting there receiving stolen goods and reselling contraband. His value to us is diminishing—he can no longer satisfy Lingao's appetite. We need a sales window capable of dealing directly with the Portuguese."

"Isn't there a Li Huamei acting as agent?"

"This person—" Si Kaide said, "is highly suspect. You're likely aware she's probably unreliable."

"If that's the case, establishing a point there is worth considering."

"Finally: establishing a point in Vietnam." He said. "Begin with Tonkin. This is our source for rice and coal. A trade station there is essential." Where there was a trade station, intelligence work would naturally follow.

"Establishing a station in Tonkin is a major undertaking. It would probably require coordination across all ministries. The Northern Court may not permit it. We must be prepared for military confrontation."

"What about probing first?" Si Kaide had been planning this for some time. Chang Shide from Leizhou Station had recently returned to Lingao specifically to discuss it with him. Leizhou Station and Guangzhou Station were preparing to establish a Vietnam Trade Company—besides mining coal in Hong Gai, they would also conduct trade activities.

Setting up a commercial station or goods firm in Tonkin wasn't difficult. As long as there was money to be made, the Northern Vietnamese court still welcomed merchants. Many Great Ming merchants already maintained warehouses and firms locally. The difficulty lay in mining coal at Hong Gai. That was far trickier. It was hard to imagine the Northern Vietnamese court simply ignoring a group of strange overseas people digging for coal.

Si Kaide's calculation was straightforward: if Ma Qianzhu didn't object, he would start small-scale operations in Hong Gai. Manpower and materials were already available.

"This matter still requires Executive Committee deliberation. It involves foreign relations issues." Ma Qianzhu said. "Tonkin isn't a collection of Southeast Asian native chieftains. They field hundreds of thousands of troops. Antagonizing them now—I'm afraid we couldn't handle the consequences easily."

A few days later, the proposal for the Intelligence Bureau and Colonial and Trade Ministry to jointly deploy mainland stations passed the Executive Committee and subsequently cleared three readings in the Senate Standing Committee. As for deployment in Tonkin, the Executive Committee and Senate "approved in principle," agreeing to dispatch a small-scale team for preliminary reconnaissance—with the proviso: "minimize military conflict."

Si Kaide felt profoundly stifled. Colonization was supposed to be bloody. How could it be called "colonial development" without the accompaniment of cannons and muskets?

"We have to be timid even toward Vietnamese," he grumbled in his office. Then he picked up the telephone: "Connect me to the Organization Department... Yes, Organization Department? This is the Colonial and Trade Ministry Office. I'd like to request transfers of several personnel files... No, transfer procedures aren't needed yet... Correct, the first one is named Bei Kai..."

Li Yan stared at the mycelium under the microscope. This was the Agricultural Committee's biological laboratory, where seven or eight people crammed together. A cohort of PhDs and Masters who had once studied molecular biology, stem cells, and other twenty-first-century frontier sciences were now researching practical fungal strains under Huang Dashan's leadership. This was one of two options for biology students. The alternative was the Ministry of Health's biological laboratory, which dealt specifically with viruses and vaccines.

He recorded his observations on the clipboard. This work was tedious and dry, but fortunately he was accustomed to it. Following plans step-by-step had become integral to his life.

Li Yan handed the microscope to someone else and walked out of the increasingly cramped laboratory. Emerging from the stuffy, overheated space into the outdoors, he found the air remarkably fresh. He inhaled deeply. Compared to other locations, the air at the farm remained pleasant.

He had already received his transfer order. Tomorrow he would report to the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. His perpetual work in retrieval and translation at the library had grown insufficiently challenging. He was accustomed to dry work, but that didn't mean he was content with simple work. Intelligence work suited his temperament perfectly.

Li Yan had no intention of becoming some 007, nor M. What he aspired to be was an office planner. Ideally, a trainer—specifically teaching various schemes and traps, and his beloved IEDs. Whether such devices would actually find use remained doubtful.

A few days later, the first dispatch personnel training class commenced. It was designated "first session" because these students differed from previous cohorts—all were Elders who had volunteered to dedicate themselves to intelligence or trade work. Every one had submitted applications requesting frontline mainland assignments.

The batch numbered about a dozen, varying in height, weight, and build, but sharing one characteristic—all were male. It wasn't that no women had applied; quite a few ladies were willing to undertake this high-risk work. But after analysis, the intelligence department concluded that women's scope for activity in Great Ming-controlled areas was limited—unless she was willing to blend into lower-class society or go all-in as a social butterfly like Miss PIPE.

Fortunately, almost all women in the Transmigration Group had boyfriends or husbands, sparing Jiang Shan from confronting excellent female agents aspiring to infiltrate Chongzhen's court, or preparing to burrow into Huang Taiji's or Dorgon's side through harem intrigues. This had always been his concern. The remaining handful of persistent volunteers also retreated after Yu E-shui enumerated the various living inconveniences they would face conducting intelligence activities on the mainland.

"Never mind the girls—I suspect these men might not endure the hardship when the time comes." Yu E-shui crossed his legs. "Everyone imagines it's as comfortable as Guangzhou and Leizhou, surrounded by maids, concubines, and servants. Where is such a cushy deal to be found?"

"I must protest that characterization. Our early days developing Leizhou were extremely bitter!" Chen Tianxiong objected to lumping Guangzhou and Leizhou together. Developing Guangzhou had seemed far easier than Leizhou to him. Guangzhou had Gao Ju—High Official Gao—a wealthy and powerful local powerhouse to manage affairs and keep things under control. Leizhou had been carved out by their group through sheer struggle, constantly on edge and wary. The two situations were utterly incomparable. Not to mention that the so-called "enjoyment" at Leizhou Station amounted merely to everyone acquiring a few women ahead of schedule—nothing approaching the lifestyle of the Guangzhou contingent.

"Fine. Let's see whether anyone needs to be eliminated." Jiang Shan said to Li Yan. The latter had just been promoted to Deputy Director of the Great Ming Division, with concurrent appointment as Head of Intelligence Training. The "Head" title was the Intelligence Bureau's own creation; the Organization Department recognized only the Deputy Director position.

"Eliminating people now means future recruitment becomes more difficult." Yu E-shui observed. "Currently everyone believes dispatch is like Guangzhou. Wait until they're deployed and cry about being deceived—after they return and spread the word, enthusiasm for going will evaporate."

"Very well. Let's conduct brief interviews. Those truly unsuitable cannot be accepted." Li Yan insisted on interviews.

"As you wish."

"Xu Ke—" The person before them wore a Navy uniform. "You're Navy. Active Lieutenant. Why have you come to us?"

"Conducting naval military intelligence is my long-cherished ambition..."

"Then you'll need to retire first, then reapply. We fall under the Central State Council system—we don't accept active-duty military personnel."

Requiring this person to retire and apply afresh was clearly asking a great deal. Xu Ke blinked. "Make an exception. Don't you need military intelligence personnel who understand the navy? The Foreign Intelligence Bureau collects military intelligence too, doesn't it?"

"Correct, but your position is with the Navy! If you come to us, your salary can't be issued, and the Navy will count you as a deserter—"

"This problem—" Xu Ke scratched his head. Salary was a minor issue. Becoming a deserter was a serious one.

"If you genuinely want to come, you must apply for retirement from the Navy, transfer your file back to the Organization Department, then submit an application."

"I really do want to be an intelligence officer! A naval military intelligence officer." Xu Ke remained devoted to his aspiration. "Perhaps you could help communicate with them? There's always a solution."

So the telephone switchboard and transfer stations buzzed with activity for a while. Ming Qiu didn't know how to handle this either. Reasonably speaking, the Navy should possess its own intelligence analysis room. After urgent consultations, it was decided that Xu Ke would work at the Foreign Intelligence Bureau with the status of naval military intelligence personnel—counted as Navy-dispatched staff. Salary paid by Navy; allowance paid by Foreign Intelligence Bureau. He would be specifically responsible for naval military intelligence collection and analysis within the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

"Is this appropriate—letting the Navy stick its foot in now?" Wang Ding asked Jiang Shan quietly. "Looking at the Navy's and Army's intentions, establishing independent military intelligence bureaus later is virtually certain—probably one for each service. Aren't our hard efforts just making wedding dresses for others?"

"Making wedding dresses is making wedding dresses. This is cooperation. Don't be too calculating." Jiang Shan assumed an expression of magnanimity. "One of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's tasks is providing intelligence preparation for the army's future mainland conquest operations. There's nothing inappropriate about the Navy sending someone to handle naval intelligence. Besides, our future activities depend heavily on Navy support. With such a person here, won't coordination be easier? Director Wang, everything should focus on the big picture."

"Very well. As you say."

"Next—"

"Cheng Nifeng. You want to be dispatched personnel?"

"Let me be a human trafficker—I have insights on this..."

---

After brief interviews, all candidates were accepted. Li Yan had them sign forms, take photographs, and complete paperwork. Once procedures were finished, Wang Ding appeared before them with a grave expression:

"Comrades gathered here have all prepared to accept dispatch to the mainland for intelligence and trade activities. Some comrades will remain at headquarters to work, but will inevitably travel for business as well."
