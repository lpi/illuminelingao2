# Chapter 600 - Cooperation

However, this matter could serve as a warning bell to remind other Executives, especially Wu De, President of the Planning Agency. Once the "Yi Fan-Chen Ce" system was adopted, the impact on the Planning Agency, as the direct successor of the Planning Committee, was naturally foreseeable by him.

Ma Qianzhu rang the doorbell at the end of the alleyway. A window immediately appeared on the iron-clad door, revealing a pair of alert eyes.

"Pass."

He handed over the pass.

A few minutes later, the door opened. The guard stood at attention and saluted: "Hello, Chief."

"Good, good." He mumbled a few words, took back the pass, and asked casually: "Is Xiao Zishan in?"

"In."

Ma Qianzhu looked at the blue brick small building in the courtyard. Xiao Zishan's office was at the top of the second floor. If he looked down from the window, he could see him—according to his consistent practice, he would definitely come to socialize with him. Thinking of this, he walked a few steps faster to quickly leave this line of sight.

The General Office Lounge was in the back courtyard of the General Office. Xiao Zishan let Li Xiaolü do a landscape design, building an open-pavilion style fake ancient building, transplanting quite a few flowers and trees on four sides—jasmine was blooming vigorously right now, snow-white small flowers filling the branches, fragrance assaulting people.

This was a place similar tea house. The room was bright and spacious, with rattan chairs inside, very much like the tea houses Ma Qianzhu had visited in Suzhou and Hangzhou. With gentle breezes, it was a good place for resting and talking. However, there were no waiters here. Tea leaves, boiling water, and drinks were all ready-made, neatly packaged and placed on the low cabinet. Bringing one's own cup was fine; using cups here was also fine. There was a sink along the wall, also spare brushes and small packets of bleaching powder. A paper was pasted on the wall: "Please wash tea sets yourself after use!"

Ma Qianzhu brewed tea for himself. After waiting leisurely for a few minutes, Si Kaide arrived hurriedly.

"Hello, State Secretary." He greeted. Actually, he and Ma Qianzhu were not very familiar, only met a few times at Executive Committee Enlarged Meetings.

"Just call me Ma Qianzhu, Comrade Si Kaide."

"Good." Si Kaide nodded. This person was about thirty, 175cm tall, body shape quite standard, with a common face. According to the General Bureau of Political Security's political appraisal, this person was a chauvinist, hating Britain and America, ideal was establishing a colonial empire, entering the Third Industrial Revolution in his lifetime. Regarding this last point, Ma Qianzhu thought he and himself still had common language.

Ma Qianzhu introduced the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's stationing plan to him.

"...Jiang Shan's idea is that for the current layout on the mainland, basically we still have to adopt a system of shouldering both intelligence and commerce. This can maximize the use efficiency of people, money, and materials, avoiding duplicate construction."

"You mean, similar to the Guangzhou Station model."

"Roughly so. But such stations may not reach a scale like Guangzhou Station."

"Investment and operation responsible by the Colonial and Trade Ministry, while responsible for support work of intelligence personnel, is that the meaning?"

"Of course." Ma Qianzhu nodded, "But I want to correct one point. Strictly speaking, investments are all provided by the Planning Agency and the General Fiscal Directorate." He smelled a scent of wanting to bargain, quickly knocking out this possibility.

"Yes," Si Kaide nodded, "My meaning is, if our department is to be responsible for business activities, then there will be commercial considerations in the selection of these stations. Instead of purely considerations for obtaining intelligence. Some locations the Intelligence Bureau thinks have important significance and are necessary to establish permanent stations, but from commercial consideration, these locations may not obtain sufficient profit, or even earn profit to maintain the station's own operation."

"If there are such locations, the Intelligence Bureau will be solely responsible." Ma Qianzhu was very crisp.

"In that case, I agree to cooperate. But I hope the Intelligence Bureau provides a list of points they wish to plant, so the Ministry can conduct a comprehensive assessment."

"No problem." Ma Qianzhu said, "I will tell Jiang Shan to find you—you must keep this location list confidential."

"Of course," Si Kaide said, "I am drafting a report on increasing overseas stations. Since the Intelligence Bureau also has considerations in this aspect, we can jointly draft this report with the Intelligence Bureau."

"This matter you can discuss slowly with Jiang Shan." Ma Qianzhu said nonchalantly, "How do you plan to arrange your planting?"

Si Kaide grinned: "Regarding large-scale planting, the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Light Industry are also anxious. They all want to expand the mainland market."

Ma Qianzhu knew, this was because recently silver reserves were constantly declining. The Transmigration Group's biggest financial source: Leizhou sugar's crushing season hadn't started yet. Yet industrialization consumption didn't stop for a minute. As departments mainly earning "foreign exchange": the anxiety of the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Light Industry was imaginable.

"We discussed and decided, first planting in Jiangnan—Nanjing, Yangzhou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. These four places have the most commercial value. Our high-quality industrial products will have a market. Best establish one or two points in Fujian too."

Fujian was an important production area for export porcelain. Kraak porcelain was mostly produced in this area. Also local rich tea resources. Both were important export sources. Regarding the Transmigration Group's own needs, kaolin and tea were very needed resources.

Secondly, Beijing and Zhangjiakou.

"Zhangjiakou? Digging money out of Shanxi old wealth's hands is very not easy."

"Zhangjiakou is a heavy trading town for Mongolian goods. Furs and horses, doesn't the Executive Committee want them?"

Of course want them. Furs could be used for re-export—Europeans had extremely high enthusiasm for furs. As for horses, the Transmigration Group lacked this most. Don't look at the disdain of the Agricultural Committee bunch for Mongolian horses, disliking low shoulder height, small physique, but this kind of horse tolerated coarse feed. Getting a few hundred for animal power was also quite good, at least easier to use than slow oxen. Besides, the army also had extremely strong demand for horses—Zhang Berlin had complained countless times: using substituting livestock to transport soldiers and pulling cannons was a barbarous and backward military system.

"How to transport Mongolian goods? From Zhangjiakou to any seaport inside the Pass, this distance isn't close."

"This requires the intelligence department to think of ways. First is to settle the frontier army generals, let them handle procedures, otherwise horses simply can't get on the road. Secondly is to get a seaport in the northern coastal area, loading goods traded from the north onto ships nearby."

"Are these all the planting points considered?"

"Yes, commercial planting in the Jiangnan region can be denser, for example, Zhenjiang and Shanghai can also be planted. But just these for now. Too many points and investment won't be enough."

"Very good." Ma Qianzhu noted down key points in his notebook.

Si Kaide didn't know if this "very good" was praising his work well done, or indicating "that's all." He coughed:

"Besides the mainland, I propose setting up a point in Macau too."

"Macau has a guy called..."

"Huang Shunlong." Si Kaide reminded him, "This person is our agent in Macau. But this person is not very active in doing business. His business is nothing more than sitting there receiving stolen goods and reselling contraband. Now his value to us is getting smaller and smaller—he can't satisfy Lingao's appetite. We need a sales window able to face Portuguese directly."

"Isn't there a Li Huamei acting as agent."

"This person," Si Kaide said, "Very suspicious. You should know she is probably unreliable."

"If so, can consider establishing one."

"Finally is setting up a point in Vietnam." He said, "Start setting up in Tonkin (North Vietnam). Here is our source of rice and coal. Establishing a trade station is very necessary." Having a trade station naturally meant having intelligence work.

"Setting up a point in Tonkin is a major event. Probably requires coordination of all ministries. The Northern Court (Trinh Lords) may not permit it. We have to be prepared for military struggle."

"How about probing first?" Si Kaide had been planning this for a long time. Last time Chang Shide from Leizhou specially returned to Lingao to discuss this with him: Leizhou Station and Guangzhou Station prepared to establish a Vietnam Trade Company, besides mining coal in Hong Gai, also conducting trade activities.

Setting up a commercial station or goods firm in Tonkin wasn't hard. As long as there was money to earn, the North Vietnamese small court still welcomed everyone to do business—many Great Ming merchants already had warehouses and firms locally. What was difficult was coal mining in Hong Gai. This matter was trickier. Hard to imagine the North Vietnamese small court would ignore a group of strange overseas people mining coal.

Si Kaide's abacus was if Ma Qianzhu didn't oppose, he would first engage in Hong Gai on a small scale. Anyway, manpower and material resources were available on hand.

"This matter still needs to be submitted to the Executive Committee for discussion. Involves foreign relation issues." Ma Qianzhu said, "Tonkin isn't Southeast Asian native chiefs. Also has hundreds of thousands of troops. Stiffening relations now, I'm afraid we won't handle it easily."

A few days later, the proposal regarding the Intelligence Bureau and Colonial and Trade Ministry jointly planting stations on the mainland obtained passage in the Executive Committee, then passed three readings in the Senate Standing Committee. As for planting in Tonkin, the Executive Committee and Senate "passed in principle," agreeing to dispatch a small-scale team for probing layout—premise was "try not to cause military conflict."

Si Kaide felt very stifled—colonization ought to be bloody. How could it be called "colonial development" without the accompaniment of cannons and muskets?

"We have to be timid even towards Vietnamese." He grumbled in his office, then picked up the phone, "Connect Organization Department... Yes, Organization Department? I'm Colony and Trade Ministry Office. I want to transfer a few people's files... No, transfer procedures temporarily not done... Right, the first one is named Bei Kai..."

Li Yan stared at the mycelium under the microscope—this was the Agricultural Committee's biological laboratory. Seven or eight people squeezed inside. A group of PhDs and Masters studying molecular biology, stem cells and such 21st-century frontier sciences were researching various practical fungus strains under Huang Dashan's leadership. This was one of two choices for biology students. The other choice was the Ministry of Health's biological laboratory, dealing specifically with viruses and vaccines.

He wrote down his observation results on the clipboard—this kind of work was boring and dry, but fortunately he was used to it. Following plans step-by-step had become part of his life.

Li Yan handed the microscope to someone else and walked out of this already crowded laboratory. Walking out from the turbid hot laboratory to the outside, he only felt the air incomparably fresh. He took a deep breath—compared to other places, the air at the farm was still nice.

He had already received the transfer order. Tomorrow he would go to work at the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. Always doing retrieval and treatment translation work in the library was really too unchallenging. He was used to dry work, but didn't mean he was used to simple work. Intelligence work fitted his appetite exactly.

Li Yan didn't intend to be some 007, nor M. What he wanted to be was a planner in the office. Best be a trainer. Specifically teaching various schemes and traps, and his beloved IEDs—although whether this thing had possibility of use was doubtful.

A few days later, the first dispatch personnel training class opened. The reason for calling it the first session was because the students of this class were different—all were Elders aspiring to dedicate themselves to intelligence or trade work. They all voluntarily submitted applications demanding to go work on the front line on the mainland.

There were a dozen people in this batch, tall short fat thin differing, except one point—they were all male. Not that no women submitted applications; quite a few ladies were willing to throw themselves into this high-risk job. But after analysis, the intelligence department believed the scope of activities for women in Great Ming controlled areas wasn't large, unless she could willingly mix in the lower class society, or go all out to be a social butterfly like Miss PIPE.

Fortunately, almost all women in the Transmigration Group had boyfriends or husbands, allowing Jiang Shan to avoid facing excellent female agents attempting to infiltrate Chongzhen's side or Huang Taiji/Dorgon's side preparing to lurk into enemy beds through harem struggles. This was what he had always been worried about. The remaining few persistent activists also retreated after Yu E-shui pointed out various living inconveniences they would face doing intelligence activities on the mainland.

"Don't talk about girls, I see these men might not be able to endure this hardship when the time comes." Yu E-shui crossed his legs, "Everyone thinks it's as leisurely as Guangzhou and Leizhou, surrounded by maids, concubines, and servants—where is such a cheap deal."

"I have to protest this. Our days in the early stage of developing Leizhou were still very bitter!" Chen Tianxiong opposed the mention of pulling Guangzhou and Leizhou together. Developing Guangzhou seemed much easier than Leizhou to him. Guangzhou had Gao Ju, High Official Gao, this wealthy and powerful local snake helping suppress the scene and handle affairs. Leizhou was developed by their group cutting through thorns, frightened and wary. Where was the comparability between the two? Not to mention anything else, the so-called "enjoyment" of Leizhou Station was just everyone getting a few women in advance, completely incomparable to the living standard of the Guangzhou group.

"Alright, let's see if we need to eliminate anyone." Jiang Shan said to Li Yan—the latter had just been promoted to Deputy Director of the Great Ming Division, concurrently Head of Intelligence Training. This head title was created by the Intelligence Bureau itself; the Organization Department only recognized the position of Deputy Director of Great Ming Division.

"Eliminating now means difficult to recruit again in the future." Yu E-shui said, "Now everyone thinks dispatch is like Guangzhou. Wait until dispatched out to cry cheated, coming back to say it, everyone won't be interested in going."

"Fine, let's interview slightly. Really unsuitable ones can't be taken." Li Yan insisted on interviewing.

"Okay, up to you."

...

"Xu Ke—" The person in front wore a Navy uniform, "You are Navy, active Lieutenant, how come you came to us?"

"Doing Naval military intelligence is my long-cherished wish..."

"Then you have to retire first, then come. We here are under the Central State Council system, not accepting active servicemen."

Asking this person to retire and come again was obviously a bit demanding. Xu Ke blinked his eyes: "Make an exception. Do you guys not need military intelligence personnel understanding navy? The Foreign Intelligence Bureau collects military intelligence too, right."

"Correct, but your establishment is in the Navy! Coming to us, salary can't be issued, and the Navy will count you as a deserter—"

"This problem—" Xu Ke scratched his head. Salary or not wasn't a big problem; becoming a deserter was a serious problem.

"Really want to come, have to apply for retirement to the Navy, transfer file back to Organization Department, then submit application."

"I still really want to be an intelligence officer! Naval military intelligence officer." Xu Ke still insisted on his aspiration very much, "How about you help me communicate? There's always a way."

So the telephone switchboard and transfer station were busy for a while. Ming Qiu didn't know how to handle this either. Reasonably speaking the Navy should have places like its own intelligence analysis room. After detailed urgent consultation, it was decided Xu Ke would work in the Foreign Intelligence Bureau with the status of Naval military intelligence personnel, counted as Navy dispatched staff—salary paid by Navy, allowance paid by Foreign Intelligence Bureau. Specifically responsible for naval military intelligence collection and analysis in the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

"This, is it appropriate letting the Navy stick a foot in now?" Wang Ding asked Jiang Shan in a low voice, "Looking at the meaning of Navy and Army, establishing independent military intelligence bureaus later is a certain thing, mostly likely one for each. Aren't our hard tossings making wedding dresses for others?"

"Making wedding dresses is just making wedding dresses. This is cooperation. Don't be too calculating." Jiang Shan had a face of grandeur, "One of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's tasks is providing intelligence preparation for the army's future mainland conquest actions. Nothing inappropriate about the Navy sending someone to be responsible for naval intelligence. Besides, our future activities rely a lot on Navy support. With such a person here, isn't coordination easier? Director Wang, everything should focus on the big picture."

"Fine, listen to you."

"Next—"

"Cheng Nifeng. You want to be dispatched personnel?"

"Let me be a human trafficker—I have insights on this..."

...

After simple interviews, these people were all accepted. Li Yan let them sign, take photos, and fill forms. After procedures were done, Wang Ding appeared in front of them with a serious face:

"Comrades here are all prepared to accept dispatch to the mainland to engage in intelligence and trade activities. Some comrades will stay in the General Bureau to work, but inevitably will travel for business too.
