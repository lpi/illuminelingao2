# Chapter 702 - Subversion

"Hmph, that kid knows what's good for him." From a nearby ship, a sailor who had been secretly observing the sentry's every move muttered to himself. If the sentry had taken the silver, he would have had to draft a report that very night, and the unlucky fellow would spend several months in the punishment camp. But why had this pirate tried to bribe the sentry?

According to regulations, as a member of the Ten-Man Group, he had no right to directly request a meeting with the overt Political Security Special Envoy in the fleet—unless there was an extremely important matter. So he could only write down what had just happened on a slip of paper and drop it into a designated box during his next shore leave. Only the Political Security Special Envoy had the key to this box.

By evening, Shi Zhiqi, who was also serving as Special Envoy, had received two reports on the matter: one from the sentry and one from the Ten-Man Group member.

Someone wanted to get aboard *Lint Special 51*. What on this ship could attract a pirate?

Shi Zhiqi quickly reached a conclusion: the other party was looking for someone!

The possibility of gathering intelligence was low. *Lint Special 51* had nothing special about it—neither in propulsion nor armament. Moreover, getting aboard was extremely difficult since it wasn't a jetty-moored vessel; getting on and off required ferrying by small boat. If one wanted to board for reconnaissance, wouldn't the ships at the docks be more convenient?

The only possibility was that the pirate wanted to find someone on this ship.

Who could it be? Shi Zhiqi thought for a moment and had someone bring him the Political Security Bureau roster of all personnel aboard *Lint Special 51*. He flipped through it. This Political Security Bureau roster was classified; unauthorized persons were not permitted to access it. It contained not only reliability assessments for each person but also brief personal histories.

Of the fifty-odd people aboard, twenty-three had backgrounds listed as "professional pirate" or "non-professional pirate." Shi Zhiqi understood: there must be old acquaintances of this person in the enemy gang aboard this ship. They wanted to establish contact.

Next, he needed to assess the "threat level." Establishing contact could serve many purposes. The most harmless, of course, would be purely friendly. However, one couldn't rule out the possibility of enemy subversion and recruitment.

Shi Zhiqi immediately discussed this new development with Chen Haiyang: "Should we launch an investigation?"

"Of course, according to procedure, an investigation should be launched," Chen Haiyang replied. "However, since we're going to eliminate this pirate gang very soon, whether or not we investigate doesn't seem to matter much."

Le Lin said: "Perhaps we might uncover some traitors. Even if we don't, we could use this to turn the tables."

"Very well, how do you plan to turn the tables?" Wen Desi asked.

"Well, at the very least we'd need to know whom the other side wants to meet and what they intend to do..."

"That's why I call it unnecessary trouble," Wen Desi said. "This kind of scheming is typical weak-minded thinking. What are the cannons and typewriters on your ships for? But we needn't make things so complicated. If that Zheng Bao fellow won't accept reorganization and won't leave Lantau Island, we'll eliminate him first."

"Zheng Bao has sixty or seventy large ships! And many smaller ones. He has more men than we do, too."

"To be precise, there are exactly 71 ships that can be considered large," Chen Haiyang said, signaling a staff officer to pull back the curtain on the chart board behind him.

On a complete map of Lantau Island, the exact position of every pirate ship anchored at Tung Chung had already been clearly marked. Additionally, the positions of other long-term moored vessels were also indicated.

"The sampans and long-dragons—small river craft like those—are mostly moored at the eastern and western stream mouths. These ships aren't the main force. We'll ignore them for now."

According to the map, most of the pirate vessels were concentrated at Tung Chung, with a few anchored at Tai O Island—a very small island separated from Lantau by an extremely narrow channel.

The Special Reconnaissance Team had landed secretly on Lantau Island on the very first night after landing day, and the following day climbed to the island's highest peak—Phoenix Mountain at 935 meters elevation. They subsequently traversed the entire island of Lantau, using modern observation and surveying equipment to accurately collect many crucial pieces of intelligence.

The reconnaissance map produced by the Special Recon Team over several days not only precisely marked the position of each vessel but also sketched rough layouts of the several residential areas around Tung Chung.

Tung Chung, called Tung Chung Hau in the Ming dynasty, is located on the central northern coast of Lantau. It faces the sea on one side and is surrounded by mountains on three. By the Ming dynasty, it was already the main population settlement on the island. Two rivers empty into the sea here, called "East Stream Mouth" and "West Stream Mouth" respectively. Most of Lantau Island is mountainous; only where rivers meet the sea are there small alluvial plains. This is therefore also the most densely populated area, with numerous villages of varying sizes scattered about.

"It's said that Tung Chung was once a hiding place for the last two emperors of the Southern Song," Chen Haiyang noted. "Since we claim to be descendants of the Song, this place has great symbolic significance."

Shi Zhiqi said: "That can only be called legend."

"The final court of the Southern Song wandered around the Pearl River Estuary for quite some time. If they temporarily landed to rest on Lantau, it wouldn't be surprising," Wen Desi said. "Many places in the Pearl River Estuary region have similar legends. There should be some historical basis."

Shi Zhiqi asked: "The enemy has many ships and men, and the terrain gives them the advantage—easy to defend, hard to attack. Can our frontal assault succeed?"

---

Chen Haiyang said: "Although Tung Chung is strategically situated and favorable for defense, the pirates have no systematic land-and-sea defensive system. They have no defenses on shore whatsoever, having posted only a small number of lookouts on the headlands. They've arranged no defensive measures for the mountains behind them either. We can completely catch them off guard from behind."

Chen Haiyang's battle plan was a pincer attack by land and sea. Naval vessels would form a blockade line outside Tung Chung Mouth and attack the harbor. Marines and some sailors would land on the far side of Lantau Island, bringing 12-pounder mountain howitzers and rockets. They would climb Liujiao Mountain and Shangling Ridge west of Tung Chung and shell the pirate ships in the harbor from those commanding heights.

Once the pirate ships came under unexpected flanking attack, they would inevitably try to break out to sea—only to fall directly under the guns of the blockading fleet.

In chaotic fighting within narrow harbor confines, the side with more men and ships might have the advantage. But once in open water, a regular navy with superiority in navigation, command, and firepower could fully leverage its strengths. On this point, Chen Haiyang had no doubt. Even the converted special-service boats could deliver staggering destructive effects with a single salvo.

"We'll begin operations in three days," Chen Haiyang said. "Once the cargo is completely unloaded, all ships can be deployed."

To strengthen vigilance, Shi Zhiqi had, under the pretext of rotation, replaced two-thirds of the marine personnel aboard *Lint Special 51* the day before. Among them were specially assigned investigators—their task was to watch for and investigate any potential conspiracies.

Subsequently, at his repeated insistence, *Lint Special 51* was moved to the outermost patrol circle—purely to make it easier for agents to secretly board—Chen Haiyang thought this was simply asking for trouble, but couldn't resist Shi Zhiqi's determination to "make new contributions on the political security front." Besides, the request to conduct a thorough investigation was in accordance with organizational regulations.

Wang You's subordinate had been hovering nearby disguised as a fisherman. When he saw that *Lint Special 51* had moved to the outermost perimeter, Wang You decided to take a chance—otherwise, he would have no way to explain things to Zheng Bao.

When Wang You was escorted into the ship's cabin by marines, Shi Fourteen recognized the person before him immediately. So startled was he that he stood up at once.

"Steward... Wang!"

Wang You signaled with his expression, bowing deeply: "Wang You pays respects to Your Honor!"

"Please, please, have a seat, have a seat." Shi Fourteen hastily offered him a chair. "Brew some tea!"

"No need for trouble!" Wang You cupped his hands, looking around the cabin, indicating he wished to dismiss the others—he had a confidential matter to discuss.

But Shi Fourteen was in a difficult position. Times were different now. He had no "trusted confidants" around him; the people here were merely superiors and subordinates. While subordinates absolutely obeyed superiors, the relationship wasn't the "intimate" kind. In other words, he had no secrets to keep aboard this ship.

Having a private conversation with his former steward—and at this critical juncture when conflict with the pirates could erupt at any moment? This Steward Wang had chosen quite the time to administer his eye drops.

But if he didn't dismiss the others, this Steward Wang would absolutely refuse to reveal his purpose. Shi Fourteen was very conflicted. He couldn't just drive him away—not only would it severely damage his reputation, more importantly he'd have no way to explain things to the superiors. Shi Fourteen understood the Australians' mindset very well: they required clear conclusions on everything. Absolutely no vagueness was tolerated. Now that Wang You was aboard, there was no possibility of concealing this. If he didn't even know what the other party's purpose was, he wouldn't know where to begin his report.

Thinking this through, he dismissed everyone from the cabin, keeping only the orderly—to serve as a witness.

"This is my trusted man. You may speak freely in front of him."

Wang You said in a low voice: "Manager Shi, I trust you've been well?" He looked casually around the cabin. The tidiness and elegance surprised him, especially the exquisite furnishings—utterly incomparable to the chaotic, filthy cabins of pirate ships.

"I didn't expect you'd be doing so well with the crop-heads—the Australians!"

"It's acceptable, acceptable!" Shi Fourteen replied perfunctorily. "I'm serving in the Australasian Song Navy, considered an officer of sorts."

"Australasian Song? Ah," Wang You remembered that the Australians claimed to be descendants of the defeated remnants of the Song dynasty at Yashan, who fled overseas and established their kingdom in Australia. "Judging by your bearing, you must be a general-level figure by now."

"Not at all, not at all," Shi Fourteen quickly demurred. "I'm still several ranks below general. I'm a lieutenant in the Australasian Song Navy. Same as before, I manage several ships." He looked at Wang You with an inquiring gaze. "Steward Wang! After the battle at Nanri Island, we lost all news of you. I wonder where you're employed now?"
