# Chapter 565 - T-Hour

Hu Xun was sound asleep, cuddling his concubine, when someone suddenly came to wake him.

"What is it?" He was instantly alert—his subordinates wouldn't dare barge into his bedroom and wake him unless something urgent had happened.

"It's bad—in the bay there are—there are—so many—" The servant was panting and gesturing frantically. "So many ships!"

"Pirates?!" Hu Xun tensed, quickly getting up and throwing on his clothes. "Hurry, sound the gong! Everyone arm yourselves, prepare for battle!" He leapt from the bed and barked at his concubine, still stunned on the bed, without looking back: "Quick, get dressed!"

Outside, the gong began clanging, fast then slow. The stockade immediately erupted in chaos. Militiamen dropped whatever they were doing and ran toward the public hall. The men in charge had already received Master Hu's orders and were distributing swords, spears, and bows to the militiamen, along with a dozen or so single-bore and three-eyed matchlock muskets. Two small cannons were also wheeled out and hurriedly dragged toward the stockade gate.

Hu Xun rushed out of his house. In his left hand, he gripped a large saber; in his right, a short firearm—a foreign curiosity a ship captain had given him. The matchlock wasn't lit yet.

The ship captains and managers of vessels wintering at Anyoule Market were running around the street like headless flies, asking everyone they met what had happened. When they learned a large pirate fleet had arrived, many faces turned ashen. Some burst into tears—the ships and cargo at the pier below were surely lost.

Hu Xun had just reached the west gate when he saw about a hundred people crowded at the gate, clamoring to get out. The militiamen struggled to hold them back. Through the commotion, he could make out they were ship captains and sailors who wanted to escape on their ships. The militiamen were too few; the desperate crowd was gradually pushing them aside, and some began reaching for the crossbar on the gate. The officer guarding the west gate shouted frantically—if the gate opened and the pirates rushed in, what then?

Hu Xun charged into the crowd. With two swift strokes of his saber, he chopped off the heads of the two men reaching for the crossbar.

"Have you all gone mad?!" Hu Xun flicked the bloody blade. "There are dozens of ships out there waiting. You won't get a single ship out! You'd just be throwing your lives away!"

The crowd was stunned into silence by his blood-drenched saber; no one dared speak.

"Stay in the stockade and follow my orders!" Hu Xun snorted coldly. "You can forget about your ships and cargo, but at least you can keep your lives!"

Hu Xun ordered the militiamen to herd everyone back to the inns. Then he climbed the west gate watchtower. He saw fifty or sixty ships had already appeared in the bay—some were heading toward Lingao Stockade, others were still sailing deeper into the bay.

Hu Xun gasped. Among the fleet was a rarely seen five-masted great ship. But what shocked him even more came next: he saw several strangely shaped vessels moving through the bay without sails or oars. He stared for several minutes in disbelief—was that even possible?

But something even more terrifying soon followed. Three two-masted warships approached the shore near Anyoule Market in column formation, quickly reaching the vicinity of the town's pier. Their broadsides faced the stockade. He clearly saw square port lids opening along their sides, revealing dark cannon muzzles. Hu Xun shuddered—just on this one side, there were twelve ports. How many cannons did this ship carry?

"Master, shall we fire a shot?" a militiaman asked. The few iron and bronze cannons on the stockade wall could barely reach the beach at best—they would just be making noise, like firecrackers at a funeral.

"Fire my ass!" Hu Xun had no patience for pretending to be from the Shuinan Village Hu clan now. He raised his hand and slapped the man. "Fire, fire—you think this is your family's funeral procession shooting birds?"

The officer said: "Master! It seems they have no intention of attacking the stockade. At worst, they'll take all the ships and cargo below."

"We still have to guard against an assault." Hu Xun said. "Tell everyone to watch carefully and not fire randomly." He hurried down from the wall, ordering everyone in the stockade mobilized—able-bodied men to help defend the walls, women and elderly to prepare rolling logs and bricks. If necessary, they'd tear down houses.

But Hu Xun wasn't foolish enough to think his few hundred people could withstand an assault. His purpose in making such preparations was solely to tell this force—whoever they were—that Anyoule Market wasn't a soft persimmon but a hard walnut. Anyone who wanted to swallow it would have to work for it.

"Prepare fifty jars of wine, two whole roasted sheep, two hundred taels of silver, and one hundred bolts of cloth," Hu Xun instructed his manager. "Have them ready at the east gate."

"Master, that might not be enough," his ever-present secretary whispered.

"I know it's not enough," Hu Xun said impatiently. "First let's test the waters and see what they want."

The landing operation proceeded like a flawless performance, everything moving on schedule according to the timetable.

The first troop transport ship moored at the pier in front of Yulin Stockade. The cargo doors opened.

The neat and ready laborers climbed up onto the deck in order, team by team. Under the sailors' guidance, they descended the gangways to the pier.

Days of sailing had left many still unsteady on their feet. With too many people on the pier, any jostling caused falls. Some people fell directly off the pier into the sea. Nearby small boats rushed over to fish them out. Those too exhausted to struggle were dragged underwater by the weight of their packs before they could be rescued; by the time they were pulled out, they were already dead. Several drowned in the initial chaos. But most people successfully made it ashore. Many collapsed on the sandy beach the moment they set foot on land, gasping for breath. They were quickly roused by team leaders and squad leaders, herded in batches toward the distribution center established by the Planning Council. Those who couldn't get up no matter how much urging received were taken in by the collection teams.

Those who made it to the distribution center were led to steaming cauldrons. Several cooks ladled hot soup into their enamel cups from the pots—an aroma hard to describe.

Lin Gonglao took a sip. It tasted slightly bitter, slightly sweet, with a hint of herbal medicine. Not unpleasant. Probably some medicinal soup for curing seasickness. The soup was neither hot nor cold, just right for drinking. Lin Gonglao drained the entire cup.

Strangely, he quickly felt strength returning to his legs, which had gone soft from the long voyage. Energy seemed to surge endlessly from within his body, and his spirits lifted considerably. He looked around in surprise; those around him were similar. Those who had barely managed to walk to the distribution center despite severe seasickness showed remarkable improvement after drinking a bowl of the medicinal soup.

"How strange, what miracle drug is this?" Lin Gonglao muttered.

What simmered in the cauldrons was "Energy Supplement Type B," a formula developed by Liu San, Chen Sigen, and others after several rounds of modification and testing. Its remarkable effect was due to its main ingredient: coca.

Coca leaves were a soft drug widely used by the working class in Central and South America. Even before the Spanish conquest, Indians had used them to eliminate fatigue, thirst, and altitude sickness, forming what was called coca culture—one that continued into the twenty-first century.

The transmigrator collective had brought coca plants precisely because of their effects and relatively minor side effects. However, many transmigrators remained skeptical and demanded the strictest management protocols for their use.

But pragmatism ultimately prevailed. The Health Department had prepared large quantities of this supplement—using up nearly all their harvested coca leaf reserves—anticipating the extreme hardship of the Tiandu development. They needed something that could quickly restore laborers' spirits. Shipped alongside the "Energy Supplement" were large quantities of cigarettes. "Great Production" brand would be provided free, unlimited—anyone willing to smoke could receive up to three packs per person per day.

After drinking the medicine and resting briefly, someone came to call out their team numbers. Each ten-person team had a unique identifier sewn onto their work clothes and luggage. To the Planning Council, laborers weren't even nameless individuals—they were merely components making up work teams.

Lin Gonglao's team was assigned to assist the Construction Company's installation team in building the second pier.

Two engineering vessels equipped with derricks and pile drivers were towed over by motor launches. With mechanical assistance, a second pier was quickly constructed at the dock in front of Lingao Stockade using prefabricated components shipped in. Two motorized generator barges loaded with locomobiles dropped their eight anchors alongside the pier and began generating power.

According to plan, Yulin Stockade's original pier became Pier No. 1, serving as the personnel pier. The newly built Pier No. 2 would be dedicated to cargo handling.

Four steel derricks were rapidly installed—these rather extravagant devices used all-steel-tube construction with bolt connections. Light overall weight, high strength. They used electric hoists to lift cargo and could handle most heavy cargo unloading.

Bundles of rails were unloaded from the ships. Road engineering teams began laying track. Light rails would extend from Pier No. 2 all the way to the newly cleared cargo yard outside Yulin Stockade. Rails couldn't be laid on sandy beach, so Shan Daoqian used prefabricated frame-type roadbeds, filling gravel into the frames and bolting the rails on top. Using segmented construction with teams working from both ends toward the middle, the several-hundred-meter double-track line was completed in under two hours. Rail carts were unloaded from *Dajing* and put into cargo transport service.

Draped in rope netting and waterproof cloth, cargo pallets were unloaded one by one onto flatbed rail cars, then pushed by hand to the cargo yard. At this point, a strange contraption was lowered from *Dajing*. With people running back and forth shouting directions, it was carefully deposited on the rails. Mounted on a standard flatbed rail car was a machine taller than a man. This was a small locomotive manufactured by the Mechanical Works using mass-produced small steam engines. Due to time constraints, the engine and boiler were almost completely exposed on the rail car. This small engine's horsepower was pathetically low, but it was currently the only steam engine that could fit on a flatbed car.

Several technicians climbed aboard. They busied themselves filling the machine with water and lighting the fire. After about an hour of fiddling, white steam began shooting from the exhaust valve. The pressure gauge showed sufficient pressure.

Shan Daoqian checked his watch—three minutes ahead of schedule. A good omen. This remarkably ugly so-called locomotive was the railway's first engine, jointly developed by the Lingao Vehicle Factory and Mechanical Works. It had overcome numerous difficulties and passed testing in Lingao. It was named the "Meteor."

"Start!" He waved the small green flag in his hand.

Standing on the car, Liang Xin's face was blackened with soot. Behind him were stacked large baskets full of premium Hongji coal. Several native workers busied themselves around the steam engine.

Seeing the green flag raised, he immediately pushed the lever. The Meteor let out a whine, hissing steam as it began to move. The ten flatbed cars coupled behind it clanked with the sound of iron striking iron.

The Meteor crept forward a few meters, then suddenly stopped. This alarmed Shan Daoqian, who leapt aboard the locomotive in two or three bounds.

"What happened?"

"Don't know." Liang Xin was drenched in sweat, his work clothes soaked dark. He held a large wrench. "The pressure suddenly dropped, but I don't see any leaks..."

"Fix it fast!" Shan Daoqian was anxious. The landing plan was detailed down to the minute. A problem in one link would delay the next. Though the plan had backup contingencies, nobody wanted problems to occur on their watch.

"Okay, okay." Liang Xin, a technician from a nuclear industry enterprise, busied himself around the steam engine, tapping here, tightening there. After a while, pressure recovered. The Meteor, pulling its train of cars, slowly started moving again. For this bare-bones locomotive, its power was truly pitiful. The crude little train wheezed toward the cargo yard at a mere five kilometers per hour.

But still—it was mechanized transport! One train pulling this much would take laborers hundreds of handcart trips, not to mention the large items that had to be carried by hand.

Shan Daoqian checked his watch. Good—delay of less than two minutes. Project coordinator Sun Xiao wouldn't need to adjust the implementation schedule.

This landing construction used a project system, with each project managed by a project manager and coordinated by Planning Council officer Sun Xiao.

Following Wen Desi's standardization approach, Sun Xiao had developed a detailed implementation schedule: which labor team would land at what time, which equipment would be unloaded to which designated yard at what time—everything had specific plans. All projects had detailed start and completion timetables. By project completion at such-and-such date and hour, Sun Xiao's Planning Council clerks could quickly determine from their tables and cards which facilities would be available by what time, how many labor teams and equipment would be free and available for deployment—maximizing the utilization of personnel and machinery.

Using the schedule also clarified project priorities and correct sequencing, preventing less urgent projects from receiving preferential allocation of manpower and material supplies.
