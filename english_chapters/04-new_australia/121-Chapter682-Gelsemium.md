# Chapter 682 - Gelsemium

When the *Zhaopu Village Incident Report* reached the Yuan Laoyuan, it triggered a wave of inquiries directed at the Civil Affairs People's Committee. Liu Muzhou in the Yuan Laoyuan was questioned until his face alternated red and white; he almost couldn't speak.

He struggled to maintain composure while answering Shan Liang's questions:

"According to the report, one critical factor in the work team's annihilation was failure to give timely warning. If they had alerted in time, they could have been saved, correct?"

"In theory... yes."

Shan Liang said: "According to the map, Zhaopu Village is only just over ten *li* from Danzhou city. So realistically, this is certainly true too. In other words, if the work team had been equipped with proper communications gear, they could have alerted in time."

"Correct."

"Then why weren't they issued such equipment?"

"Our radio equipment is classified as Level One controlled materiel. Small detached parties don't qualify for allocation." Liu Muzhou said. "However, we did issue considerable equipment to the Danzhou work team itself." He reported the models and quantities of transceivers and walkie-talkies issued to the Danzhou work team.

"Do you consider that sufficient?"

"That amount of equipment is inadequate for simultaneously supplying over a dozen work teams plus camps scattered across various locations."

"...So you're saying that despite knowing the communications equipment issued to the Danzhou work team was insufficient, you still sent them out?"

Liu Muzhou protested: "I object to such leading questions! How much equipment we can use is not something the Civil Affairs People's Committee can decide unilaterally!"

"Fine. I withdraw the question." Shan Liang said. "Then, is it possible for your department to employ some alternative means? Such as distress rockets, carrier pigeons, or other primitive but reliable methods?"

"These all involve local factors and technical conditions. For example, using carrier pigeons requires establishing dovecotes locally and training pigeons to develop 'homing instinct' for Danzhou. Otherwise, giving work teams pigeons would be useless—the pigeons would only fly to Lingao. Training pigeons to adapt to a new home isn't accomplished in a day or two. Nick can verify this."

...

Liu Muzhou barely escaped the hearing's fierce bombardment. He silently cursed Liu Yixiao for bungling the job and dragging him in.

"You're hiding in Danzhou taking it easy while I take the heat for you." He muttered silently.

At this point, Mei Lin requested to speak.

"Permission granted!"

Mei Lin stepped to the podium:

"Fellow transmigrators! This Zhaopu Village incident appears accidental, but in fact can be called inevitable. This is a profound lesson..."

"Please get to the point!" Ma Jia, grown drowsy from presiding over this long meeting, said impatiently.

"I believe the primary cause of this malignant incident was complacency in the Danzhou work team's leadership. Between capturing the county seat and dispatching the work teams, they never thoroughly investigated conditions throughout the county's jurisdictions, nor did they timely establish local intelligence networks. If they had first understood the bandits' operating range, numbers, and combat capability, they could have specifically configured the work teams. At minimum, those thirty-odd people would have had sufficient wariness and flexibility for crisis management. Equipment could have been prepared in advance.

"Secondly, inadequate communications equipment. The work team, lacking sufficient radios, didn't consider equipping some simple emergency communication means. They actually relied on human messengers. This is an inexcusable failure! Absolutely intolerable—currently our work teams aren't numerous. Even if we can't issue the radio equipment we brought from this timeline, we should be able to equip lower-tech means like carrier pigeons, smoke canisters, or signal flares. In principle, we should have gone directly to crystal transceivers—last time we discussed radio equipment, people kept saying 'this won't work, that won't work.' I say, just start using it! We can develop and upgrade later..."

"Please don't stray from the topic."

"So on the surface, this work team's annihilation was caused by bandit cunning and cruelty, but actually it's our own fault. Especially several leaders must bear primary responsibility—they should make profound self-criticisms! And the Yuan Laoyuan should vote on appropriate punishments as a warning to others! Additionally: in a sense, this small team's annihilation isn't necessarily a bad thing. This is a loss we must inevitably bear in conquering the world. The cost of just over thirty people exposed the problems in our command level, clarified our understanding—this is very worthwhile—provided we must learn from this lesson! I've finished speaking."

Following this, Cheka chief Yi Fan gave a lengthy discourse on "vigilance against adventurism in local work," arguing that Liu Yixiao's Danzhou work team's approach of multi-point deployment and all-fronts expansion was "adventurism."

"Everyone, in the past in Lingao, we did things step by step. First we controlled the area around the county seat, then suppressed bandits, then wooed the gentry, and only then started work-team deployment. But the Danzhou work team cast their net too wide and tried to do everything at once, without being fully prepared. No surprise this malignant incident occurred."

Yi Fan continued:

"There are many lessons from this incident. We haven't done well enough on details. I propose revising the work team's *Work Manual*. The standard procedures need to be reformulated based on this experience. Especially regarding food safety—we need to restrict which vegetables and fruits are edible. Distribute plant-and-animal handbooks so native personnel can also distinguish between toxic and edible plants. At the same time, villages to be stationed in should be scored for security level. The more dangerous ones should receive higher-level communication equipment as a priority—like carrier pigeons, signal flares, or even walkie-talkies. Then overall, we still need to consider breaking up existing village structures, consolidating villages, and gradually mobilizing local populations."

"This incident shows that relying solely on work teams while neglecting armed struggle won't work." Wei Aiwen followed, speaking eloquently. "We underestimated counter-insurgency warfare. Given that our administered territory will keep expanding, establishing specialized research institutions to study this is imperative."

...

The Yuan Laoyuan finally concluded: thirty-five people dead at once, fallen to bandits. This was an unprecedented disaster! All agreed this matter must be handled seriously, investigated thoroughly!

Subsequently, Qian Shuiting and others proposed establishing a Zhaopu Village Incident Investigation Committee, which would dispatch specialists to Danzhou for a comprehensive investigation. While gathering experience and summarizing lessons, they would investigate whether the Danzhou Work Force and garrison had been derelict or in violation—whether they bore direct responsibility for this incident.

The Yuan Laoyuan Standing Committee passed this resolution and elected the committee.

Committee Chairman Qian Shuiting believed that since the report mentioned signs of poisoning in the work team, professional personnel should be dispatched. Ultimately, Fa Shilu, a botany expert from the Agricultural Committee, was appointed Investigation Commissioner, with Ji Xin from the Arbitration Court as Deputy Commissioner. Lan Yangyang was designated forensic examiner—though he repeatedly insisted he was only a gastroenterologist.

The investigation team received an Independent Investigation Credential from the Arbitration Court. With this document, Danzhou authorities were required to fully cooperate with their work without any obstruction or evasion. The investigation team had authority to inspect and seize any physical evidence and speak privately with anyone. Their compiled reports and materials would also be confidential, submitted only to the committee for review and discussion.

The investigation team first traveled to Danzhou on a navy supply ship. After a brief welcome from Liu Yixiao at the dock, they transferred to an ox cart heading for Danzhou city.

"All physical evidence and the bodies kept for autopsy are in Danzhou city." Liu Yixiao said. "There's no cold storage here. The bodies can only be kept in the basement. They're decomposing rapidly. If you hadn't come soon, we'd have had to cremate them."

"No problem, as long as we can see the stomach contents." Lan Yangyang said, consulting his notebook—notes he had taken after crash-studying *Forensic Medicine* for several days.

Upon arriving in Danzhou, the investigation team immediately got busy. Lan Yangyang performed autopsies right away, extracting stomach contents.

He handed a glass jar filled with gray viscous matter to Fa Shilu, removing his mask with relief:

"Done! My part's finished. Over to you now."

Fa Shilu frowned—he smelled a nauseating stench of decay. He took out a portable microscope, donned a mask, and got to work.

The autopsy and examination of residual food in the stomachs confirmed the work team had indeed been poisoned by a plant. After studying the residue, Fa Shilu gave a definite answer:

"It's gelsemium." He said briefly. "Commonly called 'heartbreak grass.' This stuff is extremely toxic. Three or four leaves can kill a person! Even more lethal than arsenic—and it was boiled in water, so the onset was even faster. Without treatment, death within eight hours is certain." He extracted some gray matter with tweezers. "They also added bitter gourd to mask the unusual taste, and lots of green leafy vegetables to hide the leaves. These bandits really were clever!"

"I must tear that gang limb from limb!" Liu Yixiao said through gritted teeth.

"Vegetables must be obtained locally. If the enemy does this, it's virtually impossible to guard against." Yu Zhiqian said. "I need to immediately notify all deployed teams to temporarily stop having locals purchase vegetables—all produce must be personally picked from the fields. Also, prohibit foraging wild vegetables and fruits."

Liu Yixiao asked: "Is there any simple emergency treatment? Train the medics so they can save themselves if they consume something toxic in the future."

"Traditional Chinese medicine says administering a decoction of licorice, mung beans, and honeysuckle can detoxify. But I think stomach pumping is needed first for such antidote soups to be effective." Lan Yangyang said. "At minimum, induce vomiting. With this toxic plant, if you can induce vomiting immediately, you gain a lot more rescue time."

"These three ingredients aren't hard to get. We'll prepare a supply for every work team from now on!" Liu Yixiao became very enthusiastic. "We just don't have emetics—hopefully the Health Department can solve that."
