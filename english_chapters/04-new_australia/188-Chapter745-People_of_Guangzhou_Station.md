# Chapter 745 - People of Guangzhou Station

Guo Yi stood before the mirror, carefully examining himself. His hair had grown out again. During the feverish war preparations preceding the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign, he—like other gentlemen of the Guangzhou Station who had withdrawn—had shaved his head, trading his long hair for a clean, comfortable crew cut. At the time, his head had felt lighter, almost buoyant.

He had been the first to shave off his long hair, a gesture that also implied "obeying arrangements" to the organization. Shortly after his return, whispers had begun circulating that certain people in the Executive Committee and Senate were dissatisfied with the Guangzhou Station—some even suspected its loyalty. Rumors about major personnel adjustments at Guangzhou Station reached the ears of its personnel. Subsequently, Zhang Yuchen became the first to be formally transferred out of the Guangzhou Station establishment, becoming a "Leisure Senator"—a new term coined by a group of literature and history scholars dissatisfied with the title "Basic Labor Power Senator."

Immediately afterward, Zhang Xin and Lin Baiguang were dispatched back to Guangzhou to transfer the intelligence system—signaling that Zhang Xin's departure from Guangzhou Station was also a foregone conclusion. According to information revealed by Si Kaide, Office Director of the Ministry of Colonization and Trade, Zhang Xin would likely be sent to a new business location.

Yan Maoda had also been called in by the Organization Department for a talk—he would reportedly transfer to Leizhou for work soon. Chang Shide's transfer order was said to be imminent as well.

This series of transfers led Guo Yi to estimate that his own chances of returning to Guangzhou were slim. Just as comprehensive war preparations commenced, he seized the momentum to get a haircut along with other Senators—expressing that he shared "same breath, same destiny" with the Senate and Lingao.

After the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign's victory, Ming Lang had spoken with him, asking him to prepare for a return to Guangzhou.

"You'd better grow your hair out again. Everyone thinks your work in Guangzhou is very important."

Guo Yi hadn't asked whose idea this was, but since it came from the mouth of the Organization Department Head, it meant the order came from "The Organization." The Organization's orders were inviolable. He simply nodded in silence, expressing his willingness to accept the mission.

The new Guangzhou Station would still be headed by Guo Yi as Station Chief. Zheng Shangjie would ascend to Guangzhou Station Business Person-in-Charge. Pei Xiuli had undergone several months of specialized intelligence training and was preparing to demonstrate her skills on the intelligence front.

As for the Guangzhou Delong Bank and the intelligence system that Lin Baiguang had taken over, they would still belong to the Guangzhou Station organization's management scope, but these two divisions would report independently to their corresponding administrative departments: Delong Guangzhou Branch to the Head Office in Lingao, and the Intelligence System to the External Intelligence Bureau. Delong Bank Head Office had formally activated the Bank Codebook, stipulating that from this day forward, all telegrams from Delong system financial institutions must use this codebook. As for the Intelligence Bureau system—they had possessed their own codes for some time.

But thus far, Guo Yi hadn't had much to do. He had been staying idle in his dormitory all along. The two maids he had brought back—with whom he had physical relationships—were temporarily settled in the Quarantine Camp because they couldn't enter Bairen City. He heard they were undergoing comprehensive interrogation and investigation by the Political Security General Bureau.

*Heaven knows what they wrote in my file,* Guo Yi thought. He touched his chin. Returning to Guangzhou this time, his situation was very different from before. Just as Si Kaide and others had mentioned when discussing work arrangements with him yesterday—his return this time would be in a semi-open status, effectively the Transmigrator Group's Consul in Guangzhou. He would have to focus more energy on dealing with local officials and gentry.

"The opinion of the Great Library and Propaganda Department is that you should vigorously promote Australian culture and lifestyle in Guangzhou, imperceptibly changing the thinking mode and lifestyle of Guangzhou citizens." Si Kaide had read this passage somewhat haltingly. "Anyway, that's the meaning..."

Guo Yi was very familiar with this meaning: "It's just Peaceful Evolution."

"Right, right, right—that's precisely it." Si Kaide pulled out a wooden cigar box. "Have one? Gift from Wu Nanhai."

"Thanks." The cigar in the box had a rich aroma—actually, this wasn't merely the smell of tobacco leaves, but a mixed fragrance formed after spraying a small amount of rum on the leaves. Guo Yi had smoked a water pipe in Guangzhou—but his luxurious water pipe had been left behind there, now fallen into unknown hands.

He still remembered how much he had loved that silver water pipe, including all its accessories. None failed to display the highest achievements of ancient Chinese handicraft. Whether fine carving, inlay, or knitting—all were wonderful workmanship excelling nature, worthy of being called exquisite works of art. Smoking it had produced no fiery temper and was very clean. But thinking carefully, this could probably be considered a manifestation of "corroded by Daming life." Si Kaide offering him a cigar might be reminding him of this issue.

He picked up a cigar, cut a small opening with the cigar cutter Si Kaide handed over, and lit it himself.

"Not bad, right? I heard this was rolled on Chu Qing's thigh," Si Kaide said.

"Hehe." Guo Yi gave a dry laugh.

Si Kaide puffed clouds of smoke: "Go back and prepare. After New Year's Day and the Annual Meeting, you're returning to Guangzhou. The Executive Committee and Senate's meaning is that you should be a bit more ostentatious—no need to stay too low-key. Everyone knows you're an Australian Grand Merchant anyway. And you're carrying the prestige of total victory."

"Should we organize a restart celebration event for the Purple Tower?"

"Absolutely." Si Kaide nodded. "Celebration activities can also fully display the Australian lifestyle." He waved his cigar mysteriously. "There's a grapevine rumor—someone proposed building a luxury yacht specifically for you, Proprietor Guo, to anchor at White Goose Pool. Spin around on the river when you're free, making Guangzhou's local rich merchants envious to death..."

"Isn't that too showy?"

"We just shelled Guangzhou—isn't that more showy?" Si Kaide said nonchalantly. "The government backed down. We need to seize the time to demonstrate our strength. Daming can't maintain its position in Guangdong for many more years. Let the local rich fully recognize our strength and capability first—they'll follow us obediently later."

Guo Yi received a new radio operator—among the first generation of indigenous radio operators cultivated by Lingao Telecom. This batch could already proficiently operate radios. As for decoding work, that would be handled by confidential clerks trained by the Political Security Bureau. The indigenous personnel system of Guangzhou Station had undergone comprehensive cleaning this time; the core now consisted entirely of indigenous personnel who had passed screening and rectification.

Guo Yi examined his image in the mirror one final time. His hair was on the long side; without a stylist's care, it draped behind his head in disorder, looking somewhat uncivilized. In another spacetime, he could have found a rubber band to tie up his hair, but here rubber bands were nowhere to be found. He had to ask Zheng Shangjie for a black iron hair hoop to secure it.

After tidying everything up, he checked his watch. The time for the Ministry of Colonization and Trade's "PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) Session" had arrived again. This ritual had become like studying the "Three Old Articles" during the Cultural Revolution—a fixed procedure no department could shake each day. Guo Yi was privately quite disgusted with this, but he always maintained a "no comment" attitude toward such things to avoid inviting trouble.

On his way out, he secretly reminded himself to visit Yi Liu and Zhi Tao after the meeting. These two were his chamber maids in Guangzhou—called "Life Secretaries" in Lingao. After returning to Lingao, he had retroactively paid the "Excess Maid Occupation Compensation Fee" and "Super-grade Maid Occupation Compensation Fee." This was a resolution path specifically opened for overseas personnel occupying more women. After paying the fee, this was considered legal.

Yi Liu and Zhi Tao naturally weren't nation-toppling beauties, but according to the Maid Countermeasure Committee's evaluation standards, both girls had A-Class levels. To avoid others' envy and jealousy, after returning to Lingao, he had quietly arranged them in the Quarantine Camp to accept quarantine and screening, trying to minimize contact with them.

According to the Overseas Station Indigenous Personnel Training Plan, Yi Liu and Zhi Tao had respectively received training in accounting and secretarial work. Naturally, they had also undergone brainwashing education and screening. Any indigenous personnel screened as "unreliable" would at best remain in Lingao to work—or at worst, disappear entirely, mostly sent to "Study Classes" for "Re-education."

Guo Yi's occupation of these two women had initially stemmed from physical needs more than spiritual love. But as feelings grew over time, he gradually developed genuine affection for them. So when he heard that both had fallen into the "Qualified" category after screening ended—according to the Political Security General Bureau's files, the actual political appraisal was Grade II-B—he couldn't help breathing a sigh of relief. At least they wouldn't have to be separated.

Coming out from the meeting, Zheng Shangjie invited Guo Yi to attend a small-scale party on the *Flying Cloud* in a few days.

"Bring your two maids along too."

"Isn't that too conspicuous?"

"It's fine. I also want to ask if they can help during the Annual Meeting. I want to borrow a dozen good-looking, tall maids from everyone's households to serve as waitresses for the event." Zheng Shangjie said. "Don't keep hiding and tucking away. They've both passed through official channels at the Executive Committee—what are you afraid of? Besides, you're a Senator too now."

"I don't mean that—"

"Then what do you mean? You must come! Bring the two maids too!"

"Alright." Guo Yi nodded helplessly.

"I'll go invite Little Pei."

Pei Xiuli had been at loose ends after returning to Lingao. Apart from participating in a PDCA session and a few military training sessions during the comprehensive mobilization of the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign, she had nothing to do. Finally, out of extreme boredom, she had accepted Dong Weiwei's invitation to teach part-time at the Maid Class, lecturing on "Women's Compulsory Courses" like clothing matching, makeup, manicures, skin care, and fitness. She found genuine enjoyment in it.

Zheng Shangjie's organization of the Annual Meeting made her very excited—she was naturally fond of liveliness and showing off. She certainly didn't want to miss such an occasion.
