# Chapter 633 - The General (Part Two)

He had already sent people to post notices in Guangzhou and Qiongzhou, recruiting those who understood the internal situation of the Hair Thieves and were familiar with Lingao. He also found some sailors and merchants who had been to Lingao and questioned them about the Hair Thieves' details.

But what these people could tell him was nothing more than that the Hair Thieves had big iron ships, fast boats, and were good at business, which was of little use for fighting wars.

As for the Hair Thieves' combat power, he learned from these people that the other side "wears no armor, uses only bird guns, has orderly ranks, and strict discipline." In addition, there was the widely circulated "sharp firearms."

These few words alone were naturally insufficient evidence. However, merchants and sailors were not military men and originally paid little attention to the Hair Thieves' guns and martial arts. What they said was not detailed; some were greedy for reward money or intimidated by official authority, while others talked nonsense and made things up. there were many contradictions, which actually made him somewhat confused.

It seemed he still needed to find local gentry and scholars; how could ordinary foolish men and women clarify such major military and state affairs? Thinking of this, he asked the staff officer beside him:

"Are there any recruits from Qiongshan and Guangzhou?"

The staff officer said: "There are a few, but upon slight questioning of their background, most are ambitious people hoping for reckless advancement by offering strategies to defeat the enemy. There isn't a single person who truly knows the internal situation of the Hair Thieves."

Returning to the main camp, the latest Hainan garrison report forwarded from Zhaoqing by fast horse had been placed on the desk. Recently, garrison reports from Hainan had increased significantly. He Rubin opened it and saw it was the latest garrison report on the war situation in Chengmai and Lingao sent by the Hainan Sub-prefectural Magistrate.

The first one was a garrison report about Lingao. Sun Tianbiao, a Hundred Household officer and the only surviving officer of the Rear Thousand Household Office under the Lingao Attached Guard of Five Thousand Households, had arrived in Zhaoqing and personally stated the details of the Thousand Household City's fall. according to him: originally under Thousand Householder Liu's supervision, everyone fought bravely for six days and nights. The Hair Thieves could never break the city, and the Thousand Household city was "as steady as Mount Tai." However, there were several "Han traitors" in the city who had been seduced by the Hair Thieves. Taking advantage of everyone's unpreparedness, they suddenly rebelled. They killed Thousand Householder Liu and secretly opened the city gate, causing the city to fall. The "Han traitors" then used the command arrows and documents captured in the city to trick open other Tuntian stations and the main camp. This caused the total annihilation of the entire Rear Thousand Household Office of the Lingao Attached Guard.

This garrison report was first-hand material, much more valuable than hearsay gathered by spies, so He Rubin read it very carefully.

Next was about the inquiry into the siege of Lingao. According to Sun Tianbiao who fled back: he heard the Hair Thieves coerced over ten thousand local troops, civilians, and able-bodied men to besiege Lingao County City, but he didn't know much about the specific situation, "only hearing cannon fire shaking the sky, and the roads full of Hair Thief troops." He himself "abandoned wife and son, forgetting life and death" to break out.

This was nonsense. He Rubin thought about the content of the previous garrison report; when Sun Tianbiao fled to Qiongshan, news of Lingao being besieged hadn't come yet—the county's distress messenger arrived several days later.

As for Lingao being besieged, there was no specific news—except for a distress document sent by the Lingao Magistrate. After Chengmai was besieged, the postal road was completely cut off, and news was almost completely interrupted. Once the postal road was cut, news from Danzhou and Changhua could not come through either. Garrison reports had to circle the island in the opposite direction or be delivered to Leizhou before reaching Qiongzhou Prefectural City.

"Where is the person who delivered the Lingao distress document?"

"The letter was delivered to Qiongshan, then forwarded to the province by the Qiongzhou Prefect. The person is probably in Qiongshan," a staff officer said. "Seven or eight days have passed; probably went back to Lingao long ago."

He Rubin thought it would have been good if he had instructed Tang Yunwen to detain the messenger back then. This person could definitely provide much news about the Hair Thieves.

The second letter was news from Chengmai. He Rubin originally thought Chengmai must have fallen—he knew the scale of county cities on Hainan Island; most cities had crude defense facilities and insufficient artillery. As for the garrison, it was practically non-existent—expecting "weary and old soldiers" from the Wei-Suo to rescue the county city was simply wishful thinking. A force of two or three thousand could not fail to take it if they attacked with deadly force.

But opening the garrison report, it was sent from Chengmai County. It seemed Chengmai was still in government hands, and external communication wasn't cut off.

"Hearing the Hair Thieves call themselves the Fubo Army, on this day about a thousand infantry and artillery troops, with dozens of cannons, set up a stockade outside the south gate. Thief troops gathered outside the city; city militia and brave corps sortied to engage, beheading hundreds of thieves. But the thief force was great and firearms sharp; our troops suffered a slight setback. Hair Thieves took advantage of the momentum to attack the south gate; military and civilians in the city resisted to the death. The gate tower changed hands dozens of times; Hair Thieves finally couldn't support and routed, with dozens of thief leaders, big and small, beheaded, including three True Hair Thieves. According to prisoner confessions: among beheaded True Hair Thieves was one falsely titled 'Director' and one false Defender. Hair Thieves, etc., forgetting life and death, actually snatched the thief corpses away. Seeing the county city not falling, thief bandit chiefs You Laohu and Yu Zhiqian split forces to four directions to loot, with many gentry families suffering. They coerced thousands of militia to build a long siege and strong stockades. Also bombarded with giant cannons; arrows and bullets flew everywhere. countless military and civilians inside the city were dead or wounded, houses burned, debris everywhere. Women and children slept in the wild, wailing sounds unceasing all day long; the state is unbearable to witness. Must report this in the garrison report!"

He Rubin breathed a slight sigh of relief. It seemed the Hair Thieves' land warfare was indeed lax. A tiny Chengmai County City hadn't been taken despite using thousands of people and so-called "sharp" cannons. No wonder Lingao County City could persist for over three years.

This made him more determined in his strategy of using only land forces and not naval forces. He originally wanted to order Tang Yunwen immediately to reinforce Chengmai. Tang Yunwen's headquarters plus local village braves could mobilize about two thousand men. Chengmai to Qiongshan was only half a day's journey, requiring no extra deployment or pay expenditure. Just forcing the Hair Thieves to lift the siege would count as a small victory.

He instructed someone to invite the staff officers immediately. To discuss the battle of reinforcing Chengmai.

His main advisor was naturally not Lu Yizhong. Although Lu Yizhong was quite "knowledgeable about soldiers," he was after all sent by the Governor-General, separated by layer. He wanted to hear the opinions of staff officers whose interests were closely linked to his own.

The staff officers read the garrison report and believed the Hair Thieves must know the Court wanted to surround and suppress them, so they attacked county cities everywhere. Their intent was merely to create momentum, making the government army fearful and afraid to suppress.

He Rubin smiled and asked: "I intend to transfer General Tang's troops to rescue Chengmai; what do you gentlemen think?"

The staff officers believed that although the Hair Thieves had sharp firearms, they couldn't take Lingao or Chengmai, proving their land warfare was indeed incompetent. Tang Yunwen's troops were considered relatively "capable of fighting" among Ming troops in Guangdong; sending him to rescue Chengmai would surely achieve success.

As long as the Hair Thieves besieging Chengmai were driven away, the constant "urging for battle" from the Governor-General could also have a buffer. Overall, the majority opinion of the staff was still "prudence." They didn't hope for the whole army to land on the island for a crusade early.

One staff officer among them shook his head repeatedly: "Your Excellency, General Tang's troops are mostly naval forces. Field battles and breaking sieges are not their forte. Rescuing rashly, if they suffer a setback, morale might waver."

This staff officer was named Chang Qingyun, a Juren. He was quite fond of the study of statecraft. Although he had never been an official, he was very familiar with officialdom. He was one of He Rubin's more trusted advisors.

He Rubin nodded silently, thinking that although Tang Yunwen's troops were claimed to be five thousand, combat soldiers were only over two thousand. Most were navy, unaccustomed to infantry combat, and had few land warfare firearms. These troops were also scattered across multiple counties in Hainan. Rescuing Chengmai would rely on Qiongshan's village braves as the main force.

Although village braves had strong combat power, their morale would be greatly discounted once leaving their native land, requiring heavy rewards to fight hard. According to the garrison report, the Hair Thieves built long sieges and camped stockades under Chengmai City. Defenses must be very tight. When the opponent defended the stockade to fight, with fierce firearms, Tang Yunwen might not gain an advantage. Wouldn't the government army be in a dilemma under Chengmai City?

Thinking of this, he temporarily dismissed the idea of letting Tang Yunwen send troops to rescue Chengmai. However, if Chengmai fell, Tang Yunwen, as the Regional Commander of Qiongya Land Roads and concurrently managing Baisha Water Stockade Coastal Defense, would bear the greatest responsibility. But he himself was the military chief of Guangdong and the main general of the expedition against Hair Thieves; responsibility for a fallen county city couldn't be escaped.

"In this student's view, Your Excellency might as well issue a handwritten order to Regional Commander Tang immediately, asking him to act according to circumstances and rescue Chengmai quickly."

The staff officers nodded one after another: Since it was "quickly" and also "according to circumstances," this was indeed clever! Commander He had issued the rescue order anyway; the ball of whether to rescue or not was kicked directly to Regional Commander Tang's feet. Even if Chengmai fell, it couldn't be traced to He Rubin—his central battalion troops had already crossed the sea; it couldn't be said he didn't save them. This was one thing; second, even if Chengmai temporarily fell, once the grand army assembled, recovering Chengmai would be a simple effort on the march.

"Furthermore, in this student's view, the Hair Thieves have no power to break the city," Chang Qingyun said. "If they had power to break the city, why force laborers to build long sieges and strong stockades? This must be the Hair Thieves' plan for a long siege. The Chengmai Magistrate only needs to defend carefully to ensure the safety of the whole city. The plan for now is to order someone to sneak into the city and deliver a letter saying the grand army will definitely come to rescue. The military and civilians of the whole city will definitely defend with full strength awaiting the grand army upon seeing it."

He Rubin felt his idea wasn't bad, so he instructed a secretary handling correspondence to prepare the handwritten order for Tang Yunwen, and hand-wrote a note asking Chengmai's officials, gentry, and people to defend to the death:

"To Magistrate Qiu of Chengmai and the defending officials and gentry of Chengmai: This Commander will personally lead the grand army to reinforce within days. Hope you defend resolutely without slack, awaiting the siege lift."

He didn't write a date below, only signed his name.

Thinking about it, he wrote a second identical note, only changing the addressee to: "To Magistrate Wu of Lingao and the defending officials and gentry of Chengmai."

After writing, he ordered two elite soldiers fluent in Qiongshan dialect selected from the army, rewarded each with twenty taels of silver, to carry the two letters across the sea for delivery immediately.

Having done these two things, He Rubin felt somewhat cheerful. Thinking that because Lu Yizhong constantly urged advance, he had sent the central battalion across the sea, which turned out to be a lucky hit.

He smiled and asked everyone: "For this cross-sea expedition, we know little of the Hair Thieves' details. The twenty thousand troops I brought, deducting empty quotas and the old and weak, only have over ten thousand capable of fighting. I wonder if we can fight the Hair Thieves?"

Everyone inevitably offered flattery again, saying things like "Once the grand army arrives, the ugly kind will be cleansed," "Greatly extend punitive expedition," "Greatly display military might," etc. Half of this was flattering him, but half was the staff officers' real thoughts—in their view, Hair Thieves only relied on strange skills and clever tricks, with slightly powerful firearms. If they really set up a format array for field battle, they were absolutely not the match for the Court's grand army. So no one held doubts about the war's outcome.

One staff officer said that although the Hair Thieves were not a worry, they had sturdy ships and sharp cannons after all, and had gathered tens of thousands of "Fujian and Guangdong traitorous people." And the government knew very little about the Hair Thieves' details so far, not even knowing the name of the Hair Thief leader.

The government's only source of intelligence was garrison reports and various market rumors.

"Iron ships floating on the sea, fast ships moving without oars or sails—isn't this becoming monstrous!" He Rubin consistently disbelieved this, only believing thirty percent after receiving Tang Yunwen's garrison report. But generals exaggerating enemy situations to shirk responsibility or boast of war merit was common.

"As the saying goes, know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated in a hundred battles. Our army knows itself but not the enemy," Chang Qingyun sighed.

"That Sun Tianbiao fled back from Lingao and must know much about the Hair Thieves' details. Why not transfer him to the army for use?" A staff officer suggested.

"Sir speaks very truly." He Rubin nodded. Sun Tianbiao fled back from Lingao and was an officer; he must know a lot. Having him listen to orders before the tent would provide much useful information. "I will request the Governor General to transfer this person immediately. Appoint him an external acting squad leader rank first."

Chang Qingyun said: "Your Excellency going to suppress bandits will definitely achieve total success. This goes without saying. Only, the suppression must be done beautifully. If it's like Commander Yu mobilizing troops back then, only ending in forcing the enemy to retreat with their whole army, it would be far inferior to the majesty of the Shuangyu Victory."

He Rubin originally had great wariness of overseas people. Back then, driving away the Red Hairs with military force was only because civil and military officials believed combat power was disparate; even if they won, excessive losses couldn't be explained to the Court. Now hearing Chang Qingyun say this, he thought Wang Zunde was just repeating the old trick.

Chang Qingyun believed that Hair Thieves had big iron ships and iron fast ships. If only forced to destroy their city and stockades and leave, they would inevitably choose another location to build forts again. How could such overseas barbarians, braving ten thousand miles of ocean waves to trade in China regardless of life and death, give up easily? They would definitely seek another lair. Although the Dutch retreated due to the government army's great power back then, they ultimately received the promise allowing merchants to trade in Taiwan. Moreover, they immediately turned to Taiwan to build castles. To this day, Red Hair barbarians were still a scourge on the Great Ming coast.

"Your meaning, sir?"

"Hair Thieves are skilled with boats. Although our army cannot fight them on the ocean waves, we can break them with a strategy of surprise troops," Chang Qingyun said with great assurance.

A staff officer laughed: "Could it be imitating Zhuge Liang's old trick?"

"Hair Thief ships are mostly made of iron; hard to burn with fire." Another staff officer shook his head to express disapproval.

Chang Qingyun's surprise troops turned out not to be fire ships, the traditional Chinese naval weapon, the main means for Great Ming and Great Qing navies to resist foreign aggression. His surprise weapon was the "Underwater Muddy River Dragon"—a traditional Chinese-made naval mine. According to some books, the "Underwater Muddy River Dragon" was a primitive moored mine, its significance similar to the "Nest of Bees" being the ancestor of modern rocket artillery.

However, due to serious problems with the ignition mechanism and difficulty in deployment, this kind of moored mine never played a practical role, gradually becoming a "divine weapon" in books.

He Rubin naturally knew of this thing. The late Ming was an era of explosive growth for Chinese firearms. Anyone literate talked about firearm invention and creation, though most were just hoping to get promoted and rich by it, as Song Yingxing said.

The "Underwater Muddy River Dragon" had no practical value at all; He Rubin knew this very clearly. But Chang Qingyun's surprise weapon was an improved version—similar to a drifting mine.

Chang Qingyun immediately used tea as ink to draw a sketch on the table. Roughly, gunpowder was sealed in a clay pot, then bamboo was tied crosswise on four sides, providing buoyancy and making it easy to hook onto ships. The raft was then covered with straw or similar. Specialized soldiers skilled in swimming would push it to the Hair Thief ship's side, then ignite the fuse.

"Or perhaps no soldiers needed. Just send small boats at night when tide enters the harbor, release a hundred or so Muddy River Dragons outside the harbor, drifting into the harbor with the tide. Use slow-burning incense for ignition inside the Muddy River Dragon," Chang Qingyun said.

Releasing drifting mines like this naturally had no accuracy to speak of, so many had to be released—one or two hundred at a time. Even if none hooked onto ships, just exploding at the time would serve to disturb the Hair Thieves. If they could sink or damage the big iron ships the Hair Thieves relied on as their Great Wall, the Hair Thieves could only surrender.

Chang Qingyun's new tactic caused a discussion among the staff officers. They naturally understood the significance of this Muddy River Dragon. If large numbers were released in Bopu, Hair Thief ships would not only be damaged, but remaining ships wouldn't dare stay long in the harbor. They would inevitably sue for peace early.

He Rubin wondered if this thing would work? But it cost little. He Rubin didn't quite believe this thing could sink big iron ships, but sinking a few iron fast ships would be a great merit. So he agreed to have a batch trial-produced first.

"It is best to have soldiers skilled in swimming push this object into the harbor," Chang Qingyun suggested. "Your Excellency might as well establish a Mine Regiment, selecting a hundred or so water braves skilled in swimming for training. It will surely achieve miraculous success!"

A local staff officer said: "This province has Tanka boat people, lowly households living adrift on water, many of whom are treacherous thieves. But their swimming skills are excellent. Why not recruit them as water braves, driving them to release Muddy River Dragons. Achieving the effect of using poison to attack poison—even if there are casualties, it is not pitiable. It won't damage Heaven's prestige and can eliminate a local harm."

Starting from this, staff officers talked about firearms. The late Ming was an era where everyone talked about firearms; various books were numerous and not hard to obtain, so staff officers could mostly say something about it. He Rubin was also an adept in this field and even had written works; once talking, he was even more eloquent. Because rumors said Hair Thief firearms were fierce, everyone wanted to find several fiercer methods to restrain the enemy.

He Rubin pondered for a moment. He couldn't make the decision alone to recruit water braves; he needed the Governor-General and Provincial Governor's approval. But this wasn't a bad way to win victory. Recruiting two or three hundred water braves cost little. Even if the Muddy River Dragon was useless, they could be used for fighting.
