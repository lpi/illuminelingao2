# Chapter 748 - Continuous Stream

The Rolling Mill had 2 Cold Drawing Steel Pipe Machines and 2 Cold Rolling Steel Pipe Machines for drawing seamless steel pipes—of course, even without these machines brought from another spacetime, given Lingao's industrial standard, self-manufacturing a few cold drawing steel pipe machines wouldn't be much of a problem.

The Rolling Mill already had ample experience in manufacturing cold-drawn seamless steel pipes—so far, all gun barrels produced in Lingao were cold-drawn seamless pipes. With sufficient production experience, producing another specification of steel pipe was not a problem.

The new boiler still adopted riveting technology, with material entirely using low-carbon steel—equipment on ships was incomparable to land; once a problem occurred, consequences were much more serious. Early marine boiler explosions never failed to cause major accidents—safety first.

Sun Li and Zhou Bili had previous experience building Lancashire boilers. They consulted a lot of materials, compared advantages and disadvantages of various boilers, assisted by computer design and selection, and finally designed and manufactured a "Zhurong Type II" fire-tube boiler. Its overall structural strength far exceeded the Lancashire boilers they imitated early on.

The finally manufactured boiler easily reached the expected output pressure during pilot ignition operation: 3.5 KG/CM output pressure. Such a large output value was already double that of the boilers used by the *Great Eastern* in the 1850s. The *Great Eastern* used old-style box boilers with output pressure less than 1.8 KG/CM. To provide power for the 4800hp marine engine, it had to use six such large box boilers.

The only thing worrying Sun Li was that the pressure gauge on this boiler had some issues; he was very worried that one day a pressure indication error would cause a tragedy.

With such high-pressure boilers, not only could cabin space be saved, but a foundation was laid for developing triple-expansion or even quadruple-expansion steam engines later.

According to the rated 500hp steam engine output power, just 1 such boiler could meet the steam engine's demand. However, there were many places on the ship using steam; surplus steam could be used for cooking, providing distilled water for crew members... It was finally decided to install two such boilers in the 854 Modified hull.

The 854 Modified project group still prudently decided to start by selecting only the simpler-to-manufacture 500hp steam engine as power. Marine steam engines had special requirements for size and operation mode, so standard steam engines widely used in Lingao industry currently couldn't be directly installed on ships. A specialized marine steam engine had to be redeveloped. Zhan Wuya's opinion was that this steam engine should be a standardized piece of equipment; if there were no special requirements, it would be universally installed on all ships requiring 500hp power.

Finally, Sun Li and others responsible for steam engine development decided to use the reciprocating inverted vertical steam engine, which was widely used and technically mature in the mid-to-late 19th century. It occupied the smallest floor area in the hull, and if necessary, two machines could be installed inside the ship, laying a foundation for using twin propellers later. This steam engine hosted by Sun Li was a compound expansion type with higher efficiency than before, and could be improved to triple and quadruple expansion later. The Manufacturing Directorate decided to start imitation from compound expansion and improve step by step.

Besides the 500hp main engine, 2 existing 12hp small steam engines would be installed for auxiliary operation power, including raising and lowering sails, driving cannon operation, and launching/recovering small boats.

After the power scheme was solved, the biggest technical bottleneck of the 854 Modified shipbuilding project ceased to exist. The last relatively large technical difficulty was the paint used for the hull. Although the ship bottom was sheathed with copper and no longer needed special antifouling paint, the entire hull still needed paint as material protection.

There was no modern paint in this spacetime, and botanical substitutes like raw lacquer, soybean oil, and hemp oil all had quantity shortage problems. Finally, the ship coating used asphalt paint extracted from coal tar. Asphalt paint had a strong anti-corrosion effect and was the most widely used marine coating in the European shipbuilding industry before large-scale use of paint. This smelly thing coated on the hull made the entire ship appear an ugly light black. So much so that the first batch of Lingao-made modernized ships were called "Black Ships."

Of course, truly building a ship into shape and launching it for operation wasn't just building a hull and installing an engine. With every step the 854 Modified project advanced, the Manufacturing Directorate and Planning Agency would discover countless new problems needing solution. Some required the Planning Agency to find new raw materials from various channels. Some required industrial departments to manufacture new equipment. More problems were that they only had technical data but no truly knowledgeable professionals. Everything relied on Transmigrators themselves to grope, understand, and experiment.

"...The construction of the 854 Modified project powerfully promoted the matching and systematization of the new industrial system, enhancing the overall collaboration ability and consciousness between industrial departments. Industrial departments established 2 new industrial departments for this project, manufactured 297 units (sets) of new equipment, among which 46 units (sets) were large equipment, manufactured 2515 pieces (sets) of process equipment and molds, trained 3490 person-times of technical personnel and workers..." (Excerpt from *History of Contemporary Industry: Shipbuilding Industry Volume*, First Edition, Internal Distribution, citation not permitted without permission)

Such stumbling progress was full of adventure, waste, frustration, disappointment, and surprise. So much so that Zhou Ke once said in a drunken slip: Considering the various difficulties he experienced engaging in the 854 Modified project, rushing to start Project 854 back then was an unrealistic "Great Leap Forward."

Compared to the 854 Modified project, the construction process of six 500-ton class wind-steam hybrid power ships was much more simplified—basically, technical achievements and experience gained in building 854 Modified could be immediately applied to the construction of these ships. Many accessories, tools, and equipment manufactured for 854 Modified could also be directly used on these ships.

According to the regulations of the "First Shipbuilding Refit Plan," the construction of this batch of ships was Project 901. After some design discussion, the final Project 901 scheme was to copy the Northern "90-day gunboat" during the American Civil War. The lead ship USS *Unadilla* started construction in late spring, launched in mid-August, and commissioned in late September, hence the name "90-day." The construction cycle of this warship was very short, winning the appreciation of Transmigrators who urgently needed new ships.

The final construction specifications for Project 901 were: waterline length 48 meters, beam 8.5 meters, max draft 2.9 meters, displacement 690 tons, deadweight 507 tons, double-masted Barquentine rig. Installed one 500hp steam engine, single propeller. Also installed 1 auxiliary steam engine of 12hp. Max speed 10 knots. Crew 114. The Admiralty designated it as a Fourth-Rate Gunboat.

The positioning of this Fourth-Rate Gunboat was to undertake more route escort and long-range patrol tasks. Also executing freight tasks. Its coal bunker area was adjustable, dynamically changing coal loading volume or cargo loading volume according to different mission executions.

The 500hp tugboat was named Project 621. Tugboats not only had to tow barges; since a large batch of large-tonnage ships was put into construction, future berthing and docking of these ships entering and leaving port couldn't be solved by small-horsepower steam *Daihatsu* boats. There must be high-horsepower tugboats to assist large ships in docking and undocking.

Project 621 adopted twin paddle wheel propulsion—paddle wheel propulsion had the advantage of shallow draft, suitable for activities in coastal and harbor areas; if necessary, it could also enter larger inland rivers. Moreover, it didn't fear entanglement by fishing nets and waterweeds common in offshore and inland rivers. Twin paddle wheel maneuverability was also relatively good, fitting well with the two roles Transmigrators assigned to it.

While shipbuilding engineering was proceeding like a raging fire, at the Navy's request, the modification of various steam boats originally equipped was also put on the agenda. They would be converted in batches to use *Tieli Mu* bearings and newly manufactured cast iron propellers to improve small boat combat capability. The Navy planned that once modification was complete, part of the armed *Daihatsu* steam boats would be shipped to Hong Kong and other places for various short-distance maritime chores. Cooperating with Type II double-masted patrol boats as the main force of the Hong Kong and Pearl River Basin Detachment Fleet.

Massive shipbuilding and ship repair tasks poured into the shipyard continuously, forcing Zhou Ke to demand a 12-hour double-shift system at the shipyard. Originally they adopted an 8-hour three-shift system, but the scarcity of workers made it difficult for Zhou Ke to maintain such a labor system. Demanding extended working hours.

"Otherwise three shifts are meaningless; under current shipbuilding scale, my workers aren't even enough to maintain two shifts." Zhou Ke complained when meeting Wu De, "Not only must you approve my two-shift plan, but you also have to supplement workers—even untrained workers are fine. At least they call act as coolies."

Wu De said: "Making workers work 12 hours continuously, can you ensure workers won't have problems in the long run? A few skilled workers dying from work injuries would be a huge loss."

"It's said 19th-century workers generally worked 12-14 hours. I think maintaining a 12-hour work system for a few months won't have a big impact. Strengthen food a bit more; I want to apply to give workers more food allowance—especially protein free ration quota and candy. Also, energy supplements can be distributed."

Wu De agreed to his request. Subsequently, he ordered that labor forces recently ending "training" from the quarantine camp be prioritized for the shipyard. And the weekly "Learn Industry" activities of Fangcaodi were mostly changed to "Learn Labor" at the shipyard and other shipbuilding-related industrial departments. Although these students might not understand technology, at least they could write and calculate—this simplest skill was also rare among Lingao's worker group.
