# Chapter 572 - New Religion

He Ying knew that Ming Dynasty block-printed books were quite expensive, and moreover, for Elders to spend silver personally required tedious exchange procedures through Delung. Most Elders couldn't be bothered. This Zhang Yingchen really was willing to invest. On the snow-white wall hung a painting of Laozi Converting the Barbarians, a work by some Ming local painter—probably also purchased from among the Gou family spoils.

Zhang Yingchen wore a strange outfit: a navy blue cross-collared Daoist robe with a cloth sash at the waist, tailored by the Lingao clothing factory according to his design. He'd kept his hair in a short ponytail style, looking like someone in modern art.

This man was humming a song while rapidly writing something on paper. He Ying listened closely and realized he was writing lyrics to match scripture melodies.

"Such fine propaganda talent being used for this is a bit of a waste," He Ying said, looking at the several new Daoist religious hymns Zhang Yingchen had composed. He sounded somewhat regretful.

"Being able to shine and generate heat in the most suitable position, contributing to the transmigrator collective—that's not wasteful." Only then did Zhang Yingchen notice he'd come in. He quickly removed his headphones and, smiling, brewed fresh tea for him.

"As someone about to grow out my hair, living frugally and speaking cautiously are necessary. So I've quit tobacco and alcohol entirely. I have nothing good to offer you."

"No matter." He Ying thought this person was rather dedicated. He held his teacup and got straight to the point: "I came to hear about your system for this New Daoism."

"Please look at this first." Zhang Yingchen opened a box beside him, which contained fresh-smelling new books. The binding was clearly from the printing works.

He Ying took one and saw the cover read *Taishang Dongyuan Dushi Yujing* (Supreme Cavern-Abyss World-Saving Jade Scripture). He knew nothing about Daoist texts. Flipping through a few pages, he felt somewhat bewildered.

"Look at these lines here." Zhang Yingchen pointed.

He Ying looked where indicated: "In the age of the Great Ming, when the world nears its end, when people lack sincerity, and disturbances arise. Only the sounds of wailing over corpses are heard, not the echoes of immortal songs. The people are defiled, the Three Caverns are blocked, the disasters of the hundred-six calamity arrive—sword and pestilence. The Demon Kings unleash their poison, slaying the good and virtuous. Door after door knows misfortune; mournful cries echo one after another. The masses devour each other, self-creating their suffering, dragging each other to death, embracing ignorance and suffering, not knowing the way out."

"The Great Ming?" he asked hesitantly. "Is this the Great Ming we're currently in?"

"Exactly, this Great Ming." Zhang Yingchen nodded, picking up another book. "Now look here."

"When the great kalpa arrives, in the Central Kingdom there are Immortal Man Wen Si, Immortal Man Wu Mei, and Immortal Man Ma Shu, leading five hundred immortal saints. Together they board iron ships to receive Daoists who possess scriptures. Children, await this."

He Ying immediately understood—this was describing the transmigrator collective! He asked in surprise: "Did you write this?"

"Yes and no." Zhang Yingchen looked rather pleased. He took another book from the shelf and opened it to a certain page for him to see.

The book was titled *Taishang Dongyuan Shenzhou Jing* (Supreme Cavern-Abyss Divine Incantation Scripture). He Ying carefully read the passage indicated: "When the great waters come, in the Central Kingdom there are Immortal Man Tang Ping, Immortal Man Yu Guang, and Immortal Man Ma Qi, leading eighty thousand celestial beings. The immortal men board iron ships to receive Daoists who possess scriptures. Children, await this."

"That passage you just read about 'Great Ming'—the original actually says 'Great Jin.'"

"You've been altering Daoist classics!" He Ying suddenly understood. This Zhang Yingchen was formidable! To have thought of this approach—only someone extremely familiar with Daoist texts, having done deep research, could manage it. He couldn't help but regard this doctor with new respect.

"Exactly. What I'm promoting is New Daoism, not continuing the old system." Zhang Yingchen nodded. "I plan to use the *Quandao Zhenji* (Comprehensive Explanation of the True Doctrine), compiled based on *Laozi* with Xiang'er commentary and *Taiping Jing*, as the sole designated text for Lingao Daoism clergy."

"Can such drastic revisions really work?" He Ying expressed skepticism. "Though Daoism here in Lingao is weak, across the nation it remains a powerful presence. And this scripture surely isn't unique—if you alter it so directly, won't you be exposed?"

"You needn't worry about that. Doctrinal disputes exist everywhere; it depends on who gains the upper hand." Zhang Yingchen was unconcerned, apparently confident.

"Doctrine aside, the Catholic Church has already established a foothold. How would a newly emerged church coexist? Won't that create great confusion in faith?"

"The method of reconciliation is for the two new religions to run parallel, mutually recognizing each other as sibling faiths while checking each other. My Daoism template uses the messianic and earthly divine kingdom theory from the Taiping Dao branch of Daoism, which is practically identical to Christianity's Thousand-Year Kingdom of Christ concept." Zhang Yingchen said. "There's much that can be done with this, leaving room for future development. If we follow Dean Wu's approach—a single religion with extremely inflated divine authority—the future influence on the transmigrator state would only exceed the Yuan Elder Council. This potential consequence must be guarded against."

He Ying nodded. This was also what had worried him recently. Now the other party's thinking was clear and organized; this proposal had potential.

"Tell me about your specific approach."

"First, Daoism's ultimate faith is the Dao—as it says, 'There was something formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth.' Philosophically and theologically, this is incomparably superior to Christianity's Trinity doctrine."

He Ying thought this opening was predictable—one typically begins by denigrating competitors.

"Second, the Daoist worldview derives from Dao-Qi theory. From ghosts and gods and stars above, to mortals and ants below, all are transformations of primordial *qi*."

"The *qi* of qigong?"

"No, it's *qi*," Zhang Yingchen dipped his finger in tea and wrote the character on the table. "*Qi* is prenatal *qi*; *qi* is postnatal *qi*. The two are completely different."

He continued explaining: the so-called *qi* is a metaphysical mysterious energy, different from ordinary *qi*.

"In our Chinese medicine theory, it refers to the most fundamental energy that constitutes the human body and maintains life activities, and it also has physiological function meanings. In Chinese medicine terminology, *qi* combined with different words expresses various meanings, such as the *qi* of the five viscera, the *qi* of the six bowels, the *qi* of the meridians, and so forth. And an important concept in Daoism is 'One *Qi* Transforms into Three Purities.'"

"I see." He Ying suddenly thought of "psychic energy" for some reason. Did the concept of warp energy and such plagiarize Chinese Daoist ideas? Then thinking of the Tau's "Dao" and "Theory of Harmony," He Ying increasingly felt this way.

Zhang Yingchen didn't know Director He had such associations. He continued explaining this most crucial concept in his religious system:

"Note, it's 'One *Qi*,' not 'one *qi*.'" Zhang Yingchen emphasized. "Based on these two points, we can carry out our reforms."

His approach was to start from the root: using traditional "Dao-Qi theory" as the foundation and natural deism as a reference point, completely discarding the Daoist ghost and god system represented by "Three Purities and Four Emperors," explaining all ghosts and gods as manifestations of "Dao-Qi" at various levels.

Second, to position Laozi as the sect founder rather than supreme deity—leaving expandable space for the supreme deity's final form.

Third, toward all ghosts and gods—including the Daoist pantheon as well as deities from other religions such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Shinto—to adopt the Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's attitude under Dao-Qi theory guidance. These deities were merely manifestations of Dao-Qi at different levels.

"The Japanese Shinto system has a concept of '*gongen*' [manifestation] that reconciled contradictions between Buddhism and Shinto, creating de facto 'dual-track' religious belief in Japan.

"Our goal is to completely integrate these beliefs into the Lingao new religious system, making them exist like saints within Christianity.

"Of course, in such integration, old local licentious cults must be attacked. Licentious cult beliefs are to be eliminated, then positive local immortal beliefs reformed and converted.

"For example, Mazu and Baosheng Dadi, local deities with deep influence in Fujian—New Daoism must prioritize absorbing them, making them objects of New Daoism devotion. At the same time, we must reform the problem of local deity worship being practically detached from Daoist organization.

Zhang Yingchen grew more enthusiastic as he talked.

"Let's set doctrine aside. How does your New Daoism plan to conduct outreach? To what extent can such outreach promote the transmigrator collective's rule?" He Ying interrupted his theological discourse.

"Director He truly goes straight to the core issue." Zhang Yingchen smoothly offered a compliment. He indicated: when proselytizing to ordinary believers, the emphasis would be on "doing good," "obeying the law," and "supporting the Lingao regime," combined with the "Seed People of the Four Heavens" doctrine. The goal was to make people believe they were chosen seed people of the True Sovereign. Simultaneously, based on prophecies of "the True Sovereign descending to the world" in Daoist scriptures like *Taiping Jing* and *Dongyuan Shenzhou Jing*, they would promote the legitimacy of the Lingao regime.

"Of course, how to conduct outreach still needs coordination with propaganda department colleagues. That way they can complement each other," he said. "I only have some rough ideas right now, not very mature, so I won't presume to share them yet. My first step is to establish New Daoism's image. Religious personnel must have distinctive markers to clarify their identity and demonstrate the religion's presence."

He Ying nodded and again sized up this tall doctor.

"How long have you been researching these materials?"

"Not long. I audited some Daoist studies courses in college. Consider it a personal hobby. I also dabble in all religious forms. I prepared it for killing time during boredom—never expected to actually use it."

Zhang Yingchen shrugged indifferently, picked up the teapot beside him, and refilled He Ying's cup.

"In any case, New Daoism's vestments are the first propaganda weapon. We must give the public an intuitive recognition, distinguishing New Daoism from old Daoism. Therefore, I selected this Tang-style right-lapel narrow-sleeved turnover-collar foreign-style garment as the template and had the clothing factory colleagues design this set of general clergy uniforms."

Saying this, Zhang Yingchen pulled over a wicker suitcase, took out two gray-blue turnover-collar foreign-style robes with military uniform styling, and hung them on a clothes rack.

"To distinguish male and female clergy, the factory colleagues referenced Army uniform regulations and sewed red armbands on the right sleeve. The *qian* trigram armband represents male clergy; the *kun* trigram armband represents female clergy—simple and clear."

A false believer—a false believer with considerable ability and religious aptitude. Looking at the military-style turnover-collar clerical robes before him, He Ying mentally labeled the man. Fundamentally, he was like Wu Shimang—a dedicated professional religious huckster. The difference was he covered his burning ambition with a rich layer of doctrinal theology, while Dean Wu simply charged in bare-chested.

He talked at length, including theological points, scripture compilation, doctrinal modifications, organizational management models, personnel training, and more. He Ying was secretly amazed. This person had obviously been scheming for a long time. This material couldn't have been produced without months of repeated consideration and revision; the so-called "killing time when bored" was obviously deliberate understatement.

"Of course, establishing the Daoism Council still requires guidance from leadership and colleagues. Working alone behind closed doors won't do—there's inevitably some wishful thinking involved. These doctrines, precepts, rituals, vestments, and management are just my personal rough ideas, all requiring everyone's supervision and control." He concluded his exposition in the manner of a standard-issue statement.

As he said this, Zhang Yingchen maintained his gentle smile, but He Ying felt he needed to reassess this doctor.

"Your approach rather resembles the relationship between Protestantism and old Catholicism."

"Indeed, that meaning is included." Zhang Yingchen nodded. "New wine must go into old bottles. The final product is an entirely new religious system—note, a system, not a single dominant power. A church capable of influencing all of society is dangerous to secular authority." He said, "I believe we should remind every Elder engaged in religious activities: no matter what religion, religion is merely a propaganda and stability-maintenance tool serving the Lingao regime. Beyond that, it's nothing."

"This is the inevitable contradiction between secular power and religious organizations." He Ying pondered for a moment, then suddenly raised a new concept:

"Since a state religion will inevitably develop the desire to meddle in secular society, and the two are irreconcilable, what about complete integration of church and state? Like England, for example—the monarch is the church leader." He continued, "Your five hundred immortal saints—doesn't that mean every Elder is a 'god' within this system?"

"Integration of church and state has a problem: England has a king as natural leader of the church. Who do we have? All five hundred are archangels—should Director Wen be Great Archangel Commander? Would you agree?" Zhang Yingchen asked and answered himself. "Obviously you wouldn't agree. No matter who became this Great Archangel Commander, nobody would agree. The danger in this is something everyone can see."

"Organize your proposal and I'll report it to the Executive Committee," He Ying said. "This matter will probably require a hearing at the Yuan Elder Council Standing Committee. Ideological matters are no small thing."

"A hearing is no problem. I trust the Elders will fully grasp my intent." Zhang Yingchen was quite confident—after all, Daoism was a native Chinese product, holding a very different place in Elders' minds.
