# Chapter 732 - The Guns of Bai'etan

The sun rose over Bai'etan.

Wen Desi stood on the poop deck of the Special Service Boat, hands clasped behind his back. A layer of golden morning light enveloped him, making him radiate an almost theatrical glow. Indigenous naval officers and sailors stood nearby in respectful silence.

Wen Desi gazed at Guangzhou, filled with the heroic sentiment of the old poet: *"Gazing at the Wu hook, patting all the railings, no one understands the intent of the climber."*

"Back in the place where we fought," he whispered.

He thought of the days when he, Wang Luobin, and Xiao Zishan had traveled back and forth through the wormhole to raise initial funds—the scene of fleeing in embarrassment from this very Bai'etan years ago, rescued by Ran Yao and others wielding nothing but a few small-caliber rifles and shotguns. The memory remained vivid.

Now he led a fleet here. The lives and property of the entire city's officials and populace depended on his whim. He felt visibly smug.

"Thinking back to when this old master's crew first opened for business, with only a dozen people and seven or eight guns..." Wen Desi suddenly hummed a line from Peking Opera—a form he wasn't actually familiar with. But nothing expressed his mood better than these particular lyrics.

---

Chen Haiyang stood on the lower deck. Not wishing to disturb Wen Desi's retrospection, he hadn't stepped forward.

Unlike the Chairman's emotional nostalgia, his own mind was occupied with practical matters of how to proceed.

The battle had reached a stage that transcended military scope—it had become a political war. The Task Force hadn't fought its way to Guangzhou to capture this major East Asian city. The goal was to force the other side to sue for peace. Finding the precise balance—applying sufficient pressure to achieve their objectives without pushing the opponent to desperate measures, to "break the fishnet" in a final reckless act—required extremely accurate calibration.

"General Wen," Chen Haiyang called out when he saw the Chairman's nostalgia fading. "How do you think we should proceed?"

The Senate had no intention of occupying Guangzhou. What they wanted was reopened trade—continued access to manpower, material resources, and markets from Guangdong. For this purpose, they couldn't afford to frighten away the wealthy merchants. According to Intelligence Bureau reports, many had already fled.

If they actually conquered Guangzhou, the entire Pearl River Delta would become a "war zone." If merchants dared not come, occupying the city would be pointless.

Wen Desi and Chen Haiyang had racked their brains throughout the campaign, searching for a way to make a dramatic impression without causing the Guangdong government to slam the door on negotiations entirely.

Now that warships were anchored at Bai'etan, peace talks had to begin immediately. Though the Pearl River Expedition had achieved remarkable results, if it failed to produce a peace agreement, it would be a complete strategic failure.

Chen Haiyang suggested: "Should we immediately send someone into Guangzhou with a diplomatic note, demanding that city officials come out to negotiate?"

"No, we can't do formal notes." Wen Desi shook his head emphatically. "Wouldn't that establish a 'Two-Nation Theory'? Li Fengjie wouldn't dare accept such a document if you beat him to death. We can only transmit messages through private contact. Officials have their own ways of dealing with their superiors; we must find a suitable channel quickly."

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau had Lin Baiguang and others lurking in Guangzhou, so the Task Force received daily telegrams forwarded from Lingao about the situation inside the city.

"Li Fengjie has tried to contact Gao Ju several times, but Gao Ju keeps refusing," Wen Desi observed. "I think we should ask the Intelligence Bureau to approach Gao Ju and let him serve as the intermediary. Gao Ju has always been the agent for Australian goods—he can't shed that skin. It's entirely reasonable for him to come forward."

"Let's fire a few blank shots first to get their attention," Chen Haiyang said. "I don't believe the lord bureaucrats in that city can keep playing deaf and dumb."

---

Gao Ju had closed his doors to all guests.

Whoever came calling received the same reply: "Not at home."

This wasn't putting on airs—his position had become genuinely awkward. He found it difficult to face any party.

After Guo Yi and the other Purple Enterprise managers fled and the Australian properties were seized, Gao Ju felt he had suffered a significant loss of face. He had written an unhappy letter reporting the events to Eunuch Yang. Though the eunuch held little sway in the palace these days, a centipede doesn't topple even when dead—his connections remained extensive. If Yang caught an opportunity, he might severely damage the Tian family's standing.

After the Chengmai defeat, some local gentry and officials had secretly lobbied Gao Ju, hoping he would come forward to negotiate peace. But still resentful at the government for causing him to lose face and credit over the Purple properties—and uncertain of the political depths behind this affair—he dared not agree casually.

He simply continued playing "not at home," hiding in his mansion and watching developments unfold.

Though he remained housebound, his intelligence on outside events was exceptionally well-informed. He knew every detail of the Task Force's "deeds" in the Pearl River, which both alarmed and delighted him.

The alarm came from the Australians' formidable power—defeating the suppression forces and chasing government troops all the way into the inland rivers, pointing their swords straight at Guangzhou. If a major battle erupted outside the city walls, this merchant's "paradise" would be ruined.

The delight came from having avoided committing to the wrong side in this "Bandit Extermination" affair. Whether dealing with the government or the Australians, he had managed passably. With the Australians making their comeback, the Gao family could continue profiting from Australian goods.

As the Australian advance gathered momentum, Gao Ju fully understood their intention: they meant to "force peace through war."

Since they sought "peace," there needed to be a contact channel. And Gao Ju believed no one in Guangdong was better suited to serve as that channel than himself. Whether the government or the Australians, if either wanted to negotiate, they would have to find him to mediate.

So for the past month, he had resumed "at home" status—though he saw few guests and said little. He was "waiting for the right price," preparing to extract concessions from both the government and local gentry. And if possible, from the Australians too.

---

Gao Ju watched every development closely.

When the Australian fleet pressed closer and the city panicked—wealthy families fleeing in droves—he remained unmoved. He sensed the Australians wouldn't actually attack Guangzhou. At most, they would posture outside the walls.

He had decided to wait until government representatives came begging him to negotiate before showing his hand. Of course, they would first have to agree to his series of conditions. He wanted not merely to regain face for himself but also for the Australians—and naturally, to vent his long-simmering anger.

Whenever he recalled that young upstart Tian Da's rude, arrogant manner, Master Gao's rage refused to subside.

---

That morning, having just risen and finished breakfast alone, Gao Ju went to his courtyard to enjoy his birds.

He was fond of raising exotic fowl. Unlike the Northern style that emphasized "sound," his aesthetic prioritized beauty and colorful plumage. He had collected many rare specimens from Western lands—birds unseen elsewhere in China—hanging them in cages beneath the eaves. The display was colorful and beautiful.

Amidst this harmonious scene of man and bird enjoying each other's company, rumbling cannon fire suddenly echoed from beyond the walls. Several small birds crashed about frantically in their cages, terrified.

Gao Ju frowned, turning toward the sound—it came from the direction of Bai'etan.

Apart from flower boats and restaurants, where would heavy guns come from in Bai'etan? Could the Australians have arrived?

While he pondered this, a servant hurried in to report: "Master, the Australian fleet has arrived at Bai'etan! They're firing blank shots."

"Let them fire." Gao Ju's expression remained indifferent. This was merely knocking on the mountain to startle the tiger.

"Master," the servant said hesitantly, "Young Master Tian is here to visit..."

"Which Master Tian?"

"Tian Da—"

Gao Ju snorted. "Not home." He couldn't be bothered with that despicable creature.

"He refuses to leave. He insists on seeing you once." The servant, having accepted his customary bribe, continued to plead: "He says he has a great fortune to offer the Master."

"Not seeing him," Gao Ju said flatly. Then he regarded the servant with a mocking smile. "How much silver did you take from him?"

"This lowly one didn't—" The servant's face went pale as he rushed to deny it.

"Go to the accounting room. Say I said so: reward you with eight taels of silver. Throw Tian Da's four taels back in his face."

"Lowly one dares not, dares not!" The servant was frightened out of his wits, dropping to his knees and kowtowing. "Lowly one knows his mistake..."

"Go."

Gao Ju didn't know precisely why Tian Da insisted on seeing him, but he could guess.

Tian Da had failed completely in his attempt to swallow the Purple properties in Guangzhou. First, Manager Guo and the others had vanished under mysterious circumstances. That was manageable—Tian Da could at least claim the remaining real estate—but the government had dragged its feet on the transfer. When news of the Chengmai disaster arrived, even outsiders could see that Tian Da's hopes were finished.

Tian Da had been in Guangzhou for nearly a year. He had boasted to his patron that he could secure the Purple Enterprise's submission. Now he had nothing to show.

Returning to report empty-handed, he likely couldn't even keep his position as a Tian family servant. Recently he had been collecting various Australian goods and curiosities everywhere—probably hoping for some excuse to present when he returned north.

---

Tian Da received a closed-door rebuff at the Gao mansion.

The gatekeeper who had accepted his silver with smiles and promises came back with a cold face, threw the silver back at him, said "Not at home," and spoke not another word before disappearing inside.

Tian Da cursed under his breath: "Damn it all, everyone's grown bold!"

Guangzhou City had become truly insufferable. These officials and gentry flipped faces faster than pages in a book. Once, no one dared refuse his visits; at worst, they would come out to greet him and present gifts of tens of taels.

Now? No one with any standing would see him. And those who did spoke rudely, let alone offering gifts.

The Purple Enterprise was hopeless. When yamen runners had seized the property after the Australians fled, Tian Da hadn't needed to expend much effort to gain access for a "tour."

The result had disappointed him deeply. Though goods and equipment remained, the runners had looted everything valuable. Beyond common tools, only mysterious Australian machines remained—and their delicate brass and glass components had either been stolen or ruined by rough handling during the seizure. Without Australian craftsmen to service them, they were useless.

Even if these businesses had fallen into his hands, what could he do with them? Who had the skill to revive them? Everything they sold was either imported Australian goods or manufactured using Australian secret formulas. No one in Guangzhou knew how to make that sweet carbonated water that numbed the tongue with bubbles. Or the ice blocks available on demand even in summer...

"Gao Ju, you damned old fox." Tian Da cursed as he departed.

He had hoped to extort a few rare Australian goods from Gao Ju—since his scheme to seize the Purple Tower had collapsed, he needed *something* to bring back. With the bandits pressing so close, Tian Da felt deeply uneasy. He had long contemplated returning north.

But Gao Ju had proven impervious to both soft and hard tactics, ignoring him completely. Tian Da had particularly wanted that brilliant Australian oil lamp to present at the palace. But when the man wouldn't even grant him an audience, Tian Da felt utterly humiliated.

"Go to the Liu family," he instructed his sedan-chair bearers.

He decided to visit the Liu merchant family. They had no political backing and conducted their trade northward; reportedly they possessed several rare Australian treasures. This family had deep ties with the Australians; they wouldn't dare refuse him.

After securing what he needed, he would leave Guangzhou immediately. He'd heard the guns at Bai'etan too. While the gates were still open, he had to flee. Falling into Australian hands would mean no good end.

---

As his sedan chair made its way through the streets, Tian Da calculated how to squeeze the Liu family into compliance.

Then someone in the crowd suddenly shouted: "Bull gone mad! Run!"

Just as Tian Da was about to peer out, the sedan chair smashed to the ground with a violent crash, nearly throwing him out the door.

"You dogs!" Tian Da bellowed. "Can't even carry a chair prop—"

The bearers had fled.

As Tian Da stuck his head out the window, he saw a massive water buffalo—nostrils flaring, breath heaving—charging straight at the sedan with its two great curved horns.

Tian Da screamed and collapsed back inside.

A crisp *crack*—the unmistakable sound of bone shattering—was the last thing Tian Da heard on earth.

---

His death caused not a ripple in Guangzhou—except among those who knew of his enmity with the Australians.

Those who had flattered him felt guilty. Those who had suffered from him cheered secretly. Gao Ju, upon hearing the news, merely smiled slightly.

---

While the city staged its own small drama, the Task Force outside was far from idle.

The Fubo Army landed at Bai'etan, commandeering several restaurants as headquarters and senior officer quarters. They built a temporary naval pier on the trestles where flower boats had once docked.

Many rocket launchers and Hale Rockets were unloaded and set up outside the city. If the officials inside lacked urgency for peace, Wen Desi was prepared to remind them with fire.

To facilitate shelling Guangzhou from any direction, all Bombardment Boats were temporarily modified—removing 280mm mortars and installing rocket launchers. This allowed them to maneuver along Bai'etan and the inland waterways, striking the city from any angle.

Over three hundred Hale rockets had been brought from Hong Kong. Wen Desi decided to give Li Fengjie three days. No response meant a spectacular fireworks display.

Some Senators had suggested using their intelligence network inside the city to send contacts to ask Gao Ju to propose peace to Li Fengjie.

"It's better if peace is proposed by the other side first," Wen Desi replied. "Besides, if we approach Gao Ju, he might grow arrogant and later claim credit to demand greater benefits from us. Let's wait a few days and observe their reaction."

---

To prevent attack from both front and rear, Chen Haiyang ordered a mixed battalion of Marines and sailors with artillery to clear government defenders from Phoenix Hill in the west and Dongsheng Temple in the east.

The enemy was expelled in less than a day. Defenders at both positions fled without serious fighting, leaving ninety corpses and over two hundred assorted obsolete guns. Fubo Army casualties totaled ten, with three killed.

The fall of Phoenix Hill and Dongsheng Temple made Guangzhou's defensive situation even more desperate.

Li Fengjie had no choice. He finally resolved to pursue the peace negotiations he had so long hesitated over.

---

He judged that Inspector Gao Shunqin represented the greatest obstacle. If the man learned of peace talks, he would vehemently oppose them—perhaps even impeach Li Fengjie immediately. As a Censor, he had the authority to include "hearsay" in his memorials. If public opinion in the capital turned, Li Fengjie would face catastrophe.

After careful consideration, he decided not to come forward personally.

He split the task into two tracks: Guangzhou Prefect Yu Baocun would handle local matters directly. Since the Prefect bore primary responsibility for defending his jurisdiction, he couldn't dare refuse.

The other track would proceed through Li Luoyou in Macau. Macau was Portuguese territory; talks there could be frank. Matters that could only be hinted at before Prefect Yu could be discussed openly with Li Luoyou.

For now, the priority was for Yu Baocun and Gao Ju to persuade the Australians to withdraw quickly. Other conditions could be discussed later, in Macau. The longer Australian warships remained, the harder it became to explain to the Court.

---

Yu Baocun went to the Governor's Yamen for a secret midnight meeting.

Early the next morning, he personally took a sedan chair to visit Gao Ju.

"Is this the Governor's intent?" Gao Ju asked, after hearing Yu Baocun's request that he negotiate the "Bandit" withdrawal.

"Elder Gao is wise—must this student speak it plainly?" Yu Baocun smiled bitterly. "Defending the soil is a duty; we are all involuntary participants. This matter relies heavily on Elder Gao."

"Where does the Old Ancestor speak from?" Gao Ju affected indifference. "Gao is but a merchant. I fear my ability is insufficient."

Yu Baocun cursed the old man privately for his posturing—he was obviously maneuvering for an exorbitant price. But needing his help, the Prefect signaled that as long as Gao came forward, everything was negotiable.
