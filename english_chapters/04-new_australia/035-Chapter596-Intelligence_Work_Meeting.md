# Chapter 596 - Intelligence Work Meeting

Guo Yi and others, are they merchants or spies? Their identity and affiliation have never been clarified. But obviously, their merchant component is larger. Whether it's the Guangzhou Station or Leizhou Station, their main task is to sell goods, import materials and manpower for the Transmigration Group. Engaging in intelligence is just a side matter.

As for the Leizhou Station, it not only involves sales and imports but also involves sugar making and liquor making of the light industry department, involves sugarcane improvement planting of the agricultural department, and involves the agricultural cooperative jointly promoted by the Tiandihui and Delung.

"...These two stations, other departments have intervened much deeper than us. For us to directly command them, I'm afraid it cannot be done."

Correct, Jiang Shan thought. The Guangzhou and Leizhou systems are already used to their unique status as political-economic-intelligence complexes. Bringing these two stations under the Intelligence Bureau's system is completely delusional—neither the Executive Committee nor the Senate would agree. If he were to directly demand these belong to us and those belong to us, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, this freshly baked yamen, would only get a nose full of ash.

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau sounds prominent, but actually, it is a thorough shell company. Before having sufficient strength, no one will buy its account.

"We must rely on the organization, connections, and work of the overseas stations," Jiang Shan said. "Of course, we can start anew, re-dispatching less conspicuous intelligence personnel to the mainland. But—"

"But the Executive Committee won't approve, right?" Wang Ding said. "You know the Executive Committee's meaning as well as I do; they don't like waste. Every Elder is a treasury of knowledge and skills, even the so-called loser otakus. As for dispatching indigenous intelligence agents, I'm not clear how many people are available to send."

Jiang Shan thought, he had absolutely no concept of how much foundation the intelligence system had. He could only wait until all transferred materials aimed to arrive were reviewed.

That day, the two spent a day and a night reading through all the transferred materials. Materials transferred from various departments were varied. Fortunately, the quantity wasn't too large. The most valuable, of course, were the materials of the former Enemy Work Department transferred from the General Bureau of Political Security. In the past, the small amount of intelligence work was mostly operated by the PSB Enemy Work Department.

"Lin Baiguang has established a base in Qiongzhou—this probably counts as a pure intelligence station." Jiang Shan said.

Lin Baiguang's station in Qiongzhou, the Wanfeng Grain Trust, not only had five indigenous intelligence agents but he also developed a local intelligence network headed by Ma Benyuan. Simultaneously, he did a large amount of work assisting the production and external transport of the Jiazi Coal Mine. It could be called outstanding achievements.

Even the grain trust's business status was not bad. According to the financial statements he submitted, Wanfeng Grain Trust's profits were sufficient to maintain the operation of the intelligence station itself, and even had a small surplus.

"If Lin Baiguang is willing to come back to serve, he is more than qualified to be the Director of the Third Division." Jiang Shan commented.

Wang Ding thought, if he were willing to come back to serve, would it still be your turn to be the Foreign Intelligence Bureau Director? But he didn't say this out. He said: "There's also the Monk Zou Temple in Leizhou, also a professional intelligence station." Chen Tianxiong specifically requested to rebuild this temple as an intelligence station back then. His activities in Leizhou now were basically based in this place.

"I think we should recall everyone and hold a work meeting." Jiang Shan pondered and said, "Including representatives from Guangzhou and Leizhou. This is firstly a sign of respect to them, and secondly, we will have many places to coordinate with these locations in the future. Not talking clearly face-to-face might cause problems."

"Mm, actually certain positions you can keep for dispatched personnel—they don't necessarily have to return to serve—Guo Yi can be the Director of the First Division, specifically Lin Baiguang can totally be the Director of the Third Division, no need to select from Elders in Lingao..."

"You are granting titles and making wishes." Jiang Shan joked, "Once they become Division Directors, they can't help but be serious, right?"

"Yes, the county magistrate is not as good as the current in-charge! One always cares a bit more about matters within one's own duty. Besides, many jobs are better understood by people on the front line. What use is it to rush-promote a few people reading spy novels to be Division Directors? Can front-line staff be convinced?"

"The words are not wrong, but they are all on the front line, afraid they can't do what a Division Director should do—being a leader requires doing a lot of administrative work." Jiang Shan said, "Letting Guo Yi be the First Division Director, he would probably be happy, and the Executive Committee might not object. But later when the Intelligence Bureau arranges manpower to enter Great Ming to carry out work, how to discuss and communicate with him? The process is too complex."

"Mm." Wang Ding thought he overlooked this point. He denied his idea not without regret, "Seems this won't work."

"The most ideal state should be transferring front-line personnel back to serve as Division Directors, and dispatching new intelligence personnel out." Jiang Shan said, "This way the leaders have experience, and newcomers can also go to the front line to train."

"I'm afraid that's impossible right now."

Jiang Shan also knew this was probably impossible. Commercial relationships and personal connections in ancient society were very tight. Transferring one of Guo Yi and the others away meant that many commercial and social connections in Guangzhou would be interrupted. This was not the same path as casually changing executives in modern large corporations.

"We better hold an intelligence work meeting first. Ideally communicate with everyone." Jiang Shan made up his mind, "I also want to go around various departments first to understand the specific situation."

"Alright. Then what do I do?" Wang Ding asked.

"You, just go visit the people on this list first, chat casually with them," Jiang Shan said. "They are all Elders who volunteered for intelligence work. You worked in a powerful department in the past; you always have the skill to judge people. See if they really want to do this invisible profession or just want to be Great Ming 007s."

"Good. I'll go in a while." Wang Ding asked, "Don't want the latter, right?"

"No, the latter is also acceptable—at least they have enough enthusiasm." Jiang Shan said, "The premise is I can know how much manpower and budget I can get."

The first intelligence work meeting convened by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau was held in Bopu. The participating institutions included: Ministry of Commerce, Religious Affairs Office and heads of "Two Religions," Li and Miao Affairs Office, General Bureau of Political Security, and personnel from two overseas stations: the representative from Guangzhou was Zhang Xin, the representative from Leizhou was Chen Tianxiong. Lin Baiguang from Qiongzhou also came back to attend the meeting.

This meeting was held in Bopu—right in the private villa Wu De built himself. After the Second Plenary Session, to avoid inquiries from Elders on this issue, he turned over the villa's property rights to the General Office. Because this place was both quiet and hidden, and not as conspicuous as in Bairen City, it became a good place for holding small-scale secret meetings.

Regarding intelligence work issues, the Executive Committee had long believed a large-scale integration and cleanup was needed. First was to eliminate the Political Security Department's interference in the intelligence system, second was to integrate the existing systems to avoid the situation of policies coming from multiple doors.

Modern people are very sensitive to intelligence. Almost every department wants to run its own intelligence organization or simply act as an intelligence organization itself. Even a department like the Agricultural Committee was submitting reports wanting to organize a Red Flower Society within the Tiandihui system—an institution acting as peddlers roaming the countryside while conducting intelligence collection and propaganda agitation. The General Staff was also contemplating establishing a General Staff Intelligence Bureau...

This fanatical sentiment of everyone engaging in intelligence must be corrected. The Foreign Intelligence Bureau was exactly a basin of cold water poured by the Executive Committee onto the heads of various departments.

In this intelligence meeting, it was clarified that external intelligence collection is the responsibility of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. All external intelligence activities must be planned and filed with the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. Departments are not allowed to conduct external intelligence activities without reporting. At the same time, it was reiterated that no department is allowed to establish its own intelligence organization or compile specialized personnel without authorization.

Under the premise of unified command of intelligence work, it was stipulated that all intelligence consolidation and analysis work is responsible by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. Intelligence collected by various places must first be submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, which will conduct intelligence consolidation and analysis, then distribute.

Intelligence analysis is the main highlight of intelligence work, or even the critical work. In the past, intelligence collected by various departments themselves, except for the General Bureau of Political Security, was mostly copied up directly without analysis. The targets of copying were generally the Executive Committee and "potentially useful departments." The latter is a vague concept. For example, the daily market retail price telegram collected by Guangzhou Station—recipients were all Executive Committee. After the Executive Committee received it, the copy targets of this intelligence became vague: Ministry of Commerce, Foreign Trade Company, Cooperative, even Agricultural Committee and Civil Affairs Committee theoretically might all need it.

Out of consideration for responsibility, the General Office copied a portion to all potentially needy departments. Not only wasteful but also distracting the energy of receiving departments—these intelligence items were not refined, analyzed, or consolidated, provided to various departments completely in the form of raw materials—intelligence judgment and interpretation became the business of various departments themselves. Supervisors had to spend a lot of time reading and determining if this thing was useful to themselves. Some were too lazy to ask and just filed it directly.

According to Wang Ding's plan, now all intelligence, after preliminary consolidation and analysis in the Analysis Division, would be categorized and compiled according to timeliness and content. Each department submits the intelligence categories they need to the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, and the Foreign Intelligence Bureau distributes to various departments according to security levels. As for urgent and major intelligence, it is sent directly to the Executive Committee member in charge of that affair and the counterpart department to ensure a reaction within the fastest timeframe.

Secondly is to establish a shared Master Intelligence Database. All collected intelligence materials are compiled into volumes by category and date, specially stored in the database. When departments have needs, they can query directly according to their department's security level. Instead of archiving separately in the past, turning into a pile of dead materials that only interested people would consult.

In the division of affairs: Li and Miao affairs intelligence is classified as "Internal Affairs" category. The Foreign Intelligence Bureau no longer intervenes in the collection and organization of intelligence in this aspect. This intelligence affair is led by the Li and Miao Affairs Office, assisted by the General Bureau of Political Security and Religious Affairs Office.

A key link in foreign intelligence work: the affiliation of overseas stations was clarified at the meeting—overseas stations are directly under the Colonial and Trade Department—in the past, the identity of overseas stations was always unclear, some counted in the intelligence port, some in the commerce port, some in the Planning Agency. Ultimately, the things they handled were many and mixed, and had irreplaceable importance. Now that affiliation is clarified, coordination among all parties becomes easier.

The meeting made a decision that overseas stations are obliged to support various activities of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. In order for the Foreign Intelligence Bureau to effectively command overseas stations, all overseas station heads must concurrently serve as the Intelligence Station Head of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, forming a de facto hierarchical affiliation with the Foreign Intelligence Bureau Director.

This way, Guo Yi of Guangzhou Station and Wen Tong of Leizhou Station became Intelligence Station Heads of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. In the future, every established overseas station has the obligation to collect local intelligence and support Foreign Intelligence Bureau activities. Of course, in actual work, they can hand over specific intelligence affairs to other Elders in the station to be responsible.

Besides overseas stations, the Religious Affairs Office was also designated as a "Key Assistance Unit" of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. Especially Zhang Yuchen's "New Taoism," all parties believed it had huge intelligence infiltration value. Especially Chen Tianxiong, he mentioned Monk Zou Temple in Xuwen was very suitable territory for "New Taoism" to use as a base, serving as both a missionary base and an intelligence station.

Zhang Yuchen, just returned from Sanya Development Zone tanned dark, was very enthusiastic about this proposal. He proposed that "New Taoism" prepare to cooperate closely with the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. He was willing to contribute the graduates of the "Taoist Student Training Class" currently being prepared by "New Taoism" for dual training in mission and intelligence. This way, once Taoist students graduate and expand to the mainland, they will become dual vanguards of ideology and intelligence work.

"Your Taoist Student Training Class doesn't have a single person, yet how many people have you contributed to?" Religious Affairs Office Director He Ying sneered, "A while ago contributed to Li and Miao Affairs, then to PSB for internal security, now to Foreign Intelligence Bureau."

"I am merely pointing out how big a role 'New Taoism' might play in our cause," Zhang Yuchen did not change his expression. "As for the source of Taoist students, I have submitted reports many times." The implication was that failing to play a role was mainly due to not giving him manpower.

Wu Shimang saw his Lingao Church unattended, hurriedly came out to express that although Lingao Church was subject to certain restrictions in missionary work in mainland China, the faith of "Catholicism" could enable them to play a greater role in activities targeting Europeans. Moreover, by comparison, Lingao Church already mastered a batch of sufficiently devout believers available for use. Compared to "New Taoism" which could only talk empty words about potential roles, Lingao Church belonged to those immediately able to "enter battle."

"Our believers are very devout, yes, very devout," Wu Shimang said. "They sincerely welcome martyrdom, so letting them execute any task doesn't require considering consequences."

"What task is good for your nuns and grannies to execute?" Zhang Yingchen put on a contemplative look.

A burst of laughter immediately erupted at the conference table. Wu Shimang was not embarrassed, arguing strongly: "What's wrong with nuns and grannies? Such elderly people, going anywhere won't attract attention—these are very good intelligence personnel!"

"I think forget it, don't torment the elderly in the convent." He Ying said, "People have served your Lingao Church enough, let them spend their remaining years in peace."

"There are also quite a few young devout believers." Wu Shimang was eager to express the work he did in this area, "I believe sending out devout indigenous people with firm faith to serve as intelligence collection work is very suitable—at least they won't betray."

Jiang Shan felt using religion for intelligence collection was a good idea, immediately expressing "sincere thanks" for the support of the Religious Affairs Office.

After the Bopu Intelligence Work Meeting ended, Chen Tianxiong and Lin Baiguang were invited to the Foreign Intelligence Bureau to hold a small meeting with Jiang Shan and others.

These two people counted as the basic intelligence personnel of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau outside. Jiang Shan attached great importance to them and was very polite in conversation. First was inviting Lin Baiguang back to serve as the Third Division Director or Office Director position.

"No, I better work as an external special agent." Lin Baiguang shook his head without politeness, "I don't like agency work. Want to do some practical things outside."

"Alright." Jiang Shan knew this kind of person was hard to persuade easily; persuading more would lose his own status. "I want to hear your views and suggestions on this agency's work."

Lin Baiguang smiled: "Actually no views, first is people, must add people in large quantities."

"I also feel manpower is too scarce," Jiang Shan nodded. "But now Elders are scarce resources..."

"I'm not talking about Elders," Lin Baiguang shook his head. "As you said, Elders are scarce resources; how can we casually throw them onto the mainland to serve in grassroots intelligence work? Any death is a major loss. I'm talking about indigenous intelligence personnel."

Lin Baiguang reminded Jiang Shan that several terms of intelligence personnel training classes were held in the past, but numbers were small and simply not enough. Personnel training must be grasped tightly.

"Indigenous intelligence personnel lack experience and need to be given more opportunities for practice. I suggest increasing manpower investment in Qiongshan County. Newly trained intelligence personnel can all be sent to me." Lin Baiguang said.

"Oh?" Jiang Shan thought what does this mean? Although Qiongshan County is the attached county of Qiongzhou Prefecture, it is after all just a county seat on Hainan Island. In the eyes of the Executive Committee, it is just an apple temporarily unpicked. If not for the existence of Jiazi Coal Mine, there was no need to invest too much intelligence power here at all.

"Before I explain, let me first discuss our activity situation in Qiongshan County."

He first reported his work in Qiongshan County.

Wanfeng Grain Trust's activities, work on the Hai family, Ma Benyuan's local intelligence network...

"...Qiongshan County, this place, we have already made great progress now." Lin Baiguang said, "The bureaucratic institutions of the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture are almost like a sieve."
