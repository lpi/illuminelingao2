# Chapter 733 - Capturing Wuchong

Thinking of how his master used to wipe his nose with his hand, wipe it on his apron, and continue cutting vegetables, Fu Ji felt these were two different worlds.

Poultry was butchered into different parts according to Meat Processing Plant standards, refrigerated, then processed into food for the troops. This method was primarily for hygiene, and secondly to effectively control the quantity and nutritional content supplied to each soldier. Simply chopping ten chickens or ducks into pieces and boiling them made distribution hard to measure and impossible to ensure consistent quality for every soldier. The difficulty in supervising quality would exacerbate corruption. Soldiers distributing food could easily give two drumsticks to someone they liked or had relations with, and just two feet to others.

With portioned supply, except for slight size differences, everything was identical. One drumstick per person meant one drumstick—supplied by head count. Any shortage required compensation from the quartermaster sergeant and cooks—no ambiguity. This was the "quantitative management" Wen Desi consistently advocated.

Portioned supply maximized utilization. After a bird entered the center, nothing was wasted. Besides meat, edible organs, and blood, inedible parts were dried and ground into feed and fertilizer. Even feathers weren't wasted; all were baled and shipped to Lingao for disinfection and storage to make down jackets later, or processed into feather meal for feed if quality was poor—Xun Suji (Uncooked Chicken) was researching with chemical experts to see if they could be used to make soy sauce.

Fu Ji quickly became a skilled worker. As he loaded boxes of disassembled parts onto carts for blast freezing, he couldn't help smacking his lips—when would he get to eat these good things?

Food in the Kitchen Processing Center was much better than in the transit camp. Three meals of unpolished rice, big pots of cabbage soup with chicken or duck stock—made from carcasses stripped of meat. The taste wasn't bad. After dinner, the valueless bone racks were recollected and ground into bone meal, reportedly for fertilizer.

"The Australian masters must come from poor families," Fu Ji thought, feeling a sudden kinship with these people.

The Marine detachment withdrawn to Humen rested and trained for a few days. The *Great Whale* wobbled on the river for several trial runs. When a hint of chill appeared on the river, Chen Haiyang finally received orders from Lingao:

"Negotiations fruitless. Proceed immediately to anchor at Bai'etan."

"We're going to shell Guangzhou now—it's come to this." Chen Haiyang handed the telegram to his confidential female secretary. "Summon squadron leaders and all Transmigrators for a meeting immediately!"

The fleet's departure date was set for November 1st. It was a sunny day, but the autumn chill of the Little Ice Age was distinct on the Pearl River. Soldiers swapped tropical uniforms for thicker spring/autumn long-sleeved sailor uniforms. Five Special Service Boat squadrons and a Bombardment Boat squadron, escorted by a swarm of sampans and long-dragons, steamed upstream.

The *Great Whale* lumbered at the rear of the fleet, its dazzling array of equipment and constant black smoke making it conspicuous. Locals on both banks rumored it was an Australian "monster."

They had established "prestige" in the Pearl River Delta. Commoners knew the Australians had strict discipline and never harassed the people; obeying Australian orders meant safety for life and property. It might even change their fate for the better. As the fleet moved upstream in force, savvy boat owners followed in various vessels loaded with food, fruits, and melons likely to interest the Australians, ready to sell. Many idle rich sons, knowing the Australians weren't Robin Hood-style bandits who killed the rich, boldly hired boats to follow, watching the rare spectacle—the shelling of Humen had been embellished and spread throughout the region, and many wanted to see the cannon fire with their own eyes. Everyone guessed the Australians were heading for Wuchong—where government troops had recently crammed in, built forts, and transported many Red Barbarian Cannons.

"There's going to be a huge battle," the idlers discussed, eating, drinking, and embracing women on their hired boats following the fleet, eagerly expecting a thunderous, magnificent artillery duel.

Xu Tingfa, stationed at Wuchong, heard soldier reports of heavy black smoke on the river. He quickly donned armor and took his personal guards to the watchtower. Far on the river, dozens of columns of black smoke billowed into the sky. Over twenty large ships and countless small boats densely packed the river, heading for Wuchong. The scene reminded him of Humen.

Wuchong's defenses had been greatly strengthened in the month since the Battle of Humen. Government troops densely deployed ten hastily constructed earth-and-stone or sandbag batteries, mounting eighty-four Red Barbarian Cannons and one hundred sixty Great Folangji cannons—scrounging almost every Red Barbarian Cannon in Guangdong, even diverting those intended for Fujian, Shandong, and the capital.

Li Fengjie had sent three thousand troops here, two thousand of whom were water-braves. It was so crowded there was barely standing room in the positions. There were also 24 naval war-junks—half were commandeered salt ships and rice boats.

However, the commander Xu Tingfa didn't believe holding Wuchong was possible—unless the river stakes and iron chains could stop the bandit ships.

To encourage—or supervise—the reportedly terrified generals, Li Fengjie originally intended to send the Guangzhou Military Defense Circuit Intendant to Wuchong to supervise battle. But Nantou City in Dongguan, where the Intendant was stationed, was blockaded by bandits, preventing messages from reaching him. Li Fengjie had to send Left Administration Commissioner Chen Yingyuan to Wuchong instead.

Arriving at Wuchong, Chen Yingyuan summoned Xu Tingfa. Finding him passive and seemingly displaying the face of a "surrender faction," Chen kicked him aside and personally arranged Wuchong's war preparations.

Wuchong was the outer mouth of Huangpu Port, named after the Wuchong River in Huangpu. At the confluence of the Wuchong River and Pearl River lay an island called Mayongwei. The main defensive positions of the Wuchong forts were established on this island.

Since the Mayongwei position was primary and bore the brunt of the attack, its fortifications were relatively strong. Chen Yingyuan personally supervised Nanhai and Panyu counties to conscript mass civilian labor, building timber-and-earth ramparts south of Mayongwei. The high, thick walls had 44 gun ports mounting 44 Red Barbarian Cannons.

Besides three rows of stakes blocking the channel, there was a cross-river iron chain. The chain was anchored by wooden rafts, and a commandeered sand-boat was chained to it, mounting 10 large Folangji cannons. This ship's purpose, besides stabilizing the chain against the current, was to prevent enemies from sending fire ships to burn the chain—every tactic Chen Yingyuan read in books for breaking iron chains involved fire. So he made specific countermeasures.

Hearing that bandit cannon fire was fierce and long-ranged, he ordered all new gun positions pushed forward, some built right onto the mudflats. Learning from officers and soldiers that bandits often used small boats to land and attack forts from the flank or rear, rendering big guns useless, he deployed extensive bamboo spikes, caltrops, and chevaux-de-frise around the forts. Each battery received an extra hundred combat soldiers ready to fight landing bandits. To protect soldiers from bandit superior firepower, he ordered trenches dug on the shore for soldiers to hide in, waiting until bandits landed to leap out for close combat.

For some reason, Chen Yingyuan had inexplicable confidence in the government troops' close-quarters combat ability—since bandits were strong with firearms, their melee skills must be mediocre. They might collapse at the sight of government troops' blades. So his tactical thought was keeping soldiers alive under bombardment—at least until bandits reached the trench edge.

Xu Tingfa was very respectful to Chen Yingyuan, obeying every word. He responded to inquiries with "I follow your lead entirely," "Your Excellency is brilliant," and "This general has read few books and knows little strategy."

As a minor Maritime Defense General, his status was incomparable to the Guangdong Left Administration Commissioner. Insisting on his own views would only invite trouble. However, he strongly disapproved of Commissioner Chen's arrangements. In his view, unless thick bunkers were built with "solid stone," these ramparts serving as mere walls facing the river were useless. Bandit ship guns fired unbreakable shells; even the large "Ten-Thousand-Men-Enemy" bombs lobbed by bandit "Thunder-Strike Boats" would blast gunners behind the walls to pieces. Survival would be luck; firing back was a fantasy.

As for pushing gun positions forward, it was absurd. Could the enemy not retreat if you pushed forward? Furthermore, tides would erode forward positions; in time, the forts would collapse before bandits even fired.

While observing the enemy, he suddenly saw Chen Yingyuan leading personal guards and officers across the pontoon bridge over Wuchong River onto Mayongwei. It seemed he intended to supervise directly from the front line. Xu Tingfa dared not delay; he descended the watchtower and led his guards onto the island too.

Chen Yingyuan wore third-rank official robes, a gauze cap, and a cloak, with a sword at his waist. Surrounded by guards, he ascended to the highest point of the Mayongwei fort, looking majestic.

"This is the gateway to Guangzhou, the key to the Ram City. Officers and men, today we must unite to destroy these ugly bandits!" Chen Yingyuan shouted in a high-pitched voice.

Xu Tingfa hurried forward, inviting him to supervise from the north bank.

"General, what words are these?" Chen Yingyuan appeared impassioned. "Ordered by the Governor to supervise battle here, with the safety of the Provincial Capital at stake, how dare this student harbor thoughts of cowardice?"

Xu Tingfa cursed silently—if this Left Commissioner panicked and died here, his responsibility would be immense. He instructed a confidant to coordinate with Chen's guard commander: at the slightest danger, rush him over the bridge to flee. For this, he had his guards control the pontoon bridge.

On November 1, 1630, escorted by Li Guangfa's 13th Squadron, the survey ship *Haitian* arrived as vanguard at the Wuchong forts, 30 kilometers from Guangzhou.

Protected by Special Service Boats, the *Haitian* approached Wuchong first to sound the depths. When it entered cannon range, Chen Yingyuan immediately ordered fire. Smoke rose from Mayongwei Island as all guns, regardless of direction or range, opened fire. Various projectiles trailed smoke toward the *Haitian*, mostly falling far away, with only a few splashing near the hull.

The *Haitian* turned to leave range. It had obtained sufficient depth data and determined the island artillery's range and power.

Minutes later, this intelligence was signaled to every squadron. Chen Haiyang ordered the 13th Squadron to lead the approach and bombard Mayongwei.

Four cannon squadrons approached in column formation as usual, closing to 500 meters amidst heavy incoming fire before turning.

Although government Red Barbarian Cannons had a maximum range of 1000 paces, being mounted behind thick timber-earth walls with small firing ports meant limited traverse and elevation. They could only fire at fixed angles. Though the continuous fire looked spectacular, shells rarely flew near the Special Service Boats.

The 13th Squadron completed its turn under fire, firing solid shot and incendiary shells from 500 meters. Subsequent squadrons followed suit.

One round of shelling from four squadrons riddled the Mayongwei forts. Ramparts collapsed in places. Most guns were silenced. Regardless of officers' shouts, intercepting soldiers began to flee. The water-braves transferred to defend the island fled even faster—temporary workers with weaker will than regulars, they ran as soon as the guns started.

The Fubo Army used standard tactics: after cannon-equipped warships neutralized threats, Bombardment Boat squadrons approached to project large-caliber explosive shells. From 400 meters, they bombarded Mayongwei with 280mm mortars. Violent explosions swallowed the forts like tidal waves. After a few salvos, most of Wuchong Fort was destroyed, the shore deserted. Sampans and Small Fa boats carrying Marines began landing on the southern beach.

Government soldiers and water-braves hiding in trenches, having suffered few casualties during bombardment, suddenly leaped out with shouts to charge the Marines. But Chen Yingyuan's belief in superior government melee skills proved baseless—victory in bayonet fighting belonged to the disciplined, organized, and better-trained army. In five minutes of melee, about 50 men fell to Marine bayonets; only 2 Marines died from surprise arrows and spears.

With the southern shore lost, remaining heavy guns became useless. Only a few combat soldiers continued resisting from trenches.

Simultaneous with the frontal attack, another company landed on the north bank via sampans and Small Fa boats. Chen Yingyuan had rushed three sandbag batteries and deployed hundreds of water-braves here days earlier to cover the flank.

Special Service Boats followed the landing force, ready to "wash the ground" with cannon fire; Typewriters on Small Fa boats were also ready. Suddenly a southeast wind whipped up waves, raising the water level. The three batteries, built too close to the water, were instantly flooded. Gunpowder piles were soaked. Water-braves and gunners lost their last courage and scattered without firing a shot.

Seeing the north bank forts lost, Xu Tingfa knew he'd be trapped on the island if he didn't run. He shouted: "Escort His Excellency away quickly!"

Chen Yingyuan's guards swarmed him, forced him onto a horse, and Xu Tingfa led his own guards to clear a path. Ignoring everything else, they fought their way out, fleeing across the pontoon bridge first completely out of danger.

With flank protection broken, Wuchong Fort's exposed rear had only bamboo spikes and abatis. Marines dragged two 12-pounder mountain howitzers from sampans and bombarded the fort from behind. The remaining defenders collapsed completely.

Marines flooded the island. The hundreds of defenders routed, suffering heavy casualties under crossfire from cannons, rifles, and bayonets. Some retreated fighting toward the Wuchong River. The river, ten meters wide, had a pontoon bridge to the north bank. After Xu Tingfa and Chen Yingyuan crossed, the hundreds of soldiers guarding it scattered. Marines who had landed on the north bank seized the bridgehead, firing dense volleys into the soldiers and water-braves trying to cross. Bodies piled up on the bridge.

Trapped, the government forces were annihilated in a pincer attack. 216 killed, 200 captured.

With Mayongwei Island fallen, the entire Wuchong defense system collapsed. Defenders on other paths, forts, and ships disintegrated and fled without waiting to be attacked. Marines occupied forts and camps like a peaceful takeover. A squad boarded the deserted sand-boat chained to the barrier and dismantled the cross-river iron chain. This massive chain was a valuable prize—yielding several tons of iron.
