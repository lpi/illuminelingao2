# Chapter 749 - People of Guangzhou Station

Guo Yi stood in front of the mirror, carefully examining himself. His hair had been grown out again—during the feverish war preparation before the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign, he, like other gentlemen of the Guangzhou Station who withdrew, had shaved his head, turning into a clean and comfortable crew cut. At that time, he felt his head lighten. A bit of a floating sensation.

He was the first to shave off his long hair, also implying "obeying arrangements" to the organization. Because shortly after he returned, grapevine news that some people in the Executive Committee and Senate were dissatisfied with the Guangzhou Station spread—some even suspected the Guangzhou Station of disloyalty. News about major personnel adjustments to the Guangzhou Station also reached the ears of Guangzhou Station personnel. Subsequently, Zhang Yuchen was the first to be formally transferred out of the Guangzhou Station establishment, becoming a "Leisure Senator"—a new term coined by a group of literature and history scholars dissatisfied with the title "Basic Labor Power Senator."

Immediately after, Zhang Xin and Lin Baiguang were dispatched back to Guangzhou to transfer the intelligence system—this indicated Zhang Xin leaving the Guangzhou Station was also a done deal. According to news revealed by Si Kaide, Office Director of the Ministry of Colonization and Trade, Zhang Xin would likely be sent to a new business location.

Yan Maoda was also called by the Organization Department for a talk, said to be transferring to Leizhou to work soon, and Chang Shide's transfer order was said to be issued soon.

This series of transfers made Guo Yi estimate that his possibility of returning to Guangzhou was small. Just as comprehensive war preparation began, he took advantage of the momentum to get a haircut with other Senators. Expressing that he shared "same breath, shared destiny" with the Senate and Lingao.

After the victory of the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign, Ming Lang talked to him, asking him to prepare to return to Guangzhou.

"You'd better grow your hair out again. Everyone thinks your work in Guangzhou is very important."

Guo Yi didn't ask whose idea this was, but since it came from the mouth of the Organization Department Head, it meant the order came from "The Organization." The Organization's orders were inviolable. He just nodded silently, expressing willingness to accept the mission.

The new Guangzhou Station was still headed by Guo Yi as Station Chief, Zheng Shangjie ascended to Guangzhou Station Business Person-in-Charge, and Pei Xiuli underwent several months of specialized intelligence training, preparing to display her skills on the intelligence front.

As for the Guangzhou Delong Bank and the intelligence system taken over by Lin Baiguang, they still belonged to the management scope of the Guangzhou Station organization, but these two parts reported independently to corresponding administrative departments: Delong Guangzhou Branch reported to the Head Office in Lingao, Intelligence System to the External Intelligence Bureau. Delong Bank Head Office formally activated the Bank Codebook, stipulating that from this day on, all telegraphs of Delong system financial institutions must use this codebook. As for the Intelligence Bureau system, they had their own codes long ago.

But so far, Guo Yi hadn't had much to do. Staying idle in his dormitory all along. The two maids he brought back, with whom he had physical relationships, were temporarily settled in the Quarantine Camp because they couldn't enter Bairen City. Heard they underwent comprehensive interrogation and investigation by the Political Security General Bureau.

"Heaven knows what they wrote in my file," Guo Yi thought. He touched his chin; returning to Guangzhou this time, his situation was very different from before. Just as Si Kaide and others mentioned when discussing work arrangements with him yesterday—his return this time was practically in a semi-open status, equivalent to the Consul of the Transmigrator Group in Guangzhou. He had to focus more energy on dealing with local officials and gentry.

"The opinion of the Great Library and Propaganda Department is that you should vigorously promote Australian culture and Australian lifestyle in Guangzhou, imperceptibly changing the thinking mode and lifestyle of Guangzhou citizens." Si Kaide read this passage a bit stumblingly, "Anyway, that's the meaning..."

Guo Yi was very familiar with this meaning: "It's just P*aceful E*volution."

"Right, right, right, that's the meaning." Si Kaide took out a wooden cigar box, "Have one? Gift from Wu Nanhai."

"Thanks." The cigar in the box had a rich aroma—actually, this wasn't just the smell of tobacco leaves, but a mixed fragrance formed after spraying a small amount of rum on the tobacco leaves. Guo Yi smoked a water pipe in Guangzhou—but his luxurious water pipe was left in Guangzhou, now unknown into whose hands it had fallen.

He still remembered he liked that silver water pipe very much, including all its accessories, none of which failed to display the highest achievements of ancient Chinese handicraft. Whether fine carving, inlay, or knitting, all were wonderful workmanship excelling nature, worthy of being called exquisite works of art. Smoking it had no fiery temper and was very clean. But thinking carefully, this could probably be considered a manifestation of "corroded by Daming life." Si Kaide offering him a cigar might be reminding him of this issue.

He picked up a cigar, cut a small opening with the cigar cutter Si Kaide handed over, and then lit it himself.

"Not bad, right? Heard this was rolled on Chu Qing's thigh." Si Kaide said.

"Hehe." Guo Yi gave a dry laugh.

Si Kaide puffed clouds and smoke: "Go back and prepare; after New Year's Day and the Annual Meeting, you are going back to Guangzhou. The Executive Committee and Senate's meaning is for you to be a bit more ostentatious, no need to be too low-key—anyway, everyone knows you are an Australian Grand Merchant. And carrying the prestige of total victory."

"Should we organize a restart celebration event for the Purple Tower?"

"Of course we should." Si Kaide nodded, "Celebration activities can also fully display the Australian lifestyle." He waved the cigar, mysteriously saying, "There's a grapevine rumor—someone proposed building a luxury yacht specifically for you, Proprietor Guo, to anchor at White Goose Pool (Bai'etan). Spin around on the river surface when free, making Guangzhou's local rich people envious to death..."

"Isn't that too showy?"

"We just shelled Guangzhou; isn't that more showy?" Si Kaide said nonchalantly, "The government chickened out; we have to seize the time to show our strength—Daming can't hop around in Guangdong for many years. Let the local rich people fully recognize our strength and capability first, so they will follow us obediently later."

Guo Yi obtained a new radio operator—the first generation indigenous radio operator cultivated by Lingao Telecom. This batch of radio operators could already proficiently master the use of radios. As for decoding work, it would be responsible by confidential clerks trained by the Political Security Bureau. The indigenous personnel system of Guangzhou Station underwent comprehensive cleaning this time; the core part was completely composed of indigenous personnel who passed screening and rectification work.

Guo Yi looked at his image in the mirror one last time. His hair was on the long side; without a stylist's care, it draped behind his head in disorder, looking seemingly a bit rude. In another spacetime, he could find a rubber band to tie up his hair, but here rubber bands were nowhere to be found. He had to ask Zheng Shangjie for a black iron hair hoop to hoop his hair.

After tidying up everything, he looked at his watch. The time for the Ministry of Colonization and Trade's "PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) Session" had arrived again—this matter was just like studying the "Three Old Articles" during the Cultural Revolution, becoming a fixed procedure that every department couldn't shake every day. Guo Yi was very disgusted with this inside, but he always held a "no comment" attitude towards such things to avoid inviting trouble for himself.

When going out, he secretly reminded himself to visit Yi Liu and Zhi Tao after the meeting. These two were his chamber maids in Guangzhou—called "Life Secretaries" in Lingao. After returning to Lingao, he retroactively paid the "Excess Maid Occupation Compensation Fee" and "Super-grade Maid Occupation Compensation Fee." This was a resolution path specifically opened for overseas personnel occupying more women. After paying the fee, this was considered legal.

Yi Liu and Zhi Tao naturally weren't country-toppling beauties, but according to the Maid Countermeasure Committee's evaluation standards, these two girls both had A-Class levels. To avoid others' envy, jealousy, and hate, after returning to Lingao, he very low-key arranged them in the Quarantine Camp to accept quarantine and screening, trying to minimize contact with them.

According to the Overseas Station Indigenous Personnel Training Plan, Yi Liu and Zhi Tao respectively received training in accounting and secretarial aspects. Of course, they inevitably also received brainwashing education and screening. Any indigenous personnel screened as "unreliable" would at best stay in Lingao to work, or at worst disappear henceforth—mostly sent to "Study Classes" to accept "Re-education."

Guo Yi occupying these two women, initially, simply had physical needs greater than spiritual love. But as feelings grew over time, he gradually had affection for them. So hearing both fell into the "Qualified" category after screening ended—according to the Political Security General Bureau's file, the actual political appraisal was Grade II-B—he couldn't help breathing a sigh of relief. This way, at least they didn't have to be separated in two places.

Coming out from the meeting, Zheng Shangjie invited Guo Yi to go to the *Flying Cloud* for a small-scale Party in a few days.

"Bring your two maids along too."

"Isn't that too eye-catching?"

"It's fine. I also want to ask them to help during the Annual Meeting. I want to borrow a dozen good-looking, tall maids from everyone's maids to serve as waitresses for the Annual Meeting." Zheng Shangjie said, "Don't always hide and tuck away either; they all passed the bright road at the Executive Committee side, what are you afraid of? Besides, you are also a Senator now."

"I don't mean that—"

"Then what do you mean? Must come! Bring the two maids too!"

"Alright." Guo Yi nodded helplessly.

"I'll go invite Little Pei."

Pei Xiuli had no one to ask for advice after returning to Lingao—except for participating in a PDCA session and a few military trainings during the comprehensive mobilization of the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign, she had nothing to do. Finally, out of extreme boredom, she accepted Dong Weiwei's invitation to teach part-time at the Maid Class, lecturing on "Women's Compulsory Courses" like clothing matching, makeup, manicures, skin care, and fitness, finding joy in it. Zheng Shangjie organizing the Annual Meeting made her very excited—she was naturally fond of liveliness and showing off. She certainly didn't want to miss such things.
