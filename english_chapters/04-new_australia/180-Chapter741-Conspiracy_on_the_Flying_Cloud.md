# Chapter 741 - Conspiracy on the Flying Cloud

Qian Shuiting spoke: "I won't comment on the new political structure produced by the General Assembly. It's nothing more than a miniature Saturn Community. The so-called Nine Executive Committee members are just a replica of the Nine Elders. Superficially, it claims separation of powers, but judicial and legislative powers have still fallen into the hands of the administrative department. As for the Senate, this institution is effectively just a nominal supreme power organ, nothing more than another Hand-Raising Academy, a Unanimous Passage Academy."

"There are plenty of detailed problems inside," Zhou Weisen coughed. "The Senate's system has too many qualification restrictions. Executive Committee members can serve eight years continuously, rest one term, and then continue. However, Senators have to serve one year and wait three, and they must reside permanently in Lingao, can't travel often, can't be too busy. Calculating those Executives and Department Heads, throwing away those unwilling to participate in politics or the 'cheering squads' of the establishment, how much constraint can be placed on those in power?"

Qian Shuixie expressed agreement: "They say separation of powers, but the Head of the Tribunal and the Speaker of the Senate both belong to the Executive Committee—there's absolutely no independence to speak of. It equals everything being managed by the Executive Committee. These Executives double as judges; who can control them?"

"The Dugu Qiuhun incident recently is a typical example," Zheng Shangjie said. "Speaking of Dugu's matter, it's quite serious; just thinking about it makes one afraid afterwards. Adjusted armed forces by a mere ordinary Senator—if they really entered the city, the people inside would suffer big losses. Yet the trial just passed over it like that. The component of behind-the-scenes manipulation is obvious!"

"The Dugu Incident, simply put, is political struggle acting up behind the scenes," Qian Shuiting said. "I've seen Ji Xin's materials. Actually, the truth doesn't matter anymore. The key is that this trend is very bad. Several Executives are already openly playing power games. If this continues, so-called politics will become a game played by current administrative cadres—they will use their administrative resources to continuously consolidate their power, and eventually, we ordinary Senators can only be the 'Soy Sauce Crowd' (bystanders)."

"This Executive Committee system must be abolished," Zheng Shangjie said.

"Not right now," Qian Shuixie waved his hand. "The Executive Committee system is a newly established system confirmed by the General Assembly. No obvious drawbacks have appeared yet, so-called 'moving from one victory to another.' Proposing abolition now won't be taken seriously at all—we might end up 'alienating ourselves from the people' first."

"Sigh—" Everyone except Miss Mendoza sighed. Although the discussion was in English, she couldn't understand many of the "slang terms." Listening until now, Miss Mendoza only knew that the people who abducted her seemed dissatisfied with this Transmigrator regime.

"I think we still need guns to feel panic-free," Zhou Weisen said. "Fortunately, Lin Chuanqing proposed the Right to Bear Arms this time, finally adding it to the basic rights of Transmigrators. Otherwise, I would have insisted on adding this right to the Constitution no matter what!"

"This shows the importance of a common life background," Qian Shuiting nodded. "Although we hope to merge with the group, in many matters—especially in concepts—the divergence between us 'Sea Turtles' (Returnees) and the domestic group is still very large."

"Having guns is 'now' having them," Qian Shuixie said. "Who knows about a few years later? Once the situation stabilizes, won't they find an excuse to confiscate them? Not to mention other things, industry is under the administrative system. If they cut off ammo supply, even a machine gun is useless."

"So it's not enough," Zhou Weisen said. "I think, ah, we can learn a bit from the British system, implementing a vassalage or patronage system in the army. Indigenous officers can belong to individual Senators basically. This way, every Senator controls a part of the indigenous military force within the army..."

"Impossible. Your proposal will be shot down the moment it goes up," Qian Shuiting shook his head. "And it's simple for them to suppress it—just one label of 'turning back the wheel of history' is enough."

Zhou Weisen said: "Then let every Transmigrator participate in military training regularly as reserve officers, and assign some militia reserve subordinates to each of us. If someone wants to use the army to suppress us, we'll take our men and fight them."

"That would be total chaos!" Ai Beibei said worriedly. "I feel this 'everyone having private soldiers' isn't quite right. It might end up as a tool for everyone to PK each other. Can you guarantee that the private armed force controlled by each Senator is only to protect their legitimate rights? What if someone wants to use this force for a coup? Strengthening control over the army is necessary, but this kind of private soldier setup is definitely not a good thing. In the long run, the hidden dangers are greater."

Qian Shuiting thought for a moment: "This is mainly a matter of degree. I always feel that a few hundred militia, even with equipment, can't beat organized indigenous troops. So relying on a few militia to rebel is too hard, but if pushed to desperation, it can increase the operational cost of army suppression, reducing the possibility of it happening. We can limit the quantity and quality of these temporary private soldiers controlled by each person..."

"Since they can't resist at all, what use do Senators have for such private soldiers besides PK-ing each other? A hundred or two hundred militia with Minié rifles—the regular army drags cannons over and fires a few shots, and it's done—what cost does that increase?" Ai Beibei still opposed her husband's proposal. "Don't end up becoming the Polish Republic! The Senate becomes a decoration, and nobles do whatever they want, tearing the country apart—we are, after all, one group!"

Thinking carefully, the others agreed. Managing and controlling private soldiers is a complex matter. Even if the Senate could pass it, the disgruntled administrative system has a thousand ways to counterattack. Senators have different levels and vastly different moral qualities. If a few Senators' private soldiers cause trouble or engage in "Real Life PK" once or twice, this dirty water will splash—not only will the private soldier system fail, but the proposers might also be ruined.

Ai Beibei said: "I think you are a bit extreme, thinking too darkly. It's the founding stage of the state. Didn't we agree during the discussion? To promote reform of the political system subtly. Now proposing a private soldier system that extremely protects personal interests is too radical."

Zhou Weisen considered and said: "Sister-in-law is right. This matter cannot be rushed. Army control should start from the idea of strengthening 'Nationalization'—this is something all Senators agree on. Once the big hat is put on, absolutely no one dares to oppose."

"Regarding Army Nationalization, I think we should contribute to the details. Army Nationalization—how to nationalize, how to limit personal influence on the army. Army mobilization, usage, weapon control... etc., all have precedents to follow. If I propose more on this, the chance of passing is high."

"Our base is too small. Not enough votes." Although Ai Beibei and Zhou Weisen had been elected, looking around the entire Senate, they realized their base was pitifully small. As a political faction, the influence of the North American Branch was almost zero. Qian Shuiting thought repeatedly and said:

"Since no one is pulling this lever, and we thought of it, we have to do it. Our North American Branch doesn't have its own private goals. We just want to help the group establish or adopt organizational models, management measures, and laws that we believe are more reasonable. Turning the opinions of the minority, even if correct, into the consensus of the majority is a long and arduous process. We must do our best, but not detach too much from reality. We must advance our concepts step by step. We are engaged in politics, and politics is the life of politicians. Everyone must understand: we want a reasonable system, but for others, it's demanding their political life. This means that this conceptual struggle, even if intended to be constructive, may become very cruel." Qian Shuiting analyzed using his limited political experience. He didn't realize he was actually delivering a political manifesto.

The others nodded together. Miss Mendoza widened her eyes; this manifesto made her sense a disturbing element.

"Politics has no honesty to speak of, so we must stress strategy and be prepared to deal with the other side's various intrigues. Even if they are still comrades within our same group. As for forming a sworn clique, we already have one. What we need to do now is to expand our core, base, allies, and sympathizers as much as possible."

"Our base is too small," Zhou Weisen said. Strictly speaking, the North American Branch only counted the few people present as the true core.

"So we are too detached from the masses," Qian Shuiting said. "This *Flying Cloud* yacht is too comfortable, becoming our little cozy nest. Haven't you noticed that no one ever comes to visit the *Flying Cloud*?"

"True, but we've never invited anyone either; we're all busy."

"From now on, this situation should change," Qian Shuiting said decisively. "We must go out and invite people in, making friends widely. Also, we shouldn't appear too special. We shouldn't keep the *Flying Cloud* anymore. We should hand it over quickly and everyone move ashore to live. This boat attracts too much attention; as long as we live on it, it's even more conspicuous—too detached from the collective."

"That's really reluctant to part with."

"Exactly, where will I live if the boat is donated?" The women were still reluctant.

"Bathing isn't convenient; we'd have to go to public bathhouses. Really not used to bathing in public."

"Let Duoduo sleep in a dorm?" Ai Beibei couldn't bear the child suffering. "Dorms are all prefab houses."

"And what about cooking?" Miss Mendoza suddenly added a sentence. "I see they all eat in cafeterias." These three women were all very interested in cooking.

"What about our equipment? We still need a place to store it—can't put it in the dorms." Qian Shuixie couldn't bear the treasures in the hold.

"Then lease the usage rights. That way maybe one day we can still use it."

"Don't speak nonsense. Whether defecting or being driven away, I don't like either."

The suggestion regarding handing over the *Flying Cloud* ended inconclusively. However, everyone consistently agreed to use the *Flying Cloud* for other things to expand the influence of the North American Group.

"Those few foreigners should have concepts relatively close to ours. Although they are Senators now, they belong to marginalized roles within the group and should be easily pulled over. That's quite a few votes," Qian Shuixie thought. "Salina and Xue Ziliang are possible. And Pan Pan."

Several people began calculating their allies. People with study abroad or overseas living experience were also main targets for expanding the base.

"I think Lin Chuanqing is okay, and Chen Sigen. They both like sailing and playing with guns, understand the domestic situation, and have lived in the US for a long time. They should count as our base. Pulling them over is more useful than a few foreigners—everyone has an instinctive distrust of foreigners, easily bitten back. Foreigners can't be our core force, only allies," Qian Shuiting said. "There are quite a few extreme nationalists in the Senate. If we get too close to foreigners, they'll bite us madly. It will become our handle."

The silent majority without official positions was their key work direction. Especially the street activists who briefly emerged during the Maid Revolution; they needed to be won over. They had vaguely formed a force.

"We aren't 'Universal Values Faction' (Pushi Pai) in the broad sense, at least not now, but we can cooperate with the broad Universal Values Faction. The key is what the issue is. The extreme left and extreme right may both be dissatisfied with the current administration; we can strategically ally with them. But extremism and we will fight sooner or later."

"We can't get too close to the Extremists," Zhou Weisen frowned. "I've roughly observed the surrounding Senators. Most people are pragmatists and actually look down on the Extremists."

"Sister-in-law, hasn't Du Wen always wanted to pull you into the Women's Federation? I think you should join her Women's Federation," Qian Shuixie slapped his thigh. "You are a woman; joining the Women's Federation is open and aboveboard. There are dozens of female Senators. If they can be cohesive, it's also a big vote bank."

"We must stress strategy, only proposing relatively realistic, individual demands each time."

Several people studied the focus and main principles of the work expansion again.

Zhou Weisen said: "If a certain person or persons are considered obstacles to achieving our goals, we will try to neutralize their influence. Now Ma Jia and his Law Society are the dominant force creating the status quo. We must now launch a legal struggle against them, control their influence, try to establish an independent judge system, and try to elect people we think have more credibility or our sympathizers as judges, promoting judicial independence. Objectively separating power from the Executive Committee and Tribunal representatives."

Qian Shuiting said: "Master, you are too rushed. I think we can't do these things at the start—the Exec Committee gang can totally guess what we plan to do. So initially we can only do small moves to avoid their fierce counterattack. First, we strive to change the rules for Senators. Otherwise, one year produces too little influence on policy, and then waiting three years means no continuity in anything done. This point must be resolved quickly."

Everyone expressed agreement.

"Secondly, at this stage, no substantive content—" Qian Shuiting paused, seemingly organizing language. "This year, we take building up the Senate's authority as the entry point. We must constantly remind Senators in many aspects that the Senate is the highest authority. Use the Senate to make issues on many small matters. Frequently hold inquiries and hearings, seize every opportunity to beat the administrative cadres... let administrative cadres have a respectful attitude towards the Senate—knowing the Senate isn't a rubber stamp to be fooled easily. Secondly, remind the bystander Senators how much authority they have. I think no one dislikes having authority, right? Doing this will definitely get the support of many Senators."

Zhou Weisen nodded: "You're right. As long as they haven't snagged an official position, Senators definitely hope their words carry more weight!"

"Also, we need to seize power," Qian Shuiting said. "Master, if you can jump out of the lab, wait until your vaccine has some prospect, at least switch to the industrial sector. Only then can you master more resources. 'Those who labor with their minds govern others; those who labor with their strength are governed by others'—this saying still has truth."

"It's hard in the short term," Zhou Weisen shrugged. "Besides, the Transmigrator Group is all big State-Owned Enterprises; where is the industrial sector?"

"I see, I can go to Guangzhou Station to work," Zheng Shangjie said. "Si Kaide asked for my opinion a few days ago, saying Guangzhou Station needs to send someone who understands marketing and internal management to be responsible for the backend of the Purple Tower."

"Go! Of course go," Qian Shuixie said. "You didn't tell me."

"I go to Guangzhou, leaving you here to pick up girls?"

"I guarantee I won't pick up girls—besides, I don't look up to the girls here..."

Qian Shuiting thought this was a good opportunity to penetrate the industrial/commercial sector. Guangzhou Station's status was non-trivial. Entering to hold an important position would be a huge promotion in status. Additionally, he thought of the recent joint efforts between Guangzhou Station and Leizhou Station to lobby the Dispatch Group, creating momentum and making them implicitly a new interest group. The Dispatch Group could utilize resources from both Lingao and the Ming simultaneously. In the current environment, personal danger was very low, while benefits could be huge. If they utilized the group's lax monitoring, engaging in private deals with various parties was completely feasible. In the long run, it was very likely to create a situation of "the tail wagging the dog."

In this way, the Executive Committee was actually preparing to mix sand into Guangzhou Station! Qian Shuiting suddenly became excited. Zheng Shangjie entering the Guangzhou Station system as "sand" would likely occupy a very high position in Guangzhou Station later.

Zhou Weisen said slowly: "I don't hope for you husband and wife to separate, but this is indeed a good opportunity! If Sister-in-law can go, it will be very beneficial for the future!"

"I have no objection! Absolutely support," Qian Shuixie said. "Little Jie said she was bored to death locally. Originally she wanted to work in the cooperative. Guangzhou Station is much stronger than the cooperative."

"Good, then I'll go!" Zheng Shangjie wasn't a person who dragged her feet. Going to Guangzhou to do "Big Business" certainly suited her heart more than staying in Lingao to run some cooperative.
