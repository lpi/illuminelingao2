# Chapter 742 - Flying Cloud Club

It was decided right then that Zheng Shangjie would go to work in Guangzhou, quickly grasping the work at the Purple Tower. As for Qian Shuixie, everyone thought that rather than staying in the basic labor force as a Lingao "Redneck," it would be better for him to take a position in the military. With Qian Shuixie's physical fitness and weapon handling level, he was much stronger than many Senator officers in the Army.

Qian Shuiting began to arrange: "Brother, find a way to get into the military system. I estimate that any Senator serving as an officer in the military system now will be at least a Major General in three to five years, and they are all people who actually lead troops. It gives confidence to master a force."

"Good." Qian Shuixie nodded.

"Master, you need to help Miss Mendoza learn Chinese. Miss Mendoza is also a Senator. We need to let her play a bigger role, can't just let her be a housewife at home..."

"You look down on housewives?" Miss Mendoza said resentfully. "My career ideal is to be a housewife..." She looked at the ship with complex emotions.

Qian Shuiting knew that not a few foreign women aspired to be housewives, so he just laughed it off. However, regarding learning Chinese, Mendoza herself thought it was necessary—after all, she was surrounded by Chinese people now.

As for Zhou Weisen, everyone thought his identity label as a "technical expert" was too heavy, making an immediate transformation difficult. At this stage, he could only be like Ai Beibei, speaking more in the Senate as a Standing Committee member and engaging in political activities.

"Master, your skills with guns and diving are among the best of the five hundred Senators. conducting more training for everyone can rope in a large portion of people. Also, the army and those law enforcement agencies will come to ask for your training. By then, your students will be everywhere... Hahaha..." Qian Shuiting felt more and more that his idea was brilliant.

Speaking of diving, Zhou Weisen was probably the only one in the Transmigrator Group with a professional diving instructor license—not to mention he brought a massive amount of specialized equipment.

Zhou Weisen nodded: "The few of us brothers, not to mention other things, when it comes to playing with guns and sailing, there are few among the five hundred Senators better than us. This is our strong point. If we put more effort into this—I think we should start a Diving and Firearms Club. Combine with 'Yellow Paw' and the others to organize camping training, BBQs, and such activities. Most Senators will definitely be interested—the Executive Committee won't have objections either; it's skills training, they won't oppose it."

"Use this club as an interaction platform!" Qian Shuiting became interested. "Use colorful outdoor activities to attract the 'Soy Sauce Crowd' (bystander) Senators, subtly conveying our concepts to everyone!"

To avoid the outside world feeling that this group was too exclusive, several people felt they should give the group a name. Preferably one with not too obvious political colors. The final chosen name was the "Zhai Club"—abbreviated as the "Zhai Party" (Otaku Party). Because the group's development direction was mainly the vast number of "Zhai Nan" (Otaku men), removing the word "Nan" (men) could attract some ladies.

"When our influence grows, Master, you can come out to run for Speaker of the Senate. Grab this highest power institution in hand!" Qian Shuiting said. "This position is currently vacant, and temporarily no one seems willing to come out and run."

"Good! I'm willing to overlook this matter." Zhou Weisen geared up.

The Zhai Party's work policy was to attract the majority of Senators with rich and frequent interactive activities, propagating political thoughts. In specific implementation, they emphasized strategy, only proposing relatively realistic specific demands each time, rather than comprehensive systemic reform. The targets of reform were mainly specific policies, not specific people.

The ultimate demand of the Zhai Party was to establish a system of separation of powers, checks and balances, mobility, and transparency within the group, protecting the interests of the vast number of Senators, especially the Transmigrators who did not hold power under the current system. The most important task at present was to establish broad connections with other Transmigrators and, within the scope of basic rights of Senators clearly defined by the new Common Program, open up avenues for speech.

Fully discuss problems within the current system. As a concrete measure, Qian Shuiting proposed using their private assets, including servers, routers, and software, to open an independent website not directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Committee.

"What you're doing is meaningless. First, some people think you are wasting resources—although the things are our own, someone will definitely think this is wasting limited computer hardware. An official forum used by only five hundred IDs doesn't occupy much server resource; if you open a second one, the intention to seize the public opinion position is too obvious." Zhou Weisen said. "Second, content-wise, the official forum is quite free in terms of atmosphere: there are posts saying anything, regarding cursing Executives, cursing the Executive Committee, cursing administrative officials, there are plenty. As long as they don't engage in personal attacks, they are kept. We can't use 'greater discussion scale' or 'freedom of speech' as propaganda to attract Otakus to shift discussion grounds. Know that a large part of their discussion is for the power-holders of the Executive Committee to see. Venting on a private forum is useless to them."

Qian Shuiting thought it was true, but he wasn't reconciled to this plan of seizing public opinion grounds going bankrupt, so he said again: "We use providing resources to attract Otakus..."

"We are even less of a match for the official website," Ai Beibei frowned and interrupted. "Last time I wanted to find some cartoons Duoduo hadn't seen. Unexpectedly, under the video on demand and download cartoon category, there were over a thousand GB of 18X and 21X content—even stuff not dared to be publicly disseminated in the USA is there!"

Zhou Weisen continued to be pessimistic: "The official website's approach to 'food and sex are human nature' is much more open-minded than the Saturn Community, almost completely laissez-faire—even encouraged. Wanting to use this to wear down the thoughts and will of the 'Soy Sauce Crowd'. We are unlikely to compete with them in resources; the official server holds the entire collection of five hundred Otakus. Think about how many weird and grotesque things you can find there."

At the same time, there were questions on specific implementation details, such as who owns the network jurisdiction, and the right to dispose of private property and time within the group. Finally, everyone decided to adopt a compromise plan: push for opening more speech systems on the official website, not only fighting verbal wars on the BBS but also allowing everyone to express opinions through personal blogs, microblogs, etc.

With negotiations settled, everyone went back to their cabins to rest. Qian Shuiting privately urged his younger brother: Work hard in the army, maintain good relations with colleagues as much as possible, and establish his own prestige with subordinates. Get along well with everyone. Have sufficient grasp of the army and sufficient understanding of ideological trends within the army, but don't form cliques. regarding political topics, one can state one's position but shouldn't participate in arguments or persuade others to agree with one's views.

"The Executive Committee gang has established a special service agency—who knows if they are collecting 'black materials' (dirt). The Political Security Bureau is a dark den." Qian Shuiting said. "We don't have the ability to lift their black lid yet. You must pay attention to your words and deeds daily, don't let people compile dirt on you." Qian Shuiting's generation was quite sensitive to such things.

"Rest assured. I know the limits! This is not the old spacetime after all; no one can cover the sky with one hand."

In the following days, the North American Branch actively moved according to the established policy. Zheng Shangjie entered Guangzhou Station and quickly mastered the backend operation rights of the Purple Tower; meanwhile, Qian Shuixie, by roping in Xue Ziliang to play with guns together, not only successfully established a personal relationship with Bei Wei but also successfully entered the Special Recon Team under Xue Ziliang's recommendation, serving as the Team Leader of the Sanya Detachment.

In order to prepare for running for the Speaker of the Senate in the future, Zhou Weisen created a "close to the people" image from now on and moved to the Farm to live—the biological laboratory was located in the Nanhai Farm. Basically, everyone doing biological research lived there: first, it was close to work; second, convenient for exchange; third, at the Farm, both the surrounding environment and food supply were better than the collective dorms in Bairen City. For this, Zhou Weisen spent a lot of effort to persuade Mendoza to move—he also had to promise Mendoza could come back to live on the ship for a few days whenever she wanted.

Seeing everything proceeding very smoothly, Qian Shuiting secretly rejoiced. He originally wanted to move himself and his family to Bairen City and hand over the yacht, but encountered Ai Beibei's resolute opposition: she was fine herself, but she resolutely disagreed with letting Duoduo live in a prefab house. Furthermore, the Qian Shuixie couple didn't agree to move away either. The very complete kitchen and bathroom equipment on the yacht was what she was most reluctant to part with—in her view, handing it over would just be wasting resources in vain.

"Besides, aren't you going to use this yacht as a club? Mendoza has to come back to live sometimes. Someone has to manage the club anyway; we can just be the administrators. We only occupy a few bedrooms anyway. It doesn't hinder anything."

Qian Shuiting couldn't overrule his wife, so he had to agree to keep the ship only for club use. Converting the upper entertainment community of the ship into a public place facing all Transmigrators. This kind of yacht configuration was a luxurious place only a few rich people could touch even in the spacetime the Transmigrators left. If opened, it should be more popular than the cafes in the city now.

Qian Shuiting went to find Xiao Zishan, expressing the hope to open a non-profit club house by the Wenlan River pier outside Bairen City using this ship. Their rhetoric to Xiao Zishan was: Since Transmigrators are allowed to form associations and clubs now, turn this ship into a club house named "Flying Cloud Society." Usually prioritized for club activities. It can also serve as a private gathering and leisure place for Transmigrators—reservations accepted. To give everyone a chance to use it, continuous reservation and occupation of the venue by any society or individual would be restricted.

The ship would still be managed and maintained by Qian Shuiting and others. He stated he wouldn't turn this into a profit-making venue; usually, the Qian Shuiting couple and Mendoza would be in charge. Apart from the club's own activities, usage fees would be charged as appropriate for other societies and individuals.

As for the consumables used, Senators would pay corresponding costs out of their own pockets—these consumables would be purchased by the Flying Cloud Society at fair prices with a partial loss charge; other than that, no price difference would be charged as profit.

The North American Group's calculation was: Disguised transfer of partial usage rights of the *Flying Cloud* could shed the North American Branch's burden of being detached from the masses, without losing ownership and usage rights of the *Flying Cloud*. Giving everyone more places for amusement and leisure, attracting Senators to gather here. Making it a platform for speech release and communication, an auxiliary tool for mobilizing the masses and carrying out parliamentary reform.

Additionally, Qian Shuiting hoped that better understanding of ideological trends within the group could be achieved through this public place.

Plan completed, Qian Shuiting went to the Executive Committee compound, preparing to talk face-to-face with Xiao Zishan about this issue. He believed Xiao Zishan wouldn't veto this proposal—he had no reason to veto; this was beneficial to all Senators. If he opposed, Qian would leak this matter on the BBS first, questioning the service consciousness level of the General Office for Senators.

After registering and queuing, he smoothly met Xiao Zishan.

"I am Xiao Zishan, you are—Qian... Qian Shui... have something to see me?"

Qian Shuiting naturally knew Xiao Zishan, but obviously, the other party wasn't particularly familiar with him. He hurriedly introduced himself: "I am Qian Shuiting from the Planning Commission, ah, now called the Planning Agency. Executive Xiao, I have something to ask for your instructions..."

"Just call me Xiao Zishan." The man wore a gentle smile, standing up busily to greet, "Sit, sit. Or call me Comrade works too."

"Alright, Comrade Xiao..." Qian Shuiting felt awkward saying it; he was used to the Chinese circle transforming the semantics of "Comrade" (into gay). So he explained the matter of opening a club on the *Flying Cloud*.

"...It's also not good for our three families to occupy this ship all the time; solitary joy is not as good as shared joy! It can also enrich the masses' amateur cultural life..."

Xiao Zishan was silent for a while, seemingly waiting to see if he had any additions, then spoke: "The *Flying Cloud*, it was stated at the beginning, is property confirmed to belong to your three North American households—bringing it out for public use like this seems inappropriate."

"This is us voluntarily bringing it out as a public entertainment venue; the property rights are still ours." Qian Shuiting anticipated Xiao Zishan would use protecting private property rights as an argument and had prepared a response long ago.

Xiao Zishan finally agreed to his request. However, the location couldn't be on the Wenlan River.

"This 100-plus ton ship can't reach Bairen Beach pier," Xiao Zishan said. "And the Wenlan River is currently undergoing segmented water conservancy projects; navigation isn't very convenient. I think the *Flying Cloud* should move to Lingao Cape."

Thus, the *Flying Cloud* moved to Lingao Cape near Wu De's Villa. Under the atmosphere of comprehensive "liquidation of privileges" at the Second General Assembly, Wu De immediately handed over the villa to the General Office for use. Xiao Zishan knew the environment near Wu De's Villa was beautiful and relatively safe, deciding to make this the core of a leisure and entertainment zone for Senators to use.

Now that the *Flying Cloud* also wanted to run a club, Xiao Zishan didn't consider much and simply went for a public-private partnership, letting the *Flying Cloud* anchor in the bay in front of Wu De's Villa. A trestle bridge and a waterfront platform had already been built here. There were also plans to build some vacation cabins around the villa.

Just as preparations for the Flying Cloud Club's opening were in intense preparation, news of the government army launching an encirclement campaign reached Lingao. Following that was the start of partial mobilization; all non-essential construction projects stopped. Then came centralized military training for Senators and large-scale militarized mobilization. As Zheng Shangjie withdrew to Lingao with Guangzhou Station, trade between the mainland and Lingao was also completely interrupted. The Qian brothers and Zhou Weisen could no longer get the things needed to open the Flying Cloud Club.

Experiencing a series of events like the trade blockade, the Chengmai Battle, and victory celebrations, although Qian Shuiting, Zheng Shangjie, and others took the path of Li Mei and Fang Fei to pass the resolution for holding an "Annual Meeting," the problem of interrupted trade and scarce materials after the victory remained unsolved. Following that, the "Pearl River Campaign" began, and the matter was delayed once again.

Finally, this time, rights such as reopening trade were obtained through the Pearl River Campaign. From Executives down to ordinary Senators, everyone finally had a mood for celebration. Under Qian Shuiting's activities, the resolution to continue holding the Annual Meeting was passed in the Senate. Not only would many Senators from Guangzhou and Leizhou return to Lingao to attend the Annual Meeting, but even a part of the Senators from Sanya would also return to Lingao. Qian Shuiting felt time shouldn't be lost; seize this opportunity to make the *Flying Cloud*'s reputation known!

He immediately became active. His own wife didn't have much time—the Health Department was the busiest department in the Transmigrator Group; he himself wasn't much better off. The Planning Agency was terribly busy post-war, with massive statistical reports pouring in. All kinds of numbers piled up on the desk; almost everyone had to work until late at night to finish the day's reports. However, since his sister-in-law returned to Lingao from Guangzhou, apart from participating in debriefings and attending hearings, she had been idle. This combat power could be effectively utilized.

Zheng Shangjie did not disappoint his hopes. During her idle time in Lingao, she was very close with Li Mei. The two had much to exchange on how to do business, especially regarding the issue of the Lingao version of the Purple Tower which Li Mei had high hopes for; both sides conducted in-depth discussions.

Since the cooperative was nationalized, Li Mei's interest in doing business hadn't decreased—this was probably a hobby of hers. She felt the Transmigrator Group's momentum of comprehensive nationalization wouldn't last long; sooner or later, "system reform" would happen. Even if there was no sharing of the State-Owned Enterprise pie, allowing Senators to do business autonomously was always possible—by then, pooling some capital to start an industry wouldn't be hard. Zheng Shangjie then promised to let Qian Shuiting propose this matter when the Senate met later. Li Mei's favorability towards her rose greatly. regarding the Annual Meeting matter, Li Mei's interest was also very high. She promised to strongly support the Flying Cloud Society's activities at the Annual Meeting.

Zheng Shangjie went to lobby Fang Fei again, expressing that the Flying Cloud Society was willing to fully undertake this Annual Meeting event, including full planning, partial venue provision, providing some entertainment activities, etc. Fang Fei felt she was too busy and was naturally very happy someone was willing to sponsor. Immediately, both sides hit it off and confirmed the cooperative relationship.
