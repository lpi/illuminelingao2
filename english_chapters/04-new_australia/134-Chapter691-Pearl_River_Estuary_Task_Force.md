# Chapter 691 - Pearl River Estuary Task Force

The Navy would execute this operation. The operational area would encompass the entire Guangdong maritime region, with the Pearl River Estuary serving as the focal point.

"The objective of this campaign is to create maximum disturbance and chaos throughout the Pearl River Delta," Chen Haiyang outlined. "We will conduct bombardments and small-scale landing operations to sabotage and strike targets ashore. Our primary targets are government facilities—we will avoid striking civilian areas where possible. However, should local armed forces offer resistance, we will conduct comprehensive annihilation operations against them."

In principle, vessels at sea would not be seized unless they were government naval warships or if the other party initiated provocative or aggressive actions.

"Given the unique nature of this operation, participating ships will carry more Marines than usual, along with additional Army artillery required for landing operations."

"If we carry out this operation, our warships will need to enter the Pearl River," Meng De rose to ask. "We know nothing about the river's hydrological conditions in this era—the shoals, the tides, the channels remain unknowns."

"On the contrary, we have an excellent grasp," Xu Ke replied. "Do you imagine the vessels of Gaoguang Shipping and our Navy's transports haven't been conducting hydrological surveys during their many voyages to and from Guangzhou?"

"So we possess sufficient Pearl River hydrological data for captains to use?" Meng De had spent considerable time recuperating in hospital and sanatorium since the five-masted ship rescue incident.

Xu Ke confirmed that the External Intelligence Bureau's database contained precisely such information. A dedicated team was currently compiling it. Soon the Navy would receive unprecedentedly detailed data on the Pearl River Estuary's hydrology and navigation channels.

"Navigation conditions in the Pearl River are excellent. Even the Sacred Ship could travel from the estuary all the way up to Guangzhou. The small and medium-sized sailing vessels we primarily use will have no difficulties whatsoever. Water depth is not a concern—and this being four hundred years before the twenty-first century, sedimentation in the Pearl River is considerably lighter."

"The Pearl River channel remains quite complex," Chen Haiyang noted. "Particularly since landing operations will involve near-shore waters. We'll assign some native captains familiar with the Pearl River channels to participate."

Though everyone harbored strong confidence in their technological superiority, experienced naval officers still held significant concerns about this Pearl River Estuary campaign. These anxieties stemmed not merely from the complex hydrological conditions in the estuary and river—hidden shoals, unmarked channels—but from the fundamental difficulties large and medium-sized sailing vessels faced when navigating and maneuvering in such waters. Turning around, for instance, posed serious challenges.

When the British Navy attacked Guangzhou during the Opium War, they had primarily employed paddle steamers as tugs, towing their sailing warships and bombardment vessels for mobility.

"We don't have paddle steamers at present," Chen Haiyang acknowledged. "But we do have Daihatsu landing craft. The Daihatsus have good mobility and can manage towing duties adequately. Additionally, they can transport Marines ashore and provide escort protection."

Wen Desi disagreed: "How did the British fleet reach Bai'etan during the Opium War? Their hydrological data couldn't have been superior to ours, yet they sailed warships displacing several thousand tons right to Guangzhou's gates. Even without comprehensive data, using small boats to sound depths and place channel buoys as we advance is sufficient. We'll simply sail a bit slower."

"To ensure the success of this blockade and harassment operation, the Navy will establish a Pearl River Estuary Detachment." Li Di began presenting the fleet composition from the plan.

The detachment's warships would primarily consist of Special Service Vessels—modified traditional Chinese-style two- and three-masted ships. Some Special Service Vessels would carry reduced ammunition to accommodate additional Marines and cannons.

Sixteen Special Service Vessels and eight fast single-masted patrol boats would form the armed fleet, with another twenty Special Service Vessels incorporated for transporting Marines and supplies. Given that the Pearl River Estuary lay 500 nautical miles from Lingao, the *Big Whale* and several specialized supply ships would prove essential.

In the operation's initial phase, the Navy would first establish a temporary fortress on Hong Kong Island as a logistical supply and rest base for the Pearl River Estuary Detachment.

Setting aside Hong Kong Island's future commercial value, its location just outside the Pearl River Estuary—with its excellent harbor and accessible freshwater resources—made it an ideal base for the naval detachment. The transmigrator group remained isolated in Hainan, their maritime power positioned at the westernmost edge of Guangdong-Guangxi waters, exerting little influence over the broader Guangdong coast. Once they occupied Hong Kong Island and established a permanent detachment and naval base, they would maintain a powerful presence directly outside the Pearl River Estuary. Every move would affect Guangzhou and the entire Pearl River Delta region. This would not only control Guangdong's foreign trade but also protect their own shipping routes.

Of course, this move would likely be perceived by Liu Xiang as a challenge to his maritime hegemony in Guangdong. However, the General Staff and Intelligence Bureau estimated that even so, Liu Xiang would probably not dare to immediately open full hostilities with the transmigrator group—Zheng Zhilong was still watching from the wings. If Liu Xiang committed his full force to attacking the transmigrators, Zheng Zhilong would absolutely not miss such a golden opportunity to strike in concert.

Li Di voiced a concern: "But the Pearl River Estuary is Liu Xiang's territory after all. It's his base of operations—he won't yield it easily!"

"If he wants war, we'll annihilate him completely," Chen Haiyang replied. "A confrontation with Liu Xiang is inevitable. It's coming sooner or later."

That said, Liu Xiang's strength was formidable, and the Pearl River Estuary waters were where his fleet frequently operated. Compared to scattered Ming military camps and outposts on shore, Liu Xiang could very possibly use his numerical superiority against the Detachment.

The Navy's plan was straightforward: should such a situation arise, they would use the Hong Kong base as a pivot, firmly attracting Liu Xiang's main force near the Pearl River Estuary. Then the Navy would launch its main fleet from Lingao to deliver a devastating blow. The plan even included provisions for deploying the Sacred Ship in combat if necessary.

The Detachment sent to the Pearl River Estuary would be personally commanded by Chen Haiyang. There was no shortage of transmigrators willing to serve as fleet commander, but most had barely mastered the basics of sailing. Having swallowed volumes of naval knowledge whole, God only knew whether they had actually digested any of it. After careful deliberation, the Executive Committee and Navy concluded that Chen Haiyang should lead the fleet himself. At the very least, he was a genuine naval officer.

"I actually feel somewhat inadequate," he admitted. To this day, his entire command experience at sea consisted of serving as a ship captain. His concepts of commanding a sailing fleet in combat came almost entirely from books and from Wen Desi.

Modern naval officers like Chen Haiyang knew little more about commanding Age of Sail warships than Wen Desi did—after all, both had drawn their knowledge from naval history texts.

"Coordinator Wen, would you care to accompany the fleet?"

"Certainly. I'd be delighted." Wen Desi agreed readily.

"Excellent. I've been feeling the burden was too heavy. I've never commanded a wind-powered fleet."

"Neither have I. We're in the same boat." Wen Desi stroked the beard on his chin. "Which ship do you plan to designate as flagship?"

"*Ling-Special 11*. It's a three-masted large Guang-ship, nearly three hundred tons—the largest in the task force. It has ample cabins and can accommodate the headquarters. Will you join me aboard?"

"Agreed." Wen Desi nodded. Though nearly three hundred tons, it remained a rather small ship by modern standards. Even large European sailing vessels like the *Götheborg*, displacing over a thousand tons, had severely limited internal volume. Once packed with sailors and supplies for a voyage, conditions wouldn't be pleasant. But the journey to Hong Kong Island would take only a few days. Then they could establish headquarters directly on the island.

Shi Shisi licked his fingers with satisfaction—a bad habit the naval officer training class had never managed to break. But then, someone who had gone to sea young and drifted from port to port could hardly be expected to have impeccable manners. His naval officer uniform bore grease stains across the front. The sumptuous lunch had left him drowsy.

Shi Shisi no longer displayed many visible traces of his pirate past. Though his body had been strong before, his posture had been poor—head perpetually tilting to one side. Now drill training and systematic physical conditioning had transformed both his bearing and physique. He had become fit and proportionate, his hair and beard trimmed clean.

He wore the new summer-style dark blue naval officer uniform. Beyond using a cotton-linen blend for breathability, the standing collar had been modified to a small open collar—Army and Navy officers alike found standing collars intolerably stifling in the summer heat.

Shi Shisi now held the rank of Navy Lieutenant, commanding a squadron of Special Service Vessels. He had learned how to deploy a squadron in formation at sea: most crucially, forming the line ahead for broadside fire; how to seize the windward position in naval battle; how to judge the optimal firing range and timing.

He had never imagined naval battles could be conducted this way. He had known some of the tricks before, but no one had ever summarized them so precisely and methodically, explaining everything clearly in text. When he couldn't grasp the written descriptions, there were diagrams and model demonstrations to aid his understanding.

He learned semaphore. He learned to judge target distance and speed. And finally, he learned the salute regulations, proper dining etiquette, and how to speak as befitted a naval officer. Naval training and its attendant rituals had gradually made Shi Shisi unrecognizable even to himself.

Yet such days brought him profound satisfaction—because Shi Shisi understood he had become a man of standing. As a pirate, no matter how many men and ships you commanded, you remained a bandit. That title never carried any weight.
