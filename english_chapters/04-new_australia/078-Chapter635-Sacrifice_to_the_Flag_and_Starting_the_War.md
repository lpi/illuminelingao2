# Chapter 635 - Sacrifice to the Flag and Starting the War

By now full daylight had arrived. The principal civil and military officials of Qiongzhou Prefecture and Hainan Circuit, along with local celebrities, had begun arriving one after another. Sedan chairs and horses arrived in a continuous stream. The area surrounding the earthen platform became a gathering place for black gauze caps and square scholar's hats. Those assembled must have felt enormously honored and excited to personally attend this grand ceremony—they exchanged reserved greetings with one another while craning their necks to observe, waiting for the Commander-in-Chief to appear.

On the earthen platform, two tiger-skin chairs had already been arranged. One was for He Rubin, the Regional Commander guarding Guangdong; the other was for Zhao Ruyi, the Left Assistant Administration Commissioner and Intendant of Hainan Circuit, who was serving as Army Supervisor.

Suddenly, a burst of horns sounded, and the retinues of He Rubin and Zhao Ruyi began entering the drill ground. The two dismounted before the earthen platform and ascended it, surrounded by a crowd of attendants.

Arrayed below the earthen platform on all four sides were He Rubin's personal officers, personal soldiers, and household guards—fully three or four hundred men in all. Each was helmeted and armored, swords and spears aligned, awaiting in full battle array. Surrounded by generals and private secretaries, He Rubin and Zhao Ruyi had already taken their seats on the folding chairs at the center. He Rubin was leaning sideways, speaking quietly to Zhao Ruyi. Zhao Ruyi sat with composed calm, slightly raising his long, thin face and stroking his three strands of sparse beard. He nodded only slightly, appearing cold and conceited. On either side of them, two rows of higher-ranking civil and military officials and private secretaries stood according to the custom of "Civil on the Left, Military on the Right." By custom, all had dropped their hands and held their breath, presenting a respectful and solemn appearance.

On the drill ground, a great many troops had already gathered. The local gentry invited to attend stroked their beards and uttered sounds of surprised admiration, discussing in low voices and pointing at the various banners fluttering across the field. No one could determine exactly how many troops were present.

The older ones among them could still vaguely recall the grand spectacle of the government army crossing the sea to suppress bandits during the Ma Shi Campaign in the Wanli reign. This occasion seemed no less impressive—the government army crossing the sea claimed a strength of fifty thousand men.

Among the troops gathered here, excluding He Rubin's Governor's Standard and household guards, as well as portions of the Viceroy's Standard and Governor's Standard, a total of four Lieutenant Colonels and one Guerrilla General from the Guangdong Ming Army had arrived in Qiongshan: the Chaozhou Lieutenant Colonel, Qiongya Lieutenant Colonel, Leilian Lieutenant Colonel, and the Guangdong Training Guerrilla General.

These five commanders were different from the empty-titled Assistant Regional Commanders, Lieutenant Colonels, and Guerrilla Generals that had become increasingly common in the late Ming. They were solid regular military officers with defined defense sectors and substantive titles. Essentially, the entire main force of Guangdong—except for the Eastern and Western Mountain Lieutenant Colonels guarding against the Yao people—had turned out in full strength. The officials, gentry, and commoners of Qiongzhou had not witnessed such a battle array in decades.

Gou Chengxuan watched from the hillside at a distance; his elevated position gave him an excellent view. As he observed, he suddenly heard someone shouting repeatedly:

"Injustice! Injustice! This lowly one is a good commoner!"

He was slightly startled and looked back. Several prisoners, stripped to the waist, bound with ropes, and covered in the scars of torture, were being herded toward the drill ground by a group of soldiers. They staggered as they walked, crying out.

"This lowly one is an ordinary merchant who only went to Lingao to buy and sell needles and thread. Master, spare my life!"

"This lowly one is not a spy! Injustice, injustice!"

Gou Chengxuan initially thought spies had been caught, but the old soldier behind him whispered: "These are to be taken to have their heads chopped off as a sacrifice to the flag." Then he sighed. "I hear they're all small traders, arrested for having been to Lingao."

"Ah, so they went to do business with the Hair Bandits! They should be killed!" Gou Chengxuan suddenly screamed. If not for so many people lusting after the Hair Bandits' petty profits, how could the Hair Bandits have grown so rampant and gathered over ten thousand followers? He had heard that when the Gou Family Manor was overrun, many people from Yanchang Village had participated, helping the Hair Bandits transport weapons. After the stockade fell, they had taken their share in plundering the Gou Family Manor's property and even dismantling homes. Upon returning to Lingao this time, he resolved to slaughter all of Yanchang Village, leaving not a single soul alive! Even the women must not be allowed to live, he thought viciously.

"Although somewhat unjust, they brought ruin upon themselves!" a voice said from nearby. Gou Chengxuan turned to look; the speaker was none other than Qian Taichong, Zhao Ruyi's private secretary. Gou Chengxuan hurriedly offered flattery: "What brother implies is absolutely correct!"

Qian Taichong snorted coldly; he looked down somewhat on this stripped scholar. He had not gone to the drill ground today—his degree was too low, and he held no official position. On the drill ground, he could only stand far away at the back. Qian Taichong was a man of high ambition and pride; how could he stand such slights? He might as well watch the spectacle here in the Central Army camp.

He had always thought highly of himself, fully aware that Zhao Ruyi had hired him as a private secretary not out of admiration for his moral essays but merely to oblige a fellow townsman's introduction. Arriving in this distinctly southern barbarian land of Qiongzhou, before he could devise any measures to display his abilities and earn recognition, he had been dispatched to Guangzhou by Assistant Administration Commissioner Zhao—obviously, Zhao did not take him seriously.

During several strategy meetings on bandit suppression, Qian Taichong had been eager to offer a few stratagems and win everyone's respect. But he possessed no military experience to speak of and had not read military texts. Even armchair strategizing was beyond his reach. He could only wax grandiloquent about matters of popular sentiment and morale, which annoyed everyone.

Originally he would not have bothered with someone like Gou Chengxuan, but since he intended to distinguish himself in the aftermath affairs following the Lingao war, he had to extend some courtesy to this rare Lingao native.

"They merely coveted small profits and went to Lingao to do business. Insisting they are Hair Bandit spies is indeed somewhat excessive," Qian Taichong observed. "However, precisely because rural commoners fear punishment, they must be awed with severe measures! If allowed to drift with the current chasing profit without punishment, other foolish people will view the government as soft and easily bullied, following suit one after another. Within a year or half, the people's hearts will surely shift dramatically. Before the Hair Bandits even rebel, Qiongzhou would already no longer be ours!"

He spoke with such soaring heroism that Gou Chengxuan could only listen respectfully. He agreed heartily with the point about commoners fearing punishment yet chasing profit. Just as he was pondering what to say in response, the signal cannon suddenly sounded again.

The several prisoners from before were pushed and shoved to positions beneath the flagpole on the drill ground. These commoners included small merchants who had traveled to and from Lingao, as well as people who had carelessly said a few favorable words about the Hair Bandits in Qiongzhou. All had been arrested as Hair Bandit spies.

They were shouted at to kneel. Several executioners stepped forward. With the sound of the signal cannon, several bloody heads fell one by one and were placed beneath the flagpole.

Immediately afterward, twenty-four large war drums began to beat. The drum sound was deep, the rhythm austere and unadorned; yet it possessed an awe-inspiring power. When the tempo climbed to a crescendo, heaven and earth themselves seemed to shake. With the soul-stirring drum sound and the suddenly blaring horns, a red flag was raised on the Commander's Platform.

The army gathered in the distance like dark clouds began to move slowly. Like distant thunder before a rainstorm, the soldiers' massed footsteps became magnificent. Swordsmen holding great sabers, archers carrying bows and arrows, spearmen with long spears pointing obliquely at the sky, musketeers bearing three-eyed guns and matchlock muskets... Team after team marched across in orderly step according to fixed formations. Countless flags fluttered amid the smoke and dust kicked up by the soldiers.

Horns sobbed, drums rumbled. The troops participating in the review were the most elite portion of the sea-crossing Ming army, totaling seven thousand men. Armor and weapons were neat, equipment excellent—they projected an overwhelming momentum.

It was the first time in Qian Taichong's life that he had attended such a large-scale military review. He found himself involuntarily excited, his heart trembling slightly with nervous tension. He gripped the fan in his hand tightly, staring intently at the troops marching through the smoke and dust.

*This army is actually capable of fighting!* Qian Taichong thought. *The Court still possesses elite soldiers and capable generals.* The government troops he had seen during his travels as a wandering secretary had been either exhausted soldiers and lazy pawns or arrogant soldiers and fierce brutes. Now, witnessing such elite forces, he felt enormously reassured about this bandit suppression—victory seemed merely a matter of time.

"Everyone says the Hair Bandits maintain strict discipline and orderly ranks. I think that's just exaggeration—they can't necessarily surpass the elites under Commander He!"

"Indeed. Setting aside guns and firearms, the Hair Bandits are not skilled in strike-and-stab maneuvers. They rely merely on sturdy ships and sharp cannons." Gou Chengxuan was also awed by the imposingly magnificent review. He said this half to flatter Qian Taichong, half in genuine conviction. Witnessing the grand army's momentum, Gou Chengxuan felt that sweeping away the ugly Hair Bandit kind would be no problem whatsoever.

The review concluded. At that moment, a yellow flag was raised on the General's Platform, and the drums rumbled again. All officers and soldiers suddenly opened their throats, releasing an earth-shattering shout. With a gong's clang, the drill ground fell instantly silent once more.

"They're going to drill formations!" Qian Taichong said excitedly.

Before long, a Lieutenant Colonel hurried to the Commander's Platform and presented a formation book to Zhao Ruyi with both hands.

The drums beat rapidly again. The troops, originally arrayed in square formations, began running at speed. Square formations transformed into snake-like columns in the blink of an eye. Qian Taichong observed that this formation change was not only swift but also orderly and precise, without the slightest confusion. He couldn't help silently exclaiming *Excellent!* Commander-in-Chief He was worthy of his reputation as a veteran general; his troops were truly elite!

Then, with changes in gongs, drums, and flags, the several thousand men continuously executed formation changes, drilling battle arrays. The drum sounds rose and fell as formations shifted again and again: sometimes the Long Snake Array, sometimes the Two Yi Array, sometimes the Tai Chi Array, sometimes the Interlinked Array, sometimes the Wheel Suspension Array... They cycled through more than a dozen configurations in succession. Several thousand armored soldiers carrying weapons ran back and forth in the dust for nearly two hours.

Qian Taichong's eyes grew wide, and his interest soared. A heroic, aspiring feeling rose from the depths of his heart, and he couldn't help shouting aloud: "I invite you to temporarily ascend the Lingyan Pavilion—which scholar will become a Marquis of ten thousand households!"

Gou Chengxuan was startled, thinking the man had gone mad. He hurriedly edged several steps away.

The drill continued.

...

Just as they watched spellbound, on a not-too-distant hill, a large high-power telescope was also observing the lively scene on the drill ground.

Telegrams were continuously transmitted via radio to the Field Army Headquarters established at Maniao.

"Enemy total scale: twenty-two thousand. Main force approximately eight thousand."

"Enemy includes roughly two thousand village militia."

"Twenty Red Barbarian Cannons."

...

A video camera fitted with a high-power telephoto lens filmed the entire drilling process of the government army. That night, He Ming and all officers of battalion level and above watched the video flash drive delivered by Special Reconnaissance Team members at the headquarters in Maniao. Two team members had traveled on foot at forced march pace from Qiongshan to Chengmai, where Yu Zhiqian personally drove them to Maniao on a motorcycle.

As the magnificent military drill appeared on the screen, everyone gradually became transfixed, and discussion began:

"Truly magnificent! A hundred thousand *li* better than any historical blockbuster movie!" Dongmen Chuiyu said with surprise.

"The head-chopping scene alone was spectacular. Five heads fell at once! Just like slaughtering chickens!"

"He Rubin's main force is quite elite! The marching isn't bad—just not uniform enough."

"This large-scale group calisthenics is far inferior to North Korea's."

...

After everyone had offered mixed commentary, the consensus emerged that the individual quality of Ming soldiers was acceptable, and the army's overall morale was not bad—but the content of their drill was obviously antiquated and obsolete.

"They're still playing with formation changes like group gymnastics. In truth, things like the Long Snake Array are essentially useless even in this timeline now, purely formalistic. As for human pyramids, somersaults, and the like, they're basically no different from acrobatics."

"Regardless of what they practice, according to the people at the Great Library, after the Grand Review and Sacrifice to the Flag, troop deployment is imminent. We should move out as well." He Ming said. "Tomorrow, serve breakfast according to Class A standards! Departure at 0600 sharp. Now let's synchronize watches." He raised his wrist.

"Everyone get some rest. There are still a few hours until dawn—get a good sleep. We have many things to do in Chengmai tomorrow. Dismissed!"

At 5:30 AM, He Ming rose from his straw pallet and dressed. His orderly brought face-washing water. As soon as he finished washing, he quickly ate the porridge his orderly had brought. Upon finishing breakfast, he immediately ordered: "Beat drums and blow horns!"

Instantly, the drummers on duty outside his tent beat the drums to transmit the order. In a moment, the sound of bugles and war drums resounded through the sky. The entire Maniao camp erupted into activity.

Five minutes later, the drumbeat for "Start Engines/Load Wagons" sounded. At once, the tents of officers and soldiers were all struck and rolled up. Another ten minutes later, the advance troops beat the combat march drum—the 1st Infantry Battalion had already departed.

The soldiers marched continuously for five hours. Stragglers were collected by the rearguard. At noon, they rested briefly by the roadside for lunch; everyone ate dry rations. Twenty minutes later, the troops resumed their advance. After five o'clock in the afternoon, the sea breeze carried a tantalizing aroma of food.

Navy ships had already delivered field kitchens to the Chengmai Grand Camp several hours in advance. Now, on the leveled ground, field kitchens released curling wisps of blue smoke. From the insulated cauldrons with their tightly sealed lids came the fragrance of rice and "mess stew"—the latter being a specific mixture of vegetables and meat stewed together.

The exhausted soldiers caught the scent and felt their spirits lift. They quickened their pace toward the pre-established campsite.

After You Laohu finalized the Chengmai battle plan at the Staff Department, the remaining companies he had left at Maniao also moved to positions beneath Chengmai County seat, forming an encirclement around the county. The Engineering Team began large-scale battlefield construction. A camp capable of accommodating ten thousand men was ready.

Tian Liang led his company into the campsite. He had been unexpectedly promoted to Second Lieutenant during this army expansion. Although it had been less than three years from enlistment to Second Lieutenant—which the Crossing Group considered rocket-speed advancement—in his own view, his promotion had been painfully slow.

Among his contemporaries from back then, the fastest, Ruan Xiao'er, had already become a Navy Lieutenant. Even among those promoted to Corporal in the same batch in the Army, many had already advanced to Army First Lieutenant. Yet his own turn for officer promotion had never come.

Of course, being an officer was better than being an NCO. Not only was the treatment a grade higher, but his status when walking in public was also quite different. Just having that clanking officer's command saber hanging at his waist meant everyone would look at him a few times more when he walked down the street. Tian Liang had long wanted to hang a command saber and visit Guo Fu at Bairen General Hospital. In his heart, he had long regarded Guo Fu as his wife.

But for more than two years, except for a few accidental encounters on the road, he had not seen this companion with whom he had wandered and begged in the old days, nor had he spoken with her even once. Tian Liang felt that every time he glimpsed Guo Fu, she was more beautiful than before. Especially that form-fitting blue dress outlining her exquisite figure—it had given him sleepless nights on several occasions.

He had begun to feel ashamed of his inadequacy, believing that as a mere NCO he couldn't match Guo Fu. His desire to become an officer had grown more urgent than ever.

Although Tian Liang's ambition for promotion was great, he also recognized that his learning ability was poor. He couldn't even memorize a copy of *Infantry Drill Regulations*, and he always ranked near the bottom in every military skills assessment. If not for this army expansion, heaven knows when he would have served out his time as a "Ten-Thousand-Year Sergeant."

The prospect of fighting the government army didn't frighten him at all. Tian Liang had remained in the Fubo Army for over two years and clearly understood that the Fubo Army's advantages were far beyond what the government army could compare with. His soldiers had undergone extensive training, were familiar with their weapons, and brimmed with confidence in these powerful arms. They had also been repeatedly indoctrinated by Wei Aiwen and others, instilled with a strong consciousness of "when drinking water, don't forget the well-digger"—deeply aware that defending the Lingao regime meant defending their own interests. Moreover, widely publicized stories about the government army's defeats in Liaodong and the interior, along with their looting and killing of innocent people to claim credit, had made the soldiers both hate and despise the government forces.

After being promoted to officer, the first time he hung on his command saber and changed into officer's epaulets, he had gone excitedly to Bairen General Hospital to find Guo Fu—only to receive the news that she had already been transferred to Sanya.

This news left him depressed for a long time. He knew Sanya; it lay at the southernmost tip of Hainan Island, separated from here by several hundred *li*. Even by boat, the journey took seven days. As a soldier, it was impossible to travel to such a distant place without leave.

He had to abandon, for the moment, any thought of meeting Guo Fu.

For this fight against the government army, he was determined to distinguish himself no matter what and earn a medal—preferably Third Class Merit or above. That would partially raise his salary. Add the Third Class Merit bonus to his own savings, and he could roughly manage a down payment...

While he let his imagination run wild, he completely forgot the work at hand. Only when the company commander's messenger came to ask why the camp unloading work hadn't started did he panic and hurriedly take his men to arrange it.
