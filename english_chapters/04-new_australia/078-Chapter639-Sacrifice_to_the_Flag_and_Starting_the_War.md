# Chapter 639 Sacrifice to the Flag and Starting the War

By now it was fully light. The principal civil and military officials and local celebrities of Qiongzhou Prefecture and Hainan Circuit arrived one after another. Sedans and horses arrived continuously. The area around the earthen platform became a gathering place for black gauze caps and square scholar hats. They must have felt extremely honored and excited to personally attend today's grand ceremony, exchanging reserved greetings while craning their necks to look around, waiting for the Commander-in-Chief to appear.

On the earthen platform, two tiger-skin chairs had already been set up. One was for He Rubin, the Regional Commander guarding Guangdong; the other was for Zhao Ruyi, the Left Assistant Administration Commissioner and Intendant of Hainan Circuit serving as Army Supervisor.

Suddenly, a burst of horns sounded, and the retinues of He Rubin and Zhao Ruyi began to enter the drill ground. The two dismounted in front of the earthen platform and ascended it surrounded by a crowd of attendants.

Below the earthen platform on all four sides were He Rubin's personal officers, personal soldiers, and house guards, totaling fully three or four hundred men. Each was helmeted and armored, swords and spears aligned, waiting in full battle array. Surrounded by generals and private secretaries, He Rubin and Zhao Ruyi had already taken their seats on the folding chairs in the center. He Rubin was leaning sideways saying something to Zhao Ruyi. Zhao Ruyi sat calmly, slightly raising his long, thin face, stroking his three strands of clear beard, only nodding slightly, appearing cold and conceited. On their two sides, two rows of higher-status civil and military officials and private secretaries stood according to the custom of "Civil on the Left, Military on the Right." Customarily, they all dropped their hands and held their breath, putting on a respectful and solemn appearance.

On the drill ground, many troops had already gathered. The local gentry invited to attend stroked their beards and uttered sounds of surprised admiration. They discussed in low voices, pointing at the various flags fluttering on the drill ground, no one able to figure out exactly how many troops there were.

The older ones among them could still vaguely remember the grand occasion of the Government Army crossing the sea to suppress bandits during the Ma Shi Campaign in the Wanli reign. This time seemed no inferior to back then—the Government Army crossing the sea claimed to be fifty thousand strong.

Among the troops gathered here, excluding He Rubin's Governor's Standard and house guards, and parts of the Viceroy's Standard and Governor's Standard, a total of four Lieutenant Colonels and one Guerrilla General of the Guangdong Ming Army had arrived in Qiongshan: the Chaozhou Lieutenant Colonel, Qiongya Lieutenant Colonel, Leilian Lieutenant Colonel, and the Guangdong Training Guerrilla General.

These five generals were different from the empty-titled Assistant Regional Commanders, Lieutenant Colonels, and Guerrilla Generals that became increasingly rampant in the late Ming; they were solid regular military officers with defense sectors and titles. Basically, the entire main force of Guangdong, except for the Eastern and Western Mountain Lieutenant Colonels guarding against the Yao people, had turned out in full force. The officials, gentry, and commoners of Qiongzhou hadn't seen such a battle array for decades.

Gou Chengxuan watched from a distance on the hillside; his position was high, so he could see very clearly. As he was watching, he heard someone shouting repeatedly:

"Injustice! Injustice! This lowly one is a good commoner!"

他 was slightly started and looked back. It turned out to be several prisoners, stripped to the waist, bound with ropes, and covered in torture scars. They were being escorted by several soldiers, driven towards the drill ground. They staggered as they walked, shouting.

"This lowly one is an ordinary merchant, only going to Lingao to buy and sell some needles and thread. Master, spare my life!"

"This lowly one is not a spy, injustice, injustice!"

Gou Chengxuan thought spies had been caught, but the old soldier behind him whispered: "These are to be taken to have their heads chopped off as a sacrifice to the flag." Then he sighed, "Heard they are all small traders, arrested for having been to Lingao."

"Oh, so they went to do business with the Hair Bandits! They should be killed!" Gou Chengxuan suddenly screamed. If not for so many people coveting the Hair Bandits' petty profits, how could the Hair Bandits be so rampant and gather over ten thousand men? He heard that when the Gou Family Manor was broken, many people from Yanchang Village went too, helping the Hair Bandits move weapons. After the stockade was broken, they had a share in moving the Gou Family Manor's property and even dismantling houses. Returning to Lingao this time, he must slaughter the whole Yanchang Village, leaving not one alive! He thought to himself, *Even the women cannot be allowed to live!*

"Although somewhat unjust, it is also bringing ruin upon themselves!" A voice said not far away. Gou Chengxuan turned his head to look; this person was none other than Zhao Ruyi's private secretary, Qian Taichong. Gou Chengxuan hurriedly flattered: "What Brother implies is extremely true!"

Qian Taichong snorted coldly; he looked down on this stripped scholar somewhat. He didn't go to the drill ground today—his degree was too low, and he had no official position. On the drill ground, he could only stand far away to attend. Qian Taichong was a person of high ambition and arrogance; how could he stand such slight? He might as well watch the excitement here in the Central Army camp.

He always thought highly of himself, knowing that Zhao Ruyi was willing to hire him as a private secretary not out of admiration for his moral articles, but because of the face of a fellow villager's introduction. Arriving in this distinct southern barbarian land of Qiongzhou, before he could come up with any measures to display his skills and make people look at him with new eyes, he was sent away by Assistant Administration Commissioner Zhao to Guangzhou—obviously not taking him seriously.

In several strategy meetings on suppressing bandits, Qian Taichong had always been eager to try, wanting to offer a few stratagems to win everyone's respect. But he had no military experience to speak of, nor had he read military books. Even arm-chair strategies were beyond his reach. He could only talk big about people's hearts and morale, annoying everyone.

Originally, he wouldn't bother with someone like Gou Chengxuan, but intending to distinguish himself in the aftermath affairs of the Lingao war, he had to show some courtesy to this rare Lingao local.

"They just coveted some small profits, so they went to Lingao to do business. Insisting they are Hair Bandit spies is indeed a bit excessive," Qian Taichong said. "However, precisely because rural commoners fear punishment, they must be awed with severe punishment! If allowed to drift with the waves chasing profit without punishment, other foolish people will view the government as soft and easily bullied, following suit one after another. Within a year or half, people's hearts will surely change greatly. Before the Hair Bandits rebel, Qiongzhou would no longer be ours!"

He spoke with such soaring heroism that Gou Chengxuan could only listen respectfully. He agreed very much with the point about commoners fearing punishment and chasing profit. Just as he was pondering what to say to satisfy him, suddenly the signal cannon sounded again.

The several prisoners from just now were pushed and shoved under the flagpole on the drill ground. These commoners included small merchants traveling to and from Lingao, and also people who carelessly said a few good words about the Hair Bandits in Qiongzhou. All were arrested as Hair Bandit spies.

They were shouted at to kneel. Several executioners came over. With the sound of the signal cannon, several bloody heads fell one by one, placed under the flagpole.

Immediately after, twenty-four large war drums began to beat. The drum sound was deep, the rhythm concise and unadorned; instead, it possessed an awe-inspiring power. When beaten to a high pitch, even heaven and earth seemed to shake. With the soul-shaking drum sound and the suddenly sounding horns, a red flag was raised on the Commander's Platform.

The army gathered in the distance like dark clouds began to move slowly. Like the faint thunder before a rainstorm, the soldiers' footsteps became magnificent. Swordsmen holding large sabers, archers carrying bows and arrows, spearmen with long spears pointing obliquely at the sky, musketeers carrying three-eyed guns and bird guns... Team after team marched over in orderly steps according to fixed formations. Countless flags fluttered in the smoke and dust kicked up by the soldiers.

Horns sobbed, drums rumbled. The troops participating in the review were the most elite part of the sea-crossing Ming Army, totaling seven thousand men. Armor and weapons were neat, equipment excellent, quite possessing an overwhelming momentum.

It was the first time in Qian Taichong's life participating in such a large-scale military review. He became excited involuntarily, his heart trembling slightly from nervousness. He gripped the fan in his hand tightly, staring intently at the troops marching in the smoke and dust.

*This army is actually capable of a fight!* Qian Taichong thought. *The Court still has elite soldiers and capable generals.* The government troops he saw on his travels as a private secretary were either exhausted soldiers and lazy pawns or arrogant soldiers and fierce generals. Now seeing such elite troops, he couldn't help but feel greatly reassured about this bandit suppression, feeling victory was just a matter of time.

"Everyone says the Hair Bandits have strict discipline and orderly ranks. I think they are just so-so, not necessarily able to surpass the elites under Commander He!"

"Yes, aside from guns and firearms, the Hair Bandits are not skilled in striking and stabbing steps. They merely rely on strong ships and sharp cannons." Gou Chengxuan was also shocked by this astonishingly imposing grand review. He said this half to flatter Qian Taichong and half sincerely. Seeing such momentum of the grand army, Gou Chengxuan felt that wiping out the ugly Hair Bandit kind would be no problem.

The review ended. At this time, a yellow flag was raised on the General's Platform, and the drums rumbled again. All officers and soldiers suddenly opened their throats, releasing an earth-shaking shout. With a gong sound, the drill ground instantly became silent again.

"They are going to drill formations!" Qian Taichong said excitedly.

Before long, a Lieutenant Colonel hurriedly came to the Commander's Platform and presented a formation book to Zhao Ruyi with both hands.

The drums beat rapidly again. The troops originally lined up in square formations began to run rapidly. The square formations turned into snake-like columns in the blink of an eye. Qian Taichong saw this formation change was not only rapid but also orderly and neat, without the slightest chaos. He couldn't help but secretly shout a "Good!" *Commander-in-Chief He is worthy of being a veteran general; his troops are indeed elite!*

Then, with changes in gongs, drums, and flags, these several thousand men continuously changed formations, drilling battle arrays. The drum sounds rose and fell, and the formations changed again and again: sometimes the Long Snake Array, sometimes the Two Yi Array, sometimes the Tai Chi Array, sometimes the Interlinked Array, sometimes the Wheel Suspension Array... changing through a dozen styles in succession. Several thousand armored soldiers carrying weapons ran back and forth in the dust for nearly two hours.

Qian Taichong's eyes were opened wide, and his interest grew higher. A heroic and aspiring feeling rose from the bottom of his heart, and he couldn't help shouting: "I invite you to temporarily ascend the Lingyan Pavilion; which scholar will become a Marquis of ten thousand households!"

Gou Chengxuan was startled by him, thinking he had gone mad. He hurriedly moved a few steps away.

The drill continued.

...

Just as they watched spellbound, on a not-too-distant hill, a large high-power telescope was also watching the lively scene on the drill ground.

Telegrams were continuously transmitted via radio to the Field Army Headquarters established at Ma'niao.

"Total enemy scale twenty-two thousand. Main force about eight thousand."

"Enemy includes about two thousand village militia."

"Twenty Red Barbarian Cannons."

...

A video camera installed with a high-power telephoto lens filmed the entire drilling process of the Government Army. That night, He Ming and all officers above battalion level watched the video USB drive sent by the Special Reconnaissance Team members at the headquarters in Ma'niao. Two members traveled from Qiongshan to Chengmai on foot at forced march speed, then were driven to Ma'niao by Yu Zhiqian personally on a motorcycle.

As the magnificent military drill appeared on the screen, everyone gradually became entranced watching it, and began to discuss:

"Truly magnificent! Much better than any historical blockbuster movie by a hundred and eight thousand *li*!" Dongmen Chuiyu said in surprise.

"Yeah, just that head-chopping scene was very spectacular. Five heads fell off at once! Simply like killing chickens!"

"He Rubin's main force is still quite elite! The marching isn't bad, just not uniform enough."

"This large-scale group gymnastics is far worse than North Korea's."

...

After everyone discussed with mixed tongues, they believed that the individual quality of Ming soldiers was okay, and the army's overall morale wasn't bad, but the content of the drill was obviously outdated and obsolete.

"They are still playing with formation changes like group gymnastics. Actually, things like the Long Snake Array are not of much use even in this space-time now, purely formalistic. As for human pyramids, somersaults, and the like, they are basically almost the same as acrobatics."

"Regardless of what they practice, according to the group at the Great Library, after the Grand Review and Sacrifice to the Flag, deploying troops is just around the corner. We should move out too." He Ming said, "Tomorrow, supply breakfast according to Class A standards! Move out at 6 o'clock sharp. Now let's synchronize watches," he said, raising his hand.

"Everyone hurry to rest. There are still a few hours before dawn to get a good sleep. We still have many things to do in Chengmai tomorrow. Dismissed!"

At 5:30 AM, He Ming got up from his straw pallet and dressed. His orderly brought him face-washing water. As soon as washing was finished, he quickly ate the porridge brought by the orderly. Upon finishing breakfast, he immediately ordered: "Beat drums and blow horns!"

Immediately, the drummers on duty outside his tent beat the drums to transmit the order. In an instant, the sound of bugles and war drums resounded through the skies. The entire Ma'niao camp boiled over.

Five minutes later, the drumbeat for "Start Engines/Load Wagons" sounded. Instantly, the tents of officers and soldiers were all struck and rolled up. Another ten minutes later, the advance troops beat the combat march drum—the 1st Infantry Battalion had already departed.

The soldiers marched continuously for five hours. Stragglers were collected by the rearguard. At noon, they rested briefly by the roadside for lunch; everyone ate dry rations. Twenty minutes later, the troops continued to advance. At past five in the afternoon, the sea breeze brought a burst of mouth-watering aroma of food.

Navy ships had already delivered field kitchens to the Chengmai Grand Camp a few hours in advance. Now on the leveled land, field kitchens emitted curling blue smoke. From the insulated pots with tightly covered lids came the aroma of rice and "mess stew"—the latter was specific vegetables and meat stewed together.

The exhausted soldiers smelled the aroma of food and their spirits lifted. They accelerated their pace to arrive at the pre-set campsite.

After You Laohu settled the Chengmai battle plan at the Staff Department, the other few companies he left at Ma'niao all moved to the foot of Chengmai County seat, forming an encirclement of Chengmai. The Engineering Team began large-scale battlefield construction activities. A camp capable of accommodating ten thousand people was ready.

Tian Liang led his company into the campsite. He was surprise-promoted to Second Lieutenant during this army expansion. Although it was less than three years from enlistment to becoming a Second Lieutenant—riding a rocket in the view of the Crossing Group—in his view, his promotion was slow to the root.

Among his contemporaries back then, Ruan Xiao'er, the fastest, was already a Navy Lieutenant. Even among those promoted to Corporal in the same batch in the Army, many had already been promoted to Army First Lieutenant. He, however, never got his turn for officer promotion.

Of course, officers were better than NCOs. Not only was the treatment a grade different, but the status when walking out was also quite different. Just with that clanking officer's command saber hanging at the waist, everyone would look a few more times when walking on the street. Tian Liang always wanted to hang a command saber and go to Bairen General Hospital to see Guo Fu. In his heart, he had long treated Guo Fu as his wife.

But for more than two years, except for accidental encounters on the road a few times, he hadn't seen this partner with whom he had wandered and begged back then, nor had he spoken to her even once. Tian Liang felt that every time he met Guo Fu, she was prettier than before. Especially that form-fitting blue dress, outlining her exquisite figure, made Tian Liang suffer insomnia for several nights.

He began to feel ashamed of his unworthiness, feeling that as a tiny NCO he couldn't match Guo Fu. He hoped to become an officer more urgently than before.

Although Tian Liang's ambition for promotion was big, he also knew his learning ability was too poor. He couldn't even memorize a copy of "Infantry Drill Regulations," and he always ranked at the bottom in every military skill assessment. If not for this army expansion, heaven knows when he would have served as a "Ten-thousand-year Sergeant."

Fighting the Government Army, he wasn't afraid at all. Tian Liang had stayed in the Fubo Army for over two years and clearly knew that the Fubo Army's advantages were far from what the Government Army could compare with. His soldiers had undergone quite a long period of training, were familiar with their weapons, and were full of confidence in these powerful weapons. They were also repeatedly brainwashed by Wei Aiwen and others, instilled with a strong consciousness of "when drinking water, don't forget the well-digger," deeply realizing that defending the Lingao regime meant defending their own interests. Moreover, widely publicized stories about the Government Army's defeats in Liaodong and the interior, and their looting and killing good people to claim credit, made soldiers both hate and despise the Government Army.

After being promoted to an officer, the first time he hung on the command saber and changed into officer epaulets, he went excitedly to Bairen General Hospital to find Guo Fu, only to receive the news that Guo Fu had already been transferred to Sanya.

This news made him depressed for a long time. He knew Sanya; it was at the southernmost tip of Hainan Island, separated from here by several hundred *li*. Even by boat, it took seven days. As a soldier, it was impossible to go to such a faraway place without leave.

He had to give up the thought of meeting Guo Fu for the moment.

Fighting the Government Army this time, he decided to perform meritorious service no matter what and get a medal, preferably Third Class Merit or above. This way his salary could be adjusted upward partially. Plus the Third Class Merit bonus and his own savings, he could roughly pay a down payment...

While he let his imagination run wild, he forgot the work in his hands completely. Until the company commander's messenger came to ask why the camp unloading work hadn't started did he panic and hurriedly took people to arrange it.
