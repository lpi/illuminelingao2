# Chapter 774 – An Unexpected Development

Yang Shixiang was stunned speechless. Opening a pharmacy in Jiangnan was something even his ancestors at the height of their prosperity had never dared contemplate. Setting aside the fact that he had no connections whatsoever in that region, there was the question of industry competition. Jiangnan was thick with established pharmacy brands, each backed by generations of secret recipes and deep pockets. Although Liu San's patent medicines brought Runshitang a steady stream of profits, wading into those muddy waters took more nerve than he possessed.

Seeing his sworn brother's hesitation, Liu San tried to embolden him. "Big Brother, with us backing you, what are you afraid of? We'll stick to the same approach: sell only patent medicines, not raw herbs. That way we stay out of entanglements with the local pharmacy bosses."

Construction of Runshitang's pharmaceutical factory in the Bairen Development Zone had been halted for several months due to the war. After the Great Victory at Chengmai, work resumed. The specialized equipment manufactured by the Machinery Plant was largely installed and now undergoing testing and trial production. Once completed, output would be twenty or thirty times higher than the current handcraft level.

The prospect of such staggering capacity made Yang Shixiang hesitate. The fearsome specter of cash-flow problems loomed directly before him. Massive production capacity meant needing huge sums to pay for raw materials, hefty freight costs to ship goods everywhere, outlets or distributors in various cities, and large inventories tied up in shops. Any problem at any link could spell catastrophe—nothing like his current trade with his cousin, selling in just two or three cities. Yang Shixiang had been full of ambition when he was down and out; now, as Lingao's wealthiest man, he had grown timid.

At the table, Li Mei had already offered to help arrange a loan. Wu Di of Delong Bank's Credit Department had reached an intermediary agreement with her, under which the Commercial Division and the East Gate Market Administration would recommend high-quality clients for lending.

Yang Shixiang remained hesitant. The Runshitang factory itself was already carrying a loan from the Australians for land, machinery, and construction, secured by the factory itself at 17% annual interest. Expanding operations would require another loan—and this one could only be collateralized with Runshitang's existing assets. It made him uneasy.

Li Mei, perceptive as ever, spoke slowly: "Don't rush. We'll take it step by step. Doesn't Runshitang still have your brother's half-share? And your brother is an Elder. We Elders are like brothers and sisters—if there's difficulty, the House of Elders will definitely help..."

Business was easy to discuss over a meal. The three took turns pressing, and Yang Shixiang finally agreed to fully cooperate with the Elders' commercial expansion plan. Yet he felt somewhat overwhelmed by such complex business strategy. He confided to Liu San that just thinking about managing operations once the scale grew gave him a headache. He hoped Liu San could become Runshitang's head manager and share his burdens; he'd even give Liu San more shares.

Liu San thought: *No matter how many shares you give me, it won't matter—they're state assets.* Besides, even if he wanted to leave for a private enterprise, the Organization Department wouldn't agree, and he himself didn't want to abandon his post in the Sanitation Department. He declined tactfully.

However, he seized the opportunity to urge Yang Shixiang to send young household servants and clerks to Fangcaodi for short-term training courses—practical-skills classes covering accounting, business management, agricultural techniques, and more. Illiterate natives would first have to take a Class-C diploma course. Per the rules, naturalized citizens could take such courses free; ordinary natives paid a tuition fee.

"Even if a few kids learn, they can't immediately become managers," Yang Shixiang sighed. "Some of my clerks are reliable enough, but their experience is limited. I'm not comfortable sending them out to run things independently."

"We can naturally help with that," Li Mei said at once. If needed, the Commercial Division would "loan" several managers to serve Runshitang—Runshitang just had to pay their salaries.

They ate, drank, and talked well into the afternoon before dispersing. The business was mostly settled; the contract signing awaited the next day. Li Mei formally extended an invitation to Yang Shixiang to attend the New Year's reception at year-end. Liu San, claiming drunkenness and the need for a nap, stayed at Runshitang. Li Mei and Jiang Shan departed tactfully.

Yang Shixiang understood his sworn brother's meaning perfectly and had him escorted to Liu San's private courtyard, where Xuan Chun was to attend him.

With the elders' assurances, Yang Shixiang's worries had settled one by one, and his spirits lightened considerably. He was about to retreat to his study for a short nap to clear his head of wine when a maid arrived: the mistress summoned him to the main chamber.

"In broad daylight? What for?" At the Yang household, as at other great families of this era, husband and wife did not meet during the day unless necessary. After the morning wash and grooming, Yang Shixiang would go to the front study, breakfast with the accountant and manager, and conduct business. His wife managed the inner quarters. They met only at evening meals, eating and retiring together. Even children, once older, lived in their own quarters and saw their mother only for morning and evening greetings. This was high-family "form"; the Yang household was no exception.

"The mistress says it's urgent. She needs to discuss something with you."

"Very well. I'll come." Yang Shixiang followed the maid into the inner quarters.

Before he had even sat down, the mistress launched at him: "Husband, do you know about Xuan Chun?"

"Know what?" Yang Shixiang was taken aback, unsure what his wife meant.

"So you really don't know!" The mistress spoke in a scolding tone.

"She's just a woman—not even our household's maid. What does her business have to do with me?" Xuan Chun was a maid belonging to the mistress's maternal cousin. Strictly speaking, she was a "guest"—by household rules, she had no connection to the Yang family.

"Today, Third Sister sent word that Xuan Chun... is with child..." The mistress lowered her voice conspiratorially.

"With child? With what?" Yang Shixiang said carelessly—then suddenly comprehended. "You mean she's pregnant?"

"Mm!" The mistress nodded. "Third Sister wants us to decide—what to do about Xuan Chun? It was your idea to have her attend Little Brother. Now that she's carrying, she can't just remain in limbo indefinitely."

"Mm, mm." Yang Shixiang hadn't thought about the possibility of Xuan Chun getting pregnant when he'd hatched his scheme to ingratiate himself with his sworn brother. With his easygoing disposition, he took his time before saying, "Is this confirmed? Has a pulse been taken?"

"She's missed her monthly for two months. What pulse is there to take?"

"But... when a woman's menses fail to appear, it doesn't necessarily mean pregnancy. As for qi and blood—"

"Enough—don't recite the medical texts. If you don't believe it, go take her pulse yourself." The mistress was exasperated.

"I'll examine her tonight," Yang Shixiang nodded. "But sworn brother's diagnostic skills surpass mine—he probably already knows."

"When a man and woman are together, this was bound to happen sooner or later. Now that it has happened, you'd better discuss with Little Brother soon how to handle Xuan Chun."

"Do the dates match?" Yang Shixiang was suddenly alarmed—this was no trivial matter!

"Yes. I checked the guest register and counted the days. Those nights, Little Brother did indeed stay over."

"Good, good!"

"What are you worried about? Is the inner courtyard a place just any man can enter?" The mistress complained. "Third Sister's young master is only nine. Surely you're not suspecting him?"

"Madam, in matters like this, not the slightest carelessness is allowed!" Yang Shixiang whispered. "If there's any mistake, it won't just be a joke—it could become a serious incident."

The Australians were practically emperors of Lingao now—and by the look of things, they would soon be emperors of all Qiongzhou Prefecture. They held the power of life and death.

The mistress looked nervous. "I understand! I have already inquired privately—there is absolutely no irregularity."

Yang Shixiang thought it over. The ideal solution, of course, would be for his sworn brother to take Xuan Chun home as a concubine. Keeping another man's woman in one's own house was never a long-term arrangement—especially with a child on the way! But Liu San's wife was an Elder, and rumor had it she was a jealous shrew. Liu San might not dare. If the matter blew up, even the Yang household might suffer.

Yang Shixiang grew tense—but then he reflected that female elders were few, and Liu San had mentioned his wife was "idle," not someone with power. Yang Shixiang was a "close partner" of the House of Elders; they wouldn't do anything drastic to him.

Since he had already offended Liu San's wife, he had better curry favor all the harder with Liu San—to avoid coming up empty! Yang Shixiang made up his mind:

"I think the proper approach is to keep her at our house and let her give birth. She'll be the equivalent of a brother's 'outside residence'..."

The mistress complained, "You're muddled. An outside residence located at someone else's home? This mother and child living with us, without status or title—how will we face people?"

Yang Shixiang thought again. "Then we'll purchase a separate dwelling in the city. Move Xuan Chun there first, then assign a few reliable, elderly servants to accompany her—all expenses on us! After that, the rest is sworn brother's own family affair."

The mistress nodded. "That's the only way. But we'll also need to give Third Sister an explanation—Xuan Chun is still her household's person."

Xuan Chun's owners had fallen on such hard times that they depended on the Yang family for their living; they couldn't question any decision the Yangs made. Even so, face among relatives still had to be observed.

Yang Shixiang thought it over and said carelessly, "We'll just buy Xuan Chun outright—transfer her indenture. That will spare them any awkwardness."
