# Chapter 738 - Ransom Fee

Although Li Fengjie felt it feasible, the thought of incurring such a massive debt made him shake his head repeatedly: "Borrowing means repaying, plus interest—it's a huge sum!"

"In a few days, the Autumn Tax collection begins. A little floating surcharge per *mu* will smooth it out," He Chengzong said. "If the Bandits don't leave, the Autumn Tax will also face big trouble..."

This last sentence moved Li Fengjie. Everything in local government revolved around tax, the Court's primary concern. If the Bandits stayed on Henan Island, sending men to collect grain and silver daily, how could the November Autumn Tax be collected? He Chengzong was right; collecting the Autumn Grain would cover the 300,000 tael hole.

However, 300,000 taels was no small figure. Thinking of shouldering this debt for no reason, Li Fengjie's mood was unpleasant.

Why did such a thankless task fall on him! These Australians had too big an appetite! Thinking this, he decided to haggle with them, at least chopping off eighty or a hundred thousand.

He gave no commitment to He Chengzong's suggestion, dismissing him for now.

He Chengzong felt baffled. The next day, Gao Ju visited to ask for the Governor's final decision so he could send Manager Yan across the river to interview at night.

"His Excellency is noncommittal," He Chengzong said. "Neither said yes nor no."

"Presumably His Excellency needs to deliberate." Gao Ju laughed. Not saying "yes" actually meant "no." Most likely the Governor still harbored thoughts of bargaining. He sneered secretly: this is called refusing a toast to drink a forfeit.

Indeed, in the following days, Li Fengjie prepared for war in Guangzhou, conscripting militia and positioning cannons, putting on a "fight to the death" posture that confused everyone. He Chengzong thought his employer truly intended to "live and die with the city," and worried greatly, admonishing him several times, only to be blocked by Li Fengjie's lukewarm responses.

Gao Ju knew the Governor was posturing for the Bandits outside, hoping to intimate them into loosening the ransom fee.

Sure enough, a day later, Li Fengjie asked Gao Ju to go to Lotus Vihara to continue talks.

"Your Excellency, if there isn't an explanation regarding the Ransom Fee, I fear going again will yield no results."

"You are a merchant; do you buy at whatever price others ask?" Li Fengjie was dissatisfied with Gao Ju's attitude.

"Your Excellency," Gao Ju said respectfully, "It depends on the goods. If it's a rare commodity to hoard, of course I buy at the asking price."

"Fine, fine. Go tell the Bandits: 300,000 silver is too much; the city can't produce it. Ask them to reduce it."

"How much does Your Excellency think is appropriate..."

"This... depends on your ability, doesn't it?" Li Fengjie sneered.

"Yes, yes, this lowly one will do his utmost."

This attitude naturally caused dissatisfaction among the Task Force high command. Originally, some Senators demanded large-scale rocket attacks on Guangzhou to severely dampen the prestige of Guangdong bureaucrats. But a group including Wen Desi strongly opposed—not out of "protecting cultural relics," but because Guangzhou, like all Chinese cities then, was brick-and-wood. Indiscriminate Hale Rocket bombardment would inevitably cause massive fires, potentially burning the whole city.

Guangzhou was one of China's wealthiest cities. A city-wide fire would burn untold wealth and kill useful human resources. Many wealthy merchants would go bankrupt. Transmigrators wouldn't be able to use the city for years after the war.

Now, Li Fengjie's attitude brought the bombardment idea back to the surface. Several Senators demanded a "force demonstration."

Wen Desi probably felt it necessary to demonstrate military power too—"seeing is believing," lest bureaucrats hiding in the city lacked a visceral impression of Transmigrator force. He approved the plan to shell the South City. To avoid massive life and property loss, targets were primarily South City defensive facilities and the relay station, reception hall, and piers near the main South Gate.

On the night of November 7th, the Fubo Army fired over 200 Hale rockets from pre-set positions and Bombardment Boats, completely destroying many defensive facilities, the relay station, and reception hall near the main South Gate. Defending soldiers and militia fell into chaos. Bombardment Boats also concentrated fire on the majestic three-story tower over the main South Gate. Under concentrated bombardment of nearly 40 Hale rockets, the brick-and-wood tower soon erupted in raging flames, burning all night.

Per Chen Haiyang's order, several rockets were fired into the administrative district deep in the city to demonstrate range.

Li Fengjie spent a nightmare night. When dense rockets began pounding the South City, setting fire to the reception hall and relay station, and finally the gate tower, he thought the Bandits were storming the city. He rushed toward the South Gate with staff. Before arriving, fleeing soldiers and militia blocked the road. Faces blackened by smoke, panicked, pushing and crawling through streets, ignoring officers. When the crowd cleared, he dared not go further—those terrifying Australian fire meteors fell from the sky continuously; getting hit meant death.

"Go, back to the Yamen!" Li Fengjie ordered. Guards and servants hustled him back to the Governor's Yamen, summoning 200 troops for reserve. Li Fengjie climbed the corner tower, gazing at the South Gate direction—flames raged, reddening half the sky, a terrifying sight. A thought flashed: if Bandits broke the city now, he would commit suicide in the Yamen immediately.

Just then, a dozen rockets streaked across the night sky like continuous meteors, flying straight into the city's deep areas, landing in streets and offices with booming explosions and fire.

Gongs sounded everywhere; militia and water-brigades rushed to fight fires. Fortunately, few rockets landed there, and fires were extinguished quickly without major damage. But such shooting caused greater panic.

Li Fengjie couldn't stay inside or outside. Death falling from the sky brought unprecedented terror—previously, hiding behind thick walls meant safety from any slaughter outside. Now, high thick walls couldn't protect his life like before.

Fortunately, the Bandits showed no sign of assaulting. Over an hour later, the rocket attack stopped. Only then did fleeing officials and soldiers dare return to the South Gate to fight the fire.

The day after this attack, Gao Ju exited the city and agreed to all Wen Desi's demands.

As for raising silver, Li Fengjie had no choice but to adopt He Chengzong's "borrowing" plan—survive the immediate crisis first.

The next day, He Chengzong visited Gao Ju's mansion, explaining the method. Gao Ju was a leading figure among foreign merchants; his attitude influenced many.

Gao Ju remained noncommittal. He lifted his eyelids slightly, surprised He Chengzong thought of this. Gao Ju had already prepared a method derived from "borrowing" for Li Fengjie. However, Gao Ju's loan had a charter: how to borrow, repay, interest rate—all calculated in his mind. He didn't say it yesterday to avoid suspicion—merchants considered government credit poor; if the loan defaulted, peers would curse him for "sucking up to superiors," ruining his reputation.

Gao Ju had been calculating how to suggest this to Li Fengjie. Now that he came knocking, it couldn't be better.

"This is 300,000 taels." Gao Ju tapped the tea table with his fan. "No one has ever lent such a huge sum."

"Of course, so we ask Elder Gao to exert effort, using reason to unite the merchants. If every household shares some, it's easy."

Gao Ju smiled slightly. He Chengzong's thinking was still government "apportionment" and "donation." Actually, if the profit was high enough, any amount could be borrowed. Mr. He hadn't grasped this principle. He deliberately postured: "This matter is likely difficult."

"I know it's difficult. But is there another way to raise 300,000 taels?" He Chengzong smiled bitterly. "Bandit ships circle the Provincial River daily, clearly intending to strike Guangzhou if unpaid. This is also for the city's common people."

Gao Ju nodded: "I understand." He added: "Loans must be repaid. There must be a charter: how to borrow, how to repay; what interest, what term? State it first to see if it works?"

"Borrow 400,000—besides ransom, we must compensate Australian enterprise losses, at least twenty or thirty thousand. Bandits looted heavily; comforting the locale costs money—finally, the Capital and Palace need bribes to avoid trouble." He Chengzong sighed. "A victory means rewarding troops and cheap aftermath costs. A defeat means endless expenses."

From the fall of Humen, 60,000 taels had been spent from the Provincial Treasury and county quotas alone. But money spent included not just treasury allocation, but "Assisting Rations" from merchants, conscripted labor and materials, militia bounties...

How much silver this "Defense of Guangzhou" consumed was a muddled account. And finally, this 300,000 "Ransom Fee"!

Though He Chengzong didn't know the saying "Victory is always cheaper," he fully realized failure meant spending more money. It solidified his potential future stance as a "Pro-Peace Party" or "Surrender Party."

Gao Ju thought: of the extra 100,000 in the 400,000, surely there were various uses, but a large part was definitely "padding"—benefits for officials to divide. Before borrowing started, the graft account was ready. He felt disdain.

However, as long as it was profitable and repayment ensured, he didn't care how officials invented names to get money—if they were all clear as water, Gao Ju couldn't do business.

"40,000... 50,000... let's not discuss amount first. Just ask: what interest, how long, how to pay interest and principal? Without a clear statement, I cannot persuade others."

He Chengzong had thought about this: "Annual interest 1.3%. Term one year. Principal and interest paid at maturity."

Gao Ju spoke slowly: "Mr. He! This charter, Gao cannot sell."

He Chengzong cursed "profit-minded villain" silently, but needing him, asked patiently: "In Elder Gao's view?"

"I have no 'view'," Gao Ju said. "Borrowing isn't tax collection where you say what goes. Borrowing implies mutual willingness." He coughed. A beautiful maid knelt to present an enamel spittoon.

Gao Ju spat, took a colored Australian small towel from another maid to wipe his mouth, and drank hot tea.

"...Annual interest 1.3%? If 300,000 taels were available at that rate, Gao himself would want to borrow it."

He Chengzong knew Gao found it low. Alert, he asked carefully: "What rate does Elder Gao think suitable?"

"To be honest," Gao Ju said, "Inter-bank lending, even in off-seasons, is 2% to 2.4% annually. Now, given the Governor's face, 1.8% is the minimum."

Gao Ju stated his demands: One-year term. First six months interest only; second six months repaying principal monthly in six installments. Cleared in 12th month.

Nominally borrowing for a year, but principal repayment started from month seven. The actual interest was much higher than maturity payment.

However, this suited the government fiscal state. He Chengzong knew producing 470,000 taels at once was impossible for Guangdong. Piecemeal was easier.

"This works." He Chengzong nodded. "But it needs the Governor's approval."

"Naturally." Gao Ju nodded, asking, "Repaid with what?"

"From the Autumn Tax, of course. A few cents floating surcharge per *mu* covers it. If Elder Gao tells merchants this, would they distrust the whole province's land tax as guarantee?"

Gao Ju sighed: "Brother He! You have a scholar's view. Borrowing requires first a written receipt, second a collateral guarantee. With just your words, who puts up money?"

He Chengzong was baffled. Wasn't the Governor's word enough? In Guangdong, few words carried such weight.

"Isn't the Governor's Yamen's credibility enough?"

"Sure, but the proof?" Gao Ju saw he didn't get it and spoke plainly. "Governor Li benefits the people and works hard; what if he's busy and forgets? Are we lenders to hang ourselves?"

He Chengzong had no answer. Officials defaulting wasn't unheard of.

"...Even with a receipt, there must be collateral." Gao Ju laughed. "One day Governor Li gets promoted, money unpaid, and a new official comes saying 'I didn't borrow it, I don't care.' We'd hang ourselves again."

He Chengzong knew Gao spoke truth, but collateral... He was troubled. Yamen issuing receipts was unheard of; if one leaked to a Censor, Li Fengjie was done for.

Gao Ju knew receipts probably wouldn't happen, but he had another plan.

"A Yamen receipt is the best guarantee, of course. But having a collateral object is enough."

Gao Ju proposed Salt Licenses as collateral. Collateralize Salt Licenses equivalent to total principal and interest, plus some salt weight for transport/sales costs. Salt Licenses were the government's most credit-worthy securities; merchants would accept them.

"Salt Licenses are usable immediately and resellable. What if unscrupulous merchants sell them early?"

"Not hard. Stamp the licenses: valid only after Month X Day Y—the final repayment date," Gao Ju said. "When repaying, let people bring licenses to exchange for silver."

"Excellent method." He Chengzong was convinced. Gao Ju indeed had tricks. The two negotiated secretly for hours, finally reaching an agreement.

No draft or written record was made, but mutual assurances guaranteed no reneging. The agreed method:

1.  Total loan: 400,000 Kuping Taels; Gao Ju leads merchant subscription.
2.  Annual interest 1.8%. First 6 months interest only, last 6 months monthly principal repayment. Cleared in one year.
3.  Loan secured by equivalent Salt Licenses from Governor's Yamen. Plus 3% premium. Licenses stamped with date limit. Returned monthly to Yamen upon repayment.

He Chengzong reported the three articles to Li Fengjie. Hearing of using Salt Licenses, Li Fengjie thought Gao Ju had clever ideas and agreed to all.

Raising silver took time. Fearing more rocket attacks, Li Fengjie ordered 100,000 taels temporarily drawn from the provincial treasury, escorted by specialists to the Australian camp at night. Yan Little-Hat accompanied them, asking Wen and Chen for three days' grace to raise the rest.
