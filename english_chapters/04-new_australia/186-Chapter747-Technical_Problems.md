# Chapter 747 - Technical Problems

Whether *Tieli Mu* (Ironwood/Mesua ferrea) was the so-called *Tie Li Mu* (Lignum Vitae/Guaiacum) meant by Meng De was a question no one knew the answer to. As for the *Tieli Mu* in the timber yard, everyone looked at it but couldn't make heads or tails of it. Finally, they decided to consult Fa Shilu of the Agriculture Ministry—he counted as the most professional botanist in the Senate.

"It should be the same thing." Fa Shilu said, "This is a tropical and subtropical tree species, common in the mountainous areas of Yunnan and Guangxi; Guangdong also has it. It is often used in Guangdong furniture of this spacetime. Not considered particularly precious."

"Lin Xianming said this is the best timber for shipbuilding, and there isn't much left now."

"From the demand of shipbuilding, *Tieli Mu* is of course scarce, but for furniture making, there is plenty. Even in the Qing Dynasty and nowadays, it isn't considered particularly precious." Fa Shilu said, calling out to an indigenous lab technician wearing a grey coat, "Bring the *Tieli Mu* sample!"

A few minutes later, the lab technician brought a specimen box. Fa Shilu opened it to show everyone:

"This is a trunk sample of *Tieli Mu*. How is it? Feels a bit oily, right? The oil content of *Tieli Mu* is very high; seed oil content is 79%, almost usable as an oil crop. Moreover, its wood fiber is especially long, very hard to cut. Its strength is among the best in trees. Not only can it build ships, but it can also be used to make some mechanical parts. Many of our towed artillery gun carriages, frames, and wheels are made of this. Although processing is a bit troublesome, the strength is great."

Fa Shilu spoke with fervor and assurance to the group of shipbuilding personnel in a lecturing tone.

"In the end, can *Tieli Mu* be used as ship bearings or not?" Jiang Ye waited for his harangue to end before asking carefully.

"This, is not my specialty." Fa Shilu said, "Speaking of mechanics, isn't that your expertise?"

The crowd who came to consult almost vomited blood. Didn't this equate to asking nothing?

On the road leaving the farm, the group argued about whether to use *Tieli Mu* as propeller shafts based on Meng De's "heard from someone." This was a large ship of over a thousand tons; if the propeller shaft failed once launched for sea trials, it would have to re-enter the dry dock for repairs—not only embarrassing but also affecting the strategic goals of the entire Transmigrator Group.

"Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. I think we adopt the most direct method: test first." Jiang Ye proposed modifying one or two current Steam *Daihatsu* boats to see the effect.

Steam *Daihatsu* boats all installed 12hp steam engines, readymade power boats. However, their propulsion method was rather special, using so-called retractable propellers, equivalent to an outboard motor propulsion—the shipyard used this back then to circumvent the difficulty of propeller installation. Of course, the cost was that the transmission of the power unit became quite complex.

"If the Steam *Daihatsu* boat can be changed to a propeller, it will have great significance for installing propellers on the 854 Modified, at least accumulating experience."

"Right, let's try all kinds of schemes we can think of," Zhou Bili said.

After coordination by the Planning Agency, the Navy "generously" provided five Steam *Daihatsu* boats—this generosity had conditions: all 6 were *Daihatsu* boats that malfunctioned frequently and were in poor condition during the Pearl River Campaign. The Navy stated as long as they could fix them, the Mechanical Industry Ministry crowd could toss them around however they liked. Subsequently, under Zhou Bili's proposal, an "854 Modified Project Technical Group" was set up at the shipyard, drafting several Senator technicians with certain attainments in shipbuilding, machining, and other aspects to participate, stationed at the factory to solve various technical problems on-site. Acting as project leaders for the entire shipbuilding plan—the "First Shipbuilding Refit Plan."

Zhou Ke of the Ministry of Mechanical Industry was appointed as the project leader. Since others in the project group couldn't work full-time at the shipyard, he served as the standing personnel. Zhou Ke graduated with a major in Machinery, second major in Thermal Engineering, both somewhat related to shipbuilding. His benchwork and lathe work foundations were good, and he loved making ship models, so he became the most suitable responsible person for the shipbuilding project group among Senators.

Zhou Ke was a sturdy figure with a round face. Although called the project leader, he actually didn't know much about shipbuilding—like Zhou Bili and others, as Senator engineers of the Mechanical Industry Ministry, they took turns acting as resident guides in various industrial enterprises, staying in all kinds of factories. Became a typical so-called "Generalist" who "could do anything."

The first thing after taking office was to solve the problems of the transmission shaft and propeller.

The engineering group first pulled a *Daihatsu* boat onto the slipway—although the *Daihatsu* boat had only fought in Guangdong for two months, barnacle attachments on the bottom were already quite numerous. Shipwrights first carried out bottom cleaning work. Subsequently, Sun Li led people to dismantle the steam engine and boiler on the *Daihatsu* boat for overhaul.

Propellers were relatively easy to solve. Although they didn't bring actual propellers, they had full sets of CAD drawings for various propellers. Jiang Ye's idea was to directly make one using the machining center, then use this for sand casting to make molds for mass manufacturing. Zhou Ke felt this was making a mountain out of a molehill.

"Don't we have motorized boats on the *Fengcheng*? There are propellers in the spare parts; use that as a model for sand casting."

Xiao Bailang first made a clay mold using the propeller, then cast a hard mold, and finally cast the first small boat propeller using cast iron.

Zhou Ke first had the computer perform center of gravity and center point alignment work. After obtaining data, holes were cut in the hull to install shaft sleeves and shafts. He installed a *Tieli Mu* propeller (bearing?) on the No. 1 test boat. The result proved *Tieli Mu* was feasible. During sea trials, the shaft sleeve did indeed have a small amount of water intake at the beginning, but it stopped before reaching the point of needing to bail water.

However, the *Daihatsu* boat was after all a small boat of only dozens of tons and 12 horsepower. The 854 Modified had a displacement exceeding 1200 tons and a 500 horsepower steam engine; not a single person in the entire project group dared to guarantee if using a wooden shaft on such a ship was reliable.

Next, they tried various shaft sealing methods. In fact, various dynamic sealing methods given by everyone were feasible. But more or less, various problems existed: some processing means couldn't reach, some material levels weren't good enough. Roughly speaking, the design philosophy far exceeded processing capability and material levels.

Packing seal was the simplest among all sealing methods, and the effect was passable—water intake speed wasn't very fast; with pumps on board, this bit of water intake wasn't a big problem, not to mention with a steam engine, pumping water wasn't a burden. However, the heat dissipation problem had no good solution throughout. 500 horsepower, several hundred revolutions per minute, the heat generated by friction was severe, roughly equivalent to a small electric stove of one or two kilowatts. Without heat dissipation means, reaching red-hot state was common.

Finally, Zhou Ke decided to adopt a liquid oil seal with circulation cooling. The sealing oil tank was set above the propeller transmission shaft, slowly injecting oil into the stern tube by gravity. The oil had certain pressure and would slowly leak outward through the stern tube, thereby resisting seawater infiltration. The oil itself served to cool the transmission shaft. Most of the oil was recovered by a pump, cooled externally once, and reinjected into the oil tank for circular use.

The structure of this oil seal was relatively simple; slightly more complex were the oil recovery pipeline and power. Moreover, the grease used could be castor oil or coconut oil—the Planning Agency could supply both.

"Are you sure this plan works?" Zhan Wuya looked at the model Zhou Ke brought to his office.

"Workable." Zhou Ke opened the model—a very simple model but large scale—to fully display details, "We conducted installation tests on Test Boat No. 5, also conducted land operation tests and water platform tests. Cooperating with pumps, the water leakage speed of the stern tube using oil seal is completely within controllable range. Just don't know if coconut oil or castor oil can be fully supplied; after all, it's not 100% recovery, there's certain loss. Sealing oil needs long-term supply."

"Problem isn't big. As long as you can ensure most oil is recovered—anyway, chemical engineering people can utilize any oil; replaced sealing oil can at most be used to make soap." Zhan Wuya knew whether castor oil or coconut oil, there was still certain stock in the Planning Agency's inventory. Especially coconut oil; since having the Sanya base, supply had been quite stable. As for castor oil, the Central Administration Council had mobilized students through the Ministry of Education to widely plant this plant at home and school using fragmentary land. Before mineral oil available, castor oil counted as very good industrial oil.

Zhou Ke said excitedly: "This is good! Next step we have to solve the large propeller problem."

"One more thing." Zhan Wuya picked up a thick file bag from the desk, "This came from Qian Shuiting, about rigging."

"Rigging? Wasn't it decided to adopt square sails?"

"According to this Qian Shuiting, full square rigging has very high requirements for sail handling sailors..."

"We already decided to use power machines to handle sails."

"According to him, full square rigging cannot achieve fully mechanized sail handling; a considerable workload still needs to be solved by sailors climbing masts. He suggests switching to a so-called easier-to-operate..." Zhan Wuya couldn't recall the term for a moment—Barquentine style—"Forget it, you know anyway; he has written it very clearly inside, there are also drawings."

"Understood, I'll notify the sail-making workshop when I get back."

Zhan Wuya said: "Also, you need to submit a report to me: regarding applying to manufacture steel wire ropes and fine iron chains of the following specifications." He handed him a document, "Huang Tianyu told me yesterday both are necessary items on power sail handling auxiliary equipment, but the industrial department has never produced these. It amounts to 'special demand manufacturing'; you, this project leader, have to propose it."

"Okay. I really hadn't thought mechanized sail handling was possible."

"According to General Wen, the last and most modern steel large sailing ships—used to transport bulk cargoes like wheat, guano, and Chilean nitrate—only needed 20-plus sailors. Fully mechanized sail handling. It would be good if we had such ships someday."

After Zhou Ke left the office, he went to the "Fire Kiln"—everyone called the department managed by Xiao Bailang this. Industries related to fire in the industrial system, such as kilns and casting, were all under his management. From firing crystal-clear bone china and glass to silly-big-black-coarse large castings, from industrial equipment to sanitary ware enjoyed by individuals, nothing was not under his management. Over two years, the formerly handsome Xiao Bailang was made dry and black.

Xiao Bailang was currently organizing workers to make clay molds for a wooden propeller. This wooden propeller had quite a background. It was a "prototype" manufactured by the machining center. The Planning Agency's warehouse had some reserved large and medium propellers—spares prepared for the *Fengcheng* and other modern ships. But Zhou Ke didn't know if they were suitable. So he asked someone to optimize and select the propeller type matching the 854 Modified hull form first, then extract corresponding CAD drawings for certain optimization modifications, and finally input into the machining center to manufacture a full-scale wooden mold.

Workers first made a clay mold using this wooden mold, then made a hard mold from sand casting based on this clay mold. Then this wooden mold was properly preserved.

For propeller material, based on the experience of making small boat propellers last time, Aluminum Brass was directly adopted. Although Transmigrators couldn't smelt aluminum temporarily, aluminum sources were wide, smelting technology not high, self-production relatively easy. Compared to other non-ferrous metals like Manganese Bronze and Nickel Aluminum Bronze, sources were much easier.

Newly smelted and cast Aluminum Brass ingots transported from the Metallurgy Ministry workshop were piled beside the crucible furnace, waiting to be melted and cast.

"Casting takes only a day; making the mold is particularly strenuous!" Xiao Bailang exhaled; his face was grimy, hanging a black and oily labor protection mask around his neck. "I have to talk to Zhan Wuya, need bigger crucible furnaces, do continuous casting." He looked at Zhou Ke, "You aren't going to equip every type of ship with a unique propeller, right?"

"No such thing. I prepare to use this propeller for a stage. 1200-ton ships and 500-ton ships using the same propeller should be no problem. Larger ships will use twin-propeller propulsion."

"Mm," Xiao Bailang sat down on a stool. Immediately a young girl wearing blue overalls brought a large mug of bubbling salty soda water, letting him drink it all in one gulp. Zhou Ke saw this girl had fresh short hair covering her ears, features distinct and lovely, but her chest was rarely very full—a look of "child face, huge breasts." He couldn't help wondering: since when were there such top-quality goods when buying Life Secretaries?

"Heh heh, you're jealous, aren't you?" Xiao Bailang looked at him sideways.

"This chick is nice; why haven't I seen her? Did they open a back door for you, kid?"

"This is S-Class. You only spent C-Class money; of course, you only get a dark-skinned sister to play with." Xiao Bailang said smugly, "I didn't use a back door; I won the lottery."

"I don't believe your dog-shit luck is this strong! The Executive Committee gang definitely opened a back door for you!"

"What 'opened a back door for me'!" Xiao Bailang flew into a rage out of humiliation, "If fate is bitter, don't blame the Executive Committee." Saying so, he tilted his chin towards the girl, "Come, sing one for the master! Piss off this bunch of losers."

The girl dared not neglect and hurriedly sang a Cantonese ditty unknown to them. Workers stood more than three *zhang* (approx 10m) away from Xiao Bailang with awe, listening to the ditty—this Chief Xiao's concubine sang ditties well; everyone loved to listen. Moreover, everyone felt heartfelt admiration for Chief Xiao's heroic spirit of bringing a woman to work in the workshop.

The girl's voice was delicate and tender, making Zhou Ke's heart sway. He couldn't help but secretly feel jealous. Thinking could it be the Executive Committee really pulled some tricks in maid distribution? Although given Xiao Bailang's working conditions, getting an S-Class maid was deserved, but such black-box operations should be resolutely stopped! He was already dissatisfied with the Executive Committee's tendencies; now he became even more suspicious.

As for the large transmission shafts, connecting rods, and cranks used to drive the propeller, the Bopu Arsenal was responsible for undertaking their manufacture. They had large forging machines—originally installed for forging cannons, also used to forge some large workpieces. These forging machines were cruder than forging equipment brought by Transmigrators from the old spacetime, but far exceeded the brought equipment in machine size and forging capacity. The Arsenal's forging workshop was also the busiest workshop in the Manufacturing Directorate, forging day and night. Part of the iron keels and ribs for constructing new ships were also forged here.

Inside the Arsenal, steam engines equipped for ships were still being manufactured. Because steam engine and boiler finished products were bulky, to facilitate transport and installation, in industrial layout, the manufacturing workshops for both were arranged to be carried out inside the Arsenal. some standardized parts were provided by the Bairen Industrial Zone.

All steam engines of Transmigrators so far used Lancashire boilers to supply steam—this boiler was improved and installed with a surface condenser. Able to provide distilled water for the boiler, ensuring the boiler could be used continuously.

Lancashire boilers could also supply steam for marine steam engines, just that efficiency was poorer; same power required more boilers to supply steam. This was uneconomical for ships with limited space. So Sun Li and others who had been responsible for manufacturing steam engines had a brand new task: develop new high-pressure boilers for marine steam engines. Used to provide steam with greater unit pressure. If the new model boiler imitation was successful, it could provide a foundation for manufacturing higher horsepower steam engines. After all, the power provided by a 500hp steam engine was still too low.

After consulting materials, everyone decided to follow the old path of historical technological improvement and trial-produce Fire-tube Boilers. It adopts a cylindrical shell and flues. The unit pressure provided by this boiler far exceeds Lancashire boilers, so much so that original cast iron pipes must be replaced with low carbon steel pipes to ensure safe operation.
