# Chapter 714 - Battle of Upper Hengdang Island

Splashing spray from the bow occasionally drenched the ship. The landing craft was packed with marines and sailor landing troops. Each sat silently on the deck, rifles cradled in their arms—all wrapped in single-use oilcloth protective bags per regulations. The steam engine rumbled with a tremendous vibration. Shi Zhiqi stood at the stern of one landing craft. Watching Upper Hengdang Island draw nearer, he nervously licked his lips—thinking how nice it would be to have some chewing gum right now.

Several small support craft, belching black smoke, led the formation. These small craft had shield-protected typewriters installed and iron plating wrapped around their hulls—specifically for close-in shore strafing to cover the troops. The gunners aboard wore steel helmets and protective vests with front and back steel plates, each gripping their typewriter's stabilizing bar with tense expressions, awaiting the order to fire.

The small craft closed on the shoreline. The typewriters' resonant roar immediately filled the air—though this was now completely unnecessary. The incomplete western battery position was already empty. The bullets from the typewriters merely shredded plants and branches.

Shi Zhiqi led by example, first to jump from the landing craft. The water was shallow. He thrust his command saber forward, shouting: "Attack!"

A bugler sounded the charge while standing in the seawater. Boat after boat of marines and armed sailors leapt into the knee-deep water and waded ashore. Quickly, Shi Zhiqi had put 2 companies and 2 12-pounder mountain howitzers onto Upper Hengdang Island's western shore. They mopped up all remaining Ming troops and captured about 50 prisoners. Shi Zhiqi ordered an immediate advance toward the island's east side.

According to intelligence, Upper Hengdang Island had 800 government troops. The eastern battery had 12 newly-added Red Barbarian cannons. The battery had been under construction since the Wanli reign, making it relatively sturdy. It was defended by 500 garrison troops. A frontal assault would mean enduring not only the eastern battery's fire but also flanking fire from Yaniangxie Battery.

Since all the battery's guns pointed east, the rear was completely undefended. So when Shi Zhiqi's two marine companies appeared from the flank and rear and the two mountain howitzers began lobbing shells into the battery, the entire garrison's morale collapsed. The heavy Red Barbarian cannons couldn't be easily repositioned. With the enemy coming from the flank and rear, soldiers armed with swords, spears, and three-barreled muskets were neither able nor willing to resist. Only the battery commander's personal guards launched a brave hand-to-hand counterattack, causing one marine killed and three wounded—the only naval casualties in the entire Upper Hengdang Island battle.

The marines quickly routed the defenders, who outnumbered them two to one. The alternating volleys of musket fire and mountain howitzer bombardment turned the battle into a one-sided massacre. Aside from a few who escaped to Yaniangxie Island across the water by small boat, the remaining government troops scattered in all directions. Soon they were surrendering in droves.

Surrounded by guards, orderlies, and signalmen, Shi Zhiqi entered the smoke-shrouded, corpse-strewn battery and climbed to its highest point. The battery itself was barely damaged—it appeared quite solidly built. Twelve Red Barbarian cannons sat in their positions, not having fired a single shot, aimed at the waters where enemy ships were supposed to appear.

Shi Zhiqi examined the position and found its design rather strange. The so-called "battery" was merely a circular earth-and-stone platform, faced with brick and stone on the outside. Twelve Red Barbarian cannons were mounted atop, all facing seaward. Behind the platform was only a simple brick wall—no defensive works whatsoever, not even a ditch. The defenders apparently hadn't considered the possibility of enemies landing and attacking from the rear.

Even in a frontal assault, the total lack of auxiliary defensive works around the platform meant attackers, once they closed to the platform's base, would enter a dead zone where the guns couldn't depress far enough to engage them. They could then leisurely climb up and fight. Shi Zhiqi estimated a single marine company attacking frontally could take this battery in less than half an hour—though with some casualties.

"Send a message!" Shi Zhiqi planted his foot on the battery parapet, gazing across the eastern channel at Wu Mountain. He slashed his command saber through the air. "The Key to the Bogue is in the hands of our Marine Corps!"

While the battle for Upper Hengdang Island proceeded, another force landed at the Luwan Battery site on the riverbank west of the island. The hundred soldiers guarding that battery fled without a fight, abandoning the half-built battery and piles of construction materials. With this, the Bogue's second line of defense—its main line—had been breached. Even without attacking Yaniangxie Mountain and destroying the batteries there, the Pearl River's gates now stood wide open.

Yet Chen Haiyang wanted complete control of the Bogue. He promptly ordered the mortar boats towed by landing craft into the Bogue's eastern channel to shell Yaniangxie Battery. The shallow-draft landing craft and mortar boats sailed along the Upper Hengdang Island shore. Being beyond range, the various batteries on Yaniangxie Island across the way could only watch helplessly.

At the field headquarters atop Wu Mountain, chaos reigned. No one had expected the painstakingly constructed defense system to collapse so easily. Fan Wencai trembled: "How... how could the battery fall so quickly..."

"The crop-heads actually landed on the other side and attacked from behind—utterly despicable!" Li Xijue, who had come from Zhaoqing to inspect the Bogue defenses, had "luckily" witnessed this firsthand. His face was ashen. Though he called it despicable, he finally understood what state of mind Lü Yizhong must have been in when he wrote that letter.

"It's all right—the crop-heads who landed numbered only two or three hundred." Xu Tingfa struggled to maintain composure. But when the Australian red flags and blue-white banners rose over Upper Hengdang Island, his heart had already sunk to the bottom. With Upper Hengdang lost, the entire Bogue chokepoint had lost its ability to blockade. To rebuild the defense, they would have to recapture the island.

He summoned a junior general: "Immediately recruit 300 volunteers! Five taels' reward per man—prepare to launch a counterattack across the water to retake Upper Hengdang Island! Ten taels each after success! An extra five taels for the wounded! Twenty taels for the dead!"

---

"Understood, Your Excellency!" The junior general departed immediately. Xu Tingfa meanwhile ordered preparation of sampans and small boats for crossing the eastern channel to counterattack.

Just as he was mustering forces to prepare the counterattack, the 10 mortar boats already anchored at the foot of Upper Hengdang Island's eastern battery opened fire.

With a thunderous roar from the 280mm mortars, dark iron spheres rose from the smoke, trailing burning tails as they fell on the battery. The Yaniangxie Battery that Xu Tingfa, Fan Wencai, and their colleagues had painstakingly built—expending thousands of laborers and tens of thousands of taels—trembled and collapsed under the 280mm mortar fire. Shattered brick and stone were hurled skyward. Muffled explosions came one after another. The entire battery seemed utterly shrouded in smoke.

Xu Tingfa's planned counterattack was completely disrupted. Under such ferocious bombardment, no fool would rush to the beach to "counterattack" for five taels of silver.

Watching the battery get pounded, fires and smoke erupting everywhere, walls collapsing and platforms crumbling—yet never showing any sign of returning fire—Li Xijue grew anxious: "Why aren't our Red Barbarian cannons firing?"

"They can't reach!" Xu Tingfa said impatiently. "At this distance, the shots just splash into the water!"

"What?! Even the Red Barbarian cannons..." Li Xijue's face went dead white. He had always viewed the Red Barbarian cannon as an unprecedentedly powerful military weapon. Now he learned of the existence of guns with even greater range and power. Having watched the battle unfold—government troops taking hit after hit with no effective response whatsoever—his frustration grew unbearable. His vision went black, and he fainted.

Xu Tingfa had no time to mind this Advisor Li from the Governor-General's yamen. Not only was his counterattack plan impossible to execute, but the crop-head fleet was already entering the eastern channel.

If only Upper Hengdang Island hadn't fallen, he could have "given the Australians a severe thrashing!" Xu Tingfa thought with considerable regret. He clung to one hope: the batteries on Yaniangxie, though suppressed by artillery fire, might still open fire on seeing enemy ships enter range.

Shi Fourteen's 5th Squadron, ordered to exploit the suppression and smoke from the mortar boats' explosive shells, closed until they were just 380 meters from the battery's front. There they dropped anchor to fix their position, then added their broadside guns to the bombardment.

At 380 meters, the Red Barbarian cannons on the battery certainly had the capability to seriously damage these special-service boats. But after thirty minutes of mortar bombardment, every soldier on the batteries was either dead or fled. On the exposed gun positions, no one remained to fire the guns. All they could see was the battery works collapsing section by section under the artillery fire, like sandcastles. Occasionally a magazine in the battery was hit and detonated, sending black-tinged flames shooting toward the sky.

Then two more squadrons entered the eastern channel for close-range bombardment. After one hour and twenty-five minutes of shelling, all batteries on Yaniangxie Island had lost combat effectiveness. Three hundred marines and sailor landing troops boarded sampans to land, entering the batteries through walls now reduced to rubble. At 17:07, all batteries had fallen. The garrison soldiers had left behind 200 corpses; approximately 400 had been taken prisoner.

Xu Tingfa and the others were ashen-faced. Watching the batteries fall, let alone counterattacking—even staying on Wu Mountain might mean not surviving. The only option now was to immediately retreat to the Bogue Garrison and hold out. Just as Xu Tingfa was about to arrange officers and troops for the withdrawal, someone shouted in his ear: "Not good! The crop-heads are climbing the mountain!"

Instantly, the entire field headquarters atop Wu Mountain erupted in panic. Officers and soldiers who had been observing the battle all afternoon had no will to fight. At once they scattered like frightened beasts, fleeing in all directions. Except for Xu Tingfa's few personal guards maintaining composure to protect the command post, the entire encampment descended into utter chaos.

"Your Excellency, we must go now!" Several guards didn't bother asking—they hoisted Xu Tingfa and the others onto horses and, surrounding them, fled down the mountain.
