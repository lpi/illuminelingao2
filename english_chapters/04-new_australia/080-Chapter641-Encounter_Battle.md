# Chapter 641 Encounter Battle

The post road began to gradually turn from the seaside towards the interior, and they walked for a long time. He Rubin saw the sun was already slanting west, estimating it was around the beginning of *Shen* hour (3 PM). He looked around; far and near were undulating hills and mountains. Not far from the post road was a small hill, lush with grass and trees. He pulled the reins, riding his horse up a small hillside beside the post road. His personal guards and generals hurriedly followed.

He rode a Mongolian steed, very spirited and handsome. The saddle, bridle, and stirrups were all made of brass, polished shining bright by personal guards before departure, dazzling in the sunlight. Holding the reins in his left hand and a whip in his right, watching the endless stream of men, horses, and banners advancing beside him, a feeling of smug satisfaction filled his chest.

"Lieutenant Colonel Tang!" He called out.

"This humble general is here!"

"How far is this place from Chengmai?"

"Reporting to Commander-in-Chief, there are still thirty *li*." Tang Yunwen clasped his hands on horseback. "This place is named Shishan."

He Rubin glanced at this small hill, about a hundred *zhang* from the post road. It was a good place to control the post road. If the Hair Bandits ambushed men and horses here, he would inevitably have to undergo a hard battle to pass. However, scouts had just explored it, and there were no ambush troops here.

"The Hair Bandits do not understand war." He Rubin commented. "If a camp were set up here with men guarding it, our army would have to capture this hill first before continuing the advance."

"What Your Excellency says is extremely true." Chang Qingyun's face was covered in dust, and his buttocks were rubbed sore, but he still followed closely behind He Rubin's headquarters, not staying in the Old Camp column. He hoped to say a few words at such times to show his knowledge and attitude of "diligence and loyalty."

"The terrain here is critical. Set up a Supply Depot here!" He Rubin ordered.

The strategy decided for the suppression campaign was a long siege, so the food supply for more than twenty thousand men was a very critical matter. The most convenient sea transport was unable to ship grain due to the Hair Bandits' "strong ships and fast cannons," and land transport was always quite troublesome regardless of distance, especially given the terrible condition of Hainan's post roads. Relying on conscripted laborers to carry loads on shoulders and push carts for hundreds of *li* to supply grain was very difficult. Therefore, the Ming army adopted the model of setting up Supply Depots segment by segment for layered transport.

Shishan had certain terrain advantages and the distance was moderate; it was one of the best locations to establish a transit Supply Depot.

Immediately, he ordered a Chiliarch to lead five hundred soldiers to set up a camp and establish a Supply Depot here, responsible for transshipping grain. He also planned to set up a second transit Supply Depot inside Chengmai County seat after lifting the siege of Chengmai. This way, establishing a Supply Depot every forty or fifty *li* with garrisoned soldiers would not only continuously transport provisions to the army but also ensure the safety of his rear route.

The grand army subsequently camped at Shishan. With Hair Bandit troops outside Chengmai County seat, He Rubin decided to rest here for one night to let the soldiers recharge their energy before reaching Chengmai tomorrow. This was to avoid a hungry and exhausted army being unable to withstand the fresh and waiting Hair Bandits; suffering a small defeat under the city walls would be very bad for morale.

"Tomorrow afternoon, our army will arrive under Chengmai City." He Rubin said to the generals and private secretaries at the evening meeting. "According to the Chengmai urgency report, the Hair Bandits have already built earthworks and set up a camp under the city. With about two thousand men and cannons, their defense must be solid. Our army must take it in one vigorous effort, allowing no setbacks!"

"Yes!" The generals answered loudly in unison.

Zhao Ruyi said: "Local officials conceal faults and decorate merits. Whenever there are rebels or bandits, they always exaggerate ten or several dozen times. Even if there are more than two thousand men in their camp, they are mostly likely coerced commoners. My soldiers will surely take it in one drum beat."

"What Your Excellency says is extremely true. However, caution is still the best policy." He Rubin asked the Central Army Garrison Commander Ye Zhengfang, "General Ye, bring the latest urgency report from Chengmai."

Ye Zhengfang said: "Reporting to Your Excellency, Chengmai's urgency reports haven't arrived for three or four days. I fear the Hair Bandits have already besieged the whole city and cut off traffic."

"In that case, we must be even more cautious!" He Rubin felt a vague uneasiness in his heart. "Send more scouts tomorrow!"

The sun shone overhead, scorching hot.

Extra-numerary Squad Leader Zhong Xiao didn't know how many times he had taken the sun-baked helmet off his head. He stopped his horse in the shade of a tree by the small road, and the few cavalrymen behind him followed.

"Squad Leader! Why aren't we moving?" A brother under his command asked.

"Move my ass, it's so hot. This ghostly place! Rest a while first!" Zhong Xiao cursed. His armor was not only hot but also deadly heavy under the sun, and the leather bindings constantly emitted a disgusting stench. He was ordered to lead a few brothers to act as scouts, investigating enemy situations at any time.

He only felt better after taking off his helmet. He couldn't help sighing. Fighting wars was truly a tormented matter; not to mention the fear, just this marching claimed half his little life.

"Squad Leader, let this small one hold this helmet." A personal soldier surnamed Xu beside him said fawningly.

"Good, take it." Zhong Xiao threw the helmet into his hands. "Daddy needs to relax! This ghostly place, can't even find anyone to ask for a mouthful of water."

The water they brought had been drunk completely just now. For a while, they couldn't see any place to replenish fresh water.

"There's water here." Soldier Xu hurriedly handed over a bamboo tube. "Before heading out today, this small one brought a few extra. You are our backbone; nothing can go wrong with you."

"Good lad, really capable!" Zhong Xiao praised. The other soldiers secretly cursed him for being shameless—this person always wore a smiling face, respectfully serving the Squad Leader as comfortably as a master, fishing for quite a few benefits for himself.

Zhong Xiao's small squad of cavalry separated from the main unit, left the post road, and set out south to patrol and investigate any signs of enemy activity.

They walked more than ten *li* in one breath. Along the way, except for occasionally seeing a few commoners working in the fields, they didn't see a single person. He wanted to catch a few commoners to question, but as soon as the commoners saw helmeted and armored government soldiers, they immediately fled crawling and rolling. Horses were hard to chase in paddy fields, making him angry enough to curse their mothers.

Since he couldn't catch commoners to question, he had to lead his brothers to ride slowly forward. Accustomed to the densely populated Guangdong, arriving in Hainan he felt it was unusually desolate here. Everywhere was uncultivated wasteland, villages along the way were scarce, and when encountering a few villages, the commoners inside had long fled clean with their valuables.

"Where is there any trace of Hair Bandits!" Zhong Xiao cursed. "They are probably eating, drinking, and having fun at Bopu, sleeping with little wenches right now!"

"Squad Leader speaks truly!" The personal soldier surnamed Xu echoed. "How dare the Hair Bandits come out to fight; they only dare to fire firearms from afar."

"Go, let's go look by the woods on that hill over there!" Zhong Xiao's spirit lifted a lot after drinking water.

"Southeast, 4 o'clock direction, 500 meters. Five enemy cavalry! Moving northwest!" A designated marksman observing from a big tree reported in a low voice.

Chen Sigen had originally fallen asleep a bit—hearing the report, he slowly turned his body and moved to the observation position. He lay in ambush in a foxhole on this small hill with three scouts observing the surrounding movement since last night.

The order given to him was to eliminate all government army units of fewer than ten people appearing within their patrol range. Suspicious persons, even if not in government army attire, could also be captured or killed.

Due to a lack of mobility, the Special Reconnaissance Team's screening patrol could only rely on two legs. Although Special Reconnaissance Team members had several times the physical strength and endurance of ordinary people, intercepting small groups of scout cavalry in a wide area was still quite strenuous.

Bei Wei decided to adopt a sector responsibility system, dividing the screening area into sectors. Every four men formed a small team, with every 2 teams responsible for a small sector. The 2 teams took turns conducting ambush stakeouts and armed patrols. Each small team used walkie-talkies to maintain contact with each other, reporting situations at any time. If encountering enemies far beyond SKS rifle range or large numbers of government troops, they would only report their movements, leaving them to be dealt with by the specialized Mobile Team—composed of motorcycles and agricultural vehicles mounted with machine guns.

Chen Sigen led his men to choose a commanding height here and set up an observation post. One soldier observed the surroundings with binoculars from the branches at the top of a big tree.

He took out his binoculars and observed according to the sentry's indication: 500 meters away, indeed five Ming cavalrymen were walking over listlessly. Their armor, helmets hanging on saddles, and waist sabers all explained their identity.

"Don't rush, they are walking towards us. Open fire at 100 meters." Chen Sigen ordered. "Notify Team 1! Tell them to pay attention."

Seeing the five enemy riders walk to less than 100 meters away, Chen Sigen made a "prepare to fire" hand signal. Then he pulled the SKS in his hand to his eyes, carefully aiming at the leading rider who looked like an officer.

Just as Zhong Xiao looked into the distance again, a crisp gunshot rang in his ears.

A bullet flew past his ear. Zhong Xiao was greatly shocked: *There actally are Hair Bandits ambushing here!* He dared not think more, hurriedly turning his horse's head prepared to flee for his life.

At this time, several more gunshots rang out. Two cavalrymen beside him fell off their horses. Soldier Xu, who was chattering just now, was already lying on the ground with half the back of his head peeled open, blood and brains flowing all over the ground. Zhong Xiao was so scared he almost fell off his horse.

"Go quickly!" His body crouched low, hugging the horse's neck, and whipped the horse's rump.

"Bastard!" Chen Sigen cursed, quickly adjusted half a mil, and pulled the trigger again.

This bullet accurately hit Zhong Xiao's shoulder blade. The impact threw his body violently forward; the bullet drilled out from his mouth, and the huge impact tore off half his lower jaw. The corpse fell from the horse into the mud.

The other two cavalrymen turned their horses to flee in panic. The bullets quickly caught up with them, and both were hit and fell from their horses one after another.

"What a pity!" Chen Sigen looked at the two riderless warhorses fleeing into the distance and couldn't help cursing. *These were all Mongolian horses, rare locally!*

"Quick, drag the horses back, and drag the bodies into the ditch!" He then ordered, "Report, destroyed five Ming scout cavalry in Zone B12."

The Special Reconnaissance Team's screening of Ming scouts made the government army quickly lose all news. He Rubin sent out several batches of scouts successively, but none returned. Having walked more than ten *li* like this without a single scout returning, he felt something was wrong and ordered the whole army to stop advancing.

"How far is it from Chengmai County seat?"

The answer obtained was twelve *li*. He Rubin felt hesitant. From his experience, the sudden disappearance of his scouts indicated that the enemy's reconnaissance cavalry was also actively operating, trying their best to prevent him from obtaining the other side's movements.

It seemed the enemy didn't intend to be obediently besieged by him in Lingao but prepared to fight a big battle with him under Chengmai County seat.

"These Hair Bandits are not easy to deal with." He felt worried for the first time. *Didn't the Hair Bandits have no cavalry? It's impossible to eliminate all the scouts he sent out just relying on infantry, without letting a single one return.*

The generals were all waiting for his order. In another hour and a half, the sky would turn dark. Twenty thousand troops and baggage were still on the road. If they couldn't reach Chengmai before dark, they could only camp on the spot—time didn't allow him to hesitate.

"General Tong!" He ordered, "You immediately send three hundred cavalry to Chengmai, and send another five hundred infantry to follow at a run. Set up camp outside Chengmai County seat before dark to receive the grand army!"

Seeing the Commander-in-Chief's grave expression, Tong Yizhen knew the military situation was dangerous at this moment. He immediately dispatched Chiliarch He Zhanran to lead three hundred cavalry galloping towards Chengmai County seat. Just in case, he didn't send five hundred infantry but personally led his house guards and one thousand infantry to follow closely behind.

The Special Reconnaissance Team members of Ye Mengyan's squad shielding the post road saw over three hundred cavalry suddenly coming down the road. Knowing that their dispersed small squads of four could not resist, they yielded the main road to let the cavalry pass.

"Enemy main force is coming. Three or four hundred cavalry!" Ye Mengyan shouted into the walkie-talkie. "There is a lot of dust behind; more troops are coming."

"Don't entangle with them. The whole squad withdraw from the screening zone while using harassing fire. Let the enemy through to the county seat!"

"Understood!"

Ye Mengyan raised his SKS rifle and pulled the trigger at the cavalry galloping on the road. Then the members beside him opened fire one after another.

Amidst shrinking gunshots, cavalrymen constantly fell from their horses. This sudden shooting greatly shocked He Zhanran because he saw no sign of anyone firing bird guns at all. But from the gunshots, he knew the opponent's number was small, at most thirty or forty people, inevitably to harass and delay his troops' advance. He gave a loud shout, "Charge with me!" Disregarding men constantly falling from horses, he headed straight for Chengmai County seat.

A burst of crossfire from Ye Mengyan's three or four squads on both sides of the road caused He Zhanran to leave more than twenty bodies on the post road. Ye Mengyan originally wanted to ambush again, but the Ming infantry behind had already rushed over covering the mountains and plains. Hearing gunshots ahead, Tong Yizhen judged the enemy had deployed, ordered the infantry to spread out into formation, and personally led dozens of mounted house guards to charge in front.

Ye Mengyan originally thought the enemy was just so-so, simply vulnerable under SKS rifles. Now seeing Ming infantry swarming all over the ground, banners waving, swords and spears like a forest, his heart beat wildly. *Mother! This is too spectacular!* He thought, *Even with a machine gun right now, I probably couldn't hold them—too many people!*

"Quick! Retreat!" He immediately ordered the whole detachment to retreat individually. Raising his SKS-D rifle without aiming, he emptied a 20-round magazine into the subsequent swarming Ming army, then hurriedly went down into the ditch to flee.

The Special Reconnaissance Team's retreat route passed through previously surveyed terrain, utilizing topography to avoid enemy pursuers as much as possible. Since the weapons used by the Special Reconnaissance Team all fired smokeless ammunition, and all members were equipped with camouflage uniforms, it was very difficult for the Ming army to identify their positions in the wild.

Tong Yizhen's men and horses lost a dozen people in the last blocking fire by Ye Mengyan's squad, including one of his personal officers killed. The enemy's invisible shooting made him very fearful. But with men and horses constantly swarming from behind, he had to brace himself and lead his troops to pounce on the county seat.

Hearing gunshots and killing shouts ahead, He Rubin knew the vanguard had engaged the enemy. He hurriedly ordered Guerrilla General Li Guang, commanding the Governor's Standard Camp, to quickly take the Standard Camp to reinforce. He personally led his house guards and the Regional Commander's Standard to support from behind.

"Tell General Yan to suppress the rear troops to march slowly; absolutely do not let them fall into chaos first!"

The rear column not only had a large amount of baggage but also village militia and local garrison troops. These troops were very unreliable; slightly shaken, they would scramble to flee. So he gave special instructions. After transmitting the order, he personally led his house guards to follow closely behind Li Guang's troops.

He Zhanran's cavalry was the first to arrive outside the South Gate of Chengmai, occupying the empty camp abandoned by You Laohu. The Light Infantry previously executing blockade shooting outside various city gates had already withdrawn from their positions, retreating towards the Grand Camp northwest of the city.

Seeing more than three hundred infantry retreating, having walked less than two or three *li*, He Zhanran quickly led his cavalry to charge over.

The 1st Light Infantry Company of the 1st Infantry Battalion commanded by Yang Zeng was the earliest to withdraw from the position, but the 5th Light Infantry Company was delayed by more than ten minutes receiving the order. Yang Zeng, acting as blockade commander under the city, waited a while longer halfway to receive the 5th Battalion's Light Infantry. As a result, they were bitten by the Ming cavalry arriving at flying speed.

Seeing the cavalry already rolling in, Yang Zeng immediately drew his command saber, shouting the order: "Fix bayonets! Hollow Square Formation!"

Military drums beat rapidly.

The 1st Light Infantry Company, originally retreating, immediately turned around to stand in front. The 5th Light Infantry Company split into two, deploying half the soldiers on the left and right respectively. The 3rd Light Infantry Company stood back-to-back with them.

Yang Zeng found there were not enough infantry on the left and right wings. Fearing the flank firepower was too weak and would be breached by the enemy, he immediately ordered the front and rear companies to each allocate a platoon to shift to the two wings respectively.

Because numbers were few, the square was simply formed with a depth of three ranks on each side. The first rank knelt on one knee in front, bayoneted rifles pointing diagonally upward. The rear two ranks held rifles level, ready to fire at any time.

This series of maneuvers took less than three minutes. The enemy instantly charged in front of the square. The full-speed impact force of the cavalry made the soldiers, who had undergone countless infantry-cavalry counter-training sessions, also begin to waver.

At this critical moment, Yang Zeng shouted: "Sights to Zero!" His command saber slashed down, "Fire!"
