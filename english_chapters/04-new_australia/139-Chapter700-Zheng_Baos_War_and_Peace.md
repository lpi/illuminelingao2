# Chapter 700 - Zheng Bao's War and Peace

In his disappointment, Zheng Bao had still granted Wang You the title of Advisor—the man possessed skills in managing documents and accounts that Zheng Bao himself lacked. Subsequently, he had led his recruited ships and wealth to operate in the coastal waters near Dianbai, robbing salt boats and raiding coastal residents. He had also ventured into Vietnamese waters to participate in several maritime conflicts between the Northern and Southern Dynasties, reaping considerable benefits. Upon hearing that Liu Xiang's fleet had departed the Pearl River Estuary, he had hurried his fleet to Lantau Island, preparing to seize this opening and rush into the Pearl River for a major score.

After arriving at Lantau, he discovered many small pirate bands had already gathered sporadically—all preparing to rush into the Pearl River's inland waterways for a major operation. The government army's disastrous defeat at Chengmai and Liu Xiang's sudden departure from the Pearl River Estuary had given them great hope for wealth.

Once at Lantau, Zheng Bao had used his strength to quickly consolidate all the ships there. Now this temporarily assembled group had swelled to seventy large ships, over two hundred sampans and long-dragon boats, and more than four thousand pirates.

Just as Zheng Bao was waiting for suitable tides and winds to rush into the Pearl River Estuary in a single thrust, news of the Australian fleet's arrival had made him temporarily dismiss the idea.

The Australians building a pier on Hong Kong Island revealed their intention to stay there permanently. Moreover, they had dispatched many ships. Zheng Bao reasoned: if he didn't establish an alliance with them, once his fleet entered the Pearl River, it would be disastrous if the Australians took advantage of the chaos to ambush him at the estuary.

He saw two options: achieve an alliance with the Australians and split the loot—he was willing to bleed a little more profit if necessary; or thoroughly defeat this Australian fleet so they wouldn't dare grab territory.

It was under such consideration that Zheng Bao had sent Jin Caifa. Beyond probing the Australians' intentions, there was also the intent to gather military intelligence—especially to determine whether the Australians' most formidable "fast ships" without sails had come.

He carefully questioned his two trusted aides about the number of Australian ships, the cannons equipped on each vessel, and how many defenders were stationed on shore. Hearing that the fast ships hadn't come brought a sigh of relief; hearing that the Australians had over fifty ships anchored drew a sigh of regret. If only there were just ten or twenty! Although most Australian warships looked no different from vessels of Guangdong and Fujian, their sailing speed and firepower were far beyond local ships. Grand Manager Zhu had once set his sights on those "fast ships" and planned to send men specifically to seize them. Who knew their sailing ships would prove equally formidable!

Especially the "quick-firing guns" on their sailing ships—once firing started, the sea surface would instantly fill with waterspouts, wiping out enemy sailors from one or two hundred *zhang* away. With such divine weapons, one need not worry about dominating the seas.

Zheng Bao had been itching with this idea. In his view, although the Australian great cannons were rumored to be excellent, they were nothing more than another version of Red Barbarian Cannons. Such cannons were expensive and heavy, liable to explode in battle. The best weapons were still those "quick-firing guns" that shot far, accurately, and rapidly. If he could capture a few and mount them on his ships, he could sweep away all enemies.

"Advisor Wang!" Zheng Bao greeted Wang You hurriedly as the man entered the cabin.

"These bald bandits talk big!" Zheng Bao, having enjoyed smooth sailing since becoming a pirate, couldn't swallow this insult. "To actually demand we register our troops and ships and deliver it over—isn't this damn well surrendering? Even if we were joining a big gang, they shouldn't humiliate people like this!"

Wang You regarded this "Boss" in silence. Zheng Bao wasn't stupid—the man was cunning and cruel—but unfortunately his abilities peaked at the level of a local tyrant. In insight and talent, he couldn't be mentioned in the same breath as Zhucailao and others. Even Black Flag Fourth Brother, a secondary manager, far exceeded him.

*Pity!* Zhucailao had died in battle at Nanri, and his managers were either dead or surrendered. Wang You himself had fallen to serving as advisor for such a character. The thought filled him with bitterness.

Setting aside everything else, just coming to the Pearl River Estuary—Wang You believed this was seeking death. The Pearl River Estuary basin would definitely become the focus of the next struggle between Liu Xiang and the Lingao Australian group. A place everyone else avoided—how could a small band like theirs lightly wade into such muddy waters? Besides, this was originally Liu Xiang's territory. Although Liu Xiang's main force had moved to Fujian waters, it didn't mean he had relinquished this territory.

Zheng Bao's actions, in Wang You's view, offended both sides. In the end, he would surely come to a bad end.

But Zheng Bao felt smug. Wearing the titles of the Great Lê Dynasty's Marquis of Guiyi and General of Ninghai, he fancied himself a "high official," adorning his clothing, flags, and insignia with garish decorations that belonged to neither Ming nor Lê tradition. This made Wang You despise him profoundly.

But for now, he could only endure in silence. Zheng Bao both needed to use and distrusted Zhucailao's former subordinates, expending much effort to divide and guard against them. Wang You knew his prestige was highest among Zhucailao's old subordinates—Zheng Bao watched him extremely closely. Any carelessness could lead to an inexplicable "falling into water and drowning."

"Advisor Wang, tell me—is this bald bandit matter feasible? It seems they want to swallow the Pearl River Estuary territory all for themselves," Zheng Bao said indignantly.

Wang You coughed. The Australians arriving at the Pearl River Estuary and building a fortress on Hong Kong Island made their intentions clear at a glance. Zheng Bao actually had few choices: either make enemies with the Australians and fight, or hoist sails and leave.

In his opinion, leaving was the best choice for the Zheng Bao group. Even if the Australians had half as many ships, the Zheng Bao group absolutely couldn't match them. Without overwhelming numerical superiority, defeating the Australians was impossible.

Wang You had just spoken a few reasons for "not suitable for war" when he noticed impatience on Zheng Bao's face. The man obviously didn't plan to simply walk away. Moreover, he had designs on the Australian ships and cannons.

"I say, Old Wang, you're afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind. Where did that boldness under Grand Manager Zhu go?" Zheng Bao clapped his shoulder and laughed loudly. "No matter how strong the Australians are, they have only forty or fifty ships, and no fast iron ships. Their vessels look about the same as ours. Their firearms are fierce, so I'll tell the brothers to close the distance and board them—drown them if need be!"

He spoke with confidence: "Speaking of powerful ships and cannons, of course the Australians are strong. But when it comes to blades, spears, and kung fu—our Chinese martial arts are the most powerful. As long as we get on board, whether they be true baldies or fake baldies, once firearms can't be used on deck, aren't they just waiting for us to chop them down?"

"I fear it's not that simple."

"Then tell me—what difficulties are there?"

Wang You thought grimly: leaving aside how to get men onto the decks, with dozens of Australian ships anchored there, the crews couldn't all be deaf and blind, waiting for enemies to climb up ship by ship.

"Even if we capture a few ships, if others discover it and besiege us together, wouldn't all our effort be for nothing?"

"Hmm, what you say makes sense." Zheng Bao considered this and agreed. But immediately he had a second idea.

---

The second idea was capturing the bandits by capturing their king. Zheng Bao planned to select a hundred daredevils from among the pirates, promising heavy rewards. Each would conceal a sharp blade. They would pretend to submit, then assassinate the Australian big leader in front of his tent.

According to Jin Caifa and others' descriptions, although guards surrounded the Australian big tent, there were only forty or fifty. Zheng Bao believed that as long as seventy or eighty men entangled them, the rest could rush in and kill all the leaders inside.

Wang You didn't know whether to laugh or cry. This plan was more realistic than the previous one, but its probability of success assumed the Australians were all idiots who would allow a hundred sturdy men to casually approach their command center without searching them beforehand.

Then Zheng Bao proposed several more "stratagems." All were rejected by Wang You one by one.

"If the Grand Manager is dead set on making enemies with the Australians to get their ships and cannons, there is only one word."

"What?"

"Wait." Wang You nodded. "The Australians' strength is roughly equal to ours. If we rashly provoke hostilities, even if we win, it will be a pyrrhic victory. For now, we can only act according to circumstances—watch the Australians' moves, then make plans."

In effect, it meant doing nothing and waiting for an opportunity. Zheng Bao complained: "Wait until when? When can we enter the Pearl River?"

"Entering the Pearl River is easy, but if the matter with the Australians isn't settled properly, there will be endless trouble!"

"Hmm, you have a point!" Zheng Bao certainly didn't wish to charge into the Pearl River Estuary with such a fleet left behind him, poised to strike.

"This brother has a method." Jin Caifa, seeing a chance to interject, hurried to speak up.

"What method?"

Like presenting a treasure, he told Zheng Bao and Wang You about encountering Shi Shisi on the Hong Kong pier.

"...Shi Shisi is dressed like an Australian now. If I hadn't dealt with him back then, I truly wouldn't have recognized that Australian was Shi Shisi."

Zheng Bao grew interested. "Oh, what official position does he hold with the Australians now? How many ships does he manage?"

"I didn't dare inquire. He was far away, on a ship at the pier," Jin Caifa explained. "But with this connection, the Grand Manager's plans have hope."

Wang You understood immediately. "You intend to buy him over?"

"Exactly!" Jin Caifa exclaimed. "As the saying goes—men die for wealth, birds die for food. That Shi Shisi was just a secondary manager of a small band back then. Even under the Australians, he's unlikely to have become a grand manager—probably controls only five or six ships. As long as the Grand Manager is willing to offer heavy gold, he can't help but be tempted."

Whether getting him to bring his troops over or launching a surprise turncoat attack during battle—both were excellent opportunities. Zheng Bao's eyes lit up with possibility.
