# Chapter 629 - The Guard Battalions

"The POW camp is ready. I even crash-trained a batch of women to shave heads," Yang He said enthusiastically. He had spent the whole afternoon discussing the POW camp's site selection and construction with Mei Wan. The start date for construction was settled. But the large amount of supporting facilities for the camp required cooperation from other departments. Speaking of the imminent capture of large numbers of government troops, everyone felt invigorated. Only Dongmen Chuiyu smiled without speaking. He had attended several military meetings; capturing as many prisoners as possible wasn't as simple as it sounded. Several wargames suggested a high probability of a rout.

Once twenty thousand government troops scattered, rounding them up into POW camps would be troublesome. The Fubo Army lacked cavalry, the most potent arm in pursuit warfare.

Destroying Tang Yunwen's navy and occupying Baishui Water Fort would certainly cut off the government army's retreat to the mainland, but Hainan Island was large, with plenty of room for maneuver. The government army could retreat to Wenchang and other places. Scattered soldiers could easily turn into small bands of bandits, causing great harm to the locality. The meeting had decided: after routing the enemy in land battle, they should let the Ming remnants retreat as intact as possible into Haikou Coastal Defense Battalion City or Qiongshan County City, then catch them like turtles in a jar.

His repeated drills of troop siege techniques these days were born of this consideration. After a week of training, coordination between infantry, artillery, and engineers was quite proficient. This earthen city was actually built scaled-down from the Haikou Coastal Defense Battalion City, but wall height, thickness, and defensive facilities were basically 1:1, with no shrinkage.

After dinner, Dongmen Chuiyu returned to headquarters. A field army battalion-level officer meeting would continue in the evening.

He Ming convened this meeting under pressure from the Executive Committee. Planning Institute President Wu De had expressed worry in several coordination meetings: the army was mobilized now, but the economic situation couldn't support such wartime operations long-term. Additionally, Cheng Dong, Ma Qianzhu, and others had asked what the specific combat plan was. He Ming knew they all hoped combat would start soon—some hoped to expand rule to all of Hainan quickly, others worried the transmigrator group's economy couldn't bear such consumption. He knew everyone had their reasons, all valid when brought to the table. And the Senate's general sentiment was hoping to destroy the enemy quickly.

Although neither Senate nor Executive Committee had legal right to interfere with the Minister of War's strategic and tactical decisions, the ninety-day deadline weighed heavily on He Ming. If he couldn't achieve decisive victory within three months, he would have a hard time passing the Senate meeting discussing the Minister of War's reappointment.

He Ming knew a quick victory was the only good choice now.

But intelligence from Special Reconnaissance Team members sent to operate near Haikou Coastal Defense Battalion and from the Foreign Intelligence Bureau indicated that not a single Great Ming soldier had landed on Hainan Island yet. Only a few thousand troops were gathering in Guangzhou; as for whether they planned to assemble fully before crossing or arrive in batches, the intelligence didn't say.

The Great Ming army hadn't moved yet, which He Ming, accustomed to being a modern soldier, found hard to understand—for a landing operation like Hainan Island, the first priority was seizing the initiative, securing a bridgehead on the island so follow-up troops and supplies could be sent continuously.

He and his staff had conducted many map exercises. Every hypothetical Ming operation started with small units reinforcing Haikou Coastal Defense Battalion. Staff officers believed, based on intelligence regarding Ming maritime projection capability and troop mobilization speed, the Ming army would inevitably adopt a small-batch, multiple-trip method to ferry troops. And the best port available in northern Hainan was Haikou's Shenying Harbor.

But to date, reconnaissance teams hadn't found any signs of reinforcement at Baishui Water Fort or Haikou Coastal Defense Battalion City. This surprised him and threatened to foil his plans.

To start fighting quickly, he had to change his originally cautious plan and decided to adopt measures to provoke the Guangdong authorities, forcing the enemy to move troops onto Hainan Island sooner.

He Ming came from a junior officer background and didn't have many hidden calculations. Since he wanted everyone's ideas, there was no need to conceal anything. He simply stated the situation facing the Field Army:

"...The Executive Committee has difficulties. Our foundation is thin. Supporting over ten thousand army and navy personnel plus over two thousand laborers and militia, we must win quickly. Let's pool our wisdom—how can we pressure the enemy to land early?"

Officers agreed with his operational plan to pressure the enemy into invading early. Some suggested besieging Chengmai, some suggested sending light troops to feint attack Haikou Coastal Defense Battalion City, others proposed the Navy sortie to bombard Guangzhou's gateway: Humen and Shajiao...

"I'll take the 4th Battalion to besiege Chengmai," 4th Battalion Commander You Laohu said. Newly promoted to battalion commander, he was eager to prove himself. "Guaranteed to take the city in one day."

Dongmen Chuiyu finally spoke: "These methods are all good, but taking Chengmai County City too early would make too much noise. Currently, opinions on war and peace differ in the Senate and Executive Committee; we shouldn't take the county seat too early, should leave some leeway for Wang Zunde. Besides, intelligence says the government thinks we're poor at land warfare. If we take Chengmai County City immediately, showing we're not only good at land warfare but can take cities, the enemy won't come to battle us so confidently."

Another officer said: "We need to besiege Chengmai to make the Hainan situation look urgent, but also make the government army underestimate us. Best if they think we're easy pickings."

"Everyone's opinions are excellent," He Ming said. "Let's work on multiple prongs."

Then, he ordered You Laohu to lead part of his troops to besiege Chengmai.

"Take one infantry company from the 4th Battalion, and mobilize another two hundred militia to go with you. Bring plenty of gongs and drums. Feint attack under Chengmai's walls. Make the act convincing, so the magistrate in Chengmai rushes to send distress calls."

"Yes!" You Laohu stood up and saluted. "Mission guaranteed." He continued: "Can you allocate me one or two cannons? We Bandits are known for sharp firearms; it won't look right without big guns."

"Take two 12-pounder mountain howitzers," Ying Yu said. "Light and convenient for you to carry. And firing solid shot at city walls has mediocre effect."

"Good, I'll set out tomorrow morning! Assign me a few good gunners; I'll smash Chengmai's gate tower..."

"No, I can give you more guns, but take student soldiers from the training unit as gunners. Bring more ammo; let the students practice."

Ying Yu knew He Ming wanted the Ming army to underestimate their combat capability, so he nodded: "Do it that way."

"Go with great fanfare along the way. Requisition grain from villages along the route; if any refuse, break them first." He Ming gave instructions. "The Three Disciplines and Eight Points of Attention are basic principles; watch your militia! But if anyone wants to oppose us, smash them to bits. Kill a few more landlord tyrants and clan heads! Then let a few escape."

"Understood!" You Laohu's dark face flushed with excitement.

"Little Ye."

"Here." Ye Mengyan stood up. After He Ming became Minister of War and formed the Field Army, Bei Wei had transferred Ye Mengyan's detachment directly to his command.

"Take your detachment and infiltrate Haikou Coastal Defense Battalion. Conduct harassment operations," He Ming said. "Kill a few people with fanfare, then capture a few officers as prisoners."

"Understood." Ye Mengyan was very excited. He had executed reconnaissance actions forward to Qiongshan several times. Being able to go all out this time greatly increased his enthusiasm.

"Little Wei!" He Ming then called Wei Aiwen's name.

"Here!"

"The Senate and Executive Committee are preparing to take over various Wei-Suo garrisons in the county. I'm handing this to you," He Ming said. "Wei-Suo combat power isn't worth mentioning. It's mainly a political battle; key is winning hearts. You take charge. I'll give you a company. Get it done quickly."

"Understood!"

"Return to Hundred Fathoms first. Meet Wu De and Ma Qianzhu. Hear their handling opinions," He Ming said. "Also, let a few ringleaders go so they rush to Qiongshan to raise the alarm."

Wei Aiwen naturally understood the intent. He said happily: "Understood! Definitely done within a week."

"The Wei-Suo troops have two encampments on the edge of the Li region, with several hundred men. Relatively combat-capable forces," He Ming said. "After taking over these two camps, don't disband them temporarily. Just arrest unpopular officers. Make the county supply pay and grain as usual."

He Ming worried that canceling these two camps would allow Li people to launch riots, so he required keeping them temporarily.

"I understand," Wei Aiwen said with regret. "Actually we could recruit Li and Miao soldiers..."

"Talk about that later. Handle this Wei-Suo mess first."

---

Early next morning, Wei Aiwen led an infantry company back to Hundred Fathoms. The company commander was Lin Fu—originally a villager of Saltworks Village, one of the first indigenous personnel to join the army. He was the first indigenous company commander in the Army. Just as Wei Aiwen marched out of camp, he saw You Laohu carrying a border army great saber—ever since seeing Wen Desi's private collection, You Laohu had wanted such a dominating weapon. For this expedition, he had pleaded and cajoled until he borrowed the sword from Wen Desi. Now he walked triumphantly beside the column leading the troops to besiege Chengmai.

Over three hundred militia with machetes at their waists and spears in hand, some pushing wheelbarrows, others carrying bows and old-style firelocks. Three mountain howitzers were interspersed in the column, each dragged by seven or eight young men. If not for the orderly infantry company, they looked exactly like a band of bandits.

"Little Wei!" You Laohu saw him and shouldered the great saber. "Going for land reform again? This time representing hired hands and beggars?"

"Are you taking this bunch to handle bandits?" Wei Aiwen retorted. "Can you use that knife? Don't just carry it all the way to Chengmai."

"Going to Chengmai to watch Daddy chop a few heads, blooding this knife," You Laohu said. "Otherwise it's useless as a decoration at Old Wen's place."

Wei Aiwen led the team back to Hundred Fathoms. Wu De had already prepared everything. The Planning Institute's raid team was assembled, mobilizing militia with carts to transport supplies.

Lingao's Wei-Suo was formally called the Rear Battalion under the Attached Guard of Five Thousand Households. It had two garrison locations. One near Nanbao, a formal battalion city; the other not far from Gaoshan Ridge. Both were fortified stockade structures. Though old, due to the long-term threat of Li disturbances, both garrisons had undergone some repair, were well-armed, and even had firearms—defense status was better than inland Wei-Suos.

The transmigrator group had long grasped the Wei-Suo situation. The battalion city had over a hundred military households, over five hundred men, women, and children. The other location had only thirty or forty households.

Taking over the garrisons and main camp met no resistance. Military households had few able-bodied men, lacked training, lived in poverty, and had zero fighting spirit. The Australians had been in Lingao a long time; everyone knew they acted benevolently and fairly. Surrendering promptly not only saved lives but promised a better life. So when Wei Aiwen appeared with troops under the stockade, they surrendered immediately. Planning Institute personnel took over weapons, supplies, and livestock while counting the population. For the soldiers in the two anti-Li camps, Wei Aiwen only arrested all officers, appointed a few prestigious soldiers as temporary acting leaders, and ordered the soldiers to remain stationed locally pending reorganization.

However, a small battle occurred at the Rear Battalion City. When Wei Aiwen led the infantry company to approach the stockade wall, Battalion Commander Liu led several personal guards to shut the gate first, then forced all able-bodied men in the stockade to climb the wall for defense.

Wei Aiwen hadn't expected the Wei-Suo dared resist. He ordered an indigenous clerk of the Planning Institute Special Search Team who spoke military dialect to step forward and shout, demanding immediate surrender.

Battalion Commander Liu shouted from the gate: "We've always stayed out of each other's way! I never hindered your affairs! Don't you come provoke me! This is the Court's established territory; capturing this stockade means raising a rebellion, and the Court will send a great army to conquer..."

Wei Aiwen was furious. He told the shouter: "Tell the military households on the wall: quickly grab the officials and open the gate to surrender. Otherwise, when we break the stockade, neither chickens nor dogs will be left!"

Commotion erupted on the stockade wall. Military households didn't want to fight—this wasn't a life-or-death fight against the Li people. They knew the Australians didn't indulge in killing and looting and treated subordinates generously. Muddling along under them might not mean enjoyment, but it couldn't be worse than under battalion and company commanders.

"Who dares move? Who dares move?" Battalion Commander Liu roared, waving a big sword; his guards shouted too. Though just a small battalion commander, his family had been officials here for generations and kept up martial arts to suppress the Li. His accumulated prestige remained; scolded by his stern face, none of the military households dared utter a sound.

Seeing no movement on the wall, Wei Aiwen was annoyed. His company had marksmen who could kill Commander Liu with one shot. But he secretly hoped someone among the military households would actively resist, preferably sparking armed conflict. That would make future political education much easier. Military households would also completely despair of the government.

"Shout!" Wei Aiwen's face was iron-blue. "Commander Liu can't save himself; tell military households not to sell their lives for him—resist quickly! What benefit is being his underling to ordinary households?"

Agitation rose again on the wall with the shouting. Households didn't want to die for him anyway; now incited by Wei Aiwen's barrage, many felt risking their lives guarding the stockade for the master wasn't worth it, and the stockade couldn't be held anyway.

Seeing the situation turn, Commander Liu scolded and threatened, then desperately shouted: "This is the Court's territory; the Hair Thieves dare not attack! Defend with all your might! Those who slack or clamor get beheaded; those who exert themselves get one tael of silver!"

However, this reward couldn't hold hearts. Suddenly someone threw down their sword and spear and ran toward the wall base. Instantly, the disunited defenders dispersed in an uproar, throwing down weapons and running down.

Personal guards immediately hacked away, beheading a fleeing household. But this didn't help; instead, it ignited the crowd's fury. Some turned to attack them. The commander's guards were outnumbered and almost all killed. The commander himself was protected by remaining retainers and fled down the wall. Households instantly began killing chaotically inside the stockade. Usually domineering company commanders, guards, retainers, and managers were hunted down. Households dragged out enemies' families, chopping off heads one by one. Women were dragged out, violated, then killed. The stockade fell into chaos.

Wei Aiwen remained calm, not rushing to enter. He guessed chaos had erupted inside and only hoped it would be thorough. Once households killed court officials, they would follow the transmigrators to the death. Just then a group of households opened the gate, lowered the drawbridge, and shouted outward: "Come in quick! Come in quick!"

Lin Fu drew his saber, looking back at Wei Aiwen. Wei Aiwen nodded. He immediately shouted loudly: "Whole company, assault!" He charged first. Before the bugler could blow, the whole company galloped forward behind him.

Leading the infantry company quickly into the city—though his first time here, intelligence had mapped the internal structure clearly. Lin Fu had assigned tasks to each platoon and squad. Upon entry, troops dispersed according to plan, seizing grain stores, stables, and key points. Someone banged a gong demanding households lay down weapons and await orders. Some households still killing in a frenzy who continued hacking were seized and subdued.

Order in the stockade was restored quickly. Only then did Wei Aiwen lead other personnel in. Corpses were seen occasionally on streets and under walls. Wei Aiwen arrived at the central drill hall, where disarmed able-bodied households sat on the ground awaiting judgment.

Lin Fu reported: the entire stockade was controlled, order restored. Several fires had been extinguished.
