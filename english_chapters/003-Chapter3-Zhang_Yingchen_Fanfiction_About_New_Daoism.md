Chapter 3 Zhang Yingchen's Fanfiction about New Daoism

The following articles were written by Daoquanzi (Book extra: Zhang Yingchen) on the Dragon Sky Forum. Founder of the Lingao New Daoism concept:
Excerpts from Zhang Yingchen's Diary:

The meeting is about to be held. I have visited temples in the Lingao area for several consecutive days. Obviously, religious activities in the Lingao area have not yet been on the right track. The status of Daoist and Buddhist clergy in the local area is extremely low, and these clergy themselves cannot be said to possess the qualities of qualified religious personnel. Apart from chanting precious scrolls, they basically lack the qualities of formal religious personnel. Whether it is releasing flaming mouths or bowing in repentance, they are not proficient, and a large part of them are still illiterate.

The low quality of Daoist and Buddhist religious personnel gave Lingao's folk religions a great space for activities, and similarly, gave the Jesuits a great future for development.

After visiting the Lingao Monastery and Dean Wu, I am convinced that if the Lingao Church develops without any checks and balances, it will eventually achieve the status of the state religion in the Transmigrator regime.

However, most of our Transmigrators seem unaware of the significance of the existence of a state religion. Yes, currently our Transmigration Group is a group of elites influenced by atheism, and the Lingao Church, restricted by the Religious Office, cannot compete with the Transmigration Group at any level. However, in this 17th century where compulsory education and materialism have not yet been popularized, the church will undoubtedly have a broader influence than our education.

Our Transmigration Group can be unaffected by its nonsense, but what about our descendants and our subjects? Obviously, we will not use Marxism-Leninism materialism or any theory of industrialized society to influence most of them. In fact, judging from the performance of the Soy Sauce Party members who occupied the vast majority in the Maid Revolution, they will not pay attention to this issue either.

It is conceivable that in a few decades, the Lingao Church will become a pivotal force affecting society, and after the Transmigrators grow old, its influence will continue to expand, and it will even turn back to bite the Transmigrator regime itself.

I think we need a balancer for the Lingao Church to balance the dominance of this monster created by our own hands. Perhaps, this is exactly the mission given to me by Heaven.

In modern times, the various sects of Quanzhen and Zhengyi we see are standard modes of Celestial Daoism. But if we trace back to the oldest Celestial Masters Dao and Taiping Dao, and pay attention to the "Taiping Jing" and "Xiang'er Commentary", we will find that primitive Daoism was not very interested in various methods of pursuing immortality.

For example, "Xiang'er" evaluated the breathing exercises, guiding, and visualization of the alchemists at that time as "fake arts", and called those Daoist sects that sacrificed to ghosts and gods "fake Dao". The "Xiang'er Commentary" advocated keeping precepts to approach the Dao. However, the Celestial Masters Dao soon merged with the Ghost Dao of Ba and Shu, adding a large amount of talisman spells and the like that it originally opposed. Such a religious evolution of "opposing the red flag while carrying the red flag" occurred in various sects in the Middle Ages.

For example, Christianity, influenced by Roman pagan beliefs, began to absorb the gods of various European peoples as saints; Islam in South Asia and Central Asia retained the spirit worship of Shamanism; after Indian Buddhism was introduced into the Central Plains, it combined with Daoist thought to give birth to Zen Buddhism which scolds Buddhas and curses ancestors.

Even our White Priest and Dean Wu of the Religious Office, when spreading Christianity, had to accommodate the customs of the Great Ming.

Doctrine being alienated by heterogeneous civilizations is an inevitable problem in missionary work. Although we Lingao crowd possess knowledge and historical experience far exceeding this era, unfortunately, this problem is still unavoidable. However, Lingao's thoughts are destined to replace old thoughts, and Lingao's religion is destined to replace old religions. Whether it is Roman Catholicism, Orthodoxy, or Buddhism and traditional Daoism, they must all be replaced by Lingao's religion. This is a great ideological war, which tolerates no tenderness and modesty.

Looking at history, general administrative means cannot eliminate old religions. Only when a nation completely converts to a new religion will it completely break with the old religion. That is to say, only religion can eliminate religion.

The task of our Daoist Council is not to completely eliminate the old sects, but to walk into the believers, unite the believers, and mobilize the believers, thereby completely isolating all temple masters, monastery masters, Daoist officials, and monk officials of the old sects, completely breaking the old religious models and religious systems, and establishing new sects obedient to our Transmigrators...

Excerpt from Chairman Zhang Yingchen's "Excerpts from Speech at the Religious Office New Year Seminar"

***********************************************
Father Matteo Ricci has always insisted that there are relics of our Lord's salvation on this ancient land. Regrettably, at the important time when Father Alvaro Semedo participated in the excavation and translation of the Holy Church stele erected by the Emperor of the Tang Empire for our Lord Jesus a thousand years ago (i.e., the Nestorian Stele), Father Matteo Ricci was too late to share the holy relics left in this empire by our Lord Jesus through the hands of separated brothers.

However, I believe that the omnipotent God has long given revelation to ancient Chinese sages in His own way. Only the followers of Pythagoras in the Indian region (the Jesuits once believed that Indian Buddhism and Hinduism were branches of Greek Pythagorean esotericism) polluted the Lord's gospel with their fallacies and poisonous heretical views.

This caused the Confucian philosophers to gradually lose the lofty ideals of their ancestors, and the damage of Pythagorean views to another school of philosophers who received revelation was almost irreversible. It caused these scholars who should have lived in the blessed rose garden to degenerate into alchemists and idol worshipers like Gnostics.

When the erudite Senators of Lingao mention the current status of the old empire, they usually consider the Tartars in the north as the greatest enemy of civilization and faith. They mention Attila the Hun, the Tartar dynasty served by the Venetian Marco Polo, and their distress over the destruction of the ancient and great empire civilization by nomadic peoples.

As a group of descendants of former dynasty nobles living in exile overseas, the "Yuan" dynasty is unforgivable, but in my eyes, a foreign priest's eyes. The most unforgivable crime of the Tartars is that they poisoned the two paths of salvation originally belonging to the Chinese people with the harmful thoughts of Indian believers of Pythagoras, making the wise classics of Confucianism and Daoism that received grace and revelation finally become the rigid rules of the group of philosopher officials "Mandarins" and things played in the hands of Daoists who only know harmful heretical doctrines like alchemy and charms for the soul.

But the salvation of our Lord Christ enabled their most excellent leader to find a new Jerusalem with the best people, like the prophet in Exodus, when the savage pagans almost destroyed the brightest and most glorious side of this country. Here, they preserved the salvation of our Lord, as well as their most glorious morals, traditions, knowledge, and dignity.

They also preserved their own religion, however, this religion has not been poisoned by harmful Indian doctrines. There are countless reasonable factors in it indicating that it once contained the path of salvation of Lord Jesus, and is also the fertile soil most adaptable for the seeds of Jesus Christ to grow and bear fruit.

Thirty years after the publication of this monumental work, the famous "Rites Controversy" broke out between the Empire and the Italian Church. The ignorant and conservative feudal head, the pseudo-Pope Clement XI, moved against the historical trend and brazenly declared the "Records of the Great Empire" as a banned book and included it in the Index of Prohibited Books in Europe. The historically significant movement of Eastern learning spreading to the West also fell into decline due to his series of reactionary measures. This consequently led to Europe gradually falling behind the great tide of historical development.

Letter from Zhang Yingchen to He Ying before departure
When He Ying received Zhang Yingchen's letter, this tall Mongolian doctor had already boarded the ship to the mining area.

Holding this thing which was more of a work plan than a private letter, He Ying had to admire the courage and power of action of this charlatan.

He sat down, unfolded the letter paper, and slowly read the parting words of the first Libationer of Lingao and Chairman of the Daoist Association.

"...The collision between heterogeneous civilizations often results in the advanced eliminating the backward, and the civilized eliminating the barbaric. So in this era, the Jesuits easily eliminated the Mayan priests in South America, and tracing back three hundred years, Islam and Tibetan Buddhism easily made two branches of Mongols accept conversion. However, collision inevitably brings blending. For religion, being tainted by the old traditions of new believers is also unavoidable.

"Comrade Wu Mangshi seems to want to conduct social experiments to change customs and habits in Lingao, just as those Jesuits who built Notre Dame churches like Guan Yin temples for sending children in Macao are trying. Islamic imams in Central Asia and Southeast Asia, and friars of the Jesuits, Dominicans, and Franciscans in South America have all tried this kind of thing. But, without exception, they failed shamefully.

"Herdsmen in Central Asia still trust Shaman wizards, Muslims in the Philippines still worship sacred trees, and goddesses of Maya and Inca continue to occupy the center of South American churches in the appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe. It can be expected that in the future work of the Religious Office, resisting the erosion of old culture will become a long-term and arduous task.

"So, conversion, changing beliefs, and changing customs can only be preliminary work, as Matteo Ricci said 'this is just cutting off some branches and vines in the thorny wasteland'.

"Only by reshaping the soil where the old society and old culture survive can we truly achieve our goal.

"The ultimate goal of transforming faith is to transform civilization, that is, to transfer the medieval agricultural civilization to modern industrial civilization. I hope that I and my successors can always remember this, instead of foolishly falling into some kind of dogmatic fetishistic self-closure and regression.

"Medieval obscurantist religious opium is beneficial to us in the short term, but in the long run, we must get rid of the Catholic style and turn the short-term investment of pulling sheep heads into long-term continuous investment.

"The church should shoulder the obligation of teaching. Apart from ideological education instilled through religious forms, basic education is the top priority of our work. The boring 'controversy over the translation of the name of God', 'controversy over hell and heaven', and 'controversy over the similarities and differences between Taiyi, Chaos, Taiji, Principle and God' among monks, priests, and Confucian scholars in the late Ming Dynasty are nothing more than a set of European medieval philosophy and a set of Asian medieval philosophy competing for orthodoxy and discourse power.

"Our work is not to introduce a set of new opium to facilitate rule, but to serve as a catalyst for the transformation of old society into new society. We are not trying to create a set of old wine in new bottles, replacing old gods with new gods, but using the hands of new gods to gradually erode the foundation of the existence of divine power. The secularization and simplification of religion is a manifestation of social progress in the 17th century. We want to guide this new trend, instead of adding a set of new red tape on the basis of overthrowing old rituals, let alone turning natural fetishism into mechanical fetishism, such boring and unintelligible things.

"In my lifetime, I am afraid I will have to reconcile with the beliefs of the old world. In the Lingao Monastery, perhaps various cults of the 17th century will be born, and in the Daoist Council, perhaps radical retro True Lord Adventists or a Daoist version of the Golden Dawn will appear. But we must grasp education work well. Only a completely secularized civilized world can cut off the specter of the Middle Ages from the root.

At this moment, don't learn from the Sima of Jiangzhou, soaking the green shirt is a bit too ugly. Let us imitate that saint from Wenchuan, shout 'Pour me a bowl of practice wine', and embark on the adventure journey belonging to me and everyone.

Wish me fair winds, old friend."
