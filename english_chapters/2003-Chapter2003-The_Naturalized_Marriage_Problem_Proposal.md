# Chapter 2003 - The Naturalized Marriage Problem Proposal

Now that the Council of Elders had taken Guangdong, with several million more people as resources, not solving this problem was inexcusable no matter what. The moment Liu Xiang entered Guangzhou, civil affairs and the General Staff Political Department jointly issued a "guidance opinion" regarding the marriage problems of military personnel and cadres.

A guidance opinion was just a guidance opinion—how to implement it was still a problem. Liu Xiang had just entered the city. With everything needing to be rebuilt from scratch, plus one major case after another, where would he find time to worry about finding wives for his subordinates? Things got set aside, one thing after another.

Unexpectedly, the County Administrator of Enping took the initiative to submit a document, concerning himself with a matter that wasn't really related to him.

Since ancient times, finding a wife required money. No matter how times changed, the core truth that marriage was a business transaction never altered. In seventeenth-century China, marrying a wife was expressed more nakedly than in later eras—it was a buying and selling relationship.

Though the Council of Elders now had several million more people under their control, looking at the overall picture, women weren't necessarily more numerous than men. Society as a whole still had far fewer eligible women than eligible men, so naturally the "asking price" for women wouldn't be low. Moreover, getting married and establishing a family was equivalent to a new enterprise opening—you needed a house, you needed to acquire at least basic living necessities... none of this could do without the word "money."

Elder Liu and Du Yibin could figure out how to find suitable women—he couldn't manage that and was too lazy to try. But this expense was real and solid. This sum of money naturally couldn't come from the city's fiscal allocation—Liu Xiang couldn't produce it anyway. So in the end, the ball was kicked to the finance and taxation department. Finally, Five Oaks made the decision: present the matter to the Council of Elders for approval, and the expense would come from the "General Office Special Fund."

The "General Office Special Fund," as the name implied, was the budget item controlled by the General Office for various private activities and life services for Elders. The funds came from the Elder Foundation's earnings.

Using this money to handle the nuptials of naturalized cadres would not only save on regular fiscal expenditure but also win hearts and minds. It was also a way of placating a group of Elders who advocated "military privatization"—though it couldn't be done under individual names, at least it was in the name of the Elders.

Wang Qiyi naturally had no objection, but the specific disbursement still had to be managed through their Finance and Taxation Bureau.

"Tell Director Ai that I've looked at the specific budget list—it's too rough. It needs to be sent back for revision." Wang Qiyi said. Most Elders didn't know how to prepare budgets, and the budget proposals they submitted were all too sloppy. In Director Wang's view, this was very undesirable.

"Though procedures are troublesome, we need to build them up step by step."

The budget was sent back, but finding wives for the naturalized continued as usual. The Elder most enthusiastic about this matter, Du Yibin, happened to be back in Guangzhou from Enping on business. He planned to use this window of time to hold a grand matchmaking conference, followed by an impressive mass wedding. The rejected budget hadn't dampened his "entrepreneurial spirit" at all; he was still racing around inside and outside Guangzhou city making the most of his limited time—"finding women."

This Elder Du's concern for naturalized marriage had begun before the conquest of Guangzhou. He'd originally been a rather peculiar existence in the Council of Elders. His position was in the agricultural sector, specifically in breeding—except the animals he bred most were things nobody really understood: "pangolins."

Though in the twenty-first century, pangolins had been nearly hunted to extinction by exotic food enthusiasts, in seventeenth-century Great Ming their numbers were clearly still quite large. Moreover, they didn't have much food value. Elder Du Yibin's stated reason for breeding pangolins was that pangolin scales were important traditional medicine materials, which earned him Liu San's approval.

However, his breeding work was basically classified as "not attending to proper duties" because his degree was in computer science, so he'd also been assigned extra work in the IT department, running between both.

Whether breeding pangolins or fixing computers, neither had anything to do with civil affairs work, yet somehow he'd thought of this. The reason was that the Human Resources department was unwilling to give him able-bodied laborers. The only full-time worker at his pangolin farm was a disabled person. Through frequent contact and conversation, he naturally came to understand these people's troubles.

From this perspective, Elder Du began to feel he should do something for them—after all, he was a person from the twenty-first century.

According to Elder Du's thinking, those most urgently in need of having their marriage problems solved were the disabled soldiers and workers. The former weren't numerous, but the latter were considerable—the industrial sector's casualty rate was several dozen percentage points higher than the military's. There were great numbers of workers disabled by injuries. Though most of these people had been assigned work within their capabilities and had no problems meeting their basic needs, under their conditions, getting married was simply impossible.

From a purely self-interested perspective, the Council of Elders had no need to concern itself with these people's marriage problems. By seventeenth-century moral standards, the Council's arranging simple work for them and guaranteeing their basic livelihood already qualified them as great philanthropists. Helping them marry on top of that was simply superfluous.

"We can't look at this matter from an interest-based perspective. When it comes down to it, it's the same reasoning as when we originally built Cuigang Cemetery and established memorial monuments for fallen soldiers. When a person dies, whether their corpse is abandoned in the wilderness or ceremoniously interred in a coffin—there's really no difference. The funeral and the grave—the dead can't see it, can't know about it. At the end of the day, it's all for the living to see," Du Yibin said at a civil affairs meeting.

The same logic applied to the care of the disabled. Though disabled soldiers and workers had effectively lost their value, their circumstances would greatly influence those ordinary people currently serving and working.

"But we have too many people who need their problems solved. Starting with the disabled first, isn't that..."

"I think they'll understand. We're even considering marriage for the 'useless' disabled—would we not care about their affairs?"

This matter passed "in principle" at the civil affairs level, but passed in principle was just passed. Where to find the "wives" was the problem.

For ordinary cadres, soldiers, and workers, this was merely a matter of time. Civil affairs could organize more matchmaking events, more pairing activities, and things could be gradually resolved. After all, many people had married through free courtship.

But for the disabled personnel that Du Yibin insisted should be prioritized, not many women would be willing to marry them. Even in the twenty-first century, marriage among the disabled mostly remained pairing between disabled people.

Du Yibin had thought long and hard about how to solve this problem, and finally came up with a solution. But it was somewhat risky. After considerable deliberation, he decided to try talking to Ran Yao.

Getting an audience with Ran Yao wasn't easy—he was extremely busy. But this matter absolutely required his approval.

Ran Yao found it strange that an unknown agricultural sector Elder had requested a meeting, but the other party was still an Elder after all. By reason and by courtesy, he had to see him.

"Commissioner Ran, I won't waste your time. I came hoping you could give me a policy exception. I have an idea..." Du Yibin said. "Specifically, could the current female minor offenders serving sentences be given special amnesty or probation, and matched as wives to our disabled soldiers or workers? Under normal circumstances, they'd never be able to marry..."

As he spoke, he handed over his proposal.

"...This is my preliminary conception. You can take a look first."

His opening statement stunned Ran Yao. What was this fellow trying to do?! Prisoner management fell under the judicial sphere—it wasn't within the purview of a Public Security Commissioner like himself at all. Besides, even if he could manage this, he couldn't open up this kind of exception. How would it even work legally?

He opened the proposal and looked it over, regarding Du Yibin with an incredulous gaze. This really was rather fanciful.

"This can't be done. You know the male-female ratio of the population under the Council of Elders' control. Not to mention two wives—even one wife per person can't be achieved. Elder Du is being too generous—two at once!" Ran Yao said. "And there's another way: get the Portuguese to go to Goa and buy Indian women over. Even in the twenty-first century, Indian women's status was very low, never mind the seventeenth century. Worst case, we just spend more money!"

The idea of going overseas to "buy wives" for the naturalized had been proposed by different Elders on different occasions. As for purchase locations, there had been suggestions ranging from nearby neighbors like Vietnam, Japan, and Korea, to Southeast Asia and India. Some had even proposed buying from Europe and the Middle East...

But these various "Human Complementation Plans" had all failed to pass due to the enormous costs. Some had conducted small-scale experiments, but once implementation actually began, the Planning Committee discovered that compared to the population needed, the transportation capacity available was utterly inadequate. The most critical issue was that slave trading required arranging agents locally. When Europeans traded black slaves, they had to rely on local slave traders to supply the "goods." Since there were "agents," agents needed to be left with generous profits—otherwise, nobody would do such hard and risky work.

Beyond these various economic reasons, some also argued that this would artificially create "mixed blood," causing the second generation of naturalized citizens to become not purely "descendants of Huaxia"—in short, there was considerable controversy.

"...Another option is the widows in Guangzhou's Qingjie Hall—remaining widowed is a great waste of resources! Think about it—there must be quite a few such chaste widows throughout the Guangdong greater region. We should mobilize all of them to remarry. I believe they'd certainly be willing."

Though Ran Yao wasn't sure whether these "chaste women" would "certainly be willing," encouraging "widows to remarry" had always been a policy promoted by the Council of Elders, so his thinking wasn't wrong.

Ran Yao frowned and said: "Many naturalized citizens right now don't have wives, and now you want to assign two or three wives to each of these disabled people at once. This won't make a very positive impression."

"That's why I hope for a small-scale, non-public wedding. We don't even need newspaper coverage—at most just report that we're finding wives for former disabled Fubo Army veterans. They're disabled, and daily life is very inconvenient. If they have children later, wouldn't the women be exhausted? Arranging two or three wives for them is meant to help them support each other. Let me say it again: during our era of competing for the realm, such special situations require special handling. We shouldn't worry about minor details. Otherwise, those rural cadres who handle things with crude and violent simplicity should all go to labor reform camps. Though we won't issue marriage certificates, having several Elders serve as officiants and witnesses gives them face. They won't easily divorce, nor will they care about so-called status. Similarly, whether for the Fubo Army, National Army, or police, we can hold several collective weddings. The more Elders who attend as officiants and hosts, the better. What will those Hainan and Guangdong natives think? They provide food and shelter and even help find wives—the rate at which people want to become naturalized will increase geometrically. There are still quite a few natives even in Lingao who refuse to shave their heads. I think the only ones unhappy will be the matchmakers—less money to earn."

Du Yibin's rambling, topsy-turvy speech made Ran Yao laugh. He thought this young man had commendable courage and genuine desire to help, but his thinking was too idealistic.

"Being this generous, the Planning Committee will eat you alive—not to mention your same-surnamed Elder Du will definitely come knocking." Ran Yao shook his head. "Let me put it this way: finding wives for disabled soldiers is something the Civil Affairs department did back in the fifties. At that time, it was for disabled Korean War veterans—mostly severely disabled personnel receiving disability living subsidies who couldn't care for themselves. Civil Affairs found wives for them in the countryside. Calling them wives was really just lifetime caregivers. They didn't give each person two wives either. You doing this would effectively double the current disability subsidies. The Planning Committee will eat you alive, and Five Oaks will skin you."

"Well, times are different—having a few wives doesn't matter. Anyway, if there aren't enough female prisoners, I plan to raise a proposal in the Council to put importing female slaves on the agenda. But the women in Qingjie Hall must be prioritized for assignment to me..."

"You can write the proposal, but take out the clause about two wives per person—it's too divorced from reality, and the optics aren't good. Solving the spousal problem for disabled naturalized citizens is a 'virtuous policy,' but doing it your way turns it into something sneaky and underhanded. It neither serves propaganda purposes nor does it leave people grounds for criticism—we're promoting 'one husband, one wife' after all."

"The other one can be called a life secretary—a caretaker..."

Ran Yao thought, are you really slapping the Council's face this fast? This proposal couldn't even make it to the full assembly discussion before it would be killed. He'd originally wanted to brush him off with a few perfunctory words, but thinking that he genuinely wanted to solve problems for disabled naturalized citizens, he patiently said:

"What about costs? This would be a huge sum of money!" Ran Yao said. "Whether female prisoners or female slaves, they're all ordinary women. Setting aside emotional issues, who wants to spend a lifetime with a disabled man? Right now the wages of disabled naturalized citizens are enough for personal subsistence, but raising a family would be hard. This economic situation simply can't keep a wife around! People have legs, you know. When the time comes, if they up and leave, where will you find them? Never mind two wives—just to keep one wife, you'd need to provide substantial economic subsidies. It can't pass muster with either civil affairs or finance."

"But this would win hearts and minds..."

"Winning hearts and minds also has costs." Ran Yao laughed. "As for proposals to purchase women from India or wherever to solve naturalized citizens' marriage problems, I'm in favor. Prioritizing disabled naturalized citizens' marriage problems, I'm also in favor. If you draft the proposal, I can co-sign. But forget about the female prisoners—there's no way. As for the women in Qingjie Hall—I'm not opposed to that, but I can't make the decision. Talk to Liu Xiang about it."

"This IT guy has quite a lot of gimmicks. He's eyeing up the female prisoners just to save money." Ran Yao watched him leave, shook his head, and lit up the Chuqing-edition cigar. This was a limited edition—Du Yibin didn't smoke, so apparently he'd specifically bought it for "networking."

Du Yibin ran around Guangzhou for several days, met with quite a few Elders, and sent memoranda to various departments seeking support. Clear responses were few and far between. Finding wives for disabled naturalized citizens was something everyone supported in principle, but when it came to specifics, obviously none of the departments wanted to commit resources. In the end, only one Elder named Wang Jun responded to his call for "solving naturalized citizens' marriage problems."

This Elder Wang was one of several marginal Elders dispatched to Guangzhou during the Two Guangs offensive. He had the customary pile of titles, the most important of which was "Chief Engineer, Ministry of Machinery"—a title specifically for engineering Elders who didn't hold administrative positions.

Elder Wang's presence in Lingao was quite low. Outside the Ministry of Machinery, basically nobody knew him, nor did he have any administrative position. This wasn't because he was content to be marginal or lacking in ability—his specialty was simply too disconnected from the current stage of productive forces.

His specialty was: automotive electronics construction and maintenance. During the era of vigorously developing steam engines, there was no business for him. Going to the Vehicle Factory to help, he couldn't do anything—because he actually worked on electronics. The Electricity department had scouted him hoping he could help out, but he specialized in low voltage and knew nothing about high voltage. Borrowed here today, borrowed there tomorrow—he'd done everything, mastered nothing. He'd somehow become a jack-of-all-trades important figure in the machinery department. His current main work was leading a few naturalized citizens to maintain the tractors, vehicles, and construction equipment brought through the crossing, while also learning to repair steam engines on the side.

After the Two Guangs offensive began, large numbers of inland motorized vessels had been deployed—and the maintenance of these vessels' steam engines, gearboxes, and boilers had become a heavy burden. Elder Wang was dispatched to Guangzhou to work on mechanical maintenance at the temporary shipyard on Henan Island.

This work was both demanding and very important. Elder Wang had been busy for months, barely even entering Guangzhou city. The demanding workload was one thing, but he always felt he was stuck in a "forgotten corner," pondering whether he should start some "project" to demonstrate his presence in Guangdong.

Just as he was thinking about this problem, Du Yibin's "Disabled Naturalized Citizens' Marriage Problem" memorandum arrived in his hands—Elder Du had distributed copies to all Elders in Guangdong regardless of whether they were relevant.

Elder Wang, like other Elders, had "always attached importance" to solving naturalized citizens' marriage problems, but he wasn't very impressed with Elder Du's specific solutions.

"Female prisoners, female prisoners—where would you get so many female prisoners? Plus giving each person two wives—too outlandish!" Wang Jun thought. "Buying foreign women is more realistic."

He'd always found it strange: why was Quark Qiong's slave-trading activity in Southeast Asia limited to males? Obviously some women could be loaded aboard too. Women were equally good laborers—both agriculture and industry needed large female populations. Using them to solve naturalized citizens' marriage problems would kill two birds with one stone.

As for the language barrier, Wang Jun didn't think it was an issue. They could marry first, then cultivate feelings later—in the twenty-first century, there was still such a thing as mail-order brides.

Suddenly he recalled that when interacting with workers at the shipyard, the workers mentioned that local natives were quite interested in naturalized workers, often asking about their income and marital status.

"Right—we should solve this locally after all!"
