# Chapter 1071 - Tacit Understanding

Lu Yang said: "For those who really have no way to live, Master Lu has some properties in Fujian and Zhejiang; they can be sent there to work as tenant farmers and reclaim wasteland."

Sun Yuanhua didn't quite believe it—he was from Jiading, and Zhejiang was close by. Although northern Zhejiang was fertile land, it had long been fully cultivated with fields connecting to the wild; there was no place left to reclaim. Southern Zhejiang was all mountainous with many people and little land; the common people there even had to leave their homes to work as laborers, merchants, or tenant farmers elsewhere to survive. As for Fujian, although he hadn't been there, he knew it was a province of many mountains and little land, producing not enough grain to feed its own population, with a large number of people flowing out every year.

Naturally, Master Lu's collection of refugees had another destination—one only had to look at the trestle bridge extending into the bay to know. Besides the large number of ships docking, what was the use of building such a long trestle bridge? It was clearly for transporting people by ship.

Thinking of ships, Sun Yuanhua's gaze stopped on the ships by the trestle bridge—his eyelids twitched.

This place was not close to the pier, but the weather was clear today, and against the blue background, the ships moored by the trestle bridge could be seen very clearly.

Beside the trestle bridge, in addition to some small fishing boats common locally, there were more than a dozen large ships of over two hundred *liao*! Sun Yuanhua was deeply aware of the importance of the navy in cross-sea support and maneuvering for operations in Liaodong. When he was the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou, he strove to manage the navy. To expand the scale of the fleet, in addition to trying to build them himself, he also sent people specifically to Joseon to purchase large naval warships.

He didn't expect such a massive fleet to be gathered right under his nose! He suppressed his surprise and excitement, rubbed his eyes, and looked carefully at the ships at the pier.

Although he couldn't see the details clearly, the ships appeared to be in excellent condition. The sails and rigging were almost new, and flags were flying at the stern—blue and white bilingual flags. There were also protrusions covered with tarpaulins on the deck, which looked like cannons by their shape.

"Are these ships all Manor Lord Lu's ships?" Sun Yuanhua asked, pretending to be casual.

"Exactly," Lu Yang said. "They are all under Manor Lord Lu's jurisdiction. Would Sir like to go and have a look?"

Lu Wenyuan did not intend to hide his true identity—after all, deep cooperation was to follow. Furthermore, if he didn't show a little muscle, the other party might not trust him.

"Very good," Sun Yuanhua nodded.

Guided by Lu Yang, Sun Yuanhua immediately went to the trestle bridge. There were a total of 9 naval vessels docked at the Qimu Island pier: one Type 901 gunboat and eight special service boats. Because the appearance of the Type 901 gunboat was very different from ordinary ships, the *Daishuang* was moored in the middle of two rows of special service boats. Not only the cannons on the deck but also the smokestack were camouflaged with tarpaulins and fishing nets.

Sun Yuanhua immediately boarded a special service boat—this was a *Guang* ship (Cantonese junk) type not commonly seen locally. From the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang all the way to Liaodong, because there were many shallow shoals along the coast, the mainstream ship type was the flat-bottomed *Sha* ship (Sand boat). Among the warships of the Dengzhou and Laizhou Navy, there were also many of the *Sha* ship type. However, this kind of ship had a shallow draft and slow speed; as a warship, it only enjoyed an advantage because its opponent was the Later Jin, which had almost no navy.

He looked with interest at the modified poop deck, masts, and rigging. He was particularly impressed by the deck that was shiny enough to reflect a person. This was an impossible thing in his impression.

Boarding the poop deck, Sun Yuanhua developed a strong interest in the steering wheel helming the ship—at this time, sailing ships, both Chinese and foreign, used a tiller to steer. This convenient and sensitive device, the steering wheel, immediately caught his attention.

He tried turning the wheel, found it quite light and agile, and clicked his tongue in wonder.

Then, at his request, Lu Yang ordered men to uncover the tarpaulins on the cannons, revealing the 24-pounder smoothbore cannon and the 68-pounder carronade mounted on the open gun deck.

Sun Yuanhua was an "artillery expert." Although his knowledge came mostly from Western missionaries who couldn't be called professionals, he had access to a large number of Western firearm books and real objects, and had long-term contact and cooperation with Portuguese soldiers, so his ability to identify artillery was unmatched in the Imperial Court.

He saw at a glance that the cannons before him were larger than the Hongyipao (Red Barbarian Cannons) bought from Macau, which the Imperial Court regarded as "Heavy Weapons of the State." Not to mention those few thick and short heavy cannons, even the muzzle of the seemingly smaller long cannon was much larger than a Hongyipao.

"Does this cannon fire a 24-jin shot?" Sun Yuanhua asked. At that time, Chinese translations of Western artillery works did not convert Chinese and Western weights and measures; pounds became *jin* (catties) directly, and length units became construction *chi*. Although Sun Yuanhua was an expert, he ultimately couldn't read Portuguese or Italian, so he made the mistake along with everyone else.

Lu Yang naturally knew this. Although his unit of measurement was wrong, just looking at it and knowing the approximate caliber of the artillery counted as very professional.

"It is indeed a 24-jin shot."

"What about that big cannon over there? I wonder how many jin is the shot?"

"That is a 68-jin shot."

"68 jin?!" Sun Yuanhua was quite shocked. In his perception, a Hongyipao firing a 12-pound shot was already a "giant cannon." Yet the cannons on this ship fired 24-jin shots as a standard, and there were even 68-jin shots!

"Since it fires a 24-jin shot, presumably it must be filled with a lot of gunpowder," Sun Yuanhua raised a second question. "I see this cannon body is very thin, and it is not cast of copper. I wonder if it can avoid exploding?"

The Ming Dynasty introduced Western artillery, but did not fully introduce standardized artillery training and usage. Consequently, there were many problems ranging from gunpowder charge quantity and firing frequency control to forced cooling of the barrel. Coupled with various material and process problems when copying the cannons, barrel explosion accidents occurred frequently.

In order to ensure the safety of firing cannons, the only way when casting cannons was to increase the thickness of the barrel. The result was that the cast cannons were very heavy. This trend developed to the end, where during the Opium War, cannons weighing several thousand jin appeared, firing shots equivalent to only European 12-pound, or even 9-pound or 6-pound shots.

In contrast, Lingao's smoothbore cannons were all manufactured using integral casting, heat treatment, hammer forging, and then drilling. The raw materials and processing methods used were hundreds of years ahead, creating cannons far superior in quality to traditional cast artillery.

"It doesn't matter," Lu Yang smiled slightly. "Not to mention 68-jin shots, even cannons with shots of over a hundred jin would be fine."

"Shots of over a hundred jin!" Sun Yuanhua repeated in astonishment—in his view, a 68-jin shot was terrifying enough, let alone over a hundred jin!

He incredulously sized up the artillery before him again. The smooth muzzle and the shining cannon body gave him a strong visual impact. The impression the entire cannon gave him was actually—"exquisite."

His gaze fell on the carriage beneath the cannon body. It was not the Western-style four-wheeled wooden carriage he had authorized personally, but mounted on an exquisite iron gun carriage with many iron rods, wheels, and some copper and iron parts he couldn't understand. Some looked familiar—similar to the objects in the *Diagrams and Explanations of the Wonderful Machines of the Far West*, but not completely similar.

*I wonder what use this pile of objects under the cannon body has?*

As if to answer his doubts, Lu Yang opened the cannon travel lock and gently pushed the cannon.

The heavy cannon body actually began to turn, and under the push of a young man who didn't look very strong. It could be seen that he hadn't used his full strength either.

Sun Yuanhua had been in Liaodong and had experienced actual combat. Of course, he knew how significant such easy movement of the muzzle direction was for actual combat. And this problem was something neither the Portuguese/Franks nor the missionaries had a solution for!

Then Lu Yang rapidly turned the handwheel, and the cannon body gradually rose. Sun Yuanhua was dumbfounded—the Portuguese adjusted the elevation of the muzzle by using a hammer to beat a wedge-shaped piece of wood. Not only was the adjustment speed slow, but slightly uneven force would cause it to go too far.

Everyone said the West had wonderful machines that China did not possess. However, the various "wonderful machines" on this ship far exceeded the West.

By now, his originally vague guess had become a conclusion. Master Lu was a "Short-haired Thief" (Kun Thief)!

Except for the Short-haired Thieves, who in the world could create such exquisite and wonderful machinery? Things that happened in Guangdong had more or less reached Sun Yuanhua's ears—especially since his correspondence with the Jesuits in Macau was quite frequent, and he employed Portuguese people in the army, so the news he grasped about the Senate was much more detailed than ordinary officials in the Court. He knew about the new and strange things like the "Big Iron Ship," "Iron Fast Ship," "Big Cannons," and "Fast Guns" of the Short-haired Thieves.

Although the ship before him was a *Guang* ship, these cannons were out-and-out Australian goods! Master Lu and the young man before him were both Australians, and this stockade on Qimu Island was also a genuine "Den of Short-haired Thieves"!

They built a stockade here and painstakingly took in refugees; it went without saying that they must be transporting them to Hainan Island. Hainan Island was located on the southern frontier and was sparsely populated. The Portuguese said that the Short-haired Thieves had been trying to attract immigrants from the mainland. The Short-haired Thieves on Qimu Island must have the same purpose!

Sun Yuanhua's feeling about the "Short-haired Thieves" was simply: The other party was nothing more than a group of businessmen hoping to do business and make money. As long as the Great Ming did not hinder their making money, they would not harm the Great Ming. They were much better than the Tartars who were ferocious and evil and capable only of robbery and killing.

Usually, whether from the Portuguese or people coming from Guangdong, the impression of the Australians mentioned was not bad: saying they were skilled in industry and good at commerce, trustworthy in business, and honest and reliable. Not to mention that the Church side praised the "Australians" as if angels had descended.

Although he understood in his heart, Sun Yuanhua was not in a hurry to point it out. Sometimes it was better to pretend to be confused. Moreover, he didn't see any malice from them towards him.

These people took immense pains to rescue him from the rebel army; they must have a plan. He might as well watch and wait to see what exactly they wanted to do. In any case, he, Sun Yuanhua, already had nothing left.
