# Chapter 2413: Difficulties

Li Yao'er had come into contact with all sorts of people outside these few years, and her skill in judging people was no longer that of Ameng of Wu [no longer ignorant]. Seeing the fire in this young man's eyes for a moment, he obviously had thoughts of clinging to power. She couldn't help but be secretly amused: the desire for fame and profit was indeed everyone's soft spot! Thinking that she could rejuvenate a nation with a word if she pleased, or destroy a nation with a word, manipulating the fates of ordinary people like playthings, she couldn't help feeling proud in her heart.

Thinking of this, a slight smile appeared at the corners of her mouth. She said, "I came here to promote good breeds and improve the silk industry..." As she spoke, she introduced her specific tasks in detail. "Choosing Fenshenghe as a partner is naturally because I fancy that you have engaged in the sericulture industry in this area for many years and are familiar with the local situation. So I want to trouble you to speak about all aspects of local silkworms, mulberries, silk, and weaving."

Actually, Li Yao'er had more or less understood some situations in this regard, which included materials provided by Chen Xuan as well as information she obtained by visiting Fenshenghe's craftsmen and accountants herself.

However, an important experience she summarized from promoting promotion these years was that when doing field surveys, one must collect as much information as possible, because the situations everyone spoke of mostly had discrepancies. Some were deliberate lies, some were unconscious embellishments. Moreover, this information often converged due to some marvelous "group psychology," bringing completely wrong conclusions to the collector.

Since the young man in front of her was the young owner of Fenshenghe and had years of practical experience, the information he provided would have both overview and accuracy in details, being very valuable.

To introduce the local situation, Chen Lin naturally spoke without reserve. He said, "There are quite a few families raising silkworms locally..."

Xiangshan County was formerly a silted sandbar at the Pearl River estuary before the Ming Dynasty. It was only connected to the mainland in the Ming Dynasty, so there were many sandy fields. Because the terrain was low-lying, there were also many fish ponds. It bordered Shunde, the oldest silk production area in Guangdong, and influenced by it, farmers mostly planted mulberries and raised silkworms. But the scale was not large.

After the Longqing Opening of the Seas, influenced by the surge in raw silk and satin exports, local sericulture households increased significantly, and planting mulberries and raising silkworms gradually became a trend. However, the output was still incomparable to traditional sericulture areas like Shunde and Foshan.

"besides Xiangshan, Shunde, and Foshan, which other places within the scope of Guangzhou Prefecture have a scaled sericulture industry?" Li Yao'er asked.

"Dongguan also has. Speaking of which, it's actually larger in scale than locally."

"I see the conditions here are not bad; it should be able to raise more silkworms."

"The words are true, only our sales here are limited. If we raise too many, the raw silk has no outlet."

"Oh?" Li Yao'er became interested. These were situations she couldn't get when chatting with others. She continued to ask:

"I remember there are many raw silk and satins exported from Guangzhou. They are all shipped out by thousands upon thousands. How can they not be sold?"

Chen Lin said the local silkworm breeds were not good, and the raw silk produced was of poor quality. It couldn't sell for a good price whether domestically or for export.

"Don't look at how there are many weaving households over in Guangzhou and Foshan, but some varieties of satin must use Lake Silk [a high quality silk from Huzhou] to weave—local silk isn't tough enough."

"How many weaving households and workshops are there in Guangzhou and Foshan? What about your local area?"

"This, this small one has no way of knowing. About one or two thousand households there are. Locally, there are about dozens of weaving households, and only one weaving workshop, Fenshenghe—actually, even in Guangzhou and Foshan, weaving workshops are not many. Mostly they are weaving households."

This was roughly the same as the intelligence Li Yao'er obtained in Guangzhou. According to the materials given to her by the Guangzhou Municipal Government, there were five major guilds inside and outside Guangzhou city: "Python Robe Guild," "Eighteen Guild," "Eleven Guild," "Golden Color Guild," and "Canton Gauze Guild," plus more than a dozen small guilds, involving all processes from reeling silk, pounding and refining, warping, refining and dyeing, to weaving... There were more than 2,500 weaving households with one loom per household or a few looms.

If counting subordinate counties like Foshan, Dongguan, Shunde, and Xiangshan, the weaving households in the entire Guangzhou Prefecture would not be fewer than three thousand.

Discussing only production scale and output, the silk weaving industry of Guangzhou Prefecture ranked among the best in the entire Great Ming, but the quality of raw silk restricted the further expansion of production scale.

"So you say you also need to use guest silk here?"

"As long as we make satins with woven patterns, we must use Lake Silk. If being particular, it has to be 'Thin Silk'." Chen Lin said, "My father also thought about using local silk as a substitute and thought of many methods with the weavers, but either the warp threads broke easily when lifting patterns and couldn't be woven, or the patterns woven out barely were rough and ugly... In short, it was unsuccessful." He was quite helpless. "I did hear that Lake Silk is tough because it is baked dry with fire when collecting cocoons and reeling silk, not air-dried. But we tested it ourselves; although better, it was still inferior to Lake Silk—thinking about it, this is a secret method; how could it be easily learned by others?"

Li Yao'er disapproved: people in this timeline were particularly superstitious about secret recipes and secret arts. Actually, the secret of Lake Silk's toughness wasn't rare to speak of. Fire baking was only one reason; the decisive factor was actually the silkworm breed.

As for why only Huzhou had such silkworm breeds, it was simply because Huzhou, as a major production area of the sericulture industry, had a natural scale effect. Industrial aggregation promoted the refinement of division of labor and the improvement of technology. When Li Yao'er was in Hangzhou, she visited almost all counties producing sericulture and silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Whether in scale, technology, or related industrial and commercial organizations, the Suzhou and Hangzhou prefectures of the 17th century ranked first in the country.

"Have you never thought about introducing Huzhou silkworm breeds?" Li Yao'er asked.

"How could we not have thought of it," Chen Lin sighed. "But to make silkworm farmers change breeds is as difficult as ascending to heaven!"

He spoke of his father once buying silkworm seeds from Huzhou to let farmers test raise them, but surprisingly not a single household was willing. Later, he could only hire female workers to raise them himself. Unknown if it was a water and soil problem or other reasons, the silkworms raised died in large numbers. Not only was a lot of money lost, but he was also ridiculed by people in the clan.

"Since then, my late father was disheartened and didn't mention this matter of improving silkworm breeds again."

Li Yao'er felt quite empathetic. When she promoted silkworm seeds in Hangzhou, she also spent countless efforts. There were also many reversals during the period. To tell the truth, it was completely a losing business; it was impossible to carry on purely by relying on individuals or small groups. Fei Dasheng's sericulture improvement in Wujiang not only received support from the local government at that time, but capitalists in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk weaving industry also provided a lot of aid. Even so, her sericulture improvement stumbled along. Let alone a small workshop like Chen Lin's father's.

"This silkworm breed improvement is not a matter of one morning and one evening. Even in Suzhou and Hangzhou, it is not easy to do." Li Yao'er said, "I looked at the machines in the factory; it seems you both make silk and weave satin here."

Chen Lin said after purchasing raw silk from silkworm farmers, Fenshenghe had to go through a series of processes like silk conditioning, weft winding, warping, and pasting before putting it on the loom to weave various satins. After weaving, it also had to be boiled, refined, and dyed. However, these front and back processes were mostly outsourced to specialized artisan households to do. The weaving workshop itself mainly did weaving processes requiring larger equipment.

The traditional silk textile industry rarely had large-scale production. Even in the Qing Dynasty when industry and commerce were more developed, satin weaving was mostly still small weaving households with one or two looms. The production model was an outsourcing model of "distributing materials to get goods, selling goods." The Yarn and Satin Shop distributed production raw materials and loom materials to weaving households. The weaving households produced at home and returned them to the Yarn and Satin Shop to settle processing fees after completion. The satins were sold by the Yarn and Satin Shop. Under this dispersed production model, product specifications were not uniform, and quality was good and bad.

Fenshenghe was also this model in the past. In Chen Lin's father's hands, he felt that the quality of products produced this way could never be guaranteed. Sometimes when seeing new patterns and varieties in Guangzhou city and bringing them back for weaving households to weave, the whole process was also particularly slow. Therefore, he decided to set up a site to weave himself.

"Unexpectedly, your father had quite some foresight." Li Yao'er smiled.

"The Chief overpraises. However, setting up a site to weave oneself is also not easy. Just the verbal lawsuits fought were countless—there were originally many weaving households in this village who relied on Fenshenghe distributing materials and weaving to pass their days. Hearing my father wanted to set up a site himself, they all came to the door to make noise. Among them were many clansmen. If my family weren't the direct line of the eldest branch, and the clan elders came forward to mediate, this Fenshenghe would probably have been smashed long ago."

"How was it resolved later? Just mediation probably couldn't settle it."

"Nothing more than spending money to eliminate disaster." Chen Lin smiled bitterly. "Later my father discussed with the clan elders. Whoever was willing to enter the weaving workshop to work, the workshop would accept them all, and weaving fees would be the same as in the past; secondly, for male laborers above fifteen in the clan, each person was given one *dou* of rice per month. Only then were things calmed down."

"This expense is truly not small!"

"Although not small, it was worth it. Without the clan's protection, opening this weaving workshop here, how could there be such peace! Let alone water bandits and bad people coveting wealth, many weaving households in this county glared like tigers, wishing Fenshenghe would be burned clean by a fire! Those secretly cursing my father and son to die soon were probably also not few—now they can be considered to have fulfilled half their wish!" He sighed.

Li Yao'er remembered when she first came to Fenshenghe, although the houses were preserved well, the internal facilities and machines had traces of intentional destruction.

Chaotic soldiers and bandits robbing, nothing more than looting soft goods and wealth. They were not interested in these heavy "money-making tools," let alone specifically destroying them. This obviously had the intent of venting anger.

Associating with when Phoenix Villa was besieged when she was in Hangzhou back then, almost causing a major disaster. Although there was Hao Yuan instigating from within, the series of sericulture improvements and reeling factories done were also one of the reasons.

Reform and improvement, no matter how good the intention, as long as it touched vested interests, would inevitably cause a counterattack. Thinking of this, she felt her choice of Nansha here was truly very correct, and a trace of a smile couldn't help appearing on her face. She said:

"Since ancient times, doing a career has not been an easy thing, especially such earth-shaking careers. However, our Senate either doesn't do it, or does it to the end. Fenshenghe now advances and retreats together with the Senate, and will definitely become a top-ranking silk textile enterprise in the future."
