# Chapter 388 - Pigs and Cattle

The farm had two pairs of Landrace pigs and one pair of Northeastern Min pigs as initial breeding stock. To expand the pig population, relying solely on brought-in sows wasn't enough—it wasted the precious semen of breeding boars. A sow could only produce two litters yearly, while a boar could naturally breed 20-30 sows annually. With artificial insemination, one boar could cover nearly a thousand sows yearly.

So Yang Baogui specifically collected Lingao's most representative native breed—the Lingao pig—as maternal stock, rapidly expanding populations through artificial insemination. Local pig farming was fairly developed—every farm household raised pigs—but unfortunately standards were too poor. By modern husbandry standards, all were malnourished. Yang Baogui had barely managed to buy about ten passable sows for breeding, plus carefully selected and raised over ten gilts as future breeding stock.

Because Xiong Buyou constantly lamented protecting purebred Lingao pigs—every time he discussed how Lingao's animal husbandry station had hybridized away purebred Lingao pigs, Xiong Buyou grew indignant—Yang Baogui specifically obtained several growing pigs from farmers for fattening. He discovered Lingao pigs weren't suited for modern large-scale agricultural production—growth period was too long, weight gain unprecedentedly slow. He asked locals and learned fattening a 200-*jin* pig took 24 months before market. Compared to modern pigs' one-year cycle, quite uneconomical.

"It's understandable that Lingao's animal husbandry bureau hybridized Lingao pigs. Otherwise how could they meet such export volumes?"

"You're also hybridizing Lingao pigs now."

"But I'm preserving several purebreds—I'll keep a few breeding animals of each variety. Preserving original strains is important."

The newly-built pigpen rows were mostly still empty. Lingao's winters weren't particularly cold, but summers were quite humid and hot with heavy rain plus typhoon concerns. So Yang Baogui had chosen single-slope open-style pens for his piggery design—good for ventilation and cooling. Pen materials were quite refined, with cement-smoothed floors throughout. The entire piggery was built sturdy to withstand strong winds with good waterproofing.

"Summer typhoons are no joke," Yang Baogui said. "Building cheap now, when the piggery collapses and crushes pigs—that's the real loss."

Wu Nanhai noticed a large area near the piggery fenced off with sturdy bamboo. The soil was churned chaotically, with several black mud pits.

"That's the pigs' exercise ground." Yang Baogui said. "Though we're not raising 'jogging pigs,' moderate exercise benefits appetite. The mud pits are also something they love—plus disease prevention."

Around the piggery and exercise yard, many plants had been placed, including windbreak tree seedlings. Pumpkins grew along piggery wall-bases; trellises over open-air pens supported squash. Not only did these shade and cool the pens, they supplemented feed.

"These pigs really live well. Surrounding sanitation looks good too."

"Of course. Animals have psychological stress too. Don't think pigs enjoy dirty, smelly environments. Happy pigs get sick less, grow faster, with better meat quality. Breeding pigs need hormonal vigor."

"Look, these are purebred Lingao pigs." Yang Baogui pointed at about ten weaned piglets sleeping in a pen. "Lingao pork really does taste good, especially roast suckling pig." Yang Baogui smacked his lips. "So we raise some separately. Let Xiong Buyou make you roast suckling pig."

Here strict separate housing was implemented. Yang Baogui told Wu Nanhai there were nine different pen types alone for different pig statuses and ages. Each pen type varied in area based on head count, with slightly different equipment configurations. Additionally, there were specialized breeding rooms and sow farrowing sheds.

"So-called scientific pig farming doesn't necessarily require complete feed, antibiotics, disinfectants, and vaccines—those are unavoidable necessities of modern commercial mass production. With our limited conditions, many simple effective techniques can achieve good results—just with somewhat lower scale and efficiency. But absolutely eco-friendly."

"Take this piglet pen for example." Yang Baogui had him look at the floor—iron grating raised one meter high on stone stands.

"This technique is called 'platform weaning.' Piglet droppings fall through to be absorbed by bedding below. The platform stays clean and dry, so piglets don't easily get dysentery. Survival rates are much higher. Very simple principle, not hard to implement."

"Somewhat like 'elevated platform poultry raising.'"

"Correct—related techniques actually." Yang Baogui said. "Also automatic waterers. I asked the Industrial Committee to make them last time. Those guys insisted they needed plastic or rubber. What plastic or rubber? Just use a lever-type valve. Minor leakage doesn't matter. But with automatic waterers, not only is pig drinking water sanitary, pen hygiene improves. Pigs get sick less—no need for constant antibiotics."

The homemade waterers from the Industrial Committee's machinery shop used mostly ceramic and bamboo, except for a few metal parts. Water flowed from an elevated reinforced-concrete tank, with thick bamboo pipes for water lines. When pigs nudged a bamboo lever, water flowed from a ceramic reservoir into a drinking tray below. This equipment leaked somewhat, but was cleaner than pouring water into stone troughs and wasted less.

"Another example is feed delivery. Here they still use traditional 'thin soup plenty feeding'—watery pig feed, fed until full. Looks like it saves feed, but too much water affects digestion and actually hinders fattening. As for cooking pig feed—completely unnecessary. Not only damages nutritional value but easily causes nitrite poisoning. Wastes labor and fuel. Except for slop, regular feed can be fed raw. Many such simple improvements can be made."

Yang Baogui's current pig-raising priority was expanding Northeastern Min pig breeding. In modern society, beyond using them as hybrid maternal stock, Northeastern Min pigs were basically no longer raised as meat pigs because of excessive fat deposition—pigs that loved growing fatty meat. Modern demand was for maximum lean meat: besides lean-meat breeds, there were "jogging pigs" and even ractopamine shortcuts. So this breed wasn't popular. But for the transmigrator collective, pigs besides providing meat also bore the task of supplying fat as an industrial resource.

After pigs, cattle were the largest livestock group. Historically, Hainan's main exports included cattle. Lingao had considerable water buffalo and yellow cattle locally. Li territories were the main local cattle source. Over a hundred cattle had been continuously shipped from Lingao Li territory trade and Changhua Fortress, greatly expanding the cattle farm's scale.

The cattle farm's cattle mainly served as draft animals. Currently not much used in field labor—mainly cargo transport. Ox-cart transport was becoming the transmigrator collective's main land transport method. Yang Baogui needed both rapid herd expansion and draft animal supply. Accelerating cattle imports from Changhua was optimal—arrivals could be put to work after brief rest and conditioning. Cattle had low feed requirements with no feed supply concerns.

He categorized arriving cattle: water buffalo meat was tough and coarse, so they primarily served as draft animals for plowing and hauling—breeding scale controlled. Main breeding focused on various yellow cattle. Yellow cattle could pull wagons and serve dual purposes: meat and leather.

The cattle were resting now—afternoon, weather hot. Several farm workers were sprinkling water around cattle sheds for cooling. These cattle, bearing heavy daily transport duties, received particularly attentive care—not only daily concentrated feed supplements but guaranteed adequate rest.

"Quite a lot of cattle," Wu Nanhai said. "Seems beef might actually become widely available first."

"Actually for us, ideal livestock are cattle and sheep—just need grass. Pigs require lots of grain. Green feed is only supplementary. Local pig-fattening custom is feeding rice—too wasteful."

"Large-scale sweet potato planting is precisely for feed grain security. But cattle also need grain, right? Corn and such."

"Traditional cattle farming was purely grass-fed. Special green fodder also works. Corn-fed cattle only work in countries with excessively favorable conditions like America." Yang Baogui sighed—he had a special fondness for North America.

They passed the breeding bull shed—fencing here was extremely heavy. Bulls were temperamental, large-bodied and strong—care was needed for both feeding and working. But Yang Baogui didn't think much of local breeding bulls—only keeping a few as original stock preservation. Currently pregnant local cows had all been inseminated with frozen semen from various purpose-specific improved breeds brought from modern times.

Breeding cows had all been served in spring. Pregnant cows were housed individually, each stall displaying cards with cow number, age, conception date, due date, own breed, and sire breed.

Seeing Yang Baogui approach, several cows extended their heads, pairs of large, gentle, moist eyes staring at him, lowing softly.

"See—they all recognize me." Yang Baogui joked, stroking one cow's neck. "This one's precious—she's carrying a Holstein calf. Future milk supply depends on her offspring." He checked the feed trough for consumption patterns, then compared with the blackboard on the wall to see if handlers had accurately recorded feeding. Yang Baogui strictly controlled feed delivery—hay, concentrated feed, salt—all timed and measured.
