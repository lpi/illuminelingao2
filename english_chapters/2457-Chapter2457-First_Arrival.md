# Chapter 2457 - First Arrival

The natives currently on the deck were all "knowledgeable": a popular new entertainment for the wealthy class above the middle class in Guangzhou was participating in the "Pearl River Day Tour" of the "Ziming House Entertainment Company": taking a paddle steamer from Bai'etan, sailing all the way to Macau, and passing through Huangpu Port, where they could see various naval warships docked there. So this scene could no longer arouse too much interest in them.

At 16:00 on January 22, the *Baiyunshan* docked at Ma'ao Passenger Terminal No. 1. As the gangway was hooked up, the voyage of two days and two nights came to an end.

The inspection group, led by a naturalized cadre, disembarked from the passenger ship. After floating on the sea for two days, they felt a bit unsteady as soon as they landed. The Planning Committee staff who came to pick them up had already come forward, and the group left the wharf through a dedicated exit.

Because Guangdong and Guangxi had been incorporated under the Senate's rule, passengers from these two provinces did not need to go through customs declaration and entry registration. However, those from "epidemic risk areas" in Guangdong and Guangxi still had to implement a 15-20 day quarantine policy.

The inspection group came from Guangzhou, the "safest" place in Guangdong and Guangxi, so naturally, they did not need to undergo quarantine. After being taken to a hall to fill out a "temporary household registration form" that included health status, they could enter Lingao.

In this hall, the Chen uncle and nephew finally acknowledged each other. After the excitement of "meeting an old friend in a foreign land" which both sides were well aware of, Chen Ding learned that not only Chen Lin but also Chen Yue had come. This surprised him greatly. He asked how the siblings came to Lingao.

"It is also a coincidence," Chen Lin said.

Since Chen Lin decided to cling to Li Yao'er and contend with his second uncle to the end, he worked with peace of mind in Nansha, persuading craftsmen to return to work, helping Li Yao'er debug new machines, and promoting the mulberry fish pond, putting in a lot of effort. Li Yao'er was very satisfied with his performance.

Li Yao'er was satisfied with him, but Second Uncle Chen Xuan was not. Seeing his nephew's "sacred favor" growing daily and knowing the business better than himself, he feared that if this continued, he would become dispenseable in front of Chief Li. So he often muttered in front of Li Yao'er while secretly encouraging his subordinates to make trouble. Less than half a month after Chen Lin returned to Nansha, the situation became subtle.

Li Yao'er was also in a dilemma at this time because both people were useful to her. In order to temporarily alleviate the conflict and make time for herself to solve this matter thoroughly, she decided to send Chen Lin away temporarily. She would first use Chen Xuan and his "little brothers" to complete the urgent mulberry fish pond promotion work and the expansion of the silk weaving factory.

It happened that the Planning Committee's "Production Capacity Expansion" plan was being implemented, and the silk weaving industry was part of it. Li Yao'er took this opportunity to sign Chen Lin up for the inspection group, letting him go to Lingao to broaden his horizons and gain some new professional knowledge.

Hearing that he could go to Lingao to study, Chen Lin was naturally happy to obey. Originally, he wanted to bring Chen Qing, but Li Yao'er insisted he bring his sister. She said the silk industry would absorb a large number of female workers, and training of female technical and management personnel should start now, forcing him to bring Chen Yue along.

"...So Sister Yue and I came to Lingao. I have a pass issued by Chief Li and took the Australian official ship, arriving in Guangzhou in just one day. If we weren't setting off the next day, I would have planned to visit Uncle's residence."

"I had been looking forward to your coming. When you sent Chen Qing to say you couldn't come, I was very disappointed. Fortunately, Master Ding came!" Wu Yijun laughed. "It is truly destiny that our Chen and Wu families should build this career!" He patted Chen Lin's shoulder excitedly. "Lin'er, you are truly young and promising! Study well in Lingao. If you want to open a silk factory in the future, Uncle will also invest a few shares to support you."

"Third Uncle, your head..."

"It's nothing, it's nothing." Chen Ding touched his head, which was still wrapped in gauze. He recounted his experience from Sanliang to Guangzhou. "...Although I suffered an unexpected calamity, at least I am still safe. Wealth goes but people are safe; there is still plenty to gain in this world!"

Wu Yijun gave a thumbs up: "Brother indeed has great spirit!"

Chen Ding said, "The dead are like the river flowing away; in everything, one must look forward. How can one brood over the past?"

The two talked and laughed with high spirits. On the contrary, Chen Lin and his sister were not in high spirits. Once the procedures were completed here, Chen Xiaobing walked over holding a small flag: "Everyone, you have worked hard on the journey. But please persist for a moment longer. In a while, we will take the city rail at Ma'ao Station to the hotel where you will stay in Bairen City. After checking in, please do not leave the hotel. Tonight at six o'clock, leaders of the Planning Committee will host a banquet for you."

"He is also the person who has full authority to preside over and coordinate the operation of each family's 'capacity expansion' plan this time. He is also surnamed Chen; maybe you were one family five hundred years ago." Wu Yijun joked to Chen Lin.

"This Chen Xiaobing speaks Guangzhou Mandarin very well; he is probably a local. Maybe he really is family." Chen Ding chimed in.

"Brother, you could ask about his choronym and hall name. Maybe you can connect as clansmen and have someone to look out for you in the future," Wu Yijun joked.

Chen Lin was not as interested as the two elders. He knew this Chen Xiaobing in front of him was not only the "guide" for seeing and learning in Lingao but also the general person in charge of this "Production Capacity Plan." Speaking of which, even a prominent figure in the Guangzhou industrial and commercial circle like Gao Ju had his factory held in the hands of this young man who was about his age. Therefore, the big households were very polite to Chen Xiaobing along the way, and whatever he said, a group of people would agree.

***

In contrast, he was really too humble in the crowd. The accompanying big households were too lazy to pay attention to him.

"Speaking of which, this person is so young, and I heard his background is humble. Yet he could ascend to a high position suddenly. It is unimaginable in the Great Ming. The Senate truly gives many people opportunities!"

"Although he relied on the Australians' power, he is also a talented man." Wu Yijun praised. With the Australians' help, not everyone could sit in this position. Seeing Chen Lin's lack of interest, he didn't forget to comfort him: "Wise Nephew is young and promising, and has family learning sources. You surely will have great achievements in the future."

Chen Xiaobing led the way in front, and the inspection group walked through the internal channel, exiting the wharf directly and entering Ma'ao Railway Station.

Because they took the "internal channel," they didn't witness the bustling scene of the wharf. The two felt somewhat regretful. Chen Xiaobing laughed: " The passenger channel was packed like sardines during disembarkation; you wouldn't get through in half an hour. There are also many rickshaw pullers and small vendors soliciting business, too noisy."

Ma'ao Railway Station was one of the important hubs of the Lingao City Rail system. It was the eastern arrival and departure station of the Lingao City Rail. Due to the existence of Ma'ao Port, the Saltworks, the Iron and Steel Company, and Ma'ao Fortress, the passenger flow here was huge. It was a first-class station in the Lingao City Rail system.

Because the passenger flow was large and it was the "gateway" of the City Rail in eastern Lingao, the design and construction of the station were quite exquisite. It was no longer the "shed" style building of the past, but a German Renaissance style building designed by Qi Feng. The original design was the old Qingdao Railway Station. The red brick exterior walls and roof tiles were replicated exactly. Even the cobblestone-paved station square looked "full of German flavor." Of course, the naturalized citizens didn't know this; they all called it "Australian style."

As "guests of the Senate," the inspection group naturally didn't need to queue in the square to enter the station but entered the VIP waiting room directly through the "VIP Channel," waiting quietly for the arrival of the passenger train.

Chen Lin sat on the sofa chair in the VIP room, looking at the waiting hall outside the glass partition. It was bustling with passengers outside. Looking around, almost all were naturalized citizens with short hair and short clothes, mixed with many people in military uniforms. There were very few people with hair buns and long gowns or short brown hemp clothes.

"Are these... all cadres?" Chen Lin asked in surprise.

Chen Xiaobing was beside him and laughed immediately, saying: "These are all naturalized citizens. Not necessarily cadres. This short hair and short clothes are not a symbol of status. You change if you are willing, and don't if you aren't—it's just that you won't be able to eat the Senate's rice."

"So that's how it is." Chen Lin thought, *At least the Australians don't force head shaving! Much better than the Tartars in Liaodong.*

He looked up at the towering ceiling of the waiting hall and the huge iron-branch gas chandelier hanging from it, then looked at the dome above the distant platform and the huge greenhouse-style glass windows, feeling both novel and somewhat afraid. *Australians' things...* He remembered the "railway" from Great World to Great East Gate in Guangzhou. The platform at Great East Gate Station was just a high platform built of bricks, and even the rain shed above was cobbled together with bamboo poles and reed mats. The station inside Great World was slightly more decent. Compared with here, it was truly the difference between clouds and mud.

*Lingao is worthy of being the capital of the Australians!* Chen Lin thought.

A whistle came from outside, and with a huge vocal announcement, the train pulled into the station. For the inspection group, neither the train nor the rails were rare items. Nor would it cause their surprise. But for those who came to Lingao for the first time, when this steel giant spitting steam and black smoke panted into the station, their curiosity could no longer be contained. They all rushed over with a whoosh. The railway staff and police on the warning line hurriedly waved their sticks to drive the crowd out of the yellow line.

"Our car has arrived," Chen Xiaobing stood up and raised the small flag in his hand, "Please follow me."

The inspection group boarded the "First Class Carriage" of the City Rail. The carriages of the Lingao City Rail had now been upgraded. The open-top third-class cars of the early years had naturally been eliminated, and selling standing tickets had become a thing of the past. This first-class carriage had naturally upgraded its interior and seats.

After boarding was completed, the train gave a whistle and began to start slowly. Chen Lin looked at the slowly receding scenery outside the window, feeling the wonderful sensation of being pulled forward by a huge force. A new journey began in this young man's life.
