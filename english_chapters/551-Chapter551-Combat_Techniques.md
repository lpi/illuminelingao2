# Chapter 551 - Combat Techniques

Krav Maga is a self-defense system that originated in Israel. In the West, it is widely recognized as a highly precise, street-fighting-style personal protection technique designed to counter street attacks, robberies, and sexual harassment. It is an ideal choice for self-defense.

It is a comprehensive and extensive martial arts system encompassing self-defense techniques, counter-striking and kicking techniques, passive escape techniques, throws and takedowns, ground fighting, unarmed defense against knives, sticks, and firearms, and techniques against multiple attackers.

It organically combines the body's instincts with practiced combat techniques, supplemented by a series of training programs including aggression, combat spirit, and situational awareness. Technically, it is distinctly offensive in nature. The sole objective is to eliminate threats to oneself as quickly as possible. It is extremely practical.

One advantage of Krav Maga is that it can be employed in various unfamiliar and disadvantageous environments—such as at night, in narrow streets, while seated or lying down when hand and foot movements are restricted, or in a state of exhaustion. It is particularly suited for law enforcement officers and special agents.

After instructing the trainees on the essentials of the movements, Xue Ziliang had them practice. Once they had gained a moderate degree of proficiency, he began incorporating realistic simulated training. He often chose to hold classes near the end of each day's schedule, when the trainees' stamina was severely depleted and their willpower somewhat scattered.

The attacking side consisted of sergeants and privates on loan from the Army. Not only were they strong and robust, but they had also trained in military combatives for over half a year. They were not only powerful but also highly aggressive.

A group of well-rested soldiers against a troop of physically and mentally exhausted trainees—the outcome was self-evident. The trainee squad was beaten into a crawling mess across the floor; not one of them could last a full minute.

Looking at the groaning trainees scattered on the ground, Xue Ziliang knew he had a long road ahead. Many of them had passable form during sparring sessions with each other, but when facing real combat, let alone performing their techniques, even their reactions were half a beat slow.

"And you lot think you can become agents?" Xue Ziliang bellowed. "Everyone on your feet within one minute!"

Xue Ziliang often had the trainees fight under tremendous physical and mental pressure, using stress to teach them how to apply self-defense techniques.

The female squad received no special treatment during combat training—enemies would not show mercy just because they were women, nor would they arrange fair duels. Women in this line of work first had to be able to protect themselves.

When it was the female trainees' turn, laughter erupted from the ranks of the Army sergeants. Someone immediately said, "Let's just skip this, shall we? This is too unfair."

But Xue Ziliang was unmoved and immediately called out a name: "Corporal Huang Ande! You're up!"

Thus, the first match was Army Infantry Corporal Huang Ande versus Political Security General Administration Trainee Corps Women's Squad Captain Lu Cheng. Huang Ande was not some hulking brute—by modern standards, he had a fairly ordinary physique: only 172cm tall and weighing 70kg. But for Lu Cheng, at 155cm and 40kg, he was a towering giant.

Huang Ande gave an embarrassed, toothy grin, unsure of what to do with his hands and feet. He kept rubbing the stubble on his chin.

"What? Gone stupid at the sight of a woman?" Xue Ziliang scolded. "Begin!"

Huang Ande seemed too embarrassed to strike, his attacks both light and slow. Xue Ziliang barked: "If you don't start fighting seriously, you're cleaning latrines for a year!"

This punishment was terrifying. Ten seconds later, Lu Cheng let out a wretched cry as her body flew through the air and crashed heavily onto the padding, knocked out immediately.

Huang Ande then proceeded to knock down all six girls in the women's squad in under three minutes. Yao Yulan simply forgot everything she had learned and stood there dumbly before being struck down. Yang Cao had learned some martial arts in her opera troupe days and was fairly agile, but her martial arts foundation proved useless. She landed several punches on Huang Ande, but he seemed not to notice, instead raining down fast and fierce blows. Yang Cao blocked and parried desperately, feeling like her arms were about to break. After less than fifteen seconds of stalemate, Huang Ande landed a punch to her abdomen. Yang Cao's face immediately contorted as she collapsed to her knees, unable to rise for a long time.

Huang Ande was startled—he hadn't even used that much force! He was about to lean down to check on her when Yang Cao suddenly swept a leg across, striking him squarely on the shin.

But facts quickly proved that technique alone was useless. Huang Ande's body only swayed slightly—as a combat soldier, his reflexes were quick. He immediately jumped back and escaped Yang Cao's attack range. Having put everything into that desperate strike, Yang Cao was completely spent and truly couldn't get up now. Huang Ande hesitated—should he continue and completely finish off this cunning woman?

"Stop!" Xue Ziliang called a halt.

"Did everyone see that?" Xue Ziliang pointed at Yang Cao, still struggling on the ground. "No matter what martial arts you have, without sufficient stamina, it's all worthless! Those punches and kicks hitting him were no different from dusting him off."

He watched Yang Cao struggle to her feet—she was still clutching her stomach.

"Although you haven't learned Krav Maga yet, that leg sweep you just did had some merit. Good!"

"Continue training!" Xue Ziliang announced loudly. "If you need to cry, do it now—later, you won't even have the strength to cry! I'm going to train you useless lot ruthlessly until you can protect yourselves!"

And so everyone was regularly beaten badly. Bruises all over the body were commonplace. Lu Cheng's arms were red and swollen every day, to the point where she could barely lift them. Massaging each other with medicinal wine became a daily necessity for the trainees. The Medical Department supplied them generously with Runshitang's "San Li Tong Compound Tincture"—a new topical formulation developed by Liu San based on his San Li Tong powder. The trainees served as test subjects for its efficacy.

While everyone was groaning every night, Yao Yulan received the first love letter of her life—from Huang Ande. This letter, secretly slipped into Yao Yulan's hand during training, scrawled crookedly and full of misspellings, earned her utter contempt. She spat once and tossed it into the trash. As a "city person," she naturally looked down on anyone of refugee origin. Moreover, this soldier had beaten her quite badly on the training ground.

During the next day's combat training session, Huang Ande was not assigned to spar with the women's squad. He looked toward Yao Yulan with hopeful eyes, only to receive a disdainful look. Huang Ande's hopes were instantly dashed—he had thought his newly learned flirting technique was foolproof. He channeled his disappointment into limitless energy. That day, every trainee who faced him was directly knocked out, leaving even Xue Ziliang puzzled—when had this Army sergeant become so ferocious?

However, as their physical fitness gradually improved and their grasp of combat techniques deepened, the sparring between trainees and soldiers began to look less like "beatings." After several weeks, soldiers started being knocked down, and gradually more and more of them fell. The soldiers no longer arrived at the training ground with smiles on their faces; they fought with much greater seriousness.

Combat training not only tempered their bodies but also gave the trainees greater confidence to carry out missions independently.

Another weapon that boosted the trainees' confidence was the handgun.

Alongside combat instruction, the trainees began formal small arms shooting training. The weapon they used was the so-called "Six-Star Pepperbox." Of course, this was not an S&W revolver, but rather a Lingao-version revolver manufactured by the Machinery Factory based on designs from the Weapons Design Group.

As administration extended deeper into the grassroots and various administrative organizations continued to expand, the transmigrator collective urgently needed to equip their growing number of native cadres, police, intelligence officers, and security personnel with an effective self-defense weapon.

Currently, native cadres were unarmed. Police had only regulation truncheons and bayonets, with a small number equipped with rifles at best. This fell far short of meeting demands. Although Lingao's public security had significantly improved after the bandit suppression campaign, no one could guarantee that there were no other latent hostile elements: Gou Er and his son remained at large, and the bandit suppression, county yamen takeover, and land surveying had inevitably touched some people's interests. These people, fearful of the transmigrators' instruments of violence, dared not take openly hostile actions, but the possibility of them attacking and retaliating against native collaborators remained very real. Native cadres were the transmigrators' most reliable human resources—once killed, they would not only be difficult to replace quickly but would also shake the confidence of natives serving the collective.

Previously, the Machinery Factory had manufactured some Derringer pistols for transmigrators operating in enemy territory. The feedback had been satisfactory. However, everyone felt this type of pistol had poor sustained firepower, and its large caliber made it overly cumbersome. Since there was ongoing debate about whether such guns were even necessary to manufacture, the Machinery Factory had no interest in putting the Lingao-version Derringer into mass production.

Before the Second General Assembly convened, Wu De had instructed his subordinates to conduct a special investigation on this issue. The conclusion was that arming cadres was necessary—especially grassroots cadres, who were virtually defenseless against hostile elements yet whose work required frequent activity in the field. Under such circumstances, they were easy targets for attack.

After Wu De became head of the Planning Council, he formally implemented this plan. The plan received support from Ma Qianzhu. The General Staff also backed it—both the Army and Navy lacked individual self-defense firearms. Native officers had no handguns; they could use rifles in battle but otherwise went about unarmed except for their command sabers. Moreover, Minié rifles—even short-barreled versions—were unsuitable for all soldiers. Many specialized units in the military, such as artillery, engineers, logistics troops, and Navy sailors, rarely used rifles. Equipping them with rifles was both inconvenient and added to costs.
