# Chapter 1254 - Grape Shot

Zheng Zhipeng galloped to the dock surrounded by personal guards. People from the supply depot had already escorted crates of silver there.

Due to tight time, there was no time to weigh silver; what was sent were all Spanish silver dollars. Crates were open, the shining white dazzling the eyes.

"By General's order, reward twenty taels of silver per person! Another fifty taels for merit!" Zheng Zhipeng said loudly. Sailors instantly commoted. Wealth moves people's hearts. Originally when gathered hearing they were going to fight, there were signs of instability. Now seeing the supply depot deliver shining white silver, and hearing such a huge reward offer, each was incited to uncontrollable itchiness in their hearts.

"Distribute rewards!"

Subordinates immediately distributed handfuls of silver coins into sailors' hands. Twenty shining white silver dollars, heavy in hand. Sailors beamed with joy; such generous rewards were a first.

Greed emboldens people. Morale that had slumped was incited to rise again by this silver. Each shouted: "Lose a head, just a bowl-sized scar!" It seemed the Australian cannon fire that scared them witless just now was nothing special.

There were about sixty fire ships left at Gulangyu and those that fled back. In the current form, there was quite a chance of success. Zheng Zhipeng immediately ordered the whole squadron to move out, raising full sails to charge straight toward Huli Shan.

After the fleet set sail, they immediately spread out a wide frontage, charging toward the seaside below Huli Shan. Sailors, eyes red from silver stimulation, howled one by one, rowing desperately to make the ships run faster.

The fire ship fleet's sortie was immediately discovered by lookouts on *Lichun*. Ming Qiu immediately ordered decks cleared, temporarily stopping cargo unloading.

"Load all main guns with grape shot!"

Elevators rumbled; 130mm grape shot rounds were lifted from the magazine. Grape shot was similar in structure to shrapnel, but projectiles were much larger. Generally only used by the Navy, explicitly to deal with light vessels and destroy enemy warship deck facilities.

Under the combined propulsion of sails and oars, fire ships charged over at an average speed of 7 knots. Soon they approached to within less than 1 cable from the anchor point.

"Commence firing."

*Lichun*'s two 130mm main guns roared again. Long tongues of fire pushed shells out of bores. Shells spun through a distance of over a thousand meters, exploding in the air above the dense fire ship fleet. Gunpowder blasted the dozen-plus projectiles in each shell, size of ping pong balls, shooting toward the fleet.

Grape shot projectiles instantly tore through human bodies, firewood on deck, finally piercing ship planks. Seawater immediately rushed into hulls.

In the first round of shelling, three fire ships began taking on water and sinking. More ships were hit, losing control—some had masts broken, some sailors lost lives.

Out-of-control fire ships drifted sideways; the entire formation fell into disorder instantly. Front ships blocked rear ships. Helmsmen had to heave rudders desperately. Dense ships collided with each other; sailors cursed each other, pushing each other away with bamboo poles.

"All ships fire!"

Closely following *Lichun*'s firing, main guns of the other four warships roared simultaneously. Grape shot flew continuously over the fire ship fleet. Balls of black smoke exploded in the air, pouring projectiles onto the fleet. Scorching projectiles hit dry firewood and sails, igniting flames.

Sailors who had just summoned courage from silver cried for fathers and mothers under this airborne scattering of iron hail. Seeing comrades beside them having heads exploded, arms and legs knocked off, or half bodies torn off alive by projectiles, they lost their souls completely. No longer having the awareness of "lose a head, bowl-sized scar" for silver, only hating there was nowhere to hide on this boat—every projectile pierced straight through the ship bottom.

After three rounds from main guns, Hotchkiss rotary cannons and typewriters on ships followed fire. The distance of over a thousand meters was exactly their effective range to fully unleash firepower. 13mm and 30mm lead bullets flew toward fire ships like rain. Water splashed everywhere. Ships charging in front were instantly riddled like hornet nests, sinking straight down toward the sea bottom.

Although Zheng Zhipeng's ship was behind, he saw clearly the miserable state of grape shot exploding in the air. Seeing Hair Rebels displaying unexpected "sorcery" again, his chest felt pierced by ten thousand arrows. Fighting meant fighting; victory and defeat should be decided after exchanging blows. What was this called now? Seeing front fire ships squeezed in a pile, some on fire, some half sunk, this fire attack war costing tens of thousands of Spanish silver dollars had already fallen into decline. He was anxious and hateful, disregarding if sailors could hear, standing up and shouting:

"Everyone don't be afraid, go up together! Ram them and reward one hundred taels!"

Voice not fallen, another round of grape shot flew over and exploded in the air. A grape shot projectile screaming down pierced right through Zheng Zhipeng's chest, instantly punching a bowl-sized hole, *thump* drilling through the deck behind him. Zheng Zhipeng staggered a step, seeming to disbelieve there was such a big hole in his body, eyes wide, falling onto the deck.

Zheng Zhipeng's death caused no waves—even if he hadn't died in action, the fire attack had failed. Under the combined attack of grape shot and rapid-fire guns, not a single fire ship could enter within 1000 meters of the transfer anchorage. Ships hit and ignited by grape shot burned on the sea surface, drifting slowly, burning and sinking before reaching the anchorage. Extremely few approaching were towed aside by small boats to burn out.

Smoke and fire filled the sea surface. Many fire ships were burning, but not one threatened the Hair Rebel warships, let alone rammed one. Hair Rebel small boats continued transporting men and horses to the beach.

Zheng family generals gathered on the gate tower gazed at the sea surface, each face showing dispirited colors. Some already stepped back a few paces. If not for Zheng Zhilong's personal guards all over the tower, they probably would have fled long ago.

Zheng Zhilong forced himself to be calm: "Fire attack failed, so be it. Hair Rebel ships are sturdy and guns sharp, we brothers can't compare. Wait till they come ashore then fight them with one drum of energy! Everyone reorganize your troops, prepare for battle!"

Generals answered in unison, dispersing. Zheng Zhilong took personal generals and guards down the tower. The city gate was noisy; soldiers were receiving reward silver. Seeing his own soldiers, although ranks were somewhat chaotic, possessing complete armor and bright weapons, much stronger than government troops, he felt slightly comforted. Although land forces weren't the Zheng family core, he hadn't invested little money on them these years. Equipment and pay were all generous. They had won several battles for him—even fighting Yao tribes in Guangdong. Now his only hope was to withstand Hair Rebels in land battle.

It looked like Hair Rebels landing men and horses weren't many, at most five hundred. This reassured him somewhat. He instructed personal guards:

"Call Matos and Tōtarō here."

Matos and Tōtarō were heads of his Black Guard and Japanese Guard. Zheng Zhilong's Black Guard was recruited from the Portuguese, mostly Portuguese runaway slaves. According to records, Macau at the time "had 850 Portuguese with families... they averaged 6 armed slaves. Among them the largest number and most excellent were Kaffirs, and other ethnic people... Portuguese and these people (Japanese) had excellent muskets, spears and other weapons. Few Portuguese didn't have 6 or 12 muskets or flintlocks."

Kaffirs were black slaves from East Africa. Most had military training, accustomed to using Portuguese matchlocks, fought bravely, and had no issues of betrayal. Thus highly trusted by Zheng Zhilong, maintaining a scale of three hundred year-round.

As for the Japanese Guard, his relationship with Hirado domains and being a former Catholic was enough for him to recruit hundreds of Christian-origin Japanese soldiers.

Although Matos and Tōtarō weren't the core layer of the Zheng group, they were Zheng Zhilong's "private soldiers," elite troops truly obeying only him. Most importantly, he didn't need to guard against betrayal from these two.

Matos and Tōtarō came before him. Both wore Portuguese-style clothing. Except Tōtarō wearing dual swords at waist, they were dressed as European soldiers.

These two guards were armed and trained entirely in the style of European armies. With special emphasis on matchlock shooting. Both shooting accuracy and firing speed were top-notch. Zheng Zhilong felt he could still fight, largely relating to having these two teams in hand.

"Hair Rebels are coming to attack here immediately," Zheng Zhilong said. "You two assemble your teams completely, await orders by my side."

"Do we not go out to meet the enemy, General?" Including days under Portuguese, Matos had been in China for several years, able to speak very good Chinese.

"Of course we will meet the enemy. But you are my sharp knife; I want to use you at the critical moment. Are cannons and gunners ready?"

"Ready. I've sent the best gunners to operate cannons on the wall—all Portuguese veterans. But those two big cannons, gunners haven't trained well with them. I fear accidents..." Matos said.

"That Kirishitan taught you how to use them. Just use them. Hair Rebel cannons are very fierce; our existing cannons aren't their match. Have to take the risk."

"Yes, General." Matos expressed no further objection.

Zheng Zhilong had silver brought, instructing to distribute twenty silver coins per person to Guard soldiers. Matos and Tōtarō each received one hundred silver coins. Additionally, Portuguese gunners were heavily rewarded: one hundred silver coins each.

Arrangements complete, he split off two thousand men to hold firmly inside Zhongzuosuo City relying on wall cannons. Remaining main force and guards went out of the city to line up and meet the enemy in the deeper region northwest of the city.
