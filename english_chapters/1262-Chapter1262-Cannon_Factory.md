# Chapter 1262 - Cannon Factory

Xu Ke carefully examined the ship's structure and took some photos. The clues at the shipyard piqued his interest greatly. Beyond collecting intelligence on hostile forces, the Intelligence Bureau was also tasked with discovering, understanding, and assessing potential threats: including emerging hostile forces and any technological, cultural, or scientific progress made by non-Senate powers.

The inspection of the shipyard proved that the indigenous people of this timeline had realized the technological gap and were improving their own technology within their capabilities.

Xu Ke felt concerned about this phenomenon. No matter how small and feeble such attempts were, the enterprising spirit they contained was unquestionable. The existence of the Senate greatly stimulated the desire for technological progress among the indigenous people of this timeline and indirectly broadened their horizons.

While the Senate, as spacetime colonists, crushed the indigenous people with technological, institutional, and cultural superiority, it was also constantly disseminating new technologies and concepts.

Xu Ke had mixed feelings. The accompanying naturalized staff member, seeing his solemn expression—unlike other Chiefs who were beaming with joy—inexplicably became more cautious.

"Let's go look at the cannon factory."

The cannon factory was not far from the shipyard, less than two li away. Xu Ke didn't ride a horse but walked directly there. Several members of the Planning Agency's Special Search Team and Marines were already waiting for him at the entrance.

The cannon factory was very crude, consisting only of a large area of rammed earth with a few brick-and-tile buildings. Several reservoirs had been built for the casting needs. Xu Ke noticed that several iron-smelting furnaces had already been built here, and a large amount of charcoal and iron material had been stockpiled.

The equipment in the cannon factory was advanced by Ming dynasty standards. Even with Xu Ke's half-baked 17th-century firearms knowledge gained from crash courses, he could see it almost reached the level of contemporary Europe. It not only possessed various measuring tools and calipers but also animal or human-powered long-bar boring machines for polishing the cannon bores.

However, there were no signs of production in the cannon factory; the smelting furnaces hadn't been fired yet.

According to several surrendered captives, this cannon factory had been built less than a month ago. Although all equipment and tools were ready and materials were sufficient, Zheng Zhilong had strictly withheld the order to start production, the reason being they were waiting for "Foreign Cannons."

"Foreign cannons?" Xu Ke thought to himself that he had seen plenty of genuine foreign cannons along the way. At Huli Mountain alone, he had seen several Portuguese Red Barbarian Cannons, and there were also Senate "Vagabond Cannons" on the garrison walls. The Zheng group certainly wasn't destitute enough to lack a cannon model—even the hired cannon founders found it strange: tons of silver spent and materials ready, yet no casting.

He continued inspecting the cannon factory and discovered a strange building. It was shaped like a square watchtower, with a base of blue stone and upper parts of blue brick, all bonded with glutinous rice lime mortar. It was about ten meters high. The inside was empty. The entire tower was divided into three levels; the top was not roofed but had a wooden frame made of thick timber, covered with reed mats to keep out wind and rain.

Clearly, this building was unfinished, but Xu Ke couldn't immediately figure out its purpose. From its sturdy construction, it seemed to be a blockhouse.

He walked around the building and found a large pile of timber covered with reed mats nearby. The timber had been processed into round logs of various lengths, with mortise and tenon joints already cut. One of them was about ten meters long.

Besides this timber, there were some thinner wooden sticks of various lengths and a large quantity of bamboo strips that had been split.

Xu Ke couldn't guess what they were up to for the moment, so he recorded it with his camera and had the Planning Agency staff chronicle and register these materials in detail.

There was also an attached gunpowder workshop here. The warehouse stored large amounts of saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal. However, the special bluestone grinders used for grinding gunpowder were missing. Xu Ke found this strange; these were essential items for making gunpowder. The stone quality had strict requirements; you couldn't just make do with any random stone.

Asking a captive, he was told that the stone grinders were custom-ordered, and due to their large size and weight, they hadn't been transported here yet.

Xu Ke didn't think much of it. He walked through the entire artillery ground and found that not only was there equipment for casting cannons, but there was clearly also an intention to manufacture muskets. Moreover, there were crucibles.

Although Xu Ke had never worked in a factory, he had at least read plenty of popular science articles on industrial technology. He knew the only possibility for crucibles appearing here was that someone in this Zheng family arsenal was attempting to make steel.

While large-scale steelmaking remained Lingao's patent, small-scale manufacturing of what was considered "high-quality" steel by the standards of the time existed in many places in this timeline.

The problem was, what did the Zheng group need crucible steel for? Even as a non-weapons expert, Xu Ke knew it was impossible to use this little bit of steel to cast cannons—not to mention he had heard industrial Elders say that casting steel was extremely difficult. Even in the 21st century, it wasn't something a small workshop could do.

It seemed there were quite a few unsolved mysteries here. Xu Ke increasingly felt that this cannon factory hid many unknown secrets.

"Chief..." The Planning Agency Special Search Team staff had been waiting for him to finish his inspection before starting their inventory. Seeing him return to the factory gate, they hurried up to ask for instructions.

"Everything here must be carefully recorded, drawn, and photographed before being moved—including their specific locations in the factory. My people will handle the specific work. You are to start each item only after they finish, understand?"

"Understood, Chief."

"Give them a copy of the catalog and figures you tally up—I have a use for them." With that, Xu Ke hurriedly returned to the dock to take a small launch back to Xiamen Island, where more work awaited him.

With a crunch, a miraculously preserved Xuande red vase was crushed into powder by Xue Ziliang's combat boot.

Xue Ziliang stood in a courtyard of the Zheng estate, leisurely lighting a "Limited Edition First Clear" Corona cigar for himself. He had a FAL short-barreled assault rifle slung over his shoulder, sleeves rolled up to reveal thick biceps, wearing a boonie hat. The sunlight reflecting off his fake Ray-Ban sunglasses made him look exactly like the "textbook American GI" from old movies.

Only four hours had passed since he fired the shells, but Anping had already changed hands—a speed exceeding the estimates of Xue Ziliang and all the staff officers in Lingao.

The bombardment caused immense chaos in Anping. The result was that long after the shelling stopped, a team of a hundred men was finally sent from the city to search towards the artillery position. After encountering continuous precision rifle fire and leaving behind a dozen corpses, they retreated. Subsequently, the Navy's special service boat squadron arrived at Anping and wiped out all Zheng army ships anchored in the river in a battle with little suspense.

Before the Marines even began their landing assault, the city had fallen into chaos internally, with fires breaking out everywhere. Special Reconnaissance Team (SRT) squads lying in ambush reported that all city gates were open and people were fleeing everywhere. The flight was so massive and surging that the sniper teams couldn't intercept them at all. they just opened fire on those who were well-dressed or riding horses and sedan chairs. They killed quite a few, but even more escaped.

Now, on the roads leading out from Anping's gates, abandoned chests, damaged sedan chairs, dead horses, and corpses lay strewn everywhere, with all sorts of valuables scattered on the ground.

The Marine Corps quickly controlled Anping's four gates and began extinguishing fires and restoring order. Xue Ziliang led the SRT into Anping—his primary objective was to control Zheng Zhilong's residence.

He took a puff of his cigar to dispel the pungent smell of blood. The courtyard had been thoroughly turned over by artillery shells; rubble and shrapnel were everywhere. Bloody corpses filled the courtyard and corridors; a few dying ones were still groaning in pain. A dozen men and women servants fleeing in panic appeared to have been hit by shrapnel while crowding the gate to escape; their bodies, torn apart by pellets, blocked the doorway in varying postures.

This was the main thoroughfare in the residence leading to the Dunren Pavilion, where Zheng Zhilong conducted business. Xue Ziliang ordered the four team members behind him to quickly clear the rooms in the courtyard. He knew there was no need to say much; these veterans knew how to act. Panting slightly, they looked around vigilantly, ready to move immediately.

Xue Ziliang himself carefully crossed the passageway—although the residence was a mess, this was, after all, Zheng Zhilong's mansion. If they were to encounter resistance in Anping City, it would be here.

Just as he stepped into the courtyard, a man clutching a Japanese sword suddenly rushed out from the left, screaming and lunging at him. Perhaps it was a terrified family guard trying to fight his way out, but Xue Ziliang had no room for thought. He dodged sideways, and the automatic rifle in his hands fired a three-round burst. The guy stumbled and fell, spewing filthy blood from his mouth.

Xue Ziliang kicked the corpse aside and walked forward carefully. Organized resistance ultimately didn't exist, but people struggling in death throes could appear at any moment. He led two members, covering each other, into the courtyard of the Dunren Pavilion.

There were even more corpses here. Many stewards, bosses, and attendants had gathered here for a meeting. The bombardment had claimed many of their lives; blood and flesh were everywhere.

Subconsciously sensing light footsteps inside the main house, he immediately raised his gun, maintained a posture ready to fire at any moment, slowly approached the main house, and kicked the door open.

There was no one in the main room, but he knew someone was hiding behind the curtains.

"Come out, we won't kill you!" a naturalized soldier of Southern Fujian origin accompanying him shouted.
