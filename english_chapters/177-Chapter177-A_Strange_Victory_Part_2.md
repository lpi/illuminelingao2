# Chapter 177: A Strange Victory (Part 2)

**Battle Statistics:**

**Results:** 102 killed in action, 70 died of wounds, 213 prisoners (35 lightly wounded). Captured 400+ melee weapons, 7 three-barreled muskets, 7 warhorses. Tonight's dinner: the 8th horse—it had an injured leg.

**Our casualties:** 11 lightly wounded, 10 from twisted ankles or falls during pursuit—running through freshly harvested paddies was indeed dangerous. 1 crushed foot from dropping an artillery shell.

By afternoon, prisoner processing was mostly complete. Per Ma Qianzhu's instructions, prisoners received food. The cafeteria's unchanging prisoner fare: congee. The prisoners were clearly still terrified, fearfully eyeing the transmigrators' food. Finally, someone brave and hungry enough started gulping porridge. With a leader, the rest mobbed the rice bucket, pushing and shoving until guards' shouting prevented actual fights. Now they could observe legendary Ming-era pirates up close: a chaotic cluster of peasants squatting together. Not even decent clothes. Bare-chested or wearing thin jackets. Filthy, stinking, ragged garments that might disintegrate any moment. Through clothing gaps, bamboo-jointed ribs and bloated bellies were visible. Xiong Buyu with translators and Security personnel was working on them intensely.

About ten men looked more alert, eating without scrambling, faces expressionless, appearing dull and depressed. But occasional furtive glances revealed hidden scheming.

"These should be the core members," Ran Yao observed. "Start with them."

Preliminary interrogations confirmed the pirates were Zhu Cailao's men. Fifty were veteran pirates; the rest had been recruited within the past half-month. No combat experience—pure cannon fodder.

Most absurd: several dozen were actually Lingao rear-garrison military households. The Liu *qianhu* from the rear garrison often rented out his weapons, vessels, and military households to pirates for extra income. Liu *qianhu* colluding with pirates wasn't unusual; coastal garrisons had various relationships with maritime powers.

But among the prisoners, there wasn't a single leader-level figure. Last time they'd at least captured ship-captain-level Shi Shisi. This time, not one decent leader. They'd landed at dawn from five large ships at Shipai, then advanced under a "steward's" command. That steward was either dead or escaped—not among prisoners, nor identifiable among cannon-pulverized corpses.

Most prisoners only knew they'd come to attack some "bald bandits." Recruiters said these "bald bandits" had stolen much treasure from Boss Zhu. Bairren Beach was all wealth. Boss Zhu was attacking for revenge, and all loot would belong to them.

Among captures, many weapons bore Zhu Cailao's marks and insignia. Some corpses carried Zhu Cailao's documents and command flags. Looking at the testimonies and evidence, Ran Yao frowned.

As dusk fell, transmigrator camps echoed with laughter and chatter. Zhu Cailao was nothing special after all. Zhang Bailin grinned ear to ear. Today's battle: 80 artillery rounds routed 400+ pirates. Great glory for artillery.

The cafeteria butchered the killed horses—providing the Training Battalion with horse meat and offal feast. Though horse meat, the cafeteria had fish sauce, spices, and abundant salt. Compared to typical plain boiled dead-horse meat, this was heaven and earth. Wu Nanhai also rendered some horse fat. It smelled foul but fried food fragrant. Beijing's famous *jianbing guanzi* used horse fat. Without *guanzi*, Wu Nanhai fried dried pumpkin slices, pouring on chopped garlic. The soldiers enthusiastically welcomed it. Compared to each person's small portion of meat and offal, this unlimited, fatty food better satisfied everyone's needs.

Huang Xiong received his small bowl of horse meat and offal. He poked with chopsticks—a few meat slices, some intestine and lung pieces—smelling intensely fragrant from spices mixed with meat. Though tough, the meat was deliciously savory. As a former Ming officer, he'd eaten dead mule and horse meat, but never this well prepared. Looking around, the entire company was eating and drinking, making satisfied sounds. Two victories, yet these Chiefs were stingy—just one horse meat meal! Huang Xiong had expected some silver reward. But reconsidering these two battles, he'd just stood in formation holding a rifle. Everything was won by artillery.

Looking around, Company Commander Old Tiger You and the platoon commanders were also eating horse meat and fried pumpkin, bowls filled with brown rice. On this point, Huang Xiong admired these Chiefs' officer-soldier equality: besides extra equipment, officers had no special treatment. Same food and clothing. Housing was just a single room in barracks. Except for weekly "weekends" at Bairren Fortress, they had no luxuries—not even someone to make their beds.

While eating, he heard soldiers discussing the two battles:

"...If all fighting's like this, soldiering's easy..."

"Chiefs' cannons are so powerful, who can stop us?"

"You think the Chiefs are planning... you know?"

"Stop pretending you don't know. Rebellion? I think maybe."

"Rebellion means entire family execution—"

"Execute what? Those regular army weaklings? Nothing to fear in rebellion." This one started dreaming. "If rebellion succeeds, we'll all be founding fathers. Each get thousands of *mu* of land."

"I want a wife. Over twenty and never even touched a woman's hand."

"One wife? I want a dozen, just like city magnates!"

"You're skin and bones. Won't a dozen wives grind you to dust?"

...

Huang Xiong's heart stirred. He'd come seeking refuge as a criminal. Looking now, these "bald bandits" had grand ambitions. Even if not rebellion, at least regional warlord aspirations. While pondering, a soldier asked:

"Squad Leader Huang, you think the Chiefs have such intentions?"

Huang Xiong put down his bowl: "How would I know? But these two opponents were trash. Against regular troops, it wouldn't be this easy."

"But our cannons—"

"Regulars have them too. Red-Barbarian cannons." Huang Xiong had seen his garrison's artillery drills. These cannons operated similarly to Red-Barbarian cannons but seemed lighter and more transportable.

"Besides, Liao garrison has Red-Barbarian cannons. So what? Still got smashed by the Jurchens. Can your cannons fire continuously? Jurchens rely on fast horses and sharp arrows. One shot kills maybe a dozen; meanwhile, several hundred cavalry charge dozens of paces closer. A few shots and cavalry are in the formation. Then it's infantry melee."

This frightened the soldiers, dampening the festive mood. Huang Xiong suddenly became alert. What was he doing? In garrison army, this would be "undermining morale"—dragged out and beheaded immediately. Why was he saying this?

He quickly changed the subject: "This is Qiongzhou. Jurchen are ten thousand *li* away. Why panic? Brothers won't be fighting in Liaodong."

He quickly glanced around for outsiders, then rambled about miscellaneous anecdotes to divert the soldiers' attention.

The setting sun slowly descended over Bopu's Lingao Point. The newly restored Lingao beacon tower stood tall. The newly completed gun emplacement housed a 12-pounder cannon pointing seaward. The tower had a searchlight. Li Di, wearing radio and night vision equipment, stood watch with two Navy sentries. Looking toward Bairren Fortress, the day's bustle was quieting. Outside the fortress, on-duty personnel lit bonfires. Inside, many departments still showed scattered lights—still working. Here at Bopu, the charcoal kilns glowed fiercely. A fishy stench drifted on the wind from the seafood processing plant. At the river mouth, *Fengcheng* showed faint lights, almost blending with the starry sky.

Every few minutes, he'd survey the surroundings with night vision binoculars. Bopu wasn't like early days when a ring camp sufficed. Work sites had expanded considerably. Though key points had ring defenses, blanket illumination like before was impossible. Besides lighting at key intersections, they relied more on night vision equipment and hidden sentries. They still couldn't fully trust native soldiers, so night watch duties were always transmigrators or transmigrator-led.

Through binoculars, he spotted several figures slowly approaching the beach camp. Their outlines suggested friendlies, but protocol required notifying hidden sentries.

"Tan Ming, Tan Ming. Someone approaching your position."

"Understood." Tan Ming, on duty at the river mouth, was from the Construction Team. His excellent physique and hardworking nature had gotten him drafted into core militia. Daytime work plus night duty. The perks: extra access to currently-scarce items—cigarettes, canned goods, cola. Core militia also regularly watched movies: first military educational films, second various commercial films, third was late-night—not for good children.

"Password!"

"Refrigerator! Response?"

"Haier! Which department?" Tan Ming gripped his SKS rifle.

"I'm Wu De from Bairren Commune!" The dark-faced approaching man had several uniformed men behind him.

So it was Wu De—a big official! Tan Ming snapped to attention, his speech becoming unclear:

"Director Wu—no, Commune Chief—"

"Just call me A-De. You're not a native." Wu De had never seen a transmigrator so respectful toward him.

"I'm Tan Ming from Construction Team—" Tan Ming felt a bit embarrassed. Years at society's bottom made one this way. He felt a little sad.

Wu De vaguely remembered this person from early construction days when he'd dealt frequently with the Construction Team.

"You're 'Fat Ming,' right?" He matched the nickname with the face from deep memory. Actually, the nickname was now inaccurate. Long-term labor and high-protein, low-fat intake had made him quite fit, not "fat" at all.

"Right, right! I'm 'Fat Ming'! You remember me!"

"We used to meet at the worksite all the time." Wu De saw he wanted to reminisce, but this was a hidden sentry position—chatting here wasn't appropriate. Plus, he had business. He continued: "I need to board *Fengcheng*. Where do I embark?"

"Go to the Navy Harbor Office below Lingao Point Fort. They manage everything here."

Wu De shook his head. Navy's aggressive ambitions weren't a good sign. Though Navy-born himself, long Executive Committee work gave him broader perspective. He disapproved of the current Army-Navy tensions. This trip, he also wanted to speak with He Ming, Ming Qiu, and other veterans.
