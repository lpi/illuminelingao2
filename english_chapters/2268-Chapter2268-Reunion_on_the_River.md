# Chapter 2268: Reunion on the River

The boatman with a dull face under the bamboo hat, who else could it be but Jiang Suo!

Yi Haoran was greatly shocked; he completely hadn't expected to meet Jiang Suo here.

He hadn't seen Jiang Suo since a few days before Wuzhou fell. He originally thought that if he hadn't deserted like other average soldiers, he must have died in battle. He hadn't expected Jiang Suo to actually be in Wuzhou.

Looking at his appearance, he didn't know if he was truly making a living as a boatman or disguised and changed in appearance, specially waiting here for him.

Either way, Yi Haoran had already made up his mind to fight the Australians to the end. Jiang Suo was a renegade Australian; he definitely wouldn't go with the Australians again. Meeting him and talking wouldn't hurt.

He steadied his mind and said, "In that case, I'll take your boat."

Jiang Suo led him to the side of the pier, where many small boats were moored, all doing ferrying business. Jiang Suo untied the rope, held the boat, and invited Yi Haoran to board, then jumped onto the small boat himself, rowing the oar to leave the shore.

At first, neither of the two spoke. It wasn't until the small boat was near the middle of the river that Jiang Suo slowed down his rowing and whispered, "Advisor Yi, I trust you have been well since we parted!"

"Just scraping by with my life." Yi Haoran sighed long, "Brother Jiang, what about you?"

"Reborn into a second life; picked up a life back!" Jiang Suo said.

It turned out that when Xiong Wencan fled, he originally took him along. However, not long after slipping out of the encirclement, they were discovered by the Australians. Jiang Suo led the family guards to bring up the rear. After a chaotic battle in the dark night, although the main group was protected to escape, the house guards around him were almost all dead or injured. Jiang Suo also fell off a cliff during the escape and fainted.

Although this fall made him unconscious and even broke his head, he escaped the Fubo Army's search. He hid in the mountains for a day, seeing the Fubo Army had withdrawn, before fleeing on foot toward Teng County.

On the escape route, he was caught by bandits ambushing halfway specifically to intercept stragglers—needless to say, it was exactly Gou Er (Little Rascal) Hu Lanyan’s gang.

Originally, when routed soldiers like Jiang Suo were intercepted, bandits mostly snatched away their armor, weapons, and carry-on soft valuables, then stabbed them one by one and abandoned the corpses by the road. But this time, Gou Er discovered he was carrying an Australian musket and thought he was a "Hair thief spy," instantly feeling he was a rare commodity worth hoarding, so he spared his life.

Only upon this interrogation did he know he was Xiong Wencan’s personal general, commanding the "New Army"—Gou Xunli knew of this team. On the spot, he piled smiles on his face, personally untied the ropes saying "offended," and invited him to join the gang to resist the Hair thieves together.

Thus Jiang Suo stayed in Gou Er’s bandit gang. He naturally didn't know this middle-aged man calling himself Xunli was the "heinous reactionary Gou Er" he had heard familiar mentions of when in the Fubo Army.

However, knowing or not knowing didn't mean much to Jiang Suo anymore. He didn't care about living; as long as he could kill a true Australian, it would be fine. Therefore, he agreed to Gou Xunli without hesitation and joined the bandit gang.

"...How did you know I was here?" Yi Haoran asked.

"To be honest, I have been here for a few days." Jiang Suo said, "Big Brother Xun knows you and I have old ties, so he specially asked me to come connect with you to discuss the great plan together."

Hearing "discuss the great plan together," Yi Haoran couldn't help sighing long:

"Alas! Having the heart to kill thieves, but powerless to reverse the heavens! These days I have been patrolling inside and outside Wuzhou city, seeing if the Hair thieves have flaws—unexpectedly they defend so tightly, not leaking a drop of water! Today I originally wanted to find a like-minded person, but he is nowhere to be found..."

Jiang Suo didn't reply immediately, but said, "Advisor Yi, didn't you, Old Sir, teach me in the past? Knowing it cannot be done but doing it anyway is the true color of a hero. It is true we lost the battle, but we are still alive. As long as we are alive, there is always a chance."

Yi Haoran was moved by his stubborn heart. He nodded and said, "You said it well! We will do this 'knowing it cannot be done but doing it anyway'!"

On the spot, he told Jiang Suo about his search for Chang Qingyun.

"I know the person you speak of." Jiang Suo nodded and said, roughly describing Chang Qingyun’s appearance and habitual gestures.

"Correct, exactly him! You have seen him?"

"I have been making a living by ferrying here these days; I have seen everyone working in this area of Dayun Gate—speaking of which, there are really quite a few acquaintances..." Jiang Suo smiled, "Fortunately, most of them don't recognize me."

The ferry boat was picked up by him in a deserted river bay; the boatman had either died or run away. Although he was from Henan, he had drifted in the Jianghu for many years and knew water nature, knowing how to handle boats and oars. So he used ferrying outside Dayun Gate as cover, looking for opportunities to contact Yi Haoran.

Yi Haoran hadn't been waited for these days, but he saw quite a few familiar faces.

He was low-key, and the time he stayed in Wuzhou was not long; very few civil and military officials in Wuzhou city knew him. But he usually led troops on patrol and sentry duty; the people he had seen were really not few.

"They have all surrendered to the Hair thieves now, considered to have crossed onto the open road. It's not urgent that we recognize them; it's bad if they recognize us."

"There are also quite a few who haven't crossed onto the open road." Jiang Suo said, "Scattered everywhere in the city."

Yi Haoran got spirited, ignoring asking about Chang Qingyun, and asked: "Do you know who they are? When free, go inquire secretly."

"Advisor Yi, don't be anxious. I don't know many characters; I fear you won't recognize them if I write them down. In a while, I will tell you one by one. Speaking of Advisor Chang you asked about, he is now serving as a paperwork advisor in the Sanheui Parade Ground..."

"Is this true?!"

"I asked him personally yesterday." Jiang Suo smiled, "Originally when he came over from Sanheui, he was escorted by soldiers with the labor corps. When work ended, he was also escorted back in formation. A few days ago, I saw him crossing the river alone, so I asked a few questions. Only then did I know he is now a paperwork clerk in the captive camp. Although still of semi-captive status, no one escorts him anymore. He is free to go out daily, as long as he returns to the campsite for roll call on time in the evening."

"In that case, why doesn't he run?" Yi Haoran was a bit strange.

"He has neither travel expenses nor a place to go; where run to?" Jiang Suo said, "Besides, he has no Australian road pass in hand. He can neither take a boat nor walk on the official road, only remote small paths. Now there are bandits and Yao disturbances everywhere. Going on the road alone like this, isn't it seeking death?"

Yi Haoran thought about it and agreed.

Chang Qingyun serving as a paperwork clerk in the captive camp and being able to move freely was good news for him. Since Chang Qingyun could move freely, many things would be much easier to do. He might not need to risk infiltrating the camp himself. He said immediately: "If I can have his assistance, the great matter can be accomplished!"

"Advisor Yi, words are said like this. But don't know if Master Chang is willing to join?" Jiang Suo looked worried, "When he took the boat, I probed his tone; he seems not to hate the Australians. And this person is greedy for life and afraid of death..."

"The matter of persuading Chang Qingyun, leave it to me to handle." Yi Haoran seemed quite confident, "There is always sixty or seventy percent certainty. Only since he works in the parade ground, how to get in to see him?"

For this matter, Jiang Suo couldn't think of a way either, only saying "act according to circumstances."

"He has to go out to handle affairs every three or five days in the camp. When the time comes, I'll find an excuse to make an appointment with him."

"Good." Yi Haoran nodded, "Only you absolutely must not say I appointed him—although he didn't expose me last time, he may not be willing to get involved in this. If you say it, and he gets suspicious, it will ruin the matter."

Jiang Suo nodded. He rowed the boat to an unmanned place by the shore and told Yi Haoran the names of officials and generals he saw who had not been imprisoned in the captive camp as laborers one by one. There were a total of a dozen people. Some Jiang Suo didn't know by name, but roughly knew their former positions or surnames. Combined with specific characteristics, Yi Haoran could roughly know who they were.

"In addition, there are some people who just look familiar, but specific situations are unknown." Jiang Suo said, "Some of them dress as ordinary commoners, and some wear armbands issued by Hair thieves—probably working for them. By the way, a few days ago, I also saw Song Ming’s personal soldier Zhang Yong. Don't know what living he does."

"General Song is still alive?!" Yi Haoran was shocked. He had met routed soldiers fleeing back from Bang Mountain who said Song Ming drowned when the Hair thieves shelled the floating bridge while crossing.

"He drowned after crossing the river, later rescued by personal soldiers. Life or death unknown." Jiang Suo absolutely didn't mention he was the one who fished Song Ming up from the river.

"General Song is a good man. If still alive, he is also a big help!" Yi Haoran was somewhat excited. Song Ming was different from himself and Jiang Suo; he was a man who had led troops—that is to say, as long as he didn't die and wasn't caught by Hair thieves, he would have at least seven or eight personal family guards around him, all combat-capable elites.

Originally Yi Haoran was full of ambiguity, wanting to do something earth-shattering in Wuzhou, but going out it was pitch black, not knowing where to start. Until he met Jiang Suo today. This half-disciple half-subordinate not only lived but also provided much news he didn't know: inside and outside Wuzhou city, many of their kind were still hiding. This gave him sudden confidence—regardless of Governor Xiong's ending, he, Yi Haoran, would have a vigorous go at it in Wuzhou!

At dusk, Yi Haoran returned to Luo Yangming’s "Yuxin" Rice Shop. The front of the rice shop was deserted; even the shop boards weren't completely taken down. Ah Chun was dozing in the counter. Besides him, there was not a single person on the frontage. Because the war in the Two Guangs had not subsided, grain sources from Guangxi were basically cut off. "Yuxin" and other grain and rice shops that similarly transshipped grain from upstream to Guangdong had no business to do. The only business was to distribute grain shipped from Sanshui to the Senate's occupied areas, maintaining normal grain supply.

This kind of business operated according to the Planning Court's grain quota, just using the distribution channels of various households. Monthly business volume and profit were roughly fixed, requiring little thought. So Luo Yangming was not in the rice shop for most of the time, but handling affairs at the Rehabilitation Bureau.

The noise of him entering woke Ah Chun, who hurriedly welcomed him: "Sir! You are back." Saying this, he took the bundle and umbrella from his shoulder.
