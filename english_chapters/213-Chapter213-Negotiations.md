# Chapter 213 - Negotiations

He Ying could see how astonished this Frenchman was, and thought to himself: I also know that La Rochelle fortress will be captured this year. I just don't know whether the exploits of Monsieur d'Artagnan and his friends fighting Protestants in the bastion will still take place.

Assigned to attend to this Frenchman because he knew French, He Ying was confident about his rise in the transmigrator hierarchy. He hadn't expected the French he'd learned to impress girls while in school would prove so useful—this was probably diplomacy? Or maybe work for the United Front Department? He'd originally been an advertising planner, but in the transmigrator collective he hadn't landed any suitable position. He'd been assigned to the Propaganda Division under the Propaganda Department, writing leaflets and painting slogans. Life was certainly fulfilling, just lacking excitement. Occasionally repairing someone's television or radio counted as a small diversion. Because his marksmanship was decent, despite his best efforts to avoid becoming a militia member, after this organizational restructuring he'd been placed in the "Training Corps," taking turns standing guard at night every week. Now with this new position, presumably he wouldn't have to do that duty anymore.

"Will the heresy in France be completely eradicated?" Lu Ruohua was very interested in this topic.

"The surrender of La Rochelle fortress is imminent, but religious disputes won't end—"

Lu Ruohua studied this "Australian"—no mistake about it, they looked every bit like genuine Chinese. Lu Ruohua knew the Chinese they spoke was different from other Ming Chinese—not Cantonese, not Hokkien, not Mandarin, but another Chinese language. Who exactly were these people? Their origins interested him even more than missionary matters.

"So you believe the heretics will stir up more trouble in France?"

"That's right. France's religious disputes are only beginning," He Ying said modestly.

"God protect them and save those lambs who have strayed." Lu Ruohua quietly recited a passage of scripture.

Over the past week, he had constantly tried to spread the Gospel of Christ to this He Ying before him. But he knew this young man who spoke French with a strange accent, though maintaining a polite smile, didn't care about what he was saying. This made him somewhat dejected—this person was fluent in French and learned in many areas. If he could be baptized, he would make an excellent assistant in missionary work.

He Ying was feeling a bit bored. As an atheist, the constant religious bombardment he faced was rather overwhelming. But he had to complete the organization's mission—chat with Lu Ruohua and gather as much intelligence and information as possible. Especially to grasp this person's personality so it could be exploited in negotiations.

After days of conversation, He Ying had ferreted out everything about his family—how many people, how much land, how many cattle in the fields. But he still couldn't figure out the man's personality. The missionary always maintained a mild, peaceful smile. Today he'd brought up France's religious wars hoping to provoke him into anger and reveal his character. But there seemed to be nothing gained.

"Fine, you wretch. A real old fox!" He Ying knew he couldn't get any further. Fortunately, Director Wen's backup plan was ready.

"Where there are people, there will be disputes. Father, let us go. Chairman Wen wants to see you today." To reflect the nature of the transmigrator regime, he referred to Wen Desi as "Chairman" rather than "Manager."

"Very well. Please allow me to change my clothes," Lu Ruohua said solemnly.

Lu Ruohua wasn't wearing a black cassock, but a long robe made in imitation of Ming dynasty clothing. It looked quite peculiar on such a bearded foreigner, and he'd topped it with a square-topped scholar's cap. Jesuit missionaries had long understood the principle of "when in Rome, do as the Romans do." Not only did they learn Chinese, but they also learned local dialects, and dressed as much like the locals as possible.

The vehicle that came to receive them was a new-model four-wheeled carriage. This was the first large modern product from the Machinery Department, taking nearly twenty days of collective effort to manufacture. Its core component, the shock-absorbing spring, was made from 0.6% carbon steel processed with heat treatment technology, wound around a steel pillar. The heat treatment step alone took nearly ten days. The performance of these springs was mediocre—insufficient for critical artillery components. But they served adequately enough as carriage shock absorbers.

However, making wheels was difficult. In ancient times, both Chinese and Western wheelwrights had specialized crafts. The transmigrators couldn't master wheel manufacturing for the time being, so they simply used wheels from the wheeled carts in inventory. The ball bearings in the axles were self-made—through building this carriage, the Machinery Department had conducted trial production of standardized hardware, bearings, and chains—the most basic industrial components.

The carriage body was made from local timber. The seats were genuine leather over spring sofas stuffed with dried seaweed. The windows were glazed, and the emblem on the carriage front was a red flag waving in the wind.

This "Red Flag" model carriage was manufactured to reduce automobile use. More and more important people were visiting the transmigrators these days. While ferrying them in jeeps could shock them tremendously, the fuel consumption and wear on parts were all too real.

Lu Ruohua was helped into the carriage. The carriage itself was nothing remarkable, but when he sat down, it was exceptionally comfortable—not the simple softness of thick wool padding, but a feeling of soft yet firm, yielding yet resisting.

The interior decoration was plain, just a coat of Chinese lacquer, but the cabin was spacious and the ride smooth. It didn't bounce on the road.

Looking out the window, he saw the carriage traveling on a flat, straight road paved with some kind of consolidated black material mixed with gravel. The surface looked solid, without ruts or tracks. The center was slightly raised, with drainage ditches on either side. The design was clearly well-considered and the construction excellent. He was inwardly impressed—such fine roads he hadn't seen in all his travels across half the world.

The thoroughness of the roadside facilities was also beyond anything he'd heard of. Every quarter of a league or so stood a stone milestone. Every intersection had stone signposts. Along the route were small forts protected by trenches, low walls, and barricades made with iron wire. The forts were equipped with cannons, manned by fully armed soldiers on watch. Clearly, travelers on this road need not fear bandit attacks. In the open areas outside the forts, small open-air markets had spontaneously formed. Each market had an identical covered pavilion containing a well and stone troughs for watering livestock. The carriage would always rest briefly at these markets to water the horses. Inside each pavilion, a large wooden barrel stored boiled water that had cooled, apparently mixed with some kind of herb. Lu Ruohua found it rather bitter to drink, but cooling and thirst-quenching.

Along the roadside, newly planted trees had been set—presumably to shade the road in the future. But great wooden poles also stood along the route, firmly buried in the ground. Some were even stayed with ropes, suggesting these poles were quite important. Yet on closer inspection, there was nothing on the poles—they were empty. Perhaps they were objects of Australian worship? Like the natives on Southeast Asian islands who worshipped wooden poles? But these poles had no decoration whatsoever—each was simply a pole coated in black wood tar.

"Are all these arrangements yours?" Father Lu asked once they were underway again.

"Yes."

"Lord, this is the finest road system I've ever seen. Does it cover all of Linggao?"

"No, not quite," He Ying knew the transmigrators' formidable engineering capabilities and human-centered design left a profound impression on everyone who traveled this road. "As you know, such roads are very expensive."

"Indeed," Lu Ruohua nodded. "Not just the roads, but all those facilities—so thoroughly considered."

"We call this 'people-centered.'"

"People-centered." Lu Ruohua pondered. "Centered on people's needs?"

"Public roads serve the general public, so naturally they should be centered on the public's needs."

"I notice travelers on this road don't pay any tolls. Roads require constant maintenance—how do you sustain them? Simply from your commercial profits? Is this considered Australian charity?"

---

"Though we collect no tolls from this road, we still benefit from it."

"How so?"

"Father, surely you know: roads bring merchants, bring wealth?"

Lu Ruohua understood: "You use roads to attract merchants."

"Yes, Father. With merchants come wealth. The better and safer the roads, the more merchants come, and the greater our profits."

"Your leaders are truly far-sighted," Lu Ruohua's praise was sincere.

"Hehe, I believe there are many in this world who understand this principle."

The negotiations were held in the commercial house at East Gate Market. A meeting room had been cleaned up and furnished with a conference table. Father Lu felt somewhat nervous as he took his seat. Then he caught the aroma of that Arabian beverage—coffee. A girl in an unusual uniform of sorts served coffee in dazzling fine porcelain cups.

By this time, coffee had already reached Europe. In the late sixteenth century, the Venetians had been first to bring coffee to Europe, but only a few enjoyed it, and more people regarded it as a kind of medicine. However, Europeans in the Far East were quite familiar with the beverage, as the Muslim rulers and princes on the Indian subcontinent all had the habit of drinking coffee.

Though it was only inferior instant coffee, for this missionary the fact that the transmigrators were serving him coffee made him feel highly valued.

"Please wait a moment." He Ying courteously excused himself and disappeared behind the door.

The room was empty. He could only hear the coming and going of people in the corridor. Bored, Lu Ruohua began admiring the room's furnishings. All the furniture was of the finest Chinese style, though arranged haphazardly, unlike the refined orderliness of the Chinese merchants' homes he had visited. Nor were there the long Chinese scrolls on the walls. Recalling the simple cut and crude fabric of their clothing, it seemed these Australians had little artistic taste. Lu Ruohua calculated that when expanding the missionary team in the future, he should select a brother skilled in art to help—it would make it easier to penetrate their ruling elite. Beautiful things appealed to everyone.

Just as he was thinking about how to win over these Australians, he heard a commotion outside the door and the sound of English conversation, with some voices particularly loud. Lu Ruohua started—there were English here?! He hurried to the door and peeked out. He saw in the corridor a beautiful blonde, green-eyed woman in a trailing gown accompanied by a gentleman wearing a mask and wig, emerging from another room. Smiling as he saw them off was none other than Manager Wen Desi. The two exchanged a few more words. Manager Wen laughed, then said something in English, and the other party nodded repeatedly.

It seemed the English were also in contact with them. Judging by the visitors' appearance and bearing, they didn't seem like ordinary English traders in East Asia. The man wore a longsword—not a merchant's attire. Though the gentleman's mask concealed his features, his every gesture was commanding, his bearing impressive—clearly a gentleman of considerable military experience.

Such a gentleman would be at least a representative of the East India Company. If he was only here for trade, that would be fine. But bringing such a lady suggested the English might have some long-term designs here. The heretics in France could only stubbornly resist the King and the Church with English support. Could they have similar designs here?

A few minutes later, the door opened. Wen Desi walked in slowly, followed by several "Australians," among whom Lu Ruohua recognized He Ying and Bai Duoluo. Wen Desi courteously welcomed Father Lu's arrival. Both parties then got down to business.

The negotiations were conducted in French through He Ying. Lu Ruohua first stated the Jesuits' requests—four points in all:

First, permit Jesuit missionaries to preach freely in Linggao, guaranteeing freedom of movement for missionaries within their territory.

Second, Jesuit missionaries may freely purchase or rent houses locally for religious and residential purposes.

Third, guarantee the personal and property safety of the Church, clergy, and believers.

Fourth, apart from the Jesuits, no other religious orders may send personnel to preach here.

Apart from the prohibition on other orders preaching here, all four points fell within the Executive Committee's expectations. Wen Desi didn't directly answer whether they were acceptable, but first made a solemn statement:

Australia had a Catholic Church. Although no bishop or priest had accompanied their return to the Central Plains, a priest had come to handle Church affairs.

"This is Father Bai Duoluo. Though he is a lay brother, he is most loyal to your religion and Church."

Bai Duoluo bowed awkwardly.

"And this is He Ying," Wen Desi continued his introductions. "He is your translator, and also the Executive Committee's Religious Affairs Officer. All matters concerning the Linggao Church can be negotiated with the Executive Committee through him."

He Ying bowed slightly: "At your service!"

"We agree to the missionary request, but—" Wen Desi emphasized this last word.

"But." Lu Ruohua of course knew what came after "but" was the crucial part. He held his breath and listened intently to He Ying's translation.
