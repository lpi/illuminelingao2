# Chapter 1263 - The Fall of Anping

The noise behind the curtain grew louder; Xue Ziliang could hear heavy breathing. He raised his rifle and pressed the stock against his shoulder—there were no VIPs here that needed to be taken alive. When facing a potential threat, he preferred to ask questions with bullets.

The Minnan translator shouted again, this time adding, "If you don't come out, we'll shoot!"

Finally, a woman's trembling voice came from behind the curtain: "Don't shoot!" A woman emerged, about thirty years old, dressed like a servant. She must have been hiding in the room out of fear of the gunfire.

Seeing Xue Ziliang's group, she immediately knelt and begged piteously. Xue Ziliang couldn't understand her, but the Minnan translator exchanged a few words with her and said, "She says she's a servant here, hiding. She begs the soldiers not to kill her..."

"Take her out and hand her to the prisoner team," Xue Ziliang said. However, a sideways glance from the woman as she was being led away felt wrong to him. Xue Ziliang shouldered his gun and signaled the team members to go over for a further search.

A team member lifted the curtain. Behind it was a couch, empty, but lifting the bed revealed a child hiding underneath.

"There's a boy!"

Xue Ziliang looked at the boy brought before him—about six or seven years old, with delicate features and expensive clothing. Despite the sudden calamity, he managed to maintain a strong composure, neither crying nor fussing. clearly not a child from an ordinary family.

Xue Ziliang looked carefully, then suddenly called out in Japanese: "Fusong!"

The boy was startled, his eyes widening, and he involuntarily responded.

"Report to headquarters immediately. I have captured Zheng Sen." As a "banana" (Westernized Chinese), Xue Ziliang didn't know the historical status this boy held in the late Ming dynasty of the old timeline, but he was well aware of the Senate's emphasis on "Zheng Sen." The identification manual for important Zheng group figures issued before the operation included data on this boy—though the photo was missing.

"Send a few men to take him to the ship. Protect him well." Xue Ziliang knew this child was Zheng Zhilong's eldest son, and his importance went without saying. Pointing to the woman from earlier, he added, "Send this woman along too."

At this time, news came from various quarters that the entire residence had been cleared. The leaders of each team came to report their search results. The mansion wasn't too heavily damaged; although destruction was found in many places, most of it was intact. They also found the residence's account room and silver vault, which had been sealed. There was a large granary stockpiled with huge amounts of grain, wine, oil, salt, and dried meat and fish, enough to feed several hundred people for a year. There was also an armory housing many weapons, ranging from traditional swords to Japanese arquebuses and European muskets—including some very rare weapons.

"We picked this up at the entrance." A corporal handed over a peculiar pistol. It looked like a revolver but was ornately decorated and exquisitely crafted. Xue Ziliang knew a bit about antique weapons and recognized it as a European-made wheellock revolver, a high-tech item for the time—requiring skilled craftsmen and a lot of time to manufacture.

"I didn't expect Zheng Zhilong to hide such good stuff." Xue Ziliang tried aiming it and dry-fired it once, finding it hard to put down. However, he handed the pistol back to the corporal:

"Put it back in the storeroom and wait for the Planning Agency people to receive it."

Ying Yu also entered the residence—he had come to assess the effect of the bombardment. Seeing Xue Ziliang smoking a cigar in contemplation, he asked, "Old Xue, the defense is arranged. Troops heading for Nan'an and Jinjiang have been sent out—I estimate the Ming troops on both sides won't react. Is there anything else we need to do now?"

"Now we wait."

"Wait for what?"

"Wait for the Planning Agency people to come," Xue Ziliang said.

"We need to set up a command post," Ying Yu said. "This place isn't suitable."

Xue Ziliang also felt that the layout here was too deep and inconvenient for personnel entry and exit. Besides, cleaning up the residence was the business of the Planning Agency and the Intelligence Bureau; there was no point in them staying here. So he led his men to the city gate tower to establish the command post.

Army and Navy soldiers, under the direction of Intelligence Bureau agents, conducted a comprehensive search of the Zheng manor. Every corpse in the residence was identified and registered one by one by captives led by Intelligence Bureau personnel in the open square. Important figures were photographed and fingerprinted.

Captured prisoners were all sent to Kinmen Island for detention—a temporary camp had been established there to hold prisoners. The Planning Agency Special Search Team and Intelligence Bureau Action Team led soldiers to search and seal the homes of key personnel of the Zheng group within Anping City one by one.

The city was filled with a grim atmosphere. All four gates were guarded by soldiers with bayonets. Machine guns were mounted on the gate towers, strictly forbidding all personnel entry and exit. Besides the soldiers coming and going on the streets, there were only laborers conscripted according to the *baojia* system to extinguish fires, clean up debris, and move corpses and the wounded. Squads of White Horse Unit and Teishin-tai (Vanguard) soldiers, speaking unintelligible languages and wielding big clubs and Japanese swords, ran hurriedly under the command of naturalized personnel, carrying out raids and arrests. For the ordinary people of Anping, although they had been in fear since the shelling began in the morning, most families were safe except for a few unlucky ones killed by stray bullets. The Australians didn't kill indiscriminately or loot; they only focused on raiding and arresting the big households.

Bold ones peeked through window cracks and door gaps, watching the outside. The big households related to the Zheng family, the powerful local tyrants in the city: the "upper class," the "nouveaux riches," the "relatives of the untouchable so-and-so" who used to strut around and live in luxury were now being dragged away one by one. The dead were thrown onto carts and hauled to the open ground to be exposed; the living were tied by the neck with ropes by the "Vagabond bandits" (Australians) and dragged away one after another like catching rats. The precious wives, concubines, young masters, and young ladies walked crying on the road barefoot with disheveled hair like the lowliest servants—anyone walking too slowly would get a big club to the face from the escorting soldiers. Such a gratifying scene was something the common people, who had always lived in servility, had never seen before. Some who had been slapped by them, some whose wives and daughters had been bullied, and some whose wages had been exploited or property seized, cried and laughed in their hearts, secretly saying: *You have your day too!*

There were also those who used to live off the scraps of the powerful, who relied on others' power to bully people, who took pride in being a retainer of so-and-so or a slave of who-and-who, and who constantly had the phrase "Are you worthy of the surname Zheng?" on their lips. They were now heartbroken and terrified, fearing that the Vagabond bandits would destroy the Zheng family's foundation, leaving them with no scraps to eat in the future, and also fearing that the Vagabond bandits would settle scores for their past deeds of eating scraps. Their hearts were frying in oil.

Xue Ziliang and Ying Yu didn't know the thoughts of the citizens. They were more concerned with how much loot could be scraped from here—after all, this was the main objective of this campaign. The Elder sent by the Planning Agency to preside over the work brought a massive Special Search Team.

Each squad of the Special Search Team was equipped with two translators who spoke Minnan dialect and were relatively familiar with the situation in Anping. Some were naturalized citizens, and others were "guides" (collaborators) who had just defected—as soon as order was restored in the city, many guides appeared seeking revenge or fortune, volunteering to "lead the way to search for rich households."

The Special Search Team had maps and rosters in hand—the result of more than half a year of effort by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. The role of the guides was simply to make the process faster and more accurate. However, the Planning Agency Search Team had received strict orders to only arrest and raid according to the list and map; they were not allowed to act solely on the accusations of the guides. All accusations had to be compiled into materials and reviewed by the Elder before a decision could be made.

The results of the raids were impressive. There were many residences of middle and upper-level figures of the Zheng group in Anping City. Although many were not in their residences, their families were caught in one fell swoop.

The Anping defender Zheng Zhiwan, who should have protected them, escaped alone: as soon as the shelling stopped, he immediately took his family and servants, loaded the gold, silver, and treasures from his manor onto carts, and fled the city under the escort of his personal guards, running directly to Jinjiang County City.

The families of many generals, shopkeepers, and stewards were almost all captured, and their family properties fell into the hands of the Senate. Zheng Zhilong's own residence was not spared; not only was all family property seized, but his wife Lady Yan, eldest son Zheng Sen, Zheng Sen's birth mother Lady Tagawa, and other family members in Anping City were all captured.

These prisoners were all sent to the POW camp for screening—there were sellouts and vengeful guides everywhere. Attempts to hide identities rarely succeeded; many tried to disguise themselves as servants or ordinary people but were quickly exposed by the guides.

Public and private property seized from various large households and warehouses piled up like mountains, counted item by item, packed, and transported away. Preliminary count: over 800,000 taels of silver and over 10,000 taels of gold were seized in Anping City. Over 400,000 taels of silver were confiscated from the Zheng manor alone—and this was without digging three feet into the ground. According to the traditional Chinese treasure-hiding mode, large households likely hid even more gold, silver, and treasures underground or inside double walls.

As heavy military commanders in the Anping direction, Xue Ziliang and Ying Yu were not responsible for the specific looting operations in the city. Their task in Operation Overlord was simple: occupy Anping and secure it until the headquarters issued the retreat order. To this end, seeing that he sent multiple alert detachments towards Jinjiang and Nan'an counties, he also sent an Army reconnaissance platoon to harass the outskirts of both county cities to test the reaction of the Ming troops there.

The result was that both counties kept their gates tightly shut, and the garrisons everywhere within the counties remained immovable. The two groups of personal guards sent from Xiamen to pick up families were both defeated in brief battles.
