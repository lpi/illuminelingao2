# Chapter 883 - Standardized Ships

Zhang Guangtian heard this but said nothing. The Fan family burning and smashing Buddhist and Daoist statues was, after all, wasting their own property. Previously, several other prominent scholar-gentry families had converted en masse and burned Buddha statues too; one couldn't control them. The Chan sect in its day claimed to "scold the Buddhas and revile the ancestors," and there was the story of Chan Master Danxia burning a wooden Buddha for warmth. Although Zhang Guangtian held a hereditary military post, in his spare time he read many Chan kōans and wasn't as alarmed by such "blasphemous" acts as Monk Guangdi. It was just that recently, those flocking madly to this Far Western teaching were mostly people of the Confucian orthodoxy. If such people truly prevailed, there would inevitably be another persecution like the Three Wu Emperors destroying Buddhism continuously in the future. The harm might be even greater than the Three Wu persecutions.

As he mused thus, Monk Guangdi, accustomed to ingratiating himself with people, saw that this "white-robed senior brother" was in a bad mood and dared not chatter on. He accompanied him for another half-li before bidding farewell and returning to Jingci Temple.

Zhang Guangtian returned home. He was a hereditary Hundred Households military officer of the local Guard, but Zhang Guangtian was already stranger to things like fighting wars—ordinarily, he was just an ordinary scholar delicately devoted to Buddhism.

The Zhang family wasn't very wealthy, living the life of a so-called "plowing and reading" middle-class family—of course, he didn't plow himself, but lived on rents collected from the land attached to the Guard post.

Shortly after returning home, while still troubled by this matter, suddenly the gatekeeper reported: a Mr. Huang from Fujian requested an audience.

"Huang Zhen indeed went to Zhang Guangtian's house." Zhao Tong, pretending to be a patient, whispered to Zhang Yingchen who was taking his pulse.

Zhang Yingchen nodded slightly, indicating he heard.

"Huang Zhen stayed at the Zhang house for over two hours before coming out," Zhao Tong continued reporting. "After returning to the inn, his mood was very good, and he didn't even eat gruel for dinner."

Zhang Yingchen nodded again: the seed he planted in Huang Zhen's heart had sprouted so quickly; it surprised even him.

Since he went to find Zhang Guangtian, the subsequent events needed no asking: Zhang Guangtian would certainly introduce him to Monk Yuanwu of Tiantong Temple in Ningbo. Even if Yuanwu didn't write that *First Discussion on Discerning Heaven* following the historical trajectory, he would take similar measures. The pool of spring water that was West Lake was about to be ruffled.

"Does he intend to go to Ningbo?"

"Not for the moment," Zhao Tong said. "But if he goes, we'll definitely know—Huang Zhen took our depot's sedan chair when he came to Hangzhou last time. Walking to Ningbo, he'll most likely come buy tickets from us again."

"Mm, keep a close eye on him. Watch his activities. Notify me immediately once he goes to Ningbo." Zhang Yingchen spoke with barely moving lips, then wrote a prescription and gave him another packet of "pill medicine," raising his voice to say:

"Take one dose first, then come back in three days."

The next day, a telegram was sent from the Hangzhou Station to the External Intelligence Bureau in Lingao.

Center:

I have already introduced Huang Zhen to Zhang Guangtian. Zhang will likely introduce him to Monk Yuanwu of Tiantong Temple. It seems the show is about to draw its curtain. What joy to participate in such a grand event! Please ask the Grand Library to search for a copy of *Posthumous Letters on Discerning Learning* printed by Giulio Aleni and others in Fujian, absolutely must include the preface signed by Yang Tingyun with his religious name Michael.

"Heh heh, I'll prepare all the ammunition; I don't worry you won't fight." Zhang Yingchen thought this after sending the telegram.

But he still had an unresolved matter: that gentry member who wanted to "compound the great elixir" with him was haunting him like a ghost. After talking last time, despite Zhang Yingchen repeatedly saying he didn't know much about "bedroom arts" and only teaching him some guiding techniques for strengthening the body, the other party somehow became even more convinced he "contained another universe" inside. He became even more respectful, frequently sending people to "give alms" and inviting him to go "sit and discuss the Dao" again. He still hadn't thought of a good way to get rid of this old reprobate.

"Pity Ji Tuisi can't produce Viagra!" Zhang Yingchen muttered to himself. If he had that drug in hand, in a wealthy and prosperous place like Jiangnan, plenty of people would fight to buy it even for fifty taels of silver.

While Daoist Zhang sowed discord, the Hangzhou Station had begun a series of preparatory works. Zhao Yingong found himself running over a dozen projects simultaneously. Phoenix Villa construction, the villa's agriculture, silk reeling, Qinghe Ward cultural bookstore, printing office, Qiwei Depot's Jiangsu-Zhejiang layout, Nanjing Delong Branch preliminary preparations, educating orphans, Hangzhou Church negotiations... Although some of these projects were delegated to inspection team elders, every elder was now working sixteen hours a day. Mei Lin complained incessantly, saying he thought coming to Jiangnan was a cushy job, didn't expect it to be busier than Lingao. Not only did he travel between Phoenix Villa and Qinghe Ward daily to direct infrastructure and renovation, but at night when not working, he also had to help handle various affairs and act as a teacher for the orphans.

Xu Ke and Lu Zhongxing were even more miserable than Mei Lin—at least Mei Lin had excellent food and a warm bed every day. They spent most of their time rushing about outside, eating field rations and sleeping in boat cabins. Protected by escort guards, the two conducted road and river surveys along the refugee transport and collection routes to draw accurate transportation maps: each map had to note road and river capacity. They conducted field surveys of locations along the route that could serve as refugee rest stops, estimating the reception capacity of each location. These all had to be included in the contingency plans.

Amidst this busyness, they also had to rotate visits to Qiwei's various branches in Jiangnan: currently, even naturalized citizen personnel and local employees were busy as bees. Qiwei's burden was especially heavy, with construction tasks for five branches urgent as fire: expanding the alliance, buying boats, recruiting hands... Mao Sansheng and others spun like tops. To prevent errors amidst the chaos, the elders adopted this patrol system to discover and solve problems in time.

As the prelude to the Dengzhou Rebellion was about to open, Zhao Yingong anxiously awaited the arrival of the Population Work Team personnel—these elders and naturalized citizens were staff prepared for the Dengzhou Rebellion and the Northern Zhejiang Drought of 1632. Before formally intervening in the Dengzhou Rebellion, they could all be used as Hangzhou Station manpower. For this, he repeatedly wired the Executive Committee, asking for the speedy dispatch of Population Work Team personnel.

While the Hangzhou Station was intensively setting up stalls to prepare for tomorrow's refugee flood, the Executive Committee was debating endlessly over the details of refugee collection and transport. The Planning Commission racked its brains formulating plans.

The biggest bottleneck was current insufficient transport capacity—shipyards were producing at full speed, but they were building warships. Of course, hybrid-powered warships could carry people, but this transport involved cold, hungry, disease-ridden refugees; using warships was obviously unsuitable. Specialized transport vessels had to be used.

Navy ships could provide some capacity. As for Great Wave Shipping, its freight tasks were already heavy; diverting excess tonnage to transport people would be very difficult. And transporting people wasn't like transporting cargo; time at sea was long, and turnaround trips were many. It wasn't efficient for ship utilization.

Thus, the Planning Commission's urgent task was shipbuilding to expand capacity. Wu De knew expecting the Lingao Shipyard was unrealistic—the shipyard's entire production capacity was occupied by constructing the 854 Modification, 901, and 621 projects. Arranging construction of specialized transport ships was completely impossible.

At this time, Shi Jiantao, responsible for setting up the shipyard in Hong Kong, voluntarily requested to build transport ships. For this, he specially returned to Lingao and requested an audience with Wu De.

"Can the Hong Kong Shipyard do it?" Wu De was very skeptical—in the Planning Commission's priority list for material and personnel allocation, the Hong Kong Shipyard was in a very unimportant position. The Hong Kong Shipyard was initially established mainly for ship repair and maintenance. It had only built one dry dock for small vessels and several slipways. It was basically at the level of a beach shipyard. Large equipment was scarce, and trained labor was insufficient. After arriving in Hong Kong, Shi Jiantao had to work hard to recruit local Cantonese shipwrights.

Shi Jiantao's suggestion to "drop dumplings" (mass produce) standardized transport ships in Hong Kong had been proposed for a long time. The Planning Commission, considering expanding ship production capacity, had approved his expansion plan, and a simple gantry crane had recently been installed.

A timber processing plant invested in by the Planning Commission in Hong Kong had also recently entered trial production. This factory wasn't prepared as a supporting facility for the shipyard, but to process forestry resources from Guangdong and Fujian nearby, avoiding transport of large quantities of raw logs and saving freight tonnage. Having a timber processing plant was a favorable condition for the shipyard.

"I have confidence." Shi Jiantao had long prepared a full set of plans and blueprints. He hurriedly presented them now. "Our approach is standardized shipbuilding—similar to Liberty ships."

"Mn." Wu De nodded. Standardized shipbuilding wasn't a rare thing. The currently produced 854s and 901s were also standardized ship types.

"You know very well that what we lack most is transport capacity. To expand capacity, we must expand shipbuilding. To expand shipbuilding quantity, we must improve production efficiency." Shi Jiantao spoke with assurance. "So we designed the 'Harmony Wheel' implementing the 'Liberty Ship' concept."

"Harmony Wheel." Wu De's face went blank for a moment.

The Harmony Wheel [He Xie Lun] was neither harmonious [a pun on river crab], nor were most of them steamers [Lun]. They were simply cargo ships built in large batches using standardized blueprints, mass-produced standard parts, and assembly line methods, referencing the idea of American Liberty and Victory ships built during WWII.

Just as American Liberty ships weren't of only one type, Lingao's Harmony Wheels also had several standard designs.

On the Planning Commission's schedule, Lingao Shipyard's shipbuilding plan was "Class A Shipbuilding," while Hong Kong Shipyard belonged to "Class B Shipbuilding." There were clear gaps in allocated materials, personnel, and technical level. So the "Harmony Wheels" were almost entirely wooden-structured, sail-powered small and medium auxiliary vessels not exceeding 800 tons.
