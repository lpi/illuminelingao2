# Chapter 891 - Taiwan Island

As for the refugees gathered from Zhejiang, the General Staff suggested establishing a transit point in Taiwan. Refugees would go to Taiwan first, be "stockpiled" in camps on Taiwan for a period, and then be transported back to Lingao. Some could stay directly in Taiwan to develop the land, forming a second colony.

Of course, the situation in Taiwan was somewhat more complicated. There were multiple forces on the island, including the Dutch, the Spanish, and Zheng Zhilong, each having their own territory: the Dutch controlled Tayouan (Dayuand), Zheng Zhilong occupied Beigang, and the Spanish occupied Keelung (Jilong). Generally, they were spread along the coastline facing the mainland from Taipei to Tainan. Taiwan's indigenous people, Malay immigrants, and Japanese also had some small influence locally.

However, the scale of these forces was very small, and the territory they occupied wasn't large. The Dutch, Spanish, and Zheng Zhilong centered their power on one or two castle strongpoints, occupying a very small surrounding area. Besides trade, they collected tribute from Fujian immigrants and indigenous people. The proportion of the latter was very small. Except for Zheng Zhilong organizing some immigrants for agricultural development locally, the main purpose of Europeans occupying these places was to serve as trade outposts and collect local products—mainly Taiwan deerskins.

Given the transmigrators' Army and Navy strength, destroying these forces would be as easy as flipping a hand. According to historical data: the Spanish garrison in Keelung had no more than 90 Europeans, plus one or two hundred auxiliary troops levied from the Philippines. In 1631-1632, the Dutch were still building Zeelandia Castle, with a total European garrison not exceeding 400. Their sphere of influence reached its limit 30 km outside the castle. In 1630, they were even nearly driven away by the Mattau tribe of Taiwan indigenous people. Only after the East India Company reinforced massively in 1635 did they begin large-scale punitive expeditions against surrounding indigenous villages to expand their ruling area.

Therefore, the threat of these forces on land was minimal; it wasn't an exaggeration to say they couldn't withstand a single blow. Dispatching one infantry battalion reinforced with a small amount of artillery would be enough to sweep the whole island. But the situation at sea was more complex. The Dutch were currently trade partners, and their naval strength in East Asia was limited, so they wouldn't risk angering the Senate to take hostile action. The Spanish were only a "presence" in the waters near Taiwan.

The only obstacle was Zheng Zhilong. The Fujian coast was his main area of activity. A naval transport convoy passing through this area, or even landing on Taiwan Island to build a transit base, definitely couldn't be hidden from him. If he wanted to launch an intervention, it would be a major hindrance to Operation Engine.

If passing through the Taiwan Strait: given the tonnage and armament of the Harmony ships and the combat power of escort warships, unless Zheng Zhilong launched a large-scale naval battle, he could pose almost no threat. in the Navy's map exercises, the side playing Zheng Zhilong rarely caught the transport convoy passing through the Taiwan Strait. In other words, with the communication and navigation levels of that time, even if Zheng Zhilong intended to fight, he wouldn't necessarily catch the opportunity.

However, if they were to dock and anchor on Taiwan Island itself, they inevitably had to enter and exit Taiwan's coastal harbors, giving Zheng Zhilong many combat opportunities. This point had to be taken into consideration.

Everyone believed establishing a base in Taiwan was necessary—in terms of development value, Taiwan was higher than Hainan. But there were different opinions on exactly where to select as the transit base. Several places were listed for selection, including Keelung, Tainan, Hualien, Kaohsiung, etc.

Keelung and Tamsui occupied by the Spanish were vetoed first. Although there were rich mineral resources near Keelung, such as the famous Keelung coal mine and Jinguashi gold-copper mine, development difficulty was high, and the geographical environment was extremely harsh. It required investing huge manpower and resources for remediation.

Contemporary records also had no praise for this place: "Keelung (Kelang) and Tamsui (Tansoei) are not excellent anchorages; plus the nearby savages are fierce and cannot be interacted with." "Haven't you heard of the evil water and soil of Keelung and Tamsui? People fall ill upon arrival, and illness leads to death. All servants hearing of being sent to Keelung or Tamsui sigh and lament as if sent to a land of death; naval rules rotate garrisons in spring and autumn, considering returning alive lucky/fortunate. If even sturdy soldiers and servants are like this, how can you bear it?"

Keelung and Tamsui are both located in northern Taiwan, the island's most abundant rainfall region, with annual precipitation over 3000mm. In normal years, Taipei rains for half the year. Areas with excessive rain favor plant and microbial growth but are unfavorable to humans. Thus Fujianese in the Ming and Qing dynasties called Taipei a land of miasma, and the death rate of immigrants there was very high. Setting the transit base here, the death rate could be imagined.

Northern Taiwan also had a major earthquake in 1694. The intensity was so great it directly shook out a 30 square kilometer Lake Taipei in the Taipei Basin. From any angle, the Taipei area wasn't a spot transmigrators should set foot in.

Hualien also received support from many people. Hualien's advantage was extremely high security. It is located in eastern Taiwan, separated from other parts of the island by mountains. Surrounding terrain is precipitous; most areas are unsuitable for ships to dock. The coast is mostly very steep, with ship-berthing terrain only at river mouths. As long as a base is established at the river mouth, landing from other places is impossible. Historically, before the road opened in 1932, Hualien's connection with other parts of Taiwan relied only on shipping, known as Taiwan's "land island." Throughout the 17th century, except for the Spanish going to Hualien to mine placer gold in 1622, no one was interested in this place.

Hualien has relatively rich mineral resources. The transmigrators could immediately mine three types: silicate serpentine asbestos ore, marble, and limestone. Hualien remained Taiwan's most important cement production area even in the 21st century. High-grade cement could be produced on-site to supply Taiwan's development. There was also a small amount of iron ore locally; reserves weren't large, but mining was easy. Additionally, Hualien's serpentine ore was often associated with chromite, magnetite, and aluminum-magnesium. Hualien's surface at that time probably had scattered distribution of nearly everything except coal, very suitable for a small-scale group like Lingao to develop and mine.

Regarding freshwater resources, Hualien has three relatively large rivers and quite a few alluvial plains of significant size; developing agriculture there also had certain potential.

But in the end, Hualien was eliminated due to excessive rain. Excessive rain made the local environment unsuitable for large-scale immigration. During the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, there were plans to move immigrants to Hualien to establish agricultural settlement zones, which ultimately failed due to climate and disease.

Finally listed for consideration was the Pingtung and Kaohsiung area. This place is on the Tainan Plain, relatively suitable for habitation and agriculture on Taiwan Island. Kaohsiung has a port; although the port wasn't dredged at the time and couldn't berth large ships, berthing sailing ships under a thousand tons was still achievable.

South of Pingtung and Kaohsiung are mountains; north is the Dutch sphere of influence. Currently, the Dutch and the Senate had a commercial agreement, maintaining a relationship of "peaceful" commercial cooperation. The Dutch had neither the strength nor the daring to risk offending a major supplier by attacking the Pingtung/Kaohsiung transit base. The Dutch could also serve to isolate Zheng Zhilong. Moreover, given Zheng Zhilong's current busy state of internal strife along the Fujian coast, he wouldn't necessarily have time to deal with the "Short-haired Thieves."

"We transport Zhejiang immigrants to Kaohsiung and Pingtung. Not only can we have a suitable location for quarantine and purification, but some people can also carry out agricultural development on the spot. The Chianan Plain is Taiwan's best agricultural production area; sunlight, rain, and soil are all top-class. We can absolutely conduct intensive development via large-scale farms, which is much better than the production environment in Hainan where small-scale peasant economy dominates. It will be a leap forward for our agricultural production. It can drastically improve our situation of relying on imports for basic grain," Luo Duo said at the end of his speech strongly arguing for Kaohsiung as the base.

"What if Zheng Zhilong moves against us? His lair is right in Fujian." Someone raised an objection. Zheng Zhilong regarded Fujian as his lair, and he had official status; his power couldn't be underestimated.

"We don't need to fear his sailing fleet. By the end of 1631, after our Refitted 854 and the first batch of Type 901s are completed, our fleet will be god-like in the Taiwan Strait. Forward deploy the steam fleet to Kaohsiung to conduct area escort for our ships passing through the Taiwan Strait." Navy Staff Officer Li Di said, "Our Navy has full command of the sea around Hainan Island up to Hong Kong Island. Stationing the steam fleet in Kaohsiung can deter various forces along the Fujian and Zhejiang coasts from acting rashly. Guaranteeing the safety of going north to Jeju Island and south to Hong Kong Island."

Specific measures were to form two detachments. The Taiwan Detachment centered on the Refitted 854 and four Type 901s would be stationed in Kaohsiung, responsible for monitoring the coasts of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. The priority was guaranteeing "freedom of navigation" in the Taiwan Strait and escorting transport convoys. The Deng-Lai Detachment centered on three Type 901s would be stationed on Jeju Island, ready to execute intervention missions along the Shandong coast and Bohai Bay area at any time.

Besides hybrid-powered warships, the detachments also incorporated several refitted large-tonnage sailing warships. The warships of the two detachments would adopt a zonal escort method. Transport convoys would sail in formation during the voyage, with each transport ship equipped with sufficient self-defense firepower.

These 7 steam warships were expected to operate in this sea area until early 1633. By then, the second batch of Type 901 ships built in Lingao would be able to enter service, relieving the previous batch of warships to return to Lingao for maintenance.

These two detachments would use Kaohsiung as their main base. Port facilities and stockpiled supplies to provide logistical support for steam/sail hybrid warships were much more complex than for sailing warships. Therefore, ships going north to pick up refugees wouldn't worry about empty load tonnage. Besides supplies needed for transporting refugees, the supplies needed to open sub-bases in Kaohsiung and Jeju Island were enough to fill the holds.
