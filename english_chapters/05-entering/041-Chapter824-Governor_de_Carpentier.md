# Chapter 824 - Governor de Carpentier

"This is the intelligence you got from that woman?" In an official residence in Batavia, Dutch East India Company Governor de Carpentier looked at the report in his hand and asked the respectful Spanish veteran before him.

A man of medium build stood before the fireplace. He looked arrogant and cruel, with sharp eyes, a broad forehead, a handlebar mustache, and a short beard below his lip, making his thin face look long. Years of exposure to the East Indies sun had turned his skin an unhealthy bronze. Though only in his early forties, his hair was graying—the East Indies were not hospitable.

This man was the Governor-General of the Dutch East India Company in Batavia: de Carpentier. As the successor to Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the founder of the Company's presence in Southeast Asia, he was also an outstanding Governor, possessing all the traits of a senior Company executive: shrewdness, ruthlessness, calculating mind, and perseverance.

"Yes, Your Excellency," Savanchi Gonzalez said. "It cost four thousand guilders."

"Quite a lot." The Governor blurted out with a merchant's reaction. Gonzalez felt a flash of disdain—though just a so-called "country gentleman" from the Castilian countryside, he possessed the character of a "Spanish Lord," incompatible with the Dutch "shopkeeper" mindset.

De Carpentier carefully examined the bound booklet in his hand. Written in a woman's beautiful, delicate script were the answers to his 125 questions. Some answers were simple, just a few words; others spanned dozens of pages.

He rang the bell on the table, and his secretary entered.

"Translate this booklet. Into German." The Governor said. "Quickly."

"I'll translate it overnight. I'll bring it to you tomorrow morning." The secretary bowed and withdrew.

The Dutch Governor couldn't read Portuguese. He had to wait for the translation. But this "Sebanc"—having stayed in Macau for months, he must have gathered useful information.

"Well, you came from Macau; you must have heard much about these Australians. I hear it's a trade point they frequent."

"Yes, Your Excellency."

"Tell me what you saw." De Carpentier picked up a goblet from the tray, filled it with rare Portuguese wine, and handed it to him.

"Thank you, Your Excellency." Savanchi Gonzalez gratefully took the cup and drank a large mouthful. Honestly, the wine wasn't good—over a year of sea travel and the local 30+ degree heat had turned it sour. But for someone deprived of wine for so long, it was nectar.

"I heard many stories about the Australians in Macau, and saw their goods..."

"Start from the beginning. Tell me your impression of that Portuguese woman."

"She is beautiful!" Savanchi Gonzalez laughed. "And hot. A bit like a Creole woman. Very smart and cunning. God as my witness, a little devil hides in her body!"

"She is said to be influential in Macau?"

"Yes." Savanchi Gonzalez said. "Word is she's ruthless; her enemies often die mysteriously or vanish without a trace. She acquires wealth from the sea, so she has power among the upper class."

The Governor nodded. His Macau intelligence network confirmed this: Li Siya had strong influence in the Municipal Council via bribery. Generous and asking for little, she was a welcome patron to the councilors.

"Though it seems to me she's reclusive; never appears in public. Many have heard of her but never seen her. Few even know where she lives."

"How did you meet her?"

"In a tavern, then someone took me—blindfolded."

"She is careful." The Governor muttered. Li Siya had many enemies. Macau wasn't big; hiding wasn't easy.

"Talk about the Australians."

Savanchi Gonzalez recounted his observations in Macau, especially the "Aussie goods" sold there: vast amounts of rum and Chinese spirits, various papers from fine writing paper to toilet paper, sugar products—especially white sugar, rock sugar, and fruit candies...

De Carpentier listened carefully—though the Sebanc soldier spoke incoherently, it was genuine first-hand material. Combined with Li Siya's intelligence, it was enough for Batavia to determine policy toward the Australians.

The Australians' appearance initially drew no Dutch attention—Guangzhou, China's biggest trade port, was occupied by the Portuguese. After failing to open ports in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, the VOC's window to China shifted to Tayouan in Taiwan. Their main partners were Fujian merchants, not Guangdong ones. Let alone Hainan, a remote island in western Guangdong. News of overseas people occupying a remote Chinese island took six months to reach Batavia, and no one cared. Only when Leizhou began selling massive amounts of high-quality sugar did "Australians" truly enter the VOC's vision.

Sugar was one of the VOC's most profitable cargoes from China, sold to Europe and the Middle East—second only to spices. Now, large quantities of high-quality sugar appearing in Guangzhou, Macau, and Vietnam naturally attracted attention. Reports from Tayouan stated: Chinese merchants bringing white sugar said it came from Leizhou and Lingao—and that Lingao's commerce was booming, with prosperous import-export trade.

Batavia's merchants checked maps for "Lingao"; finding it far from key ports, they relaxed. Then, they got more news from their coastal ally Liu Xiang: the group in Lingao called themselves Australians, descendants of a former dynasty, etc. Key news: Australian armaments were strong enough for self-defense, having defeated Spanish and pirate attacks. This made the merchants nervous—a new power was rising in Lingao.

Although the Dutch took no action, they watched Lingao. The VOC's priority was monopolizing the spice trade from the East Indies to the Middle East/Europe, followed by expanding dominance in Japan/China trade. Would the Australians' sudden appearance and mass exports affect this?

Overall, Australian overseas trade wasn't aggressive. Despite heavy imports/exports, their main partner was plainly the Ming. Second was Tonkin. Products sold elsewhere were mostly sold in Macau or Guangzhou. The VOC network never reported Australian merchant ships at Southeast Asian ports—though Aussie goods were flooding in. Clearly, Australians lacked long-range shipping capability. This reassured the merchants: monopolizing shipping meant monopolizing profit.

Especially since Lingao's goods were competitive. Besides alcohol and sugar, glass and paper had huge potential. The former had beaten Venetian goods in the Far East. Cheap Lingao glass and mirrors flooded Southeast Asia and India. Venetian products, from expensive mirrors to cheap beads, lost completely. The Council even wrote to Europe to stop purchasing Venetian goods, replacing them with Lingao products. Merchants found that even with shipping costs, buying glass mirrors in Guangzhou for sale in Europe was cheaper than Venetian ones—especially for large pieces. Paper wholesale prices were shockingly low.

From this, Lingao's Australians were potential partners, not enemies—the Dutch feared powers with strong naval forces. Destroying or squeezing out naval rivals to monopolize routes was their consistent aim.

Lingao didn't fit this. Although reports said Australians had a navy, including a castle-like iron ship, no one had seen the iron ship move. So De Carpentier thought it was either a rumor or the ship was immobile, not a threat.

This was a key concern for the Governor. As the Sea Coachman, he knew the potential threat of a super-ship. If it could sail, it was a massive threat, and its cargo capacity would be unimaginable.

"...About the big iron ship, it exists." Savanchi Gonzalez said. "Many merchants and sailors who've been to Bopu confirm it. Li Siya says it exists too."
