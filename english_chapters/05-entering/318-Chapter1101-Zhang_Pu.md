# Chapter 1101 - Zhang Pu

"With your present standing in the Society, you need only review a few examination essays to secure an excellent ranking in the upcoming provincial examination." Zhang Dai smiled knowingly. He was well aware that Zhao Yingong's *xiucai* credentials were dubiously obtained—their casual conversations had made abundantly clear that although this Master Zhao possessed learning of impressive breadth, his command of the Four Books and Five Classics was decidedly threadbare.

"It's precisely the examination essays I cannot master..."

Zhang Dai's smile deepened, and he lowered his voice conspiratorially. "We are both men of the same circle—what need is there for such pretense? So long as the writing is coherent, that will suffice."

Zhao Yingong had long heard whispers of the Revival Society's manipulation of the civil examinations—this was practically an open secret among Jiangnan's literati. Ever since the grand Jingling Assembly, the Society's influence had swelled enormously. With the deliberate patronage of Donglin-aligned officials at every level of government, joining the Revival Society had become a shortcut to examination success. By the time of Zhang Pu's death, when the Society's power reached its zenith, they could not only determine who passed but even pre-arrange the final rankings.

Many celebrated for their moral integrity in the late Ming showed remarkable flexibility in such matters. Even Wen Zhenmeng—a man so widely esteemed for his uprightness that the Emperor himself honored him as Imperial Lecturer and Grand Secretary—had readily obliged Zhang Pu's requests for patronage, quietly arranging the rankings of Revival Society candidates. In Zhao Yingong's assessment, the Donglin loyalists cooperated so willingly because they were driven by the ruthless logic of factional survival.

At court, moral integrity alone was insufficient to maintain one's footing—let alone implement one's political agenda. Self-preservation itself became precarious. From the bitter factional bloodlettings of the Tianqi era, both Donglin and the Revival Society had learned this lesson well: to reform governance, one first needed sufficient allies in both the capital and the provinces. Manipulating the civil examinations was simply the most expedient means to that end. And since the Revival Society's core members were accomplished scholars, producing examination essays that met the passing standard was hardly a challenge.

A thought stirred in Zhao Yingong's mind. He had long harbored quiet dissatisfaction with his mere *xiucai* status. In social dealings, he invariably felt a subtle inferiority to others—especially when encountering those who held *juren* or retired *jinshi* degrees. They treated him courteously enough, but once they learned he was merely a "blue-gowned scholar," a faint condescension invariably crept into their manner.

Yet such arrangements surely required silver, and Zhao Yingong had not yet joined the Revival Society. From a professional standpoint, his joining would be inappropriate.

"I'm not yet a member of the Revival Society..." he ventured.

Zhang Dai nodded thoughtfully. He knew the true extent of Zhao Yingong's "scholarship"—if he were actually to join the Society, the "Two Zhangs" would never approve. That would become a genuine embarrassment.

But his eyes brightened with sudden inspiration. "No matter. Master Zhao can become a 'Society Friend.'" He snapped his fan shut with a flourish. "A Society Friend of your renown is already celebrated throughout Jiangnan. Having Tianru help you ascend another rung would hardly be unseemly."

Conversing easily as they traveled, the two made swift passage to Taicang.

Taicang was a directly-administered prefecture, carved from portions of Kunshan, Jiading, and Changshu counties during the Hongzhi era. Situated along the Yangtze, its terrain was mostly sandy and elevated, making cotton the predominant crop.

From the Qing dynasty onward, Taicang would become a prosperous region—even during the three difficult years of famine, many local peasants still had commercial grain to eat, all thanks to cotton. But in the late Ming, the peculiarities of the fiscal system had transformed this cotton-producing region into an area of grinding poverty. The problem was that the locality produced very little grain, yet annual taxes had to be paid in kind. Locals were forced to sell their cotton and purchase grain from elsewhere to meet their obligations. When external grain was cheap, the burden remained bearable; once imported grain prices surged, it became crushing.

Over the past two years, Jiangnan's cotton textile industry had gone into severe decline, and Taicang's cotton cultivation had suffered greatly in turn. The villages along their route appeared quite desolate.

Their boat arrived at Zhang Pu's riverside landing. The house was new—not an ancestral residence. The flagpole before the gate, inscribed with "Metropolitan Graduate" (*jinshi jidi*), stood freshly erected, its lacquer still gleaming, exuding an air of recent celebration.

Zhao Yingong knew that although Zhang Pu was born a typical "second-generation heir" to both wealth and officialdom, his early life had been marked by considerable hardship. His uncle had served as Minister of Works in Nanjing, and his father was one of Taicang's most prominent landlords. Yet among ten brothers, Zhang Pu alone was the offspring of a concubine—disdained not only by his clan but even by his uncle's household servants, who showed open contempt for his father as well. After his father's death, the fifteen-year-old Zhang Pu and his mother were forced to leave the Zhang household, surviving on what she earned from spinning yarn to pay for his studies.

Considered purely as personal narrative—the journey from despised concubine's son to literary leader renowned throughout the realm—his story was not merely a model of success but would make a compelling novel.

Zhao Yingong instructed Cai Shi to present their visiting cards while he and Zhang Dai waited ashore. He knew that after Zhang Pu had been selected as a *shujishi*, his brilliant performance at the Hanlin Academy had displeased Wen Tiren. Under the pretext of caring for elderly relatives, Zhang Pu had taken leave and returned home, remaining in seclusion ever since—never returning to court until his death.

Nevertheless, his influence had only swelled during those years at home, at one point reaching such heights that through the Revival Society's forces at court, he could effectively sway the course of political events.

Zhao Yingong reflected that Zhang Pu's approach was essentially to manipulate court politics from behind the scenes. After all, as officials, he and Zhang Cai were too young and lacked the seniority to implement their political agenda directly. They had to work through senior officials of established reputation—and Zhou Yanru was Zhang Pu's chosen instrument.

Approaching him from the angle of supporting Zhou Yanru against Wen Tiren should succeed with seventy to eighty percent probability.

"My master invites the two gentlemen to meet in his study." A doorman who had been waiting at the gate bowed as he spoke, then led them through the entrance hall. Turning right from the courtyard, they passed through a small door and wound along covered corridors until they arrived at a secluded courtyard. Within stood a three-bay study with a central hall flanked by two smaller chambers. Various flowers and trees grew along the walls. In the western corner lay a small pond, surrounded by glazed-tile railings, with two strangely shaped stone mountains rising from the water amid dense bamboo.

Zhao Yingong had no mind for close inspection. He hastily adjusted his cap and robes, and after a servant announced them, he stepped through the doorway with bowed head and clasped hands, passing beneath the curtain a servant held aside.

Hanlin Academy *shujishi* Zhang Pu was already waiting inside.

---

Zhang Pu was quite young—only thirty years old, the same age as Zhao Yingong. He already wore three strands of a thin beard, lending him a mature air. Observing him carefully, Zhao Yingong judged from his demeanor and expression that he was a rather magnanimous person, yet the occasional gleam of steel in his eyes revealed an iron will and decisive temperament. This was by no means a simple, ineffectual man of good intentions.

It was said that in Zhang Pu's youth, two arrogant household slaves of his uncle—Chen Peng and Guo Kun—had bullied his father and repeatedly insulted him for his lowly birth. Zhang Pu had written his vow of revenge in blood. Years later, after his success in the examinations, he had Lu Zhenfei arrest the two slaves and bring them to Chongming County, where the magistrate secretly had them executed.

Seeing the two enter, Zhang Pu came forward with a smile. Both parties exchanged bows, and Zhang Dai introduced Zhao Yingong. After another round of courtesies, they settled in.

"I'll be frank, Master Tianru—I've come today with a favor to ask," Zhao Yingong said directly.

"I've already gathered as much," Zhang Pu replied, regarding him with a compelling intensity. As a literary leader capable of influencing court politics from behind the scenes, he possessed considerable presence. "Could it be concerning Sun Huodong?"

"Indeed." Zhao Yingong was secretly startled. Though he had discussed his intentions with Zhang Dai, the man had no interest in such matters and would never have sent word ahead to Zhang Pu. That Zhang Pu had guessed his purpose upon first meeting clearly demonstrated he maintained his own intelligence network.

"That is correct—it concerns Sun Huodong." Zhao Yingong nodded.

Zhang Pu fell silent, apparently weighing something in his mind. Finally he spoke: "What leads you to believe I possess the ability to help Sun Huodong?"

"You personally may not, but the Revival Society and Donglin can." Zhao Yingong spoke with absolute conviction. This too was a form of flattery, conveying the sentiment: *Who else but you for this great undertaking?*

"Sun Huodong has marriage ties to Grand Secretary Xu's son," Zhang Pu observed. "Why not seek Grand Secretary Xu's assistance?"

"For that very reason, Grand Secretary Xu is not in a position to speak on his behalf."

Another silence. Zhao Yingong knew that though Zhang Pu resided in Taicang, he was thoroughly informed about court affairs. He must now be weighing the merits and risks. After a moment's thought, Zhao Yingong spoke with utmost sincerity:

"In the calculus of court politics, Sun Huodong is but a minor piece on the board. Those now pursuing Sun Huodong—are they not actually aiming at Grand Secretary Zhou?" He paused to let the implication sink in. "If Sun Huodong falls, Grand Secretary Zhou himself may not long remain at court."

What would move Zhang Pu was precisely the matter of Zhou Yanru's position. The vitality of Zhou Yanru to the current Donglin and Revival Society—that was something Zhang Pu himself must weigh carefully.

"What leads you to such a conclusion?" Zhang Pu fixed him with an intent gaze.

Zhao Yingong had prepared thoroughly for this question. He possessed one crucial advantage: historical materials from later centuries concerning the entanglements between Zhou Yanru, Wen Tiren, and the Donglin faction were extensive, with abundant primary sources from all sides. His command of the complete picture and its subtle nuances might even exceed that of contemporaries. Thus he began with the Qian Longxi case, traced events through to the recent attacks by the censor Xue Guoguan—acting under instruction—against Zhou Yanru for allegedly arranging Wu Weiye's first-rank placement when he served as examiner. Not only were his materials from all parties thoroughly documented, but his analysis was cogent and systematic. The web of interests and conflicts between the various factions was laid out with crystalline clarity.

Zhang Pu listened attentively throughout, his eyes occasionally betraying surprise. Only when Zhao Yingong concluded did he speak: "I had no idea you understood court affairs so thoroughly, despite residing in Guangzhou!"

Zhao Yingong could only respond with a wry smile: this subject was too sensitive for elaboration.

Zhang Pu rose and paced a few steps, then turned. "Do you truly believe that if Sun Huodong falls, Grand Secretary Zhou cannot long remain either?"

"Yes," Zhao Yingong replied crisply. "The relationship between Sun Huodong and Grand Secretary Zhou is known throughout the realm. In this Dengzhou upheaval, if Sun Huodong cannot redeem himself through meritorious service, how can Grand Secretary Zhou maintain his position?" He immediately pressed the point: "Once Grand Secretary Zhou is gone, Grand Secretary Xu is already elderly and infirm. Which of the remaining Grand Secretaries could possibly match Secretary Wen?"
