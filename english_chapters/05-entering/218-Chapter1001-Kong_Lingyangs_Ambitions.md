# Chapter 1001 Kong Lingyang's Ambitions

In the kennel, he had prepared the most spirited dog for demonstration. This was a German Shepherd, a direct descendant of one pair from the six breeding dogs Yang Baogui had brought. Tall in stature, alert in appearance—obviously a well-trained working dog.

This dog named Burundi was currently multi-skilled. It served as a breeding stud while also working part-time at Changhua Fort, sometimes accompanying patrol teams on county patrols. It was already quite a famous hound—locally there was no such tall, fierce wolf-like dog breed, so rumors soon spread that the Australians had tamed wolves for patrol, inadvertently adding a deterrent element to local governance.

Burundi performed some simple actions under Kong Lingyang's commands, earning unanimous praise from everyone. As for Burundi's level, at most it was just the basic curriculum of civilian dog training schools in the old dimension—far from the skills displayed in real military or police dog performances. Because Burundi still had to serve as a breeding dog, training volume wasn't very high.

"I think mountain infantry can also be equipped. Would be very useful in mountain combat. Also, Operation Engine needs many security forces to suppress refugees; equipping them all with police dogs would reduce manpower requirements." Wei Aiwen was very excited.

"Difficult, Director Wei. You know working dogs are in demand everywhere now, supply can't meet demand—it all depends on whether they can work hard." Kong Lingyang instructed to take Burundi back to its special kennel. "But newly mature dogs can't be used immediately; they must undergo a period of training. Right now only Yang Baogui can do this. We're short on people!"

Wei Aiwen was worldly-wise and immediately heard the undertone—he had sung similar tunes many times himself. He immediately stated: "Your request for a few dog training team members is reasonable. I'll definitely fight for it at the Planning Bureau. I think it should be under the military; just establish a military dog instruction unit."

Kong Lingyang said: "That would be great. Yang Baogui has been worried about this. He's always wanted to take on more apprentices to pass on his skills."

Then they toured the kennels—although brick-and-wood construction, the design standards completely followed the old dimension, with strict disinfection. Changhua being selected as the current animal husbandry base had many factors, but for Kong Lingyang, Yang Baogui, and others, a major advantage was the sparse local population and basically no commerce or external population.

The success of newly prosperous animal husbandry places in the old dimension's 19th-20th centuries, such as Australia and Hokkaido, largely benefited from limited contact with the outside world and no imported infectious diseases. For densely raised livestock without developed vaccines, one epidemic could seriously damage an area's animal husbandry.

From one perspective, sooner or later the Senate would leave Hainan Island. The industrial faction and their beloved machine factories would all be gone, but the Imperial Veterinarian's breeding farms would still have to stay here, because Hainan Island itself was a natural isolation zone—even if its natural conditions couldn't compare to uniquely advantaged places like Hokkaido or New Zealand.

Kong Lingyang explained: "Currently the scale here isn't large, mainly undertaking breeding dog reproduction tasks. Outside influences here are relatively small, so canine distemper doesn't easily break out. Once we have enough dog handlers, we'll move the dog farm in Lingao here too—in fact, Lingao's horse farm should also move in the future."

They saw Burundi's meals: not only lamb but even eggs, which even Senators had rationed supplies of.

"That's quite a high food standard."

"Serving as breeding stock is very physically draining," Kong Lingyang said. "To breed strong, healthy offspring, nutrition for both parents must be sufficiently guaranteed."

Mu Min didn't speak during the tour—breeding farms always inspired obscene associations in male Senators: topics like "pushing the rear" were evergreen jokes. She always felt a bit awkward about this, even though police dogs were very useful for the police system she worked in.

After the dog farm tour, Kong Lingyang gave Mu Min an unexpected gift—a quality marbled cat. The dog breeding farm had an attached cat facility, breeding several quality cats as working cats. Lingao's chemical industry couldn't produce rat poison, so they could only rely on cats, this traditional biological control method.

Compared to dogs, cat resources were much more abundant. Kong Lingyang didn't dare give away dogs as personal favors to Senators, but cats were fine.

Mu Min, like all women, lacked immunity to "cute animals" like kittens and puppies. She was naturally happy to raise a cat—especially during night duty at the office, having a cat for company would make time pass faster. On D-Day, a female member had brought a cat that became the collective pet of the female Senators.

Previously, the Senate didn't allow Senators to privately keep cats and dogs—unless the cats and dogs had already received rabies vaccinations in the old dimension. Although every Senator had been vaccinated against rabies before D-Day, the vaccine's effective period was only one year. The Health Department had stored vaccines and some anti-rabies serum enough for all Senators to be vaccinated consecutively for three years, but quantities were limited and had expiration dates. Only recently had the biology lab manufactured vaccines using the most primitive Pasteur method and trial-produced anti-rabies serum using horse blood. After clinical trials proved roughly satisfactory did they preliminarily lift the ban.

The gifts for Wei Aiwen and Fang Jinghan were his self-brewed "secret three-whip wine." As for which three whips, he kept it secret. Allegedly it was his ancestral secret formula—besides the three whips, more than a dozen Chinese medicinal herbs were added, steeped in top-quality high-proof baijiu obtained from Guangzhou. After coming to Changhua, he had steeped more than ten jars; besides personal use, he often used it for hospitality purposes. For any male Senator coming here on business trips, Kong Lingyang would gift a bottle of secret three-whip wine. For a time, South Sea Farm's limited-edition cigars and Changhua Pasture's secret three-whip wine became fashionable trends among male Senators. Ever since male Senators had life secretaries, although they all claimed "three minutes max, can't do more," privately they were indeed parched land meeting sweet rain, inevitably somewhat overindulgent. Combined with daytime work exhaustion, a powerful demand for tonics emerged, and three-whip wine was just right.

Seeing the visitors from the center looking pleased without earlier arguments, Kong Lingyang spoke of his grand ambitions, especially about Changhua's animal husbandry—aside from Mu Min having little interest, male Senators like Wei Aiwen and Fang Jinghan all considered horse-raising as the Senate's top priority. No matter how ignorant they were about horses, or even couldn't ride at all, everyone was full of feelings for horses. Like maids, cannons, and ironclads, it was one of the male Senators' G-spots.

Kong Lingyang wasn't picky about horses. Although from an animal husbandry background, during his studies he hadn't paid attention to horse breeding—in China, horse breeding wasn't a focus of agriculture and animal husbandry. Except for traditional pastoral areas, almost no breeders were interested in raising horses, and the market was also very small. So unlike Nick and others, he believed horses should first solve the existence problem—get usable horses from wherever possible and expand the population.

Even horse populations of poor quality could be used as mule mother or father stock. Domestic horse breeds weren't great, but there were quite a few quality donkeys. Large donkey breeds like Dezhou donkeys had average shoulder heights no less than ordinary Mongolian horses, even slightly superior. Mules were strong, tolerated coarse feed, and could work continuously for more than twenty years—far more economical than horses.

From a usage perspective, the Fubo Army and civilian use of large draft animals was mainly to solve traction for vehicles, artillery, and machinery, and transporting materials and equipment. In this regard, mules were more practical than horses, with lower rearing costs. The demand for riding horses wasn't very large; introducing and breeding riding horses wasn't an urgent priority.

Compared to Lingao, Changhua was more suitable as an animal husbandry base. However, the estuary area was too humid and hot in summer, unfavorable for mass livestock breeding. After this period of investigation, Kong Lingyang had his eye on Changhua Grand Ridge, more than 4 kilometers east of the Changhua River estuary. At over 400 meters elevation, dominated by tree and grassland vegetation, with a cool climate, it was a more suitable summer pasture. Kong Lingyang planned to begin preliminary planning and construction of Changhua Grand Ridge this autumn and winter, for initial use by next summer.

To expand the pasture's scale, manpower would inevitably need to increase—especially technical personnel. Whether animal husbandry or veterinary professionals, available naturalized citizen personnel were currently zero.

Besides Yang Baogui's quick grab of a few students as apprentices, Kong Lingyang to date didn't have many decent apprentices. He'd barely managed to get four apprentices, brought them to Changhua for intensive instruction, evening remedial classes, daytime internships. They roughly learned some basic veterinary knowledge and could handle simple tasks like livestock birthing and breeding. But in the long run, this batch's foundation was too weak; ultimately they could only accumulate experience to become "old technicians" level—hard to achieve great things.

He was now posted externally. Changhua County was a small county—conveniently, few matters but much authority, with more leisure time available. If there were enough students to teach, starting with one or two years of foundational courses combined with internships, learning by doing until they had a certain foundation, then rotating to Yang Baogui for clinical advanced classes. Then selecting the best talents from among them for further cultivation, ultimately becoming teachers in the veterinary department of the military supply university in Kong Lingyang's imagination.

To realize this grand goal, Kong Lingyang and Yang Baogui had been trying to reserve a few Class B diploma holders from Fangcaodi's students to study veterinary medicine. However, naturalized citizen Class B diploma holders were too few for too many competing needs; the animal husbandry and veterinary industry could never get a slot.

So while enthusiastically discussing long-term plans, he occasionally inserted a few complaints about lacking trainable students, conveying his intentions and seeking their sufficient support for his proposals at Senate meetings. After all, these several people before him had far more persuasive power at the Executive Committee than he did.
