# Chapter 1131 - Zhong Xiaoying

Zhong Lishi soon discovered she was a clever, deft-handed girl. Besides doing housework, she would always stand quietly to the side observing when he conducted experiments or research, occasionally lending a hand. Gradually, Dr. Zhong realized she had a talent for this kind of work and began teaching her some scientific knowledge and basic mathematics.

The learning and comprehension abilities the young woman displayed both surprised and delighted him. After much deliberation, Zhong Lishi decided to adopt her as his daughter, giving her the name Zhong Xiaoying.

Zhong Xiaoying could read and write, and her brush calligraphy was better than ninety percent of the Committee members. She also knew some rudimentary martial arts. Clearly, she wasn't from a poor family background. Dr. Zhong had specifically retrieved her "self-statement" from the refugee camp and learned she came from a minor official's family. Her grandfather had been a county magistrate; her father, third son in the family, had failed at his studies. After her grandfather died and the family divided its property, the household quickly declined, surviving only through the women's silk-reeling work. Then, a few years earlier, a sudden fire destroyed the family entirely. The surviving Zhong Xiaoying had nearly been sold to a brothel by unscrupulous relatives.

The Committee had not only saved her from the abyss but had given her a peaceful, stable life—especially this learned, refined Dr. Zhong, whom she admired greatly. After being adopted as his daughter, she treated Dr. Zhong with even greater respect. Not only did she pay her respects morning and evening, but after accidentally glimpsing several animated films from his collection, she'd started calling him "Honorable Father."

"Honorable Father, you've been busy all day. Please rest early," Zhong Xiaoying said, supporting his arm.

"What time is it now?"

"Reporting to Honorable Father, it is now ten-forty PM."

"Still early." Dr. Zhong yawned, considering whether to continue his work.

He thought of the newly-installed "Weight-Pendulum Type 2" on the test clock tower outside. He'd implemented a simple hourly chiming function on this large clock, though it was limited to striking once on the hour. In effect, it was similar to the factory whistles that blew at set times—still very primitive.

Even so, this represented Dr. Zhong's painstaking work. Over the past two-plus years, Zhong Lishi had spent most of his time striving to rebuild the clockmaking industry. This concerned not only the Committee and Executive Committee's trust in him, but also his own face and reputation.

*Those bastards at the Construction Corporation!* This was a phrase he often cursed inwardly these past two years. Those people knew perfectly well that proper clocks couldn't be produced anytime soon, yet they insisted on designing clock towers into every building. Supposedly this was to implement the Committee's spirit of "instilling modern concepts of time into every native's mind."

The problem was these clock towers had no clocks to install. So the towers became lofts with gaping empty mouths. To prevent wind and rain intrusion, the openings meant for clock faces had to be sealed with wooden boards and reed mats. These ugly, sealed holes seemed to silently accuse something at every moment. Dr. Zhong felt uncomfortable whenever he saw them.

Every time the Committee held a Standing Session, some clueless Committee member would invariably ask when the Customs House clock tower would finally chime—after all, the empty tower had already prompted much speculation among naturalized citizens and natives. Over time, Dr. Zhong's clock tower became a regular topic of discussion among Committee members.

At first, Dr. Zhong had felt like sitting on pins and needles. Later, he simply turned a deaf ear. As Science and Technology People's Commissar, he could communicate directly with the Executive Committee at expanded meetings. Besides, those who could secure seats at Executive Committee expanded meetings generally understood the nature of scientific research—that research projects never produced immediate results. Thus, they were generous with investment.

Under Zhong Lishi's personal management, the Planning Committee approved the construction of the Taibai Timekeeping Center. From its completion, Zhong Lishi moved into Taibai Mansion and began a semi-reclusive life. Apart from going to Bairencheng one day per week to handle Science and Technology People's Commissariat daily business and attending Central Administration and Executive Committee meetings, he rarely appeared in Bairencheng. Beyond important occasions like the New Year's gathering, he didn't participate in Committee members' social activities.

Seclusion allowed him to focus on his work. But he quickly discovered that tinkering with ready-made timepieces and actually designing clocks were completely different matters—especially when constrained by currently abysmal raw materials and manufacturing capabilities.

The Planning Committee authorized him to use various controlled materials, even "Category One controlled materials" brought from the old timeline that couldn't be produced in the short term. But Dr. Zhong was very clear that using these materials for clock manufacturing had no value—there was no sustainable production capability in this timeline. Just like the batch of mantel and grandfather clocks they'd manufactured using timepiece components they'd brought.

For simplicity of production, his first project was a pendulum clock—technically the least difficult. Primitive versions had already appeared in the sixteenth century. Such clocks were generally of the large, crude variety, with relatively low requirements for materials and manufacturing precision.

Even so, Zhong Lishi had headaches for quite a while designing the first prototype.

The most critical part of any timepiece was the regulator mechanism. The first thing to achieve in a pendulum regulator was the escapement mechanism. Simply described, the escapement was a "Y"-shaped device with two teeth that worked by oscillating back and forth, using its two teeth to alternately catch and release an escapement wheel (similar to a gear), making the wheel advance tooth by tooth with each movement. This was the escapement mechanism. The "Y"-shaped component was called the "pallet fork," and the two teeth that controlled the wheel were called "pallet jewels."

The first two components Zhong Lishi designed were the pallet fork and escapement wheel. These two simple parts left him thoroughly frustrated.

His first wooden test sample was the Number 1 test machine, which ignored other functions and only tested the escapement function. One person manually moved the pallet fork back and forth while another twisted the wheel, testing the movement relationship between pallet fork and wheel. Zhong Lishi initially placed the pallet fork below the wheel, since the pendulum was also below. But during actual testing, the moment he let go, the pallet fork disengaged. Bart, responsible for twisting the wheel, used too much force and bruised his elbow.

Bart's surname wasn't actually "Bart." His real name was Bateer—his father was a Mongol "barbarian soldier" who'd transferred to Guangdong with some military commander. Though Bateer was born on the steppe, he'd grown up by the Pearl River, becoming a Mongol who spoke fluent Cantonese. Despite speaking Cantonese and being raised on rice, he'd still grown quite robust. During the Second Anti-Encirclement Campaign, fifteen-year-old Bateer had fought as a Ming soldier and eventually became a prisoner of war. Then he became Bart.

Zhong Lishi couldn't single-handedly build clocks; he needed some naturalized citizens as a foundation. He decided to take on a few apprentices for personal training. One of them was Bart, for a simple reason: Zhong Lishi needed a robust apprentice—the naturalized apprentices sent by the Personnel Department were all weaklings unfit for heavy labor.

Bart's elbow was swollen for several days. To prevent this from happening again, Zhong Lishi redesigned the pallet fork to go on top of the wheel. In hindsight, his worries had been unnecessary—assembling the pendulum rod with the pallet fork eliminated this problem. This incident fully revealed his inadequate understanding of mechanical properties. For this, he made a special trip to the Grand Library to obtain books on mechanical processing of clock components.

Subsequently, he began building the Number 2 escapement test machine, intended to test the "impulse" function. "Impulse" referred to the pallet jewels' interaction with the escapement wheel teeth during disengagement—the inclined surfaces of the jewels and wheel teeth interacted, transferring the wheel's power to the pallet fork, which then transmitted this force to the pendulum, providing it with the energy to continue swinging. This test achieved 98% success. Zhong Lishi had Bart forcefully twist the wheel, and the moment he released the pallet fork, it sprang powerfully to the other side exactly as designed—striking and swelling his hand. That evening at dinner, the stunned Bart received two chicken drumsticks as a reward.

The Number 3 test device tested the complete pendulum regulator. Zhong Lishi had a ten-meter-high wooden platform built in the clock workshop, with a four-meter pendulum installed on top. The Number 2 test device was mounted on it, with a notch cut at the pallet fork's tail to engage a pin on the pendulum rod.
