# Chapter 1012 Nanyang-Style Rifle

As for "not reliable enough," some proposed equipping them with flintlocks—like the well-tested Brown Bess. But this proposal drew opposition from the Industrial Department and Planning Bureau. The Brown Bess's structure was completely different from the Minié rifle. Except for the stock, no parts were interchangeable—equivalent to opening a new production line. Moreover, ammunition wasn't interchangeable either. Consuming large amounts of extra resources and labor to arm a small force simply wasn't worth it.

Finally, Wang Luobin, attending a meeting in Lingao, proposed a new plan: produce "monkey-version Minié rifles." Specifically, use the existing Minié rifle structure, share most parts, but don't rifle the barrel.

Without rifling, the monkey-version's range and accuracy both dropped significantly. But it remained much better than this dimension's various matchlocks and arquebus. Even compared to mature flintlocks like the Brown Bess, it held certain advantages—while maintaining a generation gap with the regular army.

The monkey-version Minié rifle required no production line changes or special processing, simply omitting the rifling production step, saving labor and resources. When needed, replacing the barrel could restore it to "standard version"—greatly conserving labor and resources. Ammunition was also interchangeable.

Most importantly, mercury fulminate and percussion cap production technology was monopolized by the Senate. Even if weapons were lost, those obtaining them couldn't use them. This was much safer than flintlocks—flintlocks could easily be repaired and used, but Minié rifles without percussion caps were just iron fire pokers. To date, though hundreds of Minié rifles remained in "unrecovered" status, no force had been found able to use them.

This monkey-version concept was quickly implemented. The Japanese company received the first batch of "Nanyang-Style Rifles"—because in Security Army plans, future Security Army would mainly deploy to Southeast Asia. This batch wasn't all newly manufactured. Part came from Fubo Army worn-rifled rifles being repaired, reinstalled with smoothbore barrels and converted.

First, firearm training for Japanese corporals was conducted—the Nanyang-Style rifles received positive reviews the moment they entered training use. Almost all had matchlock experience, whether Japanese-made monkey-version Tanegashima guns or genuine Portuguese and British matchlocks—they had handled them all. Comparing shooting accuracy and firing speed, the Nanyang-Style rifle's enormous advantages astonished them.

After corporals and squad leaders mastered Nanyang-Style rifle shooting and maintenance essentials, the next morning Banzai Camp assembled on the training ground.

"Today you will be issued weapons. Double time, march!" After the education sergeant gave the order, each education squad ran in column to the armory under command.

Tables and rifle racks were already set up at the armory entrance. Everyone received a Nanyang-Style rifle and matching bayonet. Armory personnel managed numbered weapon issuance. Then each education squad organized weapon structure and maintenance instruction on the training ground.

Shikawa Hideji proclaimed loudly: "Every rifle is engraved with the Senate's emblem—the Morning Star—and therefore must not be treated carelessly. A soldier's awareness of cherishing his rifle reveals that soldier's mental state. Therefore, you must carefully maintain your weapons!"

He was emotionally peddling the lectures brought from the training class when suddenly a "clatter" sounded from the back of the formation. Everyone looked back—it was Yahei the recruit who had accidentally knocked over his newly issued rifle and was frantically trying to pick it up. Shikawa Hideji roared: "Get out!"

Yahei's face instantly turned pale.

"Bastard!" Before he finished speaking, slapping sounds filled the air. Shikawa Hideji roared: "Having someone like you means we're finished! Bastard! Everyone attention! Rough treatment of weapons means confinement, only one meal a day—understand? Idiot! When you stand guard tonight, you'll carry three rifles!"

Then he carefully introduced rifle and bayonet maintenance methods, including disassembly and assembly. Everyone began practicing.

The Minié rifle's structure was quite simple, but for people with no maintenance awareness, it still wasn't easy.

"Said it once—did you all remember?!" Shikawa roared at all soldiers. All military education was forced indoctrination, forcing soldiers to memorize through loud scolding.

Rifle shooting training continued for a week. Most Japanese mercenaries had matchlock shooting experience, so using Nanyang-Style rifles wasn't difficult. They even adapted much faster than Fubo Army recruits—the latter needed considerable effort just to overcome fear of firearms.

After forty consecutive dry-fire shots and twenty live-fire shots, troops transitioned to bayonet training. After eight weeks of training concluded, the Security Army Japanese Battalion's basic training was declared complete, and unit organization work proceeded.

Of the 370-plus Japanese mercenaries who originally contracted to fight for the Senate, they were ultimately organized into four Security Army companies—still 100-man establishments. But companies had no drummers or fifers, only standard-bearers and buglers. Company and platoon-level officers and company supply sergeants were temporarily filled by naturalized citizen soldiers transferred from regular forces. Following the principle of assigning lower ranks to higher positions, regular army sergeants served as platoon leaders, staff sergeants as company commanders—ranks unchanged but receiving corresponding position allowances.

Security Army organization and employment were decided based on discussions at the "Danzhou Symposium."

When the North Qiong pacification campaign was about to end, the motion to establish a dedicated Security Army had already emerged. To fully utilize the Security Army, General Staff convened the "Counter-Guerrilla Pacification Campaign Field Symposium" in Danzhou. Xue Ziliang introduced the methods, approaches, and lessons learned from counter-guerrilla operations conducted under his supervision in Danzhou.

A main experience summarized from the conference was: while mastering sufficient mobile forces to strike, effective control and management of strongpoints and residential points had to be ensured. In controlled territories, militia and National Army could be organized. In newly occupied areas not yet "indoctrinated," sufficient security forces were needed to control major residential points, intimidate local strongmen, ensure enemies couldn't obtain material and personnel replenishment from residential points, protect local administrative organs, and ensure smooth government orders.

Security Army organized for this purpose didn't need large establishments or combined arms—no dedicated logistics detachments or heavy fire support detachments. These would be guaranteed by regular forces. Even drill and tactical training could be greatly simplified—no overly complex formation changes or coordinated tactical training.

Combat training emphasized shooting, grenade throwing, close combat, fieldcraft, and riot control. Tactics focused on patrol and defensive operations.

Because the Security Army deployed and operated in dispersed fashion, the largest tactical unit was the company. Above company was the detachment as administrative and logistics supply unit, with variable numbers of subordinate companies—suitable for dispersed deployment and flexible configuration needs.

After Banzai Camp graduated, they were sent to Bopu's Naval Training Brigade for two weeks of voyage adaptation training and shipboard bayonet combat training, making final preparations for departure. As part of the Security Army advance party, Banzai Camp would be dispatched to Taiwan, then a portion sent to Jeju Island.

The Naval Training Camp was in Bopu. Its various facilities were almost entirely Naval People's Commissar Ming Qiu's work. Unlike the military history and equipment-savvy naval enthusiast crowd, Old Ming had genuinely worked his way up step by step from enlisted man in PLAN forces. He had his own unique insights on training and commanding troops.

"Critique!"

"At ease, please."

"Marine Company One's landing deployment was fast, but all equipment got soaked. How are you going to fight?!"

"Second Sailor Battalion's combat training is already half done, and people are still cutting the sail lines. Are you going to fight pirates with your bellies?!"

...

Serving under Commander Ming, getting scolded daily was mandatory. However, as an old naval man, being strict on the training field was just Ming Qiu's professional habit. After dismissal, he would immediately mingle with officers and soldiers alike. But as an old naval man, Ming Qiu was accustomed to submarine chasers, patrol boats, and fast attack craft—even dreaming of sharp bows splitting white waves. Operating sailing ships and forming battle lines was thoroughly inexperienced territory for him; he also hadn't figured out how to command this dimension's most powerful surface fleet.

Kill!

Ha!

Thrust!

Roar!

Five-minute break! You may use the latrine, don't wander far!

Yes, sir!

Dismissed!

Shikawa Hideji and seven or eight Japanese holding Nanyang-Style rifles with fixed bayonets walked to the shade to drink water. In the distance, they watched a group of Australians walking in strange formations, holding strange flags and bamboo poles, moving slowly, occasionally stopping to point or backtrack somewhere and walk again—completely incomprehensible to them.

Ming Qiu and his officers couldn't be bothered by the Japanese mercenaries' pointing in the distance, focusing on their own training.

Strictly speaking, this couldn't be called training. It was a tactical simulation method Admiral Ming had invented—similar to old-dimension pilots on the ground using model planes to demonstrate various flight maneuvers. Only now each captain led a few subordinates standing in a row simulating a ship. The 901s and 854 Modified were the Senate's treasures. The Senate and Executive Committee harbored certain wariness toward pirate-origin naval personnel, so when appointing the first batch of shipboard key position commanders, they first emphasized "reliability." This meant these "capital ships'" officer corps' ship-handling and tactical abilities actually lagged behind.

To compensate for this shortcoming, training had to be strengthened. Training time left for them was minimal. They would soon go to sea on missions. Targeted navigation training could only be done while sailing. Tactical training had to start in advance.
