# Chapter 821 - The Whereabouts of the Female Temp

CLANG. The door to Room 39 opened. There weren't many people here to begin with; only seven or eight lived in a room meant for forty. The sound of the door opening and closing was particularly loud. At the sound, everyone in Room 39 looked up.

Room 39 was a barracks in the Quarantine Camp. It was unique: the entire Quarantine Camp was surrounded by barbed wire, bamboo fences, and trenches, but Room 39 was further isolated by a separate bamboo fence inside. Room 39 and the adjacent Room 40 were "Special Barracks," specifically for quarantining outsiders on the "Special List"—the inmates were a motley crew: suspicious characters suspected of being spies, monks and Taoists who had crossed the sea, people kidnapped from the mainland... They shared a collective title: "Key Quarantine Personnel Pending Review." After their 40-day quarantine, they would be transferred directly to specialized departments. Most went to the Political Security Bureau; others to the Religious Affairs Office, Police Headquarters, or External Intelligence Bureau. Detention locations would also shift to the Lingao County Prison or the PSB's "Study Class."

Room 39 was the female barracks, with far fewer people than the male barracks in Room 40 next door. The seven or eight women, of varying ages and appearances, all looked toward the door.

"Li Yongxun, come out." The person at the door was a middle-aged woman.

"Where is this?" Li Yongxun walked to the door. The sunlight outside was dazzling. She stumbled a few steps before steadying herself. She had been knocked unconscious in Macau and woke up on a ship. No matter how she shouted or cried in the cabin, no one answered, only a young girl brought her meals twice a day.

Li Yongxun guess she had been captured by the Aussies. Amidst her fear, to clarify her situation quickly, she used her ultimate weapon: hunger strike.

She didn't touch the dry rations and water delivered in the morning.

"Tell your big boss to come see me and explain clearly! Or this lady won't eat a thing!" Li Yongxun said righteously, tossing the tray with two hard, pale biscuits and a cup of water out.

The girl who brought food picked it up wordlessly and left. Li Yongxun waited eagerly, but not a single person came for the entire day.

She had overestimated her resolve. Previously, she had only skipped meals, but snacks were everywhere. Skipping meals for a few days didn't mean hunger. So refusing meals was a piece of cake for Li Yongxun.

But the ship had no snacks, nor wet nurses or maids to sneak her food. Li Yongxun couldn't last a day. In the evening, the girl brought dinner.

"I won't eat!" Li Yongxun summoned her last courage and pride to shout. "Take it away! No, leave the water!" Hunger was one thing, but thirst was unbearable.

The girl obediently left the water, took the food tray, and turned to leave.

"Wait!" Li Yongxun stopped her. "Tell the Aussies! I'm not a commoner! My father is a Nanjing Brocade Clad Guard—" She thought her father was just a General Banner; without the Brocade Clad Guard title, he'd be smaller than a sesame seed. It probably wasn't scary enough, so she changed it: "...Company Commander [Baihu]!"

Clearly, "My dad is a Brocade Clad Guard Company Commander" didn't work. Li Yongxun was dizzy with hunger. When breakfast arrived the next day, her hunger strike was canceled.

"Where are you taking me?" Li Yongxun asked pitifully while gnawing on hard Grassland No. 5 rations.

"You'll know when we get there." The girl said just that one sentence.

"Stop asking. You'll know what you should know." The female guard responded to her questions with the same words—Li Yongxun shuddered. The other's expression wasn't severe, even showing a trace of sympathy for a young girl, but the tone was cold.

Li Yongxun sighed helplessly. She knew this was Lingao—seeing those strange machines and the big iron ship upon disembarking confirmed she was in Aussie hands.

But why capture her? Clearly, the person in the sedan chair was Censor Gao. It seemed her deductions were all correct! Li Yongxun was excited and proud. she forgot she went to Macau out of curiosity; finding clues about Censor Gao was accidental—now it all became her brilliant deduction.

However, her pride didn't last long. She was sent to the Quarantine Camp. After suffering the "humiliation" of a physical exam and collective shower/disinfection, she was locked in this large room filled with bunk beds, living a dull life of two seafood porridge meals a day. No one questioned her. No matter what she asked, the women guarding the place never uttered a useful word. The other women in Room 39 knew nothing—like her, they were sent here immediately upon landing.

Outside the barracks stood three Short-haired Thieves wearing neat front-buttoned short jackets, leather belts at the waist, and a strap across the chest. Their shoulders had blue cloth strips with strange patterns. Small blue patches were on their collars. Leading them was the girl who brought her food on the ship. She wore the same clothes as the male thieves, but with a dark blue pleated skirt—Li Yongxun stared wide-eyed: the skirt didn't cover the instep but ended at the knees, revealing white cotton socks wrapping her calves tightly.

"Shameless," Li Yongxun muttered. Even so, she felt a hint of envy. The woman before her clearly held an official position among the thieves, much better than her, a fake using someone else's badge to bluff.

"Key Quarantine Personnel Pending Review, one Li Yongxun!" The female guard handed a paper folder to Ke Yun. Ke Yun opened it, checked the bamboo tag around her neck.

"Identity confirmed!" Ke Yun said, signing the transfer form. "Take her away!"

"Where are you taking me?" Li Yongxun asked loudly. No one answered. A thief pulled out a black hood and put it over her head. Darkness and suffocation instantly injected immense fear into her heart. She felt someone push her, and she was marched away.

Huge fear enveloped her. Growing up around the Ming's violent institutions, Li Yongxun knew the fate of those falling into their hands—guilty or not, royal or noble, without high-level intervention, even a god would lose a layer of skin. For female prisoners, it was even more terrifying: repeated humiliation and rape. She had interrogated female prisoners herself—she knew the horror. Thinking of the terrible things about to befall her, a strong urge to urinate rose uncontrollably from her lower abdomen.

Originally she thought the Aussies wouldn't dare touch her, but what she saw in Lingao made it clear—Lingao was "like an enemy state," not Ming territory at all. Her fake Brocade Clad Guard identity probably wouldn't work—not only wouldn't work, she might be treated as a spy, "tortured," or killed outright.

Li Yongxun was put on a two-wheeled Dongfeng carriage. After a ten-minute ride, she was taken into a building belonging to the Political Security Bureau. Here she was briefly interrogated. Name, age, family background, etc. Her relationship with Lin Ming was also questioned. Li Yongxun told everything. Including how she found traces of Censor Gao in Macau. She dared not hide anything. Although the room was clean with only a table and chairs, a torture chamber might be next door. A wise woman doesn't fight the odds.

After the interrogation, Zhou Dongtian, in charge of questioning, ordered Li Yongxun detained in the PSB Study Class first. Then he transferred the file to the External Intelligence Bureau—they caught her, so Jiang Shan and Li Yan should decide how to handle her.

"Not much juice," Zhou Dongtian said. "An ordinary girl. Found Censor Gao purely by accident."

"She's not Brocade Clad Guard?" Li Yan asked.

Zhou Dongtian smiled: "Let's call her a temporary worker. After all, her cousin-in-law got her someone else's badge to bluff with. Use of non-staff temps by yamen has happened throughout history."

"The Brocade Clad Guards haven't targeted us?"

"Maybe they have," Zhou Dongtian said. "But my personal feeling is that at least local Guards aren't efficient. According to Li Yongxun: the Trial Company Commander investigating Censor Gao's disappearance followed to Macau purely by chance."

"You believe her?" Li Yan wasn't reassured. "Not show her some NIGHT24 or spider videos?" Showing SM videos to interrogatees was an effective method for the Transmigration Group's dictatorship organs. The imagination of the 21st-century sex/entertainment industry was infinite.

"Unnecessary," Zhou Dongtian said indifferently. "If she can deceive me with body language, she's the spy master of this timeline."

"Fine." Li Yan picked up Li Yongxun's file. "What do we do with her?"

"If she's ugly, snap her neck." Zhou Dongtian said. "Or send her to Fu Youdi as labor. But I see you guys seem reluctant." He smiled mysteriously.

"Nothing of the sort," Li Yan quickly denied. "She's still a dangerous element."

"Dangerous? Definitely not." Zhou Dongtian shook his head. "Just an ordinary girl who loves showing off and has too much curiosity—like 21st-century girls. But here, she has no choice—some things aren't for playing."
