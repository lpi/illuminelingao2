# Chapter 1139 - Voyage to Taiwan

The officer of the watch didn't stop them, and they boarded the deck smoothly. On deck, sailors were at their stations; gun covers had been removed, though ammunition wasn't yet loaded. From the deck, one could see the entire convoy's ships sailing through the waves. Agile two-masted patrol boats used the wind to shuttle rapidly through the fleet.

Although the convoy wasn't large, it was enough to excite Dr. Zhong, witnessing the majestic maritime posture of the Committee's naval formation for the first time. He held the bulwark, greedily watching everything on the sea surface.

What he didn't know was that these two-masted patrol boats were no longer the ones that had departed from Lingao. A few days ago, in the waters east of Hong Kong, the escort team sent by the Lingao Coast Guard had left the formation to return. The patrol boats escorting now belonged to the Navy's First Fleet.

Liu Zheng and Fang Jinghan weren't interested in this anymore. They dragged Dr. Zhong up to the poop deck, where the captain was observing with a telescope.

Since this ship was assigned to the Remote Exploration Team, Liu Zheng and the captain were familiar. The captain was named Chen Song, a white-bearded old man. he was an old pilot who had sailed for many years, visited the Nanyang over a dozen times, and been to Taiwan, Siam, Japan, and other places. He'd sailed for merchants and done "business without capital." Familiar with maritime conditions, he had originally retired to the Guangzhou countryside. After the Australians shelled Guangzhou, seeing the maritime heroes who defected to the Australians all doing well, and feeling his family fortune was too thin despite some savings—plus having few capable descendants—he returned to his old trade, bringing his whole family to Lingao to join the Australians. Before long, familiar with sea conditions, he became a captain. Due to his advanced age making him unsuitable for line service, the Navy placed him in the reserves as captain of the "Spanish Whore."

Though over sixty, the old man was exceptionally hale and hearty. Seeing Liu Zheng and the others, he greeted them with his thunderous voice: "How's my ship? Serving you gentlemen comfortably, eh?"

"It'll do. Just like you, a bit old..."

"Old is good; reduces internal heat." The old man squinted and chuckled. He wore a sloppy Navy uniform with Reserve Navy Lieutenant rank insignia. The uniform was worn properly enough, except the top two buttons were undone, exposing his chest and the homespun undershirt beneath—he wasn't wearing the regulation Navy shirt.

"What, enemy situation?"

"No," Chen Song lowered the telescope. "We'll soon reach Takau. This is the most dangerous part of the route. If Zheng Zhilong or the Redhair ghosts want to intercept us, this is the most likely leg of the voyage."

This area was a choke point for routes to Tayouan, Bengang, and Kaohsiung. For the past half year, Committee convoys had shuttled constantly. If the enemy intended to intercept, this leg was the most suitable location.

For this reason, every convoy batch raised its alert status when sailing here.

Knowing it was just routine procedure, Dr. Zhong's slightly panicked mood settled instantly. He felt his steel helmet was very conspicuous, and the scorching sun quickly made it burning hot. He hurriedly took it off quietly.

To cover his embarrassment, he asked, "Have Zheng Zhilong and the Dutch made any moves?"

"I've run this route several times in the last six months. Indeed, occasionally a few ships approach. But no moves." Chen Song said nonchalantly. "They'd have to dare. Never mind the Dutch—their ships are small but look decent. Zheng Zhilong’s few ships are ragged and broken; one shot and they'd probably fall apart."

Benefits of silence. Clearly neither Zheng Zhilong nor the Dutch wanted to show hostile attitudes. When scouting, they used old or small ships, obviously intending to avoid accidental conflict.

Dr. Zhong took the opportunity to ask about the effectiveness of current maritime position testing.

Due to delays in marine chronometer development, current maritime formations mainly adopted the leader-ship navigation mode. A ship equipped with an old timeline quartz watch served as leader, with the flagship also equipping a timepiece as backup.

For more important ships, the captain was directly issued a mechanical watch brought from the old timeline, but this was limited to very few ships.

But this method wasn't reliable. Mechanical watches could stop. Leader ships might be separated or sunk in storms. Therefore, for most ships under Committee command, longitude was determined using the "Lunar Distance Method."

Simply put, it used a sextant to observe the distance between the moon and sun to determine the ship's longitude.

In 1514, German astronomer Johann Werner discovered through observation that the moon's relative position in the sky changed constantly, moving about one moon diameter per hour. He assumed the moon's behavior observed on Earth was identical everywhere. By observing the moon from two places and accurately recording the time it moved to a certain position, one could calculate the longitude difference between the two places.

But this "Lunar Distance Method" required an accurate and complete star catalog. In the old timeline, astronomers spent decades observing and charting this. However, for the Committee Technology Ministry standing on giants' shoulders, this wasn't a problem. With existing astronomical data, computers, and astronomy software, Dr. Zhong easily produced precise star catalogs for northern and southern hemispheres, then calculated "Lunar Distance Tables" for each year starting from 1631. Thus, the Technology Ministry published the *Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris* in 1632, listing the relationship between lunar distance and longitude for the entire year, accompanied by a dedicated slide rule. Sailors using the slide rule and almanac could calculate longitude within 20 minutes. The accuracy was also within acceptable range.

However, Chen Song had complaints about this method—because the Lunar Distance Method required considerable mathematical calculation ability. Although Dr. Zhong had released dedicated slide rules and number tables greatly simplifying calculation difficulty, for most captains of illiterate background, it was still a bit hard. Fortunately, most ships currently sailed traditional routes with little need for precise longitude calculation. They managed to muddle through. Ships going to Taiwan and Jeju Island were all equipped with naval cadets acting as navigators responsible for calculation piloting.

While Captain Chen was complaining, a signalman reported a signal from the flagship: an "unidentified vessel" was sailing three nautical miles from the formation, and escort patrol boats were already going to inspect.

Zhong Lishi picked up his Russian binoculars and looked in the direction the captain pointed. Sure enough, a solitary large Fujian junk was on the sea, with nearby two-masted patrol boats rapidly closing on the target.

The other side clearly had no intention of resisting and quickly lowered sails. Marines from the patrol boat boarded the Fujian junk and began inspecting the entire vessel.

The sailors on board were dressed as Ming commoners, speaking with authentic southern Fujian accents. The Marine sergeant sized up the boat owner who came out to greet them; they all looked like Ming people.

After questioning, they learned this was a Fujian junk traveling from Quanzhou to Tayouan, carrying Fujian indigo and sugar, plus over two hundred Fujian migrants—to gain labor and increase tax revenue, the Dutch offered good rewards to ship owners transporting migrants.

Inspection proved the boat boss hadn't lied. Besides trade goods and migrants, the ship carried some general merchandise. Though there were a few native cannons and gunpowder/lead shot for self-defense, there were no anomalies. Thus, the patrol boat let them leave after inspection.

The bowing and scraping boat boss watched the patrol sailboat skim over the waves to quickly catch up with the distant fleet, a glint appearing in his eyes.

The "Spanish Whore," pulled by a tugboat, slowly entered Kaohsiung Harbor—the name Takau was a bit too "vulgar," so the Central Administration had ordered it changed to the original timeline's name: Kaohsiung.

For this bridgehead in Taiwan, the Committee Standing Committee had originally suggested establishing a "Taiwan Prefecture" or "Taiwan Province" in Kaohsiung during meetings. But the Central Administration believed that currently control over Taiwan was limited to Kaohsiung alone. All of Tainan wasn't yet unified. Establishing a "Prefecture" or "Province" directly was premature.

The final decision was to establish only a "City" in Kaohsiung. This city's "Mayor" was a Committee member named Wei Bachi.

At this moment, he was sitting under the Customs House eaves at the pier, preparing to welcome the Committee members' arrival.
