# Chapter 962 - Summer Tax (Part 2)

"You're dreaming!" Just as several people were happily discussing, a man whose clothes were of fine style and quality but covered with several patches sauntered over. One patch nearly covered a third of his wide, long sleeve. "Nothing in the world comes that cheap!"

This patch-covered "gentleman" was known to all as Master Na. His ancestors had once been a household of considerable property. By his generation, a dispute over tax levies had led to a lawsuit engineered by a powerful family, and the household had fallen—leaving him a penniless "man of genteel status." When the family had money in earlier years, they had also obtained a "jiansheng" degree. Though this had later been revoked due to the lawsuit, everyone knew he had been wronged, so they still addressed him as "Master."

Master Na was a decent person who loved championing justice, and he had a modest local reputation. Hearing him speak, everyone pressed him to share his views on this "Great Song summer tax."

"Since when has there been no imperial grain to pay?" Master Na had read the proclamation seven or eight times. He understood the concept of "apportioning corvée into land"—it was similar to the Single Whip Reform that Grand Secretary Zhang had implemented before, except the Single Whip only consolidated miscellaneous taxes; it wasn't based on the concept of paying taxes according to land quantity. Though Master Na was poor, he had read quite a few miscellaneous books. He quickly realized the greatest benefit of apportioning corvée into land: it would make the population crystal clear. Since corvée silver was apportioned by land acreage, households would have no reason to conceal their true population numbers.

The Great Ming's total registered household population had been constantly declining ever since the Yongle reign—a highly abnormal phenomenon. After Yongle, the Great Ming was roughly "stable"; by low standards, it could be called a "prosperous age." Yet in this prosperous age, the population wasn't increasing but declining massively, clearly due to large numbers of fugitives and "black households."

Qiongzhou Prefecture also had many unregistered "black households" and fugitives who had fled from the mainland. With this move, the Australians' purpose was probably to further clarify how many people Qiongzhou Prefecture actually had.

Connecting this to Lingao's large-scale "population census," Master Na suddenly felt he understood the Australians' scheming.

"This isn't the Great Song's summer tax at all," Master Na began pedantically, first discoursing on various historical records about Song dynasty tax systems to prove that "the Great Song never had apportioning corvée into land." Seeing the impatient expressions on the surrounding peasants' faces, he couldn't help but sigh to himself: "Casting pearls before swine!"

So he brought the discussion back on track: "...Anyway, this isn't a Great Song system—it's a new trick the out— the Australians concocted themselves!"

A young man asked: "Master Na, whether it's a Great Song trick or an Australian trick, us country folk can't tell. Just tell us—is the summer tax payment method really as the proclamation says? Those with more land pay more, those with less pay less, and those under twenty *mu* don't pay at all?"

"That's indeed what the proclamation says." Master Na waved a worn-out fan. "But since the first day there was a dynasty, paying grain and serving corvée has been the natural order of things—how can it just disappear? Saying those with little land can pay less or nothing—I think that's just talk." He was fundamentally dissatisfied with the government and, by extension, dissatisfied with all governments. In his view, whether it was the Great Ming, Great Song, or some strange Australian place, they were all cut from the same cloth. How could those in power enjoy silk and satin, with honored wives and sons, if they didn't exploit the common people?

An old man spoke up: "Master Na! I've heard the Australians have always been true to their word—once they say something, they honor it..."

Master Na snorted: "Since ancient times, there's never been a trustworthy official. Take the former Magistrate Wang—when visiting the prefectural academy, he spoke beautifully of 'heavenly principle and human conscience.' But when it came to himself, he couldn't suppress his desires—not only did he amass a fortune, he found all sorts of ways to acquire women. Even the emperor's words they can twist and evade..."

The old man looked around fearfully and hurriedly called out: "Master Na! Master Na!"

"Don't worry!" Master Na looked utterly unconcerned. "The Australians have no time to bother with a poor wretch like me! What they want is to dig silver from the big households' pockets—that's what matters. The common people have all been through disaster—where would they get grain and money?"

Master Na's insight was shared by the local major landowners as well. Apportioning corvée into land, progressive taxation—all signs pointed to the Australians preparing to "eat the big households." The major landowners grew nervous. After some coordination, the fierce backlash Liu Xiang had expected didn't materialize. Instead, a group of major landowners who had specifically dressed in tattered clothing came collectively to the county office to "petition," each weeping and wailing about how much harvest they had lost this year and how they simply couldn't pay the summer tax, and so forth. Liu Xiang smiled amiably and deflected with small talk, but kept his jaw firmly clenched and refused to budge.

Disappointed, they went to consult Hai Shuzu. Hai Shuzu himself was under little pressure—he had "fully contracted" all his land to the Tiandihui, and even taxes were the Tiandihui's responsibility. He wasn't very concerned about paying taxes. But pressed by everyone's expectations, he had to make another visit.

"Old Hai!" Liu Xiang said warmly. "I know why you're here!" Then he added: "Settle yourself more firmly in that chair—don't be so stiff!"

"Propriety demands it—I dare not be presumptuous." Hai Shuzu shifted slightly to show he respected the superior official's command, but remained seated very correctly. Truthfully, he didn't much like the "Chiefs'" habit of calling people "Old X" or "Little X." Though he knew this was meant to show familiarity, it didn't sit well on him.

"You're here because those landlords sent you to plead poverty and ask for tax reductions, correct?"

"That is so, Chief." Hai Shuzu nodded. "This humble scholar is merely fulfilling an entrusted task." Feeling this answer was somewhat inappropriate, he hastily added: "Though each household has considerable land, not all are wealthy. After the wind and water disasters, life is not easy. Please take note, Chief."

Liu Xiang nodded: "Of course. However, the majority are probably 'wealthy,' aren't they? Besides, though life isn't easy, no one has reached the point of going hungry and having to sell children, daughters, or wives." He stood and paced a few steps. "It's the common people whose lives truly cannot continue..."

Hai Shuzu said: "Yes. What the Chief says is true. However, since ancient times, landowners and scholars have been the foundation of the dynasty. Please preserve their dignity, Chief." He paused to think. "Please consider this carefully, Chief." He hesitated, then continued: "Now that the Chiefs' situation is newly established, 'stability' should be the priority. The allegiance of gentry and scholars cannot be disregarded..."

Liu Xiang thought these major landowners had quite the sense of superiority. If Qiongshan weren't so poor and lacking in literary tradition, the backlash would probably be much fiercer. But the latter part of his statement clearly indicated that Hai Shuzu had already considered himself part of the "new dynasty" and was being this candid as a result.

Liu Xiang waited for him to finish before saying: "Old Hai, since you trust us so much, let me be more direct. What we need right now is grain. The common people didn't have much to begin with, and now with the disaster, they certainly can't produce any. Am I right? To find grain, only the major landowners have any."

Hai Shuzu nodded.

"If I wanted to do this simply and effortlessly, I could invite all the major landowners here, then have each household produce several hundred or thousand *shi*. Anyone who won't produce gets dragged out and beheaded. Could I get the grain that way?"

Hai Shuzu smiled bitterly: "That would be the conduct of bandits, not becoming of gentlemen. The Chiefs all have great ambitions..."

Liu Xiang said: "Let's say you're right—that approach is too much like bandits. I have something here that isn't bandit-like." He pointed to a pile of ledgers on the desk. "This is the list and amounts of Qiongshan County's tax arrears over the years." He smiled. "I didn't expect that those who owe the most taxes aren't the common people, but rather the dynasty's 'foundation.'"

Hai Shuzu's face reddened; he didn't know what to say.

"I'll just use these ledgers to talk. I'll have these tax-delinquent major landowners pay up all their arrears plus years of accumulated interest. Even the Great Ming's emperor couldn't say I'm doing anything wrong, could he? Should they pay or shouldn't they?"

"They should." Hai Shuzu hadn't expected Director Liu to have this card to play. Gentry and major landowners defaulting on taxes was a common practice everywhere in the Great Ming—nothing unusual. In the Jiangnan region, there were even landowners who hadn't paid for decades. The court had never expected to collect all these back taxes.

Hai Shuzu returned empty-handed. Liu Xiang wouldn't budge an inch on the summer tax. Though the major landowners privately cursed him viciously, swords were harder than lips. Besides, the pacification campaign and land survey had already taught them enough lessons—they knew it was best not to try opposing the Australians.

As the tax collectors Chen Ce had trained came on station, the first batch of tax notices began to be delivered by special messengers.

There were two types of notices. The first was a public announcement, organized by "du" and posted widely at markets and villages within each du. Listed by household head, each household's actual landholding, conversion to "standard *mu*," applicable tier, amount owed, exemptions, and conditions for exemption were all itemized on the notice—this was the "public disclosure." Those with objections could file appeals at the tax bureau.

The second type was called the "influential household" notice. These were hand-delivered by special messengers to landowners with over five hundred *mu*. Since they were wealthy and major taxpayers, they received specially delivered notices. The content was identical to the public announcements, but each influential household notice required a receipt with the recipient's seal and signature.

Liu Xiang stipulated: notices that remained undeliverable for over 45 days because no one would sign for them meant the household was deemed not to be an "influential household," and all registered land would be confiscated. Under this forceful rule, the delivery rate for influential household notices reached one hundred percent before half a month had passed.

*Note: "Influential household" was a term from the Song dynasty tax system.*
