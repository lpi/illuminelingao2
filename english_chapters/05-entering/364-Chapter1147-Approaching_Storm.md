# Chapter 1147 - Approaching Storm

Weather in the Taiwan Strait was always unpredictable.

In the weather station of Kaohsiung Port, the barometer reading was dropping continuously. The meteorologist looked at the curve on the recording paper with a grim expression.

"Typhoon is coming," he muttered.

Wei Bachi received the warning very quickly. He immediately ordered the activation of the emergency plan.

"Notify all construction sites to stop work immediately and secure equipment!"
"Ships in port must reinforce moorings or go to safe anchorage to shelter!"
"Refugee camps must reinforce housing; evacuate people from low-lying areas!"

Orders were transmitted rapidly via telephone and runners. The entire Kaohsiung City began to operate like a precision machine.

At the Customs Clock Tower, Zhong Lishi was also directing workers to secure the clock tower.

"Take down the scaffolding! Fast! The wind is coming!" Zhong Lishi shouted.

Westerly and Cleadia also helped nervously. They had never experienced a typhoon, but seeing everyone's nervous expressions, they knew something big was happening.

"Go back to your room! Don't come out!" Zhong Lishi ordered the two children. "Close the window shutters tight!"

"Yes, Dr. Zhong!" Westerly pulled his sister and ran towards the dormitory.

Dark clouds rolled in, covering the sky. The wind began to howl, kicking up dust and sand. The sea in the distance turned a terrifying dark gray, waves crashing violently against the breakwater.

Huygens stood by the window of the trading house, looking worriedly at the changing weather outside.

"Is this the 'typhoon' of the East?" he asked.

"Yes, Mr. Huygens," a servant replied. "Please step away from the window. The wind will be very strong later."

Soon, huge raindrops began to fall, hitting the roof with a crackling sound. The wind grew stronger, whistling like ghosts wailing.

In the refugee camp, people were huddled in the reinforced longhouses, trembling. The roar of the wind outside made them fear the roof might be lifted at any moment.

Wei Bachi sat in the command center at City Hall, listening to reports from various sectors.

"Section A of the breakwater is damaged by waves!"
"Roof of Warehouse No. 3 has been blown off!"
"Water accumulation in the refugee camp command center!"

"Don't panic! Handle according to the plan!" Wei Bachi commanded calmly. "Safety of personnel first!"

The power of nature was awe-inspiring. Even the "Australian" infrastructure appearing indestructible seemed fragile in the face of a typhoon.

But Wei Bachi wasn't worried. He knew typhoons were tests Kaohsiung had to face. As long as the core personnel and equipment were safe, losses could be rebuilt.

The storm raged all night.

By dawn the next day, the wind and rain gradually subsided. The sun emerged from the clouds again, shining on the mess left behind.

Wei Bachi walked out of City Hall to inspect the disaster situation.

Trees on the roadside were uprooted or snapped. Billboards and bamboo sheds were blown to pieces. Many roofs in the residential area had holes.

But the main buildings remained intact. The City Hall, Customs House, and trading house stood tall.

"Report losses immediately!" Wei Bachi ordered.

Zhong Lishi also came out of the Customs House. He first checked the clock tower—fortunately, apart from some scaffolding being blown down, the main structure and the clock itself were undamaged.

"Thank God," he breathed a sigh of relief.

Then he thought of the two Dutch children. He hurried to their room.

Westerly and Cleadia were huddled in a corner of the room, looking pale. The terrifying sound of the storm last night had kept them awake all night.

"Are you okay?" Zhong Lishi asked with concern.

"We... we're fine," Westerly said, voice trembling. "Just... never seen such a terrifying storm."

"It's over now." Zhong Lishi patted his shoulder. "You are safe."

Cleadia looked at the mess outside the window. "Is the city... destroyed?"

"No, just some skin trauma," Zhong Lishi smiled confidently. "We will repair it very quickly."

Indeed, recovery work began immediately. Under Wei Bachi's organization, soldiers, workers, and refugees were all mobilized to clear debris, repair houses, and drain water.

Steam cranes roared again, lifting fallen trees and beams.

Huygens witnessed this efficient disaster relief scene. He was shocked again. In Europe, such a disaster would leave a city paralyzed for weeks or even months. But here, everything was returning to order rapidly.

"Their organization capability is terrifying," Huygens wrote in his diary.

In Anping, Li Siya also experienced this typhoon. The Zheng family's fleet suffered some losses in the storm, keeping Zheng Zhilong busy with damage control, temporarily ignoring her proposals.

Li Siya looked at the calm sea after the storm, calculating her next move. The typhoon bought the Australians time but also exposed some weaknesses.

She decided to go to Kaohsiung personally to see the post-disaster situation. Maybe in the chaos, she could find opportunities to infiltrate.
