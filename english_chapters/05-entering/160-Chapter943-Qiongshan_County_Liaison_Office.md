# Chapter 943 – Qiongshan County Liaison Office

The Senate Qiongshan County Liaison Office—this was the official internal designation. On the door of the usurped Provincial Administration Sub-Commissioner's yamen hung the official external designation: Qiongshan County Post-Disaster Consultative Bureau.

The Provincial Administration Sub-Commissioner's office was one of the few imposing government buildings in Qiongzhou Prefecture. Not only were the buildings well-organized, but the compound was spacious—more than enough to accommodate the new Qiongshan County leadership team.

Qiongshan County's leadership team was organized according to the "Government Organization Methods" formulated by the Central Administrative Council. Unlike other newly occupied prefectures and counties, Qiongshan was the best on all of Hainan in terms of population, commerce, and transportation. As a new-model county-level government structure, the Central Administrative Council intended to use Qiongshan County as a pilot project.

Because Lingao was an "old revolutionary base," it had long operated as an integrated whole with local and central sharing of manpower and material resources. Many things in construction and local administration were handled directly by transmigrators. This model was difficult to sustain long-term. Fresh administrative experience from Qiongshan County had direct significance for the Executive Committee as its territory continued to expand. Moreover, the Executive Committee hoped Qiongshan County would become a training ground for new local administrative cadres. A few transmigrators leading many naturalized citizen cadres to handle local administration—this was to be the main administrative model during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

In a small courtyard within the Qiongshan County Liaison Office, its gate guarded by sentries, in the main room, a laptop suddenly began beeping an alarm, and a notification box popped up, covering the entire screen.

A hand clicked "OK" on the mouse. Liu Xiang closed the notification box—it was almost time for the regular meeting. This was a simple scheduling program he had written himself to keep from missing appointments.

He quickly reviewed the final part of a document translation and saved it to a USB drive. In a moment, he'd have his secretary take the drive to the Classified Section to be sent back to the Grand Library via the transmigrator-exclusive transport channel.

Ever since someone had issued a warning to the Executive Committee and Senate about data security—according to the average lifespan of electronic products, if they didn't start backing up data now, by the time the first batch of storage devices suffered irreparable failures, they would lose massive amounts of data irretrievably—the transmigrators finally felt a sense of urgency and began the work of printing documentation and translating it into Chinese. Initially, everyone naturally assigned translation work to those whose specialty was "English." But once work began, they quickly complained: they could translate every word, but when professional terminology was involved, if they didn't understand what the term roughly meant, they couldn't connect the long strings of modifiers before and after, and the grammatical structure fell apart. Under these circumstances, the Grand Library had to use a combination of coercion and incentive to assign translation tasks to transmigrators with both professional expertise and good English skills.

Liu Xiang had been a PhD student at a famous science and engineering university in the old timeline, trained by reading three English papers a day. Doing translations in computing, mathematics, cryptography, and such was easy for him. What he had just finished was a document on chaos algorithms. "Not many transmigrators can even do calculus by hand anymore, and the 500-plus of us will increasingly be doing administrative work. These skills will inevitably atrophy." Liu Xiang was stuffing the USB drive into a transmigrator-exclusive envelope while thinking: "Surely we won't have to start research from the Lagrange mean value theorem when we open universities later."

Seeing Liu Xiang shut off the computer, the secretary who had been pedaling the power-generating bicycle got off and came over, wiping sweat with a towel. Guo Ling'er was a refugee from the mainland. Unusually, she was a "fellow villager" of Liu Xiang's—from Hubei. The name assigned to her after purification was Guo Rong, but when she was brought before Liu Xiang as a maid, that name had given him a shock. Just as he was thinking of changing her name, the media player on his laptop happened to switch to music from *The Legend of Sword and Fairy*, and so came the name "Ling'er."

"Go take a bath first, then take this to the Classified Section." With that, Liu Xiang grabbed another laptop and headed for the conference room.

This laptop labeled "B" contained only Qiongzhou work-related material, such as "Qiongzhou Key Personnel Relationship and Data Topology Analysis Tool," "Qiongzhou Land Situation Query System," and so on. Compared to paper materials, he still preferred electronic things.

Today's regular meeting had three main items: first, all supervisors would return last week's task cards and give work summaries; second, relay the urgent instructions regarding refugee relief work that had come in early this morning; third, formulate work plans corresponding to these instructions, forming next week's work schedule, and assigning personal responsibility via task cards.

Liu Xiang had never actually done basic administrative work—he had only been a foreman for IT workers, a so-called project manager. He believed management methods should be universal; what worked to manage a development team could be transplanted to an administrative team.

The naturalized citizen team assigned to him was, by Lingao standards, "the best of the best." Two-thirds came from cadres in Lingao villages and communes where grassroots construction was fully completed, plus some discharged wounded soldiers and workers. One-third came from Qiongshan itself, including some military household personnel captured during the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign who were deemed "reformable." All had been trained to Certificate Level C and received corresponding administrative skills training. Finally, there was a small number of retained personnel from the original yamen.

He had piloted this method in the naturalized citizen cadre teams working on "Land Survey" and "County Situation Investigation" in Qiongzhou and achieved good results. Quite a few transmigrators found his administrative approach novel, jokingly calling it the "Qiongshan Experience." Some suggested the Administrative Council should promote it widely. But Liu Xiang himself knew this method really couldn't be widely promoted. To say nothing else, just this "personal responsibility" system—if not for the fact that Qiongzhou was still a training ground for intelligence department personnel, allowing him to fully utilize that system to supervise cadres assigned tasks, this approach's effectiveness definitely wouldn't be as good as it was now. After all, administrative work wasn't like writing code, where every unit of work had a solid deliverable to check.

If not for this sudden typhoon and rainstorm, his original plan was to begin advancing "bringing political power to the villages": on the basis of having basically understood county conditions over the past few months and generally establishing a liaison system in each village, begin cadre training work in all villages—in fact, the first batch of resident police recruited from Qiongshan's military household sons and daughters had already been sent to Lingao for training.

But now disaster relief had become the top priority. And this time, Liu Muzhou had also sent a special work team to preside over the relief effort—which puzzled him somewhat, because those who came included not only transmigrators from the civil affairs department, but also people from the Propaganda Department. Was the Propaganda Department going to do disaster relief publicity work?

"Let's begin." After Liu Xiang sat down, without further ado and without introducing the transmigrators specifically dispatched for disaster relief work, he said directly: "From left to right, report on last week's work."

Due to the flooding, the county's routine work had completely halted. Currently, the main focus was on statistics: affected area, population, crop damage, and current refugee numbers. Then there was the issue of distributing emergency relief grain and arranging refugee housing—with this many people gathered in the streets outside the east gate, not only was normal order affected, but epidemics could easily break out.

The naturalized citizen cadres reported progress on their assigned tasks one by one. Liu Xiang listened while recording data in his laptop. After reports concluded, he would fire off rapid-fire questions: "You said 'roughly'—what's the percentage probability?" "How much exactly is 'most'—sixty percent or eighty?" "What does 'very many people' mean—exactly how many?" "Yesterday your report said Nanxian Village had entirely fled, so why do the reported remaining population figures still show four households with fifteen people?" "Dushui Village is clearly growing rice, how did it become taro?"...

The naturalized citizen cadres were all on edge, constantly glancing at the paper notebooks in their hands—they knew the chief was extremely hard to fool. Even the county's old clerks were no match for him. He pressed a few buttons on his black notebook and knew exactly where the holes in their words were, nailing them down with just a sentence or two. Not only that, the "chief's" understanding of many matters was far deeper than they imagined, which was what they found most terrifying.

Lei En, dispatched by the Health Department to handle epidemic prevention, observed this meeting scene with a cold eye, thinking: So Comrade Liu has this skill too! No wonder he made it into the *Lingao Tribune* within a few months in Qiongshan County and created the "Qiongshan Experience."

Soon it was the naturalized citizen section chief of the County Health Section's turn to report on the current epidemic prevention situation. For a "newly liberated area" like Qiongshan, the Health Department's main work wasn't popularizing medical care but epidemic prevention—that is, the prevention and control of infectious diseases.

The Health Section chief first reported current death counts, circumstances of death, and methods of corpse disposal. The body collection teams recruited from the refugees had collected and disposed of about four hundred corpses over the past few days. At the same time, feces, animal carcasses, and plant debris in flooded areas had been uniformly cleared and piled up, then processed through fermentation for harmless disposal. For some areas where water had receded, disinfection work had been carried out by spraying bleaching powder solution. Larger-scale cleaning and disinfection would have to wait until the water fully receded—based on current rainfall, that would probably take over a week.

Next, he reported on disease conditions among the refugees. Intestinal infections and colds were the main prevalent illnesses, with infection rates around 10%. But so far, no large-scale epidemic outbreak had been detected. Lei En thought this conclusion was frankly quite hasty. Given the capabilities of the crash-course-trained naturalized citizen health workers in the Qiongshan County Health Section's quarantine division and their crude equipment, whether they could accurately identify pathogens in excreta was highly questionable. When the Health Department's epidemic prevention division trained them, the focus was still on identifying symptoms, not biochemical testing.
