# Chapter 849 Reconstruction

The sedan chairs proceeded towards Huifu Street. The Qiwei Escort Agency organized a large group of escorts to follow and guard. At every street corner, high-rise fireworks and ten-thousand-character firecrackers were set off. Sun Kecheng led the escorts wearing uniformly newly-made livery, personally following behind in formation on foot, looking like they could finally hold their heads high.

Ever since the Navy fire-attacked the Wuyang Postal Station, the Qiwei Escort Agency, which had been keeping a low profile, finally escaped the situation of acting like a grandson. After the secret agreement between both sides was signed, the Qiwei Escort Agency suddenly became prominent. He had long been suppressing his energy, waiting for Master Guo's return to show off.

When the procession reached Huifu Street, the street entrance was already sealed off by yamen runners sent from Nanhai and Panyu Counties, not allowing idle people near. The original residence and the storefronts of Purple Sincerity Record and Purple Treasure House had already been washed clean and refreshed. The seals that had been posted for more than half a year had long since disappeared, and the weeds in front of the doorsteps had been pulled clean. The road surface was also swept clean and dry. The only problem was that the large glass of Purple Sincerity Record and Purple Treasure House had all been smashed and taken away. For now, they could only temporarily leave the board shutters removed.

Led by head shopkeeper Shen Fan, the workers and craftsmen of the original Purple Enterprises were lined up at the store entrance, eagerly watching the sedan chairs come—they had been looking forward to this day for a long time.

Ever since the Guangzhou Station evacuated completely, the workers and craftsmen received their severance pay and went home separately to lie low. Some unlucky ones who didn't manage to hide were caught by yamen runners, suffering quite a bit and losing some money. Fortunately, Sun Kecheng had been secretly helping, with Gao Ju also lending a hand from time to time, stabilizing people's hearts. Although this group received severance pay and didn't have to worry about food and clothing, after all sitting idle and eating away one's resources every day made them uneasy. Each one eagerly looked forward to Master Guo returning a day earlier so everyone could continue working and doing business.

Looking forward and looking forward, they finally waited for news of Master Guo's return to Guangzhou. The news was communicated by someone Sun Kecheng sent. The Purple Enterprises people couldn't help but spread the word to each other.

After being dismissed, Shen Fan had returned to his hometown to lie low in the countryside. Because he was the head steward of Purple Enterprises, he was a key person Tian Da was searching for. Before leaving Guangzhou, he was almost kidnapped by Tian Da's evil servants. Fortunately, Qiwei had sent people to secretly protect him from the beginning, which kept him safe to escape.

Shen Fan, carrying the roster of the entire Guangzhou Station's workers and craftsmen on his person, escaped to his hometown to lie low under escort protection. Unexpectedly, Tian Da had a large reach, actually sending yamen runners through the local county yamen to arrest him. His whole family had to flee overnight under escort protection, hiding in one of Qiwei's branch offices for several months.

During the days in hiding, he could track the situation in Guangzhou through the Qiwei Escort Agency's communication network. Although he wasn't as restless as the workers and craftsmen below, he also had great doubts about whether Master Guo and the others could return to Guangzhou—after all, the Australians were dealing with the government.

When the Qiwei Escort Agency people informed him to return to Guangzhou to prepare for reopening, this old shopkeeper couldn't suppress the excitement in his heart, immediately setting off towards Guangzhou. After arriving in Guangzhou, he first stayed at Qiwei's inn. Qiwei's people went out everywhere to notify the workers and craftsmen scattered in various villages and even neighboring counties to return to work. The whole inn was jubilant for a time, all waiting for the master to return and reopen business.

At this moment, Shen Fan stood first among the workers, unable to suppress his excitement. In this whole affair, although he hadn't been able to help the master much, the master had really "come back." The terrible power of the government, which made common people terrified just hearing of it, had actually been turned back by cannons. The Australians' tough style of keeping their word and not fearing the powerful left a deep impression on him.

Watching the sedan chair set down nearby and the curtain lifted, Master Guo emerged from the sedan. He stamped his feet lightly and dusted off the dust from his sleeves, an aura of "royal hegemonic qi" that made people feel like they couldn't measure up. Then, Miss Pei also descended from her sedan behind—still radiant and beautiful, absolutely stunning. Shen Fan forcefully suppressed the excitement in his chest, walked forward a few steps, and knelt down with a grand bow, about to kowtow to Guo Yi. The workers and craftsmen of Purple Group present also all fell to their knees in a swoop. In front of the door, a dense black mass of people knelt down.

Guo Yi was startled. He hadn't expected these people to have such deep feelings for Purple Enterprises. Seeing Shen Fan actually performing a grand bow to him, he hurriedly stepped forward to help him up. Seeing this old shopkeeper already in tears, choking and unable to speak, Guo Yi himself also felt his heart turn a bit sour—this was probably what "loyalty and righteousness" meant. He sighed inwardly.

"Please rise, everyone!" Guo Yi steadied himself and swept his gaze over everyone, "Separated for more than half a year. Everyone has suffered. At that time I also said we would eventually return to Guangzhou, revive the old business, and set off firecrackers together for the shops to reopen." Saying this, he felt his eyes moisten somewhat. "Come! Bring the firecrackers!"

"Coming!" With one call from Shen Fan, workers had already prepared one hundred high-rise fireworks and ten strings of ten-thousand-character firecrackers, densely arranged on Huifu Street.

Guo Yi took an incense stick, lit the fuse of a high-rise firework, and then, high-rise fireworks and ten-thousand-character firecrackers went off one after another. The whole of Huifu Street was immediately deafened by firecracker sounds, filled with smoke.

Guo Yi sat in the flower hall. The flower hall, which had been magnificently furnished, was now completely empty. Even the chair under his butt and the table in front were temporarily bought from secondhand shops—ancient people had no concept of furniture stores; furniture all had to be made by craftsmen. To buy ready-made furniture, one could only buy secondhand.

The twelve twelve-panel windows, made by skilled craftsmen and inlaid with glass, had disappeared without a trace. The greedy yamen runners not only took away all movable property and furniture, but didn't even spare the building materials that could be dismantled and taken. Guo Yi had just gone to look at Purple Sincerity Record's liquor workshop. The distillers and atmospheric boilers inside had been destroyed before withdrawal to prevent others from using them; now looking at them again, they had become dilapidated, with many parts missing. Obviously someone had dismantled these things and moved them somewhere, then recently moved them back.

Almost none of the business equipment returned by the government was intact. Guo Yi shook his head looking at them. Most things probably only had value for being dismantled for firewood or recycling materials. As for ordinary household items, the kitchen didn't even have a single pot or bowl left. It was even difficult to boil water to drink.

Fortunately, the house had already been cleaned up several times a few days ago by Sun Kecheng and Shen Fan organizing people. The weeds in the courtyard had also been pulled out.

Even so, this once flourishing property still looked utterly decrepit.

"Really ruined beyond recognition." Guo Yi sighed.

"Where do I sleep..." Pei Lixiu glanced at her original boudoir on Huifu Street—inside could be described as "bare walls." As for Purple Brightness Tower, that went without saying. She and Zheng Shangjie had originally wanted to go back to Purple Brightness Tower immediately to see the situation. But Shopkeeper Sun asked her to wait until tomorrow—they were still cleaning there. It probably couldn't be lived in.

"You and Zheng Shangjie should stay at Qiwei's inn for tonight. I've already instructed Shopkeeper Sun to prepare a luxury room. With a bathroom, very clean." Guo Yi instructed people to set up a camp bed in his bedroom first, with a desk for office use.

"I won't go stay there. Just temporarily set up a bed for me too. Tonight is perfect for reconsidering the plan to restore Purple Brightness Tower." Zheng Shangjie was very career-minded, feeling that roughing it was manageable.

Guo Yi instructed people to first post notices outside the residence on Huifu Street, Purple Sincerity Record, Purple Treasure House, and Purple Brightness Tower: "Reopening soon. All workers and friends of this shop and residence, please report back within three days to resume positions." Although most people had already come back to report before opening, there were still some who hadn't been contacted.

As for furniture in the rooms, daily necessities, and business equipment in the stores—immediately find craftsmen to make them, sparing no expense, having carpenters make them as soon as possible. Some that could be bought from secondhand shops should be bought from secondhand shops first. But Guo Yi required that only good quality items be bought, not making do with inferior substitutes.

"That's easy. Recently there are quite a few wealthy households selling 'confiscated goods' here in Guangzhou. There are lots of good things in secondhand shops. Not to mention furniture, even decorative objects are available to pick from!" Shen Fan said with a smile. He was so busy his feet didn't touch the ground, running back and forth making arrangements. Guo Yi gave him a De Long Guangzhou Branch passbook to draw funds from freely.

"Oh? What's going on?" Guo Yi asked curiously.

"It's all because of the Australians..." Shen Fan lowered his voice but couldn't suppress wanting to laugh, "The government army suffered a great defeat in Qiongzhou Prefecture. The civil and military officials leading troops died or were captured. Those captured need ransom money to get released. Back here the Imperial Court still has to punish them. The guilty need to escape punishment; the innocent want promotions. It's simply a mess... Doesn't all this require money to grease palms and work connections?"

"So that's it." Guo Yi thought, *Our victory at Chengmai really taught these officials a good lesson.*

"Now there are those selling land and houses too. If the master is interested, you can also secretly look to see if there's anything suitable."

"You help me keep an eye out first. Report back when there's something suitable."

"Yes. Quite a few people in the Guangdong officialdom were implicated this time." Shen Fan had no feelings for the Great Ming Imperial Court anymore, having no sympathy whatsoever for these officials who preyed on the people and abused their power falling into misfortune. "Rest assured, master. I'll take Buyer Zhou with me. He's known as 'Zhou the Skinner.' I must squeeze these dirty officials properly and vent some anger for the master—these officials have quite a few good things in their hands."

"Good, go ahead." Guo Yi nodded.

Guo Yi's boat had brought along a construction team from Lingao General Construction Company, preparing to repair the residence and properties. They also brought some building materials that might be needed—such as large panes of glass. But looking at it now, the damage to the buildings was far beyond his expectations. The prepared materials were insufficient in both quantity and variety. Also boilers, distillers, sanitary fixtures—these all had to be ordered from Lingao. Guo Yi knew Purple Brightness Tower's condition would only be worse than here—many of the "strange crafts and cleverness" things inside probably survived only one in ten. Quite possibly even the water pipes and faucets had been dismantled and taken away.
