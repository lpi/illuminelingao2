# Chapter 1124 - Public Trial Assembly

Those convicted of treason and sedition were sentenced to death by hanging, with all properties confiscated. Those found to be accomplices in hiding, aiding and abetting were sentenced to various terms of hard labor with properties confiscated.

Regarding the applicable laws, for cases where the Arbitration Tribunal had written law or precedent, they followed standard judgments. Where none existed, Committee members serving as judges could exercise discretion, choosing whichever legal system they pleased.

From a "rule of law" perspective, this legal framework was extremely crude. So the Arbitration Tribunal had already announced that they were organizing two small groups to soon visit Jeju Island and Taiwan for research, preparing to draft "Basic Laws" for both territories.

Nangong Wudi temporarily served as presiding judge, signing judgment documents in batches. According to the Tribunal's relevant recommendations, corruption case verdicts came in only two varieties: some number of years of hard labor, with complete confiscation of assets. Apart from Pak Deokhwan, most of the implicated individuals received sentences of three or more years of hard labor. Those sentenced to hard labor, regardless of term, were to serve in Taiwan, Hainan, or even Vietnam. Those whose offenses were very minor had their assets confiscated and were kept locally as "punishment squads" for indefinite labor service.

To highlight the significance of this campaign, *Jeju News* not only published a special edition on the case, but also organized an anti-corruption exhibition at the Confucian Academy. The floor of the Academy's Dacheng Hall was piled with various confiscated valuables.

Feng Zongze found the "ill-gotten gains" rather pathetic. The silver and copper coins seized from Pak Deokhwan's residence totaled less than fifty taels, plus a dozen or so bolts of silk. The other items—cotton cloth, furniture, rice, salt... a miscellany mostly of daily necessities, including even soybean paste.

"This counts as ill-gotten gains?" Feng Zongze couldn't help commenting after looking around. "This stuff? They should at least tie up Jang Seong-seol and put her on display here too. I think she's the only thing worth any money."

"When a group of people are about to starve, the one who eats his fill is the elite. Whether something is corrupt depends on the overall material level," Nangong Wudi said. "Never mind Jeju—just a Yi dynasty border district. Even the Yi dynasty's nobles—how much wealth could they have? Didn't you visit South Korea once and tour some royal palace? That building would barely qualify as a moderately prosperous landlord's compound in an underdeveloped region of the Ming. You can't say the person living there wasn't fit to be called King of Korea."

"You're right, it just feels really shabby," Feng Zongze said.

"We find it shabby. The Yi dynasty's commoners would find it abundant." Nangong Wudi checked his watch and asked quietly: "The operation is about to begin?"

"Starting on schedule," Feng Zongze replied quietly. "Xueweiwei says he's made all preparations."

Nangong Wudi said nothing. The two returned to the Military Barracks. A new command center had been set up there—from here, the first order of the Jeju Island Security Enforcement Campaign would be issued.

The Jeju Security Enforcement Campaign was personally designed by Xue Ziliang. All Committee resources on Jeju—army, navy, and civil departments alike—were at his unified disposal.

But Xue Ziliang understood the Committee's "preferences" very well—they wouldn't appreciate it without a rousing mass movement. So he delegated this work to Feng Zongze.

Feng Zongze and Nangong Wudi each visited various departments, conveying the order to launch the Security Enforcement Campaign to the Agricultural Corps companies, Shandong militia, Japanese Public Security forces, White Horse Battalion, and Korean Labor Service teams. The campaign quickly unfolded across all of Jeju City.

The campaign began with a spectacular "public trial." A high platform was erected before the Military Barracks. White Horse Battalion personnel holding clubs maintained order; Japanese Public Security soldiers had their *tachi* drawn. Every resident of the city—men, women, old, and young—anyone who could walk had to attend. Besides the local populace, some Shandong migrants and Agricultural Corps personnel also participated. The entire plaza and streets were packed to capacity.

Feng Zongze intended to "go big"—he deployed loudspeakers and arranged for interpreters to provide simultaneous translation: though the public trial's audience was primarily local residents, the Shandong migrants needed a warning too.

Amid ocean-roaring shouts, the "seditious elements" headed by Cho Myeong-gwi and Jang Seong-seol were brought out for public judgment. Their crimes had already been read aloud and evidence presented, with emphasis on the saboteurs' organization and implementation of arson and poisoning—unlike ordinary sabotage, this was indiscriminate attack, classic "terrorism," easily inspiring ordinary people's fear and hatred.

---

Nangong Wudi also kept directing the focus toward Lord Kim and the Yi Court. "Fear"—"hatred"—the "legitimate dynasty" Yi Court became "the enemy." The populace's fear of possible harm to themselves transformed into boundless hatred—especially since the Korean commoners on the island held no love for the Yi Court anyway, many being exiled convicts and government slaves. Under Nangong Wudi's fierce and relentless shouting and questioning, with naturalized propaganda personnel planted among the crowd responding on cue, the incited hatred erupted. Slogans rose in waves.

Cho Myeong-gwi's face was ashen—he could no longer speak. Even facing the Political Security Bureau's "eagle" marathon interrogations, his mind and body near collapse, he hadn't felt this kind of terror. The people below were all gnashing their teeth as if they wanted to tear him apart alive. Though the "Great Song" officials hadn't made him kneel, his legs gave way. He'd have collapsed like mud without two White Horse Battalion soldiers supporting him.

By comparison, Jang Seong-seol remained much calmer. Her face was deathly pale. Several times she struggled and tried to shout, but each time she opened her mouth, she was drowned out by the roars orchestrated by the naturalized propaganda workers. After several attempts, she finally realized that even her last resistance was futile.

As for the other prisoners—knowing doom was upon them, they collapsed to the ground one by one, unable to speak, some even losing control of their bladders and bowels. Just as Nangong Wudi was about to announce the verdict, Jang Seong-seol suddenly caught the female White Horse soldier holding her arm off guard and bit her viciously.

This time, without prompting from propaganda workers, the crowd—already whipped into a frenzy—roared in unison: "Kill her!" The crowd even began surging toward the platform. White Horse Battalion and Japanese Public Security soldiers quickly moved to hold them back, preventing the mob from rushing forward.

On the platform, Jang Seong-seol struggled like a madwoman. Two female soldiers couldn't restrain her; two male soldiers quickly stepped up to pin her down. A hemp ball was stuffed in her mouth.

Nangong Wudi rather admired Jang Seong-seol's reaction—this was the perfect embodiment of "death throes." He then stood up to announce the verdict.

"In the name of the Committee and the People, the judgment for the Jeju 3.15 and 3.20 sedition cases is as follows—"

Military drums suddenly thundered; the plaza fell silent.

Nangong Wudi deliberately paused to make his pronouncement more impactful.

"...Cho Myeong-gwi, death!"

"...Jang Seong-seol, death!"

...

He read out the verdicts one by one. Cho Myeong-gwi and twelve others within the city were sentenced to death for organizing, receiving, harboring, and liaising with the "rebels"; another fifteen "militiamen" who'd infiltrated the city planning arson and poisoning were also sentenced to death.

The remaining implicated individuals received varying terms of hard labor. The property of all those involved was confiscated. As a result, except for a few small businesses, organized private handicrafts and commerce in Jeju City essentially ceased to exist.

Those exposed during the trial as "masterminds behind the scenes"—Kim Man-il, Huang Yunyu, and multiple local ranchers and landowners—were sentenced to death in absentia, with all properties confiscated.

Those sentenced to death were hanged on gallows erected outside Jeju's four gates, their bodies left to dry in the wind.

After the verdicts, a "Punitive Expedition Rally" was held. The rally first announced commendations for the Kim siblings' heroic deeds, then declared a "punitive expedition" against "hostile elements" across the island. Finally, Nangong Wudi and Feng Zongze reviewed the expeditionary force. The Fupo Army, Japanese Public Security, White Horse Battalion, and Shandong militia organized as National Army all passed in review.

Drums pounded; cannons boomed. While Jeju City seethed with activity, punitive columns had already quietly deployed, shooting like arrows toward pre-marked targets. The Jeju Island Security Enforcement Campaign had officially begun.

Feng Zongze dragged his excited yet exhausted body back to his office at the Military Barracks. He checked his watch: according to the schedule, news of the first stockade's fall should come in half an hour. Just then, a guard reported: "Interpreter Clerk Pak Deokmeng requests an audience, sir."

"Show him in," Feng Zongze said.
