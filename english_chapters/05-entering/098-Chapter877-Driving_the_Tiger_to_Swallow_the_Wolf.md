# Chapter 877 - Driving the Tiger to Swallow the Wolf

Beyond his vast trove of electronic Daoist scriptures, Zhang Yingchen's hard drive and optical discs harbored the richest collection of BL erotica in the entire Elder Council—a library that put even the Grand Archive to shame.

"I recall Hong Kong once published a manga adaptation of *Jin Ping Mei*," Lu Zhongxing mused. "The art style was quite realistic—I read it years ago. The aesthetic differs markedly from Japanese works, so it might appeal more to local tastes. The tragedy, of course, is how they warped the original plot."

Zhao Yingong bit into a piece of fried bean curd roll. "That's not the issue. The issue is reproducing electronic manga onto woodblock or stone. We can't simply print everything out—surely you're not suggesting workers carve while squinting at a screen?"

"Printing isn't impossible," Zhou Dongtian replied. "Or tracing from the display. Electronic formats will degrade eventually; physical copies on paper remain essential for preservation. When I return, I'll explore photo-lithography—assuming the chemical engineers can deliver. Photo-lithographic plates are far more convenient than stone lithography. If that fails, I'll produce sample copies via stone lithography in Lingao first, then bring them as masters—woodblock or lithograph, your choice."

As the meal progressed, conversation drifted toward securing support from the Hangzhou Church. Though Zhao Yingong had established initial contact, he hadn't yet reached the point where he could freely request favors. His occasional visits were designed to cultivate relationships with key figures—his primary goal being to connect with Xu Guangqi's family as soon as possible.

Progress, however, remained sluggish. After several visits, Zhao Yingong sensed that the church leaders' enthusiasm for converting him far outweighed their willingness to help him reach Xu Guangqi. And to avoid alienating non-Christian gentry who might take offense at too close an association with Catholics, he couldn't visit too frequently.

Zhang Yingchen, however, exuded quiet confidence. "I have a solution."

"What solution?" Zhao Yingong asked, intrigued.

"It's simple, really." A mysterious smile played across Zhang Yingchen's face.

"Are you familiar with the Hangzhou Religious Case of the eighth year of Chongzhen?"

"Religious cases? I only know about Auguste Chapdelaine and the Tianjin Massacre—the one that brought Old Zeng such spectacular humiliation."

"The late Ming had several of its own. The most prominent was the Nanjing Religious Case—"

"Get to the point."

"This can be considered Catholicism's second major setback in China," Zhang Yingchen continued with obvious relish, savoring a piece of spring bamboo shoot between words.

The controversy originated from a debate between Giulio Aleni and the Confucian scholar Huang Zhen in Zhangzhou, Fujian. Afterward, Huang Zhen traveled from Fujian to Zhejiang, recruiting Confucian scholars and Chan masters throughout the region to critique Jesuit doctrines. These polemics were eventually compiled into the *Collection for Destroying Vicious Doctrines*, known as *Poxie Ji*.

The religious debate in Hangzhou ignited in the third month of 1635. Huang Zhen visited Chan Master Miyun Yuanwu at Tiantong Temple in Ningbo. Yuanwu then composed *First Discussion on Discerning Heaven* and entrusted it to his only lay disciple, Purun, for public posting in Hangzhou. The Catholic Church offered no response.

In the eighth month, Zhang Tian—religious name Guangtian—a disciple of the late eminent monk Yunqi Lianchi, carried the *First Discussion* directly to the Jesuit church at Guanxiang in Hangzhou, presenting it to the priest Alfonso Vagnone.

According to records in *Second Discussion on Discerning Heaven*, the Jesuits declined to respond. Consequently, in the ninth month, Yuanwu authored his *Second Discussion* and again posted it publicly in Hangzhou. The church continued to avoid confrontation; only a few converted Confucian scholars declined debate on grounds that Lianchi's *Explanation of Heaven*, written during his lifetime to refute Matteo Ricci, had already proven unsuccessful.

Subsequently, Monk Yuanwu penned his *Third Discussion on Discerning Heaven*. Meanwhile, Zhang Tian, examining the church's missionary document *Posthumous Letters on Discerning Learning*, determined that the author of the earlier *Four Points in Response to Grand Master Lianchi's Bamboo Window Explanation of Heaven* was not actually Matteo Ricci. Furthermore, the Fujian woodblock edition of *Posthumous Letters* contained a preface by "Michael"—the baptismal name of Censor Yang Tingyun—in which Yang fabricated a story about Monk Yunqi repenting to God on his deathbed.

Thus Zhang Tian composed *Discussion Proving Falsehoods*, launching another attack on the Catholic Church.

Throughout this siege, the Catholics maintained a posture of deliberate withdrawal, refusing to engage in debate. Though some Confucian converts within the church attempted to mount counterattacks, the leadership adhered to a policy of studied silence—evidently having learned harsh lessons from the Nanjing Religious Case. They adopted the stance that the innocent need not defend themselves.

The strategy proved effective. Before long, ordinary scholars—neither Buddhist nor Catholic—stepped forward to criticize the Buddhists themselves: "Master Yunqi's virtue in benefiting the world shines bright as the sun in heaven. Who can obscure it? Those who slander only slander themselves; how can they damage his light? Have you not heard the ancient sages say, 'Of all rights and wrongs, debate none'? Why then chatter on so?"

Clearly, the Catholics' tactical retreat successfully cast them as victims, shielding the vulnerable Hangzhou Church from further assault and allowing them to weather the storm unscathed.

"But right now it's only the fourth year of Chongzhen," Zhao Yingong reminded him. "By the eighth year, the entire situation may have transformed."

"Hear me out." Zhang Yingchen savored the suspense. "Late Ming scholars commonly embraced 'escaping into Chan Buddhism' to flee social reality. The Chan sect commands enormous influence here. The Ningbo-Hangzhou-Jiaxing region is the Linji school's heartland. Spreading our New Daoism here will prove extraordinarily difficult. And Buddhists regard Daoism no more kindly. If I squeeze in to preach now, I'll face challenges every bit as formidable as the Catholics'. You understand how hard it is to poach customers in a mature market?"

Everyone nodded. New Daoism's success in Qiongzhou had simply exploited the vacuum in Li minority areas that lacked any established religion. On the mainland, conditions would be far less favorable.

In the Two Zhejiang region, where Buddhist roots ran deep, New Daoism couldn't seize territory from entrenched rivals in a single stroke. But by provoking early conflict between Buddhists and Jesuit missionaries, they could first weaken Catholic influence—though small, the Catholics possessed dedicated priests and fervent believers willing to sacrifice everything, granting them considerable potential. Second, they could use the religious case to tarnish Buddhism's reputation. After all, throughout the controversy, Buddhists had consistently displayed aggressive postures that would inevitably alienate neutral observers.

"If I want a slice of this pie, the only path forward is driving the tiger to swallow the wolf—ruining the influence of both religions through mutual destruction." Zhang Yingchen raised his wine cup and took a sip. "I intend to trigger this debate ahead of schedule and profit from the struggle between tigers."

"So you want to trigger the religious case early and muddy the waters—I understand that," Zhao Yingong said, raising his eyebrow. "But how does this help us win the church's assistance?"

"Old Zhao, you're wise your whole life but confused for a moment." Zhang Yingchen smiled. "Right now, the Hangzhou Church is stable and the world is at peace. You're merely icing on their cake. If I stir things up, I'll dump a blizzard on them. Then when you offer a single piece of charcoal, they'll weep with gratitude."

Zhao Yingong wouldn't need to exert much effort—certainly not to debate publicly on the church's behalf. He would simply need to suggest to church leadership the historically proven strategy of meeting all changes with constancy, allowing them to weather the crisis safely and earning their goodwill.

"Daoist, you truly are black-hearted," Mei Lin remarked approvingly, though privately he harbored doubts. Many events required accumulated conditions to occur. Rashly triggering events prematurely might prove mere wishful thinking on Daoist Zhang's part. For one thing, how would they locate the instigator Huang Zhen in this vast sea of humanity? Historical records identified him only as a scholar from Zhangzhou, Fujian—no address, no profession. Furthermore, a person's thoughts were always evolving; this man might not have even conceived of debating Catholicism yet.

"Not black-hearted—but if this succeeds, everyone's mission benefits." Zhang Yingchen's expression turned smug. "And I'm not speaking idly. Huang Zhen arrived in Hangzhou a few days ago."

"How do you know?" Mei Lin was astonished.

"Yesterday, someone sought me out to treat a patient at an inn. The patient's name is Huang Zhen, also from Zhangzhou, Fujian. Who else could it be?" Zhang Yingchen replied. "I'm currently stalling him, claiming I have too many patients and will visit in a few days. I wanted to discuss this with all of you first."

"How could he have come to Hangzhou?" Zhao Yingong's surprise was evident. "According to the history you cited, he should still be in Fujian."

"The butterfly's wings may have already caused deviations in history's trajectory," Zhang Yingchen said. "His sudden appearance in Hangzhou is truly an opportunity delivered to our doorstep. If we fail to exploit it, we would simply be letting down the butterfly."

The group fell into contemplation. Zhang Yingchen's plan to drive the tiger to swallow the wolf—to provoke conflict and fish in troubled waters—was undeniably creative. Creative deduction suggested high odds of success, yet no one knew whether unforeseen consequences might spawn other complications. Events might not proceed entirely according to their wishes.

Zhang Yingchen looked to Zhao Yingong. All present were senators, and Zhang Yingchen possessed the authority to "act as circumstances dictate"—but he remained part of the Hangzhou Station. This was no minor matter; without the station chief's approval, unilateral action would be inappropriate.

"To achieve great things, one must not be hindered by trifles." Zhao Yingong gave his nod. "This is feasible."

"However, this means I shouldn't visit here frequently." Zhang Yingchen's tone grew cautious. "Though I won't personally step forward, careful investigation might reveal certain clues. Too much association with you might arouse the church's suspicions about you as well."

"I understand." Zhao Yingong nodded. "We'll communicate by letter henceforth. When detailed discussion becomes necessary, I'll visit Qingyun Temple to offer incense. Though we needn't absolutely avoid meeting—that would appear too deliberate."
