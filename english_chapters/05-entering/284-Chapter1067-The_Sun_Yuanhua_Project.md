# Chapter 1067 - The Sun Yuanhua Project

Inside the safe house, the group rapidly made final preparations for withdrawal. Unlike the infiltration, the extraction required bringing along Sun Yuanhua and others. Their movements couldn't be as fast and fluid as when they entered, so specific arrangements had to be made for the retreating personnel.

Sun Yuanhua was placed on a simple stretcher—this had been prepared by Huang Ande a few days prior on Chen Sigen's orders. It was a wooden pole and rope net stretcher made to Lingao standards. The assault team brought adjustable buckle straps to effectively secure the body to the stretcher.

Sun Yuan and the two young servants carried Sun Yuanhua's stretcher, with a team guarding the front and rear.

"Salamander calling Crocodile. Salamander calling Crocodile. First rendezvous point reached. Preparing to withdraw to exfiltration point. All personnel safe. Please instruct," the captain reported.

"Withdrawal approved."

"What about you? Are you withdrawing with us or continuing in the city?" the captain asked Huang Ande.

"They will go with you; he and I will stay," Huang Ande said. He considered that if he left, the team in the city would immediately fall apart without his leadership, and his months of activity in the city would be wasted.

Sun Yuan had to go, but the others didn't need to.

As long as he remained in the city, he could still play a significant role, adding a glorious stroke to his future resume.

"Alright, watch yourselves."

Sun Yuan and the two servants also underwent necessary disguises, blackening their faces. To prevent them from shouting inadvertently, all three were gagged.

"Sorry, you'll have to suffer a bit for now," the sergeant said.

The assault team quickly completed the task of sweeping the safe house and began to withdraw, covering each other in sequence.

Zhu Si looked at the group taking Lord Sun away with a face full of confusion. This night had been too bizarre and eerie. He couldn't help but bite his tongue, then looked at Huang Ande, feeling very afraid—if Huang Ande hadn't been coming and going from the Water City for months and wasn't his sworn brother's childhood friend, he really would have thought Huang Ande was a demon.

However, being sworn brothers with someone of such high skill and background made Zhu Si secretly happy.

"Brother..."

"Don't be afraid," Huang Ande said smugly, looking at Zhu Si's mix of fear and excitement. "Let's go, let's head back quickly."

Just as Huang Ande was about to take Zhu Si away from the safe house, a call tone suddenly came from the radio. He quickly turned it on.

"This is Crocodile calling Jones."

"Jones hears you."

"Since you are not leaving Dengzhou, I now order you and your team to enter hibernation immediately," Chen Sigen issued new instructions. "Fighting will break out here in Dengzhou very soon. Unless absolutely necessary, do not join the rebel army. Hide as best you can. If you can no longer lurk in the city, send a message and we will arrange your evacuation immediately."

"Understood."

"Good luck!"

At 0410 hours, Chen Sigen was the last to board the receiving Fubo-class gunboat. Zhu Mingxia, who had been waiting for a long time, greeted him with a beaming smile: "Victory in the first battle! Mood is good."

"Yes, it’s just the beginning!" he said.

Recovering the rowboats, the *Fubo* transported the assault team and Sun Yuanhua toward Dazhushan Island. Chen Sigen was very excited and didn't want to rest at all, pacing alone on the deck: The treasure-snatching operation had gone far more smoothly than they had imagined. Before this, the Special Reconnaissance Team had carried out strictly nocturnal kidnapping and assassination missions in various cities in the Pearl River Delta, but those were under peacetime conditions, unlike a dangerous city occupied by a large number of enemy troops in a state of war like Dengzhou.

It seemed the Special Reconnaissance Team had a promising future!

Chen Sigen held two positions: one in the Ministry of Health, serving as the Director of the Nutrition and Fitness Division, and the other in the military. Usually, his work left him juggling too many things. To accommodate his work at the Ministry of Health, the General Staff mostly scheduled his detachment for duty in Bairen City. Even so, daily training, duty, and exercises still took up too much of his time and energy. Chen Sigen had always considered giving up his military post to focus on his health career.

*Now it seems that grinding for merit points is faster in the army,* Chen Sigen thought.

The *Fubo* soon arrived at Dazhushan Island. Chen Sigen was surprised to see a Senator there to welcome him.

It was none other than the "Manor Lord" of Qimu Island, Lu Wenyuan.

"Why are you here?" Chen Sigen asked as he walked down the gangway. "There's no Senator holding down the fort on Qimu Island; what if things go chaotic?"

"It doesn't matter. I came out secretly. There are naturalized citizen cadres and the Army on the island; it won't be chaotic," Lu Wenyuan said. "When Sun Yuanhua wakes up, there needs to be someone familiar, right?"

Sun Yuanhua didn't know any of the Senators on Dazhushan Island. Explaining things to him would require first gaining his trust. Lu Wenyuan didn't have this problem.

"True." Chen Sigen nodded. "Since everyone is here, let's decide: Where do we send Sun Yuanhua?"

"In my opinion, keeping him on Dazhushan Island is fine. There's Navy cover here, the rebels can't attack, and it's close to Dengzhou..." Chen Sigen said.

"No, I think we should send him to Qimu Island as soon as possible," Lu Wenyuan said. "The news of Sun Yuanhua's capture hasn't officially spread yet. At most, the Imperial Court has received vague information about Dengzhou falling and Sun Yuanhua's fate being unknown. The Court won't have made a decision to appoint a new Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou yet. We must get Sun Yuanhua back to the mainland quickly and have him submit a memorial immediately to regain the initiative."

Although the fall of Dengzhou was a major crime for Sun Yuanhua, the fact that he himself wasn't captured (publicly) and the fatal rumor of "Kong Youde intending to make him King" hadn't spread meant there was still room to maneuver. Not to mention that since Sun Yuanhua hadn't been dismissed by the Court, the entire three prefectures of Dengzhou and Laizhou still had to obey his orders—which was extremely beneficial to the Engine Operation.

"Sun Yuanhua must be under our control. We can't leave him on Dazhushan Island—this is just a small desolate island after all, news travels slow. Qimu Island has a radio and a pier; communication and transport are convenient."

Chen Sigen felt his reasoning was sound, so he decided to take the whole force and Sun Yuanhua off Dazhushan Island. As long as they had Sun Yuanhua, any Ming troops around the Shandong Peninsula under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou would have to obey orders. It was difficult to garrison a place like Dazhushan Island on a large scale, and they lacked enough naval vessels to control the surrounding waters. It was also very close to Dengzhou; if attacked by Ming forces or rebels, the soldiers left behind would just be sacrificed for nothing.

At dawn, the *Fubo* and the Special Service Boat Squadron transported all personnel and equipment of the Treasure Snatching Operation from Dazhushan Island to Qimu Island.

At the pier on Qimu Island, there was an additional Type 901 gunboat and several special service boats.

Chen Sigen was a bit surprised—thousands of refugees had just been transported from the island to Jeju Island. Ideally, a gunboat not performing escort duties arriving suddenly at Qimu Island was quite unexpected.

When they got close enough to read the hull number visually, Chen Sigen recognized it: This was the *Daishuang* of the Second Fleet.

"When did this ship arrive?"

"Lu Yang? He brought the ship yesterday," Lu Wenyuan said. "Headquarters said they wanted to strengthen the maritime power around Qimu Island. They deployed both the *Daishuang* and the *Fubo* to Qimu Island, along with two Special Service Boat Squadrons. This also allows for a shuttle escort system, giving the crew and ships a chance to rest."

"Is this kid up to it? I recall he was only 20 on D-Day, right?" Chen Sigen knew of him—this person was a "passerby" Senator with zero presence, belonging to the "soy sauce crowd" (bystanders) with no muscles for physical labor and no skills for technical work. Later, during the massive expansion of the Navy and Army, "soy sauce" Senators were dragged everywhere to be officers. This kid thought joining the Navy was cooler, so he entered the naval training class. The reason Chen Sigen knew him was because he had brought his mother along.

Lu Yang's mother wasn't old, only in her fifties. Since D-Day, she had lived a secluded life; people only remembered her surname was Qian. She used to be a vice-principal of a primary school and had to cross over because she only had one son. For the first two years after D-Day, due to bad mood and the sweltering southern heat, she had been staying at Gaoshanling to escape the heat, writing textbooks and lesson plans for the education department. It wasn't until the education of underage minor Senators was put on the agenda that she formally got a job: because everyone was unanimously uneasy about certain "鬼畜" (guichu/demonic/perverted) teachers at Fangcaodi, she, with over thirty years of teaching experience, was invited out to be the head teacher and instructor for the underage Senator class, partnering with Fang Yijing to handle the education of the next generation. Everyone respectfully called her Principal Qian.

Since there were only a few minor Senators of school age, even adding some carefully selected naturalized orphan students and children, Principal Qian's class only had twelve people. Their existence was barely felt at Fangcaodi. Chen Sigen was a nutrition expert and often had to go to this special class for physical examinations and nutritional meal planning, so he was quite familiar with Principal Qian and her son.

Lu Yang was already waiting respectfully at the pier. Seeing Chen Sigen come ashore, he welcomed him with a face full of enthusiasm, saluting and shaking hands: "Comrade Chen Sigen, congratulations on completing the dangerous mission of infiltration and rescue behind enemy lines. From now on, the safety of field Senators has another layer of guarantee."

Chen Sigen said, "You flatter me. I think you are the one who is young and promising, becoming the commander of a naval detachment at such a young age."

"You flatter me, you flatter me. This is just a temporary assignment; I still have a lot to learn." Lu Yang was very humble. The group returned to Lu Wenyuan's stockade.

Lu Wenyuan ordered Sun Yuanhua, who was still asleep, to be settled in a meticulously prepared guest room with double guards at the door. In addition, a maid trained by the General Bureau of Security served in the bedroom. Chen Sigen, still worried, made sure to call Xie Yao immediately to examine Sun Yuanhua and ensure all his major physiological indicators were normal. Sun Yuan and the two young servants were sent to bathe and decontaminate immediately—though, following his orders, their hair could be left unshaven for the time being.
