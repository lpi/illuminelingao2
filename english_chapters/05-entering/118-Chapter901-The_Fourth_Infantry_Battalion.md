# Chapter 901 – The Fourth Infantry Battalion

The battalions that had been pulled back from various parts of northern Hainan and reconsolidated in Lingao were now undergoing rehabilitation training. The ten-month-long counterinsurgency campaign had given the troops extensive experience in anti-guerrilla warfare, but it had been detrimental to the regularization of the military. Prolonged dispersed operations and garrison duties had led to a slackening of organizational discipline. During the counterinsurgency, many battalions had operated at the platoon level.

The transmigrator officers—whether of the New Doctrine school or the Old Guard—were keenly aware of the problems with dispersed warfare. Regular forces shouldn't be engaged in counterinsurgency too long, or else it would lead to a regression in overall quality. The Japanese had once implemented their "cage policy" in North China, scattering strongpoints everywhere—a squad here, four or five men there. For a time, it had certainly suppressed the Eighth Route Army's operations and struck at the base areas. But the extreme dispersal of forces had resulted in lax discipline and a complete lack of training. By the end of the war, the combat effectiveness and individual soldier quality of the North China Expeditionary Army had declined precipitously.

Counterinsurgency work should primarily be the domain of local forces and militia; the regular army was a "heavy instrument." To solve the problem of local control, the General Staff had commissioned Fu Sansi at Ma'ao to establish a special National Army training camp. Able-bodied men were conscripted from the various counties of Hainan and brought there for intensive training. Officers and NCOs were selected from the regular forces. After training, they would be deployed at the rate of one company per county, with plans to later expand to a three-company battalion structure.

The 4th Battalion hadn't received orders for rehabilitation training—aside from serving briefly as a garrison force in Qiongshan after the Chengmai Campaign, it had never been dispersed. It had remained in a concentrated deployment at Ma'ao, so there was no need for additional rehabilitation exercises. The training orders Zhu Mingxia received were: "Intensify physical conditioning" and "Commence battalion-wide amphibious training immediately."

From these two orders alone, Zhu Mingxia knew his battalion would be drawn into Operation Engine.

Although the General Staff hadn't formally issued orders to him yet, the reason for full-battalion amphibious training was obvious:

Operation Engine would be conducted entirely in coastal regions. To ensure the successful extraction of population, large-scale ground forces would need to be deployed. To adapt to the new operational environment, the Army had to master the techniques of rapid beach landings, become accustomed to extended life aboard ships and sea transfers, and adapt to northern climates.

Previously, such amphibious operations had been the exclusive domain of the Marines. But Operation Engine was massive in scale and long in duration—more than the Marines could handle alone. Zhu Mingxia knew the Marines were equally stretched thin: their main force had been deployed to southern Hainan for the counterinsurgency campaign there. One company was in Hong Kong, another in Vietnam. What they called a "battalion" for Operation Engine was really only four companies—half the size of an Army infantry battalion. The Army would have to play the primary role in this operation.

As for "intensify physical conditioning," it wasn't simply a paper order. Accompanying the directive was a "special ration allocation" for the 4th Battalion. Effective immediately, the 4th Infantry Battalion would receive extra allotments, including more fats and proteins. Miraculously, there would even be daily meat rations—not pork or beef, but chicken. Aside from chicken, the Agriculture Department wasn't yet capable of mass-supplying naturalized citizens with meat from other land animals.

From this, it was clear the General Staff wanted to fatten up the 4th Battalion, to help them endure the low temperatures they'd encounter during the northern campaign.

Participating in Operation Engine was a tremendous opportunity for him. Though every transmigrator officer would eventually make general or marshal—at a recent gathering at the South Sea Café, someone had even proposed adding ranks above general such as Senior General, Vice Marshal, Marshal Paramount, and Grand Marshal, arguing that without such an extensive hierarchy, the Empire's greatness and the Fuboian military's glorious prestige couldn't be properly displayed.

But advancement through military merit was far preferable to advancement by seniority as a transmigrator. Moreover, besides rank, seniority mattered greatly in the military. "What year did you enlist?" was never an idle question. Whoever reached the next rank first would have greater voice and decision-making power in many matters, and correspondingly stronger influence and factional power within the military.

He calculated the military training curriculum starting tomorrow. A few days ago, he'd visited the General Staff offices to discuss the new courses needed for targeted training with several key officers—particularly the amphibious training curriculum.

Zhu Mingxia himself wasn't from a Marine background and lacked knowledge and experience in amphibious assault training. The peculiarities of the Fuboian military meant its training couldn't simply copy from the old-timeline training manuals wholesale. Shi Zhiqi of the Marines was currently the person with the most firsthand experience in commanding amphibious operations. Having his expertise would be enormously helpful.

The problem was that Shi Zhiqi was currently in Hong Kong serving as garrison commander. Getting his advice would be rather troublesome. After some thought, consulting Xue Ziliang seemed more appropriate. Though he didn't command the Marines in this timeline, he had been a member of the U.S. Marine Corps in the old timeline—an experienced professional. Besides, he and Xue Ziliang were fairly close. He often chatted with him during his free time, asking for advice on professional matters.

He made a particular point of exchanging ideas with other officers—especially Beiwei and Xue Ziliang. Much of his free time went to studying military skills from these two. In his view, Beiwei and Xue Ziliang represented the elite soldier standard of China and America respectively. Though he himself came from an elite unit, he recognized there was still considerable distance between him and them.

Tactical proficiency, military theory—there was so much he needed to learn. Especially from Xue Ziliang, who possessed many training methods, weapons-handling theories, and combat techniques utterly unique to this timeline. He also had practical combat experience. Leaving such a man stuck in Special Reconnaissance Command seemed like such a waste. No matter how strong the Special Recon unit was, it was still just a small team—incapable of determining the outcome of a battlefield.

He had also borrowed various materials from the Line Infantry Faction, studying the strategies and tactics of the line-infantry era. Though many of the Old Guard sneered at this, he saw it as taking responsibility for his soldiers' lives. Fight with what you have; don't get ahead of yourself; don't indulge in quirky novelties—that was his principle for training and leading troops.

Zhu Mingxia picked up the hand-crank telephone on his desk and turned it three times to connect to the switchboard:

"Connect me to Special Reconnaissance Command."

Xue Ziliang's official title was Deputy Commander of the Special Recon unit, concurrently serving as leader of the Directly Attached Squadron. When not on missions or training, he was always at the Command Office at the Bairren City main gate.

The call connected quickly, but Xue Ziliang wasn't in. His female orderly reported: "Commander Xue has taken the team out for training."

"Tell him: Zhu Mingxia needs to speak with him. Please have him call back when he returns."

After hanging up, he cranked the handle twice to signal disconnection.

"Should I buy myself a female orderly?" Watching the soldiers scattered about the camp in twos and threes, Zhu Mingxia began to consider his personal situation. Ever since the General Affairs Office and the Military Affairs Bureau had jointly issued the notice that transmigrator officers' life secretaries could be promoted to transmigrator orderlies, he'd been considering this alongside his training curriculum.

The Female Servant School now had few remaining servants who hadn't been purchased. Most were C-grade or below. For the time being, the General Affairs Office hadn't brought in new servant resources. Most unmarried transmigrators had decided to wait: once Operation Engine began, there would be a massive influx of girls from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong—more suited to the transmigrators' aesthetic preferences. Better to wait until after the operation to make a selection.

At that moment, two soldiers passing by his window caught his attention. Their conversation made his brow furrow.

"Have you heard? Amphibious training is starting. Apparently they're even pulling in Navy units to train with us—as our instructors!"

"I really don't want to train with those salt fish. Remember that brawl? Those sailors were way too arrogant, even fighting with the Garrison Battalion, and then they said the Army bullies the Navy. Puh! A bunch of lawless pirates—when have we ever picked on them?"

"Exactly. I also heard someone say the Marines think we shouldn't even exist, that we should just disband. Fine then, let *them* go trudging through mountains to suppress bandits."

"They call us country bumpkins, but they're not exactly from noble stock either. Lots of them were Tanka boatpeople or pirates, going barefoot on deck planks, the kind not even allowed ashore…"

Hearing this, Zhu Mingxia couldn't sit still. He stood up and paced around his office for a few moments. He changed his shoes, then summoned his orderly to issue an emergency assembly order.

The urgent drumbeat of the emergency assembly echoed across the camp. Today was a rest day, and cultural and political studies had already concluded. After sports activities, many soldiers had showered and were washing their laundry.

At the sound of the drums, the soldiers immediately tossed their wash basins aside, dropped their clothes, and sprinted toward the barracks. Soon, soldiers in full uniform began forming up at each company assembly point. The air filled with counting-off: "One, two, three, four!" "Twenty-one, twenty-two!" "Full five!" Once the companies had assembled, duty officers led them to the battalion assembly point. An orderly stood behind Zhu Mingxia, recording the time each company completed assembly.

"Reporting to the Battalion Commander! Line Infantry 6th Company, assembly complete, awaiting orders!" Five minutes and six seconds later, the last company arrived.

"Battalion, draw weapons. No ammunition. Full gear, five-kilometer run. Time limit: twenty-six minutes. 6th Company exceeded regulation time by six seconds, under ten seconds—penalty: one additional kilometer. Begin!"

"Light Infantry Company, at the double—march!"

"Grenadier Company, at the double—march!"

"Line Infantry 1st Company, at the double—march!"

...

In the gaps as each company departed, Zhu Mingxia turned to instruct his orderly: "Same rules as usual. Notify the mess hall: the last company to arrive gets no meat with tomorrow's dinner. Give their meat to the first company to finish." Then he adjusted his belt and set off at a quick pace after the troops.
