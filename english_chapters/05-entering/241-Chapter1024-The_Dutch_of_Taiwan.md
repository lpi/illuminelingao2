# Chapter 1024 The Dutch of Taiwan

"These wretched yellow-skinned monkeys—they only understand cannons and matchlocks! Only a good thrashing will teach them how to deal with people!" While nursing this thought, Putmans gazed with some disgust at the workers expanding Fort Zeelandia—most were local Han immigrants. Labor shortage was a perennial headache for Taiwan's governor. Company personnel transported to the island, even including slaves and hired East Indies natives, never exceeded one thousand. And they were constantly depleted: some hospitalized, some dying. He had no choice but to hire Chinese to complete most civil engineering and cultivation work, at quite steep labor costs, making Taiwan's already deficit finances even worse.

But on matters of defense, he dared not be careless. The Company's trading post in Taiwan held hundreds of thousands of guilders in cash and goods. If anything went wrong, the Company would not forgive him—the directors in the Seven United Provinces were merciless toward those who damaged their profits. Pieter Nuyts's fate stood as a living example.

Recently, however, China trade had improved somewhat. Zheng Zhilong—Liu Xiang's rise had once again softened his attitude—at least regarding trade cooperation, he was no longer as rigid as before. Just last month, Zheng Zhilong's envoy had brought him a letter, probing the possibility of Dutch support.

Putmans had received word that the Council had agreed to provide Liu Xiang covert assistance. Two old two-masted ships had been sold to him. The greater the pressure on Zheng Zhilong, the more cordial his attitude toward the Dutch would become. Of course, Putmans reflected, if Liu Xiang grew too powerful, that would also prove disadvantageous to Taiwan. Pirates were always difficult to control.

Now, however, he faced another troublesome matter. From natives coming to sell deerskins at Zeelandia, he learned that a fleet of "countless giant ships" had arrived at Dagou and was unloading cargo onto the shore, preparing to build houses.

Putmans viewed this news with some skepticism. First, natives possessed poor numerical concepts—when quantities grew large, they could not count and could only employ concepts like "many" or "countless." But for natives to say "countless," at least ten or twenty ships must have arrived at Dagou, and all were "giant ships." Though natives were not particularly civilized, they regularly saw small boats of a few dozen tons—they would never mistake small Chinese coastal fishing boats for "giant ships."

To qualify as "giant ships," vessels had to be at least two hundred tons. Those who could mobilize so many ships at once in East Asian waters, besides Zheng Zhilong, were Liu Xiang, the Spanish, and the Australians.

Regardless of who the visitors were, their landing less than ten Dutch *mijlen* from Taiwan signaled ill intentions. Putmans had already dispatched a reconnaissance vessel to Dagou to investigate the detailed situation.

Actually, Putmans had some predictions about the visitors' identity. Most likely the Australians. A few months ago, an Australian two-masted fast ship had visited Dagou and killed several dozen Tagarayan people. That was likely reconnaissance for this landing.

*Australians—why have you developed interest in this place? Don't you already have Hong Kong Island?* Putmans wondered silently. If the Company could occupy such a fine large island at the Pearl River mouth, they would have been entirely satisfied, conducting large-scale trade there. Why come to this barren island infested with savages? The diseases here alone killed dozens of soldiers and sailors every year.

As a seventeenth-century merchant and soldier, Putmans could not comprehend Taiwan Island's crucial position within the new industrial system the Senate was constructing.

He gazed worriedly at the busy construction site. Hopefully the visitors were not enemies harboring hostility toward Taiwan. His gaze shifted from the expanding Fort Zeelandia to the eastern shore of Taijiang, across the harbor. Currently, only a crude fort stood there. Though it had been rebuilt with brick and stone, it remained very small—capable of accommodating only fifty soldiers and a few cannons. If that fort could be rebuilt into a solid bastion fortress, the two fortifications could form a mutually supporting defense. Adding the fortress on Beixianwei Island, Taiwan's entire security could be fully guaranteed.

Unfortunately, his current resources sufficed only for Fort Zeelandia's expansion. He would have to content himself with merely patching other fortifications.

"Sir, the dispatch vessel *Bornstein* has returned." A servant came to report.

"Have the captain come to me immediately!"

The news brought by dispatch vessel *Bornstein* confirmed his speculation: The visitors were indeed Australians.

"The Australians have twenty-seven ships anchored at Dagou. All are two-masted vessels," the captain reported. "The smallest ship is at least one hundred fifty lasts."

This included the black-smoke-belching fast ships reported by the Lingao consul. One ship's size left a particularly deep impression on the captain. It was a large vessel comparable to the largest Spanish galleons, but with a far more slender and elegant hull. It bore two masts and also belched black smoke. The captain believed this ship might be the Australian fleet's flagship, for it flew multiple different flags.

According to the captain's account, the Australians had already constructed a wooden jetty at Dagou Harbor and erected a three-story circular fortress beside the pier. Simultaneously, approximately twelve wooden structures had been raised on shore.

"Are you certain?" Putmans's eyes widened in surprise. From when he first received news of the Australian landing until now, barely ten days had elapsed—and the Australians had already built so many structures? Just constructing a wooden jetty was a major project. In Taiwan's early days, all personnel and cargo were transported ashore using small boats.

"Yes, sir. This is indeed what I observed with my own eyes."

"Very well. Did the Australians react to your arrival?"

"They merely sent a small boat to inquire about my purpose," the captain reported. "I said I was on a voyage carrying trade goods to Lamey Island. They allowed me to depart." He added, "The small boat they used had neither sail nor long oars, was exceedingly fast, and also constantly belched black smoke."

"You answered well." Putmans nodded. "Rest a while, then load some trade goods and return to Dagou. I now appoint you junior merchant aboard *Bornstein*. Your mission is to enter Dagou under the pretense of trade, make contact with the Australian fleet's highest officer, and attempt to ascertain their true intentions locally. Do you understand?"

"Yes, sir. I'll make arrangements immediately." The captain bowed and stepped back to leave. Putmans stopped him.

"Captain, do you believe in witchcraft?"

The captain's face instantly paled. Whether in Catholic or Protestant countries, professing belief in witchcraft was a fatal offense.

"I do not, sir. I worship only Almighty God."

"Good. What do you make of those Australian vessels that belch black smoke and sail without sails or oars?"

"I cannot say, sir." The captain held his gaze. "Whether that constitutes witchcraft or not, if necessary, I will unhesitatingly fire upon them."

"Very good."

After the captain departed, Putmans deliberated for a time, then summoned garrison commander Captain Heinrich Weidenfelder. This German veteran commanded approximately four hundred VOC troops serving in Taiwan—a mixed force of Europeans, Acehnese from the East Indies, Blacks, and Japanese.

"I must inform you that a battle may very likely erupt here soon..." Putmans began. "How confident are you in defending Taiwan?"

"Sir, that depends on who the enemy is," Captain Weidenfelder replied properly. "If it's Chinese—whether Liu Xiang, Iquan, or the Great Ming's army—I'm confident I can handle them. One of my soldiers can fight twenty-five Chinese."

"I'm glad you're so confident. However, the opponent may be an enemy more formidable than the Spanish..."

"Then I shall need to strengthen defensive works and recruit everyone capable of bearing arms."

"Begin gathering personnel on a small scale—recruiting sailors will await my orders. I authorize you to immediately strengthen existing defenses. I know the fortifications are all being expanded and repaired. First use available materials to reinforce defenses at all positions. Double the night watch! I do not wish to be caught off guard when the time comes."

"Yes, sir."

Watching the captain exit, Putmans thought of the inventory and cash in the warehouse and ships. He felt somewhat anxious about his twenty-five thousand livres of goods. The Dutch East India Company treated its employees quite harshly. Even as a Council member and Formosa's governor, salary and benefits remained very low. Without conducting some smuggling on the side to supplement one's income, one could barely save anything.

The Dutch immediately set to work in Taiwan. Captain Weidenfelder ordered landmines buried on the beach while walls were raised at Beixianwei Island and other simple fortifications using bamboo poles. Cannons stored in warehouses were retrieved to reinforce various batteries.

Soldiers dispatched to protect missionaries and merchants were recalled. Volunteers were recruited from the Japanese village near Taiwan. Sinkan natives were also assembled. A mixed squad of natives and Dutch set out overland toward Dagou, collecting intelligence along the way to assess whether the Australians might attack by land.

Under Putmans's orders, all ships anchored in the harbor made combat preparations. Three large vessels moved to the south channel entrance, standing ready to intercept any enemy ships attempting to breach the harbor. As for the north channel, the water was extremely shallow. Since Australian ships were large, they could not pass through. Moreover, a fortress already stood on Beixianwei Island, its artillery sufficient to block the northern approach.
