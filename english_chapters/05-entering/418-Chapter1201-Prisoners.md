# Chapter 1201 - Prisoners

Zhou Weisen had never studied Spanish, but back in the States he'd dealt with plenty of Mexicans and could muddle through a few everyday phrases—otherwise seducing Mendoza wouldn't have been so easy. He understood the word "surrender" when he heard it. He immediately stopped the assault team from throwing a second tear gas canister. Turning to Ah San the translator, he said:

"Tell them to raise their hands above their heads and come out one by one!" Ah San rattled off the message, then repeated it. Soon there was movement from inside—a Spaniard stumbled out of the pepper smoke, sneezing and tearing up, though he remembered to keep his hands raised overhead.

From his woolen broadcloth clothes and layers of starched ruffs, this was clearly a man of status. The empty scabbard at his thigh confirmed it—only men of standing could wear swords: if not nobility, then at least a so-called "gentleman of good family."

Blinded and choking from the capsicum smoke, the man couldn't see a thing before assault team members seized him and tied him up. Then, with Ah San bellowing "Kneel!" one after another they were forced to their knees on the deck, lined up like a string of trussed crabs.

One man tried to stand up to speak, but Zhou Weisen had neither the time nor the interest to listen. A single gesture and Ah San the translator—as if drugged with stimulants—laid into the unfortunate Spaniard with his stick until the man collapsed motionless on the deck.

Zhou Weisen counted: ten people kneeling on the deck, including two young page boys. From their appearance, they were all officers and important figures from the ship, along with their servants.

After those ten, no more sounds came from inside. Zhou Weisen mounted a tactical flashlight on his SW 629 and was first through the cabin door, followed by assault team members wearing masks and goggles.

Inside, there was no need to demonstrate their tactical training—the cabin was a shambles. Furniture and various items lay scattered everywhere, along with swords, sabers, and matchlock muskets strewn about, as if the occupants had been prepared to make a last stand. But now the room was completely deserted.

"Secure the entrance to the gun deck!" Zhou Weisen shouted. This passage connected the hold to the sterncastle—if the Spaniards wanted to counterattack, it would be their quickest route. "Begin the search!"

The sterncastle had two entrances. One led to the upper deck—the one they'd just breached—from which one could either reach the upper deck or climb the stairs on either side to the poop deck where the helmsman steered and the ship was commanded. The other entrance was on the upper level of the sterncastle, leading to the gun deck. This was normally kept locked to prevent mutinous sailors from using it to launch a surprise attack from below on the sterncastle. In the event of a boarding action by pirates, the sterncastle also served as a defensive strongpoint.

The assault team quickly cleared the senior officers' cabins on the first level and moved up to the second. The second level had three compartments: the outer room was a large chamber the captain used for shipboard administrative work, the middle section served as a dining room for senior officers, and the innermost part was divided into two port and starboard cabins—one for the shipowner and one for the captain. When no shipowner was aboard, his cabin was used for distinguished passengers.

"Clear!" "Clear!" "Clear!" Confirmations came from all directions.

"Continue the search!" Zhou Weisen shouted. The sterncastle often stored personal valuables belonging to the captain and distinguished passengers—especially on regular vessels plying between two colonies, where everyone seized the opportunity for a little smuggling. The captain of the *San Luis* would be no exception. They might make a tidy profit from this area alone.

"Sir!" a team member suddenly shouted. "There's a woman aboard!"

The word "woman" sent a jolt through Zhou Weisen—in this era, aside from slaves, women rarely undertook ocean voyages. While some captains might bring their wives or daughters along, these were rare exceptions.

However, since this was a royal vessel running between New Spain and the Philippines, it was entirely possible it was carrying the family members of important officials.

Spanish women—that meant fiery, passionate Latinas. Though Zhou Weisen already had a big foreign mare he was tired of riding, capturing one Spanish woman would earn him far more merit points in the Senate than catching a whole ship full of Spanish men.

"Where?" he asked urgently.

"In the shipowner's cabin," the team member said. "She won't come out, and we can't understand what she's saying..."

"If she won't come out, drag her out!" Zhou Weisen said coldly. "Take her alive!"

Several minutes later, two team members dragged a woman before him. Zhou Weisen was deeply disappointed: she was indeed a big foreign mare, but clearly well past her prime. She was wrapped head to toe in heavy black skirts—he knew enough about European fashion to recognize this as widow's attire. A closer look at her face confirmed it: she had to be at least fifty.

Seeing that this was an expired foreign mare, Zhou Weisen lost all interest. With a wave of his hand, he had the team members take her away and stepped out of the sterncastle himself.

By then, the naval marine assault team reported to him: the entrances to the middle and lower decks had been secured, and Ah San was calling for surrender, but there was no response from below.

"Keep calling!" Zhou Weisen had just spoken when gunfire suddenly erupted on deck, white smoke billowing everywhere. The Spaniards below had fired a volley of matchlocks from the hatchway, then violently shoved open the wooden grating and swarmed up in a mass breakout attempt.

But their attempt was immediately crushed by the fierce return fire from the waiting marines. The seven or eight men who'd climbed out of the hatch barely got their upper bodies through before dense grapeshot shattered their skulls, killing them on the spot.

It seemed non-conventional measures would be necessary. Zhou Weisen didn't like using poison gas, and besides, several hundred sailors and soldiers would make decent laborers for the mines.

Zhou Weisen picked up his walkie-talkie and called Lin Chuanqing. "Old Lin, prepare the 'disinfectant'!"



"Acknowledged!"

As he spoke, he saw more team members half-dragging, half-supporting two more women out of the sterncastle. Zhou Weisen was amazed—what was going on with this ship? So many women!

He quickly asked: "What's going on here?"

"Sir! Found them in the lower cabin, hiding among the luggage."

Zhou Weisen looked them over. These two were young, but their faces showed the yellowish-white features of mixed blood—these must be American *criollos*—mixed-race descendants of Spanish conquistadors and indigenous women.

From their clothing, they didn't look like women of status—probably maids or the like. As he thought this, a strange fragrance suddenly wafted to his nostrils—the scent of perfume.

Zhou Weisen suddenly froze. Connecting this to the "crow" from earlier, he felt a surge of excitement. He gave a few instructions to the marine assault team captain, then headed back into the sterncastle with several men.

*I've been too slow—I should have realized!* he thought. That widow was obviously a *dueña*! Spanish high society always hired elderly widows to serve as companions and chaperones for young ladies or wives. Why else would a plainly dressed widow be crossing the ocean in the shipowner's cabin? And those two maids, the perfume on them—it all pointed to the same conclusion!

The shipowner's cabin in the sterncastle must have housed a young, high-born foreign mare! She must be hiding somewhere!

"All right, begin searching again!" Zhou Weisen ordered. "Go through every cabin carefully! Report any suspicious findings immediately!"

Before long, a young woman was brought before him. She wore a magnificent gown made of some silky material he'd never seen before, embroidered with gold thread and other elaborate patterns. In her hands she clutched a folding fan. From her appearance, she was a woman of high society—probably the family member of a high Spanish official or nobleman in New Spain or the Philippine colonies.

Zhou Weisen estimated her age at around twenty. She had a petite figure, with brown hair arranged in small ringlets cascading from her temples. Her frightened brown eyes stared at the man before her in his strange clothing. The scent that reached his nostrils was the same perfume from the maids, only stronger and more exotic.

"Take her away." Zhou Weisen had no time to deal with her now—he had more pressing matters.

"Who's the captain? Bring him here."

Team members pushed forward a Spaniard with a large bump swelling on his head—courtesy of the merciless Ah San translator.

"How many people are still below?" Zhou Weisen demanded without preamble.

The captain had originally wanted to maintain his composure and say a few dignified words befitting his noble birth, but Ah San's earlier beating had left him dazed and disoriented. Facing these strange pirates with their bizarre ship, he decided honesty was the best policy.

"When we departed Acapulco, we had 412 people. At the last roll call three days ago, there were still 375."

"How many soldiers are aboard?"

"We embarked a company at New Spain—90 men. How many remain, I don't know."

"Why didn't you surrender just now? You'd already raised the white flag." Zhou Weisen said menacingly. "Do you know the consequences of false surrender? I'll have every one of you hanged from the mast!"

"Please, do not insult my honor!" Though his hands were bound, the captain maintained his noble bearing. "I gave the order to surrender, but Lieutenant Alvarado refused to comply..."

"Who's Alvarado?"

"The company commander. A restless young gentleman of good family." The captain still looked shaken. "He even tried to seize the sterncastle—it was terrifying!"
