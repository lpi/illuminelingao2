# Chapter 1088 - All the Cards

The bombardment not only wiped out the entire rebel Red Barbarian artillery team but also saw several shells land amidst the dense rebel troops waiting nearby to attack, instantly killing fifty or sixty people and injuring over a hundred. The ground was covered with fragments of corpses and blood, and the screams of the wounded rose one after another.

The rebel troops, who had barely finished lining up, fell into chaos. Some refugees turned around and wanted to flee. Fortunately, shells did not continue to fall. Mao Chenglu's subordinates blocked them on all sides and beheaded more than a dozen people before maintaining the formation.

Mao Chenglu looked extremely ugly—although these few shots didn't kill many people, destroying the Red Barbarian artillery team, this assistance, greatly increased the difficulty of him capturing the stockade.

What surprised him most was the power of the opponent's artillery. He had seen explosive shells before, but never with such formidable power—even the large "Ten Thousand Men Enemy" (*Wanren Di*) used for defending cities, which required two people to move, was not as formidable as the explosive shells fired just now. Not to mention cannonballs.

The explosive shells that the Great Ming army could fire were actually a kind of poison gas shell: the shell contained a small amount of gunpowder as a detonator, and the rest was mainly sulfur, lime, and many toxic traditional Chinese medicines like croton. After exploding, smoke diffused; another kind was indeed a grenade, but the charge was very small, and it just broke into two halves after landing. Neither was as powerful as firing solid shots or grapeshot. So they were not used too widely.

It seemed that the opponent's bird guns were not only sharp, but even their cannons were far superior to his side—Mao Chenglu was secretly worried in his heart. Now that the enemy had ceased fire, evidently they had fired too much just now and must rest the guns.

Cannons of the 16th and 17th centuries, due to limited technology in smelting and casting, had low barrel strength, so the barrel weight was large, and the rate of fire was not high. At most 12-15 rounds were fired per hour, and no more than 60-80 rounds per day. This was under the condition of being equipped with a large amount of vinegar for forced cooling.

Mao Chenglu didn't know the quality of the opponent's cannons. The dense artillery fire just now made him think that the opponent's cannons must have entered the heat dissipation stage, which happened to be an excellent opportunity for his side to launch an assault.

"Beat the drums!" He ordered loudly, "First wave, up!"

The drums sounded rapidly. The refugee soldiers of the first wave began to stir—they had been scared out of their wits by the dense artillery fire just now. The little bit of courage they had mustered was long gone. Many people originally only had the courage of blood and qi incited for a moment. When death was presented before them so simply and bloodily, almost everyone showed a shrinking gesture.

More than a thousand people, squeezing together, just refused to move forward.

The rebel soldiers had experience with this long ago. Without needing an order, as soon as the second drum roll sounded, the supervising rebel soldiers raised their big sabers and beheaded several people at the tail of the column.

"Those who don't advance, behead!" With screams coming from behind and the roars of the supervisors, the crowd at the tail began to surge forward, forcing those in front to also start advancing.

On the Willow Palisade fortress, reports came from everywhere that the cannons were ready and could open fire at any time.

Chen Sigen raised his telescope: the first wave composed of refugees had already stepped onto the sandbar. Watching the messy crowd surging densely towards the Willow Palisade, that wretched state of being forced to go to their deaths made him feel increasingly unbearable. But at this time, the gun positions had designated targets. He hesitated for a moment and ordered: "Fire!"

With a signal rocket rising, all cannons of the Willow Palisade fortress and the Qimu Island detachment fleet fired simultaneously. Because the targets had been designated with range tables, the first round of shells hit the target area accurately.

The target aimed at this time was the rear of the refugees. That is to say, the artillery did not directly strike the refugees rushing at the very front, but shelled the large body of troops waiting behind to join the assault. Chen Sigen hoped to use this method to directly force the rebels to rout and kill as few people as possible.

The sound of cannons alarmed Mao Chenglu and his subordinate generals who were observing the formation: What, the opponent opened fire again? How many cannons do they have?

Just as thoughts turned, they saw many smoke trails emitted from the island battery and the bay again, flying towards the shore. However, this time the shells did not fall directly but burst in mid-air, instantly spraying dozens to hundreds of small iron balls towards the ground.

Pellets like a rainstorm shot continuously. Wherever they went, flesh and blood flew, severed limbs scattered, and those hitting the ground also sprayed up dust half a person high. Not to mention those coerced refugees without organization or training in front of the formation routed immediately, even the rebel combat soldiers preparing to join the battle subsequently were terrified and fled in all directions. Some people rolled directly from the sandbar onto the ice surface, fleeing madly towards the shore.

Mao Chenglu's face was pale. Dengzhou gunners were known as the strongest in the Ming army, regarding both rate of fire and fire density, but in his current feeling, the opponent's artillery fire was like a continuous stream, never stopping.

Waves of iron ball rainstorms swept across the already disintegrating formation. Crying, shouting, screaming, and meaningless shrieks in panic filled the air. Even in those military formations not yet affected, many soldiers were in commotion, trembling with fear.

The first wave that had approached the Willow Palisade was awed by this artillery fire. Although only a few shells fell on their heads, everyone turned back and fled together coincidentally. Even the supervising rebel soldiers couldn't care about waving sabers to kill for supervision, and ran away together wrapped in the crowd. Countless tatters were left on the sandbar instantly.

Here in the central army, Mao Chenglu's house guards and combat soldiers were in commotion. Fear had risen in everyone's heart: killing with swords and spears, these veteran army ruffians were not afraid, but standing like this, being beaten to death alive without even seeing what the enemy looked like, this feeling was truly desperate.

Mao Chenglu and others looked extremely ugly. Although this burst of artillery fire only disrupted the formation of thousands of refugees, and not many rebel combat soldiers were killed or wounded, seeing nearly ten thousand people fall into chaos as soon as the opponent opened fire, this battle probably couldn't be fought anymore.

Many people was an advantage, but also a disadvantage. Mao Chenglu understood this principle. If this "army of one hundred thousand" really fell into chaos, he was afraid he would be trampled to death even if he ran away.

With an ashen face, he waved his horse whip: "House guard squad, up! Tidy up this group of mobsters and tell them to continue charging!"

The house guards quickly galloped out, intercepting the routed soldiers everywhere. Refugees were easy to handle; being unarmed, they had to stop and wait for reorganization after house guards beheaded a few. Those old army ruffians were not so easy to deal with. They hesitated not to wave sabers to resist, and in many places, they started fighting among themselves.

On Qimu Island, many village braves of the Advance Column were helping move ammunition on the Willow Palisade fortress. They had never seen the power of big cannons. Although many people knew the master's "bird guns" were incomparably sharp, a bird gun was just a bird gun after all. They didn't expect the big cannons to be even more powerful. Fighting twenty or thirty shots made the opponent routed, unable to even approach. The entire fortress was instantly beaming with smiles, cheering loudly.

Just then, someone hurriedly arrived and reported important news to him.

The observation post just found through the battery telescope that the rebel central army location was at azimuth 4471.

Chen Sigen looked at the planning board and raised the telescope again: this place was a bit far from Qimu Island, a full 1800 meters in straight-line distance. In this spacetime, no cannon could shoot to such a far place. It seemed Mao Chenglu had a lot of tricks. Chen Sigen thought. He ordered again: "Cease fire, all guns load explosive shells, target azimuth 4471 in five minutes!" Then he added, "Prepare for rapid fire!"

The distance increased to 1800 meters. Although it was still within the effective range of all guns, accuracy was greatly discounted at a long distance. Chen Sigen decided to execute rapid fire, projecting a large number of shells to the target position at one time, so that Mao Chenglu and his central army would be completely covered before they could react.

While cannons rumbled here on Qimu Island, Chen Guangfu's five hundred men had quietly arrived at a forest by Longkou Bay. Choosing this place as the starting position was well thought out by Chen Guangfu: going down to the ice surface from this small forest, until rushing onto Qimu Island, although the journey was longer than other locations, the ice surface was solid, suitable for horse movement.

The speed of marching on horseback was very fast, so it didn't matter even if it was half a *li* or one *li* longer. If they encountered ice crevices on the way forward, it would cause great trouble.

Five hundred riders held their breath one by one, just waiting for his order.

Gunfire came constantly from the sandbar side. Chen Guangfu rejoiced secretly: Fighting started over there! He immediately ordered:

"Brothers, up!" Saying this, he whipped his horse and was the first to dash out of the forest.

Five hundred riders surged out of the forest almost simultaneously, pouring onto the ice surface of Longkou Bay.

Horse hooves boiled, snow smoke rose in bursts. Five hundred riders were like arrows leaving the string, shooting towards the soft underbelly of Qimu Island.

The shrill alarm sounded on Qimu Island almost simultaneously. Zhu Mingxia, who had been sitting on the ground with the soldiers, stood up abruptly. He glanced at the signal station; the flags hung out indicated that the other party was coming from the west of Qimu Island.

"Beat the drums!" He shouted.

 rapid combat readiness drums sounded. Soldiers who were originally sitting cross-legged on the ground resting all stood up, hurriedly fastening their hat straps and checking weapons while patting dust off their bodies.

Four companies instantly entered combat readiness. Zhu Mingxia said in a deep voice: "Light Infantry Company, Battle Line 3rd and 4th Companies follow me in company columns, Grenadier Company as reserve! All companies run!"

Three companies quickly moved to the shore—this was all sandy beach, very suitable for enemy landing, so barbed wire and abatis had been laid on the frozen beach in advance. The three companies led by Zhu Mingxia rushed to the shore.

"Deploy into double-line column by company!" He was the first to arrive at the shore and saw cavalry galloping on the ice surface—so the enemy's backhand was here. Zhu Mingxia thought.

"Sight 300 meters, prepare to fire!" He raised one hand, observing the movement of the cavalry, "Fire!"
