# Chapter 822 - Closing the Case Without Closing It

"Yes, it wouldn't be good if she got broken..." Li Yan added, then suddenly realized Zhou Dongtian didn't mean that. He quickly clarified, "So she played herself right into being a captive in Lingao—"

Zhou Dongtian chuckled and patted his shoulder. He handed the file to Li Yan: "She belongs to Intelligence now. I think she'll cooperate with your work in the future."

"Good." Li Yan nodded. The Intelligence Bureau had wanted to conduct a special investigation into the Ming internal security and intelligence systems. They had commissioned the Grand Library to search historical records and notes, and gathered information by interrogating captives and interviewing Ming gentry. Staff captured during the Chengmai Campaign provided considerable data: some hearsay, some personal experience. But this was external data—now having a family member/temporary worker, she should know the internal status and operations of the Brocade Clad Guard better than others.

The External Intelligence Bureau immediately issued a notice to all field departments, listing Huang Shunlong as "Dangerous" and his shop and residence as locations with severe threat—Lin Ming lost his sister-in-law in Macau; he would definitely focus on the Huang family. A squad of Brocade Clad Guards might be ambushing outside the Huang home right now.

"Although cutting off contact with the Huang family is a major loss, we must guard against desperate moves. Whether for public or private reasons, that Company Commander Lin will definitely try to kidnap an Elder directly to find out our details, or try to exchange captives with us," Jiang Shan said.

Li Yongxun met the three-person team led by the woman again, still waiting expressionlessly.

She was hooded again and put on a carriage. After some bumping, the hood was removed—Li Yongxun blinked. This was a quiet compound with high walls covered in climbing plants blooming with pink flowers large and small. It looked rather eerie.

Several multi-story buildings similar to the Franks' stood in the yard. But not as nice as Frankish houses. Windows were glazed but fitted with sturdy wooden bars. Nothing could be seen from outside.

A new fear invaded her heart: What is this place? Is it a Thief prison? It looked different from the Ming's, but the severe, cold atmosphere was familiar to her since childhood.

This was the "Study Class" of the Political Security Bureau, effectively the PSB's dedicated detention center. In the Transmigration Regime's system...

"In!" Ke Yun urged her. Li Yongxun had no choice but to ascend the steps. The double iron doors opened, and a cripple came out—a wooden leg showed under one pant leg. This man also wore a front-button jacket and the same blue shoulder strips as the female thief.

"One person for processing, name Li Yongxun, sex female!" Ke Yun handed the document to him. The two busied themselves signing and stamping at the table by the door for a while before the crippled man took out a ring of keys.

"Where to?"

"Zone 1."

The crippled man opened an iron gate in the vestibule. Behind it was a long corridor with doors on left and right, all closed. He led them through three or four turns, across a courtyard, through several more iron gates, finally stopping at a door.

"Here."

Li Yongxun found herself in a plain, tidy room containing only a bed, a table, and two chairs. The walls were whitewashed, the floor wooden. The window was high, extravagantly glazed, letting in bright sunlight. On the table were the four treasures of the study and a notebook made of white paper.

"This is your room," the crippled guard said. "Toilets and showers are at the end of the hall. You can walk freely in the corridor. Just don't go out the iron gate." He pointed to the iron gate at the other end. "Pull the rope if you need something; someone will come." With that, he limped out. Only Ke Yun remained with her.

"You'll live here. Rest a bit; someone will talk to you in a few days."

"Talk about what?" Li Yongxun didn't know what medicine the Thieves were selling in their gourd. It looked like "house arrest," which let her relax slightly.

Ke Yun didn't answer her question: "There's paper and pen; write a self-statement first."

"Self-statement?"

"Yes. Start from yourself. Where born, who parents are, what background, literate or not, what books read since childhood... write it all out."

"Why write this?!" Li Yongxun was baffled.

"This is a sample." Ke Yun pointed to a booklet on the table. "Read it once, and you'll know how to write."

"This lady is illiterate! Won't write!"

"You'd better be literate," Ke Yun sneered. "Or I'll invite someone to help you write..."

"I'll write, I'll write," Li Yongxun knew what that meant and yielded immediately. "No need for help."

While Li Yongxun buried her head in writing materials in the PSB Study Class, Lin Ming was hiding in an inn in Sanshui County, agonizing over how to report the investigation results of Gao Shunqin's disappearance.

Censor Gao's disappearance had become a complete cold case in Guangzhou. After empty searches in Macau, Lin Ming had to return to Guangzhou dejectedly—to avoid too much external influence in Guangzhou, he went to Sanshui County under the guise of investigating and stayed there.

By now he was convinced the Short-haired Thieves were the mastermind behind Gao Shunqin's disappearance, and Li Yongxun's disappearance was likely related. But the current attitude of Guangzhou officialdom toward the Aussies was "peace." If he tactlessly jumped out claiming the Thieves were the black hand, he'd be giving the Governor a problem—an important official trapped in Lingao, and Guangdong officials ignore it? Going to war meant death; Guangdong dared not fight. Even arresting the soon-to-return Aussie big merchant Boss Guo for a hostage exchange—Governor Li wouldn't dare. That would mean preparing for a second burning of the Wuyang relay station.

If he reported it like that, he'd offend Li Fengjie and Guangdong officialdom to death.

Lin Ming gritted his teeth and thought for a long time, finally deciding to hold his nose and speak along with Guangdong officialdom's wishes. Censor Gao would have to suffer for his country. Fortunately, so far, all evidence pointed his route north after leaving Guangzhou. Except for himself and the captured Li Yongxun, no one could offer concrete clues that the Thieves did it. His big search in Macau could be chalked up to "rumors"; the Aussies were at most "suspects."

As for his sister-in-law, she had to be saved—otherwise his wife wouldn't agree. Besides, he couldn't let outsiders get off cheap! But the government couldn't manage this; he had to handle it personally. Fortunately, with the Brocade Clad Guard badge and some reputation in the Company, mobilizing official resources wasn't too hard.

Plan set, Lin Ming feigned arranging searches everywhere, sending men to Nanxiong Prefecture with fanfare. In the end, Guangzhou's memorial to the court stated that Censor Gao left his post voluntarily, whereabouts unknown. According to reliable clues, he should have left Guangdong and entered Jiangxi. However, Guangdong was still "investigating with all effort," etc. A huge roll of case documents accompanied the memorial. Now, unless the court appointed a special investigator, the case was indefinitely delayed. Li Fengjie doubted the court would send anyone, or that they'd find anything if they did. With fire and smoke everywhere these years, the court might not have time to care.

Li Fengjie instructed subordinates to quietly give Lin Ming 3,000 taels as thanks, plus another 1,000 taels as rewards for his men. Except for Censor Gao's family, everyone was satisfied.

But Censor Gao's family was strongly dissatisfied with this outcome; Censor Gao "abandoning office and fleeing" was unbelievable. Gao's female relatives sent people to the Governor's Yamen repeatedly to complain but were dismissed with "under strict investigation." Theoretically, it was just a report; the Gao case wasn't formally closed, so Li Fengjie stalled them.

"The Gao family says they'll send someone to the capital to file an imperial plaint." Li Xijue told Li Fengjie in the office. He was worried things would get hard to handle if they blew up—true in all times and places. And the Gao family weren't commoners; they had significant influence.

Li Fengjie said unhurriedly: "Imperial plaint? Women's views! It's not like we kidnapped Lord Gao. Who will they sue? For what crime?"

"The East Lord is right, but Gao Shunqin has friends and classmates in the capital. If the Gao family lobbies them..."

"At most asking us to 'investigate again and report.' We haven't stopped investigating. Does the memorial say the case is closed?"

"It doesn't—" Li Fengjie didn't write the memorial, but key aides reviewed it before dispatch.

"If not, we are investigating. What can they say?" Li Fengjie smiled and picked up his book again.

Li Xijue knew his master's strategy was "stall"—stall until he left office.

"East Lord! Even so, the Gao family should be comforted slightly." Li Xijue had been dealing with Gao's relatives and knew they weren't easily dismissed—it wasn't about money.

"Mm." Li Fengjie considered. "Someone has to take responsibility. Prefect Yu told me Gao's family wanted him to do a few things, and he didn't dare agree due to Lord Gao's face. Now it seems Lord Gao won't return to Guangdong soon; tell Prefect Yu to do those things for them—it counts as investigating the case."
