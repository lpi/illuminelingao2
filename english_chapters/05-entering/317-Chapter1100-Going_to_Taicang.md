# Chapter 1100 - Going to Taicang

Gao Xuan drank the porridge and ate two *Youzhagui* (fried dough sticks), then looked reluctantly at the one belonging to Master Huang next to him. Master Huang always ate only one, saving the other to eat as a snack with tea in the afternoon.

Gao Xuan was young and had a good appetite after all; just one stick felt insufficient to sustain him, so he had to take a few more dried radishes and wrap them in paper, preparing to have them with tea in the afternoon.

The servants waited on them until they finished eating and collected the utensils. Everyone then got busy—some reviewing drafts, others writing. Gao Xuan was recruited as a creative writer, and his job was specifically to write novels for the *Classic of Mountains and Seas Pictorial*—and there was a specific topic: Zhao Yingong assigned him to write about strange phenomena. In the classification of the old spacetime, it would be fantasy novels.

Gao Xuan had never written a novel, but the Editorial Department had a library collecting various storytelling books since the Tang Dynasty. Most were bought by Zhao Yingong's people from bookstores in Nanjing and other places, and there were also some rare ones shipped from the Lingao printing house.

What interested Gao Xuan most were a few locked bookcases. These bookcases held "Australian Rare Editions" not seen outside. These books were not allowed to be borrowed and could only be read in the reference room; copying required a special application.

Among them, the one that attracted Gao Xuan the most was a sword immortal novel written by someone called "Master of the Huanzhu," which he simply couldn't put down—so much so that Gao Xuan would rush to the library to "study" every lunch break. The bookcase also contained many notebook novels specifically writing about ghosts and foxes. Among these, his favorites were the works of two "Australian Great Confucians," Ji Xiaolan and Pu Songling. Not only that, Gao Xuan often drew nutrients from their works. In fact, many of the so-called fantasy novels Gao Xuan wrote now were rewritten and expanded from these short stories.

Generally speaking, *Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio* (*Liaozhai Zhiyi*), *Notes from the Hut of Close Scrutiny* (*Yuewei Caotang Biji*), and *What the Master Would Not Discuss* (*Zi Bu Yu*) served as themes, while *Legend of the Swordsmen of Shu Mountains* and *Nineteen Swordsmen of Qingcheng* served as writing material and textbooks.

Gao Xuan spread out the square-grid manuscript paper dedicated to the publishing house and began to write his draft. His task was three thousand words a day, sixty thousand words a month: the magazine's demand was huge, and the texts he wrote could not only be published in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas Pictorial* but also used to print pamphlets. The Tianshui Society irregularly published a 16-kai pamphlet called *Story Session* (*Gushi Hui*), exclusively publishing various street news and ghost stories, entirely in vernacular Chinese and vulgar characters, which was very popular among citizens.

"Mr. Gao, tomorrow is the deadline for this issue. The Editor-in-Chief asks if your manuscript for 'Three Battles of Zombies in the Back Garden' can be ready by noon?" A child specifically responsible for running errands and passing messages for the editors came over to ask him—Zhao Yingong installed speaking tubes made of thick bamboo between floors to convey simple messages. But within the department, it relied on human messengers.

"Tell the Editor-in-Chief that I'll give him the first episode before noon. I think this project can be made into a serial."

Gao Xuan sent the child away and continued his Zombie War. Just as he wrote about the zombies rushing into the garden, the Green Bean Hero obtained the Repeater Grass, capable of firing four flying swords at a time, beating the zombies into flowing water and falling flowers. Suddenly, there was a loud roar outside, like a cannon shot, and a Red-eyed Giant Monster came from outside the wall...

He sighed as he wrote—although he didn't hate writing this, and earned a considerable income from it, finding himself feeding himself and his family with words for the first time, he ultimately felt that what he was doing was low-class and "insulting to gentility."

In comparison, he envied the "Editors" in the "Current Affairs Department" (*Shiwen Bu*) next door. As the name suggested, the old gentlemen in the Current Affairs Department were all masters of the Eight-legged Essay. Not only were their Eight-legged Essays written like clusters of flowers, but their trial examination poems also rhymed perfectly. Although these old gentlemen had "observed the field" several times and remained *Xiucai*, their writing and commentary on current affairs essays were brilliant. Therefore, Zhao Yingong hired them specifically to compile collections of current affairs essays, collecting all kinds of papers from the child examination, provincial examination, metropolitan examination, to palace examination for them to compile and critique.

Zhao Yingong gave a guiding speech to this group of old gentlemen. At that time, there were many famous masters compiling collections of current affairs essays. Although this group was brilliant, they couldn't compare with the appeal of those compiled by *Jinshi* and *Juren*. Therefore, Zhao Yingong suggested everyone take a unique approach: not just simply compiling and commenting on the winning papers, but also selecting some that didn't pass and analyzing why they didn't pass. Then, pick out some papers that everyone thought were good and should have passed but didn't, and publish a separate collection of comments. Every time there was an examination in the prefectural school, after the exam, *Tianshui Weekly* would also publish a special issue of current affairs essay commentary: containing analysis of exam questions, the life of the chief examiner, background environment analysis, etc.

These old gentlemen usually made a living from this, but their fame was limited, and their income was not high. Now that someone provided a special place, with good food and drink for them to do this, their sense of self-existence increased greatly, and they were full of enthusiasm. Every day, they could be heard reciting those current affairs essays with "Zhi Hu Zhe Ye."

Roughly, it was like the College Entrance Examination exercise sets or Civil Service Examination preparation materials of another spacetime.

However, no matter how insulting to gentility it was, strictly speaking, it didn't fall to the miserable level of ghostwriting letters for others. As for what he wrote in the Tianshui Society, he could simply avoid talking about it.

While the entire Tianshui Society was busy starting the day's work, Zhao Yingong had already boarded a boat to Taicang. Although the main figures of the Fushe were in Jiangnan and often gathered in Hangzhou, it was now the first lunar month. Except for Zhang Dai, Fang Yizhi, who had the best relationship with Wanbi Bookstore, had returned to his hometown in Tongcheng, and Sun Chun was in his home in Nanxun. Fortunately, he learned from Zhang Dai that Zhang Pu had returned from Beijing during the New Year and was at his home in Taicang.

Zhao Yingong hurriedly struck while the iron was hot and asked Zhang Dai to introduce him to Zhang Pu.

Zhang Dai was originally a lazy person, even less willing to move during the first lunar month. But usually frequenting the Wanbi Bookstore for leisure and gatherings, he felt he couldn't refuse, so he called his own boat and went to Taicang with Zhao Yingong.

Zhang Dai's boat was extremely exquisite: he was a person who valued enjoyment extremely, and even every grass and tree around him was carefully selected. Not only were the furnishings on the boat particular and the food exquisite, but even the serving maids and young servants were good-looking and understanding. However, Zhao Yingong had things on his mind, so how could he pay attention to these?

Seeing his solemn face and heavy heart along the way, Zhang Dai ordered a banquet to be set up on shore halfway through the mooring to drink and dispel his sorrow.

He was an extremely clever person. Although he usually witnessed Zhao Yingong's various "Australian-style" enjoyments in Wanbi Bookstore—which were truly incomparable even to imperial relatives—deep down, this Master Zhao, who vaguely claimed to be a descendant of the Zhao Song dynasty, was an extremely frugal person, probably not born into a wealthy family.

"Brother Yingong, this matter cannot be rushed," Zhang Dai probably knew the purpose of his trip was to help Sun Huodong, and comforted him, "Tianru (Zhang Pu) has always respected Grand Secretary Xu, and Sun Huodong is Grand Secretary Zhou's man. Presumably, he will definitely help."

Zhao Yingong smiled forcedly and nodded—the possibility of Zhang Pu helping was indeed very high, but did he really have the ability to sway public opinion? Even if he did, could swaying public opinion change the current court deliberations? These were all unknowns. He sighed immediately: "I am just doing my humanly best."

"Exactly, as long as one does their humanly best, the mandate of heaven cannot be violated," Zhang Dai laughed. "Sun Huodong's future has its own mandate of heaven. We are just ordinary mortals, how can we peek into the secrets of creation? Let's drink first!"

Zhao Yingong recalled his words and felt his mood change greatly. Instead of being anxious about whether the task could be completed, it was better to relax. He was just a transmigrator, not God. Even with cheats, he might not be invincible. Thinking of this, the lead weight that had been pressing on his heart, making him uninterested in doing anything, was lifted, and he felt relaxed. Looking at the winter scenery of Jiangnan slowly retreating outside the window, his interest in wine also arose abruptly.

"Good, let's drink," his mood relaxed, and his tone became brisk. "I wonder what good wine there is?"

"Naturally, there is Lanling wine..."

"That's not good," Zhao Yingong laughed. "I brought wine."

"Good, good," Zhang Dai was also very fond of wine—grape wine (wine) already existed in the Ming Dynasty, but it was an imported product enjoyed by a few. Even Zhang Dai rarely got it.

At that moment, Zhao Yingong instructed Feng Hua to bring out the wine he brought on the boat.

The wine was in a glass bottle, the crimson liquid flowing with light and color inside. Zhang Dai had drunk it at Wanbi Bookstore and knew this was the highest grade "Australian Wine," which was actually brewed by Xue Ziliang and Wu Nanhai at the farm when they had nothing to do.

Lingao couldn't grow wine grapes, so they used table grapes. The taste was sweet and sour, more suitable for the taste of people at that time.

Seeing the wine brought out, the maid immediately took out a set of "Australian Crystal Glasses" to pour wine for them. This set of glasses was specially bought by Zhang Dai from Zizhenzhai in Guangzhou through someone.

"I wonder what there is to go with the wine?" Zhao Yingong asked.

The maid serving at the side hurried replied: "There is duck."

Saying this, she set up cups and chopsticks, first serving small dishes for wine. Then warm dishes were served: a small porcelain jar with clear-stewed duck soup inside. The duck meat was fresh, tender, and smooth, and the soup was fragrant and mellow. A plate of lees-steamed whitefish; no wine lees were visible, but the fragrance of lees assailed the nose. There were a few slices of young ginger on the fish, and it tasted incredibly fresh and tender. It was done very brilliantly. The enjoyment of an aristocratic family was indeed extraordinary.

The two drank and talked, discussing mostly matters within the Fushe. Zhang Dai didn't like discussing court politics and state affairs, but he was quite interested in discussing the personnel within the society. Zhao Yingong intended to collect more information on the Fushe, so he didn't interrupt him.

From Zhang Dai's mouth, he learned many details about the establishment and holding of meetings of the Fushe, as well as the political aspirations, personalities, and relationships of the main figures in the Fushe. This was extremely useful material for his future work in the court.

Zhang Dai drank a few cups and was already slightly tipsy: farm wine had a lot of white sugar added as an auxiliary for fermentation because it was brewed from table grapes, so it went down easily but the alcohol content was not low.

When asked about Zhao Yingong's future plans, Zhang Dai advised him to try to falsely claim a native place in Jiangnan to participate in the provincial examination.
