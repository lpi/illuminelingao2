# Chapter 941 – Drunken Talk

Hai Lin calmed himself and said: "Production orders." The entire body of naturalized citizen cadres rose in unison, awaiting Hai Lin's commands.

"One: Effective immediately, the braiding, rattan, and bamboo workshops are to cease production. All personnel will reinforce the bandsaw workshop and drying workshop."

"Two: Effective immediately, except for halted workshops, all production workshops will work overtime in two shifts, with each shift extended to twelve hours—twenty-four-hour production."

"Three: The production director, all workshop supervisors, and all workers in the machine repair shop will be on duty around the clock."

"Four: Strengthen safety management and strengthen production management. Bandsaw replacement intervals will be cut in half. The drying workshop will strengthen fire prevention procedures."

After the announcements, the production director asked tremulously:

"Chief, what about Kiln No. 3 that broke down?"

"What else? Shut it down for a major overhaul!" Hai Lin replied irritably.

"But that would leave only two drying kilns. The production schedule was already behind; now we're losing a third of our drying capacity." The production director reminded him.

"I know, I know." Of course Hai Lin knew the dire situation he faced, but letting Kiln No. 3 run with minor repairs would only make problems worse—it might even be scrapped entirely. Besides, he felt this was a chance to put some pressure on the Executive Committee, so they wouldn't keep thinking the wood products factory was low-tech and refuse to invest.

He thought of the steam drying kiln he had been applying for in reports for almost half a year. The kiln structure was nearly complete, but because the required boilers, piping, and blowers hadn't been allocated, it had been in a state of semi-suspension.

Superheated steam drying kilns were far more efficient and had a much higher pass rate than fire kilns. Hai Lin had long wanted to upgrade the technology.

Applying a little pressure might wake them up, Hai Lin thought. Putting on a solemn expression, he said:

"If we don't shut down for repairs and an accident happens, what then? Damage to production capacity is minor, but production safety incidents are major problems! We must learn lessons from the bandsaw workshop accident! Lessons, lessons!"

Seeing the chief put on such a pained expression, the production director was somewhat surprised but didn't dare say more. He immediately went to arrange the shutdown and maintenance.

Hai Lin called after him: "Send someone from the machine repair shop to check Kiln No. Zero. Try to get it running again tomorrow."

"Understood!"

After the meeting, Hai Lin toured the workshops. First was the sawmill. The large sawmill had two gang saws—fourteen blades each; four bandsaws, five circular saws, one balance crosscut saw bed, one parquet strip saw, and one file saw. In addition to these, the entire sawmill was equipped with many timber and woodworking machines—some brought from the old timeline, some produced by the machinery factory. All machinery was driven by steam engines, thunderously roaring, occasionally punctuated by shrill screams when cutting stock.

For easy cleaning, all workers in the workshop sported very short buzz cuts; some had shaved heads. They all wore woven rattan safety helmets and masks—the workshop had serious dust problems and was thus a priority fire and explosion prevention area. Hai Lin, of course, knew the hazards of dust explosions, so upon entering he checked whether protective measures were in place.

After finishing his inspection, Hai Lin checked the progress and randomly inspected the quality of planks coming out—the locally produced bandsaws' performance was gradually improving, but still couldn't match old-timeline products. When would the metallurgy department produce alloy steel materials?

Besides the timber processing equipment, the wood products factory also had timber dry-distillation kilns, tanning extract workshops, rope workshops, and other supporting operations. Not only could they produce planks, furniture, and timber components of various sizes and specifications, but they also manufactured wood tar, tanning extract, charcoal, and various other forest products. Essentially nothing was wasted when logs entered the factory. Their capacity for processing raw materials was extremely powerful by the standards of this time.

But within the entire Lingao industrial system, the wood products factory's processing capacity was still woefully inadequate.

The wood products factory was now concentrating on manufacturing prefabricated building components, rifle stocks, standardized supply crates of various sizes, and ship materials. Every operating workshop Hai Lin saw was in the heat of production. He felt some regret—due to the lack of cheap, suitable adhesives, they still couldn't produce composite boards like plywood, leaving wood utilization one notch lower. Especially the large quantities of wood shavings and scraps produced during processing could only be used as fuel for the drying kilns for now, not fully utilized. The lack of adhesives also kept timber processing at a relatively low level. Both composite board and blockboard required adhesives.

He made a special visit to the drying workshop to check the kilns. The three kilns currently in use at the wood products factory were all periodic flue-heated natural-circulation drying kilns, heated by furnace gas. These kilns had drawbacks: uneven drying, long drying cycles, and low throughput. But they were simple in structure and equipment, requiring no power or fans. So under Lingao's "more, faster, better" industrial philosophy, they got the earliest use.

As for Kiln No. Zero, it was an even older smoke-fumigation drying kiln. It directly heated wood with smoke from smoldering sawdust. Not only simpler in structure, but also straightforward to operate. The wood products factory's first kiln had been this type. Because smoke-fumigation kilns were hard to control temperature-wise and prone to fires, it had been decommissioned a year ago.

Back at his office, his life secretary brought him a bowl of iced mung bean porridge. He listened as she reported in a soft voice the menu for tonight's dinner party hosting Wu Kuangming: old-timeline common dishes—sauerkraut fish, chili chicken, mapo tofu...

Hai Lin felt the money spent on this A-grade life secretary was well worth it—of course, his luck during the lottery had been good too. Many transmigrators had only purchased C-grade life secretaries, reasoning there'd be plenty of opportunities later and maid education would only improve, no need to pay for an experimental product. But Hai Lin didn't see it that way. As a former senior member of the "fap squad," Hai Lin was very particular about maids: no need to economize on the woman sharing his bed. The highest grade available this time was A. If there had been an S-grade, Hai Lin would have unhesitatingly paid for it.

This reasonably pretty maid attended to his eating and drinking by day and followed orders in bed at night. Hai Lin felt a surge of heat—he'd been working late and waking before dawn for days, was truly exhausted, and hadn't "blessed" his maid for several days. If only his office weren't so shabby, he'd really like to try some office training.

Hai Lin worked until dark before returning to his quarters. His life secretary had prepared food and drinks. He called Wu Kuangming, who said he was already at the door.

Wu Kuangming, as the People's Commissar for Forestry, was also very busy these days. The Forestry Department's workload was heavy. The Executive Committee had been shortsighted earlier, thinking timber was just a transitional product. Now they discovered that timber's uses weren't limited to construction and furniture—more importantly, there were military products. Before engineering plastics, rifles always used wooden stocks. And ammunition crates, even in the 21st century, were still mainly made of wood. Massive military needs had suddenly increased pressure on the Forestry Department.

"Hai Lin, at today's meeting someone suggested transferring your factory to the military industry system, under Lin Shenhe's management. I shot it down." Wu Kuangming raised his wine cup, but before drinking said this.

"Where the hell were they earlier? A few days ago, Lin Shenhe went to Director Zhan through the Military Affairs Bureau, saying since the wood products factory handles large amounts of military production, it should count as a military enterprise and be managed by the Military Industry Department. Director Zhan shot that down too." Hai Lin clinked glasses with Wu Kuangming and took a sip of rum.

"Now the wood products factory is a thorn in the Military Industry Department's side. Without stocks, no matter how many barrels they make, they're useless. Rifle production can't go up. Lin Shenhe's running around frantically. The Military Affairs Bureau has raised placing the wood products factory under military control at Executive Committee meetings multiple times." Wu Kuangming couldn't help but look worried. The Forestry Department's largest division was the wood products factory. If it was transferred to the Military Industry Department, then he as Forestry Commissioner would have nothing to do except tree planting, registering and managing state forest lands, and issuing hunting permits.

"Don't worry. Those guys in the Military Industry Department only know how to play with iron. What do they know about wood? Take rifle stocks—in China, the best material is Manchurian catalpa—walnut wood. Second best is white birch and red birch. Hainan has none of these. Wasn't it the two of us working day and night to find the current substitute, green phoebe?" Hai Lin said unconcernedly. In fact, Zhan Wuya also knew the wood products factory's importance, but previously Ma Qianzhu had managed that area and he hadn't had a say.

"If we hadn't found ironwood, those steamships wouldn't be running!" Wu Kuangming said. "They talk about making Babbitt alloy, but nothing's happened. They still have to rely on wood!"

"Babbitt alloy? They can't even make alloy steel for saw blades!" Hai Lin was getting fired up too.

"Damn it. At the last Manufacturing Supervision meeting, I said the wood products factory's current situation is the Executive Committee's doing. They never paid attention; thought wood could be cut down and immediately made into rifles. From raw logs entering the factory, to planks, to drying, to turning, fitting, milling, planing, and polishing—without forty-five days, don't expect any product." The Forestry Department under Wu Kuangming had long been deeply dissatisfied with Ma Qianzhu because of the Executive Committee's neglect of forestry.

"Heh heh, actually timber has always been a national strategic material. In the early years of the PRC, walnut wood wasn't allowed for export because it was used for making gun stocks. Even after engineering plastics came out, many types of wood still couldn't be exported. What do those 'multi-rivet steam-steel' guys know? They had us making straw hats in bulk to earn them silver, even though we warned them long ago about timber's importance. Now they regret it. Too late." Hai Lin took a bite of food—his A-grade secretary really was not bad looking, and she made good chili chicken too.
