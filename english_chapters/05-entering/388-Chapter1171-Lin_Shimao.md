# Chapter 1171 - Lin Shimao

Of course, the focus of their reconnaissance was Lin Shimao's gambling den and residence. Neither was in a prosperous district. To get a clear picture of Lin Shimao's behavioral patterns, Chen Tianxiong had already sent someone to quietly investigate his routine.

Lin Shimao rested at home during the day and didn't go to the gambling den until after the lamps were lit in the evening. The distance between the two locations was about a ten-minute walk. But he never walked—he always took a sedan chair. Lin Shimao was a man who got things done and carried weight in the county, but running a gambling den and loan-sharking for years had ruined countless families. Naturally, there was no shortage of people seeking revenge on him. And there were even more "heroes" who wanted to take his gambling den by killing him and making a name for themselves. Lin Shimao couldn't afford not to be careful. Not only did he travel by sedan chair, but he was also flanked by seven or eight burly bodyguards at all times.

Qian Shuixie felt that ambushing him on the road wouldn't work—too much commotion, and with their small numbers, they couldn't control the escape routes. If the city gates closed, they'd have to fight their way out, which would inevitably cause major civilian casualties and their own losses. Capturing Lin Shimao was just a low-cost side operation; Anping was the big fish. Mass bloodshed in Jinjiang would be putting the cart before the horse.

In the special recon team's urban operations, city walls and gates had always been a troublesome problem—creating considerable difficulty for both infiltration and extraction.

"We'll have to snatch him from his bed," Qian Shuixie said. "Go directly into the residence or gambling den and drag him out."

"Best to grab him at the residence," Xu Ke said. "Too many people at the gambling den; hard to make a move there."

But that meant acting during the day. The advantage of daytime action was that after success, they could quickly leave the city; the disadvantage was that daytime approach and entry were hard to conceal and easy to detect.

After much deliberation, they finally decided to act at night. Once successful, they would go directly over the city wall and get him to the temple. As long as they got out of the city, transportation would be easy.

"I've had people scout the gambling den's layout—quite similar to the one in Leizhou," Chen Tianxiong said, producing a floor plan. "The first section is the public gambling hall, open to all. The second section is for those with some status—you need an introduction to enter; strangers can't get in..." He pointed on the map. "Our people couldn't get into the third section. I estimate it's for the accounting office and such. Lin Shimao is very likely in there, but we don't have enough information about the third section."

"Does he come out at night?"

"He does—about once an hour to make rounds and play a few hands. But lately he's been coming out less, and when he does, he always has several bodyguards."

"Looks like someone warned him," Xu Ke said.

The courtyard walls were very high, and the back door used thick wooden planks reinforced with iron sheeting. Under normal circumstances, it would be barred with door bolts and bracing poles—without explosives, there was no way to break through. Because gambling dens often had large amounts of cash flowing in and out, all "black money" that couldn't be reported to the authorities, they took theft prevention very seriously.

After some discussion, they decided to tunnel directly from outside the back courtyard into the third section. Chinese-style buildings all followed "building codes"—the better the house, the more rigorous the construction. Though they hadn't personally surveyed the third section's structure, they estimated it would be consistent with similar courtyards. As for Lin Shimao's location, he would most likely be in the east or west wing rooms of the third section—when the gambling den was operating, he would almost certainly be in the accounting office watching the money flow, unlikely to be in the main hall.

As dusk fell, the sea breeze gradually strengthened, and the originally hot streets slowly cooled. With the night watch drum announcing first watch, pedestrians on the streets gradually thinned.

Darkness deepened, and soon the streets were deserted. Just after the first beat of the third watch, clusters of shadowy figures quietly climbed over the inn's back wall and made their way swiftly through the back alleys, circling past the county yamen and slipping into the residential district south of County Front Street. Threading through back streets and alleys, they stopped in a small lane behind the gambling den.

This was a narrow back alley, pitch black, permeated by the nauseating stench of urine mixed with garbage. Everything was silent; only when they stopped to listen could they faintly hear laughter through the courtyard walls.

Xu Ke learned from Chen Tianxiong that this poor alley had few residents—only some very poor commoners lived here. They had no interest in getting involved in anything.

He stood listening for a moment, confirming that the gambling den's back courtyard wall was right here. Chen Tianxiong's map was extremely accurate; even without a guide, he could have led the team to the precise location using his night-vision goggles.

"The back door is over there," Qian Shuixie whispered.

"That's the door he mentioned?"

"That's right. I've verified it—all the surrounding features match what he described."

Xu Ke checked his watch.

"Let's go." It was already past midnight. The night was very still, with only the sound of the wind and occasional distant dog barking.

Qian Shuixie made a hand signal: "Move!"

Several special recon team members approached the wall and found a spot to start tunneling.

This technique had been taught by a gang of thieves the Police Bureau had caught in Lingao: unless the foundation was stone blocks, even a wall of ground-fitted bricks joined with glutinous rice mortar could have a hole dug through it.

The special recon team took great interest in this technique. While climbing walls was certainly fast, many wealthy households had guards who kept especially careful watch over rooftops and wall-tops. If they happened to encounter guards on their rounds, stealth could easily turn into a frontal assault. To quickly and quietly eliminate targets, the special recon team lacked silencers for automatic weapons. Crossbow bolts were too slow; you could only get off one shot in an emergency.

After several practice sessions and document research, Xue Ziliang and Bei Wei developed a specialized set of wall-breaching tools. All made of high-quality carbon steel, they were not only hard and durable but also more efficient than what the thieves had used.

Two team members took the wall-breaching tools and approached the wall. Using scraping knives, they lightly scored the lime mortar between the bricks, carefully scratching and scraping along the mortar joints. They had to apply force without making noise. When they'd worked the mortar deep enough around one brick to see gaps, one team member gripped a hooked pry bar with both hands, inserted the pig's-hoof-shaped tip into the excavated mortar joint, and gave a gentle upward pry. The brick came loose. Another team member carefully pulled the brick out, handed it off, then gently placed it on the ground as if it were fragile porcelain.

Qian Shuixie halted the excavation. He donned infrared night-vision goggles and carefully peered through the hole left by the removed brick, scanning the courtyard to ensure no hostiles were present at the breach location.
