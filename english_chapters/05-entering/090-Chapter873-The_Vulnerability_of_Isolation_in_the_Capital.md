# Chapter 873 - The Vulnerability of Isolation in the Capital

"There won't be more tribute payments, will there?" Leng Ningyun remained fixated on this point.

Wu Kaidi laughed. "The terms have already been settled. Some routine demands are probably unavoidable—small sums, nothing for the Master to worry about. But there are certain things the Master should keep in mind. You can't wait for people to ask for everything."

He enumerated examples: though they had agreed on the three festivals and two tribute days, one had to constantly monitor developments at Eunuch Yang's residence. Small gifts should be sent every few days as gestures of respect. Fruit in winter, ice in summer. When Eunuch Yang's concubine celebrated her birthday, gifts absolutely must be sent—

"Eunuch Yang is a eunuch, and he has concubines?" Leng Ningyun frowned.

"Many eunuchs keep concubines," Wu Kaidi explained. "Eunuch Yang has several, and Concubine Bian is the most favored—gifts for her should be especially generous."

The question of how eunuchs made use of their concubines became one of Leng Ningyun's unresolved mysteries. But at the moment, far more pressing matters demanded his attention.

Three days later, Leng Ningyun prepared four modest gift items and went to pay his respects at Eunuch Yang's residence. This time, the eunuch was warmth itself, every inch the gracious elder. Palace eunuchs who had risen to prominence were all old foxes who had honed their skills to perfection. They possessed a remarkable talent for winning people over through manner alone. If Leng Ningyun hadn't been a modern person who'd received thorough education at the Farm and understood the nature of eunuchs completely, he would certainly have been charmed.

At the banquet, Eunuch Yang introduced his adopted son, Yang Tianliang. Leng Ningyun didn't dare be casual and showed great deference to this young Eunuch Yang.

Both parties toasted each other merrily. When they had reached about seventy or eighty percent drunk, Eunuch Yang finally spoke his mind:

"This humble eunuch grows old and must remain on duty at the palace at all times. I rarely have free moments. In the future, if business arises, my adopted son's word carries equal weight. Don't come to my residence lightly. When there's business, I'll send someone to fetch you."

"Yes, I shall follow Eunuch Yang's every command." Leng Ningyun replied respectfully. Eunuch Yang was actually only in his fifties, yet he appeared far older. His hair had turned entirely white, and his face was deeply furrowed with wrinkles.

"Hehe, having drained this cup together, this humble eunuch no longer considers you an outsider." Eunuch Yang reclined lazily against his chair. Two young eunuchs, heads bowed, massaged his legs and shoulders respectively. He issued several comfortable grunts before continuing. "What you people are doing over in Qiongzhou Prefecture—this humble eunuch doesn't know and doesn't wish to know. But you should understand: this is Beijing, the capital, the model for the realm right beneath the Son of Heaven. Even the dogs running in the streets might be drawing a salary. This isn't your Guangdong, that southern barbarian region far from heaven and emperor, where you can do whatever you please. Here, if you say even a few wrong words, one misstep and you'll lose a layer of skin!"

"Yes, this humble one understands." Leng Ningyun played the grandson all the way, quickly rising to bow. "Thank you, Eunuch Yang, for your guidance."

"Good that you understand." Eunuch Yang nodded. "I'm old now; there's much I can no longer attend to. Be careful yourselves." With that, he gestured, and a young eunuch brought forth a visiting card case.

"Inside is a visiting card," Eunuch Yang said, pointing at the case. "For an ordinary person, even if they offered tribute of a thousand taels, this humble eunuch wouldn't give them one. But you're Great Merchant Gao's man—not ordinary. Take it and conduct your business well."

"Yes, thank you, Eunuch Yang." Leng Ningyun quickly stood, bending to receive the case. Wu Kaidi kept making urgent eye signals, and Leng Ningyun hurried to kneel and kowtow. Inwardly he was deeply unhappy, thinking this life was far too miserable. Had he known, he'd never have clamored for an overseas posting. This business of constantly kowtowing did not sit easily with him.

"Hehe, may your business thrive and prosper from now on." Eunuch Yang said with narrowed eyes and a knowing smile.

Leng Ningyun murmured his assent. After the banquet concluded, he hurried into his sedan and returned to his lodgings. He immediately summoned Wu Kaidi to confer.

"Young Eunuch Yang also needs to be cultivated. At least a thousand taels." Wu Kaidi had been attending at the banquet's periphery throughout.

"What? More money?" Leng Ningyun nearly leapt from his seat. The Beijing branch hadn't even begun operating, yet silver was flowing out in a constant stream. "Didn't you say that once the terms were settled we wouldn't need to spend more?"

"That was Eunuch Yang. This is *Young* Eunuch Yang." Wu Kaidi reminded him. "Are they the same thing? Didn't you catch His Honor's meaning?"

Wu Kaidi, born a servant, addressed everyone of higher status than himself as "His Honor."

"Of course I understood—from now on, Young Eunuch Yang will serve as the intermediary."

"Exactly. Consider this—can you slight the middleman? Whether a matter is reported favorably or unfavorably depends entirely on his tongue." Wu Kaidi continued. "Besides, he's Eunuch Yang's adopted son! He was specifically introduced at today's banquet—the importance placed on him is self-evident."

Leng Ningyun pondered this and realized it was indeed correct. His heart remained unwilling. He paced several circles around the study before saying with resignation: "Fine. We'll give him a generous gift as well."

Wu Kaidi reminded him: "For the regular three festivals and two tribute days, as you give to Eunuch Yang, you must prepare a share for him too. Just half the amount."

"Does that mean he'll also get half a phantom share?" Leng Ningyun thought this would throw off the original plan.

"That won't be necessary. Eunuch Yang doesn't intend that either," Wu Kaidi said. "You have to account for Eunuch Yang's face, but being too accommodating isn't wise either. He'll think you're weak and pushable, and he'll push further inch by inch. Eunuchs are all scheming—you have to stay on guard."

"I understand. When we open the gift ledger, I'll note everything down." Leng Ningyun nodded. Suddenly a wave of unease swept over him. He now seemed unable to function without Wu Kaidi—since arriving in Beijing, he had followed this naturalized citizen assistant's every word. The problem was, Wu Kaidi was almost never wrong.

Over the following days, Leng Ningyun searched for a suitable building for the bank, accompanied by Li Luoyou's manager.

In the old timeline, Leng Ningyun had visited the "great capital" more than once. Now he came to its predecessor—the same place, but looking completely different. Even standing outside the Forbidden City, he found far too many differences from the Forbidden City he had known.

The Forbidden City's exterior was old and grimy. Though the streets were wide, most were unpaved dirt roads. After several spring rains, mud was everywhere. Without riding in a sedan or carriage, one would be splattered to the knees. On the main streets, "strings" of camels plodded unhurriedly along, bearing heavy loads—mostly coal from the Mentougou region. Beijing survived its harsh winters thanks to this coal.

Only the sweet-and-sour candied hawthorn looked just like it did in the old timeline—though of course Leng Ningyun didn't dare eat any. Not merely out of hygiene and safety concerns, but also because the hawthorn skewers were often coated with sand and dust blown in by the spring wind.

Yet despite the filth and mud, from the day he entered Beijing, he had sensed the extraordinary scale and grandeur of this largest city in the nation—the political and economic center—its aura of dominion radiating over all. Riding in his sedan through the streets, gazing at the distant upturned eaves of the gate towers, this feeling only intensified.

*This imperial capital will someday fall into our hands*, he thought silently. Capturing this ancient capital would carry immense political symbolism. But most elders had no plans to establish their seat of power here. First, the natural conditions and geography were far from ideal. Second, many elders still viewed Beijing as the headquarters of "feudal remnants."

"Too much filth and stagnant water," Leng Ningyun muttered, thinking of his dealings with Eunuch Yang over recent days. His hatred for the Ming and for Beijing was growing.

The aftershocks of the *Jianlu* invasion had gradually subsided. No further actions from the Later Jin beyond the passes had been observed. The "riotous people" in Shaanxi hadn't yet coalesced into any real force and could only cause trouble in the west. As for "popular uprisings" in various regions—though numerous, most arose and were suppressed quickly without major impact. The She'an Rebellion, though once shocking the southwest, had ceased to pose a significant threat since She Chongming's defeat and flight to Shuixi. Suppression was merely a matter of the next few years. Zheng Zhilong along the southeastern coast had also accepted imperial pacification. So for the past several months, Beijing's situation had remained relatively calm.

Accompanied by Wu Kaidi and Li's manager, Leng Ningyun toured the Forbidden City, strolled through Chessboard Street—where he recalled that Li Zicheng had encountered resistance when entering Beijing—and visited the East and West Four Archways, the City God Temple, Lantern Market Junction, and other famous bustling places, conducting field surveys for suitable bank locations.

A bank didn't need a very bustling location—banks didn't operate from storefronts. But it couldn't be too distant from commercial districts, to facilitate merchants coming to exchange notes. Finally, they selected a location outside Qianmen, in an alley just off the main thoroughfare, easy to find. It had formerly been a pawnshop—property of one of Wei Zhongxian's eunuch faction members. After the Nine Thousand Years' downfall, the pawnshop had been confiscated. Valuables were seized, worthless items stolen, leaving only an empty building.

Leng Ningyun inspected the premises. Including the rear courtyard, it comprised three courtyards in total, plus four side courtyards. Having been a pawnshop, the construction was extremely solid, with walls and foundations built entirely of stone blocks. At the rear were special storerooms for pawned items—tall and sturdy. The back courtyard even had its own well—though the water was bitter.

Beijing's groundwater was essentially all bitter water, high in minerals and unfit for drinking. Potable water—called "sweet water"—had to be purchased from specialized "sweet water depots," with water carriers delivering daily. For Beijing residents, purchasing water constituted a major household expense.

Leng Ningyun surveyed the building and was quite satisfied—a bank had stringent security requirements. An ordinary building would require substantial renovation funds; this one would need relatively little modification. He made the decision on the spot: through Li Luoyou's manager, he purchased the building for four hundred taels of silver.
