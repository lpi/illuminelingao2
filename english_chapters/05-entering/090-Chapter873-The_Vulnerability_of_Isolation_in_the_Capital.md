# Chapter 873 - The Vulnerability of Isolation in the Capital

"There won't be more tribute to pay, will there?" Leng Ningyun remained hung up on this.

Wu Kaidi laughed: "The line has already been drawn. Some regular demands are probably unavoidable—it's small money, Master needn't worry about it. It's just that there are some things the Master needs to keep in mind. You can't wait for people to ask for everything."

He gave examples: although they had agreed on the three festivals and two tribute days, one had to constantly watch for developments at Eunuch Yang's residence. Small gifts should be sent every few days to show respect. Send fruit in winter and ice in summer. When Eunuch Yang's concubine celebrated her birthday, gifts must definitely be sent—

"Eunuch Yang is a eunuch, and he has concubines?" Leng Ningyun frowned.

"Many eunuchs have concubines," Wu Kaidi said. "Eunuch Yang has several concubines, and Concubine Bian is the most favored—gifts for her should be extra generous."

The question of how eunuchs made use of their concubines became one of Leng Ningyun's unresolved mysteries. But at the moment, there were far more pressing matters.

Three days later, Leng Ningyun prepared four simple gift items and went to pay his respects at Eunuch Yang's residence. This time, Eunuch Yang was very cordial, quite the gracious elder. Eunuchs in the palace who'd made something of themselves were all old foxes who'd cultivated their skills to perfection. They had a knack for winning people over with their manner. If Leng Ningyun weren't a modern person who'd received thorough education at the Farm and understood eunuchs fully, he would certainly have been drawn in.

At the banquet, Eunuch Yang introduced his adopted son, Yang Tianliang. Leng Ningyun didn't dare be casual and was quite effusive with this young Eunuch Yang.

Both parties toasted each other merrily. When they were about seventy or eighty percent drunk, Eunuch Yang finally said:

"This humble eunuch is getting old and must be on duty at the palace at all times. I rarely have free time. In the future, if there's business, my adopted son's word also counts. Don't come to my residence lightly. If there's business, I'll send someone to you."

"Yes, I'll follow everything Eunuch Yang commands." Leng Ningyun said respectfully. Eunuch Yang was actually only in his fifties, but he looked very old. Not only was his hair already white, but his face was deeply wrinkled.

"Hehe, having drunk this cup, this humble eunuch no longer considers you an outsider." Eunuch Yang leaned lazily against his chair back. Two young eunuchs, heads bowed, massaged his legs and shoulders respectively. He gave several comfortable grunts before continuing. "What you people are doing over in Qiongzhou Prefecture, this humble eunuch doesn't know and doesn't want to know. But you should understand: this is Beijing, the capital, the model for the realm right under the Son of Heaven. Even the dogs running in the streets might be drawing a salary. This isn't like your Guangdong region of southern barbarians, far from heaven and the emperor, where you can do whatever you please. Here, if you even say a few wrong words, one misstep and you'll lose a layer of skin!"

"Yes, this humble one understands." Leng Ningyun played grandson all the way, quickly standing up to bow. "Thank you, Eunuch Yang, for your guidance."

"Good that you understand." Eunuch Yang nodded. "I'm old now; there's much I can no longer attend to. Be careful yourselves." Saying this, he gestured, and a young eunuch brought out a visiting card case.

"Inside is a visiting card," Eunuch Yang pointed at the case. "For an ordinary person, even if they gave tribute of a thousand taels, this humble eunuch wouldn't give them one. But you're Great Merchant Gao's man, not ordinary. Take it and do your business well."

"Yes, thank you, Eunuch Yang." Leng Ningyun quickly stood up, bending to receive the case. Wu Kaidi kept making eye signals, and Leng Ningyun hurried to kneel and kowtow. He was very unhappy inside, thinking this life was too miserable. If he'd known, he wouldn't have clamored to be posted abroad. This business of constantly kowtowing was not easy to bear.

"Hehe, let's see your business thrive and prosper from now on." Eunuch Yang said with narrowed eyes and a smile.

Leng Ningyun murmured assent. After the banquet ended, he hurried into his sedan and returned to his lodgings. He summoned Wu Kaidi to discuss.

"Young Eunuch Yang also needs to be taken care of. At least a thousand taels." Wu Kaidi had been attending at the banquet's side the whole time.

"What? More money?" Leng Ningyun nearly jumped up. The Beijing branch hadn't even begun operating, yet money was constantly flowing out. "Didn't you say once the line was drawn we wouldn't need to spend more?"

"That was Eunuch Yang. This is Young Eunuch Yang." Wu Kaidi reminded him. "Are they the same thing? Didn't you understand His Honor's meaning?"

Wu Kaidi, born a servant, called everyone of higher status than himself "His Honor."

"Of course I understood—from now on, Young Eunuch Yang will serve as the intermediary."

"Exactly. Think about it—can you slight this middleman? Whether a matter is reported as good or bad is entirely in his mouth." Wu Kaidi said. "Besides, he's Eunuch Yang's adopted son! Today at the banquet, he was specifically introduced—the importance placed on him is self-evident."

Leng Ningyun thought about it and realized this was indeed correct. His heart was quite unwilling. He paced a few circles in the study, then said indignantly: "Fine, let's give him a generous gift too."

Wu Kaidi reminded him: "For the regular three festivals and two tribute days, as you give to Eunuch Yang, you must also prepare a share for him. Just half the amount."

"Does that mean he'll also get half a phantom share?" Leng Ningyun thought this would mess up the original plan.

"That won't be necessary. Eunuch Yang doesn't mean that either," Wu Kaidi said. "You have to account for Eunuch Yang's face, but being too accommodating isn't good either. He'll think you're weak and pushable, and he'll push further inch by inch. Eunuchs are all devious—you have to be on guard."

"I understand. When we open the gift ledger, I'll note it all down." Leng Ningyun nodded. Suddenly he felt a wave of unease. He now seemed unable to function without Wu Kaidi—after arriving in Beijing, he'd practically followed this naturalized citizen assistant's every word. The problem was, Wu Kaidi was almost never wrong.

Over the next few days, Leng Ningyun searched for a suitable building for the bank, accompanied by Li Luoyou's manager.

In the old time-space, Leng Ningyun had visited the "great capital" more than once. Now he came to the great capital's predecessor—the place was still the same place, but looked completely different. Even when he came outside the Forbidden City of the old time-space, he found far too many differences from the Forbidden City he'd known.

The Forbidden City's exterior was old and dirty. Though the streets were wide, most were dirt roads. With several spring rains, wherever one went was mud everywhere. Without riding in a sedan or carriage, one would get splattered with mud up to the legs and feet. On the main streets, one often saw "strings" of camels unhurriedly plodding along, carrying heavy loads—mostly coal from the Mentougou area. Beijing got through its harsh winters thanks to this coal.

Only the sweet-and-sour candied hawthorn looked just like the old time-space—though of course Leng Ningyun didn't dare eat any. Not just out of hygiene and safety concerns, but also because the hawthorn skewers were often covered with sand and dust blown in by the spring wind.

Yet despite the filth and mud, from the day he entered Beijing, he could sense the extraordinary scale and grandeur of this largest city in the country—the political and economic center—its aura of dominion over all. Riding in his sedan through the streets, looking at the distant upturned eaves of the gate towers, this feeling grew even stronger.

This imperial capital will someday fall into our hands, he thought silently in the sedan. Capturing this ancient capital would be a matter of great political symbolism. But most elders didn't plan to make their capital here. First, the natural conditions and geography weren't ideal. Second, many elders still saw Beijing as the headquarters of "feudal remnants."

"Too much filth and stagnant water," Leng Ningyun muttered, thinking of his dealings with Eunuch Yang these past few days. He felt increasing hatred for the Ming and Beijing.

The aftershocks of the Jianlu [Manchu] invasion had gradually subsided. No further actions from the Later Jin beyond the passes had been seen. The "riotous people" in Shaanxi hadn't yet formed any real force and could only cause trouble in the west. As for "popular uprisings" in various regions—though numerous, most arose and were suppressed quickly without major impact. The She'an Rebellion, though once shocking the southwest, had ceased to be a major threat since She Chongming's defeat and flight to Shuixi. Suppression was only a matter of these next few years. Zheng Zhilong along the southeastern coast had also accepted imperial pacification. So for the past few months, Beijing's situation had remained relatively calm.

Accompanied by Wu Kaidi and Li's manager, Leng Ningyun toured the Forbidden City, strolled through Chessboard Street—he remembered that Li Zicheng had encountered some resistance here when entering Beijing; he visited the East and West Four Archways, the City God Temple, Lantern Market Junction, and other famous bustling places, conducting field surveys for suitable bank locations.

A bank didn't need a very bustling location—banks didn't do business from storefronts. But it couldn't be too far from commercial districts, to facilitate merchants coming to exchange notes. Finally, a location was selected outside Qianmen [Front Gate], in an alley off the main street, easy to find. It had been a pawnshop—property of one of Wei Zhongxian's eunuch faction members. After the Nine Thousand Years' downfall, the pawnshop was confiscated. Valuables were seized, worthless items were stolen, leaving only an empty building.

Leng Ningyun inspected the building. Including the back courtyard, it had three courtyards in total, plus four side courtyards. Having been a pawnshop, the construction was very solid, with walls and foundations all built of stone blocks. In the back were special storerooms for pawned items—tall and sturdy. The back courtyard even had its own well—though the water was bitter.

Beijing's groundwater was basically bitter water, high in minerals and unfit for drinking. Drinking water—called "sweet water"—was purchased from specialized "sweet water depots," with water carriers delivering daily. For Beijing residents, buying water was also a major expense.

Leng Ningyun looked over the building and was quite satisfied—a bank had high security requirements. An ordinary building would need substantial renovation funds; this building would need relatively little modification. He made the decision on the spot: through Li Luoyou's manager, he bought the building for four hundred taels of silver.
