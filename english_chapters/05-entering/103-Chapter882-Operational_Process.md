# Chapter 882 - Operational Process

Lingao's standard code system was, in essence, a knockoff of the NSN—National Stock Number. The NSN sorting rule followed a 4+2+7 digit pattern: the first four digits served as the classification code. Prior to 1974, a 4+7 pattern was used, with the latter portion being a serial number. From 1951 to 1974, a seven-digit code called FSN—Federal Stock Number—was employed. After 1974, a two-digit country code was inserted before the serial number. The system could now support between one hundred million and one billion item types. The Americans themselves used codes 00, 01, 02—meaning they utilized over twenty million types in total. Before FSN, there was no classification code, merely serial numbers; it was five digits during the early World War II era and expanded to six digits by the war's end.

"Even the US military only used twenty million types. Even if we expand to the entire industrial sector, our total variety count won't exceed twenty million. We'll remain in the five-digit range for a considerable time. So for now, a 4+2+5 digit system will suffice. Later we can add digits, just like upgrading phone numbers."

"The greatest advantage of the American coding is the pre-assigned category structure. Following the category number makes it easy to retrieve any class of items, then quickly locate any specific item within that class."

Adopting a standard code system laid the foundation for future electromechanical card database management, even if electronic computers couldn't be employed for management temporarily.

Scardal took a sip of water. "Aren't we short of manpower right now? We should minimize repetitive labor wherever possible. Code all existing parts and establish files. When anyone needs something, they check first—if an existing common part can be used, use it. Doesn't this save manpower? Especially for elders working as designers and engineers. It's also extremely convenient for organizing logistical supply."

"Judging by the internal trial situation in my Ministry of Colonization recently, we're currently using only a few thousand types of raw materials and parts in total—fewer varieties than in a single small sedan from the old time-space. Two or three indigenous clerks can manage the entire archive. If I want to check the file of any commodity, someone brings it to my desk within three minutes. Even when there are more items later, it'll simply function as a human-powered database. I propose establishing a centralized Standardization Information Archive where all departments can come to retrieve and consult information, improving efficiency."

"You're too idealistic. Without the support of modern IT infrastructure—barcodes, automatic scanners, databases—standard codes can only achieve rudimentary functions. Just compiling a cross-reference index will become a complex project by then." An elder who had worked in ERP expressed concern that this was an impractical "Great Leap Forward."

"It's not that complex," Scardal argued. "This system existed during World War II. Where were the things you mentioned back then?"

He continued to elaborate: The purpose of classification codes is to assign different items to different handlers. A major category is assigned to a logistics department, such as the Electronics Section or Hydraulics Section. A minor category or several minor categories are assigned to a person or team. Specific management is directly assigned to individuals—whoever manages items with problems, non-standard files, or failure to keep pace with development gets their pay docked.

The original serial numbers remain serial numbers, continuing to be arranged in sequence. This portion is managed by a master catalog.

"...Although we lack computers, these codes can be perfectly managed by naturalized civilian staff using human labor. Train them simply in library retrieval skills—mastering the use of card indexes and file compilation. At our current level of technological development, we'll use at most a dozen major categories and fewer than one hundred minor categories. The total code volume will be tens of thousands at most. A professional team of twenty or thirty people can manage it quite effectively, requiring at most a few supervisors to check for errors."

Before IT systems existed, FSN had operated on a complete paper-based system run via forms. This system had been used for decades. Even after IT equipment and software appeared, the paper system continued to exist as a backup, now printed directly from the database for preservation.

"To further illustrate how this system operates for everyone, I'll use Hong Kong Shipyard as an example," Scardal continued. "Actually, it's primarily form operations. Different activities have different forms."

For instance, if the shipyard needs a certain model of twenty-centimeter ship nail, they can send a requirement form to Guangzhou Station. Guangzhou Station then notifies qualified indigenous workshops or artisans to submit quotes, then signs a contract to purchase the goods. Great Wave Shipping, acting as receiving agent, signs for items one by one using the form, then transfers them to Shi Jiantao. Delong pays based on the signed receipt documents.

Every day, each workshop in the shipyard reports its requisition plan to the warehouse. The warehouse determines inventory plans based on consumption rates and stock levels. After the plan receives approval, it's transferred to the supporting department to coordinate with Guangzhou Station for order placement. After Great Wave Shipping receives the ships, it also accepts maintenance parts. Based on the consumption rate of parts, warning lines are set; orders are placed when those thresholds are reached.

"Similarly, we can apply this to logistical supply, trade management, and many other areas. I was doing all this work manually when I first started my career; implementation without complex computer management is perfectly feasible—efficiency simply decreases somewhat. The purpose of the NSN code is to ensure that transmitted information doesn't distort at any stage of the process. Simultaneously, all additionally generated information—such as a supplier's capability, or the fault and damage records of the part itself—can be entered into the archives based on this unique identifier, then forwarded to those who should receive it."

"In that case, the speed of information exchange becomes critical," Shi Jiantao expressed concern.

"We have wireless and wired telegraph; data can be exchanged via telegram. More complex tables can be delivered by mail."

"I harbor deep doubts about such data exchange. First, the timeliness is problematic. Second, I think you're underestimating the complexity involved..."

...

Both sides debated this issue for over ten minutes. Finally, all eyes fell on Wu De, who had assumed a "contemplative state." As meeting host, he held the final word on this matter.

"Mm, everyone makes valid points." He suddenly "awoke." To cover his momentary distraction, he coughed once. "I believe the standard code system should still be implemented. Better early than late—take advantage of our currently limited material types to establish the system first; it will save considerable trouble later. Let's proceed with Scardal's plan and give it a trial run."

The meeting decided to use Hong Kong Shipyard and the Logistics Command of the Fubo Army as pilot units for implementing the Imperial Standard Code System.

After the meeting concluded, Wu De gathered his faux BOSS briefcase and departed the Planning Commission conference room. Another meeting awaited. At that moment, someone hurried up from behind, taking three steps where two would suffice.

"Ah De! Wait up."

"What is it?"

Scardal said, "With this standard code implementation and shipyard parts outsourcing preparation—can the Letter of Credit system also be rolled out in Guangzhou?"

"Let's discuss that later. I don't foresee any problems." Wu De had always maintained an indifferent attitude toward matters like Letters of Credit—the Planning Commission had never been particularly keen on financial matters anyway. "Just get it passed at the Executive Committee meeting."

"The problem is that everyone seems to lack understanding in this area. Promoting the Letter of Credit system offers great benefits for import-export trade; it's advantageous for both parties, not some financial trickery..."

Wu De paid little attention to Scardal's complaints. He had been somewhat absent-minded since the meeting began. The Imperial Stock Codes concept was something he strongly advocated. Originally he had known nothing about the FSN concept; it was entirely the result of Hong Huangnan and Scardal constantly lobbying him. And the *Weekly Thoughts* compiled personally by Wen Desi—circulated weekly to the Executive Committee, Standing Committee of the Elder Council, and department heads—also frequently mentioned the concept of "standardization" across all domains.

It was under this dual influence that he had developed keen interest in the FSN system and taken the lead in organizing its implementation. But having only a code system merely facilitated management; the objects to be managed were still far from sufficient.

The launch of the Dengzhou and Zhejiang operations was imminent. The Elder Council had set no precise numerical target for population to be obtained from these operations—only saying "transport with all effort, transport as many as possible." Despite this phrasing, in private conversations with Ma Qianzhu, Wu De believed these two operations would only be worthwhile if they yielded at least two hundred thousand people. Currently, the number of refugees in Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi had declined, and the pace of absorbing population at various stations had slowed considerably. Without artificially engineering a crisis, absorbing large numbers of new population from Guangdong would become increasingly difficult.

"Those who come voluntarily are certainly welcome, but compared to voluntary arrivals, I prefer indentured servants," Ma Qianzhu had observed. "They're more diligent than average workers and easier to manage. Furthermore, we also need to alter the demographic structure ratio."

The Elder Council was also deeply dissatisfied with the current situation where Guangdong and Fujian natives constituted too large a proportion of naturalized citizens. Most naturalized citizens had been recruited from Guangdong. Due to geographical factors, this inevitably resulted in Cantonese and Fujianese being the largest populations. In Lingao, Cantonese and Minnan dialects not only had the potential to displace the local Lingao dialect, but even the official Mandarin language was losing ground. Although the elders vigorously promoted Mandarin in schools and government offices, in production enterprises, these two dialects showed a tendency to gradually become the lingua franca among workers.

In the finalized refugee transport plan, the Planning Commission prepared to transport one hundred thousand people from Northern Zhejiang and at least one hundred thousand from Dengzhou—the vast majority to be brought back to Lingao, with ten thousand settled in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Additionally, two or three thousand would be settled locally in Zhejiang as labor for Zhao Yingong's Jiangnan enterprises.
