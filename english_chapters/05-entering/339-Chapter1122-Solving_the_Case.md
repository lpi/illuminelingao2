# Chapter 1122 - Solving the Case

Two days later, Feng Zongze received a telegram from Lingao:

*First, commendation to all personnel of the Jeju Forward Committee for the appropriate handling of the 3.15 and 3.20 incidents, taking resolute action and minimizing losses; Second, the Central Government Administration and Planning Committee have granted special honors to naturalized citizens Kim O-sun and Kim Yuk-sun. Kim Yuk-sun is posthumously promoted to the rank of Special Inspector, First Class, and awarded the Medal of Revolutionary Martyr. Kim O-sun is awarded the Medal of Revolutionary Hero, First Class, and promoted to Special Clerk, directly appointed as Clerk for Women's Affairs; Third, Special Clerk Kim O-sun will be transferred by special ship to Lingao General Hospital for treatment, with expenses paid from the Forward Committee's administrative budget; Fourth, the Political Consultative Conference as scheduled may be postponed as appropriate given the circumstances. The Jeju Forward Committee may decide on the timing and format after fully consulting with local conditions; Fifth, economics taking command means the Jeju Island Forward Committee must submit a budget for the upcoming fiscal year comprehensively and accurately. Previously approved projects lacking budget may not be arbitrarily expanded. Authority for additional budget items rests with the Planning Committee. All emergency budget items on Jeju Island must receive prior approval from Planning and Administration...*

Reading this made Feng Zongze break into a cold sweat. This Article Five had clearly caught wind of his recent "ambitious plans" regarding major projects for Jeju. The Planning Committee had shot over with a warning: don't get ideas above your station; all budgets must be approved by the Committee.

*Sixth, effective from receipt of this telegram, the Jeju Forward Committee's current priority shall be implementing island-wide security enforcement. Therefore, from this date, the Forward Committee ranking shall be: Xue Ziliang, Feng Zongze, Nangong Wudi, Nick. Xue Ziliang shall assume overall responsibility.*

Feng Zongze finished reading the telegram and sat down, looking desolate. Everyone present initialed the document.

Every Committee member present understood perfectly well that, strictly speaking, the Jeju disturbance wasn't that significant. For the Committee, it could hardly be called a loss. If one followed the theory of "turning bad things into good things," it had even produced model figures like the Kim siblings—benefits clearly outweighed drawbacks.

However, from private telegrams with friends, colleagues, and superiors in Lingao, and from internal publications like *Qiming Star* and *Weekly Dynamics* distributed specifically for Committee members, they already knew: the Executive Committee would likely use this opportunity to knock down the recently emerging "localism" tendency.

This tendency had been growing since the occupation of all Hainan Island, but Hainan was still the main island. Jeju Island was distant from the center, its surrounding environment complex, and the policy flexibility granted there was relatively greater. To get things done, one could always find sufficient reasons to compel the Planning Committee to agree—or at least partially agree.

Especially the several truculent theoretical articles in *Qiming Star*: "Clearly Opposing Localism" and "External Posting = Gravy—Who Monitors the Power Inflation of Outside-Posted Committee Members?" The first was signed by Du Wen; the second by "Independent Political Commentator."

One look at these bylines told the Committee members on Jeju that this was trouble not to be trifled with.

This telegram from the Central Administration and Planning Committee confirmed their suspicions. Of course, the telegram itself was quite polite and didn't reject the Jeju Forward Committee's work.

Xue Ziliang stood up. He still wasn't accustomed to this "Committee-style" command system. But after years of immersion, he'd roughly figured out the operational rules and various subtext of this knockoff system.

Feng Zongze was no longer in charge; he had taken over—indicating the Executive Committee wanted them to shift their focus to "security enforcement."

He awkwardly opened the folder in his hands, hesitating over whether to say something his colleagues often said, like "thank the organization for its trust and comrades for their support"—ultimately deciding against it, cutting straight to the topic: the next steps in counter-insurgency and specific implementation plans.

Feng Zongze listened absent-mindedly. His thoughts were on Case 315's progress. More and more evidence indicated that Pak Deokhwan, whom he had personally promoted and entrusted with important duties, not only had financial problems but also was under serious suspicion of treason.

From the prisoners' testimony, Cho Myeong-gwi had been confirmed as the mastermind behind the 3.15 activities, with Kim Man-il as his patron. Though Jang Seong-seol had been "gifted" by Huang Yunyu, she was actually Cho Myeong-gwi's bondservant.

The evidence chain pointing to Pak Deokhwan's treason was essentially complete. All that remained was for Liu Fuqing to sweep them all up in the next step and obtain physical evidence and confessions directly.

After Xue Ziliang covered the first phase of counter-insurgency operations, Nangong Wudi began discussing village consolidation and armed migration. Feng Zongze didn't take any of it in. In a daze, he waited until the meeting ended, then hurried to the Political Security Bureau's Jeju office.

---

It was noon; most people were at work. The streets were somewhat deserted. The quicklime-treated heads of "militiamen" were displayed on sharpened wooden poles, neatly lined along the street near the military barracks. Feng Zongze felt uncomfortable every time he passed.

In March on Jeju, the weather was still a bit cold, yet Liu Fuqing wore only a plain cotton shirt—what the Officials called a "dress shirt"—with sleeves rolled up high, collar open, steam rising from his half-bald head, smoking a cigarette while reviewing newly extracted interrogation materials.

Starting from the fifteen captured prisoners, the interrogations had uncovered more leads. Though all fifteen were small players, their hiding places between infiltrating the city and emerging to commit arson that night bore undeniable "enemy" suspicion. Through interrogating the prisoners, they quickly uncovered a batch of shops and residences within the city connected to Kim Man-il that had sheltered the "militia." These even included some Labor Service workers and collaborator cadres.

The roundup began immediately. Liu Fuqing directed the White Horse Battalion in a city-wide dragnet, arresting over a hundred people. Family members and servants alike were indiscriminately detained and questioned. He personally conducted marathon interrogations.

After the overnight intensive questioning, the suspects were roughly sorted: most were innocent or only tangentially involved. Out of caution, he continued holding this group in the refugee camp, awaiting the Officials' instructions on their disposition.

Liu Fuqing was familiar with the Ming officialdom's ways. Such a case, in the Ming, would be "treason." Those implicated, regardless of role, could receive heavy sentences. How far the matter ultimately went and how many were implicated depended on the presiding official's and emperor's inclinations.

He still wasn't clear on the "Australians'" specific approach to such cases. Whether to use this opportunity to launch a major purge, or to let it blow over gently.

Since the entire 3.15 case and the subsequent 3.20 disturbance had been clarified, Liu Fuqing decided to organize his findings and report to Feng Zongze, then request instructions for the next steps. Wumu had already given him instructions: on the investigation and handling of the case, "follow Official Feng's orders."

Feng Zongze's arrival didn't surprise him. From his telegram exchanges with Official Wumu and recent events, this cunning old bureaucrat had roughly figured out the crux of the matter.

Official Feng was now eager to clear himself of the charges of negligence in internal security work.

He buttoned his collar, then began reporting the work progress in full detail.

Cho Myeong-gwi was the first arrested—Political Security Bureau investigators had determined he was the mastermind of the hostile forces in Jeju City. This judgment proved correct.

Large quantities of documents, letters, weapons, and poison were seized from Cho Myeong-gwi's shop and residence. There were even many different types of civilian clothing.

Most critically, a "ledger" was seized—it detailed the various expenses of his "public relations activities" on the island. Pak Deokhwan's name topped the spending list.

Besides Pak Deokhwan, the ledger implicated multiple "collaborator" personnel, including people at Chocheon Port Authority, the Corral Administration, Jeju Labor Service, and White Horse Battalion whom he'd wined and dined. Most involved trivial amounts and weren't conducted through him personally—even Political Security Bureau hadn't noticed.

Cho Myeong-gwi, through years of commercial activity, had long established a business network spanning the inside and outside of Jeju City. Through this network, he could manipulate many things from behind the scenes.

"What scheming!" Feng Zongze nearly slammed the table. He'd clearly underestimated this merchant Cho Myeong-gwi!

"What about Cho Myeong-gwi's confession? Any new discoveries?"

"He'd refused to talk at first, but finally confessed this morning," Liu Fuqing said. "But we've interrogated him for days and nights. He's a bit muddled now, and his confession is somewhat inconsistent..."

"Did he give up his patron?"

"Yes. He explicitly confessed that all of this was done on Kim Man-il's instructions," Liu Fuqing said. "Another key figure involved is Huang Yunyu, but he's escaped..."

Feng Zongze knew this name. This was the contractor for Jeju Island's bow and arrow industry, who'd contributed considerably to his bow export business. Thinking that he'd even treated the man rather graciously and had been planning to recruit him as a naturalized cadre—he felt humiliated fury. "Escaped?"

"Yes. After the 3.15 case, he left Jeju. We checked Chocheon Port's entry and exit records. He went to the peninsula on business."

"Lucky him!" he said resentfully.

Liu Fuqing glanced at him and mentally noted "Huang Yunyu = over."

"We've arrested his family and employees. His chief clerk Choi Hyun-taek confessed they've already made contact with Yi Court local officials on the peninsula and have a plan to counterattack Jeju."

Feng Zongze nodded and asked: "Has Pak Deokhwan been arrested?"

"Not yet. He's an important local cadre. I was hoping to get your approval..."

"Approved. Arrest him immediately."
