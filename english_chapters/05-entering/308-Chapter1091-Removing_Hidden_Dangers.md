# Chapter 1091 - Removing Hidden Dangers

According to the report from civil affairs cadres, there were both men and women in the musical troupe. The Senate needed these women, but not the men behind them. In the old timeline, any prostitution group was secrectly controlled by pimps: from hair salon girls in Wenzhou to nightclubs everywhere, it was all the same. Without the protection of these people, they simply couldn't operate. In this timeline, such musical troupes were mobile brothels, and the few middle-aged men in the troupe were the ones controlling this group of opera singers. These women had been oppressed and controlled by them for a long time, developing a habitual dependence and fear of them, so these few men had to disappear.

"Take them away and hand them over to the military court, charged with the crime of organizing banditry," Zhu Mingxia instructed the orderly.

Gallows had been built on Qimu Island when they started taking in refugees—the arbitration tribunal had issued two authorization warrants, authorizing the Northbound Detachment to set up a military court each on Qimu Island and Jeju Island, to serve as the legal basis for temporary disposal.

The military court was set up in this refugee camp, and its only purpose was intimidation. With nearly ten thousand people gathered together, it would become an out-and-out hell on earth without powerful violent means to maintain order.

The gallows had never been empty since they were put into use. The bodies of the hanged prisoners would not be taken down until the next unlucky guy was about to be hung up.

An hour later, the messenger brought the written judgment—Zhu Mingxia was also the presiding judge of the military court.

He flipped through the materials: clear logic, conclusive evidence; indictment, testimony, and confessions were all there. In addition to the crime of organizing banditry, a series of charges such as human trafficking, intentional injury, illegal detention, illegal torture, and gathering crowds to fight came were added. Of course, it would be strange if such a musical troupe didn't have such things at that time.

Zhu Mingxia nodded with satisfaction: The young lads memorized the legal articles really well. Doing it this way made everything appear reasonable and legal—"ruling the country by law" could not be abolished.

"In the name of the Senate and the People, I order the necessary disposal of the following personnel." He signed his name after this line of words and handed the document to the messenger, "Execute immediately."

After executing the people who shouldn't exist, Zhu Mingxia felt in a good mood. He looked out the window: on the small square beside the stockade, dead cattle, horses, and mules were being skinned. They prepared to use this livestock meat to improve the meals of the Northbound Detachment in the evening. The Northbound Detachment had been eating very hardships these days; apart from filling their stomachs, they were actually no different from refugees. Even fresh vegetables were rarely supplied here, let alone meat.

Even Zhu Mingxia himself hadn't eaten fresh meat for a long time. Seeing this scene, not only did he not feel disgusted, but he swallowed a few mouthfuls of saliva. Immediately he instructed the orderly: "Tell the cooking squad to get some steaks first, then make some radish beef balls! Also beef tendon, put more pepper, Sichuan peppercorn, and cumin..."

While speaking, Lu Wenyuan and Chen Sigen also arrived. Both were in high spirits: they had just drafted the telegram to be sent to Lingao, reporting this major battle result, and at the same time requesting an increase in shipping frequency.

The telegram could be sent in the name of the Jeju Island Forward Command after Zhu Mingxia read and signed it. Although this couldn't count as some amazing great victory, at least it showed that the Northbound Detachment had gained a firm foothold in Shandong, and the operation of the Engine Action was also normal.

"If the ships can't come in time, hundreds of people will definitely freeze to death when it snows again in a few days." Lu Wenyuan said with some regret, "It's a bit of a waste for us to catch so many prisoners."

"Last time Zhao Yingong sent a telegram saying he was trying to solve it—how will he solve it?" Zhu Mingxia was also worried about this problem, "It wasn't easy to get so many people, don't let a large batch be tossed to death again."

He had no opinion on the telegram text. As the chief military officer, even if he didn't brag about himself, the four words "commanded with proper methods" would always belong to him.

After signing, Lu Yang arrived. He reported that all corpses had been dumped.

"Finally finished—getting my few *Dafa* boats all covered in blood stains, have to scrub them properly..." He complained, "If you asked me, wouldn't it be fine to just bury them directly? It's equal to fertilizing the land—"

"The weather is freezing, digging pits is too hard." Zhu Mingxia shook his head, "Besides, if not done well, we have to consider issues of plague and groundwater pollution. It's better to throw them into the sea: you can think of it this way, burying in the ground is making fertilizer, throwing into the sea is feeding fish. Anyway, once the Senators stand firm in Jeju and Shandong, large-scale development of local fishery resources should be put on the agenda immediately. This can not only solve a big chunk of the grain problem but also supplement the urgently lacking protein. What a good thing!"

Lu Wenyuan laughed: "Sir Zhu, your level of comprehensive utilization is not high. If that gang from the Planning Commission were here, they would definitely shave off the dead people's hair, weave it into cold-proof felt mats and insoles after high-temperature steam disinfection; throw corpses into biogas digesters to decompose, producing biogas for heating and cooking for refugees, biogas slurry for fertilizing fields, residues for feeding pigs, and if really can't use it up, throw into the sea to feed fish, developing fishery production..."

"Stop talking, I'm almost vomiting." Chen Sigen frowned, "After hearing you say that, I don't even want to eat fish."

"Alright, let's stop roasting the Planning Commission. I think tomorrow let Little Lu send a ship to contact Sun Yuanhua," Zhu Mingxia said, "First is to give him gifts, second is to see if we can help him strengthen Laizhou's defense. Kong Youde and his gang suffered such a big loss, they should attack Laizhou even more fiercely and ruthlessly."

"The headquarters has already telegraphed. They will soon send a Senator specifically responsible for Laizhou's defense and liaison work with Sun Yuanhua. They asked us to find an appropriate opportunity to help him establish a relationship with Sun Yuanhua." Lu Wenyuan said.

"Eh? Could it be that this person is not me?" Lu Yang was greatly disappointed.

"You'll be busy soon enough—you are the Naval Detachment Commander, not a diplomat. What do you want to do hanging out with Old Sun instead of doing your own job?" Chen Sigen looked at him maliciously.

"Alright, alright, I know." Lu Yang had to nod, "I have great reverence for Mister Huodong..."

"Reverence is not good. We just need to respect him." Zhu Mingxia said, "Since it's like this, we have to find a suitable opportunity. How about we don't send our gifts first, wait for the person to come and send them together—to let him owe us a favor."

"Agreed, we must look for the right timing." Lu Wenyuan nodded, "Today is January 24th. In a few more days, the rebels will fight a battle with the government troops led by Yang Yufan and Wang Hong at Xincheng. So I think we don't need to rush to go at this moment. It will be better to go when this government army is defeated and people in Laizhou City are in panic, to make them appreciate the favor more."

Another effect was that Yang Yufan and Wang Hong lost the battle, but Sun Yuanhua won a battle. Reporting simultaneously would be great benefit to reducing Sun Yuanhua's guilt.

"Didn't expect you to have quite a few ideas," Chen Sigen praised, "I think this is feasible."

Zhu Mingxia also expressed agreement. Everyone unanimously decided to go "give gifts" after the government troops suffered a defeat.

Zhu Mingxia also ordered to organize a commando unit, preparing to go "pick up scraps" after the rebels finished fighting the government troops on January 30th. Even getting some dead horses and mules back would be good.

After fighting the rebels, things quieted down for a few days. The Qimu Island trio was waiting for someone from the rebels to contact them, but the Special Reconnaissance Team that went to Dengzhou for reconnaissance returned. They also brought back some prisoners.

Seeing these few figures in the courtyard wrapped in dirty cotton robes, looking dispirited one by one, Lu Wenyuan immediately knew who they were.

These were the original Dengzhou officials captured when the city fell: Dengzhou Intendant Song Guanglan, Liaodong-Coastal Supervising Censor Wang Zheng, Governor's Command Brigade Commander (*Fubiao Canjiang*) Zhang Tao...

According to the Special Reconnaissance report, they discovered during surveillance that these people were sent out by the rebels. The rebels were very polite, not only sending people to escort them out of the city but also giving each person several mules, along with servants and luggage.

The Special Reconnaissance Team had received relevant orders long ago, so naturally, they wouldn't let them go. They immediately sent people to follow and monitor. After the group was far away from the city, they launched a surprise attack, eliminated the escorting rebel cavalry, and captured all the remaining people.

Simple interrogation of captured rebel soldiers and servants proved that these people were the captured Dengzhou officials.

"You did a good job." Lu Wenyuan patted the team member's shoulder vigorously, turned his head and said to Chen Sigen, "Give them a merit record!"

"No problem!" Chen Sigen smiled and nodded, "Beautifully done!"

Capturing this batch of officials removed one of Sun Yuanhua's biggest hidden dangers. The so-called "unifying the narrative" was also a very important matter.

"Send all these people into the stockade to bathe and change clothes, then give them physical examinations. Prepare a banquet later to help them get over the shock." Lu Wenyuan instructed his subordinates, "Return luggage and servants to them, but free movement is not allowed. Put them all under house arrest!"

When Dengzhou City fell, most civil and military officials either surrendered to the rebels or committed suicide. Those like them who neither surrendered nor committed suicide were the minority. This made these officials become the main evidence for the court to suspect "surrendering to the enemy and joining the rebellion" after being released by the rebels. However, for the Senators, the motive for these people refusing to commit suicide was not strange at all: most of these people were Catholics. Suicide was a grave sin for Catholics, unforgivable unless pardoned personally by the Pope after death.

It was indeed surprising that so many high-ranking officials believing in Catholicism gathered in this small Dengzhou City. Sun Yuanhua indeed regarded his fellow believers as the most reliable assistants. Speaking of which, it was a bit like a Dengzhou Catholic clique.

However, Zhu Mingxia understood his practice very well: The new system Sun Yuanhua engaged in was not something ordinary officials and scholars of the Great Ming could understand and accept. Forming a small clique was also excusable.

Although these officials were useless, they were Sun Yuanhua's best allies: they were colleagues in Sun Yuanhua's career and fellow believers, and now faced the same crisis. They were easily persuaded to cooperate. Helping Sun Yuanhua was helping themselves; they wouldn't fail to understand this simple principle. As long as they understood the current situation, they would speak according to the plan prepared in advance.
