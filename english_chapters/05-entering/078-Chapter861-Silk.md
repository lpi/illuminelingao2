# Chapter 861 - Silk

But the Shen family's bankruptcy was not due to poor silk prices, but rather silkworm disease.

"Last year, our silkworms unfortunately contracted disease—the entire year's harvest was lost," the man said miserably. "That's why we went bankrupt. We beg the Master to take us in."

Most silkworm diseases are caused by viruses. The silkworm-rearing environment is enclosed, and silkworms are kept at high density. If cleaning and disinfection measures aren't properly maintained, various silkworm diseases can easily break out. Traditional silkworm-rearing had its own methods for dealing with diseases, but conceptual gaps in disinfection meant that outbreaks resulting in reduced or total crop loss were common occurrences.

Once a large-scale disease outbreak occurred, silkworm farmers faced the risk of losing everything they had invested.

It seemed that silkworm-rearing for farmers was also a case of "high risk, high reward"—not as simple as he had imagined. Zhao Yingong listened with growing interest. Since he intended to enter this business, he naturally wanted to learn as much as possible.

He then asked for more details about the actual silkworm-rearing process. But in rural areas, silkworm-rearing was women's work. Girls began learning from the age of twelve or thirteen. From "protecting the eggs" in the twelfth month, to hatching and "spreading the birds" in early spring, through the silkworms' "three sleeps," "emerging from fire," "climbing the mountain," and finally to baking cocoons and reeling silk—all was handled by women. The man knew the basics but feared explaining poorly or making mistakes, so he asked his wife to speak.

"This servant greets the Master." The woman was rather pretty and spoke in a Hangzhou dialect that blended north and south sounds—not too different from modern Hangzhou dialect. Zhao Yingong found it pleasant to listen to and smiled. "Rise. What is your name?"

"Country women have no names. This servant's maiden name is Wang, fourth in the family. Everyone used to call me Wang Siniang. The Master may call this servant whatever he wishes." The woman spoke quite cleverly—Jiangnan peasant women not only worked the fields and raised silkworms but also frequently "went to market" to peddle goods, so they were not lacking in conversational skills.

Wang Siniang first described the silkworm-rearing process. From hatching to cocoon formation took twenty-eight to forty days. Feeding silkworms followed a strict schedule; fresh mulberry leaves had to be added promptly, even if it meant rising in the middle of the night—not a moment could be delayed. Silkworm frass and leftover leaf fragments had to be constantly cleaned, otherwise silkworm diseases would easily take hold. Temperature requirements for raising silkworms were also very exacting: warmth was needed, but it couldn't be too hot, and there couldn't be drafts. So silkworm-rearing rooms were always kept tightly closed and sealed. If the temperature dropped even slightly, fires had to be lit for warmth. When the silkworms "climbed the mountain," braziers were placed under the silkworm trays—this accelerated silk spinning and kept the spun silk as dry as possible, improving cocoon quality. But with frequent fires, extreme care with flames was necessary. House fires caused by silkworm-rearing fires were quite common at the time.

Zhao Yingong was quite familiar with the metaphor of the "silkworm chamber"—apparently this silkworm-rearing method had already been well-developed in the Qin and Han dynasties.

Throughout March and April, silkworm-raising households essentially shut down all other activities. Villages saw few passersby; neighbors and relatives stopped visiting each other entirely; every household posted red paper outside their doors. Even local officials would not venture into the countryside during this period.

Harvested cocoons were mostly reeled into silk by the silkworm farmers themselves for sale. Some sold dried cocoons directly to "cocoon brokers," but this was mainly for households lacking labor or having special circumstances.

"Why do people make their own raw silk?" Zhao Yingong asked.

"Selling cocoons to the cocoon brokers involves too many 'tricks'—country folk always get cheated." Wang Siniang said the cocoon brokers were required to have government-issued trading licenses, giving them strong monopoly power. There was also a trade "guild"—when new cocoons came to market, the guild members would agree on which day to start weighing and which day to stop. Purchase prices were also set by agreement; no one was allowed to raise their own prices. The agreed prices were always very low.

Low prices aside, there were various "tricks" during cocoon purchasing. Either they claimed the cocoons were "too damp" or they deducted weight. Worst of all, to further depress prices, cocoon warehouses would suddenly close for several days during peak cocoon season, halting all purchases.

"Why would they halt purchasing?"

Wang Siniang said: "Cocoons can't wait once harvested. If you don't reel the silk or sell them quickly, after a few days the pupae inside will bite through the cocoons, making them worthless. Country folk have no choice but to sell cheap."

So that's how it works! Zhao Yingong thought. This was essentially an artificial "difficulty selling cocoons," causing purchase prices to plunge. Such schemes were abundant in the old time-space too.

Zhao Yingong asked: "After the cocoon brokers buy the cocoons, how do they sell them?"

"They reel the silk themselves and sell it to silk merchants. Inside and outside Hangzhou city, there are many households who don't raise silkworms themselves but reel silk for others." The cocoon brokers would contract out the cocoons to these households for reeling, paying processing fees by weight.

Whenever conditions allowed, silkworm-raising households preferred to reel their own silk and sell raw silk, as this was more profitable. The reeling work was done by the household's women—an important rural sideline. Wang Siniang and her daughter had done it by hand in the Shen household.

The Shen family wife roughly demonstrated, with gestures, how to reel silk by hand. For reeling, one used a large pot of boiling water. Each time, ten to twenty cocoons were put in and stirred with bamboo sticks to scald them. When the water boiled, one swept the surface with the bamboo sticks, and the silk ends would naturally float up. Taking the silk ends by hand, threading them through a bamboo needle eye, rotating the guiding spindle, then hooking them on the thread-transferring rod and sending them up to the foot-treadle-powered "big frame wheel"—operating while treading the wheel would draw out a continuous stream of raw silk.

Reeling was arduous work. Once cocoons formed, every moment counted. If the silk wasn't reeled quickly, the pupae would metamorphose and bite through. Then the cocoons would be useless. So during reeling season, the entire family worked together; even men helped out, working day and night. A skilled laborer could reel about thirty *liang* of silk per day. For especially fine "headwrap silk," daily output was only twenty *liang*.

Zhao Yingong hadn't read specialized books on sericulture, but common sense told him that such hand-processed products had low efficiency and poor quality. In the old time-space in the late Qing, once native silk encountered Japanese raw silk produced using modern silkworm-raising and reeling methods, it was utterly defeated in international markets.

"Where is the best silk produced locally?" Zhao Yingong asked.

"Reporting to the Master, locally, Renhe County produces the best silk," Wang Siniang said carefully. "But speaking of Zhejiang Province, the best is Huzhou silk. The Seven-*li* Silk from Nanxun in Huzhou Prefecture is famously fine. Gui'an, Deqing, Chongde, Tongxiang counties all produce good silk, and only after them comes our local Renhe County's raw silk."

"Renhe County mostly produces 'thick silk,' while Huzhou and Jiaxing produce 'fine silk,'" Wang Siniang explained. For weaving patterned satins and silks, the warp thread had to be "fine silk." This was because the jacquard looms used for weaving satins had certain strength requirements for warp thread, and the raw silk from these two regions was strong and not prone to breaking. Other raw silk basically couldn't be used in jacquard looms.

"Even the local Weaving Office and Dyeing Bureau in Hangzhou City—when weaving satins for imperial use—must specially procure raw silk from Huzhou and Jiaxing. Raw silk from local Renhe and Qiantang counties is actually used less."

Zhao Yingong listened attentively. Clearly, the sericulture industry, like Leizhou's sugar industry, was currently in a state of small-scale production. Handicraft production and small-amount high-interest loans were indeed common forms in this time-space's industry and commerce. There were far too many places where one could intervene and profit. Seven or eight ideas were spinning in his head simultaneously; it seemed he could get involved at every link... He shook his head to calm himself, sorted out a general direction, and then resumed the interrupted conversation.

"Where do you sell the silk you reel?"

"There are specialized silk merchants who buy it. As soon as raw silk comes out, the 'silk traders' come to the market towns." Wang Siniang said the silk market fluctuated, but ordinary raw silk had consistently stayed above thirty to forty taels per *dan*. Since the Wanli era, with large-scale export of raw silk and silk products, silk prices had continuously risen. Although some years were poor, most years the silk business remained profitable.

"Hmm," Zhao Yingong nodded. "Tell me more about the silk merchants—do they also need trading licenses? Do they also have a trade guild?"

"I've heard it's the same. But this servant usually only encounters the 'silk traders' who come to the countryside; the internal details I don't really know."

Wang Siniang said: Some silk merchants' "traders" also handled lending. Silkworm farmers could borrow from them and repay with raw silk when the new silk came out. It seemed convenient, but when repaying, the silk was valued very low, putting silkworm farmers at a great disadvantage.

In exploiting silkworm farmers, the "silk traders" were no kinder or more honest than the cocoon brokers. But once cocoons were reeled into new silk, there were also time constraints. Raw silk left too long would turn yellow. If silk traders deliberately delayed, they could certainly squeeze farmers' prices, but the silk they received would then have less time for their own sales. So deliberately delaying to cut prices was rare. Silkworm farmers could get somewhat better treatment.

"Where does the silk merchants' raw silk ultimately go?"

"Mostly sold to various weaving workshops, and also sold to merchants from other regions."

"Are there many locally-woven satins and silks?"

"Reporting to the Master, how could there not be many?" Wang Siniang smiled. "Setting aside everything else, just the Eastern and Western Bureaus in this city, plus the two Dyeing Bureaus, have a quota of several thousand bolts of robes and fabrics each year. That's not counting other categories. All together, just the silk fabrics for imperial tribute amount to over ten thousand bolts annually."

The mention of the Eastern and Western Bureaus caught his attention. Seeing his puzzled expression, Cai Shi quickly explained: "Those are the Weaving Offices the court has established in Hangzhou. Located just east of Puji Bridge. The satins and silks woven there are all for imperial use." The two Dyeing Bureaus were similarly official large-scale workshops, quite substantial in scale.

Zhao Yingong asked: "Can you weave silk?"

"This servant cannot. Silk weaving is done by specialized artisans—passed down from father to son or master to apprentice. It's not something a country woman like this servant could learn."

"You may go for now. In a few days, I'll have tasks for you." Zhao Yingong said, then turned to Sun Wangcai. "Enroll these children in the charity school as well."

*The hand-operated reeling machine can be found in "The Exploitation of the Works of Nature."*

*"Headwrap silk" was especially fine silk specifically used for weaving head wraps.*
