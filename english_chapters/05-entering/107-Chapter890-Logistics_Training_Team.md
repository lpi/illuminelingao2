# Chapter 890 - Logistics Training Team

Although both Army and Navy People's Commissars gave not very optimistic views—especially He Ming, who frankly told Wu De that the Army's current condition wasn't good. Troops continuously executing security war combat missions had become very exhausted. Although casualties in security warfare were small—a death report only every many days—such endless combat and duty had lowered troop morale. Currently, security warfare in Northern Qiongzhou had ended completely; Southern Qiongzhou was sparsely populated and the scale of security warfare was smaller. The Army intended to withdraw some troops for rest and reorganization. Under these circumstances, immediately throwing them into the next long-range combat operation was probably inappropriate. However, He Ming still promised to deploy two infantry battalions and some support troops to participate in "Operation Engine."

The Navy promised to provide one marine battalion and fully provide ships to participate in this operation. Chen Haiyang had no certainty about exactly how many ships could be deployed—old ships were undergoing comprehensive refits; the number of ships the Navy could commit depended heavily on the shipbuilding speed of Lingao and Hong Kong shipyards.

While Yang Zeng was busy receiving Schneider and others, Xie Shu was leading NCOs of the Ma'niao Fort Logistics Training Team to queue up and head for the logistics warehouse. Their task was to count and organize newly arrived materials while learning new management processes in real-time.

In the promotion wave after the Chengmai Campaign, Xie Shu removed the word "probationary" from Probationary Staff Officer. However, his rank was still Second Lieutenant. He also joined the training course and, due to excellent grades, had transferred from Battalion Logistics Staff Officer to Logistics Command. He was dissatisfied with this transfer: Logistics Command sounded high-level, but actually had only one office, one elder Chief Staff Officer, and several staff personnel, having little presence in the army.

But recently he had received news: Logistics Command was "about to undergo major adjustment." A dedicated Logistics Teaching Unit had opened at Ma'niao Fort to train professional logistics officers, while a Logistics Training Team was established to train all army logistics NCOs. Xie Shu served as a squad leader in this training team.

Although Xie Shu hadn't been in logistics long, he was literate, understood arithmetic, and was young and eager to learn. He had experienced the Second Counter-Encirclement Battle, so he possessed knowledge and experience. During his studies, he was deeply appreciated by Hong Huangnan and Thorpe—Thorpe was transferred from the Planning Commission to the Army recently to supervise logistics work.

Thorpe was young, but in the old time-space, he had written a work titled *Theoretical Logistics*. He had a background in operations research and was originally a key capable member of the Planning Commission, typical of "academic" logistics cadres. If not for his wish to wear a uniform, plus the Planning Commission's intent to cultivate a professional, capable logistics organization, Wu De wouldn't have been willing to let him go.

Because his theoretical foundation was solid, he was responsible for teaching most logistics officer and NCO training courses. He had a subtle relationship with the "pragmatic" Hong Huangnan. The two maintained a polite reserve. But every time Hong Huangnan talked about his increasingly remote plan for a "Carriage 4S Shop," Thorpe always listened silently with an accommodating smile.

Although Xie Shu was young, he came from a landlord family and had attended school—he found the peculiar relationship between these two "Chiefs" not hard to understand. Thus he maintained equal respect for both teachers.

Xie Shu's sleeve now sported a new service arm patch. This was put on personally by his military academy teacher, Elder Major Thorpe. His old superior Dongmen Chuiyu joked when meeting him: "Little Xie, transferred to the Four General Headquarters, eh."

Xie Shu was very confused by this. Australian chiefs liked to call people "Little X," even calling each other that. Xie Shu felt that was how big households addressed domestic servants or bachelors. Xie Shu preferred others to call him Staff Officer Xie. As for "Four General Headquarters," it was even more baffling. he could recite regulations backward, but never heard of this organ. Going back and flipping through organization regulations, he didn't find a unit called "Four General Headquarters."

In the loading/unloading work area in front of the warehouse zone, various new vehicles and tools were neatly arranged: screw-type manual forklifts, trailers, standard military animal-drawn carts, Purple Lightning Improved handcarts, towed field kitchens, water purification carts, etc., and even movable wooden ramps. Animal carts and Purple Lightning Improved handcarts were redesigned; the load-bearing concave iron chassis could fit exactly a one-ton or 200kg transport crate, with fasteners for easy securing. These materials took great energy for Thorpe to pry out of the Executive Committee and Planning Commission. If the blast furnace hadn't started operation, the "Second Standardization of Cart Axles" proclaimed by Thorpe couldn't have started implementation so early.

Xie Shu first explained the general purpose, usage methods, and vehicle structure of these logistics vehicles. Depending on the logistics units NCOs served in, the vehicle types they encountered differed, but the training syllabus required every logistics commander to "be familiar with usage methods and understand vehicle structure" of common vehicles.

Next to the warehouse was the animal shed, containing donkeys, oxen, and hinnies; the only things missing were horses and mules. To reverse the long-term shortage of horses and livestock in troops and lack of relevant training for artillery/logistics/engineer soldiers, the Planning Commission and Agricultural Committee organized a joint investigation team. Disregarding Nick's strong opposition, they screened horses, donkeys, and mules at Mopanling Horse Farm. Aside from retaining breeding studs and sufficient quantity of dams for expanding the population, all other horses, donkeys, and mules unsuitable for breeding were transferred out of the farm for allocation. Part went to the Agricultural Committee, part to the Fubo Army.

According to the latest Fubo Army planning directive: most draft horses and mules were prioritized for artillery troops, with a small amount left for cavalry units currently being formed.

Though horses were few, at least troops had horses now. Especially transport troops. Because the Fubo Army lacked horses and mules, long-term land transport relied on "oxen pulling bulk, humans carrying small loads." Ox carts were too slow; for urgent transport cargo, militia and migrant workers had to be requisitioned to use handcarts or simply carry loads on shoulders. Labor consumption was extremely high.

The warehouse guard meticulously checked Xie Shu's ID and authorization documents, counted the number of Logistics Training Team members entering, and registered them one by one with a dip pen. Xie Shu signed his name on the entry/exit registration card with a brush—pitifully few naturalized citizens could write with a brush; even fewer in the army.

Although the warehouse garrison was deployed by Xie Shu personally, and sentries were familiar with most people in various teaching units and training teams studying at Ma'niao, since a certain soldier was made an example of during a surprise inspection, no one dared to be careless anymore.

The warehouse at Ma'niao Fort was a new standard warehouse built according to standards of the new *Military Material Storage Regulations*. The warehouse used an iron-clad wood truss structure, with glass windows opened near the ceiling. The entire warehouse was high, with good air circulation. It had sufficient natural lighting while avoiding direct sunlight. Warehouse walls were built with hollow bricks for heat insulation; insulation materials were also laid on the ceiling under the roof to reduce heat from sunlight radiation.

Hundreds and thousands of crates were neatly stacked on racks and pallets. Crates were painted different colors with numbers written on them. Different colored crates were stacked in different areas according to regulations. Xie Shu knew stacked crates were divided into 1000kg, 200kg, and 20 liter types. 1000kg crates were used on animal carts; 200kg and 20 liter crates were mainly used on Purple Lightning Improved handcarts.

Each crate model had exactly identical dimensions. Crates had pull rings on four sides and fasteners at the bottom for connecting and fixing to chassis. Crate skeletons used angle steel riveting; crate panels were wood coated with coal tar; crate lining was a layer of oilcloth. Stamped on top in red paint were the mark vulgarly known as "Iron Fist Violating Chrysanthemum" and a serial number. Finally, a row of small characters: "Property of the Senate."

In Lingao, packaging crates were not consumables; every crate was registered and had to be recycled for reuse after use.

With standard packaging crate dimensions, future design dimensions for shipbuilding and vehicle manufacturing would have certain reference values.

The purpose of Xie Shu bringing the training team NCOs here was to teach cargo classification management and distribution processes. Although the National Stock Code was advanced, in an era relying completely on manual operation and data transmission by telegraph or manpower, mastering and proficiently using this system required great effort. Especially since this system currently ran on forms. Workload and calculation volume were immense.

To facilitate management by NCOs with low education, besides the code system, Thorpe and Hong Huangnan invented a color/pattern recognition system, using various colors and patterns for simple category marking.

While Xie Shu was busy explaining the color/pattern recognition system to the training team, his current direct superior Thorpe was sitting straight in the Joint Operations Command conference room, where several bigwigs of the Fubo Army also sat.

"If there are no other questions, it's decided. We'll report to the Executive Committee and Organization Department immediately," Chen Haiyang said.

"What about Staff Officer Hong?" Thorpe asked.

"He's going to Guangzhou to set up the Carriage 4S Shop." Chen Haiyang waved his hand. "Someone in the Ministry of Colonization and Trade is interested in that Carriage 4S Shop. We studied with the Planning Commission and decided to let Staff Officer Hong go to Guangzhou first to set up a pilot Carriage 4S Shop with Colonization Trade Ministry people. This pilot station belongs to the Ministry of Colonization and Trade. Of course, Staff Officer Hong's personnel establishment remains in Logistics Command; doing this is his profession. Besides, his proposal to buy horses from the Southwest via Guangzhou also passed. Let him get some horses back in Guangzhou first. Yunnan horses are small, but getting a few hundred to pull carts is still not bad."
