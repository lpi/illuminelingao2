# Chapter 1151 - The Case

"For the Senate and People!" Xu Ke shouted the standard salutation.

"Service, service." Ming Qiu nodded and gestured toward the sofa. "Have a seat."

Once seated, Ming Qiu got straight to the point: "Looking at your file, before D-Day, you were a police officer?"

"Yes. First I worked in traffic enforcement for two years, then criminal investigation for three years, and finally one year in the Legal Section until the transmigration." Xu Ke sat stiffly on the sofa, hands on his knees, answering with some nervousness.

"Don't be so formal—relax." Ming Qiu smiled. "You've served in the military?"

"I enlisted during my third year of university. Served two years in the North Sea Fleet."

"So your background is quite varied. After D-Day you worked in the Navy, then in the External Intelligence Bureau—you've covered the military, police, guards, and intelligence, haven't you?"

Xu Ke slowly realized what this was about. He didn't answer, instead waiting for Ming Qiu to get to the point.

"Here's something I'd like you to look at first." Ming Qiu picked up a folder from his desk and handed it to Xu Ke.

Opening the folder, Xu Ke found several photographs at the front. At this stage, with materials brought from the future being steadily consumed and substitutes not yet in mass production, photographs were rare outside of a few essential purposes.

The photos were of a type he knew all too well: crime scene photographs.

The first photograph showed the body of a completely naked man lying on a beach. He wore nothing at all, and—most disturbingly—he had no head.

"This is a murder case discovered yesterday on the beach. The body washed ashore. Although the head is missing, the fatal wound appears to be a knife wound to the victim's lower back.

"At the time, the victim's identity was unknown, and it wasn't clear whether the crime occurred within our jurisdiction, so the Kaohsiung Police Station initially handled it. But yesterday afternoon, someone identified the victim by his tattoo as a Navy petty officer, a naturalized citizen named Zhang Qianniu. The police took fingerprints and compared them against Zhang Qianniu's file records, confirming his identity—he hadn't returned to base the previous night. No one imagined he'd met such a violent end!" Ming Qiu paused deliberately at this point. Xu Ke still said nothing, listening attentively.

"Since this case involves naval personnel, after discussing it with Wei Bachi, I've decided to take over the case from the police station. Considering you're the only person in the Navy with investigative experience, we're assigning it to you. What do you say?" Ming Qiu finished and looked at Xu Ke, waiting.

Although Ming Qiu's words ended in a question, Xu Ke understood perfectly well that this was, in fact, a statement. He immediately stood up and responded clearly: "I guarantee I will complete the mission."

A smile appeared on Ming Qiu's face. He gestured: "Sit down first. I'm no expert in solving cases, but can you tell me your plan?"

Xu Ke spoke slowly, carefully considering his words: "First, I plan to visit the scene, conduct interviews in the surrounding area—perhaps someone saw or heard something. Then I'll work from the victim's social connections and activities in the days before his death, see who he associated with, whether he had any enemies, and try to find some leads to determine my next steps."

As he spoke, Xu Ke couldn't help but find the situation somewhat ironic—even in this new world, he was still doing his old job.

Ming Qiu nodded. "Very good. Let's proceed that way for now. Do you have any difficulties or requests?"

"What about my current work at the External Intelligence Bureau?"

"I've already contacted Jiang Shan. He agrees with my view: let Li Di cover for you temporarily. You can brief him when needed."

"I'll need some personnel to help me conduct interviews in East Gate Market and other areas. Also, I'll need authorization to question civilians and military personnel alike. And I'll need the cooperation of the police station."

"All of that can be arranged. Personnel from the Base Service Company are at your disposal. I'll issue orders immediately appointing you as the Security Officer of Kaohsiung Base. All naval personnel must cooperate with your inquiries. As for civilians, I've already spoken with Ma Jia at the Arbitration Tribunal—he's given you authorization. Here are the documents." Ming Qiu produced two documents as he spoke.

"I'll also need Zhang Qianniu's personal file," Xu Ke added quickly.

"You can get that from my adjutant later." Ming Qiu was very accommodating. "When can you start?"

"I need to study the case materials first. I can begin this afternoon."

Xu Ke immediately set to work on the investigation, first reading Zhang Qianniu's file. Zhang Qianniu's background was similar to most naval personnel: born a fisherman, parents deceased early, one brother and one sister who had each gone their own way; their current whereabouts were unknown. He had once served under the pirate Zhu Cailao, and after the great rout at Nanri Island, he and some former comrades drifted to the Guangdong coast to continue their pirate career. He surrendered during the Navy's pirate suppression and recruitment operations, then joined the Navy.

His service record in the Navy was unremarkable. Due to his age and physical condition, Zhang Qianniu wasn't assigned to combat squadrons. He had served long-term in patrol and guard units, executing numerous patrol missions. With little education and only a Grade C literacy certificate, he couldn't be selected for officer training. He had remained a deck hand on special service boats. Currently, his vessel—Coastal Patrol Boat 041, a single-masted patrol craft—was docked at Kaohsiung, undergoing maintenance and awaiting orders.

Zhang Qianniu had never been an important figure among pirates; he'd never commanded a ship. But he had joined the ranks at sixteen and spent over a decade moving through various pirate gangs—a typical backbone member of pirate organizations who knew many people. Thus, the political review assessment noted: "Makes friends easily, values loyalty, complex social connections."

Family and personal life: No dependents. Not particularly interested in women—occasionally visited brothels during shore leave. No homosexual tendencies or behavior.

The Political Security General Administration's rating from his time in the training camp was III-C—controllable use, third tier. Xu Ke turned to his most recent political assessment: III-B. For someone who had served over two years as a veteran sailor, his political rating was on the low side.

He then reviewed the related reports from the Political Security General Administration's "Ten-Man Team" system, which noted that Zhang Qianniu was "prone to violence, undisciplined, and lax."

Looking at his disciplinary record, there were over a dozen infractions—"no major offenses, but constant minor ones"—mostly related to his violent tendencies and lack of discipline. Violations involving alcohol dominated the list. Some involved returning to ship late after drinking; others were drunken brawls. The three most recent incidents had occurred within the past month alone.

It was no surprise that his career hadn't advanced much; given his service time and patrol missions, he should have made senior petty officer by now.

Xu Ke had already sketched a rough portrait of the man in his mind: low education, poor learning ability, fond of drinking, valued camaraderie.

For such a person to be suddenly murdered and have his head brutally severed and thrown into the sea—the motive for this crime was becoming complex.

Since he wasn't involved with women and wasn't homosexual, it clearly wasn't a crime of passion. If it were robbery-murder, a navy petty officer with his lifestyle wouldn't have much savings. Moreover, soldiers' pay was mostly paid via bank transfers to savings accounts—he wouldn't have had much cash on him.

His complex social connections were a difficulty, but this was Kaohsiung, not a place just anyone could come to. Over ninety percent of Kaohsiung's population lived under near-imprisonment conditions. Those who could move freely—every single one could be traced with clear whereabouts and backgrounds.

Xu Ke became alert: removing the head and stripping off the clothes was clearly to prevent identification if the body was found. Even in the 21st century, this was an effective counter-investigation technique. If not for someone recognizing his tattoo, Zhang Qianniu might have forever worn the unexplained label of "missing."

After much deliberation, Xu Ke called the medical station and asked for Lei En, inquiring about Zhang Qianniu's autopsy report.

Lei En was a professional epidemic prevention officer, dispatched by the Health Department to head the Kaohsiung medical station. He told Xu Ke over the phone that the examination confirmed the fatal wound was indeed the knife wound to the lower back, but large amounts of alcohol had been found in the stomach and blood—reaching the threshold for intoxication. The victim had very likely been gotten drunk before being killed. As for the head, it was indeed severed after death.

"Can you determine the murder weapon?"

"From the wound characteristics, the weapon was a dagger. The head was removed with a standard naval cutlass," Lei En said. "I heard the weapons weren't found. But I compared the wounds against a Navy cutlass."

"Thank you. Please preserve the body for a few more days."

"No problem. Call me if anything comes up."

Xu Ke hung up and began reviewing the records he'd requisitioned.

According to records from the Qijin Naval Base, Zhang Qianniu had left at 2:00 PM two days ago, with his recorded destination being Kaohsiung city center—where there was a sizeable Army-Navy Service Club with a tavern, restaurant, and shops. Off-duty soldiers often went there to relax. By regulation, he should have returned to base by 6:00 PM.

According to the records of the Army-Navy Joint Patrol Team after 18:00 that day, Zhang Qianniu's name wasn't among those detained for failure to return on time. Clearly, by 18:00 he had either been killed or was being held somewhere in secret.

Xu Ke personally visited the service club. The staff quickly recognized Zhang Qianniu from his photograph, saying he came there occasionally. But because he'd been arrested for drunken disturbances two or three times, he hadn't been seen there recently.

Clearly, on the day of the incident, Zhang Qianniu hadn't gone to the service club. So where had he gone to drink?

Xu Ke immediately ordered that several sailors close to Zhang Qianniu, along with his direct commanding officer, be summoned for questioning.

From these people he learned an important clue: Zhang Qianniu had recently been frequenting taverns on Commercial Street.
