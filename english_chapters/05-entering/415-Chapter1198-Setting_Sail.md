# Chapter 1198 - Setting Sail

Under Qian Shuiting's tireless coordination, all preparations were finally completed in early July—their time was running short. According to historical records, the Manila Galleon would arrive in Manila at the end of July. They had to reach the standby location around July 15th to begin searching for the galleon.

Ship readiness work proceeded quickly. Equipment on the *Feiyun* unrelated to navigation was all dismantled where detachable, and unused cabins and equipment were sealed to free up more space for supplies.

Besides Qian Shuiting, Zhou Weisen's many guns and their supporting equipment on the *Feiyun* were also dismantled this time—the Planning Commission designated a warehouse to store everything. Qian Shuiting also wanted to find a proper place to settle these items; keeping them aboard the ship exposed them to severe corrosion from salt spray.

But currently, the General Office wouldn't agree to individual Elders building detached wooden houses. Putting these items in apartments was both cramped and unsafe—the large amount of pyrotechnic materials alone was headache-inducing.

*Have to find a breach in the General Office...* Qian Shuiting pondered. Perhaps get a mountain clubhouse or something in the name of the Feiyun Club?

The *Feiyun*'s diesel engine and various electronic equipment had undergone debugging and maintenance and were judged suitable for maritime service. The Planning Commission also specially approved gasoline strictly for *Feiyun*'s use—all "Ji-style gasoline" fractionated from coal tar. Although Qian Shuiting was uneasy about this fuel, there was no other choice now.

Regarding Elders accompanying the ships, Qian Shuiting insisted on going himself: his reasoning was that he was the project initiator and very familiar with the *Feiyun*, able to serve as its captain. He also wanted Zhou Weisen to come along—though bringing him meant somewhat farming merit for the Otaku Party. Fortunately, the justifications were ample: Zhou Weisen was the Special Recon Team's guest shooting instructor, proficient in tactics, able to lead Special Recon in clearing operations. Additionally, operating the *Feiyun* was a specialized skill, and furthermore, he was Miss Mendoza's husband—and Mendoza's Spanish was mandatory for this operation.

Besides the Zhou couple, there were Lü Yang and Lin Chuanqing—the latter temporarily serving concurrent duty as captain of *Nongchao*. Finally, Planning Commission representative Sun Xiao would act as supervisor to monitor, register, and catalogue spoils.

The chlorine cylinder was also quietly hoisted onto the *Nongchao* one night. The cylinder wasn't fully pressurized—after all, it had to endure long-distance jostling at sea, and the cylinder's age was somewhat concerning. The cylinder was wrapped layer by layer in soft materials, fixed inside a well-sealed box, surrounded by paper packets full of quickite. Dark cloth was placed at the valve as a leakage indicator.

The box was secured separately in a cabin at the bottom of the ship—below the waterline, where temperature remained relatively low, and the cabin itself was sealed.

"Don't rush down when opening the hatch. Check if the cloth has faded first. Have a water hose ready at the hatch; if there's really a leak, flood it." Xu Yingjie from the Chemical Ministry, who had delivered the chlorine bottle, issued his warnings, then handed them another box. "These are the protective equipment."

Inside the box, besides gas masks for Elders, were anti-poison gauze masks manufactured by the Chemical Ministry itself—to be soaked in alkaline solution before use. Additionally, there was a batch of disposable goggles made by the optical factory using deerskin and glass lenses.

"Although I approve of this idea, implementing it might prove considerably difficult," Xu Yingjie said. "Absolutely, absolutely pay attention to safety—especially wind direction."

"Don't worry."

On the morning of July 4th, the formation set sail from Bopu Port. It was a clear and hot summer morning. The rising sun in the east dyed all sails red, like torches. Unlike the warm send-off scenes common when the Navy went to war, this operation held no ceremony. The four ships merged with a transport formation heading to Sanya, looking like an ordinary scheduled transport voyage carrying coal and machinery with escorts. Only Elders would notice that all Executive Committee members had casually appeared at the dock where *Feiyun* was moored to see off this formation.

After farewells from the Executive Committee and families, the Elders boarded *Feiyun* and the other ships in turn. Wen Desi stood on the dock conversing with other Executive Committee members.

"Old Qian, since you insist on going, so be it. Pay attention to safety and come back early. Don't forget to send telegrams from each ship every day."

"Don't trouble yourself worrying too much, Old Xiao. Just wait for our silver." Qian Shuiting laughed as he boarded *Feiyun*, waving to them from the aft deck. Pan Pan was busy using a telephoto lens to snap this leadership-style freeze-frame photo.

No flags representing Elder status flew from *Feiyun*—neither Qian Shuiting's personal Elder flag nor the Executive Committee flag for his position. Only the blue and white Navy flag waved in the wind.

With a long whistle, each ship began raising half-sails in turn, exiting the port with the gentle southeast breeze. *Feiyun* departed last; its beautiful white hull was dyed exceptionally brilliant by the morning light turning golden. Qian Shuiting, still standing on the aft deck in his white Navy uniform, seemed bathed in a halo.

Not long after exiting the port and sailing parallel with the barge team and escort ships, the formation began hoisting full sails. The four ships originally at the tail of the line broke formation, soon sailing parallel with the escort formation, hoisting "Goodbye" signal flags, while the escort formation responded with "Bon Voyage" flags.

"Too bad I didn't get a turn for this mission—otherwise I'm a chemical warfare expert!" Watching the formation depart, Xi Yazhou, who had recently come to Lingao to report and take leave, couldn't help muttering to himself. But he didn't feel much regret, because he had already heard grapevine news during this Lingao stay: he would soon be transferred to serve as Army Chief of Staff.

Soon the task force surpassed the escort formation with a speed surplus of five knots, gradually drawing away until it disappeared below the western horizon.

"Maximum power, full speed ahead." The flagship signaled. Boilers on all ships increased pressure; smokestacks puffed black smoke, and white spray rose from sterns.

"This is our first full-steam powered formation voyage since the crossing—setting a navigation record. Later our ship can fly the blue ribbon," said one of the Elders on the *Feiyun*.

Wen Desi wasn't going on the operation; he was hitching a ride to Sanya to "inspect work"—*Feiyun* was much more comfortable than ordinary colliers.

On the route rounding the west of Hainan Island, everything proceeded smoothly. Only once did *Nongchao*'s boiler develop a small issue, but far less serious than the notorious "Bomb Boiler." Testing of *Feiyun*'s surface search radar also proved very successful—in fact, after leaving the transport formation more than twenty nautical miles behind, they could still see their signal echoes on radar.

Because boiler repairs delayed some time, and they didn't rely entirely on steam power when sailing against the wind but practiced zigzag tacking, overall speed wasn't as fast as hoped. Still, it took only twenty-eight hours from Bopu to Yulin Port in Sanya, with an average speed of nine knots. They docked at Yulin Port at noon the next day. The formation rested briefly while Elder engineers in Sanya immediately boarded to inspect the power systems. Massive amounts of Hongji anthracite stockpiled on the dock filled the bunkers.

Administrator of Sanya District Wang Luobin treated the formation's Elders to dinner at the Elder Club in Yalong Bay, serving as both reception and send-off. Unfortunately, with the long voyage imminent, he couldn't treat everyone to rum or the local specialty high-proof arrack—only kvass.

After dinner, the Elders all returned to the ships. Wang Luobin saw them to the dock. Years later he could still recall that scene: "At that time moonlight shimmered on the waves. I heard faint singing from the ship: 'Young sailors rest their heads on the waves.' The singing was beautiful but slightly stiff; it must have been Miss Mendoza."

Zhou Weisen returned to the ship and inspected the systems in the engine room once more. Returning to his cabin, he found himself locked out by Mendoza. "Just wait a moment." So he waited. Before long the door opened. Mendoza appeared before him wearing a pirate outfit cobbled together from who knows where—sunglasses substituting for an eyepatch, half a colorful peacock feather stuck in a tricorne hat. The deep V-neck of her tight top revealed skin tanned somewhat bronze by Hainan's sun, and a revolver and small cutlass were stuck in her belt.

Zhou Weisen instantly felt his temples buzzing, blood vessels pulsing violently below. He couldn't help licking his slightly dry lips, mumbling: "My god, my dear."

While someone fought three hundred rounds, Wang Luobin and Wen Desi were drinking happily in the wind on the wooden platform of the stilt house at the Elder Club in the shallow waters of Yalong Bay. Reminiscing about the past, Wang Luobin couldn't help laughing: "Old Wen, robbing silver is indeed faster money than peddling mirrors and porcelain!"

"Of course. From our first day in Guangzhou until now, we've come so far!" Wen Desi stood with hands on hips facing the sea, feeling the gentle breeze, spirit refreshed. He smiled and said, "We really need to have a proper catch-up."

"Why aren't you going along for the robbery?" Wang Luobin asked. "I recall you were also very interested in these things. Don't want to cosplay a pirate?"

"Why should I go rob?" Chairman Wen smiled, his voice dropping to a whisper. "A son of a thousand gold sits not near the hall's edge. I'm at least the Executive Committee Chairman now; going to Philippine waters in summer—is that preparing to wrestle with typhoons?"

After resting for a day and receiving the engineer report that "power systems are all normal," the formation set sail again, exiting the port southward, then heading far into the east.

*Note: The 1632 Manila Galleon actually arrived in port in May. Modifications were made here for plot requirements.*
