# Chapter 1198 - Setting Sail

Under Qian Shuiting's all-out coordination, all preparations were finally completed in early July—their time was running short. According to historical records, the Manila Galleon would arrive in Manila at the end of July. They had to rush to the standby location around July 15th to search for the galleon.

Ship readiness work was completed very quickly. Equipment on the *Feiyun* unrelated to navigation was all dismantled if detachable, and unused cabins and equipment were sealed to free up more space for supplies.

Besides Qian Shuiting, Zhou Weisen's many guns and supporting equipment on the *Feiyun* were also dismantled this time—the Planning Commission designated a warehouse to store everything. Qian Shuiting also wanted to find a place to properly settle these things; after all, keeping them on the ship exposed them to severe corrosion from salt spray.

But currently, the General Office didn't agree to individual Elders building detached wooden houses. Putting these items in apartments was both crowded and unsafe—the large amount of pyrotechnic materials alone was headache-inducing.

"Have to find a breach in the General Office..." Qian Shuiting pondered, maybe get a mountain clubhouse or something in the name of the Feiyun Club?

*Feiyun*'s diesel engine and various electronic equipment had undergone debugging and maintenance, judged suitable for maritime service. The Planning Commission also specially approved gasoline strictly for *Feiyun*'s use—all "Ji-style gasoline" fractionated from coal tar. Although Qian Shuiting was very uneasy about this oil, there was no other choice now.

Regarding Elders accompanying the ships, Qian Shuiting insisted on going himself: the reason being he was the project initiator and very familiar with the *Feiyun*, able to serve as its captain. Besides, he wanted Zhou Weisen to go too: although pulling him along meant somewhat farming merit for the Otaku Party. Fortunately, the reasons were very sufficient: Zhou Weisen was the Special Recon Team's guest shooting instructor, proficient in tactics, able to lead Special Recon in clearing operations. Also, driving the *Feiyun* was a specialized skill, and furthermore, he was Miss Mendoza's husband, and Mendoza's Spanish was mandatory for this operation.

Besides the Zhou couple, there were Lü Yang and Lin Chuanqing—the latter temporarily concurrently serving as captain of *Nongchao*. Finally, Planning Commission representative Sun Xiao: as supervisor to monitor, register, and catalogue spoils.

The chlorine cylinder was also quietly lifted onto the *Nongchao* one night. The cylinder wasn't fully pressurized—after all, it had to endure long-distance tossing at sea, and the cylinder's age was a bit worrying. The cylinder was wrapped layer by layer in soft materials, fixed into a well-sealed box, surrounded by paper packets full of quicklime. Dark cloth was placed at the valve as a leakage indicator.

The box was fixed separately in a cabin at the bottom of the ship—this was below the waterline, temperature relatively low, and the cabin itself was sealed.

"Don't rush down when opening the hatch. Check if the cloth has faded first. Have a water hose ready at the hatch; if it really leaks, flood it." Xu Yingjie from the Chemical Ministry who delivered the chlorine bottle warned, then handed them another box. "These are protective equipment."

Inside the box, besides gas masks for Elders, were anti-poison gauze masks manufactured by the Chemical Ministry itself—soak in alkaline solution before use. Additionally, there was a batch of disposable goggles made by the optical factory using deerskin and glass lenses.

"Although I approve of this idea, implementing it might have considerable difficulties," Xu Yingjie said. "Absolutely, absolutely pay attention to safety—especially wind direction."

"Don't worry."

On the morning of July 4th, the formation set sail from Bopu Port. It was a clear and hot summer morning. The rising sun in the east dyed all sails red, like torches. Unlike the warm send-off scenes common when the Navy went to war, this operation held no ceremony. The four ships combined with a transport formation heading to Sanya, looking like an ordinary scheduled transport voyage carrying coal and machinery with escorts. Only Elders would notice that all Executive Committee members had casually arrived at the dock where *Feiyun* was moored to see off this formation.

After farewells from the Executive Committee and families, the Elders boarded *Feiyun* and other ships in turn. Wen Desi stood on the dock conversing with other Executive Committee members.

"Old Qian, since you insist on going, so be it. Pay attention to safety, come back early. Don't forget to send telegrams from each ship every day."

"We won't trouble you, Old Xiao, to worry too much. Just wait for our silver." Qian Shuiting laughed as he boarded *Feiyun*, waving to them from the aft deck. Pan Pan was busy using a telephoto lens to snap this leadership-style freeze-frame photo.

No flags representing Elder status were raised on *Feiyun*, neither Qian Shuiting's personal Elder flag nor the Executive Committee flag for his position. Only the blue and white Navy flag flew.

With a long whistle, each ship began to raise half-sails in turn, exiting the port with the gentle southeast breeze. *Feiyun* exited last; its beautiful white hull was dyed exceptionally brilliant by the morning glow turning golden. Qian Shuiting, still standing on the aft deck in his white Navy uniform, seemed bathed in a halo.

Not long after exiting the port parallel with the barge team and escort ships, the formation began to hoist full sails. The four ships originally at the tail of the line broke formation, soon sailing parallel with the escort formation, hoisting "Goodbye" signal flags, while the escort formation responded with "Bon Voyage" flags.

"Too bad I didn't get a turn for this mission. Otherwise I'm a chemical warfare expert!" Watching the formation, Xi Yazhou, who had recently come to Lingao to report and take leave, couldn't help muttering to himself. But he didn't have much regret, because he had already heard grapevine news this time in Lingao: he would soon be transferred to serve as Army Chief of Staff.

Soon, the task force surpassed the escort formation with a speed excess of 5 knots, gradually moving away until disappearing below the western horizon.

"Maximum power, full speed ahead." The flagship signaled. Boilers on all ships increased pressure; smokestacks puffed black smoke, and white spray rose from sterns.

"This is our first full-steam powered formation voyage since the crossing; setting a navigation record. Later our ship can fly the blue ribbon," Wen Desi said to Qian Shuiting standing on *Feiyun*.

Wen Desi wasn't going on the operation; he was hitching a ride to Sanya to "inspect work"—*Feiyun* was much more comfortable than ordinary colliers.

On the route rounding the west of Hainan Island, everything went smoothly. Only once did *Nongchao*'s boiler have a small issue, but far less serious than the notorious "Bomb Boiler." Testing of *Feiyun*'s surface search radar was also very successful; in fact, after leaving the transport formation more than 20 nautical miles behind, they could still see their signal echoes on radar.

Because boiler repairs delayed some time, and they didn't rely entirely on steam power when sailing against the wind but practiced zigzag tacking, the overall speed wasn't as fast as expected. Still, it took only 28 hours from Bopu to Yulin Port in Sanya, with an average speed of 9 knots. They docked at Yulin Port at noon the next day. The formation rested briefly while Elder engineers in Sanya immediately boarded to inspect the power systems. Massive amounts of Hongji anthracite prepped on the dock filled the bunkers.

Administrator of Sanya District Wang Luobin treated the formation's Elders to dinner at the Elder Club in Yalong Bay, serving as both reception and send-off. Unfortunately, with the long voyage imminent, he couldn't treat everyone to rum or the local specialty high-proof arrack, only kvass.

After dinner, the Elders all returned to the ships. Wang Luobin saw them to the dock. Years later he could still recall that scene: "At that time moonlight shimmered on the waves. I heard faint singing from the ship: 'Young sailors rest their heads on the waves.' The singing was beautiful but slightly stiff; it must have been Miss Mendoza."

Zhou Weisen returned to the ship and inspected the systems in the engine room again. Returning to his cabin, he was locked out by Mendoza. "Just wait a moment." So he had to wait. Not long after, the door opened. Mendoza appeared before him wearing a pirate outfit pieced together from who knows where, wearing sunglasses instead of an eyepatch, half a colorful peacock feather stuck in a tricorne hat. The deep V-neck of her tight top revealed skin tanned somewhat brown by Hainan's sun, and a revolver and small cutlass were stuck in her belt.

Zhou Weisen instantly felt his temples buzzing, blood vessels below pulsing violently. He couldn't help licking his slightly dry lips, mumbling: "My god, my dear."

While someone fought three hundred rounds, Wang Luobin and Wen Desi were drinking happily in the wind on the wooden platform of the stilt house at the Elder Club in the shallow waters of Yalong Bay. Speaking of past events, Wang Luobin couldn't help laughing: "Old Wen, robbing silver is indeed faster money than peddling mirrors and porcelain!"

"Of course. From the first day in Guangzhou until now, we've come so far!" Wen Desi stood with hands on hips facing the sea, feeling the gentle sea breeze, spirit refreshed. He smiled and said, "We really need to catch up properly this time."

"Why aren't you going along for the robbery?" Wang Luobin asked. "I recall you were also very interested in these things. Don't want to cosplay a pirate?"

"Why should I go rob?" Chairman Wen smiled, whispering, "A son of a thousand gold sit not near the hall's edge. I, Old Wen, am at least the Executive Committee Chairman now; going to the Philippine waters in summer—is that preparing to wrestle with typhoons?"

After resting for a day and receiving the engineer report "power systems all normal," the formation set sail again, exiting the port southward, then heading far into the east.

Note: The 1632 Manila Galleon actually arrived in port in May. Modifications were made here for plot requirements.
