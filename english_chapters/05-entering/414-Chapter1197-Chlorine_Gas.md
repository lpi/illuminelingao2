# Chapter 1197 - Chlorine Gas

Qian Shuiting went down below deck. The layout of cabins, one by one, and even the cargo packaging in the hold were all complete. Fu Sansi said these were restored as much as possible according to historical records, also referencing confessions from several Spanish sailors.

"Confessions from Spaniards?" Qian Shuiting asked curiously. He didn't recall any Spaniards among the Senate's naturalized citizens.

"Captured at Bopu back then. Later they've been working in labor reform teams," Fu Sansi said. "Working for over two years counts as meeting redemption conditions. They were released and settled along with the Ah Sans captured at the same time early this year."

"Spaniards are easy to handle; at least they can be guides. What do we need Brothers San for?" Qian Shuiting said dissatisfiedly. "The languages from Brothers San's place are truly weird and varied; being guides holds no value."

"The Ah Sans went to the Agricultural Commission—don't know what Old Wu plans to use them for. The Spaniards stayed in the shipbuilding department to do odd jobs—two of them, one sailmaker and one carpenter, count as somewhat useful people. They seem very honest so far. Many details on this ship and how Spaniards conduct naval administration were provided by them."

Fu Sansi led him on a tour of the cabin layout. Qian Shuiting had seen many pictorial materials of galleon cabin layouts, but seeing the real object now appeared much more intuitive. Fu Sansi told him the paneling of these cabins was actually detachable and could be rearranged according to cabin layout diagrams of different ships, increasing diversity of choice.

"Shi Zhiqi often brings marines from Hong Kong here for drills; it's very lively," Fu Sansi said with a smile. "This Operation Hunger can draw a portion of men from the Marine Corps. They have sufficient training experience."

Since Shi Zhiqi went to Hong Kong, he had actively lobbied within the Navy Ministry to move the Marine Corps Headquarters to Hong Kong. The Navy was originally not very satisfied with Lingao as the main naval base either. Hong Kong, Sanya, or Kaohsiung were obviously more suitable. As an island and important route node near the Pearl River Delta, launching amphibious landings from Hong Kong was clearly much more convenient than from Lingao. Thus, the main force and headquarters of the Marine Corps were eventually transferred to Hong Kong. Currently, Hainan only retained a battalion headquarters commanding two marine companies in Sanya and Lingao, as well as squad and platoon-level detachments performing garrison duties across Hainan Island and Dongsha.

As project leader for Operation "Hunger," Qian Shuiting felt even more confident after touring the one-to-one training model. Although he had absolute confidence in the Navy's combat power, Spanish fanaticism was also famous. If emotions were incited and they refused to surrender even unto death, insisting on fighting a boarding battle with the marines, it wasn't impossible.

With this full-scale model, boarding marines could fully train specific tactical coordination, increasing chances of victory by a few more notches.

He occupied a room in the Navy Ministry building at Bopu, establishing the command headquarters for "Operation Hunger."

He first selected the Elders participating in this operation: Originally he wanted Zhou Weisen to be responsible for operating the *Feiyun* and commanding the formation. But Zhou Weisen stated that as a non-navy Elder, he had no prestige in the Navy and no rank—he probably wouldn't be able to command respect. After consideration, Qian Shuiting decided to ask Lin Chuanqing to serve as formation commander—he was General Commander of the Navy Fishing Fleet, with sufficiently high rank and position. Secondly, as an old snakehead, old smuggler, and old fisherman, his grasp of Southeast Asian sea conditions was more familiar than anyone else. His experience in operating and using small vessels was also the richest.

As for the two Type 901s, *Nongchao* and *Daishuang* were selected. These two warships were launched later than the first wave of four 901s. Although they encountered quite a few problems immediately upon launch, after repairs and break-in, their current condition was relatively good, and hull fouling was less, allowing direct deployment. Although *Daishuang*'s captain Lü Yang couldn't be said to have much experience, his advantage was youth and vitality, which was just right for gaining more long-voyage experience—with Lin Chuanqing holding the line, presumably there wouldn't be major problems.

Since the voyage to the Philippines was just over 2000 nautical miles round trip, relying solely on the 901's own coal capacity couldn't satisfy long-distance navigation and search standby, so a sail-steam hybrid fast collier was needed to accompany them: the *Haifeng*.

The two 901 gunboats underwent necessary modifications, adding rapid boarding bridges for boarding combat. Considering that if the opponent were a large galleon, the freeboard might be very high, "typewriters" were installed on the fore and aft mast tops of the 901s to suppress enemy deck fire and cover the boarding team climbing the ship.

"The sailors on board can be reselected and organized, picking experienced sailors. During Operation Giant last time, just sailing one week at sea had so many people puking half to death. This operation is at least a month round trip, and in the open sea with big waves; seasickness will be unbearable. Use more sailors who were formerly pirates," Qian Shuiting proposed at the preparatory meeting.

"That's not good. Now sailors and officers on every ship have formed a combat collective. Changing people all at once equals having to reintegrate," Lin Chuanqing shook his head. "The professional specialization of 901 posts is much higher than ordinary sailing ships; replacement isn't that easy. Besides, they've been sailing continuously at sea for over half a year; adaptability should be no problem. My main worry is wind direction." He swiped the chart. "Wind direction isn't great. By July the prevailing wind is already southeasterly. Coming back is convenient, but going will be very troublesome."

"Aren't 901s primarily steam-powered?"

"Headwind consumption is still very large. The 901's self-sustainment isn't optimistic. Once boilers are damaged, the whole plan is affected. And coaling at sea is technical work. We need to seize time to train more recently."

Key boarding personnel were selected from the marines—steam warship sailors were no longer "human dregs" who could be casually replaced; losing one required a considerable time to Retrain. Most Senate Navy warships were equipped with varying numbers of marines. One of their tasks was to conduct boarding operations when necessary. However, considering each galleon might have 400 sailors, this time a platoon of marines was specially reinforced on each 901, all selected by Shi Zhiqi from Hong Kong—members of the Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance Detachment who had participated in multiple simulated galleon boarding drills.

To ensure absolute safety, Qian Shuiting originally wanted to mobilize a Special Recon detachment to accompany the fleet, but currently several detachments were deployed abroad, and manpower was very tight. Finally, after coordination, Bei Wei agreed to dispatch a small team of ten members to accompany the ships—acting as snipers and M240 machine gunners. If necessary, they would directly participate in the boarding assault carrying submachine guns and shotguns.

Someone simply suggested bringing anti-tank missiles, but everyone felt the thing might have too much killing power. If one shot sank the ship before the silver was in hand, it would be a loss.

Demonstration confrontation drills were conducted several times on the galleon model. The result was that regardless of the assault plan adopted, there were basically no casualties during boarding. The combined use of M240s and typewriters was enough to sweep the entire deck. But once entering the battle on the middle and lower decks, it would inevitably cause certain casualties—even with clear knowledge of the cabin structure, as long as the opposing side had sufficient fighting will, they could cause losses to assaulting marines with matchlocks and swords. And precedents of turning small cannons on the gun deck to fire longitudinally to crush rushing enemies were not non-existent.

The marines' main equipment, Minié rifles, had greatly reduced combat efficiency once inside narrow and poorly lit middle and lower decks. Smoke was excessive when firing, and reaction speed wasn't fast enough in close quarters. Obviously, the submachine guns and shotguns used by Special Recon were the ideal boarding tools.

But these weapons were extremely scarce, so Qian Shuiting turned his idea to poison gas. Currently, Lingao could only manufacture two types of gas: chili tear gas grenades widely equipped by security forces, and chlorine gas. Chlorine was an important product in Lingao's chemical industry and a widely used raw material in industrial production; both production volume and storage had certain application conditions. Qian Shuiting planned to control the upper deck, then inject chlorine gas from personnel entrances. Chlorine is very heavy and flows downward. Although galleons had lower gun ports and stern windows, and lower decks were flush with relatively good air circulation preventing chlorine from achieving optimal effect, even a small amount of chlorine was enough to incapacitate people.

"Clean and labor-saving, hmm, and environmentally friendly, incidentally disinfecting the ship," Qian Shuiting advocated tirelessly. "And protection is simple—just masks soaked in alkaline solution. No need for gas masks."

"But goggles are also needed; chlorine is irritating to eyes. The usage safety of this thing isn't great," Shi Zhiqi wasn't very interested in using chlorine—he felt using chlorine was a typical abuse of technical means. Besides, he wasn't very assured about stuffing an overdue high-pressure cylinder full of chlorine on a ship to drift across the ocean.

"We can try the actual effect—we have a full-scale model now. Put some rabbits and goats in and release a tank of chlorine down..."

"The Elders would raise hell. Aren't you wasting meat?" Shi Zhiqi shook his head repeatedly. "I think Marine assault is better!" He punched the air fiercely. "If Minié rifles work poorly, bring two revolvers and a machete per person for close combat."

In the end, no one convinced anyone, but the Planning Commission readily agreed to allocate a chlorine cylinder and relevant protective equipment. It was said someone in the military had strong interest in using chlorine and thus specially did work in the Executive Committee and Planning Commission. Additionally, the Ministry of Health was interested in chlorine's disinfection effect on ships.
