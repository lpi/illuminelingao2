# Chapter 889 - Joint Operations Command

Schneider walked under the scorching spring sun, sweating profusely as he carried his own luggage. As a Navy Lieutenant who came from a background emphasizing dress, etiquette, and demeanor, his image of personally moving luggage stood out on the road: the Navy had a specific set of regulations regarding the use of orderlies.

Navy Lieutenant Schneider was formerly Shi Shisi. Because a certain elder in naval circles felt the name Shi Shisi was too inauspicious and too bland—there were simply too many naturalized citizens named "So-and-so Fourteen" or "So-and-so something-something." So he was given this new name. Schneider was very satisfied with the new name; it was much better than the original "Fourteen," and he had secretly begged the scribe in East Gate Market to start writing a genealogy for him.

Writing a genealogy was actually fabricating a genealogy. Schneider came from a humble background, knowing only that his ancestors were all fishing folk. To make the genealogy look good, he had to attach himself to famous figures. This required finding a learned "gentleman."

The first batch of elites among naturalized citizens had been born; they had either taken up military/administrative positions or struck it rich. After turning their fortunes around, they inevitably couldn't avoid the vulgar desire to compile a family tree to bring glory to their ancestors.

Knowing the "Chiefs" greatly detested ancestral halls, they dared not entertain thoughts of building ancestral shrines—moreover, most were outsiders who had recently arrived in Lingao alone, with no way to build any shrine locally. But fabricating a genealogy with prominent ancestors brought great psychological satisfaction. Several ghostwriters in East Gate Market had made a small fortune from this.

Compared to other seasons, Schneider liked Lingao's winter more. In winter temperatures were low, and he could wear the smart, well-fitting Navy winter uniform. This made him feel like a high-class person: the winter uniform was made of thin woolen cloth bought from Westerners. The uniform had not a single wrinkle. The Navy Distinguished Service Medal hung polished and gleaming on his chest, earned for counter-espionage and combat performance in the Pearl River Estuary Campaign. The Navy intended to draw a clear line with the Army rustics regarding medal rewards, resolutely avoiding things like "Class X Merits" and pursuing ornate and professional medal names. Now whenever Schneider went out, he invariably wore his full Navy officer uniform and full set of medals. The various admiring and awed gazes on the road filled his heart with pleasure.

As part of the reward, and as preparation for the military struggle preceding the upcoming "Operation Engine," Schneider was recommended to attend the naval officer promotion training held at Bopu.

Compared to the painful Naval Engineering and Tactical Command courses, Schneider preferred Seamanship and Leadership courses. He was skilled in the former, while the latter made him feel like an officer. Compared to being beaten senseless in map exercises, Lieutenant Schneider thoroughly taught the greenhorns what a veteran was in live drills. Though those little rascals learned much fast after suffering a few losses.

After the three-month fully closed intensive training ended, he was promoted to Navy Lieutenant. Two days after returning home, a paper order summoned him to Ma'niao Fort for short-term training—what the Chiefs called on-the-job training.

The notice didn't list any specific subject names. Schneider knew it was for "secrecy," but he was clear that this temporary training was nine out of ten linked to the recent active war preparations.

The Fubo Army was preparing for war—though this preparation wasn't as massive as before the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign. Schneider understood this every time he took sailors to the shipyard for "support labor": he had never seen so many large ships starting construction simultaneously. Some new ships, though not comparable to the Holy Ship in volume, exceeded the largest Western galleons he had ever seen. Various ship materials piled up like mountains in factories; workers were busy non-stop, working day and night.

Sailors had been drilling since the New Year. In the squadron he commanded, sailors on every special service boat were reduced by half, vacancies filled by recruits fresh from the recruit camp. Clearly, the transferred sailors were personnel preparations for the new ships.

In the recruit camp, Schneider discovered some old partners he knew from his pirate days; they had all been gathered during the recent recruitment expansion. There were men from Zhu Kailao's subordinates, and subordinates of other defeated sea lords. Many had fled back to their hometowns after the "Great Gang" collapsed, but had no means of livelihood. Recruitment officers, based on data from interrograting captives and conversations, led by former pirate chiefs who had defected to naturalization, recruited these scattered soldiers and stragglers extensively along the Guangdong and Guangxi coasts.

Clearly, if not to expand the Navy, the Chiefs wouldn't recruit so many people at once.

It seems we're going to fight again, Schneider thought.

When he arrived at Ma'niao Fort pier by Navy transport boat, the place was completely renewed. The Ma'niao Peninsula was now the Elder Council's core heavy industry base, and the original Ma'niao Army Base was formally upgraded to "Ma'niao Fort."

According to the new military system, army base locations were all suffixed with "Fort." This new regulation was considered the formal infiltration of "American School" bad taste into the Army/Navy system following the "German School," "Soviet School," and "Japanese School."

The gun tower that once served as He Ming's Field Army Headquarters had disappeared, replaced by huge bamboo fences and enormous buildings scattered within. Ma'niao Fort occupied a vast area; inside and outside the walls were distributed several barracks and various Army technical training grounds. The road network was preliminarily complete. Army soldiers conducting drill and tactical training could be seen everywhere.

The entire Ma'niao Fort was a military restricted zone. Schneider's orderly was blocked at the first sentry post—the reporting certificate didn't have the orderly's name. So Lieutenant Schneider could only carry his luggage and continue forward alone. Arriving at the main gate, two large wooden signs with black characters on white background hung there: Ma'niao Fort Army Base, Joint Operations Command.

The Joint Operations Command was a recently established command organ replacing the duties of the original temporary Field Army General Headquarters. Currently, the Field Army was in a long-term state of security warfare and garrison duty; there couldn't be no organ coordinating and commanding the Navy, Army, and all other armed forces.

Actually, similar needs had been preliminarily proposed during the Southern Qiongzhou security war. If in Northern Qiongzhou the Navy's main task was transporting Army and supplies, in Southern Qiongzhou, Navy operations were no longer as simple as transporting the Army ashore. They often needed to join combat personally—villages in Southern Qiongzhou counties were almost all spread along the coast, and bandit/warlord forces often used boats for maneuver.

Considering the characteristics of the upcoming "Operation Engine" requiring joint Army-Navy action—the General Staff concluded from several strategic exercises that for a considerable phase, Fubo Army military operations would be joint Army-Navy operations along the coastline—establishing a cross-service Joint Operations Command became very necessary.

The newly established Joint Operations Command was located in Ma'niao Fort. It was under the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Directorate, composed jointly of personnel dispatched by the Army General Staff and Navy Admiralty, and operationally commanded by the General Staff.

Schneider followed signs along the newly paved road to the compound housing the Joint Operations Command.

Several Army clerks and officers stood at the command entrance responsible for reception. Yang Zeng was among them. Due to excellent performance in the Chengmai Campaign, Yang Zeng was also recommended to attend the officer promotion training course at Ma'niao Fort. He also recommended his orderly Wei Darong to attend NCO training.

After experiencing closed training, Yang Zeng felt the Chiefs' lives were too busy—not a single elder officer had leisure time. whenever Yang Zeng saw them, they were either on the training ground, in classrooms, or holding endless meetings.

Of course he was busy too. As a naturalized officer about to be promoted to vice battalion commander, Yang Zeng had too many subjects to catch up on. He not only had to cram cultural courses but also master higher-level, more complex combat subject training and logistical organization support.

He occasionally missed the leisurely days of hugging a matchlock musket and sunbathing uselessly at the Gou Family Village. Seeing Schneider walking toward him in that crisp Navy dress uniform and eye-catching Navy Distinguished Service Medal, Yang Zeng unconsciously straightened his back, wearing his Class II Military Merit Medal and Special Grade Marksman Skill Badge on his chest.

Schneider was in the latest arriving batch; the entire Ma'niao Fort guesthouse was full. Yang Zeng had to arrange for Schneider and others to stay temporarily in vacated barracks.

Nearly one hundred Army and Navy officers were summoned to Ma'niao Fort simultaneously. They were all naturalized officers circled by the General Staff Cadre Department to participate in "Operation Engine."

The environment facing "Operation Engine" was extremely complex. At sea, they had to pass through territory of Liu Xiang and Zheng Zhilong. The Dutch and Spanish also possessed power in the Taiwan Strait, a necessary route. Except for the Dutch who had just signed a trade agreement, all other forces were "unfriendly."

On land, despite Zhao Yingong paving the way and building relationships, predicting what problems would arise when transporting massive numbers of refugees right under the Ming Dynasty's nose was impossible. Especially when involved in the Dengzhou Rebellion, collecting and transporting refugees on a chaotic battlefield.

In this environment, action was impossible without sufficient military protection. In the process of organizing marching and camping for masses of refugees, a well-trained army could play a huge role—without trained soldiers responsible for organizing and leading, tens of thousands of refugees probably couldn't form orderly columns to move. when the plan for "Operation Engine" began formulation, the Planning Commission had secretly consulted the Army and Navy People's Commissars regarding the number of ships and troops mobilizeable at that time.
