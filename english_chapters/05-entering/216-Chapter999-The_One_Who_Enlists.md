# Chapter 999 The One Who Enlists

But just serving as a "translator" role, Mu Min truly felt Bi Da's talents were being wasted. Although she hadn't had much contact with Bi Da, the girl was clever without guile, forthright in character, and decisive in handling matters. In several contacts with the Li people, she had demonstrated her negotiation abilities. With proper cultivation, she would make a good cadre in the future. Although the directives from the Senate and Executive Committee to the Li-Miao Affairs Office were very clear that the Senate's ethnic policy was "no ethnic policy"—only the distinction between naturalized citizens and natives—and they wouldn't specially cultivate "ethnic cadres" or implement special policies like "ethnic classes."

"Whether a native can become a qualified naturalized citizen under the Senate system depends first on whether his loyalty to our system surpasses his own ethnic and religious sentiments!" the Senate's propaganda theorist Ding Ding had said in an internal speech. "Those who cannot meet this standard cannot become naturalized citizens!"

That was what was said, but locally speaking, to penetrate deep into Hainan Island's interior to handle Li-Miao affairs without naturalized citizens familiar with local conditions as guides was practically fantasy. So Mu Min still managed to cultivate several naturalized citizen cadres of Li-Miao origin in Lingao, Changhua, and Sanya. Of course, the specific work was still done by Fang Jinghan—he was now responsible for the office's routine work.

Mu Min was considering how to have another talk with her tonight, encouraging her learning and work enthusiasm, getting her to agree to follow her back to Lingao to participate in National School training. She planned to train a batch of Li-Miao naturalized citizen cadres, but Bi Da was unwilling to go to Lingao to study—she felt living this kind of free and easy life in Changhua was fine and was unwilling to go to Lingao to be "constrained" by "going to school." Suddenly there was a commotion outside the training camp gate. She couldn't help feeling strange: although this wasn't Changhua Fort, it was less than one kilometer from Changhua Fort, also a Senate military control zone, not a marketplace anyone could freely enter and exit. Ordinarily, whether Han, Li, or Miao, everyone kept their distance from this heavily guarded place with people standing watch day and night, let alone proactively coming to make a fuss.

While puzzled, a soldier had already run back and said a few words to Bi Da—apparently the visitors were Li people, needing her to translate. Unexpectedly, after a few words, Bi Da's expression actually changed and she turned and ran.

Mu Min was greatly puzzled and had to go over personally to see.

Arriving at the camp gate, she saw five or six young Li people making a commotion at the entrance. The leader was a young man who looked healthy and sturdy, still wearing pheasant feathers on his head, dressed quite elaborately—obviously a prominent figure in his village. Mu Min thought he looked somewhat familiar. At the moment, he was talking with someone at the gate. Mu Min recognized this person—it was Li Benqing, Wang Daliang's uncle.

In the past two years, Li Benqing had been serving as guide and translator for the Cooperative's trading caravans, no longer living by hunting, and had received quite a few benefits. With some money on hand, he formally married the woman he was seeing in the "lounge." Although he continued living in Qiandui Village, he came to Changhua Fort several times each month to report on work, counting as half a naturalized citizen.

Seeing the "chief" had come, Li Benqing hurried over to report: these five or six Li people had come to enlist—but recruitment had already ended. The other party refused to leave, insisting on enlisting, and demanded he call out the person in charge.

Mu Min didn't mind: "If they want to enlist, just let them in to register. What's the big deal about a few more people?"

Li Benqing said quietly: "If it were anyone else, fine. But this is Zhen Huan!"

Before Mu Min could figure out who Zhen Huan was, Li Benqing had already elaborated: "The son of Zhen Aoya of Qiandui Village!"

Mu Min suddenly understood: "Bi Da's sweetheart?" All at once, memories from back then flooded up: This Zhen Huan could be considered devoted and righteous. When they took Bi Da away, he had even intercepted them midway. The feelings between the two were also entangled with the power struggle between the Wang and Zhen families within Qiandui Village—the complications were intricate. Mu Min had taken Bi Da away back then partly out of sympathy for this innocent victim of the power struggle, and also because she was unwilling to let the friendly Qiandui Village fall into chaos from internal strife.

"That's right!" Li Benqing nodded repeatedly. "Ever since Bi Da returned from Lingao, he's come to Changhua Fort several times to find Bi Da. Bi Da refuses to see him. Each time there's a scene like this."

This time he heard that the "Australians" who took Bi Da away were recruiting soldiers, so he simply brought a few brothers and buddies along to enlist. In his conception, since Bi Da was with the Australians, as long as he became an Australian soldier, he could see her all the time.

"He's quite the romantic." Mu Min sighed enviously. "Truly romantic."

While they were talking, Zhen Huan had already run over. His movements were very agile; in a few moves he dodged soldiers trying to intercept him, charging straight to not far from Mu Min. Several guards accompanying Mu Min immediately raised bayoneted rifles, forcibly stopping him.

Zhen Huan was quite agitated, but he was rather wary of these soldiers holding muskets mounted with gleaming short blades. He just jabbered something, not making any more violent moves.

Li Benqing hurried out to translate. Mu Min listened to Zhen Huan's request: still the matter of recruiting him to enlist.

Mu Min nodded: "You want to be our soldier—that's good. But why do you want to be a soldier?"

Zhen Huan was momentarily stunned. He was a privileged class in the village, never wanting for food or clothing. His own hunting skills were also very strong. There was originally no need for him to go out to be a soldier eating military rations; he had thought of enlisting entirely to be able to meet Bi Da.

After hesitating a moment, he said loudly: "You took Bi Da away! I want to be with her; the only way is to be your soldier!"

Mu Min said: "I know you want to meet Bi Da. But being a soldier doesn't necessarily mean you can see Bi Da. She is she; you are you. She is now a cadre of the Senate. If you become a soldier of the Senate in the future, you must obey the Senate's command in everything. You can't even decide where to go yourself—how can you still see her?"

Zhen Huan said without hesitation: "Since she's with you, someday we will meet."

Mu Min nodded: "Then let me tell you: once you enlist, in just a few days you'll be sent to a foreign place to fight. Maybe for a few months, maybe for a few years. You might die on the battlefield before having a chance to see her. Besides, even if you can see her once, that may not change anything. Do you still want to enlist?"

But Zhen Huan was unmoved, firmly demanding to enlist. Mu Min nodded: "Alright, just take him then. Since he volunteers."

Li Benqing smiled helplessly and led him away. The several companions and friends beside Zhen Huan also enlisted together.

Fang Jinghan was somewhat uneasy—he said quietly: "He's coming specifically for Bi Da. Bi Da is the training translator. When they meet on the training ground, who knows what new drama might unfold!"

Mu Min smiled: "No problem. She's not the only Li cadre who speaks Chinese. Besides, this way Bi Da will be begging to follow us back to Lingao to study."

"Director, you truly have foresight." Fang Jinghan didn't miss the opportunity to flatter her, then sighed. "Little Zhen is so pitiful—such a devoted man. That woman Bi Da is truly hateful!"

Mu Min shook her head, smiled, and didn't continue.

Under soldiers' escort, they strolled along the simple road—the seaside of Changhua Fort had many sand dunes visible, covered with shrubs and pasture grass. This was the result of human intervention.

The Changhua seaside, due to early human development, had very severely damaged vegetation. Combined with special geographical and natural environment, this caused continuous inland invasion of coastal sand dunes, resulting in a large area of desert grassland terrain. In the 20th century, such coastal desert invasion even reached more than a dozen kilometers inland.

Because rainfall here was still adequate, plus the nourishment of the Changhua River, hardy low shrubs and wild vegetables could still survive. After Kong Lingyang took up his post, he used his agricultural knowledge to plant large-scale legume pasture grasses tolerant of poor soil on the local pastures for animal husbandry use. This also served to stabilize and improve the soil.

On the summer pastures, vegetation was lush, emitting the fragrance of green grass. By the Changhua River, scattered flocks of sheep and herds of cattle grazed. Besides Changhua sheep and Li area yellow cattle and water buffalo, there were also quality cattle and sheep collected from Hainan Island and Guangdong, plus some old-dimension quality breeds bred using frozen semen with local mother stock. All were now pastured here to expand the populations. Although Lingao had abundant arable land, industrial and agricultural production took up large areas, making land resources far tighter than Changhua. So now the South Sea Farm mainly conducted breeding animal husbandry and small-scale dairy farming. Meat, hide, and wool livestock husbandry had all been transferred to Changhua.

By the river, many cattle were drinking water. Summertime Changhua River was in its high-water season, with large flow. River water rose, and the riverbanks were everywhere dotted with large and small pools, growing dense reeds and other aquatic plants—very different from when they first came here.

Mu Min noticed there were now some irrigation channels and water-lifting waterwheels here. Kong Lingyang, using local labor and materials supplemented by a small number of specialized workers dispatched from Lingao, had built a simple irrigation system for the pastures, making the artificial pasture grass grow even better—to have natural grasslands support large numbers of livestock, relying solely on natural pasture grass and natural irrigation was far from sufficient.

On the mudflats of the Changhua River, survey team personnel from Lingao were conducting surveying. One of them Mu Min recognized—it was Yan Quezhi. He originally worked at the Wenlan River hydrological station in Lingao; this time he accompanied the survey team to Changhua, probably to investigate water resources here.
