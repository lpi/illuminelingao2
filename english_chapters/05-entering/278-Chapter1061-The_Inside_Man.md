# Chapter 1061 - The Inside Man

To avoid trouble, Huang Ande had been hiding in Sun Yuan's house within the barracks of the naval citadel. Though called barracks, the place was more like a small town. Inside lived soldiers and their families. People came and went daily, and there were even some residents who were neither soldiers nor family members. In recent days, the government offices had conducted household registration sweeps, strictly checking for suspicious outsiders. Quite a few had been arrested—word had it that several had been beheaded. Sun Yuan, being one of the Governor's household retainers, was spared such harassment. Huang Ande knew that while the Chiefs were strict, they did not kill wantonly; they were always cautious. Despite their fierce slogans, they never executed people casually. But Ming officials, for all their talk of benevolence and righteousness, killed with abandon—especially in tense times like these. One could be walking down the street, and a wrong look or gesture could get you dragged off and beheaded on the spot.

Huang Ande was taking a great risk by remaining in the naval citadel. By tomorrow night, the citadel would fall, and amid the chaos, no one knew what might happen. History recorded only the fates of the great figures; the Grand Library had found little about what befell ordinary civilians, craftsmen, and soldiers after a city fell.

Huang Ande's situation was precarious. Both he and Sun Yuan were Dengzhou-native soldiers, and there had always been bad blood between them and the Liaodong rebels. Even if Kong Youde and Li Jiucheng intended to win hearts, their men might well kill for vengeance.

Though Kong Youde regarded Sun Yuanhua especially highly—not only sparing his life but even intending to proclaim him king—this did not mean he would extend the same mercy to someone like Sun Yuan.

Huang Ande did not know the naval citadel would fall tomorrow. But before Dengzhou was besieged, he had been redeployed into the city, and before that, a Chief had personally summoned him and given him detailed instructions.

Deer Wenyuan had told him plainly: "Dengzhou cannot be held, and neither can the naval citadel."

Huang Ande's mission was simple: find a way to remain hidden within the citadel, use the contacts he had previously cultivated, and constantly monitor Sun Yuanhua's movements—especially after the city fell. If possible, he should stay as close to Sun Yuanhua as he could.

"The mission is extremely dangerous—first and foremost, you must survive inside the city," Chief Deer had said. "Are you confident?"

"Yes!" Huang Ande had answered without hesitation.

From the very first day he had changed his appearance and been sent to Dengzhou to "develop connections," he knew he was going to be a spy.

Being a spy meant risking his life. He was mentally prepared for this.

Huang Ande was not an especially politically conscious person, but Lingao had given him unprecedented opportunities for personal advancement. Besides, he believed in the old saying: "Fortune favors the bold."

Climbing the ranks through routine fighting and unit expansion was painfully slow. To become a lieutenant or captain quickly and move into one of those fine houses for senior officers back at base, Huang Ande was willing to take this risk.

As for why the Chiefs wanted him to watch Sun Yuanhua—though Chief Deer had not explained—there was no doubt they wanted to save the Governor.

The only reason Huang Ande could think of for saving Sun Yuanhua was that Chief Deer and the Governor shared the same faith. Though he found this rather far-fetched, his time in the Bravery Wave Army had taught him never to ask questions he was not supposed to ask.

The only concern he voiced was: what if Sun Yuanhua committed suicide?

Huang Ande had served in the Ming army and knew that when a city fell, a high official of Sun Yuanhua's rank would either die fighting or take his own life. There was no way he would allow himself to be captured by rebels—otherwise the court would never forgive him, and his reputation would be ruined.

"Don't worry. Governor Sun will definitely not commit suicide," Deer Wenyuan had said.

As for why not, Chief Deer did not say, and Huang Ande did not ask. Besides the principle of not asking what he was not supposed to ask, he had grown accustomed to the Chiefs' "prophetic powers." Their predictions were invariably accurate—the more significant the national affairs, the more precise.

Outside, the night watch had begun. All was deathly still. Huang Ande heard movement in the courtyard. He flipped off the *kang* platform, gripped his revolver, and cocked the hammer.

Then he heard three stones drop successively in the courtyard. He quickly lowered the hammer—it was one of his own men.

Since first arriving in Dengzhou, Huang Ande had cultivated over twenty "contacts" within the naval citadel through "reminiscing about old times," "sworn brotherhood ceremonies," and "looking up relatives."

Some of these contacts were only useful for gathering information and were not particularly reliable. Others were childhood friends—former accomplices from his days stealing from government granaries, a capital offense.

Following the methods the Chiefs had taught him in their classes, Huang Ande selected twelve of the most reliable and bold among them. Through timely small favors and gradual ideological cultivation, he had gradually formed a small clique around himself. Sun Yuan was one of them.

This clique had no political ideology, but they shared common traits: they were at odds with the Liaodong people in Dengzhou; they held no affection for the Great Ming; their families were in difficult financial circumstances, with urgent desires to change their lot. And finally, they were fiercely loyal.

After Dengzhou came under siege, Huang Ande had quietly sounded them out at private gatherings to see if they would be willing to act when the time came. All twelve had declared that whatever "Big Brother Huang" or "Brother Huang" wanted to do, as long as it was not for the "Liaodong people" or the "Tartars," they would follow him through fire and water without hesitation.

Tonight, he had instructed a younger brother at Sun Yuan's house to go around and summon them all for a meeting.

He quickly opened the door and stepped out. Seven or eight men were already standing in the courtyard. In the dim night, he could see they were all people he had personally recruited.

They had not come through the main gate but had climbed over the wall from the back alley. Anyone caught wandering the streets tonight would be "executed on the spot" without question.

"Inside to talk!" he whispered.

The men silently filed into the room. After confirming everyone was inside, Huang Ande turned back and instructed Sun Yuan's brother to keep watch quietly in the courtyard.

Inside, he counted seven men. Besides Sun Yuan, who was on duty at the Governor's office, four others had not come.

"Old Sticky Lü chickened out—says he's got the runs and can't make it," said Zhu Si—the younger brother of Zhu San, his old accomplice in the granary theft. After Zhu San had taken the fall and been beheaded, Zhu Si had managed to join the military with help from their comrades. He bore deep resentment toward both the army and the Great Ming.

After Huang Ande had reconnected with Sun Yuan, he had made a special point of visiting the Zhu household, even weeping at Zhu San's grave and giving the family a generous sum of silver. He and Zhu Si had sworn brotherhood, promising to look after him. After all these gestures, he had successfully won Zhu Si over.

Besides the cowardly Old Sticky Lü, Huang Yang had also begged off. The other two were on duty and could not come.

"No matter." Huang Ande did not light a lamp—talking in the dark was fine, and in an entirely darkened encampment, a single light would be conspicuous.

"I've troubled you all to come," Huang Ande said without excessive pleasantries. "As you know, Kong Youde and Li Jiucheng are outside the walls. Today, Regional Commander Zhang suffered another major defeat—less than three in ten of his Southern troops survived. The city is full of Liaodong people. Even the Governor's personal guard is manned by Liaodong men—they all served together under Commander Mao as adopted sons. Their bond is extraordinary. Who knows when they might open the gates to the enemy? I'd say this Dengzhou city and Penglai citadel won't last much longer."

This was no alarmist talk. The Liaodong people inside the city had been restless since the eleventh month; only through both threats and inducements had the government maintained a semblance of order. Though Sun Yuanhua had worked hard to display trust in the Liaodong commanders to maintain their loyalty, others were not so confident.

"The city will fall within days," said a soldier named Cao Qing. "The Liaodong people are practically saying openly that they'll answer Kong Youde's call. A few days ago, Governor Sun even ordered gunners pulled from the navy to man the cannon emplacements on the citadel walls—supposedly to guard against people from the Eastern River responding to Kong Youde."

Though order had been restored on the various Eastern River islands, Regional Commander Huang Long clearly had little control over the Eastern River troops. Moreover, his embezzlement of military pay and his practice of forcing soldiers to dig ginseng in the mountains had earned him their bitter hatred. Even common soldiers could see that the Eastern River veterans were quite likely to mutiny in support of Kong Youde.

Everyone was worried that once the city fell, the rebels might kill and burn throughout the city and citadel in revenge against the old Shandong soldiers.

"I don't think there'll be wholesale killing and burning—after all, this is their home base too. If they really let loose with slaughter, a lot of their own people would die."

Once an army began looting and killing, it became completely uncontrollable—a bloody carnival of murder. The rebels would not distinguish between Liaodong people, Southerners, or Shandong natives. If Kong Youde and Li Jiucheng did not want to lose popular support, they would not allow such a thing.

Zhu Si said: "As long as we don't have scores to settle with the Liaodong people, we just need to hide out for the first three days after the city falls. After that, we should be fine. But then we'll have to join the rebellion."

The rebels would inevitably force the soldiers and civilians inside the city to "turn bandit." When that time came, there would be no other choice.

The word "rebellion" silenced the men in the room.

"If we're going to rebel, so be it," Cao Qing said quietly. "But this kind of rebellion is pointless! The Liaodong people call all the shots. We'd just be used as cannon fodder."

"No—we don't need to rebel." Huang Ande lowered his voice. He noticed in the darkness that every eye was turned toward him.

"Brothers, as the saying goes: 'Fortune favors the bold.' The rebels breaking through is dangerous, yes, but we can't just hide and let ourselves be pushed around afterward. A great fortune awaits us all—if you're willing to seize it."
