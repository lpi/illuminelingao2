# Chapter 932 – From Tayouan to Dagou

It was said that to protect their villages from foreign invasions and internal strife, the local indigenous people planted large amounts of thorny bamboo near their settlements. The local word for thorny bamboo sounded like "Dagou" (beat dog). Kaohsiung's old name, "Dagou," or sometimes "Dagu" (beat drum), came from this local term.

As for the name Kaohsiung (Takao), it was created by the Japanese during the occupation period based on the Japanese pronunciation of "Dagou." It was much more elegant in both sound and meaning, so it became the official name. Just as Keelung replaced Jilong (Chicken Coop), Kaohsiung replaced Dagou.

Ren Fu had been to Tayouan (modern-day Anping, Tainan) but had never been to Kaohsiung. However, he knew that "Dagou" wasn't too far from Tayouan. So he took the safest route: first to the waters off Tayouan, then south along the coastline to Kaohsiung.

With the Navy's navigation capabilities, sailing directly from Nan'ao Island to Kaohsiung presented no difficulty; there was no need for this circuitous coastal route. But Li Ziping very much wanted to see the Dutch defensive posture at Tayouan.

He had already obtained sketches of Dutch defensive facilities at Tayouan and rough troop estimates from the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. At this time, Tayouan Harbor didn't yet have the comprehensive defense system it would when Koxinga recovered Taiwan; at best, it was a fortified armed trading post. The total permanent Dutch personnel at Tayouan wouldn't exceed three hundred.

Facts proved the Intelligence Bureau's estimate accurate. When the *Haitian* passed Tayouan Harbor, the Dutch castle was nowhere to be seen; only a few larger buildings were scattered by the bay. Only three European-style ships were anchored in the bay, ranging from small boats of a few dozen tons to vessels of one or two hundred tons. Considering that when Koxinga attacked here in the old timeline, the Dutch also only had three ships to meet him, this was evidently their standing naval force in Taiwan.

Before 1633, Dutch power in Taiwan was quite weak. They had no deterrent power beyond 30 kilometers from the fort. The locals didn't buy what the Dutch were selling. In 1630, the East India Company's trading post in Taiwan even considered abandoning the place due to insufficient trade and constant harassment by natives.

Fort Zeelandia, which Koxinga spent over half a year gnawing at, wouldn't be completed until 1633. By East Asian standards of the time, it was a very strong castle, costing the East India Company a huge sum. In fact, Fort Zeelandia's defense system proved quite effective. Through his high-powered telescope, Li Ziping saw that large-scale construction seemed to be underway near the Dutch trading post, with many workers and piles of building materials. Records indicated that between 1631 and 1632, the East India Company carried out major expansion here.

If they wanted to conquer Tayouan, 1631 was the perfect time. Quite a few people advocated tearing up the trade agreement immediately after the typhoon season ended at the end of 1631 and seizing Tayouan in one stroke. But compared to the profits brought by trade with the Dutch, a mere Tayouan wasn't on the Executive Committee's mind. Tayouan Harbor's status was at best another Macao—or even far inferior. With the Fubo Army's current siege firepower, they could occupy it whenever they wanted. The Dutch and their servants and mercenaries were a group of "lonely outsiders" in Taiwan, surrounded by natives with ill intent and mainland immigrants who were completely unreliable. The transmigrators could easily uproot them—just as Koxinga had done in Taiwan.

The Dutch were also unable to station large ships here: the entrance to Tayouan Harbor was relatively shallow. Only ships with a draft of less than three meters could enter and exit freely; ships with drafts between three and five meters could only enter at high tide; ships with drafts over five meters could only anchor outside the harbor and use barges for loading and unloading. This made nearly all ships over 200 tons unable to anchor inside Tayouan Harbor. The ships the Dutch sent to Taiwan were generally smaller, largely due to restrictions of the local port.

Overall, Tayouan wasn't a suitable trade port. In fact, almost no place on the entire island of Taiwan could be called a true natural deep-water port; whether Kaohsiung or Keelung, both were the result of massive artificial modification.

When the *Haitian* approached Tayouan, a puff of white smoke suddenly appeared over the Dutch trading post, followed by the distant sound of a cannon. Whether this was a warning or an inquiry, Li Ziping had no way of knowing, but through his telescope he had roughly confirmed the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's data. The Dutch at Tayouan would definitely not be a potential stumbling block to Operation Engine—their strength was simply too small. A single Type 901 gunboat would be enough to sweep away the East India Company's naval forces at Tayouan.

Leaving Tayouan and sailing along the coast, in less than a few hours the *Haitian* arrived off Kaohsiung. Here were large coastal lagoons, which by the 21st century would almost completely disappear, either silted up into land or transformed into harbors. In the 21st century timeline, Kaohsiung was Taiwan's second most densely populated area; even rural areas generally presented an urbanized appearance. But here and now, the coast was exceptionally desolate, almost completely devoid of human habitation. Compared to the coastline near Tayouan, at least there one could see scattered native villages and Fujian immigrant settlements.

Desolation had its benefits; at least they wouldn't need to use tactics to seize land. Li Ziping had grown up under the red flag; as a child he saw ferocious criticism of colonialists everywhere; as an adult his ears and eyes were filled with universal values targeting the various trickery and force used against natives—"indigenous people," to use the politically correct term—to strip them of land and resources. He felt a bit of guilt and couldn't quite let go.

The *Haitian* sailed slowly under Ren Fu's pilotage. Li Ziping then identified Zuoying based on charts and coordinates. This naval base of Taiwan in the old timeline was currently just a lagoon port called "Wandan." Fujian coastal fishermen sometimes sheltered their boats here from the wind. Aside from that, never mind large ships, even the *Haitian* had to wait for high tide to enter.

"Dagou Mountain!" Ren Fu shouted. Li Ziping immediately looked toward the shore, and sure enough, a small hill stood on the coastline not far away. The hill was unremarkable, covered in lush subtropical vegetation.

"Measure altitude," Li Ziping called out. The naval cadets and survey team members interning on deck immediately observed and calculated Dagou Mountain, concluding an altitude of 330.04 meters.

With Dagou Mountain in sight, Dagou Harbor was right before them. Dagou Harbor was a lagoon port. The long lagoon was separated from the open sea by a natural sandbar nearly 10 kilometers long; the lagoon was almost 1.5 kilometers wide. Among the coastal harbors, this place offered the best anchoring conditions, and fishermen frequently moored boats here.

However, for large sea-going vessels, Dagou Harbor's anchoring conditions weren't very good. Because the lagoon was very shallow, large ships could only anchor in the outer part of the harbor, where the anchorage area was very small. In the old timeline, the Dutch had built a port here too, but rarely used it.

Entering Dagou Harbor was a dangerous affair, especially for large sailing ships without engine power, relying on sails, currents, and rudders to maintain direction. It had only one narrow entrance flanked by rocky reefs; the harbor mouth was only 60 meters wide. Although the *Haitian* had a propeller, Li Ziping was uneasy about underwater conditions, and Ren Fu also advised caution—there was a shifting sandbar underwater at Dagou Harbor; grazing it and running aground would be trouble. The tide here only ran once a day, with a tidal range of less than a meter. Stranded ships would be hard to free.

Finally, they adopted the safest method: the *Haitian* lowered a rowboat to sound depths while leading the *Haitian* into Dagou Harbor, selecting a spot with suitable depth to drop anchor.

Li Ziping calculated and checked the charts, finally concluding their current anchorage was likely the Xiaogang District of Kaohsiung. This place was formerly named "Gangzaiqian"; the port the Dutch established in Kaohsiung was right here. But at this moment, the Dutch themselves were being run ragged by the four big tribes near Fort Zeelandia and had no strength to come build a port here.

Qian Shuixie and his detachment once again served as the landing vanguard. Ren Fu warned him to be careful. The natives here were hard to get along with. Fujian fishermen and coastal pirates who came here for shelter or to fetch water and firewood sometimes conflicted with them, often suffering casualties.

In the past, several of Zhu Cailao's ships had come to Dagou for fresh water and conflict erupted with the local "Dagou Savages," resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries. They had practically fled in panic.

The so-called "Dagou Savages" active near Dagou Harbor are generally considered by moderns to be a branch of the local Pingpu people.

"I hear that bunch of natives is powerful and good at fighting. They love chopping off heads to hang in their village as war trophies," Ren Fu said. "Chiefs, please be careful."

Qian Shuixie nodded. "No problem, we'll be very careful."

He immediately directed the soldiers to board the rowboats, bringing along two dogs in addition to weapons—descendants of the six breeding dogs Yang Baogui had brought. Under Yang Baogui's training, they had become well-disciplined working dogs, very useful as point men and sentries.

Li Ziping said: "If you encounter natives, try to communicate peacefully. Avoid armed conflict."

Qian Shuixie disagreed inwardly but outwardly expressed assent.

"Don't worry, we're not European colonialists who kill and burn. We believe in harmonious coexistence and joint development..."

Liu Zheng laughed. "Joint development my ass. Just grab it directly, no? What harmony is there to talk about with these barbarians from the south islands!" He made a "beheading" gesture. "Those unwilling get *ka-cha*."

Qian Shuixie shook his head. "There is only one mode of joint development: we're the bosses, they're the laborers—that's joint development."

Several people laughed together, leaving Ren Fu bewildered. He could only force a few chuckles along with them.
