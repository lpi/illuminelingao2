# Chapter 882 - Provocation

Huang Zhen lay bored on his back in bed, staring dead at a long-legged spider in the corner of the bed curtains, weaving a half-finished web. Shunhe Old Inn was a reasonably respectable establishment; every day the innkeeper sent a young servant in to tidy the room, and this spider's web had been torn down several times. Yet this did not hinder the spider from stubbornly acting as a squatter in this spot it considered prime real estate.

"'Surface attacks on Buddhism while deceiving Confucianism; hidden attacks on Confucianism while exalting oneself.' The stubbornness of their heresy and poisonous fallacy is even worse than this insect..." Mumbling a favorite sentence from his essay *Unbearable Not to Speak*, Huang Zhen couldn't resist raising his hand to brush away the half-woven web. "To cleanse the world, must one not begin with a single room?"

Unfortunately, just as he lifted his hand, he felt a wave of dizziness. The dull pain in his abdomen worsened, forcing him to lower his arm. This exertion left him somewhat drained, and he could only watch helplessly as that hateful spider continued weaving its web before his eyes.

World-Honored One, Shakyamuni Buddha above, your lay disciple Huang Tianxiang bows in reverence from the south. This disciple traveled north yet has failed in the duty to reject the demon Ricci. Is he now to die a stranger in this foreign land?

Huang Zhen's early appearance in Hangzhou was indeed due to the butterfly effect, just as Zhang Yingchen had surmised. Qiwei Depot had recently opened overland passenger and freight transport services connecting Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang. Although Qiwei hadn't invested in road construction and still used existing roads, its transportation organization far surpassed anyone else in this time-space. Journeys that many had previously regarded as perilous became acceptable.

It was precisely this improvement that gave Huang Zhen, far away in Zhangzhou, the idea to travel to Hangzhou ahead of schedule to debate the missionaries. Like many people of his time, Huang Zhen wouldn't leave his hometown without compelling necessity, let alone cross mountains to go to Zhejiang.

Gazing at the spider going its own way, the torment of illness left Scholar Huang praying silently, completely failing to notice the footsteps at the door.

"Sir, watch your step. Let this humble one carry the medicine chest." Zhao Tong of Qiwei Escort Bureau led the way. This Mr. Zhang was a wandering Quanzhen Daoist currently staying at Qingyun Temple outside Yongjin Gate. Though a Daoist, his medical skills were superb, and he had a reputation for compassionately helping the poor. Most importantly, he lacked the bad habit of those sitting doctors who held patients hostage for fees. Moreover, this Mr. Zhang was highly favored by the bureau's important client, Master Zhao. Zhao Tong knew that his own shopkeeper was extremely respectful to Master Zhao, and consequently was very respectful to this Daoist as well.

"No need. Cultivating the body is also cultivating the mind." Zhang Yingchen said pleasantly. They had walked for nearly half an hour from Qingyun Temple—he had declined the sedan chair Zhao Tong brought, insisting on walking. For a new religion, the preacher projecting an image of pure heart, few desires, and simple living helped establish a positive reputation.

Zhang Yingchen, half a head taller than Zhao Tong, carried his medicine chest while sizing up the young man sent by Qiwei Escort Bureau to escort him. Although Qiwei's compensation was unique in this time-space, the lean-as-a-bamboo-pole Zhao Tong wasn't his preferred type. And he didn't know if this young man practiced the Sha family style or Shaolin style, but he walked with ten toes visibly gripping the ground. This walking habit inevitably destroyed the harmony of the whole body, which was rather unlovely.

Clicking his tongue lightly, Zhang Yingchen tossed his observations about the young escort guard to the back of his mind. Making a house call to Shunhe Old Inn was an exception—to elevate his status and avoid being equated with itinerant "bell-ringing doctors," he generally didn't make house calls, even though he charged no fees. If wealthy gentry families invited him, they had to send at least a formal invitation card before he would go.

This exception was made entirely because this Scholar Huang was a crucial part of his plan.

Lay Buddhist Tianxiang, Huang Zhen—initiator of the great debate between Confucian-Buddhist scholars and Christianity in the Two Zhejiang region in the eighth year of Chongzhen. According to old time-space records, he shouldn't have arrived in Hangzhou until 1635. However, the development of Qiwei Depot made it possible for Huang Zhen, far away in Fujian, to travel north to Zhejiang early. The Transmigration Group's subtle influence on this time-space had reached the point where historical information from the old time-space was beginning to show significant deviations.

According to materials from the Grand Library, this Huang Zhen was a standard late Ming scholar who sought refuge in Chan Buddhism. Besides the self-awareness of being a guardian of orthodoxy typical of scholars in this era, he was also a fanatical Buddhist. In his open Chan letter *Unbearable Not to Speak*, besides hostility toward Matteo Ricci, Western learning, and the Jesuits, Daoism was also an existence he found unsightly. In this regard, he and Catholicism actually shared common interests. Zhang Yingchen calculated that he would have to find a way to slowly get rid of these people later.

But for now, he still needed to use him. As long as this fuse fulfilled its duty as a fuse, that was enough. While formulating the details of his next move, Zhang Yingchen stepped into the inn following Zhao Tong.

The innkeeper and staff of Shunhe Old Inn had been waiting a long time—a guest falling ill was the last thing an innkeeper wanted to see. Travelers falling ill for months, exhausting their funds, and getting stranded in inns wasn't rare at the time. It was a huge burden for established, reputable shops. For the sake of reputation, they couldn't just kick them out; they inevitably had to lose money. If the guest died in the inn, there would be the trouble and expense of calling officials for an inquest and burial. So as soon as Huang Zhen fell ill, the innkeeper immediately finding sent for doctors and medicine. Seeing the illness show no improvement, and hearing there was a Daoist at Qingyun Temple with brilliant medical skills, he hurriedly sent someone to invite him.

"The gentleman's illness arises merely from dampness trapping the spleen and stomach. Away from home, eating coarse food, plus not being acclimatized to the water and soil, some discomfort is inevitable. This illness isn't serious. This poor Daoist will write a prescription. Take medicine according to the prescription, rest for two days, and you'll be able to get out of bed. To recover faster, adding a dose of Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San [Agastache Powder to Rectify the Qi] will do."

Zhang Yingchen checked his pulse and observed his complexion, having a rough idea of the situation. Holding his quill pen, he wrote the prescription while giving medical advice to Huang Zhen lying on the bed.

"But the prescription Jin'an Hall wrote last time was Banxia Houpo Tang [Pinellia and Magnolia Bark Soup]." Scholars of this era often liked to discuss medicine; Confucian medicine replacing Daoist medicine had become a settled trend. Huang Zhen had read some medical books and could talk a bit about it. Though in Zhang Yingchen's eyes, this Huang Tianxiang was a standard amateur, he still couldn't resist showing off before this professional.

Huang Zhen's gaze landed on the quill pen in his hand: "Daoist Master's pen is rare!"

"This is a pen used by people of the Far West. It is convenient to carry. This poor Daoist is one who wanders the four directions; carrying it is a bit more convenient." Zhang Yingchen brought the conversation back:

"Banxia Houpo Tang can soothe liver qi; it is a decent formula. But in this poor Daoist's view, the gentleman's liver qi stagnation has not been for just a day. Since the illness comes from the seven emotions, it should be removed through the seven emotions. Banxia Houpo Tang can remove the surface, but cannot remove the root." Zhang Yingchen wrote the prescription while replying to this very stubborn-looking Fujian pedant. "I hear there is a Great Monk Yuanwu at Tiantong Temple in Ningbo whose Chan methods are profound. Once the gentleman recovers, you might visit this venerable Chan master. In the give-and-take of Chan wit, throwing off all worldly cares—then even without this poor Daoist's medicine, this illness would be seventy or eighty percent gone."

"Tiantong Temple?" Huang Zhen gently shook his head. He had fallen ill as soon as he arrived in Hangzhou. Tiantong Temple was far away in Ningbo. Although Monk Yuanwu was a target to visit on this trip, presumptuously asking him to lead the rejection of the "Ricci Demon" might not be easily granted.

"That Great Monk of Tiantong Temple has enormous prestige. Even in this Hangzhou city, many scholars and gentry follow and rely on him." As if unaware of the patient's silence, Zhang Yingchen spoke casually while writing the prescription. "There is a philanthropist in Hangzhou who happens to share the same clan name as this poor Daoist. Due to ancestors' military merit, he inherited a Hundred Households position. This Philanthropist Zhang once bowed under Grand Master Lianchi as a disciple, taking the generation name 'Guang'. Now that Master Lianchi has passed into nirvana, he often associates with Chan Master Yuanwu of Tiantong Temple. If the gentleman wishes to visit the Chan master, it might be good to ask this Hundred Households Master for help."

Picking up the prescription slip and blowing on it gently, Zhang Yingchen's gaze swept over Huang Zhen's face: the wedge had been driven into this Fujian scholar's heart. The show was about to begin.

When Zhang Guangtian returned from Jingci Temple, he still carried a bit of indignant emotion. This wasn't surprising; when Monk Guangdi, the supervisor of Jingci Temple, saw him out, they happened to encounter Scholar Fan from Fengshan Gate burning wood with several servants.

Not ordinary wood, but gilded and painted statues of gods. Several burly laborers pulled a whole cartload—Bodhisattvas, Arhats, Wenchang, God of Wealth—all chopped into wood chips without discrimination. Using scrolls of Buddhist and Daoist figures as kindling, they were holding a cremation ceremony. Only a celadon Guanyin, finely crafted, was spared. Monk Guangdi couldn't bear to watch and spent a string of cash to redeem it from the Fan family servant's hands, saving it from this calamity.

"What is this doing?" Zhang Guangtian frowned. He had no sense of sanctity toward religious statues—Chan Buddhism originally didn't place much importance on worshiping Buddhas and burning incense; many Chan temples didn't even set up Buddha statues. But as a Buddhist believer, seeing someone burning statues of Bodhisattvas and Buddhas was still rather unpleasant.

"Does Senior Brother not know?" Guangdi knew this Hundred Households Zhang had also received the Bodhisattva precepts under Chan Master Yunqi. They counted as disciples of the same generation. Though Zhang was ten years younger than him, calling him "Senior Brother" was appropriate.

The extremely stout supervisor monk held the porcelain Bodhisattva and gave a dry laugh: "This Scholar Fan talked a few times with those Western priests last year, and borrowed a few books to copy and study. Just like Master Yang Qiyuan [Yang Tingyun] back then, he entered the religion. Once he entered, it was no small matter: now the whole Fan family venerates that Far Western teaching. They say the Far Western teaching establishes no idols, so the old mistress of his house sent word to ban all these heaven-deceiving wood and stone dolls."
