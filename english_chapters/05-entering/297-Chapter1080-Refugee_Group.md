# Chapter 1080 - Refugee Group

Grouping the short-barreled Minié rifle on his back, the cavalry corporal threw the reins to a subordinate soldier, walked with difficulty through the snow to a corpse, and flipped it over with the tip of his boot.

The deceased had a dark, coarse face, weathered by the elements, age indistinguishable. The corpse wore rough iron armor, and a helmet had rolled far away. The corporal carefully looked at the dirty and worn uniform and equipment on his body, feeling very familiar—the corporal was a cavalryman in Guyuan Town three years ago. When the Tartars entered the pass for the first time, he followed the army to enter the capital to "serve the King" and scattered to the Central Plains due to a mutiny over unpaid wages.

The changing winds and clouds of life ultimately made him cross thousands of *li* to become a Fubo Army cavalry corporal wearing a cavalry cloak. The opponent only carried a long sword and did not carry a bow and arrow, obviously not prepared for an armed conflict—they were just out to rob.

The corporal looked around. His soldiers were gathering the horses left by the rebels. The Chiefs valued horses very much; the credit for bringing these few horses back was enough.

The corporal took off the long sword beside the corpse and threw it on his horse—this long sword still had some value. They were currently very short of cavalry weapons. Lingao had never manufactured cavalry sabers, so the equipment for cavalry was also the standard machete. Although the quality of the blade was good, it was ultimately not very suitable for cavalry combat on horseback. Therefore, Zhu Mingxia ordered attention to be paid to collecting Ming army cavalry long swords suitable for cavalry use.

After rescuing the first batch of refugees, the cavalry squad continued to search for the large group of refugees in the intelligence. Finding them was not difficult. In clear weather, the snow dust raised by a large group of people walking could be seen from far away.

Soon they found these people. Their position was not much different from the initial reconnaissance. The huge, disorderly team moved slowly, walking less than two kilometers per hour.

The scout cavalry carefully stopped at a not-so-distant place, observing the refugee team.

The refugee team was huge and mixed. Although it looked like a gray, messy crowd, there was actually a certain organization within it. Generally, with their own village or clan as the core, they formed a state of groups within the group. Young adults walked on the periphery, the old, weak, women, and children in the middle, mixed with wheelbarrows carrying broken furniture and grain. Sometimes those who couldn't walk and were weak could sit on the cart for a while.

There were also some people who were marginalized, completely squeezed to the periphery of the crowd, receiving no rest or help. Except for the particularly strong ones, they gradually fell behind and became prisoners of the rebels or a corpse on the snow.

The corporal was in no hurry to spur his horse forward—a dozen people couldn't control so many refugees at all. If the crowd was startled and scattered, it would be even harder to handle.

However, at this moment, he suddenly discovered snow smoke raised by horses galloping past beside the team. He couldn't help but shout: "Situation! Attention to observation!"

All soldiers straightened up, observing the surroundings. Through the gaps in the crowd, some cavalry could be vaguely seen passing quickly around the crowd from time to time. Every time they passed the edge of the crowd at close range, there would always be a burst of shouting and screaming.

The corporal knew: These refugees had been entangled by rebel cavalry—the rebels were few in number; even with a few thousand people gathered together, they didn't dare to step forward to drive them. So they harassed from the side, launching a raid from time to time to disperse the refugees on the edge, delay the moving speed of the refugees, and consume their physical strength. Waiting for other large groups of rebels to arrive before slowly carving up this big fish.

The two sides stalemated like this. The refugees knew very well that the longer it dragged on, the more rebels there would be, and the harder it would be for them to escape. Dragging to the end, a catastrophe was inevitable. Some villages had organized village braves in the past; relying on having weapons in hand, they had also organized actions to expel rebel roving cavalry. But this kind of loose attack had little effect other than letting the rebels kill a few people. It only temporarily drove away the rebels, who would soon tail them again. The team simply couldn't move. But a small number of people breaking away from the main group to advance quickly couldn't guarantee safety—no single clan or village group could maintain cohesion without collapsing under the assault of fifty or sixty cavalrymen—even if they had several hundred people.

In such slow progress with occasional small conflicts erupting, many people had already exhausted their physical strength. Many exhausted people simply sat on the ground, closed their eyes, and waited for death.

The scout cavalry immediately turned back to find the main force and reported the precise location of the team. Zhu Mingxia immediately ordered the whole army to seize favorable positions to intercept the refugee group head-on.

When the main force arrived, the refugee colony had completely stopped moving. There were already a hundred or so rebel cavalry wandering around the refugees. From time to time, someone would shoot an arrow into the crowd. Like wolves watching a flock of sheep, the situation was very dangerous.

"Huang Xiong! Form ranks!" Zhu Mingxia shouted.

"Yes!" Huang Xiong immediately ran out. "Two-row line!"

With his command, non-commissioned officers at all levels quickly transmitted the order. One infantry company deployed a 75m wide two-row battle line on the slope in front of a small hill. Two typewriters were configured on the flanks—although the 12-pound mountain howitzer was very light, the ammunition was inconvenient to carry by manpower, so Zhu Mingxia didn't bring it.

The village brave company and baggage company were behind the team, guarding the work team and refugees collected along the road.

This formation was very novel at that time, especially the strange thin battle line—with the level of firearms at that time, it was not enough to support such a weak battle line. Just as the rebels gathering to prepare for battle were wondering what kind of bullshit formation this was, Zhu Mingxia raised his SKS-D and fired the first shot—one shot hit a rebel, and the 7.62mm M43 bullet went through his body and hit another rebel. This rifle was very comfortable to shoot after modern modification; a Senator who didn't understand military affairs once mistook it for an AK-47. The semi-automatic firing mode also had sufficiently fierce firepower. In this spacetime, automatic fire was more often a waste of ammunition.

After the first shot was fired. Huang Xiong immediately ordered a volley. The battle line fired two consecutive volleys according to the requirements of the drill manual. The gathered cavalry instantly fell into chaos. Although the distance of more than two hundred meters greatly discounted the shooting accuracy, the rebels concentrating together just allowed the Minié rifles to exert the advantage of massed target firepower.

Two waves of lead bullets swept through the rebel ranks. Screams and horse neighs instantly became a chaotic mess. People who were hit and fell from their horses were immediately trampled to death by wounded and frightened horses.

"Fire at will!" With Zhu Mingxia's order, more than a hundred rifles fired in competition. Subsequently, two typewriters also spat out tongues of fire. Rebels were hit and fell from their horses one after another. Some rebels who were not hit saw the situation was bad and spurred their horses to run.

Zhu Mingxia fired half a clip continuously but only dropped one more person. Hitting a moving target at a distance of more than two hundred meters relied heavily on luck, so he didn't waste bullets.

"Cease fire!" He ordered. "Cavalry, go collect horses! Move fast. Work team, village brave company, control the refugees!"

He noticed a commotion among the refugees during the battle just now; it seemed there was a tendency to move again. The situation must be controlled immediately; otherwise, if the crowd scattered, the goal could not be achieved.

His use of a deluxe lineup and huge ostentation to drive away dozens of rebels just now was partly to stabilize the situation quickly, and partly had the meaning of killing the chicken to scare the monkey: driving away the rebels with thunderous means to scare the refugees silly.

After dispersing the rebels, the recovery team took the opportunity to control the refugees. Zhu Mingxia ordered soldiers to guard the refugees with weapons, and the huge typewriters also aimed fiercely at these poor people. He didn't think these thousands of people would follow him honestly—for these people to walk here, they were actually already organized armed refugee groups. He noticed that many young adults had sticks and sharpened wooden spears in their hands, and some carried farm tools acting as weapons. There were too many changes along this road, the most critical being the tiger-watching rebels; he had to use some tricks to complete the task.

It was less than twenty *li* from the Huang County seat here. If the rebel main infantry force in Huang County moved out, they could arrive here in two hours without delay. Cavalry would be even faster.

However, judging from the scout's report, the main rebel force in Huang County was currently still busy raping, looting, and enjoying their spoils in the city. Outside the city, it was still dominated by small groups of scattered men and horses, and a large-scale pursuing force would not form in a short time.

"Huang Xiong, tell people to get ropes and tie these refugees up for me. Just watch how I 'scatter beans to become soldiers' (*Sadou Chengbing*)."

After the cavalry fired consecutively and killed several refugees attempting to escape in the chaos, the entire refugee team came to a halt. The work team and village braves roared with megaphones: "Everyone kneel down! Hands on head!"

Zhu Mingxia's plan of "scattering beans to become soldiers" was very simple. First, select relatively strong refugees from among them. According to Zhu Mingxia's requirements, as long as the body was solid and the spirit was good, they were divided into groups of twenty, mixed men and women. Their right hands were tied to a rope at intervals of sixty centimeters. In this way, they could only walk in a single file column. Then let a village brave lead the rope, with the stride and speed controlled by the village brave. These village braves were all selected, physically strong, and with good training results, having already developed formation awareness. Letting them lead the refugees actually created an effect of neat queues. With order in the team, they walked faster.

All things on the wheelbarrows, except strictly necessary grain and cotton clothes, were discarded to let the old, weak, women, and children ride. Sandwiched in the middle of the team. Because wheelbarrows were limited, some children were carried by certain relatively strong men and women.

The work team didn't use persuasion or inducement—with soldiers holding rifles with fixed bayonets following behind, any refusal or delay would get a merciless rifle butt, plus a shining bayonet. As a result, the mixed refugee group was quickly organized.

According to Zhu Mingxia's estimation, walking to the transfer point before dark would be no problem. At that time, letting these refugees crowd together to rest would also be a bit warmer. After daybreak, even if a large group of enemies chased them, he could rely on the village stockade to fight a battle and repel the enemy without difficulty.
