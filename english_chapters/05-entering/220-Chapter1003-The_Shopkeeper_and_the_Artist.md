# Chapter 1003 The Shopkeeper and the Artist

By Shan Daoqian's standards, Lingao's train could only be considered an urban rail transit system. It had expanded from the original factory rail car line used to transport goods—used to transport products, raw materials, and workers. This rail network had developed to change from gas locomotive heads to Meteor-type steam locomotive heads, with routes expanding from small railways running within factory zones to the entire county: the operating line ran from Wenlan Bridge Station outside the county seat, along the Wenlan River all the way to Bopu, then extended from Bopu toward Maniao—connecting Lingao's main industrial and port areas.

Van de Lantron and Trini sat in first class—because of coal smoke and steam, the first-class car was coupled at the very end. First class was slightly better than the cars in front. The front cars were flatbed open carriages for both passengers and cargo. When used as passenger cars, railings were installed around all four sides. Passengers sat on the floor; when it was too crowded, people simply stood packed together. Because it was completely open-air, there was no ventilation problem.

Only occasionally—such as during major ceremonies or celebrations—would a few rows of wooden benches be temporarily installed on the flatbed cars.

The flatbed cars naturally had no canopies. When it rained or temperatures were too high, temporary canvas awnings were installed. When the train ran, coal smoke and steam pervaded, enough to suffocate passengers in the first two cars. The rails were standard gauge but lightly forged wrought iron rails; sleepers were also makeshift. The entire rail transit system's equipment was shockingly crude.

But such crude motorized transport was also revolutionary for Lingao's industry: the small train enabled large numbers of workers to move quickly from one place to another. Workers could commute in minimal time—Lingao's factory zones were growing larger, and worker residential areas had to be built farther from the factory zones.

The first-class car the two Europeans were in was exclusively for Senators and natives and naturalized citizens willing to pay high prices. Although the car chassis was the same as flatbed cars, a body was added. Not only were there glass-inlaid windows, but also shutters—under the blazing sun, it was both ventilated and spared one from sun exposure. The carriage also had seats.

Van de Lantron looked around the empty carriage with interest—he and Trini were the only two passengers in first class this trip.

"This is so-called first class?" Van de Lantron saw the carriage's furnishings and decorations were very simple, though practical. Even to this Dutchman, the Australians' "first class" was far too unworthy of the name.

Trini said: "Yes, Australians are simple by nature. Secondly, their so-called first class is compared to the cars in front."

"Oh?" Van de Lantron leaned his head out the window with interest to look. Every car in front was packed with passengers and cargo. Passengers who simply couldn't squeeze on either hung on the railings or climbed onto the cargo piles on the flatbed cars, perched high above.

"Truly a rare spectacle." Van de Lantron laughed. "But I'm quite skeptical—loaded with so many people and goods, what exactly powers this train you speak of to pull it? And can run as fast as a horse? In your report you said it's a machine of fire and water power. Can it really be so marvelous?"

"Precisely so." Trini said. "In my humble opinion, the Australians have mastered many of God's secrets still unknown to us..."

Van de Lantron was a Protestant who sneered at Catholic faith. He snorted: "I'd say the devil's secrets—just like that learned countryman of yours, Da Vinci."

Trini didn't speak. He felt there was nothing worth discussing with this Netherlander shopkeeper on this issue. Protestants weren't more devoted to science than Catholics—sometimes the opposite. The "Father of blood circulation" was burned by Calvinists in Switzerland. Trini knew he'd better say little about scientific matters—even though Holland was among Europe's most tolerant places on religious issues, the East India Company in Batavia wasn't tolerant at all.

He had originally wanted to share his observations about the "train" with Van de Lantron, but seeing this man was obviously unlearned, he dropped the idea. At that moment the carriage suddenly shook, steel creaked, and the carriage slowly began rolling on the tracks.

Twenty-some minutes later, the Dutchman and Italian got off at the "Trading Post" station. A two-wheeled Dongfeng horse carriage waited at the station—this was a public carriage sent by the Colonial Trade Department.

"Trading Post" was a project jointly applied for by the Colonial Trade Department and the Office Administration. During this year's typhoon rains, Lingao also suffered disaster. Although no one was displaced, quite a bit of land was flooded—including much that the Agricultural Committee had planned to cultivate. The "Trading Post" was one of the flooded areas, except it had never been cultivated at all.

The reason for flooding was that this area was a lowland behind coastal sand dunes. Land at the coastal margin slid toward the sea year after year; tides then deposited sand back to form beaches; wind blew sand inland to form natural sand dunes several meters high and dozens of meters wide; behind the dunes was subsiding land. The Agricultural Committee had done some leveling for nothing, then discovered that treating the salinity and alkalinity here far exceeded current productivity. Then it was soaked again by heavy rain, so investment in this land was written off as tuition. Finally, the Agricultural Committee decided to abandon agricultural development of this site and hand it over to the Forestry Department for transformation.

The Forestry Department decided to transform the entire coastal lowland into a mangrove zone to stabilize sand and resist wind, reducing wave erosion of the coastline. Slightly more inland would be converted to coconut palm plantations.

East of this lowland was a range of low hills, beyond which was Maniao. With the opening of the Bopu-Maniao railway, the Executive Committee Office Administration and Colonial Department decided to convert this land into a future state guesthouse and embassy district. First was inviting the East India Company to move in, and using the money the East India Company paid to dam a nearby mountain stream into a small reservoir for supplying water nearby—if generators could be mass-produced later, they could even do some small hydropower.

The carriage carried them along the road, quickly arriving at the trading post area. This was still desolate—besides the leveled land, there were only a few lonely wooden structures, some still under construction.

The Dutch East India Company trading post was being built—more precisely, the foundation was being dug. Trini had designed a quite sturdy and beautiful two-story brick hall. However, Lingao Construction Company said the construction period would be two years. So the current trading post consisted of two simple, attractive wooden houses, prefabricated units designed by Zhang Xingpei. It took just one week to fully assemble and decorate, leaving Trini dumbfounded.

The two wooden houses served one for office and one for residence. The Prince's flag and company flag flew from the roof. Trini welcomed him into the parlor. The parlor had already been newly decorated with furniture and handicrafts purchased from Batavia and Guangzhou. Oil portraits of the Prince of Orange and company directors hung on the walls, looking quite imposing.

Although an Italian lived in the house, it still maintained the Dutch passion for cleanliness: clean and tidy. One of Trini's Dutch servants washed the entire house every day. Trini suspected this servant was nine times out of ten sent by the company to secretly monitor him.

Both sides sat down. The servant brought local refreshing beverages. The two sat on Lingao-produced rattan sofas. Van de Lantron had a bellyful of questions; on his own turf, he immediately began asking. Trini was obviously also prepared for this.

"Mr. Trini, please tell me clearly, how is the Australians' military strength?"

"Extremely great." Trini said clearly. "Their potential is incalculable—terrifying."

"Oh? What gave you such an impression?"

"You just rode their train."

"Yes, the Australians' train—very special."

"You must see the train's military applications."

"The train is indeed powerful, but it's merely a transport vehicle. Even the best carriage can't fight."

"You seem to have forgotten what our masters rely on to dominate the seas—ships."

"That's different. Trains can't enter the sea. Besides, this train must run on tracks. I don't see how much military value it has."

"The train you just rode—now it can run 5 leagues per hour. I've also seen it run 10 leagues. Now the Australians have used tracks to connect their most core ruling area—Lingao-Bairen-Bopu-Maniao—into one..."

"Just to transport goods and craftsmen and farmers."

"They can use trains to send troops from one place to another within a few hours. And they also have trains specifically for combat, equipped with cannons and an evil weapon they call 'typewriter.' Even a thousand well-disciplined Swedish infantry couldn't stand for a quarter hour before an armored train. Actually, a hundred Australian soldiers plus a few cannons could tear a thousand of Europe's best infantry to shreds."

"You exaggerate too much."

"I swear to God, my words are absolutely true."

"Alright." Van de Lantron nodded. "I'll include your exact words in the report." He didn't want to continue dwelling on this issue now. "Now, the company wants to know: are the Australians preparing any activities targeting the company?"

"As far as I know: no." Trini hesitated slightly, an expression Van de Lantron quickly caught.

"Speak plainly, Mr. Trini," Van de Lantron lowered his voice. "You know, a few months ago, an Australian ship went to Formosa..."

"Went to Tayouan harbor?"

"No, they didn't enter the port but continued south along the coastline, reaching a wild coast. And landed there. According to various information we indirectly obtained from natives, it must have been the Australians."
