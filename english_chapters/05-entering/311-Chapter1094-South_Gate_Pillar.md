# Chapter 1094 - South Gate Pillar

Senator Lü's proposal coincided with his ideas, but under the current tendency of "engineers ruling the government," the possibility of passing a proposal directly to the Senate was unlikely to be high: the reputation of the Finance and Economics Department was probably only limitedly better than the few "litigation tricksters" of the "Law Club." It was better to save the country by a devious path. Lü Zeyang's plan was: he would go on field duty to Shandong, first using the advantage of his local background to gain a firm foothold in the Engine Action, maintain good relations with the Intelligence Agency and the military, improve the status and influence of the Finance and Economics Department in the Senate, and finally decide when the time was ripe. Yi Fan thought about it and planned with Cheng Dong for half a day, and finally agreed. So Senator Lü was "borrowed" to the Foreign Intelligence Agency for training for half a month. A few days after Sun Yuanhua arrived in Laizhou, he also hurried over.

The Senate's guiding ideology for Laizhou's city defense was: hold it, but don't make the rebels despair too much and give up attacking the city. The best result was for the rebels to hoard heavy troops for a long-term siege, with small groups of chaotic soldiers looting everywhere. When the court's main army arrived, causing the entire Three Eastern Prefectures to rot and power to be in a "vacuum" stage, it would facilitate the development of the Engine Action.

Under these circumstances, naturally, the main force of the Northbound Detachment could not be sent to help defend the city directly—local bureaucrats and gentry in Laizhou might not agree, and Sun Yuanhua couldn't bear this responsibility. But arranging a small detachment carrying heavy firearms to enter the city to directly strike the rebels at critical moments was still necessary, to avoid the city really being broken causing an unmanageable situation, and also counting as a big favor to Sun Yuanhua.

After research, the Engine Forward Command decided to split off a company, carrying heavy fire suppression equipment like mountain howitzers and typewriters to ascend the Laizhou city wall, providing direct fire support. Lü Zeyang was the commander of this unit, fully responsible for Laizhou's city defense and liaison matters.

For this reason, Lü Zeyang specially went to a village where the Lü clan gathered. Mimicking the style of veteran soldiers returning to Taiwan to visit relatives back then, he went to the clan leader's home and took out the "genealogy" forged by the Great Library to establish a relationship first. With that authentic dialect plus a round of silver bullet offensive, he made the clan leader confusedly recognize this "clan nephew" first. Then Special Reconnaissance Team members dressed as domestic servants controlled the whole families of the clan leader and main elders in the clan. Then "holding the clan leader hostage to command the whole village," he announced Lü Zeyang as the "Deputy Regiment Commander." Lü Family Village was considered to have fallen into Lü Zeyang's hands. He recruited a few local youths from local village braves, camouflaged gun carriages and such with canvas, and the Laizhou Detachment of the Northbound Detachment openly turned into Lü Family Village "native" village braves.

Lü Zeyang followed the advisor to report to Zhu Wannian. Zhu Wannian knew Lü Family Village, and seeing he spoke a mouthful of local dialect, he didn't suspect, and immediately registered the number of people. Village braves and soldiers entering the city, in addition to grain and fodder supply per head, also had a reward of one tael of silver per person. Therefore, most troops from various routes had behaviors of falsely reporting numbers.

Zhu Wannian turned a blind eye to this matter. At present, it was the time for officers and soldiers to risk their lives; he couldn't be stingy with silver. Being able to hold Laizhou had a great relationship with the gentry and big households in the city taking out money to reward soldiers heavily at the beginning: originally the defenders of Laizhou were tempted by rebel soldiers and prepared to be insider traitors to rebel. Zhu Wannian mobilized gentry and big households in the city to reward the three armies heavily, supplemented by a city-purging action, which saved Laizhou from being taken by rebel soldiers.

Lü Zeyang brought a company of people, plus gunners, Special Reconnaissance members, and Lü Family Village village braves. The total number added up to more than one hundred and forty people. Immediately he reported one hundred and fifty people, considered particularly thrifty.

Zhu Wannian immediately instructed the clerk to issue silver and ten days of grain and firewood according to the portion of one hundred and fifty people, and issued documents for collecting grain and fodder. He asked if he needed to supplement any weapons. Lü Zeyang expressed no need for now: weapons and equipment were very sufficient.

Zhu Wannian was very surprised to hear that he volunteered to guard the South *Guanxiang*—guarding a stockade outside the city was a very risky thing, almost being an abandoned pawn. Once the situation was critical, the city would close the gates, and none of the soldiers responsible for guarding the city gates would survive. Seeing the comer calm and composed, talking and laughing as usual, he couldn't help but admire secretly.

"So the Lü family actually has such courageous and loyal children. The folk really hides tigers and crouching dragons." Zhu Wannian praised. Seeing Lü Zeyang wearing no armor, he suggested giving him a suit of cotton armor.

"Many thanks for Lord's great love, this commoner doesn't need this." Lü Zeyang said carelessly, "Armor is inconvenient for movement and unfavorable for fighting."

Zhu Wannian praised him a few more sentences and sent another person to take him to the South *Guanxiang* to take over defense.

The *Guanxiang* had already been "fortified walls and cleared fields." Commoners and valuables had entered the city. Able-bodied men were organized into a team, closing the gates of various streets and alleys under the leadership of the South *Guanxiang Paijia* (community head). Entrances and exits of various streets facing outside were blocked with bricks, stones, and earthbags—although not very useful, at least they could delay the enemy attacking the city.

Someone also piled firewood and vegetable oil in various houses, ready to set fire once the *Guanxiang* fell. Although the *Guanxiang* belonged to the mandatory defense scope, no one thought the *Guanxiang* could be defended for a long time. So able-bodied men and the *Paijia* all had sad faces—as able-bodied men and *Paijia* of the South *Guanxiang*, they probably had no chance to retreat into the city, and nine out of ten would be buried here together with the officers and soldiers stationed here.

The advisor called the local *Paijia* Fan Twelve over, telling him to obey "Strong man Lü's" arrangements in everything.

Fan Twelve was the owner and cook of a small restaurant in the South *Guanxiang*, considered a person with some assets. He knew some kung fu kicks and punches, and on weekdays could muddle through with yamen runners and clerks in the yamen, so he ended up with this *Paijia* job.

Being a *Paijia* had quite a few benefits, so Fan Twelve inevitably did some dirty work that people cursed behind his back—but generally within the tolerance of local residents. He was also willing to stand up for local commoners in official matters, so his reputation was passable. He also made some small money.

Unexpectedly, rebel soldiers were coming to attack Laizhou. Plus various atrocities of rebel soldiers everywhere were reported, Fan Twelve's heart was like frying in oil: he had a family old and young. Although they had been sent into the city, no one was sure if Laizhou could be held. Moreover, if he lost his life in the city defense battle, his son was still young, and the left property would either be destroyed by war or occupied by others. It was not impossible for the family to be reduced to beggars and refugees—so he had been dispirited all these days.

Lü Zeyang saw this *Paijia* looking like waiting for death. He comforted him a few sentences and bragged about himself, telling him to rest assured: the South *Guanxiang* would be foolproof.

"As long as people are in the *Guanxiang*, the *Guanxiang* will be here. We will definitely fight to the death to ensure the *Guanxiang* is not lost!" Lü Zeyang said with soaring heroism.

"Since the strong man says so, this small one trusts it." Although Fan Twelve didn't look like he "trusted it," he finally managed to cheer up. Lü Zeyang's guarantee was worthless to him: these one hundred or so people only had one knife and one gun each. Although everyone carried a bird gun, they didn't even have a suit of armor. Looking at this appearance, they didn't look like battle-hardened elite soldiers anywhere—besides, they were just village braves from Lü Family Village.

However, they were brought by Governor Sun personally. It seemed officials in the city attached great importance to them. Fan Twelve dared not neglect.

"You take me to walk inside and outside the *Guanxiang* now. I want to survey the terrain."

Under Fan Twelve's lead, Lü Zeyang walked around inside and outside the South *Guanxiang*. Finally, he chose the Wang Family Cemetery of a big local household as the stationing and defense location.

This cemetery had high and dry terrain: situated on a high mound. It was divided into Yin (dead) and Yang (living) residences. Surrounded by dense big trees on four sides, with a small river circling it, and having high walls itself. With slight modification, it would be a suitable fortress. Moreover, topographically it directly controlled the road to the Moon City (*Yuecheng*/Barbican). If rebels wanted to attack the South Gate, they would be subjected to flanking fire from the Wang Family Cemetery and couldn't even rush into the *Guanxiang*.

Less than one *li* south from the South *Guanxiang* was the Yenan River. It was currently frozen and lacked defensive value. Lü Zeyang planned to ask the *Paijia* to dig another trench outside the *Guanxiang* and set up chevaux-de-frise to delay rebel soldiers' movement.

After arranging properly, Lü Zeyang took Fan Twelve back to the Wang Family Cemetery. A command post had been set up in the ancestral hall. A large map of Laizhou hung on the wall. On the table, a sand table model of the Laizhou area packed in boxes was being assembled: including a large-scale sand table model of the whole city and a small-scale terrain model of Laizhou.

A fire had been lit in the room using the lightweight iron stove brought along. The tall and gloomy main hall of the ancestral hall instantly became warm as spring. Fan Twelve looked at the stove curiously—this stove was truly good-looking and lightweight! Wondered where it came from?

Lü Zeyang asked him to sit down and said: "We are in the same boat now. Everyone must take care of each other."

Fan Twelve busy stood up and said with a sincere face: "Master Lü! What are you saying? You are our backbone now. The commoners of this entire *Guanxiang* are counting on you!"

"Not at all, not at all, I'm not a court official." Lü Zeyang knew these were polite words of flattery, but they were always very useful. He couldn't help showing a smile: "How many people are in your able-bodied squad?" He said seriously again, "This is a major plan for defense. I need to know the details of everything—you are the host, I am the guest. I have my own sense of propriety in everything."

Employing workers always had drawbacks regardless of ancient or modern times. Lü Zeyang said this specially to avoid suspicion from the other party.

This kind of able-bodied squad temporarily conscripted from ordinary commoners aged sixteen to fifty didn't have much combat power in city defense battles, but they were very good labor.

"Exactly how many people, I'm afraid I can't explain clearly for a while." Fan Twelve smiled apologetically, "Quite a few ran away these past few days. Let me tell you the truth: Three hundred and twenty able-bodied men were reported to the county yamen, but actually there are probably two hundred and eighty."

Equivalent to embezzling forty people's rations every day—Lü Zeyang thought this guy was dark enough!

"...Please see clearly, Venerable Sir, this is also a last resort for me..." Fan Twelve "complained", "Everyone knows there are benefits in *Paijia* managing able-bodied squads. Which god or petty person from various routes dares not be offended? All have to be given a share..."

"It doesn't matter," Lü Zeyang smiled, "This is also expected. *Paijia* Fan doesn't need to take it to heart."
