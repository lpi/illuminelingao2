# Chapter 1102 - The Test

Zhang Pu said nothing, making no commitment, merely holding his teacup and sipping slowly, silently, not even glancing at his guest. Zhao Yingong felt a flutter of unease: was his host using silence to indicate rejection? Suddenly he became alert—this must be a test. China's power-holders, in order to project an air of inscrutability and exert pressure, often relished such psychological tactics.

The only counter was complete indifference: silence for silence.

After a long pause, Zhang Pu spoke again: "I hear you have a bookshop in Hangzhou?"

"Indeed. Wanbi Bookshop is my enterprise," Zhao Yingong thought. This "speaking of other matters" was also a classic conversational technique. He composed himself and replied evenly, neither arrogant nor flustered.

"I've heard that Wanbi Bookshop is quite well-managed. You must possess considerable skill in the art of Tao Zhu."

"My forebears traded for generations before building the family fortune. Though I have entered scholarly life, I dare not forget the toil of our ancestors carrying their wares to market." Zhao Yingong stood and spoke with utmost respect.

This manner earned a nod from Zhang Pu. He had long heard from Sun Chun, Fang Yizhi, and other Revival Society members about this Master Zhao and his Wanbi Bookshop. Though Master Zhao appeared elegant and refined, his actual scholarly learning was sparse—among the classics, histories, masters, and collected works, aside from having some familiarity with "history," he was practically ignorant. When discussing Song dynasty history, he spoke with depth and insight; he clearly had extensive research into figures and events of that period. Yet when confronted with the original texts from *Zizhi Tongjian* or the *History of Song*, he was mostly clueless. But when it came to "miscellaneous learning" and "investigation of things," others appeared utterly ignorant before him. Fang Yizhi's letter mentioning Zhao Yingong had expressed tremendous admiration for his miscellaneous erudition.

In sum, this Master Zhao's knowledge was peculiar indeed. The origins of his *xiucai* credentials were all too apparent.

More intriguing still: the merchandise sold at Master Zhao's Wanbi Bookshop was predominantly "Australian goods." As it happened, the current Taicang Prefect, Liu Shidou, was a native of Nanhai County. He and Zhang Pu had passed the same examination year and was a Revival Society member. Thus Zhang Pu knew a great deal about the "Australians" in Guangdong and their various activities.

Zhao Yingong was evidently one of those Guangdong locals who had risen to prominence through the Australians—Zhang Pu had reached this conclusion long ago, and now he was even more convinced.

The question was: why would someone with such deep Australian connections wish to rescue Sun Huodong's career? Sun Huodong might be devoted to Western learning, but there was no word of him having any dealings with the Australians.

He asked: "What do you seek to gain by rescuing Huodong from his predicament?"

Zhao Yingong was well-prepared. He drew the sign of the cross on his chest. Zhang Pu nodded: "Ah—so you and Sun Huodong are of the same faith!"

He then asked: "Since you possess the arts of Tao Zhu, you must be well-versed in matters of economics and practical governance."

Zhao Yingong found this digression hard to follow and wondered what he was driving at. "I have some modest knowledge," he replied.

"Here in Taicang, which was carved from portions of Kunshan, Changshu, and Jiading, the terrain is elevated. The common people mostly grow cotton, with little rice cultivation. Every year when the autumn grain tax and the white-grain levy come due, they must purchase grain from elsewhere to fulfill their obligations. Setting aside the hardships of transporting this tribute grain to the capital, every year when they sell cotton and buy grain, unscrupulous merchants obstruct traders from bringing in grain, hoarding to drive up prices. A single *shi* of rice can reach one tael and three or four *qian*. The suffering of the people is beyond words—many are ruined by this burden. I wonder what solution you might propose?"

Zhao Yingong started: was this a test of his economic acumen? He thought for a moment and understood—Zhang Pu had likely already decided to agree to his request, but wanted to see whether he had the ability to be worth helping.

Once this was clear, there was nothing surprising about it. The phenomenon of low cotton prices and high grain prices was not unfamiliar to Zhao Yingong. Wherever economic crops predominated, similar problems existed—Leizhou had them too. But Taicang's situation differed from Leizhou's. Jiangnan was a heavily-taxed region under the Ming, with substantial grain levies. The "white grain transport to Beijing" imposed an especially crushing burden on locals.

The so-called white grain transport referred to the tribute grain sent from the twenty-four counties and one prefecture of five Nanzhi prefectures—Suzhou, Changzhou, Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Huzhou—to supply the capital's granaries, the Imperial Household, the Wine-Vinegar-and-Flour Bureau, the Imperial Clan Court, and officials' salaries. The annual quota exceeded 210,000 *shi*. These included premium varieties such as polished fine rice, polished round-rice, and polished glutinous rice. Since the grain was destined for imperial and official consumption, quality requirements were exacting, and official exchange rates valued white grain far above common rice. Furthermore, the surcharges for white grain transport exceeded all other categories of tribute grain. Every prefectural and county gazetteer of the five prefectures unanimously declared that whoever served as a white grain transport headman was certain to be ruined. After the Wanli era, this only worsened. The transport costs were so enormous that only wealthy households could possibly afford the headman role, yet throughout the Ming, this corvée remained the nightmare of local landlords and gentry.

Zhao Yingong recalled the materials he had studied. Historically, Zhang Pu had concerned himself greatly with this issue—after all, it was his own homeland. His proposed solution was to divert Taicang's capital-bound tribute grain to supply the Taicang and Zhenhai Guards' military provisions locally, thereby eliminating the massive overhead of tribute transport and significantly reducing the people's burden. The proposal was practical and feasible. From Zhang Pu's recommendation, Zhao Yingong could see he grasped the problem's essence.

On the surface, during the cotton-to-grain exchange, someone was manipulating the grain supply channels to create cheap cotton and expensive grain, exacerbating the people's burden—the logical solution would be to address the grain circulation channels. But Zhang Pu saw clearly that the root cause lay not in grain prices but in the enormous waste of the tribute transport system—especially the white grain.

---

White grain transport used a system of "government-supervised, civilian-operated" transport. Grain headmen hired vessels, prepared supplies, and shipped the grain by canal to Beijing. From receiving transport subsidies locally, through paying fees at every lock and gate along the route, to finally delivering the grain to the capital warehouses—every step involved endless fees and surcharges.

A grain headman transported less than five hundred *shi* of white grain, yet transport costs per *shi* averaged around three *shi* during the Xuande era, rising to three or four by Chenghua, four to five by Zhengde and Jiajing, and commonly five to six by Wanli—sometimes spiking to eight. By Chongzhi's reign, a single grain headman's expenses could reach 1,500 taels.

Combined regular wastage and "gratuities" meant transport costs per *shi* of white grain ran several times to over ten times the actual tax. To meet their quotas, the common people had to prepare vast surpluses of grain, driving up demand for imported grain and further inflating prices.

Only by eliminating this excess "wastage" could the people's burden truly be lightened. To Zhao Yingong's mind, for Zhang Pu's time, this was the simplest and most effective solution within the existing system.

But Zhao Yingong knew that this eminently practical proposal ultimately failed in the face of opposition from transport interests. Not only that, but the prefect Liu Guangshi, who submitted the memorial, was demoted and transferred as punishment.

At every dynasty's end, vested interests clung stubbornly to their gains, blocking even the most modest reforms, until the situation became irretrievable. Compared to the Qing dynasty's tribute transport organization—equally bloated, corrupt, and wasteful—the Qing had at least reformed to government collection and government transport, liberating Jiangnan's commoners from the misery of personally delivering tribute grain. In transport efficiency, it vastly surpassed the Ming system.

During his year in Hangzhou, aside from running Wanbi Bookshop, Zhao Yingong had extensively surveyed Jiangnan's economy and people's livelihoods. He had particularly noted the region's quite developed civilian shipping industry. Not only had inland waterway transport achieved considerable scale, but on the coastal sea routes, Jiangnan's maritime shipping was also flourishing. In places like Shanghai County, large-scale shipowners had emerged—owning a dozen to over a hundred sand-boats, sailing north to Shandong, Tianjin, even Liaodong, transporting goods between north and south. Of course, these shipowners were still relatively primitive: most were also cargo owners themselves, not yet pure shipping enterprises, merely handling freight transport incidentally while meeting their own needs. The famous sand-boat guilds of Shanghai in the Qing dynasty developed precisely from this foundation.

In Zhao Yingong's view, the Ming could entirely convert the Grand Canal tribute to sea transport. This would not only save enormous transport costs and directly reduce the people's burden, but also eliminate the massive administrative overhead of maintaining the canal system. The comprehensive return on investment far exceeded disbanding the courier stations.

He had long been planning to establish a maritime shipping company for north-south freight. The Shanhai Five Routes' Dayou branch in Shanghai was already using local sand-boats for maritime north-south trade with handsome profits. If he established his own shipping company using H800-class vessels built at Lingao, with their superior performance, the profits would simply roll in.

If he could also win contracts for the Ming tribute transport—Zhao Yingong would laugh in his dreams. Such profits!

Of course, to conduct major trade and great business in the Ming, one needed gentry backing. He had originally set his sights on the Xu Guangqi household; now, hearing Zhang Pu raise this topic, he immediately sensed opportunity.

If Zhang Pu and the Revival Society could recognize the benefits of converting from canal to sea transport, his plan to take over tribute shipping would have excellent prospects.

Zhao Yingong spoke deliberately: "In my view, cheap cotton and expensive grain are but minor symptoms. The festering sore lies in the tribute transport itself!"

For an instant, he saw admiration flash in Zhang Pu's eyes. Not only because his insight was penetrating, but because it aligned perfectly with his host's own views.

Zhao Yingong thought: How shameful! Using cheat codes again!

He gathered his thoughts and began to expound. Starting from the problems of Ming tribute transport, he moved to the various corrupt practices and extortions of white grain, explaining how the people's burden lay not in the principal tax but in the endless "wastage surcharges." Seeing Zhang Pu listening intently, he gradually aimed his critique at the very transport system itself.

Having long prepared to "abolish canal, adopt sea," his reservoir of criticism was deep—pure blackmail material—and now he laid it out point by point, painting Ming tribute transport as utterly irredeemable, harmful to both nation and people.
