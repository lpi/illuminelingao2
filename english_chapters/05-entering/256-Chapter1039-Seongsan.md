# Chapter 1039: Seongsan

On the bridge of the *Zhenyang*, Rear Admiral of the Second Fleet Li Haiping stood akimbo with one hand and held a telescope with the other, gazing at the rising morning sun on the distant sea surface. He couldn't help but feel immensely heroic and wanted to recite something to "leave for history." Suffering from a lack of ink in his belly (lack of literary talent), he had to drop the idea of reciting a poem, holding back wanting to say a famous quote like "I came, I saw, I conquered," but finally just said one sentence:

"Jeju Island has been our country's inseparable territory since ancient times."

After saying that, he didn't even look back as he ordered:

"Write it down!"

The female orderly standing behind him hurriedly wrote down his words in a notebook.

After saying this sentence, he felt it wasn't quite flavorful enough. Just as he was trying to think of an original one, the lookout reported: "Jeju Island directly ahead, 10 nautical miles." He hurriedly picked up the telescope to observe the sea surface.

The sea was calm. In the vast emerald waters, a huge verdant island lay across the ocean, with Hallasan faintly visible.

In the visible sea area, almost no ships could be seen, only sporadic fishing boats which dodged one after another upon seeing such a huge fleet approaching.

Li Haiping took a deep breath of the fresh morning sea breeze, then looked at the huge fleet following behind, a sense of intoxication arising spontaneously. Now he was a dignified Fleet Admiral too. Thinking back to when he was at Changhua Fort staring blankly with dozens of naturalized marines, counting stars and watching the moon at night, and goofing off hunting during the day, the scene was truly unbearable to look back on.

Although those days were hard, he had accumulated enough political capital. Moreover, the extremely boring life also made him pick up the enthusiasm he had when applying for military academy and delve into naval tactics textbooks. Led by Wen Desi, a group of former naval officers and naval enthusiasts in the Senate, considering that the new navy's weapons and tactics were different from the old timeline, used late 19th-century British and German naval materials as a blueprint to compile a *Naval Drill Manual* and *Naval Elementary Tactics Reader* as textbooks for training new naval officers.

Li Haiping was just a petty officer in the navigation department in the PLAN, completely different from authentic naval officers like Chen Haiyang and Ming Qiu. In a sense, apart from not getting seasick on board and being relatively familiar with naval terminology and shipboard conditions, he was actually no different from Senator naval officers of enthusiast backgrounds like Li Di. In terms of depth of understanding of naval tactics and strategy, he might not even compare to these armchair-strategist naval enthusiasts. Not to mention, regarding naval tactics and equipment characteristics of the sail and ironclad era, all former PLAN naval officers combined couldn't compare to Wen Desi—Director Wen's title of General Naval Advisor was not just "leader's vanity."

Having gained enough seniority at Changhua Fort, and with his remarks at the Second Plenary Session gradually forgotten by the "Democrats," Li Haiping returned safely to Lingao—just in time for the navy's shipbuilding and reorganization plan. Under Ming Qiu's suggestion, the navy began training mid-to-high-ranking naval officers from among the Senators, preparing commanders for the new 845 Improved and 901 types. As a "former professional naval serviceman," Li Haiping became a priority trainee for "fleet command personnel."

Now standing on the bridge, wearing the rank of Commander in the Navy, his Commodore's pennant flew from *Zhenyang*'s mast. Every time he looked up and saw this flag, Li Haiping couldn't help but be elated—in the Australian Song Navy, only four people had the right to fly a Commodore's flag, and he was one of them.

Fortunately, he didn't listen to Old Di's bewitchment back then to transfer to the Marines. If he really went to the Marines, under Shi Zhiqi's radiance now, he would at most be an obscure Marine company commander—just like Old Di.

He coughed with feigned majesty and issued an order: "Order all ships, prepare for combat. Strengthen observation!"

After issuing the order, he turned his telescope to the increasingly close Jeju Island.

Jeju Island's shape was very regular, almost an oval. Except for a few places, there was no broken and rugged coastline; terrain like bays and capes was very rare. Flat sandy beaches were everywhere. The center of the island was Hallasan, 1190 meters above sea level. The entire Jeju Island was a typical volcanic island.

Figuretively speaking, Jeju Island looked like lava squeezed out from Hallasan spread flat on the sea surface.

Although Jeju Island's latitude was equivalent to the Shandong Peninsula, because of the warm current passing through, it had a subtropical climate. Although it snowed in winter and the temperature dropped to 0 degrees, it was generally humid and warm.

Although the winter here was much colder than Kaohsiung, it was at least warmer than Shandong, and the distance to Longkou was much closer. An area of more than five hundred square kilometers was enough to accommodate a large population, and fresh water resources were also quite abundant. In the 1930s, under extremely underdeveloped conditions, the island maintained a population of nearly 200,000. In the 21st century, Jeju Island's resident population was 550,000. Not including the large floating population traveling to the island annually, the island's carrying capacity had great potential.

Jeju Island's subtropical climate with distinct seasons was much healthier for immigrants than the hot and humid southern Taiwan. Concentrating the sheltered refugees on Jeju Island would greatly reduce the chance of infectious disease outbreaks.

Although the agricultural conditions on the island were not very good, self-sufficiency for a population of tens of thousands was not a problem.

The decision to take Jeju Island back then was precisely based on considering it as a transit station for immigrants. Now the progress had been delayed by a month. Although the Forward Command did not send many telegrams to urge, Li Haiping still felt the responsibility was heavy and must complete the task of landing on Jeju and building refugee camps as quickly as possible.

The fleet's course pointed to Seongsan in the northeast of Jeju Island. Because Jeju Island was a volcanic island, there were no natural ports with very good conditions, especially poor shelter conditions. The best port was Jeju Port, which was also where the Joseon Dynasty's governance agency was located. The population was relatively dense, making it unsuitable as a starting base. The final designated landing site was chosen at Seongsan.

Although the port conditions at Seongsan were relatively average, the offshore Udo Island to the northeast and Seongsan to the southeast embraced the port. Not only could they shield against wind and waves, but placing forts on them could also control the entire port. The General Staff believed it was appropriate to set up the main military base here.

As the fleet sailed towards the east of Jeju Island, the lookout shouted: "Beacon fire!"

Even without the lookout's report, Li Haiping saw black smoke rising from the island. Black smoke rose from the small islands around Jeju Island, and then, black smoke also rose from the Seongsan direction on the east side of Jeju Island, going straight into the clouds.

Although the Great Library didn't find specific fortification measures of the Joseon Dynasty on Jeju Island from the materials, the *Haitian*'s reconnaissance voyage to Jeju Island a few months ago already knew that the Joseon Dynasty had set up beacon towers on the main island of Jeju and surrounding small islands, and there were also navy ships stationed: this place was only more than three hundred nautical miles from Japan, and historically it had been constantly attacked by Japanese pirates. Moreover, it was less than thirty years since the Imjin War, and the Joseon Dynasty still maintained strong wariness towards Japan. As the first line against Japan, the vigilance here was strict.

During *Haitian*'s reconnaissance voyage to Jeju Island, apart from discovering beacon fires alarming successively on various islands, no Joseon navy interception was seen. Therefore, it was judged that the Joseon navy forces near Jeju Island were very weak and unable to take the initiative to go out to sea to intercept. They mainly relied on defense troops on various islands holding their points, which wouldn't cause much hindrance to the landing operation.

Therefore, Li Haiping's order was simple: "Sail straight to Seongsan."

With modern charts and *Haitian*'s reconnaissance results, the fleet boldly passed safely through the islands and reef groups around Jeju Island, heading straight for Seongsan.

Soon, Seongsan appeared in Li Haiping's field of vision.

"It really looks like a huge fortress!"

Although Li Haiping had seen Seongsan's appearance in countless photos and video materials long ago, when it really appeared in front of the bow, he still marveled endlessly.

The entire Seongsan was a huge rock protruding high from the sea surface—just as its name implied, like a "city" (*Seong*). But it was much more magnificent than a real city.

The main altitude of Seongsan was 182 meters. The top was a huge crater. The crater was 600 meters in diameter and 90 meters deep. Like a huge saucer, the bottom was flat. The southeast and north sides of Seongsan were cliffs, and only the northwest side was a grassy ridge winding to connect with Jeju Island.

In the 21st century, this place was a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site and a famous tourist destination. Many Senators had been there—Li Haiping, because he always scoffed at the "Cosmic Empire" (Korea), had never set foot there.

Now he looked at the environment around Seongsan with the eyes of a naval officer.

Opposite Seongsan was Udo Island. A natural anchorage was formed between the middle. Setting up a fort in each of these two places could effectively guard the harbor. The disadvantage was that the anchorage area was limited, and the sheltered range was not large. It could only moor a small number of ships. Overall berthing and shelter conditions were not good.

Li Haiping shook his head: "A bit of a pity, this place can't anchor a fleet."

In terms of Jeju Island's geographical location, this shortcoming seriously affected its strategic value.

Jeju Island fell within the range of typhoon influence and was known for "strong winds." The island lacked good natural sheltered harbors, making it difficult for large fleets to anchor safely, which was why the Navy's Jeju landing was chosen to start in late autumn and early winter.

Since conditions were limited, excessive military construction here became unnecessary. It seemed the General Staff's cancellation of the plan to build forts on Seongsan and Udo Island made sense.

In the original plan, the Navy prepared to build coastal forts on top of Seongsan and install heavy fortress artillery. However, after evaluating the terrain and Joseon's military potential, the General Staff believed there was no such necessity for the time being—and whether there would be such necessity in the future was also doubtful. The conclusion was to establish a fortified camp on top of Seongsan, set up observation posts to monitor the nearby sea areas and the eastern part of the whole island comprehensively. And build a lighthouse as a navigation marker.
