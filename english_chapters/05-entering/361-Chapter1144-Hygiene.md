# Chapter 1144 - Hygiene

"He's a clever and deft-handed boy," Cleadia said proudly. "He loves science and especially likes various novel devices. He's determined to become a figure like da Vinci." Saying this, she was a bit embarrassed. "You probably don't know da Vinci..."

"Of course I know him," Dr. Zhong smiled. "Rather, few people in Europe probably know him anymore."

"Yes." Cleadia was surprised. Although da Vinci enjoyed high repute while alive, he quickly fell into obscurity after death, only being "rediscovered" in modern times. Few remembered him in the 17th century.

Thus Westerly and Cleadia helped work on the clock tower. When free, Zhong Xiaoying taught them Mandarin, and sometimes they went on outings together—friendship among the three teenagers grew daily.

Around ten days passed. One evening, Cleadia was writing her daily observations with a quill pen as usual. Halfway through, her travel ink supply ran out. Westerly, having worked all day, was already dead asleep. Unwilling to disturb him, Cleadia went to find Zhong Xiaoying on the same floor to ask for ink—light was still showing through her door crack.

Zhong Xiaoying was lying on her bed doing math homework left by Zhong Lishi—it was hard for her; she was stuck and bored. seeing Cleadia come to find her, she was overjoyed.

The two chatted with gestures for a while—Zhong Xiaoying tried to get Cleadia to help with the math problems. But Cleadia didn't recognize any Chinese characters and was completely clueless about modern mathematical symbols.

However, Cleadia noticed her writing pen was very special. That pen had a metal nib, and she hadn't seen Zhong Xiaoying dip for ink in a long time.

Cleadia asked curiously, "Your pen is truly peculiar; does its ink never run out?"

"Not exactly..." Zhong Xiaoying opened the pen cap, revealing the ink reservoir inside. "This is called a 'fountain pen.' Inside is a glass tube ink reservoir; inside the tube is a capillary feed made of lacquer flakes with many crevices to hold ink. My father's fountain pen uses a rubber sac, which works better, but alas rubber is too expensive. Mine is a cheaper type."

Zhong Xiaoying explained for a long time before Cleadia understood what "rubber" was. She immediately remembered: "I know; last year your people went to Batavia and helped the Company plant trees—that was this rubber."

"Yes, that tree only grows well in the tropics."

"This pen is wonderful; are they sold here?"

"Unfortunately they were just developed and haven't entered production. But Father said there will be a fountain pen factory in a while."

Seeing Cleadia liked it, Zhong Xiaoying took a new pen recently produced by the Science Department from her drawer and gave it to Cleadia: "For you. I modified the nib; it writes quite well. But you can only use Lingao-produced ink, or it will clog. I'll give you a big bottle of ink too."

"Thank you so much." Cleadia was delighted with this gift, examining it against her chest for a good while. "Can I give it to Westerly?"

"Of course." Seeing her affection for her brother, Zhong Xiaoying sighed involuntarily.

"What? Do you have no siblings?"

"I once did. They and my parents are all dead."

"Dead? Isn't Dr. Zhong your father?"

"No, he's my adoptive father." Zhong Xiaoying didn't want to mention past sorrows, turning away to wipe a tear from the corner of her eye. "The Committee saved me from a hell worse than death; they are my great benefactors too."

"So that's it. No wonder you don't look alike at all."

Zhong Xiaoying giggled. "Of course we don't look alike—I was originally a maid for Dr. Zhong, later he adopted me."

---

Cleadia was astonished. This seemed incredible to Europeans of that time—even in the Seven Provinces Republic, which claimed to be most "equal" and "enlightened."

Zhong Xiaoying didn't want to dwell on the past. She looked at Cleadia. "You're wearing too much—aren't you hot?"

Cleadia wore a linen chemise and tight stays. To Zhong Xiaoying, wearing only a nightgown made of high-count linen from Lingao, this looked both uncomfortable and hot. Besides, her forehead was covered in sweat beads.

"I also feel a bit hot, especially the stays; they often make me feel breathless—probably due to the hot weather."

"I think you should change clothes. Especially your tight stays—Honorable Father said they affect health." Zhong Xiaoying climbed off the bed and opened her luggage trunk.

Among the naturalized citizen class, "Chiefs' maids" were the most consumptive class—though the General Office paid them no wages, a significant portion of Committee members' monthly income was spent on them. One could say maids drove Committee consumption.

Zhong Xiaoying was an adopted daughter, moving a step further in consumption level. Zhong Lishi was willing to spend money on her, so her wardrobe was quite substantial.

Zhong Xiaoying took out a loose nightgown and a cotton brassiere.

"All new, never worn," Zhong Xiaoying said. "I see your figure is about the same as mine; they should fit."

Cleadia looked curiously at the brassiere—she'd never seen such underwear. She was eager to try, immediately starting to untie the stay laces. Zhong Xiaoying helped.

Once the stays were undone, revealing her neck, Zhong Xiaoying was shocked: the neck below Cleadia's tender white face was actually dark gray! That level of filth meant she hadn't bathed for at least a few months.

Cleadia noticed her surprise. "What's wrong?"

"Cleadia, you haven't bathed in a long time, have you?" Zhong Xiaoying said in amazement.

"Not since leaving Batavia. What about it?" Cleadia dismissed it. "I wash face, hands, and feet every day; they are very clean. And I change clothes daily."

"But you don't bathe—how is changing clothes enough?" Zhong Xiaoying was astonished at her theory. Even when her family declined, Zhong Xiaoying didn't have the Committee members' hygiene habits of bathing and changing daily, but she used water every day. In summer she showered every three or four days; less in winter, but at least once a month. She'd never heard of not bathing for months and just changing clothes.

Zhong Xiaoying was puzzled. "Does the trading house not have good bathrooms? Hot and cold water is so convenient."

"My clothes are tidy, face and limbs very clean; isn't that enough?" Cleadia said. "Besides, priests and doctors say bathing often leads to various diseases."

Hearing this, Zhong Xiaoying got anxious, immediately lecturing her on "hygiene" principles, talking about "the significance of maintaining cleanliness for female physiological health." Though Cleadia didn't understand most of it, she grasped the general meaning: her new friend wanted her to bathe.

"But I can't bathe these few days," Cleadia said hesitantly.

"Why?"

"Because..." Cleadia's face reddened, shyly unwilling to continue. Zhong Xiaoying suddenly understood; no wonder Cleadia's behavior had been especially "refined" these days.

"So that's it." She also blushed slightly. "You can take a shower." Saying this, she got off the bed again and took a paper box from the trunk.

The box was sealed, printed with the line: "Women's Hygiene Care Kit A," followed by small print: "Ministry of Health Pharmaceutical and Sanitary Materials General Factory." Then Arabic numerals for the date.

Inside were women's hygiene products recently mass-produced by the Ministry of Health: sanitized toilet paper and cotton gauze belts, plus a bar of disinfectant soap.

"This is another gift for you," Zhong Xiaoying said somewhat shyly.

(About Dutch hygiene habits, the English said: their bodies are dirtier than their houses and streets. Many 17th-century visitors noticed a peculiarity: Dutch cities and homes were extremely clean, but their personal hygiene was very poor.

17th-century Dutch had no bathing habit; middle and upper classes washed hands, feet, and face daily, nothing more. In the early 17th century, the entire Netherlands had only one public bathhouse.

Considering the Dutch were actually Germans, and German lack of hygiene had been famous in Europe since the Middle Ages.)
