# Chapter 1161 - The Medical Tour

Wei Bachi's report on the Vestreling incident took a long time to write. He spent considerable mental effort on how to phrase things. He crossed out and revised repeatedly, deeply regretting that he hadn't taken a course in official document writing or media writing back in his university days.

This incident, though not particularly serious in terms of its consequences, left the Senate feeling somewhat embarrassed. Compared to Old Feng at Jeju Island who had "masterminded the crushing of a counter-revolutionary riot" and had the glorious deeds of the Kim O-sun siblings to show for it, Wei Bachi's side really had no bright spots worth highlighting.

After several drafts, Wei Bachi finally decided to adopt the posture of "deep self-criticism." Not only would he not avoid problems, he would emphasize them—whatever thorns those "devils" in the Senate liked to pick, he would point out himself first, then add a "profound self-examination." This would fully "correct his attitude."

After all, he had personally overseen the construction of Kaohsiung, and so far the city was operating normally—whether in population transfer, urban construction, or economic conditions. He felt that unlike some people in the Senate who would kick even when nothing was wrong, the Executive Committee still valued administrative continuity and stability—especially during this pioneering development phase.

"At worst I'll be roasted at a hearing—even Han Xin once suffered the humiliation of crawling between someone's legs," Wei Bachi consoled himself as he wrote.

But merely having a "good attitude" wasn't enough. The reason Feng Zongze had eventually gotten through was inseparable from his major initiatives in horse administration, "land reform," and standardized village construction. He had fully demonstrated his potential as a "capable official." Wei Bachi needed to put on a good show too.

The next day, the "Kaohsiung Second Five-Year Plan" display board in Wei Bachi's office silently disappeared, replaced by another board labeled "Kaohsiung Agricultural Land Development Plan."

Indeed, after several hours of thought, Wei Bachi had decided to direct his merit-building efforts toward the agricultural issues that the Senate cared about most and found most troublesome.

"China's problems, in the final analysis, are food problems," Wei Bachi said, looking at the fruits of his all-night effort with his personal secretary.

Neither the Planning Commission nor the Agricultural Committee had given him a set reclamation target. Wei Bachi had originally set his own goal at thirty thousand mu, but now he decided to triple that figure: reclaim one hundred thousand mu within one year.

Wei Bachi wasn't making this decision arbitrarily. In the previous phase, both the reclamation work and the sanitary belt clearing in the Kaohsiung area had progressed fairly smoothly. Though the human cost was high—the dead were all slaves, with minimal losses among refugees. Moreover, the efficiency of the reclamation work had far exceeded his expectations.

He currently had ten thousand permanent residents under his command, plus thirty thousand refugees—even if half of those refugees were still recovering and couldn't be worked at full capacity, they could still do at least some light labor.

Meanwhile, on the emerald waves rolling from west to east across the Qiongzhou Strait, a black paddle steamer sailed steadily forward, belching clouds of steam and smoke while spreading its sails, cutting through the waves at an impressive speed.

Though its speed already left all passing ships far behind, the black smoke and white steam puffing from its smokestack weren't dense, and the paddle wheel churning the water wasn't turning fast—indicating that the boiler and steam engine weren't operating at full capacity.

Flying from the mainmast, dancing in the wind, was the striking blue Morning Star flag.

This paddle steamer, built entirely of teak, had a standard displacement of 500 tons—large enough to count as a "big ship" along China's 17th-century coast.

Unlike other vessels under the Senate's flag with their standard coloring of light black, this ship retained the original color and grain of its teak wood. No gun ports lined its deck. It lacked the austere exterior typical of Senate vessels; instead, many of its details featured elaborate decorative elements. The most eye-catching ornament was an octopus figurehead at the bow. The palace-lantern design on the poop deck added Chinese flair, creating an overall impression of "peace."

This was the "yacht" built by the Lingao Shipyard for the Guangzhou Station—the *Octopus*. It was specifically designed for Master Guo's "lavish lifestyle" in Guangzhou and to demonstrate the Senate's power.

Because the vessel needed to navigate inland waterways, the *Octopus* couldn't be too large. To reduce the workload, it was designed and built based on the 621-class paddle tug ship that Lingao had already been producing at 500 tons. Since it would mainly operate in rivers and the Pearl River estuary, high speed wasn't required, so a smaller engine was installed to reduce the volume of the boiler, steam engine, and coal bunker.

Aboard this vessel—luxurious by contemporary standards—was the medical touring group led by Health People's Commissar Shi Niaoren.

To expand the Senate's influence across Hainan Island and Guangdong, the Health People's Committee had been organizing mobile medical teams since the beginning of the year. Composed of several Elders from the health department and outstanding naturalized citizens, they had begun conducting medical tours throughout Qiongzhou Prefecture's counties.

The tour covered the entire Hainan Island region, including Leizhou and Guangzhou. Leizhou needed no explanation; through the tireless infiltration of the Leizhou Station, Xuwen and Haikang counties had already been "Lingao-ized." The reason for including Guangzhou was primarily to prepare for the planned campaign against the Pearl River Delta region during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

Guangzhou was a continuation of this grand tour and its final stop. After the Battle of Chengmai, the Senate's advantages in medicine had spread throughout Guangdong via the wounded Ming soldiers who had received treatment and the spectators who had witnessed the battlefield.
