# Chapter 1176 - The Tsushima Domain

Ping Qiusheng envisioned ships returning from Japan could first sail to Jeju Island, load up Korean ginseng there, then return to Shanghai, sell the ginseng, and load up local cloth, silk, and daily goods to ship back to Japan for sale.

Whether reality would match his vision remained to be proven through practice. The most crucial end of Japan trade—the Shanghai side—still heavily depended on Zhao Yingong's work. After all, ships, cargo sources, and docks all needed his organization. Before departing, Ping Qiusheng had already written a long letter to be delivered by special messenger to the Hangzhou Station.

Though he and Old Zhao weren't particularly close, surely Zhao wouldn't pass up this merit-earning opportunity.

But Ping Qiusheng couldn't wait for the Shanghai side to get organized. He decided to temporarily set aside his "five-island strategy" and start with the most convenient Tsushima route.

The Sō clan on Tsushima Island, situated between the Japanese archipelago and the Korean peninsula, had a nominal territorial yield of 100,000 koku. But in reality, Tsushima's land was small; counting their enclaves, grain production didn't even reach 20,000 koku. A large portion of that nominal 100,000 koku actually came from economic income from trade with Korea.

Throughout the Tokugawa period, although Japan followed a policy of national isolation and opened only Nagasaki as a port, Tsushima had always been permitted to conduct trade with Korea and Qing China. This trade channel theoretically had no connection to the shogunate and few restrictions—a convenient channel that could be used immediately.

The Sō clan had proved themselves consummate survivors in Japanese Warring States history. During Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Korean invasion, clan head Sō Yoshitoshi and his father-in-law Konishi Yukinaga had played both sides, bearing undeniable responsibility for the failure of the first peace negotiations and the second invasion. In the end, Hideyoshi's death spared them from punishment.

Come the Battle of Sekigahara, the Sō clan had joined the Western Army alongside Konishi Yukinaga. Neither the Toyotomi generals who had defected to Tokugawa's side, nor their Western Army allies Ishida Mitsunari and various western daimyō, had looked kindly on the Sō clan. Yet when the Western Army lost and Ishida and Konishi were beheaded, Sō Yoshitoshi was instead pardoned by Tokugawa Ieyasu, and after the Osaka Campaign received promises that his domain would never be reduced or abolished. His fortune far exceeded that of turncoats like Kobayakawa Hideaki.

Of course, in a sense, the Sō clan's good luck might have had something to do with their domain's insignificance. For rulers and powerful daimyō on Japan's main islands, Tsushima was just a poor, distant island. Much like daimyō on Hokkaido—as long as they kowtowed and swore loyalty promptly, no general thought to deal with them.

But making Tsushima submit would still require some work. Historically, after Japan's failed Korean invasion, the Sō clan had privately negotiated peace with Korea—technically a treasonous act, but with the Toyotomi regime's collapse and Tokugawa's rise, and since Tokugawa Ieyasu hadn't participated in the Korean invasion and showed no enthusiasm for it, the Sō's peace negotiations became a merit instead.

In 1607, the Tsushima domain signed another trade agreement with Korea. Relations between Tsushima and Korea were quite good: Tsushima nominally submitted to the Yi Dynasty and was considered one of its vassal domains, giving it the legal basis to dispatch officials to the Japanese outpost in Busan for governance. Trade between the two was quite frequent.

Ping Qiusheng knew this trade was essentially one-sided. Korean merchant groups generally didn't send ships to Japan; it was mainly Tsushima merchants who sent ships to Korea for trade. So counting on Korean ships wasn't an option.

Moreover, Japan-Korea trade consisted mainly of Chinese goods transshipped through Korea, plus Korean handicrafts, medicinals, and furs—none of which were Jeju's main products. So Tsushima ships might come to Jeju only once every few years.

To sit on Jeju waiting for Japanese trading ships would mean waiting who knows how many years.

The first order of business was getting Tsushima ships to come over. With the current Song-Australian naval power in the Yellow Sea, making any ship come or not come was a matter of will.

So before Ping Qiusheng's departure, Si Kaide had gone to the Naval Department, requesting they order the Jeju detachment to intercept Tsushima trade ships heading to Korea in batches and capture the vessels. The orders specifically emphasized that captured Tsushima merchants and Sō clan retainers should be released; ordinary crew and passengers who laid down their weapons should also be treated well. Ships and cargo would be held on Jeju pending disposition.

Inspecting and capturing ships was basic naval work, so by the time Ping Qiusheng reached Jeju, the Sō clan had already lost three or four ships. By now, everyone in the Tsushima domain's administrative capital should know that a band of major pirates was intercepting their vessels.

As the domain's largest source of revenue, they couldn't possibly not come to resolve this matter—a point both Si Kaide and Ping Qiusheng were quite certain of.
