# Chapter 1135 - Guo Huaiyi

Zheng Zhilong, however, placed little importance on Taiwan. Since gaining control of Anping, he had established a direct trade route to Japan and saw little value in Taiwan as a waystation. Beyond encouraging migration from southern Fujian, he had devoted scant thought to increasing actual control over the island—nor, in truth, did he possess the resources to do so.

Lacking support from the mainland, Guo Huaiyi was forced to organize defense on his own. His approach was pragmatic: on major matters, he submitted to the Dutch. He paid head taxes, provided corvée labor, and supplied the Dutch with Taiwanese trade goods—particularly deerskins, which mostly came from hunters among the southern Fujian migrants or from small traders brave enough to deal with the natives. This cooperation made the Dutch view the Fujian migrants in Tainan as "useful subjects" worthy of military protection. Successive *opperhoofd* governors had spared no effort in subduing the natives, largely to ensure the migrants' working safety.

Of course, the Dutch themselves commanded limited strength, sometimes barely able to protect their own interests. So for smaller matters, Guo Huaiyi encouraged each village to form militias for self-defense. The Fujianese who crossed to Taiwan came overwhelmingly from southern Fujian, a region already marked by intense regional loyalties. Moreover, migrants often relocated in clan units, naturally forming villages centered on kinship and common origin. Local strongmen inevitably emerged.

This pattern of southern Fujian strongman groups dominating local society would persist even after the Qing recovery of Taiwan—in some ways more severely than on the mainland. Compounded by serious malaria, which killed outside officials and runners before they could complete their terms, the one prefecture and two counties the Qing eventually established in Taiwan exercised virtually no grassroots control. Even sending functionaries to the countryside on official business carried personal danger. Lin Shuangwen, who would later rise in rebellion during the Qianlong era, came from precisely this milieu.

Guo Huaiyi led this alliance of strongmen. Li Siya understood clearly that his position in the "Great Company" mirrored Zheng Zhilong's: commanding great prestige and considerable power, but lacking absolute authority.

Therefore, she resolved to say as little as possible to Guo Huaiyi, speaking only about matters directly relevant to the mission.

She presented Zheng Zhifeng's token. Guo Huaiyi studied it for a long moment, then invited her to the inner courtyard for tea. The secret discussion began.

Guo Huaiyi already knew her purpose. A messenger had delivered Zheng Zhifeng's letter several days earlier. He had been awaiting her arrival.

What Li Siya most wanted to know was the Australians' precise situation in Taiwan. Zheng Zhifeng had told her only that the Australians had transported large numbers of migrants to the Takau area and were constructing castle fortifications on a grand scale.

"Miss," Guo Huaiyi mused for a moment, "I should take you to see the area personally. You need to observe for yourself. Otherwise, mere words would scarcely do it justice."

Li Siya found this reasonable—she would need firsthand reconnaissance before formulating concrete plans. "Very well. I would be grateful if you could send capable guides."

"No trouble—easy to arrange." Guo Huaiyi explained that the southern Fujian migrants had recently established considerable contact with the Australians in Takau. The two sides traded frequently, and some people had simply relocated there. Finding reliable, knowledgeable guides would be straightforward.

"What is the Dutch attitude toward the Australians?" This was Li Siya's primary concern.

"The Governor is deeply troubled," Guo Huaiyi replied. "One might say the matter keeps him awake at night."

Hans Putmans was extremely worried about Australian activities in Takau. First was their terrifying logistical capability. In less than half a year, they had transported forty thousand migrants to the area. To appreciate this scale: the southern Fujian migration that had begun in Yan Siqi's era and continued for over a decade had not delivered this many people. And accompanying the migrants came a ceaseless flow of building materials and massive quantities of supplies.

The Dutch had gone through five governors in Taiwan before finally constructing a proper castle. But from the moment they landed, the Australians had erected a fortress larger than Fort Zeelandia, completing eighty percent of the work in less than half a year. Simultaneously, they had built docks, dredged the harbor, and extensively cultivated wasteland.

Little wonder that Hans Putmans was losing sleep with such terrifyingly efficient neighbors—possessing such maritime transport capacity—positioned just a few dozen leagues away.

"Just over ten days ago, the Governor invited us to a meeting at the trading post to warn us about the Australians," Guo Huaiyi said with a knowing smile.

"Oh? What did he say?"

"The usual platitudes—be careful, best not to have much contact with the Australians, that sort of thing." Guo Huaiyi shrugged. "The Dutch fear the Australians will pull us over to their side. Then there would be no one to work for them, collect deerskins, or pay head taxes."

"Do the Australians have such intentions?"

Guo Huaiyi shook his head. "No. They have never sent anyone to recruit us. They seem completely uninterested in our people." A glint of amusement entered his eye. "On the contrary, quite a few of our folk have been attracted there—some for trade, some for work, and some have simply relocated."

"So the Australians in Takau operate entirely openly?"

"Correct. Anyone who wishes may go there to work, trade, or even settle. They are quite free about it—people come and go as they please. I hear many Japanese from Tayouan have gone over as well."

"The Japanese?" Li Siya was puzzled. "Why would they go?"

"Because Hans Putmans forbids the Japanese from worshipping according to Jesuit rituals—they must pray according to Dutch Reformed rites. The Japanese have always resented this. Now the Australians have Jesuit missionaries and even a small chapel. Many Japanese have made the move."

"Is that so!" Li Siya understood the Governor's anxiety more clearly now. The Japanese were important to the Dutch presence in Tayouan. Though they did not play as economically vital a role as the southern Fujian migrants, they constituted an important source of sailors and soldiers for Dutch operations.

And now the Australians had extended their reach here. These Australians were certainly skilled at poaching talent.

Li Siya felt a strengthening urge to encounter the Australians again.

The intelligence she had gathered was highly satisfactory: the Dutch in Tayouan were filled with worry and fear toward the Australians. Moreover, she knew that since the East India Company had established trading posts in both Hong Kong and Hainan, large quantities of Chinese goods were being transshipped from Guangdong, severely impacting Tayouan's trade.

The Company had originally established its trading post in Taiwan specifically for China trade procurement—enduring unreliable partners, various inconveniences, and constant losses. The Company needed to attract Chinese merchants to sell the goods it urgently required.

But now, Hong Kong and Sanya could meet most of the Company's needs. Were it not for Tayouan's advantage in procuring Fujian export porcelain and indigo nearby, and its role as a base for the Japan trade, the post would have no value at all. One could readily imagine the mood of a Governor whose importance declined by the month.

Professionally and personally, Hans Putmans could have no warm feelings toward the Australians. That made him easy to manipulate.

As for the Australians themselves—Li Siya believed that, as a rising maritime power, they could hardly feel benevolent toward the Dutch. At bottom, their current trade cooperation was purely transactional, devoid of trust.

Perhaps internally, both sides harbored intentions to fire upon each other, to devastate or even destroy their rival in a single blow. Li Siya had served the East India Company and spied upon the Australians; she understood Dutch thinking very well.

"Are there any important Company figures in Tayouan Harbor at present?"

"I am not certain. I don't visit Tayouan often." Guo Huaiyi stroked his chin. "If you wish, I'll have someone investigate tomorrow."

"Good. Also, if possible, I would like to visit Tayouan personally first."

Guo Huaiyi studied her and spoke frankly: "Forgive my directness, but Miss Li is rather conspicuous..."

In a place like Taiwan, ordinary women appearing in public was unremarkable—especially southern Fujian women, who often served as important laborers. The problem was that Li Siya was of mixed Chinese-Portuguese heritage, with striking features, and clearly a woman of wealth at first glance.

Li Siya smiled. "Don't worry. I shall apply some makeup. I guarantee no one will recognize my face."
