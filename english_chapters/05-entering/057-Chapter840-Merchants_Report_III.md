# Chapter 840: Merchant's Report (III)

Skaed avoided the Senate's artillery fire and, incidentally, also left the Dutch whose quarantine had already expired waiting an extra ten or so days. When he returned from Hongji, he already had a thick stack of plans for accelerating Hongji's development and strengthening local defense forces in hand. Relying on submitting this plan to the Executive Committee and Senate for review, he claimed he needed to "fully engage in negotiations with the Dutch" and went into hiding again.

Reinforcing Hongji and expanding Hongji Station's scale—the Department of Colonization and Trade only had the power to make recommendations and propose a plan. Matters involving material allocation, personnel deployment, and military mobilization still needed to be specifically discussed by the Executive Committee before they could be implemented. Skaed wasn't particularly concerned about bombardment from the Senate side: he had sufficient evidence to prove that Hongji's inadequate equipment was entirely due to "limited national strength." If you wanted to talk about important targets being inadequately defended, Sanya, given its importance and investment amount, was especially inadequately defended. He simply didn't want to deal with the Standing Committee because he felt it was a waste of time. Many people in the Senate Standing Committee, according to him: "The professionals are too professional, and the amateurs are too amateur"—all were difficult to deal with.

"Alright, we need to find a few people who understand German," Skaed said to himself in his office. "Dutch is a minor language after all." Dutch, commonly called Low German, wasn't very different from German. So the Dutch East India Company employed a large number of Germans. Skaed thought there were quite a few Senators who understood German, and most were affiliated with the Department of Colonization and Trade.

**Second Report from Junior Merchant Van der Lanthroon of the Dutch East India Company ship *Magdeburg* to Governor-General De Carpentier of Batavia**

Respected Excellency:

After experiencing a quarantine period of more than twenty days, we were finally permitted to go ashore. Thanks be to God, no one died while we were on the ship. Everyone is very healthy.

Originally, we should have ended quarantine at the end of February, but when it expired, the port officials informed us that a high official who was to receive us—they call him an "Executive"—was currently not in Lingao, so we stayed on the ship for another week.

We discovered that the Australians, like us, use the concept of "week." When their personnel boarded the ship to talk with us, they often mentioned "what day of the week" and "next week." They also mentioned "Sunday."

However, an official sent us a document permitting us to leave the ship. With this document, crew members could go ashore and stay in lodgings on land. The sailors and soldiers were very happy to be able to go ashore. I ordered the Captain to leave a third of the sailors and soldiers on the ship and promised them they would rotate every three days thereafter.

The Executive had orders for the port officials, including ordering him to supply us with all our needs without shortage, and ordering our personnel not to leave the port area without written permission.

The port officials issued a hard paper card to everyone going ashore. The card was inscribed with their name, the ship they belonged to, and their port of departure. And everyone was required to put their fingerprint on the card. Your Excellency surely knows: this practice of fingerprinting is very popular among the Chinese and seems to be a sign of their credit.

When we went ashore, the common people and workers in the port area crowded along the roadside to watch us. Some even climbed onto cranes. The large crowd watching made us feel quite troubled. The officials noticed this and dispatched guards to escort us. We left the wharf and were immediately taken to a building not far from the wharf.

This building was very large. It was said to be specially intended for receiving sailors. The building was a special kind of longhouse. There were many rows of such longhouses in the courtyard. Each longhouse had rows of double-tiered bunks. One building could house 40 people or even more—some longhouses were two stories.

We, as senior crew, were separately housed in a courtyard where there were similar two-story buildings, constructed of brick and tile like the longhouses but more exquisitely arranged inside. Each room was furnished with various furniture. As for whether each room slept one or three people was entirely up to us; they had rooms with different numbers of beds. Up to 4 people could sleep in one.

Whether ordinary sailors' longhouses or the small buildings we lived in, the buildings were all very clean and tidy. There was no bedding on the beds, but there were grass mats and straw-woven pillows—which were sufficient in Lingao's climate. Every building was equipped with toilets. The building manager strictly warned us that any defecating or urinating anywhere would be subject to heavy fines and other punishments. For this, I had to communicate with the purser on the ship and ask him to strictly manage the conduct of the sailors and soldiers—you know most of them are German.*

The sailors' lodge had a cafeteria supplying cooked meals. There was also a large store here, supplying various commodities specifically for sailors and fishermen stopping here to purchase.

The Australians seem less hospitable than the Chinese. The Xibanks and some others said that every time they went to the Chinese coast, as long as they claimed to be on "tribute" missions, they could receive official hospitality. But here among the Australians, all supplied items, from lodging to food, had to be paid for. However, the prices were acceptable.

We learned that this place is called "Bopu"—we were notified that we could move freely within Bopu town. Those going out must return to the lodge before 9 PM. But those places listed as "restricted areas" could not be entered. Overall, the Australians placed few restrictions on us. Besides allowing us to move freely in Bopu, they placed no other restrictions on the coins and other items we carried—only reminding us that shopping required exchanging for local currency first. Carrying weapons was prohibited. Additionally, he required sailors and soldiers to swear to respect the local laws before going out.

A piercing whistle sounded throughout the town every hour—the sound was so loud it could be heard throughout the entire town. Among these, the whistles in the morning, noon, and evening lasted a long time. The Australians used this timekeeping system very proficiently, so that everyone could know the current time. The Australians' work operated strictly according to the clock. After living together with them for just one day, one could roughly know what they would do the next day.

After all personnel settled down at the sailors' lodge, the person responsible for receiving us—the one they call Trade Minister—wanted to meet with us. To discuss, we three decided to go together for the meeting.

On the morning of March 1st, we washed up early and changed into our best formal clothes. In addition to Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Leibtrini, we each brought an attendant and carried relevant gifts.

Led by the young official sent from the "Trade Ministry," we came to the main street. A very beautiful four-wheeled carriage was already prepared there! Yes, a carriage—this was the most surprising thing for me. In all of East Asia, I don't know where else one could see such a light and beautiful carriage. Even in Macau or Batavia, such a type of vehicle couldn't be found. I believe even in Europe, similar vehicles cannot be found. This was truly an exquisite work of art! No, calling it an exquisite work of art does not mean it was ornately decorated or finely carved; on the contrary, the carriage had almost no decoration or painting. The body was black. Besides the glass embedded in the car door and a pair of beautiful carriage lamps, there was nothing worth mentioning as decoration. But the size of the entire body, the structure, and the proportionately balanced proportions of every part on it, the perfection of the structure, all gave an incomparably powerful impact. Your Excellency, please forgive me for being unable to describe such feelings in words.

The carriage passed through Bopu town and headed to the town they call "Bairencheng." That is the center of Australian rule. Bopu town is a very prosperous small town with many houses, worthy of being called a thriving city. We could see there were a large number of chimneys, astonishingly tall, each chimney emitting black and white smoke. The air had a strong, pungent smell. Along the way, we saw a majestic castle—although it wasn't on the street we passed, it was entirely built of red bricks, with tall towers and gun platforms. There, white and black smoke was also rising, and from time to time came loud metallic clanging sounds. I asked the accompanying official what that place was, and he refused to answer my question. I believe this should be the Australians' smelting plant, arsenal, or mint. If true, the Australians have invested a great deal of capital here.

The road from Bopu to Bairencheng was built along a large river. But this river channel was currently in a half-dried state. The Australians seemed to be conducting some kind of dredging and construction work on this channel. The water volume in the channel was low and smelly. The road was well-constructed, paved with a black gravel. The carriage rode on it without feeling any bumps at all. Along the road were carefully cultivated lands. The land was all carefully tended, with not an inch of land uncultivated or unplanted with crops. The fields, like many places in Tuscany, had perfect canals, dams, and waterwheels built to fully irrigate the soil. This irrigation project was so ingenious that Mr. Leibtrini praised it endlessly.

Like in Batavia, this place could be cultivated year-round. The fields had already been planted with green rice seedlings, or vegetables. The slopes where rice could not be grown were planted with various crops and fruit trees we didn't recognize. Even along the roadside, many coconut saplings had been planted.

What surprised us most were some things of unknown purpose by the roadside: some completely lifeless wooden poles, painted pitch black. The poles stood in rows along the roadside like roadside trees, connected to each other by black iron wire. On each pole were also fixed some bottles made of glass.

The three of us discussed the purpose of these poles and reached no conclusion at all—none of us had ever seen such a thing. We asked the accompanying official and once again received a silent answer.

*Note: Germans at that time were famously unhygienic in Europe.*
