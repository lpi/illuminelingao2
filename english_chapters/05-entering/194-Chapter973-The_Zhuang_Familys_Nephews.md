# Chapter 973 - The Zhuang Family's Nephews

Before the several masters and young masters of the Zhuang household, Zhang Yingchen exercised even greater caution. He never mentioned his "powers" and avoided doctrinal matters entirely. Only when directly questioned would he briefly discuss some principles of his "New Daoism."

Zhang Yingchen understood that when dealing with such gentry and scholars, one couldn't rely on a few demonstrations of "powers" to convince them to convert, as one might with common folk. Traditional Chinese intellectuals, following Confucius's example of refusing to speak of the strange, the supernatural, or divine beings, could be considered a kind of atheist in practice.

Therefore, when proselytizing to Zhuang Qian and others, he never forced the issue. Instead, he discussed matters as one would discuss scholarship, treating their questions with an exploratory attitude.

This approach indeed earned him the respect of the Zhuang family's several masters. Moreover, the New Daoist system he had developed genuinely possessed some outstanding qualities.

When Zhang Yingchen had been developing this system back in Lingao, he had understood clearly that for his New Daoism to carve out a path among the many folk religions proliferating in the late Ming—and furthermore to absorb and incorporate the Northern and Southern sects of orthodox Daoism—mature religious thought and scriptures were essential. Even the Nanwuliang Sect he had just contended with possessed two scriptures of its own.

As for those folk secret societies that jumbled Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism with popular legends—though they had the advantage of accessibility for lower-class audiences, in the eyes of middle and upper-class elites they appeared vulgar and shallow, inspiring contempt. Though the elites feared the secret societies' power and "sorcery," they still looked down on them. So when Zhang Yingchen had originally developed his New Daoist system, he had tried to use concepts from the existing Daoist system, drawing heavily on scriptures from the *Daozang*—though with certain alterations. Taking the Celestial Masters tradition as the foundation, he had incorporated doctrines from the Quanzhen school and other sects, and even introduced some concepts from modern scientific theory.

Of course, for now he couldn't yet remove his mystical mask—he still needed it for protection.

Throughout Yizhou, his reputation had suddenly grown enormously—or rather, previously he had merely been a "good person," but now he had abruptly become a "True One." All sorts of rumors about Zhang Yingchen's "boundless powers" began spreading wildly. Besides the refugees, people from far and near with sick family members converged on Dadianzhang. The sudden good fortune caught him off guard.

Yet this favorable situation was too good for Zhang Yingchen to abandon—now was exactly the right time to win hearts and build faith! He gathered his spirits and continued seeing patients half the day, every day. His original stock of medicines was essentially exhausted. Besides sending word to Linqing requesting they telegraph "headquarters" to urgently ship medicines from Guangdong, he relied mainly on materials that could be purchased locally. Not only were all three disciples fully occupied preparing medicines, but many Zhuang household servants also helped out. All medicine expenses were covered by the Zhuangs. He increasingly sensed the family's attitude toward him changing.

From Linqing came the personal files on the Zhuang family that he had requested from the Grand Library. It turned out the Zhuang family's various masters and young masters were quite remarkable.

He discovered that Zhuang Qian's decision to voluntarily retire shortly after leading troops to defend the capital in Chongzhen Year Two was connected to the political climate at court. In the early Chongzhen years, the purging of "Eunuch Party remnants" had proceeded quite vigorously. This man, during his career as an official, had once built a shrine for Wei Zhongxian. Even if he wasn't a member of the Eunuch Party, he must have had some connection to it.

Obviously, despite having a decent reputation as an official and demonstrating willingness to lead troops in defense of the realm during a crisis, this historical stain had forced him to withdraw from court voluntarily.

"No wonder he never speaks of court affairs in daily conversation, nor about his experiences as an official. So that's what it was!" Zhang Yingchen understood: he had "historical problems," so naturally he had to be very careful with his words after retirement. Especially since he had heard that Dongchang and the Jinyiwei had recently become more active.

Another person who piqued his interest was Zhuang Zheng, styled Diaozhi, who was Zhuang Qian's cousin. After the fall of the Ming, this man had gathered tens of thousands of followers and occupied Jiuxian Mountain in Zhucheng to resist the Qing. After failing, he had infiltrated Beijing alone, planning to assassinate high Manchu officials. He had even attempted to assassinate Dorgon—though unsuccessfully, he had managed to escape, demonstrating impressive skills and quick thinking.

"This man is too legendary. I really must get to know him." Zhang Yingchen was deeply interested. Unfortunately, this martial *xiucai* had been appointed Luokou Garrison Commander due to military merit during the Tianqi reign and was not presently at home.

Zhang Yingchen suspected this martial *xiucai* likely had prior connections with local forces at Jiuxian Mountain in Zhucheng—otherwise it was hard to imagine an outsider unfamiliar with the local terrain easily gathering tens of thousands of people to rebel on a mountaintop. The specifics warranted investigation.

He burned the secret letter, watching the gray-black paper ash completely disintegrate in the brazier before standing and dusting off his robes.

Outside the sun blazed, but inside the room large blocks of ice had been placed, emitting white vapor—for Yizhou, this was quite good treatment. Of course, it was rather inferior compared to the gentry household in Jiangnan where he had helped "compound great elixirs." Zhang Yingchen strolled to the veranda, about to check on his three disciples' medicine preparation, when a servant came to summon him to the main house.

Zhang Yingchen visited the main house often, but this time, unexpectedly, the servant didn't lead him inside. He was taken aback and quietly gripped the pistol at his waist.

"True One! Please forgive my presumption—" The servant smiled apologetically. "Just now it wasn't actually Master Zhuang who invited you—it was the young master from the Second Master's branch who wished to see you. He was afraid you might not be willing to see him..."

"All beings are equal. Why would this poor Daoist not be willing to see him?" Zhang Yingchen smiled and relaxed.

"How gracious of you, True One!" The servant said with a flattering smile. "It's like this—our Young Master Yongling is only eleven years old..."

"I see." Zhang Yingchen nodded. "No matter. Ambition knows no age. Gan Luo became prime minister at twelve. Your young master is surely a great talent as well."

"Some have indeed said so." Seeing Zhang Yingchen had no objections, the servant was delighted—his two hundred copper cash reward was secured. He immediately led him to a small courtyard.

Zhang Yingchen observed that flowers and trees flourished here amid elegant surroundings. The main hall was arranged with a desk and a tablet for Confucius—clearly this was the Zhuang family's study where the young members pursued their education.

He recalled that the Zhuang family's children and nephews were also quite distinguished. Several were *xiucai* or tribute students, and later participated in anti-Qing movements—all the type who could handle both pen and sword. This "Young Master Yongling" was probably Zhuang Yongling, Zhuang Qian's nephew. According to the files, he was born in 1620, making him exactly eleven now.

This Zhuang Yongling, styled Danian, courtesy name Fulai, would later pass the Shunzhi Year Eighteen *jinshi* examination, becoming the Zhuang clan's second *jinshi*.

Clearly this was a born scholar. Why did he suddenly want to see him?

Just as he was thinking, three youths around ten years old emerged to greet him. All were about a dozen years old, with handsome and spirited features. Their clothing was only slightly finer cotton cloth—very typical attire for gentry sons of a "farming and studying" household.

The Daoist Master's heart stirred. He raised his hands in greeting.

"True One!" The youth looked delighted. "I never expected you would actually come. Please forgive my presumption in sending an invitation under false pretenses."

"Why would this poor Daoist not come?" Zhang Yingchen smiled warmly and sincerely.

"Please come inside and take the seat of honor!"

Zhang Yingchen was led to the east warm chamber of the study. Since it was summer, the window shutters had been removed and green window gauze was pasted over the openings. Reflected through it, the thick shade of the courtyard trees created a very cool atmosphere.

Entering the room, they exchanged formal greetings again. Zhang Yingchen knew that Shandong scholars, influenced by the Kong family, were fond of elaborate ceremony even if their property was modest. "Ritual never offends"—so he went along with all the mutual courtesies.

Finally settling into seats and receiving tea from the study boy, Zhang Yingchen could breathe a sigh of relief—such elaborate ceremony was truly exhausting.

The three youths looked at each other but didn't speak. Zhang Yingchen found this rather strange. After a long while, Zhuang Yongling finally said haltingly:

"True One, we heard from the servants... they said you were bathed in thunderfire in the courtyard, yet suffered not the slightest harm..."

Zhang Yingchen listened while stroking his beard with a smile, thinking: "So that's what this is about." Young people were indeed curious and bold.

Seeing his expression showed no displeasure, several of them immediately grew bolder and began asking questions all at once:

"True One, were you undergoing a tribulation that night?"

"After passing the tribulation, shouldn't one ascend to heaven in broad daylight? Can you ride clouds and mist, True One?"

"True One, how can one be unharmed when thunderfire strikes? Every summer, people and cattle are struck dead by lightning..."

Zhang Yingchen didn't know whether to laugh or cry. These were supposedly scholars. Yet he also found them quite endearing—young people still retained their natural curiosity about everything, which was far more appealing than adults who pretended to understand what they didn't while affecting airs of composure.

He pondered for a moment, choosing not to answer their questions directly, but said:

"Do you know how the thunderfire in the sky comes about?"

This question stumped them. They were scholars who didn't believe tales of Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother, but neither Confucius, Mencius, nor any previous sage had addressed this matter. The three looked at each other in confusion.

Zhuang Yongling's eyes lit up. He asked: "Could it be that the True One knows?"

Zhang Yingchen nodded. "If this poor Daoist did not know, how could he bathe in thunder unharmed?"

Zhuang Yongling shot to his feet and bowed. "I humbly beseech the True One to teach me."

Zhang Yingchen smiled but didn't answer.

Zhuang Yongling was somewhat disappointed. He suddenly realized this matter must be a great secret of this "True One"—learning it wouldn't come easily.

Children of official families were either naive about the ways of the world or highly sophisticated. Zhuang Yongling was the latter. He thought: if this were an ordinary Daoist, he would probably just be looking for money, which would be simple. But since arriving at the residence, this Master Zhang had never taken a single coin from the household. He treated patients without charge and even gave away medicine for free. Clearly he wasn't after money.

He composed an expression of utmost sincerity: "This junior is foolish. I humbly ask the True One to enlighten me."
