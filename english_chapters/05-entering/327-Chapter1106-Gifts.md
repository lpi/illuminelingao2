# Chapter 1106 - Gifts

The original shop front had been redecorated in a modern style. Pak Deokhwan had initially found sitting in elevated chairs quite uncomfortable—as a government slave with nothing to his name, he had spent many years sitting on the floor. Armchairs and high tables existed but were seldom used; even the Yi royal family and the *yangban* usually sat on the floor in private settings.

"Little Pak," Feng Zongze settled into an armchair, "you need to keep a close eye on bow and arrow production. We're about to establish a foreign trade company soon. Bows and arrows are our island's flagship export product. As Superintendent, you must watch things carefully for me—don't let those merchants skim off the top."

"This humble servant understands. I shall certainly be the Committee's hands and feet!" Pak Deokhwan immediately declared his devoted loyalty.

"Mm." Feng Zongze had originally planned to speak with him about recent reports that he'd been spending too much time socializing with merchants at the pleasure houses. He ought to be more careful. But just then a messenger arrived to report that Zhu Mingxia had arrived.

"Mind your own work—be meticulous and don't give anyone an opening," Feng Zongze cautioned him with this single sentence. He still rather liked this young man: after all, Pak Deokhwan was the first native he had personally promoted—young, literate, and capable of getting things done. What Feng Zongze hadn't noticed was that Pak Deokhwan was also quite skilled at flattery—a fact that escaped his own perception.

He donned his cap and headed out. Pak Deokhwan hastily saw him off.

Once Feng Zongze had departed, Pak Deokhwan returned to his desk, feeling somewhat uneasy. Had someone been speaking ill of him behind his back? After much deliberation, his suspicions settled on Kim Yongjoo.

Kim Yongjoo was also a government slave—Pak Deokhwan had once considered marrying his daughter. Being from a hunter's family, Kim had been promoted to Military Affairs Clerk, specifically responsible for local security. Every day he led about a hundred local militiamen on patrols inside and outside the city, drilling them at the parade ground when not on patrol. These militia—wearing matching homespun cotton jackets with mandarin collars and broad hats, all sporting red armbands inscribed with "Security"—were uniformly dressed and well-armed, looking even more impressive than the former government soldiers had.

Kim Yongjoo, being from a hunting family, had eaten meat regularly—rare among Korean commoners of the time—and was noticeably tall and robust. Leading his men through the streets, he cut quite a figure. For a time, even Pak Deokhwan, the leading light among "Jeju's collaborators," regarded him with some wariness.

Pak Deokhwan had always looked down on Kim Yongjoo. Kim was not only a government slave but of *baekjeong* origin—the lowest caste of pariahs in Yi society, crude and ignorant. But now that Kim was Military Affairs Clerk and came regularly to inspect bow and arrow quality at Feng Zongze's behest, Pak Deokhwan made an effort to be cordial.

Though Kim Yongjoo never said anything directly to his face, whenever he came to inspect arrows, he always regarded Pak Deokhwan with suspicious eyes. Word had reached him that Kim publicly called him "forgetful of his roots." Once, arriving at a meeting, he had overheard Kim in the corridor remarking to another cadre about the "strange" nature of his new residence.

"That lowborn wretch!" The more he thought about it, the more convinced he became that Kim must be the one making trouble before the Officials. He cursed silently.

Evening approached. From outside came the sound of the evening cannon—fired at a set time each day from the gate of the Jeju Provincial Administration to announce the hour. Pak Deokhwan slung his satchel over his shoulder and left work directly.

His official hours ran from six in the morning to six in the evening. At first, he had been quite diligent—arriving early, leaving late, sometimes even sleeping at the office. Lately, his work enthusiasm had waned. Nightly socializing consumed his time and drained his energy; gradually, he had begun arriving late and leaving early. Tonight was one without any engagements, so he wanted to get home early and discuss his marriage prospects with his brother.

Though Pak Deokhwan frequented the pleasure houses, the matter of taking a wife remained much on his mind. Courtesans were base women, after all. Now that he was something of an official, he ought to properly marry a respectable woman to continue the Pak family line.

Originally, there had been no shortage of eligible young women in the city to consider, but since "becoming an official," Pak Deokhwan's standards had changed. Former government slaves, though now emancipated and raised in status, he still dismissed from consideration. As for the daughters of the island's few former officials, he frankly didn't dare approach them—fearing the "Officials'" displeasure. Thus his sights had settled on the daughters of merchants and landowners.

Several merchants and workshop owners had hinted at willingness to marry their daughters to him, but Pak Deokhwan found fault with each—one's daughter was too plain, another's family fortune too modest to provide a proper dowry. He had been picking and choosing until just a few days ago, when Huang Yunyu passed along extraordinary news: Lord Kim Man-il was very impressed with him and wished to give him one of his illegitimate daughters in marriage. This news thrilled him beyond measure—Lord Kim was the foremost figure on Jeju Island, holding a second-rank title! Even the Jeju Magistrate and Vice-Magistrate had treated him with utmost respect. As for his fortune—the cattle, horses, and sheep covering his mountain pastures were staggering to contemplate.

Though only an illegitimate daughter, she was still Lord Kim's own flesh and blood. That he would marry her to someone who had so recently been a government slave—Pak Deokhwan was moved to tears of gratitude, so excited he couldn't sleep through the night.

He knew this was Lord Kim's way of expressing "goodwill" for services he had rendered recently. This made him feel tremendously clever and far-sighted, having seized the opportunity to attach himself to Lord Kim's lofty branch. Every time he thought about it, he felt quite pleased with himself.

In high spirits, Pak Deokhwan returned to his residence. He had barely sat down when his housemaid came to report that Master Huang Yunyu had sent someone.

He went out to find Choi Hyun-taek. Choi had been on the mainland selling goods for his employer, Huang Yunyu, and hadn't been on Jeju.

Choi Hyun-taek led several clerks with a cart loaded with side tables, screens, cabinets, and sundry goods—all items rarely seen here. Jeju Island, isolated and lacking handicrafts, depended on imports from the peninsula for furniture and daily necessities; fine goods were even scarcer. These were clearly high-quality merchandise from the capital.

"Our Master Huang says that Master Pak's happy occasion is approaching," Choi Hyun-taek explained. "There's nothing worth buying here on Jeju, so he specifically had me bring these from the capital for you."

Pak Deokhwan thanked him profusely. He had been worrying that his house was too sparsely furnished—he had money now, but nothing decent could be purchased on Jeju. Since he was to wed Lord Kim's daughter, he needed to present a proper appearance. Master Huang was indeed a thoughtful man. Yet he also felt a vague unease, sensing that his dealings with Huang Yunyu and the others had become too entangled, the debts of favor growing too heavy.

Choi Hyun-taek seemed to read his thoughts. He continued: "You're about to become Lord Kim's honored son-in-law. His daughter has never known hardship—if your home is rustic, your bride won't be happy after the wedding. These things are nothing to worry about. Just pay for them—and if you're short of funds, our Master Huang will gladly lend you the difference."

Seeing Pak Deokhwan make no objection, Choi Hyun-taek directed the clerks to unload.

Before long, the formerly empty rooms were furnished with new pieces, and several calligraphy scrolls hung on the walls. The house was transformed.

Standing in the room surveying his new domain, Pak Deokhwan's face shone with delight.

Even in memory, his family home before its decline had never possessed such elegance.

Choi Hyun-taek sent the clerks on ahead, then led in a young woman. She appeared eighteen or nineteen, quite beautiful, clearly a northern girl. She wore plain cotton clothes and kept her head bowed, saying nothing, yet her posture held an alluring grace that instantly captivated Pak Deokhwan's gaze.

"Master Pak is about to establish his household," Choi Hyun-taek said with a smile. "Our master says: Master Pak has only one housemaid—she can wash clothes and cook, just rough work. She probably can't properly attend to a wife from a *yangban* family. It happens that our master has a distant relative. Her name is Jang Seong-seol. She's a commoner, and all her family is gone. Since she has nowhere to go, she might as well stay at Master Pak's side to serve—it would give her a place to belong."

Pak Deokhwan hastily protested: "I couldn't possibly! I couldn't possibly! Master Huang is too generous—I can't accept such favor." This obligation would be even greater. Moreover, he was about to marry Lord Kim's daughter—to have an attractive maidservant at his side before the bride even arrived, what would that look like?
