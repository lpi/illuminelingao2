# Chapter 1216 - The Final Bid

Marina turned her pleading gaze toward Mendoza. Miss Mendoza's face was half-hidden in shadow—her expression impossible to discern. But Marina could see her hands twisted together against her chest, and a bead of sweat glistening on her chin. Marina quickly crossed herself, then turned her gaze to the floor, hoping to spot the good Mr. Trini that Mendoza had pointed out to her.

Marina saw a maid carrying a bright glass lamp slowly approach a table and stop, then raise the lamp to illuminate it. The light shone on none other than Mr. Trini. He sat at the table, apparently holding some documents. Behind him stood four men who appeared to be Tatars, all leaning over to examine what he held. Marina noticed Mr. Trini's hands were trembling. After a moment, he wiped his forehead with his sleeve, closed his eyes as if taking a deep breath, then picked up a pen and wrote rapidly on the document. The four men took the document away, apparently satisfied.

Marina vaguely understood what Mr. Trini had just signed, but she dared not think too much about it. He grabbed his paddle and looked up—his eyes met Marina's. She saw he was drenched in sweat, pale, his eyes full of exhaustion and fear.

"Four thousand circulation notes!" Trini called out a new price.

"Five thousand!" Xiao Bailang's expression didn't change.

He Fanghui had to pause the auction and send a worker to ask Xiao Bailang: could he actually produce this much cash?

"I don't need to." Xiao Bailang arrogantly produced three admission tickets. "Is this enough? I'm going to have this Spanish mare—even if her ass is small and her tits are tiny—just to spite that little Dutch pretty boy!"

He Fanghui thought he was being obstinate—when it came to matters of "national dignity," Xiao Bailang was bound to get fired up.

Bidding resumed, now jumping five hundred at a time, with Xiao Bailang directly adding a thousand to each of Trini's bids.

When the price reached ninety-five hundred, a murmur swept through the room. Most transmigrators thought this was absurd! Even He Fanghui's normally composed face began to look unnatural.

Trini's face had completely contorted, his features twisted together. He looked as if he might collapse at any moment.

"Ten thousand circulation notes!" He Fanghui finally called out tonight's unbelievable price.

Trini could hold on no longer and fainted to the ground.

"Ten thousand, going once! Ten thousand, going twice!..."

At this tense moment, a figure rose from the back rows. He wore black—a black cloak, black gloves, and even a black velvet mask over his face. Utterly unconcerned with the astonished looks around him, he strode up to the stage.

He Fanghui slowly lowered his gavel—but didn't strike, as if he had been expecting this person all along.

"Do you have an objection to the auction, Count?"

"What's the final bid?"

"Ten thousand circulation notes, sir."

"I'm a guest here with only one admission ticket. Is there a limit on my bidding?"

"As long as you have enough circulation note cash to pay—silver or gold coins would also be acceptable."

The man addressed as "Count" glanced at Marina, who was on the verge of fainting, and said:

"I'll double it. Twenty thousand circulation notes."

He Fanghui opened his mouth in somewhat theatrical surprise. "Twenty thousand?"

"That's right. I could produce twenty thousand pesos in cash if necessary." The newcomer spoke with utter confidence.

"Bastard! Who authorized him to do this..." Xiao Bailang flew into a rage and started to rise to object, but two men grabbed him and pushed him back into his chair. Before he could react, someone stuffed a cigar in his mouth.

No one else bid. He Fanghui tapped his gavel lightly on the table: "Twenty thousand circulation notes—sold!"

Marina watched this tall man approach her. He removed his velvet mask, revealing the handsome yet rugged face of a Latin man—it was the Jesuit priest who had brought her medicine. She cried out in astonishment. The man's black cloak swirled and wrapped around her body, then effortlessly lifted her to lie across his powerful arms.

"Don't be afraid," the man murmured in Italian. "I am a nobleman of Sardinia, at your service!"

Doña Marina de Arellano fainted once again.

---

When she awoke, she was lying in a large, lavishly furnished room. The black-clad knight sat with his back to her at an elegant desk, writing something. Hearing her stir, he rose and walked toward her.

*How imposing he is! So tall and large!* Marina had rarely seen such a tall, athletic Latin man: broad chest, solid shoulders, arms full of muscle. Atop this powerful physique was a face both weathered and handsome. Curled hair—the mark of a gentleman—fell about his head. Truly a rare specimen of masculine beauty.

"You're awake," he said. "Would you like some wine? I have excellent wine here."

Marina said nothing, just nodded. Her lips were indeed parched.

The man took an engraved glass goblet from the bedside table. It was already filled with red wine.

Marina drank it down.

"Where am I? Aren't you a priest, Father?"

"No, I'm not a priest. I only disguised myself as one of those venerable fathers to gain entry to the quarantine camp." The man bowed elegantly. "I am Senzo Lando de Fananohua. Count of Fananohua in Sardinia."

"Where is this place?" Marina looked around.

"You're now in my temporary residence. This place is called Lingao."

"Lingao?"

"Correct—it's right next to China, on an island. This is an Australian colony. They've established a city here."

"Are they Chinese pirates?"

"No, they're not pirates," Lando said. "They're excellent merchants and industrialists."

"Why are you here? What do you intend to do with me?" Marina suddenly grew wary. She had long heard that not all Christians showed charity to their fellow believers. The Barbary pirates counted plenty of Christians among them, and they showed no mercy to Christian ships.

And this self-proclaimed Count of Fananohua of Sardinia—his every gesture betrayed that he wasn't a true nobleman. Besides, she knew that Sardinia as a minor Italian kingdom under the Spanish Viceroy was not strict about conferring noble titles—at least knighthoods could be bought.

This man was very likely an Italian adventurer who had made his fortune through illegal activities in East Asian waters!

Marina shuddered at the thought.

Her companion seemed highly perceptive—he had already noticed her unease.

"You needn't be afraid. I had no interest in you whatsoever originally," he said, pulling up a chair to sit across from her. "It was Miss Mendoza's plea for help that finally made me bid to buy you—otherwise you wouldn't have been scared half to death by that useless Trini. I never expected him to be so poor!"

"Miss Mendoza?"

"Yes—she'll be here to see you shortly." He clapped his hands, and an East Asian maid entered carrying a bundle of clothes.

"Please change your clothes first—what you're wearing isn't quite dignified." He smiled. "I hope my taste in selecting garments won't displease you."

The maid spread the clothes on the bed. Marina recognized them as clothing from her own luggage!

"I redeemed your luggage. Unfortunately, your silverware and jewelry couldn't be recovered—they refused." Seeing her puzzlement, Mr. Lando explained.

"Thank you, sir," Marina said quietly.

"Change your clothes first—I'll return shortly."

With the maid's assistance, Marina changed into her own clothes. Despite the cumbersome layers that made breathing difficult, wearing her own garments somehow made her feel more secure. From what this Mr. Lando had said, it seemed she had good hope of escaping this terrible predicament.

Just then Miss Mendoza arrived. After quietly congratulating her on gaining her freedom, Marina couldn't help but throw herself into Mendoza's arms and burst into tears—if not for Mendoza's tireless efforts throughout this ordeal, she would certainly have fallen into the hands of these Australian heathens like the other poor slave women.

"Please don't be like this. You should thank Mr. Lando and Mr. Trini." Mendoza said. "Mr. Lando spent nearly thirty thousand circulation notes for you—at least several thousand pesos. Without his generosity, I truly don't know how I could have saved you."

She explained in detail how she had sought Lando's help: at first Mr. Lando hadn't wanted to get involved, as he had business dealings with the Australians here and didn't want to offend them. So they had arranged for Trini to step forward instead. But they never expected anyone to bid against Mr. Trini, let alone at prices far exceeding his prepared funds—

"...Mr. Trini had to sign a usurious loan agreement on the spot just to scrape together enough money to bid for you." Mendoza sighed. "And it still wasn't enough! So I rushed off to Mr. Lando in desperation."

"I will never forget your great kindness." Marina said gratefully. She felt especially moved toward Lando—she was nearly brought to tears again. She knew that if not for Lando's generosity tonight, she would now be in the hands of that dark-skinned muscular man, suffering who knows what depravities. "Whatever the cost, I will have my fiancé and father repay you double."

Lando smiled faintly and made a magnanimous gesture: "You'd better repay poor Mr. Trini first—his loan agreement will bankrupt him within two months. Poor artist!"
