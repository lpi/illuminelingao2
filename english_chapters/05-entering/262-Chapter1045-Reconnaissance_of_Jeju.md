# Chapter 1045: Reconnaissance of Jeju

In Xue Ziliang's original plan, he didn't intend to enter Jeju City, but the crude city defense forced him to modify the plan. He decided to go deeper, infiltrating the city to probe the specific reality inside, and then decide based on the situation.

Since there were no enemy towers on the entire city wall, the gate tower was very small and humble, and a mere few patrolling soldiers couldn't monitor the entire wall at all—the circumference of the entire Jeju City was as long as three thousand nine hundred and ten paces—much larger than many county and prefecture seats in the Ming Dynasty with much larger populations, and many parts of the city wall were basically empty.

Xue Ziliang left the support team outside the city and led the assault team to scale the wall quickly using simple poles.

If climbing the city wall in broad daylight under the noses of the guards wasn't surprising enough, Xue Ziliang was shocked again once on top of the wall: it turned out that not only were the defensive fortifications of this wall chaotic and child's play, but the wall itself was also very weird: there were no horse ramps on the inner side of the wall for going up and down—the inner side was directly piled up as an earthen slope. From the defender's perspective, once the enemy attacked the city, it was very convenient for the defenders to ascend the wall, being able to go up and down anytime and anywhere.

However, conversely, once the enemy climbed the wall, they could immediately rush directly into the city into its depth—in other words, the battle to seize the horse ramps to go down the city wall, which originally required the ascending troops to fight bloody battles, was no longer needed. What's more, if the attacker adopted the tactic of using earthen platforms to ascend the wall for attack, this kind of internal slope wall completely eliminated the battle to seize the city gate. As long as the attacker controlled a section of the city wall, subsequent troops could continuously cross the wall easily through the slopes inside and outside the city.

This measure was more like opening a wide door for the attacker than facilitating the defender. Although Xue Ziliang had no research on ancient Chinese city walls, the tactics of attacking defensive fortifications were consistent. seeing this real object, he understood where the Senators' attitude of extreme contempt for the combat effectiveness of the Joseon army came from.

After entering the city, the assault team found themselves entering fields surrounded by walls from open fields: inside the city were still fields, vegetable gardens, and small woods, with some very small thatched huts scattered in between. Xue Ziliang felt very maladjusted: this really didn't look like a city.

Xue Ziliang observed with binoculars from the woods for a long time, marking the observed drill ground, government office (*Gammyeong*), warehouses, wells, and roads inside the city on the map one by one. Xue Ziliang originally planned that if the opponent's defensive strength was strong, he would stage a "center blossom" (strike from within), destroying the local armory, then carrying out assassinations and arson to thoroughly disrupt the opponent's defensive measures. But now it seemed a bit superfluous, instead reducing the amount of loot and prisoners—even leading the team into the city for reconnaissance was superfluous.

He had full confidence in taking Jeju City now, but there were too few people in the detachment. even if taken, they couldn't control the whole city. Causing a riot would be rarely worth the loss—Xue Ziliang knew very well how much the Senate valued population and supplies. Taking an empty city was meaningless to the Senate.

The two Park brothers knelt on the ground with nervous expressions, sweating all over even in the deep of winter: beside them stood a short-haired Japanese pirate in flowery clothes gesturing with a Japanese sword. They were deeply afraid that a careless answer would lead to being cut down directly—Jeju Island had suffered deeply from the scourge of Japanese pirates. Whether officials, commoners, soldiers, or official slaves, hearing "Wokou" made them lose their souls.

Although the Intelligence Bureau agent spoke Korean not badly, there was a difference from the local Jeju dialect after all. The Park brothers were scared and nervous, making their speech even less clear. It took quite a while tossing back and forth to clarify their identity as official slaves of the Jeju Government Office, coming here to pay respects to their ancestors.

The food and spirit tablets they brought showed they were not lying. Xue Ziliang originally didn't want to waste time on them, but hearing they were official slaves, and thinking of the spirit of finding "proletarian collaborators" conveyed by Feng Zongze, he decided to take them away—they would need the assistance of locals after entering Jeju City.

"Take the prisoners, let's go." He ordered. gags and black hoods were immediately taken out by accompanying soldiers. Before the Park brothers could react, their mouths were gagged, heads covered, and wrists tied behind their backs.

Because of bringing prisoners, leaving the city took a bit more time than entering. But the whole journey was smooth. The Special Reconnaissance Detachment then took the prisoners all the way to Biyangdo. The Special Reconnaissance Detachment had set up a temporary forward reconnaissance base here.

Biyangdo was a volcanic island formed by an eruption in 1002, the youngest among Jeju's volcanic islands. It was very close to Jeju Port, taking only fifteen minutes using a large motorized boat. Launching an attack from here was ideal. There was a beacon tower on the island, which had been controlled by the Special Reconnaissance Detachment—five beacon soldiers continued to act as a "zombie beacon tower" under the Special Reconnaissance Detachment's orders.

The Park brothers were brought here in a daze. Over a dozen prisoners captured by the Special Reconnaissance Detachment along the way were already detained in the secret camp in the crater woods. Most prisoners were local farmers with nothing to squeeze out of them, detained temporarily only for secrecy.

The Park brothers confessed more things here: including the approximate population and number of soldiers in the city. But for Xue Ziliang, the most valuable intelligence was: the magistrates of Jeongui and Daejeong counties were originally in the city, but after getting the news of "Wokou attack," they had already rushed back to their own counties.

Xue Ziliang immediately dispatched two groups to pursue along the road, ordering that the two magistrates must be intercepted and captured alive—if they couldn't be captured alive, killing them on the spot was also acceptable.

Although his team members were on foot while the magistrates and retinues were on horseback, people couldn't ride horses at a gallop continuously for a long time: even if the people could stand it, the horses couldn't. But forced marching continuously was no problem for the Special Reconnaissance Detachment. Besides, they could use small motorized boats to maneuver for a distance: the official roads on Jeju Island, like on Hainan Island, unfolded along the coastline.

The Park brothers, who provided important intelligence, were put on a ship and transferred to Seongsan before they could recover from their shock. They were residents within Jeju City, obviously extremely suitable candidates for collaborators. Feng Zongze requested selecting some prisoners captured around Jeju to be sent to Seongsan for emergency instigation.

While the Special Reconnaissance Detachment arrived at Biyangdo and commenced reconnaissance of Jeju City, Nangong Wudi organized a special task force mixed with regular infantry, public security army, and laborers, starting an attack on Jeongui County.

Jeongui County Seat was located on a plain by the sea, very close to Seongsan. The troops marched all the way. Apart from a fishing village near Seongsan, there was actually not even a single village along the route, only a few beacon towers, some long abandoned, some with beacon soldiers already fled.

By the roadside were large coastal plains. Although the terrain was flat, there were no signs of cultivated fields, all dense coastal grasslands, with withered grass swaying in the strong sea breeze.

The sea breeze carried the salty taste of seawater, exceptionally biting on the face. Nangong Wudi had heard Feng Zongze say that the vegetation of this kind of coastal pasture was rich in salt and minerals, very beneficial for raising horses and cattle. Hokkaido became a world-famous large ranch partly due to its special geographical conditions.

Although Jeju Island was not as uniquely endowed by nature as Hokkaido, it had many similar favorable conditions—this was a large ranch created by heaven and earth.

Only when Jeongui County Seat appeared in view did some fields appear by the roadside. The fields had finished harvesting, with scattered straw. These were obviously dry fields.

"This county seat is really dilapidated!" Nangong Wudi observed the county seat through binoculars. Although the dilapidated state of several county seats in southern Hainan he had visited had already surprised him, the condition of Jeongui County Seat was obviously worse.

The so-called city wall was just a wall built with volcanic rocks, at most three meters high. And many places had collapsed—Korean city walls were built by piling stones into straight rectangular shapes, so the foundation was unstable, couldn't be built very high, and wasn't sturdy either.

The city gate did have an *Wengcheng* (barbican) for protection, but both the city gate and the gate tower were too low and small. And like Jeju City, there were no battlements or parapets here either.

Although the city wall was dilapidated, the circumference was over a thousand paces. Even among ancient county-level cities in China, it wasn't considered small.

The characteristic of Joseon fortifications was greed for size, always wanting to enclose as much land as possible within the city, but in reality, there weren't so many residents and buildings inside. So most of the area inside the city was often farmland and wasteland.

The result was a thin wall surrounding an overly large city, often with insufficient defenders. It was fine for resisting small groups of bandits or mobs usually, but facing a scaled army, it would be unable to resist immediately: when the Japanese army invaded Korea, they entered as if into uninhabited territory; no Korean city could hold fast.

Nangong Wudi had the same thought as Xue Ziliang: damn, for such a city, might as well let the labor squadron go up—treating it as militia training.

Even so, he cautiously sent point men for close-in reconnaissance. There was a not-large village outside the city. Apart from that, there were no other settlements.

The city gates of Jeongui County were already closed, and all soldiers inside the city had ascended the wall. But the commoners and officials inside had no heart to defend to the death: firstly, the magistrate had gone to Jeju, leaving no one in charge, causing people's hearts to waver; secondly, Jeongui County Seat had a fatal flaw: there was no water in the city, the water source being five *li* outside the city. Usually, drinking water in the city relied on people and cattle fetching and transporting water from springs. Daily used water was "Heaven-Bosh Water" (*Bongcheon-su*)—digging a pit index the ground and placing buckets to catch rainwater. Such Heaven-Bosh Water could be used for doing laundry. If collected in bamboo tubes and left for a period, it could also be consumed. Autumn and winter were dry seasons with little rain, so the stock of Heaven-Bosh Water was also insufficient. The freshwater available for the whole city was merely the water stored in water jars in each household, at most enough for three or four days.

Without food, they could persist for quite some time; without stored water, they couldn't even last three days. So the soldiers and officials in the city were very panicked, not knowing what to do, only hoping the "Wokou" would retreat quickly.
