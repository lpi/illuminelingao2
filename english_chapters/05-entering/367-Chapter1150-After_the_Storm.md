# Chapter 1150 - After the Storm

The month-long visit drew at last to its close.

Huygens and the Bontekoe siblings prepared to depart.

On the pier, Zhong Lishi, Zhong Xiaoying, and Wei Bachi gathered to see them off.

"Thank you for your hospitality," Huygens said with evident sincerity. "This has been an unforgettable journey. I have glimpsed the future."

"We hope that peace and friendship will endure between us," Wei Bachi replied in measured diplomatic tones.

Westerly gripped Dr. Zhong's hand tightly. "Dr. Zhong, I shall study diligently. I want to become a scientist like you."

"I have no doubt you will," Zhong Lishi said warmly. "Remember—question everything, and verify everything."

Cleadia and Zhong Xiaoying embraced, tears glistening in their eyes.

"Don't forget to write," Cleadia managed, her voice catching.

"I won't. Take care of yourself," Zhong Xiaoying whispered.

The Dutch vessel eased away from the pier. From the deck, the siblings waved until the figures on shore dwindled to specks on the horizon.

"They're gone," Zhong Xiaoying said softly, a note of loss in her voice.

"There will be opportunities to meet again," Zhong Lishi assured her. "The world grows smaller every day."

After seeing off their guests, Wei Bachi returned immediately to his labors.

"Mayor, the draft of the 'Kaohsiung Five-Year Plan' requires your review," his secretary reported.

"Coming." Wei Bachi adjusted his hat. The moment for sentiment had passed; reality beckoned.

Xu Ke, too, remained occupied. Li Siya's appearance and the rumor campaign had put him on alert. He launched a "cleansing operation" throughout the city to root out lurking enemy agents.

"We must purify our rear," Xu Ke emphasized at an internal briefing, "before the real war arrives."

Deep within the Customs House, the great clock continued its precise revolutions. *Tick-tock. Tick-tock.* It marked the passage of time, bearing witness to the history taking shape within these walls.

Life in Kaohsiung settled back into its rhythm. Workers reported to their posts, soldiers drilled, refugees cleared new farmland. The vast machinery of the Committee ground onward, crushing every obstacle in its path.

Zhong Lishi returned to his laboratory. He intended to compile his notes from the past weeks and draft a report on "Science Education for European Youth." It struck him that influencing the next generation of Europeans might prove a worthwhile long-term strategic investment.

"Father, I wish to learn more languages," Zhong Xiaoying announced suddenly while helping him organize papers. "Not just Mandarin—Dutch too, and Latin..."

Zhong Lishi looked up, surprised and pleased. "Why the sudden interest?"

"Because I want to understand their world more deeply." A new light shone in Zhong Xiaoying's eyes. "The way you do."

Zhong Lishi smiled. He recognized growth in his daughter. "Very well. I will teach you."

The sun sank toward the western horizon, casting a golden afterglow across the sea. The Committee's golden age had only begun.
