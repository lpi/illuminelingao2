# Chapter 1145 - The Visitor

Li Siya arrived in Kaohsiung once again, this time disguised as a wealthy merchant's female relative visiting kin.

She lodged at a high-end inn in the commercial district. From her window, she could observe the bustling street scene below.

"Their recovery speed is astonishing," she noted to herself. "These Australians function like precision machines."

She spotted the newly completed Customs Clock Tower and the great clock face mounted upon it. She heard the bell chime on the hour.

"Standard time..." Li Siya murmured. She recognized it for what it was—not merely a tool for telling time, but a symbol of rule and order.

Her contact in Kaohsiung, a deep-cover operative, arrived to report.

"Control here grows tighter by the day," the spy complained. "Residence permits, travel passes, health certificates—layer upon layer of checks. Moving about freely is nearly impossible."

"What of the Dutch guests?" Li Siya asked.

"They've taken up residence in the Customs Building now. Very close to that Committee member, Zhong."

"Is there any opportunity to contact them?"

"Difficult. Sentries are posted everywhere around the Customs Building. And the foreign guests are accompanied whenever they venture out."

Li Siya pondered. She needed to get a message to Huygens.

"Have you located the person I asked about?"

"Yes. A cook in the trading house kitchen. He's susceptible to bribes."

"Good." Li Siya produced a letter. "Find a way to place this in Mr. Huygens' servant's hands. Let the servant deliver it to his master."

"Understood."

The letter contained intelligence regarding Zheng Zhilong's disposition, along with suggestions on how the Dutch might collaborate with the Zheng family to contain Australian expansion. She was confident that Huygens, as a diplomat, would recognize its value.

Huygens received the letter the following day, tucked inside his napkin during breakfast. He read it with no change of expression, then slipped it into his pocket.

Later, alone in his chamber, he reread the letter with care.

"Interesting," he murmured. "Someone wishes to play a game of balance."

He had no idea who "Li Siya" was—the letter bore no signature—but its analysis of the geopolitical situation was remarkably insightful.

He resolved to take no rash action. He was a guest of the Australians now, and any improper move could jeopardize both his mission and the children. Yet this intelligence would prove useful for future reference.

That afternoon, Dr. Zhong invited Huygens to visit the newly completed lighthouse project site.

"This lighthouse will employ a Fresnel lens of our own design," Zhong Lishi explained with evident enthusiasm. "Its beam will be visible from over twenty nautical miles away."

Huygens listened attentively. "A Fresnel lens? A novel optical design."

"Yes. It drastically reduces the lens's thickness while preserving its focusing power," Zhong Lishi elaborated.

They stood atop the cape, gazing out across the vast expanse of sea.

"Dr. Zhong, your technology is extraordinary," Huygens remarked. "But have you considered that technology alone cannot solve every problem?"

---

Zhong Lishi turned to him. "What do you mean by that, Mr. Huygens?"

"Politics. Diplomacy. The human heart..." Huygens spoke with deliberate weight. "These are often more intricate than any clockwork."

Zhong Lishi smiled. "We have people who specialize in those particular complexities. I am merely a technician."

"A most distinguished technician," Huygens replied with a laugh.

On the way back, they encountered Xu Ke. He was patrolling near the construction site.

"Dr. Zhong," Xu Ke greeted. His gaze flicked to the Dutchman at Zhong Lishi's side.

"This is Lieutenant Xu from the Navy," Zhong Lishi introduced.

Huygens tipped his hat in polite acknowledgment. Xu Ke returned a crisp salute, his eyes sharp and assessing. There was something unusual about this Dutchman—too calm, too observant.

"All quiet, Lieutenant?" Zhong Lishi asked.

"Routine patrol," Xu Ke replied. "Please remain on guard. The area hasn't been fully cleared yet."

After they had passed, Xu Ke summoned a subordinate. "That Dutchman—Huygens. Increase surveillance on him. He strikes me as... deep."

"Yes, Chief."

---

That night, Li Siya received confirmation that the letter had been delivered. But there was no response from Huygens.

"He's cautious," Li Siya concluded. "No matter. The seed has been planted."

Her mission in Kaohsiung extended beyond this single objective. She also began seeding rumors in teahouses and markets: "The Australians plan to press-gang men into hard labor..." "There's plague spreading in the refugee camps..."

Such whispers of panic wouldn't spark immediate chaos, but they would erode trust in the Committee, drop by insidious drop.

*Water dripping upon stone*, Li Siya thought with grim satisfaction.

Yet she had underestimated the Committee's grip on public discourse. Police and the watchful "Life Committee" aunts patrolling the streets quickly traced the source of the strange talk.

"Someone's spreading lies in the teahouse?" The police chief scowled. "Arrest the agitators!"

Li Siya sensed danger closing in and withdrew just before the net drew tight. She slipped into the shadows of the harbor and boarded a smuggling boat departing the port.

*I will return*, she vowed silently.

---

Wei Bachi perused the security report the following morning. "Rumors? Spies?" He gave a contemptuous snort. "Mere clowns prancing about. As long as our iron fist remains hard, such tricks are useless."

He turned his attention back to the blueprint spread across his desk. "Expansion of the steel plant... *this* is the real work."
