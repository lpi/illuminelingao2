# Chapter 1178 - The Agreement

"Speaking of which, you mention the Shogun of Edo. There's something I'd like to ask, if you could enlighten me."

Seeing the other side begin to ease the atmosphere, the two envoys breathed a sigh of relief. But the masters of dark diplomacy always struck at such moments:

"Should I address him as 'Shogun of Japan' or 'King of Japan'?"

"Since Lord Hideyoshi refused the title King of Japan, those who rule Japan have been called Shogun."

"Very well." Ping Qiusheng produced a document folder. "Take a look at this. Yet on Shogun Hidetada's state letter, he used the seal of 'King of Japan.'"

When Japan and Korea made peace in 1607, the Tsushima domain had been entrusted by Tokugawa Ieyasu to request that Korea send envoys. The Korean side demanded that Japan submit a state letter and extradite the criminals who had desecrated the royal tombs. Sō Yoshitoshi, along with senior councilor Yanagawa Shigeoki and the monk Genso, forged a state letter, then randomly grabbed some criminals, rendered them mute, and sent them over. The Koreans knew full well the other side was faking, but still sent a "Reply and Repatriation Mission," and bilateral relations were restored. But one lie requires a thousand more to cover it.

Since the shogunate hadn't actually submitted a state letter, when the Korean side responded with one, it put Sō Yoshitoshi on the spot again. So the Sō clan trio also altered the Korean letter. Ieyasu, not knowing the Korean letter was a response, then sent another reply to Korea, which the Sō trio altered as well... And so back and forth, the Sō clan trio altered more than a dozen state letters, until they all died and their successors inherited this glorious tradition and continued the forgery enterprise—until 1634, when Yanagawa Tadaoki stirred up trouble and exposed the affair. After much deliberation, Shogun Iemitsu once again pardoned the Sō clan and had the Yanagawa clan exiled. Only after this did the two countries' rulers finally see authentic state letters.

This was the famous "Yanagawa Incident" in East Asian diplomatic history. Such events, which seem absurd by modern standards, weren't uncommon in East Asia at the time. For the sake of "face," "orthodoxy," and "national dignity," the three nations of East Asia had produced no shortage of such farces. Similar incidents involving fake envoys and forged state letters had occurred between China and Japan during the Wanli Korean Campaign. Information was scarce in those days, and news between nations traveled slowly. Those fluent in foreign languages were few, so even rulers had to rely on a tiny number of people for diplomatic communications—leaving ample room for fraud.

Before D-Day, Yu Eshui had specifically searched Japanese and Korean digital libraries for PDF scans of numerous forged state letters. In this timeline, Yanagawa hadn't yet made his exposé... The two envoys before him were now sweating profusely.

Though both Nagafune and Takeya had heard rumors at drinking parties, they'd never seen proof. Now these Australians of unknown origin were throwing what appeared to be exact copies of the originals on the table.

In fact, what both sides were thinking of was the same person—the third-generation Shogun, Tokugawa Iemitsu.

Tokugawa Iemitsu had been given the name "Takechiyo" at birth—this was the hereditary childhood name of Tokugawa heirs. Before Ieyasu's death, he had specifically arranged for the second Shogun Hidetada to retire, letting Iemitsu succeed as third Shogun. This showed the Great Lord's high expectations for Iemitsu.

And Iemitsu lived up to his grandfather's expectations. He was practically the personification of Japanese clan politics, inheriting the Tokugawa family's cunning and caution, the stubbornness and conservatism of his mother's Azai line, and the domineering decisiveness of his maternal grandfather Oda's line... In short, he was a powerful figure capable of making all the realm's daimyō tremble and submit. The Tokugawa "rule by force" reached its peak under his hand. Not only did he add numerous articles to the Laws for Warrior Houses, but he also enforced them mercilessly. Many daimyō who had been famous during the Warring States period were stripped of their domains under his rule for various "violations." Whether collateral branches, hereditary vassals, or outside lords—none dared challenge the shogunate's authority.

At this point, Tokugawa Iemitsu hadn't yet built his later fearsome reputation. But since the death of Second Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada in January 1632, when Iemitsu officially took direct control with full authority, he had already begun showing the qualities of a strongman.

The difference between the two sides was this: for the Tsushima domain, the Shogun was an existence whose single word could decide the life and death of themselves, their families, and even their lord. While for the Lingao side, Iemitsu was merely one of several opponents with relatively stable rule—at most, a question of how to bring him to heel at minimum cost.

After flipping through just a few pages of the documents, Nagafune Genshichirō-hyōe and Takeya were sweating like rain. Since this group calling themselves Australians could produce copies or whatever these were of the old incriminating evidence, they naturally had means to place them before the Shogun. This would be catastrophic: Nagafune and Takeya as directly involved parties—never mind the Shogun or their lord, they couldn't even afford to offend councilors like Yanagawa or Susa. Not only would their deaths be meaningless, but their reputations for loyalty and righteousness would be shattered. Once this came out, the domain would certainly face dissolution, and the implicated senior retainers would almost certainly have to commit seppuku. The Nagafune family would become sinners of the Tsushima domain, and even if they survived by some miracle, they'd spend the rest of their lives being hunted.

The only course now was to weigh what price must be paid. The other side was clearly showing their hand not to cause the dissolution of Tsushima domain.

Genshichirō prostrated himself: "Please, Your Excellency, give clear instructions!"

"Our Great Song only befriends men of loyalty and righteousness. Can the two of you be called men of loyalty and righteousness?" Seeing both envoys sweating like rain, trembling like chaff, Ping Qiusheng threw down a lifeline.

"We have been loyal for generations!"

"Since you are men of loyalty and righteousness, our Great Australian Song is willing to make a three-article covenant with your house..."

What followed was naturally trade agreement negotiations. The agreement had three main provisions:

First, following the precedent of Japan and Korea, Tsushima would acknowledge vassalage to Australian Song. The Senate would enfeoff the Sō clan as Vice Commissioner of the Tsushima Regiment. The Sō clan would also be appointed as Communications Commissioner between Lingao and the Edo shogunate, tasked with finding ways to establish trade relations with Edo.

Second, Jeju and Tsushima would mutually open ports. Merchant vessels of both sides could freely enter and exit with proper credentials and would enjoy most-favored treatment.

Third, both sides would establish consulates to handle customs and trade quotas. The Tsushima domain would send a younger son to reside at the Jeju consulate—essentially a hostage. Business would be handled by Takeya. Australian Song could establish a trade consulate in Tsushima, and Takeya would also station specialized personnel at his Nagasaki office—this point was specifically requested by the Intelligence Bureau.

The treaty's appendix placed few restrictions on Japanese exports: aside from prohibiting the import of Japanese swords, all other goods were permitted. Generally speaking, Japan at this time could export few things: mainly Japanese swords, fans, gold, silver, copper, maritime products (dried seafood), and silk textiles. Except for Japanese swords, all of these were useful to the Senate—at minimum they could be re-exported. To increase Japanese exports, it was specifically noted that the Japanese side could sell timber—though for an island domain like Tsushima that had no forests of its own, the costs of logging in the main islands and transshipping for export would probably leave no profit margin.

After Takeya examined the product samples Ping Qiusheng displayed, he was deeply shocked. Forty years ago, the Sakai merchant Naya Sukezaemon—later known as "Luzon Sukezaemon" after he smuggled Murakawa Hidetsugi to Southeast Asia—had smuggled a batch of celadon from Quanzhou and presented several pieces to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, fabricating a story that they were "Luzon ware." Hideyoshi had never seen such fine vessels and rewarded him with over 100,000 koku, then together with master tea practitioner Rikyū sold "Luzon tea bowls," making enormous profits from the realm's daimyō. When Hideyoshi died, the man had to flee to Cambodia. Now the Australians had not only fine celadon but also bone china as white as jade, and various glassware as clear as crystal—priced quite affordably by Japanese standards. Reselling would yield ten or a hundred times the profit!

Especially the complete sets of glass and porcelain tea services, divided into Great Ming style and Australian Song style—the latter being English-style black tea services and oolong tea sets from the old timeline. Naturally there were also Japanese tea ceremony vessels in their peculiar shapes and glazes.

As for bulk consumer goods, there were fabrics of various qualities—also major Japanese imports at the time. The shogunate regulations permitted commoners to wear only cotton and hemp, but Japan's own cotton—whether tree cotton or herbaceous cotton—was insufficient. So every year they had to import cotton cloth from the Great Ming and Korea. Korean cotton cloth in particular was a major item in Japan-Korea trade.

Though the Senate hadn't yet built its own cotton spinning mills, the East India Company shipped large quantities of cheap cotton cloth from India. Songjiang Prefecture in the Great Ming was famous for "clothing the realm." Hainan and Guangdong were traditional kapok-producing regions with considerable amounts of household-woven cotton cloth. So whatever the Japanese wanted could be supplied—at price-performance ratios far better than Korean goods.

As for other miscellaneous samples—the small hardware items and machine-made farm tools especially amazed the Sō clan envoys. Though individually of little value, these were always hot sellers on the market, able to sell as fast as they could be supplied. Moreover, the iron quality of these Australian products was visibly superior.
