# Chapter 964 - On the Road to Dengzhou

The gravel-paved official road became a blur beneath his feet, almost impossible to discern. The dawn wind blew in from the wilderness. Even wearing a windbreaker and hood, Zhao Yingong still felt chilled to the bone.

The journey from Hangzhou to Dengzhou was both arduous and dangerous. Within Southern Zhili, traveling north along the Grand Canal, they had used boats provided by the Xu family. Along the way, Xu family servants attended to them. Not only was the journey comfortable, but the smooth passage through checkpoints and sluice gates, the solicitous officials along the route, and the effective conscription of porters all gave Zhao Yingong yet another full appreciation of gentry power.

No wonder so many people wanted to obtain official titles. Even those who made fortunes in commerce never forgot to hire famous tutors for their children and bribe examiners—doing everything possible to get them "inside the system." The difference between officials and commoners was truly "like heaven and earth."

Yet this sentiment about the gulf between officials and commoners evaporated once they crossed the Yellow River.

During the Ming dynasty, the Yellow River had seized the Huai River's course to reach the sea, with its outlet near Xuzhou. Crossing the Yellow River near Xuzhou took them out of Southern Zhili and into Shandong.

The Grand Canal was also navigable within Shandong but didn't reach Dengzhou. The group disembarked at Xuzhou and switched to overland travel. Zhao Tong, who had run escort routes to the north before, reminded everyone to be careful along the way.

If the region north of the Yangtze within Southern Zhili already appeared bleak and impoverished, once they crossed the Yellow River and entered Shandong, Zhao Yingong truly felt the harshness of the environment.

Though it was already midsummer, the fields held not a trace of crops. Vast stretches of land lay fallow. Trees along the route had died in clusters; on closer inspection, they had all been stripped of bark. Among the grass and trees, scattered bones could occasionally be seen.

The occasional villages they passed were either covered with tall weeds with collapsed buildings, or else fortified with high walls and deep ditches, with village militia standing on high alert. When Zhao Yingong inquired, he learned that less than ten years ago—in 1622—the White Lotus Sect uprising led by Xu Hongru had erupted in southern Shandong. The uprising, centered on Jining, had spread east to Rizhao, west to Heze, and south to the Xuzhou area. The entire route had suffered military devastation. In recent years there had also been continuous floods, government tax surcharges grew heavier by the day, bandits were everywhere, and the people had either died or fled—leaving only a landscape of devastation. Even in broad daylight, small bands of bandits operated openly. Desperate men were everywhere. For this reason, Zhao Yingong's party, besides their own escort guards, had an additional ten-plus stalwart Xu family retainers for protection along the way.

And so they journeyed northward, constantly vigilant, pressing forward without rest. At Yizhou they encountered a massive rainstorm, and the Shu River flooded. Water depths on flat ground reached six or seven *chi*; with great difficulty they obtained boats. Zhao Yingong watched the crowds of elders supporting the young and the corpses along the route, his heart aching terribly. He muttered silently to himself: "We're late!"

But at present he had no capacity to take in refugees. Without official backing, nothing could be done in the Great Ming. He could only urge his entourage onward to Dengzhou as quickly as possible to meet Sun Yuanhua and gain his trust and support.

The party crossed mountains and forded streams, sleeping rough and dining on the wind, finally reaching Dengzhou with extreme difficulty. The hardships of the journey were beyond description.

Dengzhou at this time was already a major frontier stronghold for the Great Ming's operations against Liaodong. It was also where Xu Guangqi, Sun Yuanhua, and others were training their new army. Before even seeing Dengzhou's walls, they frequently encountered troop movements and military camps along the way. Mounted patrols rode the roads, occasionally stopping people for inspection.

Though the route appeared heavily guarded, they still heard reports of bandit and salt-smuggler activity along the way. There had even been terrifying incidents of entire villages being massacred. As if to confirm these reports, just after entering Dengzhou territory, near the official road, they heard sounds of fighting and screaming. Everyone immediately halted their horses and drew their weapons. Zhao Tong, in charge of security, ordered the dogs released from the cart, readying them to attack and bite, while he turned his horse toward the center of the column.

Zhao Yingong was being escorted forward by his servants when he heard the report from ahead. He turned and asked the local post courier accompanying them if he knew what had happened. The old courier said: "Must be the local salt smugglers having a turf fight."

"Not bandits?"

"Bandits wouldn't dare come onto the road in broad daylight—too many troops around here." The courier said. "Most salt smugglers are local military households. Poor as they are, reduced to smuggling salt, quite a few still hold minor ranks like flag commander, general flag, or centurion. The authorities generally don't bother with them—can't control them anyway."

Hearing it was just a salt-smuggler fight, Zhao Yingong ordered the party to continue. Zhao Tong objected: "Master, we can't see what's happening up ahead. If we go over and someone mistakes us for coming to help, there'll be trouble—once a fight starts, it's hard to stop."

Zhao Yingong thought this made sense. He was, after all, in unfamiliar territory. Getting embroiled in local conflicts would create endless complications. Though his official backing was "solid," salt smugglers were local powerhouses. Any casualties would create unnecessary grudges.

The group waited on the road a while longer. The sounds of fighting gradually died down. Zhao Tong instructed everyone to wait a moment longer while he went ahead to investigate. He dismounted and slowly made his way forward along the road shoulder. After about the time it takes to finish a meal, he returned, approaching Zhao Yingong's horse to report: "Master, the fighting ahead has dispersed. But there are many bodies and weapons on the road—please have everyone proceed carefully."

Under Zhao Tong's guidance, the group cautiously proceeded. In the distance, the roadside was indeed scattered with thirty or forty corpses, bloody everywhere. The ground was also littered with broken weapons. Zhao Yingong noticed the ground was covered with sharpened bamboo spears and a dozen damaged bows. There were also scattered straw bundles and loose sea salt.

"This was a salt shipment robbery," the courier said. "Common on this stretch of road. Look—the wheel tracks leave the road here. The robbers got away with it." He studied the scene and muttered: "That's not right..." After saying this, he seemed to regret speaking and quickly fell silent.

"What's not right?"

After Zhao Yingong pressed him repeatedly, the courier finally said haltingly that there were quite a few horse-hoof prints on the post road, and the arrows left in the corpses weren't the kind of military equipment ordinary bandits or salt smugglers used.

"Imperial troops?"

The courier didn't speak, but his expression confirmed it.

"Doesn't Governor Sun do anything about this?" Zhao Yingong had already had doubts about Sun Yuanhua's military command ability; now he felt his assessment was even more accurate.

The courier whispered: "How can Governor Sun control it? The troops these days are owed back pay for one or two years at a stretch. Most of the forces in Dengzhou are also guest troops—the most lawless of all. That they haven't openly robbed merchants or massacred villages to collect provisions right here is already proof that Governor Sun and General Zhang have done a good job maintaining discipline."

In other words, sneaking around doing a bit of "black eating black" barely counted as anything. Zhao Yingong knew something of the atrocities imperial troops were capable of. But judging from the bodies left behind and the wheel tracks, the salt smugglers' shipment had been only about twenty wheelbarrow loads—worth maybe a few dozen taels of silver altogether. That this was enough to trigger mutual slaughter showed just how chaotic times had become.

"Let's go—this is troubled ground." The courier urged everyone to quickly get moving.

Just as they were about to set off, someone among the corpses suddenly cried out "Help!" Zhao Yingong ordered his servants to search. They pulled a young man from beneath several bodies. He was covered in blood, his wounds hard to assess.

"Can he be saved?" Zhao Yingong asked.

Zhao Tong nodded: "He has flesh wounds. Apply some trauma medicine and he should pull through."

"Then bring him along. Put him in the cart. Whether he lives or dies will be up to his fate." Zhao Yingong said.

The party finally reached Dengzhou city without further incident. Dengzhou was now a garrison town, with soldiers speaking various dialects everywhere inside and outside the walls. Zhao Yingong noticed many spoke with Liaodong accents—these were clearly former Dongjiang Army troops, the main force of the Dengzhou Mutiny that was about to erupt.

Using letters of introduction from Xu Guangqi and others, Zhao Yingong passed unimpeded into the city—as the frontier for Liaodong operations and a military-critical location, city gate inspections were extremely strict.

After entering the city, Zhao Tong found all the major inns full and the smaller ones unsatisfactory for his master. He took the initiative to find a large local temple, donated six taels of silver, and under the abbot's solicitous reception secured lodging in a courtyard within the temple grounds. Zhao Yingong ordered everyone to rest for three days, bathing and changing clothes to shake off the dust of the road. He also had the luggage unpacked to check and prepare the gifts for Sun Yuanhua and others—all carefully selected items, many specially shipped from Macau and Lingao.

For this visit to Sun Yuanhua, besides letters from the Xu family and the Hangzhou church, he had also brought Father Jean-Baptiste Jinliger—a missionary whose presence would fully prove him a "seeker of truth."

To obtain the maximum possible assistance from Sun Yuanhua, he had to present himself as a sincere prospective convert. Only then would Sun Yuanhua treat his requests from the perspective of a fellow believer, rather than as just another schemer.

He knew little about Sun Yuanhua. The Grand Library had provided him only basic biographical information and some statements of political views. What kind of person Sun Yuanhua actually was, they had no way to infer. However, since Xu Guangqi was willing to have his son form a marriage alliance with Sun's family, the man's character was probably sound. To have become a governor before even turning fifty indicated considerable skill at being an official. He was also a Catholic enthusiast about using "Western methods" to reform the Great Ming's military technology and systems. Taking all this together, Sun Yuanhua should be a person of good character, skilled at officialdom, and open to new ideas. Such a person shouldn't be too hard to deal with—what Zhao Yingong feared most was encountering people unwilling to do things. With such people, nothing could be accomplished.

Zhao Yingong instructed his servants to first gather information, confirming that Sun Yuanhua was currently in his residence. Then he selected a day to formally present himself at the yamen for an audience.
