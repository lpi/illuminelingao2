# Chapter 1069 - Persuasion (Continued)

His mentor, Xu Guangqi, had originally placed high hopes on this New Army of the Great Ming in Dengzhou and Laizhou. Now, not only was the New Army gone, but it had even transformed into a rebel army committing all kinds of crimes—tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians in Dengzhou were killed. Although there was the factor of Liaodong insiders, as the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou, he could not shirk his responsibility.

"It is all because Sun used people blindly!" Sun Yuanhua sighed heavily. "Kong Youde should have just killed me with one stroke, allowing Sun to fulfill his loyalty."

"Sir dying once and for all is certainly loyal, but it is merely a small loyalty and small righteousness." Because Lu Wenyuan positioned himself as a junior, it was inconvenient to speak too sharply. "The world of the Great Ming has reached a boiling point. The plan for today is only to save the nation from extinction and rescue the millions of people from water and fire. That is the righteousness Sir should uphold."

A person like Sun Yuanhua, although inevitably possessing various habits typical of late Ming bureaucrats, was generally a pragmatic bureaucrat willing to take responsibility and do things, with a strong concept of taking the world's affairs as his own duty. Therefore, Lu Wenyuan started with this point to persuade him to cooperate.

"Kong Youde, Li Jiucheng, and other owls not killing Sir is probably also intended to trap Sir in a place of disloyalty and injustice," Lu Wenyuan said softly.

These words were like five thunderbolts striking the head; Sun Yuanhua froze instantly.

Indeed, just the night before, Kong Youde had come to see him. Besides forcing him to write a letter to Shandong Governor Yu Dacheng to "offer amnesty," he had also tentatively asked if he was willing to merge with the rebel army—even saying that the old Dongjiang troops and Liaodong people in Dengzhou all admired him greatly and were willing to support him "as King."

Sun Yuanhua naturally refused—he had a family plus dependents, and was a high official who had received "Imperial Grace." Of course, he was unwilling to merge with the rebel army.

The conversation was top secret; he didn't expect this young man to know about it. This person was truly unfathomable.

Lu Wenyuan said: "Sir, do not blame me for speaking abruptly. Although this matter is my speculation, given Sir's relationship with Kong Youde and the group of old Liaodong people, as long as Sir remains trapped in Dengzhou City, such rumors will sooner or later emerge."

Sun Yuanhua nodded. Upon reflection, what he said made perfect sense. He was not afraid of death; he merely refused to commit suicide because of religious doctrine. But outsiders could not understand this. He had treated the Liaodong people very generously in the past and heavily employed them. It wouldn't be surprising if such rumors spread when the time came.

The current Emperor was not someone who could tolerate sand in his eyes; his suspicious nature was quite heavy. One could imagine what would happen once such rumors broke out.

"Sir, please think. Even if Kong Youde feels gratitude for old grace and does not kill Sir, releasing Sir to return home, Sir probably won't escape the disaster of the Imperial Prison/Zhaoyu."

Sun Yuanhua's face changed instantly—the cruelty of the Imperial Prison was famous during the time when Wei Zhongxian was in charge in the Tianqi era. Although Wei Zhongxian was gone now, it was still not a benevolent place. Even if his teacher and friends saved him and the Emperor was wise enough to spare him the death penalty, he would be a crippled man coming out of the Imperial Prison.

Anyone willing to do things usually had a strong desire for fame and merit. Being dismissed from office was fine—fortunes in the Imperial Court turned like a wheel. He was not old and his health was still good. As long as he actively maneuvered, there would always be a chance for reinstatement in the future. If his body was broken, then there would be absolutely no chance.

"Sir is a pillar of our Holy Church in China. If anything happens to Sir, the millions of lambs on this vast land of Huaxia will suddenly lose their reliance..." Lu Wenyuan said with a look of heartbreak.

This speech indeed moved Sun Yuanhua. He was in his prime and planned to accomplish something, whether for the country, the people, or the Church. Of course, he was unwilling to withdraw just like this.

But thinking of his current situation, he felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave—he had lost all his subordinates and was penniless. Apart from the two young servants who claimed to have been rescued, there wasn't a single person he could command.

This Master Lu before him was certainly young and promising, and unknown methods had been used to fish him out of Dengzhou City, but he was just a country gentleman after all. Even if he had trained braves, at best, they could barely protect themselves.

However, he still had some troops in Laizhou. Although the force was small, as long as he got there and reopened his yamen, he could regain control over the local prefectures of the Three Eastern Prefectures that had fallen into chaos. He could also reconnect with Shandong Governor Yu Dacheng. Yu Dacheng had always been friendly with him, and once the rebel army grew powerful, the Three Western Prefectures would also be hard-pressed to remain safe. Yu Dacheng would definitely support him strictly.

But saying is one thing. To travel from within Huang County to Laizhou with only two young servants in this turmoil of war without a small detachment for protection would be suicide; he wouldn't make it out of Huang County alive.

Of course, he could also try to get to the nearest Huang County seat first. The magistrate of Huang County knew him and would surely give him help—it was just that there wouldn't be many troops in the county seat: there hadn't been a garrison there originally. Whatever the magistrate had was nothing more than a hundred or so mounted and foot constables, plus temporarily rallied village braves.

The rebels were mostly cavalry. Foot-traveling village braves had no power to resist at all. Once chased by cavalry, the braves could neither win nor run.

There was another path, which was to flee to the sea. The garrisons on the various islands belonging to the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou would obey his orders. As long as they could be gathered in time, he didn't worry about not being able to fight back to Dengzhou in time.

As long as he could retake Dengzhou at the fastest speed, the two Grand Secretaries Xu and Zhou at the Imperial Court would have some room to maneuver—even if he ended up with a dismissal punishment, it would be better than being shackled and taken to the capital for interrogation.

It was just that fleeing to the sea required a ship. He wondered if this Manor Lord Lu had ships available.

He had a mind to ask, but then he thought about how he was rescued from Dengzhou City—he still wasn't clear on that.

Although he was a fellow believer, his years of experience and lessons as an official told him not to easily reveal his true intentions.

Thinking of this, he adjusted his attire and cupped his hands: "Mr. Lu, great kindness needs no thanks. You saved Sun, which is also saving the people of these three prefectures of Dengzhou and Laizhou; the merit is boundless. Someday, if Sun can return to the Imperial Court, I will definitely request a title for Sir..."

Lu Wenyuan felt a bit disgusted in his heart, thinking *you officials always habitually appoint yourselves as representatives*. But he smiled very modestly.

Sun Yuanhua suddenly felt a stir in his heart. Since this Manor Lord Lu could rescue him from Dengzhou, he was definitely not as simple as an ordinary gentry. He stopped speaking more for the moment.

Seeing the change in his eyes, Lu Wenyuan knew he hadn't fully gained his trust yet, which was also expected—anyone who could become a high official was a shrewd person and would never trust him completely based on just a few words. He didn't say more, just asked him to rest well first. If he needed anything, he should speak up. Then he instructed Cheng Lingsu to escort Sun Yuanhua back to his residence.

"I would like to walk around the manor. Does Sir allow it?" Sun Yuanhua asked suddenly.

"Sir is the parent official of this locality, why not?" Lu Wenyuan smiled broadly. "Except the sea breeze here is very biting. The student will have someone send outdoor clothing immediately."

Sun Yuanhua returned to his residence and saw his two young servants and Sun Yuan were all there. The reunion of master and servants inevitably brought a wave of sadness. Sun Yuanhua originally had many maids and servants in Dengzhou—scholars in the Ming Dynasty used a large number of servants. When a Juren from Jiangnan went out, he would be accompanied by more than ten servants, and that was considered quite frugal. As a Governor, not counting the personal soldiers and family retainers selected in Dengzhou, Sun Yuanhua had seventy or eighty male and female slaves. After the city fell, some died, some fled. To show good treatment, Kong Youde specifically recruited the scattered servants for him, but in the end, only these three were found.

Seeing that all three had changed into clean new clothes and had rosy complexions, it was obvious that Manor Lord Lu treated them well too. He felt quite gratified in his heart.

"You've suffered!" Sun Yuanhua said. "I didn't give you any benefits, yet you shared adversity with me." He sighed endlessly as he spoke.

Sun Yuan said: "The master's well-being is our blessing, and also the blessing of the people of Shandong."

Sun Yuanhua smiled bitterly and didn't speak again—Sun Yuan was just one of his family retainers—he had two or three hundred such personal soldiers and family retainers, selected from the battalion soldiers of Dengzhou and Laizhou and the Liaodong people.

Now these personal soldiers and family retainers had probably all defected to the rebel army. Thinking that his New Army, which he had painstakingly managed for years, was reduced to just one Sun Yuan, Sun Yuanhua couldn't help but feel dejected.

He returned to the room and asked about the events of the previous night. The young servants and Sun Yuan hid nothing and recounted their experiences of the night in detail. The three of them talked all at once, taking nearly an hour to finish.

Sun Yuanhua remained silent. Warriors dressed entirely in black, scaling walls and entering from outside the city silently in the dark night, coming and going amidst a great army as if entering an uninhabited land... No matter how he looked at it, it seemed like sword-heroes from strange tales. If it weren't for the fact that these three people told the same story and it was hard to find flaws in it, he would have simply thought they were making it up.

Although half-believing and half-doubting, Sun Yuanhua already understood in his heart: This Manor Lord Lu introduced by Father Gilbert de Pantoja/Guo Jujing was definitely not an ordinary person. Connecting this with the fact that he came from Guangdong, he already had some vague ideas in his mind.

He put on the sheepskin vest brought by Cheng Lingsu—the Lingao Clothing Factory had made a batch of leather vests using Persian sheepskin imported by the Dutch specifically for the northern troops to block wind and keep warm. The quantity was small, reserved for night sentries.

The door curtain rustled, and Cheng Lingsu entered to report: "A friend of Manor Lord Lu wants to see Sir, saying he will accompany Sir for a walk in the manor."

"Please come in quickly."

A young man who had just reached adulthood entered. Although he wore a Unity Hat (Liuhoye Yitongmao), the hair roots revealed at his temples made Sun Yuanhua somewhat understand who the visitor probably was.

The dashing youth was exactly Lu Yang. Seeing Sun Yuanhua wearing a sheepskin vest, he couldn't help but feel it looked very incongruous, but of course, he didn't show it, otherwise, it would be too rude.

Lu Yang bowed: "Mr. Huodong, I have looked up to your great name for a long time." Huodong was Sun Yuanhua's alias. "Looking up to his great name" wasn't polite talk either. Although he didn't have a deep impression of Sun Yuanhua before, as a member of the Northbound Detachment who needed to be cold-resistant, Lyu Yang, who grew up in Ningxia, was promoted to Navy Lieutenant ahead of time. Officers of the Northbound Detachment had to read materials on the Rebellion of Dengzhou, so he had some understanding of Sun Yuanhua.
