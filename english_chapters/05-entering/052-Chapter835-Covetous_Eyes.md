# Chapter 835: Covetous Eyes

To avoid squeezing the tight shipyard slipways, and more importantly, to avoid taking up the limited shipbuilding workers, the new fishing boats used by the fishery cooperative were not replicas of any old-time-space model but were old-time-space two-masted ships retired from the Navy—in fact, the Navy's direct fishing fleet also used old-style ships. But the fishery cooperative and the Navy's fishing fleet were all equipped with new types of fishing nets: drift nets, trawl nets, and gill nets.

Some of these fishing nets were brought from the old time-space, and some were imitated by the Light Industry Department's textile factory. But during the imitation process, the materials could never meet the standards. Whether it was flax, jute, or hemp, all had the problem of insufficient strength and poor corrosion resistance when used to make fishing net ropes.

The seemingly simple modern fishing nets, without the support of nylon products, were not only reduced in size but also very short-lived. Although the Light Industry Department used coal tar to preserve the fishing nets according to the materials they found, and used improved rope-twisting technology and equipment, the imitated fishing nets still had to "fish for three days and dry nets for two days." Everyone found that this saying actually had a basis; if they fished every day, fishing nets made from purely natural green materials would quickly be completely scrapped.

Modern large fishing nets and gear also required a lot of supporting equipment. Simple examples included winches for hauling nets—although winches could be operated by human power, the layout of old-style ships could not accommodate these devices.

Although the fishery cooperative got new fishing nets, the overall performance was discounted. Even with the discount, after using the new nets and catching methods, the fishermen's catchable range was greatly increased compared to before when they could only catch fish in shallow surface layers. Under the guidance of the Navy's fishing fleet, the cooperative fishermen who tried the new fishing methods and gear for the first time immediately achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Such a large catch could only be obtained during "fishing seasons" in the past.

After tasting the sweetness, the fishery cooperative fishermen were easily enticed to go fish in broader waters. Traditional fishermen, due to limited navigation capabilities, small boats, and a lack of equipment and means to store catches, rarely left nearshore waters when fishing.

To increase catches, fishing grounds had to be expanded. Fishing only around Hainan Island would always have limited output. At the suggestion of Lin Chuanqing, head of the Navy's fishing fleet, the fishery cooperative organized fishing fleets. They prepared to go to deep-sea fishing in an organized formation. The first targets were the Gulf of Tonkin waters and the Dongsha and Xisha waters.

The Tiandihui sent Dugu Qiuhun to Hongji to set up a fishery station there. This would serve as a port for the fishery cooperative fishermen to rest, repair boats, take shelter from storms, and process catches while fishing in the Gulf of Tonkin. Of course, in the long term, the most suitable location should be Haiyang—the Haiphong Port of the old time-space.

Besides increasing catches by establishing a fishery station in Hongji, the Navy also hoped to use Hongji as a base to gradually penetrate and integrate the local fishermen of the Gulf of Tonkin through purchasing local fishermen's catches, selling supplies, providing boat repair services, small loans, and the hard and soft approaches of mandatory fishing taxes. The Gulf of Tonkin originally had many Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen fishing there. In the history of the old time-space, the fishermen of the Gulf of Tonkin, regardless of nationality, had always been one of the main sources of pirates in the South China region. Local pirates had once even shone brightly during the Tay Son dynasty in Vietnam, becoming the Tay Son regime's maritime force.

Not long after Dugu Qiuhun arrived in Hongji, the first fishing fleet from the fishery cooperative arrived in Hongji. This was an experimental small fleet consisting of 14 fishing boats, the largest only about a hundred tons, and the smallest only thirty-odd tons. But they were well-equipped and tightly organized. Besides dedicated fishing boats, there were several boats specifically carrying salt and barrels for processing catches. Light boats served as scout boats, conducting experimental fishing in various places to determine where the catches were richest.

The fishing fleet was escorted by two Type I Bermuda sloop patrol boats of the Navy, ensuring that no one could disturb the cooperative fishermen.

The cooperative's fishing fleet's experimental fishing operation in Yalong Bay was a great success. In fact, they were full and heading back in less than four days. This success made the Agricultural Department and the Tiandihui, who originally wanted to observe the effect of fishing in the Gulf of Tonkin, immediately spring into action—deciding to immediately increase investment in Hongji and set up a catch processing factory there.

The development of Hongji expanded rapidly like a snowball that could not be stopped. Very soon, more than a dozen large and medium-sized ships were regularly sailing on the Lingao-Hongji route. They shipped out coal and brought in various materials needed for Hongji's construction. After shipping over one hundred laborers, Beikai telegraphed the Planning Institute, requesting that they stop sending pure manual laborers—farmers from the Beiqi area were constantly coming, many even bringing their families. And the Dachang Rice Shop in Haiyang was continuously bringing workers recruited locally. The source of labor was quite abundant. Beikai even discovered that among the laborers sent from Haiyang, besides local Beiqi farmers, there were also many Ming citizens from Guangxi—this place was actually not far from Guangxi, and many of the border people crossed to Guangxi to make a living.

Beikai requested: The naturalized citizen laborers transported from Lingao should at least have a Class C diploma. At the same time, send some naturalized citizens or Senators who could serve as instructors for the laborers. According to the plan, naturalized citizen laborers, after selection and training, would gradually take on the administrative, management, and security work in Hongji. In addition, he proposed a plan to cultivate local laborers: gradually select reliable and capable local Beiqi laborers for training—if necessary, send them back to Lingao for training. Using their advantage of being familiar with local conditions, they could serve as "guides" for a large-scale assault on Vietnam in the future. This plan also included local children: Beikai requested permission to select some children from the families of Beiqi laborers who came to Hongji and send them to Lingao for training.

The Agricultural Department quickly set up a small fish processing factory in Hongji, using local women as labor. Part of the fresh catch from the fishing fleet was processed directly on-site to supply protein to the Cooperative cafeteria. Based on the experience of the Lingao labor cafeteria, whole fish was also not supplied here. All catches went through cutting and deep processing, supplying fish balls, fish patties, and fish fillets. The remaining fish bones and offal were processed into fish sauce and fishmeal.

The Long-Range Exploration Team Office also set up a point in Hongji, with Bai Guoshi in charge. His task was to replace the not-so-professional Beikai and conduct a comprehensive exploration of the coal mining resources in the entire Guang'an area. To let him work with peace of mind, Liu Zheng simply sent Zhao Xue, the girlfriend Bai Guoshi had worked hard to win over, along with him—men and women working together makes work less tiring. Liu Zheng's instructions to them were to focus on exploring shallow surface coal mines near the coast for now.

Amidst the feverish development, You Long and You Hai were wandering around the outskirts of the mine. They had been working in Hongji for several days now. Their income, besides being enough to eat their fill, could also afford a small drink or two. Life was pretty good.

These two were actually spies sent by Shen Hu. The rapid development of Hongji Station was temporarily ignored by Northern Court officials busy with their southward campaign, but the large gathering of population, the ships constantly coming and going, and the scene of fishing boats returning fully loaded with bumper catches each time stimulated the various devils and demons in the area. Hongji Station had now become a piece of fat meat. Bandits on shore, pirates at sea, and local bullies all had greedy desires for this town that had suddenly risen in a few months. While Beikai was enthusiastically building, secret alliances were quietly forming among the various forces in the Hongji-Haiyang area.

The two spies currently lived in the quarantine camp and could only work on the road construction site every day. They could only get close to the outer ditch of Hongji Fort after work to look at the walls and watchtowers. Among the several targets, the miners' village and quarantine camp had nothing valuable. The shops along the road between the fort and the miners' village were certainly nice, but probably didn't have too many valuable goods. The two felt that the most valuable things should be inside this fort.

But looking at the heavily guarded appearance of this fort, it would probably not be easy to capture. You Long and You Hai belonged to Shen Hu's mountain stronghold—this was a local bandit gang. This gang included scattered soldiers from the Northern Court, runaway farmers from manors, and mighty bandits from the Ming in Guangxi, forming a mixed bandit gang of four or five hundred people.

With only the Shen Hu bandit gang, they wouldn't dare to move against Hongji at all. Hongji had cannons, a fort, and several hundred regularly drilling militia. The Shen Hu bandit gang, besides being able to eat their fill, couldn't even get a decent set of clothes. They all dressed in rags, almost like beggars.

But this time, several other small forces in the area were participating together. In particular, they also had the help of the half-fishing, half-pirate pirates from Jiangping. They were envious of the fishing gear and boats used by the newcomers.

At a joint conference of all parties, the forces participating in the two-pronged land and sea attack on Hongji finally totaled two thousand men and forty boats, half land and half sea. Shen Hu roughly knew there were about a thousand miners on the Hongji side, most of whom were local commoners. They wouldn't necessarily risk their lives for the people in the fort. When the time came, they would surely surrender or scatter. All they had to deal with were the two or three hundred people inside the fort. According to a few bandits who had come from the Ming, this group came from Lingao. They were the so-called "Australians."

These few bandits who came from the Ming were none other than Gou Xunli and Hu Lanyan. After the large-scale security cleanup campaign in Danzhou City, the bandit gang could hardly maintain a foothold in Danzhou. Villages had either established joint guarantees or been consolidated. The bandit gang's room for operation was getting smaller and smaller. The villages where they used to hide, rest, and replenish supplies had now all closed their gates. Unless they hid in the deep mountains and never came out, as soon as they appeared near a populated settlement, it wouldn't take long before large groups of Australians would launch a cleanup operation in the area.
