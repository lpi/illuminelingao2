# Chapter 847 The Sinners

"Working overtime every night, this gas bill is terrible." Dean Wu was fairly satisfied with the Jesuit priests' work, but had some complaints about their working at night as well—the pious priests refused to give up their daytime work of preaching and spreading the faith, insisting on leaving the art work for nighttime. This made Dean Wu somewhat pained—the Fuel Department refused to give discounts on gas fees to religious venues under the Religious Affairs Office system, and refused to charge at "internal allocation price," insisting on charging at "general commercial" rates.

And the Lingao Church system received almost no fiscal appropriation support: more than ninety percent of expenses had to be self-raised by the Lingao Church. Of course, Dean Wu had the support of the Jesuits, this big money source, from manpower to finances. Otherwise Dean Wu really didn't know how to maintain the church's operations. The church's properties were limited, and the believers developed were mostly poor people and Li tribespeople, though they were "fanatical" in terms of piety, they couldn't produce much money for offerings.

"Have to make Propaganda and the Architecture Department fork out some blood," he muttered to himself, "and Hu Qingbai's place too. Have Father Jin give sculpture and art classes, charging some fees on the side..."

The entrance of Gonzalez and Trini perked him up. He naturally knew about the recent arrival of the Dutch East India Company representatives. Not only did he know, he had also seen photos and brief introductions of the three main representatives. So the moment these two entered, he recognized them.

The Spaniards and Italians were both Catholics, so from the moment the *Magdeburg* submitted its crew list and accepted quarantine, the Political Security Bureau and Colonial Trade Department had issued notices, reminding the various Catholic churches in Lingao that Gonzalez and Trini might enter the church, asking all departments to prepare reception and propaganda work.

Wu Shimang had presided over church work for several years and had dealt with Europeans the most, understanding their religious sentiments very well. Spaniards were especially noted for their strong religious sentiments, so after just a few words upon entering, this old Spanish soldier rogue became so emotionally moved he almost had tears in his eyes. Mr. Trini, being Italian, wasn't very religiously zealous, but during the several years in Batavia, he had absolutely no religious freedom, being forced to participate in Protestant ceremonies every day, feeling very repulsed. This made him fervent about his originally not-much-cared-about Catholic faith.

Wu Shimang had done marketing in the old dimension, worked as a human resources trainer, and originally had a full set of smooth-talking skills. In this dimension, he had long been immersed among religious people, seeing missionaries most frequently. His skill at fooling people had advanced even further, and in no time at all he made these two Europeans feel incomparably warm in their hearts.

As for Father Jin Lige and his disciples who were working, being able to see two fellow believers from Europe lands thousands of miles away, they were naturally also very pleased. Both sides soon struck up conversation. The three talked happily in Italian, which they all understood. Wu Shimang stood aside with a charming smile—though he couldn't understand a single word, he didn't mind at all. Because he carried a voice recorder with him. Soon the three people's conversation content would be delivered to the Political Security Bureau, where Senators who understood Italian would be asked to translate.

The two visited the church, praising its scale and structure considerably. Trini particularly noted the details. As an Italian draftsman, he himself was proficient or passable in multiple crafts—this was a common characteristic of Italian artists since the Renaissance. A painter was often also sculptor, metalworker, architect, or even engineer. Da Vinci was merely the best among them.

Trini looked at the murals and sculptures under construction on the walls, revealing a somewhat contemptuous smile. In this professional artist's view, Father Jin Lige and his disciples' level was still lacking a bit. Jesuit missionaries going to China and Japan learned astronomy, mathematics, physics, and art for missionary purposes before going to East Asia, but their professional standards were generally not very high.

Although out of courtesy he didn't comment on this. He shifted his gaze from the walls to other places and soon noticed the stained glass windows being installed on both sides of the chapel under construction. The patterns were not of religious subjects, but large landscapes—somewhat similar to the simplified line-style paintings Trini had seen on medieval tapestries: boundless fields rolling with golden waves of wheat; many red houses with huge chimneys standing; densely packed orchards on green hillsides with white flocks of sheep below; boats returning with full loads on the azure sea...

These patterns were simple yet bright, very different from traditional church decorative glass windows. Trini observed carefully, trying to figure out the meaning expressed within. Obviously, these glass mosaic paintings were expressing a beautiful and abundant life...

Under the glow of gas lamps, climbing on scaffolding and carefully installing glass into the iron glass frames were a group of women and half-grown children. They wore uniform undyed plain cloth short jackets. Each one silently and carefully installed and fixed glass pieces to the frames.

"Who are they?" Trini asked, feeling somewhat surprised. Obviously these people were not monks or nuns. But there was some aura of asceticism emanating from them.

"Some poor sinners." Father Jin Lige made the sign of the cross, "May God save their souls."

These people were "bandit dependents"—"sinners"—under the Monastery's management. Starting from the Thirteen Villages bandit suppression, bandits with less serious offenses were released home after education and hard labor for a period upon capture; those meeting conditions were accepted for recruitment or enlistment. But the families of those extremely evil bandits killed in the suppression had to receive "special disposition." Young and middle-aged men were sent to labor camps and organized into specialized labor teams. Women and minors were transferred to the Lingao Monastery for "re-education" and "reformation" while doing some simple work. The purpose was brainwashing, weakening the hatred mentality, so they could become useful people in society in the future, rather than "destabilizing factors."

Although "reformation" work was placed in the monastery, it was actually jointly managed by several departments. The guiding department was the Political Security Bureau. After a period, the Security Bureau would evaluate and score the "sinners." Those considered well "reformed," meeting the IVB level—"unreliable, but usable"—would be released and relocated to new locations for resettlement. Those considered to have "insignificant educational effects" would be transferred to labor camps for "disposal."

The priests didn't oppose this work—in Europe, monasteries taking in and watching over "sinners" was not uncommon. Moreover, the priests believed that the Australian secular government being willing to hand this work over to the Church to handle was reliance on and trust in the Church, so they were actually quite enthusiastic about "reformation work."

As for Dean Wu, he naturally didn't oppose it even more; for him it was free labor. The "sinners" worked in dedicated shoe and garment factories opened by the Light Industry Department, paying the Church a fee per head as their food and clothing expenses. The remainder naturally sponsored church construction. So Dean Wu was very satisfied with this system.

During the pacification operations in northern Qiong, there was a constant stream of "sinners" being sent over. Initially personnel accepted were limited to "bandit dependents," but later the group expanded to families of all "hostile elements" that were eliminated. So Dean Wu always maintained a considerable number of "sinners" here.

Mr. Trini, however, was quite moved. He also made the sign of the cross, murmuring prayers. At this time, Gonzalez spoke: "Father, I wish to confess."

When the two left, they donated ten Spanish reales to the church.

"Only ten Spanish silver coins!" Wu Shimang smiled broadly seeing them off, but inwardly was quite contemptuous—he had originally thought that with Gonzalez's demeanor he would at least produce fifty silver coins. Just now Father Jin Lige had even heard their confessions—these two had been under the Dutch for a long time, forced to perform Protestant religious ceremonies, and didn't observe fasting according to Catholic rules, feeling very uneasy, so they made a thorough confession. As for the contents of the confession, he wouldn't know until tomorrow noon—the Senator who understood Italian wouldn't listen to the recording until tomorrow morning. If any secrets could be leaked, he, the great general of the Religious Affairs Office, would get first credit...

Wu Shimang was very dissatisfied with current religious work—even felt he had chosen the wrong promotion path back then. He originally intended to transform the Catholic Church into the "State Church" of the future Transmigrator Empire. For this he had long ago drafted many specific plans and schemes, including how future dioceses would be divided, how church property would be managed, etc. Dean Wu had even selected the address of the future "Holy City." Even the Crusader Army had a blueprint. In his conception, the future State Church would be an important force guaranteeing the Transmigrator Empire for thousands of generations. The Church's monk knight orders and Crusader Army would be the Senate's "shield and sword." Of course, he couldn't be so tacky as not to think of armed nuns too... In short, very ambitious.

But the Senate kept a very tight hold on the religious system, having absolutely no intention of establishing a State Religion. Nor did they allow him to act freely—they even created a "Neo-Daoism" to muddy the waters. This made Wu Shimang very disappointed. Regarding religious expertise, he was obviously no match for Daoqianzi, who was well-versed in Daoist classics and had a systematic approach to reforming the texts. In what he considered his strongest areas—organization, management, and operation—the Senate had many restrictions. After much thought, Wu Shimang figured that if he didn't plan to jump ship from the religious system, the best approach was still large-scale expansion of believers—especially in Li areas and "New Zones." The Senate believed that missionary work helped stabilize rule over unstable areas. At the same time, the better the missionary results, the more resources he could obtain from the Jesuits.
