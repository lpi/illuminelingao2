# Chapter 1136 - Kaohsiung Development

The Navy's demands squeezed Wei Bachi's limited human resources. Wei Bachi was very reluctant to see resources consumed by the Navy, but under the big hat of "Operation Engine," he couldn't refuse the Navy's requests. Moreover, he knew very well that without the First Fleet's existence, there would be no Kaohsiung City.

The carriage drove into the courtyard in front of City Hall. The ceremonial guards at the gate saluted simultaneously. A naturalized citizen wearing an open-collared tropical cadre uniform came out to welcome them into the main hall.

Wei Bachi asked, "Is the banquet ready?"

"According to your instructions, the reception is set on the rooftop terrace."

The group went up to the City Hall's rooftop terrace—an awning had been set up here, with rattan tables and chairs arranged neatly underneath. The sea breeze blowing from the ocean felt very comfortable. A sumptuous meal had already been laid on the table. Fine water droplets coated the chilled bottles of kvass and lemonade.

Zhong Lishi and the others, who had lost their appetites eating "seafaring rations" on the ship, saw the table full of good food and drink and their eyes turned green. Dropping pleasantries with Wei Bachi, they took their seats and began to eat heartily.

The main dish was venison—Taiwan's second largest export after deerskins. Venison was almost entirely lean meat with little fat, tasting relatively light and suitable for the hot climate here.

Dr. Zhong noted that while the venison, pheasant, seafood, and vegetables on the table were plentiful, the cooking was very simple and the seasoning not rich—still at the level of "big fish and big meat." He felt even more strongly that he was casting pearls before swine. He was originally a gourmet; after a few years in Lingao, finding the Committee canteen food dull, he had long since started cooking for himself at home.

Seeing that ingredients here were fairly abundant, he couldn't help but first calculate how to arrange his own life here.

Looking out from here, one could see the general outline of Wei Bachi's territory. Although City Hall was magnificent, and the square, roads, and docks looked decent, looking out at the entire Kaohsiung City revealed a massive shantytown—albeit a strictly regulated one. The buildings occupying Kaohsiung's main area were rows upon rows of unadorned stilt wooden houses coated with coal tar. Among them were scattered some two-story wooden houses. Taiwan had many typhoons, earthquakes, and mudslides; these wooden houses were more adapted to the environment.

The entire Kaohsiung City area was surrounded by earthen ramparts, bamboo fences, and moats. Along the line were wooden thatched watchtowers. Centered on such a city, some farmland and plantations had already been opened up around it. One could see unfinished, slightly messy roads, trenches, and canals. Farther out along the roads, several settlements—recently built standard villages—were visible.

The only places that "looked like a city" were this City Hall, the docks, and a commercial street outside the northwest city gate.

Further out was a vast expanse of barren plain, with most vegetation still in its original state. Sitting on the roof of a European-style city hall in the center of such a city, dressed neatly and drinking chilled lemonade served by maids and servants, the Committee members suddenly felt like British colonials.

However, the area they had reclaimed was pitifully small. Apart from the patch of land they occupied, even the developed farmland looked like mere scars on the skin of the wilderness's dense vegetation from the roof. The beaches were full of mangroves, and everywhere were dense banyan trees, cycads, bamboo...

Purely from a tourism perspective, what they saw now was exactly the pristine tropical coastal scenery loved by the petty bourgeoisie. But each of these men felt worried and under great pressure.

To build this so-called Kaohsiung City, which looked like an early medieval European town, into Taiwan's capital, a regional central city connecting Northeast and Southeast Asia, a naval base, and a political, economic, cultural, and industrial center, as well as the starting position for developing Taiwan—who knew how many years it would take?

As the group exchanged toasts, they asked about Kaohsiung's development. Wei Bachi inevitably sighed and complained again. Through his constant striving, the quota of migrants allocated to him for local settlement had been expanded to ten thousand. This finally gave him a larger basic team on top of the Tainan Agricultural Reclamation Regiment that had landed in the first wave.

But with more people came heavier tasks. These ten thousand people had to be settled after purification was complete, allocated to various settlements according to Wen Desi's standard village configuration, and organized into intensive state-owned farms. Wei Bachi knew that although the Agricultural Committee hadn't issued land reclamation targets, Kaohsiung faced the vast Jianan Plain—Taiwan's main agricultural region in the old timeline. Expectations for agriculture here were high from top to bottom. If he tossed and turned for a year without producing solid results, he wouldn't need to be Kaohsiung mayor anymore.

Wei Bachi calculated several times and set himself a target of reclaiming thirty thousand *mu* of wasteland by the end of 1632.

These thirty thousand *mu* of arable land, converted to his population of ten thousand, meant each person had to reclaim three *mu* in half a year.

This was a bit difficult for raw land with dense, original vegetation—especially since the vegetation here was very developed. Even after burning off, oxen often lacked the strength to plow, forcing reliance on manual hoeing.

"...Reclaiming land is heavy work and consumes tools. Except for the fully-equipped Tainan Regiment, I don't even have tools for the ten thousand people allocated to me..." Wei Bachi said. "Bai Yu said he'd give me a few steam tractors, but I don't know when they'll arrive. Fortunately, Feng Zongze is a good enough friend; the horses and oxen approved by the Planning Committee were sent immediately." He looked at the farmland outside the city. "If only we had tractors."

The group knew little about agriculture and naturally couldn't comment. Liu Zheng, however, was concerned about another matter.

"You're reclaiming land here; haven't those headhunting savages troubled you?"

According to Liu Zheng and most Committee members' thinking, after landing in Taiwan, Wei Bachi would inevitably have to play the role of a colonist exchanging glass beads for indigenous land. Unexpectedly, there had been no contact at all.

Wei Bachi shook his head. "Actually, no—the natives retreated from here long ago. I don't know why. The Special Reconnaissance Team reported there were originally native villages and rice paddies here. When we first landed, we found many places had indeed been cultivated. I don't know why they all ran inland."

Liu Zheng knew this. "They suffered at the hands of Ming pirates. Years ago, pirates landed and went to take heads; the pirates suffered losses and came back for revenge, slaughtering them like chopping melons and vegetables. So they ran inland. These savages don't know fear until you use knives!"

"Except for some people coming to peek quietly at the beginning, the natives here have basically not appeared. But they don't contact us or come to the market either." Wei Bachi took a cold towel from his life secretary and wiped the sweat from his forehead. "Last year, the *Haitian* had a fight with them here and killed quite a few. So now they hate and fear us. I heard from Han peddlers who come to trade: to the natives, we're about the same as demons. That's fine too; saves me from having to trick them into signing land deeds..."

Dr. Zhong smiled. "It's a matter of time. Don't say the natives are uncivilized; they have strong feelings for their land."

Fang Jinghan had been concerned about his survey mission. Hearing that peddlers had contact with natives, he was immediately interested—he needed a guide to conduct his survey trip. He immediately asked for details.

Wei Bachi said he had renovated a small port west of Kaohsiung City and then built a commercial street beside the port.

The purpose of this commercial street wasn't entirely to make money, but more to gather intelligence through trade with local Han people and natives, and incidentally see if he could develop a few "guides."

"How is the attitude of the nearby natives toward outsiders? Do they hunt heads?"

"I heard the natives say there are the so-called 'Eight Phoenix Mountain Tribes.' They don't have a headhunting custom. But they aren't very welcoming to outsiders; killing a stranger is commonplace for them." Wei Bachi said, "When the *Haitian* came for reconnaissance, they also suddenly attacked the scout team."
