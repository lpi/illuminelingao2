# Chapter 894 - Go/No-Go Gauge

To ensure indigenous workers could correctly master production essentials, Shi Jiantao had to invest greater capital than he anticipated. After communicating with elders in the industrial sector, everyone believed that merely training workers wasn't enough; the key was to provide simple and easy-to-use inspection equipment, enabling indigenous workshops to accurately and conveniently determine if their products met standards.

Solving this couldn't be done by purchasing and distributing standard measuring tools. Moreover, teaching them to use measuring tools was also a quite difficult process.

After discussion, the most suitable solution was to adopt specialized Go/No-Go gauges for inspection.

A Go/No-Go gauge is also an industrial measuring tool. In actual production of large batch products, using standard measuring tools—like vernier calipers, dial indicators, etc., with scales—to measure one by one is troublesome and inefficient. Generally, qualified products have a measurement range; those within this range are qualified. So enterprises often use Go gauges and No-Go gauges to measure based on product specifications.

When using, different dedicated Go/No-Go gauges are manufactured according to different workpiece requirements. For inspecting hole size, the upper limit of hole diameter tolerance is made into the No-Go end, and the lower limit is made into the Go end. During inspection: if the No-Go end can pass, it means the hole diameter is too large, unqualified, and cannot be reworked, only scrapped; if the Go end cannot pass, it means the hole diameter is too small, also unqualified, but can be made qualified through reworking.

When China and the Soviet Union fell out, a story widely circulated among Chinese folk saying China paid debt to the Soviet Union with agricultural products. When exporting apples, the Soviet side required every apple to be put into a box to test; only those fitting exactly were accepted. Those that couldn't fit or rattled inside were all unqualified.

Leaving aside whether this legend was true, in specific application, the box acted as a Go/No-Go gauge. This system began to be applied in European military industry starting from the 18th century. The origin of application was to unify specifications of shells and cannonballs to seek greater range. European artillerymen at the time realized that the smaller the windage of the shell in the bore, the better the range and shooting accuracy. To inspect on a large scale whether cannonballs met standards in arsenals, dedicated measuring tools similar to Go/No-Go gauges were used in large quantities: snap gauges, ring gauges, etc.

Now they used the same method, but made even more "idiot-proof." Ensuring anyone could understand completely after listening and seeing once. These dedicated Go/No-Go gauges were all made of iron to ensure the material itself didn't have large deformation, with new adjustments made on tolerance regulations: wood structure items themselves had large deformation with temperature and humidity.

Besides promoting dedicated Go/No-Go gauges, Shi Jiantao also placed orders for several dedicated production tools and equipment with the General Machinery Plant. Including improved versions of woodworking tools and pedal-operated woodturning lathes for use by indigenous shipbuilding workshops.

Indigenous workers training in Hong Kong tested the equipment and measuring tools on the spot—the effect was significant. Shi Jiantao was so happy he grabbed the hand of the General Machinery Plant elder delivering the goods and shook it straight, simply like the Northern Shaanxi Red Army meeting the Central Red Army in Wuqi. The shopkeepers and foremen of indigenous shipbuilding workshops were also so happy they couldn't find North: originally everyone felt hope of working for Australians was slim, now suddenly discovering they could still make money—Australian lords indeed had plenty of methods just like the legends. One by one, they expressed they would absolutely produce according to standards.

The shipped Go/No-Go gauges, woodworking tools, and wood lathes were all sold to shipbuilding workshops at a price—not cheap, but not exceeding their capability level. Shi Jiantao very benevolently stipulated they could owe the payment first, deducting it from processing fees later.

Borrowing this east wind, Shi Jiantao pushed a whole set of outsourcing management systems. All ship part suppliers received a material code authorization. This code authorization required paying a one tael silver certification fee. Each workshop as a designated outsourcing manufacturer of Hong Kong Shipyard must pass qualification inspection; inspection fee was ten taels of silver.

Of course, if a shipbuilding workshop didn't purchase tools and production equipment provided by the shipyard and didn't conduct worker training, this qualification was hard to reach. So the shipyard also provided "Qualification Review Consulting" and "Training Agency" commercial services; naturally these also cost money.

These fees could also be offset against processing fees, which still had certain attraction to indigenous workshop owners with weak economic strength. Shi Jiantao's vision was to attract Pearl River Delta indigenous shipbuilding workshops to participate as much as possible, gradually improving their production technology and management level, enabling them to fully support the Senate's main industries. Making the entire Pearl River Delta's indigenous shipbuilding industry, except for a few workshops specializing in manufacturing/repairing small boats, all become supporting outsourcing enterprises for Hong Kong Shipyard. Ultimately, promoting the Senate's shipbuilding standards to the entire Guangdong, controlling and transforming all indigenous shipbuilding industry.

Despite adopting new improvement measures, handicraft industry in an agricultural society keeping up with the pace of industrialized production was after all a very difficult thing. Although outsourced parts had qualified products, the qualification rate always hovered around 40%, and delivery cycles were also very slow, universally delayed.

Shi Jiantao had to focus his main energy on patrolling and rectifying outsourcing enterprises. He sometimes rode a steam launch, sometimes a schooner patrol boat, moving near the Pearl River Estuary under Marine protection, patrolling various shipbuilding workshops. Providing improvement requirements and suggestions anytime and anywhere. Within two months, Hong Kong Shipyard issued 13 rectification yellow cards, and dispatched over 100 person-times of technicians to various factories for guidance. Multiple training classes were held. Before summer arrived, the qualification rate of outsourced parts finally rose to 60%. This figure finally let him breathe a sigh of relief—although completing Planning Commission orders on time was still difficult at this level, at least there was hope.

While Shi Jiantao concentrated full effort on shipbuilding, a new wave of construction arose on Hong Kong Island. This time, it was comprehensive expansion of logistics and shipping facilities.

Because of its geographical location, Hong Kong Island was the general logistical supply base in Operation Engine. Various materials expected to supply Zhejiang, Taiwan, Jeju Island, and Shandong were prepared to ship from Hong Kong Island. Warehouses and freight facilities originally only for stationing military land reclamation teams and small military reserves appeared very insufficient. New warehouses, cargo yards, and wharf trestles were constantly being newly built.

Hong Huangnan busied himself in Guangzhou for over ten days, wanting to set up his Carriage 4S Shop in Guangzhou. But Guo Yi, head of Guangzhou Station, had little interest in the 4S Shop itself—or rather thought Hong Huangnan was daydreaming. So he only superficially enthusiastically expressed he would put the 4S Shop as a "key project" in the newly built "Great World." But the Great World project was just at the stage of digging earth, filling material, and laying foundations; however one looked, this project wouldn't be finished until 1632, so the 4S Shop effectively became flowers in a mirror or moon in water. Hong Huangnan sighed over his proposal every day.

The news of the establishment of the Joint Logistics Headquarters and his appointment as Minister didn't make him happy either—although this position's rank was equivalent to Dongmen Chuiyu's status. In the past he only held the title of Chief Staff Officer, merely coming up with ideas and plans, belonging to people who contributed effort but bore no responsibility. Now becoming a formal department chief, responsibility was extraordinary—and appointed right before Operation Engine.

"This is harboring malicious intent." Hong Huangnan muttered to himself, looking out from the window of the fortress on Hong Kong Island.

Because he was in Guangzhou, extremely close to Hong Kong Island. So according to the Military Affairs Directorate's order, Hong Huangnan became the person directly responsible for Operation Engine logistical support.

Standing in a suite reserved for elders on the upper level of the five-story fortress watching Saintess Bay was a very pleasant thing, but thinking of shouldering the entire logistical work of Operation Engine made Hong Huangnan feel his head swell several sizes.

Hong Kong Island's so-called "logistical advantage" was only in geographical conditions. Compared to Hainan Island tucked in a corner, Hong Kong Island's distance was moderate, having a natural deep-water port, certain water sources on the island, and located in the resource-rich Pearl River Delta. Apart from this, material conditions to apply to logistical supply were nonexistent.

Whether extra warehouses, wharves, or other corresponding supporting facilities, none existed here; all had to be rushed to completion before the curtain of Operation Engine formally opened. Of course, building houses wasn't his business; the General Construction Company originally had a construction team on Hong Kong Island responsible by Shi Dafu. Now new construction teams and elders were sent to reinforce; according to Hong Huangnan's estimate, completing on time shouldn't be a problem.

The problem was that reserves, allocation, and transport plans for materials were still blank. The Planning Commission had informed him a few days ago they could prepare 9000 tons of brown rice and miscellaneous grains for Operation Engine. But the total amount of other materials needed, how much each point needed, how varieties were arranged—all relied on his arrangement as Minister of Joint Logistics Headquarters to formulate specific supply plans.

"Dammit, I only have one orderly and one female secretary; can I do such a big job?" Hong Huangnan voiced dissatisfaction again in the elder's bedroom. A few days ago he had already sent a telegram asking Thorpe to transfer a logistics staff team to Hong Kong Island to form a Forward Command.

Thorpe replied with a "handle immediately" telegram at the time, then nothing followed. Hong Huangnan couldn't help becoming paranoid; was this guy plotting some conspiracy? When the Joint Logistics Headquarters was established, he was in Guangzhou, and Thorpe attended the ceremony. Did he, the "Vice Minister," have other tricks up his sleeve? Thinking again of his attitude in Logistics Command often posing "You're the leader, do whatever you love, anyway my opinion is here" to Fubo Army heads and Planning Commission leaders. He felt his guess was increasingly reasonable.
