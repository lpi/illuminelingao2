# Chapter 823 - Below Cat's Ear Mountain

Yan Maoda stood at the peak of Cat's Ear Mountain. This mountain was 400 meters high, steep, rugged, and difficult to climb. Yan Maoda climbed it to get a bird's-eye view of the terrain.

Cat's Ear Mountain was a landmark hill by the sea in Hongji. Legend had it that a "True Ancestor Emperor" had composed a "poem" here, and later crowds of so-called "famous scholars," "heroes," and "gallants" came to compose "poems," so locals euphemistically called it "Poem" Mountain. In the old timeline's 1950s, this mountain was linked to the Vietnamese revolution. According to some "revolutionary memoirs," during French rule, there was a flagpole on top. From the late 40s to early 50s, Viet Minh climbed up every May 1st and September 2nd to hang the "national flag."

"No need for a national flag here; we can put a lighthouse. Guide ships into port," Yan Maoda's secretary said. He looked down at the earth and ocean. Cat's Ear Mountain was a rocky hill, half protruding into Halong Bay. The coastline was dotted with hills and mounds; only a long, narrow strip of flat land, 2-3 kilometers long, lay along the sea at the foot of Cat's Ear Mountain. The Hongji City of the old timeline was here. And Hongji City was built gradually on the foundation of the French-established Hongji Coal Company.

"What river is that?" Yan Maoda pointed to a broad river entering the sea a few kilometers away.

"That's the Bach Dang River," Bei Kai said. "Also called the White Vine River. Legend says the yuan army was defeated by Tran Hung Dao at this estuary." Thanks to studying Vietnamese, he knew a bit of Vietnamese history.

"Oh, so it's an ancient battlefield. Seems the armed trading post carries big risks too." Yan Maoda watched the rolling river water. The river was wide, dotted with sandbars. The tide was rising; the rising seawater was yellow, the river water green, forming a clear boundary in the center—quite spectacular.

"Where's the best spot for the trading post?" Yan Maoda asked. As a member of the exploration team, Bei Kai had led a team here before and knew the geography well.

"The most suitable spot is naturally at the foot of the mountain, old timeline's Hongji City," Bei Kai pointed. "There's flat land for buildings and yards. Excellent port conditions. We can also draw water from the Bach Dang River nearby for coal washing and daily use."

"Defense?" Yan Maoda cared about this.

"Since it's a trading post, defenses should be moderate. Avoid attracting too much attention. Besides, if we make it too big and strong, not only does it require a huge setup, but also more troops." Bei Kai adjusted his hat. "Try peaceful means. The Executive Committee doesn't want a big fight here."

Yan Maoda nodded: "Indeed. Let's go down."

Below, *Zhennan*'s marines and sailors were building a temporary earth-walled enclosure on the shore, surrounded by a ditch filled with standard bamboo spikes. Prefabricated watchtowers were under urgent construction.

In the clearing inside the enclosure was a wooden house assembled from prefabs. This was Bei Kai's residence and office. The marines providing security lived in a wooden barracks on the other side.

Thinking he had to office here and direct development from this earth enclosure, Bei Kai was terrified—besides 30 marines and one 12-pound mountain howitzer, his most reliable asset was a silicon 2-watt radio operated by his maid. The thought of staying alone on this desolate coast brought unspeakable fear. But he couldn't chicken out now—if he let this opportunity to lead a region slip, becoming a regional bigwig later would be hard.

"Bear with it for now." Yan Maoda probably felt the facilities were a bit crude—if ten thousand Vietnamese troops really came, Bei Kai would be done for. "I'll arrange ships to bring construction materials, workers, and a garrison force immediately upon return."

Bei Kai braced himself to play the hero: "No problem. With 30 marines and a cannon, it's enough to hold off local bandits and pirates. The North Le Dynasty won't send a huge army against us for no reason."

"Supplies for expanding the base will arrive in three or four days—it's a short trip from Lingao!" Yan Maoda tried to reassure him. "Once back in Lingao, I'll send *Zhennan* back; it will be at your disposal. Zhang Dabala knows the sea and land routes here well; he'll be a capable assistant."

"That's great." Bei Kai was overjoyed. Having *Zhennan* and Zhang Dabala here was reassuring—at worst, he could flee on the ship. Mouth saying: "Zhang Dabala knows the routes, a very useful talent."

Yan Maoda looked around: "Where is the open-pit mine here?"

"Cat's Ear Mountain isn't an open-pit zone." Bei Kai had personally led the digging of test pits here last time and had first-hand data on coal distribution. "The Guang'an area is full of coal underground, but there are only a few open pits. The biggest is at Cam Pha—inland, 15 km from here."

"That far? I thought it was by the sea."

"There is coal by the sea too." Bei Kai said. "We dug test pits last time."

The test results showed coal seams under hills everywhere, but mostly deep, requiring shafts. It took Bei Kai a week to find an outcrop 3.5 km from Cat's Ear Mountain under a small hill. The face was small, max diameter less than 400 meters, but very shallow, with only 2 meters of overburden. It was the shallowest seam found within 5 km of Cat's Ear Mountain.

Escorted by marines, the two walked for over 20 minutes through weed-choked wasteland—fortunately, the strong sea breeze kept vegetation sparse and grass short. Yan Maoda could still faintly see traces of the path cleared before. Deep ruts from Purple Lightning carts were discernible in places.

At the foot of the hill, they saw a small excavated ring pit, bottom filled with water, now a stagnant pool. Weeds grew around it. Clearly no one had been here since Bei Kai left.

"We named this Cat Shit Pit No. 1." Bei Kai laughed. "Coal quality is good, all premium anthracite. Almost no impurities. Our *Dajing* crew dug a hundred tons in a week. Pity developing it requires big moves. We didn't have the strength to invest then, and later Old Chang negotiated the sugar-for-coal deal with the Vu family—Vu Ngoc Giap's estate has many mineable coal belts too."

"So the Hongji coal we use isn't actually from Hongji?"

"Hongji coal is just a commercial name." Bei Kai knew the history well. "Means coal shipped from Hongji. Actually it's coal from Guang'an—called Quang Ninh in this timeline. Real Hongji coal should come from Cam Pha—the biggest open pit in the Hongji mining area."

Yan Maoda looked. Four kilometers from here to the sea; they'd need a small railway to improve efficiency. Best to wash coal on-site—river water was available. He pondered and asked: "How much coal can this pit yield?"

"Bai Guoshi read our data and said at least 40-50 thousand tons extractable—conservatively."

"Fifty thousand tons!" Yan Maoda thought this figure was trivial in the old timeline—a 200MW thermal plant burned over 40 tons an hour at peak. Fifty thousand tons was two months' consumption. But for Lingao's industrial system, it was a massive resource. Especially since Hongji coal was high-calorific anthracite, much better than the inferior Guangdong lignite they used. It could fill a big gap in coal-chemical feedstock—currently, the Chemical Ministry's coal-coking plant ran at 40% capacity, limited by lack of coal.

"If this pit yields 100 tons a day, that's 3,000 tons a month. Enough for seven or eight months." Yan Maoda calculated.

"100 tons a day is too low. Wu De won't be satisfied." Bei Kai said. "If we use carts and light rails, even without animal power or other equipment, each miner can mine 1-1.2 tons a day. 100 workers with shovels can do it. I think at least 200 tons a day. Then the Executive Committee will feel developing Hongji is worthwhile. They might even allocate mechanized equipment, making 500 tons a day possible."

"At 200 tons a day, Cat Shit No. 1 only lasts three months. Then what? Go inland?"

Bei Kai had a plan: "Three months allows continued exploration. The ground here is full of coal; I believe we can find other open pits nearby. Also, the 50,000 tons is open-pit reserves; if we dig deeper, there are more seams. Just higher investment."

"In the long run, we'll eventually control the Hongji-Cam Pha region completely." Yan Maoda sat on a rock by the pit, looking at the black water. "How will you solve the miner issue?"

"Send a batch of naturalized miners as a core, then recruit locals." Bei Kai said. "Zhu Fuyuan says farmer life here is hard. Arable land is scarce around Hongji; they grow dry rice. Yields are low, taxes not light. Two crops of dry rice and one of miscellaneous grain aren't enough to eat; people starve every year. Should be able to recruit many. We just know too little about Tonkin."
