# Chapter 1035: Serving Dinner

The villages and towns along the route of Kong's sharp advance were inevitably ravaged by the fires of war—the mutinous soldiers, harboring resentment, vented all their hatred for the Shandong soldiers onto the local populace. The places they passed were left in ruins and devastation—though other places did not suffer directly from the disaster of war.

However, the news of the military chaos triggered panic throughout Huangxian. The city gates of the county seat were closed, and the people found places to hide. "Villains" from various villages and local bandits took the opportunity to make trouble, raping and looting everywhere. In the midst of panic and chaos, almost every village that had fortified itself for protection was flooded with large numbers of people dragging their families to seek refuge. The rich and the poor all fled to villages and towns with walls; no matter what, within the stockade walls, a pitiable remnant of order still remained.

Although Lu Wenyuan's stockade hadn't been up for long, the news that there was a stockade on the island guarded by local militia spread quickly. Moreover, Qimu Island was relatively remote. From the second day after Kong Youde's soldiers entered Huangxian, large numbers of refugees began supporting the old and carrying the young, bringing their belongings to Qimu Island for refuge.

Lu Wenyuan and the others had anticipated this situation and were prepared. Special large cauldrons shipped from Lingao boiled day and night with a gruel made of relief rations, dried sea blite, and all edible local vegetables and wild herbs. Refugees, regardless of wealth or poverty, could receive a wooden basin and a wooden spoon as soon as they entered the refugee camp and go to the cauldron to receive hot gruel.

This method saved many refugees suffering from hunger and cold, and also allowed many who still had grain but were freezing to death to save their lives.

Only two meals of gruel were rationed daily, with a caloric standard of only 1400 kilocalories. This amount of food could only ensure they didn't starve to death—Lu Wenyuan's intention was precisely this: once the loading and transfer operation began, if the refugees were all lively and energetic, there would be great trouble if they made a fuss. Now, keeping them half-dead ensured they were powerless to resist.

Because the food intake was too little and calories insufficient, the accommodation was relatively particular. Long wooden huts with *huodilong* heating systems were provided. Although not exactly warm as spring, at least they wouldn't freeze people to death. In the eyes of the refugees, the island owner was very compassionate: there was gruel to eat, fires to warm themselves, and proper houses to live in. Doctors patrolled daily, giving medicine to the sick, and infants who couldn't get breast milk were even rationed rice flour and sugar.

Compared to the arduous journey of braving the wind and snow on the roads, Qimu Island was a paradise.

But such days were not free. Lu Wenyuan knew very clearly that although the refugees were grateful to him now, as soon as the environment outside improved, they would quickly leave without looking back—as the saying goes, it is hard to leave one's native land. The Chinese people's attachment to their homeland is very strong; unless they are at a dead end, they are unwilling to leave their homes.

Therefore, he announced to the refugees that anyone who wished to take refuge on Qimu Island must sign a contract to work as his long-term laborer for three years; otherwise, they should leave the stockade immediately.

The various chaotic and terrifying scenes outside became vivid in the camp under the deliberate exaggeration of Lu Wenyuan and the others—he specially selected a group of local natives: choosing those with children and elderly to support, using an extra five pieces of relief sweet potato flour biscuits per person per day as bait, asking them to spread rumors among the refugees, guide public opinion, and incidentally collect the refugees' remarks.

The refugees were already exhausted and frightened by the various flying rumors of terror. Under the threat that refusing to sign the long-term labor contract meant no food and being driven out, Lu Wenyuan's study was soon piled high with documents covered in fingerprints.

For the vast majority of illiterate commoners, only heaven knew what was written on the documents. As for the few literate scholars: including students who repeatedly failed exams, abacus-wielding shopkeepers and clerks, fortune tellers, etc., they had been separated under the guise of "preferential treatment for scholars" and concentrated in a long house for supervision and use. This was partly to prevent these people from talking nonsense among the refugees, and on the other hand, the expanding refugee camp indeed needed their reading and writing skills. Lu Wenyuan gave them slightly better treatment to help handle paperwork and manage accounts. Thus, they wholeheartedly helped Master Lu harm others.

Next, he sent out many refugees: all with family burdens. Giving each of them some dry rations, he let them go to various places in Huangxian to promote and recruit people. Anyone who could bring back a refugee was given a relief biscuit as a reward. So these people worked desperately: the news that Qimu Island had food and safety guarantees quickly spread throughout Huangxian. Many commoners who had taken refuge in stockades and the county seat, having no food in hand and living by begging, heard that Qimu Island had food rations and set off one after another towards Qimu Island.

Soon, the refugees gathered on the island exceeded four thousand. Lu Wenyuan decided to start the first batch of transfer work immediately to make room for subsequent refugees.

He immediately sent a code telegram: "Serve dinner!"

With the sending of this telegram, the prelude to Operation Generator began.

Summoned by the telegram, the first transport convoy departed from Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

The first special transport convoy consisted of five H800 Harmony Wheels, escorted by the first-class gunboats *Yufeng* and *Yangbo*. The formation commander was Lieutenant Commander Le Lin of the Navy, capatain of the *Yufeng*, sailing towards Qimu Island.

After leaving the port, the formation took the east side of the Taiwan Strait, riding the Kuroshio Current north. With an average speed of 8 knots that day, it completed the entire journey in less than two days, arriving at Qimu Island at dusk on the 29th.

Because the number of refugees transported concerned his reputation, as soon as the ships arrived at the port, Lu Wenyuan disregarded exchanging pleasantries with Le Lin and specially went to inspect the H800 ships.

The H800s transporting refugees had undergone special modifications to transport as many people as possible while guaranteeing survival rates. Dr. Zhong had once proposed a plan to "crate transport" people using containers: despite various advantages, it was ultimately rejected because "human containers" stacked on deck had a high center of gravity and safety could not be guaranteed. In the end, the traditional below-deck cabin transport mode was adopted. To fully utilize space, double-layered bunks were installed in some cabins.

Roughly calculated, including hanging bunks, each refugee could occupy about 1.2 square meters. Although not spacious, it was considerably better compared to the 1 square meter per person for sailors on destroyers during World War II.

The cabin floors were covered with bundled hay—a measure against the cold.

"A bit insufficient. On land, we light fires for them." Lu Wenyuan looked at the thickness of the hay.

"It gets warmer the further south we go; it's not a big problem," Le Lin said. "Besides, if it really doesn't work, we have spare hay. Just add a few more bundles."

Le Lin showed him the bundles of hay piled in the hold, "All harvested locally while clearing land in Taiwan. Used for one wave and then unloaded for composting. Guaranteed to be clean every time people are transported."

"I think the rags on the refugees can also be composted..."

"That's unnecessary—no matter how tattered, they are cotton and hemp products. Wash them clean and make paper. The water from washing clothes can be used for composting..."

"Damn, are you being transferred to the Planning Commission?"

Because the cabins would be packed with refugees, to supply fresh air to these places, ventilators were installed on the deck. Non-powered fans developed by the Ministry of Technology were installed at the bow to collect air, which was then transported into the cabins through cloth ducts—as long as ventilation was ensured, the mortality and morbidity rates of large numbers of personnel during long voyages could be greatly reduced.

On the sides of the ship, there were some chutes extending outside the hull. These were chute toilets installed for the refugee cabins; excrement and urine were discharged directly into the sea, ensuring air quality inside the cabins and avoiding sanitary pollution.

Finally, spacious cabins were specially set aside for pregnant women and women carrying infants to ensure the survival rate of infants.

The H800 type had a cargo capacity of 800 tons and an actual standard displacement of 1200 tons. According to the slave trade transport mode, roughly every 2 tons of displacement could transport one slave, at the cost of extremely high mortality. At present, the Senate urgently needed population and certainly could not afford such mortality rates. Therefore, the loading capacity had to be lower.

Whether sailing from Qimu Island to Jeju Island or Kaohsiung, or from Kaohsiung to Hong Kong and Lingao, the sailing distances were relatively short. Even if wind and sea conditions were not ideal, the longest sailing time would not exceed a week. Therefore, the carriage of food and fresh water could be compressed as much as possible to carry more personnel.

The food supply per person per day was relief biscuits equivalent to 1400 kilocalories daily, plus 1.5 liters of boiled water for drinking. According to the Health Department's calculations, this supply could sustain the refugees safely arriving in Kaohsiung.

After precise calculations of carrying capacity, cargo types, and cargo volume, the final transport plan made by the Joint Logistics Headquarters was for each H800 to carry 400 people. Regardless of gender or age.

The transfer took place just as dawn broke. An infantry company armed with clubs and rifles with fixed bayonets sealed off the entire camp area. Then, while distributing breakfast, the camp leaders announced that they were to be sent to Zhejiang for "military farming"—Taiwan was a desolate land at the time; not to mention Shandong commoners had never heard of it, even if they had, they knew it wasn't a good place. In contrast, Jiangsu and Zhejiang were wealthy lands after all. Saying they were going there to reclaim wasteland met much less resistance.

From the barracks to the pier, there was a large group of propaganda personnel transported from Lingao. Each was a middle-aged woman with a face that looked joyous, greeting enthusiastically, helping the old and young, and repeating in broken Mandarin: "It'll be good once you get to the Zhejiang side! Eat as much rice as you want, enough for everyone! Hard work won't starve anyone! The masters are good people!"

In a semi-coerced and semi-coaxed state, the refugees, mentally scattered due to long-term diet control, were guided almost numbly to the boarding gangways. The first batch of two thousand refugees boarded the five H800 cargo ships.
