# Chapter 1193 - Zhu Si and Zheng Yue'e

Huang Ande was a "major client" here, buying several women almost every visit. Thus upon his appearance, people immediately cleared a path for him. Huang Ande was accustomed to the scene here and paid it no mind. Just as he was selecting according to Chief Zhu's standards, Zhu Si suddenly slapped his arm and called out nervously:

"Brother Huang!"

"What is it?" Huang Ande was startled by him.

"Isn't that Moon Maiden!" He pointed.

"What?" Huang Ande followed his finger and saw sitting blankly behind the side of the rope circle a young woman, similarly naked and with disheveled hair.

It took Huang Ande a moment to react—wasn't this Zheng Yue'e, the daughter of Cao Five from the Dengzhou Water Camp?

This Zheng Yue'e was a rather well-known girl among the families of the Dengzhou Water Camp soldiers. Cao Five's wife had died early; Zheng Yue'e was the eldest daughter with several younger siblings below her. She managed the household single-handedly, which developed her bold and capable personality. Not only did she dare to curse loudly in the streets, but she would roll up her sleeves to pull hair and tear clothes in fights with neighborhood women. She had once smashed open the head of a loafer molesting her with a water jar. In short, she was someone who never let herself be taken advantage of.

Because of her reputation and heavy family burdens, Zheng Yue'e, though not bad-looking, had remained without a husband. The Cao and Zhu families lived close by, and Zhu Si had some interest in her. He often went to help with heavy work, and through flirtatious glances both understood the meaning. But whenever Zhu Si thought of the five or six siblings she had to raise, realizing the burden of being this brother-in-law would be heavy—both families were ordinary camp soldiers, and military pay couldn't support a family—he had remained indecisive.

Huang Ande had spent some time with the Zhu family and heard Zhu Si muttering about this. He hadn't expected her to be captured too!

At this moment, this little woman famous for her boldness had a swollen face and bloodstains at the corner of her mouth. Her body was covered in whip marks, as if she had just been tortured. Her eyes were dull, and a foolish smile hung at the corner of her mouth—the shrewd, bold expression originally on her face was completely gone. She was simply like an idiotic fool.

"Master Huang, see anything you like?" The rebel steward watching nearby saw his gaze fixed and immediately came over to ask.

"This woman?" Huang Ande nodded slightly.

"Oh, seems her name is Yue'e or Heng'e," the steward knew at a glance. "The base is decent, but she's a bit crazy. Went mad a few days ago, got whipped before she settled down—otherwise General Zhao wouldn't have dumped her."

"How could she be crazy?" Zhu Si rushed to ask, only realizing his slip when Huang Ande glared at him: this was a rebel den. Even if confident, it wasn't a place for loose talk.

The other didn't mind: "How? Just parents killed, couldn't think it through for a moment and got confused. What new trick could it be? Looking at her body she should be a maiden; probably wasn't her husband or son killed."

Seeing Huang Ande and his follower showing interest in this woman, he took the opportunity to say: "Master Huang, if you like her and think she can still serve, just take her for two taels of silver—I'll count it as doing a good deed. One like her, if not sold, stays as a camp whore and sooner or later gets ruined to death anyway."

Huang Ande hesitated. Two taels was indeed cheap, but looking at her appearance she had fallen into idiocy. The Chiefs' first rule in picking people was no disabled ones. Besides, buying her with silver meant she would likely be a concubine or maid for the Chiefs—how to explain bringing back a crazy woman?

Zhu Si kept pulling his sleeve. Huang Ande knew the lad had strong feelings for Zheng Yue'e and wanted to save her—if he didn't buy her, Zheng Yue'e would conform to the steward's words: sooner or later raped to death.

The death of a helpless little woman didn't count as anything here: the moat outside the "market" was full of corpses. She wasn't necessarily more pitiful or worthy of rescue than the women still suffering in the human pen.

But Zhu Si's expression made it impossible for Huang Ande to refuse. Zhu Si's big brother Zhu San used to be his sworn brother, beheaded for stealing from government granaries with him. After he infiltrated Dengzhou, Zhu Si had followed him through life and death—any way you looked at it, he was a good brother.

But this was using public office for private gain—Huang Ande knew the Australian temperament well: everything had rules, everything followed systems. They particularly emphasized "discipline" and "obeying orders."

However, looking at Zhu Si's expression, then at Zheng Yue'e still smiling foolishly. Huang Ande hesitated a moment, asking Zhu Si: "You want me to save her. After saving her, are you willing to take her?"

"I am willing!"

"In her condition, she may not be able to cook or raise children. Are you still willing?"

"I am willing!" Zhu Si answered very crispily.

"In that case. I'll help you buy her." Huang Ande said, then spoke a few words to the steward. The steward nodded immediately, agreeing to knock off a few more fractions of silver.

Having done such a thing, explaining it back home would be difficult. Huang Ande thought for a long time, then steeled his heart: Silver, make it up from his own pay—though he didn't know the exchange rate between circulation notes and silver, his savings were considerable, probably enough. Let his Dengzhou military merits offset the disciplinary breach.

Thinking this he felt at ease. He selected five or six more women, spending the twenty-tael quota.

After stamping, the two walked out. Only after walking several dozen steps did Zhu Si call out with red eyes: "Brother Huang..."

"Say no more," Huang Ande patted his shoulder. "I didn't do it for you..." Just as he spoke, his foot was touched. He looked down to see a woman curled in rags crawling to his feet. Skeletal and barely human, she used all her strength to stuff a ragged bundle under his feet, pleading in a voice so weak it was barely audible:

"Have mercy... Master, give him a way to live..."

Huang Ande looked closely. inside the ragged bundle was a dead child, likely dead for some time, face covered in flies. He couldn't help retracting his foot in disgust, hurriedly taking a few steps forward. He led Zhu Si walking quickly ahead as if fleeing.

After walking several dozen steps, he felt it was too cruel and turned back: Even if the child was hopeless, the woman still had a breath. Rescuing her to eat a few full meals might revive her. Having violated discipline once, he didn't fear violating it a second time.

However, when he returned, the woman had already breathed her last. Two laborers were dragging her by the feet toward the corpse-disposal trench. The woman's hands were still tightly clutching the dead child.

The sunlight was blinding; Huang Ande felt a bit dizzy. He looked at this "market" filled with wailing victims, a hell on earth, and thought of Lingao—that was simply another world. He couldn't help looking up at the scorching sky and asking loudly, "Senate, when will your rain and dew cover the world!"

The population Huang Ande bought had already gathered at the designated place. There were over a dozen large straw sheds specially for their use. Cao Qing led several dozen militia specifically managing this: stamped refugees were sent here. After verifying stamps, each person was first issued a straw hat—reusable. Then two rice biscuits mixed with bean flour were issued to give these refugees some strength, followed by a bamboo tube of light saltwater—walking without water in summer would cause mass heatstroke.

Most had to walk on the return trip. Women bought with silver naturally received different treatment; as per rule, there was a light mule cart they could sit in. Huang Ande brought over a dozen standard military two-wheeled transport carts drawn by single mules or horses. The carts were filled with relief rations for exchanging population. On the return trip, they were used to transport children and the frail.

Besides population, the market sold all kinds of goods. Lu Wenyuan naturally wouldn't miss such opportunities. Huang Ande's task was to place orders for items he spotted—specific payment and inspection would be done by Zhu Mingxia personally: unlike buying people, wealth tempted hearts, and there was no guarantee they wouldn't meet desperate desperadoes wanting money over life.

According to the Planning Commission's purchasing guidance, first came livestock: horses, donkeys, mules, oxen. Besides capturing large numbers of military horses and animals, the rebels looted massive amounts of livestock from the populace. The rebels possessed so many animals that when they fled Huangxian, Shandong Touring Censor Xie Sanbin could organize a sizable transport team to supply grain for tens of thousands of government troops just using the donkeys and mules discarded by rebels, fully replenishing them in three days.

The rebels also valued livestock highly, but lacking a comprehensive logistics system, they relied entirely on locust-style "eat all, loot all" supply. Animals didn't get good feed or rest and would soon be overworked, only good for meat. Seeing this opportunity, Lu Wenyuan negotiated with Kong Youde, agreeing to exchange silver or grain for the rebels' excess livestock. These animals were also sent to Zhaoyuan for local grazing—summer grass was lush, and with care, the animals would quickly recover health.

However, livestock sent to the "market" remained limited. For most rebels, killing for meat was the simplest solution. So oftentimes Huang Ande settled for the second best option: purchasing animal byproducts like hides, hooves, and horns. These were raw materials needed by Lingao industry. Originally Lu Wenyuan also bought animal bones, but stopped after finding rebels mixing human bones in with them.

Today the market had a large pile of "merchandise" the Planning Commission was quite interested in—metal objects. These metal objects were obviously looted from commoners and shops, piled in a heap. All kinds of utensils were inside. Huang Ande even discovered several temple bells.
