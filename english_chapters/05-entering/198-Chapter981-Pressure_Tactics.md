# Chapter 981 - Pressure Tactics

The weapon was an antique sword with mottled patina—by Ming standards, it qualified as an antiquity. The escort guide's eyes flickered—this sword was no ordinary object. This man was no unknown *jianghu* nobody.

There were also three darts and several small bottles of elixirs and such. Typical personal effects of a *jianghu* traveler.

The most suspicious item, of course, was Zhang Yingchen's portrait—no one would carry around a portrait of a Daoist for no reason.

Min Zhanlian knelt naked on the ground with hands bound behind his back. The humiliating and painful position was truly unbearable. The slightest struggle, and every joint was pinned so tightly that no matter how heroic or strong you were, you couldn't exert force.

His heart raced—this technique seemed to be from the official bureaus. Could he have somehow provoked Dongchang or some powerful eunuch? At this thought, Min Zhanlian's hands and feet went cold.

"What do you do?" Ye Mengyan stared at him coldly.

Min Zhanlian was startled. This person was practically still a youth, yet his gaze was cold and ruthless—clearly someone who killed without blinking.

"This humble one is a *jianghu* traveler. I took a job here but couldn't complete it, so I was on my way to Jining to catch a boat home." He forced himself to stay calm while his mind raced for a way out.

"What's your name?"

"This humble one is Min Zhanlian." Min Zhanlian knew lying about this would be useless, so he answered honestly.

"Oh! So you're the so-called assassin?" Ye Mengyan nodded after the escort whispered a few words in his ear.

"Yes. This humble one has always taken money to eliminate troubles for others."

"Hired by whom?"

"A local sect called the Nanwuliang Sect—I don't know if you gentlemen are aware of it?" He showed full willingness to cooperate, answering fluently: "Three months ago, they sent someone to contact me in Henan, wanting me to bring people to deal with him."

"Kill whom?"

"A Daoist surnamed Zhang." Min Zhanlian decided not to hide this fact—who could have known he'd made the mistake of keeping Daoist Zhang's portrait on his person?

What he didn't realize was that without that portrait, he would already be a nameless corpse in a roadside ditch.

"And did you kill your target?"

"This humble one dare not kill him anymore." Min Zhanlian immediately began describing Zhang Yingchen's "miracles." He was quite cunning—he only spoke of hearsay, not claiming to have witnessed anything himself. Since he didn't know whether these people were Zhang Yingchen's friends or enemies, keeping some distance was wise.

"Such a half-human, half-demon figure—this humble one truly didn't dare take on the job." Min Zhanlian said. "I had no choice but to take my people and head back. Unfortunately we lost our horses on the road, and through ignorance and momentary confusion, I offended all of you!"

This speech was both reasonable and, without showing it, cleanly severed any connection between himself and both the Nanwuliang Sect and Zhang Yingchen. Then he promptly admitted his "ignorance," essentially conceding defeat and acknowledging the other side was stronger—a move that often satisfied an opponent's vanity enough to secure release.

Though this confrontation had resulted in casualties on both sides, making mercy highly unlikely, he still had to try.

Zhou Ruolan was also interrogated, and her testimony was largely similar. Comparing the two, Ye Mengyan quickly understood the truth: this group had indeed come to kill Daoist Zhang, but had fled in panic because of Zhang Yingchen's overwhelming "powers."

"This Daoist Zhang plays at supernatural nonsense all day, and he actually has powers?" Ye Mengyan found this incredible—his high school physics had been mostly forgotten.

Puzzled though he was, that evening he met with Zhang Yingchen, and they exchanged information about local conditions.

Zhang Yingchen's requirements were simple: use force to protect his local missionary activities, strike against the Nanwuliang Sect's local forces, and ensure his and the local church's safety.

"My current situation is quite delicate," Zhang Yingchen said. "I'm essentially perched on a precarious balance point—the problem is, I don't know when my actions might upset that balance.

"Therefore, I need force to ensure the balance isn't broken. As you've seen, my opponents have no qualms about using violence. Without violence as backup, I cannot establish myself here, let alone spread New Daoism."

Zhang Yingchen spoke these words while looking directly at Ye Mengyan, adopting a candid expression—he knew this youngster was difficult to deal with.

Ye Mengyan found Zhang Yingchen's request distasteful. In his view, Daoist Zhang was obviously running a "cult." Personally, Ye Mengyan despised all religions with a passion—he was an authentic atheist crusader knight and atheist inquisitor grand inquisitor. Whether it was Dean Wu, Father Bai, or the two Taoist masters Zhang and Dai, all had received his cold stares. If they weren't "comrades" and using religion wasn't current established policy, these people might have received even worse treatment.

"No problem. Who do you want killed?" Ye Mengyan got straight to the point.

"For now, I don't want to kill anyone—"

"How hypocritical."

"Not at all. I don't even know whom to kill." Zhang Yingchen spoke the truth—to this day, he knew nothing specific about his opponents' local situation.

The believers who had defected didn't know much more than he did.

"Then what do you want us to do?"

"Protect my safety at all times. Protect Dadianzhang's safety." Zhang Yingchen said seriously. "From now on, I'm going to start pressure tactics."

Zhang Yingchen's pressure tactics meant that starting now, he would actively develop missionary activities, shifting from ambiguous low-key to high-profile action, aggressively competing for believers, forcing the other side to actively respond to him again.

The enemy was in the shadows; he was in the light. If the opponents remained hidden, he would always be in danger of thieves striking at any moment. Only by provoking them into major action could he seize the opportunity to lure the snakes from their holes and catch them all in one net.

"My missionaries will arrive soon—and I'll also rush-train a batch here myself." Zhang Yingchen spoke casually. "Very soon I'll stir up a small-scale religious dispute throughout Yizhou. I estimate it won't be long before it triggers a religious war..."

"And I'm your Knights Templar, right?"

"Also my Inquisitor." Zhang Yingchen said in a gentle voice. "Little Ye."

"No problem." Ye Mengyan nodded.

Zhang Yingchen asked: "What do you plan to do with those two assassins?"

"Kill them. Bury them late at night."

Zhang Yingchen's heart tightened. Zhou Ruolan was one thing, but thinking of Min Zhanlian's beautiful muscle definition, his leopard-like flexibility, he couldn't help but secretly regret: among the natives, it was rare to encounter such a handsome, well-built young man.

Ye Mengyan saw his expression shifting and secretly found it amusing. He immediately said the opposite: "If there's a suitable place to hold them, we might as well detain them first and deal with them later."

With a slight smile, their eyes met, each understanding the other perfectly. Zhang Yingchen silently praised him—unexpectedly, after a few years, Little Ye had become quite perceptive. Truly a mature man now.

Over the next few days, new groups continuously arrived from Jining. First came missionaries dispatched from New Daoism headquarters. Considering that these aged Qiongshan degree candidates mostly spoke only Qiongshan dialect that locals couldn't understand, Zhang Yingchen had only requested the three most reliable missionaries who spoke the best Mandarin to come help with religious affairs. The actual missionary work would be handled by local believers who had defected—for now, he didn't need believers to understand much about New Daoist doctrine. First stake out the territory, then worry about the rest.

Next came the rest of First Squad's personnel. Twenty squad members and dozens of Qiwei Station support personnel carrying various equipment and supplies departed from Jining in separate groups. This included large quantities of medicines and New Daoist religious propaganda materials printed by the Hangzhou Station press.

For ease of command, Zhang Yingchen moved his office from inside the Zhuang residence to the small temple outside the compound—now officially renamed "Yunsheng Temple." During the day he trained missionaries here and directed missionary work. At night he still returned to the Zhuang residence to sleep, the better to continue cultivating the Zhuang family.

After discussions with the Zhuang family, they reached an agreement on jointly operating a pharmacy. Daoist Zhang's various medicines were known to be highly effective, and now Zhang Yingchen used these prepared medicines as incentive to secure quite favorable terms from the Zhuang family. The most important provision was that the Zhuang family would join his charitable projects.

Zhang Yingchen's charitable projects were essentially the same as what Guo Yi had done in Guangzhou. Nominally handling various charitable works without distinction, the actual main purpose was receiving refugees for outward transport. Ultimately, the reason Zhang Yingchen had overcome all obstacles to come to southern Shandong alone was precisely to receive flood refugees from here—missionary work was merely supplementary.

Southern Shandong, including the Xuzhou area in what is now northern Jiangsu, had been flood-prone since the late Tianqi reign. This spring's floods had struck several prefectures again, with refugees everywhere. As long as there was grain, there was no worry about recruiting enough refugees.

Grain: the Senate had already prepared sufficient quantities. A considerable portion of relief rations had already been shipped to Hong Kong and was waiting to be loaded aboard ships bound for the Hangzhou Station and Qimu Island. Yizhou was only 200 kilometers from the major Grand Canal hub of Jining, and also 200 kilometers from Rizhao Port—both sea and river transport were very convenient. If they wanted to use the current sub-base on Qimu Island, they could also take the Yi River: departing Yizhou northward along the Yi River, then a short overland stretch to reach the Juyang River into Laizhou Bay, with Qimu Island not far beyond.

This route was obviously most suitable—making full use of existing facilities with sufficient transport capacity. Currently, work teams on the Dengzhou-Laizhou side were surveying this route and preparing ships and warehouses to ensure that relief grain shipped from Hong Kong could be smoothly delivered to Yizhou.

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau's report on Operation Engine pointed out: during the operation, mobile transport within Shandong Province should focus primarily on river shipping—the area had numerous waterways, with many large rivers navigable for vessels of several hundred tons or more.

Note: Due to a momentary oversight, Jining was mistakenly written as Linqing. In the previous ten chapters, all instances of Linqing should read Jining.
