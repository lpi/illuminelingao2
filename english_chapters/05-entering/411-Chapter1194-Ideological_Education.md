# Chapter 1194 - Ideological Education

The prices were exceedingly cheap, especially when they paid in silver—in fact, the most welcomed good here was silver. As long as you produced silver, anything was sold at a fraction or even a few hundredths of its original price.

After approving the goods, Huang Ande took the purchased population back to the island. The journey was very smooth this time; no one collapsed and died. Upon returning to the island, he reported purchasing Zheng Yue'e to Zhu Mingxia.

Zhu Mingxia smiled and patted his shoulder: "For this matter, we'll just deduct two taels of silver from your pay. You meant well. As for that girl, hand her over to the medics first. When there's a ship evacuating wounded back, send her along. Once in Lingao, have Doctor Deng at the General Hospital take a look."

Deng Boyun of the Ministry of Health General Hospital and the Senate's only psychiatrist, Jiang Qiuyan, had jointly set up a Ministry of Health Mental Health Center—actually a plaque-hanging institution just to show presence, taking in some mental patients. When the two had time and interest, they would do some counseling.

For someone like Zheng Yue'e, Zhu Mingxia felt it was at most an acute stress reaction under intense stimulation—common in the military too. Estimatedly some psychological counseling would help her recover.

"Yes! Thank you, Chief." Huang Ande saluted, then hesitated. "Chief, I have a question."

"Speak." Zhu Mingxia didn't mind.

"The commoners of Dengzhou and Laizhou are too miserable... human lives are simply worse than pigs and dogs..." Huang Ande spoke with some agitation. Dengzhou was his homeland after all; his eyes couldn't help reddening. "Our Fubo Army's military force is so powerful. Why not just wipe out this gang of rebels directly? Why do we still have to do business with them?!"

Zhu Mingxia was startled. Until now, naturalized officers and soldiers of the Fubo Army had never questioned Elders' commands—to them, the Senate was a godlike existence.

This was a very dangerous sign. Zhu Mingxia thought. Because he was a Dengzhou native, seeing his hometown in such misery naturally made him unable to bear it.

Of course, he could completely suppress him with one sentence, but Zhu Mingxia paid great attention to ideological and political work. Moreover, Huang Ande was an officer, a future backbone of the Fubo Army. He had to explain the reasoning clearly.

"Sit down." Zhu Mingxia pointed to the chair in his office.

Huang Ande hesitated, saluted, and sat down.

"You feel our Fubo Army is very powerful, correct?"

"Reporting to Sir, yes!" Huang Ande started to stand up to report again. Zhu Mingxia waved his hand. "We are having a heart-to-heart talk now, no need to follow regulations."

"Do you think our Northbound Detachment can attack Dengzhou and defeat the rebels now?"

"Whatever stands in our way will be crushed like dry weeds and rotten wood. Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde are nothing but clay chickens and pottery dogs."

Zhu Mingxia thought he really had a knack for idioms. No wonder people said Shandong was the "Hometown of Sages."

"We can indeed defeat the rebels now, but what happened after defeating them?" he asked.

Huang Ande hesitated. What after defeating the rebels? He really hadn't thought about it. In his mode of thinking, these were issues for "the higher-ups." After a moment of stunned silence, he said: "The common people live and work in peace..."

Zhu Mingxia looked into Huang Ande's eyes: "Live and work in peace? You yourself are a Dengzhou native. Did Dengzhou's common people live and work in peace in the past?"

The answer was obvious—in the Dengzhou-Laizhou region, the poverty of the people and the hardship of life were famous right up to the Republic era. Even in ordinary years, people starving to death and fleeing famine were commonplace.

Huang Ande hesitated: "Though not living and working in peace, surely it wasn't this miserable..." Speaking, he remembered the various tragic scenes he saw at the market these past days, and couldn't help shedding tears, hurriedly wiping them with his sleeve.

Zhu Mingxia patted his shoulder, saying: "You are right. Without Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde, commoners could starve to death peacefully. If they couldn't survive, at least they had the path of fleeing famine and selling children. Are we defeating Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde just to win the common people such a world?"

"Of course not." Huang Ande hurriedly said. "If everywhere could happen like Lingao, that would be good."

"Like Lingao." Zhu Mingxia nodded. "Even if not exactly like Lingao, having a peaceful environment where they can farm securely and live their lives—commoners would be very satisfied, right?"

"Yes!" Huang Ande said. "Common folks aren't afraid of being poor or suffering. They ask for nothing but peaceful days."

"But you know that peaceful days don't come easily," Zhu Mingxia said seriously. "You are an old naturalized citizen, an old soldier. You know how Lingao-Hainan's peaceful days came about."

Huang Ande nodded. He was a veteran of the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign and the Pacification War, still remembering the days and nights of fighting back then.

"How many comrades did we sacrifice? What price did we pay to let the people of the whole Hainan Island live the peaceful days you expect?" Zhu Mingxia began to speak with emotion. "Do you know where the rifle in your hands, the clothes on your body, the shoes on your feet, and the dry rations you eat come from?"

"Provided by the great Senate!" This was the standard answer provided by Wei Aiwen, but when Huang Ande answered this, he didn't feel it absurd or laughable—he believed this sentence from the bottom of his heart.

"Correct! It is provided by the Senate, but also earned by the diligent labor of the vast naturalized citizenry. Workers toiling by furnaces in factories, farmers laboring under the scorching sun, sailors driving ships regardless of life and death, miners working desperately in coal yards—only then did Hainan Island have the peaceful days you speak of!" Zhu Mingxia used a string of lyrical parallelisms to increase his persuasiveness.

"Defeating the rebels now is an easy thing for us. But what about later? Don't forget there are also the Great Ming's government troops, whose harm to the people is no less. Even if they don't harm the people and leave quickly, is it enough for the people to continue living peaceful days of starving to death and fleeing famine?"

"Of course not!" Huang Ande said firmly and powerfully.

Zhu Mingxia said, "Soldier chaos, bandit chaos, exorbitant taxes—this Great Ming world is already ablaze with beacons everywhere, full of devastation. Suffering people are everywhere. As the Senate's sharp sword, we must broaden our vision: hold the whole world in our chests, vowing to save all the people under heaven!" He waved his hand with full emotion.

Huang Ande's passion was also incited: "Save all the people under heaven?!" Although he had long sensed the Senate's ambition, he had never heard an Elder reveal it so bluntly: a strong emotion surged in his heart. The heroic spirit of achieving great deeds instantly drowned out his pity.

"Correct, for all the suffering people under heaven!" Zhu Mingxia nodded solemnly. "So our primary work is to silently accumulate strength. Maximizing the collection of population from Dengzhou-Laizhou to strengthen ourselves is what we should do now—not seeking a moment of gratification for the suffering of one locality's people: that is only petty benevolence and petty righteousness, not the great benevolence and great righteousness that considers the whole world!"

"Yes, I understand!" Huang Ande jumped up excitedly, standing at attention and saluting. "Serve the Senate and the people!"

After Huang Ande left, Zhu Mingxia took out a handkerchief and wiped his sweat. Educating a person was truly not easy. He thought, looking with complex emotions at Huang Ande's retreating figure.

"Mr. Speaker, the Executive Committee Enlarged Meeting will begin in fifteen minutes..."

The Senate Speaker's private secretary, Qian Honghuang, wearing a female clerk's uniform, opened the office door and spoke respectfully.

"Alright, I'm coming immediately." Qian Shuiting tidied the documents on his desk. He took a briefcase from the wooden shelf on the wall, then took a stack of files from the safe in the room—no longer reinforced concrete, but a genuine steel-plate riveted safe—carefully counted them, put them into the briefcase, and snapped the lock.

Then, he scrutinized his image in a full-length mirror on the wall, checked if his clothes were crisp and unwrinkled, and smoothed his hair. Qian Shuiting was someone who placed great importance on his image, and was the only Executive Committee member to install a full-length mirror in his office. In America, he had enjoyed watching American politicians shape their own images, from hairstyles and clothing to demeanor. Now he involuntarily began to practice it himself.

Today's meeting was actually convened to discuss his "Elder Military-Political Proposal." The White Silver Plan had passed the Senate vote and officially entered the Executive Committee discussion stage.

Ever since late 1630 when Qian Shuiting first proposed on the BBS to rob the Spanish galleons transporting American silver to Manila off the Philippine coast in 1631, this proposal had gained extremely high popularity.

Hoisting the Jolly Roger, wielding a cutlass, wearing an eyepatch to board enemy ships, then stepping on chests of silver, forcing crew to walk the plank... the imagination of many Sailing ship Party boarding-action enthusiasts instantly expanded uncontrollably. Although history buffs pointed out that standard pirate Jolly Rogers hadn't appeared yet in 1630 regardless of color, no one paid attention to their spoilsport replies. And the treasure figure claimed to be up to a million taels of silver made many people's pupils instantly turn into the shape of silver ingots.

Only because the timing wasn't ripe had this extremely popular proposal been postponed until now. However, those interested had been following this plan all along. Information collection for the operation had been ongoing. Implementation details had been discussed at several small gatherings on the *Feiyun*.

Over more than two years, through the collective brainstorming of a group of people, constant data collection, and small-scale wargaming, the simple plan had been continuously supplemented, forming a feasibility report with detailed content and concrete figures.
