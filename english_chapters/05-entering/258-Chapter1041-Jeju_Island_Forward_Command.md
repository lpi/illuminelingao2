# Chapter 1041: Jeju Island Forward Command

In the sheltered spot at the foot of Seongsan, a net curtain had been erected, surrounded by sentries standing guard with live ammunition and gleaming bayonets. Inside the large command tent within the curtain, personnel of the Jeju Island Landing Command were busily at work.

A situation map of Jeju Island, drawn based on 21st-century large-scale maps and historical materials, lay flat on the combination map table. The members of the Jeju Island Forward Command: Rear Admiral Li Haiping of the Second Fleet, Special Reconnaissance Detachment Squad Leader Xue Ziliang, Jeju Island Special Task Force Commander Nangong Wudi, and Jeju Island Civil Commissioner Feng Zongze were studying the situation.

Although Jeju Island was the first line against Japan, the Joseon Dynasty's military strength was not strong. According to historical records, the garrison on the entire Jeju Island was less than two thousand men. As for the combat effectiveness of these two thousand men, the Senators unanimously agreed it was completely unworthy of mention. Thirty years ago, the Japanese army entered Joseon as if it were uninhabited territory, and during the Later Jin invasion of Joseon four years ago, the Joseon army was even more fragile. King Injo of Joseon fled directly to Ganghwa Island, and his only strategy to retreat the enemy was to sue for peace.

Escorted by the Second Fleet to land on Jeju Island were two infantry companies of the Northbound Detachment Jeju Island Special Task Force, one combat engineer company, and one public security army company, plus a direct company equipped with four cannons. On the construction side, there were the direct squadron, horse-raising squadron, and four ordinary labor squadrons under the Jeju Island Agricultural Reclamation Regiment. The total landing number was about one thousand two hundred people. In addition to the field army and public security army possessing weapons, the Agricultural Reclamation Regiment was also equipped with cold weapons.

"I command a labor squadron, and even with standard spears and machetes, we can completely crush these two thousand Joseon troops." The speaker was Nangong Wudi. This person had a pot-lid haircut loved by Army Senators, was 170cm tall, and of medium build but with solid muscles. It was visible that his body had undergone long-term exercise and his physical fitness was very good. His thick arms and bulging muscles, along with an M1911 pistol rarely used by Senators, indicated he was a man with strong arm strength.

The most peculiar thing was that on his waist there was also a leather pouch—containing a slingshot made of steel wire and beef tendon.

He wore an Army uniform with the rank of Army Captain. Nangong Wudi had once been a squad leader in the PLA: he had skills in leading troops, training, and fighting. Therefore, after D-Day, he logically entered the Army. In the second anti-encirclement campaign, he was an infantry company commander of the Fubo Army, but because he was in the reserve force, apart from charging for a while during the final pursuit and capturing a few hundred prisoners, he just sat on the ground waiting throughout the entire Chengmai Campaign. Therefore, in the large-scale promotion after the Chengmai Campaign, it wasn't his turn.

However, out of the need to cultivate Senator officers, shortly after the Chengmai Campaign, the General Staff organized an Army Advanced Tactics Class to train all Army Senator officers below the battalion level in batches, serving as a reserve for future mid-to-high-ranking officers. The training content, besides strategy, focused on explaining military organization, training, and tactics of the line-infantry era. A large part of it was the tactics and lessons learned for "public security warfare" to be deployed as a support force for "social transformation" after extensive entry into the mainland in the next step.

Nangong Wudi's grades in the Advanced Tactics Class were only average. But his professional ability was very strong. His experience of wandering in society to make a living after discharge allowed him to master daily communication terms in Mongolian, Manchu, Korean, Vietnamese, Tibetan, and Uyghur. This language ability advantage led him to be selected as the Army commander for the Jeju Island landing during the preparation stage of Operation Generator.

Jeju Island Civil Commissioner Feng Zongze said: "Crushing the Joseon ruling structure is no problem. But the area here is large; is our manpower enough to defend the whole island?"

Feng Zongze was a head taller than Nangong Wudi, looking very sturdy, giving people a feeling of sincerity. He was the owner of a small pharmacy, mastering skills: licensed pharmacist and junior nutritionist, psychology, good at cooking, could drive medium-sized vehicles and tractors, and could bluff through maintenance and repair. He could also bluff through horse riding. The key was being able to speak fluent Japanese and barely understandable Korean. So he stood out among the dozens of soy-sauce (bystander) Senators who applied for Jeju Island Civil Commissioner—this was the official public reason. According to unreliable rumors, this person had ambiguous connections with a certain female Senator and was personally threatened by her boyfriend, so the Organization Department selected him for this position. Of course, such nonsense was not believed by anyone except Wu Chongzhen Tongibao (Wu the Coin Collector). Organization Department Head Ming Lang also firmly denied it:

"We have a set of procedures for selecting Senators for administrative positions. This process is completely open and transparent."

However, judging from his abilities, choosing this multi-skilled Senator as an expatriate civil official was very much like killing many birds with one stone: for example, the Generator Command did not send any Senator medical personnel to accompany the mission.

Xue Ziliang said: "We don't need to defend the whole island. Just defend our base. The Joseon folks can do whatever they want; if they come to fight, we'll teach them a harsh lesson."

"No, the enemy's armed forces still need to be disarmed." As the supreme commander of this operation, Nangong Wudi opposed this. "Jeju Island has abundant resources. Only by controlling the Joseon bureaucrats and disarming them can we utilize them effectively. If you don't catch the Joseon local officials, can you know where the official horses on the island are? Can you know the specific population on the island? It's true we have many historical materials, but there are discrepancies between historical materials and reality. Moreover, historical materials aren't detailed and specific enough."

For outsiders to rule a place, local collaborators are indispensable existences. Establishing a "puppet regime" and appointing "traitors" is always the unwavering choice of the occupying army.

"We also need the grain reserves of the local government and to conscript the local population. It won't work without controlling the government." Feng Zongze also hurriedly expressed his stance.

"OK, I have no objection. Do it according to your thinking." Xue Ziliang raised his hand in submission. He wasn't averse to fighting—after all, that was where his value lay.

"We need to take the three cities of Jeju, Daejeong, and Jeongui as soon as possible and control the Joseon ruling institutions on the island." Nangong Wudi circled three places on the glass plate over the map with an ink pen.

Jeju Island had three counties: Jeju, Daejeong County, and Jeongui County, which were the three administrative centers on the island, respectively stationed with a Moksa (Magistrate) and County Magistrates (Hyongam) as local officials.

Jeju was the Jeju City of the old timeline, and also the political and economic center of the whole island, administering about half of the island's population. Daejeong County was at the southwest end of the island. Jeongui County was in the southeast of the island, which is the Seongeup of the old timeline. It was closest to Seongsan where they landed.

"Just don't know how these two thousand men are specifically deployed." Feng Zongze hesitated, "They wouldn't just be stationed separately in these three cities, right?"

"There are also soldiers stationed at beacon towers and other places." Xue Ziliang said. According to the materials provided by the Great Library, besides the three cities, the Joseon Dynasty also set up 9 garrison points across the island, and each garrison point must also have some soldiers.

To garrison a large island of five hundred square kilometers with a meager force of about two thousand men, and scatter them like sesame salt everywhere, would inevitably cause insufficient troops in every place. From this point of view, the deployment idea of the Joseon army was similar to the Green Standard Army of the later Qing Dynasty, setting up defenses everywhere and deploying dispersedly, focusing more on executing police tasks rather than as a field army. It would be easy for the special task force to defeat them one by one.

"We can also interrogate the prisoners. Prisoners can give us first-hand data." Xue Ziliang said.

Immediately, soldiers were ordered to bring in the captured Haenyeo for interrogation. The fact that Xue Ziliang caught bare-bottomed women as soon as he went ashore aroused strong interest from Feng Zongze and the others. Not that they lacked women: all three had bought maids, but they had a fantasy about "Haenyeo" diving into the sea naked to harvest seafood.

Of course, in the old timeline, Haenyeo all wore tight diving suits, or at least swimsuits. And most women persisting in this industry were middle-aged or older—because it was too arduous, Japanese and Korean women in the old timeline no longer worked as Haenyeo.

Now hearing that there actually existed "Haenyeo" fitting their fantasies, these few couldn't help but feel restless inside.

Before the Haenyeo were brought in, Feng Zongze and Nangong Wudi debated in elementary Korean about who spoke Korean better. During the process, to demonstrate the depth of their Korean, they exchanged greetings using certain words in Korean. As for Li Haiping, the Navy Admiral who had nothing to do with the interrogation, he also remained silent and motionless in the tent.

After the Haenyeo entered, they immediately knelt with their heads down. Although the weather on Jeju Island was warmer, it was winter after all. The temperature outside the tent was less than ten degrees. Haenyeo relied entirely on smearing grease on their bodies before entering the water and using strong liquor to dispel cold. Plus, diving all year round made their cold resistance better than average people, not that they had special constitutions. Although covered with straw shirts, being blown by the cold wind with semi-naked bodies, they couldn't hold out. Entering the tent, they all breathed a sigh of relief—it was much warmer inside.

The Haenyeo's hair was coiled on top of their heads. Their bare skin showed a bronze color due to long-term soaking in seawater and sun exposure. Their figures were quite fit due to long-term exercise. But a close look revealed that several were already quite old—senior auntie level in this timeline; only two or three were young women. Feng Zongze's Korean was slightly better, so he opened his mouth and asked a few sentences.

Realizing that these people wearing gray-blue short jackets and driving big ships could speak their language, the Haenyeo looked up one by one, eyes wide open—the people in front of them were not the "Wokou" (Japanese pirates) they feared most. Sometimes "Tang people" (Chinese) and "Wa people" (Japanese) drifted to Jeju Island due to shipwrecks, and sometimes Wokou came to harass, but obviously, the people in front were neither.

(Regarding the image of Haenyeo, one can see in some old photos that they were indeed naked or only wearing underwear. Rubber diving suits and tight swimsuits are products of the last sixty or seventy years. Earlier ones of course didn't exist.)

(Actually, similar professional divers exist all over the world. When diving, they are mostly naked, smearing grease on their bodies to ward off the cold.)

(In addition, regarding Jeju Island's Haenyeo, some materials say they actually appeared after the 19th century. Because taxes on women were light, gradually men harvesting seafood changed to women.)
