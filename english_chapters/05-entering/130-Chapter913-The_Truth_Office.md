# Chapter 913 – The Truth Office

Zhang Haogu's work was extensive and complex. In broad terms, the Truth Office's main functions were: establishing the history of the Australian Song and its corresponding scientific, political, social, and cultural development; setting technological boundaries for each department; screening books and films from the Grand Library; determining the scope of education for natives and their access to materials. The office also compiled related handbooks for distribution to transmigrators to standardize their talking points on various topics. Natives and naturalized citizens were increasingly involved in transmigrator work, and a careless remark by any transmigrator could become the source of future rumors.

In practical terms, the work was divided into two parts. One was publication review. Ever since Zhou Dongtian's series of printing equipment and technology initiatives had been largely completed, printing and publishing had advanced by leaps and bounds. Various departments were producing large quantities of textbooks, popular science books, and technical pamphlets. Maintaining proper limits on all this became one of Zhang Haogu's primary tasks.

The other part was taking charge of selecting topics and organizing the writing of "special propaganda materials." Because the number of transmigrators serving in the Grand Library was limited and work was quite busy, apart from certain "major topics" that were "collective creations," most materials had to be written by Zhang Haogu himself. Of course, he had the authority to solicit manuscripts from other transmigrators and pay a certain fee—a practice already implemented within the Propaganda Department. The transmigrators who contributed were mostly motivated not by a few circulation vouchers but by the desire to satisfy their creative urges.

Technical matters were reviewed specifically by the Science and Technology Department. Anything involving dark history, forms of address, or political viewpoints fell under Zhang Haogu's purview.

Writing "black materials" while also handling manuscript reviews—his workload was obviously immense. And because of the highly sensitive nature of the work, he couldn't use naturalized citizens directly; most things had to be done personally. By comparison, the Grand Library's Historical Research Section could at least employ a few Confucian-background naturalized citizens to help search and transcribe ancient texts.

"Damn it, they're using me as a coolie," Zhang Haogu grumbled, standing up and pacing around his office. Outside the glass windows, the sunshine was so brilliant it looked oppressively hot.

This was a corner of the Propaganda Department compound inside Bairren City. It had originally housed the Grand Library. After the Library was relocated to Gaoshan Ridge, the Propaganda Department had taken over the space. The shipping containers that once stored these priceless treasures had been moved away, but traces of the leveling stones used as foundations were still faintly visible.

To conveniently serve the transmigrators, the Grand Library maintained a liaison office in the Propaganda Department compound. Several transmigrators took turns on duty, ready to handle various inquiries at any time.

Besides the Propaganda Department and the Grand Library liaison office, this was also the registered address of the *Lingao Times*, *Gewu Pictorial*, the Publishing Guidance Group, and the Truth Office. The phrase "registered address" was apt because there simply weren't enough transmigrators and naturalized citizens to fill all these positions—most were cases of "multiple signs, one staff."

Zhang Haogu's Truth Office occupied three rooms in a corner of the compound. One was his document room, specifically for storing "black materials" he'd collected and received from various departments. One was his workroom. The third was his living quarters. Like many transmigrators, he preferred to sleep in his office so he could work at any time. His staff consisted only of himself and his maidservant.

His secretary and maidservant heard his footsteps and came out from the adjoining bedroom. Seeing him sweating, she poured him a cup of chilled tea, then lowered all the Venetian blinds in the room. The office suddenly dimmed, but felt much cooler.

On his desk were stacks of book casings. These were typescripts produced by the printing plant's typists. Every day, Zhang Haogu covered them with ink-pen annotations, and frequently used red ink to mark revisions. Naturalized citizens who occasionally glimpsed Zhang Haogu at work mostly assumed he must be a very important leader.

Zhang Haogu picked up the table of contents for the latest batch of "special propaganda" pamphlets. In this timeline's parlance, these were called "jietie"—posted notices.

In ancient society, *jietie* were a kind of handbill, usually anonymous, attacking certain people or events—sometimes even targeting the court and the emperor directly.

In ancient society, because there were insufficient technical investigative means, unsigned *jietie* were generally hard to trace back to their source and therefore quite safe. The disadvantage was that the literate population was too small, limiting their reach among the lower classes. So *jietie* could only influence officialdom and the educated classes.

Since the Truth Office was working toward the Ming masses, it couldn't completely ignore the historical realities of the time, unlike other departments. It had to pay attention to certain political issues of the late Ming.

Some work in this area had already been done, including compiling *Records of Atrocities* and the pamphlets distributed during the Second Counter-Encirclement. But at the time, these were only sporadic efforts, not deployed as a primary tool. Now they were to be systematically organized as a major line of work.

After much consideration, Zhang Haogu decided to adopt a three-pronged approach to special propaganda. "Three-pronged" meant producing propaganda materials tailored to different audiences.

First, creating anonymous *jietie* and forging *dibao* (court gazettes). The content would start from commentary on the Three Great Cases and the Three Great Campaigns, touching on major political events of the mid-to-late Ming, including the "Reverse Case" targeting the Donglin Party during the Tianqi era, Zhang Juzheng's reforms and the reaction after his death, and so on. The emphasis would be on "re-investigation" and "rational analysis" of these political events, offering unconventional viewpoints and materials. On the surface, it would oppose incompetent and corrupt officials while supporting the Emperor; the real hidden message would guide "reflection" on the entire Ming political system. This was aimed at the scholar-official class.

Second, using the *huaben* storytelling format to produce popular illustrated pamphlets. These would be distributed to storytellers in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region and could also circulate privately as popular novels. Their attacks on Ming legitimacy and promotion of the Lingao collective would be relatively subtle. They could be supplemented with colorful little palace anecdotes and even some new scientific knowledge. This was aimed at the urban merchant class.

Finally, composing folk songs and children's rhymes targeting the southern provinces. Though low in technical sophistication and crude in nature, such things had always had tremendous impact. Before every major political upheaval, all sorts of veiled nursery rhymes and folk songs would spread everywhere—proof of their power. This was aimed at the peasantry.

Zhang Haogu currently focused his main energy on fabricating *jietie* and producing *huaben* storytelling booklets. Both required certain technical skills. First, the true Australian origin couldn't be revealed, so their lithography or lead-type printing couldn't be used; they had to use woodblocks or traditional movable type—such as clay type or wooden type—resulting in lower-quality printing. Zhou Dongtian had set up a traditional printing workshop specifically for this purpose.

As for content, some of it was solicited from other transmigrators. Most transmigrators couldn't write directly in classical Chinese or Ming-era vernacular, so most manuscripts had to be written by transmigrators in "new speech" and then "translated" by transmigrators with that ability.

These special propaganda pamphlets were largely compiled according to the principles of sex, politics, and secrets. The content reeked of pulp literature. Still, each issue had a certain focus, adjusted according to the current situation and target of attack.

In Zhang Haogu's hand was the table of contents for the latest batch of pamphlets, already approved and ready for printing. It listed twenty titles:

*What Three Dying Wishes Did the Wanli Emperor Leave Behind?*

*Wei Zhongxian Won the Emperor's Favor—But What Didn't He Know Until Death?*

*The Mastermind Behind the Persecution of the Donglin Party: The Eunuch Clique Expelled from the Capital*

*Coveted by 6 Emperors for 60 Years: The Most Sought-After Woman of the Great Ming*

*A Speech by the Chengzu Emperor Before Entering Nanjing*

*The Truth of the Tumu Crisis: What Did the Ming Army Really Sacrifice For?*

*Conflict During Reform: Zhang Juzheng Denounced Scholars as "Nation-Wrecking Demons"*

*Li Chengliang's Debauchery and Fierce Ways in the North*

*"Femme Fatale" Ren Daidai: The Brothel Dancer Who Was Actually a Pardoned Assassin*

*Eyewitness Accounts: How the Eunuch Clique and Donglin Party Bungled Everything*

*The Truth of the Moving-Palace Case*

*Scandalous Palace Secrets of the "Former Dynasty": The Ten Most Famous Beauties in Ming History*

...

These pamphlets typically ranged from ten to twenty thousand characters; even the longest didn't exceed fifty thousand. Each printing was only a few hundred to a thousand copies, which were then smuggled to the mainland for distribution. Because the subject matter was novel, the stories gripping, and the language plain, they were quite popular with the natives. In Guangdong, the special propaganda pamphlets distributed by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau through the Black Dragon Society system had already created a substantial underground-reading market. The originally free pamphlets were even being hoarded for resale, and crudely pirated editions—printed with clay movable type and ink—had already appeared. Zhou Dongtian had seriously considered whether to officially market these special propaganda pamphlets as popular reading in the Ming.

Zhang Haogu believed this phenomenon clearly reflected a severe shortage in the Ming's popular-reading market. The Publishing Guidance Group could do much more in this area. Recently, he'd supervised the revision of Jin Yong's works. Apart from *The Deer and the Cauldron* and *Sword Stained with Royal Blood*, all eleven other titles had been revised and were scheduled for gradual publication. Next came other publishing projects requiring revision...

"I'm working myself to death, and who knows if it's even effective?" he thought, placing the pamphlet table of contents on the desk. He retrieved the Truth Office's approval stamp from its box and pressed it onto the document. Seeing the bright red seal on the paper, he exhaled with satisfaction.
