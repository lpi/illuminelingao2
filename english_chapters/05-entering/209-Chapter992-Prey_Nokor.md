# Chapter 992 - Prey Nokor

Along the way, Ping Qiusheng patiently guided Quark, hoping he could understand his meaning: slave trade wasn't limited to the Bantam area. Whether Southeast Asian or white-skinned types, the transmigrator group would accept all comers. As for how to obtain more slaves, that was entirely up to Quark's methods. Before they even entered the city, in Quark's eyes, these refugees along the route had already become rolling silver coins and various valuable goods.

Just then, a man wearing a square cap boldly approached and tremulously asked in Guangzhou Mandarin whether the group came from the Great Ming. Upon receiving an affirmative answer, the man introduced himself, saying he was a Guangdong native who had been curious about learning from childhood. Having heard that various Western countries possessed remarkable skills, able to make "red barbarian cannons" and telescopes, he had traveled thousands of miles by merchant ship to the Southern countries to explore. That was already five years ago. Now homesick for his homeland, he had recently taken passage on a merchant ship to this place. But with the war in the north, ships traveling further north were becoming rare, and he hadn't been able to find a ship home.

This person was named Feng Shengyue. Perhaps eager to return home, he said many flattering things, expressing that he wasn't useless and wouldn't be deadweight on a merchant ship. Ping Qiusheng thought having someone familiar with the local area wasn't bad.

"Do you know all the local customs?" Ping Qiusheng asked.

"I have been traveling in these foreign lands for five years. Though I dare not say I know everything, I have some knowledge of these Southern Sea countries. Never mind just the customs here—I even speak the language. This place is now territory of the Chenla kingdom [Cambodia]. Local inhabitants call Ming Chinese merchants 'Zha Kun,' hence the place name. There were quite many overseas Chinese merchants, but once the war in the north began, maritime trade became difficult. So many returned home earlier. Recently, the northern fighting has intensified and merchant ships are afraid of being caught up in it, not daring to go north. I just came from Malacca, and arriving here, I too couldn't find a ship northward."

"We won't be going north for now either. We're still going to Siam."

"After going to Siam, you'll eventually return home. Why not take me along? I came all the way from Malacca and have quite a few observations along the way that might be useful to you gentlemen."

Ping Qiusheng thought that Southeast Asia obviously wouldn't have Ming spies specifically coming over. Having someone familiar with the local area beside him wasn't bad. He agreed to take him in. Feng Shengyue was overjoyed, hurriedly taking his leave to go pack his belongings. They agreed to meet at the city gate.

"If you don't find us at the city gate, just go to the dock and look for our ships. The ones flying the red, white, and blue flag."

The "Nine-Dash Flag's" color combination was red, white, and blue—very eye-catching. As long as Feng Shengyue paid a little attention, he would see it.

This trip's destination was Siam. Besides trading for rice, they also wanted to recruit some of the local Japanese volunteer corps. Ever since the merchant Yamada Nagamasa, who had unusual relations with Edo, had suddenly died, the volunteer corps of Japanese immigrants and converts that he had controlled had been fleeing to avoid suspicion of the king. If they could recruit some of these people now on the condition of returning them to Japan, it would be a good option for conducting Japan trade at Jeju Island in the future and other Northeast Asian strategies. Though Ping Qiusheng had some knowledge of Siamese history, the conspiracy theories involved remained murky.

Japanese in the 17th century were spread throughout Southeast Asia—the history of going to the Southern Seas didn't begin only in the 20th century. The predicament of too little land and too many people exploded in Japan much earlier and more severely than in China. Large numbers of Japanese had been scattered throughout Southeast Asia since the 16th century, serving as merchants, craftsmen, and mercenaries. Though they were no match for the Chinese in business operations, they were famous as mercenaries. Many notable events of the time had obscure Japanese mercenaries in the background. The English, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, and even the petty rulers of Southeast Asian states had all hired them.

In a state seriously lacking military strength, hiring Japanese as shock troops was obviously a good choice—not only in Southeast Asia, but Taiwan and Jeju Island could also use Japanese mercenaries.

Before long, the group arrived at the city walls. These gates were all built of black stone, with architecture very characteristic of the Khmer, quite similar to the style of Angkor Wat he had visited—this place was still Lower Cambodia, and the inhabitants were mainly Khmer. The Vietnamese wouldn't extend their influence here until a few years later.

Prey Nokor's city scale was still considerable—at least larger than all the county seats on Hainan Island. This was, after all, the viceroy's residence and the political and economic center of Lower Cambodia.

Why come to pay respects to this viceroy? In Ping Qiusheng's view, this was the key junction of the Mekong Delta. No matter how the future situation developed, this would certainly be a population center—otherwise, Saigon in the later era wouldn't have developed. Where there was population, there were various demands. And when it came to commodity dumping, no one in this timeline could compete with the transmigrator group. Lingao's reach currently couldn't extend this far. Operation Engine would probably take over two more years to basically complete. These two-plus years of business couldn't be left entirely to the Dutch. Moreover, even Dutch shipping capacity couldn't fully satisfy the transmigrator group. So naturally, more trade was always better.

Feng Shengyue was already waiting at the city gate. His luggage was simple—just one bundle and a straw hat. Ping Qiusheng noticed that the straw hat on his head was Lingao-made—had Lingao's straw hats already sold this far?

He asked where his straw hat came from. Feng Shengyue was quite surprised that Ping Qiusheng had taken an interest in his straw hat. He had bought it at a Chinese shop during his travels, and had worn it for over a year now. Though it hadn't broken, it was dirty and tattered.

"Take good care of this straw hat. It's very meaningful." Elder Ping said meaningfully.

Feng Shengyue was completely baffled and could only mumble some vague responses.

Passing through the bustling main street, the group arrived before the viceroy's palace. The palace didn't look particularly large—by Chinese standards, it would only count as a rich household's residence.

The viceroy's palace was both his living quarters and the place where he conducted governance. Some external government offices were set up within the palace. Feng Shengyue was very familiar with local conditions. Going in to find someone, he quickly located an interpreter.

Ping Qiusheng watched him jabber and gesture with the interpreter for a while, then the interpreter went inside. Feng Shengyue seemed confident, smiling as he said: "Elder Ping, the viceroy will receive us shortly."

"That easy?" Though Ping Qiusheng had estimated the chances of seeing the viceroy were good, he hadn't expected it to be this easy.

"It's nothing—the viceroy very much welcomes merchants to visit him."

Merchants requesting to see the viceroy wasn't unusual. As long as the viceroy wasn't busy, he generally didn't refuse—regardless of their purposes or whether the viceroy could satisfy them, merchants always had to present gifts. This was a significant source of income for His Highness the Viceroy.

The announcement complete, the interpreter came back out and invited them in.

"Leave weapons and blades. Only five people may enter." The interpreter announced to them.

After discussion, Ping Qiusheng brought Feng Shengyue and three Special Reconnaissance soldiers inside, with the rest waiting outside. Everyone removed their daggers, but kept their pistols well concealed.

Of this group, except for Feng Shengyue, everyone had pistols. The Special Reconnaissance soldiers had submachine guns. Even if something happened, once gunfire started and those outside rushed in, they needn't fear even an ambush of one or two hundred.

Obviously, the hypothetical ambush didn't materialize. The negotiations proceeded in a joyful atmosphere and reached a very satisfactory conclusion. After receiving the fine gifts from the Australians, Viceroy Chan Chai was happy to provide all manner of conveniences for expanding the Australian goods market here, including the matter of establishing a trading post. He even expressed willingness to participate more deeply in this business—he was willing to supply various goods the Australians needed and was also willing to distribute various Australian goods brought in—especially Chinese sundries.

Southeast Asian countries of this era had generally backward handicraft levels. Daily necessities were entirely dependent on Chinese merchants importing from the Great Ming. Even the Spanish from "civilized countries"—the daily necessities of Manila depended on Chinese merchants' supply. If Chinese ships arrived late, life for Spanish ladies became unbearable.

The reason Viceroy Chan Chai was so enthusiastic was actually from necessity. With ever more Champa refugees flooding in and the Nguyen sharpening their knives to the north, how long he could remain Viceroy of Prey Nokor was uncertain. He understood that Champa couldn't resist the Vietnamese assault. Once Champa was finished, Prey Nokor's fall was only a matter of time. So he rather meant to grab what he could and leave. The Australian goods showed him hope for making money. If he could make a fortune in trade with the Australians, when the time came to retreat to Phnom Penh, whether or not he remained viceroy wouldn't matter. After all, Prey Nokor had rice and timber in abundance—rather than letting it benefit the Vietnamese for nothing, better to give it to the Australians. At least the Australians were willing to pay in money and Australian goods.

Ping Qiusheng's side also got what they wanted: trade permission, duty-free anchorage, approval for Australians to buy land and build trading posts, freedom to hire workers, and so on.

The viceroy also, per his request, wrote a letter to the Cambodian king asking to take in the Japanese who had recently fled into Cambodia and have them escorted to Prey Nokor for departure—completely resolving the Japanese problem within the Cambodian kingdom.

Ping Qiusheng used the mirrors and daily necessities he had brought for trading, exchanging them for two boatloads of rice. Viceroy Chan Chai indicated that rice stocks weren't large, but gathering more wouldn't be difficult. When the fleet returned here for resupply, he could prepare more. As long as the Australian gentlemen had demand, rice here was not lacking. As for local products, as long as the Australians wanted them, he could organize the supply.

Things proceeded very smoothly, so the fleet departed in a happy, pleasant atmosphere—the fleet carried ample supplies as it turned northwest. Ping Qiusheng planned to go directly to Bangkok rather than Phnom Penh. If he could complete both the rice and Japanese recruitment missions in Bangkok, then Phnom Penh held little interest for him—it had neither many trade resources nor was it on their necessary route.
