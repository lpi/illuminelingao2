# Chapter 846: A Scene of Devastation

Amidst the bustle, someone had already brought up a thick stack of calling cards and gift lists. Guo Yi took them and casually flipped through, sighing inwardly: *Indeed, might makes right and strength wins friendship are the same in any era.* Compared to the scene of deserted doorways and panicked flight the previous year, it truly moved one to endless reflection.

The calling cards were of various kinds—some merely paying respects, some inviting him as a guest, and of course some eagerly requesting an audience. Yi Liu categorized them in the guest ledger according to the owners' status and position, closeness of relations, and respective purposes. Some required return cards, some required receiving, and some need not be bothered with—just say "The master is not home." As for gifts, some should be accepted, some should not, and some should be half-accepted and half-returned. All this was decided by Zheng Shangjie. Although she rarely appeared in the Guangzhou Station's external dealings, she actually played the role of "lady of the house." She not only managed all general affairs but also handled all matters of reciprocal courtesy.

Yi Liu flipped through the cards, set aside several important ones Guo Yi had indicated, and took the rest to Zheng Shangjie to handle.

First was Gao Ju's card, with an enclosed banquet invitation. The banquet naturally had to be attended. The Guangzhou Station not only had outstanding accounts to settle with him, but also needed to thank him in person for looking after the Guangzhou Station's interests these many months. Of course, this also encompassed future cooperation plans for the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and Colonial Trade Department's entry into the capital.

Second was Liang Cunhou's, likewise a banquet invitation card. Although the Liang family had not been of great help during this turmoil, thanks to their reputation, the Cihu Hall (Charity Hall) that the Guangzhou Station used to absorb and circulate vagrants had been preserved. Because Cihu Hall held considerable property and land in its hands, quite a few people had been eyeing it at the time. The Liang family had also stepped forward to protect several of Purple Enterprises' workers who had failed to escape in time and been caught. This favor had to be repaid.

Third was Li Xijue's card. This person was presently the liaison designated by Li Fengjie for dealings with Guangdong officialdom.

Besides these three, the other cards posed no urgency. As for the group of young masters circling around Pei Lixiu, once Purple Brightness Tower was somewhat restored to order, she could entertain them herself.

The architects who had accompanied the team from Lingao Construction Company—Mei Lin and Li Xiaolü—walked in. They had just conducted a detailed survey of the destruction throughout the Huifu Street building complex to formulate a repair and renovation plan.

Both wore awkward Ming-style attire. Mei Lin wore a Liuhe Yitong Hat; Li Xiaolü wore a crooked fake hair bun. They looked exceedingly uncomfortable.

This was the core section of the residence, with Political Security personnel guarding at the courtyard gate. Except for Senators and their secretaries and classified document clerks, neither naturalized citizens nor local workers could enter without being summoned. It was a place where one could speak relatively freely.

Guo Yi greeted them while instructing Yi Liu to pour tea.

"How is the situation? Will repairs take a long time?"

Mei Lin took a sip of tea, stretched his legs, and tugged at his clothes: "It won't come to that. The buildings themselves are not severely damaged—it's the building components that are heavily damaged. Not much masonry work, but quite a bit of carpentry. As for how long repairs will take, that depends on how quickly you can provide components here. I looked at the remaining parts, and much of the craftsmanship is very elaborate. I'm afraid it cannot be completed in less than one or two months."

"Yes." Guo Yi nodded. "Just recruit more local carpenters and have them work faster. As for wood, check Gao Ju's warehouse. He has fine timber stored for many years there that can be used immediately."

"Looking at the situation, we didn't bring enough interior components. I'm afraid we will have to order more from Lingao." Li Xiaolü consulted his notebook. "We don't yet know what condition Purple Brightness Tower is in..."

"It won't be much better." Zheng Shangjie interjected, sighing.

"I plan to proceed as follows," Mei Lin said. "First concentrate on restoring security and access control facilities everywhere, and on inspecting walls and roofs. Then restore the storefront portions of Purple Treasure House and Purple Sincerity Record to resume business as soon as possible. As for the residence..."

"First restore the front areas for receiving guests and entertaining. The garden should also be restored as soon as possible if feasible. These are where we socialize and interact. Having just returned to Guangzhou, there are many social events and guest-entertaining matters—we need a proper place."

"Good." Mei Lin noted the requirements in his notebook. "I will also arrange for someone to repair the inner residence first—at least restore the plumbing and bathroom equipment first so you can use them."

"Tomorrow I want to go see Purple Brightness Tower's condition." Li Xiaolü said. "To estimate the construction period and materials."

The next day, Zheng Shangjie and Pei Lixiu accompanied Li Xiaolü and others to Purple Brightness Tower, inspecting the situation on-site. Opening the tightly locked main door, although it had already been cleaned once, the interior was still a complete mess.

As Guo Yi had estimated, Purple Brightness Tower's destruction was no less severe. Half the carpets had been cut away; all the glass in the windows had been smashed; the window sashes and carved screens had been dismantled and taken. The glass chandeliers had vanished without a trace. Although the large bath pool had been cleaned, the statues, plumbing hardware, and tiles above were largely missing. Obviously someone had also attempted to dismantle the plumbing equipment and fixtures in the private rooms, causing extensive destruction. Flush toilets, bathtubs, and various pipes were almost all destroyed or seriously depleted. Because the pipes had been damaged, water from the cistern had leaked out, leaving watermarks of erosion everywhere. Furniture, furnishings, and other items inside the building were almost entirely gone; even the animal-powered machine used to pump water up to the water tower had been dismantled.

Many items were piled in the main hall—these were objects "returned" by the government, a miscellaneous heap of junk. Zheng Shangjie looked through them; many were simply refuse to make up numbers. Some were indeed Purple Brightness Tower items but had been ruined beyond recognition. Several large sofas originally placed in Pei Lixiu's "salon" had their brocade upholstery ripped open, exposing the kapok stuffing inside. Zheng Shangjie looked—the springs were already gone.

The full-length dressing mirror and large grandfather clock from Pei Lixiu's boudoir had vanished without a trace. These two items had been taken by someone, their current whereabouts unknown. Her vanity and Zheng Shangjie's desk were still present—fine rosewood furniture—but for some reason someone had carefully chopped them into pieces with an axe.

"They were looking for secret drawers." Zheng Shangjie sighed regretfully. "What a pity—that desk was very useful."

Pei Lixiu was so angry she could not speak. Seeing her carefully decorated boudoir and salon ruined beyond recognition, she nearly cried. Zheng Shangjie also felt intense anger. This was simply wanton destruction!

After Mei Lin and Li Xiaolü surveyed the premises, they also devised a restoration plan. Restoration here was not urgent. Moreover, building materials that needed to be ordered from Lingao were considerably more numerous than for the Huifu Street side. The construction period had to be scheduled later. Although Pei Lixiu was dissatisfied, she had no choice but to accept it.

"I don't think you need to rush for the moment." Zheng Shangjie sat in the same sedan chair with her, counseling gently. "Once the Huifu Street side is repaired, you can stay on Huifu Street first. Here, first invite all the past regular customers once. Then make a round of calls. It doesn't matter if the building isn't repaired. Gather the network of relationships first."

"There is no choice but to do that." Pei Lixiu was dejected.

"It's fine. A fresh opening is only a matter of time. Besides, hasn't the Planning Bureau approved our flagship store plan? The No. 2 store will be much larger. Let us plan specifically first."

Guo Yi went out every day to pay calls or hosted guests at the residences of local famous courtesans. He first met with Gao Ju. Gao Ju's face was full of enthusiasm; the relationship between them seemed far warmer than before. Gao Ju declared: "This can be considered having shared hardship together—the bond between us brothers is different from before." Guo Yi understood this was the result of them having fully demonstrated their strength. Gao's family and life were all in Guangzhou, and his source of wealth was on the sea. Of course he had to cultivate a friendlier relationship with this maritime power that was vaguely rising.

Besides words of thanks, both sides discussed the work of clearing up remaining accounts. They also had in-depth discussions about the next steps of cooperation. When Gao Ju heard that the Australians would be bringing in large quantities of spices at Xiangshan Ao, he knew a new opportunity to make money had arrived.

Spices were major consumer goods in China at that time, and one of the few products China was willing to import in large quantities. Besides edible spices, other incense materials from the South Seas—such as benzoin and ambergris—also commanded a large market in China. If the Australians could supply them in abundance, this source of wealth would be no less significant than his current Australian goods business.

"Easy to say, easy to say." Gao Ju nodded repeatedly. "I won't hide it from you, brother—this elder brother here has quite a few goods that can be sold. If brother has ships that can transport overseas, this elder brother has complete goods, as much as you want."

"That could not be better." Guo Yi thought, *This immediately brings a big deal for Hong Kong.* Gao Ju was both a major importer and major exporter. With him as the baseline, goods brought by the Dutch and goods shipped out all had destinations. The Senators merely needed to change hands in Hong Kong.

Guo Yi said: "There is another matter I would like to consult you about, brother."

"Whatever it is, brother, just speak."

"Shopkeeper Wen wishes to send some people to the capital to do business," Guo Yi watched Gao Ju's face closely, "and would like your help, brother."

Gao Ju's face tensed momentarily, then relaxed. He did not answer immediately, thinking before asking: "Between us brothers, let us not speak outsiders' words. You have now established a foothold in Qiongzhou and now wish to enter the capital—what exactly are you after?"

"Making money, of course."

Gao Ju smiled slightly, leaning back against his chair and shaking his head: "Brother, what you say is too distant. Although this elder brother is not someone who likes to pry, some things still need to be known clearly before one can be at ease."

Guo Yi said: "We crossed distant seas and came to the Great Ming for the purpose of doing business and making money. Going to the capital is naturally still for making money. Unavoidably, we also need to observe the Imperial Court's mood, probe the direction of the wind, and ask you, brother, to introduce a few 'friends'—lest one day the Court's thunderous wrath stirs..."

"Hehe." Gao Ju laughed and nodded repeatedly. "Shopkeeper Wen is indeed extraordinary."
