# Chapter 975 - The Daoist's Crisis

"You're simply making up prices as you go—" The red-clad girl voiced her objection again.

Min Zhanlian sneered: "What, does your sect have no rules of rank and precedence at all?"

The remark was both cutting and provocative. Resentment showed in the middle-aged man's eyes. But the red-clad girl wasn't an ordinary subordinate—she was a Guardian Envoy dispatched from the Shandong main altar. Though young and lower in position than him, she wasn't someone he could casually scold.

"This humble seat agrees to these terms." He nodded.

"And daily meals," Min Zhanlian said. "There's practically nothing fit for human consumption here—you'll also have to provide. Vegetables, meat, wine, and tea."

"Agreed." The middle-aged man signaled, and someone brought over a voucher booklet.

"This is a voucher for the Wang Family Inn on County Street in the city. A courtyard has been prepared for you. All food and expenses go on the voucher."

"Efficient work." Min Zhanlian expressed satisfaction. "If I need to contact you, how do I reach you?"

"Draw a symbol behind the Wang Family Inn, and someone will meet you." The middle-aged man said. "You won't see this humble seat again. Future contacts will be through this Envoy here."

That afternoon, Min Zhanlian's team arrived in full at the Wang Family Inn. When they showed the voucher, the attendant welcomed them in without a word, hurrying to serve tea and water. Once tea was ready, as if on command, all the staff simultaneously withdrew from the courtyard.

But Min Zhanlian's people didn't bother washing up or changing clothes. They first inspected every room and corner for anything suspicious. Before long, the middle-aged man with the local accent returned.

"It's not a black inn," he said quietly. "Definitely an old establishment."

"Hmm."

"I just went around back—the proprietor's family are also believers."

Min Zhanlian nodded: "As expected."

The middle-aged man he had brought was a native of southern Shandong, very familiar with local conditions. Min Zhanlian had specifically hired him after accepting this job. The man had mixed in the underworld for years and had extensive *jianghu* experience.

After he withdrew, the oldest rider—whom Min Zhanlian respectfully called "Uncle He"—came to report that everything was settled. Warning signals had been set at doors, windows, and eaves. He was Min Zhanlian's steward, specifically responsible for the team's food, lodging, and travel. Given the heavy responsibility, he was one of Min Zhanlian's trusted confidants.

"Those not on duty should rest in shifts starting now. Send the scouts out to gather information!" Min Zhanlian instructed. "We need to get a good look at what kind of deity this Master Dao is."

The scouts were three unremarkable-looking people—two men and one woman. All were the type who left no impression at a glance. They were skilled at disguise and transformation, able to pass in any social circle.

"Yes," Uncle He acknowledged, then said quietly: "I wonder if the food and drink here can be trusted?"

"Should be no problem." Min Zhanlian said in a low voice. "There's no grudge between us. They've paid money to hire us to kill someone—why would they harm us first?"

"Still better to be careful," Uncle He said. "These White Lotus Sect remnants are said to have sorcery. We should guard against them drugging us or casting spells."

Min Zhanlian chuckled: "Uncle He, you worry too much. It's true they can do some tricks, but no great undertaking in history has ever succeeded through magic. Not to mention Xu Hongru who failed ten years ago—even Zhang Jue's powers made even the Han court prostrate in admiration. When he started his rebellion, millions of Yellow Turbans rose like the wind, yet he still lost. The more you fear, the more they can work their mischief. 'Treat the strange as ordinary, and the strange defeats itself.'"

Just as he was speaking, someone reported: A visitor had come to call.

"Show them in." Min Zhanlian nodded. No doubt this was an envoy from the sect with new information.

The visitor was indeed an envoy from the sect—the red-clad girl from earlier.

But now, to avoid attention, she had changed into a black cloak.

"What news does the young lady bring?"

"The man you're dealing with goes to the gruel station every day to give medicine and treat patients." Without pleasantries or titles, the girl spoke coldly and directly. "The Altar Chief wants you to kill him in the most bizarre manner possible."

"When it comes to bizarre methods, we ordinary mortals probably lack that level of skill." Min Zhanlian smiled. "Surely your sect's various arcane arts would be more suitable."

"Isn't that what you called 'trickery'?" The girl showed her teeth in a smile. "'Can't accomplish anything great.'"

Min Zhanlian was instantly on guard—those words had been spoken barely a cup of tea ago. His men had set up secret lookouts all around front and back; there were no hidden chambers or tunnels here. It was absolutely impossible for anyone to have hidden and eavesdropped—yet this woman had somehow heard!

"This matter is difficult..."

"Hmph. You just want money, don't you?" The girl sneered. "The Ma estate master of Qingcheng Mountain—his whole family died suicidally 'possessed by evil'—wasn't that your work? Add fifty taels, and he must die spectacularly—'divine retribution.'"

Zhang Yingchen still didn't know someone wanted to "divinely execute" him. Though suspicious figures were watching and trailing him, Zhang Yingchen felt he hadn't done anything to provoke anyone. Whoever they were, they shouldn't go so far as to actually kill him.

He had considered the possibility that some local secret society might want him dead out of competitive impulse—this was always possible.

The secret societies in Shandong were complex and numerous. The major ones included the Wenxiang Sect and the Luo Sect; as for various offshoots and secret societies, the varieties were countless. The Wenxiang Sect was famous and the most powerful. Xu Hongru of the White Lotus Sect had been a disciple of Wang Sen, the Wenxiang Sect leader from Jizhou in Zhili. The White Lotus Sect had operated in Shandong for over twenty years, with more than two million followers, deeply rooted with enormous influence. Though their Tianqi Year Two uprising had failed and the White Lotus Sect had suffered heavy blows in Shandong, the remnants still retained their strength, continuing to hide and wait for opportunity. In Chongzhen Year Two, they had attacked Laiyang. That same year, remnant Zhu Bingnan had also attacked the government in Suizhou, Henan. As for the Luo Sect, it was indigenous—its founder was the Shandong native Luo Qing. It had considerable strength among the canal transport troops, and its offshoots were many.

From his readings of historical materials, Zhang Yingchen knew that among the larger sects active in Shandong during the late Ming—the Luo Sect, Wenxiang Sect, Hongyang Sect, Huangtian Sect, and Yiqizaoxiang Sect—the Hongyang Sect had prophecies of the Red Sheep Tribulation, claimed descent from the Luo Sect, and preferred to cultivate upper-class connections. The Yiqizaoxiang Sect resembled a more shamanized form of Daoism and had always proclaimed non-participation in rebellions. It was the Huangtian Sect, founded by Tiger-Eye Meditation Master Li Bin during the Jiajia reign, that was closely connected to Li Chuang in the late Ming. During the late Ming missionary activities, they had widely spread the "Eighteen Son" prophecy for Li Chuang.

"Who might want me dead?" This was something Zhang Yingchen had been pondering lately. He currently had more information and more timely updates on the Luo Sect—there were some former Luo Sect believers in the Shandong Catholic Church. Apparently they had somehow confused Catholic veneration of the Virgin Mary with Wusheng Laomu [Eternal Mother] worship. Through them, Lu Wenyuan could obtain much information to send to him.

But this hadn't improved his situation at all. Three beggars kept watch at the front and back gates of the Daoist temple every day. Whenever he went out, he could feel someone following him. No matter where he went, he encountered men and women, old and young, secretly following and watching him. Several nights he had been awakened by extremely faint footsteps on the roof.

Zhang Yingchen was very alarmed—clearly his status in the enemy's eyes had greatly risen. Very likely, an operation targeting him was being planned.

He didn't know what his opponents intended. If they wanted his life, they could take it at any time. Their holding back clearly included an intention to force him to leave.

Zhang Yingchen ultimately didn't have the resolution to martyr himself at any moment. While desperately hoping his requested bodyguards would arrive soon, he also had to seriously consider leaving this place.

But his missionary personnel hadn't arrived yet. If he simply left, all the painstaking effort he had put into treating and saving people these past days would be completely wasted—he couldn't bear it.

One day, having just returned from the gruel station, he saw a sedan chair stopped at the Daoist temple gate. Mingqing and several men dressed as servants were waiting for him.

It turned out there was a large estate called Dadianzhang north of the city, where a gentry member named Zhuang Qian resided. He had formerly been an official in the capital and had just retired to his hometown. The county magistrate and local gentry had just visited him, hoping he would help with disaster relief. But unexpectedly, shortly after returning home, Master Zhuang had contracted the seasonal epidemic and was bedridden. His family had heard of Zhang Yingchen's renowned medical skills and sent for him.

Hearing that gentry were summoning him, Zhang Yingchen's spirits rose. Treating patients at a gentry household meant at least a few days of good food and drink. The days of living in a broken temple, eating black flatbreads, and drinking bitter water could finally ease up somewhat. Besides, staying in the gentry's fortified compound would also be safer than here. He gathered his medicines, took his disciples, and went.

Arriving at the Zhuang household in Dadianzhang and examining the patient, he found that Master Zhuang had merely suffered from summer heat combined with careless eating, causing incessant diarrhea. He was showing signs of dehydration and had gradually become unable to keep down food or water.

For Zhang Yingchen, this was nothing serious—he had seen many such cases recently and had developed a complete, effective treatment protocol. With his "miracle medicine," the cure rate was practically one hundred percent.

Thus Zhang Yingchen once again enjoyed "VIP" treatment. Though he had grown accustomed to patients' reverence and preferential treatment, in this current place, reverence from the wealthy was far more practical than reverence from starving refugees. Zhang Yingchen found this place much better than the broken Daoist temple: only three or four *li* from the city, convenient for going to the gruel station and the surrounding area for treatment and preaching. Dadianzhang was also a fortified compound—strangers couldn't just wander in. At the very least, his chances of having his head cut off while sleeping were much reduced. He then produced various additional "symptoms" that alarmed Master Zhuang and his family—in short, Master Zhuang's illness required long-term treatment, or it would easily recur. Thus the Daoist Master naturally settled into the residence at Master Zhuang's invitation and the family's earnest entreaties. However, he kept the broken Daoist temple rented, just in case.
