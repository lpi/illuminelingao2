# Chapter 1050: Strategy for Jeju

Although the Jeju Government Office (*Gammyeong*) was the grandest and best house in the entire Jeju City and even the entire Jeju Island, it still looked shabby to the eye—Feng Zongze recalled his feeling when visiting the Yongfu Palace back then: does this even count as a government office (*Yamen*)!

The two wandered around the Government Office led by a captured steward clerk.

The architectural style of the Government Office was similar to that of the Ming Dynasty in microcosm, but the scale and grandeur were far inferior. Not to mention the Ming-Qing county *Yamens* in Shanxi that many Senators had visited, even the *Yamens* of several remote and small counties on Hainan Island were grander than this.

"...This Gwandeokjeong Pavilion was built by Jeju Magistrate Shin Suk-cheong during the reign of King Sejong. Later it was rebuilt by Magistrate Yang Zan during the reign of King Seongjong," the minor clerk said attentively—the deaths of the Jeju Magistrate and the Judge made him cherish his own little life even more, lest he annoy this group of strange Wokou.

The two looked at this very Chinese-style pavilion together. Although called a pavilion (*Ting*), it was actually like a tiered building (*Louge*). In front of the pavilion was a large empty field paved with yellow sand. This was where the Magistrate and Judge practiced martial arts. The archery targets from the competition held by Jeju officials here a few days ago still stood.

"When was King Sejong from?" Nangong Wudi asked.

Feng Zongze said: "I don't know either. By the way, the Joseon Dynasty uses the Ming Dynasty's reign titles; just ask and we'll know."

Immediately asking the clerk, the clerk said the reign title was Xuande (1426–1435). That is to say, it had a history of nearly two hundred years.

The characters on the plaque were written beautifully. The clerk said this was the handwriting of Prince Anpyeong, the third son of King Sejong.

"The calligraphy is good. Rare, rare." Feng Zongze said this from the bottom of his heart. Like most Senators, his handwriting was basically unpresentable except for his signature. The clerk felt baffled—in his opinion, Prince Anpyeong's calligraphy was certainly not bad, but it couldn't be called rare.

Although the layout of the Government Office was a bit small, compared to the even shabbier civilian houses, the houses of the Jeju Government Office were still quite exquisite: there were raised foundations above the ground, all built with brick and tile structures. Inside the houses, floors were laid, and there were ground stoves and *Ondol* (heated floors). Walking inside was very warm. The disadvantage was that the ceiling was really too low. For people of Nangong Wudi and Feng Zongze's height, they could almost touch the ceiling by raising an arm.

"Really makes one feel oppressed," Nangong Wudi said dissatisfiedly.

Feng Zongze said: "Building small houses is for warmth..."

"Beijing is colder, yet I haven't seen the Emperor and *Yamens* build houses so low and small. Isn't this Jeju Island still subtropical?"

"It's called subtropical, but it actually snows. In winter, it drops to freezing point. About the same as Jiangnan. Not to mention it's the Little Ice Age now," Feng Zongze said. "The difference you speak of is actually the gap in national power." Unlike Nangong Wudi who learned Korean by himself in the business field, Feng Zongze learned it specially, so he also had a certain understanding of Korean history and culture.

"Never mind the house, look at these tables and chairs," Feng Zongze slapped the table, "Pine and elm. Don't compare with Beijing; even compared to the furniture in Hainan's county *Yamens* and wealthy households, how is it?"

"That's true. At least in Hainan, rosewood and such aren't rare items."

"Actually, Joseon at the end of the Ming Dynasty was quite miserable." Feng Zongze saw with satisfaction that the room chosen as the General Headquarters had been cleaned spotless and still smelled of disinfectant water. He sat heavily on the chair and took off his velvet hat, "In the Little Ice Age, natural disasters are frequent, and neither the Ming nor the Later Jin are kind characters; they all come to this neighbor nearby to 'harvest grain' (*plunder*). To the south, the East River Command (*Dongjiang Zhen*) constantly demands grain; to the west, the Later Jin frequently invades. The Joseon Dynasty is exhausted coping with it, and it's a miracle that it managed to survive and continue its dynasty for three hundred years."

1631 was just another bleak year in the half-century of miserable days for the Joseon Dynasty during the late Ming and early Qing transition. Since spring, there had been drought until July and August, affecting a wide area, and the King frequently prayed for rain; after August, there were frost and rainstorms everywhere until November, so much so that ministers all asked to resign to appease heaven's anger. In May of this year, the Later Jin invaded Anju and other places again, not retreating until July and August. A riot occurred in the East River Command entrenched on the border of the Liaodong Peninsula and Korea; Commander Huang Long was imprisoned for a time. The island was extremely short of grain and constantly demanded grain transport. The Joseon Dynasty, in its own very difficult state, dared not disobey.

Nangong Wudi said dissatisfiedly: "Are you feeling benevolent?"

"Of course, seeing the people of the Joseon Dynasty living in dire straits, and the brilliance of the Senate not yet shining here, I am very pained," Feng Zongze pretended to say sorrowfully.

"Fine, you, Little Sun, just shine on Jeju Island," Nangong Wudi roared, "General Feng, *Mansei*!"

"Mansei, Mansei," Feng Zongze said. "Let's take inventory of the loot on Jeju Island first."

Occupying the three cities brought at least half of Jeju's population under their direct control.

According to historical data, interrogation of captured officials, and seized registers, they roughly knew that there were fifty thousand people on Jeju Island now—even Joseon officials didn't know the exact number. If according to the numbers on the registers, excluding soldiers, there should be 63,093 people. But the captured Household Division clerk said this was impossible: because since the reign of King Sejong, the local population was allowed to migrate to the Korean mainland during famine years. For many years, the population had been in a state of outflow. Although supplemented by exiles, Jeju Island had been in a state of food shortage for a long time, and many people fled. Therefore, the actual population should be around fifty thousand.

Of this population, more than half were concentrated in Jeju City and nearby villages. This was also why Feng Zongze set up the headquarters here. In addition, Jeju City itself was a transportation hub for entering and leaving the island, facing the Korean mainland directly.

There were nine frequently used harbors with relatively good conditions on Jeju Island—exactly the locations of the "Nine Garrisons." The one with the most traffic with the Korean mainland, besides Jeju, was Jocheon-po east of Jeju. There were official relay stations and ships there, specifically undertaking official exchanges between the Korean mainland and Jeju Island. So while taking Jeju, Xue Ziliang was already ordered to take Jocheon-po to control the local large ships and boatmen.

"We should immediately occupy all garrisons and control all ports," Nangong Wudi said urgently.

"It doesn't matter. With just these few people, completely blockading the whole island is impossible," Feng Zongze said. "Generally, poor people won't run. Even if rich people run, what can they take away?"

Completely controlling the ports was meaningless. The strait between Jeju Island and the Korean mainland wasn't wide, only a few dozen kilometers. Plus with the Kuroshio Current, anyone determined to run could reach the Korean shore holding a bathtub. Besides, if fleeing for life, one only needed to bring some valuables and dry food; a small boat was enough.

The special task force's maritime power was limited and could only blockade a few large ports. Moreover, there were many rivers on Jeju Island, impossible to control all. Wealthy families could easily escape by taking small boats from these rivers if prepared.

But even if they ran, the problem wasn't big: Jeju's wealth was mainly the cattle and horses on the island. To transport cattle and horses away required large ships. Except for a few official ships, Jeju Island had no large ships at all. Rich people running away would definitely not bring cumbersome cattle and horses, only valuables—for the Senate, it was better if rich people ran; the cattle, horses, and real estate they left behind would become spoils of war justifiably.

"If there aren't enough people, we have to raise a huge team. Collaborators must be greatly available!" Nangong Wudi said. The performance of the Public Security Army Japanese Company satisfied him greatly, so much so that he suddenly had a great fondness for the term "Public Security Army." "With so many official slaves on the island, they can't possibly support the Joseon Dynasty wholeheartedly, right? Getting a few puppet... no, Public Security Army companies shouldn't be a problem."

"Right, we should start doing it immediately—nationalist sentiment isn't strong these days, completely usable." Feng Zongze also nodded. Their numbers were limited; whether regular army or Public Security Army, they had to be kept as mobile forces. Deploying occupation forces everywhere was beyond their reach.

They calculated that each city should arm at least one Public Security Army company equipped with cold weapons. Weapons were not hard to solve: whether confiscated Joseon soldiers' weapons or weapons in government armories, picking out three to five hundred usable ones was achievable.

As for the source of soldiers, start with official slaves. Just in Jeju City and surrounding areas, there were seven or eight thousand official slaves suffering from hunger and cold. Selecting three hundred with great bitterness and deep hatred certainly wouldn't be difficult.

"We should do the same as in Hainan back then, let each place establish a liaison system first, ordering various villages in the countryside to pay tribute and provide labor, thereby gradually cutting into the grassroots," Nangong Wudi suggested again.

"Good. But our first thing is still to consolidate the cities."

After detailed calculation, it was decided to send a platoon and a work team each to Daejeong and Jeongui as the core of the occupation forces. The Seongsan base would be controlled by the Navy. The main force of the remaining troops, including the labor squadron, would deliver to Jeju City. After all, the spoils of war here were the richest and needed focused digestion.

The first step was to clear the houses in the city. The circumference of Jeju City was three thousand nine hundred and ten paces, more than double the size of the prefectural capital Qiongshan County Seat in Hainan. Besides ordinary commoners' residential streets and shops, a large number were "official houses."

The quality of official houses varied; many were for housing official slaves exiled locally. Because official slaves were mobile—some built their own houses after being on the island for a long time, some were assigned to other places on the island for farming and grazing—many houses were empty. The houses for official slaves were very crude, but at least they could shelter from wind and rain. They were just right for accommodating Shandong refugees.

The disadvantage was poor sanitary conditions; skin diseases and parasites were rampant, requiring strict disinfection.

However, there were many vacant lots in the city, very convenient for building temporary camps. Especially, water sources were quite abundant, which could supply water for purification and daily use in refugee camps. Although the city wall of Jeju was a bit tragic, it was a wall after all, which could implement effective refugee control and prevent them from escaping and running around.
