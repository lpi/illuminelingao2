# Chapter 1011 Warship

Although different reactionary academic authorities raised various unforgivable shortcomings of muzzle-loading rifled cannons—especially those "fatal" problems of muzzle-loaders: slow firing rate, large footprint, and many other deficiencies—the Planning Bureau believed that at the current stage, these shortcomings wouldn't create "life-or-death" dangers for the Navy in combat.

The Armstrong breech-loading cannons with screw-thread breeches that the Ordnance Department could currently produce in small quantities and equip to coastal artillery weren't ideal in actual use. The breech-locking was particularly difficult; hammers had to be used in actual operation to reach the tightened state. Besides being able to load from the breech, whether in loading speed, cannon range, or accuracy, they didn't obviously surpass Dahlgren rifled cannons, but production complexity was much greater.

As for mature, reliable interrupted-screw breeches, that would inevitably touch upon rubber and asbestos that the Industrial Department had always felt powerless about—used to manufacture gas-sealing plugs.

Although some proposed new plans: a breech mechanism using horizontal wedge breeches plus metal gas rings, not requiring rubber and producible with current industrial capacity. However, Dahlgren cannons again won on process simplicity and material simplicity. Although the Planning Bureau ultimately approved experimental manufacture of two cannons using horizontal wedge breeches plus metal gas rings, they obviously weren't preparing to mass-produce them soon.

Planning Bureau representative Sun Xiao explained the reasons for choosing Dahlgren rifled cannons at a General Staff Equipment Department meeting: "Since the Navy using sailing warships with smoothbore cannons never complained about slow cannon loading, we believe using rifled cannons with range and accuracy far superior to smoothbores on hybrid-powered warships won't be a serious problem."

Behind the Planning Bureau's stinginess lay the steel industry's capacity bottleneck. Although the Maniao Steel Complex's blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces had started production, the production situation wasn't satisfactory. The shortage of qualified workers and administrative personnel seriously affected further capacity expansion.

Lin Shenhe stopped his bike outside the work shed and parked it. He saw on specialized racks in an open area a row of newly produced Dahlgren cannon barrels. Although cast iron barrels, the barrel surfaces were regular and smooth. Lin Shenhe stopped his bicycle, touched the barrel and muzzle, then used the bike lamp's light to observe the rifling inside the barrel. The Machinery and Metallurgy departments' craftsmanship was getting better and better.

The Maniao Industrial Complex could now produce very good quality pig iron ingots. Using reverberatory furnaces to refine molten iron, they could manufacture excellent quality molten iron for casting cannons—before Lingao had its own blast furnaces, the imported pig iron used for casting cannons was refined through reverberatory furnaces.

Farther away were piles of gun carriages, rails, and metal fittings for installation, faintly gleaming with metallic luster under dim lighting.

When he walked into the work shed, it was smoky inside. Blueprints were spread on tables. Several people were discussing around the blueprints.

Lin Shenhe greeted Zhou Ke and the others.

"Muzzle-loaders really are inconvenient to load." Although Zhou Ke wasn't any naval talent and didn't know much about weapons, anyone who walked around the deck and looked at the cannon and deck blueprints would understand muzzle-loaders' problems.

Muzzle-loading cannons after firing had to retract the muzzle back onto the deck before sailors could reload. Therefore, each barbette's size had to exceed barrel and carriage length; a gun position's diameter was at least over 5 meters—footprint much larger than breech-loaders.

"No problem. No matter how many issues muzzle-loaders have, they're still rifled. Besides, cannon modification is easy." Lin Shenhe said. "Right now if Dahlgren cannons work and are adequate, that's enough."

"I can understand the Planning Bureau constantly demanding savings, but they should still consider going all the way. We can't always be doing technical upgrades..."

Lin Shenhe chuckled softly: "Going all the way? Let me put it this way—if everyone hadn't been calling so loudly for explosive shells, rifled cannons, and cartridge rifles, the Planning Bureau would probably be preparing to conquer the world with 12-pounder smoothbores and Minié rifles."

"So frugal..."

"I can understand Wu De's thinking," Lin Shenhe said. "Everyone just wants satisfaction, not caring how to get it or what happens after—he's now conducting revolution through thrift."

"Hmm, didn't expect you to have such a big-picture view." Zhou Ke said.

"Not at all—where would I have a big-picture view? Just casually sharing thoughts."

Zhou Ke said: "Let's walk around the ship. Inspect the situation on-site." He picked up the telephone and cranked it twice: "Turn on the lights at the naval pier."

A few minutes later, all electric lights on the naval pier came on, brightly illuminated. Although light intensity still wasn't enough to illuminate every angle of the ship, at least one could roughly see objects' outlines without stumbling.

Under the lights, the hull surface showed irregular dark black—the result of unskilled painters applying tar paint. The hull was made from lychee wood imported from Guangdong, Vietnam, and other places—very sturdy. From the exterior, one couldn't tell the internal ribs and keel were iron—all covered by hull planking.

On deck, three masts stood tall. The 1630-class's three composite masts were shorter than its prototype's—the Navy couldn't train that many sailors skilled at climbing masts and handling sails on masts. So its rigging was simplified as much as possible, using steam auxiliary machinery to handle halyards.

Rigging was fully installed. White canvas was furled; jute halyards crisscrossed, each looking dark. Lin Shenhe inadvertently tried to touch one.

"Don't touch—they're covered in tar!" Zhou Ke quickly warned him.

Lin Shenhe started and quickly withdrew his hand. The deck was also coated with tar of the same color. Even so, beautiful patterns were visible under the lights.

"Made from imported Southeast Asian teak." Zhou Ke said. "Quite luxurious."

Lin Shenhe was unfazed—warship decks using teak was unremarkable in the past. Battleships and aircraft carriers of the 20th century still used this precious wood for decking.

The 1630-class had an island layout. The single smokestack was set in the island's center; the black smokestack was painted with yellow marker bands—the ship's only bright-colored markings.

Gun bases for the barbettes had already been installed at the positions designated for cannons, just waiting for rails, gun carriages, and barrels to be installed first thing the next morning.

Since the 1630-class was a sail-steam hybrid-powered warship, the three masts severely limited cannon firing arcs. The foremast and mainmast were right in front of the main guns' muzzles, preventing the two main guns from firing directly forward or aft—due to hull structure and center of gravity considerations, both main gun barbette positions were set on deck relatively near the ship's center. Therefore, 0-degree fire at bow and stern was provided by secondary guns on both beams. The only way for the 1630-class to deliver maximum firepower remained broadside salvos.

Lin Shenhe knew the cannon positions like the back of his hand: he had been a participant when discussing cannon layout. There had been heated arguments about the 854 and 901's cannon layouts. The finally decided 854 Modification scheme still referenced the layout of that model's blueprint, with slight modifications.

The ship's cannon layout was: one barbette each installed on the bow and stern deck centerlines, each mounting one 130mm caliber Dahlgren rifled cannon. On the bow, amidship, and stern sections, gun casemates were set on port and starboard, mounting 1 75mm caliber Dahlgren rifled cannon each—6 secondary guns total. Auxiliary weapons were 4 typewriters, set on the deck on both sides. Cannons used circular rail rotation, slide recoil, and manual traverse and elevation mechanisms.

According to black powder destructive power tests conducted by the Navy and Ordnance Department at the range, to effectively destroy contemporary galleon oak hulls while maintaining certain shore bombardment capability, shell charge should be around 2 kilograms of high-density pressed black powder. Combined with filling coefficient, fired explosive shells weighing 25-35 kilograms corresponded to calibers above 120mm, so they ultimately selected 130mm rifled cannons.

The barbettes themselves weren't designed with armor; only steel shields were used—on the entire 1630-class, only the magazine had a thin layer of steel plate protection. As for the boiler room, protection was provided by coal bunkers on both sides.

Normally, barbettes used foldable canvas awnings to shade from sun and rain, removed during combat.

"The 1630-class is still a bit small. Otherwise we could use fully enclosed turrets and install mechanized loading equipment." Zhou Ke said somewhat regretfully.

Lin Shenhe felt the same—the ship's small tonnage actually limited naval cannon size. With Lingao's current industrial capacity, manufacturing 200mm+ muzzle-loading rifled cannons wasn't difficult. Additionally, since 130mm cannon shells were the limit for manual loading, larger cannons required mechanically assisted loading systems—which also needed sufficient ship space.

He walked into the bridge. Most equipment inside was already installed. However, some advanced navigation equipment was still "under development"; only installation positions were reserved. The marine chronometer was still one brought from the old dimension. He noticed the 1630-class's bridge also had a dedicated fire control director tower. Climbing up, he found it empty inside—besides tables and chairs, there was no fire control equipment.

Zhou Ke explained: The original plan was to install artillery observation mirrors, rangefinders, calibrators, and mechanical ballistic computers.

"What—" Lin Shenhe was so surprised his mouth nearly couldn't close. He had thought they were just preparing some "fire control equipment" like telescopes and rangefinders. He hadn't expected "advanced equipment" like ballistic computers too—truly advancing by leaps and bounds.
