# Chapter 1192 - Preparations

"Then we can only destroy both the people and the ship at sea, leaving no trace—take away what can be dismantled and transported, and simply abandon the hull."

"But don't expect perfection. Killing everyone to silence them is easy enough, but can we guarantee every participating Navy and Marine soldier will keep their mouth shut? Besides, it's a pity to abandon a large galleon with considerable transport capacity." Ma Qianzhu turned to the finance department: "What impact would 230,000 pesos have on our finances?"

Cheng Dong flipped open a small notebook and answered: "This income would greatly increase our precious metal reserves. We currently need to import massive amounts of bulk commodities, especially grain. Industrial exports cannot yet fully offset our foreign trade deficit, so the more silver and precious metal income we obtain, the better for us. Especially with the future promotion of circulation notes, we inevitably need to mint large quantities of silver coins as reserves." He was extremely sensitive about the reserve issue.

Qian Shuiting said: "Consequently, I believe it doesn't matter if the Spanish find out. Given Spanish naval strength in East Asia, they simply cannot contend with us. Secondly, seizing the ship is equivalent to cutting off a major economic source for Zheng Zhilong. The Spanish in the Philippines rely heavily on trade with China—one could say that without Chinese goods and labor, they couldn't remain in the Philippines a single day. As long as we replace Zheng Zhilong's position and the Navy controls trade with the Philippines, the Governor-General will have no choice but to pinch his nose, swallow the loss, and continue trading with us. Incidentally, this operation was originally conceived as a one-off strike against Zheng Zhilong; in the long run, trade yields more profit than robbery."

"Too bad—I'd planned to rob them for ten years running," an Elder sighed.

"Those who establish and maintain world order reap the largest returns. One need only look at the United States in the old timeline to see that," Qian Shuiting replied.

As for the impact on combat and shipping, it wouldn't be too great. Starting in July, the Navy and merchant fleet would begin resting and reorganizing. Except for a few ships maintaining normal operations on scheduled routes, most shipping would halt completely. Both ships and sailors were plentiful.

Regarding the dispatched formation, Qian Shuiting's plan called for a mixed formation of two Type 901 gunboats plus the *Feiyun*. The 901's mobility and firepower were the keys to victory. The one-way journey alone covered a thousand nautical miles, and time was tight, making it impossible to use sailboats that required significant transit time. Additionally, search and pursuit at sea demanded high speed and maneuverability—things sailing ships couldn't achieve.

As for the *Feiyun*, it would primarily provide navigation and weather services for the formation. This was extremely important for a fleet penetrating the maze-like waterways of the Philippine archipelago. Secondly, the surface search radar aboard was significant for locating targets.

This capital wasn't excessively large for the Senate and Navy, but the potential loss of the *Feiyun*—a modern sailboat brought from the old timeline—would still be heartbreaking.

However, for absolute assurance, the *Feiyun*'s participation was indispensable—unless the Navy was willing to allocate a Type 854 cruiser to replace its role. But the diesel consumption would be unacceptable to the Planning Commission. At least the *Feiyun* could use sails half the time and engines the other half.

Chen Haiyang studied the map, pondered for a while, and said: "I suggest this route: the formation departs Hainan eastward, passes through the Balintang Channel, rounds Luzon Island to the south, proceeds straight to the eastern mouth of the San Bernardino Strait, and then begins the search. Such a route stays far from major merchant shipping lanes and is not easily detected. It also avoids hydrographically complex shallow waterways, making it safer. However, entering the Philippine archipelago in July brings a high probability of encountering typhoons. Our Navy has never conducted long-distance blue-water operations until now. Back then, our Navy leaving the First Island Chain once was major news."

"We found no typhoon records for July 1632. Besides, if there really is a typhoon, wouldn't those two ships also be stuck in Manila? Our ships are at least sturdier than theirs."

"I'm afraid typhoons can't really be verified by checking historical records. Typhoon generation is random." Someone expressed dissatisfaction with Qian Shuiting's remark.

"The *Feiyun* has weather radar, which can provide some early warning—in case of a typhoon, we can seek shelter in time. In the worst case, we can at least ensure human safety."

Discussion wasn't particularly heated afterward. Xiao Zishan noticed several heads of industrial and agricultural departments wanting to speak, but upon hearing that few ships would be deployed, they visibly relaxed and began whispering in small "soy sauce" groups. Not bad, not bad—this meeting actually stayed on topic the whole time, a genuine rarity.

"I say, Cheng Dong—if we aren't issuing paper currency now and keeping silver is temporarily useless, can you allocate it to us in the heavy industry sector?" Zhan Wuya had already set his sights on silver not yet in hand. "Anyway, keeping silver with you earns no interest and won't spawn little ingots. Making it into wires for us wouldn't be bad. We're consistently short of copper now; the Army and Navy are both competing for it."

The discussion immediately turned lively.

"That's worse than lending it to our Heaven and Earth Society for loans."

"Old Zhan, aren't you afraid I'll put up a sign 'No Copper in Wires, But There Is Silver,' guaranteeing your wires will be cut clean in one night? Hahaha."

"You bumpkins—don't you know the electromagnets at Oak Ridge in WWII used silver wires? The shipyard and forge should have electromagnets; that would be much more convenient. Who dares steal silver from a factory? Aren't they afraid of eating Minié balls?"

"How do you insulate?"

"Didn't the chemical sector produce raw lacquer?"

"They say silver stored in vaults loses one percent annually? Then we might as well take it out and use it first."

"After the Manhattan Project finished, the silver loss at Oak Ridge was less than one-thousandth."

"Bullshit—we in Lingao don't have those 'Silver Soldiers' who can stuff fifty-tael ingots in their stomachs and smuggle them out."

"You might as well say Los Alamos used gold spheres to block doors."

"That legend of Silver Soldiers belongs to unofficial history. From my understanding of the Ming Dynasty, this claim isn't necessarily true. Analysis of Household Department silver reserve records in core journals suggests a high probability of exaggeration."

Facing the suddenly derailed discussion, Qian Shuiting stood at the podium somewhat at a loss. Xiao Zishan hurriedly stood to smooth things over: "Alright, alright—these are matters for later; we can discuss them slowly. Ma Jia, do you think it's necessary to establish some regulations here first?"

"If we want the most reasonable and legal approach for this operation, it would be declaring war on the Spanish—after all, we are deploying regular armed forces. Since a state of war exists, capturing enemy vessels and confiscating goods and ships complies with the laws of war. As for whether captives have human rights—I tend to think such a concept didn't exist in the seventeenth century." Ma Jia spoke with fervor. "However, the procedures for declaring war are too cumbersome, and we can't send an envoy to Manila in time. So I think we can reference some historical privateering actions. Drake's maritime activities had elements of a joint-stock company. Referencing his example, I believe launching a privateering action against the Spanish Manila government is completely legal. After all, our Senate itself implies a joint-stock company. The Spanish once conducted hostile actions against Bopu Port, so our maritime retaliation is also legal..." He wanted to continue but was interrupted by Wen Desi. "Very good, very good. Go draft a relevant legal basis document."

"No problem. Give me three days, and I will definitely produce a logically clear, well-argued legal document. Fully embodying our respect for the law."

As for spoils distribution, following the old precedent of "Type A Ship Salvage," controlled materials would go to the Planning Commission's accounts, while non-controlled materials, daily necessities, and luxury goods would be sold to all Elders via bidding. Proceeds from selling spoils would be added to each Elder's dividend quota at year-end according to shareholding ratios.

The meeting concluded successfully with no objections. The matter was officially "project approved," and the operation was code-named "Hunger."

"I didn't expect you people to build such a thing." Qian Shuiting exclaimed in amazement at the "galleon" before him.

It was indeed a "ship"—hull, deck, masts, rigging... it possessed everything a thousand-ton galleon should have, and it was moored in the bay.

However, it couldn't move, because this galleon was actually just a full-scale model—officially called "Fixed Maritime Simulation Training Facility." It had been built on a row of wooden piles driven into the seabed. Rather than a ship, it was more like a wooden house.

Key parts of the hull like keel and ribs were replicated completely, but only "resembled in form"—ship materials weren't processed or manufactured according to real shipbuilding techniques. The purpose was merely to provide a visual demonstration for those using this model.

"Speaking of this idea, it came precisely from your proposal." Training Superintendent Fu Sansi led Qian Shuiting onto the "ship" deck. Except for lacking sails, the three tall masts were also constructed—but like all the materials used for this "ship," they were spliced together from inferior wood. If real sails were hoisted at sea, it would disintegrate immediately.

The proposal to construct this one-to-one European large ship training model had come from the Navy Department. Although Qian Shuiting's proposal hadn't passed for two consecutive years, the idea had inspired the Elder officers of the Navy Department: there would surely be many boarding battles aimed at capturing enemy ships in the future. General small and medium ships had simple structures, and the Navy had actual vessels for practice. But large ships like galleons or Dutch "yachts" with displacement over a thousand tons had three or four decks and extremely complex internal layouts. Unfamiliarity with internal structures could easily lead to losses in combat. This was something the Navy strived to avoid.
