# Chapter 921 – Optical Products

"Look—a 50mm aperture magnifying glass, f/4." Lin Hanlong took out the magnifying glass and handed it to Wu Nanhai. Wu Nanhai casually picked up a sheet of paper from the desk and examined it through the lens.

"Hmm, very well made. Very clear." Wu Nanhai clicked his tongue, then ran his hand along the handle. "If not for this wooden handle, I'd think it was one we brought with us."

"The finest magnifying glasses still tend to use natural materials. Wood is just one of many."

Wu Nanhai set down the magnifying glass and nodded. "Good—no problems at all. Our Agriculture Department can't get enough of these." He turned to call to a naturalized staff member. "Go get the picking slip. Let them handle the handover procedures."

"Very good. That settles our accounts."

"By the way, that refractometer I mentioned before—you said it was ready?" Wu Nanhai's voice grew serious. This was his real purpose for coming.

"Oh, that." Lin Hanlong opened a drawer with a casual air and produced a box. "I did make one. Take a look."

A refractometer was a rapid-testing optical instrument specifically designed to quickly measure the concentration or refractive index of sugar solutions and other non-sugar solutions. It played an important role in sugar production, food and beverage industries, and agricultural production. Besides measuring sugar content, it could also measure the concentration of products like soy sauce and tomato paste. In agriculture, it was used on fruits and sugar crops to determine optimal harvest time and to classify sweetness grades.

The principle was that when light passed from one medium to another, it refracted, and the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence was constant—this ratio was called the refractive index. The soluble solid content in fruit and vegetable juice was proportional to the refractive index at the same temperature and pressure. By measuring the juice's refractive index, one could determine its concentration.

The refractometer Wu Nanhai took out looked basically like a piece of sugarcane with one end cut at an angle. The pointed end was fitted with glass; the cylindrical end had several knobs. Wu Nanhai lifted the refractometer to his eye, aimed the pointed end at the light, and adjusted the knobs. He turned to Lin Hanlong. "Old Lin, excuse me—I need to test it."

Lin Hanlong nodded. "Of course."

Wu Nanhai turned. "Chuqing! Bring those bottles over."

The bottles contained plain water and sugar water mixed in various proportions. Wu Nanhai first dripped a few drops of plain water onto the glass and made an adjustment. Lin Hanlong handed him a piece of velvet cloth; Wu Nanhai took it and wiped off the water drops, then dripped on the sugar water. He squinted at the light for a moment, wiped off the sugar water, switched bottles, dripped on a few more drops, and observed again. After repeating this several times, he set down the refractometer and exhaled.

"Old Lin, you're really something! This is very well made—the sugar readings are very accurate." Wu Nanhai was all smiles now. "Excellent, excellent. I'll take as many of these as you can make. I'll have someone submit a report right away."

Lin Hanlong nodded. "Just sign the slip and stamp it with the Agriculture Committee seal later. You can take this sample now." He took a wooden box from the drawer and opened it, handing it to Wu Nanhai. "Here's the matching case."

"The lenses in here are mass-produced, no problem. But the prism is hand-ground. Mass production has to wait for the flat-surface grinder."

"Oh, how long will that take? I want to send a batch over before the next crushing season and train them in advance."

"You'll have to ask the Navy about that. They want the binoculars urgently—said they plan to put two on every ship."

"That's a lot! Cane sugar is a major revenue source for us; we can't neglect it!" Wu Nanhai was anxious. He was being pressured by Wen Tong—Wen Tong was promoting sugarcane production cooperatives in Leizhou, developing improved varieties. Quality-tiered pricing was a key component of Leizhou's sugar policy. Without refractometers, the regulations Wen Tong had drafted couldn't be implemented.

"Who's arguing otherwise?" Lin Hanlong agreed offhandedly, but made no concrete commitment.

Wu Nanhai caught on. "I'll put in a word with the Executive Committee. Optical instruments are too important—investment needs to be increased."

"With your backing, that's worth three others."

"Ha ha ha ha..." Wu Nanhai gave several dry laughs, then raised a finger. Chuqing quickly opened a straw bag she was carrying and produced a wooden box.

"These are new cigars from the farm. Try them."

"No need, no need—I still haven't finished the limited edition you gave me last time..." Lin Hanlong demurred politely.

"Try something new. These are the Li Quan Limited Edition." Wu Nanhai smiled. "Give them a try. The tobacco leaves were obtained through Jesuit connections from Macao—rolled with genuine Caribbean wrapper."

Lin Hanlong thought for a long moment before remembering who Li Quan was. He smiled and accepted the box. It was made of some fine wood, giving off a faint woody fragrance. According to Wu Nanhai, the wood was also imported from Southeast Asia. On the pale, polished lid were branded black characters—even some foreign script he didn't recognize. The box also bore a green tax-exempt sticker from the Finance Superintendent Department's Monopoly Bureau. It looked quite imposing.

By comparison, the previous limited edition had only been in a cardboard wrapper. Which was more high-end was obvious. Lin Hanlong noticed the Li Quan Limited Edition packaging indicated "3 per pack," and silently cursed Wu Nanhai for becoming ever more miserly.

"Not bad, not bad." He laughed along. Wu Nanhai then pulled two glass bottles from his pocket.

"This is blueberry fruit wine that Xue Ziliang grew and fermented at my place. Low alcohol content—drink it as a beverage. It's hot enough in here, anyway."

"This is too much—you keep bringing things..." Lin Hanlong felt a bit embarrassed. Over the past few months, Wu Nanhai had been sending over various items in dribs and drabs.

"Don't worry about it. You're busy here, working night shift every night—you need more nutrition." Wu Nanhai was unconcerned. "The farm exists to serve transmigrators, after all."

Still chatting, Wu Nanhai ambled toward the exit, holding the refractometer case. His naturalized subordinates filed out after him. Just as he was about to leave the workshop, his peripheral vision caught something. He turned, gave a startled exclamation, then shot toward a corner of the workshop.

"Old Lin!!!!"

Lin Hanlong hurried out, only to be met by the eerie green glow in Wu Nanhai's eyes. He groaned inwardly: "Oh no."

Fatty Wu's hand trembled as he pointed at a row of curved cast-iron workpieces, his voice quavering: "Mi... micro... microscopes... Why didn't you tell me?" He was pointing at a row of microscope stands, identical to those used in later eras.

Lin Hanlong smiled wryly. "You didn't ask if I could make them. These are ordered by the Health Department. Also urgently needed."

Fatty Wu leapt up. "I didn't ask because I assumed they were hard to make! Didn't people say they couldn't be mass-produced until the nineteenth century?"

"I used Leeuwenhoek's method—making non-spherical lenses using surface tension. It's actually pretty easy." Lin Hanlong spoke as if it were nothing. "Of course, I improved it a bit. We can produce several specifications now, with precision within one percent."

Wu Nanhai stared at Lin Hanlong for a moment, then let out a low chuckle. "Old Lin! When it comes to optics, you're the number one among all five hundred of us! You can do what no one else can!"

"Well, there are others—"

Wu Nanhai's hand landed heavily on Lin Hanlong's shoulder.

"Old Lin! You've made a huge contribution to our Agriculture Department! I, Wu Nanhai, understand that very well!" Fatty Wu thumped his chest. "Enough talk. From now on, the Agriculture Department will give full support to the Optical Plant. Something this important should be given priority for development. The Executive Committee—I'll handle it!"

The two laughed heartily for a while.

Wu Nanhai suddenly thought of something. "Old Lin, knowing your habits, you must have made a few prototypes before mass production, right?" As he spoke, his eyes were already glowing brightly enough to illuminate the entire workshop.

Apart from looking a bit crude, the homemade microscope Lin Hanlong produced looked at first glance no different from products of later eras. He pointed at the objective lens. "Three magnification levels: 50x, 150x, 300x. But the positioning mechanism isn't great—be careful when rotating it. You'll need to adjust a bit to keep the optical path aligned." He pointed at the eyepiece. "The eyepiece isn't painted—wipe it clean promptly after use, or sweat will corrode it."

Lin Hanlong found a cloth to wrap the microscope. "There's no case. You'll have to make do. This is a prototype with plenty of minor issues. Be careful when you use it; let me know if there are problems."

"Absolutely! Absolutely!" Wu Nanhai walked out, thoroughly satisfied, clutching the refractometer in his left hand and gripping the microscope tightly in his right.

After sending off Wu Nanhai—who looked like a Japanese officer leaving a raided village—Lin Hanlong had his apprentice bring another towel for him to wipe his face, then hurried to begin his second patrol of the workshop. The workers' skill levels were all low; even the experienced ones were only half-trained. Half-trained was the most dangerous—incidents kept happening, practically impossible to prevent.

By the time Lin Hanlong was halfway through inspecting the grinding-machine section, carefully listening to machine sounds, someone came to report that a Chief Qian was at the door looking for him.

This Chief Qian was solidly built, with well-defined muscles. He wore the standard transmigrator outfit—T-shirt, shorts, sunglasses—with a holster strapped to his thigh, the blocky grip of a pistol visible. Though it was standard attire, on closer inspection his outfit was quite different from others'. His sunglasses were the Top Gun Tom Cruise style; his solid-colored collared T-shirt somehow managed to look fitted; the shorts were obviously 5.11-type military gear; even his shoes weren't the ordinary sneakers you'd see around.

The visitor pushed up his sunglasses, revealing a pair of keen, bright eyes. It was Qian Shuiting—current Speaker and leader of the Otaku Faction.

"Old Qian! What wind blew you here?" Lin Hanlong greeted him with a laugh.

"I happened to be at the Machinery Factory for an inspection. Finished up and thought I'd come have a look. How about it—have you eaten?"

Lin Hanlong shook his head. "Where would I find the time? I'll have the cafeteria bring something over later."

Qian Shuiting produced a large box from the straw bag over his shoulder. "I brought some things—why don't we eat together?"

Inside the box, packed in ice, were two large food containers. Lin Hanlong peered inside. "Sushi! Where'd you get that?"

Inside were rice balls, rolled up with nori and the like, topped with red and white fish and other ingredients—the Japanese sushi known the world over in later times.

Lin Hanlong invited Qian Shuiting into his office. The desk was too cluttered to clear, so he had someone set up a folding table. A quick wipe and it became a dining table. The two sat facing each other. Lin Hanlong had his apprentice bring a few bottles of kvass—during working hours, proper drinking wasn't appropriate.

Qian Shuiting said that back when he was working in California, he'd worked at a Japanese restaurant and could make sushi no problem. Unfortunately, there wasn't proper sushi rice locally, so the texture was only passable. And there was no sushi vinegar, though Tianchu did produce white vinegar as a substitute. The *Feiyun* often went out fishing, and they had arrangements with several fishermen to supply good catches, so the seafood was fresh.

"Tianchu does have Japanese soy sauce—after all, everyone eats sashimi." Qian Shuiting opened a food container. "This is fresh wasabi I got from Wu Nanhai—ground it myself. Not wasabi paste."

"Speaking of Wu Nanhai, he just left." Lin Hanlong had always subscribed to the view that joy shared was doubled. He picked up the Li Quan Limited Edition cigars from the table. "How about it—want one later?"

"No, you keep them for yourself." Qian Shuiting said. "I'm holding myself to strict standards now."

At first, Lin Hanlong thought Qian Shuiting meant taking care of his health. Then he understood. "You mean you can't accept gifts from others?"

"Exactly."

"It's just a box of cigars..." Lin Hanlong was dismissive. This kind of private gift-giving to cultivate relationships—almost every transmigrator did it.

Qian Shuiting shook his head. "We're not short of circulation vouchers. Better to just buy things directly—saves having it become a scandal when the moment comes. Old Wu's a good man, but there are others who might—" Feeling the words were unwise, he stopped.

"You think this is America..." Lin Hanlong felt that ever since Old Qian organized the Otaku Faction and became Speaker, his conduct had become quite different from before—a bit paranoid, even. Politics really wasn't for ordinary people.

"Precisely because it's not America, we need to be careful. If this really were America, it would actually be simpler." Qian Shuiting poured him a cup of kvass. "Come on, have a drink first."

After a few pieces of sushi, Qian Shuiting studied Lin Hanlong. "Old Lin, I'm not trying to lecture you, but you've lost weight since last month."

"Hm? I hadn't noticed." Lin Hanlong had a good appetite. The weather was hot, and cold food like sushi suited him perfectly.

Qian Shuiting gestured with his chopsticks. "You're turning day and night upside down—working all night, then attending meetings in the morning, then handling business at the Machinery Factory. Noon is the hottest part of the day—how can you sleep well?" He picked up a piece of sushi and put it in Lin Hanlong's bowl. "This has flying fish roe—very good. Eat more. If you can't sleep well, can't eat well, and you're exhausted on top of that—of course you'll lose weight. Do you even want this body anymore?"

"It's the early stage of our enterprise. Some hardship is unavoidable."

"We're all in the early stage. You're working harder than most."

"Once the Optical Plant has its own power source in the fall, we won't need night shifts anymore. Things will get easier then."

"That's what I wanted to talk about. The Machinery Factory's sending out steam engines one after another—yet your Optical Plant is next door to them and still has to wait until fall?"

This touched Lin Hanlong's sore point.

"You know there are people on the Executive Committee saying optics can wait until the Second or Third Five-Year Plan to develop. What do you think?"

Lin Hanlong shook his head. "What do they know? I've got people lining up demanding this and that—I can barely keep up."

"Exactly! Everyone only looks at their own plot—who's really any wiser? It's only been a few years, and already they're not listening to what the frontline transmigrators say."

"There's no one on the Executive Committee who's ever done research—not even a research assistant. They have no firsthand feel for R&D."

"At this rate, they'll decide how we climb the tech tree? Isn't that the laymen leading the experts?"

Lin Hanlong waved his hand. "Never mind. Let's eat." He was genuinely hungry. A big box of sushi quickly went half-eaten. A bottle of kvass was nearly drained.

Qian Shuiting watched Lin Hanlong set down his bottle. "I think there needs to be a voice speaking up for the frontline technical transmigrators."

Lin Hanlong looked at Qian Shuiting without speaking.

"Take your Optical Plant, for example—many people think our stockpile is still plenty, no need to rush. In my view, no matter how much we brought, the range of products is limited, the quantity is finite."

Lin Hanlong nodded in agreement. "All sorts of people are asking me for all kinds of things—many I'd never even heard of before."

"Old Lin, you're run off your feet, working day and night—it's not easy for you to speak up. As Speaker, speaking is my job. I feel I should speak up for the broad mass of technical transmigrators." Qian Shuiting looked at Lin Hanlong sincerely.

"As for the importance of optics—I understand. But what exactly can we achieve at this stage? Can you give me the real picture?"

Lin Hanlong nodded again. "I appreciate your help." He was silent for a moment, gathering his thoughts.

"In terms of theory and design, optics was mature technology in our timeline." He pointed at himself. "I'm formally trained in optics; my work was optical work. Design and such—I can handle it. As for manufacturing processes—it's not especially difficult. Many hobbyists can grind their own lenses. I'm formally trained, so I won't do worse. Frankly, optical stuff is basically a kind of precision machining—just with smaller tolerances and relatively simple ways to make precise measurements." He paused, looking at Qian Shuiting. "I'll say this: given enough resources, in a few years I could reach pre-twentieth-century levels."

Qian Shuiting made a show of excitement. "Old Lin, you're that capable here! This is wonderful!"

Lin Hanlong nodded. "Seeing is believing. You said last time you wanted to see my workshop—do you have time now? I'm about to make my rounds."
