# Chapter 1148 - Zheng Zhilong's Ambition

The damage from the typhoon was soon tabulated. Although it looked messy, the actual loss wasn't huge. The main loss was some temporary structures and crops.

Wei Bachi breathed a sigh of relief. "Fortunately, we prepared early."

However, this typhoon also exposed drainage problems in Kaohsiung. Many low-lying areas had severe waterlogging.

"We must upgrade the drainage system!" Wei Bachi slammed the table at the summary meeting. "I don't want to see Kaohsiung become a water park next time a typhoon comes!"

Shi Dafu and Hong Laojun looked at each other with bitter smiles. "Mayor, labor and materials are tight..."

"Think of a way! Ask Lingao for support if needed!" Wei Bachi said unreasonably. "I only look at results!"

...

Meanwhile, Anping.

Zheng Zhilong sat in the study, listening to subordinates report on fleet losses.

"Five ships sank, over ten damaged..." Zheng Zhilong frowned. "The loss isn't small."

"Brother, the Australians in Kaohsiung seem to have suffered little loss," Zheng Zhifeng said cautiously. "Their houses are strong, and they have strange machines to help..."

Zheng Zhilong was silent for a moment. "These Australians truly have some skills."

He stood up and paced the room. "Li Siya's words... what do you think?"

"What she said makes sense," Zheng Zhifeng said. "Australian ambition is obvious. If we let them develop, sooner or later they will ride on our heads."

"But turning against them now..." Zheng Zhilong hesitated. "Their firearms and ships are powerful. We might not win."

"We don't need to fight them head-on," Zheng Zhifeng said sinisterly. "As Li Siya said, use the Dutch, use the natives... let them bleed first."

Zheng Zhilong nodded slowly. "Reasonable. Be smart about it. Don't let the Australians catch us red-handed."

"Understood."

"Also, strengthen ties with the Court," Zheng Zhilong instructed. "With the official hat, we have righteousness on our side."

Zheng Zhilong was a smart man. He knew that dealing with a powerful enemy like the Australians required using all available forces: pirates, merchants, the Court, foreigners...

He walked to the window, looking at the distant sea. "This sea belongs to the Zheng family. No one can take it away!"

In Kaohsiung, restoration work proceeded rapidly.

With the help of Westerly and others, the big clock on the Customs Clock Tower was finally installed.

"Ready to test!" Zhong Lishi shouted.

Workers removed the locking mechanism. The heavy pendulum began to swing slowly. *Tick-tock, tick-tock...* The steady sound of the mechanical movement echoed in the tower.

"It moves! It moves!" Westerly cheered quietly.

Zhong Lishi checked the time. "Accuracy needs adjustment. But running is a success."

He patted Westerly's head. "Thanks for your help, young man."

Westerly blushed. "I learned a lot, Dr. Zhong."

Huygens also came to watch. He listened to the rhythmic sound of the clock and praised, "A masterpiece. Truly a masterpiece."

"This will be the standard time for Kaohsiung," Zhong Lishi said proudly. "From now on, all activities in the port will follow its rhythm."

The completion of the clock tower became a symbol of Kaohsiung's restoration. The melodious bell tolling every hour told people that order had returned.

Wei Bachi stood on the balcony of City Hall, listening to the bell, feeling satisfied.

"This is civilization," he said to himself.

However, beneath the calm surface, undercurrents surged.

Xu Ke received a new report: Li Siya had left Anping and was coming towards Kaohsiung.

"She's coming again?" Xu Ke sneered. "This woman truly doesn't give up."

He ordered his subordinates: "Keep close watch. See who she contacts and what she does. Any suspicious behavior, arrest immediately!"

"Yes!"

Xu Ke knew a shadow war was beginning. On the bright side were construction and diplomacy; in the dark were espionage and conspiracy.

Zhong Xiaoying and Cleadia's friendship also deepened in their daily interaction. Cleadia began to try using chopsticks and learned some simple Chinese phrases. And Zhong Xiaoying learned a lot about Western customs from her.

"When I go back to Europe, I'll write letters to you," Cleadia said.

"Can letters reach here?" Zhong Xiaoying asked.

"Maybe... very slow," Cleadia said somewhat sadly. "But I will write."

"Me too."

The seeds of friendship were sown in the hearts of two girls from different worlds. They didn't know how the future current of times would impact their destinies, but this moment of purity was precious.
