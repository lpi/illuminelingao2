# Chapter 911 – Manga Books

Zhao Yingong smiled. "This is merely a secret plaything from Australia. Even among the Australians, it's quite rare. I had to spend considerable money and call in favors just to obtain one or two copies. I've kept them hidden away for a year or two now and have seen nothing uncanny about them—they're just ordinary picture albums."

Only then did the group relax. Appetite and desire are part of human nature. Once the fear subsided, only the allure remained. The two magazines passed from hand to hand; everyone found them hard to put down. Zhang Dai repeatedly considered asking the host to part with them—money was no object for him—but given Master Zhao's opulent lifestyle, he probably wouldn't care about a few taels.

After fondling them for a while, he reluctantly set the magazines down. Sun Chun kept pressing for details on how such lifelike images could be transferred onto paper. Zhao Yingong smiled:

"That, I don't know either. But the Australians once told me that the *Elementary Optics* Master Zongzi bought contains an explanation of the method—though described quite crudely."

"If this is a secret Australian technique, how could they write it plainly in a book?" said Zhang Dai. Then something occurred to him. "May I ask, Brother Zhao—do you have any telescopes here?"

"Telescopes?" Zhao Yingong was momentarily taken aback. Telescopes hadn't been developed in Lingao yet—the Planning Commission warehouse already had large stockpiles of them: all types and purposes. Nearly every transmigrator had one—domestic, Russian, East German, German—you name it.

Because of the existing inventory, the Science and Technology Department hadn't put telescope production on the agenda. It wasn't until the first Ship Preparation Plan was formally launched—when the Navy submitted its optical equipment requirements—that the Science and Technology Department added simple telescope manufacturing to the research schedule.

"The Australians aren't selling those. But I've heard Australian telescopes are quite excellent. I just haven't had the chance to see one."

"I see." Zhang Dai couldn't help but sigh. "A few days ago, Brother Mizhi lost his telescope on West Lake. I've seen how distraught he's been; I've been hoping to buy him a new one..."

"Wait—" Zhao Yingong interrupted. "This Brother Mizhi—could it be Fang Yizhi, Master Fang?"

"Indeed!" said Zhang Dai. "You know him?"

"Could his sobriquet be 'Foolish One of Longmian'?"

"Indeed."

Zhao Yingong burst out laughing. "So that's what happened! How remarkable."

He then recounted how, while boating on West Lake, he'd seen a dragon boat swimmer retrieve a telescope from the lake bottom. After finishing the story, he sent a servant to fetch the telescope.

Zhang Dai took one look and recognized it: the very Dutch telescope Fang Yizhi had always treasured—cleaned spotless and undamaged. Overjoyed, he made several deep bows. Zhao Yingong hastened to return the courtesy.

"Truly, the affairs of the world are beyond prediction," Zhang Dai said with a laugh. "Brother Zhao, you've chosen an auspicious name for your bookshop." He immediately declared that he would bring Fang Yizhi here soon.

"He's a man who loves writing and scholarship, with an intense interest in the study of natural principles. I see that the curios here far surpass anything those Western monks have. Brother Mizhi will certainly be delighted."

"Actually, the science of the telescope is also discussed in *Elementary Optics*. If one is interested, one could even make a telescope oneself."

Sun Chun chimed in from the side: "Is that so? When Mizhi sees both of these, he'll probably go mad with joy."

"I've long admired Brother Mizhi's reputation. If he comes, I'll be so eager to receive him I'll practically stumble over my own shoes."

This little interlude instantly strengthened the bond between them. Zhang Dai then asked if he could see a few more magazines.

"I have very few of these secret picture albums. But I do have some other Australian picture books that, while not quite so lifelike, are still worth a look."

"Oh? We'd be grateful to impose." The group's interest was immediately piqued.

Zhao Yingong smiled slightly. Of course, he couldn't sell these modern color-printed magazines. Apart from a few H-magazines purchased from someone's luggage to help open up the Guangzhou market years ago, the Grand Library's physical magazines consisted only of those salvaged from Lando's sunken ship. Never mind that magazines weren't productive capacity—such color printing was utterly beyond Lingao's current technical capability. They were a finite, irreplaceable resource, classified as Grade 2 controlled materials on the Planning Commission's manifests.

So Zhou Dongtian had long since developed products that could be reproduced with this timeline's technology. Zhao Yingong summoned his personal servant Jiying with a few instructions. Before long, Jiying brought out several book cases and arranged them on the long table by the window.

Zhao Yingong smiled. "Gentlemen, please take a look."

Zhang Dai and the others could barely contain their curiosity. They gathered around. The book cases were made of fine wood, left in natural color, with simple designs painted on the lids, and titles inscribed: *Prison Flower*, *Rihwa-Lo*, *Spring-Longing Woman*, and *Broad Records of Jests*.

From the cases themselves and the strange titles, nothing seemed unusual. With a cryptic smile at the corner of his lips, Zhao Yingong opened one case. The books inside opened to the left. The covers were simple. Zhang Dai picked one up and leafed through a few pages, then laughed. "What marvelous books! Vivid and alluring!"

Sun Chun was very curious and picked one up too. At first glance, it wasn't the vibrantly colored pages that seemed like living people; instead, it was black line drawings on white.

What was depicted were handsome men and beautiful women, exquisitely rendered. On closer inspection, he realized these were scenes of male-on-male passion, exquisitely drawn—even the masters Zhang Hou and Dao Mu would be put to shame.

Fondness for catamites was widespread among late-Ming literati; though Sun Chun didn't share the inclination, he wasn't offended. He merely felt the artistry was superb: the figures' movements, faces, and even the... acts themselves were rendered in minute detail, even the expressions were remarkably lifelike—far more accomplished than the usual *shunga* albums and "fire-prevention diagrams."

After leafing through a few pages, he realized this was no mere collection of erotic plates but a complete story, even though the characters and settings were entirely unfamiliar. He laughed. "Even in matters of Longyang, the Australians are peerless!"

Zhang Dai set down *Prison Flower*. He prided himself on being widely experienced, but he hadn't expected these hand-drawn line-art albums from Australia to have such powerful expressiveness—they practically made his blood race. Though some artistic techniques and character designs took getting used to, the quality was undeniable. Setting aside the exquisite, vivid figures and movements, the story itself was engaging.

The next one, *Spring-Longing Woman*, was a more conventional album of male-female pleasure. At a glance, the art style differed slightly from *Prison Flower* and *Rihwa-Lo*, but the richness of the plot, the beauty of the illustrations, and the variety of scenarios were no less impressive.

"Truly extraordinary!" said Sun Chun. Wen Huai, who usually styled himself a moralist, saw that the first few sets were all erotic albums. He picked up *Broad Records of Jests*—surely *that* wouldn't be erotic.

It wasn't erotic, but it was still a similar picture book. The figures were comically absurd. Wen Huai had never seen such a *Broad Records of Jests* before. After a few pages, he couldn't help bursting into laughter. "The truly remarkable book is right here!"

The group exchanged books for a while longer. In the end, all the sets were sold—at no small price, of course. Zhao Yingong's true purpose wasn't simply to sell books; it was to cultivate these scholars. He then had exquisitely prepared pastries and candies shipped from Lingao brought out. Everyone left in high spirits.

After seeing off Zhang Dai and Sun Chun's party, Zhao Yingong remained elated. He hadn't just connected with Zhang Dai—he'd also roped in Fang Yizhi in one stroke. The Restoration Society, a group with enormous influence across half of Jiangnan, had now opened a small door for him. This would be of great benefit to his future work.

Returning to the printing workshop in the back, he found Zhou Dongtian teaching apprentices the essentials of lithographic printing. These apprentices had been recently recruited from Nanjing; they had some background in drawing and woodblock carving, making them relatively easy to train. Zhou Dongtian wasn't worried about them learning the techniques and then jumping ship—so long as he controlled the coatings and inks used in lithographic printing, knowing the principles and techniques alone was useless.

The several books Zhao Yingong had just sold had been printed by Zhou Dongtian and his team using lithography. As for the source materials: apart from *Longyang Cave* and *Prison Flower*, which the Daoist had provided, the rest came from the Grand Library's electronic archives.

Lithographic printing had proven more difficult than expected, mainly in producing the base coatings, inks, and etching agents. It had taken a long time to find suitable formulations and substitutes.

There had been debates at the Grand Library over which manga to print. The Library's collection of H-manga was vast and varied, including many with extremely intense content. Because the seventeenth century was an era without the concept of human rights, most of those manga were ultimately rejected. Only the relatively wholesome, mildly erotic ones with normal H-content were selected.

The chosen manga source materials had been edited by transmigrators from the Grand Library to ensure there was no inappropriate content—the story settings were entirely fictional. Modern-style works could pass as Australian tales. Zhou Dongtian had originally planned to pirate Cai Zhizhong's entire series. But someone pointed out that manga touching on Confucian matters shouldn't be printed for now—works involving the *Analerta* and other Confucian classics might attract trouble from pedantic moralists. With Yin Gong operating abroad, less trouble was better than more; best not to sell them at all.

What Zhou Dongtian was now teaching his apprentices to draw was another Cai Zhizhong manga: *Zen Speaks*. He knew that once he left, the printing quality would likely decline, so he wanted to produce as many books as possible for Old Zhao while he was still here. He'd even considered whether to convert the manga to woodblock printing—after all, lithography had very limited print runs.

"Are you sure there's no problem with the *Condor Heroes* trilogy you sold to Zhang Dai?" Zhou Dongtian asked with a laugh when he saw him enter.

"The Grand Library's Truth Office reviewed it. Zhu Yuanzhang was changed to Chen Youliang, Chen Youliang to Fang Guozhen, and Chang Yuchun to Zhang Dingbian. That shouldn't run afoul of any taboos, surely?"

"There are still issues. The connection between the Ming Cult and the Ming dynasty—I suspect the Great Ming wouldn't be too happy to see that publicized."
