# Chapter 1191 - The Market

Watching everyone happily playing with the sharp weapons in their hands, Lü Zeyang secretly rejoiced: *You'll know how formidable these things are when you try to use them. Good to use, but you can't make the ammunition—these percussion caps were once sold by British smugglers to the Taiping Army for a tael of silver each.*

*Now it's the late Ming. The warlords aren't as rich as the Taiping Army, but selling twenty for a tael should still be possible,* Lü Zeyang thought.

After a round of hypocritical back-slapping and brotherly hugging, Lü Zeyang finally exited the city. Sun Yuanhua knew he was Master Lu's man and had rendered great service to Laizhou, so he specially invited him over to praise and encourage him, stating that as long as he had any power, he would certainly request merits for them. The two then discussed future specific contact protocols. Lü Zeyang also shared the general situation he had grasped with Sun Yuanhua, specifically mentioning that the rebels' future movements would likely shift toward Qixia and Pingdu. Sun Yuanhua expressed that he had similar expectations and had already memorialized the court to request diverted troops for interception.

Lü Zeyang was a bit disappointed. He had thought he possessed immense intelligence leads and prepared to do Sun Yuanhua a favor, but hadn't expected the man's intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities to be quite high as well.

Though his personal safety was still uncertain, Sun Yuanhua placed great importance on firearms, expressing hope that he would convey to Master Lu that it would be best to transport more Australian birdguns. Aside from Zhang Tao, the various armies coming to Shandong would all have needs. This was a business well worth doing.

Lü Zeyang agreed to everything. Early the next morning, Zhang Tao's troops took over the defense of the South Gate district. Lü Zeyang led his own troops in a majestic withdrawal. Upon leaving, the column swelled by five or six hundred people—all prisoners willing to follow them and local commoners. Fan Twelve, the tithing head of the South Gate district, also unhesitatingly brought his whole family pushing a small cart to follow along.

Lü Zeyang's troops passed through the rebel positions without incident. The rebel generals outside the South Gate district were already familiar with him, knowing this guy's subordinates were extremely tough to mess with. Besides, with Laizhou unable to be taken, perhaps in the blink of an eye they would have to become "government troops" again—maintaining good relations with this Regiment Commander Lü was never a mistake. So seeing them pass, everyone sent them off with smiles.

Lü Zeyang led the column leisurely toward Zhaoyuan. His team flew a large "Qimu" flag, which no one dared provoke in the three eastern prefectures.

Zhaoyuan and Longkou Bay were very close. Out of caution, the Northbound Detachment currently only occupied a part of Zhaoyuan's coastal area, building several fortified villages to form a mutually supporting posture with Qimu Island.

These so-called fortified villages were just large villages or towns surrounded by a trench and protected by a few simple bastions or even gun towers, defended by locally organized militia companies. In terms of combat power and defensive measures alone, they could only deal with bandits or stragglers. However, the rebels were wary of the "Qimu Island" banner and simply dared not mass large numbers of troops to attack—once such a thing happened, retaliation came swiftly and severely. After annihilating a group of rebels who attempted to make a move, no one dared launch hostile actions against these fortified villages flying the "Qimu" flag.

Zhaoyuan County was located in the western part of the Jiaodong Peninsula hills. The terrain was complex and broken, with hills and river valleys intermingled. The northeast was high and steep, composed mainly of granite and granitic gneiss; the ridges were serrated, majestic and precipitous, extending from northeast to southwest diagonally across the county. The hills were below 400 meters in elevation, with gentle undulations appearing as a wave-eroded plain of shallow hills and broad valleys. This place had never been a prosperous area. Aside from rich mineral resources, agricultural products were mainly fruits and coarse grains—the main production area of Longkou vermicelli was here, and vermicelli had always been a coarse grain product. Even into the 21st century, a county of over a thousand square kilometers had a population of only 560,000.

In this timeline, the population was even sparser; it was an impoverished and barren land. Consequently, rebel footprints rarely touched this place. The destruction here was thus relatively smaller. Zhu Mingxia and Lu Wenyuan deciding to occupy Zhaoyuan also had considerations in this regard—Qimu Island was too small as a base, only good for transshipping refugees. Expanding territory outside the island easily made their target profile too large. Qimu Island was only a few dozen li from Huangxian, and very close by sea to the heavy coastal defense town of Dengzhou. Maintaining a powerful base here would easily attract attention. Better to stay securely in the hilly region of Zhaoyuan—and Zhaoyuan had gold. Of course, this development was a story for later.

The place Lü Zeyang was heading to was the Xinzhuang area of Zhaoyuan, backing onto the Bohai Bay and echoing Qimu Island across the water. The Northbound Detachment's main fortified village in Zhaoyuan was built at Xinzhuang. With this main fort as the core, seven or eight branch fortified villages radiated out, controlling several dozen square kilometers of land.

The administrators and militia commanders of these fortified villages were soldiers of the Northbound Detachment. Zhu Mingxia felt the regular armed forces sent to Zhaoyuan were diluted too thinly. Although Zhaoyuan had over a thousand militia on the books, in a sudden emergency these militia wouldn't be much use, requiring troop transfers from Longkou for reinforcement. So he transferred Lü Zeyang's unit to Zhaoyuan—conveniently also having an Elder to preside there.

This place was now the Northbound Detachment's reservoir. Any refugees who couldn't be evacuated in time during the summer break would be sent to the Zhaoyuan area to be "stockpiled." Since most shipping had stopped, currently only a few Special Recon transport boats shuttled between Shandong and Jeju Island, transporting refugees on a small scale. These boats all had sufficient armament to protect their own safety.

"Wonder if Zhaoyuan vermicelli tastes good," Elder Lü rode on his horse, pondering this question.

Huang Ande took Zhu Si and Cao Qing outside Huangxian city. Huang Ande and his band of brothers inside the city had hidden for a while after the fall of Dengzhou before slipping out during the chaos. After staying on Qimu Island for half a month, they were incorporated into the reconnaissance team.

Huang Ande had not only earned a military service medal, which meant he was one step closer to the rank of lieutenant.

Initially, being in the reconnaissance team was a job with one's head tucked in one's waistband. Foot reconnaissance was extremely dangerous—the rebels were almost all mobile cavalry. Once discovered, death was certain—rebels would directly kill any suspicious men they saw. Mounted reconnaissance was less risky; their weapons were good and horses well-fed. But in such a cat-and-mouse game, scout casualties were not small. One of Huang Ande's brothers had died in a reconnaissance operation—killed before he could see the beautiful scenery of Lingao that Huang Ande had boasted about.

As the situation developed and a tacit "non-aggression" understanding was established between the rebels and Lu Wenyuan, scout operations slowly became less dangerous.

However, today they weren't performing a reconnaissance mission. They were here to do business. They all wore armbands as safety passage markers. Huangxian was now effectively the rebels' main base headquarters. Small groups of rebel activity were everywhere on the roads; without this agreed-upon armband, one risked being killed or captured on the road.

"Doing business" meant obtaining population through trade with the rebels. Rebels often looted entire villages and stockades of men, women, old, and young. Besides some able-bodied men used as cannon fodder, women and children were often reduced to commodities bought and sold among rebel soldiers and officers. Similar human markets existed not only in Huangxian but also beneath the walls of Dengzhou and Laizhou.

A "market" of considerable scale had already formed a few li outside Huangxian city.

This had originally been a large stockade, a rather bustling and prosperous place. Since being breached by rebels, only many broken walls and ruins remained. Because the stockade had a moat outside, the rebels used it as a human pen. Looted commoners were sent directly here for confinement, waiting to be sold.

Several thousand commoners were stuffed into these ruins without a single roof tile overhead. There was a well in the stockade, so drinking water was manageable. But food depended entirely on the guards' mood and the abundance of their own supplies. In good times, they might throw in some black hard buns made of unknown ingredients; in bad times, not a bite to eat would be given for days.

The lucky ones might be bought after ten days or half a month for someone's pleasure or assigned to cannon fodder squads. The unlucky ones could only slowly suffer in this living hell.

Thousands crowded together, exposed to sun and rain, with irregular eating and drinking—epidemics soon became rampant. Especially after the third lunar month passed, hundreds of corpses were dragged out daily. But the rebels didn't care, because fresh refugees were continuously sent in from everywhere—there was never a worry about supply shortage. some soldiers and officers would tire of women they bought, send them back here to sell, and buy fresh "goods."

Besides population, there was massive wealth plundered during looting. Though countless riches were gained, soldiers moving everywhere couldn't carry heavy goods and wanted to exchange them for gold, silver, jewelry, and other portable valuables. Massive amounts of wealth were sold here at prices low enough to make one's hair stand on end.

It was precisely discovering such "markets" in Huangxian, Laizhou, and elsewhere that gave Lu Wenyuan the idea of doing business with the rebels.

And Kong Youde also discovered Lu Wenyuan's intense interest in population. The rebels suffered from grain difficulties and urgently needed replenishment. This Master Lu seemed abundant in grain—since he couldn't rob him, doing business with him was a suitable choice. Thus he specially sent someone to propose: population for grain. The two sides hit it off immediately and reached a verbal agreement on the spot.

According to this agreement, Lu Wenyuan sent several "household retainers" to Huangxian weekly to "inspect goods." Adult men and women were priced at 5,000 grams of grain, young children at 2,500 grams, the elderly at 1,000 grams. This "grain" could be any unhusked grain or dried potato slices, or "paper-wrapped grain bricks." If Master Lu chose to pay with "potatoes," the price doubled—after all, potatoes were fresh goods with a water content issue.

The terms were harsh, but for Kong Youde this was the paramount matter of solving the eating problem. An army without grain was unstable; without grain, nothing could be done. If captured refugees could be exchanged for grain, it was equivalent to opening a new food source.
