# Chapter 1066 - Seizing the Treasure in the Perilous City

The "safe house" at the rendezvous point was an ordinary shop. The owner's entire family had reportedly been dragged out of the city and killed by local Liaodong people a few days ago for "exploiting the Liaodongese," and their belongings had been looted clean. Empty shops and residences like this were everywhere on the street; the better ones were occupied by rebel soldiers. Since this street was relatively deserted, Huang Ande had chosen this place as the safe house to receive the Special Reconnaissance Team.

This was also Huang Ande's first time seeing the "Senate's Sword"—the Special Reconnaissance Team—in a combat state. This Praetorian Guard of the Senate rarely appeared in public. Except during joint exercises or occasionally passing through the entrances of Bairen City, almost no one was aware of their existence.

He looked at their peculiar attire and various unrecognizable equipment with great astonishment—even the guns they carried were different from his own, and even different from the guns used by the Senators during target practice.

Naturalized citizen cadres who had the most contact with Senators often commented in private chats: The Special Reconnaissance Team members and the confidential secretaries looked the most like the Chiefs.

"Finally, you're here..." Huang Ande looked at the street with trepidation. "Come, come inside." He glanced around and realized there were only seven or eight people, and couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed: "Only this many?"

The leader didn't answer. With a wave of his hand, several team members rapidly stormed into the house to search, moving as fast as phantoms. Huang Ande and Zhu Si were dumbfounded, and before they could understand what was happening, they were ushered into the house.

The team members guarded the doors and windows. Only then did the leader speak in a low voice: "Tell us the situation." As he spoke, he took out a pocket map from his chest pouch and turned on a shielded flashlight.

"Yes... yes..." Huang Ande wasn't a coward—if he were, he wouldn't have lurked in the city and organized a team prepared for big action. But seeing how fierce these people were, half-human and half-ghost, his legs couldn't help but tremble: Killing a person for them would probably be as easy as blowing out a breath, wouldn't it?

Zhu Si, on the other hand, had completely lost the ability to react. Everything before his eyes was too far beyond his comprehension. It wasn't until the moment the shielded flashlight was turned on that he recovered, curiously wanting to lean in to see this "glowing cylinder," but he didn't dare.

"Lord Sun Yuanhua... is right here in the Circuit Supervisor's Yamen," Huang Ande pointed carefully to the location on the map board—he could read maps, not to mention that the large-scale map of Dengzhou City had been drawn largely thanks to his contributions.

He steadied his nerves and first explained the route he had planned. The leader didn't speak, just listened attentively.

Huang Ande reported that as of nightfall yesterday, the security and guard situation at the Circuit Supervisor's Yamen had not changed; it was still the same as his last report.

Sun Yuanhua was detained alone in the main courtyard behind the yamen—probably because of his high rank, and also because Kong Youde and others intended to treat him well. After his capture, not only was his living treatment generous, but Kong Youde, Li Jiucheng, and others had also visited him and spoken with him.

After a simple intelligence exchange, the assault team, led by Huang Ande and Zhu Si, split into two groups and headed straight for the rear courtyard of the Circuit Supervisor's Yamen.

The main gate of the Circuit Supervisor's Yamen was on the main street and was relatively open, so the assault team chose to breach from the rear gate.

By the standards of the Special Reconnaissance Team, the guards at the Circuit Supervisor's Yamen were not strict. According to the reconnaissance by Sun Yuan and others, there were no roving sentries or hidden sentries inside or outside the yamen, only open sentries.

More than fifty rebel soldiers were stationed inside the yamen, guarding it day and night. In addition, there was a local gentry's residence not far from the yamen, which was now also garrisoned by quite a few rebel troops. Coupled with the fact that all the city gates of Dengzhou were now tightly closed, by 17th-century standards, it would have been impossible for Sun Yuanhua to escape even if he had wings.

The pitch-black streets were deserted—except for the occasional passing night watchman, there wasn't a soul. The curfew actually facilitated their night operations. The night watchmen carried lanterns while beating their gongs, making them easy to avoid.

At 0233 hours, the assault team arrived at the narrow alley behind the Circuit Supervisor's Yamen. According to intelligence, two rebels were stationed in the "storage room" of the alley, so the team members first neutralized these two. Subsequently, three team members worked together to hoist one member up to the rear courtyard wall.

He raised his infrared binoculars to observe the situation inside the courtyard. Unexpectedly, there was almost no security to speak of in the rear courtyard. According to Huang Ande's intelligence, there was a subcommandant leading ten soldiers guarding the rear courtyard, but at this moment, the courtyard was quiet with not a soul in sight.

These guards were almost all asleep; only two soldiers and an old man guarding the back door were still awake. In the freezing weather, the three of them were hiding in the gatehouse playing leaf cards by the stove to pass the time. Probably to facilitate observation of movement in the courtyard, the windows and door were open.

According to the plan, four assault team members quietly crossed the courtyard wall. They crept up to the window and main door of the gatehouse and took out the hand crossbows from their leg pouches.

The leading sergeant raised a hand and extended three fingers. Three hand crossbows were raised simultaneously.

After a silent countdown from three to one, the three hand crossbows emitted a slight twang at the same time. The three people playing cards in the room fell down together, their bodies twitching a few times before becoming motionless.

The crossbow bolts were coated with a neurotoxin extracted from plants and animals by the biology lab. It acted extremely fast, stopping a person's breathing within seconds.

Two team members quickly opened the back door and let the others in. Huang Ande and Zhu Si followed them in. He watched as two team members crept into the wing room where the guard soldiers were staying. A moment later, they came out and made a gesture. The leading sergeant made a hand signal, and the group continued to advance. Huang Ande felt a chill in his heart, knowing that those ten or so unlucky fellows had most likely lost their lives.

Once inside the rear courtyard, movement became much more convenient. Passing through the courtyards layer by layer would require repeated searching and neutralization, taking too much time and increasing the chance of discovery. Leaving two team members to control the rear, the team took the service lane that ran through all the front and rear courtyards of the yamen to break directly into the main courtyard.

The door to the service lane was locked, but this kind of padlock had basically no defensive capability. It was easily snapped open with bolt cutters. The entire team moved quickly and silently through the pitch-black service lane. The leader, wearing two small cylinders over his eyes, periodically reminded everyone to bypass obstacles in the lane.

Following the team members' instructions, Huang Ande stared tightly at the back of the person in front of him: in the pitch darkness, there was actually a yellow light on his back like a ghost fire, which made his scalp tingle. But at this moment, he had no choice but to follow without falling a step behind.

In the darkness, the team leader quickly found the side door leading to the main courtyard according to the map. He quietly observed through the crack in the door. The courtyard was empty, and there were no lights in either the main house or the wing rooms; evidently, everyone had gone to sleep.

The assault team members quietly cut the padlock. Huang Ande carefully entered the courtyard. According to the agreement, he mimicked the call of a night owl three times. A figure immediately flashed out from under the porch; it was Sun Yuan.

"I've been waiting for you." Seeing Huang Ande suddenly appear, Sun Yuan finally relaxed.

"Let's talk in the service lane!" Huang Ande said quickly.

Sun Yuan glanced around and saw several phantom-like figures in the service lane. Although he knew they were people brought by Huang Ande, he was still very scared in his heart. He couldn't help but take a step toward the door before whispering:

"Only Lord Sun is confined in this courtyard," Sun Yuan said. "The east wing room houses me and Lord Sun's two original servants. The west wing room houses the people sent by Kong Youde to monitor us..."

"How many people?"

"Ten."

"Where are the sentries?"

"There are two people guarding over by the courtyard gate—one shift every two hours." Sun Yuan whispered. "Look carefully, they are right on the corridor by the main courtyard gate."

"No other guards?"

Sun Yuan was stunned. "Who could run away? Everything is locked everywhere—plus there are the city walls."

"good. In a moment, take us to Lord Sun's bedroom." Huang Ande said, looking back at the leading sergeant. The sergeant just nodded—Huang Ande noticed that from start to finish, they almost never spoke, communicating only with gestures and eye contact.

Two team members entered the courtyard in a low posture, their hand crossbows pointed down, activating the simple laser target designators taped to them.

This was experimental equipment. Although it looked very "shanzhai" (knockoff/jury-rigged), it had achieved good results in several simulated drills under dark conditions, whether equipped on firearms or crossbow mechanisms—this was its first use in actual combat.

Since the red light of the laser pointer was visible, both team members hid in the dark, waiting for the two soldiers on night watch to turn their backs.

When the two night watchmen turned around again, exposing their backs, the two team members raised their hand crossbows together. Almost simultaneously, the two guards fell.

Several team members immediately slipped into the courtyard with agile movements and crept toward the wing rooms.

"Brother Huang!" Sun Yuan said quickly. "The two kids living with me are good people; I'm friends with them. Don't kill them..."

"We won't kill them, but they have to come with us. You too." Huang Ande said. "Otherwise, come dawn, you'll all be dead."

At dawn, if Sun Yuanhua was missing, everyone in the yamen would be suspected. Sun Yuan and these old servants would be major suspects; if not tortured to death, they would be killed to vent anger.

Sun Yuan nodded repeatedly: "Alright, I'll go!"

"Go wake them up, then take us to Lord Sun's bedroom, hurry!"

"Okay, I'm going right now!"

Ten minutes later, under the supervision of two team members, Sun Yuan and the two young servants carried Sun Yuanhua out of the bedroom—to prevent him from refusing to leave or committing suicide, the assault team members had administered a sedative immediately upon entering.

"Don't just stand there, pack up!" the sergeant whispered. "Sweep and check!"

All team members immediately checked their personal equipment and recovered gear, including the fired crossbow bolts.

"Salamander reports: Mission accomplished!" the sergeant reported via radio. "Preparing to withdraw. Over."

The group quickly carried Sun Yuanhua, returned to the rear courtyard from the service lane to rendezvous with the gate-guarding team, and rapidly retreated to the safe house at the first rendezvous point.
