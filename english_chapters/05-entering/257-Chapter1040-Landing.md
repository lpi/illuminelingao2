# Chapter 1040: Landing

The *Fubo*, with the smallest displacement, left the formation and sailed alone at the very front. Because it used diesel engine power, had low engine noise, high mobility, and no continuously spewing thick smoke, it was designated as the avisos (dispatch boat) of the Second Fleet, executing missions of reconnaissance, infiltration transport, and surprise attacks.

Following the chart drawn by *Haitian*, *Fubo* carefully dropped buoys while sailing, guiding subsequent ships into Seongsan Bay.

Standing on the deck of *Fubo* was Special Reconnaissance Detachment Squad Leader Xue Ziliang—almost all squads under the Special Reconnaissance Detachment Command had been dispatched. Apart from the direct squad commanded by Bei Wei himself, only Xue Ziliang's squad hadn't been sent out.

Xue Ziliang had long served as an instructor in the Special Reconnaissance Detachment, so his squad was actually a training squad. However, the combat environment on Jeju Island was relatively simple—everyone in the Senate held extreme contempt for the combat effectiveness of the Joseon army, refusing to even award the title of "Combat Power 5"—so it was just right for the training squad to practice.

For Xue Ziliang, it didn't matter if the opponent was Combat Power 5 or Combat Power 1. having been cooped up on Hainan Island for a long time, leading the team running around the island all day, climbing mountains, crossing ridges, and swimming across the sea, he was bored out of his mind. Having a chance to go on a business trip was certainly not to be missed, so he immediately selected the twenty best-performing members from the training squad to form the Jeju Island Special Task Squad.

*Fubo* lowered its sails and used the diesel engine to approach Seongsan slowly. Xue Ziliang had been to South Korea when he was an American soldier, so he had naturally visited Jeju Island.

The Seongsan before his eyes was almost exactly the same as in his memory, only more desolate and quiet. The beautiful beach south of Seongsan was devoid of human traces; only occasionally could a few small fishing boats be seen sunbathing bottom-up.

No hotels, no resorts, and even less sight of hot beauties in bikinis—although Xue Ziliang felt at the time that those beauties looked really un-Asian. But now he missed them very much.

Although he had managed to get Salina—attracting all kinds of envy, jealousy, and hate, especially Xiao Bailang who declared every time he got drunk at the farm cafe that he would "shoot Winnie Xue and take back the big foreign mare"—he had no share of maid subsidies. He naturally had the subsidy, but out of consideration for Salina's feelings, he painfully gave up the opportunity.

"Damn, a tree or a forest, that is the question!" He muttered to himself on the deck. Thinking of the recent rumors in the Nanhai Cafe that many girls had been brought from Shandong, he couldn't help but have lively thoughts in his heart.

"They said there would be a local Ziming Tower in Lingao; why isn't it open yet!"

While he was letting his imagination run wild, he suddenly heard the lookout shouting: "15 degrees starboard ahead, distance 380 meters, active targets!"

Xue Ziliang hurriedly raised his telescope, suddenly beaming, and quickly adjusted the focus.

In the telescope lens was a group of bare-bottomed young women.

No, strictly speaking, they weren't truly bare-bottomed, but wearing loincloths similar to T-back thongs. Although the cold wind on the sea was biting, these women only wrapped their heads in cloth towels and draped straw-woven things like cloaks over their bodies, running barefoot among the reefs, carrying rattan baskets in their hands, moving as agilely as antelopes.

"Catch them alive!" Xue Ziliang roared unconsciously, drawing suppressed snickers from several squad soldiers behind him.

"Laugh my ass, I bet you bunch of virgins are seeing bare-bottomed women for the first time!" Xue Ziliang scolded.

"Reporting to the Squad Leader! We can't see..." the scolded soldier said.

Xue Ziliang roared, "All prepare to land!"

*Fubo* approached the beach, then lowered two speedboats: these were neither rowboats nor heavy large/medium/small motorized boats with steam engines, but fiberglass motorboats with outboard motors, specially equipped for the Special Reconnaissance Detachment.

Xue Ziliang was the first to jump into a motorboat. Before the last soldier who fell to the bottom of the boat could stand up, the two motorboats rushed straight to the beach like arrows leaving the string.

Xue Ziliang's eagerness to go ashore was of course to capture a few women, but his starting point was not seeking novelty. Capturing prisoners was the most common means for reconnaissance squads to obtain intelligence. He guessed these nearly naked women should be "Haenyeo" (sea women) harvesting seafood in this area—he had seen their performances at the same location when traveling in South Korea back then, and he had even tasted fresh abalone harvested by Haenyeo.

Although the motorboats were fast enough and the squad lads were strictly trained, the distance was too far after all. By the time the Special Reconnaissance Detachment landed on the beach, the Haenyeo had already run nearly five or six hundred meters away; even running all out, they couldn't catch up.

"Sergeant! Take a few men and track them in the direction they fled—they should be from a nearby fishing village. Maintain contact, do not fire at will." He ordered the sergeant beside him.

"Understood!" The sergeant saluted, turned around, and picked four soldiers to track them together.

"Others spread out, search the vicinity!"

According to Xue Ziliang's experience, in this sudden situation, some people would choose to run, and some would choose to hide on the spot, especially since there were many small woods and rocks on this side of the beach, giving a feeling of "being able to hide"; someone must be hiding.

Sure enough, it didn't take long for soldiers to capture five or six semi-naked Haenyeo. They cringed, some draped in straw cloaks and some simply naked, walking over barefoot.

The escorting soldiers were all young lads. Although Lingao didn't have a culture of strict separation between men and women, and female naturalized citizens under the Senate's rule mostly wore skirts and short-sleeved clothes in summer, they had never seen such nearly naked women. Although the Haenyeo varied in age, naked thighs, breasts, and buttocks swaying before their eyes made several soldiers blush, lower their heads, and not dare to look at the Haenyeo.

Xue Ziliang glanced at them and said dissatisfiedly: "What the hell are you shy about! Open your eyes wide and watch the prisoners! I'll ask how many hairs the prisoners have later! No dinner for those who can't answer!"

Although the soldiers tried hard to look serious one by one, their appearances were struggling not to laugh.

"Take them all aside and detain them." Xue Ziliang had no time to interrogate them now; besides, he didn't understand Korean. A Senator who understood Korean was specially equipped for this operation as a translator, but he was still on the flagship.

"Call Admiral Li Haiping on *Zhenyang* immediately!"

The soldier carrying a 2-watt radio nearby hurriedly started calling, and soon got through to *Zhenyang*. Xue Ziliang took the handset and said loudly:

"This is Xue Ziliang at the radio. Over."

"This is Li Haiping at the radio. Over." The static crackling came from the headset, but Li Haiping's voice was very clear.

"I have landed on Seongsan Beach, encountered no resistance. Will proceed to the beacon tower shortly. Current bearing 1167. I will fire a signal flare in five minutes. Marking landing beach with three bonfires of white smoke. Over."

"Copy. Over."

"Communication out." He said, putting down the headset and ordering the soldiers to execute their predetermined tasks.

The soldiers dispersed and set up three bonfires on the beach. A soldier scattered special chemicals on the fires, producing white smoke—to distinguish from the black smoke of the beacon tower here.

According to *Haitian*'s intelligence: there was a Joseon beacon tower next to the landing zone—the Seongsan Bathing Beach in the old timeline. Where there was a beacon tower, there must be garrison soldiers. Useful information could be obtained from soldiers' mouths, so his first task was to capture the beacon tower and take prisoners.

The beacon tower was very conspicuous—visible from the beach without searching. Xue Ziliang didn't go personally but sent a small squad. Half an hour later, the small squad brought back five Joseon soldiers. And reported that observation posts had been stationed on the beacon tower.

The Second Fleet sailed into Seongsan Bay, steam engines roaring and black smoke spewing. From the H800s that dropped anchor in the Seongsan anchorage, the small motorized boats carried on board began to be hoisted down. Four small motorized boats were equipped with "typewriters" (machine guns), serving as patrol boats for the bay, while moonlighting as tugboats.

The combat engineer company was the first to climb down rope nets from the transport ship onto small boats. Wooden pier components bundled on pallets with float drums were hoisted down from the Harmony Wheels and placed directly on the sea surface. Engineers wearing life jackets quickly tied towlines to the pallets, which were towed to the shore by small motorized boats and assembled by engineers.

A specially modified flat-bottomed barge was unloaded from the deck of a Harmony Wheel: it was equipped with a small steam engine and boiler set to drive a pile driver.

Large barrels of pure water for boilers and coal were unloaded from the collier *Haifeng*. Engineers busied themselves on the engineering barge, adding water and coal. Before long, thick black smoke rose from the boiler chimney on the engineering barge, going straight into the clouds. However, it would take a few hours for the steam engine to operate. Laborers from the direct squadron of the Jeju Agricultural Reclamation Regiment headquarters began climbing down the rope nets of the H800s in batches—each carrying a luggage bag, wearing a rattan safety helmet, with a machete at their waist. The future Jeju Island Agricultural Reclamation Regiment would be built with them as the core.

Around noon, the first batch of dispatched Special Reconnaissance Detachment scouts returned. They marked several villages on the map. One was less than two kilometers from the landing beach—right at the foot of Seongsan. Xue Ziliang looked; it was roughly the location of the Seongsan Folk Village in the old timeline. The scouts reported it was a fishing village; the Haenyeo who fled just now were from this village.

"The commoners in the village have all fled; we didn't chase," the scout reported. "We searched the village; no suspicious places."

The commoners fled in a hurry; even the fires in the stoves were not extinguished. The scout reported the village was very poor; apart from a small amount of seafood catch, almost no grain or valuables could be found, nor livestock.

"Very good." Xue Ziliang expressed satisfaction. "Rest a bit; there are new missions tomorrow."
