# Chapter 860 - Finding a New Path

The second technical support team bound for Jiangnan was formally assembled. The machinery factory manufactured four Albion-type printing presses and two lithographic presses, along with one small water wheel. Local craftsmen could produce water wheels to contemporary standards, but their efficiency fell far short of the machinery factory's machine-built versions, whose superior transmission and gearing systems were simply beyond what hand-made construction could achieve.

All equipment was disassembled and packed into crates for shipping. The shipment also included assembly tools for installation, easily-damaged spare parts, and lithographic printing supplies: stone plates, engraving pens, etching agents, and protective coatings. Originally, Mo Xiao'an had proposed establishing a paper mill in Hangzhou. Such mills required simple equipment and straightforward processes. The Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou plain offered abundant rice straw, while the mountain counties provided bamboo and wood resources—raw materials sufficient for papermaking.

Such an operation could not only supply the printing office but also sell locally. Hangzhou at that time was already an important paper distribution center; high-quality paper would find no shortage of buyers. Papermaking was also not an excessively lucrative industry, attracting little attention from wealthy gentry. According to Zhao Yingong's observations, most paper workshops were small family handicraft operations, scattered through the mountainous counties around Hangzhou such as Yuhang, Lin'an, and Liuxia. Their paper was then transported to Hangzhou for sale by merchants. This group posed no threat to Zhao Yingong's enterprises.

However, modern papermaking required large quantities of acids and alkalis. Lingao could not supply chemicals over such distances, so Mo Xiao'an's proposal was temporarily shelved.

The Jiangnan inspection team consisted of four elders, including Zhou Dongtian. When word spread that there was an opportunity to visit Jiangnan, many scrambled to join—a low-risk business trip to the legendary "dreamland" of Ming Dynasty Jiangnan? Everyone had heard of the Eight Beauties of Qinhuai; those who had read even a bit of classical literature knew of the Yangzhou lean horses. When Mei Lin learned of the inspection team, he immediately sought out Mei Wan, pleading tearfully to be included. His reasoning was actually quite sound: since Zhao Yingong was planning to build an estate, how could the construction company not be involved? If buildings were constructed according to local craftsman methods, the project would inevitably waste land area, building space, and construction materials.

"My back is fine, my back is fine," Mei Lin insisted. "If I go, I'll definitely turn Phoenix Villa into an impregnable fortress..."

Mei Wan, pestered beyond endurance, could only caution him: "I should warn you—we're definitely going to Hangzhou this time. Whether we'll go to Nanjing is uncertain."

Mei Lin's yearning for the Eight Beauties of Qinhuai was well known throughout the Elder Council—he hadn't even taken a life secretary because of those legendary beauties. He was regarded as somewhat eccentric. His current enthusiasm for Jiangnan clearly had ulterior motives.

"No problem, no problem. Hangzhou is fine too. Suzhou and Hangzhou produce... um, excellent craftsmen... the Xiangshan artisans..."

"If you're that eager, go ahead." Mei Lin was one of his "generals," usually quite enthusiastic in his work. Mei Wan couldn't refuse some accommodation. Besides, blocking someone over women was the sort of thing that bred resentment. The reasoning about helping build houses was sound enough, and Mei Wan immediately agreed to recommend him for the inspection team.

"One more thing—do you know how I can exchange my circulating certificates for silver?" Mei Lin asked with sudden seriousness. "Or gold would work too."

"What for?" Mei Wan was puzzled. In theory, elders weren't supposed to hold precious metals; using silver or gold required approval. "Travel expenses will be allocated—you don't need to worry about that."

Mei Lin mumbled, "No, I was thinking... in case I might need ransom money... I don't know how much silver would be enough..."

Mei Wan stared. "Surely not—you're actually serious about this?!"

The final person heading to Hangzhou was a missionary currently preaching in Lingao—Father Trigault, or Father Jin Lige. This time he would travel to Hangzhou to liaise with the local church. Trigault was thrilled by the prospect: in Europe, he had been intensely fascinated by this "heavenly city" described by Marco Polo. Now he had an actual chance to personally visit Hangzhou and meet the lambs of the holy church that Father Nicolas Trigault had originally established there.

The External Intelligence Bureau was going to the trouble of including him in order to leverage Jesuit influence. Hangzhou's Catholic Church included a number of locally influential gentry. Although two of the "Three Pillars"—Yang Tingyun and Li Zhizao—had passed away in 1627 and 1630 respectively, both had been Hangzhou natives: Yang Tingyun from Qiantang County, Li Zhizao from Renhe County. Many of their relatives and friends remained Catholics, and the Jesuits wielded considerable local power. So much so that during the Nanjing Persecution, Shanghai and Hangzhou had been the two safest refuges for foreign missionaries.

Zhao Yingong was currently an outsider in Hangzhou, lacking sufficient influence and protection. The network the Jesuits had cultivated locally could certainly prove useful. Moreover, this connection could facilitate ties with Xu Guangqi.

Xu Guangqi was closely connected to Sun Yuanhua, who would play an important role in the coming Dengzhou Rebellion. Both men were Catholics. Establishing this connection would be extremely advantageous for future operations.

"Wouldn't this require Zhao Yingong to become a Catholic? That seems somewhat inappropriate. And getting too deeply involved with the Catholic Church wouldn't look good locally," He Ying observed when reviewing the External Intelligence Bureau's application.

"Zhao Yingong doesn't need to become a Catholic, and he doesn't need deep involvement. He merely needs to display friendliness toward the Church and a certain 'interest.'" Li Yan explained. "The Jesuits are pragmatic. They'll urge Hangzhou's Catholic gentry to serve as protectors—they understand perfectly well that to make progress in China now, they rely mainly on our military power." He added, "According to the Political Security General Administration's *Compilation of Jesuit Missionary and Macau Mail Inspections*, they currently pin their greatest hopes for spreading Catholicism in China on us. They'll do whatever they can to satisfy any request we make. As long as Zhao Yingong has Jesuit introductions, he can receive support from this group of Hangzhou Catholic gentry, which will benefit his activities there."

"But Zhao Yingong is planning to claim descent from the Song imperial house..." He Ying's implication was clear: for a proper Song imperial descendant to become entangled with a foreign religion was quite improper—problematic in terms of "political correctness."

"Regarding this Song imperial identity he's invented, I think having a few flaws is actually better for everyone," Li Yan replied. "Besides, as I've said, he doesn't need to be baptized. He merely needs the Jesuits to make introductions and establish a friendly relationship. In the long run, it's also inadvisable to let Zhao Yingong become too entangled with Hangzhou's church. My suggestion is to place a naturalized Catholic among his staff, to serve as a channel for building relations with the local church."

"This person is reliable?"

"Of course—someone trained by our Bureau."

Father Trigault, completely unaware of the elders' machinations, went off excitedly to prepare his luggage. He had first received a warning from He Ying: he must not reveal that Zhao Yingong was coming from Lingao. He could only follow the External Intelligence Bureau's standard script.

"You understand, our current situation on the mainland is very delicate. If an elder's identity were exposed, it would not only have adverse effects on our enterprise, but would also produce unpredictable and serious consequences for the missionary enterprise." He Ying was direct. "I trust you understand my meaning."

Father Trigault grasped this diplomatic language perfectly—the Jesuits had never been so naive as to believe the Australians were devout believers intent on serving as a "Catholic Elder Council." The cooperation between both sides was ultimately a mutually beneficial relationship. So he indicated very clearly that all his words and actions would follow the inspection team leadership's guidance.

Beyond the Jesuit channel, they also needed to rapidly build reputation through the bookshop. The plan was to make Zhao Yingong's library-bookshop sufficiently distinctive from ordinary ones—just as the Purple brand shops had risen swiftly in Guangzhou. Therefore, this shipment would also include various "Australian building materials" and luxury goods: cement, ceramic tiles, plumbing hardware, glass, and more. Some of this, of course, was for the Hangzhou Station's own use.

Although some elders questioned whether heavy use of Australian goods might create an obviously "Australian" association that could invite trouble, Li Yan believed it was no major concern. The reputation of "Australian goods" was famous not only in Guangdong; even in Jiangnan and the capital, it was already well-known. Zhao Yingong's identity was that of a wealthy young master from Sanshui County, Guangdong—possessing abundant "Australian enjoyments" was not unusual at all. It was entirely plausible.

Because this shipment included considerable cargo and personnel—particularly some heavy items—overland travel would be too slow. The Jiangnan inspection team decided to take a Dabo Shipping oceangoing vessel.

"What if we encounter Zheng Zhilong?" This was a concern everyone shared. Zheng Zhilong now completely dominated the waters off Fujian, effectively strangling the maritime route north.

How to deal with Zheng Zhilong had always been hotly debated between the Elder Council and the Navy. Beyond the immediate need for shipping goods to Jiangnan, future involvement in the Dengzhou Rebellion and population trade with the Manchu Qing might all hinge on Zheng Zhilong's stance. Some argued they could temporarily pay passage fees in exchange for peaceful transport. Others thought they should attack Zheng Zhilong now and completely clear this obstacle.

"Zheng Zhilong's primary concern is monopolizing oceangoing trade, especially the routes to Japan and the Philippines. Historical records don't indicate he ever monopolized coastal shipping routes. Furthermore, with Zheng Zhilong's forces, he might not even be able to effectively blockade such routes. The intelligence we've gathered from merchants in Guangdong and elsewhere also shows no evidence that Zheng Zhilong collected transit taxes on coastal routes. What we should actually worry about is scattered pirate attacks along the coast—Zheng Zhilong's maritime hegemony..."
