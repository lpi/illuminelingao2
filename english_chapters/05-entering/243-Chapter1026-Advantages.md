# Chapter 1026 Advantages

Lin Baiguang was quite comfortable in the Anping guesthouse. Although it was government property, it was essentially Zheng family private property, with maintenance and expenses naturally more generous than the Emperor's. Not only were the buildings clean, but the hostel clerks looked well-fed and were extremely attentive to this "honored guest" of the Zheng family.

However, the Zheng family's reply was like a stone sinking into the sea—no word at all. His entourage eagerly watched the courtyard entrance every day, hoping for a Zheng family messenger. Besides the hostel attendants and clerks who came and went solicitously, there was no one.

His entourage were all naturalized citizens, and they grew anxious one by one, fearing they and their "chief" might be detained by the famous great sea lord, possibly losing their lives.

Lin Baiguang wasn't worried at all. The Zheng family couldn't possibly not swallow this bait—even knowing it was poisoned, they couldn't refuse. Zheng Zhilong had a strong "gamble" mentality. Through "gambling," in merely a decade or so, he had risen from a small servant under his uncle to a settlement leader under Yan Siqi, then leaped to become the Southeast Sea's hegemon.

Just as Zheng Zhilong would be lured to the Qing military camp and seized decades later, this actually wasn't his first time—a few years ago, he had been tricked onto a ship by Taiwan's Dutch governor Nuyts, kidnapped, forced to sign a trade agreement, and paid ransom to Nuyts. But when the Manchus tempted him with territorial enfeoffment as a king, Zheng Zhilong took the bait again.

From this perspective, the Great Library believed doing salt trade with Zheng Zhilong was entirely feasible—as long as it was business, everything was negotiable.

However, although neither the Senate Standing Committee nor the Branch Committee had revealed how they would resolve Zheng Zhilong and Liu Xiang, it was obvious that ambitious sea lords like Zheng Zhilong and Liu Xiang were inevitably targets for elimination. Their groups were too large to accept reorganization. Even if they accepted, the Zheng family's leaders and the intertwined subordinate captains and confidants made this group difficult to quickly absorb into the Navy and Commerce departments.

Moreover, major sea lord groups like Zheng Zhilong and Liu Xiang were quite harmful to China's coastal maritime trade through their monopolistic pursuits. After Zheng Zhilong defeated Liu Xiang, he sold international trade maritime passage rights at high prices—one sailing permit cost 2,000 taels per year, effectively completely blocking ordinary merchants and boat owners with insufficient finances from participating in ocean trade. Before the Ming fell, the Zheng Zhilong group had virtually monopolized the Hirado trade with Japan. Among Chinese ships arriving at Hirado, one quarter were Anhai ships under his direct control. And their struggles and monopolies in Chinese coastal areas also seriously affected domestic maritime trade along the coast.

The Senate wanted to seize maritime hegemony and construct "Pax Senatoria"—peace under Senate rule. The purpose of achieving hegemony wasn't merely obtaining excess profits, but more included promoting maritime trade and stimulating coastal industrial and commercial development. If trade profits were all monopolized by channel merchants, except for necessities and luxuries, traders and retailers would eventually be forced to withdraw from this commercial system. Excessively high prices would also cause consumer purchasing power to shrink or even disappear.

"Private monopoly means reaction." Ma Qianzhu had characterized the sea lords at an expanded Executive Committee meeting. "It is backward—an old thing obstructing productive forces."

"Obstructing productive forces" was a very serious characterization—roughly equivalent to a death sentence.

Thus completely crushing them and absorbing the remnants was the Executive Committee's only choice—this had already become consensus among Senators with access to core secrets.

His purpose in coming to Anping wasn't primarily to show goodwill or lull Zheng Zhilong—that was incidental. The Ocean Fleet and transport squadrons cared nothing about either Liu Xiang or Zheng Zhilong's naval forces. The Senate's fleet basically sailed outer ocean routes. Unless Zheng Zhilong had radar and wireless radio, accurately catching the fleet would be very difficult. Even if he was incredibly lucky enough to catch the fleet or adopted an ambush approach waiting at certain locations, the battle outcome would still be unfavorable to him.

The Navy had conducted numerous map-based wargame simulations at Maqiao, simulating various hostile activities Zheng Zhilong, Liu Xiang, and the Dutch might undertake. Under various harsh conditions, these three powers still lost completely.

Taking Zheng Zhilong's group for example: If Zheng Zhilong wanted to attack Operation Engine forces—never mind the main First Fleet and Second Fleet—even just to intercept transport squadrons, he would have to deploy his entire main force to the Penghu area and set up positions. And the transport convoy commander would have to be foolish enough to crash right into his ship formation. Once Lingao learned he was deployed at Penghu, nine auxiliary boat squadrons returning would be enough to crush Zheng Zhilong.

If Zheng Zhilong's fleet hid along the coast, that would relatively ensure their advantage. After all, in harbors and bays crisscrossed with sandbars and reefs in shallow waters, his fleet's majority of light vessels had great flexibility, and fire ships also had some chance of success. But Operation Engine's transport routes generally wouldn't approach the mainland coast.

Zheng Zhilong was also unlikely to actively sortie to outer ocean routes to intercept Senate convoys.

Traditional Chinese navigation depended heavily on maritime landmarks. Because China hadn't developed latitude and longitude concepts, even with compasses, there was still the problem of being unable to position ships. The traditional method was celestial observation, roughly determining one's position through star positions.

But more common and convenient was using maritime landmarks. In traditional navigation guides—"bearing books"—bearings to various destinations and courses were clearly recorded. Changing course and heading always used sea landmarks as navigation markers. So ship navigation generally followed coastlines or sea islands and sandbars as navigation markers.

Due to these congenital deficiencies, Zheng Zhilong's ocean warfare capability was actually very weak. Except for the Dutch, neither Liu Xiang nor Zheng Zhilong had the ability to conduct search operations across broad ocean surfaces. Actually, their battles with the Dutch and other sea lords almost entirely occurred near coastal bays and islands.

As for the Dutch, auxiliary boats alone numbered nine squadrons—thirty-six large fuchuan and guangchuan. Any one of these thirty-six had no less firepower than large Dutch warships, and the quantity far exceeded them.

Although Zheng Zhilong was said to have hundreds of warships, among them only thirty to fifty were dedicated large warships. Individual ship combat power was far inferior to auxiliary boats—even Dutch small sloops and brigs could fight Zheng Zhilong's fleet with inferior numbers. Even if Zheng Zhilong concentrated all his warships, he might not be a match for the auxiliary boat squadrons.

The Navy used computer programs to conduct simulated naval combat tests. One side was a typical large Dutch armed merchantman: the *NEW BANTAM*, with 800 tons cargo capacity, maximum displacement over 1,200 tons—among the largest class in East Asian waters. Shipboard firepower was 7 eighteen-pounder culverins and 16 twelve-pounder demi-culverins—these were all the guns capable of entering artillery combat. Since cannons were distributed on both sides, its single-broadside volley weight was only about 150 pounds.

*NEW BANTAM* was not only completely helpless facing *Lichun*-class and 901 types—rifled gun power against early smoothbores was practically godlike. According to software calculations: the destructive power of 130mm Dahlgren rifled gun solid shot, incendiary, and explosive shells, even with very conservative estimates, required at most only five or six hits to completely destroy *NEW BANTAM's* combat and sailing capability. In one software simulation, a solid shot even directly penetrated the hull, hit the powder magazine, and blew up the entire ship.

Even facing auxiliary boats without rifled guns, Dutch top warships had no advantage whatsoever.

When facing auxiliary boats equipped with 48-pounder smoothbore cannons and 68-pounder carronades, not only was volley weight inferior to auxiliary boats, but range, penetration, and accuracy were also completely outmatched.

A typical auxiliary boat of the guangchuan type with approximately 200-ton standard displacement had 6 forty-eight-pounder cannons alone, plus 4 sixty-eight-pounder carronades. A single broadside could throw 280 pounds of shot—roughly double *NEW BANTAM's*.

Moreover, the culverins and demi-culverins on Dutch warships had low individual shot weight and weak penetration. Culverin penetration was far inferior to 24-pounders. According to French long gun data, Napoleonic-era 18-pounder long guns at 100 yards had less penetration than 24-pounders at 300 yards. One 24-pounder shot had more destructive power than two 18-pounder shots—not to mention 48-pounder guns. With good carriages, 24-pounder rate of fire was also much faster than culverins and demi-culverins.

As for 68-pounder carronades, their point-blank range was 270 yards, while culverins were only about 330 yards. At 5-degree elevation, carronades actually outranged culverins. And culverins needed about 100 yards range against galleons for sufficient lethality, while 68-pounders were the opposite—penetration was so strong that they worked at great distances. Although fuchuan construction was weaker, exchanging fire still wasn't a problem. In an artillery duel at 300 yards, culverins could certainly wreck fuchuan, but 68-pounders could blast armed merchantmen to bits.

As for the Hexie-class with even less firepower, despite having inferior single-broadside volley weight compared to *NEW BANTAM*, even without escort from combat vessels like auxiliary boats, Hexie-class vessels sailing in convoy were still the most formidable fleet in East Asian waters. A transport convoy of five ships had enough firepower to fend off the fleet the Dutch could deploy at once.

After all, to deal with Dutch fleets, Zheng Zhilong always had to concentrate his main force and fight in coastal waters just to win.

No matter how they calculated and simulated, as long as they didn't rush headlong into narrow waters for melee, whether Zheng Zhilong, Liu Xiang, or the Dutch—none were a concern.
