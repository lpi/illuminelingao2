# Chapter 877 - Hangzhou Church

The entire Hangzhou Church had approximately fourteen or fifteen hundred baptized members. Cattaneo baptized about two hundred people on average each year. He spoke of the various difficulties and peculiarities of preaching here, emphasizing that gaining the support of the gentry class was most important for missionary work in the Great Ming. Because their influence was very extensive—not only could they protect the church's security, but common people often looked to them as models. Often when a local gentry figure was baptized, many people around them would follow suit. Many scholar-official converts would have their entire families baptized—not just themselves and their household members, but even the family servants would be baptized along with them.

When gentry and scholar-officials were baptized, this immediately solved the church's funding problems and the issue of buildings for preaching stations. Without gentry converts' donations, poor converts couldn't contribute, nor were there enough numbers to "form a tower from grains of sand." The church would have to rely on remittances from Macau to survive and would have difficulty purchasing buildings and land.

The Hangzhou Catholic Church, with the support of a group of Catholic gentry represented by the Yang and Li families, had always been able to maintain a stable state in Hangzhou. Missionary work was rarely disturbed, and so developed rapidly.

Spreading the faith starting from Confucian scholars and scholar-officials was the missionary strategy formulated by Matteo Ricci after entering China. In Zhao Yingong's view, Ricci truly deserved his reputation as the first European to understand Chinese society—earlier Europeans, including Marco Polo (if he had truly even visited China), were merely curiosity-seeking tourists passing through.

But this strategy, Zhao Yingong felt, was too focused on the "upper class route." Although many people from poorer classes had also been baptized into the church—quite a few had even "martyred" themselves in religious persecution cases. The first Catholic martyr in China was a cake vendor during the "Nanjing Religious Case." But overall, the Catholic Church in the Great Ming lacked social roots and "floated on top." The result was that when the Yongzheng Emperor banned Christianity, it was quickly eradicated throughout the country—the Catholic faith having had few adherents to begin with.

After the Second Opium War lifted the religious ban, Protestant Christianity surged ahead in missionary work, largely because of their "popular" approach. Protestant churches opened hospitals, schools, took in orphans, and conducted various charities, achieving remarkable results.

But this observation was something Zhao Yingong wouldn't share with Cattaneo—the "grassroots route" was the Elder Council's specialty. Of course, Cattaneo might not be unaware of the drawbacks of the "upper class route," but under the social environment of the time, taking the "upper class route" was an unavoidable choice. Without the "accumulated prestige" of Britain and France after the Second Opium War, the Protestants' "grassroots route" might not have worked either.

Though based in Hangzhou, Cattaneo was not isolated from church news. The Macau Catholic Church sent messengers to the mainland churches every few months with letters. Local churches would also send letters back with the messengers. Some letters destined for Europe were loaded onto ships in Macau. Though letters spent years in transit, the church's communications had never been interrupted. Even during the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns when missionary work was completely suspended, Beijing missionaries still maintained contact with the churches in Macau and Europe.

Cattaneo had carefully read the Jesuits' letter—this old missionary who had weathered many storms understood China's national conditions very thoroughly. Through news from Hangzhou Church members and Beijing missionaries, he knew perfectly well the true identity of this "Cantonese" Chinese: they were the "Australians" in whom the President placed great hopes.

The Australians' war with the Great Ming in Qiongzhou and their unstinting efforts to spread the holy teachings there both surprised and delighted Cattaneo. His brothers—Father Lu Ruohua and others—in their three years of pastoral work in Qiongzhou had achieved more than they had in forty years of hardship.

He didn't quite understand why the Australians were interested in the Jesuits and missionary work. Letters from Macau indicated that although there were a small number of Catholics among them, the Australians did not come from a Catholic country. They couldn't really be said to have any religious faith at all—the letters specifically mentioned their atheistic tendencies. At the same time, the head of the church in Lingao among the Australians was clearly not a qualified clergyman. Obviously, their help spreading religion in Qiongzhou wasn't motivated by religious zeal but by some practical interest.

Now, this mysterious Australian appeared before him, and what exactly his purpose was greatly interested Cattaneo.

Zhao Yingong made no secret of his purpose. Evasive or cryptic language was worthless. The Jesuits were willing to help the Elder Council precisely as a manifestation of the Elder Council's power. As long as the Jesuits still intended to preach in Qiongzhou, Cattaneo had no choice but to help him.

"You mean: to use the power of our Hangzhou church members to protect your commercial interests?" The Italian listened quietly to his explanation, then spoke.

Zhao Yingong said: "Yes. You've been in the Great Ming for many years; you should understand the difficulties and interference an outsider like me faces in conducting business here. And you certainly know the influence a gentleman holds in Ming society."

Cattaneo nodded thoughtfully: "You're quite right."

"So I must ask the Hangzhou Church for help." Zhao Yingong looked into the dignified Italian elder's eyes.

"What kind of commercial projects do you want to conduct in Hangzhou?" Cattaneo was very interested. He knew from letters from Macau that the Australians were a group of skilled craftsmen capable of manufacturing many novel and inexpensive goods.

"Many." Zhao Yingong said. "For example, raw silk."

Cattaneo said nothing more, just nodded slightly. The raw silk trade was an important source of income for the Macau Jesuits. Before trade with Japan was cut off, the Jesuits purchased "Nanjing silk" through merchants each year to resell in Japan for enormous profits. The priest naturally knew that so-called Nanjing silk was actually "Lake silk" from Zhejiang and Southern Zhili.

That the Australians came to Zhejiang to get involved in silk production and trade didn't surprise him. That they asked the church to use its influence to provide protection was also expected—Australian warships and cannons, no matter how formidable, wouldn't appear at the mouth of the Yangtze.

Of course he would agree to the Australians' request—this was not only his duty as a Jesuit but was also necessary for spreading the Gospel in China.

He made the sign of the cross, murmuring: "Let God's will be done."

In the subsequent casual conversation, Zhao Yingong mentioned Sun Yuanhua. Cattaneo spoke highly of Sun Yuanhua, considering him a future mainstay of the Ming church—Li and Yang had already passed away, Xu Guangqi was getting on in years; only Sun Yuanhua was in his prime. He was already Governor of Dengzhou-Laizhou, and apart from Xu Guangqi, was the highest-ranking official among Chinese converts.

Sun Yuanhua's home was in Jiaxing, not far from Hangzhou. In Jiaxing, he had prepared a quiet, comfortable villa for the missionaries. Cattaneo had once retreated there to write for a period; the two had a good personal friendship.

Without much effort, he obtained Cattaneo's promise to write a letter of introduction to Sun Yuanhua for them. Zhao Yingong's reason for wanting to meet Sun Yuanhua was quite legitimate—he wanted to sell military supplies to this regional official who was most deeply immersed in Western military theory and technology.

From Cattaneo, he obtained all the support he wanted. Thus, when Zhao Yingong subsequently visited the principal gentry converts of the Hangzhou Church, he was received with great hospitality. The heads of both the Li and Yang families held family banquets for this "catechumen."

Zhao Yingong knew that with the Jesuits' letters of introduction and Cattaneo's referral, he could gain the trust of the Hangzhou Church's key members. But proper social courtesies also had to be observed. So he had prepared a large quantity of gifts in advance.

Considering that recently baptized converts and church organizations tended to be more fundamentalist, overly luxurious personal items shouldn't be given as gifts lest they create offense. So the bulk of the gifts were religious books. He had the Jiangnan Inspection Team bring a large case of Chinese-language religious books printed in Lingao when they departed. These Chinese editions were mostly small religious pamphlets compiled by the old time-space Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, including commonly used books like *Catechism Questions and Answers* and *Compilation of Essential Prayers*. For converts who were desperately short of high-quality Chinese Catholic books, this was like sending charcoal in snowy weather. He also donated three hundred taels of silver to the church—using Delong notes—and promised to ship plate glass to renovate the church windows.

He additionally gave a batch of simple, practical "Australian goods"—matches, small knives, windproof oil lamps with glass chimneys—distributed among the church's leading figures and ordinary members. These items had actually begun appearing on the market in small quantities recently, but their high prices kept ordinary people from buying them.

These gifts indeed won the Hangzhou Church's great goodwill. Leaving aside Cattaneo himself, even ordinary church members were won over by this far-traveled "catechumen's" generosity. Zhao Yingong was quite modest in conversation, occasionally letting slip his "admiration for the holy teachings." This increasingly endeared him to the church's power figures.

The arrival of a new priest also created a small ripple in the calm church—people always prefer fresh things. On the first Sunday after Trigault arrived at the Hangzhou Church, he celebrated Mass for everyone. Because word had spread that a new missionary had arrived, many of Hangzhou's Catholics came—the small church actually received four or five hundred people. Trigault was moved to tears during his sermon. Zhao Yingong found it quite boring—but to curry favor with the local church, he still maintained a respectful appearance.

In the end, his efforts achieved complete success. Although Zhao Yingong wasn't a convert, his status as a "catechumen" was recognized by the Hangzhou Church. Very easily, he gained the support of several gentry in the church—especially the Li and Yang families. He collected several visiting cards and Cattaneo's letter of introduction to Sun Yuanhua.
