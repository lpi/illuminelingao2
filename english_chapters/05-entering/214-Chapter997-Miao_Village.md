# Chapter 997 Miao Village

Kong Lingyang guessed correctly. The arrival of Mu Min, concurrently serving as Director of the Li-Miao Affairs Office, and Fang Jinghan, was precisely to recruit National Army soldiers from the local Li and Miao population.

The Li and Miao population on Hainan Island had always been unusable manpower for the Senate, which had been a constant sore point for the labor resource-strapped Planning Bureau.

However, the Li and Miao people had extremely low productivity levels and were accustomed to primitive commune-style living and production patterns. Historically, they also had strong conflicts with local Han people. Converting them into industrial and agricultural population was very difficult.

To effectively control and utilize the Li and Miao people, on one hand, the Religious Affairs Office pursued a "dual-religion approach"—Catholicism and Neo-Daoism penetrated deep into the mountains from south and north respectively to proselytize extensively. Through religious proselytizing and health service penetration, they sought to grasp the spiritual dimension of the local populace, thereby controlling the entire society.

On the other hand, by expanding trade and abandoning traditional exploitative high-profit methods in Li-Miao trade, they used lower profits and more goods to stimulate local commodity economy development, supplemented by medical outreach and small-scale agricultural technology promotion. Using material means to promote social evolution.

Although there had been ideas about recruiting Li and Miao people to form mountain infantry in the past, the Military General Administration believed there was no urgent need currently. The Li and Miao people's physique and physical fitness were generally poor, and many had malaria, requiring prolonged treatment and recuperation. Organizing them as combat troops was costly.

Operation Engine required landing on Taiwan Island. The General Staff and Foreign Intelligence Bureau compiled materials from the *Haitian* and Great Library, believing that using security forces composed of Li and Miao soldiers in Taiwan operations was appropriate. Especially in future operations against Taiwan's Plains Tribes and Gaoshan indigenous peoples, Li and Miao soldiers' jungle and mountain mobility could prove useful.

For this purpose, after discussions between the Military Training Directorate and the Li-Miao Affairs Office, they dispatched a joint work group to Li and Miao settlement areas in Lingao, Sanya, and Changhua where both sides had more contact and a certain foundation of mutual trust, to conduct recruitment work.

Wei Aiwen took a comfortable sip of oolong tea and asked: "Old Kong, are there many Li and Miao people here?"

"Plenty." Kong Lingyang heard him ask this and knew his guess was right. "To be honest, Changhua's economy is the Li-Miao economy."

This was true. If the Senate also calculated GDP data for counties under its rule, seventy percent of Changhua's GDP came from trade activities with the Li and Miao.

"Are there many Miao villages? Approximately how many Miao people?"

"Very few. Based on intelligence we currently have, there are fewer than ten Miao villages, each ranging from twenty or thirty to a hundred households. Total population is around five or six thousand. No detailed data." Although Kong Lingyang had only recently taken up the post, Li Haiping during his tenure had conducted various surveys continuously, accumulating large amounts of first-hand materials.

Generally speaking, there were many Li villages and few Miao villages. Moreover, Miao villages were smaller than Li villages, and more impoverished and backward. Because the Miao people were latecomers to Hainan Island—they were descendants of the "Wolf Army," "enforcers," and "crossbow poison archers" conscripted from Guangxi along with Ming troops to suppress Li uprisings. After the war ended, the Miao troops were disbanded on the spot, dispersing to various places to settle. Because they came late, the better land and mountains had already been taken by Han and Li people, so Miao villages were generally in mountainous areas with poorer natural environments. Besides barely cultivating some land, they survived by hunting and gathering mountain products, and also tenant-farmed land and forests of Han and Li landlords.

Fang Jinghan interjected: "How are relations between Miao and Li? And with local Han people and us?"

"The Miao people don't have major conflicts with anyone—small frictions are inevitable. The Miao people are very poor; they have no land—not even mountain land. Most survive by fishing and hunting, rarely contacting outsiders." Kong Lingyang hadn't been to a Miao village, but from his "Li-Miao Affairs Liaison"—Worker Wang, who had led the survey team to Qiandui Village and Shilu River back then—he obtained much intelligence about the Li and Miao people.

Wei Aiwen listened very carefully. He was particularly interested in Miao villages—Hainan's Miao population was the smallest with the worst economic conditions. They also had historical conflicts with the Li people. So he believed they were more reliable to use. Since the Hainan Miao came as auxiliary troops, they had a tradition of fighting. Absorbing them as security forces was a very suitable choice.

"Are there any Miao villages we're relatively familiar with?"

"Yes, Li Haiping originally had good relations with several Miao villages..."

"Can we visit one?"

"Of course." Kong Lingyang nodded repeatedly. "The cooperative has a local employee specifically responsible for Li-Miao trade named Wang Daliang. Half Han, half Li. Originally a local shop worker. Can speak Li and Miao languages and is very familiar with various villages."

Wei Aiwen nodded: "Arrange for us to visit a Miao village tomorrow." As he spoke, he asked again: "Old Kong, we came this time to recruit some Li and Miao able-bodied youth to be soldiers. Do you think the local Li and Miao people would be willing to enlist?"

"Definitely can recruit some." Kong Lingyang said, "Whether Li or Miao, they all live hard lives. Although the labor intensity of swidden farming isn't too great, days of eating one's fill aren't many."

Then Kong Lingyang discussed the current situation of negotiations with Changhua's Li and Miao villages. Currently, most Li and Miao villages in Changhua had trade relations with the Cooperative's Changhua Branch. Relations at least couldn't be called hostile. Recruiting some able-bodied men shouldn't be a problem.

The next day, led by the local trader from the Cooperative, the visiting delegation members once again set off on the road to visit a Miao village.

The Miao village's location was very remote. Although on the map the straight-line distance from Changhua Fort was less than 30 kilometers, the terrain was rugged, with tall grass and dense forests. The whole party could only follow the guide's steps, shuttling along a barely discernible trail, only arriving at the Miao village early the next morning.

Before entering the village, they were startled by a terrifying sight in a grove outside the village. On the branches of large trees, many objects resembling rolled reed mats were placed horizontally. Some were already half-rotten, scattered on the ground. The group was very curious, but Fang Jinghan knew this wasn't anything interesting.

"This is the Miao village cemetery." He explained, "For the Miao people here, when someone dies, they're placed like this on tree trunks in the forest..."

Hearing this, Mu Min hurriedly kept her distance. Wei Aiwen, although accustomed to seeing dead bodies on battlefields, couldn't help but feel chills down his spine.

"How come we've never heard of this custom?" Mu Min felt strange. She had toured the Southwest and visited quite a few Miao villages without hearing of such a custom.

"This is undoubtedly a local custom." Fang Jinghan said, "As for whether mainland Miao villages have such customs, I haven't researched. But you went as tourists; they surely wouldn't advertise such customs as a selling point."

They soon arrived at the village gate. Wang Daliang came and went here often and knew the way well. The able-bodied men guarding the village gate immediately let them in.

The Miao village's conditions were far inferior to the Li people's Qiandui Village they had visited before, visibly very impoverished. There were only forty-odd households. The village had no proper walls, using thorny plants as a natural hedge. The village houses were extremely crude: bamboo-built frames, bamboo strips woven into walls plastered with yellow mud on the outside, roofs covered with rice straw. In the village, some free-range pigs, chickens, and ducks wandered about.

According to Wang Daliang's introduction, the Miao people here could barely afford to buy anything, only trading hunted game and gathered mountain products for the Cooperative's salt and iron implements.

A hunting economy was a very unstable source, so they also planted swidden rice—yield was low, barely maintaining the village's basic livelihood. Kong Lingyang was promoting some simple cash crop cultivation in Changhua's Li and Miao villages, but transportation here was simply too inconvenient, so they were temporarily excluded.

"With the Miao people living on such difficult mountains, others naturally find it hard to come in, but wouldn't it be hard for them to go out?" Mu Min said.

Wang Daliang said this was nothing for the Miao people. The Miao people were very skilled at crossing mountains and ridges—not only climbing fast but never tiring. When Miao village people went to market, they completed round trips of a hundred *li* on the same day.

"This is excellent material for mountain infantry." Wei Aiwen said, a greedy look appearing in his eyes—having them serve as security troops was somewhat wasteful.

Mu Min observed the village with great interest, sighing that living standards here were truly too harsh. Ordinary people's three meals consisted of thin congee or mixed grain porridge. Apart from eating meat after hunting, there was almost no meat daily—not even vegetables. No vegetable plots could be seen around the village, so rice was only eaten with salt. The blessing of southwestern peoples—chili peppers—had only recently begun being planted in Lingao in this dimension.

The reason Kong Lingyang had Wang Daliang bring them to this village was naturally because poverty would make it convenient for them to recruit people.

She suddenly asked: "I feel the Miao people here are very different from Miao people on the mainland."

"Some experts believe that the Miao of Hainan Island are actually Yao and Dong people from Guangxi, possibly mixed with some Miao people." Fang Jinghan said.

With Wang Daliang's introduction, they soon met the village elder. By the fire pit, Mu Min presented gifts to the elder. In the subsequent conversation, Wei Aiwen deployed his glib tongue, boasting about how promising serving Australia-Song and the Senate was, how "all three meals are white rice, meat every meal." Those recruited would also receive settling grain. He spoke so convincingly that even the elder himself was somewhat tempted, sighing repeatedly that he was too old.

Although the elder had no direct experience of the Fubo Army's treatment, the Cooperative had been conducting trade here for two years, always honest and trustworthy, with a very high reputation locally. So the elder didn't doubt the truthfulness of these words.

The visiting delegation quickly achieved their objective: the elder agreed to let them recruit soldiers locally. With his full cooperation, Wei Aiwen recruited more than a dozen people from this one village alone.
