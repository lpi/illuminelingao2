# Chapter 1004 The Company's Concerns and Ambitions

News that the Australians had appeared in Formosa sent tremors of anxiety through the East India Company bigwigs in Batavia. Though the Tayouan trading post had been underperforming and its importance had declined considerably since the signing of the trade agreement with the Australians, Formosa remained crucial as a direct window for China trade.

The prospect of Australian ships surveying Formosa represented dire tidings for the Dutch. De Carpentier and Batavia's Council had dispatched the *Magdeburg* during typhoon season, risking the treacherous voyage to Lingao specifically to gather intelligence.

Trini understood their anxiety well. He pondered for a moment before speaking. "These past months, I've sensed they're planning a major operation. But I cannot confidently state that such an operation targets the company's interests."

He then described the large-scale activities he had witnessed in Lingao: massive flows of imports and exports, frequent personnel transfers, and vigorous shipbuilding operations. The Australians had clearly entered a state of war readiness.

"All Australian institutions, factories, and ships are running at full capacity..." Trini observed. "Ships enter and leave port with remarkable frequency, constantly moving goods in and out—and this during what should be the off-season."

"If that's the case, why do you still believe these preparations aren't directed at the company?"

"The answer is straightforward. They're procuring equipment designed for cold northern regions." Trini said. "Many goods in their order forms submitted to the company cannot possibly be used in Formosa. I suspect you're aware of this as well."

Thus reminded, Van de Lantron recalled that the Australians' recent orders had included substantial quantities of woolen cloth and leather, along with purchases of Persian raw wool and Indian raw cotton. These goods would be useless in Formosa's climate.

"Furthermore, with respect: I believe that with the company's entire strength in East Asia, the Australians wouldn't require such extensive war preparations. Their intended opponent is far stronger and larger than our masters."

Van de Lantron nodded. "Your reasoning is sound. However, to reassure the Governor and the gentlemen of the Council, I would very much like to know precisely where they intend to strike—and why they visited Formosa."

"I believe their chosen target is the Ming Empire—that is, China. Their visit to Formosa may serve various purposes—perhaps securing a midway stopover point. The specifics, I cannot determine..."

"Please continue."

"The Ming Empire possesses vast territory, an enormous population, and incomparable wealth. The Australians crossed the world to reach East Asia and now command formidable military strength. If their ambitions of conquest and plunder did not include the Ming Empire, I would be profoundly surprised." Trini paused meaningfully. "Moreover, they chose this particular place—Lingao—as their base deliberately."

"Very well. Assuming the Australians are indeed preparing to launch a conquest of the Ming Empire, what do you estimate their chances of success to be?"

"They can unquestionably defeat Chinese armies ten times their number with ease. But conquering all of China is obviously difficult to accomplish—at least not in the short term." Trini considered his words carefully. "China's territory is simply too vast. To subdue such a nation, the Australians' present strength remains insufficient."

"Assuming—purely hypothetically—that someday the company found itself at war with the Australians. Could the company achieve a favorable peace outcome?"

"With respect, I believe it would prove exceedingly difficult. Peace would certainly come eventually, but the terms might not favor our side." Trini spoke frankly. "The Australians' military potential is truly astonishing. Once fully mobilized, I fear no one could oppose them."

"What if we struck before that potential fully developed?"

"Is that also included in your mission this time?"

"Three or four directors—you must understand, they are our masters, and they're not in Batavia. They have proposed... hoping to assess... whether seizing Australian territory might prove worthwhile."

Compared to the desolate Tayouan, Lingao bustled with activity and prosperity. The territory had undergone thorough development with numerous military industries and large shipyards; its comprehensive strength vastly exceeded even Portuguese Macau. If it could be seized, it would obviously constitute an ideal base for China trade—perhaps even for dominating East Asian commerce entirely.

The Senate was well aware of Trini's assigned mission but viewed it with complete indifference.

Since the Senate was preparing to launch Operation Engine, they had no desire to divert forces to deal with unexpected attackers. They very much wished to make the Dutch understand that their military strength simply could not be challenged by anyone.

Accordingly, Trini was sometimes even invited by the Foreign Intelligence Department to observe army and navy training exercises and was permitted to create detailed drawings of the Fubo Army at close range. The Australians maintained only certain requirements for these drawings—for instance, soldiers' head-to-body ratios had to be rendered as 1:7, muscles drawn in the Greek fashion, shoulders conforming to Germanic proportions...

But since these conventions aligned with Renaissance scholastic painting traditions anyway, Trini was naturally happy to comply.

"I mean no disrespect to the gentlemen, but this idea is—frankly—insane. The Australians possess extreme confidence in their military force. They quite casually display it to me and allow me to continuously send sketchbooks back to Batavia."

"So what is your assessment?"

"From my personal observations, Australian soldiers are in fact local natives—the vast majority being Chinese. Only a very few officers are Australians. When they recruit soldiers from the mainland, the physiques are quite poor—not much better than Southeast Asian monkeys. But their musket firing speed and accuracy have become terrifying. I've never encountered such formidable professional soldiers..." His voice grew more emphatic. "The officers are equally excellent—professional soldiers led by Australian commanders no less capable than Gustav's finest officers. I've witnessed many times: they rise before dawn, then march silently on foot from one county to another."

"Meaning they don't march on foot because they lack ships."

"They're drilling their army to cross steep mountains rapidly, then immediately engage in combat. Actually, every soldier must perform this kind of practice."

"The great Hannibal... is that what you're suggesting?"

"Whether they match Hannibal's level I find difficult to evaluate, Your Excellency. But their combat power clearly surpasses most armies I've observed."

"As for ships, they don't possess enough yet. But there will be many in the future, Your Excellency. Please be certain to bring this sketchbook back and inform the gentlemen in Batavia: the Australians constructed a several-hundred-ton sailing ship in fourteen weeks."

"What?!"

"Their shipyard operates with extraordinary efficiency, though I've never managed to get close. From a distance, it appears many ships are being built simultaneously, side by side. The second identical vessel was launched just ten days later."

"This is too astonishing. I believe I should verify it with my own eyes."

"Before you depart, you'll witness the next one launched."

"Do you believe the Australians harbor intentions to expand southward?"

"It's only a matter of time." Trini smiled slightly. "When you possess a matchless army and powerful fleet, would you send them home to farm?"

"Your work is truly outstanding. I shall recommend you to the Council in Batavia."

"That's kind of you, but unnecessary. I'm an Italian, and Italians have no homeland. My homeland is whatever work my employer assigns me."

"What do you think of Lingao?"

"I truly wish Lingao were in Italy."

"Fortunately for us, Lingao is not in Italy," Van de Lantron replied.

"Where Lingao is located hardly matters." Trini sensed that Van de Lantron's questioning had concluded. He stood and retrieved a bottle of rum from the liquor cabinet, then took out two bottles of "soda water" and two glass cups. He fetched some crushed ice from the "icebox" and mixed two rum sodas in the local fashionable manner.

"A pleasant indulgence," Van de Lantron praised after drinking.

"Let our masters contemplate the Australians' ambitions and objectives. For now, I have an Australian project to propose to the Council."

"Oh? Was it proposed by the Australians themselves?"

"Indeed. The Australians have provided me with some agricultural books and illustrations, asking me to translate them into an illustrated manual." Trini handed him a thick notebook as he spoke, then settled back onto the sofa to continue his explanation. "The Australians are preparing to supply us with seedlings for the company to cultivate on some small island in the Moluccas. They intend to purchase the mature crops."

"What crop?"

"From what I observe, it appears to be rubber trees."

"Rubber trees?" Though rubber trees and rubber had been known since Columbus's time, Europeans remained quite unfamiliar with this plant. Trini's knowledge of natural history enabled him to recognize this species unseen in Europe.

"Yes, an American plant..."

"They've been to America as well?"

"Very possibly. Otherwise, how could they provide rubber tree seedlings?"

"What use do they have for these rubber trees? Why not plant them on the lands they occupy—you mentioned the Australians now effectively control the entire island."

"I suspect they lack sufficient labor. As for rubber's purpose, I'm equally uncertain." Trini knew that rubber trees secreted a sticky colloid that Indians used for kicking as balls, and which could be applied to cloth for waterproofing—though once dried, it hardened and lost practical value.

That the Australians wanted the company to cultivate this plant meant they had obviously mastered some technology for utilizing this colloid. The Moluccas were hotter and rainier than Lingao, with a climate similar to rubber's place of origin. That the Australians conceived such an idea wasn't surprising.

"Additionally, I believe that since the Australians want the company to promote cultivating these crops in the Moluccas, they won't pursue the company's assets for at least seven years—otherwise their investment would become worthless."

"Why seven years?"

"Because it requires at least seven years from planting rubber to producing the rubber they require."
