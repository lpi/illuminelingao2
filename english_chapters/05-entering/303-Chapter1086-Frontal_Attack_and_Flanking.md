# Chapter 1086 - Frontal Attack and Flanking

Chen Guangfu was also experienced in battle arrays. After watching for a while, he also felt it was thorny—this was much more troublesome than attacking Huang County. At that time, Huang County didn't have many armed forces, and morale was low from top to bottom, so it was easily breached. Now this group of village braves had just won a victory at Baimatang. Regardless of combat power or morale, they were at their peak. He was afraid he wouldn't gain any advantage in this battle.

It was clear that they had to gnaw on a hard bone.

But if they couldn't gnaw this hard bone down, they couldn't attack Laizhou with peace of mind. Whether it was easy or hard to handle, Qimu Island had to be fought.

Mao Chenglu and Chen Guangfu consulted for a moment and decided to launch an attack early the next morning. Mao Chenglu would lead the main force to storm from the sandbar to attract the attention of the island's village braves, while Chen Guangfu would lead the elite troops to detour on the ice surface to raid Qimu Island.

"If we conquer Qimu Island, you, brother, will take the first credit." Mao Chenglu smiled all over his face, "I heard that Qimu Island has extremely large amounts of population, grain, and property. After taking it down, we brothers can make a big fortune."

Mao Chenglu played a trick. He had already suffered a big loss from the Qimu Island village braves in the Battle of Baimatang. Although he did not personally direct the battle at that time, he still knew from the routed troops who fled back later that the opponent's firearms were incomparably sharp. Not only did they shoot far, but they also fired fast. After a few rows of guns, the soldiers couldn't hold on.

If one person said this, Mao Chenglu could think he was making excuses. If dozens of people said the same thing in unison, the authenticity of these words would be greatly improved.

So Mao Chenglu encouraged Chen Guangfu to lead surprise troops to detour, while he himself led the main force to attack from the front—no matter how sharp the enemy's firearms were, they couldn't match his six Red Barbarian Cannons. When giant shells weighing over ten *jin* hit, no matter how strong their fortress was, under the bombardment of his own giant cannons, and then letting the coerced refugees charge the formation to fill the ditches, the enemy would naturally lose their footing. Then he would have an opportunity to exploit.

As for Chen Guangfu, if he could attack onto the island, naturally it would be best. If he couldn't, it wouldn't matter much.

How could Chen Guangfu know his calculation? He thought that because he led reinforcements to come, Mao Chenglu wanted to give him a favor. He immediately agreed profusely, and also said that if they conquered Qimu Island, they would definitely split the property equally, and he would never let Brother Mao suffer a loss.

After the plan was settled, they went back to reorganize their troops separately.

Among the nearly ten thousand people Mao Chenglu brought, only one thousand five hundred could actually be called combat soldiers. The rebels in Huang County plus the reinforcements brought by Chen Guangfu totaled five thousand. Although the rebels coerced nearly ten thousand people in Huang County and claimed to have an army of one hundred thousand, there were no more than three thousand combat soldiers among them. Mao Chenglu left half of the combat soldiers to guard the county seat and took the other half of the combat soldiers and two thousand auxiliary soldiers to attack Qimu Island. The rest were mostly coerced refugees.

Because the granaries in Dengzhou were extremely abundant, these one thousand five hundred combat soldiers were fully equipped with weapons and equipment, and all had iron armor—although the quality varied, at least everyone had armor, which was already very rare for the Great Ming army. Many of the auxiliary soldiers also managed to get a suit of cotton armor or leather armor. The most exaggerated things were firearms. In addition to six Red Barbarian Cannons, these one thousand five hundred combat soldiers were actually equipped with eight hundred guns of various types. In terms of the popularity level of firearms, it was considered world-class at that time.

These miscellaneous firearms and ammunition were either loaded on wheelbarrows or carried on shoulders and backs by people, transported by coerced refugees. The six "giant cannons" were pulled by looted plow oxen, slowly moving towards the sandbar.

Walking in the front were the newly "recruited" refugees. Calling them "soldiers," in fact, there were able-bodied men, old and weak people, and even women mixed in. As for weapons and equipment: most people just held a wooden stick, and some simply had nothing. The rebels only used refugees as cannon fodder and labor, so naturally, they had no intention to arm them, let alone any training.

Only after fighting a few battles, and after most people died anonymously, would the survivors who had been through battles be absorbed into the army and become members of this team—this was the most common growth model in various rebel armies at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Those who could survive in the end must be soldiers who had experienced hundreds of battles and were the toughest.

In order to prevent refugees from fleeing, the mounted house guard (*Jiading*) squad constantly patrolled around the large group of people composed of refugees, driving them with whips to march in the designated direction.

Chen Guangfu's team quietly separated from the main force. He only brought five hundred people. Except for his house guards, personal soldiers, and some night scouts, the rest were all veteran army ruffians of many years. They were all unusually fierce characters who didn't care about their lives for money. Hearing that there was a stockade on Qimu Island with tens of thousands of refugees, everyone's eyes lit up. As long as they attacked up, they wouldn't worry about not grabbing dozens of taels of silver and a few beautiful women.

Under Dengzhou and Huang County cities, because a large number of women were looted by the rebels, human markets had formed. Rebels who went out to loot sold the women they grabbed to their cohorts in the human market, and the business was very booming.

Everyone had a horse: these people all had experience riding on ice, and the horses' hooves were wrapped with anti-slip cloth strips. Moreover, Chen Guangfu's intention in equipping all of them with horses was not for them to charge on horseback, but to pass through the ice surface quickly. After landing on the island, they would immediately abandon the horses and fight on foot—actually, they were mounted infantry.

Although dragoons were created by Europe, mounted infantry had always existed in China. Maneuvering on horseback and dismounting to fight on foot was not rare in wars at the end of the Ming Dynasty.

Because they had to walk on the ice surface and heard that the opponent had many firearms, these people all changed into cotton armor which was relatively light and effective in resisting firearms. Their boots were wrapped with straw ropes. In addition to personal sabers and shields, each person also carried a javelin—besides being thrown before the assault, this javelin also served as a self-rescue tool in case of falling into an ice hole: the Dongjiang Army had been on the islands of Liaodong for a long time and had relatively rich experience in fighting on ice.

In addition to weapons, everyone carried a few small earthenware bottles filled with fierce fire oil and a slow-burning tinder. They just waited to break onto the island and immediately set fires everywhere.

In his view, despite there being many people on the island, as long as his five hundred elite soldiers landed on the island, the village braves would fall into chaos. At that time, the entire Qimu Island would be easily obtained.

The column stopped at the entrance of the sandbar. The squad leaders and patrol leaders under Mao Chenglu busied themselves for a while, reorganizing the chaotic team and barely maintaining order.

Mao Chenglu rode on a horse, slowly came to the front of the motley crowd surrounded by house guards, and shouted loudly: "Everyone risk your lives to kill into the stockade! Take money, silk, and grain as you please! Steamed buns provided enough to fill you!" There was a commotion in the crowd immediately. Mao Chenglu sneered and said loudly again: "There are several thousand women in the stockade. You can take as many as you want, as long as you can get them! In troubled times, human life is as cheap as paper. Everyone lives today not knowing if there is a tomorrow. If you are a man, don't die with your bird facing the sky without even touching a woman's tits!"

From the originally somewhat depressed crowd, there were actually a few shouts of approval. Someone shouted: "When a man dies, his bird faces the sky; if he doesn't die, he lasts ten thousand years! Even if dying, one must eat full and play with women enough before dying!" The surrounding crowd immediately let out a burst of wild shouts. Under the incitement of these few sentences, the primitive instincts in the hearts of these poor people who were still good citizens less than ten days or half a month ago were exposed. Everyone's eyes turned red, and morale suddenly skyrocketed.

Mao Chenglu knew that his few sentences had already played a big role. He immediately ordered the whole army to advance onto the sandbar.

The sun gradually rose. The four wildernesses were filled with cold white light. In the early morning of a winter day in the first lunar month, the wind was piercingly cold. The huge rebel crowd was like a flood, rolling towards the sandbar of Qimu Island. The white vapor breath sprayed out by tens of thousands of people when walking was magnificent.

Chen Sigen stood on a watchtower on the bastion of the Willow Palisade, observing the advancing rebels with a telescope.

The dense crowd made his scalp numb just by looking—what made him sigh even more was that those walking in front, just as Zhu Mingxia said, were all poor commoners with ragged clothes and vegetable-colored faces.

They were in tatters, many walking barefoot in the snow, their skin frozen blue. They knew clearly they were going to deliver themselves to death, just for a few empty promises.

Thinking of what Zhu Mingxia said to him, he knew that Captain Zhu didn't mind how many poor commoners he killed at all, and was even worried that he would be soft-hearted.

*Even if I want to be soft-hearted, I can't do it.* Chen Sigen thought. *With the formation in front of me, blood will inevitably flow like a river in front of this Willow Palisade.*

The defense of the Willow Palisade had been urgently reinforced. The original willow fences had their crowns cut off and tops sharpened. The cut branches, selected for thickness and straightness, were tied horizontally between willow trees. Smaller ones were made into abatis and erected at grenade throwing distance. Just crossing this fence would cost a heavy price.

The artillery on the bastions was configured with emphasis on the two wings according to Chen Sigen's instructions—they could concentrate fire on the enemy coming from the front, and also shoot onto the ice surface. After all, now the sea surface on both sides of the sandbar was frozen. The enemy could completely go down to the ice surface, bypass the obstacles of the Willow Palisade, and attack the bastion directly. Therefore, steep slopes about the height of a person had been dug out on the coastline near the bastions—naturally, most coastlines had this kind of erosion slope; the detachment just trimmed it. Water was poured on the steep slopes to freeze into ice.

He noticed that six Red Barbarian Cannons had set up positions about eight hundred meters away from the Willow Palisade. Looking at the appearance of the cannons, they should be culverins firing twelve-pound cannonballs. The effective range of this kind of cannon was nearly two *li*, a very powerful firearm.

Chen Sigen learned from the sent intelligence data that the rebels were very experienced in using firearms, and had maneuvered heavy artillery many times, defeating government troops repeatedly. In the entire chaos of Dengzhou, the rebels' use of artillery was the most brilliant.

Here, the gunners under Mao Chenglu were busy. These six Red Barbarian Cannons were all taken from inside Dengzhou City. These gunners were also trained by the Portuguese. A patrol leader monitored from the side, constantly issuing commands. The soldiers performed their own duties; setting up gun positions and loading artillery appeared very skillful.

A gunner raised a wooden ruler, closed one eye to observe the Willow Palisade—they used relatively simple and primitive parallax rangefinding. Even so, it was rare in the Great Ming army at that time.
