# Chapter 1046: Occupying Jeongui

"There are stone people!" Nangong Wudi suddenly discovered stone statues standing at the city gate, with very peculiar appearances.

These were the unique stone statues of Jeju Island: "Dol Hareubang" (Stone Grandfather). They were a manifestation of ancient stone worship.

However, Nangong Wudi was not a cultural scholar, nor a tourist, so he had little interest in these. After observing the defensive situation on the city wall for a long time, he shouted:

"Shikawa!"

"Here!" Shikawa Shuji, who had been promoted to sergeant in the Public Security Army, immediately ran out of the formation. A Public Security Army platoon had been included in the special task force attacking Jeongui County Seat.

"Take your men and capture the county seat for me within ten minutes."

"Understood!" Shikawa said crisply.

Shikawa and his men quickly prepared for battle. He looked at Nangong as if asking for instructions, and seeing the other nod, he abruptly drew his *tachi* (sword), a ferocious look appearing in his eyes: "Fix bayonets!"

Following Nangong Wudi raising his *tachi* high and letting out a heart-rending howl: the more than thirty Japanese mercenaries of the Public Security Army's Japanese Company held their Southeast Asia Pattern rifles with gleaming bayonets fixed, howling "Banzai!" at the top of their lungs, and started a "pig charge" (reckless charge) together.

Rushing at the very front was the "Battotai" (Drawn Sword Squad) led by Shikawa, each brandishing a gleaming *tachi*, roaring wildly and charging forward.

"Suppressive fire." Nangong Wudi ordered.

All Minié rifles opened fire at the city wall together, a dense rain of bullets sweeping across the top. After a round of shooting, no Joseon soldiers were left standing on the wall.

The Japanese mercenaries ran quickly across the open ground—there was no moat outside the city, so they approached the foot of the city wall easily. Under the suppressive fire of Minié rifles, not a single feathered arrow was shot from the wall, nor did anyone dare to poke their head out to throw a stone. The mercenaries soon rushed to the foot of the wall. They had no ladders or ropes, but the short and sturdy Japanese soldiers stacked one on top of another, quickly building a human ladder.

The first to climb the wall was the Battotai. Only after getting on the wall did they realize how tragic it was—the width of the wall top could at most accommodate one person standing; even two people walking past each other was impossible. If not for the slope right behind, where a misstep would at most mean rolling down, the Japanese mercenaries, who surged up wildly with fierce momentum, would have surely fallen to their deaths.

There were few Joseon soldiers left on the wall. Under the continuous firing of Minié rifles, the low and thin parapets couldn't withstand high-speed bullets. Some soldiers were killed on the spot, while others fully utilized the advantage of the slope and immediately slid down the wall.

The bloody battle on the wall that Shikawa imagined did not happen—they faced only dozens of terrified Joseon soldiers with no will to fight. Seeing this group of "Wokou" had already climbed the wall, except for a few officers leading a few soldiers to barely engage and being quickly cut down or stabbed, the rest dispersed in a hubbub.

In less than ten minutes, the Japanese mercenaries had already captured the city gate. Shikawa swung his *tachi* fiercely to throw off blood drops, led a few men running down the wall, rushed to the city gate, removed the gate bar, and opened the gate, all in one go.

"Not bad." Nangong Wudi looked at his watch; exactly ten minutes. Although this was expected, the fanaticism displayed by this bunch of mercenaries like Japanese devils was quite something to watch.

The main force soon entered Jeongui County Seat. How to occupy and loot had already formed a standard procedure in the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission had even compiled a special ISO standard manual to guide the occupation steps of newly captured cities, serving as a course in officer and administrator training. And a special search team under the Planning Commission's jurisdiction was included in every deployed unit to handle the reception, registration, and custody of loot and prisoners.

The troops entering the city quickly cleared out the stragglers inside. After hoisting a flag written with "Surrender and Spare Death" and constantly broadcasting in Korean with a loudspeaker, the Joseon soldiers who hadn't been killed soon came out from various corners in twos and threes to surrender.

Due to insufficient troops to surround the entire city, quite a few soldiers and commoners inside jumped off the city walls and fled. Nangong Wudi didn't chase them—this place was an island itself, and it wasn't easy for fugitives to cross the sea to the Korean Peninsula. Except for a few, the majority would eventually fall into their hands.

Nangong Wudi led his guards and staff officers majestically into the city amidst the tune of "The British Grenadiers" played by fifers and drummers. Unexpectedly, as soon as he stepped into the city gate, he stepped into a mud puddle, splashing mud all over and making his relatively neat uniform filthy.

"Damn it." Nangong Wudi cursed—he had actually forgotten: the streets of most cities in this timeline, whether Chinese or foreign, were not paved. Walking with muddy feet was the most normal phenomenon.

Chaos occurred briefly in the city, but calm was quickly restored under the rapid suppression of the Public Security Army. Commoners and official slaves originally thought Wokou had come; many jumped down from city walls not controlled by the Fubo Army and fled to the wilderness to hide, while some hid in desolate places within the city. Those who didn't have time to flee could only hide in their houses and resign themselves to fate.

Accompanying civil affairs personnel posted notices to reassure the people, and then constantly broadcast in Korean to calm the people's hearts.

Nangong Wudi visited the county seat with interest. Jeongui County Seat looked dilapidated; houses were low buildings with volcanic rock walls and thatched roofs. Even official buildings like the County School (*Hyanggyo*) and Government Office (*Gammyeong*), except for having tiled roofs, were similarly low and small. Basically, a person standing on the ground could touch the eaves by raising a hand.

Ordinary commoners' and official slaves' houses didn't even have floors, just dirt ground. Only the homes of slightly wealthier merchants and officials had raised floors. Because of Jeju Island's geographical environment, the interiors of most houses were very damp and cold.

The county had a County School, a government granary, and a small market with a few small shops and workshops.

The shop owners had all fled, leaving only empty shops. Nangong Wudi looked; they were nothing more than sauce shops, general stores, carpenter shops, wine shops, and blacksmith shops—basic commercial handicraft industries indispensable everywhere. However, he did see a very special workshop: a bow and arrow shop.

The bow and arrow shop was large, empty with no one inside. The stove for roasting bamboo was still lit. Pots boiling ox horn glue and fish bladder glue were simmering on the stove. Piles of timber, bamboo poles, feathers, ox tendons, ox horns, and the like lay on the floor. Finished bows hung on the walls.

Walking through it, finished and semi-finished products could be seen everywhere. Nangong Wudi roughly estimated that there were a hundred finished bows alone, and at least three or four hundred semi-finished ones. As for feathers arrows, there were even more—two or three hundred bundles of thin bamboo poles for making arrow shafts alone.

Obviously, so many bows and arrows couldn't be for Jeju Island itself; they were more likely export commodities from Jeju Island.

Connecting this with the large number of horses and cattle locally, it naturally produced abundant ox hides, ox horns, and tendons of horses and cattle—these were important raw materials for making bows and arrows.

The Occupation Army Command was set up in the best building in the county seat: the Jeongui Government Office.

Nangong Wudi took his seat in the main hall. The captured clerks of the six divisions in the county who hadn't had time to flee were driven over—the local political system of the Joseon Dynasty was a miniature of the Ming Dynasty. The county magistrate's office also had six divisions: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Works, and Punishments, responsible for county affairs. The clerks of the six divisions were all local petty officials selected from local commoners. They were very familiar with the local situation. Therefore, the first step after capturing the city was to control this group of people.

With no salary and no channel for promotion, relying on grey income to live, these petty officials generally didn't have high loyalty to the dynasty. It was so in the Ming Dynasty, and the same in Joseon. Especially when their lives and property were threatened, the petty officials quickly chose to cooperate.

The official language of the Joseon Dynasty was Chinese (Hanmun). Although "Eonmun" (Hangul) existed, it was not widely used; scholars and officials didn't use it, mainly women and lower-class commoners used it. Because important official and private documents were written in Chinese, although these petty officials couldn't speak Chinese, they could read and write Chinese. So the staff sent by the Planning Commission could communicate with them by "pen conversation" without difficulty even without translators.

The petty officials quickly provided sufficient intelligence about the county. The residents within the county seat, including the villages just outside the walls, totaled eight thousand people. Two-thirds of them were official slaves. Of course, many commoners lived in various villages outside the city. The total population of the county, including public and private slaves, was fifteen or sixteen thousand.

Regarding horses, all official horse ranches were under the unified management of the Jeju Magistrate; the County Magistrate had no jurisdiction. However, there were some private ranches raising horses, cattle, and sheep.

"Is there a person named Kim Man-il in this county?" Nangong Wudi suddenly asked.

The petty officials looked at each other, secretly thinking this gang of Wokou had set their eyes on Master Kim!

Kim Man-il was a famous wealthy man in Jeju at the time. Because he donated ten thousand horses to the court at one time, he was enfeoffed as an official (*Nanggwan*).

"Master Kim lives in Jeju, not in this county," a clerk among them answered. "He also has ranches within this county's territory."

The most valuable part of the petty officials' confession was the grain stored in the city: over ten thousand *dan* of grain stored in two government granaries. This figure excited Nangong Wudi quite a bit—at least before the refugees arrived, food was abundant.

But the subsequent conversation quickly made him unable to be happy.

It was true there were over ten thousand *dan* of grain in the county, but Jeju Island had just suffered a famine last year, and grain stocks among the people were extremely scarce. It was just the beginning of winter now; by the time the green crops of next year had not yet ripened (*spring famine season*), relief would inevitably be needed. Moreover, there were five or six thousand official slaves in this county, and these people basically relied on the County Magistrate to distribute food for survival.

Official slaves farmed and grazed for the County Magistrate but got no harvest themselves; their rations and clothing relied entirely on distribution by the County Magistrate. When encountering natural disasters, large numbers of official slaves not only couldn't play a role but became a huge burden on the government office.
