# Chapter 944 – Relief

Lei En didn't offer any opinions—he had only arrived in Qiongshan yesterday evening, and without investigation, he had no right to speak. In a moment he planned to go see the situation himself before commenting. A few days ago, he had already wired the Health Section to collect a certain number of stool samples, awaiting his arrival with the Health Department's mobile testing vehicle to perform examinations.

After an hour, the meeting concluded. Liu Xiang had assigned work to the naturalized citizen cadres. In the view of Lei En and the others, the tasks on the task cards had all been simplified to the extreme—this too was a feature of the "Qiongshan Experience": give naturalized citizen cadres the most easily understood quantitative standards and avoid vague wording. This accommodated naturalized citizen cadres with extremely low cultural levels and no administrative experience.

After the meeting, Liu Xiang held another meeting with the transmigrators on the disaster relief work team. The relief team leader was Yang Yun, director of the Labor Division under the Civil Affairs People's Commission. This person was a Level 3 Human Resources Manager who had served as head of the human resources department and union chairman at a small-to-medium southern sweatshop factory.

Having such a person lead the team fully revealed the Administrative Council's intentions—it seemed the leadership was interested in these refugees as labor. Liu Xiang felt his guess couldn't be wrong, because the arrivals also included transmigrators from the Propaganda Department.

Liu Xiang and the other transmigrators ascended the East Gate tower together.

"This typhoon! This rain!" Liu Xiang, wearing a raincoat, muttered as he stood on the East Gate tower. Behind him were his orderly and guards. Several retained yamen runners and clerks from the county wore bamboo hats and straw capes, standing respectfully in the rain awaiting his orders.

The other transmigrators, under the care of their secretaries and guards, were also on the tower overlooking the multitudes below.

To provide refugees with shelter from wind and rain as quickly as possible, Liu Xiang had ordered the use of eaves on both sides of the street, laying wooden slats and covering them with reed mats to build temporary rain shelters directly over the street. Looking down from the city gate, the entire street had these long shelters erected, looking rather like the covered stalls set up for New Year's goods sales in some county towns in the old timeline. The city gate was guarded by soldiers from the Qiongshan County Security Company, which had been organized by selecting and reorganizing military household soldiers from several local Qiongshan guards. To maintain maximum deterrent effect, all soldiers had bayonets fixed to their rifles.

According to Qiongshan County Liaison Office statistics, approximately 10,000-plus refugees had gathered below the city. Although these people temporarily had shelter from wind and rain, the population was extremely crowded and damp—hardly a long-term solution.

When Lei En pointed out that such arrangements might trigger serious epidemics, Liu Xiang indicated this was a temporary measure.

"I've talked with the liaisons—typhoon damage is something that happens several times each year locally. It's just that this time the rainstorm lasted unusually long, which is why it turned out this way. But at most, in half a month the water will recede..."

"They're certain?"

"No reason not to believe local experience, is there? Also, I've had people clearing buildings at the parade ground—there are one or two hundred guard barracks there, but they've been unused for years and have all collapsed." Liu Xiang said. "Disinfection work is also ongoing. Health Section people distribute ginger soup and epidemic-prevention powder daily."

Yang Yun suddenly interjected: "How much rations are you giving each person per day?"

Liu Xiang said: "According to Chen Sigen, each person needs 1,400 kilocalories per day. I can't calculate big calories (kilocalories). Right now, refugees get two bowls of vegetable congee per day regardless of age or sex. Two hundred grams of brown rice per person, plus some vegetables, taro, and sweet potatoes."

Yang Yun of course knew: in the old days at the sweatshop, the employee cafeteria had been under his jurisdiction too. One hundred grams of rice was only 350 kilocalories; the Qiongshan County Liaison Office was providing only 700 kilocalories of food. That was only enough to keep the refugees from immediately starving.

Liu Xiang had set the supply standard so low for his own reasons. Even at this low level, 2.2 tons of grain were consumed daily. And all he could use was the limited reserves in Qiongshan County's granary.

Qiongshan's grain reserves had originally been quite substantial. A large portion of Qiongzhou Prefecture's official stored grain in the Ming Dynasty was stockpiled in Qiongshan's warehouses. Aside from a portion transferred to Lingao for processing, the rest remained in the city's storehouses. But Liu Xiang had no authority to touch this grain—it was "national reserve grain" under the Planning Commission's jurisdiction and allocation. He could only use county granary reserves.

Now was the time to wait for the summer harvest to come in; both public and private reserves were very scarce. He had tried to borrow grain from local gentry, but the gentry all pleaded poverty one by one, and some even begged Liu Xiang for reductions in summer grain levies—claiming their land had all been flooded and the harvest was a total loss. Liu Xiang had to use both threats and inducements to barely scrape together two hundred *shi* of grain.

These past days he had been organizing refugees to salvage grain from areas where water had receded, collecting flooded rice, taro, and sweet potatoes and baking them dry for use as relief grain.

"...This can't go on long. The county granary's grain is very limited. I can hold out three or four more days at most. Beyond that, I'll need Wu De to approve grain allocation for me." Liu Xiang didn't know what relief supplies Yang Yun had brought, so he made the situation sound more dire.

Yang Yun nodded noncommittally. Liu Xiang sensed he had little interest in allocating relief grain. He couldn't help feeling slightly disappointed—he had some understanding of the thinking among certain people in the Executive Committee. Quite a few of them were unabashed Machiavellians, and in this environment with unprecedentedly few constraints on "political correctness," what they might do was hard to say. He recalled the grain and labor work meetings he'd been summoned to before the typhoon hit. The direction there had been very clear.

Thinking of this, he felt a chill down his spine. He thought: surely the Executive Committee won't pull something outrageous. Disaster relief and famine prevention—these were matters affecting public morale on a grand scale. Playing games with them could easily spin out of control and wreck a good situation. The peace and stability of Qiongshan County was something he'd worked very hard to achieve. Please don't let certain people's hot-headedness ruin it.

Yang Yun suddenly asked: "Where's the congee distribution point?"

"At the end of the street, on that open ground." Liu Xiang glanced at his watch. "Distribution starts in about two hours."

Yang Yun conferred briefly with the other transmigrators, then instructed his secretary: "Tell them to set up at the distribution site."

"What? Set up what?" Liu Xiang asked.

"Good stuff, of course." Yang Yun said. "Let me tell you. This time, the Executive Committee's plan for Qiongzhou disaster relief is as follows..."

The congee distribution point was set up on a large open muddy lot at the end of the street. Liu Xiang had had a layer of soil spread on the ground, then covered with crushed gravel to keep it as dry as possible. On the open ground, ten sheds had been erected, each containing several large cauldrons. These cauldrons had generally been borrowed from government offices, temples, and Taoist monasteries, and half from local wealthy households. Now, thick congee was already bubbling in the cauldrons.

Liu Xiang accompanied Yang Yun and the others in touring the congee sheds one by one. Yang Yun picked up a ladle and stirred the big cauldron. Besides grains of rice, the bubbling soup contained chunks of taro, sweet potato, pumpkin, and various unidentifiable vegetable leaves—it looked quite varied. It was just that the contents were really quite thin.

At the far end of the distribution site, a dozen or so naturalized citizen workers who had come with the work team were busy pulling measuring tapes and driving stakes. Prefab building materials were already piled on the ground. Liu Xiang had also organized a group of refugees to help with the work.

Most eye-catching were three large cauldrons just unloaded from an ox-cart. Several craftsmen were busy building stoves.

"Will this work?" Liu Xiang was somewhat worried.

"It'll be fine." Yang Yun said with a beaming smile. "Contrast creates stimulus. Once the masses are fired up, things will be easy."

At nine in the morning, with the blast of a horn, the previously quiet street suddenly stirred. The weak and exhausted refugees, who could only sit or lie about, heard the horn and helped each other up, heading for the distribution site. Naturalized citizen cadres and Security Company soldiers were maintaining order, sharp whistles rising and falling:

"Don't push!" "Don't crowd!" "Everyone gets a share!" "Watch the children and elderly—don't let them fall!"...

Under the Security Company's supervision, refugees were guided in batches toward the distribution site according to their distance from it.

The moment they entered the distribution site today, they smelled a distinctively different aroma—not the bland vegetable congee of recent days, but a long-missed, rich fragrance of cooked rice, and seemingly other aromas mixed in.

The mellow, fragrant aroma of rice wafted through the air, making heads turn this way and that. Suddenly someone noticed the rice smell was coming from a newly erected shed at the far end of the site.

The crowd immediately surged toward this shed. Sure enough, under a reed-mat awning stood a waist-high earthen platform. On a stove atop the platform, a large pot of fragrant rice was cooking. Beside it, another big pot bubbled with thick brown broth, emitting an enticing aroma.

On a large table, clean wooden boards held rice balls of two sizes, all wrapped in perilla leaves, giving off the fresh scent of rice and vegetables. Several cooks were still shaping new rice balls.

The refugees immediately grew agitated: even before the typhoon came, they had been in the midst of the spring famine since the start of spring, eating thin gruel with more water than grain every day. Now before their eyes was a huge pot of rice! Many stomachs immediately rumbled reflexively. If not for the Australian soldiers in front of the platform, each holding bayonet-tipped bird-guns and glaring fiercely, the refugees would have rushed up and fought over it.

Yet the people cooking above didn't seem to be distributing food. Just as the refugees were at a loss, suddenly cheerful music rang out. To the accompaniment of "In the Field of Hope," Ji Denggao of the Propaganda Department's Mass Propaganda Division strode energetically onto the platform.

"Fellow villagers!" he shouted. "You've been through so much!"
