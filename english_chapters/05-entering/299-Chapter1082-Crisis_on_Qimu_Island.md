# Chapter 1082 - Crisis on Qimu Island

Although no one openly questioned Kong Youde, Kong Youde himself already felt a sense of distrust permeating around him.

This was a very dangerous signal. The army was a place where killing was like cutting grass, and this was even more so in a rebel army creating chaos: in troubled times, human life was cheap, and a trivial reason could lead to death. Not to mention that "straddling two boats" was the most hated thing.

Although Li Jiucheng did not show any suspicion towards him, the excessive trust expressed by Li Jiucheng and his son recently seemed to confirm his view—Li Jiucheng and his son had already begun to suspect him!

It had to be said that this was a very dangerous signal.

Difficult! How should he prove his innocence? Kong Youde sighed deeply.

He certainly trusted his own trusted subordinates, but after all, there were only a few hundred people. If most generals believed he harbored disloyalty, these few hundred people would just be buried with him.

If he didn't have some prestige among the Dongjiang veterans in Dengzhou, if it were anyone else, they might have been killed already!

How to win the trust of everyone had become the biggest problem Kong Youde faced now.

For this reason, he had to try his best to show that he had no second thoughts, including voluntarily moving out of his original residence to avoid the suspicion of harboring Sun Yuanhua.

Fortunately, a few days ago, they received an intelligence report: Sun Yuanhua suddenly appeared in Laizhou and officially began to attend to affairs and arrange city defenses. This greatly cleared Kong Youde of suspicion—however, how Sun Yuanhua escaped remained an unclear matter, so Kong Youde's situation was still somewhat subtle.

Now Laizhou had been rectified by him to be like an iron barrel. Spies also reported back that Yu Dacheng, who was originally dispirited and hiding in the Yamen only chanting scriptures, suddenly cheered up after Sun Yuanhua appeared in Laizhou. He not only dispatched reinforcements but also transported a large amount of grain and military weapons to Laizhou.

Obviously, Sun Yuanhua's "appeasement" attitude was changing—the convenience they gained using "appeasement" after raising the flag of rebellion was being lost. Especially the idea in the original plan to use Sun Yuanhua to write letters constantly sending the news of "willing to accept appeasement" to the court, thereby delaying the court's suppression and expanding their power, had gone completely bankrupt.

Next, the rebels were bound to face the court's suppression. As the saying goes, time waits for no man; the time left for them was getting less and less. at the military council the day before yesterday, everyone agreed that they must take Huang County immediately and besiege Laizhou as soon as possible.

Capturing Huang County was to ensure the safety of Dengzhou, and occupying Laizhou could give the team more room for maneuver as soon as possible, so that they could advance to attack and retreat to defend. Otherwise, sooner or later, they would be trapped to death between the mountains and the sea by government troops.

However, in order to further confuse the court and embolden the ministers in the court who advocated appeasement, it was still necessary to continue expressing the sincerity of "accepting appeasement." Although Sun Yuanhua had escaped, they still had a group of officials in their hands. It was useless to keep these people, so at yesterday's military council, it was decided to release them all, including Song Guanglan, Zhang Tao, Wang Zheng, and others. At the same time, let them take a letter jointly signed by the main generals of the Dengzhou rebels to express their heart of "accepting appeasement."

Because Kong Youde had a relatively good relationship with the Dengzhou officials, this matter was handed over to him. Kong Youde thought: On the surface, this was trust in him—"no suspicion," but in reality, he still hadn't cleared the suspicion of colluding with Sun Yuanhua.

However, there was no foolproof plan right now; he could only take it one step at a time. Kong Youde thought, *things haven't reached the point of showdown yet, but I must capture Laizhou as soon as possible!*

While he was lost in thought, a personal guard came to report that Grand Marshal Li Jiucheng invited him to a military council.

"Go back and report to the Marshal, I'll be there immediately." Kong Youde ordered. He knew that today's military council definitely discussed sending troops to Laizhou.

They had already captured Huang County a few days ago—capturing Huang County took almost no effort, but attacking Laizhou was hard to say. The number of Ming troops in Laizhou was limited, and originally it was not difficult to attack, but now that Sun Yuanhua had entered the city, the defense in the city would inevitably be greatly strengthened. With him sitting in Laizhou as Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou, and Shandong Governor Yu Dacheng cooperating with his actions, needless to say, Shandong's army would be mobilized to reinforce Laizhou.

"Come, bring my armor!" he shouted.

A personal general walked over and said: "Today is not a roll call ceremonial assembly, is armor needed?"

"Of course it's needed!" Kong Youde said loudly, "Military council must not be slighted either."

Speaking, he let the personal guards put on his full armor. Except for not wearing a bow and arrow, it was almost the same style as the "Bow and Quiver Ceremony" (*Tuojian Li*). Although Kong Youde was the Vice Marshal and his prestige in the army was second only to Li Jiucheng, he was very careful, never revealing a trace of arrogance, completely maintaining the low profile of a subordinate.

At that moment, fully armored, he left the Yamen. Someone had already prepared a fine Mongolian horse for him. Kong Youde flipped onto the horse and went to the Grand Marshal's Mansion surrounded by personal guards.

The streets of Dengzhou had become a piece of silence. Those coming and going on the streets were all soldiers wearing uniforms. Occasionally there were commoners driven to work for the rebels, but few people made loud noises. Kong Youde and his party walked in the middle of the road, and people on the road avoided them one after another.

The Festival Hall (*Jietang*) in the Governor's Yamen was now the Festival Hall of the Grand Marshal's Mansion. Starting from the main gate, there were fully armored guards and warriors all the way.

Kong Youde, fully armored and in high spirits, strode into the second gate, passed through two rows of solemn and silent guards with shining swords, spears, and halberds, bowed and walked into the Festival Hall, knelt down about five *chi* away from the official desk, and loudly reported his rank:

"Vice Grand Marshal Acting for Heaven (*Ti Tian Xing Dao*) Kong Youde pays respcets to Your Excellency!"

Li Jiucheng nodded and smiled, saying "Please rise."

In the Festival Hall, the main generals of the rebel army had all gathered. Most of them were generals who had reached the rank of Regional Assistant Commander (*Canjiang*) or Mobile Corps Commander (*Youji*) in Dongjiang Town, and all had a group of basic troops in their hands.

After capturing Dengzhou, the rebels incorporated the local Dengzhou soldiers and the remnants of Southern soldiers, conscripted a large number of able-bodied men from the local Liaodong commoners, and took in many local bandits and desperadoes. The scale of the army suddenly expanded to tens of thousands, but the ones in the army who were truly reliable and capable of fighting were still these original Dongjiang old troops.

The rabble could only serve as cannon fodder to strengthen the momentum. Fighting with the wind at their backs was fine, but once they encountered a hard battle, they would turn into soft eggs. Therefore, Li Jiucheng and others dispatched several people early on carrying pay silver captured from Dengzhou to various islands on the Liao Sea to induce Dongjiang generals to lead troops to "raise the great banner together."

This group of people was not very good at fighting Tartars, but crossing the sea to Shandong to fight government troops was absolutely no problem.

This activity was currently proceeding very smoothly. Some Dongjiang generals had already expressed their intention to rise up together.

But at today's military council, besides the originally planned attack on Laizhou, a new situation arose.

Mao Chenglu, who was sent to Huang County, sent someone back to report: Currently, there was a large group of village braves active within the territory of Huang County. They were aggressively gathering refugees around the Huang County seat. The troops sent by the rebels to loot refugees had already conflicted with them, and most importantly, they suffered quite a loss.

Yesterday, the rebels pursued thousands of refugees taken away by the village braves and fought a battle with the village braves at Baimatang. As a result, not only did they not gain any advantage, but they also suffered four or five hundred casualties. The rest all routed back to the Huang County seat.

"Whose village braves are so bold?" Kong Youde was quite surprised. Village braves generally took "protecting the territory and peaceful people" as their main purpose and would not take the initiative to provoke, only seeking the safety of their own stockade. Moreover, with the current military power of the rebels and the large number of firearms they mastered, ordinary stockades had no second way to deal with it except surrendering at the sight of the wind and letting them dispose of things.

"It's a stockade over largely Longkou." Li Jiucheng said, "Chenglu said they have firearms, and they are very powerful."

Kong Youde lost his voice: "It's Master Lu of Qimu Island!"

Li Jiucheng asked: "What? You know."

"Yes." Kong Youde nodded, "This Master Lu is from the South and believes in the Lord of Heaven like Governor Sun. So Governor Sun looked at him with special regard at first and once allocated him a lot of weapons and gunpowder."

It was not surprising that Master Lu set up a stockade on Qimu Island—everyone did this these days. But why did he want to gather refugees on a large scale?

The land over there in Longkou was definitely not fertile land, so he couldn't be looking for refugees to reclaim wasteland. Secondly, in this time of turmoil and chaos, and it being deep winter, there was absolutely no possibility of reclaiming wasteland.

The only possibility was that they, like various folk Daoist sects on the ground of Shandong, were preparing to take advantage of this huge chaos in Dengzhou to raise the flag of rebellion!

In ancient times, anyone who wanted to rebel always started by coercing the people and sheltering refugees. The rebels destroyed stockades and burned houses wantonly in Huang County, on the one hand, to collect grain and property as much as possible and strengthen the walls and clear the fields; on the other hand, there was also the consideration of coercing a large number of refugees to expand the army.

This Master Lu also had such a plan?! The generals in the Festival Hall instantly exchanged glances.

In this way, the matter became difficult to handle. These generals had been in Shandong for quite some time and knew a little about the folk Daoist sects in Shandong. They knew very well that the incited believers were extremely fanatical. Once this Master Lu really started an uprising under the banner of "responding to the tribulation" in the Huang County territory, the rebels would have to spend a lot of effort to suppress it.

"This stockade must be broken as soon as possible." Geng Zhongming said, "Once they rise up, it will be difficult for us to attack Laizhou!"

"The matter of Laizhou cannot be delayed either." Li Jiucheng said, "If we don't take Laizhou, we brothers won't sleep soundly in Dengzhou. Two prongs! One way to attack Laizhou, and one way to destroy this whatever Master Lu as soon as possible!"

Li Jiucheng decided immediately to give Mao Chenglu another three thousand elite soldiers, asking him to attack Qimu Island immediately and break the stockade on the island. As for Master Lu and his group, anyone with a foreign accent was to be killed entirely. If the refugees with local accents in the stockade refused to obey orders, they were also to be killed entirely—to avoid leaving future trouble.

Because the opponent had many firearms, Li Jiucheng decided to allocate a portion of cannons to Mao Chenglu as well.
