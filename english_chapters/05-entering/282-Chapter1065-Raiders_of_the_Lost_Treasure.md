# Chapter 1065 - Raiders of the Lost Treasure

Order inside the city had not yet been fully restored. Killings and robberies still erupted intermittently. However, Li Jiucheng had already imposed a city-wide curfew—no movement was permitted at night except for rebel forces. Huang Ande had also learned that the rebels had seized enormous spoils, with talk of having "struck it rich." Reportedly, after entering the city, not only had all back pay been distributed, but an additional three months' wages had been issued. Many battle trophies had also been divided. Already, numerous soldiers and officers had switched allegiances and joined the rebels.

"Rebellion" was no longer a terrifying word in these late-Ming times. The Liaodong people in Dengzhou had long suffered discrimination and abuse. Now, tempted by the captured mountains of gold and silver, they had unhesitatingly flocked to the rebel banner.

*Even if it means death, we'll enjoy ourselves thoroughly first.* This was the common mentality of the strong in chaotic times. Besides, death was hardly certain. Soldiers had long seen through the court's facade of strength concealing inner weakness. On the various Eastern River islands, generals had been killing one another; several court-commissioned garrison commanders and roving patrol officers had been slain. Even the court-appointed Regional Commander Huang Long had been seized and had one leg broken. All manner of "lawless" behavior had, in the end, simply been forgiven. No matter how severe the trouble, the outcome might still be "kill and burn, then accept amnesty."

Once amnesty was granted, they would become official soldiers again. The silver already pocketed would remain their own.

Under such thinking, the rebels' ranks swelled like a snowball. Not only did Liaodong people "enthusiastically enlist," but even the surviving Southern troops and local Shandong soldiers unhesitatingly joined the forces that had been their enemies at swordpoint just days before. Even ordinary civilians displaced by the rebellion were joining the rebels simply for a chance to survive.

Chen Sigen watched the Dengzhou city walls with mounting tension. All was pitch black atop them. The rebels had only just taken the city and had not yet established a comprehensive guard system. They probably lacked sufficient personnel for patrols as well. Apart from the dim flicker of lanterns in the watchtowers, virtually no light was visible—an ideal opportunity for infiltration.

The two sniper teams had moved into position. Observers intently scanned the walls with infrared binoculars. The two snipers lay concealed in the sand dunes and beach grass, long suppressors affixed to their rifles, ready to fire at any moment.

*What a pity the best rifle—the Swiss K31—hadn't been approved for this operation,* Chen Sigen thought with some regret. With that weapon, the snipers' hit rate could have been even higher. When it came down to it, Beiwei was still a miser.

Of course, until the machine factory's processing capabilities reached a certain level, such parsimony was understandable. Modern firearms—especially precision weapons—were irreplaceable once worn out. These represented the Special Reconnaissance Team's lifeline.

The assault team had landed. Three four-man squads, two forward and one in the rear, each formed a triangular formation. They moved swiftly toward their designated concealment points—small mounds outside the walls—assumed defensive positions, and began preparing tools and weapons.

Chen Sigen activated his radio and began keying signals to each group.

Responses came quickly from every team.

"Tree Root assumes command. Establishing wireless network. All groups begin positioning and route planning."

Chen Sigen entered the frequency and began communications: "Network Alpha-11, Crocodile entering network. Crocodile team successfully ashore. Requesting permission to commence 'Treasure Hunt' operation. Begin audio test: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, over."

Zhu Mingxia's voice crackled through the shortwave radio: "Received. Permission granted to execute 'Treasure Hunt' operation. Assault boats estimated arrival at 0400 your location for rendezvous. Forward Committee wishes success. Over."

"Newt entering network, begin audio test..."

"Toad entering network, begin audio test..."

Each group proceeded with preparations in orderly fashion.

The sniper teams reported: no fixed sentries at the designated infiltration point on the wall, and no roving patrols.

Chen Sigen checked his watch: 0158. Right on schedule.

"Commence operation." He issued the order via walkie-talkie.

Two groups swiftly approached the wall. The moat presented no obstacle—it was frozen solid. Though the men wore imitation military boots, they were at least 21st-century products with far superior traction compared to local straw sandals or cloth shoes. Even so, as a precaution, straw anti-slip covers had been fitted over their footwear.

One group provided cover at the moat's edge while the other crossed rapidly and reached the wall's base.

To scale the twelve-meter wall, they employed grappling rope guns—propelled by rechargeable high-pressure gas canisters, firing rope lines equipped with anchor claws.

With two soft pops, two anchor lines flew up simultaneously and caught atop the wall. In less than a minute, all four members of Group 03 had scaled the battlements.

The four men moved in leapfrog cover formation toward a watchtower positioned thirty meters from the climbing point.

Controlling an "exit" on the wall required adequate cover; otherwise, four men exposed on the battlements would be easily spotted. The first step was therefore to seize a watchtower and use captured rebel soldiers as cover.

The watchtower stood dark; only a faint glow was visible through the window opening. Clearly the rebels had stationed some garrison troops here—but not many, and their alertness would not be high. This stretch of wall faced the sea, and the Ming forces obviously lacked the capability for opposed amphibious landings.

Chen Sigen watched their movements tensely through his infrared binoculars. Three minutes later, a flashlight in the watchtower window blinked three short bursts: watchtower secured.

Groups 01 and 02 followed up the wall, moving swiftly through the watchtower. The leading sergeant employed night-vision goggles to guide the team, leading them accurately down the ramp despite the pitch darkness.

The groups moved without a word. Though the streets lay coal-black, the two squads advanced in single file with remarkable speed. They soon reached the rendezvous point arranged with Huang Ande's team.

After Huang Ande had briefed his men, each had passed safely through the first two chaotic days following the city's fall. Anticipating that Liaodong civilians and soldiers might launch retaliatory attacks against the local population, Huang Ande had instructed everyone to find empty official buildings to shelter in. They were not to show themselves until after the pacification proclamations were posted. Those with friendly relations among the Liaodong people should hide at their homes.

Sure enough, after the city fell, the Liaodong civilians and soldiers had begun retaliatory massacres. But the barracks remained largely protected. Apart from those among the surrendered troops who harbored old grudges with Liaodong people and were hunted down and killed, most faced no mortal danger.

As order stabilized, the group members gradually emerged and dispersed to gather intelligence. Several had simply joined the rebels to work from within.

At first, reports on the status of leaders and officials in the city had been confused, but gradually the picture clarified. Sun Yuanhua was indeed alive—apparently a failed suicide attempt. But Feng Zongze and the other Exemplars knew well that suicide violated Catholic doctrine and was considered a gravely mortal sin. Sun Yuanhua had quite possibly missed his chance to take his own life amid an intense internal struggle between "duty to the throne" and "faith," and had been captured by the rebels instead.

Other important captives included Dengzhou Circuit Intendant Song Guanglan, Military Supervisor Wang Zheng, and Standard-Bearer Battalion Commander Zhang Tao. Denglai Regional Commander Zhang Keda had hanged himself at Wanghai Tower in the naval citadel in martyrdom for the nation. As for lower-ranking officials and officers, some had died, some had been captured, and some had simply surrendered. Huang Ande took no interest in any of them—his assigned mission required him only to track Sun Yuanhua.

The captured officials were being held in the Military Supervisor's Office inside Dengzhou City—not far from the Governor's office, but not in the same compound. The Governor's office had been seized by Li Jiucheng and others as their "Marshal's Headquarters."

Sun Yuan had exploited his former status as one of Sun Yuanhua's personal retainers. The rebels were recruiting former attendants of captured officials to serve the prisoners and prevent suicides. Through this opportunity, Sun Yuan had successfully infiltrated Sun Yuanhua's immediate circle.

Sun Yuan still felt considerable affection for his old master. After all, as a personal retainer, he had enjoyed a comfortable life for a time. Now that his master had fallen into misfortune, and his sworn brother was working to rescue him, Sun Yuan was eager to help. He therefore made himself conspicuously attentive, remaining constantly at the Military Supervisor's Office.

One of Huang Ande's other men had worked through separate connections to obtain a position as a menial laborer at the Military Supervisor's Office—fetching water and tending fires for the guards watching the prisoners. He served as liaison.

Three hours ago, Huang Ande had received the rescue notification. He had already secretly cached weapons, prepared to rescue Sun Yuanhua on his own if necessary. In the Treasure Hunt operation, this constituted Plan B: Huang Ande and his local team would rescue Sun Yuanhua, then be extracted from the city by the Special Reconnaissance squad. However, Chen Sigen believed that Huang Ande's hastily assembled band of misfits would probably not prove capable of the task. Thus, the final decision was to employ Plan A: Special Reconnaissance as the main assault force, with the intelligence team providing support.

At this moment, Huang Ande waited anxiously with Zhu Si in a ruined building in the shadows beneath a memorial archway. It was extremely dangerous to be on the streets after dark—anyone caught by patrols would be executed on the spot, no questions asked.

Zhu Si wore a ragged leather coat. The latter half of the night was bitterly cold, and his teeth chattered uncontrollably. A short knife was tucked at his waist. Though afraid, he also longed to see the "extraordinary people" Brother Huang had spoken of.

Just as he was drowsing off from the interminable wait, Huang Ande suddenly produced a small black box, pressed it a few times, then listened intently. He immediately nudged Zhu Si and whispered: "Heads up—they're here!"

Zhu Si forced his eyes wide open. There was no moonlight, no starlight. In the pitch-black street, where only the outlines of buildings were visible, a faint rustling suddenly sounded—yet nothing could be seen. Just as he puzzled over this, several large men materialized before him like phantoms, nearly making him cry out in shock.

These men wore tight-fitting jackets and trousers—not solid black, but a mottled pattern of varying shades of gray-black that blended almost seamlessly with the night. They wore caps, and their faces were covered by something that left only their eyes visible. The leader had two cylindrical devices strapped over his eyes—a very strange sight indeed.

Huang Ande stepped forward to meet them: "Treasure Hunt!"

"Raiders!"

*Note: After verification of historical materials, it was confirmed that following the fall of Dengzhou, the rebels conducted large-scale massacres of local residents. Accordingly, certain passages in Chapter 305 have been revised; previously published descriptions in Chapter 304 regarding the aftermath of Dengzhou's fall have also been amended.*
