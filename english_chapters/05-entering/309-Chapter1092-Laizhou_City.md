# Chapter 1092 - Laizhou City

Laizhou Prefecture School, the highest institution of learning in the prefecture, now served as the temporary residence of the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou. Here, Sun Yuanhua had established his headquarters.

He sat rigid in his office, his features etched with worry. The tea on his desk had long since gone cold.

After fleeing Dengzhou, Laizhou had become the linchpin of everything remaining under Sun Yuanhua's control. Whether the rebellion could be contained within the three eastern prefectures—whether the rebel soldiers could be prevented from devolving into yet another uncontrollable wave of "roving bandits"—and whether Sun Yuanhua's own future and very life could be turned from peril to safety, all hinged on whether this city could be held.

Day after day, Sun Yuanhua exhausted himself planning the defense. Yet nothing came easily.

As Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou, he did not possess the sweeping authorities his counterparts in the Qing Dynasty would later enjoy, commissioning prefectural and county officials to administer an entire province. His duties were largely military. Sun Yuanhua's substantive rank was merely Right Assistant Censor-in-Chief—Fourth Rank, First Class—and his appointment formally styled "Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou Areas Assisting in Military Affairs." He lacked even the concurrent title of Vice Minister of War. Compared to Yuan Keli, who had held the same governorship with the additional designation of "Assisting in Expeditionary Military Affairs and Supervising Grain and Pay," his powers were considerably diminished. By Qing standards, he would have been little more than a Dengzhou Defense Intendant, with scant ability to interfere in local personnel or finances. He certainly could not compare with Shandong Governor Yu Dacheng—though Yu himself had already been dismissed and summoned for interrogation by the court.

In terms of rank alone, Laizhou Prefect Zhu Wannian was also Fourth Rank, his equal. Should the prefect choose not to cooperate, he could easily feign compliance or simply ignore him altogether.

Fortunately, Zhu Wannian proved to be a man of broad vision and considerable competence. Since Sun Yuanhua's arrival in Laizhou, the prefect had deferred to him in all matters. Ye County Magistrate Hong likewise demonstrated sound character and ability. Working together, they had raised grain and funds, trained local militia, and restored some measure of morale among the city's scholars and civilians.

Yet the defensive force remained dangerously thin. Counting original garrison troops, military households, routed soldiers retreating from Dengzhou-Laizhou, and newly recruited village militiamen, the entire Laizhou garrison numbered no more than three thousand men.

Among them, professional soldiers capable of actual combat were precious few. Though some military households contained able-bodied fighters, most were vulnerable and poorly equipped—scarecrows in all but name. More critically, Sun Yuanhua lacked experienced, battle-hardened officers to lead them. While Guard officers like Centurion Bai Zhongren displayed commendable loyalty, they had no real combat experience. Sun Yuanhua had been exerting every effort to transfer fresh troops into the city.

So far, not a single reinforcing army had reached Laizhou. Though Huang Long had promised soldiers, when they might actually arrive remained unknown. Sun Yuanhua lay awake each night consumed by this problem. Ill tidings piled upon one another: first Huang County fell, then word arrived from Jinan—Yu Dacheng had been dismissed and ordered to appear for questioning. Xu Congzhi, the former Shandong *Wude* Intendant, was taking over as Shandong Governor.

This latter news proved especially unsettling. In terms of culpability, Yu Dacheng's failings paled before Sun Yuanhua's own. If even Yu faced dismissal and interrogation, his own fate would likely be no better.

Though Yu Dacheng could hardly be called a political ally, he had rendered considerable assistance after Dengzhou's fall, and their coordination had been smooth enough. A new Shandong Governor might not prove so accommodating.

Sun Yuanhua knew of Xu Congzhi, but beyond the name, specifics regarding his temperament and whether they could work together remained open questions. Moreover, once the court resolved upon suppression, Xu Congzhi would inevitably come to Laizhou to direct strategy. The matter of cooperation between them loomed large.

After years on the Liaodong front lines, Sun Yuanhua understood intimately how much depended on one's colleagues: countless Ming officials and generals had been destroyed by their own supposed allies.

Unfortunately, he had lost all his advisors here in Laizhou. Even his personal secretary had been arranged by Yu Dacheng initially. Now, when he needed counsel, he found no one at his side.

It was too late to recruit advisors. More to the point, with his own safety and future so uncertain, who would willingly serve him now?

As for the various officials and local gentry participating in the defense, they cared only about holding Laizhou. Governor Sun's personal fate concerned them not at all.

With anxieties pressing from within and without, Sun Yuanhua grew ever more devout in his faith. Since the Lord had used the hands of the Australians to rescue him from the abyss of eternal damnation, perhaps He would also see Laizhou and its governor through this trial.

Though he still harbored some wariness toward Master Lu and his people, after much deliberation, he concluded they were the only ones who might help him now. Steeling himself, he composed a letter to Master Lu, requesting either a personal visit or an envoy to Laizhou to discuss critical matters face to face.

Among the servants Lu Wenyuan had initially sent him was one who specialized in pigeon correspondence, carrying cages of messenger birds. There was even a dedicated amanuensis: Master Lu had asked Cheng Lingsu to continue serving him, and should he wish to write letters, Cheng Lingsu would pen them on his behalf. Sun Yuanhua would never have committed such confidential matters to paper in his own hand anyway—a lost letter could spell disaster.

Each time Cheng Lingsu communicated with Qimu Island, she employed some form of concealing agent. After writing, the paper appeared completely blank—this was nothing novel; Sun Yuanhua was familiar with alum writing. But even watching her write, he could not decipher the message: she wrote not characters but strange symbols, one after another.

Just as he was about to summon Cheng Lingsu to write on his behalf, his servant Sun Yuan entered with a report: "Village militia from Lü Family Village of Pinglidian have arrived to help defend the prefectural city..."

Sun Yuanhua waved dismissively. "Send them to Prefect Zhu first. Tell them not to worry about grain and pay—I will personally review them tomorrow." Militia from various localities had been arriving constantly since Laizhou Prefecture began recruitment; he paid little mind to any particular group.

"Begging the Lord's pardon, but the militia leader claims he was entrusted by Master Lu of Qimu Island to deliver a letter to the Lord..."

Sun Yuanhua's spirits surged. "Show him in immediately!"

The visitor was a young man of perhaps thirty, wearing a six-panel cap lined with cotton and a plain cotton robe. But despite the humble attire, his tall, powerfully built frame, the sideburns visible beneath the cap's brim, and the confident way he strode in—raising wind and dust with every step—told Sun Yuanhua everything he needed to know. This was a *Kunzei*—a Short-hair!

Yet the moment the man opened his mouth, it was in the authentic Laizhou dialect: "This commoner Lü Zeyang, Deputy Regiment Commander of the Lü Family Village Militia of Pinglidian, pays respect to the Lord!" He bowed deeply.

That demeanor alone confirmed it. Sun Yuanhua knew with certainty the man was a Short-hair.

Still, Lü Family Village of Pinglidian was a substantial settlement in the local area. Though the Lü clan were not gentry, they were a great native lineage, having dwelt here for nearly a millennium. Famous figures had emerged in every generation, particularly during the Song Dynasty, when Prime Minister–level statesmen like Lü Mengzheng and Lü Yijian had brought the family considerable prestige. They commanded significant local influence.

How had this man assumed the name of Lü Family Village? And that name—it aroused his suspicion. Lu Yang didn't look like this; that had been a handsome young lad.

"Strong man, no need for such ceremony." Sun Yuanhua raised his hand. "Your surname is Lü... Could you be Lu Yang?"

"This humble one is Lü Zeyang," the man replied loudly, "not Lu Yang. I am a native of Laizhou!"

So they were not the same person after all. Sun Yuanhua wondered how many Short-hairs had infiltrated here. This Lü Zeyang spoke with an authentic local accent and claimed to hail from Lü Family Village—he must have been lurking here for quite some time.

These pirates had quietly laid such groundwork right under his nose! The realization sent a chill down his spine.

Yet the fact that this man arrived with armed militia demonstrated that Manor Lord Lu was deeply committed to Laizhou's safety. Sun Yuanhua immediately softened, nodding with a smile. "The strong man is indeed a descendant of a famous family. How many troops did you bring?"

"One hundred able-bodied militiamen."

Sun Yuanhua's smile faltered slightly. What could a hundred men accomplish? Still, the forces on Qimu Island were strong and well-equipped; these hundred must surely be elite soldiers. A hundred elites would still provide meaningful assistance.

Perhaps sensing his thoughts, Lü Zeyang added: "Every one of the hundred village militiamen under my command is equipped with a bird gun. The Lord may rest assured."

Sun Yuanhua had seen the cannons mounted on the Qimu Island ships. Moreover, after the Battle of Chengmai, he had managed to obtain diagrams of the pirates' firearms and learned they were extraordinarily lethal. Their bird guns in particular were said to be a hundred times superior to the Great Ming's own. Hearing that all these men carried such weapons, his heart eased somewhat.

Lü Zeyang then presented a letter. Upon opening it, Sun Yuanhua found only ordinary writing. He stared in confusion for a moment before understanding dawned. He called for Cheng Lingsu and asked her to decode the message first.

The opening content was unremarkable: Master Lu informed him that Lü Zeyang had been dispatched jointly to defend Laizhou, and that Qimu Island would do everything in its power to ensure the city's safety. Reading further, Sun Yuanhua's pulse quickened: the letter reported that several days prior, they had eliminated a rebel unit "invading" Huang County, killing the rebel general Mao Chenglu along with more than a dozen subordinate officers. Some two thousand rebel soldiers had perished. The severed heads of the slain officers, captured documents, seals, and banners had all been transported to Laizhou with Lü Zeyang's party. Sun Yuanhua was invited to make good use of them.

He could scarcely believe his eyes. He read the passage again from top to bottom, and only after confirming its accuracy did he manage to ask, suppressing his emotion: "Is this truly so?!"

"Not a word of exaggeration." Lü Zeyang nodded. "Everything stated in the letter is on my cart." He added, anticipating lingering doubt: "The Lord must have met General Mao..."

"I believe it!" Sun Yuanhua could no longer contain his excitement. He rose and paced several steps back and forth. This victory had come at the perfect moment! With the entire Dengzhou-Laizhou region shrouded in gloom and despair, a stirring triumph could not only rally morale but greatly improve his chances of exoneration before the court.

Manor Lord Lu was not only capable but supremely reliable. Sun Yuanhua's estimation of the Short-hairs rose dramatically. Even his impression of this impostor Deputy Regiment Commander grew favorable.

He whispered: "Such great kindness lies beyond mere words of thanks. Sun will never forget this debt!"

Lü Zeyang nodded. "The Lord speaks too generously. We wish only for the Lord's advancement and a long life of prosperity!"

Sun Yuanhua smiled slightly and said aloud: "Strong man Lü, where does your unit intend to station? Have you any particular requests? Whatever lies within my power, I shall certainly do my utmost."

Lü Zeyang thought to himself that Lu Wenyuan had judged rightly; these heads were precisely what Sun Yuanhua needed most. Accordingly, he proposed that his unit be stationed independently.

*Note: As pointed out by readers, the historical Mao Chenglu was not in Dengzhou at this time, but should have been in Dongjiang. Also, some have pointed out errors in geographical directions in the text; indeed, there are such problems, due to not checking the map carefully when writing. Thank you for pointing them out.*
