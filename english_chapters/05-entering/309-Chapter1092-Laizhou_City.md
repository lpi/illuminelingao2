# Chapter 1092 - Laizhou City

Laizhou Prefecture School, the highest institution of learning in Laizhou Prefecture, was now the temporary residence of the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou. Sun Yuanhua was stationed here.

Sun Yuanhua was currently sitting upright in the signing room, his face full of worry. The tea on the table was already ice cold.

After escaping from Dengzhou, Laizhou had become the most critical location under Sun Yuanhua's control. Whether the rebellion could be controlled within the scope of the three eastern prefectures, ensuring the rebel soldiers didn't become another uncontrollable stream of "roving bandits," and finally whether Sun Yuanhua's personal future and even life could be turned from danger to safety, all depended on whether this Laizhou City could be held.

These days, Sun Yuanhua racked his brains every day to plan city defense matters. However, things were not easy to handle.

As the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou (*Denglai Xunfu*), he was not like in the Qing Dynasty where one could hang a sign commissioning prefecture and county officials to manage the civil administration of a province; he mostly handled military affairs. Sun Yuanhua's own substantive rank was only Right Assistant Censor-in-Chief (*Qiandu Yushi*, Rank 4a), and the governor appointment title was "Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou Areas Assisting in Military Affairs". He didn't even have the concurrent title of Vice Minister of War. Compared to Yuan Keli, who also served as Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou with the title "Assisting in Expeditionary Military Affairs and Supervising Grain and Pay," his power was much smaller. In the Qing Dynasty, this would just be at the level of a Dengzhou Intendant (*Bingbei Dao*), with little say in interfering with local personnel and financial rights. He couldn't compare with Shandong Governor Yu Dacheng who had already been dismissed and arrested by the court for questioning either.

Speaking of rank alone, Laizhou Prefect Zhu Wannian was also Rank 4, same as him. If this prefect didn't get along with him, he could completely feign compliance or even ignore him.

Fortunately, Zhu Wannian was a man with a big picture view and was quite capable. Since Sun Yuanhua entered Laizhou, he followed Sun's lead in everything. Ye County Magistrate Hong also had good character and ability. Everyone worked together for a while, raising grain and pay, training village braves, and the morale of scholars and civilians in the city was boosted.

However, the defensive force inside the city was still very thin. Including original garrison troops, military households, defeated soldiers routed from the Dengzhou-Laizhou area, and newly recruited village braves, the entire garrison of Laizhou was no more than three thousand men.

Among these people, there were very few professional soldiers capable of fighting. Although there were some able-bodied military men among military households, most were vulnerable, with incomplete equipment—pure scarecrow troops. Most importantly, he lacked experienced and combat-capable generals to lead troops. Although Guard officers like Centurion Bai Zhongren were loyal and commendable, they had no combat experience after all. Therefore, Sun Yuanhua had been trying to transfer fresh troops into the city to assist in defense from everywhere.

However, so far no army had entered Laizhou for reinforcement. Although Huang Long had promised to send troops, when they would arrive was still unknown. Sun Yuanhua had been worrying about this day and night. Bad news came one after another: first Huang County fell, then news came from Jinan: Yu Dacheng had been dismissed and interrogated. Xu Congzhi, the former Shandong *Wude* Intendant, took over as Shandong Governor.

The latter news made him especially uneasy: in terms of the seriousness of the problem, Yu Dacheng's fault was far less than his own. Even Yu was dismissed and interrogated; his own end would probably not be much better.

Although Yu Dacheng couldn't be counted as his political ally, he was quite helpful after the fall of Dengzhou, and their coordination was not bad. It might not be so easy to talk with another Shandong Governor.

Sun Yuanhua knew of Xu Congzhi, but what his specific temperament was like and whether they could work together were question marks. Moreover, once the court decided to suppress, Xu Congzhi as Shandong Governor would inevitably come to Laizhou to direct strategy. There would be a problem of cooperation between the two sides.

Sun Yuanhua had been on the Liaodong front line for many years and knew the importance of colleagues very well: countless Ming officials and generals were pitted to death by colleagues.

Unfortunately, he had lost all his advisors in Laizhou now. Even the secretary master (*Shigong*) was found for him by Yu Dacheng initially. Now wanting to find someone to discuss countermeasures, he actually found no one around.

It was too late to recruit advisors, and secondly, his own safety and future were unpredictable now, so no one would be willing to be his advisor at all.

As for the officials large and small in the city and gentry scholars participating in city defense, they only cared about how to hold Laizhou and didn't care about the future of him, the Governor Sun.

Even with thousands of anxieties, he could only hide them in his heart—in this situation of internal and external difficulties, Sun Yuanhua became increasingly devout in religion. Since the Lord used the hands of Australians to rescue him from the abyss of eternal damnation, this Laizhou City and his own safety could probably also pull through.

Although he still had some wariness towards Master Lu and others, thinking over and over, the only ones who could help him now were them. Thinking of this, he braced himself to write a letter to Master Lu, asking him to make a special trip or send someone to Laizhou to discuss important matters face to face.

Among the team of servants Lu Wenyuan sent him initially, someone specially brought pigeon cages, and there was even a dedicated person for writing letters: Master Lu asked Cheng Lingsu to continue serving him; if he wanted to write letters, let Cheng Lingsu write on his behalf. Originally, Sun Yuanhua wouldn't write such confidential matters himself either—once lost, it would be a huge source of trouble.

Every time Cheng Lingsu contacted Qimu Island, she used a kind of potion. After writing, it was a piece of white paper—this wasn't rare; Sun Yuanhua knew about alum writing. But even watching Cheng Lingsu write, he couldn't understand: she didn't write characters at all, but symbols one by one.

Just as he was about to call Cheng Lingsu to write for him, Sun Yuan entered to report: "There are village braves from Lü Family Village of Pinglidian coming to defend the prefectural city..."

Sun Yuanhua waved his hand: "Let them go to Prefect Zhu first: tell them not to worry about grain and pay. I will naturally review them tomorrow." Recently Laizhou Prefecture recruited village braves everywhere, and village braves arrived from various places; he didn't pay much attention.

"Replying to the Lord, the leader of the village braves said he was entrusted by Master Lu of Qimu Island to bring a letter to the Lord..."

Sun Yuanhua's spirit was lifted, and he hurriedly said: "Quickly invite him in!"

The comer was a young man around thirty, wearing a six-panel unadorned hat padded with cotton and a cotton robe. But seeing his tall and sturdy body, sideburns faintly revealed under the hat, and the way he walked raising wind and dust, Sun Yuanhua immediately reached a conclusion: This was a "髡贼" (Baldy Thief/Short-haired Thief)!

However, as soon as the other party opened his mouth, it was a mouthful of Laizhou local dialect: "Commoner Lü Zeyang, Deputy Regiment Commander of Lü Family Village Village Braves of Pinglidian, pays respect to the Lord!" Saying this, he bowed deeply.

Just by this demeanor, Sun Yuanhua knew the other party must be a "Baldy Thief".

Only, the Lü Family Village of Pinglidian was a relatively large village locally. Although the Lü clan was not gentry locally, they were a large native clan. They had lived there for nearly a thousand years, with famous figures in every generation. Especially in the Song Dynasty, there were prime minister-level existences like Lü Mengzheng and Lü Yijian, so they were very influential locally.

How did this person assume the name of Lü Family Village? And this name aroused his suspicion: Lu Yang didn't look like this: that was clearly a handsome young lad.

"Strong man, no need for ceremony," Sun Yuanhua raised his hand, "Your surname is Lü... Hmm? Lu Yang?"

"This lowly one is Lü Zeyang (吕泽扬), not Lu Yang (吕洋)." The comer said loudly, "This commoner is a native of Laizhou!"

So they were not the same person after all. Sun Yuanhua wondered how many "Baldy Thieves" were here? This Lü Zeyang spoke authentic Laizhou dialect and claimed to be from Lü Family Village of Pinglidian; presumably, he had been lurking here for quite some days.

Unexpectedly, these thieves had quietly laid out such a situation under his eyelids! Thinking of this, he couldn't help being secretly alarmed.

But the fact that the other party came with braves showed that Manor Lord Lu was very dedicated to the safety of Laizhou. Immediately he nodded and smiled: "The strong man is indeed a descendant of a famous family. I wonder how many troops you brought this time?"

"One hundred able-bodied village braves."

Sun Yuanhua was slightly disappointed: What could one hundred people do? But the other party had strong soldiers and sturdy horses on Qimu Island; these one hundred people must be elites. Having one hundred elites entering to guard was also of some help.

Probably sensing the other party's thoughts, Lü Zeyang added: "The one hundred village braves this lowly one brought all possess bird guns. The Lord can rest assured!"

Sun Yuanhua had seen the cannons on the Qimu Island ships. Moreover, after the Battle of Chengmai, he had managed to obtain drawings of the thieves' firearms and learned that their firearms were extremely sharp, especially their bird guns, which were a hundred times better than Great Ming bird guns. Hearing they all had bird guns, he felt slightly relieved.

Subsequently, Lü Zeyang presented a letter to Sun Yuanhua. Opening it, he saw ordinary words on the letter. After being stunned for a moment, he immediately understood. He instructed someone to call Cheng Lingsu and asked her to decode the letter first.

The beginning content of the letter was nothing special: first telling him that dispatching Lü Zeyang this time was to jointly defend Laizhou, and the Qimu Island side would definitely strive to ensure Laizhou's safety; looking down, Sun Yuanhua's eyelid jumped: the letter said that a few days ago they had eliminated a group of rebel troops "invading" Huang County, killing rebel general Mao Chenglu and more than a dozen others below him. Another two thousand rebel soldiers were killed. The heads of major generals killed, captured documents, seals, and banners had been transported to Laizhou with Lü Zeyang. He was asked to make good use of them.

Sun Yuanhua couldn't believe his eyes. He couldn't help but read it carefully from top to bottom again. Only after confirming it was correct did he ask, suppressing his emotion: "Is this true?!"

"Absolutely no lies." Lü Zeyang nodded, "What is stated in the letter is on my cart..." He added, fearing the other party wouldn't believe: "Lord must have met General Mao..."

"I trust it!" Sun Yuanhua could no longer suppress his excitement, getting up and pacing back and forth for several steps: This victory came too timely! At present, the Dengzhou-Laizhou area was full of gloom and mist. A beautiful victory could not only boost morale but also greatly increase his chances of exoneration in the court.

Manor Lord Lu was not only capable but also extremely trustworthy. Sun Yuanhua's perception of the "Baldy Thieves" rose greatly. Even his impression of this impostor Deputy Regiment Commander Lü was also very favorable.

He whispered: "Great kindness needs no words of thanks. Sun will never forget your benefits!"

Lü Zeyang nodded: "Lord Sun speaks too heavily. We only wish the Lord step by step promotion and longevity of a hundred years!"

Sun Yuanhua smiled slightly and said loudly: "Strong man Lü, where does your unit intend to station? Do you have any requests? As long as this student can do it, I will definitely do my best."

Lü Zeyang thought Lu Wenyuan was indeed right; these heads were indeed what Sun Yuanhua needed most. So he proposed to be stationed independently.

*Note: As pointed out by readers, the historical Mao Chenglu was not in Dengzhou at this time, but should have been in Dongjiang. Also, some have pointed out errors in geographical directions in the text; indeed, there are such problems, due to not checking the map carefully when writing. Thank you for pointing them out.*
