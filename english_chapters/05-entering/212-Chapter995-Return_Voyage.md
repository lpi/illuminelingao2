# Chapter 995 Return Voyage

To expand influence, Ping Qiusheng also hosted a banquet for various merchants locally—Chinese and Japanese without exception. His purpose was to promote Australian goods—procurement required bringing out sufficient trade goods.

Besides the Senate's traditional export commodities, this time Ping Qiusheng also brought new export goods: Runshitang Pharmacy's Plague-Averting Powder and Zhuge Marching Powder.

After Runshitang Pharmacy's brand-new pharmaceutical factory went into production, output of all proprietary Chinese medicines increased dozens of times. Plague-Averting Powder and Zhuge Marching Powder, as their main products for sale and personal use in the South China region, had for the first time inventory exceeding the current month's sales, and the inventory quantity was continuously increasing, urgently needing to be dumped. Si Kaide judged that besides summer demand in the South China and Jiangnan regions, the year-round hot and humid North and South Vietnam, Siam, Cambodia, and Burma in subtropical and tropical zones would all be interested in these heat-relief medicines. European colonizers in Southeast Asia could use them too. Market prospects were very broad.

Ping Qiusheng brought several dozen cases of these two medicines this time, distributing samples to guests at the banquet. Actually, these two medicines were already sold in small quantities in Thonburi. Because of their remarkable efficacy, they already had a decent reputation. Only the price was very expensive—merchants had wholesaled and transported them from Guangzhou.

Now that this commodity could be sold directly here, the retail price had also fallen by more than two-thirds. This immediately caused a shock in the local business community. Shop owners of many large Chinese merchant shops actively proposed to become agents for Runshitang Pharmacy.

But Ping Qiusheng was unwilling to hand over agency rights. Besides the goods brought being cash on delivery, he required all shops interested in selling Runshitang Pharmacy products to sign ordering contracts. Runshitang would supply local merchants according to the figures on the contracts.

Based on each shop's ordering quantity and shipment status, then consider which one to grant Runshitang Pharmacy agency rights. This approach was taught to him by Si Kaide.

Si Kaide also planned to implement a prepaid deposit system for agents after both sides' cooperation established a certain degree of credibility.

This was very rare in commercial trade at that time. In commercial trade then, not to mention prepaying for goods, even cash on delivery was extremely rare. Goods first, payment later was most common, with long payment terms, serious capital occupation, and high ratio of bad debts—the notion that 17th-century commercial ethics were better than the 21st century, Si Kaide considered pure nonsense. Whether counterfeiting, overdue payments, or reneging on debts and fleeing—what the 21st century had, the 17th century had it all.

Murasaki Shūji scratched his disheveled hair. His hair was carelessly tied with straw rope; with his scratching, straw chips and dandruff flew down from his head like snowflakes.

After scratching enough and feeling more comfortable, he stood up, gave a big yawn, kissed the cross hanging around his neck, and made the sign of the cross.

Murasaki's height, like most Japanese men of this era, was at most slightly over 1.5 meters—short and stocky, with a typical Chōshū facial type, so his body hair was much less than the Satsuma type. He looked fairly handsome, just yellow-faced and thin, looking malnourished.

He wore a samurai vest—the name sounded grand, but it was actually just several pieces of cloth and silk scraps tied to his body with straw rope. His lower body had no trousers; his only "garment" was a new loincloth—the last remnant of several bolts of Nanjing cloth he got as war booty when following Lord Yamada Nagamasa to fight in Ligor for the Siamese King last year.

Despite being barely clothed, he wore broken armor plates on his chest and back. Although the area was just barely enough to cover the front and back chest, many of the hemp threads connecting the armor plates had broken and been reconnected with fine hemp rope. The workmanship was poor, and the armor plates were crooked.

On his feet was a pair of straw sandals. His left hand tightly gripped an elm wood sword scabbard containing a tachi; a wakizashi was stuck in his waist. This appearance was exactly like a down-and-out masterless wild samurai, a rōnin.

Murasaki Shūji was indeed a rōnin. He was originally a low-ranking samurai of the Tosa Domain. Because he was a Christian, he was forced to flee abroad. He had drifted around Southeast Asia for seven or eight years.

During these seven or eight years, he had been living as a mercenary, sometimes charging at the front, sometimes drowsily guarding some trading post or fortress for years on end.

A few years ago, he joined the Japanese Volunteer Corps. Life was quite carefree. But ever since Lord Yamada died inexplicably in Ligor last year, this life came to an abrupt end.

Although as a lower samurai of the Volunteer Corps he knew little about the matters above, rumors everywhere and the subsequent sudden Siamese looting of Japanese merchant towns made him feel Lord Yamada's death was very suspicious.

Suspicious or not, it had little to do with him. His relationship with Lord Yamada was only that of employer and employee, without any "sentiment." So he also had no thoughts of risking his life for revenge or getting to the bottom of things. It was just that subsequent developments made him, a Japanese person, feel a great crisis.

Everywhere rumors were spreading: the Divine King wanted to completely expel and exterminate the Japanese. Many who had joined the Volunteer Corps had already fled. Many Japanese merchants and craftsmen also chose to leave—many went to Cambodia, some to Vietnam or other places. Murasaki also wanted to flee, but he was penniless. Without the Divine King coming to kill him, he would starve to death on the road himself. Here in Thonburi, at least scrounging a meal was easy—rice here was worthless.

Murasaki Shūji lived day by day in this dilemma, trembling with fear—afraid that one day he would be killed by the Thai people before he could confess.

He wandered aimlessly on the street, looking to see if any familiar Japanese or Chinese shops were serving breakfast where he could get a bowl of rice to eat.

While idling, he suddenly saw the owner of a familiar Japanese shop, carrying large and small bundles, walking laboriously. One look told Murasaki another merchant was going to flee back home. He couldn't help feeling a wave of sadness: at least others had the ability to flee. For him to flee—first, he had no money; second, returning to Japan carried great risk. The Shogunate was merciless to Christians; if things went wrong, he'd end up on a cross.

Unexpectedly, he got new information from this Japanese merchant. The Australian ships that arrived more than half a month ago were now recruiting Japanese people.

According to Ping Qiusheng's orders, information was spread throughout Thonburi: Any Great Ming and Japanese overseas residents willing to leave Siam for Great Ming or Japan would be given passage convenience by the fleet, charging only a small fare. Those who couldn't afford the fare could ride free, but must serve the Australians in Lingao for several months to repay the fare. Those without a suitable destination could also serve the Australians.

For all overseas residents willing to serve the Australians, the Senate guaranteed sufficient wages and good living conditions. Upon completion of their service term, they could freely go to any place.

This news received an enthusiastic response. Many small merchants, seeing the current Siamese situation seemed likely to become chaotic, prepared to return home one after another. As for Japanese overseas residents, especially Yamada Nagamasa's subordinates, they were originally living in fear. Now with an opportunity to escape, why not?

These days, the Southeast Asia Company traded goods here. Transactions were very fair; they didn't harass local residents. Moreover, seeing their ships sturdy and cannons sharp, voyage safety should be guaranteed.

Because Japanese overseas residents coming to board kept arriving—many from the interior who requested local compatriots to petition after getting the news, asking the fleet to wait a few more days—Ping Qiusheng ultimately stayed another week before officially setting sail. During this time, Ping Qiusheng repeatedly declined local villagers' requests to have their wives entertain the Australian sea merchants, which made both the pirate-originated sailors and local villagers feel quite regretful.

Finally, the fleet loaded with rice and potash salt ore, plus forty-odd Chinese merchants and more than three hundred Japanese Volunteer Corps members, set off grandly on the return journey. Because there were too many people, many Japanese Volunteer Corps members who couldn't afford the fare slept on deck. Murasaki was one of those sleeping on deck. He wrapped himself in an old fishing net obtained from who-knows-where, his two swords carefully bundled with straw and carried on his back—this was his only property and the tool he depended on for survival.

After the fleet returned to Lingao, Chinese merchants purchased Great Wave Shipping tickets locally and returned to Guangdong. Of course, during this time they also inevitably conducted some inspection and touring locally. After all, the fame of the Australians and Lingao was thunderously renowned. Everyone wanted to personally see if there were new opportunities here.

As for the Japanese, except for a few merchants, almost every one was penniless—even if some could afford the fare to Guangdong or Fujian and living expenses while waiting for return ships, most weren't willing to return home just like that. They originally came to Southeast Asia hoping to escape impoverished domestic life. Now returning to Japan empty-handed meant continuing to live in poverty. Moreover, many were Christians; returning home carried great risk. So without much effort, most Japanese signed agreements to serve the Australians.

A total of 290 people chose to serve the Australians. They were immediately sent to the quarantine camp. After the quarantine period ended, this batch of Japanese Volunteer Corps would be organized into auxiliary units, serving as security forces for landing in Taiwan and Jeju Island, and in the future as guides for Japan.

Ping Qiusheng's Southeast Asia voyage achieved great success. Large quantities of rice and the trade agreements reached brought him high prestige. Wu De, at his report meeting, smiled broadly while vigorously patting his shoulder, making Senator Ping howl.

Obviously, obtaining stable rice supplies from Siam was possible—the disadvantage was it wasn't as close as from Vietnam, and summer had many typhoons, making the Siam route dangerous. But by October, they could continuously obtain food supplies from Siam. For the next three or four months' grain—including fixed consumption and expected consumption—the Planning Bureau's inventory was still sufficient to cover.
