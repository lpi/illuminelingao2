# Chapter 1123 - Feng Zongze

After leaving Liu Fuqing's office, he went to the clinic. Looking through the window, only Kim O-sun remained inside—she had stabilized overnight, and the ship to take her to Lingao would arrive in two days.

The blood typing and transfusion had been attempted after all. Though the nurse herself hadn't been confident, fortunately both typing and transfusion succeeded. Feng Zongze was very worried—the blood type test relied on horse serum imported from the old timeline, and there were only a few bottles. If one went bad, who knew if it had gone bad due to improper storage. This was a wild experiment.

Kim O-sun had regained consciousness. When she learned her brother had died, the girl didn't shed a tear. After a long silence, she said: "For the Committee. For the Officials. For the People." though her voice was weak and hoarse, there was something indescribably stirring about the way she said it.

Her burnt hands, bandaged like two white clubs, rested at her sides. Feng Zongze didn't know if this girl's hands could be saved. If they really had to be amputated...

"If it really comes to amputation, worst case I'll just take her in and look after her for the rest of her life."

This tasteless joke Feng Zongze told himself didn't make him feel much better. Because he thought again of Pak Deokhwan and the dark forces behind him. His earlier indecisiveness hadn't been weakness. First, he really didn't want to start a bloodbath in a place he'd been managing for quite some time. Once the killing started, it would be like issuing a weakened version of an "extermination order" on his own territory—bringing Jeju a brief "period of pain." And launching a major purge of collaborators he'd personally promoted would seriously damage his prestige in the Committee.

Launching a bloodbath in his own jurisdiction would undoubtedly invite the Executive Committee to question his administrative abilities—far more serious than being criticized within the Committee. After all, the Executive Committee held administrative power.

As soon as the Jeju incident broke, Feng Zongze could already imagine how those soy-sauce-party members in the Committee would pile on. If they held one of those so-called hearings, the best evaluation he could expect would be: negligence, poor judgment of character, complacency, allowing collaborators who'd cost considerable training investment to be corrupted, turning a blind eye to hostile activities... The worst would probably be incompetence and dereliction of duty.

The Leizhou Sugar Industry and Guangzhou Station incidents weren't that long ago. Though the nature was somewhat different this time, the stay-at-home soy-sauce Committee members wouldn't care whether you were working yourself to death for the Committee abroad. In their eyes, external posting equaled perks, equaled regional fiefdoms!

Screw up once on this kind of issue and recovery would be difficult—especially for a soy-sauce Committee member like himself with no factional backing but wielding "significant power." Especially given the work team massacre incident in Danzhou, which had left several Committee members thoroughly humiliated.

The thought of possibly sitting in that lone chair in the middle of the horseshoe-shaped table while being "roasted" sent chills down Feng Zongze's spine.

"Those idiots!" he cursed silently. "All you know is killing—what's the point! Don't you know that people are precious resources?"

But a major purge was also a way to rebuild his image and silence critics...

"Jeju is about to have a bloodbath? All because someone defied heaven? Exactly right!" At this thought, Feng Zongze's eyes lit up. The rage inside him could no longer be suppressed.

Though blood for blood wasn't the best solution to the current "crisis," it was the least bad option. He understood that the island's situation was far from deteriorating to the point requiring a full military purge. But considering the Committee back in Lingao, he decided to act decisively—the scale and momentum could be ramped up.

The Kim siblings' story had to be written up extensively! That was the biggest highlight of the 3.20 disturbance! As they say, turn a bad thing into a good thing...

To date, no case under Committee rule had provided such a perfect exemplar of the "new morality" for propaganda purposes. Though the Cuigang martyrs' cemetery in Lingao and the "Martyrs' Memorial Park" in Sanya already held many naturalized citizens who'd died in the line of duty, none had the powerful emotional impact of Kim Yuk-sun.

He would personally compile the materials on the Kim siblings—made as detailed as possible.

The cigar's ember glowed intermittently through the smoke as Feng Zongze's gaze fell on his desk: *Qiming Star* and *Weekly Dynamics*.

Last night, he'd carefully studied every article in them. *Qiming Star* was the Committee's theoretical journal; *Weekly Dynamics* was a compilation of the week's Committee news. Reading them together was very helpful for grasping the latest Committee dynamics.

He reviewed the recent events once more. From the Executive Committee's perspective, the 3.20 disturbance really wasn't that significant.

First, the command group had detected it and prepared beforehand. Second, the uprising was swiftly suppressed with negligible losses. Third, this incident provided an opportunity to purge the local major power, acquiring large numbers of cattle and horses—enough to shut up the Planning Committee and Executive Committee.

Though Jeju's cattle and horses had always been in their pocket, what might have required buyout costs and economic measures now became war booty requiring not a penny—all while fully embodying the spirit of "rule of law."

Combining the telegram from the Executive Committee with various information, the Executive Committee was both satisfied and dissatisfied with his performance on Jeju. But the overall assessment was favorable—otherwise his Forward Committee ranking wouldn't have dropped only one position. And they'd given a very presentable reason: "Jeju Island's current priority shall be implementing island-wide security enforcement."

Following this directive's spirit, he could easily have been ranked below Nangong Wudi. But dropping only to behind Xue Ziliang meant what? The Executive Committee was generally satisfied with his civil administration work on Jeju.

Where was the Executive Committee's dissatisfaction? Obviously, "localism." Including the telegram's instructions on Jeju's economic development. Feng Zongze thought: the two articles in *Qiming Star* were actually warnings to externally-posted Committee members.

At this realization, everything became clear. Tonight he'd write a thick report. He picked up the bell on his desk and rang it. His life secretary came in.

"Tell the guards I'm going out."

"Where to, sir?" the life secretary asked.

"To the Political Security Bureau."

Liu Fuqing stood hunched before Feng Zongze—though he'd tried hard to learn the "Australian" posture of his young colleagues, head high and chest out, his years as a minor Ming bureaucrat had bent his spine into this shape.

"Has Pak Deokhwan confessed?" he asked.

"He's confessed everything," Liu Fuqing said. Pak Deokhwan had collapsed the moment he was brought into the Political Security office, crying and wailing as he confessed everything. He'd knelt on the ground, sobbing that he "never betrayed the Officials," swearing "heaven and earth could bear witness."

"Do you believe he's telling the truth?"

"I believe he's telling the truth." Liu Fuqing knew the Officials didn't like word games—one is one, two is two. The traditional pettifogging of clerks didn't work with them.

He then produced the confession materials and handed them to Feng Zongze. Feng Zongze waved them away: "Just give me the summary."

Liu Fuqing briefly summarized Pak Deokhwan's confessed financial problems, including the search results from his residence—by local standards, the total value of bribes and stolen goods was actually modest. Feng Zongze listened expressionlessly.

As soon as Liu Fuqing finished, Feng Zongze asked: "Any leads connecting him to the 3.15 and 3.20 cases?"

"Report: as of now, we haven't found evidence implicating him in those two cases. However, his household servant Jang Seong-seol is under serious suspicion—ostensibly she was given to Pak Deokhwan by Huang Yunyu, but we've discovered she's actually Cho Myeong-gwi's bondservant. So we're interrogating her. From her, we should be able to obtain evidence of whether Pak Deokhwan participated in these two conspiracies."

"You've done excellent work." Feng Zongze nodded. The fact that Pak Deokhwan wasn't involved in the conspiracy was greatly reassuring. Any shred of evidence implicating him would have been very damaging. Political Security Bureau operated under direct vertical leadership; he couldn't influence the relevant materials.

This was also good, he thought. Having Political Security Bureau vouch for Pak Deokhwan would be more convincing than simply issuing a "conclusion" himself. Pak Deokhwan being a corrupt official was better than him being a "counter-revolutionary."

"What about Pak Deokmeng?" He remembered Pak Deokhwan's brother.

"We've concluded our examination of him—the conclusion is non-participation. He's under 24-hour surveillance for now."

Feng Zongze said nothing more and stood up to leave. Liu Fuqing remembered something and reported:

"Pak Deokhwan says he hopes to meet with you, sir—"

Feng Zongze felt an almost painful twinge. He hesitated, then said: "No."
