# Chapter 801 - The Sanya Militia

For this plan, Ji Runzhi had labored through the entire New Year holiday. To reduce his own workload, he assigned the task of drawing up the planning maps to his apprentices, Ji Yuan and Ji Shu. Under his instruction, the two children had already learned how to use drafting instruments. As top students who had obtained their Grade-B diplomas within a year, their learning ability was exceptional—they picked up practical skills almost instantly.

However, talents cultivated this way would, in the long run, amount to nothing more than "skilled workers." They lacked independent thinking and the ability to grasp the big picture, useful only for stopgap purposes. They clearly weren't qualified to inherit his mantle. Ji Runzhi decided that once Sanya's construction was on track, he would start from scratch, beginning with the most fundamental mathematics, geography, and physics, then gradually advancing into architecture and urban planning.

"Time to wrap up!" Ji Runzhi noticed the sun had begun to sink toward the horizon. He glanced at his watch—past four o'clock. Winter days were short, and lingering in the field after dark meant groping one's way home. Even under a bright moon, the light was still too dim for modern people accustomed to walking under streetlamps. One misstep into a ditch or slope could result in a nasty fall.

Ji Runzhi led his apprentices on the road home. He first returned to Tiandu Town, where he would catch the small train to Yulin Fort.

On the Tiandu Town platform, he encountered Xi Yazhou. Xi was dressed in a combat uniform with a steel helmet on his head, the helmet topped with a ring of branches and leaves—not for camouflage, but for shade. Sanya's winter sun was still quite fierce.

Xi Yazhou stood on the platform, backed by a column of laborers lined up in neat formation, wearing rattan safety helmets and work clothes. Despite their uniforms being stained black with sweat and dust, the workers held their second-generation standard spears with spirited bearing.

"...Today's formation and marching drill was excellent!" Xi Yazhou rested his hand on his command saber. "You've trained up your spirit and your courage! You now have the bearing that the Council's militia should have!..."

The drill concluded with the militia shouting three times in unison: "For the Council of Elders and the People!" Ji Runzhi waited until Xi Yazhou had finished speaking and given the "Dismissed" order before walking over.

"Been drilling a lot lately?" Ji Runzhi knew that ever since the first batch of slaves had arrived, Xi Yazhou had been conducting militia training.

Xi Yazhou removed the Type 80 steel helmet from his head—the thing was dead weight, and after wearing it all afternoon his neck was sore. He stripped the branches from the helmet's camouflage net and wiped the sweat off with his towel before finally catching his breath.

"Old Wang says we'll have over ten thousand slaves here by year's end. How can we not get the militia trained up fast? A slave uprising—heh heh—that's more than we could handle."

Ever since Quark Qiong's visit, Sanya had officially made its debut before the world. News that a new commercial port existed at the southern tip of Hainan Island would spread quickly. What would follow, besides merchant ships hoping to crack open trade with China, might include Chinese and Western pirates, the Spanish authorities in Manila, both East India Companies—all of whom might attack for various reasons. After studying the situation, Xi Yazhou concluded that the greatest threats were the Spanish authorities and Zheng Zhilong and Liu Xiang. Of these three, the latter two were more dangerous. If they launched an attack, could they really hold them off with the Navy's six sub-100-ton fishery patrol boats and their muzzle-loading rifled guns that fired once every three minutes? The 8154 that had been their trump card had been recalled to Lingao.

"The Army is still more reliable," Xi Yazhou muttered to himself. But even the Army was stretched thin in terms of numbers. His available ground forces, including the Marine Platoon, amounted to no more than 400 men. He was confident he could repel any landing pirates, but once his troops concentrated for battle, they couldn't protect the various facilities scattered across the shore. If the slaves then seized the opportunity for a mass uprising, Sanya would be reduced to a smoking hellscape.

The only solution was to arm the militia. For months now, Xi Yazhou had been selecting "politically reliable, firmly committed" laborer squads and putting entire units through military rotation training. As Sanya's garrison commander, he had poured his heart and soul into this effort, even forgoing his chance to return to Lingao to stay in Sanya and train the militia.

The two of them boarded the train from Tiandu to Yulin Fort together. Though they were Elders, the train had no special luxury carriage for them. Their only distinction from the workers commuting home was that they occupied a car by themselves—still the same open-topped flatbed car.

"The workers have good discipline and organization," Xi Yazhou said, unbuttoning his uniform jacket to let the wind blow through. "A little training and they'd make excellent soldiers. Too bad we lack weapons. We've got precious few Minié rifles here. The militia have to make do with cold steel—who'd have thought we'd be running排队枪毙 and still have to do Spanish infantry squares."

"Why not apply to the General Staff for some rifles?"

"Hmph," Xi Yazhou snorted, lighting himself a cigarette. "Want one?"

"No, thanks."

"A few Minié rifles wouldn't be a problem, but the Executive Committee won't give us more," Xi Yazhou didn't want to dwell on this subject and turned to gaze at the scenery slowly receding behind them. Last time he'd cabled the General Staff on this issue, requesting 500 Minié rifles for militia training and equipment. The General Staff had replied that rifle stocks were limited. The eventual solution was to ship him 1,000 hand grenades, 100 training grenades, and 200 training rifles.

With only formation and bayonet drills, the militia could still be thrown into battle—but when the time came to pick up rifles, militia without shooting practice would only be able to make noise. Xi Yazhou had no choice but to dip into the dispatch battalion's reserve rifles, issuing them in batches so the militia could practice marksmanship.

"Could it be a manifestation of Director Wen's generation-gap theory?" Ji Runzhi said. "Keeping a technological gap between regulars and militia to ensure the regulars can suppress any militia uprising."

Though the theory of maintaining a technological gap between armed forces had never been formally proposed, it had many adherents among the Elders—to the point of being treated as gospel.

Xi Yazhou finally couldn't hold back his frustration: "Generation gap my ass! At least give the militia Brown Besses. Training with spears—that gap's too damn wide. If the enemy comes, are we supposed to have the militia form a Spanish tercio? Even Spanish tercios had harquebusiers for support. We might as well go full Macedonian phalanx."

The two got off at Yulin Fort. He Fanghuai had already returned from "inspecting defenses." Per regulations, all Elders stationed at remote posts had to take turns on duty, ensuring at least one Elder was awake at all times. Today was He Fanghuai's shift.

"Old Xi!" He Fanghuai waved the telegram in his hand. "Tomorrow the *Dajing* is bringing the bucket elevator and ore dressing equipment—we'll be shipping the first iron ore load any day now!"

"Good heavens, not a single specialist here, and they're sending equipment to install!" Ji Runzhi exclaimed. "None of the three of us knows anything about machinery."

"There'll be an Elder coming with the ship," He Fanghuai said. "Plus quite a few people." He winked at Xi Yazhou and He Fanghuai. "The female servants we commissioned the General Affairs Office to draw lots for will be arriving with the ship too."

"Hell yes, that's great news!" Xi Yazhou had been lucky in the lottery, drawing a Grade-B, so he was especially eager.

"At least there'll be someone to do laundry," He Fanghuai said. "Let's throw a drinking party tonight. Drink up everything in the care packages! Too bad there's no girl to do a striptease!"

A few days earlier, the stationed Elders had all learned from private telegrams about the Year's End banquet—the "wine pools and meat forests" and the cosplay extravaganza. The stranded personnel were green with envy—they didn't much care about the food and drink, but missing the sight of all that bare thigh felt like a real loss.

"You're on duty tonight," Xi Yazhou reminded him.

"I'll drink kvass instead," He Fanghuai said. "Actually, with my alcohol tolerance, I'm just as alert after eight beers..."

On the day before New Year's, to compensate the stationed Elders who couldn't return to Lingao for the Year's End banquet, the General Affairs Office had shipped "care packages" via Navy transport to every overseas Elder.

The care packages were wooden, resembling ammunition crates—very sturdy. Inside were many items preserved by the Planning Commission from the old timeline: one tin each of PLA-issue braised beef, luncheon meat, Western ham, and anchovy; one jar each of Sichuan pickles, Korean kimchi, Jinzhou assorted vegetables, and chili sauce produced by the Tianchu Food Factory. For a festive atmosphere, there were 500 grams of sliced and dried Ningbo New Year's cake, to be boiled or stir-fried at one's pleasure. Beverages included 4 bottles of beer, 2 bottles of rum, and 6 bottles of kvass, packed separately in specialized drink cases before being boxed. Regardless of whether the recipient smoked, everyone received one carton of "Gold Saint Ship"—the highest-grade cigarette newly developed by the Monopoly Bureau exclusively for Elders (though in truth it tasted no different from regular Saint Ship). Additionally, there was one tin each of coffee and tea, 250 grams of white sugar, and 250 grams of assorted fruit candies.

By old-timeline standards, the contents of the care packages were pitifully meager. But to the Elders, they were delicacies brimming with nostalgia. If instant noodles hadn't been completely exhausted, many Elders would have loved a few packets for old times' sake—even though the Elder's Cafeteria now made yi-fu noodles flavored with real chicken broth.

That evening, Xi Yazhou ordered the Army quartermaster to purchase several sheep from the immigrant villages settled at Anyoule and elsewhere—the Tiandihui also operated among these villages. After slaughtering the sheep, they improved the troops' rations. The best cuts were set aside for the Elders' lamb feast, supplemented with opened care-package canned goods. They washed down grilled lamb and seafood with beer, and capped the meal with a stir-fried New Year's cake with luncheon meat and spinach to celebrate the just-passed New Year.
