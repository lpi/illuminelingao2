# Chapter 1121 - Treatment

The city was under martial law under Xue Ziliang's command. Jeju City normally imposed a curfew after dark, but now large numbers of armed personnel were patrolling and conducting searches. All four gates were sealed; every household on every street locked their doors.

The disturbance inside and outside the city lasted less than an hour. The militia mobilized for this operation weren't numerous—barely three hundred in total. About a dozen had infiltrated the city to start fires. According to Huang Yunyu, Cho Myeong-gwi, and the others' plan, once the horse corrals outside caught fire and the horses panicked, the Dwarf-Crop-Heads would surely dispatch city personnel to reinforce—creating chaos that would allow them to commit arson and poisoning. They hadn't expected the force sent to burn the corrals to collapse immediately—and the militia who had intended to emerge during the urban chaos for sabotage were arrested one after another as soon as they moved, with those who resisted shot dead on the spot.

The gunfire had completely subsided. Xue Ziliang led his patrol to inspect various important locations in the city. He was particularly worried about a "camp panic" in the refugee camp—though they had riot-control infantry, it would still cause unnecessary casualties.

Though the military and civil commanders of Jeju Island weren't him, fewer casualties were still better. The Forward Committee was all in the same boat.

When patrolling to the refugee camp, he encountered Zhu Mingxia, who was wearing a stab-resistant vest and a Type 80 steel helmet, carrying an SKS rifle—looking thoroughly battle-ready.

"Any losses in the city?" he asked urgently when he saw Xue Ziliang's patrol approaching.

"None. All the bandits in the city have been captured—or killed. A city-wide search is now underway."

"Then I'll leave the city to you. I need to take some men out to check on the horse corrals." Though the forces outside the city were substantial and the local so-called "militia" would be no more than scarecrows even if four or five thousand came, the corrals housed Nick—a Committee member who deserved to have "high concern" expressed on his behalf.

Zhu Mingxia led his patrol to open the city gates and head to the corrals. By the time they arrived, the fires in the burning sheds and grassland had been extinguished. Nick was sitting in the courtyard outside his office, gripping his Glock pistol, surrounded by his apprentices. Seeing Zhu Mingxia arrive, he visibly relaxed.

"Are the corrals safe?" Zhu Mingxia asked.

"All safe. No losses except for a few wooden sheds. Some horses were startled and are being calmed down," Nick said.

He hadn't sent personnel for further searches. Nick probably felt that driving off the enemy was enough. But not dispatching small units for searches in the dead of night was reasonable.

"Unfortunately, there are casualties!" Nick sighed. "I was careless!"

When Zhu Mingxia entered the sluice house, the fire had been extinguished—the cadets had rushed in to fight the flames as soon as they spotted them. Not only was the sluice equipment that Kim O-sun had desperately protected undamaged, but the building had only suffered broken doors and windows.

Kim O-sun was unconscious. Kim Yuk-sun was already dead. The people gathered around made way when they saw Zhu Mingxia approach. He walked closer and looked: blood was everywhere on the ground, and two "militia" corpses lay there. One had his skull smashed in; the other was covered in knife wounds. Both had clearly been dead for some time.

Bloodstains spattered the handwheel and screw, with half a burnt rag still hanging from them. The crude bench had broken, stained with brain matter and blood.

Seeing a half-torn strip of cloth still clutched in Kim O-sun's blackened hand, Zhu Mingxia let out a deep breath, feeling moved. He had always maintained a utilitarian attitude toward the people of this timeline. He cared about their loyalty only so they could serve the Committee. All the political work methods and theories he used were merely "techniques" on the road to global hegemony.

Yet these two siblings had fought to the death for a simple sluice house. Such pure, magnificent loyalty touched even his heart.

A medic was bandaging Kim O-sun. He asked quietly: "How are her wounds? Is she in danger?"

---

The medic said: "She was slashed three or four times on her body—none deep—and has a stab wound on her forearm, also not serious. But she's lost excessive blood, and both hands have second-degree burns. We'll need to wait for Official Feng's examination to know the details."

"Go tell Official Feng that I said to save her at all costs. Understand?"

"Yes, I'll be sure to relay that!"

Zhu Mingxia returned to the city. Prisoners were already being brought in—interrogation was handled by Political Security Bureau personnel. He then went to check on the troop quarters. By the time he finished, dawn was breaking. But Zhu Mingxia felt no sleepiness. He splashed water on his face and went to the clinic to see Kim O-sun.

Originally, he hadn't paid much attention to this somewhat homely woman—he only knew she was the White Horse Battalion commander's daughter, very capable at her work, a promising naturalized cadre candidate. But last night's events had piqued his deep interest in her. He hoped she would survive and recover well. Such steadfast and loyal naturalized citizens were rare talents...

Clear bugle notes sounded from the city gate, followed by the "morning cannon" announcing the gates' opening. Crowds of commoners and Labor Service workers headed toward the various construction sites and workshops inside and outside the city. Fupo Army soldiers marched through the streets in neat formation, singing. The entire city district resumed its new day as if no battle had occurred.

The night's disturbance had caused negligible losses. The results weren't impressive either: over fifty "militiamen" killed or cut down, fifteen captured. Several packets of poison intended for the wells were seized. Interrogating the prisoners would undoubtedly expose all "hostile elements" in the city.

Zhu Mingxia estimated their hideouts were likely local shops. But the Political Security Bureau would determine the specifics—they weren't going anywhere. The city gates had tightened their inspections: only locals serving the Committee who held passes and Labor Service workers could freely enter and leave Jeju City. Ordinary civilians were permitted entry but not exit.

This meant Jeju Island's counter-insurgency campaign would have to begin ahead of schedule. Zhu Mingxia had originally planned to draft a plan based on the Political Consultative Conference's outcome before proceeding. Now that seemed unnecessary.

He walked into the clinic and saw Feng Zongze and several nurses busily at work. A nurse was cleaning and suturing Kim O-sun's wounds. Kim O-sun was pale, her brows furrowed, occasionally moaning softly from the disinfectant's sting.

"How is she?"

"The wounds aren't too serious..." Feng Zongze wore a white coat with sleeves rolled up high, smelling of disinfectant. "But she took quite a beating—seven slash wounds and one stab wound. The cuts aren't deep; with suturing, she'll be fine. But she's lost too much blood..." He pointed at the IV drip. "I don't have plasma here, so I can only use glucose saline. I don't know if she'll pull through."

"Her life isn't in danger, is it?"

"Hard to say. Without a blood transfusion, fifty-fifty." Feng Zongze said. "I've given her tetanus shots and antibiotics. Infection shouldn't be a problem, but..." He gestured toward her hands, which were being cleaned.

"Second-degree burns on both hands—I can't treat that." Feng Zongze said. "It may even require skin grafts. That can only be done at the General Hospital in Lingao..."

"Then transfer her as soon as possible. For the blood—can we arrange on-site blood donation?"

Feng Zongze hesitated: "Honestly, I'm not a doctor. Just a pharmacist. I can't handle surgical matters—and there's the blood type issue. We don't know her blood type."

"Can the nurses test for it? Should be pretty simple, right?"

"True, but the nurses don't seem confident about blood typing..."

Zhu Mingxia knew these nurses were trainees on rotation. Hesitating at a juncture where mistakes could be fatal was natural. But the situation probably couldn't wait for experienced nurses to be dispatched. He said: "First send a message to Shandong by telegram to dispatch a special ship bringing Dr. Xie. If that can't wait, have them try—we must save her life."

Feng Zongze nodded gravely: "I'll do my best. As soon as she's stable, we'll send a ship to take her to Lingao."

Zhu Mingxia was leaving the ward when he suddenly heard muffled sobbing. Turning, he saw a man's figure crouched in a corner of the courtyard, shoulders heaving. He knew it was Kim Yongjoo. His own heart ached. He wanted to say something but didn't know what, so he quietly slipped away.
