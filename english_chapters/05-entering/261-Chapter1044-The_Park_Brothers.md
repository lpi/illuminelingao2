# Chapter 1044: The Park Brothers

The Park brothers, with their bellies perfectly round from eating, managed to stagger home by leaning against the walls. They were official slaves of the Government Office (*Gammyeong*) and lived right inside Jeju City.

The two Park brothers were originally from a family of "Middle People" (*Jungin*). Their father had once served as a minor military officer in the Palace Stables. Seven years ago, the current King launched a coup to depose Gwanghaegun—historically known as the "Injo Restoration"—and the Park family was implicated. Their grandfather and father were beheaded, while the women and children were demoted to official slaves (*gwan-nobi*) and exiled to Jeju Island.

On the way, the second-generation mistress of the Park family died unable to bear the hardships of the journey. Only the two Park brothers were left, struggling to reach Jeju Island, where they barely grew up amidst hunger, cold, and hard labor.

Their so-called home was merely a short, small hut built with large quantities of Jeju's specialty volcanic rocks. The gaps between the stones were filled with yellow mud mixed with hay. The roof was covered with thick thatch. There was no floor inside, only bare earth. Wooden boards placed in the corner served as beds, covered with hay. In the middle of the house was an earthen hearth (*bod*).

The house was newly built and very damp. There was a faint glow of fire in the hearth—starting a fire was troublesome, so ordinary commoners would leave some embers in the stove covered with ash. Consequently, there was a smell of smoke in the room.

If a person from the 21st century walked in, they wouldn't be able to stay for even a minute, but for the poor commoners of that time, this was their daily dwelling.

Even such a crude house was built by the Park brothers with great difficulty. They used copper coins saved over many years to bribe a petty clerk to obtain a piece of government land permitted for building. They carried stones, mixed yellow mud, and cut grass themselves, building it bit by bit like swallows building a nest during their free time from raising horses and farming for the government office. With their own house, they no longer had to live in the large longhouse dormitory for official slaves in the government compound. Only then did Park Deok-hwan have a possibility of getting married. Even as official slaves, they couldn't get married in a collective dormitory. As the elder brother, Park Deok-hwan was already twenty this year, an out-and-out older youth in ancient society. Moreover, there was the entrustment of their elders: their grandmother and mother, who died on the road to exile, had both urged them to "carry on the family line," even if they were reduced to official slaves.

Although the whereabouts of Park Deok-hwan's wife were still unknown, Park Deok-hwan was a man of foresight: a wife would be none other than an official maidservant in the government office. Men should marry when they grow up, and women should marry when they grow up. As long as there was a house, a suitable wife could always be found.

The Park brothers sat down heavily on the straw mats, belching—this was the fullest and best meal they had eaten in over a year. Years of constant famine meant days of eating their fill could be counted on one hand. Probably because of fleas or something similar, the two scratched vigorously, discussing Park Deok-hwan's marriage while scratching.

Official slaves were equivalent to state slaves. However, apart from not being allowed to leave their assigned government office and having to complete assigned work on time, there were no restrictions on their personal lives: marrying and having children were at their convenience, as long as they submitted a report to the government office—anyway, the children of official slaves were also lowborn (*cheonmin*) and would continue to serve the state.

The two discussed potential wife candidates one by one: there were many official maidservants in the government office. There had been famines for the past ten years or so, and every family lacked enough grain. Official slave families with daughters all wanted to marry them off as soon as possible to save food rations, so there was plenty of room for choice. But slightly prettier women were out of their reach: officials at all levels had long regarded them as forbidden fruit.

"...How about Jo Seong-i? Her ancestors were originally *Yangban*..." Park Deok-hwan was different from his brother; he was already thirteen when exiled and had clear memories of everything in his past home, so he cared about the original status of the official maidservants.

"I heard she's in poor health and probably can't work. Ancestors being *Yangban* can't be eaten as food—besides, isn't she still an official maidservant just the same?" Although Park Deok-maeng was only fourteen, he spoke with the air of an old man and had become very worldly.

"What about Kim O-sun?"

"Too ugly—even Master Liang from the Household Division, who isn't picky about anything, won't look at her. Brother, do you really want to marry her?" Park Deok-maeng said discontentedly. Although it was his brother getting married, having a sister-in-law who looked too grotesque would make the younger brother lose face too.

Master Liang, the Household Division clerk, was a lecherous man, insatiable when it came to women. Naturally, official maidservants with beauty wouldn't fall to him, but ordinary ones, as long as their appearance was slightly regular, would be called by him to "accompany drinking."

"Turn off the lights..." Park Deok-hwan was about to say "it's all the same when the lights are out," but thinking of Kim O-sun's appearance, he couldn't help shivering.

They then discussed several families' daughters, even including young widows in their calculations. Park Deok-maeng suddenly said:

"What do you think of Yi Man-hui?"

"She is a daughter of Middle People, and her crime is somewhat disgraceful..." Park Deok-hwan hesitated. Yi Man-hui had just been exiled to the island recently. It was said she had illicit relations with someone while unmarried, which was extremely scandalous. However, some said this charge was fabricated to strike at Yi Man-hui's family—her family belonged to the Southerners faction (*Namin*), which was under attack by the Westerners faction (*Seoin*).

Factional struggles in the Joseon Dynasty were extremely fierce and continued for hundreds of years. The severity of the factional struggles was not inferior to the Ming Dynasty, and perhaps even surpassed it—but impressively, such intense internal strife did not lead to the fall of the country, which was perhaps a manifestation of the superiority of *Sadae* (Serving the Great) ideology. Many of the official slaves on Jeju Island came from the losers and victims of political struggles.

"Big Brother, what Middle People? Here, she is an official slave just like us—speaking of daughters of Middle People, you and I are sons of Middle People too," said Park Deok-maeng.

"That's true; once here, we are all lowborn." Park Deok-hwan sighed endlessly—he was already a sensible teenager who had studied when the great change happened to his family. Sometimes recalling the scene of the family living together back then, he always felt like it was a dream.

"Since we got a lot of food with great difficulty today, let's go pay respects to our elders," Park Deok-hwan said.

Their father and grandfather died on the execution ground in the capital, while their grandmother and mother died on the road. Their bodies were hastily buried in unknown places, becoming lonely ghosts. This was the matter that always made Park Deok-hwan most uneasy. He was someone who had read books and was deeply influenced by Confucian ideas of filial piety. Therefore, after settling down slightly in Jeju and being able to barely survive with his brother, he secretly made spirit tablets. On death anniversaries and festivals, he would take them to the wild to offer sacrifice facing north with clear water and simple food.

Having obtained rare good food today, he also wanted to fulfill his filial thoughts.

The city gates of Jeju were already closed, but Jeju City was large, with many vacant lots and wastelands inside. Holding the items, the brothers went to a secluded place by the city wall.

This area near the city wall was almost entirely vegetable gardens and woods, with only occasional small thatched huts, presenting a pastoral scene. The brothers walked along a small path up a mound by the city wall. There was a grove on the mound, a very quiet and hidden place. The Park brothers usually paid respects to their ancestors here.

Just as the two set down the offerings, several "monsters" colorful all over (camouflaged) suddenly jumped out from the bushes, instantly scaring the Park brothers half to death. Before Park Deok-hwan could scream, his mouth and nose were covered, and he was dragged to the ground, his joints locked so he couldn't move. Park Deok-maeng was knocked unconscious directly.

Xue Ziliang whistled softly and looked at these two poor kids—poverty is a universal language, irrespective of ethnicity and borders. Just looking at their clothes and haggard complexions was enough to know.

"You go interrogate them." Xue Ziliang gestured to order a soldier under him. This person was not from the Special Reconnaissance Detachment but an agent from the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, a Korean translator specially trained for the Jeju Island landing operation.

Xue Ziliang stopped looking at these two prisoners: from arriving at Biyangdo by boat to walking here, they had captured prisoners several times along the way. Most were such poor commoners: "clothed in rags and with insufficient food" was a very appropriate adjective to use on them, and these two were no exception.

Entering Jeju Island was even easier than he imagined. Although the city gates were closed when they arrived at the city. Xue Ziliang was quite shocked when he saw the city wall—this counts as a city wall?

Xue Ziliang had been stationed in South Korea for a period of time. But as an American, he was not interested in the history and culture of the Cosmic Empire; his usual pastimes were mainly focused on the lower body. He rarely visited historical sites and paid little attention even when he saw them. When the genuine original city wall appeared before his eyes, he was immediately shocked!

Damn, this is a city wall?!

The city wall built of volcanic rocks looked quite regular—square and upright, but the height of this city wall seemed wrong no matter how you looked at it. Of course, Xue Ziliang couldn't see any city walls in the United States, but having been in Hainan for so long, he had seen quite a few city walls in Hainan. This city wall of Jeju could at best be counted as a "boundary wall"—and one with low anti-theft standards at that.

He visually estimated from outside the city that the wall was less than 4 meters high—leaving that aside, because with the use of firearms at the time, walls becoming lower and thicker was a trend, but there were unexpectedly no defensive facilities on the entire city wall. Even the battlements and parapets found on the walls of the most desolate and backward small county towns in Hainan were completely absent here. Through his telescope, he clearly saw the soldiers standing on top exposed from the waist up.

Not to mention rifles, even bows and arrows could easily kill the defenders and suppress the top of the wall. As for facilities like enemy towers (*mamian* / projecting towers) and watchtowers common in general city defense fortifications, none existed on the walls of Jeju City.

For such a city, there was no need for any Special Reconnaissance Detachment, no need for cannons, not even the Fubo Army. A labor squadron holding spears and machetes, climbing the wall with ladders and ropes, could break through with one charge.

Xue Ziliang didn't know that less than forty years ago, in the late 25th year of Wanli (1597), a Ming general aiding Korea had said the following to Joseon officials:

"The commander-in-chief said, the fortresses of our country are like child's play." (*Veritable Records of King Seonjo*, Vol. 88). This was the evaluation of Korean town wall defenses by Ming generals after the Imjin War.
