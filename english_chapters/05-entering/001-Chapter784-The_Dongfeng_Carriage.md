# Chapter 784 – The Dongfeng Carriage

A new model of single-horse two-wheeled carriage trotted along the road from Bairen to Piye Mountain. This was the vehicle factory's latest product—a light two-wheeled carriage called "Dongfeng," modeled after the 1860s Hensomicab. Single-driver, two-seater. The two-wheeled design eliminated the front undercarriage, simplifying the body. It was equipped with single-axle 60-inch 16-spoke hardwood wheels, a steel axle, and ball bearings. Leaf-spring suspension, iron-rod frame, and wooden body. It came with a folding canopy in two configurations: luxury sheepskin or cowhide, and standard oilcloth. It also had fixed carriage lamps and a foot-pedal bell.

The main reason for building the Dongfeng prototype was that someone wanted to market carriages as luxury goods. Another reason was that some elders had grown tired of cycling to work and wanted a carriage as a "company car"—to show off a bit.

Li Chiqi knew that using carriages as "company cars" was out of the question at this stage. Take the most basic factor—horses: Nik wouldn't let them have even one. Horses were currently "second masters" in Lingao after the elders themselves. Unless requisitioned for military or agricultural use, horses were strictly off-limits. As for the plans of Si Kaide, Hong Huangnan, and others to sell flashy carriages to mainland Chinese like Gao Ju as suckers—whether that market even existed was uncertain. But Li Chiqi, bored from building nothing but "Purple Lightning" aircraft, artillery carts, and ox-carts, feigned enthusiasm to accept the trial-manufacturing task. At worst, it could be given to Guo Yi, who was about to return to Guangzhou.

In the end, the vehicle factory produced a carriage under the guidance of Hong Huangnan—former 4S-dealer manager, now Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Logistics Command. Hong Huangnan was passionate about horse-drawn carriages; he had collected countless pictures and materials, including rare line drawings of various carriage models. The Dongfeng's manufacture relied mainly on his data.

Although Hong Huangnan insisted on calling it "Benz," Li Chiqi thought that name should be reserved for a future luxury model. So, following the "Hongqi" (Red Flag) branding, he called it "Dongfeng" (East Wind).

"Shouldn't 'Dongfeng' be for ox-carts or heavy-duty wagons?" Hong Huangnan, looking at the handmade "Dongfeng" in the workshop, expressed confusion.

"China's first sedan was also called Dongfeng—hand-beaten together. Let's use the name for good luck."

"Might as well call it 'Geely' (Luck)," Hong Huangnan grumbled.

"Whatever we call it, the carriage looks great," Li Chiqi said sincerely. "Let's take it for a spin! Test drive!"

"We need to find a horse first."

Currently, all horses and donkeys in Lingao were at the Gaoshanling Ranch—military horses included. After training, they had to be returned immediately. That was Nik's rule, to ensure proper care and maximum breeding. Fortunately, Hong Huangnan knew a batch of captured horses from Qiongshan was en route to Gaoshanling. He used his authority to intercept one, promising to deliver it himself.

These were Mongolian horses, very docile. After Li Chiqi hitched the horse and found a driver, the two rode off toward Piye Mountain.

The road from Bairen to Piye Mountain was now paved and fully equipped. The carriage ran smoothly over the cinder surface, with no jolting. This gave Hong Huangnan hope for mass production—he planned to empty Guangdong gentry's pockets with these.

Three to four kilometers west of Bairen City, they encountered the first checkpoint. Chevaux-de-frise blocked the road; a guardhouse and sentries stood watch. The entire Gaoshanling area was now designated a "Green Zone" under direct House control. All native villages except for Damei Village, which the elders had built themselves, had been relocated. Natives and naturalized citizens couldn't enter without a specially issued "Green Zone Pass." A company of the Garrison Battalion was exclusively responsible for guarding the area.

Their carriage passed the first checkpoint, then a second, then a third. On the road and hillsides, patrolling soldiers were visible at intervals.

"This place is heavily guarded!" Hong Huangnan exclaimed. "Even more than around Bairen City!" It was his first time penetrating deep into the Gaoshanling area.

"Of course—this is the lifeline of the House of Elders." Having participated in "Operation Prometheus," Li Chiqi wasn't surprised by the tight security. This area held not only the ranch, weather station, and planned elder vacation area—more importantly, it was the site of the Grand Library and STC: the Original Standard Equipment Template archive.

Hong Huangnan didn't grasp the true meaning of "lifeline"; he assumed Li Chiqi meant the horses. Nodding, he said, "Animal power is a huge bottleneck—military, agricultural use everywhere. And to sell carriages on the mainland, we'd have to solve the horse problem for customers too. I wonder how many horses Nik has?"

"A couple hundred, I suppose," Li Chiqi said offhandedly. "We'll reach the ranch soon."

Hoofbeats echoed. The road network in the Piye Mountain restricted zone was now complete—bridges, signposts, drainage ditches, even roadside trees. The carriage ride was very comfortable. Passersby were rare, but structures were visible here and there on slopes and among trees.

"I had no idea the Executive Committee had hidden so much here!" Hong Huangnan was amazed. As Chief of Staff for Logistics, he had visited Xixingling for a battery completion ceremony, but hadn't expected the area to become so mysterious in just over a year.

"Heh, you're the Logistics Chief of Staff—didn't you know there are lots of military facilities hidden here?"

"An 'unreliable' person like me is just a staff officer," Hong Huangnan griped. "I organize tons of logistics plans on my desk—many are just code names. I have no idea where the projects are actually located."

Li Chiqi said, "I don't know the details either. But the military has definitely built several secret facilities here."

"Don't tell me they're hiding an atomic bomb."

"Not quite that extreme."

As they talked, the carriage arrived at Nik's ranch.

The ranch lay on the southwest side of Piye Mountain's main peak, Bald Ridge. Here was a small hill called Mopan (Millstone) Ridge—two layers of round flat-topped hills stacked like a millstone. The terrain was gentle, with few trees; after development, it made an ideal mountain pasture. Now, the surrounding valleys were all enclosed in the ranch's boundaries.

Li Chiqi said, "We've arrived at Castle Hill." Then he reminded Hong Huangnan, "When you talk about horses, don't use any dismissive or casual tone."

"Understood—he's a horse fanatic." Hong Huangnan nodded repeatedly. "This is called Castle Hill? It does look a bit like one."

"Heh, it's called Mopan Ridge—more like a bunker, really. But this is the place known as 'Nik's Castle.' Here, he's the local emperor."

The carriage stopped in the square before the ranch gate. Hong Huangnan stepped down and gazed around. The scenery was beautiful: winter sunlight fell on Piye Mountain; saplings of cash crops and windbreak trees planted last spring swayed in the breeze. White mist had just dissipated. Despite winter, the hills remained lush. Horses dotted the hillside pastures, leisurely grazing and frolicking. Some mares had recently foaled.

The valley grew fodder crops horses liked; corn had just been harvested, and alfalfa filled the fields. Several silage fermentation towers stood tall. Below the slopes were stables with high peaked roofs. A windmill turned slowly; the faint sound of flowing water could be heard. Hong Huangnan felt the landscape was reminiscent of overseas ranches.

A young man in farm-worker uniform was stirring something in front of a warehouse—a large wooden basin on the ground holding what looked like a mixture of herbs and water. Yang Baogui stood nearby, supervising: "Stir it well! Otherwise the horses won't eat!"

Around them were many lidded wooden tubs and barrels, emitting a mixed smell of herbs and chemicals.

Yang Baogui was here to treat horse ailments. Horses were delicate and prone to various problems. Upon news that a large batch of captured horses would soon arrive, Nik had invited Yang Baogui to prepare common equine remedies in advance, ready to treat the spoils upon arrival.

"That carriage looks great!" Yang Baogui studied the Dongfeng. "Where'd you get the horse?"

"Borrowed it," Hong Huangnan said. "Officers and soldiers are being repatriated from Qiongshan. The horses and livestock they're surrendering are being organized for transport to Lingao. I borrowed one to test the carriage."

Organizing the transfer was exactly the job of the Logistics Chief of Staff as part of the "peaceful evacuation" from Qiongshan before the troops boarded ships per the treaty.

"Nik's going to strike it rich," Yang Baogui said, then called to the diligently stirring youth. "Shengbao! Go fetch your master!"

Shengbao hurried off and soon returned with Nik, who had been washing horses in the stables. Nik wore a torn work suit, a towel wrapped around his head, straw clinging criss-cross to his clothes and hair. His sleeves were rolled past the elbows; his arms were red from the cold water.

"What? Just one horse?" Nik was disappointed. "Where's this carriage from?"

"The rest will arrive in batches starting tomorrow," Hong Huangnan said. "Don't worry—not one will be missing."

"I'm very worried!" Nik said. "The drovers probably have no experience caring for horses!"

"They were all former grooms…"

"Those grooms only know how to work horses to death—they haven't a clue about caring for them!" Nik yanked the towel off his head and squatted on the ground. "I should have gone myself!"
