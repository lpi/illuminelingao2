# Chapter 1172 - The Colonization and Trade Minister

Though Lin Shimao had taken various precautions, he hadn't taken the threat too seriously. After all, Jinjiang County seat was practically next door to Anping Town, and he worked for the Zheng family. Anyone thinking of moving against him would have to think twice.

He never expected his opponents to be so ruthless—to slip in silently and simply "snatch him from his bed," killing, robbing, and kidnapping all in one smooth operation, with the manner of outsider brigands who feared nothing. But it wasn't until he was being interrogated that he realized his captors' true identity.

These were the Australians!

The Australians had become a formidable name on the waters between Fujian and Guangdong. They had once fought all the way to the gates of Guangzhou, staining the Pearl River red with blood...

Realizing he had fallen into their hands, Lin Shimao went cold all over. Stammering, he admitted that Senkyu Sho and Li Shun had indeed been hired by him—he'd received two hundred taels of silver for it.

"...It was someone I didn't recognize who told me to hire them. Truly, I'd never seen this person—a middle-aged man, looked like a well-off shopkeeper—just said he needed to hire two men who were bold, unafraid of death, and willing to kill. Once I'd found them, I just handed them over to her..."

"You're a gambling den boss with some standing, and you just hire killers for some stranger who shows up off the street? You don't know the rules?" Xu Ke gestured with his chin. "Give Master Lin a little reminder!"

The team member raised his pliers again, but Lin Shimao, sweating in agony, couldn't hold out any longer. He simply told them everything he knew.

He truly didn't recognize the man, but he'd brought a calling card from Zheng Zhifeng—and no one in Jinjiang County dared disobey any of the Zheng family's young masters.

"It was Zheng Zhifeng?"

"Yes..." Thinking that he'd just betrayed the Zheng family's Third Young Master, Lin Shimao broke into another cold sweat. On one side were the ruthless Australians; on the other, the local tyrant Zheng family. He'd now mortally offended both powers—his whole family was done for.

"The card?" Xu Ke paused. In hindsight, he should have taken that card too—direct physical evidence. "Where did you put it?"

"He just showed it to me, then took it back."

"Took it back?" Xu Ke showed a look of disbelief. Lin Shimao, fearing more torture, quickly pleaded:

"Sir! What kind of figure am I? Just showing me the card was already giving me face—how could I dare ask him to leave the card behind!"

Xu Ke knew further questioning wouldn't yield much more. He signaled, and team members took Lin Shimao away. That night, under cover of darkness, he would be put on a ship heading to Kaohsiung.

Though they hadn't secured the most direct physical evidence, having Lin Shimao as a witness was enough—after all, the prevailing legal philosophy of this era still emphasized oral confessions above all.

But their mission wasn't finished yet.

Just as the report on the Vestreling case was being submitted to the Executive Committee and the Senate Standing Committee, a motion had emerged to declare war on Zheng Zhilong and use this opportunity to eliminate this formidable force on the Fujian coast.

Though the two sides had formed a loose commercial partnership through the private salt trade, there was obviously little mutual trust. Zheng Zhilong restrained himself only because he feared the Australian fleet and acknowledged his own very backward capabilities for blue-water warfare. In the long run, a falling-out between the two sides was inevitable.

The material from the Vestreling case, once reported in detail to Lingao, immediately raised a clamor for war against Zheng Zhilong—and Wei Bachi's behind-the-scenes maneuvering played no small part in this.

To reduce his own responsibility, he had to redirect everyone's attention. Wei Bachi had long grasped this approach. His methods in Kaohsiung had already been criticized by some in the Senate. Now with this embarrassing incident, avoiding a "medical leave" would require stirring up as much public opinion as possible—the more the better—letting Zheng Zhilong draw the Senate's fire.

As long as the Senate went to war with Zheng Zhilong, Kaohsiung would become a frontline base. To ensure stable operations there, the Executive Committee would never replace its commander in the middle of a campaign. After the war was won in general celebration, no one would bother pursuing the Kaohsiung mayor's problems—and even if they did, it would just be for show. A "properly contrite and profound self-criticism" would settle everything.

After writing his report, Wei Bachi expounded at length during a dinner gathering of Kaohsiung Elders about Zheng Zhilong's underhanded schemes and treacherous conspiracy, putting on a show of righteous indignation.

Though Liu Zheng was a Han supremacist, and to him these "white apes" like the Dutch were far more detestable than Zheng Zhilong, he cared even more about "the dignity of the Senate." Upon hearing that the Zheng family organization had resorted to such underhanded tactics, seriously damaging the Senate's face and image, he flew into a rage.

As the head of the "Huaxia Society," the Han supremacist faction among the Elders, Liu Zheng immediately sent a telegram to Huaxia Society members back home, demanding they introduce a motion in the Senate for the immediate destruction of Zheng Zhilong.

He then dispatched a messenger carrying his confidential letter aboard a refugee transport ship back to Lingao, addressed to Chang Shide. Besides brief greetings, the letter discussed the general course of events and shared his views on Kaohsiung's current situation and future development. Chang Shide, the soul of the Guangzhou-Leizhou faction, understood the implications and immediately went to work behind the scenes.

Thus the Senate's calls for war against Zheng Zhilong grew louder and louder—though internally, there had always been debate about how exactly to formulate policy toward Zheng.
