# Chapter 845

After much discussion, although some proposed simply sending a naturalized citizen, or hiring an influential local from Macau or even Batavia itself to serve as consul—in the 17th century, hiring foreigners as consuls was quite common—Skaed felt that giving up such a good opportunity to directly observe and influence Batavia was somewhat wasteful.

"Diplomats are the best spies." Jiang Shan said solemnly to a group of Senators from the Intelligence Bureau in the Intelligence Bureau's office building. "It would be too much of a pity to give up this opportunity!"

"If there's no suitable candidate, I'm willing to go." One person in the conference room said.

This person was in his thirties, with a long face and a beard, and a pair of piercing black eyes. He wore his hair in a topknot and looked both scholarly and chivalrous. He wore a blue pleated robe. This attire immediately identified him as a Senator intelligence officer receiving mainland deployment training in Class B of the Intelligence Bureau's training program.

"I know English, German, French, and Latin, and can read Spanish—though I can't understand it by ear." He said. "Knowing German means there won't be much obstacle communicating with the Dutch."

"Old Zhao, you shouldn't go. We're about to get people from Zhejiang, and then we'll have large-scale transfers of mainland population. The layout in the Two Jiangnan regions is very important." Jiang Shan immediately rejected the idea. "If you leave now, it'll take at least three or four months to effectively settle in, and at least half a year to get things going. If you go to Batavia, all the training up to now will have been wasted."

The main work of the Intelligence Bureau in the second half of 1631 was to obtain and transfer population on a large scale from the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui region. The station opened in Hangzhou would be an important point in the Intelligence Bureau's system in the southeast. Of course, Jiang Shan didn't want his overall plan to be disrupted.

In the end, following the recruitment principle, a volunteer was recruited from the Finance sector to go to Batavia—fortunately, a consul was a public identity and didn't require any cover training.

The volunteer willing to go to Batavia as consul was a Senator named Xue Ruowang. He was a certified public accountant and certified tax accountant. In the Finance sector, he specialized in building fiscal and tax systems. Tired of building systems and doing fiscal work, he wanted to go out and see if there was any other more exciting work to do. Xue Ruowang didn't know German or Spanish, but was proficient in English, French, and classical Latin. If push came to shove, he could also work in Batavia. Fortunately, the Finance sector had quite a few people. Cheng Dong said he could let him go.

"The scale of Dutch financial operations in the 17th century was very frequent. Placing someone familiar with finance in Batavia might reveal some opportunities." When Skaed heard that someone was willing to go, he was pleased. "Also, we can introduce some modern international trade systems into our import-export trade with the Dutch. Or simply open a bank in Batavia..." Skaed spoke with increasing enthusiasm.

"We'll discuss this later, later." Jiang Shan said. "First we need to get Old Xue settled in Batavia before anything else."

So the final decision for the consul to be stationed in Batavia was Xue Ruowang. This made this Senator, who had been buried in ledgers and numbers, overjoyed.

"After I get to Batavia, I'll strive to set up a Batavia branch as quickly as possible..." He said excitedly.

"To be honest, I'm worried about your future." Yan Ming, the president of Delong Bank, said with a face full of melancholy at the Finance sector's farewell banquet. "You have to be careful in that godforsaken place. Whatever you do, don't catch a tropical disease. Even if we immediately dispatch a doctor to save you, it would be too late..."

These words immediately deflated Xue Ruowang's enthusiasm by nine-tenths. Although before the transmigration everyone had been vaccinated with as many vaccines as possible, including some vaccines that would only be given when going abroad to Africa or Southeast Asia, many vaccines weren't effective for a lifetime with a single immunization. Some had validity periods that were close to expiring. Although the biological laboratory's vaccine development work had made great progress, there was still a long way to go to restore 21st-century immunization levels.

"It's fine. If the Dutch can stay there, so can I." Xue Ruowang said with feigned bravado. "Besides, there are quite a few Chinese there. I'll be careful and will be fine."

Before departure, Xue Ruowang received a "survival box."

"This is what the organization has prepared for you." Skaed pointed to this small box with exquisite workmanship—an outer rattan cushioning layer, an inner stamped tin lining, and an animal hide interior lining for moisture-proofing.

The box was very small, equipped with a special carrying strap so it could be conveniently carried on one's person. When necessary, one could just grab it and flee.

Inside the box were medicines specially prepared by the Health Department for the local conditions of Batavia. There were anti-malaria drugs, snake medicine, antibiotics, and some other emergency medicines and wilderness survival tools. Finally, there were 50 Portuguese gold coins.

"I hope you never have to use this." Skaed said.

"I hope so too."

As usual, Xue Ruowang would bring his life secretary along. Xue Ruowang had once very much hoped to get a Dutch woman in Batavia, but people at the Department of Colonization and Trade thought this was unlikely. The Dutch rarely shipped European women there; even the few women there were other people's wives.

After the decision was made to go to Batavia, Xue Ruowang's life secretary received confidential training at the Political Security General Bureau's confidential class, learning ciphers and radio usage. Through the radio, the Department of Colonization and Trade could effectively grasp Batavia's commercial and political situation.

**Excerpts from Leibtrini's Correspondence with His Venetian Friend**

Dear Friend:

I am very happy to be able to write to you. Since arriving in the Far East, all kinds of strange sights have been constantly flooding my mind. It is a great honor to share these sights with you. And being able to visit Lingao has really opened my eyes.

As a Company employee, I was able to visit the city that the so-called Australians established on Hainan Island—Lingao. After obtaining a formal trade agreement, we were permitted to move freely to observe the city built by this race we had never known.

You surely know that as a painter, I have a strong interest in observing things. Whether on the sea voyage to the Far East, in Batavia, or in various parts of the East Indies, whatever scenery I witnessed with my own eyes, I would try to record in my sketchbook. In Lingao, I naturally had the same interest, not to mention that this was also one of the reasons the Company sent me as an employee.

...

Mr. Gonzalez, the Spaniard, and I left the trading house at night. The trading house doorman did not restrict our coming and going, only using a sign written in multiple languages to remind us not to leave the East Gate Market area at night. To ensure we could return to the trading house, he also gave us a small paper card with some kind of writing on it—which I believe is Chinese characters. As long as we showed the card to passersby on the road, we could be smoothly guided back to the trading house.

East Gate Market at night was no different from during the day. The glass lampshades of the streetlamps along the street emitted bright light, illuminating the streets very brightly. Even if one dropped a button on the road, it could easily be found. The streetlamps existed not only on the main streets but also in those side roads and alleys—just not as densely or brightly lit.

Obviously, on such nights without darkness, East Gate Market's public security surpassed any city. Light drove away the best cover for evildoers—darkness.

Mr. Gonzalez and I wandered the streets until midnight. Even when there were few pedestrians on the streets, we still felt very safe. Not only did we feel this way, but the shops that stayed open until late at night should have felt the same.

Out of curiosity, Mr. Gonzalez and I ventured deep into those remote alleys. It truly amazed me: the streets of East Gate Market, whether main streets or alleys, were all very tidy and clean—this was truly a miracle. We couldn't see traces of garbage or excrement in any corner. Every inch of road surface was paved with flagstones, gravel, bricks, or hard black sand, so there was no standing sewage on the road surface. It was not hard to understand why the Australians held strict quarantine systems for any foreigners entering their territory. In such a clean and sanitary city, epidemics were indeed hard to break out.

To ensure hygiene, they placed rattan baskets for collecting garbage in many locations. All garbage was collected in them. Public toilets were also set up everywhere on street corners. Of course, these two things alone weren't enough to ensure hygiene. As you know: many nobles and important figures, without any regard, relieve themselves and even defecate under the staircases of their own and others' palaces—even though the palaces have toilets. I can only conclude that under Australian rule, the moral standards of the local populace have been greatly improved.

We had originally planned to find a tavern for a drink, but the various exotic sights on the streets of East Gate Market attracted us. We frequently entered the shops along the street to observe the goods inside. The shop owners and assistants didn't seem surprised by Europeans, as if they often saw Europeans. Later we learned that there were Europeans among the Australians. Of course, how these Europeans became Australians, we had no way of knowing.

The goods sold in the shops were abundant. Almost all the Chinese goods we commonly saw in East Asia could be found here. The prices were also not very expensive. There was a large supply of local fruits, and there were even shops specializing in selling fruits and fruit products. In particular, there were large quantities of preserved fruits. Obviously, they were not lacking in sugar supply.

The Australians have a unique way of producing various snacks. You probably couldn't find a shop elsewhere that would sell so many kinds of snacks. We entered a shop specializing in selling candy. The shelves were lined with glass jars filled with all kinds of colorful candy. Even my brush couldn't reproduce the colors and shapes of these candies in such a short time. They emitted various sweet and fragrant aromas, which were simply intoxicating.
