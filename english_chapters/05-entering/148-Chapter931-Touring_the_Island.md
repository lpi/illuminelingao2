# Chapter 931 – Touring the Island

The *Haitian*'s circumnavigation of the island caused great panic among the military and civilians of Nan'ao. As black smoke rose from the beacon towers, every beacon tower on the island lit up one after another. Then, the beacon towers on nearby islands, and even the coastal beacon towers near the mouth of the Han River, also began emitting black smoke.

Guard posts and fortresses everywhere closed their gates. Soldiers and militia braves, fully armed, climbed onto the city walls, gazing fearfully out to sea—the alarm for a "Hair-bandit" incursion had been sounded across the board.

Regarding the "Hair-bandits" who had suddenly risen recently in Guangdong, officials, gentry, and commoners all harbored a peculiar fear. Ever since news of the Guangdong government army's rout in Qiongzhou—where nearly the entire force was wiped out—had trickled out, the terror of the Hair-bandits had far surpassed that of the pirates who had been making trouble for the last dozen years. Their exploits in the Pearl River estuary had also been embellished into tales of horror.

Now, with an Australian ship flying the Hair-bandits' flag appearing, the psychological shock could well be imagined.

Although there was only one ship, and although the ship was less than two hundred tons, all surrounding walled towns and villages prepared for defense.

However, not a single government warship came out to meet the enemy or intercept them. Chen Ting knew how formidable the Hair-bandit navy was—Tang Yunwen's second defeat at Haikou in Qiongzhou and Xu Tingfa's disastrous defeat on the Pearl River were perfectly clear to him. He was unwilling to take the risk.

After He Rubin was defeated in Qiongzhou, despite Guangdong officialdom's best efforts to cover for him, he was still held accountable by the court, stripped of his office, and lost both military command and salary. He was now living idly at home, reduced to a "useless general." As for other generals who survived the campaign, they received punishments of varying degrees. Although Tang Yunwen's punishment wasn't severe and he remained the Qiongzhou Regional Vice Commander, rumors said he now never set foot outside Haikou Fort, nor did his military orders extend beyond its walls.

Chen Ting already had a secret non-aggression pact with Liu Xiang. Although they were very close in proximity, they left each other alone. Recently he had received intelligence reports that Liu Xiang's main force had gone north to Fujian to contest supremacy with Zheng Zhilong. The situation around Nan'ao was relatively quiet; under these circumstances, he was even less willing to start hostilities lightly—besides, he had no chance of winning.

Seeing columns of black smoke rising near and far made Qian Shuixie very excited—this taste of being feared was quite nice. Unfortunately, the purpose of this trip wasn't Nan'ao Island, and destroying Chen Ting right here would have no meaning for the Senate. In a sense, government troops were more benign partners; they currently weren't in opposition to the Senate, lacked subjective initiative, and wouldn't waste energy being enemies of the Senate. Leaving Chen Ting's forces intact served as an idle piece to check the Liu Xiang and Zheng Zhilong groups.

"Wonder where Liu Xiang is hiding." Qian Shuixie felt some regret—although he knew the *Haitian* alone couldn't deal a fatal blow to the Liu Xiang group, deep down he really hoped to have a fight at sea and let the boys get some blood on their hands. So far, the Sanya Detachment hadn't carried out any decent combat operations; most actions were punitive expeditions into the Li regions against "unfriendly" Li and Dong villages, basically consisting of ambushes and long-range sniping. Qian Shuixie felt such low-intensity combat couldn't properly temper the unit.

Li Ziping saw boats and people fleeing everywhere they passed and knew the Ming forces didn't intend to come out and fight. He immediately ordered Ren Fu to sail the ship into a bay and drop anchor, then lower boats to send the Special Reconnaissance and survey teams ashore for a reconnaissance mission.

Ren Fu chose a bay in the south of Nan'ao Island called Yandun Bay. This place was about 5 to 6 kilometers from the Ming garrison to the north. There was a village by the bay; as soon as the *Haitian* approached, the villagers fled, helping the old and young. Li Ziping didn't mind—he wasn't here for civil propaganda.

The operation itself was very bold, as the entire landing party numbered only twenty people, while the Ming troops and militia on the island who could mobilize at any moment numbered at least several thousand. If they got surrounded, they'd have to rely on firepower to force a breakout, likely suffering casualties. But Qian Shuixie believed this possibility was extremely low—according to intelligence, Chen Ting had no intention of engaging in armed conflict with the Australians.

"Maintain contact. Keep radio communications open." Li Ziping instructed, then said to Liu Zheng, "Old Liu, take your team members and look around the shore. Heading inland is a job for the scouts..."

"I'm a seasoned trekker; don't you trust my combat ability?" Liu Zheng was dissatisfied. He was fully armed, carrying instruments and equipment on his back. He patted the Glock 17 holstered under his armpit. "Don't worry. Me and these guys under me—though we're no good at shooting people, our skill at walking, climbing, and swimming isn't worse than scouts. Even if we can't be an asset, we won't become a burden to Qian Shuixie."

Finally, the survey team set off together. Both sides agreed that barring accidents, they would rendezvous at Qianjiang Bay at 10:00 AM the next day. It was inconvenient for the *Haitian* to anchor along the coast after dark.

This expedition team of less than twenty people landed on the island. The fishing village was empty of people. Based on the map, Liu Zheng believed this was likely Aoqian Village.

"If Zhao Yingong and his lot were here, they'd be putting on a show of sacrificing to emperors again," Liu Zheng said with a laugh. "The Southern Song court-in-exile stayed here back in the day."

"Is that true?" Qian Shuixie was interested.

"Yes, I saw it in the Grand Library's background materials while preparing for this survey," Liu Zheng said with relish.

In May 1276, pressed by Yuan troops, Lu Xiufu and Zhang Shizhong escorted the Song child emperor retreating via Nan'ao and once stayed at Aoqian Village. It was said that three "Song Wells"—Dragon Well, Tiger Well, and Horse Well—were dug here for the emperor, ministers, and soldiers to drink from.

Sure enough, they discovered a well with stone slab railings on the beach outside Aoqian Village, very close to the water. Liu Zheng tasted the water inside—it was fresh. This should be the legendary Song Well. Near Aoqian Village, they also found foundations of some larger structures, likely the temporary residence of the "Maritime Traveling Court." Rumors said the Southern Song court had left gold and silver treasures near Aoqian Village, but Liu Zheng dismissed this as nonsense.

Aoqian Village had nothing special, so the reconnaissance detachment soon left and began marching toward the northeast of the island. The western part of Nan'ao Island was mountainous—even in the 21st century it was a forest park. Population and towns were mainly concentrated in the eastern part of the island, and the Deputy Commander's headquarters was also located in the northeast.

The reconnaissance team operated on the island for a full 24 hours. During this period, they traversed almost the entire eastern part of the island. The passing garrisons and militias in villages and fortresses all stayed behind closed gates; not a single person came out to fight. The entire Nan'ao Island presented an unprecedented deathly stillness; almost all activity had ceased.

Qian Shuixie encountered no one in the island's villages except a few elderly people—almost everyone had hidden in the fortresses. Militia and soldiers slept with their weapons, keeping watch day and night, monitoring the wilderness, towns, and fields outside their walls. Most of them had never even seen what the legendary Hair-bandits looked like. In most cases, even when camouflage-clad scouts were right under their noses, they were hard to spot.

Nan'ao Island was located in the eastern Guangdong waters, at the center point of the three major ports of Kaohsiung, Xiamen, and Hong Kong, bordering the main international shipping lanes of the Western Pacific. It wasn't surprising that the Senate had a keen interest in it and listed it in the "Chain of Pearls." Places like Yandun Bay, Changshan Bay, and Zhuqidu had conditions for building deep-water ports and 10,000-ton wharves, making it an ideal maritime shipping relay station.

The wind energy resources here were very abundant, with an annual average wind speed reaching 8.54 meters per second and over 7,000 hours of effective wind speed hours. The island's total wind power installed capacity could reach 200,000 kilowatts. In the old timeline, it held the title of Asia's largest island wind farm. Although the transmigrators currently couldn't rely on wind power generation, wind energy was still an excellent resource to utilize.

The scouts advanced all the way to the vicinity of the Nan'ao Deputy Commander's headquarters. After conducting on-site mapping and photography of the encampment and harbor, Qian Shuixie estimated the garrison here to be about 3,000 men, with 40 to 50 war junks in the harbor and on the beach. There were cannon emplacements and sturdy walled encampments on shore. Clearly, this was the main support point for government naval defense in the entire Chaoshan region. If they were willing to fight actively, they would be a threat to the future Operation Engine.

However, Qian Shuixie believed they wouldn't be much of an obstacle to Operation Engine—the opponent clearly lacked fighting spirit and sought only self-preservation. This land reconnaissance turned into essentially a hike on Nan'ao Island. The Special Reconnaissance Team didn't even have a chance to take the safety off their weapons from start to finish. Qian Shuixie found the calmness of the island's military and civilians somewhat hard to understand—of course, the Special Reconnaissance Team hadn't done anything to provoke heavenly wrath and human resentment: they hadn't burned houses, snatched chickens or ducks, or molested women. The soldiers and militia simply watched them tour the island, tracking their movements with smoke signals, but no one ever came out to engage.

After proceeding according to the predetermined reconnaissance route, they arrived early at Qianjiang Bay the next day and successfully rendezvoused with the *Haitian*. The *Haitian* then conducted reconnaissance of the bays in the Shanwei and Chaoshan regions. During this time, they conflicted with local half-fishermen, half-bandit locals—their news was relatively isolated, and having never heard of the Australians' prowess, they served as target practice for the *Haitian*.

The *Haitian* then turned her helm toward Kaohsiung. From here to Kaohsiung, the sea voyage was only 160 nautical miles. The *Haitian*'s average speed was about 7 knots; 24 hours later, they arrived at "Dagou"—the waters of Kaohsiung.

Before the Ming Dynasty, Kaohsiung was still a lagoon, inhabited by the Makatao people, a branch of the so-called Pingpu tribes. These "tribes" basically belonged to the Austronesian language family, with very low economic and cultural levels and small populations. They were frequently harassed by Chinese pirates and Japanese *wokou*.
