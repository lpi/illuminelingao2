# Chapter 1174 - General Ping

Ping Qiusheng carefully concealed—or rather, believed he was concealing—his ambition to become the new shogun of Japan. So all along, he had tried to present himself as a "Japanese otaku culture enthusiast."

Deep in his heart, he very much hoped to preserve Japan's traditional culture and language, allowing Japan to continue on its original historical path—ideally straight on to the Taisho era, then directly into the lovable Heisei period. As for the Showa spirit—that could simply not exist.

But he had never dared mention this idea to anyone; it had somewhat "politically incorrect" overtones. Ping Qiusheng found it hard to read the Senate's attitude toward Japan: it wasn't the straightforward "Sinicization" approach used for Korea and Vietnam, nor the unequivocal "final solution" applied to Southeast Asia—it was an ambiguous mixture of love and hate.

Now, Japan's fate was in his hands.

It was with this complex frame of mind that Ping Qiusheng boarded the transport ship bound for Jeju Island.

The ship was an H800 Harmony-class vessel: the *Express Delivery*. Though not a majestic 854 or 901 steam warship, and somewhat slower, its 800-ton capacity meant an actual displacement of 1,400 tons—only slightly smaller than the 854's full displacement.

The larger the ship, the less it pitched. So aside from naval Elders and those with urgent business, most Elders traveling to Hong Kong, Jeju, or Taiwan preferred the H800. The larger hull also allowed for better-appointed cabins: the stern held "premium compartments" laid out like soft-seat train cars.

Traveling to Jeju with Ping Qiusheng were two other Elders: Huang Hua, who was preparing to develop trade with the Later Jin, and Li Yao'er from the Agricultural Committee.

Since graduating from intelligence training, Huang Hua had been "on standby"—meaning he kept working at the General Machinery Factory while reporting to the Intelligence Bureau each week for "re-warming"—the technical term for refreshing training content before it was forgotten.

He'd been waiting over a year like this. Jeju had long since fallen, the Dengzhou Rebellion was nearly concluded, and his overseas dispatch still hadn't come. Just when he'd given up hope, the assignment suddenly came—first to Jeju Island, then to find an opportunity to enter Manchu-controlled territory for trade and intelligence work.

This Heilongjiang native was now surging with emotion, often standing on deck gazing out at the sea, occasionally letting out long howls—the air of someone about to carve out a career in the wilderness. He'd even expressed willingness to give his life for the cause.

Li Yao'er, by contrast, seemed both excited and nervous. Ping Qiusheng saw her pleasant, gentle features; though she looked about twenty-seven or twenty-eight, when she spoke she still bounced around like a little girl. He didn't know why Wu Nanhai would send such a woman to Jeju Island.

The long, boring journey led Ping Qiusheng to chat with her. He learned she'd originally worked in finance as an accountant, but because she had no interest in accounting and was instead passionate about gardening and cooking, she'd applied for transfer to the Agricultural Committee. By pure coincidence, the Finance Department was just then forcefully implementing monetized accounting, and every department needed specialized accountants, so Li Yao'er was officially transferred to the Agricultural Committee as Chief Accountant.

Though she was still doing accounting at the Agricultural Committee, and though upon starting she'd faced years of accounts needing sorting followed by endless calculations, at least she'd moved somewhere she found interesting. Looking out from the Agricultural Committee offices, the windows opened onto year-round blooming beautiful gardens planted with all manner of herbs, medicinals, and flowers.

Working here was infinitely better than the cold, "industrial aesthetic" Bauhaus-style office building at Finance. In her spare time, she could join Wu Chuqing, Liu San, and his apprentice Fu Wuben—all garden enthusiasts—in tending the garden. Life was quite fulfilling. So she'd pushed to move into the Agricultural Commission apartments.

Li Yao'er's husband, Mei Fazheng, worked at the Industry and Energy Committee. Moving to the farm meant his commute became quite long. After a day and night of negotiations, Li Yao'er secured agreement by increasing the number of maids her husband could purchase from two to four. Thus the couple moved out of their Bairen New Town apartment and into Agricultural Commission housing.

"Didn't realize you were so generous," Ping Qiusheng remarked during their chat, surprised. Allowing him to buy maids was quite something—and four of them!

"I told him from the start: as long as priorities are clear, I don't mind. But they're maids—formal concubinage is not allowed!" Li Yao'er said breezily. "Any maid who gets ideas above her station—one finger and I'll crush her." The sweet smile on her face showed a flash of cold cruelty, making Ping Qiusheng's neck prickle with the realization this was no joke.

"Besides, even if I absolutely refused to agree, could I actually stop him if he wanted to do it? That's just how men are! Liu San just up and dumped his wife. Rather than earn that reputation and then get dumped anyway, better to allow it conditionally—much more controllable."

Li Yao'er's theory left Ping Qiusheng speechless. He changed the subject: "What are you going to Jeju for?"
