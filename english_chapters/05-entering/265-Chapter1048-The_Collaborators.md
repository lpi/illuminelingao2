# Chapter 1048: The Collaborators

Several Haenyeo looked eagerly at the "Wokou Lord" who had suddenly descended into the thatched hut. Seeing his grim expression as if he was about to treat Pan, they could hardly believe their eyes. After a long while, a Haenyeo knelt and begged: "My Lord, please save her! She hasn't married yet because she has to support the whole family. If she dies, the whole family won't be able to live."

"It's nothing serious, I can cure it," Feng Zongze said. Incision and drainage was a very simple minor surgery for medical personnel. especially with the premise that they possessed antibiotics like Sulfonamides now, curing it wasn't difficult.

Feng Zongze had practiced wielding the scalpel on many refugees long ago. Executing the operation was as smooth as flowing clouds and running water. He finished the surgery in three moves, inserted a drainage strip, and sprinkled anti-inflammatory powder—in his experience, sulfanilamide powder was almost a "miracle drug" with marvelous effects in eliminating wound inflammation.

Sure enough, although there was a commotion among the Haenyeo when he started using the scalpel, seeing his skilled technique, draining pus and applying medicine, Pan became quiet after it was over. Knowing the "Wokou Lord" had treated her with medical skills, they couldn't help but shed tears of gratitude, bowing repeatedly in a grand ceremony.

"It's not serious now. Take care of her for three to five days, and she'll be fine," Feng Zongze said in Korean. "I've instructed the kitchen to issue her patient rations."

The so-called patient ration was a type of relief ration specially provided for the sick and wounded. It contained no sweet potato powder but was composed entirely of rice flour and starch, including a small amount of protein powder. Cooked into gruel, it was nutritious and easy to digest.

Feng Zongze glanced at the Haenyeo. Since their capture, he saw that the prisoners were all thinly clad, so he instructed to give each of them a set of cotton clothes supplied for refugees from the warehouse.

Although called cotton clothes, they were actually padded with cattail wool (*Puhuang*), and the quantity of padding was insufficient. The warmth retention was poor. But for the Haenyeo who had been barely surviving winter in single layers or half-naked, these were already good clothes that could warm their hearts.

Seeing the "Wokou" giving cotton clothes, providing gruel daily to fill their bellies, and even treating illnesses, the Haenyeo, besides shedding tears of gratitude, also muttered in their hearts. What exactly did these strange "Wokou" want to do?

If they fancied their bodies, it had been several days since capture, yet they weren't called to sleep with them, just detained, with people sent daily to ask many questions.

Moreover, they gradually discovered clues: these "Wokou" were actually Chinese! Because they spoke Chinese when talking to each other. There were many descendants of Yuan and Ming exiles on Jeju Island, and some could still speak Chinese. The Haenyeo had heard it more or less.

Could they be pirates of the Ming Dynasty? But this attire was too strange.

The Haenyeo began to mutter in their hearts, but the original fear and resistance had dissipated a lot. Everyone began to feel that whether they were Wokou or Ming pirates, they weren't bad people—at least for them, the poor.

Seeing the timing was about right, Feng Zongze released the Haenyeo home but instructed them to bring back the villagers hiding in the nearby mountains.

"We don't rob things, don't burn houses, and certainly don't rob women," Feng Zongze said, seeing smiles appear on some of the kneeling Haenyeo. "As long as everyone comes back to work for us—those who work for us, we give grain." Saying this, he took out a brown oil-paper package. This was something the Haenyeo were very familiar with these days: relief rations.

To familiarize them with this ration so that one day it would achieve the magical power of the US military's C-rations during World War II, the Haenyeo had been made to help in the kitchen and tend fires these days, fully familiarizing them with the appearance and taste of this ration, so as to spread the prestige of the relief ration.

Jeju Island in 1631 had relatively favorable weather without disasters, but in previous years there were disasters almost every year. The Joseon government forbade Jeju Island commoners from fleeing to the mainland peninsula, and relief was untimely. Many starved to death, and quite a few risked death to cross the strait and flee to the peninsula. The survivors had all suffered long-term torture of hunger.

Although fishing villages had fish catches to supplement food, merchants buying seafood exploited heavily, selling grain at high prices while abalone and sea cucumber were worthless. The commoners in fishing villages lived a very bleak commodity economy life of selling cheap and buying dear.

People struggling on the starvation line for a long time had a strong expectation of eating their fill. This was also an incentive that could be most utilized to explode with maximum destructive power. The method Feng Zongze used wasn't fresh, but it was equally effective.

Not long after the Haenyeo were released, they quickly mobilized the villagers who had fled into the mountains to return—most families originally had no food for the next day, and with the daily catch cut off, they couldn't last hiding in the mountains. Now hearing the "Short-haired Wokou" came to pacify them, they came down the mountain.

When the commoners returned, Feng Zongze held a special meeting in the village, asking villagers to continue fishing and harvesting seafood, only that all catches must be sold to them: payment would be made in grain and other daily necessities.

The commoners were naturally willing—unwilling, they had no choice: merchants obviously wouldn't come here to buy dried goods anymore unless they abandoned their family businesses and fled their hometowns.

First tempt with economic benefits, then move from quantitative change to qualitative change; this was the consistent method of the Senate's civil affairs work.

Commoners in hungry despair were the most realistic. Whoever could feed them and clothe them, they would follow, even if it was just a post-dated check. As long as you painted it brilliantly, you could still raise a team.

Feng Zongze had no doubt that under their silent influence, the first batch of local collaborators would soon emerge from the fishing village.

The Park brothers, Deok-hwan and Deok-maeng, were sent to Seongsan along with more than a dozen prisoners captured by the Special Reconnaissance Detachment.

The brothers were in a daze and frightened all the way, not knowing where this gang of grotesquely shaped Wokou intended to take them. According to horror stories circulating on the island, after Wokou captured prisoners, they would disembowel them and use human hearts to accompany wine; even in less horrific stories, they would be taken back to Japan as slaves.

Compared to the former, the latter was easier for the brothers to accept: anyway, they were slaves on Jeju Island too. Just worried about the language barrier, life might be hard. Of course, Park Deok-hwan was unwilling: after all, getting land and preparing to build a house had cost him a lot of savings. If captured to Japan, everything would have to start from scratch.

Finally, after the hoods were removed and they were settled, they realized they had arrived at Jeongui County Seat—they had been to this area on errands for the Jeju Government Office. What surprised them even more was that Jeongui County Seat had fallen into the hands of the Wokou! Inside and outside the city, short-haired, short-clothed Wokou carrying "iron guns" were everywhere.

Temporarily not leaving Jeju Island made them feel slightly at ease. The prisoners were uniformly settled in Jeongui County Seat. The Jeju Island Forward Command ran a "study class" here, preparing to cultivate local collaborators on a large scale.

The captured prisoners underwent screening: repeated interrogations until the prisoners confessed everything they knew—not only local conditions but also everyone's personal background.

Feng Zongze read interrogation reports every day, checking if there were usable talents. The Park brothers immediately entered his sight.

The Park brothers were of official slave origin: the oppressed underclass. And they were victims of political struggles from a Middle People background, falling from young masters in the past to lowborns meaner than commoners (*baekjeong*). The huge gap in status and life would only generate huge hatred towards the existing system. Adding the two together, it was typical "great suffering and deep hatred."

Feng Zongze knew that the hatred of such people was all-encompassing, and the resentment was twisted. Although they could only be content with the status quo because their personal strength was too small to change anything, once given a chance for revenge, the power they exploded with would be extremely destructive.

Unhesitating betrayal and thoroughly satisfying revenge. Feng Zongze thought, this is too perfect.

Perhaps they were not suitable constructive forces, but they would spare no effort in acting as collaborators and destroying the old world and old order.

Even better, they were children of Middle People, well-educated, and could read and write Chinese characters—just couldn't speak.

Compared to the double-dealing local petty officials, the potential value of the Park brothers was more appreciated by him.

Of course, such people should also exist among the official slaves of the Jeongui Government Office and various garrison posts they took over. However, the only ones who could be applied to Jeju immediately were these two—among the three cities of Jeju Island, Jeju City had the greatest value. As soon as the situation in the two counties stabilized slightly, it would be taken immediately.

Feng Zongze decided to work on these two people personally.

After reading their materials repeatedly, Feng Zongze called the Park brothers to the interrogation room.

After casually asking a few simple personal questions, Feng Zongze asked:

"Park Deok-hwan, how old are you?"

"This lowly one is twenty."

"Are you married?"

"No..." Park Deok-hwan said uneasily, not knowing why this Wokou Lord asked this—he had felt these days that the comers were definitely not Wokou. They spoke Chinese and wrote Chinese characters; nine out of ten they came from the Ming Dynasty.

But people from the Ming Dynasty definitely didn't look like this. Park Deok-hwan still remembered seeing envoys from the Ming Dynasty when he accompanied his father to the office in his youth. Whether in official robes or casual clothes, officials or servants, none had short hair (*kunfa*), let alone this kind of strange button-front short jacket.

"Twenty years old, not young anymore. Why haven't you married? There are three forms of unfilial conduct, of which the worst is to have no descendants." Korean scholar-officials were all Confucian believers, believing in Confucian classics to the point of rigidity. Since Park Deok-hwan was a son of Middle People and educated, this doctrine must have been deeply ingrained in his heart long ago.

This question triggered all the hardships and troubles of preparing for marriage recently from the depths of his heart, and from this, he thought of his dead relatives, especially the past events of his grandmother and mother who died on the road urging him to "carry on the family line." His eyes reddened involuntarily, and he held back, saying:

"This lowly one is an official slave; marriage is not a matter for oneself."
