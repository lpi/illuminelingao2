# Chapter 1096 - The Situation in Laizhou

Master Lü wanted to eat, and naturally, Fan Twelve was eager to serve. As a shopkeeper and chef of a small eatery, he was no stranger to cooking this—common folk couldn't afford decent fish or meat, so this delicious and cheap stuff was a common dish in such eateries.

That said, sea intestines (*Urechis unicinctus*) were still a bit too lowly. In good years, even commoners rarely ate them; they were mostly used to feed pigs or as fishing bait. Fan Twelve knew that although this thing was a lowly item, it enhanced flavor, so he usually dried some sea intestines into powder to use as seasoning, passing it off as rich stock.

Fan Twelve agreed profusely and hurried to the Wang Family Cemetery kitchen. A large part of the cemetery complex consisted of residential quarters for the living—when the master and mistress came for tomb-sweeping in the twelfth lunar month or for spring outings, they would inevitably stay here for a few days. Therefore, the facilities in the living quarters were roughly similar to those of ordinary wealthy households. The kitchen was also quite exquisite, not only fully equipped with stoves but also with all kinds of pots, pans, and ladles, even more complete than the tools in Fan Twelve's eatery.

The kitchen had already been cleaned to a point where Fan Twelve felt he "couldn't put his foot down"—it was too clean. This group of militiamen from Lü Family Village showed a breathtaking obsession with cleanliness from the moment they arrived at the *guanxiang*. Everyone put down the packs on their backs, and except for those on sentry duty or working, those with nothing to do swept the streets and the courtyard, clearing away garbage. They not only swept their station but also cleaned the streets and alleys of the *guanxiang*. The piles of garbage and floating dust on the streets were cleared out, and even the potholes were filled and leveled with soil and broken bricks. The entire *guanxiang* suddenly felt brand new.

Fan Twelve had lived in Laizhou for most of his life and had seen many people and things. Aside from the Prefect of Laizhou organizing the *paijia* to clean and repair the streets when welcoming imperial envoys or superiors, there had never been such a thing as sweeping the streets. Street hygiene was managed by the "street-watching" refuse soldiers, who merely sprinkled some water and cleaned up corpses on the road.

Garbage on the ground was the norm, and public urination and defecation were not uncommon. Take the outer wall of his small eatery for example; people often relieved themselves right there on the street, making it stink unbearably.

Fan Twelve rubbed his feet outside the door before stepping in carefully. He saw someone busy in the kitchen and thought it was a cook brought by the militiamen, but upon closer look, it was Commander Lü.

Commander Lü was wearing an apron, his sleeves rolled up, busy working. Fan Twelve was so stunned he couldn't even speak—this Master Lü was cooking himself?!

Based on his experience, anyone who could be the commander of a village and lead over a hundred fierce fighting men was a significant figure in the area.

He hadn't expected him to be busy in the kitchen personally; it was truly baffling—looking at this commander's appearance, with his fine skin and tender flesh, he didn't look like someone from a rough background.

Seeing Fan Twelve enter, Lü Zeyang called out, "Come, help me clean the sea intestines!"

One of the other purposes of Senator Lü going to Haimiao Port was to get food. He got his wish and saw the two delicacies he had long salivated over—sea intestines and Spanish mackerel meat. Although the sea was frozen, it happened to be the harvest season for sea intestines. Senator Lü had longed for this taste for a long time, but unfortunately, Lingao neither produced this nor did anyone know how to cook it. He barely made do with jelly worms (*Sipunculus nudus*), but the taste was different after all. Now that he was dispatched back to the Jiaodong Peninsula, naturally, he had to gorge himself. As for the Engine work, that could wait until he was full.

At that moment, Lü Zeyang instructed Fan Twelve on how to cook—modern cooking and Ming Dynasty cooking were somewhat different, especially in heat control and seasoning. He directed Fan Twelve to wield the knife, chopping the fish and mixing the filling.

Fan Twelve intended to curry favor with "Commander Lü," so besides the sea intestines, he stir-fried a few other dishes. He originally thought Commander Lü would want to drink, but he asked for nothing and directly shoveled a full basin of stir-fried sea intestines with leeks into his stomach. Still unsatisfied, he asked Fan Twelve to boil more than fifty mackerel ball dumplings as a snack.

"Bring them to the main hall in a while," he ordered, then moved into the bedroom with his maps, calipers, and notebook to consider his grand strategy.

"Alright! Just you watch," Fan Twelve tapped the edge of the pot, regaining the feeling of being an eatery shopkeeper.

Lü Zeyang chose a room next to the main hall as his bedroom—this was the residential part of the Wang Family Cemetery, where the housing facilities were quite exquisite, equipped with an underground heating system (*dikang*). Once the orderly lit the fire, the whole room was warm as spring. Unfortunately, his life secretary studied accounting and couldn't serve as a multi-skilled female orderly. Thinking of this, he immediately considered selecting one or two big lasses from his fellow villagers in another spacetime to serve as his guards when he returned to Lingao.

There was a guard standing outside the room—the Senators were very careful about their lives. Senator Lü belched, patting his belly as he paced in the room. His mood brightened considerably after eating and drinking his fill, and he even felt optimistic about the future. Since it was the will of heaven, waiting a month was just waiting. The urgent task was to quickly put his ideas on paper and send them back to Lingao as soon as possible, striving for the support of the big shots in the finance and economic system at the Executive Committee expansion meeting to facilitate the passing of his proposal.

Thinking of this, Lü Zeyang stuffed two more dumplings into his mouth and shouted indistinctly to the orderly outside, "Brew a pot of tea, it's too salty!"

Curled up on the *kang*, he worked until midnight, and the "Report on Shipping Conditions in Laizhou Bay," consisting of over thirty thousand words, was finally produced. With this report, there would be sufficient material for making PPTs, and he would appear exceptionally capable during the expansion meeting. As the saying goes, whether the work is good or not depends mainly on the report—Senator Lü rubbed his sore thighs with a look of satisfaction: a load was finally off his mind. Next, it would depend on Cheng Dong and Yi Fan's maneuvering ability in the Senate. As for himself, he still had to help Old Man Sun guard this Laizhou City!

With the heavily armed Qian Duo Company guarding his side, Lü Zeyang was not worried about the safety of Laizhou City. In history, with only a thousand or so scattered reinforcements appearing intermittently, Zhu Wannian and the two governors held the city with a makeshift force of four or five thousand old and weak troops. Now that he had made up his mind to use Laizhou City as a temporary winter settlement for refugees, he inevitably had to put some effort into the city defense, at least to preserve the core of Laizhou City: the four *guan* and four *yu*.

From the map, the prefectural city of Laizhou was a north-south rectangle. The area enclosed by the city walls was roughly equivalent to the area surrounded by Wenhua East Street, Wenchang South Road, Wenquan East Street, and Laizhou South Road in later times. In addition, outside each of the four city gates—east, west, north, and south—there was a thriving *guanxiang* area. Now, these had been subjected to "strengthening the walls and clearing the fields" by Sun Yuanhua; most residents had been gathered into the city, leaving many vacant houses, which were suitable for use as refugee camps. The prerequisite was that they had to be under the protection of artillery range—it was just that currently, there were only two mountain howitzers available.

There were thirty-six Great General Cannons on the walls of Laizhou City. Although they couldn't compare to the Red Barbarian Cannons, they had played a significant role in historical defensive battles. With these cannons, the rebel soldiers wouldn't dare to approach too closely.

Zhu Mingxia also promised that if necessary, upon his call, reinforcements would be sent from the sea to support Laizhou. Maneuvering one or two companies from the sea to land at Hutuya or Haimiao Port could easily catch the rebels off guard. If the situation was favorable, taking the opportunity to fight an annihilation battle and capture prisoners was also possible.

Compared to Sun Yuanhua's anxiety, the Senators actually held considerable contempt for the rebels' combat effectiveness: from the moment they raised the banner of rebellion, the little organizational discipline this force originally retained had long since vanished. Of course, under the banner of the Great Ming, they were originally just a group of old soldier ruffians who served only for food. Stripping away the superficial fine equipment and the large number of horses, what remained was just a group of ordinary bandits raping and looting for their own interests. Although some of them harbored deep hatred for the Shandong commoners and the government, more were just out for gold, silver, and women.

Such an army could bully the common people or fight a smooth battle against corrupt government troops, but when faced with a tough nut like Laizhou City, which was strictly defended, no one would be willing to risk their lives. Initially, Laizhou, with only a few thousand old and weak remnants, withstood the siege of tens of thousands of rebels and a large amount of firearms, holding out for half a year. It was nothing more than relying on the "defend the homeland" spirit of the people and gentry inside the city, sharing a bitter hatred of the enemy.

As long as the rebels were hurt and their initial momentum and spirit were blunted, their subsequent attacks wouldn't be fierce or ruthless. To maintain morale and the loyalty of their subordinates, the rebel generals would have no better method than to let their men ravage the Laizhou area. This would also increase the opportunities for the Senate to collect refugees.

Of course, the specific combat arrangements still had to be discussed with Xiong Qianduo and his officers. Sun Yuanhua also had to be notified, so both sides could coordinate their actions—this was tantamount to displaying muscles openly under the eyes of the Great Ming bureaucrats. If some "loyal and patriotic" official sent a memorial to the capital, it would inevitably cause trouble. This kind of "unifying the narrative" work still required Governor Sun's help.

Therefore, he decided to have as little contact as possible with local bureaucrats other than Sun Yuanhua. Even with Sun Yuanhua, it was better to meet less frequently to avoid attracting attention. Especially Wang Daochun; this person had a very poor impression of Sun Yuanhua, believing Sun was the main culprit for the Dengzhou Mutiny. Historically, in a memorial submitted on the 18th day of the first lunar month in the fifth year of Chongzhen, Wang Daochun stated: Kong Youde created chaos in Shandong, capturing seven counties in less than six days, and Dengzhou fell on the tenth day. This was entirely caused by the rebellious minister Sun Yuanhua collaborating from the inside and Governor Yu Dacheng's bribery and indulgence. This statement arose because when Dengzhou first fell, the Rebel soldiers stole the seal of the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou and issued proclamations everywhere demanding grain and pay be sent to Dengzhou, leading everyone to suspect that Sun Yuanhua had also rebelled.

Now, due to the Senate's intervention, Sun Yuanhua had escaped in time and shown an active posture of encirclement and suppression, so Wang Daochun had not submitted this memorial, which was critical for Sun Yuanhua.
