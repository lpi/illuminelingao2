# Chapter 812 - Open-Hearth Steelmaking (Technical Chapter)

Because coal gas was used, steelmaking no longer required coke. Even coal unsuitable for coking could be processed through gas generators to provide gaseous fuel. Air and gas mixed to form a combustion flame that reached two-thirds of the furnace chamber's height, sweeping across the charge surface. The flame passed through a long, shallow rectangular chamber lined with refractory materials. To prevent solid particles in the exhaust gas from settling in the checker brickwork, the exhaust first passed through a slag-settling chamber for particle precipitation before being vented to the chimney. During this exhaust discharge process, the gases transferred part of their heat to the coal gas and air entering the chamber through the checker passages. The result was that the flame temperature inside the furnace rose to 1,650°C.

Because the Siemens-Martin open-hearth process could smelt large quantities of metal at higher temperatures, it was widely adopted and became the mainstream steelmaking technology of the 20th century.

The inner refractory lining of the Ma'ao open-hearth furnace used magnesia bricks produced by the bittern factory. The Ma'ao Salt Field's bittern factory extracted magnesium hydroxide from the bittern—a byproduct of industrial salt production—then calcined it at high temperatures to produce the material for these refractory bricks. A furnace lined with such bricks was classified as a basic furnace.

Early converters and blast furnaces had used silicate refractory materials—so-called acid furnaces. Acid furnaces could remove manganese, silicon, and carbon from ore and pig iron, but they couldn't remove phosphorus. This meant steelmaking either had to use only phosphorus-free iron ore or could only produce low-quality steel. Britain possessed large quantities of phosphorus-free iron ore, which gave it a considerable advantage during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of the basic process greatly increased the utilization of various low-grade ores. Germany's steel industry was able to catch up largely thanks to basic-furnace technology.

Chinese iron ore generally contained phosphorus, causing most of the pig iron purchased from Guangdong to be high in phosphorus and brittle. In the past, when using converters, they had removed phosphorus through slag-making by adding baking soda and limestone. But this process wasn't thorough enough, and the resulting steel was of poor quality.

This time, Ji Wusheng had decided to use the basic process in the open-hearth furnace. Magnesia bricks would also be used as the refractory lining in the blast furnace. However, the acid and basic processes weren't a relationship of backward versus advanced—they were two different technologies. Which to use depended on the iron ore and the desired steel. So acid-lined furnaces would still be maintained in certain numbers. Ji Wusheng decided the small converters would continue using acid linings.

Within three or four days, the Machinery Sector had assembled a dredger and begun dredging work at Red Brand Harbor. The Navy not only provided ships and personnel but also dispatched survey boats to conduct hydrographic measurements, marking usable channels and berths with buoys. Meng De immediately had the Port Authority tow stored pontoons to Red Brand to assemble a floating pier for cargo discharge. A fixed pier also went under construction. Wooden pilings were driven one by one into the muddy sand of Red Brand Harbor's bottom; they would form a cargo corridor extending toward the anchorage inside the harbor. Temporary flatcar rails and cranes would soon be erected on it, unloading loads of construction materials from flat-bottomed barges.

Salt Village had been replanned and relocated as a whole to the newly built Ma'ao Commune headquarters. This was a "new village" built on the Bairren Commune model, implementing centralized residential management. Ma'ao Commune was positioned as a specialized salt-production unit; all its labor force had been recruited into the salt field. The few local fishermen had been relocated to Bopu Commune, which focused on fishing.

Ma'ao Salt Field was not only the main supplier of table salt for Lingao but also a source of chemical raw materials and an important revenue stream for the transmigration enterprise. Although its income from private salt sales had steadily declined as a share of total export trade, the revenue was extremely reliable and stable. Even before and after the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign, when imports and exports had dropped sharply, their private salt agent on the mainland—Liu Gang—had quietly continued shipping salt from Lingao by the boatload.

Now they effectively controlled all the salt fields in Hainan. Along the Qiongzhou Strait, Qiongzhou Prefecture had multiple historically established coastal salt fields. But these were in the same state as the old Ma'ao field had been—salt workers had fled, production was derelict, facilities and methods were extremely backward, and output was low. They urgently needed consolidation and technical upgrades—not something that could be accomplished overnight. So Ma'ao Salt Field remained their primary salt source for now.

Given the foreseeable seawater pollution problem, some Elders believed they should immediately consider developing Yinggehai or salt fields along the Guangdong coast, reserving Ma'ao salt for industrial use only. But Ji Tuisi didn't think it was that urgent.

"In the old timeline, the Bohai Bay coast was still a major sea-salt production region, and its industrial pollution was far greater than our little steel company here. The Bohai Rim industrial belt—heavy chemicals, steel, machinery—all high-pollution industries." Ji Tuisi said, "At worst, we can get some special-supply salt for the Elders from Leizhou in the future—they're just worried about eating high-iron salt."

The first blast furnace was finally completed after round-the-clock work. The drying process began for 24 hours. After drying and cooling, they began laying the refractory-brick lining inside the furnace, followed by another round of drying.

The purpose of drying was to remove moisture from inside the furnace. Moisture would lower the hearth temperature, causing the furnace bottom to freeze up and blocking iron discharge. It would also affect the furnace's lifespan, causing wall cracks.

The second drying was more critical. In effect, from the second drying onward, the blast furnace would never go cold again but would proceed directly to charging and continuous production. So the second drying had to wait until the refined ore powder from Sanya arrived before it could begin. As for coke, a considerable stockpile had accumulated at Bopu. It was shipped to Ma'ao, crushed into 20mm coke granules, and loaded into storage bins.

Thanks to the efforts of the Elders in Sanya, on February 10 the *Dajing* finally brought back the first shipload of refined iron-ore powder from Sanya. Subsequently, two Navy supply ships made additional runs, bringing back one shipload each of open-hearth ore and blast-furnace ore. Wang Luobin guaranteed that as long as shipping capacity was sufficient, with current stockpiles, they could dispatch 2-3 shiploads of refined ore per week, 150-250 tons per voyage. This shipping rate was enough to ensure continuous blast-furnace and open-hearth production.

After discussion with Wu De, Ji Wusheng concluded that the official ignition of the blast furnace and open-hearth should be scheduled for late February. This would allow Lingao to stockpile a certain quantity of refined ore as a buffer in case Sanya's ore supply was interrupted.

"We need at least one week's production requirement of ore and coke in reserve. If sea transport is cut off or Tiandu has problems, we can keep the furnaces running without blowing down." Ji Wusheng said, "And power coal—the steelworks needs its own dedicated reserve, earmarked funds for earmarked use. It can't be lumped into the Fuel Department's general accounts—power coal needs at least 7 days' reserve, and of course gasification coal counts toward that quota too."

Lingao Steel Company was a steel enterprise that had to import both coke and iron ore, with high external dependency. Coking coal came from Jiazi Coal Mine in Qiongshan; iron ore from Sanya; power coal from Guangdong and Hong Kong in Vietnam. For a steel company highly dependent on steam-engine power, power coal was lifeblood. Without power coal, even the blowers couldn't run; no machinery could operate; and steelmaking was out of the question.

"Is one week enough?" Wu De was worried. Aside from Jiazi Coal Mine, which was fairly reliable, the other sources—Sanya on the far side of Hainan, Hongji across the Gulf of Tonkin, and coal mines in mainland Guangdong—were all in uncertain states. Sanya was the most reliable, but if something serious happened there—a major accident or an enemy raid—a week's time probably wouldn't be enough to restore normal operations.

Ji Wusheng shook his head. "It probably isn't enough. But I know the current predicament, especially with power coal—I hear the shortfall is severe."

"More than severe." Wu De quietly told Ji Wusheng that the entire Lingao power-coal reserve, converted to standard coal, was only 9 days' worth.

"That little?" Ji Wusheng was shocked. At one point, after developing Nanbao Coal Mine and Jiazi Coal Mine, power-coal reserves had reached 30 days of standard coal. "Hasn't the coal-shipping route from Guangdong been restored?"

"Just restored. Volumes haven't picked up yet," Wu De said.

Coal supply from Guangdong had been largely cut off since before the Chengmai Campaign. Only Leizhou coal, being close and easy to transport, continued flowing steadily to Lingao via the Leizhou Station's operations. Other mainland sources had been completely severed. And the best Hongji anthracite arrived only intermittently and unreliably.

"You should know, we're also shipping power coal to Sanya every week now, and their appetite is growing all the time." Wu De's hair had been thinning since he became Director of the Planning Commission, and worry lines had appeared between his brows. "Maintaining 9 days of reserves—I'm already thanking heaven for that."

He had been mulling over plans to occupy Hongji. The lure of that super-large open-pit anthracite mine was too great. Lingao's industrial system desperately needed such easily mined, high-quality anthracite.

Currently, Hongji coal came through the Vietnam Trade Company operated by the Leizhou Station. The company purchased coal through local agents—shipping sugar out, bringing rice and coal back. But this trade had never reached significant scale.

"Chang Shide told me that the exchange rate for Vietnam trade is very favorable to us, but the trade goods we can supply are limited in both quantity and variety." Ji Wusheng said. "He says Vietnam has enormous demand for hardware goods, and also great need for military equipment. North and South are fighting almost every day—on a large scale."

Wu De thought: Lingao's products had one fundamental problem—limited production capacity. And capacity was tied to machinery shortages, which in turn stemmed from insufficient steel. Once they broke through on steel, everything else would follow.
