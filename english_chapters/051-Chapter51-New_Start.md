# Chapter 51 - New Start

Chapter 51 New Start

...fish, shrimp and crabs were quite abundant. Taking advantage of several breaks, he caught a catty of shrimp and also caught a crab, tied it with rattan, and prepared to have a feast with his wife in the evening.

Outside the tents by the roadside, transmigrators in twos and threes were gnawing on dry food with water - it seemed the cafeteria was hopeless. Some people were too tired and were already snoring like thunder in the tents.

While walking, several members of the Military Group headed by Ran Yao, escorting a person with a black plastic bag over his head and holding torches, walked over and stopped him.

"Night inspection, show your ID card." Ran Yao's voice made Liu Zheng involuntarily remember his days in Beijing back then.

He handed over his ID card, and the scanner quickly displayed his ID number on the PDA.

"You are Liu Zheng?"

"Yes, it's me." Liu Zheng was a bit confused. Do they check temporary residence permits here? Or does the Executive Committee have something to find him?

"You brought foreign military field rations?"

"Yes." Liu Zheng thought, are they going to requisition them? This won't do.

"What brand, how much quantity?"

"How can I remember clearly. Let me think, MRE No. 4, No. 7, No. 8..."

"Okay," Ran Yao interrupted him, looked at the surrounding Military Group members, and rummaged out four or five packs of brown plastic bags and a carton of 555 from the bag in his hand. Liu Zheng recognized at a glance that these were exactly the reserve materials he brought. He even specially stuck a label on the seal of that carton of cigarettes.

"My cigarettes!"

" This is what we found from this guy's hand," Ran Yao gestured, "He was just coming out of your tent."

"Ah!" Liu Zheng never dreamed that someone would steal things on the first day of time travel. Human nature, human nature, too ugly!

"We didn't expect it either. Originally we thought the Executive Committee asking the Military Group to patrol in the camp was unnecessary. Didn't expect to catch one red-handed on the first day."

"How to deal with this guy?"

"We don't care. Let the Executive Committee deal with it." Ran Yao smiled, "If put in the 21st century, this value would just be education and release, at most detention for two days."

Watching this group of people gradually go away, Liu Zheng holding the cigarettes couldn't help sympathizing with this unlucky guy. Leaving a stain just after arriving, too miserable. He didn't even have the interest to go to the seaside to smoke.

Ran Yao took the person to the command post, wanting to ask about the situation first before reporting to the Executive Committee for disposal. The person caught just now, besides theft, had too many doubts on him.

When arresting him, this person attempted to resist. Although quickly subdued, he obviously had a foundation in martial arts. A * type pistol was found on him. This was not a Hualong make, but a genuine product with a gun number. Ran Yao knew very well that real * pistols were not common in the black gun market. Some transmigrators had channels and abilities to get guns, but they would never get a * type pistol known as a small firecracker.

When the hood was lifted under the light, the doubt became even bigger. The man in front of him looked young at first glance, with ordinary looks, but his eyes were quite shrewd and experienced - Ran Yao was familiar with such eyes - should be a peer. There were very few police peers among the transmigrators, and he knew all of them. He had never seen this one. Connecting with that * pistol...

Clothes were the unified tropical training uniform of transmigrators, wearing an armband of basic labor force, but no electronic dog tag.

"Name, age, occupation?" Ran Yao asked casually, "Where is your ID card?"

The young man lowered his head and said nothing. Although Ran Yao hadn't done pretrial, he had seen many prisoners with all kinds of expressions and styles, but he had never seen such one - extremely confused.

After a long time, he finally opened his mouth and asked back, "Who are you?"

Ran Yao was stunned. Since saving President Wen bravely last time, there were really few people among the transmigrators who didn't know him.

"I am Ran Yao, leader of the Public Security Team."

"Public Security Team, Public Security Team of where?" Guo Yi looked him up and down for a long time. Just now it was this guy who led people to pounce on him. Indeed it was the grappling fist of the police and armed police system, and the temperament was also very similar - peers are always easy to identify peers - how could a policeman also wear clothes issued by the Time Travel Company? Why is he on the ship?

Doubts came one after another. But for Guo Yi, from yesterday to today, doubts had piled up into a mountain.

It turned out that after Guo Yi and two American agents knew the whereabouts of the ship, they tracked all the way to the port. To their disappointment, the goods on the ship were nothing special, all loaded by the local port company. After getting the cargo manifest, the three studied for half a day but couldn't figure out what purpose Wen Desi had. But they found in surveillance that Wen Desi took people onto the Fengcheng. After discussion, the three simply conducted an undercover reconnaissance. Following the outfit of people getting on the ship, each person prepared a set, secretly boarded the ship with the assistance of the Port Authority, and hid on the ship. The senior crew on the ship knew about this matter. To guard against accidents, he also notified the superior department of his action plan.

The development of things was unexpected. That night, when Xue Ziliang found that the sailboat suspected of arms smuggling indeed rendezvoused with the Fengcheng, he thought the opportunity to make merit had arrived. Just as he was excitedly busy dialing his mobile phone to report, the signal suddenly interrupted.

For the subsequent night and day, these three people spent in fear: first, no one's mobile phone could get through, even the maritime satellite phone Xue Ziliang spent a lot of money renting had no signal. Then after dawn, Guo Yi found the ship arrived at a completely strange and desolate place.

The three all thought the ship arrived at a desolate island harbor in Vietnam - analyzing from the ship's speed and surrounding geographical environment, this was possible. But the maritime satellite phone still couldn't get through. Not interference, but simply no signal at all - a phenomenon completely unexplainable.

Watching the ship start to disembark passengers and unload cargo, in order to investigate clearly, Guo Yi simply mixed into the crowd queuing to disembark. In the chaos, he took a basic laborer's armband. No one discovered an extra person without a group on the beach. The cordon of the Military Group was set on the periphery, never expecting there were spies on the ship. He wandered in the camp like this for a day, until his stomach was hungry, then he thought of getting some food to take back. Unexpectedly, he was caught red-handed as soon as he succeeded. Although it was a work need, wouldn't colleagues laugh their heads off if they knew later.

"Executive Committee, Internal Affairs and Civil Affairs Committee Public Security Team! Any problem?"

Guo Yi raised his head. He didn't understand what Ran Yao said at all, but this institution obviously didn't belong to the People's Republic of China. Is it some criminal organization?

Ran Yao was already basically certain: This person was not a transmigrator. Thinking of the family sucked in by the wormhole last night, could this person be one too? But he obviously came with a purpose and target. From the performance of stealing an armband and mixing into the camp, this person was not an innocent involved person.

"Okay, I answered you. Who are you, and what are you doing mixing among us?"

Guo Yi resolutely didn't speak. He increasingly thought these people were very cruel organized criminals. In the whole day's observation today, he saw many professionals working, unloading a large amount of equipment and machinery. People on guard were well-equipped, and many were of military origin. Plus this peer interrogating him...

The energy of this criminal gang is too big! Smuggling weapons from the United States, building bases in Vietnam, hiring retired soldiers and police... Guo Yi shuddered without cold. Done for. Falling into the hands of this group, he would definitely suffer torture and finally die miserably. Although Little Guo knew as soon as he started work that the nature of his work might make him a martyr at any time, but people who became martyrs were few after all, not one or two in several years. Besides, martyrs didn't know they would definitely sacrifice heroically when alive. That was much better than him waiting to be a martyr now.

Resolutely not yield. Little Guo, educated by the Party for many years, strengthened himself while continuing not to speak. Torture then torture. Now only hope the two silly Americans can escape, so there is more or less hope of rescue. Just don't know if they are as brave as in American movies.

Ran Yao knew he was a bit afraid. This is human nature. But he took his duty very seriously and resolutely didn't speak - this was a bit troublesome. Extorting confession was obviously not feasible. Even if he mixed onto the ship with ulterior motives, in this space-time he could only become a companion. Explain? Ran Yao really didn't know how to explain. Would he be treated as a mental patient? Today Xiao Zishan spent an afternoon explaining their environment to that family. Except for receiving countless Sichuan-style national curses, he didn't convince anyone.
