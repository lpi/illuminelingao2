# Chapter 1163 - The Medical Affairs Section Chief

Deng Bojun had been working under Commissar Shi's Health Department for quite some time. In the early days of establishing Bairen General Hospital, although there were public health professionals to help, the day-to-day operations increasingly interfered with the clinical work of Shi Niaoren and others. Even though they were all doctors and masters degree holders, someone still needed to do the grunt work of running things around—the official term being "general affairs, logistics, and administration"—work that natives couldn't yet handle given its specialized modern nature.

Originally, this work had been handled by He Ping, husband of Zhao Yanmei. But once the pharmaceutical enterprises under the Health Department kept expanding, it seemed a waste to leave He Ping—who had pharmaceutical factory experience—in an administrative position. So he was transferred to the Health Department's Pharmaceutical and Medical Equipment General Factory to work alongside his wife.

This left the general affairs work without anyone in charge. So the personnel department selected from the files a male homebody who had been librarian at the Great Library since the crossing but had expressed strong interest in saying "I'm most familiar with this healthcare business"—and assigned this surname-Deng homebody to take charge of logistics and general affairs at Bairen General Hospital.

The early half of this surname-Deng homebody's life was that of a complete loser. As the son of a medical university professor, though his knowledge was broader than his peers and he had highly divergent thinking, he couldn't even get into high school. The professor saw that his son wasn't serious student material, so he sent him to join the army, thinking: no matter how wayward my son is, in that military environment he should at least learn enough to test into a military academy, right? Unexpectedly, he couldn't even manage to be a switchboard operator as a pampered soldier's son in some important compound—he couldn't memorize the phone numbers—and so his one-year service stint ended ignominiously. He came home and idled for half a year.

The professor figured he should at least find the boy a skilled trade. Thinking of his many years in ophthalmology and refractive surgery, he had some reputation and connections. So he sent him to apprentice at an optician's shop run by an acquaintance, preparing for him to eventually open an eyewear shop with the professor serving as consultant. Fortunately, just as the surname-Deng homebody's slacker apprenticeship was about to be exposed, the professor's university suddenly issued a one-time veteran placement document to accommodate some bigwig's discharged son. The surname-Deng homebody thus wormed his way into the university's affiliated hospital, becoming a gofer in the administrative building. When his gofer life was about to hit another wall, the surname-Deng homebody resolutely joined the crossing.

Deng Bojun's work in the Medical Affairs Section, in Shi Niaoren's view, was barely adequate—the only thing better than naturalized citizens was that at least he could communicate without barriers and knew what modern medicine was. Plus, terms and complete case files would constantly pop out of his mouth, enough to bluster in front of naturalized citizens. Under contemporary circumstances, being a section chief was roughly acceptable.

Section Chief Deng was the busiest person at Bairen General Hospital—the whole hospital's and even the whole Health Department's food, drink, and bathroom needs fell under his purview. Basically, he couldn't say three sentences to anyone without having to say "Brother, I've got a little matter to attend to." Naturally, he wouldn't have come all the way to Hong Kong for no reason—Commissar Shi had dispatched him to come scout things out. His purpose was of course related to the medical tour, and naturally also the groundwork for the Provincial-Harbor Hospital.

Deng Bojun smiled wordlessly, following behind Commissar Shi. The group welcomed their way to the Hong Kong Commercial Station building, where there was unavoidably another round of welcoming and hospitality. Finally, they saw him settled in his guest room.

Because Commissar Shi was a People's Commissar-level senior cadre and needed to handle myriad affairs at all times, the guest room was a suite—with an office beyond the bedroom for visiting Elders to work and receive guests.

After disembarking, Commissar Shi was inevitably physically and mentally exhausted. But the Guangzhou medical tour wasn't like tours in the Green Zone or Yellow Zone. Guangzhou, though the Senate was now operating almost openly there, was still technically enemy-controlled territory—at minimum an Orange Zone. Going deep into "the core of Great Ming's local governance" to conduct activities required caution. Even though Little Guo had sworn there'd be absolutely no problems, Shi was still somewhat uneasy.

"Director Shi," Deng Bojun wasn't used to the Senate's Soviet-style titles and habitually used old-timeline honorifics, which felt both warm and indicated his healthcare system origins. "I've already arranged the Guangzhou medical tour. You've had an exhausting journey; rest in Hong Kong a few days before setting out."

Shi Niaoren said: "Is everything ready on the Guangzhou side too?"

"Yes, it's set up at Guangzhou's Purple Sincerity Hall—I've already sent Li Mo there to scout ahead."

Though Li Mo was among the earliest batch of nurses, her academic ability wasn't up to par—she kept failing her nursing exams, and various professional courses were a real struggle for her. Shi Niaoren felt she probably had no development potential in this field; all his efforts would at best produce a healthcare worker level. So she was transferred to general affairs instead—at least she could read, write, and do arithmetic, and spoke decent Mandarin. As Deng Bojun's assistant, she was more than capable.

Sending her to Guangzhou as an advance scout was also because she could speak good Cantonese-inflected Mandarin.
