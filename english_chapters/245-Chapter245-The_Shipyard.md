# Chapter 245 - The Shipyard

The next day, Bai Guoshi slept very late. He heard from the brother on duty at the residential group gate that a girl had come to look for him, but because he hadn't gotten up yet, she was turned away. Bai Guoshi thought this was most likely Zhao Xue—coming to find him early in the morning, needless to say, she wanted to go to the canteen for breakfast together. This was a great opportunity to increase emotional exchange, and he actually missed it. He knocked his head in annoyance.

Another depressing thing was that after coming out of the committee yesterday, his head was dizzy due to the long argument. As a result, when Wei Aiwen asked him for a cigarette, he muddledly gave him the whole pack that he had only smoked one from yesterday. Painful! That was a pack of Hard Chunghwa—the market price for a pack of Hard Chunghwa was ridiculously high now. Fortunately, he had brought a whole carton.

"Truly unlucky." Bai Guoshi felt depressed as he thought about it. He simply couldn't be bothered to eat breakfast and fished out a piece of incredibly unpalatable "Grassland No. 5" rice cake from his pocket. This was the standard ration during field operations, but because everyone didn't like eating it much, a lot was saved up.

Chewing the rice cake that seemed impossible to swallow, Bai Guoshi arrived at the Exploration Team office. Just as he sat down and poured a cup of water preparing to swallow the rice cake, Liu Zheng came in. Seeing him, Liu Zheng chuckled a few times, leaving Bai Guoshi baffled.

"Xiao Bai, MM Zhao Xue is officially transferred to our department starting today."

"Really?!" Bai Guoshi stood up directly in excitement, almost choking on the rice cake.

"Don't get excited, of course it's true." Liu Zheng comforted him with a smile. "Men and women working together makes the work not tiring. Xiao Bai, you must seize the opportunity—"

Just as Bai Guoshi wanted to say something, Zhao Xue barged in and said bluntly: "I heard I'm being kept at the base and not allowed to go out on missions!"

"Well, hehe, yes," Liu Zheng nodded. "Your leg isn't good, not quite suitable for such long-range field activities. After our exploration team scales up, we need someone on duty; we can't leave the fort empty. This also combines your IT expertise to handle intelligence analysis and organization. Your work is very important: first, before every long-range squad departs, provide them with a mission briefing so they have a preliminary understanding of the target to be reconnoitered; second, after they return, compile the collected intelligence into a report to submit to the Intelligence Committee. There is also a pile of administrative affairs to handle. The burden is heavy, but don't worry, the comrades and I will help you as much as possible."

Zhao Xue said thoughtfully: "So important..."

Seeing she was fooled, Liu Zheng hurried said, "I have other matters, leaving first. You guys get busy." Creating an opportunity for Bai Guoshi.

Bai Guoshi suddenly felt he was super lucky. Could it be the merit accumulated by giving away a pack of cigarettes for free? Wei Aiwen wasn't exactly an old lady crossing the street.

Just as he was thinking about how to start the conversation, Zhao Xue spoke: "I went to find you in the morning; why were you still sleeping?"

"I was exhausted yesterday. You don't know how late the meeting at the Executive Committee went," Bai Guoshi couldn't help but start blowing his own trumpet, talking big about how extraordinary his bearing was during the report at the meeting. he even added details like how he solemnly pointed out the Executive Committee's insufficient attention to the long-range exploration cause, how the Executive Committee humbly accepted this, exclaiming repeatedly that there were capable people in the exploration team, and finally, even the large-scale exploration adventure became his proposal.

While speaking, Bai Guoshi felt guilty, but seeing the MM's flower-like smile and the look of admiration in her eyes, he couldn't help but continue bragging.

After saying enough, Bai Guoshi asked: "What did you want with me this morning?"

"I received the transfer order early this morning. I still have a lot of stuff stored in the IT department and wanted to ask you to help me move it."

"Okay, okay, I'll go right now." Bai Guoshi hurriedly volunteered.

The next day, including new personnel, everyone was reassigned into groups, balancing the strength of two groups as much as possible. Training was conducted using a veteran-leading-novice model. Since the recent mission was to follow the main force for a round-the-island exploration, the direct quality requirements for team members weren't that high, so the exploration team gained precious breathing time for training. Usually, Liu Zheng's content mainly included:

1. Field survival training: Basic field survival training, combined with lessons learned from actual combat missions.

2. Basic individual tactics: Including grappling arts, etc., mainly taught by people from the Special Reconnaissance Battalion.

3. Basic squad coordination tactics: Including cross-cover, etc., with special emphasis on coordination training between guns and crossbows.

4. Professional knowledge of flora, fauna, minerals, and meteorology.

5. Nautical adaptation training: Each group had to go to Bopu for rowing and swimming training.

After several days of training, everyone's levels improved greatly—thanks to the long-term labor after D-Day, even the most useless otaku now had a fit body. With physical strength, what was taught was nothing more than skills and coordination matters.

Liu Zheng also took the team to Gaoshan Ridge, Lingao Cape, and other places for a series of field combat survival trainings in mountainous and maritime areas, and even organized a confrontation battle between Team A and Team B. Besides honing the skills of newcomers, it also served to enhance feelings and boost morale.

Wen Desi went to the shipyard every day these past few days to supervise the construction of their first two-masted schooner. The blueprint of this ship was based on the lines of the historically famous *America*: displacement 170 tons, length 30 meters, beam 7 meters, draft 3 meters, two-masted, fore-and-aft rigged. It could be operated with a crew of only 9 including the captain.

Since this ship was the first large vessel built by the Transmigration Group itself, it was called "Ship Zero" before its official launch and naming, signifying its status of coming from nothing.

The boatwrights from Baitu were the main force of shipbuilding. Building a large Western ship was a brand-new challenge for the boatwrights, and for Wen Desi as well. It was also a test for the transmigrators' overall industrial level and coordination ability.

Because no one had experience launching a 170-ton ship, the shipbuilders of the new timeline adopted a safer and more appropriate dry dock shipbuilding method. Although the project was huge, its completion was significant for the shipbuilding industry.

The dock was dug by manual labor and machinery. It wasn't entirely a pit dug on the shore; strictly speaking, it was a semi-open structure—more than half was excavated on the beach, and the other part was enclosed in the sea using wooden piles and masonry engineering. The dock walls and bottom were reinforced by pouring bamboo-reinforced crushed stone concrete.

The water pumps for the dock were relatively easy to solve: the Transmigration Group not only brought equipment like water pumps themselves, but modern ships like the *Fengcheng* were also equipped with a few of these things. After the steam engine was successfully trial-produced, using it to pump water was no problem either.

The lock gate was made of iron frames and wooden planks. Building this gate consumed a large amount of high-quality timber. The gate also used shipbuilding caulking technology to increase watertightness between planks. The gate was opened and closed by ropes pulled by a winch. To drive the winch and water pump, the machinery department specially manufactured a boiler and matching steam engine for the dock: a fifty-horsepower horizontal steam engine. Besides opening and closing the gate, it could also drive a sawmill to saw wood during the day and pump water for the dock at night—the watertightness of the dock gate wasn't very good.

To build Ship Zero, the Transmigration Group began large-scale resource gathering before the New Year. The Ministry of Mechanical Industry specially set up an ironwork workshop in the shipyard to manufacture various iron and copper parts for the ship. Some large metal parts were contracted by the metallurgy plant.

The Wenlan River shouldered a large number of material transportation tasks: bulk and heavy materials were transported to the lower reaches by rafts, while lighter ones were transported to the shipyard by two-wheeled carts, manpower, or horses.

The timber for shipbuilding was seized from Baitu Village and had been fully dried for several years. This timber basically came from Fujian—Lingao locally couldn't provide so much large timber. Since Ship Zero was a trial product, apart from key parts like masts and rudders using ironwood, a large amount of cheap Chinese fir was used. Besides timber, Baitu Village also provided tung oil, hemp fibers, oyster shell ash, hemp ropes, and a large number of iron parts—including grapnel anchors. Ready-made accessories greatly reduced the construction period; otherwise, just collecting and manufacturing these things would have kept the transmigrators busy for months—Wen Desi often secretly rejoiced that they occupied Baitu back then.

The shipyard's labor force was quite abundant, mainly villagers forcibly relocated from Baitu Village. They had more or less participated in shipbuilding and could be directly put into the shipbuilding project with a little guidance. Wen Desi focused on cultivating outsider artisans led by shipwright Zhang Jiqi, leading him to work in the shipyard every day. Zhang Jiqi was now the Master Shipwright of the shipyard. Because he had learned many Western shipbuilding techniques and skills from Wen Desi, everyone was very enthusiastic.

In contrast, the children of the Lin and Lu families were somewhat apprehensive and obviously distracted. These two families, especially the Lin family, were large and powerful clans that had controlled Baitu's village administration for a long time and possessed strong prestige among the immigrants from Baitu Village. The Executive Committee was very wary of clan forces and absolutely did not allow this phenomenon to appear within their direct jurisdiction. So as soon as the housing in New Baitu Village was completed, Wu De immediately began to dismantle the two families.

Lin Gonglao stood at the door of the Quarantine Camp office. His young face was twisted, looking indignant. More than a dozen fellow clan youths around him also looked gloomy—they had just learned the assessment results and allocation destinations.

These past few days, all male immigrants from Baitu Village over the age of 16 underwent a skills assessment. Since the Lin family were boatwrights, the content of the assessment was various skills related to shipbuilding: including woodwork, sailmaking, ironwork, caulking, rigging, painting, etc., basically covering the entire content of ancient ship craftsmanship. The assessment content and specific scoring were done by Zhang Jiqi, but Zhang Jiqi didn't show his face to avoid awkwardness. Wen Desi knew from usual contact that Zhang Jiqi had quite a few complaints about the Lin family controlling village administration and embezzling most of the shipbuilding profits in the past. As long as he had no scruples, he wouldn't show mercy to the Lin family.
