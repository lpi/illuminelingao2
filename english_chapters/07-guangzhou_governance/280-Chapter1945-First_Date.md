# Chapter 1945 - First Date

During this period, though losing organizational contact had initially left her panic-stricken, time had gradually opened a door in her heart—one labeled "freedom"—allowing her to experience the joy of existing without pressure or assigned tasks. This didn't imply the work was easy; far from it—the labor proved exhausting. Feng Nuo deployed her like an adult male worker. Rather, a fundamental shift in mindset had occurred: she'd begun contemplating what tomorrow's post-work hours might hold, what new products the cooperative would stock next month, whether she might ask Chief Feng to formally transfer her from the Tiandihui next year when fresh graduates arrived... Also, what to purchase when wages arrived?

*Hmm, I'll buy that fool Qian Yuzhi a pair of shoes and treat him to a meal at East Gate Market. Consider it minor compensation for commandeering him these past weeks, and also thanks for introducing me here.*

Qian Yuzhi couldn't quite fathom why they suddenly had to dine together at East Gate Market today, though whenever Li Jianai came to work, they generally ate together before returning home in tandem.

According to Qian Yuzhi's limited life experience in the "old society," when a young woman willingly engaged in such behavior, she basically intended to marry you. But in the "new society," this merely indicated the other party harbored some favorable sentiments toward you. Marriage? Out of the question—let alone a "Senate disciple" from the College of Arts and Sciences like Li Jianai. Even an ordinary young woman possessing junior primary school credentials and working as a laborer or clerk in farms, factories, or agencies lay beyond a newly inducted factory apprentice like Qian Yuzhi's reach. At minimum, he'd need assessment to a certain grade level and wages reaching a certain threshold before she'd consider him viable.

However, this particular East Gate Market meal carried a certain solemnity. He secretly speculated on her intentions, and who would "treat" for this meal—his wages were rather meager, and he dared not casually spend the rent Li Jianai paid. His sister's marriage and his own future bride-seeking both demanded financial reserves.

Yet facing the girl's sparkling-eyed invitation, he involuntarily agreed. Though he'd grown accustomed to Li Jianai's commands these recent days, he vaguely sensed this differed somehow, and his heart accelerated.

Li Jianai seemed in exceptionally high spirits. She'd heard College of Arts and Sciences classmates mention a specialized drinking establishment at East Gate Market and had long nursed curiosity about it. Today presented the perfect opportunity to investigate with Qian Yuzhi.

The shop wasn't large, with dim lighting. A long counter housed the proprietor's wine-pouring and dish-cooking operations. The counter's outer edge formed an extended tabletop lined with several round stools. Against the wall stood small tables with high backs, somewhat resembling train seats—Li Jianai called them "booths." At capacity, perhaps twenty-odd people could be accommodated.

This was a husband-wife enterprise. The woman selling wine at the stove was the proprietress, reportedly a former Nanhai Coffee House waitress. The man worked at East Gate Restaurant. Both had been influenced by "Australian dining culture." After marrying, they'd both resigned to open this roadside establishment selling food and drink.

Though modest in scale, the décor and implements embodied thoroughly "Australian style." Every item appeared fresh yet attractive and functional, the arrangement remarkably comfortable. During the evening's lamp-lighting hour, gaslight from within shone through bamboo curtains. Forget eating and drinking—merely entering and sitting brought comfort.

It offered "Australian style" wine and fare, reasonably priced. Clientele consisted mainly of naturalized citizens employed in Senate enterprises and bureaus—especially unburdened young people. Stopping here after work to consume a set meal and drink kvass or beverages had become a cherished respite after exhausting days.

The hour wasn't particularly late, and the shop remained quite empty. They located a corner round table and seated themselves, ordering two set meals and two bottles of kvass. They habitually dined together in the canteen. Now, eating while casually conversing about work and life, Qian Yuzhi found chatting in this environment genuinely pleasant. He surmised ninety-nine percent certainty it was that Australian sensibility emanating from the Chiefs again.

The set meal portions were substantial, though for people laboring all day like them, hardly excessive. Qian Yuzhi ordered the large fried fish cake set. Two generous golden fried fish cakes rested atop shredded vegetables—this particular vegetable hadn't existed in Hainan previously. The Chiefs had introduced it, initially cultivating it at the Nanhai Demonstration Farm. Everyone called it "Kun Cabbage," though Australians termed it cabbage.

A thick sauce layer was drizzled over the fish steak, carrying a stimulating spicy aroma that awakened appetite. It came with a large bowl of white rice and oyster mushroom vegetable soup.

Li Jianai, being from the College of Arts and Sciences, understood the importance of "healthy diet" and "fitness maintenance" despite her considerable labor output, so she ate lighter fare: stir-fried shrimp with vegetables over rice, accompanied by clear seafood soup.

These dishes had all arrived with the Australians. Had the Chiefs not come to Lingao and conquered this small corner of the world, he, Qian Yuzhi, would never have sampled such delicious fish steak in the Ming Dynasty throughout his lifetime—forget enjoying fine cuisine, managing a meal of quality grain a few years prior would have constituted great fortune.

This is all fate. Qian Yuzhi experienced a momentary trance. Everything surrounding him seemed to become incredibly foreign, dreamlike.

"What's wrong? Spacing out?"

Li Jianai interrupted his reverie.

"Nothing, just feeling this place is truly wonderful." He replied, retrieving shredded cabbage to wipe the plate clean of sauce and fish cake remnants, consuming it in large mouthfuls with rice.

"You really possess a healthy appetite," Li Jianai observed with appreciative expression. "This is an Australian-style restaurant—the place I selected isn't bad..."

Suddenly she glimpsed a figure flash past the entrance, seemingly glancing inside before quickly departing.

Professional instinct made her immediately recognize the figure as someone she knew.

Who was it?

"Not bad, not bad." Qian Yuzhi, oblivious to her discovery, nodded agreement. Though acknowledging the place as "not bad," he couldn't deduce why the girl had suddenly wanted to invite him here for a meal.

Could she genuinely be interested in me? Qian Yuzhi's imagination began running wild.

"Of course the place I chose won't disappoint—broadening your horizons..." Li Jianai answered perfunctorily. She'd already identified the passerby: Feng Shan.

She came to East Gate Market too? Li Jianai felt mildly curious. Feng Shan's life followed essentially a two-point-one-line pattern, and though nominally a Living Secretary, she rarely performed such duties—functioning more as Chief Feng's student.

But her curiosity extended no further. After all, East Gate Market was hardly clandestine. Her attention returned to Qian Yuzhi.

Kvass contained slight alcohol content. One bottle consumed, their conversation naturally expanded. From initial politeness, they gradually broached their respective life experiences, unknowingly progressing to second and third bottles.

Qian Yuzhi chattered about his childhood, the encouragement from the Chief who'd come to console the family after his father's sacrifice, and boasted with slight pride about his sister's beauty and excellent academic marks...

Discussing his sister, he fell silent briefly before continuing that he absolutely must pass the Class A diploma and subsequently the technician examination, but he was too dull and constantly frustrated his master. Fortunately, he could serve the Chief now... and why he didn't reside in the dormitory, how much money monthly home-living saved, how much he collected from house rental, his monthly earnings and expenditures... He needed to prepare substantial betrothal gifts for marriage, plus finance his sister's wedding; later with children, they'd attend Fangcaodi National School—if they couldn't enter the selection group and secure scholarships, he'd need to raise tuition for advanced studies...

Li Jianai noticed him unconsciously stealing a glance at her when mentioning "marry a wife," and found it amusing. However, these intoxicated ravings resembling "idiots recounting dreams" brimmed with longing and hope, stirring something within her.

She recalled what the Chief who trained them had declared during Political Security Bureau instruction: "You will experience profound loneliness, you will make sacrifices, but your mission is extraordinary. It is to safeguard the security and property of the Senate and the people, to protect the Senate and the people's future and hope."

This somewhat clumsy large boy was, it turned out, among those she protected.

Li Jianai suddenly felt profoundly amused, yet her eyes stung.

This sensation is truly strange, she thought. Must have consumed too much kvass.

They remained in the small shop until quite late, amassing a table full of empty kvass bottles, ultimately forgetting entirely about purchasing shoes for Qian Yuzhi.

That night Qian Yuzhi experienced an exceedingly peculiar dream. He dreamed of consuming countless servings of the snacks called "small cakes" that shop sold. Soft, fragrant, sweet, crowned with a cherry—also sweet and tart. He ate one after another, as though insatiable... Suddenly, massive quantities of kvass seemed to leak from the ceiling, cascading onto his head.

He woke to find Li Jianai standing before his bed with an ice-cold countenance, holding a cup—his face thoroughly drenched.

"Get up and report to work! Look at the time!" She delivered this pronouncement, then turned and exited the room.

Qian Yuzhi scratched his head and sat upright. His head still throbbed. He seemed to have dreamed of something delicious just moments ago, but the wonderful taste he'd repeatedly experienced in the dream faded rapidly with mental clarity, growing increasingly blurred with each attempted recollection until it vanished completely.

Next came unchanging days. Qian Yuzhi continued performing various miscellaneous chores—sometimes transporter, sometimes laborer, sometimes mechanic, sometimes painter. Gradually he developed certain competencies. Jia Ben occasionally nodded approvingly at his work. Feng Nuo frequently conferred with senators from the Ministry of Science and Technology, electrical department, and mechanical department, compiling materials during spare moments. Feng Shan's studies and responsibilities intensified again, permitting her only evening assistance. Li Jianai still devoted two or three days weekly to Tiandihui obligations, working part-time the remainder.
