# Chapter 1801 - The Tax Bureau Chief

In terms of finance, in addition to the branches in the urban area, Delong Bank opened special counters in various Credit Cooperative branches, ready to accept and exchange silver and copper coins, and prepared for deposits and lending. Inside the stone chamber vault of the Delong Guangzhou Branch, wooden barrels and baskets for storing miscellaneous silver and copper coins were prepared. In particular, a large number of bank bills were prepared. The Ministry of Finance planned to fully implement inter-bank corporate account settlements after the new currency system was promoted, to reduce the use of cash.

Liu Xiang instructed the Police Bureau and Zheng Shangjie to conduct a secret investigation on the inventory, sales volume, and price conditions of daily necessities in Guangzhou through the Federation of Industry and Commerce, covering more than a dozen categories including textiles, meat, aquatic products, edible salt, tea leaves, etc. At the same time, to ensure real-time analysis of market data during the currency reform period, preparations were made to establish a regional data processing center within the Guangzhou Great World to process data collected daily, serving as the basis for the Guangzhou Finance and Economics Group's judgment.

Finally, there was the formation of the Guangzhou Municipal Tax Bureau. Under Liu Xiang's spare-no-effort persistent calling, Wudaokou finally sent him a Tax Bureau Chief.

In a special suite for Senators in the "Inner World" of the Great World, Senator Ai Zhixin sized himself up in the mirror. Capable short hair, carefully maintained titanium thin-frame glasses, a Swiss watch on his wrist, paired with a shirt made of top-grade white Dutch fine linen and light-colored khaki trousers, set off a "yuppie" flavor of a financial elite.

It was a pity there didn't have real leather shoes. Although these specially supplied cloth shoes were good, wearing them was inevitably a bit too artsy. Senator Ai thought with some regret.

He sized himself up again, confirming that everything was appropriate and correct, before turning around. Life Secretary Ai Yixin, who was waiting respectfully at the side, immediately handed him a high-imitation BOSS briefcase.

"Thank you." He took it. Although this bag fished out from Landu's fishing boat was only a Grade A replica, the workmanship was exquisite and the materials were particular, not losing to the genuine product. It was very much loved by Senator Ai—Senator Ai used to be a fashionista known for loving exquisite items when he worked at the National Tax Bureau in the past.

Ai Yixin gestured, asking if he was going out. This young life secretary's appearance and figure could be considered top-notch, but alas, she was a mute—fortunately, her loss of voice was acquired, not deaf-mute. This saved Senator Ai the trouble of learning sign language.

Of course, if not for this physiological defect, this maid who could be rated as A-grade wouldn't have been rated only as D-grade upon graduation. So much so that some sharp-tongued Senators called him "The Catcher" (one who picks up what others discard).

Let them call him "The Catcher"; Senator Ai didn't care. Although Ai Yixin couldn't speak and was still illiterate when she first arrived in Lingao, her learning ability was very strong, and her various study grades were among the best upon graduation. After a few years under his command, with self-study plus his guidance, she was already one of the most professionally capable people among the naturalized cadres from Wudaokou. If she weren't Senator Ai's maid, he could very well have promoted her to an important leadership position. Now he could only be satisfied with letting her serve as his private secretary—not just a "secretary for life."

Senator Ai had long been responsible for fiscal and tax work in Wudaokou. Within the Wudaokou system, fiscal and tax work was not valued at the beginning. This was also a helpless move; neither Lingao County nor Qiongzhou Prefecture were wealthy places. Agriculture was still backward, let alone industry and commerce. Therefore, the Senate's fiscal revenue relied on "spoils of war" and "trade" for a very long time. What was gradually collected later was mainly land tax and fishery tax. Although customs formulated tax types such as import and export taxes and anchorage taxes, to encourage import and export trade, many were exempted or reduced, existing in name only.

It wasn't until the industry and commerce in Lingao prospered that the tax department truly began to become active. The naturalized cadres of the tax department experienced "Long Live the Senate's Tax" for the first time—in the matter of taxing, the Great Ming was backward compared to international advanced levels even in the 17th century—the number of tax types and the complexity of tax rate calculations far exceeded their imagination, giving them a solid conceptual shock.

Now Senator Ai led the tax team he had trained in Hainan—mainly in Lingao—to descend upon Guangzhou.

"No need to cook dinner tonight; I'll eat at the bureau. Pack up the luggage; move to the bureau dormitory early tomorrow morning." Ai Zhixin instructed, "The General Affairs Office of the Municipal Government will send a sedan chair and laborers; listen to their arrangements. Don't go out alone casually; it's not very peaceful inside Guangzhou city now."

Ai Yixin nodded.

The place Ai Zhixin was going to was the Guangzhou Branch of the State Administration of Taxation—although called Guangzhou Branch, this branch actually acted for the tax work of the entire Guangdong province. Roughly speaking, wherever the Fubo Army could establish rule, tax work would be carried out there. Naturally, policies for the Core Zone, Pacification Zone, and Public Security Zone were all different.

Speaking of power, the authorization Ai Zhixin received was unprecedented. Except for customs duties, the collection of all industrial and commercial taxes, agricultural taxes, fishery taxes... in entire Guangzhou and even Guangdong was in his hands, and monopoly work was also under his management. regarding tax types, tax rates, and collection methods, he had the power to "act as appropriate without violating the general direction."

Naturally, receiving such great power came with a price, which was to complete tax work in an extremely complex environment—this burden was not light. Not only were there thousands of loose ends, but he also had to complete the work with an extreme shortage of personnel and institutions. At the same time, he had to cooperate well with the work of issuing new currency by Chen Ce's Finance and Economics Working Group. Tax collection and auditing were not only to increase fiscal revenue but also an important means to stabilize currency. Through taxation, merchants could be effectively forced to accept and use new currency.

Ai Zhixin was carried into the Salt Tax Bureau by the sedan chair in such an environment: now two signs had been hung at the gate: Guangzhou Branch of the State Administration of Taxation and Guangzhou Branch of the Ministry of Finance Monopoly Bureau. In Wudaokou's fiscal revenue, salt and tobacco monopoly was also an important income. Currently, there was no Senator responsible for the Monopoly Bureau, so it was also acted by the Tax Bureau—in a broad sense, monopoly was also a kind of tax revenue.

He had become accustomed to the smell emitted by stagnant water and sewers under the June sun along the way. Now, getting off the sedan chair, he felt a burst of cool air. The Salt Tax Bureau Yamen was an old yamen, almost as long as the history of the Great Ming, and the last renovation was a matter of the Jiajing reign. Here the walls were high and the rooms deep, the courtyards broad, and inside there were quite a few hundred-year-old trees, lush and green.

Because Guangzhou had just been pacified not long ago, National Army soldiers stood guard at all major entrances and exits. Ai Zhixin connected this to the fact that when he entered the city, Japanese guard samurai escorted the sedan chair, and he knew how complicated the situation he faced was.

Staff from the Tax Bureau and Monopoly Bureau were already welcoming at the ceremonial gate. The path naturally divided into two groups of people on both sides. On the left were naturalized staff headed by Hu Xuefan, some transferred from Hainan, some were staff of the Wansheng Storehouse formerly under the Ministry of Urban Construction in Guangzhou city. These were the basic team of Ai Zhixin's Tax Bureau. On the right were the old personnel retained after screening upon surrender, including clerks, scribes, grain runners of the household office in the yamen, ambassadors of the River Police Station and Salt Granary, various clerks and petty officials... of every hue and description, ranging from unranked officials to "runners" of the lowest rank, having everything that one expects to find.

As the highest-ranking and most senior official among the tax bureau civil servants, Hu Xuefan expressed welcome to the arrival of the new Chief. Subsequently, an old clerk of the Salt Tax Bureau led the way to the office.

The office was set in a fairly neat small courtyard—walking past those tall buildings with the old clerk, one realized that these houses were already dilapidated, the walls in disrepair for years were mottled and full of moss and mold spots, the roofs full of artemisia grass, and some even had small trees growing out. He heard the old clerk say that part of the houses here had been out of repair for years and had long been locked and unused. Some old salt granaries had already collapsed.

It's really gloomy enough here. Ai Zhixin thought.

The courtyard serving as office and dormitory had been tidied up cleanly, furnished with furniture and various daily necessities. Ai Zhixin instructed the accompanying clerks to open the document boxes he brought and arrange them on the shelves. He seized the time to read through the compilation of situational reports on fiscal and tax work sent by the Ministry of Urban Construction again.

Guangzhou's fiscal and tax situation was relatively complex. This was not only because the Ming Dynasty's fiscal and tax system itself was very chaotic, but also because the Senate itself had collected "reasonable burdens" and "fishery taxes" in Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta region for many years, and also sold large amounts of private salt in Guangzhou.

In the past, Ai Zhixin had studied the Great Ming's fiscal and tax policies in Lingao, but Qiongzhou Prefecture was simply too poor and backward, and the local yamen's concrete practice in tax collection was pitifully scarce. Now looking at the tax materials of Guangzhou Prefecture, he couldn't help but feel somewhat eye-opening.

The Great Ming did not attach much importance to industrial and commercial taxes. Except for land tax and salt tax, other taxes were collectively called "miscellaneous colors." And the collection of these miscellaneous colors was both chaotic and complex. Although there were explicit "ministry regulations," when it came to various localities, everyone acted in their own way.

Among them, the most important tax for the local area was the commercial tax, the nature of which was similar to the "Likin" of the Qing Dynasty. Only that commercial tax had a fixed quota. Every prefecture and county had specific commercial tax quotas, some surprisingly high, some laughably low. As for what basis this quota was originally formulated on, no one knew anymore.

The government sent clerks to block roads and collect taxes at ferry crossings. The tax rate was very low, but the scope of collection was extremely wide. Taxes could be levied on anything, even a chicken or a basket of vegetables. The principle of repeated taxation was implemented. That is to say, a farmer taking vegetables to the market to sell had to pay tax as many times as there were tax checkpoints on the way.

The clerks and tax runners sent to tax checkpoints to collect taxes not only had no income but also had to complete the fixed tax revenue quota. Thus the commercial tax checkpoints became a disguised tax farming system, and corruption and extortion of merchants and people by tax officials and tax runners became inevitable things. The result was great public resentment, while the tax collected was negligible, with a large amount of tax money being pocketed layer by layer, flowing into private pockets.
