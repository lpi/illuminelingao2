# Chapter 1801 - The Tax Bureau Chief

In preparation for the financial reforms, Delong Bank had established branches throughout the urban district and opened special counters at every Credit Cooperative location, ready to accept and exchange silver and copper coins while laying the groundwork for deposits and lending. Within the stone vault chambers of the Delong Guangzhou Branch, wooden barrels and baskets stood waiting to receive the miscellaneous silver and copper that would soon flow in. Most critically, vast quantities of bank notes had been printed. The Ministry of Finance intended to implement mandatory inter-bank corporate account settlements once the new currency system took hold, thereby reducing cash circulation.

Liu Xiang had instructed the Police Bureau and Zheng Shangjie to conduct covert investigations through the Federation of Industry and Commerce, surveying inventory levels, sales volumes, and pricing conditions for daily necessities across Guangzhou. The survey encompassed more than a dozen categories: textiles, meat, aquatic products, salt, tea leaves, and beyond. To ensure real-time market analysis during the currency transition, preparations were underway to establish a regional data processing center within the Guangzhou Great World complex. This center would process daily data collections and serve as the analytical foundation for the Guangzhou Finance and Economics Group's decision-making.

Finally, there was the matter of forming the Guangzhou Municipal Tax Bureau. After Liu Xiang's relentless lobbying, Wudaokou had at last sent him a Tax Bureau Chief.

In a special suite reserved for Senators within the "Inner World" of the Great World complex, Senator Ai Zhixin studied his reflection in the mirror. Practical short hair, meticulously maintained titanium thin-frame glasses, a Swiss watch on his wrist, paired with a crisp white shirt of top-grade Dutch fine linen and light khaki trousers—everything composed an image of financial elite sophistication, a distinctly "yuppie" flavor.

The only regret was the lack of real leather shoes. Though these specially-supplied cloth shoes were of excellent quality, wearing them lent an unavoidably bohemian air that didn't quite suit the aesthetic he cultivated.

He examined himself once more, confirming every detail was in order, then turned. His life secretary, Ai Yixin, had been waiting respectfully at the side and immediately handed him a high-quality imitation BOSS briefcase.

"Thank you." He accepted it with genuine appreciation. Though this bag—salvaged from Landu's fishing boat—was merely an A-grade replica, the workmanship was exquisite and the materials choice. It rivaled genuine articles and had become a favored possession. Senator Ai had been something of a fashionista during his previous career at the National Tax Bureau, known for his love of refined objects.

Ai Yixin made a gesture inquiring whether he was heading out. This young life secretary possessed first-rate looks and figure, but unfortunately she was mute—though her condition was acquired rather than congenital, so at least Senator Ai was spared the trouble of learning sign language.

Of course, were it not for this physiological limitation, a maid who might otherwise rate as A-grade wouldn't have been classified as merely D-grade upon graduation. This had earned Senator Ai a nickname among sharp-tongued colleagues: "The Scavenger"—one who picks up what others discard.

Let them call him what they liked. Senator Ai was indifferent to such barbs. Though Ai Yixin couldn't speak and had arrived in Lingao entirely illiterate, her learning ability proved exceptional. Her academic performance upon graduation ranked among the best. After several years under his supervision—combining self-study with his guidance—she had become one of the most professionally capable naturalized cadres in all of Wudaokou. Were she not Senator Ai's maid, he might well have promoted her to an important leadership position. As things stood, he had to content himself with having her serve as his private secretary—and not merely a "secretary for life."

Senator Ai had long overseen fiscal and tax work in Wudaokou. Within their system, such work had initially received little priority—a necessity born of circumstance. Neither Lingao County nor Qiongzhou Prefecture were wealthy territories; agriculture remained backward, and industry and commerce were virtually non-existent. Thus the Senate's fiscal revenue had depended for years on spoils of war and trade profits. What taxes they eventually collected came mainly from land and fisheries. Though customs had established categories for import and export duties and anchorage fees, most were waived or reduced to encourage trade, existing largely in name only.

It wasn't until Lingao's industry and commerce began to flourish that the tax department truly came alive. The naturalized cadres experienced what they privately called "Long Live the Senate's Tax"—a conceptual shock as they discovered tax types and rate calculations that made the Great Ming's system seem primitive by international seventeenth-century standards.

Now Senator Ai was leading the tax team he had trained in Hainan—primarily in Lingao—to descend upon Guangzhou.

"Don't prepare dinner tonight; I'll eat at the bureau," he instructed Ai Yixin. "Pack the luggage and move to the bureau dormitory first thing tomorrow morning. The Municipal Government's General Affairs Office will send a sedan chair and laborers; follow their arrangements. And don't go wandering outside alone—the situation within Guangzhou's walls isn't entirely stable yet."

Ai Yixin nodded her acknowledgment.

His destination was the Guangzhou Branch of the State Administration of Taxation. Though nominally a Guangzhou branch, it effectively administered tax collection for all of Guangdong Province. Wherever the Fubo Army established rule, tax work would follow—though naturally, policies differed across the Core Zone, Pacification Zone, and Public Security Zone.

The authorization Ai Zhixin had received was unprecedented in scope. Except for customs duties, the collection of all taxes—industrial, commercial, agricultural, fishery—throughout Guangzhou and indeed all of Guangdong lay in his hands. The monopoly system likewise fell under his purview. Regarding tax types, rates, and collection methods, he possessed authority to "adapt as appropriate without violating the general direction."

Such sweeping power came with a corresponding burden: completing tax work in an extraordinarily complex environment with extreme personnel and institutional shortages, while simultaneously supporting Chen Ce's Finance and Economics Working Group in its new currency issuance. Tax collection and auditing served not merely to increase fiscal revenue but as critical instruments for stabilizing the currency—taxation could effectively compel merchants to accept and use the new money.

The sedan chair deposited Ai Zhixin before the Salt Tax Bureau in this charged atmosphere. Two signs now hung at the gate: "Guangzhou Branch of the State Administration of Taxation" and "Guangzhou Branch of the Ministry of Finance Monopoly Bureau." Within Wudaokou's fiscal system, the salt and tobacco monopoly represented significant income. With no Senator currently assigned to the Monopoly Bureau, the Tax Bureau administered it by default—in the broader sense, monopoly revenue was simply another form of taxation.

Having grown accustomed during his journey to the miasma of stagnant water and sewage baking under the June sun, Ai Zhixin felt a cool relief as he dismounted from the sedan chair. The Salt Tax Bureau compound was ancient, nearly as old as the Great Ming itself, with its last renovation dating to the Jiajing reign. Here the walls rose high and the rooms stretched deep, the courtyards broad. Within grew numerous century-old trees, their canopies lush and verdant.

Since Guangzhou's pacification was so recent, National Army soldiers stood guard at all major entrances. Ai Zhixin noted this alongside the Japanese guard samurai who had escorted his sedan chair into the city and understood immediately how complex his situation would be.

Staff from both the Tax Bureau and Monopoly Bureau waited at the ceremonial gate to receive him. The assembled figures naturally divided into two groups. On the left stood the naturalized personnel headed by Hu Xuefan—some transferred from Hainan, others former staff of the Wansheng Storehouse under the Ministry of Urban Construction in Guangzhou. These formed the core of Ai Zhixin's tax team. On the right stood the old hands retained after screening upon the city's fall: clerks, scribes, grain runners from the household office, ambassadors from the River Police Station and Salt Granary, petty officials of every description—ranging from unranked functionaries down to the lowest-status runners.

As the highest-ranking and most senior civil servant in the bureau, Hu Xuefan formally welcomed the new Chief. An old clerk from the Salt Tax Bureau then led the way to his office.

The path wound past tall buildings that, on closer inspection, proved thoroughly dilapidated. Walls left years unrepaired were mottled with moss and mold; roofs bristled with wild artemisia, some even sprouting small trees. The old clerk explained that portions of the compound had been locked and unused for years due to neglect, while some salt granaries had already collapsed entirely.

*Gloomy enough here*, Ai Zhixin thought.

The courtyard serving as his office and dormitory had been tidied and furnished with necessities. Ai Zhixin directed his accompanying clerks to unpack the document boxes he had brought and arrange them on the shelves. Seizing what time remained, he pored over the compilation of fiscal and tax situation reports sent by the Ministry of Urban Construction.

Guangzhou's fiscal situation was exceptionally complex. This stemmed not only from the Ming Dynasty's inherently chaotic tax system but also from the Senate's own years of collecting "Reasonable Burdens" and fishery taxes throughout Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta, not to mention extensive private salt sales.

In Lingao, Ai Zhixin had studied the Great Ming's fiscal policies, but Qiongzhou Prefecture had been so impoverished and backward that local tax collection practice was pitifully rudimentary. Now, examining Guangzhou Prefecture's materials, he found himself genuinely enlightened.

The Great Ming placed little emphasis on industrial and commercial taxes. Beyond land tax and salt tax, all other levies were collectively dismissed as "miscellaneous colors." The collection of these miscellaneous taxes was both chaotic and complex. Though "ministry regulations" technically existed, every locality operated according to its own customs.

The most significant local levy was the commercial tax, essentially resembling the *lijin* transit duties of the later Qing Dynasty—though with fixed quotas. Every prefecture and county had specific commercial tax quotas, some absurdly high, others laughably low. Upon what basis these quotas had originally been calculated, no one any longer remembered.

Local governments dispatched clerks to man checkpoints at ferry crossings and block roads for collection. The rates were minuscule, but the scope was vast—taxes could be levied on anything, down to a single chicken or a basket of vegetables. The principle of repeated taxation applied: a farmer taking vegetables to market paid the toll as many times as there were checkpoints along his route.

The clerks and runners assigned to these posts received no salary yet bore responsibility for meeting fixed revenue quotas. Thus the commercial checkpoints devolved into a de facto tax farming system, with corruption and extortion becoming inevitable. The result: immense public resentment, negligible actual revenue, and the bulk of collected money vanishing layer by layer into private pockets.
