# Chapter 2063 - Words Through the Wall

"I quite like this Gervas," Nan Wan'er remarked, turning her cup thoughtfully. "It's refreshing, with that peculiar fizz. Not too sweet, not too sour."

Zeng Juan smiled. "It's easier to drink than grain wine, certainly. No headaches, no hangovers. Perfect for us."

"Do you remember the first time we drank it?"

"How could I forget? You spat it out immediately—said it tasted like something had gone off."

Nan Wan'er laughed softly. "I've gotten used to it since. Strange how tastes change."

Their conversation drifted to lighter topics: the latest styles in cloth, which shops had the freshest vegetables, the gossip about a certain widow who had taken up with a former salt merchant. The small, comfortable world of women's talk.

But their booth was near the inner wall, and the partition was thin. Soon, fragments of conversation from the adjacent room began filtering through.

"...the Chu fellow—that Chu Xiaoran. Have you heard?"

Zeng Juan's ears pricked up. She recognized neither voice, but the tone was urgent, almost conspiratorial. Without meaning to, she found herself listening.

"What about him?"

"Tax evasion, they're saying. Or worse—counterfeit money. There's a case being built against him. The Finance Bureau has sent investigators."

"Counterfeit money? In *Guangzhou*? Under the Australians' noses?"

"That's the point, isn't it? Someone's gotten bold. Too bold. My brother-in-law works at the harbor office, and he heard it from one of the patrol officers. They've been sniffing around Papermaker's Street for weeks."

Zeng Juan's hand, reaching for another date, froze in mid-air. *Papermaker's Street?*

Nan Wan'er noticed her expression and lowered her voice. "Sister Zeng? What is it?"

Zeng Juan shook her head almost imperceptibly. "Nothing. Just... a coincidence."

The conversation next door droned on, full of half-truths and speculation. Something about a paper shop, a suspicious merchant, perhaps some larger network. Names she did not recognize, places she did not know. Yet the weight of it settled on her chest like a stone.

She took a deliberate sip of tea, letting the heat steady her nerves.

*Papermaker's Street. Counterfeit money.*

What had she heard? What did she *know*?

Nothing provable. Nothing that should concern her. She was merely a woman dining with a friend, overhearing idle gossip through a poorly-insulated wall.

And yet—

"Shall we go?" Nan Wan'er asked gently, evidently sensing her distraction.

"Yes," Zeng Juan said, rising. "Yes, let's. I've rather lost my appetite."

They settled their bill—paid in the new Australian paper currency, naturally—and stepped out into the cooling evening air. The lanterns along the street were just being lit, their warm glow contrasting with the gathering dusk.

Zeng Juan walked in silence, her mind churning.

Nan Wan'er, ever perceptive, did not press her.

At the corner, Zeng Juan finally spoke. "Wan'er... if you ever hear anything—*anything*—about counterfeit currency, or tax stamps, or investigations... will you tell me? Quietly?"

Nan Wan'er studied her face for a long moment. Then she nodded.

"Of course, Sister Zeng. Of course."

They parted ways at the next crossing, each disappearing into the labyrinth of Guangzhou's twilight streets. Above them, the first stars began to emerge—indifferent witnesses to the currents swirling beneath the city's placid surface.
