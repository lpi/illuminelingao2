# Chapter 2042 - The Du-Song Debate

"Master Song, what's the matter?" Du Yibin noticed Song Yingsheng standing with eyes tightly shut—the very picture of "see no evil"—and couldn't suppress an inward smile. A man of Song's convictions naturally couldn't tolerate witnessing "white legs." Moreover, dancing had been intimately connected with "sexuality" since ancient times.

Song Yingsheng shook his head. Though he opened his eyes, he directed his gaze deep into the hall's interior, studiously avoiding the stage.

Though he had been following Du Yibin for over half a year, witnessing countless innovations and novel ideas—and though Australian women's revealing attire no longer shocked him—seeing Zhang Yunmi take the stage to dance exceeded the boundaries of his comprehension.

He understood that Australian Elders occupied the highest social echelon, their status far more complex than the Ming's "imperial clan." Given Zhang Yunmi's position, in the Ming Dynasty she would rank comparable to a Princess Royal—perhaps higher, since Ming princesses could neither hold office nor wield power.

For such a noble and powerful young woman to casually don what he considered practically "half-naked" clothing and dance on stage, with expressions and movements more seductive than any woman he had ever witnessed—

In Song Yingsheng's mind, the Plaid Skirt Club corresponded to the Ming's "Music Bureau," its performers equivalent to courtesan-musicians. For a female Elder to mingle with a troupe of courtesan-musicians was nothing short of self-debasement. Yet the Australians seemed utterly accustomed to it, thinking nothing of such behavior—truly "licentious" to an unprecedented degree.

Since his capture, Song Yingsheng's impression of the Australians had never been unfavorable. Yet he could never reconcile himself to the Australians' "frivolity" regarding gender relations and dress. Today's dance performance only reinforced this assessment.

After a prolonged silence, he finally spoke: "Shameless!"

He'd intended to remain silent, but his inner tumult made restraint impossible.

Du Yibin found the old scholar's conservative attitudes most exasperating. He responded:

"Master Song, this is our women's performing troupe, an arts organization—not the Ming's Music Bureau, nor are these courtesan-musicians! They are the Council of Elders' cultural workers, all legitimate naturalized citizens! Elder Zhang was once this troupe's star performer. Her appearance at this collective wedding is a blessing from the Council of Elders to the newlyweds, demonstrating that we are of one heart and body with the masses, treating all as equals, never displaying arrogance based on status."

"This dance is certainly different from Ming musical performances. Though it may appear somewhat 'shocking' to common people, it embodies the thriving, vigorous spirit under the Council of Elders' governance..."

Song Yingsheng thought sourly: If wearing less demonstrates spirit, wouldn't dancing naked demonstrate even greater spirit? He said slowly: "Chief Du, I've been treated with such courtesy these past months that this student is embarrassed to receive it. I have some heartfelt words as well..."

Du Yibin's spirits lifted. There's an opening!

"The Council of Elders now pushes northward. Its ambitions require no elaboration. Now that the Council's forces are formidable, heroes and talented individuals throughout the realm will surely flock to join. But this tendency toward seductive appearance and licentiousness must not be allowed to proliferate. Not only does it sap martial vigor, it also earns the contempt of worthy men throughout the realm." Having spoken, Song Yingsheng's face flushed slightly. He felt he was abandoning "pure loyalty," yet he couldn't restrain himself from speaking his mind.

Du Yibin prepared to respond but was interrupted.

"Chief Du, you needn't explain. This student understands—the Council of Elders intends to 'transform customs.' Therefore they don't hesitate to have female Elders, despite their exalted status, lower themselves to employ song and dance as instruments, appearing publicly to promote this trend. This is the most inferior strategy!"

As he spoke, Song Yingsheng's agitation mounted.

"Since ancient times, licentiousness and depravity have been the greatest corruptors of hearts. Elders occupy the nation's highest positions, serving as models for the people. One cannot take pride in this, much less lead by example—not only is it disgraceful, but it corrupts the pure hearts of the common folk."

Hearing him still entangled in this matter, Du Yibin felt his patience fraying. But then he reconsidered: though these words might displease the Council of Elders, they constituted "remonstrance," entirely from a perspective of considering the Council's interests. This represented the most significant shift thus far.

He collected his thoughts and spoke mildly: "Master Song, I fully understand your good intentions. Since our arrival in Lingao, those who condemn the Council of Elders as licentious, shameless, and depraved are as numerous as carp in a river. No, you needn't explain—by Ming customs, such accusations aren't unfounded. But surely you know that today's newlyweds were all former prostitutes of the lowest class?"

Song Yingsheng nodded silently.

"When the Guangzhou Municipal Government regulated the vice trade, I cannot recall precisely how many prostitutes were registered. But the total approached three thousand. In a city of merely five hundred thousand souls like Guangzhou, three thousand courtesans operated openly. The women plying their trade on Tanka boats along the river numbered beyond counting. What does that reveal about the Ming's moral atmosphere? Would you characterize that as 'observing proper conduct'?"

Song Yingsheng startled. "Guangzhou occupies southern barbarian territory, with foreign merchants converging from across the seas..."

"Very well, let's discuss the capital instead." Du Yibin's tone sharpened. "The northern and southern capitals, beneath the Emperor's very throne, supposedly exemplify virtuous governance. Yet Ming scholars themselves declare: 'In Yanjing, prostitutes outnumber respectable families.' To say nothing of the male brothels, inverting the natural order of yin and yang for officials and gentry's pleasure. What of that?"

At this, Song Yingsheng's face registered embarrassment. Regarding social atmosphere, he had never visited Lingao and couldn't judge, but it was undeniable that Australian-ruled Guangzhou's social climate was vastly superior to either capital.

"If someone possesses a natural inclination toward men and prefers them to women, that's one matter. But in these male brothels, both purchaser and purchased are men alike. The sellers do so from necessity—but the buyers? They seek only gratification of desires. How does that compare to women dancing here?"

"This..." Song Yingsheng considered that consorting with courtesans was a private affair, at most a dozen men gathering to drink and carouse. Even if someone proved especially dissolute, creating scandals, it still wasn't conducted before the general public.

"Being conducted publicly is indeed somewhat unseemly." Song Yingsheng recognized the futility of debating moral philosophy. His opponent grasped Ming officials and gentry's moral standards thoroughly. Further defense would only invite rebuke.

He had no desire to pursue this thread further. He'd long understood: there were many matters Elder Du couldn't persuade him of, just as he couldn't persuade Elder Du. Moreover, he had begun to perceive the Australians' approach to "imperial statecraft"—further discourse would serve no purpose.

Ignoring the cheers rising in waves outside and the thunderous music, he asked quietly:

"So the Elders crossed the ocean not merely to contest the Central Plains, but also to transform the established customs of a millennium."

"Ha ha, excellently stated!" Du Yibin nodded. "Precisely so."

"Then... wouldn't that constitute overturning the natural order..." Song Yingsheng's voice carried a tremor of apprehension.

"Overturning the natural order? Something like that." Du Yibin observed the performance unfolding outside. Zhang Yunmi had changed into a different costume, her hairstyle subtly altered, face glistening with perspiration beneath the lights, makeup somewhat smudged. Yet her eyes sparkled with electric intensity, every smile charged with vitality, rendering the audience intoxicated with admiration, cheering in rhythm. Even he, transplanted from the old timeline, found himself deeply captivated.

"If we cannot fundamentally transform this world, lacking both boldness and ideals, we were doing perfectly well in Australia—why venture here?" Du Yibin said. *Actually, I just want to prevent extinct animals from perishing due to human causes—though of course, that requires a great nation to accomplish.*

"These established customs were instituted by sages and have endured a millennium. How can they be altered so casually?" Song Yingsheng was shaken by this young man's audacity.

"Master Song, I'm no classical scholar and don't comprehend the various philosophical schools. The sages' teachings naturally possess merit, but can the sages' words resolve China's current crisis?" Du Yibin's tone grew serious. "In the Ming court and countryside, from the Emperor down to unenlightened *juren* and *xiucai*, who hasn't studied extensively and 'spoken on behalf of the sages'? Yet observe the Ming's present condition. Moreover, since the Han Dynasty established Confucianism's supremacy, nearly two millennia have elapsed. Dynasties rise and fall, chaos and order alternate—has there been the slightest fundamental change? Our Council of Elders seeks not merely to conquer the realm but to shatter this cycle of rise and fall, allowing millions of common people to live as humans should!"

"Dynastic rise and fall reflects heaven's mandate—not the sages' failure..." Song Yingsheng felt "there's no explaining this to you." In his estimation, current moral decline stemmed precisely from court and countryside "failing to follow the sages' teachings" and "lacking proper education." He paused briefly: "Chief Du, you once declared the Council of Elders is determined to prevent the realm's impoverished from serving as 'two-legged sheep' generation after generation. To break the unchanging pattern of a millennium, to terminate this cycle of rise and fall. This student is elderly and may not witness it. But Elders also possess finite lifespans. Even if you sustain it while living, what transpires after you're gone? Since antiquity, conquering an empire has proven easier than preserving it. Taizu was once meticulous in suppressing powerful families' land annexation and severely punishing official corruption—his efforts were not lacking, and the atmosphere was renewed temporarily. What of the present?"

"That's precisely why we must proceed differently." Du Yibin smiled. "The old methods no longer suffice. If we followed the traditional path, we could seize the throne within three to five years. But as the saying goes, 'his rise was sudden, his fall will be equally sudden.'"

Unthinkable! Song Yingsheng's mind reeled. How can governing a nation operate through trial and error!

"How can we distinguish right from wrong without experimentation?" Du Yibin sighed. "Taking a mistaken path doesn't matter, provided we acknowledge errors and can rectify them. What's truly perilous is recognizing you're on the wrong path yet insisting on traversing it to the bitter end—then sooner or later you'll plummet to destruction. As for our enterprise, successors will naturally inherit our legacy and continue it. Perhaps one day they too will stray, will stumble. But by then, I believe the people won't accept reverting to their status as two-legged sheep. They'll understand how to forge their own path."
