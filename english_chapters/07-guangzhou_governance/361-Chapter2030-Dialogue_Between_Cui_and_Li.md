# Chapter 2030 - Dialogue Between Cui and Li

This slightly surprised Li Suiqiu. Not that the viewpoint was fresh, but he had originally assumed this Daoist would certainly spout some mystifying "mandate of heaven" theory to argue this fake Great Song was "destined by heaven."

He composed himself, thinking let me hear what you have to say, and asked: "Please enlighten me, Daoist Master."

Cui Hantang felt somewhat smug, thinking Li Suiqiu was shocked by his novel viewpoint. He asked back:

"In your view, how many crises does the Ming nation currently face?"

Li Suiqiu answered without thinking, speaking clearly: "Having traveled and studied in various places, discussing with fellow students and teachers, the Ming faces four current crises: the Eastern Barbarians, the roving bandits, the hair-thieves, and natural disasters."

Cui Hantang thought MMP internally, thinking you didn't have to be so blunt—but also felt somewhat proud, since being listed among "calamities" wasn't an easy thing.

"The Eastern Barbarians and... hmm, let's not discuss that..." Cui Hantang felt awkward. "Those are external threats; even if Tang Taizong and Song Taizu were reborn, external threats would remain. Speaking of the roving bandits, they actually arose from natural disasters."

After natural disasters must come human calamity, especially in an era like late Ming when government relief was weak. Disaster victims could hardly get money and grain to fill their bellies; the only path to survival was revolt. This further expanded the scope of disaster.

This insight wasn't fresh. Li Suiqiu only nodded slightly.

"...Yet speaking of natural disasters, they are also human calamities!"

Cui Hantang then pivoted, throwing out his key conclusion.

But Li Suiqiu across from him showed no surprised expression, instead wearing a look of "I'll just quietly watch you show off." Perhaps worried that his lack of reaction would hurt the Daoist's feelings and end the conversation, Li Suiqiu somewhat reluctantly responded: "Since ancient times, floods, droughts, locusts, and plagues have all been heavenly fate; how can they also be human calamity?"

"Does Master Meizhou know how many commoners the Ming realm currently has?"

"This..." Now Li Suiqiu was stumped. Though the Ming had population statistics, ordinary people rarely accessed specific figures—not for secrecy, just that without media at the time, besides a few scholars and Ministry of Revenue officials, ordinary people didn't care.

Li Suiqiu could certainly produce poetry and prose, and could say something about land taxes, salt administration, and grain transport—practical official matters. But population statistics were outside his knowledge.

"I'm ashamed to say this student doesn't know," Li Suiqiu said. "I would guess tens of millions."

"Hehe, let me tell you: in the sixth year of Tianqi, the Ministry of Revenue audited the realm's Yellow Registers, finding 983,546 households and over 51,655,000 people."

Li Suiqiu nodded silently, thinking these hair-thieves really were well-informed! Even knowing the Yellow Register figures!

"But has the gentleman considered: in the fourteenth year of Hongwu, when Ming Taizu compiled the national Yellow Register, the census found 59,870,000 people—from Hongwu's fourteenth year to Tianqi's sixth year is over 230 years. Though there was the Yongle Emperor's Jingnan Campaign and floods and droughts in between, overall it was still a peaceful era. Why did population decrease rather than increase? Remember, Zhu Yuanzhang founded the nation after decades of chaos at the end of Yuan."

"The figures you cite, this student doesn't know. However, as you yourself said, these are Yellow Register figures—does the gentleman not know Yellow Register figures are the most unreliable?" Though Li Suiqiu hadn't been an official, he wasn't completely ignorant of yamen matters. "Since the Single Whip Reform, all regular levies, assigned duties, capital treasury annual needs and reserves, provisions, and local tribute goods are all combined into one entry, all calculated by mu and paid in silver. Thus taxes and corvée are all based on land, and population growth and decline have little bearing on major accounts. When Yellow Registers are compiled, sometimes there are people without adult males registered, sometimes adult males without people; officials don't inquire and needn't inquire."

"Well said." Cui Hantang thought this young Master Li had quite some knowledge! "Since it is so, clearly during prolonged peace, population multiplies, yet official Yellow Registers don't record it—where have all these commoners gone?"

This question wasn't hard to answer. These unregistered people were either "missed" by officials, or had commended themselves under gentry and powerful families—under the Li family alone, such people numbered quite a few. Merchants without land operating shops counted as his family's "assistants"; those bringing land counted as "tenant farmers." Li Suiqiu himself didn't know how many such sheltered people were under his family's wing, but this was an important source of family income.

"...Surely Master Meizhou himself knows, whether 'missed' or 'sheltered,' these commoners' taxes don't reach the court's pocket—at least most don't."

Li Suiqiu certainly understood this logic. Many people came to "commend" themselves to his family precisely for his Juren degree, which could reduce taxes and exempt grain.

"Master Meizhou is a Juren, so naturally you know a Juren's grain exemption is only six *shi*," Cui Hantang said softly. "How much has actually been exempted—probably only your steward knows."

The meaning in these words was crystal clear: these disappeared populations had mostly commended themselves under powerful gentry, thus evading taxes. Both sides profited; only the court suffered losses.

Li Suiqiu couldn't refute this—it was fact. Though he had long known this systemic corruption, it was universal throughout the realm; he couldn't be exempt. Moreover, as head of a prominent family, he couldn't and wouldn't cut off his own wings and sever this substantial income.

Even with a belly full of knowledge, unless willing to call a deer a horse, he really couldn't argue.

"What the Daoist Master says is correct," Li Suiqiu said. "However, this is systemic corruption; what does it have to do with natural and human calamities?"

Cui Hantang, seeing him stumped, felt much happier. He thought: this dirt really works! Otherwise, debating morality and literature with you, how could I be your match!

"Naturally, the wealthy households and gentry who receive commendations benefit, while the court suffers losses—yet this court has thousands of civil and military officials, hundreds of thousands of soldiers, three thousand palace beauties... to support—and many must be supported well, not making do with chaff and vegetables. Emperor Zhu and his officials can't piss gold or shit silver; where does all this money and grain come from? Scraped from commoners' heads. Originally ten people paid for ten people's taxes; now it becomes seven, six, even five people paying for ten. In peaceful times, everyone muddles through; but encountering floods or droughts, officials have no reserves, commoners have no stored grain, no relief can be given, and commoners can only starve to death. Isn't this human calamity?"

"If this were a hundred years ago, even with land annexation and powerful protection, the court wouldn't suffer too much. The Ming's territory is vast; landless farmers could seek land to cultivate. Over time, wasteland becomes mature fields; the court levies taxes and gains both population and revenue. 'What's lost on the swings is gained on the roundabouts'—that's how they've patched things along. But now, where is there still wasteland to find?"

Though late Ming land development hadn't reached the Qing-era extreme of "nowhere unploughed, everywhere tilled," under the productivity levels of the time, it was already near the limit. From mid-Ming onward, large numbers of landless farmers fleeing taxes had gone to Huguang to cultivate in the mountains, forming large migrant groups. At one point this even sparked massive rebellions. By late Ming, the mountains of Guangdong and Fujian had sizable migrant cultivation groups.

Li Suiqiu knew about land shortage and migrants seeking land everywhere. He secretly sighed; speaking of which, none of this was fresh insight, yet teachers and friends rarely discussed it. But these hair-thieves saw clearly!

"Poor people cultivating everywhere can resolve temporary crises, but plant endless future troubles." Cui Hantang finally reached the meat of the matter. "Master Meizhou surely knows that Guanzhong was once 'fertile land, a thousand miles of rich fields.' What about now? Not to mention beyond the border walls is endless sand desert—even inside the walls, land is barren, nine years of drought in ten. Why is that?"

Now Li Suiqiu was bewildered. Regarding Shaanxi's situation, he had learned a bit when discussing "bandit conditions" with others. Roughly knew this place was drought-prone and disaster-ridden, nine famines in ten years, commoners extremely impoverished, border garrison soldiers no better off, having no choice but to rebel for survival.

Now Cui Hantang's words awakened him: Guanzhong was once the foundation of imperial enterprise. From the First Emperor through Han and Tang, all used Guanzhong as their base, emerging from Hangu Pass to take the realm—how had those thousand miles of fertile fields become this impoverished, bitter cold land?

"This, the student truly hadn't considered. Please enlighten me, Daoist Master."

"Not at all, not at all," Cui Hantang showed a smug expression, then quickly suppressed that vulgar smile. "It's because of cultivation!"

"Cultivation?" Li Suiqiu was puzzled, because since ancient times, cultivation was a policy benefiting nation and people, a win-win for public and private. Whether Han, Tang, or Ming, border armies mostly self-supported through cultivation, reducing the court's burden while obtaining sufficient food supplies. Yet to these hair-thieves, it had become a "harmful policy" that impoverished the land.

Cui Hantang spoke eloquently. Actually, aside from climate change, the destruction of Guanzhong's natural environment was largely human-caused, and human destruction was continuous: Guanzhong had the longest history, longest development period, largest population, and most severe environmental damage. By early Song, the forests of the Zhongnan Mountains had been entirely felled; the forests of Qishan and surrounding mountains were also basically gone. Su Shi, who once served in Fengxiang Prefecture, wrote a poem saying of the Qishan area: Mountains bare as red clay, water murky as rice wash!

Naturally, claiming to be "Song descendants," Cui Hantang wouldn't mention this, concentrating his fire on the Ming.

"Surely the gentleman knows that Ming border army provisions largely rely on military colonization and merchant colonization." As soon as Cui Hantang opened his mouth, Li Suiqiu was slightly surprised. He knew military colonization wasn't rare—all dynasties had it, still ongoing now; but merchant colonization was not only unprecedented from previous dynasties, a Ming innovation, but had also been discontinued for many years. Even scholars of the current dynasty might not know of it.

"Cultivation is a good policy, originally benefiting nation and people. However, establishing one benefit inevitably creates one harm—and this harm is not small."
