# Chapter 1946 - Li Jianai's Secret

To make matters worse, her formal employment situation was also not good: graduates from the College of Arts and Sciences mainly did confidential, accounting, and secretarial work. Li Jianai was no exception. After being assigned to the Tiandihui, she entered the "Key Account Department." This department was not responsible for specific agricultural technology services but for contacting clients who "wholly contracted" their land to the Tiandihui, providing them with services such as reports, accounting, and sales promotion.

For the past few months, Li Jianai had been dispatched to Zhangjia Village near East Gate Market, serving Zhangjia Village and some nearby key accounts. This temporary dispatch was carried out in the form of a team. The work team would be stationed in the key account's farm, working continuously for several months until the busy farming season ended and the accounts of both parties were settled clearly.

She knew Zhangjia Village had a Senatorial background. A Senator named Lu lived in the village for a long time, going in and out by carriage every day.

Although she had served the "organization" for a long time, no matter how reliable the "organization" was, it couldn't compare to serving as a "attendant" directly beside a Chief. For girls from the Maid School, this was the most natural mainstream concept. Although Li Jianai knew her situation was special and she likely wouldn't be chosen by a Chief, and very few classmates had been selected in the past two years, she inevitably still harbored a maiden's romantic thoughts. In the beginning, she was even a bit afraid of being "favored" by this Chief, thinking that losing contact with the "organization" might be an omen.

The reason she felt afraid was that there were some legends in the Maid School. Although they were all "rumors," Li Jianai, having served the Political Security Bureau for many years, could distinguish which were "rumors" and which were "rumors with ulterior motives." A few days after arriving at Zhangjia Village, she felt the atmosphere here was particularly oppressive.

First was the distinction between insiders and outsiders. As a staff member sent by the Tiandihui, Li Jianai lived in a specifically built detached courtyard with the agricultural technicians and mechanics sent by the Tiandihui at the same time, usually unable to contact the people in the village. People who came to contact for business always kept it short, leaving immediately after speaking, not even drinking a mouthful of water. Conversations were strictly business, discussing nothing else.

This style was quite similar to people from the Political Security Bureau. But Li Jianai knew things weren't that simple. Years of working as a "hidden cadre" made her extremely good at observing people's words and actions. She soon saw something in these people's eyes and expressions. That was a strong wariness.

Could it be they know I'm a "hidden cadre," so they harbor such strong wariness?

Secondly, she realized that the Chief distrusted these people from the Tiandihui very much. He never asked them to enter the residence, nor spoke a word to them. All work was arranged through the butler.

However, her worry seemed superfluous. This Chief showed no interest in her whatsoever. Not only did he not see her, he hadn't even spoken to her face-to-face once. Perhaps this avoided the worst scenario, only that it was obvious she wasn't welcomed by the Chief, which naturally couldn't be counted as a good thing.

Contrary to Li Jianai's self-perception: Lu Xuan was extremely interested in her—only it was a vigilant interest.

When Li Jianai reported to Zhangjia Village at the beginning of the year, Lu Xuan felt unhappy. He had always disliked naturalized citizens from the Maid School, feeling they were trained to be too familiar with Senators, lacking a sense of distance and awe. However, he had become more cautious now, rarely sticking his head out. Except for the old people in the village, he no longer took in people, nor sponsored naturalized students. He also significantly reduced contact with those former "disciples" to avoid being caught with leverage.

The fields of Zhangjia Village were contracted to the Tiandihui, so it was natural for the Tiandihui to send people for door-to-door service. Moreover, now that the Maid School had been changed to the College of Arts and Sciences, and the teaching content focused on professional skills such as accounting and secretarial work, he had no reason to oppose this girl being sent by the Tiandihui to work here—he could indeed directly exercise a Senator's right of refusal, but that would be too conspicuous.

He could only seamlessly avoid her contacting people and things in the village as much as possible, shorten the time she hung around here, and send her far away from the village and his people.

Fortunately, he had considered the issue of Tiandihui service personnel coming to the door a few years ago and specially built a detached courtyard for them to live and use—when Tiandihui people weren't coming, some work requiring contact with outsiders was also handled there. Minimizing contact between people inside the residence and outsiders.

On the third day after Li Jianai reported for duty, he found an opportunity to go to the Key Account Department of the Tiandihui, found the person in charge, Dugu Qiuhun, and requested to view Li Jianai's personnel file.

A Senator wanting to access the file of a naturalized citizen with a close working relationship, especially one who would enter the Senator's residence to work, was not an excessive request. Dugu Qiuhun agreed immediately: he pulled out Li Jianai's file and handed it to Lu Xuan.

The file had the common seal on it. The yellow kraft paper file bag was very thin, showing nothing special.

Li Jianai's file was ordinary, without special markings.

"Li Jianai, Female, from Ji'an, Jiangxi, born in 1620 (48th year of Wanli/1st year of Taichang, Gengshen), date unknown"

"1631.9.6 Taken in as an orphan by Guangzhou Station"

"1631.9-1631.11 Refugee in Guangzhou Refugee Camp"

"Performance during relief period..."

"1631.11-1632.2 Refugee in Lingao Quarantine Camp"

"Performance during purification period..."

"1632.10-1635.2 Student at Lingao Women's College of Arts and Sciences"

"Performance during study..."

"1635.2-Present Employee of Tiandihui Key Account Department"

...

There weren't many materials. Lu Xuan looked through them item by item. Historically, there was no confidential content in the file; the content was ordinary: resume, records of transfer, political appraisal, academic transcripts... But Lu Xuan was an old hand at bureaucracy; he saw at a glance that there was a problem with Li Jianai's file. There was an 8-month gap between the end of the quarantine period and enrollment in the Maid School. Back then, the Maid School was different from the National School; admission wasn't by semester, but one could join a class at any time!

He checked the file transfer record again and found from the date of stamping that the file was only transferred from the Quarantine Camp in October 1632. In this way, what Li Jianai was doing during the 8 months from February to October 1632 became very suspicious.

Thinking of this, Lu Xuan felt the hair on his back stand up. He originally just wanted to see how this Li Jianai performed in the Maid School and whether she would bring any bad influence to his lair, also harboring the thought of finding a flaw to drive her away justifiably. But today's discovery made him shudder. This woman obviously had another background! He suppressed his alarm, returned the file to Dugu Qiuhun with a normal expression, forced himself to exchange a few polite words calmly, and then left the Tiandihui.

On the way back to the Great Library, Lu Xuan couldn't help but secretly rejoice at his caution in isolating Li Jianai immediately. Then, he began to get suspicious: Was Li Jianai from the Political Security Bureau? If so, was she intentionally sent to him, or was she just targeting other "key accounts" within Lingao? After all, the liaisons of the Key Account Department rotated. But if she was, or at least partially intentionally sent, then...

Lu Xuan didn't dare to think further. Suddenly he felt very angry: "Treating one's own comrade like this! Might as well make a scene!" Then he considered again, "Inappropriate, inappropriate..." Conducting fierce discussion and struggle in his brain, he walked into the office absent-mindedly.

Calming down, Lu Xuan felt it necessary to further verify. Thinking of this, he called Liu Ziming in and instructed him to find an apprentice he had taught in the Great Library in the past and invite him to dinner at home tonight. This apprentice now worked at the Bairen Second Archives. After the Third Plenary Session, the Senate issued strict restrictions on Senators cultivating private followers among naturalized citizens and indigenous people, so Lu Xuan had restrained himself a lot. However, handing down such a small matter shouldn't be a problem.

The next day, Lu Xuan obtained part of the duty records of the guard room of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences for 1633-1634 excerpted from the archives. The Maid School had strict access control. Under normal circumstances, maid candidates rarely went out, not to mention Li Jianai was an orphan with nowhere to go. But the duty records showed that Li Jianai applied to leave the school for a few days every month. Although the original copy wasn't excerpted, Lu Xuan's apprentice noted that every time she left school, she held an exit permit issued by the school's General Affairs Office.

"Humph, Zhao Manxiong is really cautious." Lu Xuan snorted coldly in his heart. This trick couldn't fool him. At this moment, he was convinced that Li Jianai must be from the Political Security Bureau.

Next was how to handle this matter. Regardless of whether Li Jianai's purpose here included targeting him, having such a person around always made him feel like he had a thorn in his back—especially since when they reported, regardless of the size of the matter, they would report in detail. It was hard to guarantee what might be reported.

After thinking it over, he thought it was better to make a direct phone call. Doing it secretly was naturally possible, but it would only bring him more trouble—if another incident occurred, it was hard to say what would happen.

Who knows how much black material that Zhao Manxiong has compiled on me secretly!

So he didn't intend to blow things up. If it was an unintentional coincidence, then naturally it didn't matter. If it was an intentional arrangement, let them back off in the face of difficulties—to avoid them always thinking about him. He hated this feeling of "being registered."

Wu Mu had gone to Guangzhou, so he called Zhou Botao, the Director of Reconnaissance, in the afternoon. Zhou Botao was very polite. The two exchanged a mysterious and irrelevant obscure conversation on the phone. In short, Director Zhou firmly denied the existence of "reconnaissance" targeting Senators and finally stated that he didn't understand the specific situation and would have the staff in the department verify it. If Senator Lu had opinions on this personnel arrangement, he would step in to coordinate related adjustments. As for how he knew Li Jianai's "hidden cadre" identity, Lu Xuan naturally didn't mention it, and Zhou Botao tacitly didn't ask.
