# Chapter 1805 - Self-Justification

"The so-called revolution is neither a foreign word nor a modern one—its history reaches far back, though I won't belabor the point. In the modern sense, revolution is a profound qualitative transformation produced during the developmental process of nature, society, or thought. Everything we've done since coming to Guangzhou is revolution."

Zhang Yunmi found herself overwhelmed by this cascade of vocabulary and nodded involuntarily.

"Revolution is an extraordinarily complex social movement, filled with measures taken according to expediency, urgency, and delay. There are inevitably reversals, even errors. In the final analysis, governing a city or a country is not a dinner party, nor is it writing an essay. Everything must be viewed from the realistic perspective of social environment and one's own capabilities."

Zhang Yunmi gazed at him with half-understanding, which only made Liu Xiang more self-satisfied.

"We have two purposes in rectifying the customs industry. One is indeed fiscal—by governing and regulating, we capture this enormous gray financial source wandering outside mainstream society and make it 'transparent.' The second is genuinely to 'liberate women.'" Liu Xiang continued, "Juxtaposing these two purposes might seem self-contradictory, but they're actually connected."

The issue of women's liberation wasn't a decision Liu Xiang had made impulsively under Du Wen's influence. In Liu Xiang's view, women's liberation meant first and foremost the liberation of the labor force; secondly, women's liberation would inevitably accelerate the collapse of traditional patriarchal society. Both were extremely beneficial to the Australian Song regime and must be promoted without hesitation. But this work had to proceed gradually—not only because the resistance from ingrained social customs was enormous, but also because the new Guangzhou regime currently lacked cadres, especially women cadres. Thus he could only begin with rectifying the customs industry.

"Is it because rectifying the customs industry encounters the least resistance within traditional society, yet yields particularly large benefits?" Zhang Yunmi ventured.

Liu Xiang nodded. *The child is teachable!*

"Exactly. Even in traditional society, mainstream moral concepts take negative views of the prostitution industry. However corrupt and debauched late Ming social atmosphere may appear—where the Eight Beauties of Qinhuai are celebrated among scholar-officials in seemingly great openness—on the level of overall social morality, prostitution has always been a gray trade."

Therefore, the Senate's ban and rectification of the prostitution industry could claim the banner of "righteousness" across the entire social spectrum. The upper and middle classes would absolutely not leap out to oppose it openly—doing so would immediately blacken their own reputations.

"Despite the disdain directed at the customs industry, the profits involved are impressive. Since ancient times, it has been a coveted piece of meat." Liu Xiang explained, "So any prostitution business requires some form of protection. Look—in the old timeline, most women working as escorts kept so-called 'boyfriends.' These boyfriends were actually disguised 'bodyguards.' Magnify this to a commercial organization like a brothel, and the problem exceeds what one or two thugs can handle. This backing must be both black—local criminal elements—and white—baojia, officials, powerful gentry.

"Even with such backing, the brothel owner cannot be guaranteed safety, because the business itself is inherently unconscionable. It inevitably involves illegal acts: 'forcing respectable women into prostitution,' 'private torture,' 'human trafficking,' 'driving people to death'—even in feudal society, these violate the law. So the protection required is even more powerful. From a certain perspective, their environment is more treacherous than that of ordinary merchants. More 'immortals' receive 'offerings,' and their appetites grow larger. Fail to bribe properly, and anyone can create trouble for you. In the brothel industry, then, the interest channels behind the scenes are extremely complicated."

Zhang Yunmi half-understood, so she simply nodded.

"If we want to purge the various 'immortals' within Guangzhou's walls, we must cut off their financial sources. Not only cut them off—this wealth must be put to our use, or we cannot afford the funds required for such social transformation. Additionally, brothels naturally shelter and harbor various criminals, so we must take down this disaster zone of social governance first."

Having struggled through these half-sincere, half-fabricated words, sweat had appeared on Liu Xiang's forehead. But judging by the effect, he appeared to have successfully impressed the young woman before him.

"It seems administrative work really isn't simple. Decision-making is so complicated!"

"Precisely." Liu Xiang said, "Decision-making must consider not only the goal but also one's own capabilities and positioning. Even goals must be distinguished as short-term, medium-term, or long-term." Unable to continue the bluster, he hurriedly buried his head in the remaining documents.

Having worked through more than half the incoming and outgoing documents on his desk, Liu Xiang noticed that Zhang Yunmi's work was becoming increasingly proficient. Not only were her summaries more concise and to the point, but she could now categorize documents by content and arrange them in order, creating better conditions for his reading. Judging from the current situation, document contents still didn't stray beyond the old three themes: claiming credit, complaining about hardships, and requesting resources.

After the powerful departments had been reinforced with the court system team led by Liang Xinhu, operations had finally become complete and self-consistent, markedly improving recent efficiency. The beggars' aggressive panhandling and extortion—which merchants had complained most bitterly about—had been greatly curbed after the police strengthened daily patrols and held several public trials. Regarding the establishment of "petition police," hints had been dropped at the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and major merchants and guild heads had shown great interest.

The interrogation of several captured leaders from the attack on the Chaoshan Guild Hall, along with detained former yamen runners, had enabled the police system to master considerably more information. The chains entangling Guangzhou Prefecture's original guilds with the underworld had been fully exposed. Mu Min was keenly interested in launching a broader "crackdown on gangs and evil forces." Today, multiple documents from these systems claimed credit and urged further action.

Those complaining about hardships came mainly from personnel working in the countryside. The rural situation was extraordinarily complex. Though the army could collect Reasonable Burden without difficulty wherever it passed, and requisitions for official duties and grain met with obedience, the work teams simply could not "sink down" into the villages. Except for those villages purged during the Pearl River Estuary breakthrough campaign, the remaining communities were tightly controlled by local powers. Moreover, these local forces were predominantly clan organizations with extremely strong cohesion—ordinary divide-and-conquer methods proved nearly useless. Social surveys by work teams could scarcely be completed; even household registration encountered enormous obstacles, essentially recording whatever village elders reported.

Security between villages and towns was poor, with numerous small bandit groups emerging. The National Army could currently control only county seats, large market towns, and transportation hubs—merely "points and lines," unable to secure the broader area. Transportation between more remote villages could hardly guarantee safety without armed escorts. Constraints on personnel and commodity circulation meant many local products couldn't be sold externally while grain couldn't be transported in. Ration shortages and rising grain prices had begun appearing in some localities. Rumors proliferated through the countryside; popular sentiment grew unstable...

The work teams believed it urgent to "seize typical cases," employing violent means to purge and suppress banditry while simultaneously "killing the chicken to scare the monkey" against local powers. Work team members writing reports pointed out that virtually all bandits colluded with local forces.

Liu Xiang drafted work content in his notebook as he read: dispatch cooperatives to the countryside as soon as possible to purchase goods and transport grain in, stabilizing the market; determine how to better coordinate the National Army's bandit suppression operations; address the reorganization and rectification of rural militia forces...

Just then, with a *thump*, the office door was pushed open. Being alone in a room with a young woman, Liu Xiang hadn't locked the door firmly—and generally speaking, no one would court death by barging directly into Great Prefect Liu's office. But "generally" did not include fellow Senators.

Liu Xiang looked up; Zhang Yunmi turned her head. They stared at the figure in the doorway almost simultaneously.

It was a rare visitor: Ding Ding. Following the upper-level reorganization, unfavorable rumors about Ding Ding within the Senator corps had suddenly multiplied. It was said that gossip circulating at maids' tea parties had gradually infiltrated the Senator class proper. This phenomenon naturally attracted the new government's attention and prompted several countermeasures. All Senators were required "not to play pillow talk and palace intrigue games." Meanwhile, certain remarks by his wife Penny had also begun circulating quietly, causing dissatisfaction among many Senators.

Ding Ding, directly employed as a target in all this, had no desire to remain in Lingao attracting attention. After a telegram, he had fled to Guangzhou to "supervise and guide propaganda work in the Guangzhou Liberated Area." His actual main task was organizing the *Yangcheng Express*.

Ding Ding had barged in and, seeing Liu Xiang and Zhang Yunmi together, was at first stunned, then displayed excitement as if discovering big news, then disappointment at not catching any real dirt, and finally something resembling jealousy. In mere moments, his complexion had traversed the entire spectrum. Liu Xiang was also aware that among the dozens of Senators in Guangzhou, many privately discussed his interest in "dining on tender grass." Liu Xiang was indifferent. He set down the documents in his hand and rose to welcome the visitor.

"Minister Ding, what a rare visitor!" Liu Xiang extended his left hand for a handshake—Ding Ding was holding some documents under his right arm, making his right hand obviously inconvenient. "What instructions does the Minister bring? We're all ears!"

Having his conversational initiative seized by Liu Xiang, and with Zhang Yunmi present, Ding Ding could only follow Liu Xiang's prompt and settle onto the guest sofa first. "How would I dare give instructions to Lord Liu! Xiao Qiu from the Propaganda Section is a capable officer I personally selected and sent over. Not only do you refuse to approve the propaganda plans his section produces, but you also strangle their necks and forbid the mobilization of propaganda materials. Old Liu, did Xiao Qiu or our Ministry of Culture and Propaganda offend you? Just give me a straight answer!"

After venting his anger, Ding Ding placed the documents he'd brought on the coffee table beside the guest sofa and pushed them toward Liu Xiang: "I know you address issues not people. I supervised them while they redid this plan. Look it over first, then tell me if you have any concerns!"
