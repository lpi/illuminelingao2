# Chapter 1805: Self-Justification

"The so-called revolution is not a foreign word, nor is it a modern word. Its history is long, so I won't bullshit much. In the modern sense, revolution is a profound qualitative change produced in the process of development of nature, society, or thought—everything we have done since coming to Guangzhou is revolution."

Zhang Yunmi was overwhelmed by this pile of vocabulary and nodded involuntarily.

"Revolution is a very complex social movement, full of measures taken according to expediency, urgency, and delay, and there are even a lot of reversals and even errors. In the final analysis, governing a city or a country is not a dinner party, nor is it writing an essay. Everything must be viewed from the realistic perspectives of social environment and self-ability."

Zhang Yunmi looked at him half-understandingly, which made Liu Xiang even more smug.

"We have two purposes for rectifying the customs industry. One is indeed out of fiscal consideration. By governing and rectifying, we grab this huge gray financial source that is wandering outside the mainstream of society and make it 'transparent'; the second is indeed to 'liberate women'." Liu Xiang said, "Putting these two purposes together might seem somewhat self-contradictory, but there is a connection between them."

The issue of women's liberation was not a decision Liu Xiang made by slapping his head just because he was influenced by Du Wen. In Liu Xiang's view, women's liberation firstly meant the liberation of the labor force, and secondly, women's liberation would inevitably accelerate the collapse of traditional patriarchal society. Both of these were extremely beneficial to the Australian Song regime and must be promoted unsparingly. But women's liberation work must be done step by step—not only because the resistance caused by social habits was too great, but also because the Guangzhou new regime currently lacked cadres, especially women cadres. So he could only start with rectifying the customs industry.

"Is it because rectifying the customs industry encounters the least resistance in traditional society, but the benefits are particularly large?" Zhang Yunmi said.

Liu Xiang nodded. The child is teachable!

"That's right. Even in traditional society, mainstream moral concepts hold negative views on the prostitution industry. Don't look at how extremely corrupt the social atmosphere is at the end of the Ming Dynasty, where the Eight Beauties of Qinhuai are even famous among the scholar-officials, seemingly very open. But on the level of social morality as a whole, prostitution has always been a gray trade."

Therefore, for the ban and rectification of the prostitution industry, the Senate had the title of "righteousness" on the entire social level. The upper and middle classes of society would absolutely not jump out to openly oppose it, otherwise they would directly stink themselves up.

"Don't look at how the customs industry is looked down upon by people, the profits inside are very impressive. Since ancient times, it has been a piece of fat meat." Liu Xiang said, "So any prostitution business needs some kind of protection: Look, in the old timeline, most of those working as misses raised a so-called 'boyfriend'. This boyfriend is actually a disguised 'bodyguard'. Magnified to a commercial organization like a brothel, the problem faced is not something one or two thugs can handle. This backer must be both black—local evil forces, and white—baojia, officials, powerful gentry.

"Even with a backer, the brothel owner cannot be guaranteed to be safe and sound, because the business he engages in is inherently unconscionable, inevitably involving many illegal acts such as 'forcing respectable women into prostitution', 'private torture', 'trafficking in human beings', 'forcing people to death', etc.—even in feudal society, these are violations of the law. So the asylum they need is even more powerful. From a certain perspective, the environment they are in is more sinister than that of ordinary businessmen. There are more 'immortals' receiving 'incense offerings', and their appetites are bigger. Once you fail to bribe properly, anyone can give you trouble. So in the brothel industry, the interest transmission channels behind the scenes are very complicated."

Zhang Yunmi half-understood, so she had to nod.

"If we want to purge the various 'immortals' in Guangzhou city, we have to cut off their financial sources. Not only cut them off, but this wealth must also be used by us—otherwise we cannot afford the funds needed for such social transformation. In addition, brothels are often natural shelters and hiding places for various criminals, so we must take down this disaster area of social governance first."

After finishing these insincere, half-true half-false words with great difficulty, sweat had already appeared on Liu Xiang's forehead. But looking at the effect, it seemed to have bluffed the young girl in front of him.

"It seems that administrative work is really not simple. Decision-making is so complicated!"

"Exactly." Liu Xiang said, "Decision-making must consider not only the goal but also one's own ability and positioning. Even the goal must be considered as short-term, medium-term, or long-term." He couldn't go on bullshitting here, so he hurriedly buried his head and continued processing documents.

Having read more than half of the incoming and outgoing official documents on the desk, Liu Xiang found that Zhang Yunmi's work was becoming more and more in place. Not only were the summaries written more concisely and to the point, but she could also categorize the official documents according to their content and place them in order, creating better conditions for Liu Xiang's reading work. Judging from the current situation, the main content of official documents still did not go beyond the old three items: claiming credit, complaining about hardships, and asking for resources. After the powerful departments joined in with the court system team led by Liang Xinhu, they could finally be complete and self-consistent, so the work efficiency has improved a lot recently. The beggars' forceful begging and extortion, which merchants reacted to most strongly, had been greatly curbed after the police strengthened daily patrols and held several public trials. Regarding the establishment of "petition police," hints had been dropped at the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and major merchants and guild heads showed great interest; the interrogation of several captured leaders in the attack on the Chaoshan Guild Hall and the detained original yamen runners enabled the police system to master more information: the chain entangled between various original guilds in Guangzhou Prefecture and the underworld was fully exposed. Mu Min was full of interest in launching a wider range of "crackdown on gangs and evil forces" operations. Today, multiple official documents were from these systems claiming credit and urging further action.

Those complaining about hardships were mainly the batch working in the countryside: the rural situation was very complicated. Although the army could collect Reasonable Burden without difficulty wherever it passed, and requisitions for official duties and grain were met with obedience, the staff could not "sink down" at all. Except for those villages and towns that were purged during the Pearl River Estuary breakthrough campaign, the rest of the villages and towns were tightly controlled by local forces. Moreover, the local forces here were mostly clan forces with extremely strong cohesion, and ordinary divide-and-conquer methods were almost useless. The social surveys of the work teams could hardly be completed, and even household registration encountered great difficulties; it was basically whatever the village elders said.

The security situation between villages and towns was poor, and a large number of small groups of bandits emerged. The National Army could currently only control county towns, large market towns, and transportation hubs—only "points and lines," unable to control the area. Transportation between more remote villages and towns could hardly guarantee safety without armed escorts. Constraints appeared in the circulation of personnel and commodities; many special products could not be sold externally, grain could not be transported in, and shortages of rations and rising grain prices began to appear in some places. There were many rumors in the countryside, and people's hearts were unstable... The work team believed that it was urgent to "seize typical cases," use violent means to purge, clean up banditry, and simultaneously "kill the chicken to scare the monkey" against local forces—work team members writing reports pointed out that almost all bandits colluded with local forces.

Liu Xiang drafted work content in his notebook while reading: send cooperatives to the countryside as soon as possible to purchase goods, transport grain in, and stabilize the market; how to further coordinate the bandit suppression work of the National Army; the reorganization and rectification of rural militia armed forces...

Just then, with a "thump," the office door was pushed open—after all, being alone in a room with a young girl, Liu Xiang couldn't lock the door very well—generally speaking, no one would seek death by barging directly into Great Prefect Liu's door, but this "generally" did not include another Senator. Liu Xiang looked up, and Zhang Yunmi turned her head; they stared at the person at the door almost simultaneously.

It was a rare visitor: Ding Ding. After the upper-level reorganization, unfavorable rumors about Ding Ding within the Senators suddenly increased. It was said that rumors circulating at the maids' tea parties slowly infiltrated into the interior of the Senator class. This phenomenon naturally attracted the attention of the new government and led to several measures. All Senators were required "not to play pillow talk and palace intrigue games." And at this time, certain remarks by his wife Penny also suddenly began to circulate secretly, causing dissatisfaction among many Senators. Ding Ding, who was directly used as a target, didn't want to stay in Lingao and attract attention, so after a telegram, he ran to Guangzhou to "supervise and guide the propaganda work in the Guangzhou Liberated Area." In fact, the main job was to organize the "Yangcheng Express."

When Ding Ding barged in and saw Liu Xiang and Zhang Yunmi, he was stunned at first, then had a face of excitement at discovering big news, then disappointment at not catching any real dirt, and finally turned into some kind of jealousy. in just a short while, the color of his face had gone through the whole spectrum. Liu Xiang also knew that among the dozens of Senators in Guangzhou, many privately discussed his thoughts of "eating tender grass." Liu Xiang didn't care. He put down the official documents in his hand and got up to welcome him.

"Minister Ding, a rare visitor!" Liu Xiang extended his left hand to shake hands with Ding Ding—Ding Ding was holding some documents under his right arm, making it obviously inconvenient to extend his right hand. "What instructions does the Minister have? We are all ears!"

Having the conversation starter snatched by Liu Xiang, and with Zhang Yunmi present, Ding Ding had to follow Liu Xiang's pull and sit on the guest sofa first. "How dare I give instructions to Lord Liu! Xiao Qiu from the Propaganda Section is a capable general I carefully selected and sent over. Not only do you not approve the propaganda plans made by the section, but you also choke their necks and don't allow the mobilization of propaganda materials. Old Liu, did Xiao Qiu or our Ministry of Culture and Propaganda offend you? Just give me a straight word!" After speaking with anger, Ding Ding put the documents he brought on the coffee table next to the guest sofa and pushed them in front of Liu Xiang: "I know you deal with issues not people. I stared at them while they redid this plan. Take a look first, tell me if you have any ideas!"
