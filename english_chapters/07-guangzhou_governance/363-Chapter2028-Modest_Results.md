# Chapter 2028 - Modest Results

Daoist Cui spoke with flying spittle, and Li Suiqiu felt greatly annoyed, especially as he described the Emperor in such unflattering terms, which shocked him. Yet in his heart, he found much resonance with what was said. He too had many private criticisms of the current Emperor. Particularly regarding several ministers' punishments, among his circle of teachers and friends, many expressed sympathy for them. Not to mention his own teacher, who was punished without cause, receiving court beatings and imprisonment, suffering much torment—had it not been for former classmates and the Empress Dowager interceding, he would have "met his end" long ago.

Li Suiqiu suddenly realized: though this fat man's words were crude and often disjointed, his arguments cut to the heart of matters. Especially the four phrases evaluating the Emperor—"suspicious by nature and fond of close supervision, preferring firmness and prone to anger; close supervision leads to harshness and ingratitude, proneness to anger leads to hasty blunders"—were precise and brilliant, certainly not something this crude-speaking fat Daoist could have composed—nor insight an ordinary scholar of this dynasty could possess.

Some great scholar must have already defected to the hair-thieves—this person not only had exceptional learning but must have served in court.

Thinking this, he couldn't help feeling worried. Naturally, with the hair-thieves' supreme wealth, once able to buy Guangzhou's garrison to hand over the city, buying a few high officials wouldn't be difficult.

Outmatched in skill, even people's hearts gradually drifted away. Li Suiqiu couldn't help secretly grieving.

Originally wanting to debate further with Daoist Cui, he now completely lost interest. Besides, they were already enemy nations—this couldn't be resolved by empty words. Even if he could refute this Daoist into bowing in submission, what good would it do for the current situation? He might even get himself and his whole family implicated.

Unexpectedly, Cui Hantang became even more animated, continuing his outrageous claims: "...Ming's realm was originally in imminent danger. Like a person with illness reaching the vital organs—though complete recovery is impossible, careful treatment could still buy some time, extending life by a few years. Yet observing the court's governance these years, it's precisely like panicked quackery, recklessly using harsh medicines—as they say, throwing hot water to stop boiling, adding fuel to extinguish fire—the path to destruction is well-trodden!" Cui Hantang said bluntly. "Within ten years, roving bandits will certainly enter the capital. At that time, the three armies will open the gates and surrender to the bandits, civil and military officials of the whole city will flee, striking the Jingyang Bell will summon no ministers—there'll be nothing but death, with only a eunuch by his side..."

"Nonsense!" Li Suiqiu could no longer endure this Daoist's wild talk—saying Ming would fall was one thing, but describing the day of destruction so vividly, as if he'd witnessed it himself—he couldn't help refuting: "Though Ming is plagued by war and national affairs are in chaos, Taizu's grace in recreating Chinese civilization endures, and popular sentiment still has its uses. Though the Daoist Master is Australian, an enemy nation of Ming, you needn't speak such alarmist words!"

Cui Hantang laughed "hehe" and said: "Don't be agitated, Master Meizhou. If you say I'm speaking nonsense, then let it be nonsense. However, facts speak louder than words. In less than ten years, we'll see whose words were nonsense."

"This fellow is utterly rude!" Li Suiqiu fumed silently. Still, this visit had been quite educational, especially hearing the discourse on "productive forces supremacy"—basically understanding the hair-thieves' fundamental governing philosophy—simply put, "pursuing profit." No wonder those who'd been to Qiongzhou reported that Australians had "no separation between men and women" and "decadent, extravagant customs."

However, he had no desire to wrangle with this Daoist about these matters. After all, they were enemy nations, and this couldn't be argued right or wrong with a few empty words. Even if he could refute this Daoist into bowing in acknowledgment, what benefit would it bring to the current situation? It might well get himself and his whole family implicated first.

Cui Hantang had originally thought his brilliant discourse would certainly shock this Peony Top Scholar's worldview. Even if he didn't immediately bow in reverence, there should at least be some "admiration." Unexpectedly, despite all his spittle, Li Suiqiu showed no expression at all, maintaining that distant, indifferent tone—making himself seem rather anxious by comparison. He couldn't help feeling annoyed. Yet for his "grand plan," he had no choice but to patiently continue expounding on "the superiority of Australian institutions" and "Ming's systemic problems."

Li Suiqiu actually listened carefully, occasionally asking questions. But just like an infatuated young man chatting with his dream girl on QQ, sending long passages only to receive a few emoticons and "hehe" in return—Cui Hantang could no longer keep going. He had to lower his flag and cease fire.

"MD, these pedants should all be killed! No! All should be sent to dig sand!" Watching the Li brothers' departing figures, Cui Hantang cursed internally. What slightly comforted his heart was that Qingjing had done quite well this time—donations had already reached over five hundred yuan, and many wealthy households, having heard the news, were proactively coming to the temple to "donate." Adding the money Fu Meng had gathered from both Buddhist and Catholic sources, at least a thousand yuan could be collected.

With this thousand yuan in hand, after hosting banquets for Fang Fei, decorating the venue, renovating the new houses... at least half would remain. He could use it to renovate old buildings everywhere. If things went well, the startup funding for his planned Daoist elementary school could also come from this—the Education Bureau people were already surveying Guangzhou, preparing to establish local schools. He had to hurry and get things done while the momentum was hot, so he'd never lack backup talent resources in the future...

"Abbot, the preaching session is about to begin..." a Daoist disciple reported.

"Have them wait a moment, I'll be right there."

"Several new people came today, brought by Master Li Qiushui..."

"No matter who brought them, just serve them tea and don't neglect them."

"Yes."

"Fortunately, not all scholars are so stubborn..." Cui Hantang muttered. He suddenly realized: his united front work with Guangzhou celebrities had been largely unsuccessful. The local young talents he originally planned to recruit—including the Li brothers, painter Zhao Xiangfu, Chen Zizhuang's eldest son Chen Shangyong, Ou Biyuan's eldest son Ou Jiaxian, second son Ou Sixian, Nanhai scholars Dai Zhu, Lü Feixiong, Tao Biao...

Most of these people, under his deliberate cultivation, had some contact with the temple. Given his status as an "Australian Elder," as long as one still planned to live in Guangzhou, they generally wouldn't refuse his invitations. Moreover, his invitations were mostly conducted in religious form, and he was a "Daoist"—semi-civilian—so these scholars had fewer concerns about associating with him.

Yet no matter how he cultivated them or "did ideological work," progress was minimal. On the surface they were very polite, listening to his preaching on Daoist principles and various "popular science," even discussing together, seemingly harmonious and pleasant. But when touching on substantive issues, they always "looked elsewhere and changed the subject," showing no intention whatsoever of "joining the light."

By contrast, poor *tongsheng* and *xiucai* were much more enthusiastic, actively studying and constantly expressing their willingness to "progress" in all aspects. Cui Hantang also held special discussion sessions for them, lecturing and preaching every few days with decent results. But Cui Hantang felt somewhat unsatisfied—he still had an addiction to collecting celebrities and wasn't very interested in those obscure poor scholars.

Now it seemed, no matter how much effort he spent on these "celebrities," at most they'd just go through the motions. After all, these talents mostly came from wealthy families with property, held conservative views, and had no motivation to rebel with the Australians.

At this time, a fine drizzle began falling from the sky, the wind blowing cold. He quickly composed himself, putting on the demeanor of an otherworldly master.

The place where he preached was in the rear hall. Naturally, the scholars who came weren't the "Daoist disciples" studying here. It was more like a loose discussion session. His preaching here wasn't entirely for cultivating talents for the new Daoism—more importantly, it was about winning hearts for the Council of Elders and hosting cultural salons.

Cui Hantang invited everyone to be seated in the east chamber of the rear hall. After Daoist boys served tea, he smiled and asked: "For everyone to come in the rain today, surely you have something to ask?"

Li Qiushui was a poor *xiucai*. Having the most seniority, he stood and said: "Immortal Master Cui, after our last pleasant discussion, I went home and pondered long, finding much reason in what you said. The other day, discussing with villagers, there were some confusing points, so I've come specially to ask. These gentlemen are local talents from nearby villages who, hearing of your profound teachings, came specifically to learn."

Cui Hantang thought: "Last time's criticism of Confucianism probably shocked them too much—oh well, there are several good prospects here. Though their examination credentials are lacking and they're completely unknown, they're reasonably clever and capable. I need to rally my spirits and impress them, to take on a few more direct disciples..."

He immediately rallied his spirits and began expounding on the profound mysteries of the Great Dao:

"...The Dao is the fundamental principle by which the universe operates and all things are born and perish, containing two layers of meaning.

"First, the Dao is the realm of our thoughts—that is, dialectical analysis of thinking teaches us how to solve problems! This thing cannot make one immortal; it teaches us how to elevate our thoughts from the material world of desires to the spiritual realm, thereby liberating our thinking from the burden of greed for power and profit. Cultivation is to keep an aware heart. If one understands the meaning of cultivation, having a pure heart amid the mortal world is the highest realm. Of course, meditation, reading, and thinking can accelerate progress; wearing robes and chanting Buddha's name is affinity cultivation, using external environment to reinforce our mental focus. If one can understand, everything becomes a tool for cultivation.

"The purpose of cultivation is to brighten our eyes, purify our hearts—not vegetarianism and chanting, not eliminating the seven emotions and six desires, but learning to control cravings, understanding our desires, gaining some wisdom—certainly not leaving life behind. Most of cultivation time is in the ordinary, accumulating understanding of life bit by bit in daily living, perceiving the greatness of life in trivial details. True hardship isn't the suffering during meditation, but constantly maintaining the pursuit of truth. Behind every worry and suffering, still being able to maintain pursuit of ideals and life's truth—that is the best cultivation."
