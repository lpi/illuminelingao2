# Chapter 2028 - Modest Results

Daoist Cui spoke with spittle flying, and Li Suiqiu felt profoundly vexed, particularly as he characterized the Emperor in such unflattering terms—shocking to witness. Yet within his heart, he discovered considerable resonance with these assertions. He too harbored numerous private criticisms of the current Emperor. Particularly regarding several ministers' punishments, among his circle of teachers and friends many expressed sympathy. Not to mention his own teacher, punished without justification, subjected to court beatings and imprisonment, enduring considerable torment. Had it not been for former classmates and the Empress Dowager interceding, he would have "met his end" long since.

Li Suiqiu suddenly perceived: though this corpulent man

's words proved crude and frequently disjointed, his arguments penetrated to the core of matters. Especially the four phrases evaluating the Emperor—"suspicious by nature and fond of micromanagement, preferring severity and prone to fury; micromanagement breeds harshness and ingratitude, proneness to rage generates hasty errors"—possessed precision and brilliance, certainly not compositions this crude-speaking fat Daoist could have authored, nor insights ordinary contemporary scholars could possess.

Some great scholar must have already defected to the hair-thieves—this individual not only possessed exceptional learning but must have served at court.

Contemplating this, he could not suppress rising concern. Naturally, given the hair-thieves' supreme wealth, having purchased Guangzhou's garrison to surrender the city, purchasing several high officials would present no difficulty.

Outmatched in capability, even popular sentiment gradually drifted away. Li Suiqiu could not prevent secret grief.

Originally intending to debate further with Daoist Cui, he now completely forfeited interest. Besides, they represented enemy nations—this could not be resolved through empty rhetoric. Even could he refute this Daoist into submissive acknowledgment, what benefit would it confer upon current circumstances? He might well implicate himself and his entire household first.

Unexpectedly, Cui Hantang grew even more animated, continuing his outrageous pronouncements: "Ming's realm originally stood in imminent peril. Like an individual with illness reaching vital organs—though complete recovery proves impossible, careful treatment could still purchase time, extending life by several years. Yet observing the court's governance these years, it precisely resembles panicked medical malpractice, recklessly employing harsh medicines. As the saying goes: pouring boiling water to halt boiling, adding fuel to extinguish flames—the path to destruction is well-trodden!" Cui Hantang spoke bluntly. "Within ten years, roving bandits will certainly enter the capital. At that moment, the three armies will open gates and surrender to bandits, civil and military officials throughout the city will flee, striking the Jingyang Bell will summon no ministers—nothing will remain but death, with solely a eunuch by his side."

"Nonsense!" Li Suiqiu could no longer tolerate this Daoist's wild discourse. Claiming Ming would fall represented one matter, yet describing the destruction day so vividly, as though he had personally witnessed it—he could not restrain refutation: "Though Ming suffers from warfare and national affairs descend into chaos, Taizu's grace in recreating Chinese  civilization endures, and popular sentiment retains utility. Though the Daoist Master represents Australia, an enemy nation of Ming, you need not voice such alarmist declarations!"

Cui Hantang laughed heartily. "Do not grow agitated, Master Meizhou. If you claim I speak nonsense, then let it be nonsense. However, facts speak more eloquently than words. In less than ten years, we shall witness whose words constituted nonsense."

"This fellow proves utterly discourteous!" Li Suiqiu fumed silently. Nevertheless, this visit had proven quite educational, particularly hearing discourse on "productive forces supremacy"—fundamentally grasping the hair-thieves' core governing philosophy: simply stated, "pursuing profit." No wonder those who had visited Qiongzhou reported that Australians maintained "no separation between men and women" and "decadent, extravagant customs."

However, he possessed no appetite for wrangling with this Daoist regarding such matters. After all, they represented enemy nations, and this could not be adjudicated right or wrong through empty words. Even could he refute this Daoist into bowing acknowledgment, what advantage would it confer upon present circumstances? It might well implicate himself and his entire household first.

Cui Hantang had originally anticipated his brilliant discourse would certainly shock this Peony Top Scholar's worldview. Even lacking immediate reverential submission, there should manifest at minimum some "admiration." Unexpectedly, despite all his expended spittle, Li Suiqiu displayed no expression whatsoever, maintaining that distant, indifferent deportment—rendering himself rather anxious by comparison. He could not suppress annoyance. Yet for his "grand design," he possessed no alternative but to patiently continue expounding "Australian institutional superiority" and "Ming's systemic pathologies."

Li Suiqiu actually listened attentively, occasionally posing questions. Yet precisely like an infatuated youth conversing with his dream companion on QQ, transmitting lengthy passages only to receive several emoticons and "hehe" responses—Cui Hantang could no longer persevere. He had to lower his banner and cease hostilities.

"Damn it, these pedants should all face execution! No! All should be dispatched to excavate sand!" Observing the Li brothers' departing figures, Cui Hantang cursed internally. What slightly consoled his spirit was that Qingjing had performed admirably this occasion—donations had already exceeded five hundred yuan, and numerous wealthy households, having received intelligence, were proactively approaching the temple to "donate." Adding funds Fu Meng had gathered from Buddhist and Catholic sources, at minimum one thousand yuan could be collected.

With this thousand yuan secured, after hosting banquets for Fang Fei, decorating the venue, renovating the new residences... at least half would remain. He could employ it to renovate antiquated structures everywhere. If circumstances proceeded favorably, startup funding for his planned Daoist elementary school could likewise derive from this—the Education Bureau personnel were already surveying Guangzhou, preparing to establish local schools. He had to accelerate completion while momentum persisted, ensuring perpetual access to backup talent resources henceforth.

"Abbot, the preaching session approaches commencement..." a Daoist disciple reported.

"Have them wait momentarily. I shall arrive presently."

"Several new individuals attended today, brought by Master Li Qiushui."

"Regardless who brought them, simply serve tea and demonstrate no negligence."

"Yes."

"Fortunately, not all scholars prove so obstinate..." Cui Hantang muttered. He suddenly recognized: his united front endeavors with Guangzhou celebrities had achieved largely unsuccessful outcomes. The local young talents he originally planned recruiting—including the Li brothers, painter Zhao Xiangfu, Chen Zizhuang's eldest son Chen Shangyong, Ou Biyuan's eldest son Ou Jiaxian, second son Ou Sixian, Nanhai scholars Dai Zhu, Lü Feixiong, Tao Biao...

Most of these individuals, under his deliberate cultivation, maintained some contact with the temple. Given his status as "Australian Elder," provided one still planned residing in Guangzhou, they generally would not refuse his invitations. Moreover, his invitations proceeded mostly through religious forms, and he represented a "Daoist"—semi-civilian—therefore these scholars harbored fewer concerns about associating with him.

Yet regardless how he cultivated them or "conducted ideological work," progress proved minimal. Superficially they demonstrated considerable politeness, listening to his Daoist principle preaching and various "popular science" expositions, even participating in discussions, seemingly harmonious and pleasant. Yet when touching substantive issues, they invariably "gazed elsewhere and changed subjects," manifesting absolutely no intention of "joining the light."

By contrast, impoverished *tongsheng* and *xiucai* demonstrated far greater enthusiasm, actively studying and consistently expressing willingness to "progress" across all dimensions. Cui Hantang likewise organized special discussion sessions for them, lecturing and preaching every several days with respectable results. Yet Cui Hantang felt somewhat dissatisfied—he still possessed an addiction to collecting celebrities and lacked substantial interest in those obscure destitute scholars.

Presently it appeared, regardless how much effort he invested in these "celebrities," at maximum they would merely perform perfunctory gestures. After all, these talents mostly originated from prosperous families possessing property, held conservative perspectives, and lacked motivation to rebel alongside the Australians.

At this juncture, fine drizzle commenced falling from the heavens, wind blowing cold. He swiftly composed himself, adopting the demeanor of an otherworldly master.

The preaching location occupied the rear hall. Naturally, attending scholars differed from "Daoist disciples" studying here. It resembled more a loose discussion assembly. His preaching here served not entirely for cultivating New Daoism talents—more importantly, winning hearts for the Council of Elders and hosting cultural salons.

Cui Hantang invited everyone to be seated in the east chamber of the rear hall. After Daoist attendants served tea, he smiled inquiringly: "For everyone to arrive amid rain today, surely you possess matters to inquire?"

Li Qiushui represented a destitute *xiucai*. Possessing greatest seniority, he stood and spoke: "Immortal Master Cui, following our previous pleasant discussion, I returned home and contemplated extensively, discovering considerable reasonability in your statements. Recently, while discussing with villagers, certain confusing points emerged, consequently I have come specifically to inquire. These gentlemen represent local talents from nearby villages who, hearing of your profound teachings, came expressly to learn."

Cui Hantang thought: "Previous criticism of Confucianism likely shocked them excessively. Oh well, several promising prospects exist here. Though their examination credentials prove deficient and they lack complete recognition, they possess reasonable cleverness and capability. I must rally my spirits and impress them, accepting several additional direct disciples."

He immediately rallied his faculties and commenced expounding the profound mysteries of the Great Dao:

"The Dao constitutes the fundamental principle by which the universe operates and all phenomena are born and perish, containing dual layers of meaning.

"First, the Dao represents the realm of our thoughts—namely, dialectical analytical thinking teaches us problem-solving methodology! This cannot confer immortality; it teaches us how to elevate our thoughts from the material world of desires toward the spiritual realm, thereby liberating our thinking from burdens of greed for power and profit. Cultivation means maintaining an aware heart. If one comprehends cultivation's meaning, possessing a pure heart amid the mortal world constitutes the highest realm. Naturally, meditation, reading, and contemplation can accelerate progress. Wearing robes and chanting Buddha's name represents affinity cultivation, employing external environment to reinforce our mental focus. If one comprehends, everything becomes a cultivation tool.

"Cultivation's purpose involves brightening our eyes, purifying our hearts—not vegetarianism and chanting, not eliminating seven emotions and six desires, but learning to control cravings, understanding our desires, acquiring wisdom—certainly not abandoning life. Most cultivation time transpires in the ordinary, accumulating life understanding bit by bit in daily existence, perceiving life's greatness in trivial details. True hardship constitutes not suffering during meditation, but constantly maintaining truth-seeking pursuit. Behind every worry and suffering, still maintaining pursuit of ideals and life's truth—that represents optimal cultivation."
