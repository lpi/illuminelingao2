# Chapter 2030 - The Microscope

Though Li Qiushui was merely a *tongsheng*, his family had some property, and his forebears had collected books during prosperous times. After coming of age, he traveled extensively doing business to support the family. He had seen more than most. He hesitantly asked: "Master's tricks are indeed exquisite, this student is impressed. However, those with Daoist arts have existed in every dynasty, yet I've never seen anyone stabilize a nation with Daoist arts. Master's claim that 'Australia strengthened its nation through Daoist arts'—I have never heard of such a thing."

Cui Hantang said proudly: "The formless Great Dao gives birth to heaven and earth; the emotionless Great Dao moves the sun and moon; the nameless Great Dao nurtures all things. Below heavenly Dao are forty-eight thousand gates—some for crafts, some for farming, some for commerce, some for governance, even chess, calligraphy, painting, and daily necessities can all enter the Dao. Mastering one gate is enough for a lifetime. What you've seen are merely superficial tricks like what I performed—they don't count as truly 'attaining the Dao.'"

Hearing this, Li Qiushui said curiously: "According to the Daoist Master, could it be that all Australian Elders are those who have attained the Dao? May I ask what Dao the Master cultivates, and have you attained it?"

Cui Hantang said bashfully: "This poor Daoist is unworthy; I cultivate the Dao of teaching. The true Great Dao is profound and subtle; for mortals to gain even a little insight over a lifetime is already great fortune. I have merely just entered the gate—how would I dare claim to have attained the Dao?"

A scholar beside them quickly said: "May I ask, Daoist Master, this student also admires the Dao but cannot find the entrance. Can the Daoist Master teach me?"

Cui Hantang smiled: "The Great Dao is impartial—how can it be hoarded as one's own treasure! However, to seek the true Dao, one must first understand one's 'original heart'—that is, the heart that determines one's attitude toward life while living in this world. From this original heart, traveling through the world creates 'impulses,' through which one determines which gate of heavenly Dao to pursue. Once determined to cultivate this Dao, one must have the determination to break through worldly constraints, let go of material interests, advance bravely and diligently, observe carefully, hypothesize boldly, verify cautiously, and summarize earnestly. With such great determination and perseverance, one can achieve something. Of course, determination and perseverance alone aren't enough to truly enter the Dao—one also needs: teacher, method, resources, companions, place, and instruments. Then comes the slow grinding work."

Li Qiushui said: "I've heard that studying the Dao requires method, resources, companions, and place. 'Teacher' is also understandable—after all, the master leads the way, but cultivation depends on oneself. But what does 'instruments' mean?"

Cui Hantang answered: "The Great Dao is profound and subtle; its depth is sometimes beyond human power; its subtlety is invisible to mortal eyes. At such times, one must use instruments to aid cultivation; without them, progress in the Dao is difficult."

Just as they were talking, someone reported that Shi Tong'an had arrived.

This Shi Tong'an was a disciple of Venerable Master Hanshan, the former abbot of the famous Guangzhou temple Guangxiao Temple.

The monks of Guangxiao Temple were all followers of Venerable Hanshan. During his lifetime, Hanshan advocated active worldly engagement, broadly befriending secular officials and celebrities, from royal princes and nobles down to county gentry. He preached Buddhist dharma while discussing poetry and governance; interpreted Confucianism through Buddhism while using Confucianism to promote Buddhism—hence later generations called him a "political monk."

Hanshan encouraged Buddhist disciples to actively participate in worldly affairs, to follow Confucian ethics and morality. Hanshan said: "What is called the human way is the way of ruler and minister..." Academically, Hanshan proposed the thesis that "emptiness is not absolute nothingness," believing that "all is empty" doesn't exist—the Buddhist concept of "emptiness" should serve reality in a detached yet engaged manner.

Though there were criticisms of his faction's preoccupation with "worldly affairs" from both within Buddhism and outside, clearly this was quite beneficial for Buddhism's survival and development. And such a philosophy was particularly suitable for the Council of Elders. Shortly after entering the city, the Guangxiao Temple abbot actively approached the Council of Elders, effectively becoming the spokesperson for Guangzhou's Buddhist community.

Such activists Cui Hantang naturally cultivated assiduously. After becoming a trustee, guided by Daoism's principle of "the superior person doesn't contend; govern through non-action," he proposed the policy of "three teachings as one family, common development, shelving disputes, advancing and retreating together." He united Guangzhou's religious communities into a considerable force—satisfying the Council of Elders' goal that "religious communities cannot own means of production" while stripping away industries, yet protecting some small and medium temples' religious lineage and properties—thus earning considerable prestige among local religions. Shi Tong'an also frequently visited.

This time, Fu Meng coming to Guangxiao Temple to "squeeze funding," having the Buddhist community "donate as they wished," puzzled the abbot—Cui Hantang rarely solicited money so directly. The abbot suspected this Daoist Cui might have some personal expenses, so he sent Shi Tong'an, who frequently visited, to "pay respects" and probe the situation. If there really was a need, they might as well offer something privately.

As for why Guangxiao Temple was so deferential to Cui Hantang, even wanting to send money proactively—it was truly forced by circumstances. Because after this Daoist Cui arrived in Guangzhou, he talked extensively about "old and new integration" and "religious reform." Using this pretext, he had actually brought Guangzhou's Daoist community completely under his control. Though many temples' lineages still existed and abbots remained in office, they had effectively become appendages of the new Daoism—within a few generations of abbots, they would probably transform completely.

The abbot feared the Australians might also impose a "new Buddhism," so he fawned over Cui Hantang, precisely so that someday there would be an Elder who could speak for Guangzhou's Buddhist community, providing some room for maneuver.

Shi Tong'an had just entered and, seeing this lively scene, knew Daoist Cui was conning scholars again. He had visited Five Immortals Temple many times and knew this Elder Daoist had "great ambitions"—not only running a school in the temple to train Daoists but also actively recruiting scholars. Not only frequently meeting with famous local Confucian scholars, but even cultivating this group of "poor pedants" with sincere engagement.

"You bald head arrived just in time," Cui Hantang was looking for an opportunity to show off and, seeing Shi Tong'an arrive, thought this was perfect—"one sheep to herd, two sheep to tend"—a good chance to enlighten this monk too, showing him the Council of Elders' "Daoist arts."

"I was just about to show everyone a treasure. This object, cultivated to the extreme, can glimpse the secrets of creation. Though this one is only the most basic and elementary, it can still show everyone things invisible to mortal eyes."

His mysterious words naturally aroused everyone's interest, and they all requested to see it. Shi Tong'an had originally wanted to probe why Daoist Cui was soliciting money recently, but now it wasn't convenient to ask, so he could only smile and say he too wished to see.

Cui Hantang then ordered his disciples to bring a mysterious treasure from the rear hall. They saw an object with a stand, between which stood a round tube somewhat resembling a Western telescope. No one knew what it was. Cui Hantang smiled: "This is called a microscope. I've recently been teaching Daoist disciples to recognize the microscopic structure of things. This object can not only see the composition of all things clearly but also observe tiny creatures. Please take a look."

This microscope was manufactured by Lingao's optical instrument factory—those brought from the old timeline were Grade 1 controlled items, not available to "non-scientific research and production" organizations like the new Daoism, even for Elders like Cui. So he had to make do with this "special supply" personally manufactured by Lin Hanlong.

In terms of performance, this microscope couldn't even match the level of the crummiest student microscope from the old timeline; strictly speaking, it could only be called a "toy." But its performance was already much better than what Leeuwenhoek invented back in the day.

Cui Hantang produced a box of biological specimens and fetched some water, saying: "Come, come, everyone take a look one by one."

Though none of them understood what microscopic structure meant, they all crowded around curiously to look. Cui Hantang adjusted the focus and reflector, placed the glass slides, and guided several people to observe plant leaf cells, mosquitoes, mites, paramecia, and other things. Everyone was amazed, gaining a more intuitive understanding of Australian learning and this "art of instruments."

Shi Tong'an bowed deeply with palms together: "Amitabha, thank you, benefactor, for letting me view this divine instrument. The Buddha said 'infinitely small within, infinitely large without. A drop of water contains eighty-four thousand creatures. Three thousand great thousand worlds'—and also said 'the human body is like a house, with countless beings dwelling within.' Before, with mortal eyes, I even doubted the dharma. Today, seeing this, I know the Buddha spoke truth—it was only my own insufficient cultivation. My understanding of the dharma has deepened another layer. Excellent indeed, excellent!"

Cui Hantang hadn't expected his science lesson could be twisted to cite Buddhist scriptures—he couldn't help but laugh and cry. Though Cui Hantang explained the microscope's principles, no one was interested in listening, only gathering around the microscope to look and marvel.

They didn't reluctantly depart until nearly dusk.

But Shi Tong'an didn't leave. He still wanted to probe Cui Hantang's true purpose for "holding rituals to collect money." After pondering a moment, he said: "Chief Fu came to our humble temple a few days ago, mentioning Benefactor Zhang's matter of holding rituals..."

"I know about that," Cui Hantang said casually, wondering if this monk regretted the money and wanted to bargain. If so, negotiations should happen before paying—who comes to haggle after paying?

"This collective wedding is a blessed affair that benefits human relationships. Benefactor Zhang holding rituals for it is also planting good karma." Shi Tong'an watched Cui Hantang's expression. "Though we are Buddhist disciples, Daoism and Buddhism are one family; being able to participate in this occasion is fortunate. Daoist Cui's merit is immeasurable—our humble temple from top to bottom all admire you..."

These words confused Cui Hantang, wondering why this specific visit to express loyalty?

Shi Tong'an, seeing Cui Hantang looking puzzled and not picking up his meaning, grew anxious. Finally, he spoke plainly: "I wonder if, besides this matter, Daoist Cui has anywhere else our humble temple could help? Whether public or private, our humble temple will serve with all our might."

Now Cui Hantang finally understood—so that's what the monk meant!

"These monks certainly know their place!" Cui Hantang couldn't help developing more fondness for Shi Tong'an and his ilk. Naturally, as an Elder, he had no interest in such offerings. But people rarely have resistance to flattery. He laughed: "You bald head! So obsequious! What could I possibly need money for? Wine and mistresses?"

Shi Tong'an smiled along: "The Daoist Master jests. It's simply that I see since the Daoist Master entered the city, there's been no day when you haven't worked for both our Daoist and Buddhist communities—your merit is truly immeasurable. Even if you wished for some enjoyment, that would only be appropriate."
