# Chapter 1743: Six Veins Canal

There was a simple method, which was to use the Guangzhou map of another time-space as a blueprint. Comparing it with the Guangzhou map drawn by the City Operation Department, for those without specific names, use modern place names from roughly the same locations to name the streets and alleys one by one. In this way, many nameless small roads and alleys roughly had names. However, when Lin Baiguang from the Comprehensive Governance Office executed specific instructions, he still proposed to try to "follow the customs of the host" as much as possible. If the surrounding residents had customary names, there was no harm in using them.

Lin Baiguang was busy with people for several days before finally settling the street and alley names. The road signs and house numbers used tinplate, all with blue characters on a white background. His plan was to nail road signs and house numbers while conducting household surveys to build household registers. Before he could arrange this matter properly, Liu Xiang called him over again.

"Old Lin, currently the situation of demolition of illegal structures in our Guangzhou allows for no optimism..."

"Just say it, what new plan do you have? Don't stand on ceremony." Lin Baiguang said.

"The illegal structures on Chengxuan Street are finished demolishing, but there are still quite a few similar places in the whole city. It is naturally very easy to engage in a campaign-style demolition, but we have to consider long-term management." Liu Xiang first spoke some polite words, "So I am considering whether to conduct a real estate registration taking the opportunity of household census registration this time?"

"Real estate registration?" Lin Baiguang thought for a moment, "This is indeed needed. The problem is that real property rights are quite complex, requiring original materials..."

"The original materials are available." Liu Xiang said, "The archive repositories of Guangzhou Prefecture and County levels have original house deeds and land deeds. I retrieved and read a few copies, and the records are still relatively clear. According to the retained household clerks, theoretically, every family owning a house will keep house deeds and land deeds themselves. We can conduct real estate property rights re-registration based on this."

"But this isn't an urgent task, right." Lin Baiguang felt that although demolishing illegal structures was a good thing, it might not be very urgent, "Our demolition work on the main roads has already unfolded successively, and the resistance is not big. Clean up the demolition on several main roads in the city, smooth out the traffic. As for the demolition of general residential houses and shops, we can do it slowly, don't rush to eat into a fat man in one bite."

"Old Lin, I'm also forced by helplessness." Liu Xiang sighed heavily, "You know, in our plan, besides demolition, there is also the work of cleaning the urban sewers. You also know that the 'Return South Days' (humid season) are coming soon."

Guangzhou underwent a comprehensive renovation of sewers in the 1950s. Before the excavation of East Lake, due to the geographical environment of the city, it suffered from urban waterlogging. Moreover, every year as soon as March passed, it was the so-called "Return South Days," during which there was often light rain or heavy fog. It was the first test for the urban drainage system before entering the flood season.

Having been in Guangzhou for several years, Lin Baiguang naturally knew the severity of the Return South Days. He nodded.

"I long heard people say that Guangzhou has the Six Veins Canal drainage system. However, I gathered the retained clerks and runners these few days and personally visited, and the result is very unoptimistic." Liu Xiang casually pulled over a map, "No one can explain clearly the direction of the Six Veins Canal!"

The Six Veins Canal, as the name implies, is a drainage system composed of six river canals. It originated from the six natural and artificial river creeks in Guangzhou City during the Song Dynasty, utilizing the natural terrain of Guangzhou City which is high in the north and low in the south to form a river-channel style drainage system. It has both drainage functions and transportation benefits; some channels even have water supply uses. However, this system had undergone great changes in the Ming Dynasty.

After several large-scale expansions and reconstructions in the Ming Dynasty, the unification of the three cities and the construction of the southern city caused great damage to the original natural water system in the city. Natural rivers and lakes including Winxi Stream and Ancient West Lake gradually silted up and evolved into pure drainage channels. Since the traffic function in the city was basically lost, residents began to gradually encroach on the river channels, and gradually the open channels became hidden channels (culverts). If the Six Veins Canal still maintained the appearance of past "river creeks" in the early Ming Dynasty, capable of navigating boats besides drainage; then by the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Six Veins Canal had mostly become hidden channels. The fact that a large number of Guangzhou citizens hid in the Six Veins Canal to take refuge and were drowned by floodwaters during the Qing army massacre at the end of the Ming Dynasty shows that the past river canals were already hidden channels at this time.

Open channels became hidden channels, and houses were built on top of hidden channels. The result was that when they entered the city, the specific locations and directions of most open ditches and hidden channels in the city were buried under large tracts of houses, becoming a mystery faced by the Senators in Guangzhou.

The most typical one was where exactly the sixth vein of the Six Veins Canal was; it had been an unsolved case since the Ming Dynasty. Whether it was the dredging in the late Ming or before the mid-Qing Dynasty, there was no trace of the sixth vein. Tan Qinghai, a native of Dongguan in the early Wanli period not far from the transmigrators, wrote "Explanation of Six Veins," which only contained records of five veins.

Liu Xiang's understanding of the Six Veins Canal roughly came from the records of this predecessor—as for the hundreds of textual research papers and monographs on the Six Veins Canal in the Great Library, the basic basis all came from this.

"I went around the city these few days. saw quite a few open channels, and also saw a few hidden channels. But asking the clerks and runners, unexpectedly not a single person knew the detailed distribution of drainage channels in the city." Liu Xiang shook his head, "Although I didn't study water supply and drainage, looking at the current situation, I probably know that things like building houses on open channels like on Chengxuan Street are quite common in Guangzhou City."

"So..." Lin Baiguang then understood his intention. He knew that even in the Great Ming, encroaching on river canals to build houses and building houses on top of hidden channels was prohibited. The government couldn't possibly issue land deeds and house deeds for this kind of building; they were illegal structures as a matter of course.

To figure out the location and direction of channels in the city, and to clean the ditches and canals, it was fundamentally impossible without tearing down the illegal structures covering them.

"Right, that's my idea." Liu Xiang said, "It's not very difficult to figure out the location and direction of the Six Veins Canal—we have historical materials left by the ancients and clerks and laborers who have handled dredging. But the drainage of the entire Guangzhou is not just the Six Veins Canal; it also has many open ditches and hidden ditches. This system is not recorded in detail in historical records. We have to find it out ourselves—not only find it out, but also as soon as possible."

Liu Xiang's worry was not without reason. Liu San, who served as the head of health and medical care in Guangdong, had already entered the city a few days ago. After roughly looking around the city, he warned that if a large-scale hygiene campaign was not taken as soon as possible, once the Return South Days arrived, a large-scale outbreak of infectious diseases in the city would be inevitable.

"Alright, I'll try my best to handle it well!" Lin Baiguang nodded, "My current idea is that we walk on two legs. First, you issue a notice informing the whole city to 'self-demolish within a time limit' for illegal structures—with the current momentum, many families will probably do it themselves; second is to take the opportunity of household registration to conduct household surveys to find out the situation of illegal structures."

Liu Xiang sent away Lin Baiguang and instructed Little Zhang to send a telegram to Lingao, asking when the Director of the Guangzhou Police Bureau could be in place. Then he instructed someone to call Jia Jue over.

Jia Jue was still yawning when he came in—yamen clerks like them who had done old errands had never experienced such high-intensity work day and night. Checking in at the yamen early in the morning to handle errands, and not dispersing until the watch started at night. This was still them; if it were the "Fake Short Hairs" (naturalized citizens) brought by the Chief from Qiongzhou Prefecture, they were still busy when they left. According to the retained cleaning laborers, working all night was a common occurrence.

In ancient local yamens, since the government basically didn't undertake much social management function, affairs were quite leisurely. The key for clerks to handle errands was "conforming to precedents," that is to say, public affairs mainly depended on the clerks' familiarity with mastering various old rules and "ministerial precedents." A clerk like Jia Jue, although incomparable to the majestic Division Scribe who could not come to the yamen to check in and directly command disciples to handle errands in tea houses or at home, also had very little time at the yamen every day, mostly just coming to check in. Even if there were errands to do, they would disperse after noon.

The work style of the Australians, inquiring into everything big or small, really made Jia Jue and this group of old clerks unable to bear it.

However, unable to bear it, they still had to hold on. The wind outside was getting tighter and tighter. Those who used to eat the yamen rice were all jittery one by one, fearing being reported and falling into the prison to be "interrogated" by former colleagues. He heard that Zhen Haoren, the Scribe of the Household Division of this prefecture, had "died of illness in prison"—hearing the Soap Class people vaguely rumor that he was "tortured to death." It was said that according to his confession, a total of nearly one hundred thousand taels of silver were confiscated—this figure made him suck in a breath of cold air. Didn't expect Zhen Haoren to be so rich! He didn't dare to think too much now. Only by desperately handling errands to please the new master could there be a place for the whole family to live safely.

These days, Prefect Liu had been investigating the drainage channels of the whole city. Jia Jue was busy before and after: finding laborers, searching for archives, and leading the way to look at the situation alongside several main channels. However, he couldn't help much in this matter.

Like many professional jobs in old-style yamens, the "Canal Map" of Guangzhou was also in private hands. Just as a Fish Scale Book became the cash cow of household division clerks, the Canal Map was also a secret not passed down. This "Canal Map" was in the hands of a hereditary laborer head. Whenever it was time to clear ditches and repair canals—according to old rules, clear ditches every year, repair every three years—money had to be spent to make him take out the Canal Map for positioning. Which section to clear, he would take out those few pages, and take them back immediately after finishing. It was tantamount to a hereditary patent, so although this laborer head was named a laborer, he actually didn't work. On weekdays, he also lived a pampered life. In recent years, although the government rarely cleared ditches and canals, when the folks sometimes had silted ditches to clear, they still had to ask him for advice—naturally, money had to be spent too.

Clearly a map book made by the government, it finally degenerated into a private "family secret." This was also one of the many strange things Liu Xiang encountered after arriving in this time-space.

Finding the Canal Map shouldn't be a difficult thing. Even the more valuable Fish Scale Books were found by the Australians now—once grabbed into the big prison and clamped with three wooden torture instruments, any kind of hero had to speak. But the laborer head had disappeared. Jia Jue took people to look for him, but the building was already empty.
