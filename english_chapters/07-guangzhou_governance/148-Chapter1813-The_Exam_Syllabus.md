# Chapter 1813 - The Exam Syllabus

"You don't need to look at Former Song materials. What the chiefs bring is unlike anything in three thousand years. Take just the police work I do—has any dynasty ever had it? Let's just study the recruitment notices properly—that's the right path."

Li Ziyu then joined Zeng Juan in looking through the newspapers. This Guangzhou municipal joint recruitment had positions in taxation, judiciary, customs, finance, civil affairs, education, health, and over a dozen other departments urgently needed for Guangzhou's construction. Opportunities could be called plentiful.

"The health department can be ruled out first—I'm no doctor... This finance department seems to want accountants. Though I can use an abacus a bit, I'm not very proficient—that won't work either..."

"The tax department isn't bad. All merchants fall under their jurisdiction. Seems like it'd have plenty of perks."

"Oh? But I see the Australians haven't collected any taxes from merchants since they came. Just handled some licenses. Besides, don't the chiefs most object to collecting all sorts of levies from merchants?"

"That's true. But getting into the tax department would be convenient for your family, and for Zhang Yu's family. Oh, and there's your worthless brother-in-law. He runs a shop too—under the tax bureau's thumb. If you want to give him trouble, just check his accounts a few times. He'll surely know what's good for him then."

"That does sound like a good choice." Zeng Juan was immediately interested. "It's just I know nothing about how the Australians collect taxes."

"You probably don't need to know. It's just following regulations. Nothing more."

"Tax collectors are despised. I can't pull a face like that. Doesn't seem right."

"The education department—that's being a schoolteacher. You're probably not interested in that?"

"Hmm, not really..."

"The justice department looks like it wants lawyers. Great Song is founded on law, so they must value this department. But Great Song has so many laws. When I was learning to be a police officer, I had to study several Song law codes. I couldn't even memorize one *Da Ming Lü* before. And some Song law codes are even thicker than the *Da Ming Lü*..."

"Strict laws and severe punishments indeed... Are the chiefs really descendants of the Song, or heirs of the brutal Qin?" Zeng Juan couldn't help exclaiming after hearing this.

Li Ziyu's face immediately changed. He whispered: "Hey, hey—don't say such things again. If you say that outside, you'll end up in the station. The chiefs' ears and eyes are beyond your imagination."

"I misspoke. I'll be more careful next time."

"Actually, the chiefs' laws are very different from the brutal Qin's. How do I explain... Forget it, you'll understand later..."

"Brother Zeng, the institutions of Great Song are intricate and complex. Outsiders can't understand them. Today I'm just looking through the fog myself. Why don't I go back to the bureau and ask some seniors from Lingao—they might have more accurate insights. What do you think?"

"That would be excellent! Please do take the trouble, Brother Ziyu. Tonight let's try the new Australian hot pot at Grand World?"

"It's not for your dinner invitation that I'm helping you. When you pass, Zhang Yu and I will throw you a celebration banquet together!"

"Ah, who knows if I can even pass." Zeng Juan couldn't help showing a dejected expression.

"Hey, hey, hey—what's wrong with you? So downcast!" Li Ziyu patted his shoulder loudly. "Now that the chiefs need people, as long as you work hard, you can always find a way to advance."

"It's just these questions—I really find them tricky..." As he spoke, he opened a book called *Past Exam Questions Collection* and turned to the "Historical Essay Questions" section.

"'Discuss the propositions that Zhou and Tang were externally strong but internally weak, while Qin and Wei were externally weak but internally strong.'"

"'Jia Yi's Five Baits and Three Shows strategy was mocked by Ban Gu as superficial. Yet Duke Mu of Qin once used it to dominate the Western Rong, and Zhonghang Yue likewise warned the Chanyu about it—the strategy was not ineffective. Discuss.'"

...

"Just these few questions—I'm completely helpless. At the academy we never studied the New and Old *Tang Histories*, nor the *Records of the Grand Historian*, nor the Former and Latter *Han Histories*..."

Li Ziyu nodded. These were all "historical essays" requiring familiarity with historical texts to even understand the questions. But private academies didn't teach history beyond the Confucian Thirteen Classics, and teachers didn't encourage—even opposed—students reading history. As for ordinary students, even those interested in history—such books might not be rare, but only families with some wealth actually owned them. Average families couldn't afford them and wouldn't buy them. So Zeng Juan had essentially never seen them. His meager historical knowledge came either from bookshop romance novels or scattered fragments from reading "Australian books."

"Whatever question came up, I could only submit a blank paper." Zeng Juan smiled bitterly.

"My family does have a few history books. If you want, I'll lend them to you." Li Ziyu was generous. "Besides, Brother Zeng, you needn't worry too much. According to the *Syllabus*, historical essays don't count for many points. The main focus is still 'General Knowledge' and 'Policy Essays.' These are all practical matters. Watch and study a few more—you'll figure them out."

Li Ziyu had been paying close attention to civil service exams lately—though he was already "in public service," under the Australians, advancement and raises all required exams, each harder than the last. For his own career, Li Ziyu was constantly trying to figure out Australian testing methods and reasoning.

"General Knowledge is manageable—just rote memorization. Math isn't too hard either. Once you remember those Arabic numerals and Australian formulas, a few practice sessions and it sticks. Only these Policy Essays aren't easy." Zeng Juan pulled out one of his practice essays. These Policy Essays were quite complex: first several articles were given, all presenting phenomena without any argumentative bias. Then below came several questions—some requiring summarization, some explaining certain passages, some asking about causes and solutions. Finally, there was a commentary essay.

"Honestly, if I hadn't read some Australian books, I really wouldn't know where to begin!" Zeng Juan sighed.

Li Ziyu laughed: "That's precisely the advantage of us who understand Australian learning! Back then, reading Australian books got us scolded by our teachers no end for 'neglecting proper studies.' Now our futures depend on this 'improper study'! Isn't this wonderful news? Why worry—in all of Guangzhou, how many people understand 'Australian learning'? Even those great Confucians probably don't understand. This is our golden opportunity!"

His words struck Zeng Juan like clouds parting to reveal the sun. Indeed, though the questions were somewhat difficult, as Li Ziyu said: in all of Guangzhou, how many understood Australian learning? Rising tides lift all boats; falling tides strand all boats. His own level might not be bad—might even rank in the top few.

Leaving Zeng Juan's house, Li Ziyu saw there was still time, no need to rush back to the bureau. He turned down Six Banyan Street.

This street had recently seen a new Shandong pastry shop open. Selling northern-style flour snacks and pastries. From steamed buns to assorted grain pancakes—everything you could want.

When the shop opened, it immediately attracted patronage from Bopo Army officers and soldiers and cadres stationed in and around Guangzhou—many were from Shandong, others from various northern regions. Living in Guangdong, dietary adjustments were considerable. They eagerly embraced these northern flavors.

Those in the know, however, knew this shop's popularity owed something to the fact that proprietress Miss Dong was a northern beauty rarely seen in the Guangzhou area. Supposedly she was the daughter of the former Guangzhou Prefect Dong. After Prefect Dong's suicide by poison, this Miss Dong—caught by the rebels but neither taking her own life nor retreating from public view—had brazenly opened a shop on her own, claiming she wanted to "earn her living by her own hands."

Though Miss Dong's shop-keeping had drawn some bitter curses from behind—"shameless," "betraying her father for glory," "loose morals," and so on—there were also whispers that the Dong mother and daughter had some "dirty deal" with a certain Australian Elder. Some even claimed to have personally witnessed the Dong mother and daughter being secretly brought to Prefect Liu's residence at nightfall, returning only at dawn the next morning—both still "freshly bedewed, cheeks flushed with spring"...

Such rumors in the past might have shamed a woman into suicide to prove her innocence. But now Guangzhou's social climate no longer much cared about such things. Australian female cadres and female police officers walked openly down the streets in skirts showing their calves. Even cursing them "shameless" a hundred times was useless. Moreover, these women all held varying degrees of power. Offending them brought no benefit. Even the most orthodox moralists could only satisfy themselves with verbal venting—they couldn't stir up any great waves.

The Dong family shop didn't just sell northern pastries; it also handled needlework and tailoring, doing mending and alterations. Bopo Army uniforms, having been hastily manufactured, often didn't fit well. Many soldiers came to Miss Dong's shop for sizing adjustments or repairs. More importantly, of course, clothes handled by Miss Dong carried "a special fragrance"...

But Li Ziyu knew: these tailoring and mending jobs were actually done by "seamstresses for hire." Miss Dong just took in the work from her shop and farmed it out to the seamstresses.

The roadside shops all had awnings extended at their doors. In the past, these awnings encroaching on the street had become commonplace. Now there were regulations: awnings could only slant out for shade without legs on the ground. Moreover, no goods or chairs could be placed under awnings.

Since the "New Life Movement" began, this thousand-year-old city had taken on something of a new appearance. After all the illegally-extended stalls were demolished, the streets became not just wider but cleaner. Walking along, Li Ziyu felt refreshed—and this included some of his own contribution.

Walking a bit further, he spotted a cloth banner by the street reading "Dong Family Shop." This was the shop run by Dong Mingdang and her mother.

The Dong Family Shop occupied a two-bay storefront. After emerging from the Guangxiao Temple "review," Dong Mingdang had sold some of her jewelry. Combined with her savings, she had bought this property—at the time, with the political situation uncertain, property prices had fallen. She had picked up a bargain—not just the two-bay storefront in front, but also a two-courtyard residence behind. Good for both living and business.
