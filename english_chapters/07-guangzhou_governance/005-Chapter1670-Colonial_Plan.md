# Chapter 1670 — Colonial Plan

"The Planning Agency favors developing Brunei's oil fields," Wu De said. "Initial investment is substantial, but the technical threshold is low and output stable. Fellow Senators are free to share alternative views."

The petroleum faction was almost universally aligned with Brunei. From a professional standpoint, Brunei crude vastly outperformed Taiwanese reserves.

"Internal combustion engines are the future direction for prime movers—" a petroleum Senator began expansively, but Wu De cut him off.

"We do need oil, primarily for diesel and kerosene. Especially kerosene: with reliable supply, the kerosene lamp industry has enormous potential. Focus your attention there."

"Shouldn't we prioritize electric lights? Or at least gas lamps?"

"Gas lamps are not the direction of development. Electric lights require a power grid, and that cannot be achieved overnight—in the old timeline, most rural areas received electricity only in the 1980s, with remote regions waiting until the 1990s. Given our industrial level, popularizing kerosene lamps within a generation would be exceptional."

Before cheap, sufficiently bright nighttime lighting existed, the vast majority of humanity slept as soon as darkness fell. The sole nocturnal entertainment was procreation. Lighting a lamp for work or study was a luxury only "meager-assets" families could afford. If affordable kerosene illumination could be popularized, it would liberate the night for countless people, creating conditions for evening labor and education.

The meeting granted everyone a full day for group discussions. The newly elected Cabinet members likewise engaged in their own sessions.

Though the Cabinet contained fresh faces, nearly all continued their previous work, possessing intimate knowledge of their domains. Naturally, they each attempted to insert personal priorities into the Plan.

Discussions convened in the Nanhai Coffee House and various ministry conference rooms—the Senate Hall's single open-air venue sufficed for plenary sessions but not smaller gatherings.

The Executive Committee General Office's conference room was packed. Those present were all "ministers"—with one exception: Si Kaide. Though no longer Minister of Colonial Trade, foreign trade remained among the Senate's most critical departments. This cabinet meeting "expanded" to include him.

Si Kaide seemed psychologically prepared for his departure. Despite competent work, he had "swum against the current" on every major policy debate, tilting left then right—or getting attacked from both flanks simultaneously. His reputation had only deteriorated; stepping down was inevitable.

After the election, Wen Desi told Ma Qianzhu: "Si Kaide is a good comrade. His foreign trade work deserves affirmation."

Si Kaide consoled himself: stepping down had advantages. He had been tarred black enough. Since the Senate rotated positions like emperors taking turns, resting a term posed no problem. Besides, he retained his role as People's Commissar for Trade. At present, he was reporting on next year's foreign trade supply plan.

The plan was vital because many projects depended directly on what goods the trade department could procure. In an era of profoundly underdeveloped supply chains—where trade mostly concerned luxury goods—many industrial raw materials unavailable in controlled territories required immense resources to locate. Some simply could not be obtained.

"...Senator Ping writes that the next trade fleet will ship 100 tons of copper and 100 tons of sulfur from Japan. The South American wild rubber and cinchona bark shipped by the Dutch should also arrive next year..."

Dean Shi, sitting with eyes closed, suddenly looked up. "Repeat that. Cinchona bark—how much?"

Si Kaide scratched his head. "I cannot give exact figures, but definitely tons. Whether long-distance transport affects efficacy remains uncertain. Additionally, the British East India Company will ship saltpeter, graphite, asbestos, plus opium from India."

Zhan Wuya clapped Si Kaide on the shoulder. "Little Si, outstanding work! I never expected you to secure rubber, graphite, *and* asbestos. We must get the electric furnace operational next year. With that, silicon steel, #45 steel, #65 manganese steel, stainless steel, calcium carbide, and electric welding all become feasible."

"Electric furnaces aren't in the Plan, are they?"

"I left them out, thinking we couldn't obtain suitable raw materials—certainty was low..." Zhan Wuya said. "But the electric furnace is a hurdle we must cross. Without it, many things cannot begin. It is the critical industrial chain link—the sooner conquered, the better."

"...Besides continuing slave shipments, Quarkiong will complete horse contract delivery next year. The European and Indian breeds we purchased will all arrive—though mortality rate is expected high..."

Regarding horses, only Wu Nanhai showed much interest. Since capturing Jeju Island and opening trade with Later Jin, Mongolian horses—however unsatisfactory—had filled the demand gap. The Army barely covered its needs. The upcoming Mainland Campaign would unfold across water networks where boats outperformed horses. Yet Mongolian horses' limited traction still blocked certain large implements Wu Nanhai hoped to deploy. His desire for breed improvement remained urgent.

"We are launching the Liang-Guang Campaign. To display military prestige and Senator officer dignity, senior Army officers should be equipped with tall, impressive mounts..."

The speaker was Xi Yazhou, newly appointed Army Chief of Staff.

Wu Nanhai snorted. "Old Xi, if you want horse-meat sausage, wait for the transport ship—you can eat your fill. Stop invoking 'prestige'..."

"Old Wu! I did eat chickens and ducks back then, but I was seriously wounded on Juhua Islet and needed nourishment. Must you always hold this against me?... Look, Nick—" Xi Yazhou suddenly realized his slip. Regarding Nick's mysteriously vanished pigeon, he maintained an unwavering stance: *beat me to death, I will admit nothing*. He fell silent.

Wu Nanhai had been about to mention vanishing rabbits and a suckling pig that somehow flew from the pigsty to grass outside, but sensing the mood was wrong, let it go.

Si Kaide continued: "I have a letter from Senator Xue Ruowang, Consul in Batavia. You have seen his proposal. Working alone in Batavia is difficult—the rubber, cinchona trees, all secured by him. He proposes a Palembang Plan in Sumatra—an experiment in establishing the Senate's first colony. Initially, large-scale plantations growing rubber, cinchona, oil palm, and tropical cash crops, while preparing Palembang oil field development during the Third Five-Year Plan. Colonial personnel would be drawn primarily from Hakkas. Conflict between local Cantonese and Hakkas runs sharp—armed feuds are commonplace. We also hold pirate leader Liu Xiang. His followers are mainly from Chaoshan, and Chaoshan people do not get along with Cantonese. From a stability perspective, I suggest migrating a portion of Liu Xiang's group there..."

"Accomplishing nothing, yet proposing a new colony. Never mind manpower—how much material and transport capacity will this require?" Wu De frowned. "Tropical plantations are necessary, but investment is substantial. Moreover, it is Dutch-controlled territory! What if the Dutch emulate the Spaniards and conduct a Batavia Massacre? We would have another Vietnam debacle!"

"If that happens, we blood-wash Tayouan," Si Kaide replied flatly. "The Spaniards dared the Manila Massacre because they saw the Ming would not retaliate. With the Senate backing the colony, the Dutch will not be so blind."

"Investment need not be overwhelming," Ma Qianzhu said calmly. "Plantation economy is cruel. Sending our people to burn themselves out is inadvisable—use local materials, introduce slavery. Chinese immigrants can serve as craftsmen, merchants, overseers, technicians. This can follow 'Government Supervision, Merchant Operation.' Liu Xiang's private wealth is probably several million, plus his subordinates. Let them invest in a colonial development company."

Ran Yao frowned. "Is that appropriate? You are cultivating a new power bloc overseas. If it becomes too large to fail, dismantling it later requires great effort. And dealing with an old fox like Liu Xiang, I fear Senator Xue will be devoured without bone residue left..."

"We only ask them to provide capital; we did not say they would run operations." Si Kaide had planned thoroughly. "Immigrants will comprise three groups: Hakkas at fifty percent, Chaoshan people from Liu Xiang's subordinates at thirty percent, Fujianese from Zheng Zhilong's Kaohsiung followers at twenty percent. This ratio ensures mutual restraint."

"It also makes mutual slaughter considerably easier," Ran Yao observed. "I suspect the Dutch originally had no ideas, but someone among these groups will rush to collude with them first!"
