# Chapter 1787 - The Recovered Carrying Pole

He said this, and the people below naturally had nothing to say. But the porter who had lost his carrying pole was still muttering. Old Cui listened impatiently and cursed: "The carrying pole is counted as mine, what are you, a blockhead, still muttering about?"

It turned out that although this porter had obtained the carrying pole for free, the rope and cloth bag on it were gone—these two items were indeed not worth feeling sorry for, but without the rope and cloth bag, he still couldn't do business. Especially his cloth bag, which was an oilcloth bag specifically used for work at the live pig hong...

Li Zhenguo heard this and suddenly interrupted their conversation, asking the porter to describe the lost items properly. What did they look like? Roughly when were they lost?

The porter said that this set of rope and cloth bag was specially prepared because he worked year-round for the "Fuchangyu" Pig Hong in Scissors Alley. This Fuchangyu Pig Hong was in Central Scissors Alley, next to the river channel. Live pigs from the countryside were transported by boat to the pier behind the pig hong and kept in pens, slaughtered daily and sold to meat stalls, restaurants, and wealthy households.

The pig hong shipped a large amount of pork and pig offal every day, so they employed many porters year-round to deliver meat to customers. If it was a whole side of pork, it could just be hooked with an iron hook and carried. But pig offal and processed meat products couldn't be hung with hooks, so porters carried them in cloth bags. Because they often worked for meat shops, these few porters who regularly worked for the pig hong all had special oilcloth bags.

Yesterday, they went to work at the pig hong as usual. After the work was finished, they left their tools in the tea shed as usual—this was also an old rule, generally no one would steal them. Most porters were from other counties and often stayed in small chicken-feather inns in Guangzhou, with no place to store tools.

Unexpectedly, when they came to work this morning, the tools of others in the tea shed were still there, but his alone was missing.

Hearing this news, Li Zhenguo's brow relaxed a lot. He asked:

"Where is the tea shed where you wait for work?"

"No. 11 West Branch Alley, South Scissors Alley."

"Let's go and have a look."

Now Li Ziyu was a bit confused, because they had originally planned to inspect Widow Wang's house—according to the clues provided by Old Cui, the mysterious man on Widow Wang's wall was obviously the most suspicious. Li Zhenguo's sudden change of mind left him scratching his head. He knew this tea shed—the station listed such gathering places for manual laborers as key subjects for supervision—it was just a simple bamboo shed, built on a piece of abandoned land after a building collapse, inside were a dozen tables propped up with broken bricks and rotten wood missing arms and legs. Rough porcelain teapots and coarse sand bowls, very simple.

The porters' carrying poles were placed on a bamboo rack to the side. Old Cui said that who put theirs where was fixed; newcomers always put theirs at the back, and the more senior ones ranked further forward, having a greater chance of waiting for work.

Li Zhenguo looked at the environment. This tea shed didn't even have walls, so naturally, it couldn't be said to be secure against theft, but it wasn't completely open either, because Old Qiu, who watched the tea shed, slept in a reed mat shed next to the tea shed.

Old Qiu said that usually he didn't sleep too soundly: not because he was afraid of things being stolen, but occasionally someone had business at night and needed to call porters for work, which was all arranged by him. If someone knocked on the door outside, he had to get up. But last night he slept exceptionally soundly. Originally he had to get up at the fourth watch to fetch water, chop wood, and boil water, but today he slept until broad daylight before waking up.

Now Li Zhenguo felt even more that there was a problem here. He walked into the straw shed where Old Qiu lived, seemingly faintly smelling a scent, but not very clearly. Just as he was about to speak, suddenly another person burst into the straw shed and shouted:

"Knockout incense!"

The person who came was none other than Gao Chongjiu.

Gao Chongjiu had originally been questioning households door-to-door with the household registration police from the station, and it would have taken until at least the afternoon to reach the tea shed. He suddenly burst in here because he had obtained a new clue.

This clue came from the coroners who were fishing for the corpse. Two coroners had been fishing all morning, suddenly the one at the stern got excited and said to the boatman: "Boss, stop! Got it!" Before this. Similar "got it" moments had happened several times, but what was hooked were all debris from the river bottom, so the boss didn't have much excitement at this moment, just responding perfunctorily: "Then pull it up."

But the weight of the object at the river bottom seemed very heavy. The brother at the stern struggled quite a bit alone. After some effort, what was pulled out of the water was not a corpse, nor even other debris, but a carrying pole.

To say a bamboo carrying pole, that was impossible to sink to the river bottom at all, let alone be heavy enough to require exhausting effort to pull up. The reason the carrying pole was particularly heavy was because a stone was tied to it.

A carrying pole, firstly, is not a valuable thing, and secondly, it is not an illegal item. Even if it was useless and unwanted, throwing it on the street would naturally result in someone picking it up to burn for fire. Absolutely no one would specially tie a stone to it and sink it to the river bottom.

The two coroners fished for corpses for the yamen year-round and had seen all kinds of cases. One look at this situation and they knew there was a problem, quickly rowing the boat back to report to Gao Chongjiu.

Gao Chongjiu was an old bailiff. Hearing the coroners' report, he immediately concluded that this carrying pole was nine out of ten related to the headless corpse case. He looked at the fished-up carrying pole and the rope tying the stone, felt it looked like something a porter used, inquired at the police station, and came towards the tea shed.

Unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived at the shed, he smelled a scent of knockout incense.

Li Zhenguo hurriedly asked: "Is it really knockout incense?"

Gao Chongjiu nodded: "That's right. Someone definitely lit it here last night!"

Using knockout incense, it was either robbery or rape. Old Qiu was a porter who was both poor and old, unable to work anymore and selling tea and watching the shed here. He had neither beauty nor wealth, what were they after? Could it really be to steal a carrying pole?

The two exchanged case details and felt this was a major discovery. They called the porter who lost the carrying pole to identify it, and sure enough, it was the one he lost!

Someone went to such great lengths to steal such a worthless carrying pole, it couldn't be to sink it to the river bottom. To do this was actually "destroying the corpse and erasing traces". The two judged that this carrying pole was very likely related to the headless corpse case.

What was the use? Li Zhenguo's heart moved. Could it be used to move the corpse?

This thought, not only he had, the several police officers present all had similar thoughts, involuntarily casting their eyes on the carrying pole.

This was an ordinary bamboo carrying pole. A carrying pole used for a long time, shiny and oily, almost dark yellow. It felt not only very smooth but also had a greasy feel, which was probably because the porter often helped the pig hong carry goods. But such a smooth carrying pole with almost a "patina", having soaked in the water for half a day, would leave no traces. Li Zhenguo turned it over and over researching for half a day, racking his brains to dig out all the trivial details learned from training and following Mu Min, Wu Xiang and others, intending to scrutinize it, but couldn't make head or tail of the carrying pole.

Li Ziyu by the side saw clearly. He saw that the stone and rope were still thrown to the side, suddenly had a brainwave, and said: "Comrade Li, haven't looked at that bundle of rope yet."

Hearing this, everyone realized they had neglected the rope. Gao Chongjiu hurriedly picked up the rope. The rope was dripping wet, woven from hemp mixed with bamboo strips, very strong. Old Cui said that's right, this is the rope commonly used by porters.

Although the rope was fished out of the water, it felt greasy in the hand. Obviously, this thing was definitely the original match on the carrying pole, becoming like this after years of carrying pork. Li Zhenguo asked the porter who lost the carrying pole, and he said this rope was his.

The rope had been soaked in lard and blood stains for many years and had turned completely black. At first glance, there was nothing. Li Zhenguo held up the rope and scrutinized it carefully in the sunlight, but discovered a clue. On the seemingly completely black rope, there were fresh stains. Neither Li Zhenguo nor Gao Chongjiu dared to be sure if this stain was human blood, fortunately, the Australians in the Municipal Bureau had ways to identify if this was human blood. If it was, then it was undoubtedly evidence.

Combining this with the oilcloth bag used by the porter... Li Zhenguo's eyes lit up and asked: "Who else has that kind of oilcloth bag?"

There was more than one porter working for the pig hong, so naturally, everyone had one. Right then, Shopkeeper Xie brought one over, saying the appearance and size were about the same. Li Zhenguo spread the oilcloth bag flat on the ground, looked at it, and felt his deduction made even more sense.

The appearance of the carrying pole gave a glimmer of dawn to the investigation that had been blurry all along. The two discussed and decided that time was of the essence, immediately go to Widow Wang's house for on-site exploration, figure out who that person climbing Widow Wang's wall in the middle of the night really was.

Widow Wang's house was not far from the tea shed. Originally they wanted to call the head of the local Baojia group, but Shopkeeper Xie said there was no need to trouble him, I know her situation very well, and the road is not far, I will take you there.

Arriving at the door, they saw it was a very dilapidated house. The front face was very small, barely even one bay wide. The white lime and mud on the wall were peeling off, revealing the broken bricks and tiles and yellow mud pieced together inside. The eaves were also very low. Only about the height of a person. At this time the gate was tightly closed, bolted from the inside. Shopkeeper Xie knocked on the door from outside for a long time with no movement.

Now Shopkeeper Xie was strange, because early in the morning he had seen Widow Wang go out. If she hadn't come back yet, then the door should be locked from the outside. Since it was bolted from the inside, it meant someone was inside. Recently it was the return of the south wind (humid weather), the weather gradually becoming hot and humid. During the day, every household closed the lattice door and opened the main door for ventilation. Broad daylight, what was the door bolted for?

Li Zhenguo and Gao Chongjiu both felt the situation was a bit wrong. Gao Chongjiu knew a thing or two about various tricks in the jianghu. He immediately took out a soft bamboo strip from his person, inserted it through the crack in the door, slowly moved the door bolt aside, spent a few minutes to open the door. As soon as the door opened, they smelled a peculiar fragrance—exactly the same fragrance they smelled in Old Qiu's shed, only stronger.

Li Zhenguo's face changed, cursing inwardly, crossing the main room in three steps combined into two. Behind was a very small courtyard with a crooked old tree, and a person was hanging from the tree!

Shopkeeper Xie couldn't help but scream: The one hanging was exactly Widow Wang!

"Quick, get the person down!"

Several police officers hurriedly went up to untie the rope. Li Ziyu cursed his bad luck in his heart, but had to go up to help. Fortunately, Zhao Gui didn't care too much, standing below to support the person, and soon got Widow Wang down.

Upon taking her down, they saw the person had already stopped breathing, but the corpse was not stiff, not dead for long—combined with the fact that Shopkeeper Xie had seen Widow Wang early this morning, it meant her hanging was a matter of the short few hours from morning to noon.

Although there was no coroner or forensic doctor, with Gao Chongjiu's years of experience, the strangulation mark on Widow Wang's neck was horseshoe-shaped, with a lifting void zone at the end where they didn't intersect. This was the difference between hanging and strangulation; a horseshoe-shaped mark was formed by hanging. It wasn't hung up after being strangled to death, indicating Wang Xiuzhu indeed died by hanging.

However, both Gao Chongjiu and Li Zhenguo felt that Widow Wang's sudden hanging made no sense emotionally or logically. Plus, they smelled knockout incense when they entered the room, not ruling out that she was stunned by knockout incense and then "was hung up". Gao Chongjiu had encountered this kind of case before—only the murderer used the method of getting the victim drunk to commit the crime.

On-site investigation immediately discovered some suspicious points. A stool was overturned on the stone slab floor below the corpse, and the deceased's footprints were left on the stool.

The first suspicious point was discovered on this stool. The pair of footprints on the stool surface made Li Zhenguo feel strange. If one said Wang Xiuzhu stepped on this stool to tie the rope to the tree branch, then put her head into the noose and kicked over the stool to commit suicide, checking it revealed that the marks left on the front and sides of the stool were only that pair of clear footprints, without any friction marks left when kicking over the stool. Li Zhenguo asked Li Ziyu to bring an identical stool and performed a simulation test under the tree in the yard—grabbing the branch with hands, kicking over the stool to suspend the body. The results showed that no matter how light the force used to kick over the stool, traces would definitely be left on the stool.

Conducting a comprehensive investigation of the scene again, Widow Wang's residence was a one-story house with a depth of three bays and one frontage. Entering the door was the main room, next to it was the kitchen. Crossing the small bluestone slab courtyard was a bedroom divided into a bright and a dark room. Going out from the bedroom, behind was a small yard. Piled with some water vats and sundries. The place was very small, the house lowly and small, furniture and items also simple, looking like a poor person's residence at first glance. But upon inspection, the criminal police immediately discovered many incongruous places.

The bedding on the bed was very new, and the quality was good, obviously not used by lower-class commoner women like Widow Wang; a brand new mother-of-pearl inlaid dressing box with a mirror was found at the head of the bed—this was authentic Australian goods, goods from Purple Treasure Studio. Just that crystal mirror inside was worth a not small sum, the cheapest one costing four taels of silver. The dressing box was open, obviously having been rummaged through, most things were gone, but a pearl silver ring was left inside—although not too valuable, it was not something a woman like her could afford to wear. Similar items consistent with consumption and status include clothes in the wardrobe—all silk clothes made not long ago. However, the more direct evidence was that there were men's clothes in the wardrobe, and more than one set. It seemed this man often stayed here overnight.

Obviously, these were all provided by that "wild man". In the kitchen, they discovered more similar traces: a jar of wine half drunk. Unfinished wind-dried chicken and cured meat...
