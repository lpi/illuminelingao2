# Chapter 1802 - Industrial and Commercial Taxes

In some localities, the situation had deteriorated to the point where collection costs exceeded revenue, leading to the outright abolition of commercial taxes, with the shortfall made up through excessive land tax levies. While Guangzhou's commercial taxes hadn't been formally abolished, they existed in a moribund state. In their place had risen local commercial taxes.

After the Japanese pirate incursions were suppressed, the Fujian and Guangdong Provincial Administration Commissions established Tax Bureaus independent of the original Ministry of Revenue commercial tax system. Tax stations sprouted at bridges and ferry crossings, with rates determined locally. The revenue funded military provisions and local defense. Since this silver never touched Ministry of Revenue coffers, local government offices collected with considerable enthusiasm. Yet even with this enthusiasm, Ai Zhixin found the amounts negligible—hardly befitting Guangzhou's status as a commercially prosperous metropolis. When he discovered that one market town under Guangzhou Prefecture reported commercial tax revenue of a mere 170 taels, he knew the corruption must be extraordinary. That same town paid 450 taels annually to the Senate as "Reasonable Burden."

Nevertheless, Ai Zhixin had no intention of making this the focus of his revenue efforts. Commercial taxes were essentially *lijin* transit duties—easy to collect and potentially lucrative, but they strangled the circulation of goods. He had set his sights elsewhere: the store tax, property deed tax, and wine and vinegar tax.

The store tax was a commercial levy collected by local governments from permanent shops in market towns. Since ancient society lacked sophisticated accounting systems, and the government made no effort to calculate shop capital or profits, it amounted to a quota tax. Whether that quota proved high or low depended entirely on chance. Some highly profitable enterprises—pawnshops, for example—paid a mere 45 taels annually, while small street-corner shops might owe several taels.

In Guangzhou, the various trade guilds collected the store tax. Shops not organized into guilds had their taxes collected by government-designated brokers—the opportunities for graft in such arrangements went without saying.

Ai Zhixin examined the total store tax revenue for Guangzhou Prefecture and its two attached counties. It yielded roughly ten thousand taels annually—a respectable figure, but far short of his expectations.

The property deed tax was levied at three percent of sale or mortgage value. However, this tax had gone uncollected in many places for years; the counties and prefectures under Qiongzhou had no collection records whatsoever. Yet Ai Zhixin discovered that Guangzhou not only maintained continuous collection but generated substantial revenue—Nanhai and Panyu counties alone collected approximately two thousand taels annually. The commercial prosperity of the great city evidently drove both higher real estate prices and more frequent transactions.

As for the wine and vinegar tax, this was a Ming continuation of a Song Dynasty levy. The liquor and vinegar monopoly had been a major government revenue source under the Song. However, the Ming Dynasty's capacity to manage industry and commerce was so limited that they could never effectively control production and circulation, rendering the tax essentially nominal.

"The Ming's tax burden is not too heavy—it is too light," Ai Zhixin had declared at the Finance Work Conference in the Wudaokou New Area. "The potential remains almost entirely untapped. Whatever boasts are made about the Great Ming's GDP, when it comes to fiscal extraction efficiency, the Ming is a categorically backward country. Forget comparisons with European powers—in East Asia alone, it trails even Japan."

In Ai Zhixin's assessment, Ming tax collection suffered from catastrophically low efficiency across the board. Losses during collection were staggering: embezzlement, skimming, and leakage plagued every stage. Though the system conscripted vast numbers of unpaid "runners" to handle the work, hidden personnel costs remained unconscionably high.

Building their own tax collection apparatus—one that maintained efficiency while ensuring rough "integrity"—would prove immensely difficult. Even in the twenty-first century, modern tax agencies fortified with institutional safeguards and countless audit controls still produced cases of poor officials ending up in luxury cars and villas.

It was fundamentally impossible to form a team meeting Ai Zhixin's standards using the Senate's current educational and administrative systems. Moreover, direct taxation presented multiple problems. First, it devoured manpower—under the old timeline, before agricultural tax abolition, administrative personnel costs often consumed more than the revenue collected. Second, it readily inflamed social tensions; history overflowed with examples of taxation sparking conflicts, even riots. Finally, modern taxation rested upon modern financial systems. Ming merchants still used the four-column balancing method, with smaller shops keeping only running tallies of transactions.

Implementing the new tax law would require transforming the accounting system. Merchants would need to grow accustomed to not hoarding cash overnight, to conducting transactions through bank instruments rather than physical currency. Such changes couldn't be achieved overnight. But tax collection was urgent.

The simplest approach would follow their previous "Reasonable Burden" practice: the Senate would propose a total burden, then taxpayers would convene to assess and self-report their shares. This collection method provoked the least resistance. Now that Guangzhou's Federation of Industry and Commerce had been established, such an approach would yield quick results. But Ai Zhixin believed this was merely an expedient from their days without political organization.

Adopting such a method would render the various tax rates set by his agency meaningless. Either collected amounts would fall below prescribed rates—effectively giving profits away to businesses—or they would exceed rates, transforming the tax into an "apportionment" that increased taxpayer burdens.

The deepest problem was this: any such practice would inevitably operate through the Federation and the trade guilds, essentially delegating taxation power to these organizations. This invited unfair tax distribution and legalized evasion.

Ai Zhixin believed that, while Guangzhou's shops lacked modern accounting systems, most employed the four-column balancing method, and their business conditions could be audited through ledger books. Since official and private bookkeeping throughout the Ming Dynasty largely followed this method, many people understood it. Adequate "accountants" could be found for temporary service.

Leveraging these characteristics, he would adopt a model of "self-reporting and payment, with severe penalties for evasion." Businesses would report their own taxes; the tax department would conduct periodic random audits of revenue and profits.

Ai Zhixin was immersed in the materials when several soldiers entered carrying dozens of hardcover ledgers. A clerk announced: "Chief, this is the 'Compilation of Guangzhou Industrial and Commercial Households' that Chief Lin requested we transfer to you. Please sign for receipt."

These volumes had been compiled by the City Government based on lists submitted by the Federation of Industry and Commerce and materials gathered by the City Works Department. They catalogued all "permanent shops with fixed storefronts"—from great maritime merchants like Gao Ju down to corner grocery stalls. The entries detailed addresses, business scope, operating conditions, owner names, and employment situations. Beyond the City Works Department's accumulated records, this collection had relied entirely on administrative work since entering the city: census registration, house number plaques, business licensing. Without this foundation, Ai Zhixin would have had no option but the old "Reasonable Burden" apportionment.

He had already devised his basic framework. Broadly speaking, he would levy three major categories: property tax, circulation tax, and stamp duty.

The first category, property tax, would target agricultural land holdings, commercial land holdings, substantial residential properties, commercial vessels, and industrial and mining assets. Specifically, he planned to levy: real estate tax, urban land use tax, vehicle and vessel license tax, vehicle and vessel purchase tax, deed tax, inheritance tax, and a slave tax.

The second, circulation tax, would maintain commodity market order. Business tax wouldn't be subdivided into minute categories; generally speaking, any business activity generating business income fell within the scope of taxation—subject to certain exemption quotas and parameters. The most significant collections would come from the circulation channels of Guangzhou's newly established wholesale markets.

The third, stamp duty, served contracts and deeds requiring legal recognition and Senate protection. Taxable objects included ship departure permits, land deeds, house deeds, business licenses, and equity certificates—any documentation requiring the Senate's authoritative seal.

Finally came local administrative surcharges, levied atop the circulation tax. In consultation with Liu Xiang, Ai Zhixin had determined four items: city cleaning fee, local security fee, urban construction fee, and education fee. These would fund Guangzhou's local administration. Other tax categories constituted national taxes, with portions returned locally based on actual circumstances.

Customs duties, anchorage dues, and tonnage dues fell outside his jurisdiction, so he had developed no immediate plans. As for salt and tobacco monopoly, he lacked new ideas for now—a proper monopoly system required complete, dedicated teams. When he couldn't even perfect the tax agency, establishing a monopoly apparatus was out of the question. So he continued the Lingao method: a single tax payment at the wholesale source, then distribution by dealers. Regarding tobacco and salt monopolies at the production level—these matters were complex, requiring resources beyond a Tax Bureau Director's command.

Ai Zhixin skimmed several pages of the ledger and formed a basic picture in his mind. At that moment, a City Government messenger arrived: Mayor Liu was convening a meeting.

"What meeting?" Ai Zhixin had just arrived in the city with mountains of work before him. He had barely warmed his seat before being summoned. If this had nothing to do with fiscal affairs, he would respectfully decline.

"A meeting regarding rectification of the customs industry."

"Tell Mayor Liu I have too much on my plate and won't be attending..." Ai Zhixin frowned. He thought to himself that Liu Xiang was beginning to put on bureaucratic airs, padding meetings for appearance's sake.

"Mayor Liu said this meeting concerns you." Liu Xiang had evidently anticipated his reluctance and specifically instructed the messenger: "Tax issues related to the customs industry in Guangzhou will be discussed at the rectification meeting..."

Ai Zhixin immediately reconsidered. "I'll come at once."
