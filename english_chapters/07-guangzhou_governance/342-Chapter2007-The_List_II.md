# Chapter 2007 - The List (II)

The list slowly took shape amidst the gossip swirling through the Jiliang Institute. The trio tried to fathom the chief's mind: the first batch must meet high standards to serve as a benchmark. So the selection was particularly strict. Mao Xiuyu said it was better to have fewer people than to have any problems.

In this way, the candidates were significantly reduced, and various rumors flew throughout the institute. Lu Cheng couldn't concern herself with all that, talking to candidates one by one day and night, ensuring everyone's situation was "properly understood."

Finally, only fifty people were selected at the Jiliang Institute. The list was posted on the bulletin board for "public notice" as usual, inevitably triggering another round of private discussion—envy, blessings, and sour remarks flying everywhere.

Just at this time, the workshop's work efficiency suddenly improved significantly. The matter of "having hope" was more effective than any amount of "ideological work." In the past, cadres had only told them to "work hard" and "transform your thinking," with no word on what came next. Naturally, everyone lacked enthusiasm. Now, suddenly having an outlet—even if they couldn't be selected in the first batch—as long as they worked hard, there'd always be a turn later.

Thorns and brazen troublemakers like Bian Cuibao instantly found themselves isolated. Lu Cheng and the cadres constantly reminded everyone, explicitly or implicitly: being listed must consider one's "ideological standing." "Unqualified" students "will not be considered." But as long as everyone "strove to progress," "the superiors will definitely see it." "Some people were confused in the past, following the jeering. As long as they draw a clear line, the superiors will let bygones be bygones and give opportunities"...

There are often such people among the masses who, for various reasons, become "thorns" resisting authority. Though their small acts of resistance might garner support and sympathy from the masses in the shadows—even applause under the principle of "the law does not punish the multitude"—once the masses find that abandoning them yields greater benefits, the "public will" supporting such thorns collapses instantly. Several "faces" who'd originally held sway at the Jiliang Institute suddenly became "discarded shoes" no one cared about. Even their closest friends and sisters didn't dare speak to them publicly. Those with active minds simply "drew a clear line" outright. At the weekly "democratic life meetings," Bian Cuibao—this "quarrel king" whom no one had dared provoke in the past—was actually criticized by several people and didn't dare make a sound. She was also frequently scolded by activists during work.

"After the chief proposed this plan, the face of the Jiliang Institute has completely changed." Lu Cheng was very happy. This transformation had been completely unexpected, leaving her both surprised and delighted.

While the shelter was wracking its brains over the list, Du Yibin didn't stay idle after returning. He immediately ran to the shipyard to see Wang Jun, discussing the specific naturalized citizen blind date list and the format of the blind date meeting.

"The matter still isn't quite easy to handle," Wang Jun sighed upon seeing him, pulling out a thick booklet. "Many monks, little porridge."

This booklet on the table was the comprehensive list and situation introduction of disabled naturalized citizens that Wang Jun had requested from Civil Affairs.

The Senate's disability system referenced the old timeline, divided into ten grades. This blind date activity would only solve the marriage problem for Grade 7 and above—medium to severe disabled personnel.

Du Yibin looked it over. The materials were quite complete. Not only were photos attached, but also detailed specific disability situations, sequelae and rehabilitation plans, and roughly estimated expenses. There were also detailed records of the disabled personnel's current work situations, income and welfare, housing, and family circumstances. Civil Affairs had done their work quite thoroughly.

Wang Jun said: "I'd originally thought there weren't many people. Now looking at this, it seems I estimated wrong. I'm afraid it's far from enough."

"Many men, few women. This will be hard to distribute." Du Yibin started scratching his head.

Whether Wang Jun or Du Yibin, they'd both underestimated the number of single disabled naturalized citizens. Even counting all the activists at the Jiliang Institute, it probably wouldn't be enough.

"There's a second troublesome matter. Once our plan was reported up, various departments have been sending memorandums. People want to treat us to dinners too. If we were in Lingao now, I estimate places like 'Flying Cloud Club' and 'Nanhai Coffee House' would have us rushing to banquets—eating at least four or five meals a day."

"Treating dinners?" Du Yibin was puzzled.

"Nothing more than wanting to tilt these single women toward their departments," Wang Jun said with a bitter smile.

Du Yibin thought for a moment: "This matter—offending no one won't work. I think we should do this: since we can't distribute enough to go around, whether disabled or ordinary naturalized citizens, we'll just uphold two principles. First, the female side is voluntary. Second, the male side goes by seniority and merit. Whoever has longer service and greater merit gets priority on the candidate list. Disabled naturalized citizens with long histories and great merit also have some influence in their own units, can speak up, and their length-of-service wages and incomes are higher. To those widows, this can also count as compensation."

As for the venue, naturally it would be Guangzhou. Transporting students and single women back to Lingao would cost far too much. Moreover, benefiting from the large influx of population, Lingao's own male-female ratio had already trended toward normal. Since the Continental Strategy began, cadres and soldiers dispatched from Lingao and other places had exceeded ten thousand. Among them were large numbers of bachelors. They'd left Lingao, this "little heaven on earth," to work in new areas with arduous conditions. An appropriate tilt in marriage matters was only natural.

"As for the blind date venue, Mayor Liu supports us very much. We can choose from various local halls and pavilions. However, there's a problem. Disabled naturalized citizens in Guangzhou are very few," Wang Jun said. "I think they shouldn't attend the blind date meeting."

Disabled naturalized personnel were mostly arranged to work in Lingao now. Various counties in Hainan also had partial settlements. Only a small number of Grade 7 disabled naturalized citizens worked in Guangzhou. If they wanted to hold a blind date meeting, just gathering these people would be very troublesome, let alone having them take boats.

Du Yibin thought this was also true: "They move with difficulty. Better not to toss them about. Use photos for two-way selection. After selection, just send the female side there—just afraid the female side will regret it."

"If they regret it, there's no helping it. We can't use force in this kind of thing. At most, it counts as her earning a one-way boat ticket—her lifelong major event still has to be arranged by the Senate. Calculating it out, she's not losing." Wang Jun said.

"Ordinary naturalized citizens will be collectively sent to the Jiliang Institute for face-to-face blind dates with them. This counts as on-site education, telling those backward elements that the Senate is trustworthy. It can also help transform the thinking of the remaining students." Du Yibin said. Wang Jun expressed no objection.

Right then, the two divided the labor, sorting out relevant lists and materials. First was arranging the disabled naturalized citizen list according to seniority from top to bottom. Then Wang Jun's life secretary would copy and organize relevant materials.

For the specific format of the blind date meeting, Wang Jun had already drafted a plan. Senator Du had consistently disliked worrying about this kind of thing. He read it hastily for a few glances and said: "For the next matters of the blind date grand meeting, you, Senator Wang, be the protagonist. I'll just play assistant."

"You want me to be both planner and host?" Wang Jun asked, drinking his kvass.

"Of course. I'm just responsible for the behind-the-scenes layout. I don't want to manage so much. It's decided. Anyway, this was your idea." Du Yibin drank his kvass. "Just don't turn it into a blind date show."

"Blind date shows are variety programs. Not real blind dates."

"Fine, fine, fine. Hurry and arrange it. I think food and such isn't necessary. Get some sunflower seeds, tea, water..."

"Money? The budget list still has to be approved by Director Wang again." The two discovered there were still many trivial matters. Wang Jun paid from his own pocket to pad things first, taking people to the tea and food shop to buy supplies. Meanwhile, Du Yibin went to find Director Wang to chat: this budget had already been changed quite a few times. If he disagreed again, Du would post on the BBS and ruthlessly blast him for having "lordly airs."

---

Three days later, Du Yibin—having smoothly obtained the budget after it had been slashed seventeen or eighteen times—came to the shelter again. The three people reported the list and the problems they'd encountered to Du Yibin.

Du Yibin wasn't interested in the list—he didn't know a single person. But he read through the various problem lists they'd raised several times.

Among the items mentioned on this problem list, some he'd thought of, some Civil Affairs had arrangements for. Still quite a few had been anticipated by no one. No wonder Governor Ma said Civil Affairs work could best embody the two characters "troublesome and difficult." Indeed so. These problems were mostly trivial, but they genuinely related to people's lives. They couldn't be called insignificant.

To solve them—theoretically, with unlimited cost, they could all be solved. But the Senate's current financial situation couldn't permit splashing money around hand over fist. Although theoretically this money was allocated from the General Office's special fund, Director Xiao and the Finance Department big bosses had all euphemistically reminded him: though the special fund was a separate line item, it essentially still came from the same pot. There was no second pot.

So the actual assigned special funds were very limited. Prefect Liu had reminded him many times in memoranda that he wanted him to "calculate costs." For non-disabled naturalized citizen marriages, "in principle" no subsidies would be given. As for Mayor Liu's side, though he'd expressed "strong support," he'd also set conditions—Guangzhou could only provide support in terms of venues and manpower. As for money, there wasn't a cent.

So when he opened his mouth now, he could only be prudent:

"Their concerns are understandable. The commitments I can currently make are limited. First, the regulations Civil Affairs has brought out now state that after marrying a disabled naturalized citizen, every family will be arranged independent housing. Housing area is calculated according to family population. There will also be certain discounts in purchasing and housing loans. Second, families with severe disabilities and many dependents will be issued different amounts of housekeeping subsidy coupons monthly according to disability situation, used for hiring housekeeping personnel to assist with housework—mainly heavy physical labor. Disability subsidy allowances needn't be mentioned; disabled personnel all have them intrinsically. If they're Grade 7 or below disabled personnel who can care for themselves, appropriate work will be arranged for them. Those unable to care for themselves won't be assigned work and will separately receive minimum living expenses."
