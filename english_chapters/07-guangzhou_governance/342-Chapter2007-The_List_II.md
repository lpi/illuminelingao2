# Chapter 2007 - The List II

The list slowly took shape amidst the gossip in the Ji Liang Suo. The trio tried to fathom the Chief's mind: the first batch must have high requirements to serve as a benchmark. So the selection was particularly strict. Mao Weijia [sic: Mao Xiuyu or Lu Weijia? Text says Mao Weijia, probably typo for Lu Weijia or Mao Xiuyu mixing names. Context says "rather fewer people than catching a problem", sounds like Mao Xiuyu's caution. But name is Mao Weijia. I will use Mao Xiuyu based on context or keep Mao Weijia if ambiguous. Previous chapter Mao Xiuyu was the cautious one. Let's assume Typo and use Mao Xiuyu or just "Mao said". I'll translate as Mao Weijia [sic] to be safe or correct it. Let's stick to Mao Xiuyu logic, but text is text. I will use "Mao Weijia" but knowing it's likely a typo.] said, better to have fewer people than to have any problem.

In this way, the candidates were significantly reduced, and various rumors flew all over the institute. Lu Cheng couldn't care about so much, talking to candidates one by one day and night, ensuring everyone's situation was "in place."

Finally, only fifty people were selected in Ji Liang Suo. The list was posted on the bulletin board for "Publicity" as usual, inevitably causing another round of private discussion, with envy, blessing, and sour words flying all over.

Just at this time, the work efficiency of the workshop suddenly improved significantly. The matter of "Having Hope" was more effective than doing any amount of "Ideological Work." In the past, cadres only told them to "Work Hard" and "Transform Thought," and then what to do next had no following text, naturally everyone had no enthusiasm. Now suddenly having an outlet, even if self couldn't be selected in the first batch, as long as working hard, there would always be a turn later.

Thorn heads and rolling knife meats like Bian Cuibao instantly appeared isolated. Lu Cheng and cadres constantly reminded everyone explicitly or implicitly: listing into the list must consider "Ideological Problem." "Unqualified" students "Will Not Be Considered." But as long as everyone "Strive to Progress," "Superiors will definitely see it." "Some people were confused in the past, following the jeering. As long as drawing a clear line, superiors will let bygones be bygones, giving opportunities"...

There are often such people among the masses. Because of various reasons, they became "Thorn Heads" resisting superior authority. Although their small resistance would get support and sympathy from the masses in the dark, and could even get applause under the condition of "Law prohibits not the masses," however, once the masses find that abandoning them can obtain more benefits, the "Public Will" of thorn heads will collapse instantly. Several "Face and Head" characters originally in Ji Liang Suo suddenly became "Discarded Shoes" no one asked about. Even her few best friends and sisters dared not speak to her publicly. Those with active minds simply "Drew Clear Line" directly. When holding "Democratic Life Meeting" every week, Bian Cuibao, this "Quarrel King" whom no one dared to provoke in the past, was actually criticized by several people daring not to make a sound. She would also be frequently scolded by activists when working continuously.

"After the Chief proposed this plan, the face of Ji Liang Suo is all new." Lu Cheng was very happy. This transformation was completely unexpected, making her both surprised and happy.

While the Shelter was racking brains for the list, Du Yibin didn't stay idle after going back. He immediately ran to the shipyard to see Wang Jun, discussing the specific naturalized citizen blind date list and the mode of the blind date meeting.

"Matter is still not quite easy to handle," Wang Jun sighed after seeing him, taking out a thick booklet. "Monks many porridge little."

This booklet on the table was the large list and rough situation introduction of disabled naturalized citizens Wang Jun asked from Civil Affairs Mouth.

The Senate's disability system referenced the old timeline, divided into ten grades. This blind date activity only solved the marriage problem of Grade 7 and above medium and severe disabled personnel.

Du Yibin looked at it. Materials were quite complete. Not only attached with photos, but also detailed specific disability situation, sequelae and rehabilitation plan, roughly needed expenses. There were also detailed records of the disabled personnel's current work situation, income and welfare, housing, and family situation. The work of Civil Affairs Mouth was done quite in place.

Wang Jun said: "I originally thought people were not many. Now looking it seems estimated wrong. I'm afraid it is far from enough."

"Men many women few. This is hard to distribute." Du Yibin started scratching head.

Whether Wang Jun or Du Yibin, they still underestimated the number of single disabled naturalized citizens. Even if counting all activists in Ji Liang Suo, fear it wasn't enough.

"There is a second troublesome matter. Once our plan reported up, various departments sent memorandums now. Also people wanting to treat dinner. If we are in Lingao now, estimate 'Flying Cloud Club', 'South China Sea Cafe' these few places would have to rush to attend banquets. Eating at least four or five meals a day."

"Treating dinner?" Du Yibin puzzled.

"Nothing more than wanting to tilt these single women to their departments," Wang Jun smiled bitterly.

Du Yibin thought for a while: "This matter offending no one won't do. I see this: Since can't distribute over, whether disabled or ordinary naturalized citizens, we just uphold two principles: First is female side voluntary; Second is male side looks at seniority and merit. Who has long seniority, big merit, who gets priority on candidate list. Disabled naturalized citizens with old history, big merit, they also have some influence in their own units, can speak words, length of service wage income also higher. To those widows, it can also count as compensation."

As for the holding venue, naturally it was Guangzhou—Transporting students and single women back to Lingao inevitably cost too high. Moreover, benefiting from large quantity input population, the male-female ratio of Lingao itself already tended to normal. Since Continent Strategy, cadres and soldiers dispatched from Lingao and other places already exceeded ten thousand. Among these people were a large amount of Wang Laowu [bachelors]. They left Lingao this "Little Heaven on Earth" to work in new areas with arduous conditions. Appropriate tilting in marriage was also matter of course.

"As for blind date venue. Mayor Liu supports us very much. We can choose various local halls and pavilions. However there is a problem. Disabled naturalized citizens in Guangzhou are very few," Wang Jun said. "I see they shouldn't hold blind date meeting."

Disabled naturalized personnel were mostly arranged to work in Lingao now. Various counties in Hainan also had partial settlement. Only a small amount of Grade 7 disabled naturalized citizens worked in Guangzhou. If wanting to open blind date meeting, just concentrating these people up would be very troublesome. Let alone taking boat.

Du Yibin thought it was also true: "They move inconveniently. Better not toss about. Use photo method for two-way selection. After selecting, sending female side there is fine—Just afraid female side regrets."

"Regretting also no way. This kind of thing we can't engage force. At most counting she earned a one-way boat ticket—Her lifelong big event still has to be arranged by Senate. Calculating up not losing either." Wang Jun said.

"Ordinary naturalized citizens then collectively sent to Ji Liang Suo to have face-to-face blind date with them. This counts as on-site education. Telling those backward elements, that Senate is trustworthy. Also can make remaining students transform thought." Du Yibin said. Wang Jun expressed no problem.

Right then two people divided labor. Sorting out relevant lists and materials. First was arranging sent disabled naturalized citizen list according to seniority from top to bottom one by one. Then Wang Jun's life secretary copied and organized relevant materials.

For the specific form of the blind date meeting, Wang Jun already drafted a plan. Senator Du consistently didn't appreciate worrying about this kind of thing. Read hastily for a few glances. Said: "Next matters of blind date grand meeting, you Senator Wang be the protagonist. I just play a assistant."

"You let me be planner and also be host?" Wang Jun drank Kvass asking.

"Of course. I just responsible for behind scenes and layout. I don't want to manage so much. Just decided so. Anyway this is what you thought." Du Yibin drank Kvass. "Don't making into blind date show is fine."

"Blind date show that is variety show. Not true blind date."

"Fine fine fine. You hurry arrange—I see eating and such need not. Getting some sunflower seeds tea water and such..."

"Money? Budget list still has to find Director Wang to approve again." Two people found fart matters still many. Wang Jun paid money from own pocket padding first. Taking people to tea food shop buying things first. While Du Yibin went to find Director Wang to chat: This budget already changed quite a few times. If he disagreed again, he would post a post on BBS spraying him ruthlessly as "Master Style."

Three days later, Du Yibin, who smoothly obtained the budget chopped by seventeen eighteen knives, came to the Shelter again. The three people reflected the list and encountered problems to Du Yibin.

Du Yibin wasn't interested in the list—He knew not a single person. But repeated reading various problem lists proposed several times.

Items mentioned on this problem list, some he thought of. Some Civil Affairs Mouth had arrangement. Still quite a few were expected by no one. No wonder Governor Ma said Civil Affairs work could best embody "Troublesome Difficult" two characters. Indeed so. These problems mostly trivial. But effectively related to their lives. Couldn't say insignificant.

Saying solving. Regardless of cost naturally could all solve. But Senate current financial situation couldn't spend money big hand big foot. Although theoretically this money was allocated from General Office Special Fee. But Director Xiao and Finance Mouth big bosses all reminded euphemistically: Although Special Fee is single listed item. But essentially still scooping soup from one pot. Didn't exist second pot.

So actual assigned special fund was very little. Prefect Liu reminded him many times in memorandum. Wanted to "Calculate Cost." To non-disabled naturalized citizen marriage. "In principle" not giving subsidy. As for Mayor Liu side. Although expressing "Strongly Support." But also opened condition. One was Guangzhou City side could only give support on venue and manpower. As for money that was a cent no have.

So when he opened mouth now he could only be prudent:

"Their scruples are understandable. Commitments I can make currently are not many either. First, the constitution brought out by Civil Affairs Mouth now is after marrying disabled naturalized citizen, every family arranges independent housing. Housing area calculated according to family population. In purchasing and housing loan will also have certain discount; Second is families with heavy disability, many supported population. Monthly will issue different amount of Housekeeping Subsidy Coupon according to disability situation. Used for hiring housekeeping personnel to assist housework. Mainly heavy physical labor; Disability Subsidy Allowance need not say. Disabled personnel all have it intrinsically. If is Grade Medium and below disabled personnel who can self care life. Will arrange appropriate work for them; Life cannot self care not arranging work. Separately issuing Minimum Living Fee."
