# Chapter 1755 - The Chastity Hall

"Oh? So there's quite a bit of grease to be skimmed here." Liu San nodded with a knowing smile.

"I wouldn't dare say whether the grease is plentiful or not," Mao Xiuyu replied, eyes narrowing as he grinned. "But take this most recent Director Dong the Fifth—when he first arrived, he looked no different from the paupers lodged here. In less than two or three years, he had built a house and bought land back in his hometown. And right here in Guangzhou, he'd purchased a house to keep a mistress in as well."

Liu San made a silent calculation. With 2,165 people, each receiving three *dou* of rice and forty-five *wen* per month, that came to 6,495 *dou* of unhusked rice and 97,425 *wen* of copper cash monthly. Six hundred fifty *shi* of unhusked rice, at Guangzhou's average market price, was worth nearly seven hundred taels of silver; add the copper cash, and Puji Hall's monthly expenditure approached nine hundred taels—over ten thousand taels a year!

Then it occurred to him: the full amount was never actually disbursed; "three parts fat on every transaction" was the rule. He asked, "How much actually reaches the Hall?"

"You truly are a man who understands, my lord!" Mao Xiuyu laughed. "By custom, only three-tenths."

*That's a ruthless cut*, thought Liu San. He pressed further: "Tell me honestly—how much do the people lodged here actually receive each month?"

Though Mao Xiuyu's face was wreathed in smiles, he licked his lips before answering: "As long as they're not too ill to walk, everyone in the institution goes out to beg on the streets..."

"So in fact they get nothing?"

"I wouldn't say *nothing*. The old and infirm who can't move around—the Hall still gives them a bowl of gruel. On rainy days when they can't go out, the Hall provides meals. As for the widows in the Chastity Hall—they can't show their faces in public—they live by weaving and raising chickens, and the Hall subsidizes them a little." Mao Xiuyu no longer dared to grin. He reported softly.

"How much do *you* receive each month?" Liu San asked.

"There's a set quota," Mao Xiuyu replied. "All workers here receive two *dou* of rice and three hundred *wen* per month."

"No side income?" Liu San smiled.

Mao Xiuyu shot him a nervous glance and forced a chuckle. "To say there's none—you wouldn't believe me, my lord. But it's quite limited. Like floodwater spreading over the ground—just wetting the surface."

"How many workers are here?"

"Over a hundred in all. I've never seen the roster myself, so I dare not speak out of turn..."

"Where are they?"

"The few Master Dong brought with him all ran off with him. The others—I myself have never seen. There are seven or eight still on the premises, looking after things."

"If you work here, how could you never have seen them?" Liu San was puzzled.

"It's as you say, my lord," Mao Xiuyu explained. "They've all been referred in by people with large gate-thresholds. The prefect and magistrate couldn't refuse; the names were registered, and they each draw a bit of pay."

So only thirty percent actually arrived at the Hall; over a hundred non-working sinecure-holders drew wages; and a "house-buying, land-acquiring, mistress-keeping" director embezzled and exploited the rest. Little remained for the inmates. No wonder Puji Hall was in such a shambles, its residents indistinguishable from beggars—they *were* beggars.

Liu San had dealt with traditional society for years, procuring and trading medicines, and practicing medicine far and wide. He was long inured to its extreme corruption and darkness. He suspected the roster of 2,165 inmates was at least half inflated. He asked:

"Are the Hall's roster and account books still here?"

"Well... they're in Secretary Gao's hands."

Liu San wondered how another "Secretary Gao" had suddenly appeared. "Who is Secretary Gao?"

"He's the Hall's bookkeeper, named Gao Bohai. He doesn't come here often." Mao Xiuyu lowered his voice cautiously. "The roster and ledgers are with him."

Liu San guessed this Secretary Gao was another power behind the scenes at Puji Hall. A few more questions revealed that Secretary Gao had been "referred in" by a local member of the gentry and had served as the Hall's bookkeeper for over a decade.

Liu San noticed that Mao Xiuyu's eyes flickered and he hesitated whenever Secretary Gao's name came up—there must be some hidden story. So he coaxed him with leading questions and hinted that the directorship might come to him. Under the prevailing atmosphere of "the dynastic winds have turned," Mao Xiuyu finally divulged some crucial information.

In truth, Secretary Gao was the man who really controlled Puji Hall; all administration passed through his hands, much like the relationship between a magistrate and his Revenue Clerk. Directors came and went with whichever prefect was in power, but Secretary Gao remained as though rooted. Whenever a new director took office, his first order of business was to ingratiate himself with Secretary Gao; otherwise, in a matter of months, enormous deficits would emerge. If the inmates took to the streets and accosted provincial officials, even the prefect's own son couldn't survive as director.

"Directors are here to make a fortune and enjoy themselves on the coattails of the authorities—how many would bother squatting out here on this graveyard mountain doing real work? As long as they're not short on cash, they're satisfied."

But Secretary Gao possessed no "fish-scale register" or similar "nuclear weapon" to check the director; his power derived from the gentry member who had recommended him—one "Charitable Zhen."

Charitable Zhen's name was Zhen Gaizheng. He owned vast tracts of land and forest north of Guangzhou, wielded both wealth and influence, and was enthusiastic about charitable works—repairing bridges and roads, burying roadside corpses, running gruel kitchens... He had even donated several charity burial plots. His renown both inside and outside the city was great, and he was hailed as a true "local worthy."

Liu San nodded thoughtfully, then lowered his voice. "Level with me: how many people does Puji Hall actually shelter?"

---

Mao Xiuyu stammered, "Probably... probably... four or five hundred... exactly how many, I myself have no idea." He explained that the Chastity Hall housed a little over a hundred impoverished widows and several dozen children; since they seldom went out, he knew the rough figures. The others came and went as they pleased—anyone bearing a Puji Hall waist-token was counted as a Hall inmate. Over the years, many tokens no longer matched any living person.

"...Even if there were a roster, the real number would still be unknown. The register hasn't been updated in years."

Liu San thought: *a single Puji Hall, and already these murky depths*. But that was Lin Baiguang's affair. He was more concerned with sanitation here. "Take me on a tour of the grounds."

"The place hasn't been swept in years; it's filthy beyond words..."

"That's all right."

"Yes, yes." Mao Xiuyu thought these Australians truly were odd—what was there to see in a broken-down temple full of rubble and garbage? If not for a few extra silver coins, he wouldn't have lingered here a single moment.

So he led the way. From behind the Great Hall of the Buddha, a straight path of level flagstones extended toward a pagoda at the rear. On either side, weeds grew rank. Shattered brick and smashed tile littered the ground, and tall mugwort had sprouted between the cracks of the paving stones.

Huanghua Temple covered a vast tract, with hall after hall. Though long neglected and now a shambles, many buildings still stood—most with doors and windows gaping open, courtyards choked with grass taller than a man, utterly deserted. Dust had accumulated thickly inside the shrines and on altars; the marks of rats scuttling across floor and dais were plainly visible.

Here and there were signs of habitation—ragged clothes, a chipped bowl, a cracked earthenware pot, a broken straw mat with only the rush core left. But most inhabitants were absent; only the sick and crippled remained. According to Mao Xiuyu, everyone who could walk went out to beg. Whether they returned at night was uncertain—some disappeared for months.

"When the 'returning south' season arrives and it rains often, more of them come back. And in winter, if it gets really cold, fewer people go out."

Mao Xiuyu led him to the entrance of a courtyard. Liu San noticed that it was locked tight. Curious, he wondered why. Mao Xiuyu stepped up to the gate and called out: "Fifth Sister-in-Law!"

A middle-aged woman, around thirty-odd years old and sharp-featured, emerged and answered. Seeing that Mao Xiuyu had brought some "*kun* people" along, she started in surprise, then instantly switched to a fawning expression. Hurrying down the steps, she knelt before Liu San and kowtowed:

"This servant is of the Sun Fifth family; I pay respects to the lord."

"And you are—?"

"This servant is a government matchmaker, tasked with looking after the Chastity Hall here."

In Ming and Qing local yamen, official matchmakers were assigned to any case involving women; they were responsible for minding and guarding female persons—in effect, the female counterpart to yamen runners.

Liu San observed her brisk demeanor and sharp eyes; he knew at once she was a formidable and shrewish woman.

Hearing that Liu San was an Australian "Chief" come to inspect, Fifth Sister-in-Law Sun grew even more solicitous. She hurriedly fetched a key and unlocked the courtyard gate.

Liu San was puzzled. "It's broad daylight—why keep the gate locked?"

"All who live here are impoverished widows keeping their chastity. Though this place is remote, men still come and go. With the gate locked, no gossip from outside enters, and none from inside escapes. It saves much rumor and slander." Fifth Sister-in-Law Sun chattered on. "For a widow to uphold her virtue, the first thing is to avoid suspicion!"

She explained that men were ordinarily forbidden to enter; even visiting relatives could meet only at the gate. If a widow had brought children, any son reaching age seven had to move out.

"This is the strictest of places. In nearly a hundred years since its founding, there has never been a single scandal, nor a single remarriage." There was evident pride in Fifth Sister-in-Law Sun's voice.

Liu San saw that the Chastity Hall had been converted from a monks' dormitory. Around the perimeter stood the former cells of the sangha, now in disrepair but patched up with scrap brick and broken tile; inside, the quarters were far cleaner and more orderly than elsewhere. The courtyard's paving bricks had been dug up and the ground planted with various vegetables. A few chickens were strolling about at leisure.

Fifth Sister-in-Law Sun said the widows mainly wove cloth and silk. The courtyard boasted over thirty looms. With their vegetable gardens and chickens, they could support themselves.

"But don't they receive any money or grain?"

"They do! They do!" Fifth Sister-in-Law Sun answered rapidly, but kept glancing at Mao Xiuyu. Mao Xiuyu said irritably, "Just tell the truth, Fifth Sister-in-Law. We've changed dynasties now—no need for all those scruples!"

Fifth Sister-in-Law Sun hastened to smile apologetically. "They do get money and grain—but only one *dou* per month. Those with children receive an extra three *sheng*..."

"Only one *dou*?" Liu San frowned.

"My lord is wise! Even that one *dou* isn't always on time." Fifth Sister-in-Law Sun sighed. "We rely entirely on charity from the madams and young mistresses of the great houses in the city, who send someone now and then to bestow alms. Otherwise, truly, there's no way to manage!"
