# Chapter 1814 - The Dong Family Shop

It wasn't yet mealtime, but quite a few customers had already gathered at the entrance. Judging from their dress, nearly half were "eating Australian rice"—because of the taste, local citizens with any "status" rarely patronized. Instead, many laborers from the lower classes came to try the novelty.

At the shop entrance, under an extended awning, stood a large stove. Dong Xiang was sweating profusely as he spread pancakes on the iron griddle. These pancakes were no different from the assorted grain pancakes of later eras—also made from various grain flours mixed into batter and griddled. But the Dong Family Shop's batter came in two kinds: one was pure mixed grains, the other had wheat flour added, costing a bit more.

As for the fillings wrapped inside—since giant scallions weren't grown locally, cucumber was the basic option. As for other fillings, the variety was rich: vegetables, pickles, crispy crackers, fried dough sticks, and also braised and dry-sliced meats and organ meats. Take your pick at any price. Large portions, cheap prices—the very definition of "poor man's delight."

Li Ziyu hadn't even entered the shop when Dong Xiang, griddling pancakes at the entrance, enthusiastically called out: "Hey! Officer Li, long time no see! Please come in—I'll grill you one as soon as I finish this one!"

Their shop's back door opened onto Nanjianzi Alley, which was Li Ziyu's patrol area. The Dong mother and daughter were also on the Political Security Bureau's "special register," so they had received Li Ziyu's "attention" from the start.

As a patrol officer, Li Ziyu had to be on the street for over ten hours. When hungry, buying a pancake cost little yet was filling. So he became a regular customer here. One thing led to another, and he became quite familiar with this family.

"Please don't—this New Life emphasizes order above all. I'd better queue up in back, ha." Seeing the murderous glares from the queuing crowd, Li Ziyu quickly stopped Dong Xiang from cutting the line. Never mind discipline—quite a few in line were genuine "old Australian hands." He, a newly-minted "Australian hand," had best know his place.

"Right, right—then please sit inside first. I'll bring yours when I pour it." Dong Xiang smiled apologetically while calling toward the inside: "Orchid! First get Officer Li a bowl of porridge!"

Li Ziyu lifted the bamboo curtain and entered—the whole body felt cool and refreshing. Inside were about a dozen small tables. The counter against the wall was wiped sparkling clean, displaying seven or eight large porcelain jars under gauze covers—filled with various drinking snacks: boiled sprouted beans, dressed bean sprouts, Australian pickles, boiled razor clams... Behind the counter were wine jars and porridge barrels. Wine vessels, bowls, and chopsticks—all washed gleaming clean. The whole effect was neat and hygienic.

Because it wasn't mealtime yet, not a single customer sat inside. The woman minding the counter was in her early twenties—Dong Xiang's wife Orchid. Seeing Li Ziyu enter, she hurried out to attend him, guiding him to a table. She smiled: "Officer Li, it's been ages since you've graced our small shop! I hear you've been promoted?"

Li Ziyu affected modesty: "What promotion? I just got transferred to the municipal bureau."

"That's not a promotion?" Orchid said, bringing over a bowl of cool tea. "Our young miss talks about you often. Says you suddenly stopped coming to our shop—wondering if we'd been remiss somehow and offended you..."

"Not at all, not at all. I got transferred to the municipal bureau, so this isn't my patrol area anymore. Naturally I couldn't come often." Li Ziyu hurried to explain, fearing anyone hearing might misunderstand. The bureau kept very tight watch on relations between patrol officers and the merchants and residents of their beats.

"That relieves me. Let me go call our young miss—she mentions you often. Officer Li, drink a few sips first to quench your thirst. I'll go get your porridge." Before she'd finished, she had already headed inside.

Li Ziyu took a sip of cool tea—to his Cantonese palate, this herbal tea was brewed quite wrong: wrong ingredients, wrong taste, wrong brewing time. But thinking that Dong Mingdang had personally brewed it, drinking it still felt quite pleasant.

Before long, a young woman of sixteen or seventeen with a light, graceful figure emerged from inside, pushing aside the curtain. She wore a blue-bottomed cocoon-silk pleated skirt and an ink-green sleeveless jacket with a short-sleeved over-blouse. Her hair was adorned with a kingfisher-feather gold hairpin—both simple and dignified. Her expression was very self-possessed. With a sweet smile, she approached Li Ziyu and gave a curtsey: "Blessings to Officer Li."

Though young, her demeanor was calm, her speech practiced. Her presence dominated before anything was said. Li Ziyu quickly stood, about to salute—then suddenly remembered he was in civilian clothes and hurriedly said: "I don't deserve it. My respects."

"Officer Li is too courteous." Dong Mingdang smiled slightly. "Please sit."

Once both were seated and a few pleasantries exchanged, Dong Mingdang said: "A few days ago, thanks to Officer Li for driving off those thugs and beggars. Otherwise, your servant's shop probably couldn't have operated. Your servant wanted to thank Officer Li properly when you came, but you've been absent for so long. I wondered if we'd been remiss somewhere and made you angry..."

As Dong Mingdang spoke, her dimpled smile and flowing glances nearly made Li Ziyu lose his composure.

*After all, she's a young lady from a great household. Every gesture is different from ordinary folk.* Li Ziyu thought privately.

"Not at all, not at all. Cracking down on street hooligans and maintaining normal social order is the duty of us patrol officers. That day I happened to pass by and naturally couldn't stand by." Li Ziyu proudly deployed the theory he'd learned at the police bureau, feeling quite chivalrous.

Dong Mingdang covered her mouth and laughed, momentarily leaving Li Ziyu dazed.

"Great Song police are truly different from the constables and runners of the former Ming. Each one is a righteous hero. For us common folk to live in peace, we depend entirely on Officer Li and your colleagues." Dong Mingdang's timely flattery was spot-on.

"Not at all, not at all. It's all thanks to the chiefs' good leadership." Li Ziyu knew that no matter the dynasty, keeping "imperial favor and constitutional virtue" on one's lips was never wrong. "I was just a minor military household from Guangzhou Guard. Without the Elder Council's selection, I couldn't have become a police officer. All thanks to the chiefs' cultivation and the Elder Council's good policies."

Li Ziyu spoke truly. In the past, without the Australians' harsh policies and all-encompassing management, who knew what might have happened to the Dong mother and daughter? Whether seized by powerful lords or tricked by ruffians—by now they might already have been trafficked to some brothel. Just recently, several people had had designs on the Dong mother and daughter. Only now, with the Australians' strict laws and universal intervention, no one dared act rashly. That the Dong mother and daughter had their current situation—they truly owed the Elder Council thanks.

"Officer Li, your servant also knows Great Song's governance is good. This servant and my mother were once forcibly abducted from Shandong. The suffering of being helpless and stranded abroad—your servant understands all too well. As long as there's anything I can help with, your servant will certainly do my utmost."

"Officer Li—your servant knows Great Song's regulations forbid accepting gifts. This is some dried *Lonicera* flowers from my mother's hometown in Pingyi—I saw some for sale in town and bought a bit. Just a small token for Officer Li. It's nothing valuable—please do accept..." Before Li Ziyu could say polite words, Dong Mingdang had pressed a paper bag into his hands. Li Ziyu was about to decline when a fragrance—musky yet orchid-like, seeming present yet not—drifted to his nostrils, momentarily clouding his mind. By the time he reacted, Dong Mingdang had already smiled and turned to go back inside.

"Officer Li, just accept it! This little thing doesn't count as bribery!" Orchid laughed as she brought over a tray.

On the tray was a bowl of thin porridge—unlike the thick, sticky Cantonese congee, this was genuine "thin porridge," mostly water with some rice grains settled at the bottom. Being summer, some mung beans had been added. Drinking it was cool and refreshing—perfect paired with the heavy-flavored pancakes. Besides the thin porridge, there were two small dishes of pickles.

Li Ziyu's face instantly flushed. Awkward to say anything, awkward to immediately leave, he could only drink his porridge first.

Holding two pancake wraps, Li Ziyu returned to the police bureau as the sun was setting. Today Dong Mingdang's gift had caught him somewhat off guard. What did it mean? A small packet of dried *Lonicera* flowers naturally wasn't worth much—even Shandong-imported ones cost only a few coins.

Yet what set his heart racing was the paper bag: this was a thick-paper Australian bag, nothing special in itself. But printed on the paper were several stalks of orchids and fragrant grasses, the brushwork delicate and soft, somewhat feminine in style—seemed like a woman's hand.

Could this have been personally painted by Miss Dong? Li Ziyu thought of this and couldn't help feeling restless. Could Dong Mingdang have feelings for him?

A young miss from an official's family like the Dongs—even if only a concubine's daughter—in the past Li Ziyu wouldn't have dared imagine. Even if someday he inherited his uncle's commission, he'd only be a minor military officer whom nobody valued. Impossible to marry a daughter of a fourth-rank magistrate.

But now it was Great Song's realm. Her father had long since "cut himself off from the Elder Council and the people." She, Dong Mingdang—in the past she'd have been "a criminal's family member," destined for the entertainment quarters as a slave. While he, Li Ziyu, was an upstanding cadre under the Elder Council's banner...

Even thinking this way, he still felt he "didn't deserve" Dong Mingdang. Suddenly feeling dejected, his resentment toward the Great Ming grew even deeper.

The bureau was mostly empty except for some duty staff. Li Ziyu headed toward the study room. He knew that naturalized police officers transferred from Hainan mostly killed time in the study room since they had no homes to return to in Guangzhou.

Because of the relaxed recruitment standards, many complete illiterates had joined the patrol force. Chief Pan had established the study room—essentially a simple library—stocking newspapers, books, and also blackboards and other teaching equipment. For officers to study professional knowledge and learn about Elder Council policies and spirit during off-hours.

When the study room first opened, hardly anyone came to study. But after a policy linking exam performance to performance evaluations came out, the study room became popular. Especially in the days before monthly exams—without arriving early to claim a spot, there was absolutely no space.

Since this month's exam had just concluded, not many people were in the study room. Those buried in books were mostly officers needing to retake exams... While hesitating, a small figure in the corner caught Li Ziyu's attention—that Lingao-transferred female household registration officer was sitting there quietly reading.
