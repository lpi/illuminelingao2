# Chapter 1803 - Staking Claims

By standard procedure, Minister Hong should have first contacted the Delong system to assess the situation, then dispatched military representatives to accompany Delong personnel for monitoring. But during this period of regime transition—with Delong Bank transforming from a central bank into a commercial institution—a thousand loose threads tangled with no one available to coordinate. So Minister Hong had personally stepped in, meeting directly with the village and township-level liaison officers to assume control of "Reasonable Burden" collection. When Liu Xiang arrived in Guangzhou and witnessed this arrangement, he was stunned. *Minister Hong, you really aren't the Transport Commissioner! Is it truly acceptable for the military to intervene directly in local administration—village-level administration, no less?*

Before he could even begin complaining, memoranda from Wudaokou descended like snowflakes, reminding him this was "not in accordance with regulations." The Political Security Bureau likewise dispatched a memorandum, noting that lower-level liaison officers felt "uneasy"—uncertain "whose orders to follow."

*Did I ask him to do this? Why not take it directly to the military!* Liu Xiang cursed silently, realizing he would need to seek Wen Zong's coordination on this matter. The thought made him scratch his scalp, imagining his hair thinning with each passing day.

Just as he was contemplating how to handle Ai Zhixin's latest round of "memorandum bombardment," he noticed a new document in the basket marked "Incoming" on his desk.

"Minister Hong..." Liu Xiang read the name on the cover, and the corner of his mouth twitched.

Hong Huangnan's correspondence arrived as a personal confidential letter between Senators. Such communications were termed "private," though they carried a distinctly semi-official character—typically employed by Senators to discuss matters they preferred not to route through formal channels, since official correspondence was routinely copied and archived. These "burn after reading" letters served perfectly.

The contents were indeed official business. To "ensure logistical supply for the army and Guangdong administrative agencies by all means," Minister Hong requested that a substantial piece of land be designated as a Joint Logistics support base for agricultural production. He had already scouted the location: the Mude Patrol Division area north of Guangzhou Prefecture. The water and fertilizer conditions there were genuinely excellent, and since the Patrol Division essentially functioned as a "national road toll collection agency"—a petty treasure chest for Guangzhou bureaucrats—local landlord power was unusually weak. Cultivated land was mostly state-owned; wasteland mostly unclaimed. The property rights structure was rarely this straightforward.

Liu Xiang had himself long coveted this territory, planning to negotiate with Wu Nanhai about intensive large-scale farming once Liang Xinhu finished purging local bullies and evil gentry—the Heaven and Earth Society's Guangdong Agricultural Reclamation Command had already marked this area for development. Hong Huangnan's "private letter" disrupted the entire rhythm.

Minister Hong's proposal wasn't entirely groundless, of course. He bore responsibility for logistical support of the South China Army, which extended beyond front-line combat troops to include National Army and administrative teams already stationed across counties and strategic locations. Even within Guangzhou city, the Joint Logistics Headquarters handled most administrative agencies' provisions—including Liu Xiang's own meals, which were of notably high quality. Minister Hong's catering standards remained consistently impressive: seafood from Hong Kong, processed meats from Lingao, coconuts from Wenchang, air-dried venison from Taiwan, potatoes from Jeju Island, citrus from Zhejiang—all continuously supplied. Establishing a farm to "improve logistics" was entirely justified and righteous.

*You want to run a logistics farm; I want to run one too!* Liu Xiang recalled that Wang Sangou had proposed opening an agency farm on state land outside Guangzhou to grow vegetables and raise pigs, reducing food costs—currently vegetables and meat were transported from Hong Kong. Liu Xiang had declined for the moment, fearing that pursuing staff welfare before his seat was even warm would invite criticism.

*My own welfare hasn't been addressed yet, and I have to satisfy yours first? Dream on.* Liu Xiang thought.

He had already been dissatisfied with Hong Huangnan's disorderly intervention in local administration during the early period, though those actions had occurred before he took office—or even before he expressed intent to serve. Beyond attempting to wrap things up and mitigate the effects, Liu Xiang had no real grounds for complaint. Besides, since entering the city, various ministries and agencies had been able to begin work immediately upon putting down their packs—the Joint Logistics' groundwork had been genuinely effective.

What truly rankled was the letter's wording. He read it repeatedly, and the more he studied its phrasing and tone, the more irritated he became. This wasn't merely a note between colleagues—it read as though a senior official several ranks above were instructing a mere clerk.

"Minister Hong, I am the Prefectural Governor, not the Prefectural Shepherd. You are the Minister of Logistics, not the Transport Commissioner." After the fourth reading, Liu Xiang made his decision: this request would be rejected.

It wasn't merely about the wording. The fundamental issue was that this land grant could not be approved. Real estate was a sensitive matter. Before Liu Xiang's departure, Wu De had specifically cautioned him about handling land use with care.

"Everyone likes good locations. Once the important figures enter the city, claiming stakes becomes inevitable. You must control this tendency. If it solidifies into fait accompli, adjustments later will drag in whole families. The interests involved can't be resolved by simply offering alternative parcels."

"The matter Brother raises carries significant consequences, and Brother cannot decide alone." Liu Xiang had developed an odd habit of adopting literary flourishes when rejecting documents, deliberately composing his replies in a classical style. "Should Brother truly harbor such intentions, the only path forward is to copy this letter in duplicate: one to Wen Desi for discussion at the Guangdong Senator Group meeting, one to Lingao for the Senate Standing Committee..."

After a quarter-hour spent drafting his response, Liu Xiang reviewed it once more and found nothing amiss. He spent another ten minutes transcribing it onto letter paper, sealed it thoroughly with wax, and pulled the second bellpull on the left wall—its wire ran directly through a reserved conduit to the Secretariat across the corridor. Within moments, a knock sounded.

"Come in!" Liu Xiang didn't even look up, simply beckoning the visitor to enter.

"Chief! Communications Officer Ye Siman reporting!" It was Ye Siman, the communications officer assigned to Liu Xiang during his return to Lingao. Originally, Ye Siman had been on temporary secondment, but during that brief, intensive, eventful month in Lingao, Liu Xiang had recognized his capabilities and requested him permanently.

"Use the Senators' exclusive channel and deliver this to Senator Hong Huangnan at the Joint Logistics Office." Liu Xiang indicated the envelope, now sealed with kraft paper and stamped with wax. "Has Director Zhang finished today's summary?"

"Director Zhang's work is completed and currently being organized. I will bring it to you shortly!"

"Hmm. Ask her to come by as well. I have additional tasks for her." Liu Xiang waved dismissal after relaying the message.

Zhang Yunmi now held the title "Deputy Director of the General Office of the Guangzhou Municipal Government." When establishing this General Office, several impressive justifications had been offered—"super-ministry system," "improving office efficiency," and similar terminology. But the actual reason...

Originally, Zhang Yunmi had secured a promise from Xiao Zishan and approached Liu Xiang to "campaign" for a position. Liu Xiang had entertained certain notions of his own. Learning that this pretty young woman wanted to follow him to Guangzhou had set his heart blooming through several seasons. He agreed enthusiastically—after all, this was meant for relaxation. As long as safety was ensured, whether she played or lived in seclusion didn't matter. Daily proximity meant more opportunities...

But when Liu Xiang actually boarded the ship to depart—stopping in Hong Kong to collect a batch of personnel waiting there—Zhang Yunmi had somehow, inexplicably, made a very serious proposal: she wanted to "work hard" and "formally participate in governmental work." "I'm not here to play, but to achieve something." Now it was Liu Xiang's turn to scratch his head. He had no real gauge of what this young woman could accomplish. Guangzhou Prefecture had just been "liberated," and urban and rural administrative work was extraordinarily complicated. This was definitely not something a girl with absolutely no administrative experience could master immediately. Failing to achieve anything wouldn't be a major problem—but if she acted as a "Virgin Mary" or an "Iron Fist of the Proletariat" and created disasters, Liu Xiang would face pressure from every direction.

After considerable thought, Liu Xiang concluded that only one position was suitable: his private secretary. This role had originally been Guo Xi'er's, though having one secretary or a hundred made little difference. Truthfully, Liu Xiang had gone to Guangzhou without anyone he could completely trust to handle classified documents. Zhang Yunmi's appearance was ideal—as a Senator, she was fully trustworthy. But in the minds of many loser Senators, this position was hopelessly rose-tinted: *when there's work, the secretary handles it; when there's no work, you handle the secretary.* This had virtually become standard operating procedure for some Senators. As for the secretary's actual function, these losers remained completely oblivious. In their minds, a secretary was merely a bed slave for the master. Whether Zhang Yunmi had absorbed this mentality or accepted it as "common knowledge," Liu Xiang couldn't determine. But even viewing Zhang Yunmi in the most favorable light, he dared not directly appoint her as Secretary to the Mayor of Guangzhou. If that appointment reached Lingao, a certain Germanophile would likely appear at his door with a weapon.

Zhang Yunmi was scanning the document summaries she had just compiled. With the massive volume of incoming and outgoing correspondence—and given the generally poor education levels and execrable document composition skills among grassroots cadres—it was impossible for Liu Xiang to spend time correcting everyone's prose. During his tenure in Qiongzhou Prefecture, he had assigned Guo Ling'er to "pre-read" official documents and write summaries. Liu Xiang would then adopt appropriately detailed or cursory approaches to different documents based on her assessments. Though Zhang Yunmi bore the title "Director of the General Office," she understood perfectly well that she was essentially performing secretarial duties.
