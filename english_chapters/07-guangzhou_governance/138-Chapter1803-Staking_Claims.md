# Chapter 1803: Staking Claims

According to standard procedure, Minister Hong should have first contacted the Delong system to get a feel for the situation, and then sent military representatives to follow the Delong people down to monitor. However, during this period of regime transition, Delong Bank was transforming from a central bank to a commercial bank, and for a while, there were thousands of threads and no one to interface with. As a result, Minister Hong personally stepped in to meet with the liaison officers at the specific village and town levels, directly taking over the "Reasonable Burden"... When Liu Xiang arrived in Guangzhou and saw this situation, he was stunned. Minister Hong, you really aren't the Transport Commissioner! Is it really okay for the military to intervene directly in local administration, and even village-level local administration at that?

Before he could start complaining, "memorandums" from Wudaokou flew in like snowflakes, reminding him that this was "not in accordance with regulations"; the Political Security Bureau also sent a "memorandum", reminding him that the lower-level liaison officers felt "uneasy"—"not knowing whose orders to listen to."

"Did I ask him to do this?! Why don't you go directly to the military!" Liu Xiang cursed secretly, thinking that he still had to seek Wen Zong's coordination on this matter. Thinking of this, he scratched his scalp, feeling that his hair was decreasing.

Just as he was thinking about how to deal with Ai Zhixin's new round of "memorandum bombing," he saw a new document in the document basket marked "Incoming" on his desk.

"Minister Hong..." Liu Xiang looked at the name on the cover, the corner of his mouth twitching.

Hong Huangnan sent it as a personal confidential letter between Senators. This kind of correspondence was called "private," but actually had a "semi-official" nature, mostly used by Senators to discuss official business that they didn't want or couldn't pass through formal channels. Because formal correspondence routinely had to be "copied and archived." This kind of letter that could be "burnt after reading" was very suitable.

The content discussed inside was indeed official business. In order to "ensure the logistical supply of the army and the Guangdong administrative agencies by all means," Minister Hong requested that a large piece of land be designated as a logistical support base for the Joint Logistics. It would be used for farming and production. He had already scouted the location; it was in the area of the Mude Patrol Division in the north of Guangzhou Prefecture. The water and fertilizer conditions were indeed good, and because the Patrol Division was essentially a "national road toll collection agency," a small treasury and private plot for the Guangzhou bureaucrats, there were not many local landlord forces. The cultivated land was mostly official land, and the wasteland was mostly ownerless, so the property rights structure was rarely this clear. Liu Xiang had also long set his sights on this piece of land, planning to negotiate with Wu Nanhai about intensive large-scale farms after Liang Xinhu cleared out the local bullies and bad gentry in the next wave—the Heaven and Earth Society's Guangdong Agricultural Reclamation Command had already taken a fancy to this place. With Hong Huangnan's "private letter" coming over, the rhythm was disrupted.

Of course, Minister Hong's proposal was not entirely groundless. He had to undertake the logistical support of the South China Army. This logistical support was not limited to the troops fighting on the front line, but also included the National Army and administrative teams that had already stationed in various counties and key areas. Even in Guangzhou city, the logistics of most administrative agencies were handled by the Joint Logistics Headquarters. Including Liu Xiang himself, they ate meals supplied by the Joint Logistics—the quality was quite good. The meals organized by Minister Hong were consistently of high standards: seafood from Hong Kong, processed meat products from Lingao, coconuts from Wenchang, air-dried venison from Taiwan, potatoes from Jeju Island, citrus from Zhejiang... all were continuously brought in for supply. So setting up a farm to "improve logistics" was perfectly justifiable and righteous.

"You want to run a logistics farm, I want to run a logistics farm too!" Liu Xiang remembered that Wang Sangou had reported to him, suggesting opening an agency farm on official land selected outside Guangzhou city to grow vegetables and raise pigs themselves to reduce food costs—currently vegetables and meat were transported from Hong Kong. He felt that engaging in living welfare before his seat was even warm would probably be criticized, so he didn't agree for the time being.

*My own welfare hasn't been done yet, and I have to satisfy yours first. Hmph, you wish.* Liu Xiang thought.

Liu Xiang was originally dissatisfied with Hong Huangnan's disorderly intervention in local administration in the early stage, but those were all things done before he took office, or even before he expressed his intention to take office. Apart from trying to wrap things up and eliminate the influence, Liu Xiang had nothing to complain about. besides, since entering the city, various ministries and agencies could start working as soon as they put down their backpacks; it must be said that the work of the Joint Logistics was still very much in place. However, the wording of this "private letter" really made him unhappy. He read it over and over again, and the more he pondered the wording and phrasing inside, the more unhappy he felt: This was not just writing a note, but the style of a superior several levels higher writing a note to a clerk below.

"Minister Hong, I am the Prefectural Governor, not the Prefectural Shepherd; you are the Minister of Logistics, not the Transport Commissioner." When reading it for the fourth time, Liu Xiang finally made up his mind to reject this matter.

It wasn't just a matter of wording; the key was that this land opening couldn't be granted. Real estate is a sensitive issue. Wu De had greeted him before he came, saying that land use issues must be handled with caution.

"Everyone likes good places. Once the big guys enter the city, staking claims is inevitable. You have to control this trend. Ind it becomes a fait accompli, adjusting it again will involve a whole bunch of people dragging their families along. The interests involved cannot be solved by just giving another piece of land."

"The matter mentioned by Brother involves significant consequences, and Brother cannot decide alone. If Brother truly has this intention, the only way is to copy the original text in duplicate, send one to Wen Desi for discussion at the Guangdong Senator Group meeting, and send one to Lingao for discussion at the Senate Standing Committee meeting..." Liu Xiang didn't know where he got this quirk, but he liked to drop bookish phrases when rejecting others' documents, deliberately writing in a literary style.

After spending a quarter of an hour writing the draft of the reply, Liu Xiang read it again and felt there were no problems. He spent another ten minutes transcribing it onto letter paper, sealed it with wax continuously, and pulled the second bell pull on the left wall—the wire of this pull went directly to the Secretariat across a corridor through a reserved pipe in the wall. In a short while, the sound of knocking on the door rang out.

"Come in!" Liu Xiang didn't even lift his head, directly greeting the person to enter.

"Chief! Communications Officer Ye Siman reporting to you!" It was Ye Siman, the communications officer assigned to Liu Xiang during his return to Lingao. Originally, Ye Siman was only temporarily seconded to Liu Xiang, but during that brief, busy, and rich month in Lingao, Liu Xiang felt that this Ye Siman was very capable, so he asked for him directly.

"Use the Senators' exclusive channel and send it to Senator Hong Huangnan at the Joint Logistics Office." Liu Xiang pointed to the envelope that had been sealed with kraft paper and stamped with wax, and asked again: "Has Director Zhang finished today's summary?"

"Report to Chief! Director Zhang's work is finished and is currently being organized. I will bring it to you later!"

"Hmm, ask her to come over too later. There are other tasks here that need her." After Liu Xiang instructed him to deliver the message, he waved his hand to let him go out.

Zhang Yunmi was now the "Deputy Director of the General Office of the Guangzhou Municipal Government." When this "General Office" was established, it pulled several tiger skins, such as "super-ministry system," "improving office efficiency," and so on. But the actual reason...

Originally, Zhang Yunmi got a promise from Xiao Zishan and ran to Liu Xiang to "campaign." Liu Xiang originally had some other thoughts. Hearing that this little beauty wanted to follow him to Guangzhou, flowers bloomed for several seasons in his heart. He agreed profusely—anyway, it was for relaxation. As long as safety was ensured over there, playing or being a recluse didn't matter, and seeing each other every day meant more opportunities... But when Liu Xiang started boarding the ship to depart, stopping in Hong Kong to pick up a batch of personnel waiting there, Zhang Yunmi, not knowing what medicine she took wrong, very seriously proposed that she wanted to "work hard" and "formally participate in government work." "I am not here to play, but to make some achievements." Now it was Liu Xiang's turn to scratch his head. Liu Xiang had no bottom line on how capable this little girl Zhang Yunmi was. Guangzhou Prefecture had just been "liberated," and the administrative work in urban and rural areas was extremely complicated. It was definitely not something a little girl with absolutely no administrative experience could get started with immediately. Not achieving anything wasn't a big problem, but if she acted like a "Virgin Mary" or an "Iron Fist of the Proletariat" and messed things up, Liu Xiang would have to face pressure from all sides.

Liu Xiang thought about it and found that only one position was suitable for arranging her, and that was Liu Xiang's private secretary—this position was originally Guo Xi'er's, but having one or a hundred private secretaries was fine. Truth be told, Liu Xiang went to Guangzhou and had no one he could completely trust to handle confidential documents. Zhang Yunmi's appearance was very suitable—she was a Senator and completely trustworthy. But in the minds of a crowd of loser Senators, this position was peach-pink turning purple—if there's work, the secretary does it; if there's no work, do the secretary. This had almost become the basic code of conduct for some Senators. As for the function of the secretary itself, these losers were completely unaware. In their hearts, a secretary was the master's bed slave, nothing more. Whether Zhang Yunmi was influenced by this, or accepted this "common sense," Liu Xiang was not clear. But even considering Zhang Yunmi in the best direction, Liu Xiang dared not appoint her directly as the Secretary to the Mayor of Guangzhou. If this appointment was transmitted back to Lingao, I'm afraid a certain Germanophile would come to the door with a gun.

Zhang Yunmi was scanning the document summaries she had just written one by one. With a large amount of incoming and outgoing official documents, especially given the generally low education level of these grassroots cadres and the extremely low level of official document writing, it was impossible for Liu Xiang to spend time correcting the composition of each document. Therefore, as early as when he was serving in Qiongzhou Prefecture, he asked Guo Ling'er to be responsible for "pre-reading" official documents and writing article summaries. Liu Xiang would then adopt different detailed or brief reading methods for different official documents based on the summaries. Although Zhang Yunmi was appointed as the "Director of the General Office," she also understood that she was actually doing the work of a secretary.
