# Chapter 2017 - Asking Cui Hantang for Help

Fang Fei undertaking such activity in 21st Century was very easy: Telling partner unit how much money standard per guest. Partner unit submitting menu for verification was fine. But now Liu Xiang gave him instruction ambiguous clear. Even budget to bottom was how much said you go contact Wang Jun them yourself. Truly wanting horse run yet asking horse not eat grass.

Celebration without money nothing more relying on Pulling Sponsorship. Now Mayor Liu blocked the door of Pulling Sponsorship tight tight—Twelve designated sponsors sounded not few. Industry also involved various aspects. In Guangzhou City all were existence of thunder piercing ear. Asking them pooling such a sum of money originally wasn't hard—Once this proposal of "Sponsorship" out. These twelve shops must be fighting first fearing later sending money here. About all must be "Pouring All Possessions" to express own determination of "Following Dragon."

But Liu. Lin two people happened to be pretentious. Saying what "Sponsorship quota cannot be too big. Opening easy closing hard." "These few shops all in high speed developing stage. Money root relatively nervous. Sponsorship meaning a bit is fine. Don't making turnover unable open"... These ambiguous words made Fang Fei very difficult: To bottom collecting how much money is good?

Thinking again three. Decision still discussing with Wang. Du two people a bit. After all origin of this wedding started from them. Seeing they had what opinion.

"City Government requests not letting us pulling Big Household sponsorship. But those Big Households naturally won't let go this great opportunity 'Pulling Relation' with us. I see rather than letting them drilling disorderly outside. Holding silver stuffing dog hole. Better we opening a small hole ourselves..." Du Yibin said.

"Opening hole ourselves easy. How to say at Mayor Liu place?" Fang Fei wasn't afraid Liu Xiang investigating his responsibility kind of things. But specific principle was passed on City Government Work Meeting. Self openly opening hole. Equal to despising leadership of Liu Xiang and Guangzhou City Government.

"Curve Saving Country." Du Yibin held half day holding out a idiom. "Find Daoist Cui..."

"We are holding wedding. Not holding White Event [Funeral]. Finding him doing what?" Fang Fei perception to Cui Hantang not good—Because he several times attacked mass activity and major ceremony Fang Fei organized on "Morning Star" as "Chimera of Third Reich and Old Maozi." No "Inheriting Developing Huaxia Traditional Culture." Was "Foreign Slave Philosophy" "Dogmatism." Plus monk Taoist seen in Old Spacetime all doing Supercession Dharma Assembly on White Event. Anyhow couldn't pull relation with this Collective Wedding.

"Although saying wedding needs no Daoist. But you don't forget Executive Vice Director of Guangzhou Red White Council is Daoist Cui." Du Yibin reminded him. "He participating wedding with identity of Executive Vice Director of Red White Council fits name right words. Letting him donating with name of Red White Council. Name wise just say sponsored by Buddhism. Daoism. Catholicism three families of Guangzhou—Naturally. Where they three families pulling sponsorship from we then cannot control."

"This is feasible." Fang Fei thought this idea not bad. These three families except New Daoism slightly carried "Official Face" color. Other families all couldn't pull much relation with Senate. Donating by their appearance. Then using name of local Red White Council. Various aspects could cope over.

"I go find Fatty Cui talk talk right now!" Wang Jun volunteered—Because he usually had relatively much leisure time. Entering city mostly went Five Immortals Temple finding Cui Hantang blowing water [chatting]. Cui Hantang too. Having heart wanting forging Five Immortals Temple into base of New Daoism. Engaged quite a few own projects. Also inevitably finding Wang Jun this miscellaneous expert "Understanding Some In Various Aspects" of Mechanical. Electrical. Electronic to help. Relation of both sides not bad.

Entering night. Small plaza in front of Five Immortals Temple actually lively like a amusement park. Since Cui Hantang engaged eighteen days Luo Tian Grand Jiao after Public Memorial Grand Meeting. Tired full thin three jin. Mayor Liu also took care of Cui Hantang quite much. Not only let New Daoism eat full on Religious Reform in Guangzhou. Also gave quite a few secret support on construction. This small plaza in front of Five Immortals Temple. Was widened out for Daoist Temple after Mayor Liu "Demolished Illegal Construction." Although not counted Daoist Property. But belonged to Five Immortals Temple using managing.

Five Immortals Temple although was First Big Temple of Guangzhou. Palace inside magnificent. But actual occupying area not too big. Past dynasties constructing. Long used up land inside temple completely. Cui Hantang wanted engaging an outdoor mass activity venue actually couldn't find a place—Biggest outdoor open venue inside temple belonged to that square pond land where "Immortal Footprint" located.

Saying expanding. Happing Five Immortals Temple located place was busy market of Guangzhou. Four sides no gap land. Don't say empty land. Even main street also occupied by squeezing squeezing broken shed households. Only left a two three meter wide passage. Benefiting from Demolishing Illegal Construction Project of Liu Xiang. Old view of main street could recover. But expanding still no door—Wanting expanding. Must engage Demolition. Saying demolishing for expanding Daoist Temple. Cui Hantang dared not mention. Liu Xiang more dared not approve. Finally utilizing quite a few buildings in front of Five Immortals Temple had no House Deed this point. Counted "Illegal Construction." Just demolished out a piece of empty land.

Cui Hantang was paying money "Compensating" common people whose house demolished. Was hiring people leveling land. Paving land. Got some wooden palisade encircling plaza—Said was "Convenient Managing." Also got several flower beds. Planted trees. Arranged several long benches. Truly spending money and spending strength. Finally settled such a piece of "Propaganda Position."

Since had this piece of position. Cui Hantang naturally wanted utilizing fully. Morning was organizing Daoist Students playing Tai Chi. Daytime opening to masses resting. Night then engaged some "Propaganda" activities here.

This propaganda activity essentially was "Preaching." However this plaza more less also counted "Public Occasion." Anti-Religious emotion of Senate still very strong. New Daoism although was "Biological Son" drummed out by Senate self. But always had controversy to its existence. Previous stage because of Liu Xiang matter. Cui Hantang fully experienced strength of various route Trolls of Senate. Now could only engaging some activity relatively low key.

Today activity was "Australian Shadow Play." Cui Hantang originally had heart wanting showing Shadow Play treating as own "Magic Art." But thinking turn thought Lingao already engaged Cinema. Quite a few people among naturalized citizens watched. This cow skin easily pierced. Had to not mention this crop. However film he chose still close to "Daoism" this theme as possible.

Matter of showing Australian Shadow Play today already spread in big streets small lanes. This Shadow Play according to people watched in Lingao and Purple Ming Building said was rare Australian Scene—Much better looking than "Pulling Australian Slice [Slide Show?]" on street. Fresh gadget who all wanted seeing. Sky still not falling dark. Plaza before temple already squeezed full of people. Nearby children one after another rushing come shouting big calling small. Running. Jumping. Whole plaza noise a piece. Even newly placed Stone Qilin before temple. Surrounding wooden palisade all climbed full of people. Some Big Household families even let House Born Son occupying position in advance then taking Cool Sedan coming watch. Peddlers even taking opportunity coming peddling food tea water. Squeezing Five Immortals Temple front water leaking not through. Fully had several hundred people. Daoist Students inside temple all moved out. Maintaining order on street and plaza.

Plaza already erected two vertical columns. Tied with rope on top hanging a black edged white square cloth curtain.

Outside human voice boiling. All anxious waiting opening field. But inside palace in temple. Cui Hantang lying four limbs open on bamboo couch chatting with Fu Meng one strike one lack—Time still early. Sky not dark through also can't show movie.

Content of chatting naturally was about development of New Daoism in Guangzhou. Although these days New Daoism earned quite a few: From image to material. But development still couldn't count smooth. Senator of Guangzhou suppressing from time to time. Senate shouting beating shouting killing three days two heads. Making Daoist Cui thin half jin more again.

Although self counting on a set of "Hand Color" magic trick and Three Inch Unrotten Tongue established name of "Real Person" in Guangzhou. Also approached winning over quite a few Scholars Gentry. But saying big progress always no have.

His work wanting developing believer from Scholars. Especially famous local Scholars was not successful. Cui Hantang painfully discovered. Regardless how much "God Skill" self revealed. Chatting how much "Shocking World Custom" theory. This gang Scholars always separated a layer with self. Don't say "Open Heart Window." Even "Worship Believing" two words still differed very far. Especially several Scholars he tried best winning over. Hoping they could convert. Almost every one had tenacious mind will. Simply not few sentences could flickering pass.

Luckily activity among common people and Big Households still relatively smooth. Many people purely for able to "Climb Relation" with Australian just came Ennobling Dao. Cui Hantang fished quite a few "Dedication" from heads of Big Households Ennobling Dao. As "Creating Income" greatly obtained praise of Daoist Master Zhang.

"...Old Tang. Your this showing Shadow Play move although good. But cannot stand consuming. Not saying controlled projector bulb. Just say your notebook—Lingao side broken quite a few already."

Cui Hantang curled lips: "That gang kids playing game whole day. Watching AV. Not broken then strange! My this small notebook is precious very. Usually cherishing. Using another ten years eight years no problem."

"Then we show what film? Founding Ceremony or Parade?" Fu Meng asked.

"Che. Have to say brain of you studying science all short circuited! Is this Daoist Temple can issue that? You just debug machine well. Listen mine. My this U Disk copy quite a few good things." Cui Hantang proudly said. Totally disregarding Fu Meng awkward face color.

"No problem right? Will it leak our origin?" Fu Meng although slightly annoyed him. But to this straight intestine fellow villager still relatively caring. Relative to administrative officials full belly of heart eyes. He liked chatting with this God Stick Daoist more. Feeling very relaxed without pressure a bit.

"Relax. I all edited. Head and Tail all removed. Producer. Studio whatever all removed too. Good. We go out. Sky all dark." Cui Hantang while speaking full not caring. While stood up greeting him walking towards outside.
