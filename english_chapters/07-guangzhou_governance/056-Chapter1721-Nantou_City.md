# Chapter 1721: Nantou City

Huang Bingkun threw it aside casually, sneering: "Truly crude stuff! The language is crude and rough, the reasoning is forceful and illogical—since ancient times, those who obtained the country rightly, apart from Emperor Gaozu of Han, was Taizu of this Dynasty. What kind of thing is Great Song? Song Taizu bullied orphans and widows to get the throne; Taizong had the 'Sound of the Axe in the Shadow of the Candle'; Huizong played around and lost the country; Gaozong wrongly killed loyal ministers! Even with this, they dare to criticize this Dynasty! Such crude writing is far inferior to even a village schoolteacher!"

Wu Ming spoke leisurely: "Whether the Australians are descendants of the Great Song, I think is also doubtful. In the past, looking at their conduct, there is no intention of respecting the Great Song. I think this is just a pretense—as the saying goes, 'if you want to condemn someone, you can always find a pretext.'"

Everyone nodded, and passed the manifesto around again. What they cared about most was not the quality of the language, but the specific content of this manifesto.

After everyone finished reading, Young Master Lin said in a deep voice: "It seems that the Australians are just the second Eastern Barbarians!" After saying that, he sighed deeply.

The originally somewhat lively room also fell silent. Those present seemed to have just realized what had happened, and no longer had the mood to discuss the issue of "sharing the world."

Their ancestors had lived under the rule of the Great Ming for generations, and life was considered comfortable. Now suddenly the dynasty was changing, and everyone was still a bit unaccustomed—not to mention that the people changing the dynasty were from overseas!

The original liveliness disappeared at once, and everyone became somewhat depressed. Young Master Shi sighed: "We are the fish and meat on the chopping block, what right and wrong, loyalty and wickedness can we talk about? In troubled times, keeping one's life and family property is the greatest luck."

"They won't ask everyone to shave their hair, will they?" Someone muttered.

Some people remembered the rumors that wherever the Eastern Barbarians occupied a place, they would order the surrendered officials, gentry, soldiers, and civilians to shave their heads. Thinking that before the Australians had even fought into Guangzhou, all kinds of Australian gadgets had already become popular. Now that they had become the masters of Guangzhou, they would act even more unscrupulously. Would there be incidents of "Changing the Summer with Barbarian ways" in the future? How would they deal with it?

"Probably... not..."

"If shaving was mandatory, wouldn't Lingao have been completely shaved long ago? Didn't Young Master Huang also not shave his head?"

Huang Bingkun nodded: "Those who shave their hair are the Fake Hair-shorn who beg for food under the Hair-shorn thieves. The Hair-shorn thieves don't ask ordinary people."

This made everyone feel somewhat relieved. However, someone worried again: "Although the discipline of the Hair-shorn thieves is strict and they don't loot, this Guangzhou is after all the first-class rich and prosperous place in the world. Falling into their hands, wouldn't they exploit it greatly? Gentlemen, don't forget that when they were in the four villages, they destroyed many big households..."

"That was for those who were enemies with them. If they were submissive, apart from extorting some 'reasonable burden,' they didn't poison them."

...

Huang Bingkun saw them discussing back and forth without the slightest intention of "loyalty to the monarch and serving the country," all thinking about their own affairs. He couldn't help but feel a bit stifled. Just as he wanted to find a reason to leave, suddenly another servant came in, whispered a few words, and presented a roll of paper.

Everyone looked again. It turned out that this was a vernacular Pacifying the People Notice. The content mainly strictly reiterated the laws: regardless of military or civilian personnel, anyone who robbed, set fire, or raped would be executed on the spot. A curfew was implemented, and going out was prohibited after the night watch started, etc. The notice also mentioned that the current officials and gentry living at home in Guangzhou City, as long as they did not gather crowds to resist the Heavenly Army, would definitely not be killed.

"What is the situation outside?" Young Master Lin asked.

"The Hair-shorn thieves have troops patrolling. It looks like another kind of troops, wearing gray cloth jackets." The servant gestured, "Now each of the four city walls has one gate open for traffic, and some shops on the street have opened for business. Only the area around Tianzi Wharf outside the South Gate is completely prohibited from passing. I heard that a high official of the Australians arrived in a giant ship."

"Probably the Guangdong Commissioner of the Hair-shorn thieves has arrived. At the very least, it is the new Prefect of Guangzhou..."

"I think this Guangdong Commissioner must be Shopkeeper Guo. If so, it would be better!"

"What is the situation in various government offices? How are the lords?" Lin Zunxiu asked again.

"Very quiet. I heard someone committed suicide, but there is no definite news." The servant said, "The officers and soldiers in the city are now concentrating towards the Training Guerrilla Camp in the east of the city. I heard they are going to be inspected there."

"You may go."

The servant left. The table of people chattered about a lot more. seeing that they were all empty talk, full of ideas of sitting and waiting for death and resigning themselves to adversity, Huang Bingkun couldn't help but feel a bit bored, so he stood up to take his leave. Lin Zunxiu didn't ask him to stay either, and personally saw him out of the small courtyard, whispering: "Come here again at this time tomorrow. A VIP wants to see you—do not tell outsiders."

Huang Bingkun was stunned and said, "I understand. But how do I come in to find you?"

"When the time comes, I will naturally send someone to meet you."

Huang Bingkun walked out of the back door of Fangchun Courtyard and walked back along the way he came—he was not a local native, and after turning seven or eight times, he got lost. As he walked, he reached the main street. Looking again, the market on the street had recovered, and most shops had opened their doors. Although there were not many pedestrians, the panic and tense atmosphere just now was gone. He saw many ordinary families lighting incense at their gates, with the words "Obedient Subject" pasted on the lintels. A pain of national subjugation crept into his heart—is the Great Ming going to perish like this?

No, he absolutely did not agree with his father's statement of "adapting to the times." He wanted to continue fighting the Hair-shorn thieves! Thinking of this, he involuntarily quickened his pace and rushed towards the temple where he was staying.

The sky was already fully bright. In the Xin'an County seat not far from Humen, every household had their doors and windows tightly closed. Officers and soldiers holding swords and spears and civil militia were running on the streets, a scene of solemn killing before battle.

On the screen wall of the county yamen, more than a dozen human heads hung gracefully. One of them was exactly the Thousand-Household of the officers and soldiers originally stationed here. The others were nothing more than his trusted aides and personal soldiers.

This place was also called Nantou City. Because it was a coastal defense stronghold, the "Dongguan Guard Thousand-Household Office" was established here in the 14th year of Hongwu of Ming (1381). In the first year of Wanli (1573), it was expanded into the Xin'an County seat on the basis of the office city. The geographical location of Nantou was very important. Foreign ships going to Guangzhou had to go around Lantau Island and enter Humen via Nantou to enter the Pearl River, so Nantou was known as the "Gateway to the Whole of Guangdong."

However, in the previous invasion of the Pearl River by the Senate, Nantou did not play any role. The cannons on the city could not hit the sailing ships, and they were not opponents in water battles. So they just watched helplessly as the Pearl River Detachment passed under their eyelids.

This time, the garrison at Nantou was still powerless against the invading Senate fleet. But it did not open the city to surrender as expected. The "Leading Party" in Xin'an County encountered a strong opponent. The Xin'an Magistrate Wu Guangzhi had not been in office long; he was in the prime of his life and quite enterprising. Seeing the Australians pressing step by step, and the people's minds in the city floating—he had not witnessed the power of the Australians, so the thinking of "loyally serving the country" was still very strong, so he made preparations in secret. The Thousand-Household who had already become a "Leading Party" invited Wu Guangzhi to a banquet, originally intending to stage a Hongmen Banquet, but unexpectedly was counter-killed and captured by Magistrate Wu who was prepared early, and had his head chopped off directly.

Wu Guangzhi was transferred from Shaanxi where the roving bandits were most rampant, and his experience in "resisting thieves" was very extensive. After killing the Thousand-Household and his trusted aides, on one hand, he forced the big households in the city to take out money to pay salaries and rewards to the garrison to stabilize the morale of the army; on the other hand, he conscripted able-bodied men to block the four gates, preparing lime bottles and stones. When materials were insufficient, he tore down quite a few civilian houses.

By the time the sky was fully bright, the city wall was already "Strictly guarded" and "waiting in battle array."

In this way, the National Army, which was originally prepared to station in Xin'an County, was blocked outside the city. Seeing that the city gate would not open, calling for surrender was unheeded, and instead a few human heads were thrown out, the naturalized citizen County Office Director leading the team knew that a glitch had occurred, and hurriedly sent someone to Humen to report to Shi Zhiqi.

Shi Zhiqi knew that the National Army had no heavy weapons and insufficient training, making it difficult for them to take on the heavy responsibility of attacking fortifications. He had to send a Marine platoon and 3 double-masted patrol boats to reinforce Xin'an.

Nantou City was right by the Pearl River. The patrol boats sailed to the shore, dropped anchor, and bombarded Nantou City with the 12-pound cannons on the boats. The 2 naval guns on the patrol boats fired together, and in a few minutes, the gate tower on the Ningnan Gate in the south was riddled with holes and caught fire.

Magistrate Wu Guangzhi was very calm. While commanding the militia to extinguish the fire, he ordered the two cannons on the city to fire back. The top of the wall of Nantou City was 1 zhang thick and the bottom was 2 zhang thick, with rammed earth inside and wrapped in gray bricks outside. It was still somewhat effective in resisting the impact of solid cannonballs. There were only 6 naval guns in total on the patrol boats, failing to form a superiority in firepower. The two sides exchanged fire for a few rounds. Although many battlements and checkpoints on the city were destroyed, the defense on the city was not shaken.

Seeing that the artillery fire could not shake the defense, the Marine platoon leader prepared to attack the city directly. Although he only had thirty men, the Marine Corps had always been known for its excellent equipment and training. They had done this kind of training for attacking fortifications countless times. There was a complete city-breaching tactic of fire suppression - projecting smoke grenades for cover - explosive delivery. A box of high-density black powder was enough to blow open most city gates.

However, the naturalized citizen County Office Director was unwilling to storm the city. After all, once the city was broken by force, there would be great destruction to public and private lives and properties in the county town. So he advocated persuading surrender again, striving to open the city without bloodshed.

The sound of cannons had stopped. Wu Guangzhi told the soldiers to seize the time to take turns eating breakfast. There was also an outer pass outside the Ningnan Gate called Ying'en Gate. Magistrate Wu presided over the resistance here. He didn't have many troops. The combat soldiers and miscellaneous soldiers from the incorporated Thousand-Household Office were no more than five hundred, plus the mobilized militia, the total was less than two thousand. It seemed like a lot, but the Hair-shorn thieves outside the city had excellent firearms and were well-trained, so he did not send troops out of the city to counterattack.

The Hair-shorn thieves outside the city shouted to the defending soldiers and civilians from time to time, advising them to tie up the magistrate and the Thousand-Household and surrender, so as to avoid slaughter. Many soldiers of the National Army were conscripted from the Hong Kong Reclamation Regiment. They usually traveled frequently in this area and were very familiar with most of the local people. Therefore, even if they were very close, the able-bodied men and local military household soldiers on the city did not fire cannons or arrows. Sometimes seeing that the magistrate's personal guards were not around, they would stick their heads out to look at the National Army, and the bold ones even talked to the people below.
