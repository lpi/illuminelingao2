# Chapter 2001 - Two Senators Caring About Naturalized Citizens' Marriage Problem (II)

Guangzhou has hundreds of thousands population. Is 17th Century China South biggest city. Appropriate age females definitely not few. Wang Jun calculated. Totally no need to put eyes on "Female Prisoner" or "Chaste Woman"—That has only how many people.

Next he worried again. Guangzhou appropriate age single females indeed not few. But cannot rely on self connecting bridge one by one. If saying opening a Matchmaking Agency. This spacetime has no such precedent. But has Official Matchmaker selling matching relations—Because Official Matchmaker selling mostly light crime female prisoners. Such matter also doesn't happen often.

Guangzhou common people marriage status. Roughly still "Order of Parents, Word of Matchmaker." Wedding has luxurious has simple. But process basically all same—Even water people like Dan Households also so.

Wang Jun considered possibility of opening Matchmaking Agency in 17th Century Guangzhou seriously. Felt difficulty somewhat big. And not his expert field either—He never was Union Activist. Relation with "Auntie Red Matchmaker" in enterprise not good either. Had no relevant knowledge in this aspect. Searching intestine scraping stomach for half day couldn't think out how to run Matchmaking Agency.

He thought here felt brain pain. Couldn't help muttering a sentence: "MD. This is more laborious than going Blind Dating daily back then!"

However this sentence immediately hooked up his inspiration. He thought of past events forced by dad mom to go Blind Dating. That Matchmaking Agency beside introducing partner alone. Still often engaged "Blind Date Party." Gathering males females with similar conditions in various aspects together engaging BBQ, Self Driving whatever. During period hooked up successfully quite a few people.

"This method good ha!" Wang Jun seemed discovering New Continent. Of course Self Driving Tour and Wild BBQ couldn't run in 17th Century. But other forms of Blind Date Assembly could run.

He searched intestine scraped stomach for half day. Thought of running Ball [dance party]—But Social Dance this thing in Lingao only girls of Woman Arts and Science College learned. Even Senators knowing this not many. Besides males females hugging together Peng-Cha-Cha. In place like Lingao no problem. In Guangzhou this place with serious "Feudal Remnant" obviously inevitably too shocking to world. Probably local single women would be scared away once news published.

Thinking again he truly couldn't think out any new form. Thought simply run a simplest "Beating Drum Passing Flower" Blind Date Assembly. "Mutual Selection" then—Such Blind Date Assembly he also participated. Also ran for naturalized citizens in Lingao. But those able to enjoy this treatment mostly were Officers and Cadres, Technical Workers among naturalized citizens.

Thinking here he immediately wrote a "Warmth Overflowing" letter to this unnoticed Senator Du. Expressing self supporting his idea. Willing to discuss "Solving Marriage Problem for Naturalized Citizens" together with him.

Here Senator Du's "Female Prisoner Plan" not approved. Then directly went to Liu Xiang—Liu Xiang hearing he came to talk "Naturalized Citizen Marriage" problem. Then directly pushed saying self no time. Let Zhang Yunmi receive him.

Du Yibin didn't expect meeting Zhang Yunmi—Actually he didn't know Zhang Yunmi. Just after that "Fierce Concubine" case Big Name of Zhang family father and daughter spread whole Senate. And Zhang Yunmi coming to Guangzhou to take office was also on Government Gazette.

Crossing 6 years. Du Yibin although age near thirty. But essentially still that university student. Thanks to General Office Life Secretary welfare and Parents' meticulous care coming with him. When facing Female Senator still had university student's greenness. Suddenly facing a youth beautiful, lively lovely young sister. This specific plan introduction also became stuttering.

Zhang Yunmi listened to his plan. Flipped files again. Frowned brows.

"Pushing Monogamy is one of Senate New Life Movement articles. How can we take lead violating. Even if they are disabled soldiers. Cannot engage Specialization. Besides although female prisoners committed crime. Also are women. Also have Marriage Autonomy! You this proposal allocating them like things to whom. This violates Men Women Equality spirit advocated by Senate..."

"Mm. This. Actually doesn't matter. Not engaging two wives... Mm. Matter of Female Prisoner not engaging. Mainly still want finding some women marrying disabled naturalized citizens taking care of their life. Establishing family. Passing ancestry connecting generation. So I consider whether can among Chaste Women of Pure Chaste Hall..."

"Taking care of their life should be. But why must marry them?!" Zhang Yunmi couldn't think through. "Disabled naturalized citizens of course very pitiable. Also have merit to Senate. But this and emotion are two matters okay! Marriage Freedom Marriage Autonomy. Isn't this thing we propagating daily? Now engaging such organization arrangement. Very disrespectful to female. Cannot because we liberated Guangzhou, liberated those pitiable Chaste Women then pose as Benefactor. Interfering others' private life casually."

Zhang Yunmi age young. Also influenced by 21st Century pop novels. More or less still had some "Love Supreme" concept. Originally very resisting to Senate "Arranged Marriage."

But her speech full article all Big Principles. Choking Du Yibin speechless. But he this plan must obtain Guangzhou City Government support—Now Compassion Hall [Cihui Hall] contained hundreds of homeless Chaste Women from Guangdong various places Pure Chaste Halls, Chaste Women Halls etc. Unfortunately. Zhang Yunmi was City Government Secretary cum Comprehensive Governance Vice Director. Since Liu Xiang unwilling to manage this matter must pass through her.

"Marriage Autonomy is right. But condition we give not bad either. Wudaokou side already promised me: If she agrees marrying disabled naturalized citizen. These disabled personnel outside original wage give extra 1.5 times Family Subsidy Home..."

"This is Buying Selling Marriage. Not good not good." Zhang Yunmi head shook more fiercely.

"This—"

Du Yibin speech blocked. He truly couldn't think out any other reason to persuade opponent. Only said after half day: "These people crippled for Senate. Some are Work Injury some are Battle Field Injury... If we don't help them solving Life Big Matter. They won't have family this lifetime. They originally all were healthy people na..."

This slightly sorrowful sentence somewhat moved Zhang Yunmi. She was somewhat difficult. Said: "This matter I also bad to make decision. After all is woman lifetime thing. Still need conscious voluntary. If they willing to marry. I don't oppose—Mayor Liu won't oppose either."

Senator Du returned Guest House. Somewhat gray heart depressed air. Didn't go to canteen for dinner even. Felt self so failed. Lying on bed thinking how to persuade Song Yingsheng thoroughly again—This was his biggest "Harvest" after going to Enping. Even had feeling of Strange Goods Hoarding.

Song Yingsheng this person name not seen in classics. Only had his record in Local Chronicle. But he was Elder Brother of a "Contemporary Figure" Senate internal evaluation quite high Song Yingxing.

Song Yingxing at this time just right strong year. Now also precisely time he teaching as Instructor in Fenyi County School [Jiangxi], concentrating on writing. Inside Senate not only one Senator had intention of recruiting this Ming Dynasty Scientist. Even Yangtze River Special Task Group dispatched by Intelligence Bureau conducted some relevant activities.

Although temporarily didn't recruit him. But catching his Big Brother was also harvest. Du Yibin specially concerned National Army Captain going to accept Enping: Must catch Enping Magistrate alive.

Song Yingsheng though not a celebrity. But temperament quite fierce. After Southern Ming fell he took poison suicide martyring country. Loyalty to Great Ming can be seen a spot. So catching him alive also wasted some effort. Du Yibin through Intelligence Bureau inside line in Enping before breaking city. Finally captured him alive before he suicide.

After Song Yingsheng captured then soft detained in County Yamen. Enjoying "Preferential Treatment" making him scratching not head brain. Originally captured local officials like him all need sending to Guangzhou Screening uniformly. Because to Du Yibin's special request only kept in county.

Pity Du Yibin persuasion power limited. Although used whole body skills. Although Song Yingsheng bad no meaning of "Martyring Country." Very polite to him too. But till now still refused to "Surrender Song." This time he specially brought him to Guangzhou. Wanting to let him look "New Atmosphere."

"This old man also stubborn verify tight!" He complained secretly. Thinking after arriving mainland various matters not smooth. Inevitably thought of Dad Mom and Life Secretary left in Lingao again.

While bored and lay. His gaze fell on desk. Piled above some correspondences. He read one by one. Suddenly saw a "Private Memorandum." Sender was a Senator he didn't know.

"Who is Wang Jun?" Du Yibin opened envelope curiously.

Two days later. In South Sea Coffee House Great World Branch. Du Yibin met Wang Jun.

After two people greeted. Immediately started warm discussion on "Naturalized Citizen Marriage Problem." Du Yibin told result of him seeing Zhang Yunmi.

"This sister full mouth all Big Principles. I can't speak over her." Du Yibin somewhat depressed. "I mouth clumsy."

Wang Jun thought you this proposal placed in past naturally nothing. But influence of 21st Century left Political Correctness in Senate still not small. Many clauses inside simply full of "Incorrectness."

"This proposal best need rewriting." Wang Jun thought said. "Men Women Equality is one of Senate Pillar Policies. You write what 'Distributing Wife' 'Distributing Two Wives' these. Isn't it strictly doing against Senate policy? Besides how those Female Senators think?"

"This I knew. You say. How to fix!"

"I see writing so. Proposal then. Just write solving Naturalized Citizen Cadre Staff Marriage Problem. Don't specially write 'Disabled Naturalized Citizen Staff.' Such audience face bigger. And avoiding Disabled—Actually everyone very clear. Under normal circumstance how can healthy woman willing to marry disabled person? Nothing more than relying on Spirit and Material stimulation. Plus some Administrative Force—You started hitting Female Prisoner idea also because of this. Train of thought good. But these all are Dark. Cannot write openly."
