# Chapter 2051 - Act Quickly

Wang Qiyi's head spun. Wu Mu had likely already dispatched agents to Hong Kong. When you connected the threads of information, even a layman could see it—the Shi family wasn't just problematic. It was explosive.

He realized with sudden clarity that this case touched multiple jurisdictions. The moment it crossed into "anti-Executive Committee activities," Political Security could swoop in with any shred of substantive evidence and claim the entire investigation, relegating his bureau to mere "co-investigators."

That wouldn't do. Not after all this effort. Wang Qiyi refused to let others harvest what he'd sown.

Never mind Smith's actual crimes. Strike first, claim the advantage. Even if the fellow truly belonged to some underground network, the Tax Bureau would make the arrest. Wang Qiyi turned to Yao Yulan. "Anything else?"

"That's everything of substance. The Police Bureau is investigating the counterfeit currency separately, but Inspector Lian isn't involved in that area, so she couldn't provide details."

"Understood. Thank you, Team Leader Yao." Wang Qiyi shifted his attention to Chu Xiaoran and Xu Zhewei. "How did your visit to the Shi family go? Did you see Smith?"

Xu Zhewei glanced at Chu Xiaoran. She gestured for him to continue. "Report, Director Wang. The Shi family was very cooperative. We met Smith and conveyed the officials' message. He expressed great honor at the Executive Committee's recognition and said he would participate actively in the training. He asked several policy questions, which Sister Chu answered."

"Nothing else?" Wang Qiyi asked when Xu Zhewei stopped.

"Nothing else."

*Pretty steady, Young Master Shi,* Wang Qiyi thought. *But soon you'll learn what it means for disaster to fall from a clear sky.* He mentally calculated how long Wu Mu's people would need for the Hong Kong round trip, then assessed his own timeline.

"Alright, I'm assigning tasks. Xu Zhewei, retrieve all materials on the Shi family—the old store, the Sanya branch, the Hong Kong warehouse. Everything we have at the bureau. Bring it here. We're working centrally, and everyone must master this case completely. We have twenty-four hours!"

"Director Wang, are we launching a full investigation of the Shi family?" Huang Ping's mind worked quickly. Hearing the twenty-four-hour deadline, he knew leadership wanted an arrest—and he'd be called into action again. His excitement was palpable.

"Yes. Just because the Shi family hid deep doesn't mean our Tax Bureau lacks teeth. We're going to fight a beautiful battle and not let others steal our thunder." Wang Qiyi rallied his troops.

"So... Director Wang, do you think the Shi family has serious problems?" Chu Xiaoran's question made Wang Qiyi frown. This wasn't a question she should be asking him. Still, he didn't take it to heart and waved dismissively. "The Shi family's problems are enormous—hanging a few from lampposts wouldn't be unjust. Did you forget what Director Ai said when we established this task force? Guangzhou is the Executive Committee's domain. Go investigate thoroughly. Investigate hard. What, feeling sorry for them?"

"Hahaha, how could that be?" The room erupted in laughter. "Director Wang, we guarantee we'll complete the mission!"

"Good!" Wang Qiyi nodded firmly. "That's the spirit I want. Xiao Hu, get coffee to perk everyone up. We'll..." He was about to say "pull an all-nighter" but swallowed the words.

Seeing Chu Xiaoran's sallow complexion, Zeng Juan and Huang Ping's haggard faces—even Yao Yulan looked worn, despite maintaining her composure—he changed course. "Let's aim to review the case this afternoon, get a proper night's sleep, and hit it hard tomorrow!"

In the early morning, Guangzhou's eastern horizon showed only the faintest hint of pale dawn. Early risers were just beginning to wash their faces. The whole city seemed suspended in last night's dreams, quiet and still.

Through the thin mist, the sudden clatter of wheels and hooves shattered the silence. Several dark blue lacquered carriages emerged from the fog, pulling up before a vermilion gate with a coachman's low "whoa." Before the vehicles had even stopped, the doors flew open and strapping men leaped out one after another, lips pressed tight, expressions grim. They wore full-coverage steel helmets, dark blue uniforms matching the carriages, black tactical vests, and military boots. The metallic clinking as they moved made clear their armament extended well beyond the six-shot revolvers in their hands.

No warnings. No announcements. The men dispersed immediately, taking up assault positions. Then the vermilion gate crashed inward under the battering ram's blows, and the ready team poured into the compound. Their urgent footsteps woke the household. Screams and cries erupted in chaos.

"Great Song Executive Committee Economic Major Cases Investigation Division!" Yao Yulan and Huang Ping, pistols in right hands and credentials displayed in left, each led an elite squad charging through the crowd toward the rear courtyard. The bright white characters "PAYING TAXES IS GLORIOUS" emblazoned across the backs of their tactical vests gleamed brilliantly in the morning sun.

Moments later, Wang Qiyi stepped unhurriedly over the threshold, Glock in hand, and stood on the steps surveying the Shi family members huddled in the front courtyard. "Investigation Division operation! Men to the left! Women to the right! Ladyboys in the middle!"

...

Ahem.

Director Wang's dreams were always this full of swagger. Of course, it was only a dream. Last night, Director Zhang had strictly ordered him to remain as commander, to give the younger cadres opportunities to train, to learn proper delegation.

Shaking his groggy head, Wang Qiyi savored the pleasant fantasy once more. *Hmm... maybe "PAYING TAXES IS GLORIOUS" shouldn't be on the vest backs—the Major Cases Investigation Division's authority isn't limited to taxation...* How about "ECONOMIC GUARDIANS"? Feeling he'd debugged an issue, Wang Qiyi licked his lips in satisfaction, then remembered those four characters had been used by the domestic economic police back in his old timeline. Come to think of it, they aligned darkly well with the Investigation Bureau's mission.

Yao Yulan and Huang Ping stood before his desk, fully equipped and ready. "Alright, I won't waste words. It's now five minutes to six." Wang Qiyi checked his watch. "You must arrive at the Shi residence to make the arrest by six-thirty. Political Security and Police are already en route to assist... Go!"

Last night, Wang Qiyi had thought it through and decided to call both Mu Min and Wu Mu. Arresting Young Master Shi with only two people from the Economic Major Cases Investigation Bureau carried unnecessary risk. As an Elder, he could bypass Political Security and Police to coordinate directly with the National Army, but that would look unseemly. Turnabout was fair play—Wu Mu had called him during the last arrest, so if only for appearances, he couldn't fail to notify the other two this time. Besides, all three agencies had already coordinated at the municipal government meeting. There had to be mutual benefit; post-operation summaries needed phrases like "provided full cooperation" and "worked in close coordination."

After giving his instructions, Wang Qiyi tried to stand and see them off, but when he pushed himself up, his body refused to cooperate.

"Director Wang, are you alright?" Huang Ping nimbly stepped forward, reaching out to support him.

"I'm fine. Time is of the essence—go. Stay safe, and let their people handle the dangerous parts first." Wang Qiyi waved them off and awkwardly sat back down.

Watching the two close the door behind them, Wang Qiyi grabbed his cup and gulped down strong tea, exhaled deeply, then slowly pushed himself up from the table.

After stretching his back, he drank down the "Kidney Restoration Elixir" specially supplied by Runshi Hall, then paced slowly around the office, wondering whether to stop by Ai Zhixin's office once working hours began. By Executive Committee standards, with everyone being Elders and him senior to Ai Zhixin in the original cohort, he shouldn't need this "morning report, evening briefing" routine. But ever since he'd noticed the vague hostility between his wife and Ai Zhixin, Wang Qiyi felt he should manage the relationship with this colleague who technically outranked him by half a level. Ai Zhixin was capable and driven, and the Tax Bureau's smooth operations on all fronts owed much to his skilled coordination. Plus, he responded well to flattery. Whether professionally or personally, positioning himself properly as Deputy Director was the wisest course.

Lost in thought, Wang Qiyi was suddenly seized by an inexplicable chill, and his eyelid began twitching incessantly. *Damn, was it the right eye for disaster or fortune?* He tidied up his desk as the work whistle sounded. Wang Qiyi picked up the case progress summary he'd written last night, skimmed it again, and seeing no major issues, tucked it into his notebook and prepared to find Ai Zhixin. Just then came a knock.

"Report!"

"Come in."

Seeing Nan Wan'er lead in a visibly anxious Liu Cuihua, Wang Qiyi tensed. *Please don't let there be a fatal incident at the girls' dormitory.*

The Tax Bureau employed many young women, making it a target of constant attention from naturalized male cadres. Back when this group of girls was still preparing to leave Lingao, Ai Zhixin had thoughtfully arranged two "dormitory matrons" and even drawn up a formal dormitory "self-governance" system with a five-person management group that rotated every six months. If Wang Qiyi remembered correctly, the current group leader was this Liu Cuihua.

"..."

"Director Wang, there's something we need to report," Nan Wan'er said, seeing Liu Cuihua hang her head, too frightened to speak. "Chu Xiaoran from Dorm 203 on the second floor requested leave to go out last night and hasn't returned on time this morning."

"Mm." Wang Qiyi hummed absently. He knew why Liu Cuihua was afraid to speak. According to Ai Zhixin's self-governance rules, the group leader was responsible for conducting a headcount every night when the dormitory locked up at eleven and reporting the results—along with any personnel on leave—to the municipal bureau's duty office. Clearly, Liu Cuihua had failed to do so.
