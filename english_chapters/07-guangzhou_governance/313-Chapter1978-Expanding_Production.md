# Chapter 1978 - Expanding Production

"Mm, mm... the taste is still lacking a bit." Zhang Xiaoqi sat in the shop hall chewing the pancake made under her personal "guidance," feeling something was missing in her mouth. Lacking potato shreds and carrots was a problem, but it seemed there was still something less compared to the Veggie Pancake in her impression.

Watching Nan Wan'er order a second portion, she still hadn't figured out what exactly was missing. Chili not spicy enough? Cumin too little? None seemed to be the key...

Here, as soon as they entered the room, they were spotted by Dong Mingdang managing behind the counter. Miss Dong and Liu Xiang's Life Secretary Guo Xi'er were bosom friends. With daily influence and the unique demeanor and figure of Senators, she recognized at a glance that the woman with two children was a genuine Australian. Naturally, she took the opportunity of delivering pancakes to socialize. She immediately served two bowls of thin porridge.

Zhang Xiaoqi saw this "thin porridge" wasn't the locally common "congee" boiled with peanut oil until rice grains bloomed and became snow-white and thick, but "porridge" so thin one could hardly see rice grains. Stirring with a spoon, it was a mix of rice and millet. Exactly the porridge drunk with pancakes at home in early years; she felt great affection in her heart.

"Greetings Chief, wonder if the pancake suits Chief's taste?"

The girl before Zhang Xiaoqi gave a light curtsy gracefully. She was about Nan Wan'er's age. Over the common skirt and jacket, she wore a blue-and-white sleeveless long vest. At a glance, one knew it was a modified version produced by "Huaxia Society," giving an indescribable sense of dissonance.

"Quite good. Are you Dong Mingdang?"

"It is this slave."

"Not busy right now, right? Guoguo, you go to Auntie's side. I heard about you, Miss Dong, before coming to Guangzhou. Heard you are a capable woman."

"I dare not; those are exaggerated praises from outside." Dong Mingdang lowered her head. "This slave opening this shop is also out of necessity. First to support my mother, second to respond to the Senate's proposition of 'Self-reliance, Production for Self-salvation'..."

Zhang Xiaoqi was a bit surprised. She originally thought this Miss Dong was just the kind of pungent and capable street shop proprietress she often saw in the past. Unexpectedly, she not only had the full airs of a "Big Miss" but also spoke logically. Especially this sentence "Self-reliance, Production for Self-salvation"—although one of the slogans painted on the streets, local people didn't take it seriously. They just looked and passed. Unexpectedly, this woman remembered it clearly and used it appropriately!

"This is our Finance and Tax Bureau's Chief Zhang." Nan Wan'er stood up, pulled Guoguo over, and introduced.

"Come, sit down and chat."

"This slave can just stand to reply." Dong Mingdang's attitude was respectful yet graceful. Completely the demeanor of a great family; Zhang Xiaoqi had a very good impression of her.

"Come sit, don't be polite. I'm not used to you standing while talking."

This was a bit heavy. Dong Mingdang immediately apologized for taking a seat and pulled a stool to sit diagonally opposite her.

Indeed a lady from a big household; appearance and behavior were truly different. Zhang Xiaoqi secretly praised in her heart, involuntarily comparing Nan Wan'er with her—indeed there was a big gap.

"You understand the Senate's policies quite well..."

"I dare not say understand. Since this slave is under Great Song's rule, naturally I must understand Great Song's reasoning..."

Zhang Xiaoqi nodded with a smile. She wasn't interested in these "reasonings" of "Senate" and "Great Song"; at night she would tease Vice Director Wang about them after lights out. But for the other party to quote these routines fluently was not bad; this ability to comprehend new things far exceeded Nan Wan'er.

Looking this little woman up and down, she seemed less than twenty, but her expression was seasoned, exuding a shrewd and capable flavor all over, which made Zhang Xiaoqi slightly dislike her.

However, for a young girl to support such a shop, even if secretly supported by a legendary Senator, was after all not an easy thing. Truly, without some color, one dares not open a dye shop.

Zhang Xiaoqi's gossip heart rose, so she mentioned intentionally or unintentionally:

"This sleeveless vest on you is a new release from Lingao."

"Yes, heard it's a new style from the Cooperative."

......

So the three women gossiped for a while about the improved Hanfu appearing on the market recently. Unfortunately, Zhang Xiaoqi didn't find out where Miss Dong got this outfit in the end—undoubtedly given by someone, because it was impossible to buy such clothing locally. No matter how she insinuated, Dong Mingdang always changed the subject with a modest smile.

Zhang Xiaoqi felt slightly disappointed. She turned to look around the shop. The small shop was clean and tidy, showing much effort spent. However, although the Dong Family Shop had high popularity, the flow of people was all at the outside stall. Inside the room, seats for dining in were never full. Of the ten or so tables, three or four were always empty.

"There aren't many people dining in here..."

"Thanks to Chief Liu and other Chiefs' care, this slave's small shop can exist peacefully till now. We orphans and widow don't seek wealth pouring in, just relying on this for food and clothing."

"Sister, you probably don't have just this little ambition. Chief Zheng said you aren't such a person."

"Chief mocks me. The only staff here are Lan'er and her man Dong Xiang. Moreover, we master and servants are all laymen. Having a small situation to work on now is already content. Fewer people dining in means I alone can attend to the shop."

"You plan to guard a stall and muddle along?" Zhang Xiaoqi felt she wasn't such a person. "This shop has very high fame in Guangzhou now; it's a pity not to utilize it well. Add some varieties, sell some dishes, wine, and meat..."

"This slave's shop, honestly speaking, is a small capital business where water doesn't cover the instep," Dong Mingdang said. "Chief don't laugh; since Chief Liu built the vegetable wholesale market, vegetable prices on the market dropped a few wen per jin. This slave feels doing this business is much more relaxed. As for preparing some hard dishes, that's something I dare not even think about..."

Zhang Xiaoqi knew this matter. Banning the Guan Di Temple gang, building a wholesale market, breaking the past violent monopoly on vegetable wholesale—not only was vegetable supply in the four countrysides greatly smooth, but it also facilitate circulation tax collection. It was a governance measure Grand Magistrate Liu was quite proud of.

However, Miss Dong saying this actually meant her own capital was small and couldn't afford bigger business. Zhang Xiaoqi looked around the food sold in the shop; meat besides pig head meat was various offals. Obviously, they couldn't afford to make "expensive dishes" here.

"Small capital business also has many tricks." Zhang Xiaoqi said, "Look at those buying pancakes; found anything?"

"Many cadres?"

"No."

"Many young people."

"Also no. You didn't realize there are many women? Let me tell you, these things you make are 'snacks'—even after a few hundred years, women are more willing to eat these things. Men prefer getting a table and drinking some small wine—have you seen a few big men huddling head-to-head gnawing veggie pancakes and chatting?"

"What Chief says is true." Dong Mingdang smiled slightly. Indeed, among naturalized citizens buying pancakes, women accounted for the majority.

However, the Chief only saw the situation at this mealtime. She had observed the customer source herself; usually, men were still the majority, mostly laborers, eating a veggie pancake costing little but satisfying craving.

But since this female Chief spoke to her seriously, she naturally couldn't refute.

"So Chief means letting this slave add people and stalls, increase variety, and do more men's business?"

"About there. Besides Lan'er couple, find two more female workers to continue making Pancake Rolls. The key is you have to change this counter: you can collect money and issue tokens uniformly at the counter. Wait for them to finish making, then collect food by token... By the way, can you make Sandwiches (Jia Bing)? What about Teppanyaki? And Malatang and Oden (Guandongzhu)? This is simpler, no need for block meat. Let me tell you, it doesn't use much oil either. Also I see you still use a spreader for pancakes; if you add a small stick to this board vertically to form a T-shape, then spin and scrape like this, isn't it faster and lighter..."

Dong Mingdang didn't know which nerve of this Chief Zhang opposite was wrongly connected, eyes shining and talking non-stop for an hour, wishing she could learn to make these things immediately. Naturally, she hadn't seen Oden, didn't know what Malatang was, and even impossibly know how things were made from the Chief's few sentences. Mother said, the simplest thing in the world is cooking; the hardest is also cooking. Is making steamed buns easy? White flour adds water, old dough leavening, alkali kneading, yet some people can't do it well! How could these strange dishes and dim sum be explained clearly in a few sentences? Besides, whether people were willing to eat was another matter.

Although disapproving, she listened with a smile throughout, but calculated in her heart: what did this Chief Zhang mean? Although her small shop was "thunderous" in Guangzhou city, it was ultimately just a small eatery, truly a business small as can be. The Chief surely didn't fancy her shop? Or else? Could it be some Chief fancied her and intended to use her to matchmake?

She calculated in her heart but listened extremely attentively on her face, asking a few sentences from time to time. Finally, the Chief stopped talking with unexhausted interest. She then asked a question cautiously: "Chief Zhang, will there be so many people coming? Not many women eat out on the streets of Guangzhou city."

"What are you worrying about!" Zhang Xiaoqi was full of confidence. "Don't look at few women on the streets now; soon Guangzhou Girls' School and primary/middle schools will open. Various factories and shops have already started recruiting female workers. Plus there will be a large batch of female cadres coming to support Guangdong construction. You fear no one will patronize? Of course, your taste can't be all Shandong flavor; after all, locals are still the majority."

"Yes." Dong Mingdang wasn't interested in painting big cakes, but she still revealed a look of "trust" and "full of hope," allowing Zhang Xiaoqi to fully satisfy her desire for "planning and guiding."

Driven by the impulse of fully satisfied emotions, Zhang Xiaoqi said: "Don't you feel meat is expensive and can't make meat dishes? Next time I'll teach you to make Braised Meat (Zha Rou)!"
