# Chapter 1998 - The Shi Young Master Keeping Pace with Times

Sleeping on bed, Huang Ping eyes bright, unable to sleep for a time, brain full of investigation details.

Although studying tax law not for long, he still understood the concept of "Tax Avoidance."

Legal tax avoidance was not a modern concept; it existed in ancient times. Taking the Land Tax collected by government as example, various tricks existed. Huang Family was initially "Powerful Gentry" of Lingao too. Huang Ping was Shi Young Master Huang's body-serving servant, knew somewhat about thresholds inside.

These routines of Shi Family were not fresh things to him: Australians changed rules of collecting tax, Shi Family also followed "Keeping Pace with Times"—drilled holes of regulations.

"No wonder Old Money can become more and more rich." Huang Ping thought in heart. If ordinary common people, would faint seeing these articles, let alone researching out a path.

But speaking of it, ordinary common people didn't even recognize a few big characters, let alone these mouth-twisting articles!

Actually the question Zeng Juan asked today although somewhat losing face, was key to Shi Family tax avoidance. This Shi Second Young Master counted eating through finance and tax clauses: Sanya Tax Exempt. Property Tax is territorial management. As transferring money from Guangzhou to Sanya, naturally Property Tax need not pay a penny. This move used not only wonderful, but also very not easy: Among local big households in Guangzhou, those able to know tax clauses well were few already, let alone needing to know tax preference clauses of Sanya hundred of miles away. This Shi Family was truly news informed very much!

Looks like Shi Family is more powerful than Liang Family. Huang Ping thought in heart. No wonder Chief Wang wanted to send self here to check accounts. Beginning he more or less felt making big fuss over small issue. Still Chief looks clearly!

Next day, Huang Ping asked local tax collection department, mobilizing copyists, to copy Tianrui Garden account books.

"All account books, copy one set entirely." Huang Ping said. "Also all current vouchers, must register and make list one by one."

Night already deep. Lamp on desk still on. Wang Qiyi rubbed face and drank a big mouthful of strong tea like ox again to make himself feel clearer. Staying up late working was what he hated deeply painful. But when Zeng Juan Huang Ping group report sent two city government meetings were waiting him. No way only could drag report to read at night.

Situation already clear. Shi Family first transferred large amount of liquid assets into Sanya Branch Tianrui Garden through DeLong, then taking advantage of Joint Venture and Merchant Introduction convenience moved main production into Sanya, completing reasonable tax avoidance. But this was unavoidable matter. Sanya reducing exempting tax inviting merchants attracting capital was Senate fixed policy when Wang Luobin ruled. Similarly Mainland merchants like Shi Family although not many but those going from Hainan various counties to Sanya building branches even directly moving business over unknown how many. Snowy white sugar, gorgeous silk porcelain, Australian various fresh gadgets and their huge import demand also made European various countries value this New Commercial Port with better location lower tax rate more and more. Sanya Free Port positioning also brought Foreign Merchant Halls lining up row purely constantly adding height adding size on both sides of Cape Avenue.

Wind cool. Wang Qiyi still shook palm fan lightly. When re-assessing Property Tax early this year, Shi Family took out DeLong remittance documents requesting reduction of Liquid Capital Amount calculated based on real estate. No one cared then. If not Meng Xian utilizing this matter as example when drinking saying their business form was not small good but big good, Wang Qiyi probably wouldn't know this crop at all. Joint Venture, Building Factory, Remittance, Transfer. Shi Family walked this step by step truly careful steady.

Everything looked legal reasonable. Truly his own blind suspicion without reason? Senate tax rate not high. For saving this little tax creating such big formation even moving Old Shop foundation, couldn't match how to look with this era native's widely seeking stability mentality. Then where is problem exactly?

Gaze returned to account books just browsed roughly on left hand side. Zeng Juan and Huang Ping copied General Ledger of current period and Classification Ledger they thought key entirely bringing back. This earnest steady work attitude made Wang Qiyi very happy. Account books not many only two three volumes. Wang Qiyi felt not to disappoint subordinate's hardship, still should read carefully once.

Mm? Is this Running Water [cash flow] too many? Just when Wang Qiyi prepared to give Shi Family a Law Abiding Citizen conclusion, Running Water of Tianrui Garden Hong Kong Warehouse on last account book made his eyes shine, sat up from chair fiercely. Hong Kong Warehouse... Sanya Warehouse... Workshop... Raw Material... Wang Qiyi spread three account books all open, picking up pen comparing one by one.

So that is it! Not flipping to last few numbers yet, Wang Qiyi basically understood the trick of stealing beam changing pillar of this Shi Second Young Master. Warehouse Tianrui Garden leased on Hong Kong Island, nominally was Sanya Factory transit warehouse in mainland, actually Shi Family did Second Hand Peddler through it earning price difference greatly. Silk products and ceramics etc. Shi Family purchased from mainland utilized telegraph directly entering account in Tianrui Garden, but goods only transported to Hong Kong Warehouse, then sold in name of Tianrui Garden. Payment also remitted to Sanya through Delong. After enjoying reduction even exemption of tax in Sanya locally, then took Tax Payment Certificate to Hong Kong Customs to offset tax through Great Wave scheduled ship. Finally buyer only needed to pick up goods in Hong Kong or undertake transport out of border by Shi Family. Shi Family relying on good benefit of Tax Exemption could press Hong Kong Warehouse shipping price lower much. So business very good. Looking from Running Water this half year sales volume increased more than one tenth.

"Tsk tsk, Shi Young Master oh Shi Young Master, you are still too guts small." Wang Qiyi turned pen in hand, smacked mouth not without regret. Why must sell in name of Tianrui Garden? Buying in Old Shop name Selling in Old Shop name, then sales income proceeds hang accounts receivable in Old Shop, actual payment let buyer hit into Sanya Tianrui Garden account directly. This branch Tianrui Garden and Guangzhou Shop are still one family. Mutual goods adjusting not paying money doesn't count sales. Why cannot utilize? Like this not paying a penny of Business Tax, isn't it having one layer profit more than your current Halving Preference enjoyed in Sanya? Sigh... Pity pity. Wang Qiyi shook head shook brain quite some thought intent not finished.

Eh? Not right, seems butt sat crooked. Throwing away pencil taking back thoughts. Wang Qiyi stretched a lazy waist comfortably then shrank back into chair. Shi Family's small abacus is clear, but punishment is impossible. Must say problem, just Tax Registration Main Business not written complete, belonging to Out of Scope Operation. Fine is at most matter of one tael silver.

"Calling you engaging in mountain tops, calling you running horse circling land. What developing local economy. Being a local big officer butt doesn't know where to sit. Now looks good right. Fight ah Rob ah. Tax exemption not enough adding subsidy ah!" Wang Qiyi thought more and more had a kind of feeling of joy in calamity, involuntarily laughed out sound.

"Chief, what happy matter? Don't tell me Chief Zhang is coming?" Guard Mi Suisui coming in to pour water seeing Wang Qiyi laughing shaking fan alone alone joked casually.

"Little fart kid knows what. Play aside." Wang Qiyi temper very good, especially to these young lads not much bigger than own daughter. "I write a strip. You send to Comrade Huang Ping's dorm tomorrow morning."

Dismissing guard. Wang Qiyi sucked tea calculating whether seeking a day to meet this Shi Second Young Master. This Dandy is okay. Although Tax Collection is nothing more than Human Affairs, having no uncrossable gap on understanding. But able to use Senate cross-era technology power to avoid tax so quickly, accurately finding blank on tax management connection, shows also a talent. Much stronger than that whatever Liang Family cutting tail seeking life. Such talent, staying in folk earning money for own family too pity. Should call him out to serve Senate. Inside Senate always voice existing, requesting sending people to Europe engaging in speculation business cutting a few waves of leeks. But this matter Senator going personally inevitably not calculated. Dispatching these people to do perhaps better. Letting them bring own dry food. Senate provides necessary intelligence. Earned Senate shares half. In case losing...

He held back thoughts starting to run wild. This matter must be written heavily in internal report. Giving those Senator County Mayors City Mayors howling like wanting own life upon hearing Comprehensive Arrangement four words a good reminder. Let them understand understand what is Whole Nation One Chess Game. Wanting to bypass Finance and Tax Bureau doing alone? Waiting to be faced slapped by 17th Century natives.

"Chief, Bureau Chief Ai sent people asking, saying if you have read the application for that Special Expense?" A messenger came, asking at door.

"What Special Expense Special Expense?" Wang Qiyi strictly drafting in brain, interrupted by someone instantly lost good air.

"Is that 'Naturalized Cadre Family Life Promotion Memorandum' of Senator Du..."

"Oh, is this one." Wang Qiyi just regained spirit. Since they hung "Finance and Tax Bureau" plate, besides collecting money, must use money. Now system gradually perfected. Some extra-budgetary expenditures of Guangzhou City now all need clear budget and approval document to pay.

This so-called "Naturalized Cadre Family Life Promotion Memorandum" was issued by a Senator named Du Yibin. He is currently serving as County Director in Enping County. By speech condition of Enping County not peaceful—This Senator didn't know hwo to do, issuing such a memorandum to Liu Xiang inexplicably.

Content, actually not complex. Actually finding wives for naturalized citizens.

Gender imbalance of Senate rule existed long. Even after Engine Action such large scale population input, problem of marriage age female low, betrothal gift price oddly high still not solved. Not saying ordinary common people. Many male naturalized citizens didn't have wives, reduced to "Leftover Men."

Too many Leftover Men, tantamount to social unstable factor. Especially Fubo Army soldiers. Although engaged a officer and senior NCO marriage plan similar to "258 Regiment" [Communist rank requirement for bringing family], actually monks many gruel few. Still many people unable to solve spouse problem. As for ordinary soldiers, that basically had no hope.

Officers soldiers serving many years. Born into death. Even wife cannot marry. Can only rely on monthly issued Joy Coupon to solve sexual desire problem. No family life. No heirs. Influence on morale very big.

Now Senate occupied Guangdong. Added millions of population resource. Not solving this problem again couldn't be justified no matter how. Liu Xiang front foot entered Guangzhou. Back foot Civil Affairs Mouth and General Staff Political Department jointly issued a "Guidance Opinion" regarding soldier and cadre marriage problem.

Guidance Opinion is Guidance Opinion. How to implement is still a problem. Liu Xiang just entered city. Hundred wastes demanding prosperity. Plus big case important case one after another. Where can care about finding wives for subordinates. Once coming twice going left this matter down.

Unexpectedly this Enping County Director actively submitted document. Managing a matter not quite relevant to him.

Since ancient times finding wife must spend money. No matter how era changes, marriage is a business core content never changed. In 17th Century China, marrying wife expressed more naked than later eras, that is buying selling relationship.

Although Senate rule added millions of population. But generally looking, female didn't seem more than male. Society generally appropriate age female far lower than appropriate age male. "Body Price" of woman marrying naturally couldn't be low. Moreover marrying organizing family equivalent to a new enterprise opening. Need house. Need preparing minimum living products... These all cannot leave "Money" word.

How Senator Liu and Du Yibin find suitable females, he cannot manage also lazy to manage. But this expense is real. This money naturally cannot allocating from City Finance—Liu Xiang also can't take out. So finally this ball kicked to Finance and Tax Mouth. Finally Wudaokou slapped board [decided]. Requesting Senate agreement. Expensing from "General Office Special Expense."

"General Office Special Expense" as name implies, is mastered by General Office, budget item used for Senator various private activities and life service expenses. Source of expense is Senator Foundation income.

Using this money handling naturalized cadre marriage big matter. Not only can save normal financial expenditure. Can also act as buying people's heart. Also counted appeasing a batch of Senators advocating "Army Private Ownership"—Although cannot in personal name, good or bad also Senator name.

Wang Qiyi naturally wouldn't oppose. But specific how to pay, still need their Finance and Tax Bureau to manage.

"You tell Bureau Chief Ai. Specific budget sheet I read—Too rough. Must hit back redo." Wang Qiyi said. Most Senators didn't know how to do budget. Submitted budget items all lost to rough negligence. In Director Wang view this is very unacceptable.

"Rules although troublesome, also need to build step by step."
