# Chapter 2072 - Masters Assembled

"If we could seize the bronze figures, might we disrupt the enemy's dragon-vein energy?" Living-Bug Zhao mused. "Of course, such national treasures must be heavily guarded in transit. If Heroes Zhuo and Huang were still alive, we might have tried—alas..."

"Talk of fate and fortune is all smoke and mirrors; we shouldn't take it too seriously," Tribute Paper Lin cut in. "If destroying a single bronze figure could damage the pirates' luck, what would be the point of us at all?" He steered the conversation back on course: "Speaking of idle hands—Fourth Master has already made contact with Second Master, and there's news of the escaped guild-head Gao Lingxiang and his people. We're not without options. Let us focus on the matter at hand."

Hao Er then drew a presentation box from inside his robe and placed it in the center of the table.

Everyone present knew their purpose in coming to Guangzhou, so no one expressed curiosity about the box's contents. Liu Cheng, the junior member of the Chaotic Brush Liu household, rose and opened the case, extracting a sheaf of paper slips: Hao Er's counterfeit silver dollar notes. Everyone picked them up, pinching and examining them, passing them around. Since only the one-yuan and half-yuan denominations had been forged, the circuit was completed quickly.

Chaotic Brush Liu said in a low voice: "Bring the lamp!"

Liu Cheng answered and immediately lit an Australian oil lamp on the table, then adjusted the flame to low. The old lady held the silver-dollar note up to the light while Liu Cheng covered both her and the lamp with a black cloth.

No one found this strange. Since ancient times, forgers of paintings and calligraphy began with "micro-observation"—every stroke and brushmark on the original had to be noted before it could be imiated convincingly. This could only be achieved by viewing the work with backlighting.

Before a cup of tea's time had passed, the black cloth rustled and Liu Cheng quickly removed it. Chaotic Brush Liu closed her eyes briefly and said nothing. The others exchanged glances. Finally, Tribute Paper Lin spoke first:

"Since we have accepted this weighty commission and risked our lives to come here, let us dispense with pleasantries. I shall speak plainly: your paper, though stiffer than common paper, raw or sized xuan paper, or various decorative papers, still feels far less crisp to the touch than the Australian notes. It is heavier, yet when shaken it feels limp and weak—any expert would spot the difference at once. Moreover, it lacks the smooth whiteness; I fear it would fall apart if wetted."

"I suspect the raw material the pirates use is different from ours," Hao Er said, crestfallen. "I've tried every paper available on the market—common papers are all useless. This paper was made by buying the best Australian writing paper, re-pulping and re-forming it—and even so, it's only fifty or sixty percent similar."

"It must be something they make in secret," Tribute Paper Lin pondered. "Is there any way to bribe one of the naturalized craftsmen?"

"This paper is undoubtedly made in Lingao; the craftsmen won't be in Guangzhou. Setting aside whether we could bribe anyone, the round trip to Lingao alone takes more than a few days. I've heard Lingao is the pirates' lair, and scrutiny there is ten times stricter than in Guangzhou. Strangers like us going there to snoop would only be offering our heads to the Imperial Guard for merit."

"So that avenue is blocked."

"According to Stone Elder, the pirates make their paper mostly from wood pulp—not the rice straw and bark we customarily use here. That approach might be worth trying."

"Easy to say! Making pulp from wood—who knows how much labor and time it takes to turn wood into pulp? Even xuan paper, which uses only green sandalwood bark and rice straw, must be soaked, steamed, sun-dried, and pickled in lime—a winter's work just to prepare the raw materials. If we're using timber, it would take even longer."

The greatest difficulty in papermaking was pulping: transforming various plant fibers into white, cottony pulp was immensely labor- and material-intensive in an era without machinery or chemicals. Tribute Paper Lin had spent his life supplying paper to the imperial court; he had seen virtually every variety of paper in existence and could himself produce many types. Yet the Australians' paper remained an enigma.

To crack this secret, he had himself processed Australian writing paper back into pulp for recycled paper. His first impression was the extraordinary fineness of the pulp—far superior to any local paper. Second, there seemed to be some kind of powder mixed into it, though he could not identify what.

As he pondered this, Chaotic Brush Liu spoke up: "One can only tell real from fake by touching the paper. Even at a distance, this copy looks only thirty percent similar; up close, it's far too crude. In my view, your notes might pass a casual glance, but they can't withstand close inspection. First, the colors: the pirates' notes have varying shades—yours are uniform. Even where there's some variation, the boundaries are distinct, not the gradual deepening of the authentic notes. Second, the pirates' notes contain numerous secret marks; yours are blurred beyond recognition. We'll need Block-Carving King to examine them further." She produced a magnifying glass from Zizhen Studio and, using an Australian oil lamp for illumination, carefully identified each mark: "See here—beneath the ship, the waves conceal half a fish head. Here, in the seam of the ship's railing, is hidden a string of Arabic numerals: 1628. On the obverse of the one-yuan note, the border pattern contains the hidden characters 'Yuan Lao Yuan' (Elder Yuan)..."

Some of these secret marks Hao Er already knew; others he had not discovered. Listening to Chaotic Brush Liu enumerate them, he thought: *Truly, old ginger is the spiciest!* He wondered how much silver Master Wang had spent to summon these masters.

Block-Carving Wang continued: "Whether using woodblock or lithography, I fear we cannot reproduce such patterns. Stone Elder also consulted several Shanxi bank managers and disciples of Grand Secretary Xu. In their haste, they actually found a method—but this requires telling a story from an old case."

"Please enlighten me." Hao Er's spirits lifted at the mention of a new blockmaking technique.

"Shortly after the Ming Treasure Notes were first issued—each note worth hundreds or thousands of strings of cash, but costing only mulberry-hemp paper and printing ink to produce—a peasant from Jurong County named Yang Mantou, a dabbler like yourself, Hao Er, organized silversmiths from his village to carve tin plates with fine, intricate patterns. He had specialists in printing spirit-money and funerary goods handle the printing. The resulting Treasure Notes were virtually indistinguishable from the real thing! The case implicated and killed over ten thousand people: 'From Nanjing to Jurong, a distance of ninety-odd li, the gibbeted corpses could be seen one after another'..."

The moment the words "tin plate" were uttered, Hao Er's mind cleared. He slapped his thigh: "How did I never think of this!"

"What is it?"

"A single word has awakened the dreamer!" Hao Er explained how Master Craftsman Qian had carved wood blocks that failed due to the material. He himself had tried to think of alternative materials.

"We have expert ivory carvers here, and famous jade-workers too, all capable of engraving minuscule characters and patterns. But neither ivory nor jade comes in pieces large enough for printing blocks, and both are too smooth to hold ink. I racked my brains but could never solve it... How blind I was! Copper and tin movable type have existed for ages!"

Both copper and tin movable type had been used in the Ming dynasty, though Chinese movable-type technology still had significant drawbacks, and cost factors meant metal type never gained wide use. That Hao Er failed to think of it was quite understandable. As for engraving copper or tin plates—this remained a European specialty until the Qing dynasty, when even the Qianlong Emperor had to commission copper engravings from France through missionaries to commemorate his "Ten Complete Victories."

"For counterfeiting the Song notes, tracing and drawing may yet be within human capacity. But engraving copper or carving tin—I've never done it. I can only say I'll try. My engraving skills, with a magnifying glass, are passable. But the plate must be cast from copper or tin; that will have to fall to Pattern Li."

Pattern Li showed no hesitation: "You already mentioned this earlier. On the journey here, I discussed it with Fourth Master. All necessary supplies have been procured and will arrive shortly. My two apprentices have come along to assist, and Living-Bug Zhao can help you as well."

Living-Bug Zhao looked slightly embarrassed: "Before leaving the capital, I only knew I'd be handling silver money. I didn't expect to be drafted for block-carving work. It's not that I'm unwilling—my craft is mostly in silverware. Lead and tin objects are usually crude household items like cups and plates; I'm truly unfamiliar with them."

Block-Carving Wang said: "No matter. In the Yang Mantou case, silversmiths did the engraving too. I'm not familiar with it either. We two brothers will work shoulder to shoulder—it should be easier than dealing with silver coins."

Meng Guolu added: "Earlier, Chaotic Brush Liu mentioned that the counterfeit notes' color transitions are too abrupt. If we follow the old path, there's no solution. The ink on the Australian notes is clearly not ordinary water-based ink—that's one. The color gradations are distinct yet blended, seemingly eight or nine shades in transition, all of which must be individually formulated—that's two. Furthermore, there are multicolored threads mixed into the paper, apparently not dyed in..."

Tribute Paper Lin said: "My family once pulped the Song notes. These are colored cotton threads, seemingly grown in their original colors—washed but unfading. Where they're sourced, I don't know. We tried crushing colored bird feathers and mixing them into the pulp, but they fall out too easily..."

Hao Er was unconcerned about this: "As long as they don't fall off when we use them, it doesn't matter. We're not making real notes; overthinking is pointless."

Tribute Paper Lin had been puzzling over technique, but now realized he'd gone down a blind alley and laughed it off.
