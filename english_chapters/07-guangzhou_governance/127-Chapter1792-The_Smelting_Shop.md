# Chapter 1792 - The Smelting Shop

The smelting shop was actually just like the furnace rooms of the Qing Dynasty, and naturally, it had all the same corrupt practices. Things like "scissors eating silver", applying oil and wax, tampering with weights, artificially raising the color, and adding weight were commonplace. However, this was still within the range of tolerance for ordinary merchants and people. Besides, opening this kind of business wasn't easy. It involved money; without a high threshold and a hard background, one couldn't open it. One also needed strong appraisal skills. Things like lead-filled yuanbao (ingots) had a long history, and it was hard to identify them before breaking them open. In reality, sometimes one couldn't cut the yuanbao open, relying entirely on the smelting shop staff's eye.

There weren't many smelting shops in Guangzhou City. The one with the oldest reputation and the brightest signboard was "Jufeng Hao". This smelting shop was an authentic century-old brand. Back when the Portuguese came to do business, the cross silver coins they used for payment were said to have been assayed by this family's head. Not only did many large merchant houses in the city smelt their silver ingots here, but most of the treasury silver of the Guangdong Provincial Administration Commissioner also came from this house.

The shopfront of the smelting shop wasn't large. Before even entering the door, one could feel a heatwave hitting the face. Although the melting of gold and silver was done in the workshop behind the shopfront, the distance between the front and back rooms was short. It couldn't effectively isolate the heat.

The counter of the smelting shop was higher than that of ordinary shops, but not as high as a pawnshop where one had to raise their arms to reach it. Firstly, this was to let customers see the scene of cutting and melting silver inside, to avoid disputes. Secondly, it prevented robbers from leaping over the counter to snatch silver—so the shop hall didn't have tables and chairs for entertaining guests found in other large shops.

Presiding over the counter today was the son of Old Manager Shen, Manager Little Shen. His neck had been slightly crooked since he was young, and people gave him the nickname "Shen Gongbao". Don't look down on "Shen Gongbao" because of his young age; his eye for assaying was no less than his father's. For most silver, he only needed to take it in his hand and look at it to tell the approximate fineness, being right eight or nine times out of ten.

Manager Little Shen was busy at the counter. The business of the smelting shop was very busy. Silver got cut smaller and smaller during circulation, eventually becoming a pile of broken silver pieces with messy fineness and weight, which was very troublesome for both accounting and payment. So every once in a while, merchants everywhere would send the scattered broken silver they received to the shop to be cast into ingots. The various scattered broken silver received by the *yamen* also had to be recast into official ingots.

Seeing the Australian "official constables" arrive, "Shen Gongbao" hurried up to welcome them.

"...I didn't know the officers were coming to my humble shop. Is there anything my humble shop can do for you? This shop's smelting and assaying are particularly fair..."

Li Ziyu said there was no need to be polite. I came here to ask you to identify the origin of a silver ingot, and by the way, check how the fineness is. Saying this, he took out the silver ingot.

"Shen Gongbao" took it and felt there was a problem at first glance. Why? Because he didn't recognize the shop mark on this silver ingot.

According to the rules, any silver ingot coming out of a smelting shop would be cast with the shop's name and the silver's fineness. This was equivalent to a trademark and also a guarantee of credibility. But he had never heard of the shop mark cast on this ten-tael ingot.

There were not many smelting shops in society at that time. Needless to say, small places with little silver circulation didn't have them; only in large commercial ports and administrative centers were there smelting shops. For the entire Guangzhou Prefecture, only the prefectural city and Foshan Town had smelting shops, with no more than fifteen large and small peers. Even in the whole country, there weren't many smelting shops. So the shopkeepers and clerks of smelting shops could mostly tell where the silver ingot was cast by identifying the shop mark on it, knowing how the credibility of that shop mark was.

If it was a reputable shop mark, shops and common people were happy to use it when they saw it. If the reputation was average or the shop mark was very unfamiliar, receiving such a silver ingot would make them uneasy, and they would have to come to a smelting shop or money house, pawnshop, and such places to ask the clerks to appraise and assay it.

Since the shop mark was so important, there were lawless elements forging the shop mark stamps of famous smelting shops. Forging silver ingots had existed since ancient times. To maintain credit and facilitate peer identification, each shop mark had secret marks on the stamp pointing to hidden signs. Outsiders couldn't tell, but true peers knew at a glance.

The shop mark on the silver ingot was called "Sanjiang Mao". It was the first time Little Shen had seen it. As far as Guangzhou City was concerned, apart from silver ingots cast by large and small peers, foreign silver ingots were either from the two capitals (Beijing and Nanjing) or melted in large commercial ports like Suzhou, Hangzhou, Hankou, and Jiujiang. Basically, Manager Little Shen knew the shop marks of these silver ingots. Only this one he hadn't seen.

Unfamiliar shop marks often implied risks, so Manager Little Shen had to be cautious.

"My humble shop has never seen the shop mark on this silver ingot." Manager Little Shen said, "It shouldn't be cast by a local peer. Nor is it a common foreign shop mark locally. It's probably smelted by some new foreign peer."

"How is the fineness?"

"Shen Gongbao" scrutinized the silver ingot. The fineness marked on it was 935. This roughly matched his first impression: this silver was definitely not full purity. Putting it on the scale, the weight was exactly right without a fraction of error.

"Officer, judging by the look of this silver, the 935 assay doesn't have much of a problem." Manager Little Shen said, "However, I always feel there's something inappropriate. I wonder if you can allow my humble shop to clip open this silver ingot to examine it carefully?"

Li Ziyu had already obtained permission beforehand and agreed immediately.

Manager Little Shen took the silver ingot to the clipping shears. These shears were specifically used to cut open silver ingots. At that time, wherever silver came in and out, this object must exist. This was a pair of shears with very short blades and very long handles. The handle on one side was fixed to a wide and heavy wooden bench, and the other side could open and close. "Shen Gongbao" held the silver ingot with his left hand placing it on the shear blades, supported the shear handle with his right hand, aimed accurately, leaned his body, and sat his buttocks fiercely onto the shear handle. With a "clang", the silver ingot was broken into two halves.

Manager Little Shen picked up the silver ingot and examined it carefully. It wasn't lead-filled inside. Looking at the stubble again, there were also honeycomb-like faults, and the silver color looked roughly not bad either.

However, holding this ingot of silver in his hand, Manager Little Shen always felt somewhat "not quite right" (*m si gei to* in Cantonese). This was probably the intuition of their trade.

Now "Shen Gongbao" was in a dilemma. If he said "no problem", let alone if something happened and the government pursued it, he wouldn't be able to handle the consequences, just the reputation of "misjudging" would have a huge impact on his own shop's reputation.

But if he said "there is a problem", the other party would naturally ask what the problem was. He couldn't say it.

"Shen Gongbao" thought about it and could only call his father out to appraise it. He immediately called an apprentice and asked him to hurry and call the old manager back.

Manager Shen wasn't in the shop originally—he went out to visit customers. Hearing that silver had arrived in the shop that even his son dared not make a conclusion on, he hurried back. Seeing the Australian official constable in the shop, he inevitably had to deal with him perfunctorily. Only then did he go aside to hear his son talk about this matter.

Manager Shen took the already broken silver ingot, closed it up again to carefully look at the shop mark, and a strange expression appeared on his face. He looked at it for a long time before putting down the silver ingot and asking: "May I ask the officer, where did this silver ingot come from?"

Li Ziyu said: "This is stolen goods seized in an investigation, specially brought here to ask you to identify the origin and fineness." He saw the expressions of the Shen father and son and felt there might be a problem here, asking again, "What? Is the silver fake?"

"Whether it is real or fake, this old one dare not say yet." Manager Shen said, "But this 'Sanjiang Mao' shop mark, this old one actually knows its origin."

It turned out that "Sanjiang Mao" was also a smelting shop. The shopfront wasn't in the city, but in Foshan. Foshan was one of the "Four Great Towns of the World", with prosperous industry and commerce and a large population. Naturally, the circulation of silver and money was also very developed. Sanjiang Mao had this favorable climatic and geographical position, and business was done very well.

However, "Sanjiang Mao" suffered a big fire decades ago. Not only was the shop burned to the ground, but the shopkeeper and clerks in the shop also didn't escape with their lives. Even the shopkeeper's family members were said to have died in the fire. This shop was completely wiped off the face of the earth. Not a trace was left.

Since the shop was gone, the silver ingots bearing its shop mark naturally became fewer and fewer. Gradually, they completely disappeared from the market. However, the older generation, especially the common people around Foshan, still retained the memory of "Sanjiang Mao". Old Manager Shen naturally also remembered this matter and recognized the stamp of this shop mark.

"...The stamp is real. I can tell this." Manager Shen said, "But this silver ingot, isn't necessarily produced by Sanjiang Mao."

Silver is a metal extremely prone to oxidation. Although the ancients didn't understand the physical and chemical changes of metals, they knew the phenomenon that silver would turn black over time. Manager Shen said that the silver ingots with the Sanjiang Mao shop mark reappearing after decades meant either someone had stored these silver ingots back then and hadn't used them—this was possible, hoarding silver for decades or centuries wasn't a rare thing. But "old silver ingots" from years ago and the silver ingot Li Ziyu brought were completely different in silver color.

The second possibility, which was also the most likely, was that someone somehow obtained the original "Sanjiang Mao" stamp and cast a batch of silver ingots themselves.

"Is the fineness real or fake?" Li Ziyu noted down Manager Shen's words in his notebook.

Manager Shen didn't speak, picked up the silver ingot and looked at it carefully again, playing with it for a long time, before saying: "This is Zhuti Silver."

"What silver?" Li Ziyu didn't understand and asked a follow-up question.

"Zhuti Silver." Manager Shen said slowly, "It is said to be silver from the cave barbarians in the Yunnan-Guizhou area. It is said to have existed since the Han Dynasty, only it has never been abundant. In this dynasty... since the She-An Rebellion in the Ming State, the outflow of Zhuti Silver has been almost cut off. This old one also followed my late father to see a set of silver ornaments used by a cave barbarian Tusi noble."

"Manager Shen, is this Zhuti Silver... silver?"

"It's not the silver we have here." Manager Shen spoke very cautiously because jewelry made of Zhuti Silver also circulated in the market. It wouldn't be appropriate for him to rashly cut off other people's source of income with a sentence. "I only heard that the cave barbarians use several different ores mixed and smelted, but exactly what ores and how they are smelted, I don't know. Those are secret methods passed down by word of mouth for generations among those stream-cave local barbarians. As a mere sedentary merchant in Guangzhou Prefecture, I have neither the interest nor the ability to figure it out."
