# Chapter 2048 - Reunion

"I see... You need us to dispatch someone? No problem... Oh, the Police Bureau is sending personnel too. Director Wu, you're orchestrating quite a move here... Haha, alright, no problem. I'll ensure they arrive within fifteen minutes!" Although Wu Mu's voice on the phone maintained its customary stiff coldness, Wang Qiyi still detected a hint of excitement. It was comprehensible—this was someone who'd been "exiled" as an external official. Now with such an excellent opportunity to distinguish himself, heightened emotions were perfectly natural. Moreover, this fellow didn't hoard the achievement for himself—even at such a tense juncture, he hadn't forgotten to notify other departments to dispatch personnel. Mm, he appeared someone worth cultivating, Wang Qiyi reflected as he scribbled a note. His distaste for Yao Yulan also diminished somewhat.

"Everyone come in!" He called at the doorway, summoning them all inside. Time was critical—circumstances were pressing now, and Wang Qiyi dispensed with explanations. After briefly assigning the new task, he directed them immediately: "Second Team's Yao Yulan and Huang Ping, along with Team Leader Zeng, proceed to the assembly point immediately. Take this note—it specifies the meeting location. Go downstairs to requisition weapons and protective gear. Move swiftly—you must arrive within thirty minutes!"

"Yes! Service to the Executive Committee and the People!" The three naturalized cadres clicked their heels together in unison and responded.

"Alright, hurry along. Remain safe, and allow the police and Political Security to lead in dangerous situations—we're not the American IRS..." Wang Qiyi waved them off and called to his guard outside the door, "Little Hu, go downstairs and prepare a carriage. Accompany them—fully armed!"

After Yao Yulan and the others departed, Wang Qiyi addressed Xu Zhewei and Chu Xiaoran: "We'll suspend the Shi family line for now. Return the account books we retrieved from the Shi family's old establishment, and don't articulate anything else." Wang Qiyi paused to deliberate. "Also, ensure you encounter Young Master Shi—that Smith fellow—and inquire if he'd be interested in attending the next batch of taxpayer training sessions. I or Director Zhang will serve as lead instructor."

"Yes!"

After acknowledging the order, Chu Xiaoran asked somewhat hesitantly: "Is the bureau planning leniency toward the Shi family? If so, it would help us understand what latitude to employ in our investigation."

"Shame on you for scoring excellent on every tax training examination," Wang Qiyi laughed. "Investigation and disposition constitute two different matters. Investigation addresses only objective facts; disposition is where you calibrate latitude! The Shi family situation is somewhat complicated—it'll probably require reporting up to the city and ministry levels. There are more pressing matters presently, so we cannot attend to them. For now, organize the Shi family materials and execute as I instructed."

By the time Yao Yulan and the others reached the assembly point, the squad led by Lian Nishang from the Police Bureau's Public Order Section had also just arrived. The Political Security Bureau cadre waiting there verified everyone's credentials and notes wordlessly, then led them down a narrow path. Zeng Juan, from habit, attempted small talk: "Comrade, thanks for your hard work. May I inquire your name..." He'd barely commenced when he observed Yao Yulan press a finger to her lips in a silencing gesture, and he hastily swallowed the remainder of his sentence.

The group proceeded in this wordless silence. Fortunately, the destination wasn't distant. Before long, they spotted a tall, graceful female cadre positioned at a small alley's entrance. The Political Security cadre guiding them approached, stood at attention, and saluted. After the female cadre returned the salute, he pivoted and jogged into the alley. Throughout the exchange, neither uttered a word—leaving Huang Ping and Zeng Juan secretly amazed, wondering if everyone at Political Security was mute.

The female cadre stepped forward to shake hands separately with team leaders Lian Nishang and Yao Yulan before finally speaking: "I'm Yang Cao from Political Security Bureau. Over recent days, priority targets have been arriving at the courtyard behind us, including some connected to the current stamp tax case. Leadership has ordered immediate apprehension and expedited interrogation. Follow me."

With that, she pivoted and walked deeper into the alley, her sharp aura making Zeng Juan wince. In Yang Cao's assessment, this arrest operation was extraordinarily simple—Political Security could execute it entirely independently without assistance. But since Director Wu had arranged it thus and specifically emphasized cooperation, there must be rationale. Her duty was to execute flawlessly. Don't inquire what shouldn't be asked, don't contemplate what shouldn't be considered—that was the habit Yang Cao had cultivated throughout her Political Security tenure.

The riot squad from the Police Bureau was already positioned. Unlike regular police, they were equipped with full-body armor and helmets, though their weapons were predominantly "non-lethal"—mostly shield-and-baton teams coordinated with long-pronged forks, plus gunners armed with shotguns and Hall-pattern rifles for suppressive fire. In National Police operations, the riot squad handled not merely riot control but also portions of the SWAT team's responsibilities.

The riot squad leader was currently conferring with Yang Cao, while two members had the battering ram prepared. Behind them, a line of officers were ready to assault.

Huang Ping studied the small courtyard before him—an utterly ordinary Guangzhou residence, the variety commonly observed throughout the city. Yet its location was truly well-selected, concealed in the outer suburbs beyond the East Gate. The front two rows were entirely residential, with the city wall behind. Without a guide, this location would be nearly impossible to locate. Now he crouched beside Yao Yulan, his six-shot revolver already loaded. He could sense himself trembling slightly with excitement, and perspiration was beginning to bead on his skin.

The faint body fragrance emanating from Yao Yulan beside him made his thoughts wander. The previous time they'd been this proximate was during training in Lingao. Huang Ping's marksmanship with the revolver had been abysmal—a strapping young man who simply couldn't steady the small firearm. His team leader Yao Yulan had no alternative but to provide him extra practice at the range after instruction. Once, apparently driven to exasperation, she'd dispensed with propriety and embraced him from behind, gripping his wildly swinging arms and bellowing at him to hold steady. That time, Huang Ping genuinely did hold steady—and also committed to memory the soft, resilient sensation pressing against his back.

He stole another glance at Yao Yulan before him. She wasn't wearing "protective gear"—the Tax Bureau had borrowed several simplified riot suits from the Police Bureau, consisting of steel-reinforced rattan helmets, hardened leather chest protectors, and gloves. According to regulations, the Economic Major Cases Investigation Division could elect to wear them during field operations, but clearly Yao Yulan hadn't even considered them. Inspector Lian across the way had also brought only her revolver. Meanwhile here he was, a grown man—Huang Ping pushed at his helmet—feeling somewhat embarrassed before the women. But he rapidly relaxed: that fellow Zeng Juan possessed the complete kit—helmet, chest protector, gloves—and was posted at the alley entrance awaiting news. Wasn't that even more embarrassing?

"Report!" A shadow silently approached Yang Cao. "All the lookouts have been neutralized."

"What about the dogs in the courtyard?"

"Dealt with."

"Good. Move out!"

At her command, two riot squad officers coordinated their movements and rapidly scaled the wall. Moments later, the courtyard gate quietly opened from inside.

"We're advancing. Inspector Lian, have your personnel secure the side buildings." Yang Cao issued the low command, then led the group directly to the main hall.

Huang Ping rushed in alongside the riot squad. Once inside the courtyard, he observed two dead dogs lying in the yard—presumably dealt with beforehand.

Perhaps something outside had alerted those within. The main hall suddenly erupted in commotion—sounds of dragging and objects crashing. Someone was calling in a suppressed voice: "Hurry!"

"National Police! Everyone inside, listen carefully! You're surrounded. Resistance is futile... Leniency for confession, severity for resistance..." The Police Bureau was well-practiced in such procedures. Observing the door and windows barricaded, someone immediately commenced the "persuasion."

Naturally Yang Cao and her personnel possessed no patience for lengthy negotiations with those inside—the shouting was merely a distraction. The riot squad had already crept beneath the windows with pepper tear-gas grenades prepared, the breach team poised for action.

Yang Cao and Lian Nishang locked eyes, nodded three times in unison, then swept their hands simultaneously. Violent coughing erupted from within as the door was demolished by the battering ram. Donning their masks beforehand, the team poured in and efficiently subdued the occupants, who were already doubled over with tears and mucus streaming.

"Hands behind your heads! Face the wall! Squat! One at a time now." Lian Nishang was well-practiced in managing such situations. Confronted with the "short-hair" six-shot revolvers pointing at their heads, this group of criminals displayed no inclination toward martyrdom, obediently squatting on the ground. A few who were already squatting didn't dare stand back up, waddling like ducks as they shuffled toward the wall—drawing quiet laughter from some of the young officers.

"What are you doing! No moving!"

"Remain still!"

*Crack!*

"You damned short-hair—mmph mmph mmph..." Just as the smoke in the room was dissipating and Huang Ping and the others were removing their masks, a burly man who had been squatting obediently suddenly exploded into motion. In his estimation, there were only two female "short-hairs" behind him—with his strength, knocking them down should prove child's play. Then he'd seize their revolvers, and the situation might still be salvageable. But he'd barely moved when one of the female short-hairs locked his joint. Through sheer brute force he managed to persist, only to hear the whistle of a club—a heavy blow landed on his waist, sending him stumbling back to the ground. They beat him with seventeen or eighteen strokes until he was utterly prostrate. His hands were pinned behind his back, and a rag from god-knows-where was stuffed into his mouth, its stench shooting directly to his brain.

Yang Cao approached, slowly squatted before the man, grabbed his topknot, and lifted his head. Then she extracted a photograph from her pocket and began studying him carefully.

"You're the one..." Yang Cao released his topknot, stood up, dusted off her hands, and addressed the Political Security cadre beside her, "Watch him carefully—don't allow him to kill himself."

Huang Ping, guarding the doorway, heard Yang Cao speak and turned to observe what manner of person this man was—someone significant enough to make Political Security's roster. And why had that voice sounded so familiar?

But when his gaze fell upon the man's face, he froze completely.
