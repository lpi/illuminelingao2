# Chapter 1834 - Breaking and Entering

Others might have hesitated at those words, but Lian Nishang despised powerful households above all else and possessed a fiery temper. Had she not heard this, she might have let it pass—but hearing it, her face immediately darkened. She sneered: "So what if he was a guest of honor of the Chief?"

Li Ziyu saw her expression turning dangerous and quickly added: "Naturally, we must also act according to the law."

Lian Nishang immediately issued her order, dispatching someone to bring Yue Wan in for questioning. "If she can't be invited, then drag her here."

The others exchanged glances, clicking their tongues in secret, but bowed their heads and listened without a word.

Several police officers went and returned shortly to report that a servant woman had answered the door, saying Miss Yue Wan was "not in." When asked where she had gone—"don't know." As for whether there was a little girl named Mingnu or something in the courtyard—simply "no." They hadn't even been allowed inside.

These police officers were either retained yamen runners or newly recruited locals. For them, such an attitude from a gentry family was perfectly normal. They had always feared the local gentry, especially since the other party was not only the top gentry in Guangzhou but also on good terms with the Chiefs—a guest of honor of Proprietor Guo himself. They had already felt Lian Nishang was being "meddlesome." Now that the target was conveniently "not in," this canopy she had raised could naturally be taken down, and everyone was happy to avoid trouble.

Lian Nishang laughed. "What a coincidence. Just when we need to find someone, she happens not to be home." She picked up the brimless soft hat on the table, patted it, placed it on her head, and adjusted it properly. "Since she won't come to us, we'll go 'invite' her. Follow me!"

Hearing this, several police officers felt the words boded ill and worried secretly. As the saying went, "When immortals fight, mortals suffer." Lian Nishang was a "Chen person"—a mainlander—from Qiongzhou. If something went wrong, the Chiefs would naturally shield her. But they were all powerless commoners; they would inevitably be thrown out as scapegoats. Losing their rice bowls was a minor concern—they didn't want to end up in prison. They couldn't help but hesitate.

Li Ziyu hurriedly stepped forward. "This, Section Chief Lian—as the saying goes, lack of forbearance in small matters upsets great plans. Perhaps we should ask Chief Mu for instructions first regarding this matter..."

Lian Nishang didn't answer him. She turned to the police officers and announced: "Whoever is unwilling to go may stay here on duty. I will definitely not blame you. Those willing to go, follow me!"

The police officers exchanged uncertain glances. The meaning of her words was even more ominous. Going meant offending the powerful Liang family; refusing meant their jobs might not be secure in the future. Before the task was even done, they'd become rats trapped in a bellows—squeezed from both ends.

Li Ziyu saw that Lian Nishang was determined to go. His heart had initially counseled retreat, but then he remembered: he had come to Fangchun Court to find Mingnu, and now Mingnu was in Yue Wan's courtyard. How could he not go? He was about to step forward.

Unexpectedly, someone proved faster. Just as Li Ziyu moved, Zhao Gui had already spoken: "This... lowly one... I'll go with you."

Zhao Gui's reputation in the city bureau was that of a "fool." He could barely string sentences together normally, relying on Li Ziyu to muddle along in the Security Section. Yet he would be the first to stand forward! For a moment, the police couldn't tell whether he was hiding great wisdom or was simply stupid beyond all comprehension.

Lian Nishang probably was also somewhat surprised. She nodded. "Good, then come with me."

Seeing Ah Gui had taken the lead, Li Ziyu quickly declared: "I'll go too!"

Lian Nishang nodded. "You two follow me." Without another glance back, she descended the steps and ordered in the courtyard: "Corporal, bring a squad and follow me."

Leaving the courtyard, she ordered Huang Xiang brought along to lead the way.

The group made their way back along a narrow passage. Near the back courtyard, a side door opened into the passage. Through this side door lay a small courtyard paved with stone slabs. At its far end stood another gate: vermilion door leaves with brass ring beast-head knockers, exquisitely crafted.

Without waiting for Lian Nishang's order, Li Ziyu stepped forward, grasped the copper ring, and knocked. After a moment, the door opened a crack and a middle-aged servant woman emerged. Seeing the police again, she said impatiently: "You officers really are meddlesome! I already told you just now—the Miss is not at home! And there isn't any Mingnu or Darknu or whatever you're looking for..."

Since becoming a policeman, Li Ziyu had never encountered any commoner speaking to him so rudely. For a moment he couldn't react. While he stood stunned, the servant woman moved to close the door without waiting for his reply. He quickly stopped it and said: "Don't be in such a hurry! Listen clearly—it's our Section Chief who wants to see your Miss!"

The servant woman said impatiently: "What Section Chief or Short Chief—what does your clan head have to do with my Miss? My Miss is not at home; please ask him to come again another day!" With that, not waiting for Li Ziyu to respond, she slammed the door shut with a bang, nearly smashing his nose. The sound of a door bolt sliding followed from within—the door was now barred.

No matter how Li Ziyu knocked and shouted, there was no sound from inside. No one answered.

"No need to knock," Lian Nishang said. Li Ziyu returned dejectedly, saying bitterly: "I didn't expect this *majie* to be so brazen!"

Lian Nishang made no reply, only asking: "Does this courtyard have any other doors?"

"Yes, yes," Huang Xiang said quickly. "There's another door opening into the alley outside. From the alley, you can go directly to Music Workshop Street. That door is the main entrance. When Master Liang comes to the courtyard, he mostly enters from there."

"This courtyard is built strangely!" Lian Nishang observed. "The main gate is actually on this side!"

Huang Xiang explained: "Officer... Sir... Madam... You don't know—this courtyard was originally just a side courtyard for storing sundries. When Master Liang bought out Miss Yue Wan's contract, he found the noise from people constantly coming and going in the main courtyard disagreeable. So he spent money to completely renovate and rebuild this courtyard. The door was opened at that time for his convenience in entering and exiting. Including the rockery, flowers, plants, furniture, and furnishings in the courtyard, he spent more than ten thousand taels of silver in total."

Li Ziyu couldn't help but click his tongue silently. For a top *laoju* in a brothel of Fangchun Court's caliber, the cost of buying out the contract alone ran four or five thousand taels. Yet Master Liang had spent more than ten thousand just to arrange a residence for the girl! Such extravagance!

A so-called "descendant of a military family" with a "hereditary commission" like himself truly couldn't compare to even one of their toes! Amid his dejection, he also felt a faint stab of jealousy and resentment.

"Wealthy household indeed," Lian Nishang remarked mildly—but both Li Ziyu and Huang Xiang could taste the anger contained within those words.

Huang Xiang trembled. "Madam! Perhaps allow this lowly one to call at the door again? They're familiar with this lowly one..."

"No need," Lian Nishang said lightly. Then she raised her voice and called out: "Corporal!"

The National Army corporal responded and stepped forward: "Here!"

"Smash the door open for me!"

"Yes!" the corporal responded. The army differed from the local-born police; they had no scruples. Upon Lian Nishang's command, several soldiers immediately surged forward, smashing at the door with rifle butts. Banging sounds rang out, lacquer chips and wood splinters flying. Numerous pits were immediately gouged into the vermilion door leaves, revealing the wood grain beneath. However, these door leaves were made of top-quality timber, solid and thick, and barred from within. Seven or eight men smashing in turns made no impression—the door didn't budge.

Seeing rifle butts were ineffective, the corporal shouted a few words, and several soldiers immediately ran out. Li Ziyu was savoring the thrill of the scene when the soldiers returned carrying a battering ram. In groups of four, they lifted the ram and slammed it fiercely against the door.

"One... two... BAM—BAM—BAM—BAM—"

Accompanying the soldiers' rhythmic chant, the log with its metal-wrapped head crashed heavily against the door leaves. The heavy panels vibrated under the powerful impact. Dust fell from the door frame; wood chips scattered in all directions.

The heavy impact sounds struck everyone's heart, blow after blow.

Huang Xiang's mouth fell open. *Is this woman mad?!*

Li Ziyu, however, felt secret delight surging through him.

At that moment, a woman's clear, sharp shout came from inside: "Who is it?! Such presumption!"

Before her voice faded, the door bolt—already cracked under the battering—snapped with a crack. The two broken door leaves burst open. One, too severely damaged, struck the wall and immediately collapsed in pieces.

"Let's go in," Lian Nishang said, taking the lead toward the doorway.

Entering, they saw another small courtyard. The area was not large, but it had been arranged with exquisite elegance—superior even to Fangchun Court's main premises.

Seven or eight male and female servants had already gathered in the courtyard. Their leader was about twenty years old, wearing her hair in double buns, with a sapphire-blue sleeveless jacket and a water-red silk skirt below. A melon-seed face, long eyebrows, lively eyes betraying a hint of cleverness. Though her skin ran slightly dark, it couldn't hide her beautiful form and radiant appearance.

Lian Nishang recognized at a glance that this maid was the kind of "red person"—a favorite—who held power in a wealthy household, most likely having been "used" by the master or young master. Seeing the servants surrounding her, she knew this woman was probably a "butler"-type figure in the courtyard.

She heard the woman shout: "Which yamen are you officers from, daring to be so rude! This is the Liang family's outer residence—cease your rudeness!"

The maid was startled to see the leader was actually a female officer. Noting that Lian Nishang wasn't charging further in, she said again: "Which one is the leading officer? Please come forward and speak!"

Lian Nishang glanced at Li Ziyu, signaling him to speak. Li Ziyu paused, reading her expression, and suddenly understood—she disdained speaking to this person. He immediately stepped forward: "We are from the Guangzhou City Police Bureau Security Section, 'Clean Up the Sex Industry Working Group' personnel. Today we came to Fangchun Court specifically to inspect the implementation of regulations. During the inspection, we discovered Fangchun Court engaging in illegal activities including private purchasing of women, human trafficking, and forcing free people into prostitution. We are currently handling the case. Please cooperate!"

He had carefully considered these words, feeling they fully conformed to the various laws enacted by the Australians. Thus he spoke clearly and boldly. Even Lian Nishang nodded slightly in approval.

"This is the Liang Residence's outer household and has nothing to do with Fangchun Court. Retreat at once!" The maid remained unmoved, rejecting them crisply. "Master Liang is magnanimous and will surely not haggle over your reckless and arrogant behavior!"
