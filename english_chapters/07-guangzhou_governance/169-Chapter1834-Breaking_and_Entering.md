# Chapter 1834 - Breaking and Entering

Others might hesitate hearing these words, but Lian Nishang hated big households the most and had a fiery temper. Had she not heard this, it might have been okay, but hearing it, her face immediately sank. She sneered: "So what if he's a guest of honor of the Chief?"

Li Ziyu saw her expression wasn't right and quickly said: "Naturally, we must also act according to the law."

Lian Nishang immediately issued an order to send someone to bring Yuewan over for questioning. "If she can't be invited, then drag her here."

The others, seeing this, all clicked their tongues in secret, bowing their heads to listen to orders without a word.

Several police officers went, and returned after a short while to report that a servant woman inside answered the door, saying Miss Yuewan was "not in." Asked where she went, "don't know." As for whether there was a little girl named Mingnu or something in the courtyard, it was simply "no." They weren't even allowed into the courtyard.

These few police officers were either retained yamen runners or newly recruited. For them, this attitude from a gentry family was normal. These people had always feared the local gentry, especially since the other party was not only the top gentry in Guangzhou but also on good terms with the Chiefs, a guest of honor of Proprietor Guo. They originally felt Lian Nishang was "meddlesome." Now that the other party was "not in," this canopy supported by Officer Lian could naturally be taken down, and everyone was happy to save trouble.

Lian Nishang laughed: "That's a coincidence. Just when we need to find someone, they just happen to be not in." She picked up the brimless soft hat on the table, patted it, put it on her head, straightened it, and said: "Since she won't come, we'll go and 'invite' her. Follow me!"

Hearing this, several police officers felt the words were ominous, and all worried secretly. As the saying goes, "When immortals fight, mortals suffer." She, Lian Nishang, was a "Chen person" (mainlander/communist) from Qiongzhou. If something happened, the Chiefs would naturally shield her. But they were all powerless commoners; they would inevitable be thrown out as scapegoats. Losing their rice bowl was a small matter; they didn't want to end up in prison. They couldn't help but hesitate.

Li Ziyu hurriedly stepped forward: "This, Section Chief Lian, as the saying goes, lack of forbearance in small matters upsets great plans. Do you think we should ask Chief Mu for instructions first regarding this matter..."

Lian Nishang didn't answer. She turned to the police officers and said: "Whichever of you is unwilling to go, stay here on duty. I will definitely not blame you. Those willing to go, follow me!"

The police officers looked at each other. The meaning of these words was even more ominous. To go was to offend the big gentry Liang family; not to go, their job might not be so secure in the future. Before the task was even done, they had become rats in a bellows.

Li Ziyu saw that Lian Nishang was determined to go. He had originally beaten a retreat in his heart, but thinking that he came to Fangchun Court to find Mingnu, and now Mingnu was in Yuewan's courtyard, how could he not go? He was about to step out.

Unexpectedly, someone was faster than him. Just as Li Ziyu took a step, Zhao Gui had already spoken: "This, lowly one... I'll go with you."

Zhao Gui's impression in the city bureau was that of a "fool." He couldn't even speak complete sentences usually, relying on Li Ziyu to muddle along in the Security Section. Unexpectedly, he would be the first to stand out! For a moment, the police didn't know if he was hiding great wisdom or truly stupid beyond reach.

Lian Nishang was probably also a bit surprised. She nodded: "Good, then you come with me."

Seeing Ah Gui had taken the lead, Li Ziyu quickly said: "I'll go too!"

Lian Nishang nodded. "You two verify follow me." After speaking, she went down the steps without looking back and ordered in the courtyard: "Corporal, bring a squad and follow me."

Leaving the courtyard, she ordered Huang Xiang to be brought along to lead the way.

The group went all the way back along the narrow passage. Near the back courtyard, there was a side door in the passage. Opening the side door, inside was a small courtyard paved with stone slabs. In the courtyard was another gate, vermilion door leaves with brass ring beast heads, very exquisite.

Without waiting for Lian Nishang's order, Li Ziyu went up and grasped the copper ring to knock. After a short while, the door opened slightly, and a middle-aged servant woman came out. Seeing it was police again, she couldn't help but say impatiently: "You officer are really meddlesome! I already said just now, the Miss is not at home! And there isn't any Mingnu or Darknu you're looking for..."

Since Li Ziyu became a policeman, he hadn't seen any commoner speak to him so rudely. For a moment, he couldn't react. Stunned for a moment, seeing the servant woman about to close the door without waiting for his reply, he quickly stopped her and said: "Don't be in a hurry! Listen clearly, it's our Section Chief who wants to see your Miss!"

The servant woman said impatiently: "What Section Chief or Short Chief, what does your clan head have to do with my Miss? My Miss is not at home, please ask him to come again another day!" After saying that, without waiting for Li Ziyu to speak, she slammed the door shut with a bang, almost smashing Li Ziyu's nose. The sound of a door bolt sliding was heard from inside; it was already barred.

Now, no matter how Li Ziyu knocked and shouted, there was not a sound from inside; no one answered anymore.

Lian Nishang said: "No need to knock." Li Ziyu returned dejectedly, saying hatefully: "I didn't expect this *majie* (housemaid) to be so rampant!"

Lian Nishang didn't answer, only asking: "Does this courtyard have any other doors?"

"Yes, yes," Huang Xiang said quickly. "There is another door opening into the alley outside. From the alley, you can go directly to Music Workshop Street. That door is the main entrance. When Master Liang comes to the courtyard, he mostly comes from there."

"This courtyard is built strangely!" Lian Nishang said. "The main gate is actually built here!"

Huang Xiang said: "Officer... Sir... Madam... You don't know, this courtyard was originally just a side courtyard for storing sundries. When Master Liang *shoulong* Miss Yuewan, he disliked the noise of people coming and going in the courtyard, so he spent money to completely renovate and rebuild this courtyard. The door was also opened at that time, for his convenience in entering and exiting. Including the rockery, flowers and plants, furniture and furnishings in the courtyard, he spent more than ten thousand taels of silver in total."

Li Ziyu couldn't help but click his tongue secretly—for a top *laoju* in a brothel of Fangchun Court's level, just the cost of *shoulong* itself was four or five thousand taels. This Master Liang spent more than ten thousand just to arrange a residence for the girl! This extravagance!

A so-called "descendant of a military family" with a "hereditary future" like himself really couldn't compare to even a little toe on someone's foot! Amidst his dejection, he also felt a faint jealousy and hatred.

"Sure enough, a rich household." Lian Nishang's words were mild, but both Li Ziyu and Huang Xiang could taste the anger contained within.

Huang Xiang trembled: "Madam! How about allowing this lowly one to call the door again? They are familiar with this lowly one..."

Lian Nishang said lightly: "No need." Saving that, she raised her voice and ordered loudly: "Corporal!"

The National Army corporal responded and stepped forward: "Here!"

"Smash the door open for me!"

"Yes!" The corporal responded. The army was different from the local-born police; they had no scruples. Upon Lian Nishang's order, several people immediately surged up, first smashing the door with rifle butts. Only banging sounds were heard, lacquer chips and wood splinters flying. Many pits were immediately smashed into the vermilion door leaves, revealing the wood grain. However, these door leaves used top-quality timber, solid and thick, and were barred. Seven or eight people smashed in turns, but the door didn't move a bit.

Seeing rifle butts were ineffective, the corporal shouted a few words, and several soldiers immediately ran out. Li Ziyu was feeling the thrill of the scene when the soldiers already came in carrying a battering ram. In groups of four, they lifted the battering ram and slammed it fiercely against the door leaves.

"One... two... BAM—BAM—BAM—BAM—"

accompaniying the soldiers' chants, the round log with a metal-wrapped head crashed heavily against the door leaves. The heavy door panels vibrated under the powerful impact. Dust fell from the door frame, accompanied by wood chips falling from the door, scattering in all directions.

The heavy impact sounds struck everyone's heart one after another.

Huang Xiang opened his mouth wide. Is this woman crazy?!

Li Ziyu, however, felt a secret delight in his heart.

At this moment, a woman's crisp shout came from inside: "Who is it?! So presumptuous!"

Before her voice fell, the door bolt, already cracked under the impact, snapped with a crack. The two broken door leaves burst open. One leaf was damaged too severely; hitting the wall, it immediately fell to the ground in pieces.

"Let's go in."

Lian Nishang said, taking the lead towards the doorway.

Entering the door, they saw another small courtyard. The area was not large, but it was tidied exquisitely and elegantly, superior even to Fangchun Court.

Seven or eight male and female servants had already gathered in the courtyard. The leader was about twenty years old, wearing a double-bun hairstyle, a sapphire blue sleeveless jacket, and a water-red silk skirt below. A melon-seed face, long eyebrows, lively eyes revealing a bit of cleverness. Although her skin was slightly dark, it couldn't hide her beautiful form and radiant appearance.

Lian Nishang knew at a glance that this maid was the kind of "red person" (favorite) who held power in a big household, mostly likely having been "used" by the master or young master. Seeing the servants surrounding her, she knew this person was likely a "butler"-type figure in this courtyard.

She heard her shout: "Which yamen are you officers from, daring to be so rude! This is the Liang family's outer residence, cease this rudeness!"

The maid was startled to see the leader was actually a female officer. Seeing Lian Nishang not charging further in, she said again: "Which one is the leading officer, please come out and speak!"

Lian Nishang nodded at Li Ziyu, signaling him to speak. Li Ziyu paused, seeing Lian Nishang's expression, he suddenly understood she disdained speaking to the other party. He immediately stepped forward: "We are the Guangzhou City Police Bureau Security Section, 'Clean Up the Sex Industry Working Group' personnel. Today we came to Fangchun Court specifically to check the implementation of regulations. During the inspection, we found Fangchun Court engaged in illegal activities such as private buying of women, trafficking women, and forcing free people into prostitution. We are currently in the process of handling the case, please cooperate!"

He had considered these words, feeling they fully conformed to the various laws enacted by the Australians. Thus he spoke clearly and boldly. Even Lian Nishang nodded slightly.

"This is the Liang Residence's outer household, having nothing to do with Fangchun Court. Retreat quickly!" The maid was unmoved, rejecting them crisply, "Master Liang is magnanimous and will definitely not haggle over your reckless and arrogant act!"
