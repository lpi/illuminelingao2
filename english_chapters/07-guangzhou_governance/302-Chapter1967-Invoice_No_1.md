# Chapter 1967 - Invoice No. 1

Standing before the window marked "01" with Advisor Xu beside him, Steward Yan felt extremely uncomfortable. Although he was accustomed to serving others and groveling while looking up at people—that was towards his master. Now a young woman sat upright behind a high desk looking straight at him, and even while sitting on a stool he had to look up slightly; for a moment he forgot his words. Regardless of how beautiful this woman was or how gentle her smile, just this exchange of gazes made Steward Yan curse the Australians in his heart for having no sense of propriety.

However, Nan Wan'er behind the window didn't have so many thoughts. Today, Teacher Zhang Xiaoqi personally presided over the hall and assigned her, the "Director," to Window No. 1 just so the first transaction would go smoothly. After working hard for half a year, she couldn't let it fail in her hands. Seeing Yan Xiaomao and the other person silently standing there, she smiled and asked, "Are the two of you here to pay taxes? Did you bring your documents and forms?"

Hearing Nan Wan'er's words, Yan Xiaomao and the advisor seemed to wake up suddenly, hurriedly taking out a pile of papers and cards such as the registration certificate and assessment notice stored in their document box, and piling them all onto the counter. Nan Wan'er said "please wait a moment," collected them into the window, turned around, and began organizing and reviewing them on her desk.

The preparation of materials for this collection was actually quite simple. Through the hard work of the Tax Assessment Division and Management Division in the early stage, every taxpayer had received a tax payment notice marked with the tax amount payable for this period. Today they only needed to pay the money according to the amount on the slip. However, Zhang Xiaoqi believed that the cultivation of tax-paying habits should start from day one, so Nan Wan'er and her colleagues had an additional task: guiding taxpayers to fill out tax declaration forms. Pre-training had been conducted during the Management Division's early visits, but because most of the Management Division staff were newcomers with average professional quality, the final work was temporarily carried out by window staff.

Seeing Nan Wan'er turn back around, Steward Yan quickly withdrew his gaze and sat up straight. He saw an extra page of document in her hand.

"I've checked the documents and notices you brought, and there are no problems. However, before paying tax, you need to fill this out first. There is a pen and a 'filling sample' on the desk. You can ask me about anything unclear."

"Understood, understood. Comrade Huang who came to my house before already mentioned it." Steward Yan took the declaration form and the returned materials while using Newspeak to express his unusual relationship with the Australians.

Unfolding the declaration form, it had a pre-printed format, and the blank spaces were presumably the parts needing to be filled. At the very top center, five large characters in bold Song typeface read "Tax Declaration Form," with six smaller characters in parentheses below: "For General Declaration."

Steward Yan didn't quite understand it but felt that since they were small characters, they were probably just some explanations. Looking further down was a large table with many rows and columns nested inside. The first was Taxpayer ID Number, which he knew; when Huang Ping did pre-training at Gao Ju's place, he had listened in—it was the Arabic numerals on the registration certificate. Below that was Taxpayer Name, which was also easy. Further down were Levy Item (*), Levy Product (*), Tax Period Start (End), Tax Payment Deadline, Declaration Deadline, Payment Deadline, Taxable Amount, Tax Rate, Tax Payable, Tax Paid...

Looking at the rows of items, Steward Yan couldn't help but sigh in his heart that the Australians were indeed meticulously detailed. The things to be filled in these boxes covered everything and were interlinked; any mistake or falsification would be obvious at a glance, unlike in the past where just a number would suffice.

He turned his head to look at Advisor Xu beside him, only to see him staring at the blank space at the bottom, where this sentence was written: "Taxpayer or Agent Declaration: This tax declaration form is filled out in accordance with the national tax laws and regulations of the Great Song. I confirm that it is true, reliable, and complete." Next to it was the place for signature and seal.

This, this, this... Steward Yan and Advisor Xu discussed it but still couldn't quite understand what this sentence meant. Reading it, there was nothing inappropriate; it simply meant not falsifying or omitting information, which was also expected. Speaking of similar things, it was somewhat like the 'voluntary bond' he had handled: when tenant farmers or tenants owed rent and couldn't pay, they would write a document. Although the wording was different, the general meaning was similar: if unable to do such-and-such by the deadline, willing to accept such-and-such punishment.

Thinking that he had to write a voluntary bond on this document on behalf of his master, and also sign and seal it, gave him a creepy feeling of being inferior.

"This... Mi... Com... Comrade, this humble one has a matter." Steward Yan still couldn't quite adapt to this way of looking up and talking to a young woman.

"Just say it, is there something you don't understand?" Nan Wan'er was quite natural and poised.

"Everything else is on the notice, only here—" Steward Yan pointed to the final declaration and signature area. "These are all new Australian words; this humble one doesn't quite understand."

"You are taxpayers, and we are not the Usurper Ming's lordly officials. You can just address each other as 'you' and 'I'." Nan Wan'er broke into a radiant smile. Steward Yan was okay, but Advisor Xu behind him already went half limp.

"This paragraph indicates that the declaration form you filled out has no omissions or deceptions, with no other meanings. Presumably, Master Gao shouldn't have any either."

"How could there be, how could there be. Of course there isn't. Advisor Xu, I'll have to trouble you." Steward Yan hurriedly responded, pulling Advisor Xu onto the stool to start filling out the declaration form copying the "filling sample" pasted on the desk.

"There is one more thing to notify you two," seeing Steward Yan unoccupied, Nan Wan'er said to him. "According to Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau regulations, you belong to a unit taxpayer, so tax declaration and payment must be done by a fixed person. Next time remember to report the name for registration. We will conduct declaration training for him. After a while, specific payment notices won't be issued for each payment; instead, you will declare it yourselves."

What? Declare ourselves? Steward Yan was stunned. Did the Australians trust his family that much? Under heaven, wasn't royal grain and national tax always whatever the government said to pay? Since when was there a logic of paying whatever you said you'd pay?

Seeing him silent, Nan Wan'er guessed his thoughts and continued: "You must declare truthfully according to your own income. We will also train you on how to calculate tax. Don't think about other things; we have specialized inspection personnel to check. We must tax according to law and also pay tax according to law."

"Understood, understood." Steward Yan didn't understand other things, but he understood the words "according to law" perfectly. Since the opening of Guangzhou, whenever the Australians mentioned "according to law," what followed was either demolishing houses and breaking roads or killing people and hanging them on swings. They were ruthless whether dealing with refugees, beggars, or gentry and big households. Master Gao couldn't be the chicken killed to scare the monkeys.

Seeing Advisor Xu finish filling the declaration form based on the notice, Nan Wan'er took it over for checking. At this time, the hall was bustling with noise. Originally considering the low proficiency of personnel, for stability, Ai Zhixin didn't let the Management Division notify too many taxpayers on the first day. Moreover, even notified ones were big households with specialized accountants who understood rules and had more contact with the Australian Song. Unexpectedly, even so, a congestion of people still occurred at the beginning.

Zhang Xiaoqi had already opened emergency windows and temporarily canceled all "individual taxpayer" windows. Background accounting personnel were temporarily adjusted to the front desk to do miscellaneous tasks like stamping and answering policy questions. She herself also took the field personally, patrolling behind the counters. Whenever she saw a single link at any window taking too long, she would immediately go over to help solve it, finally stabilizing the situation. Seeing Zhang Xiaoqi accurately state almost all information like taxpayer name, tax category, tax item, and tax amount just by glancing at the registration certificate at every window, Ai Zhixin, inspecting the hall, couldn't help but be somewhat surprised.

"My wife is amazing, right?" Wang Qiyi was very triumphant. "In their hall with over 3000 households, let alone these basic things, she could even remember most of the license plates under each household's name. You can't compare people."

"That's true, Sister-in-law's professional skill is beyond words—truly a treasure of our Finance and Tax Bureau." Now whenever anyone mentioned Zhang Xiaoqi, Ai Zhixin would praise her like a flower. In various meetings, Director Ai always said, "I'm not blowing my own horn, but what's good about our Finance and Tax Bureau? The good thing is having a united team, everyone solidly wanting to improve tax and finance work. Unity, unity is our magic weapon for doing a good job in Guangzhou and Guangdong finance and tax work." This high-profile praise made Wang Qiyi very unaccustomed; not only unaccustomed, he was also somewhat worried.

The noisy crowd didn't affect Steward Yan and Advisor Xu in the slightest. After Nan Wan'er verified the declaration form was error-free and indicated tax could be paid, they handed over a filled-out Delong check. A burst of banging sounds came from the window, and soon a paper about the size of a card was handed out. One look showed it was written with Australian "carbon paper," stamped with the seal of "Great Song Senate Guangzhou Special Municipality Finance and Tax Bureau Directly Subordinate Collection Hall" in the lower right corner (*).

"This is the tax payment certificate. Please check it. If there are no problems, this tax payment is considered complete. Also, please take this registration certificate to Windows 17 and 18 to exchange for the new version of the tax registration certificate."

Putting away the slip, the two thanked her and squeezed through the crowd to Window 17. Seeing no one queuing here, Steward Yan couldn't help breathing a long sigh of relief—the taste of queuing was truly unpleasant.

The exchange of the registration certificate appeared very simple. After the female cadre in the window took his original registration certificate, she said nothing more and let him sit on the stool to wait. Steward Yan, having nothing to do, stood up to look into the window. He saw the woman with a pile of stamps big and small at hand, occasionally picking one out to stamp on a stiff, substantial paper already pre-printed. The paper was bright red, written with "Tax Registration Certificate." Unlike the previous window, the stamps here were all square. These Australians were truly strange; they liked stamping everything, even dialing Arabic numerals on a stamp before stamping. Was it just to write a few fewer characters?
