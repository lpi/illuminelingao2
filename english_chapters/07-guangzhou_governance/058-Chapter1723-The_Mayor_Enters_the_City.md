# Chapter 1723: The Mayor Enters the City

With those words, his head tilted and he breathed his last.

Wu Guangzhi was shocked. He had no roots here, and even less influence in the military. He maintained everything with silver. So he had always worried about unstable morale and spared no expense in lavishing silver. Unexpectedly, they still fell into chaos.

He knew this must have been instigated by the gentry. These shameless people who would sell out their monarch and father for their own lives and property!

Since the soldiers had mutinied, the city could no longer be defended. However, he put aside the idea of suicide and decided to die on the battlefield to repay the Emperor's grace. He drew his Japanese saber and shouted: "Everyone, follow me! Today is the day to serve the country with loyalty!"

The few trusted family servants beside him had all followed him from Shaanxi. At this moment, they all drew their sabers and charged out after him.

The defending militiamen and soldiers all rushed towards the county yamen. The small squad of officers and soldiers originally guarding him outside the county yamen collapsed without a fight. Only a few family servants resisted, and in an instant they were killed, their bodies falling at the steps of the main hall.

Wu Guangzhi, leading a few family servants, hadn't even left the second hall when he engaged in close combat with the mutineers. Although he was a scholar, his swordsmanship was very good, and he had accumulated a lot of combat experience in Shaanxi. Without panic, one slash cut down a soldier, and he smoothly stabbed into the belly of another militiaman. The surging mutineers, seeing how brave he was, didn't dare to come forward. Instead, they were pushed back down the steps.

However, the mutineers were numerous, and soon they surrounded the master and servants. In an instant, all his family servants were dead or wounded. Wu Guangzhi had already suffered several wounds and was covered in blood. He refused to surrender and had no intention of suicide, but continued to fight his way through. At this moment, several mutineers thrust at him with long spears. He was stabbed several more times, and blood flowed profusely. Knowing he was done for, he used his saber to support himself on the ground, knelt facing north, and gasped in a hoarse voice: "Your Majesty, your servant is dying for you in loyalty..." Before he could finish his words, he was stabbed through the back of the heart by a spear and fell over, dying in a pool of blood.

An hour later, Shi Zhiqi received a report from a messenger: Xin'an had been taken.

"...The magistrate has been killed."

The reason for mentioning this specifically was that according to the "Guangdong Occupation Guidelines," all local officials of the Great Ming who were captured, whether they surrendered or were captured, were to be registered and sent with their families and servants to Hong Kong for concentrated detention. The Military Control Commission required that local officials be seen alive or their bodies found dead; those whose whereabouts were unknown were also to be registered and reported.

"Did our people have any casualties?"

"Report, Chief, none!"

"Well done!" Shi Zhiqi said, drawing a blue circle representing "Occupied" on the map over Xin'an County.

Looking at the progress on the map, less than 12 hours had passed since the operation began. Wherever the Fubo Army went, they encountered almost no resistance. The few sporadic resistances were completely unorganized. Most were just a few people fighting spontaneously. The only organized resistance was in Xin'an County. It seemed that pacifying the region by proclamation was basically a foregone conclusion!

For the scholars and commoners of Guangzhou and the neighboring counties, this was an unforgettable day. The Australians came from the sea, silently and without bloodshed, seizing the largest city in southern China. By the time the sky was fully bright, the city gates had already been replaced with "Hair-shorn soldiers" wearing blue-gray short uniforms and holding muskets. On the streets, squads of Hair-shorn soldiers in gray uniforms patrolled. The entire city was quiet and orderly, and many shops had opened their doors. The commoners were both shocked and fascinated: just like that, overnight, Guangzhou had changed masters!

Fortunately, the new masters were not strangers. In recent years, the Australians had been a semi-public presence in Guangzhou. Even those with no business or labor dealings with the Australians had at least bought Australian goods: various kinds of "Australian paper," "Australian matches," "Australian cloth," "Hair-shorn socks"... These small things had long entered the daily lives of the commoners.

In the past, they were merchants traveling with swords. Now, they had openly become the rulers here. No one knew how the Australians would rule this great city.

Rumors about the Australians' governance in Lingao had spread here to some extent. Many people didn't believe them, thinking they were just tales from overseas. There were also those who knew the exact situation and wanted to see if the Australians' methods could be applied in Guangzhou: after all, the population of a single street in Guangzhou exceeded that of the entire Lingao County.

Just as Liu Xiang had said in his speech to the Northward Expedition team members before entering Guangzhou, this was a "major examination" for the Senate. Before this, they had only governed some semi-agricultural small county towns. Even Qiongzhou, the prefectural capital, was a negligible small city by mainland standards. Guangzhou was not only the largest city in Lingnan but also the first and foremost great and famous city in China in this time-space. Lin Baiguang estimated that the resident population here was at least 500,000.

Governing a city of 500,000 people was not an easy task even in the 21st century. If before they were painting on a blank canvas, now they had to repaint on a canvas already smeared with a kaleidoscope of strange and colorful colors, erasing the flaws while not destroying the exquisite parts. The difficulty could be imagined.

These difficult problems were now circling in the mind of Liu Xiang, who was riding a sedan chair into the city.

He had originally wanted to ride a service carriage into the city to display the majesty of the Senate. For this purpose, a Red Flag carriage had already been shipped to Wuyang Post Station. However, Lin Baiguang said that carriages couldn't travel in the city. Apart from a few main streets, general streets were very narrow, making carriage passage difficult. Not only that, but the bridges in the city were not designed for vehicle passage at all. They were all steep arch bridges with densely packed steps. In the past, Guangzhou Station had tried to promote rickshaws in Guangzhou City, but it was ultimately dropped due to the bridge problem.

Although Liu Xiang didn't mind walking into the city, his subordinates all opposed it: first, it was not conducive to protection; second, for the dignified Guangzhou Military Control Commission Chairman and Guangzhou Mayor to walk into the city would diminish the prestige of the Senate.

Given this reason, the small two-man sedans at the sedan shops near the Great South Gate wouldn't do. Fortunately, there was a ready-made official sedan at Wuyang Post Station. The Postmaster, who had formally surrendered, hurriedly tidied it up and called four sedan bearers to carry the sedan. Eager to please, he found all the various supernatural beings and monsters who lived scattered in the post station outside the Great South Gate.

"Quick! Go clear the way for the Australian master!"

When Liu Xiang came out, the full ceremonial arrangement was already in place. The clearing gong, the "Silence" and "Make Way" signs, various flags and ritual implements were all complete and imposing. All kinds of personnel were dressed in official attire, waiting below.

Seeing him come out, the Postmaster ran all the way to him and knelt down, saying: "Your Excellency! The ceremonial procession has been arranged. Please mount the sedan!"

Liu Xiang didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The ceremonial pomp of feudal officials was really impressive. He then instructed: "There's no need for so many people. Just prepare one sedan..."

The Postmaster, who had been obedient since the surrender, was very insistent on this point: "Your Excellency's words are wrong. The Great Song has recovered Guangzhou, and Your Excellency is an Imperial Envoy. It is absolutely unacceptable to conduct yourself too simply. Otherwise, it will make the scholars and commoners disrespect the Great Song. In my humble opinion, this ceremonial display is still too small to manifest the majesty of our Great Song."

Liu Xiang saw that the naturalized citizen cadres and soldiers around him also showed expressions of agreement. He couldn't help but feel emotional. He said: "These elaborate ceremonial items and flags are all based on the ritual system of the Zhu Ming. How can I use them?"

This was reasonable. The Postmaster thought about it and said: "Since that is so, the clearing procession should still be used. Otherwise, it would be bad if the commoners unknowingly offend the procession."

Liu Xiang couldn't refuse further. So he "mounted the sedan" and set off. The gong striker didn't know what rank Liu Xiang was as a Great Song official and didn't dare to strike randomly. He asked a naturalized citizen cadre: "What rank is Master Liu?"

The naturalized citizen cadre said: "Chief Liu is a Senator, extremely noble. What rank could there be?"

The gong striker thought to himself that this was "above all ranks." Generally, that meant a duke or marquis level figure. Anyway, more courtesy was never wrong, so he struck the gong thirteen times.

Amid the gong sounds of "All officials, military, civilian, and others, make way," Liu Xiang's entourage marched majestically towards the city. Behind the clearing gong and the "Silence and Make Way" signs, the Morning Star Flag fluttered in the wind. Thirty guards carrying rifles with fixed bayonets, and in the center, an eight-man sedan, with someone behind the sedan holding up his Senator Eagle Flag. Following the flag were more than ten naturalized citizen cadres. At the end were another twenty fully armed guard soldiers.

Liu Xiang's destination was the Guangzhou Prefecture Yamen. This was the office he was most concerned about. For him as Guangzhou Mayor, the Guangzhou Prefecture and the shelf archives and veteran clerks of the two subordinate counties of Panyu and Nanhai had immeasurable value. Much basic information had to be obtained from these. So when formulating the occupation plan, he specifically requested that the National Army entering Guangzhou should first occupy these places.

Liu Xiang's procession slowly passed through the main streets and alleys. For a time, spectators were packed like a wall—the Guangzhou citizens, who had recovered from the shock of the city's fall in the morning, already knew that the "Guangzhou Prefect" of the Australians was coming. Everyone wanted to see the demeanor of this new "Prefect Lord." The National Army had to be deployed along the route to maintain order. Even the runners from the yamens of one prefecture and two counties in Guangzhou came to offer their attentive services, rushing to clear the way and shout. For a time, the splendor was endless.

Liu Xiang sat upright in the sedan, watching this scene, his heart full of various emotions. As they say, a great man should live like this, probably meaning this. He was a PhD student who had been kneaded and exploited by his advisor, and now he had become a local grandee sitting in the seat of a high official. How could commoners experience such feelings...

Amid the monotonous gong sounds, he arrived at the Guangzhou Prefecture Yamen. He dismounted from the sedan in front of the screen wall. Liu Xiang got off the sedan and stomped his slightly numb legs. In front of him, the screen wall was concave in shape, five meters high and more than twenty meters wide, made of gray bricks. The bricks bore the inscriptions "Guangzhou Prefectural City" and "Guangzhou Prefecture." Looking at the Great Eight Characters Wall in front of the gate opposite, the gray brick walls on both sides each had four stone tablets inlaid. The inscriptions were unknown.

Even before entering the yamen, just this entrance already felt imposing.
