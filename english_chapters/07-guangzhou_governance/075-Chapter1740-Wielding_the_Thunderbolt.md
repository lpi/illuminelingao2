# Chapter 1740: Wielding the Thunderbolt

"Each team only needs to manage your own matters. Leave other matters to the specially assigned persons." Xie Buliao said, "If you encounter violent confrontation, blow the whistle to call nearby National Army for reinforcement."

"Start the operation!"

With Lin Baiguang's order, a guard beside him lit the signal rocket in his hand. A green signal flare soared into the sky with a whistling sound.

The whistle sound was the signal. Whistle sounds came from the entire street. The riot squad of the National Army entered Chengxuan Street from both the north and south entrances simultaneously. Neat footsteps sounded on the street that had become deathly quiet. The riot squad wore steel helmets, local version anti-riot suits made of kapok and rattan according to the anti-riot suit style, and iron-soled ox-hide short boots on their feet. Holding anti-riot rattan shields, standard police batons, and long forks, they walked in lockstep past the common people with eyes looking straight ahead and expressionless faces. The clattering sound of boots added a sense of terror to the hearts of the shopkeepers and assistants who were already uneasy. Many people began to secretly regret why they hadn't demolished it themselves.

The riot squad left a small team every one hundred meters, making arrangements along the street. Subsequently, under the second whistle sound, the Detective Brigade entered the street led by naturalized citizen police. Although they were dressed neatly, their marching formation was far worse. The demolition teams were not in a hurry to start, also arranging one team every one hundred meters. Each team wore armbands of different colors and numbers.

Each team had a flag bearer holding a colored flag of the team. Whenever a team arrived at its position, the flag bearer raised the flag in the air to indicate arrival.

The merchants and assistants in the shops, as well as the idlers watching the excitement, had never seen such a battle array. All of them were terrified—was this going to be a war?

Lin Baiguang sat upright in the chair. The guard put down the binoculars, turned back, stood at attention and saluted: "Report to Chief, all teams are in position."

"Let's start."

A red signal rocket soared whistling from the Double Gate Tower. The Detective Brigade, who had been rubbing their fists and palms, pounced like hounds let off the leash, roaring.

How had the shopkeepers and assistants ever seen such a battle array? Seeing the wolf-like and tiger-like Detective Brigade pouncing, the merchants and assistants who originally planned to obstruct in various ways immediately scattered like birds and beasts. The timid ones simply collapsed on the ground with a cry, unable to move, and were dragged aside by specially assigned persons long ago.

The Detective Brigade had long been eager to try. Everyone wanted to perform well in front of the Chief. Once the order was issued, they immediately started working according to the division of labor beforehand, each performing their own duties. For a time, moving things, demolishing walls with big sledgehammers and hook-sickle spears, climbing ladders to remove tiles... it was a chaotic and noisy scene.

Accompanying the demolition work, at both ends of the street, the pre-recorded "Demolition Notice" began to be broadcast using portable audio systems dedicated to square dancing.

"Citizens of Guangzhou, hello. The Guangzhou Military Control Commission and the Guangzhou Municipal Government, in accordance with..."

The monotonous electronic female voice echoed in the sky above the street. After the standard Mandarin with perfect pronunciation, there was a broadcast in Guangzhou Mandarin. Accompanying the broadcast, the Detective Brigade's demolition work also entered a climax.

According to the arrangement beforehand, bricks, tiles, and stones were collected, and reed mats, bamboo poles, and timber were also piled up by category. The Gale and Purple Lightning handcarts borrowed by Lin Baiguang from the Joint Logistics Headquarters collected on the move from the north of the street to the south. The demolished building materials were loaded and transported as soon as they were demolished. There was unexpectedly no accumulation on the street surface at all.

The tools and goods inside the sheds were also sealed one by one and transported away by cart, all transported to the East Parade Ground outside the city together with the building materials. This was not because Lin Baiguang wanted to covet these things, but to give the shops that built the sheds extra costs.

Guangzhou's commerce was what the Senate wanted to maintain and promote. Therefore, he could not use too drastic punishment methods, such as arresting the boss for labor reform, suspending business, etc. However, he couldn't let the shops have no cost for violation—for most shops, the material and labor costs of building sheds were not large, but the income was very considerable. Without effective deterrence, it was difficult to maintain the rectification effect for a long time. Detaining goods and tools to force them to pay fines. The time, property, and turnover costs generated during the period were enough to make many people dare not try again next time.

On-the-spot fines were naturally possible, but it was difficult to achieve effective control in the chaos. Now dragging everything to the East Parade Ground outside the city, each shop would inevitably take the initiative to accept punishment, which would neither miss nor fine too much. Adapting to their currently still very low law enforcement ability.

Lin Baiguang watched the street in front of him silently. The dust raised by the demolition of illegal structures shrouded the entire street, making it look misty. In the dust and fog, the sound of tools hitting walls, the tearing sound of reed mat sheds being pulled down, the shouting and scolding of demolition personnel. Occasionally, one or two sounds of women crying and shouting abuses were also mixed in.

Overall, the effect was good. Lin Baiguang thought to himself, it seems that the city foxes and social rats in the city, especially the Guan Di Temple people, are all very sensible, and none leaped out to serve as the chicken for him.

He knew that tomorrow the news of his demolition would spread throughout the city. Every tea house and tea shed would vividly tell what they saw today—he put on this battle array to get this effect. He had roughly looked at the situation of the whole city. It could be said that there were illegal structures almost everywhere on the main roads and commercial areas of the whole city. Some were simply built directly on the Six Veins Canal—the demolition work in the city had just begun.

It was impossible for the Guangzhou Municipal Government to put on such a big battle array every time it demolished illegal structures, so the first time had to have sufficient momentum and a big enough scene. he regretted a little that no one came out to make trouble; otherwise, he could have killed a few chickens properly, which would have a better warning effect on the subsequent demolition work.

The demolition work started at seven in the morning. By noon, the crowded sheds on the entire Chengxuan Street had been swept away, revealing the original wide road surface of blue bricks and red sandstone slabs. He looked over at a glance and suddenly felt carefree, feeling that the city could also breathe normally.

It was just that the traces left by years of road occupation business were still there. Like a floor plan drawn with stains. Standing on the Double Gate Tower, one could roughly still see the size of the road surface occupied by each shop initially. A few families simply built houses directly on the road surface. Now the wall foundations were still being demolished, and a few beams and pillars stood lonely in the center of the road.

The road ditches originally covered by sheds were now completely exposed. He instructed not to remove the stone slabs and wooden boards covering them for the time being—wait until after the entry ceremony.

"Good roads, ruined like this." Lin Baiguang said casually, "Have the things been transported away?"

"The detained goods and tools have all been transported away. There is still a small amount of building materials not demolished." The cadre responsible for specific command reported.

"After cleaning up, tell the cleaning team to sweep the street once. Ensure no residual garbage on the ground." Lin Baiguang picked up the binoculars, "Anyone making trouble?"

"No, very cooperative."

"Tell the law enforcement team to erect the gallows in front of the Double Gate Tower. Finally have a place to put them."

That afternoon, black gallows were erected on the open space in front of the Double Gate Tower. The rope loops coated with black tar swayed in the wind, silently reminding who was the master in Guangzhou City.

A new notice was pasted on the bulletin board in front of the gallows, stating that all shop numbers whose goods and tools were detained must go to the East Parade Ground to accept fine processing within three days, and overdue items would be confiscated entirely.

"Hair-thief, I F*** your old mother..." A shopkeeper couldn't help cursing in the back cabinet. If he didn't pay the fine, the detained goods and tools would be all gone, but he was really unwilling to take out the shining silver. His heart felt pain, regret, and hatred. His wife persuaded: "Husband, if we spend some money, we can still get the things back. If it were the former government, not only would you not get the things back, but you would still have to spend silver."

The shopkeeper thought about it and it was indeed so. Not to mention anything else, if the former government came to demolish, and he didn't give enough silver on the spot, that gang of black-hearted runners would probably have robbed his shop clean by taking the opportunity—in this way, the hair-thieves were considered quite polite.

Lin Baiguang had no mind to care about what the citizens thought. As soon as the sheds were demolished, he immediately organized teams to carry out temporary repairs on the road surface of Chengxuan Street.

Major repairs were impossible at the moment. This road was not only long but also hadn't been repaired for many years, and the road surface and roadbed were seriously damaged. Major repairs would require uncovering all the covering sandstone slabs and blue bricks, which couldn't be completed without a few months of effort, let alone not knowing where the road paving materials were. So Li Xiaolü, who came to be responsible for presiding over Guangzhou municipal engineering, suggested using the bricks, tiles, and stones obtained from demolishing sheds for temporary repairs first. Fill the potholes and gaps on the road simply to keep the road surface roughly flat.

Such temporary repairs didn't require many skilled workers and took very short time. Lin Baiguang agreed to this plan. He said to Li Xiaolü:

"Complete the repair work within 36 hours." He issued a death order, "Must be fully open to traffic before 7 a.m. on March 5th!" Saying this, he said to the Workshop clerk Jia Jue, "From today on, you act on this Chief Li's orders!"

Jia Jue was surprised to see that the Chief was actually a woman. A woman also understood road repair?

Li Xiaolü moved into the Double Gate Tower with her own team and personally directed the road surface repair project. The construction team was the county laborers gathered by Jia Jue—they were also considered a kind of yamen runners. To make up for the shortage of manpower, part of the National Army was also mobilized.

As soon as the street was cleaned up, many lanterns were hung on both sides of the street, and road repairs began overnight. Li Xiaolü personally went to the construction site to command.

The citizens of Guangzhou were shocked to see a "female hair-thief" gesturing on the street commanding hundreds of people to work—but what shocked them even more was that this "female hair-thief" actually went onto the street wearing only trousers, not even a skirt. "The hair-thieves corrupt public morals to this extent!" A scholar wrote this sentence in his notes that night. Next, he wrote, "The female hair-thief has a graceful figure and a romantic appearance of her own."
