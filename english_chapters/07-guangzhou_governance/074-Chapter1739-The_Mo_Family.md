# Chapter 1739: The Mo Family

After lying down, she unexpectedly couldn't fall asleep for a long time. Although she had no affection for this husband, since she had married him, she was a person of the Mo family in life and a ghost of the Mo family in death. Even if she had dissatisfaction, she could only swallow it like tears and endure it.

She fell asleep in a daze very late that night, but as soon as the sky was just getting light, Gao Huichun woke up—there was naturally some work to be done in the morning for a big household. Nothing more than supervising water and fire, serving in-laws and husband. Even in a family with servants and maids, this was the daily homework of a daughter-in-law. especially the morning and evening greetings, which were the top priority.

The Mo family was not originally considered a big household. Before Mo Rongxin's father passed the provincial examination, he was just an ordinary citizen, and the family made a living by peddling. It wasn't until the old master of the Mo family passed the provincial examination that they rose up and were considered a "gentry family" in a decent way. Although Mo Rongxin didn't even pass the examination for Xiucai (scholar), buying a Jian-student degree barely maintained his dignity. However, in the eyes of the "proper gentry" in Guangzhou City, his family could only be considered "counterfeit goods." Those who detested his family even more directly called the Mo family the "Broken Boot Party." Someone even made a slogan for his family: "Father acted as a eunuch's son; son acts as a beggar's father-in-law." It was just that the Mo family had controlled Wenlan Academy for decades, had money in hand, and both father and son were adept in social dealings, so they were not publicly driven out of the "gentry" ranks. But the first-class gentry in Guangzhou City never associated with them. When there were matters dealing with the academy, they only spoke to the Headmaster.

Probably because of being despised by the "proper" gentry, the Mo family emphasized "etiquette and advancement/retreat" the most, desperately trying to prove that they were a "family of poetry and books." When she first married into the Mo family, she suffered a lot for this set of "etiquette," being ridiculed by sisters-in-law, teased by her father-in-law's concubines, and even the favored maids in the family called her "Beggar Miss" behind her back.

After enduring these few years, Gao Huichun was finally flawless in etiquette. She got up early in the morning, finished washing and dressing, and went to her father-in-law's main room to pay her morning respects as usual.

Gao Huichun entered the courtyard accompanied by a maid and saw that the partition doors of the main room were already open. She was slightly surprised—don't look at Mo Rongxin stressing "etiquette" himself, in fact, he indulged in sensuality and dogs and horses every night, going to bed around the third watch. Naturally, he couldn't get up early in the morning, and sometimes he didn't even come home after seeking pleasure outside. Therefore, the Mo family came up with a new trick: the younger generation didn't enter the main room to pay respects, but kowtowed under the corridor, which counted as arrival.

Unexpectedly, the father-in-law had already gotten up today. She saw him sitting in the center, being served breakfast by the Third Concubine, only his face didn't look very good, somewhat pale.

Gao Huichun went in and kowtowed. Mo Rongxin nodded and said: "Get up."

According to reason, the next sentence should be "You may leave." Yet Mo Rongxin didn't say this, and Gao Huichun didn't dare to retreat on her own. She had to stand with hands down waiting for orders.

After a long time, she heard her father-in-law ask: "Huichun, is your father's health peaceful recently?"

This surprised her slightly again: It wasn't a holiday or festival, nor was it a courtesy on the scene. Why did the father-in-law care about her father's health?

Actually, she had no way of knowing whether Gao Tianshi was in good health or not. Gao Huichun rarely returned to her natal home, only once or twice a year. Moreover, Gao Tianshi didn't care much about her. After returning, apart from the customary kowtow, there was nothing else to say between father and daughter. Except for knowing a little about her father's affairs when talking to her mother, they were almost like strangers.

But she couldn't help but answer this. She hurriedly said: "Many thanks to the Master, my father's health is still peaceful."

"You haven't returned home for a visit (Guining - visit of a bride to her parents) for a long time." Mo Rongxin put down the spoon in his hand and took the Australian small towel handed by the Third Concubine to wipe his mouth. "You go back for a visit for a few days tomorrow. Bring some gifts back by the way."

Now Gao Huichun was even more confused. It wasn't a holiday or festival, why suddenly let her go home to visit her parents? Since it was the father-in-law's meaning, strictly speaking, she couldn't ask why. It was good to go back for a trip; at least she could talk intimately with her mother.

She thanked him immediately and withdrew. Not long after returning to her room, she saw the housekeeper leading people carrying loads of gifts. Usually, when a daughter-in-law returned home for a visit, the accompanying gifts were just some "water gifts" like roast meats, wind-dried geese, and various pastries, at most some silk and satin fabric. However, this time, not only were the water gifts as usual, but there were also many precious gifts such as Suzhou and Hangzhou silks and foreign goods, including two catties of Liaodong ginseng inside. Gao Huichun roughly looked and saw that the value of this gift was over five hundred taels of silver, which was no longer a general "heavy gift."

"These are all gifts the Master cared to give for the Fifth Young Mistress's visit." The housekeeper's face was full of flattery, "Also a handwritten letter from the Master. Please trouble the Fifth Young Mistress to take it and present it to the Master In-law for review."

Gao Huichun already understood that her father-in-law must have something important to ask her father. However, in the past, her father-in-law mostly went to discuss secretly with her father himself. Why did he suddenly use the name of her visit this time? Hearing that the hair-thieves entered the city recently, could it be related to this matter?

She had countless question marks in her heart. On the surface, she remained calm and said: "I know."

"Sorry to trouble the Fifth Young Mistress." The housekeeper smiled extremely comfortably. Since she married over, she had never seen the housekeeper smile so warmly and gently at her—usually it was a smile without mirth—saying this, he paid another respect, "The Master has instructed: starting this month, your monthly allowance will increase by one tael of silver, and the food money from the public account will also increase by five mace for you..."

Gao Huichun stood up and said: "Thank the Master for me."

The housekeeper said: "This is all the Master's grace. Also ask the Fifth Young Mistress to look after this lowly one more in the future—" He also said that the Master instructed that there were too few people serving in the Fifth Master's room and would allocate a few more servant women to serve. He also said that the courtyard the couple lived in needed repair, and another courtyard was allocated, asking her to move over in a few days.

The new courtyard was not only large but also in a much better location than the current one. This diligence made her very unadapted—in the past, when Gao Huichun was short of a rough servant woman in her room, she had waited deeply for a long time to get a new one. Finally, she had to give the housekeeper a sum of benefits to fill it—her sudden rise in status in the Mo family made her secretly suspicious. Could it be that the matter Master Mo wanted to ask her father was a huge matter? Thinking of this, she couldn't help but worry.

Lin Baiguang stood on the time-reporting platform commonly known as Double Gate Tower (Shuangmenlou). This pavilion, first built in the Song Dynasty, was ten zhang and four chi long, four zhang and four chi deep, and three zhang and two chi high. The upper part was a tower, and the lower part was two side-by-side large gates, commonly known as "Double Gates." In the Song Dynasty, Guangzhou casting craftsman Xian Yunxing and others made the time-reporting device "Bronze Clepsydra" covering the tower. During the day, time plates were hung, and at night, the watch was beaten, becoming an important time-reporting system in Guangzhou.

Now, the Chengxuan Street Demolition Command Post was set up on the Double Gate Tower. Several blood-red banners hung on the Double Gate Tower, written in bucket-sized Song typeface: "Illegal structures will be demolished!", "Violent resistance against the law leads to a dead end!", "Illegal buildings are not protected by law".

Up and down the Double Gate Tower, there were murderous-looking Detective Brigade members everywhere. They held pry bars, iron shovels, and large baskets in their hands, rubbing their fists and wiping their palms one by one, ready to perform well in front of the new master.

Outside them were fully armed National Army soldiers. Early this morning, National Army soldiers suddenly moved out, completely blocking both ends of Chengxuan Street and various branch road intersections, strictly prohibiting people and vehicles from entering or leaving.

Surrounded by a group of people, Lin Baiguang ascended the Double Gate Tower. He stood leaning against the railing. Looking at the street below, the sheds squeezing the street into a thin line were not much different from when he climbed the Double Gate Tower to look yesterday. he raised his binoculars to look into the distance again. Vaguely, it seemed that some places had been demolished, but most places hadn't moved.

A naturalized citizen cadre ran over to report: "Report to Chief, all preparations are complete!"

Lin Baiguang asked: "How is the propaganda effect?"

"Only very few shop owners demolished it themselves," the cadre said awkwardly. "Many shop owners were very polite and promised to demolish it themselves, but there is no movement until now."

Lin Baiguang nodded. This was within his expectation. The so-called "convincing people with reason" must be based on "strength." He turned around and said to a group of high and low naturalized citizen cadres following behind him:

"Comrades, this is our first battle to transform old Guangzhou and benefit the people of Guangzhou. We must fight this battle well. Not only must we smoothly demolish these illegal structures and return a smooth and clean Chengxuan Street to everyone, but we must also let the people of Guangzhou understand our determination and highlight that we are a civilized, progressive new regime with the mission of benefiting the citizens! Therefore, during the entire demolition process, everyone must follow the three disciplines we announced at the meeting: Do not destroy the shopkeepers' tools and goods; Do not privately take building materials and goods; Do not take shop owners' money for any reason—even drinking water is not allowed."

"Yes!" The cadres responded together.

"As for you," Lin Baiguang turned his head to look at the dozen or so squadron leaders and team leaders of the Detective Brigade, "The discipline is the same." He said slowly, "I know you have always had bastard rules, and such things are good opportunities to make a fortune and get extra income. I advise you all to be sensible and stop fishing for money in this oil pot. If anyone dares to take a piece of tile or half a brick without authorization, pack up your bedding and go accompany your head bailiffs."

"The lowly ones dare not!" Hearing that they would go accompany the head bailiffs, the captains of the Detective Brigade were all terrified and hurriedly expressed their stance.

"Now announce the action plan!" Lin Baiguang ordered, "Xie Buliao, you speak!"

Xie Buliao hurriedly stepped out, opened the covering cloth on the large display board on the gate tower, revealing a large-scale schematic diagram of the Chengxuan Street demolition action. It was marked with dense data and colors.

He began to explain in detail the work area and work content of each team: All demolition teams were assigned sections, each team contracting one section. Within each team, there were different work teams: some specialized in demolition, some in moving goods and tools from the sheds, some in transporting construction waste, and some specialized in preventing shop owners and assistants from making trouble and obstructing. Each performed its own functions with a clear division of labor.
