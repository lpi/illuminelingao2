# Chapter 1844 - Advanced Worker

That Pei Lixiu had come specifically to ask meant she intended to rely on her for the next phase of work.

Devouring this fat morsel of Fangchun Court, the Australians naturally wouldn't simply close it down and be done with it. Su Ai prided herself on understanding the Australians well—their defining trait was "regarding wealth as life." When they had fled Guangzhou in panic, with flames licking their heels and knives at their throats, Proprietor Guo had still performed a Great Shift of the Universe. Except for bulky items inconvenient to transport, almost nothing of value had been left behind in Purple Lightning Tower.

Though the Australians possessed this unique establishment, they knew precious little about the inner workings of brothels and musician households. She herself was not merely from a musician household but had been in "the profession" since childhood—obviously the sort of "professional talent" the Australians spoke of.

If things went this way, mightn't she rise to the rank of madam?

Joy immediately touched her brow. "The Chief has truly asked the right person," she said eagerly. "This servant knows nothing of local brothels, but this servant was originally a woman of a musician household in Jiangnan, ground and polished in the brothel since childhood. I can say the scene inside is clear as crystal. If there is any place to employ this servant, I shall naturally do my utmost to serve."

Pei Lixiu nodded slightly. "I shall indeed need to borrow Sister Su's abilities."

"Yes, yes." Su Ai nodded repeatedly.

"Sister Su—among the women in the brothels, how many are truly willing to eat from this bowl?" Pei Lixiu asked abruptly.

The question was unusual. Su Ai didn't immediately grasp her meaning. Thinking again, she understood: these days, the Australians were trumpeting "rectification of the sex industry" with great fanfare in their newspapers. The tune of "liberating women" was played loudly, and the central accusation was that brothels "forced free persons into prostitution."

She tasted the meaning in Pei Lixiu's words, considered the earlier questions, and immediately grasped Pei Lixiu's intent. With a smile, she replied, "Chief, to say everyone eats from this bowl willingly—that naturally doesn't exist. But for women from musician households like this servant, regarded by the world as pariahs and forbidden for generations to engage as scholars, farmers, artisans, or merchants—young and old knowing only how to play instruments and sing, making a living by song and smiles—if we don't eat from this bowl, what other bowl is there? Even if one wished to change professions and become respectable, only the young can manage it. For faded flowers and withered willows like this servant, people would find us too clumsy even for work as a *majie*." She smiled self-mockingly. "To speak a spineless truth, having been in this line so long, we only begged the madams to treat us more kindly so our days might be easier. We worked harder at 'business' too. As for other thoughts—surprisingly, there were none."

She looked up at Pei Lixiu's expression. Seeing her nod slightly, seeming to have formed some idea, Su Ai knew she had guessed eighty or ninety percent correctly. She had wanted to add a few more sentences but thought better of it—best to speak less.

Then she heard Pei Lixiu ask, "The Great Ming Guangzhou Prefect Dong's daughter—Dong Mingdang—do you know her?"

"This servant does not know her. By the time Prefect Dong arrived in Guangzhou, this servant had already drifted to Zhaoqing," Su Ai said. "But I have heard she is a capable woman. It's said that when the Heavenly Army entered the city and Rebel Dong took poison, the young miss actually went herself to ask Lord Liu for the family property. That courage alone commands admiration—to say nothing of her now supporting her mother by opening a shop and earning her own living. Truly a heroine among women. If this servant had possessed her courage and spirit, how would I have fallen to Zhaoqing to suffer so!"

"New society, women hold up half the sky." Pei Lixiu suddenly uttered a political slogan rarely spoken in the past, surprising even herself. "It was being restricted everywhere under the Ming Kingdom, unable to be displayed. Now under our Senate's new system, women can fully demonstrate their respective talents. Studying and doing business—in no way inferior to men. I can see this Miss Dong is a talent worth cultivating..." She paused. "It's a pity..."

Su Ai didn't immediately understand why she said "pity," but upon reflection, she grasped it. Senator Pei intended to promote Dong Mingdang, but unfortunately, Dong Mingdang was the daughter of a "court enemy"—a genuine "family member of a criminal official." Not being demoted to an official prostitute according to Great Ming rules was already leniency; how could she be placed in an important position?

Su Ai pondered a moment and said, "The Chief need not feel it a pity. That she has achieved even this small situation is due to the vast grace of the Great Song. This small business of hers is like a seedling, unable to withstand wind and frost. If the Chief could bestow some rain and dew at this time, presumably that would be excellent."

Pei Lixiu understood the meaning in Su Ai's words: directly recruiting Dong Mingdang wouldn't work, but this didn't preclude bestowing favors to win her heart for future service.

Li Ziyu had been bursting with pride these past few days. The entire police station was buzzing with rumors about him being received by Chief Wen.

A few days earlier, he had been invited to attend the Guangzhou Advanced Worker Commendation Conference. Though the conference was nominally for all of Guangdong Province, it was actually composed mostly of advanced workers from Guangzhou Special Municipality. To publicize and encourage more local indigenous people to come forward and participate in work, a batch of newly naturalized staff who had joined the workforce since Guangdong's recovery were specially selected as exemplary figures. Li Ziyu had been selected in this manner.

Participating in the commendation conference was an entirely novel experience. Whether it was attending meetings, listening to reports, watching "Australian Construction Achievement Documentary Films," or participating in gala parties—all of it was both fresh and fascinating to the young man. And the old naturalized citizens with their mouthfuls of new vocabulary and "standard" New Speech made him feel keenly his own inadequacy.

The three-day conference passed in a flash. At noon on the final day came the collective reception. Eighty advanced workers waited on chairs arranged in stepped rows. When he saw the "Great Song Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi"—the legendary "Chief Wen"—emerge from the side door of the hall, waving and smiling at everyone, warm applause immediately erupted throughout the venue. Chief Wen walked past them with a slight turn, smiling and clapping as well. In an instant, a tremendous excitement Li Ziyu couldn't fully comprehend invaded his entire being. Unconsciously, like the veteran naturalized citizens, he clapped desperately and cheered.

Whenever he recalled this scene, his whole body filled with energy and his blood surged. Chief Wen, he had heard, was the highest official in Aussie-Song. He hadn't believed it before, but being received that day, he could feel it from the eyes of Bureau Chief Mu and Mayor Liu standing beside him. Chief Wen had been very amiable. Thinking back now, he couldn't recall what had been asked at all—he had been too busy being excited, remembering only that he had said a pile of words about serving the Senate. Going home to tell his parents, the two had been overjoyed. His mother had specially prepared a meal of fine dishes and rice; his father had drunk wine with him, the meal lasting late into the night. His parents had exhorted him repeatedly to work diligently and earn an official position in the police as soon as possible, to bring honor to the family. Whenever he thought of this, Li Ziyu would smile to himself, lowering his head to copy the security statement backup with renewed vigor.

"Little Li, haven't eaten yet? Spirit's running high." Someone poked a head through the corridor window.

"Ah—Ninth Master." Li Ziyu looked up and found Gao Chongjiu regarding him with a smile. He said sheepishly, "Ninth Master, have you had lunch?"

"Just heading to the cafeteria." Gao Chongjiu shook the meal ticket in his hand. "Why haven't you eaten yet? To be advanced, you have to fill your stomach first."

"Just finishing a few more characters. After I write this backup, we'll go together, Ninth Master."

After a while, Li Ziyu set down his pen, took a meal ticket from the drawer, and walked quickly out of the Security Section room. Gao Chongjiu stood there watching him with a smile, which made Li Ziyu feel self-conscious.

"Ninth Master, what is it? Is there something on my face?" Li Ziyu checked himself but found nothing amiss, scratching his head in bewilderment.

"Nothing. Just marveling, kid—your luck is really something. You've just entered the profession and broken such a major case. I've been a public servant for ages, but your experience is rarely seen. I heard you were received by the Chief too?"

"That's too generous—isn't it all thanks to Ninth Master's leadership? I just helped out." The two chatted as they walked.

"Heh, kid's not bad. Still knows how to look after this old man's face, not getting arrogant. You've got a future." Gao Chongjiu patted Li Ziyu's shoulder, then spoke mysteriously. "Ziyu, this time the old brother needs to ask for your help."

"Ninth Master, what words! We're on the same side—just speak if there's anything. If I can help, I definitely will."

"It's nothing big. It's like this: the two of us have been recommended by Bureau Chief Mu to be sent to Lingao for training. You know the old brother doesn't recognize many characters. When it comes to whatever exams there might be, you'll have to help me out."

"What? Going to Lingao? Us? Training?"

"You didn't know?" Gao Chongjiu stopped, looking at Li Ziyu, whose mouth had fallen open wide enough to stuff an egg inside.

Li Ziyu shook his head like a rattle drum. "Ninth Master, I truly didn't know."

Gao Chongjiu pulled Li Ziyu along to keep walking while whispering, "Our Section Chief just told me. Silly kid, this is a golden opportunity for rapid advancement. Haven't you heard people say? To be promoted, one must receive Police Intermediate Training in Lingao for three months. The old brother is blessed by your good fortune to be sent to Lingao too. Our Section Chief said that normally, as an old hand from the county yamen with a low education level, I'd have no chance at this kind of training."

"Nonsense—it's me who's blessed by Ninth Master."

"Mm. Can't deny it: our Great Aussie Song really is different from the former Ming. Rewards and punishments are clear—no sloppiness at all. The old brother has been a public servant all my life, broken quite a few cases. Besides a few words of praise and a few taels of silver, when did the master ever let such benefits fall on my head? A runner till old age!"

"Mm, mm, yes, yes." Li Ziyu nodded, his heart blooming with joy. A windfall from the sky. Though Gao Chongjiu's words were vague, Li Ziyu thought about asking the Section Chief properly later.

As they talked, they soon arrived at the backyard cafeteria. When Li Ziyu lined up for food, he felt many eyes upon him, even catching a few remarks like "this kid's luck is really something." He ate two extra bowls for lunch.
