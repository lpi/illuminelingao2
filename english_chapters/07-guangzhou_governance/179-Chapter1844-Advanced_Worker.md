# Chapter 1844 - Advanced Worker

Coming specifically to ask her meant there was an intention to rely on her for the next step.

Eating down this fat meat of Fangchun Court, the Australians naturally wouldn't easily close it down and be done with it. Su Ai prided herself on understanding the Australians very well—that was "regarding wealth as life." When they fled from Guangzhou in panic, eyebrows burning and knives on necks, Proprietor Guo still performed a Great Shift of the Universe (moved everything). Except for bulky guys inconvenient to transport, almost nothing valuable was left in Purple Lightning Tower.

Although the Australians had this unique "Purple Lightning Tower," they knew very little about the inside story of brothels and musician households. She was not only from a musician household but also from the "profession" since childhood. Obviously belonging to the "professional talent" the Australians spoke of.

In this way, wouldn't she be able to mix into the "Madam" rank?

Joy immediately appeared on her eyebrows. She said busily: " The Chief has really asked the right person. This servant doesn't know much about local brothels, but this servant was originally a woman of a musician household in Jiangnan, suffering grinding polishing in the brothel since childhood. I can say the scene inside is clear as crystal. If there is a place to use this servant, this servant will naturally do my utmost to serve."

Pei Lixiu nodded slightly: "I naturally want to borrow Sister Su's ability."

"Yes, yes." Su Ai nodded repeatedly.

"Sister Su, among the women in the brothels, how many are willing to eat this bowl of rice sincerely?" Pei Lixiu suddenly asked.

This question was rare. Su Ai didn't know what she meant for a moment. Thinking again, she understood: These days, the Australians reported "rectification of the sex industry" with great fanfare in newspapers. The tune of "liberating women" was very high, among which the most main point was accusing brothels of "forcing free people into prostitution"...

She tasted the meaning in Pei Lixiu's words, thought about the previous questions, and immediately guessed Pei Lixiu's thoughts. She responded with a smiling face: "Chief, to say everyone eats this bowl of rice willingly, that naturally doesn't exist. But for women from musician households like this servant, regarded as pariahs by everyone, forbidden to engage in scholar, farmer, artisan, and merchant trades for generations, young and old only knowing how to play instruments and sing, making a living by singing songs and selling smiles—if not eating this bowl of rice, what other bowl can we eat? Even if wanting to change profession and become decent, only those young can change. For faded flowers and withered willows like this servant, even changing profession to become a *majie*, people would still dislike this servant for being too clumsy." Saying this, she smiled self-mockingly again, "To say a spineless word, having been in this line for a long time, we only beg the madams to be kinder so this servant's days are easier. We also work more energetically doing 'business.' As for other thoughts, there are surprisingly none."

Finishing speaking, she looked up at Pei Lixiu's expression. Seeing her nod slightly, seeming to have some idea, Su Ai knew she guessed eighty or ninety percent right. She originally wanted to add a few more sentences but thought it better to speak less.

Then she heard Pei Lixiu ask again: "The Great Ming Guangzhou Prefect Dong's daughter—Dong Mingdang, do you know her?"

"This servant doesn't know her—when Prefect Dong arrived in Guangzhou, this servant had already drifted to Zhaoqing." Su Ai said, "But I heard she is a capable woman: It is said when the Heavenly Army entered the city and Rebel Dong took poison, the little girl actually ran to find Lord Liu to ask for family property herself. Just this courage makes people admire, not to mention she is now supporting her mother by opening a shop, earning her own living. Truly a heroine among women. If this servant had her courage and spirit, how would I have fallen to Zhaoqing to suffer so much!"

"New society, women hold up half the sky." Pei Lixiu suddenly spat out a political slogan rarely said in the past, without knowing why, "That was being restricted everywhere in the Ming Kingdom so it couldn't be shown. Now under my Senate's new system, women can fully display their respective talents. Studying and doing business are in no way inferior to men. I see this Miss Dong is a talent worth molding... It's a pity..."

Su Ai didn't know why she suddenly said "pity," but understood upon second thought. Senator Pei intended to promote her, but unfortunately, Dong Mingdang was the daughter of a "court enemy," a genuine "family member of a criminal official." Not being demoted to an official prostitute according to Great Ming rules was already leniency; how could she be put in an important position?

Su Ai pondered for a moment and said: "Chief need not feel it's a pity. That she has such a small situation is due to the vast grace of the Great Song. This small business is like a seedling, unable to withstand wind and frost. If the Chief can bestow some rain and dew at this time, presumably it would be excellent."

Pei Lixiu understood the meaning in Su Ai's words: Directly recruiting Dong Mingdang wouldn't work, but this didn't hinder bestowing some favors to win her heart to serve her.

Li Ziyu was very proud these few days: The entire police station was spreading rumors about him being received by Chief Wen.

A few days ago, he was invited to attend the Guangzhou Advanced Worker Commendation Conference. Although this commendation conference was said to be for the whole Guangdong province, it was actually mostly advanced workers from Guangzhou Special Municipality. To publicize and encourage more local indigenous people to come out and participate in work, a batch of new naturalized staff who participated in work since the recovery of Guangdong were specially selected as typical examples—Li Ziyu was selected this way.

Participating in the commendation conference was a brand new experience. Whether it was holding a meeting, listening to reports, watching "Australian Construction Achievement Documentary Films," or participating in gala parties... it was both fresh and interesting for this young man. And the old naturalized citizens' mouthful of new vocabulary and "standard" New Speech made him feel ashamed of his inferiority.

The three-day conference time passed in a flash. The noon of the last day was a collective reception. Eighty advanced workers waited for reception on chairs arranged in stepped rows. When he saw the "Great Song Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi," the legendary "Chief Wen," come out from the side door of the hall, waving to everyone with a smile, warm applause immediately rang out in the venue. Chief Wen walked past them slightly sideways, smiling and clapping too. In an instant, a huge excitement he completely couldn't understand invaded Li Ziyu's whole body. Unconsciously, like the old naturalized citizens, he clapped desperately and cheered.

Whenever he recalled this scene, his whole body was full of energy and blood boiling. Chief Wen, heard to be the biggest official in Aussie-Song. He didn't believe it before, but when received that day, he could feel it from the eyes of Bureau Chief Mu and Mayor Liu beside him. Chief Wen was very amiable. Recalling now, he didn't remember what was asked at all. He was only busy being excited at the time, remembering only saying a pile of words about serving the Senate. Going home and telling his parents, the two were overjoyed. His mother specially made a meal of good dishes and rice. His father and he also drank wine, eating until very late. Parents repeatedly exhorted him to work well and get an official position in the police early to bring honor to the family. Whenever thinking of this, Li Ziyu would snicker from his heart, lowering his head to copy the security statement backup vigorously.

"Little Li, haven't eaten yet? Motivation is high." Someone poked a head in from the corridor window.

"Ah. Ninth Master." Li Ziyu looked up and found that Gao Chongjiu was looking at him smilingly. Ziyu said embarrassedly, "Ninth Master, eaten lunch?"

"Just going to the cafeteria." Gao Chongjiu shook the meal ticket in his hand, "Why haven't you eaten yet? To be advanced, you have to fill your stomach first."

"Where, just finishing, a few more characters. After writing this backup, we go together. Ninth Master."

After a while, Li Ziyu stopped his pen, took a meal ticket from the drawer, and walked quickly out of the Security Section room. Gao Chongjiu stood there looking at him smilingly, making Li Ziyu very unnatural.

"Ninth Master, what's wrong? Is there something on my face?" Li Ziyu checked his body and found nothing that shouldn't be there, asking while scratching his head at a loss.

"Nothing, lamenting boy, your luck is really good. Just entered the profession and you broke such a big case. I've been a public servant for so long, your encounter is rarely seen seen. Heard you were also received by the Chief?"

"Where, where, isn't it all Ninth Master leading? The boy just helped out." The two chatted while walking.

"Hehe, boy is not bad, still knowing to care for the old man's face, not arrogant. Have a future." Gao Chongjiu patted Li Ziyu's shoulder, then said mysteriously: "Ziyu, this time old brother has to ask you for help."

"Ninth Master, what words. One of us, just speak if you have anything. If I can help, I definitely will."

"Nothing big. It's like this: This time the two of us were recommended by Bureau Chief Mu to be sent to Lingao for training. You also know old brother doesn't recognize many characters. You must help old brother then. Old brother knows you are someone who has read books. Regarding whatever exam, you must help old brother."

"What? Go to Lingao? Us? Training?"

"You don't know?" Gao Chongjiu stopped and looked at Li Ziyu whose mouth opened wide enough to stuff an egg.

Li Ziyu shook his head like a rattle drum: "Ninth Master, I really don't know."

Gao Chongjiu grabbed Li Ziyu to continue walking while whispering: "I was just told by our Section Chief. Silly boy, this is a good opportunity for rapid advancement. Haven't you heard people say? To be promoted, one must receive Police Intermediate Training in Lingao for three months. Old brother is blessed by you this time to be sent to Lingao too. Our Section Chief said, originally I was an old man from the county yamen with low education level, impossible to participate in this kind of training."

"Where, it is the boy blessed by Ninth Master."

"En, don't say, our Great Aussie Song is indeed different from the former Ming. Rewards and punishments are clear, not sloppy at all. Old brother has been a public servant all my life, broke quite a few cases. Besides praising a few sentences and giving a few taels of silver, when did the Master ever let such benefits fall on my head? Being a runner till old age!"

"En, en, yes, yes." Li Ziyu nodded, his heart blooming with joy. Joy falling from the sky. Although Gao Chongjiu's words were vague, Li Ziyu thought about asking the Section Chief properly later.

Talking, the two arrived at the backyard cafeteria in a while. When Li Ziyu lined up to get food, he felt many people paying attention to him, even hearing a few sentences like "this kid's luck is really good." He ate two extra bowls for lunch.
