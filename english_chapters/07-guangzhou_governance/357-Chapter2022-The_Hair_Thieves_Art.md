# Chapter 2022 - The Hair-Thieves' Art

Li Suiqiu knew that if he didn't do as told, he would inevitably be "summoned"; that would be a complete loss of dignity. He had long heard from servants that the Australians prided themselves on "iron-faced fairness," treating "scholars and commoners as one." Anyone arrogantly relying on their status and showing the slightest disrespect or non-compliance to their administration would be publicly humiliated. The parties involved would either have to swallow their shame and kneel to comply or face the Australians' "iron fist of dictatorship"—either labeled with various crimes and executed, or "exiled overseas"—which, in the eyes of locals, was no different from execution.

The Australians wanted to re-register households; it wasn't a major issue, neither harming his integrity nor his family.

"Since it is so, just report the household. Let the steward accompany you to handle it—he knows the family situation best."

"Thank you, Master, for your understanding." The Paijia bowed again but didn't withdraw, saying, "There is one more thing..."

"Say it all; if it can be done, I won't make it difficult for you." Li Suiqiu was becoming displeased.

"I'm just passing a message," the Paijia smiled apologetically. "The Great Song Tax Bureau sent a notice: this year's general tax census is starting again—Master wasn't home a while ago, so it wasn't done, dragging on until now. Now that Master is back, this tax reporting can't be delayed. Please arrange for the accountant to set a time, and the Tax Bureau's commissioner will come for on-site service..."

Li Suiqiu was greatly displeased and sneered: "Since ancient times, imperial grain and national taxes have been fixed; how much my family pays is clearly recorded in the Household Registry Office. Why this superfluous action? If the Council of Elders wants money, just give me a number; I, Li Suiqiu, will bankrupt my family to pay."

Hearing this, the Paijia bent lower, continuing to smile apologetically: "Master, please don't be angry. These Australians follow the Great Song's tax laws, different from the Great... Ming Kingdom. I am also acting under orders. If you are unwilling to make an appointment, I will just report back to the Tax Bureau superiors..."

Li Suiqiu thought of the recent special report on "Cracking Down on Tax Evasion" in *Sheep City Express* and felt discouraged—now the whole family was in Guangzhou; truly, man was the chopping block and I the fish. Even if he didn't care for himself, he had his mother and concubine-mother above, wife and brothers in the middle, and children and nephews below. What use was fighting over this petty grievance? Even to serve the court, it wasn't about this moment; making this meaningless struggle would only waste lives. He swallowed his pride: "I never ask about such miscellaneous matters; just go discuss it with the steward."

"Yes! Thank you, Master, for understanding. It's official business for me too..." The Paijia bowed and backed out as he spoke. Li Suiqiu was full of displeasure, secretly cursing "truly a despicable vile character," ruining half the good mood of returning home. No wonder friends said Australian rule was "rites collapsed and music spoiled."

After brooding at home for a few days, having no heart for study or eight-legged essays, nor interest in composing poetry, he found most of his poetry friends remained in Guangzhou. However, since the voodoo case implicated many gentry and wealthy households, they rarely held poetry or literary gatherings—partly to avoid arousing the hair-thieves' suspicion, partly to avoid slips of the pen bringing disaster.

However, small gatherings between friends were not taboo. After returning to the city, Li Suiqiu met with friends a few times. For discretion, only five or six people were present each time. Banquets weren't held in restaurants or tea houses, but in private residences or villas. Besides drinking and reminiscing, the topic was always the "Australian Situation."

Living in seclusion in the countryside, though he generally knew the situation in the city, he lacked detail. Now at the wine table, without needing to ask much, many people naturally recounted the fresh events since Guangzhou's fall one by one.

The most discussed topic was the "Civil Service Exam."

Most of them didn't consider this an "Australian-style" imperial examination. Although the form was similar to the Ming exams, the number admitted was huge, yet the positions granted were merely "petty clerks." forget about "high and pure officials" like Hanlin academicians; even positions like magistrates didn't exist. Reportedly, the top scorer was merely sent to the Tax Bureau to collect taxes—in the Ming, that wouldn't even count as a "clerk," barely a "runner."

Everyone agreed this was just the Australians acting like "monkeys wearing hats," using the examination form to win hearts and recruit a batch of destitute scholars for their use. Incidentally powdering their own faces to vie for "legitimacy."

"Most admitted were mere licentiates (students), some not even that. Just studied a few years in community schools and know a few characters—even shop assistants were admitted in large numbers. It's said as long as one can write and use an abacus, they count as Australian talents."

"They say the top scorer of that Civil Service Exam was the young manager of an incense and candle shop! At least these hair-thieves have some shame and didn't parade him through the streets; otherwise, it would truly shame Sheep City and sweep dignity into the dust!"

"A great cry for the Examination Hall!"

...

As if to vent the bitterness of losing Guangzhou, friends all adopted a similar tone of deprecating and mocking the Australians. Li Suiqiu couldn't avoid it either. But reflecting after three rounds of wine, if these Australians were so "frivolous and unlearned," how could Guangzhou fall so easily? How could they manage Guangzhou city so impressively, surpassing the past?

They were all well-read and widely traveled people, not pedantic scholars. Comparing the hair-thieves' administration with the Ming's, judging by results not prescriptions, clearly the hair-thieves were much more brilliant.

In their view, demolishing lean-tos, dredging channels, and banning the Guandi Temple gang didn't count as "ability." Firstly, they borrowed the "military might" of the pressing army; secondly, hair-thieves were "overseas barbarians" with no need to consider complex interest relationships, merely acting with "decisive killing."

What truly demonstrated Australian ability, by common consensus, was handling the plague—the Australian response was almost flawless. Not to mention stopping the plague's spread quickly at a relatively small cost, every government order issued during the entire plague period was executed thoroughly and swiftly, like directing one's arm. The four words "orders executed, prohibitions obeyed" far surpassed the Ming.

"The hair-thieves have methods in managing clerks," said Qu Huairui, one of the Twelve Masters of Southern Garden. "I heard they govern clerks with military law. Clerks are paid generously but controlled extremely strictly. Any slight mistake means heads roll, even implicating family members."

"That is a clever method," someone commented. "If our dynasty could do this, it could also break the harm of corrupt clerks!"

Although those present were Guangzhou's "upper class," facing clerks, they couldn't help but be perfunctory on the surface. During festivals, when clerks came to "beat the autumn wind" (extort gifts), they inevitably had to spend some money. Though just a scabies-like annoyance, it was unpleasant after all.

"This statement is wrong. This method is merely Legalist technique, what's fresh about it? The Violent Qin was strong, but fell in two generations. I view the Australians' actions as no different from the Violent Qin..."

This remark resonated with many. Australian measures after entering the city: nailing house numbers, establishing Baojia, rectifying household registration, organizing police for day and night patrols... Anyone who read history knew this was "Legalist rule."

"In my view, the hair-thieves' statecraft is not Legalist either," Li Suiqiu, who hadn't spoken, said. "The hair-thieves' rule, in one sentence: Raise the rights of commoners, protect the wealth of the middle class, suppress the power of the mighty."

This sentence was deafening, instantly sobering the scholars who originally felt like "viewing flowers in fog" regarding Australian administration. Connecting Australian actions after entering the city and various news heard previously, everything followed these three principles.

"Brother Li is right! The hair-thieves act exactly by these three principles!"

"Unexpectedly, Brother Li lived in seclusion in the countryside yet saw city affairs so clearly."

...

Li Suiqiu waved his hand. Despite living long in Banqiao, he was actually clear about everything happening inside and outside the city. Including the *Sheep City Express* delivered three times a month by the old servant, which he read carefully. He read every news item, every report, even advertisements repeatedly, aiming to decipher the Australians' art of "bewitching hearts."

In Li Suiqiu's view, the Australians' "strong ships and sharp cannons" and "ingenious skills" were all "minor arts." What was truly formidable was their art of winning hearts—almost like sorcery.

From their first landing in Hainan to occupying Guangzhou, less than ten years had passed. It was heard Qiongzhou was already "greatly governed." Not only did destitute commoners vie to cross the sea to go there, but even many local rich merchants went to Lingao to buy land and build houses, constructing nests of pleasure. Li Suiqiu originally couldn't understand how a band of overseas barbarians could bewitch hearts, enticing everyone to run determinedly to the desolate land of Qiongzhou. Willing to build bridges and roads, work and farm, and fight in battle for the hair-thieves. Not only building an enviable "little paradise" of peace and work, but also turning commoners who followed thieves into strong soldiers, charging into battle without fear.

To summarize it merely as "luring with profit" was too simple. Speaking of groups "rewarded with heavy gold," the Ming had them too: the Guanning official army in Liaodong, for whom the court spent millions of taels of silver and grain annually, yet didn't buy victory. Instead, they were pushed back step by step by the Eastern Barbarians (Manchus), almost retreating to Shanhai Pass, not to mention having the border wall breached multiple times and being plundered.

During his seclusion in Banqiao, hearing rumors and reading newspapers, he gradually comprehended the secret of Australians winning hearts.

The Voodoo Case, sparing no police effort to track the whereabouts of Ming girls. In the past, the yamen wouldn't bother managing such things, or even listening—this is "raising the rights of commoners." Common people, struggling for livelihood daily, powerless and influential, were only exploited and bullied when things happened. The hair-thieves were willing to stand up for them, letting them hold their heads high. This is "raising the rights of commoners."

"Protecting the wealth of the middle class": The Guandi Temple gang, yamen clerks... these people were accustomed to harassing commoners and racketeering. Small commoners had no wealth or property, yielding little money; those bullied and exploited, unable to bear the harassment, were middle-class families like merchants. The hair-thieves suppressed and eliminated them, winning their hearts too.

Finally, "suppressing the power of the mighty." The Australians were now doing this step by step. The Voodoo Case merely harvested the always lawless "bad gentry," and the subsequent "tax rectification" was the knife drawn against the gentry and wealthy households.
