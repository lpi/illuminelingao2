# Chapter 1943 - Boost

However, there was a twist in this matter. When Zhou Botao arranged for someone to coordinate with the Tiandihui to adjust Li Jianai's work, Dugu Qiuhun lost his temper.

It was true that Dugu Qiuhun was a bit careless and missing a screw, but he had also participated deeply in internal affairs work in the early days of the transmigration. This matter seemed suspicious inside and out; how could he not detect it? Calling up Li Jianai's file that Lu Xuan had checked that day, he naturally understood what was going on at a glance.

He already held a grudge about being isolated from sensitive affairs such as military and police security. Now, in this matter, from the Political Security Bureau to Ye Yuming, everyone guarded against him like a thief. Even Lu Xuan hid it from him. Thinking that there was a spy from the Political Security Bureau right beside him while he was kept in the dark like a fool, he flew into a rage. So he flatly rejected the coordination of the Political Security Bureau, saying that Li Jianai was currently responsible for several key accounts near East Gate Market, not just Lu Xuan's family, and he wouldn't care about this matter. It must wait until the expiration of the one-year rotation period before considering adjustment to other districts and counties. As for changing someone else to be responsible for the Tiandihui contracting matters at Zhangjia Village, Dugu Qiuhun stated that the Key Account Department was very busy and no one else was available.

Zhou Botao ran out of options. Dugu Qiuhun was now like a dead pig unafraid of boiling water; when his stubborn temper came up, no advice was useful. Fearing that dragging this on would lead to trouble, he had to go to the Political Security Bureau headquarters to ask his superior for advice, to see if his superior with extensive connections could find someone to make Dugu Qiuhun soften his attitude.

"If Dugu is unwilling, don't force him. This is also within his legitimate authority." The Executive Deputy Director of the Political Security General Bureau was standing in front of a vigorously growing plant in the courtyard, carefully pruning it. He not only cut off diseased leaves but also cut off branches and leaves that protruded too much and affected the overall beauty, throwing them into a basket on the side.

"Explain to Comrade Lu Xuan realistically that this is the objective situation... Hmm, this branch blocks the light a bit, what a pity." The Executive Deputy Director thought for a moment, then broke off a nicely growing branch, looking very regretful.

"As for that scout, don't contact her for the time being, to avoid being caught by the tail. There is no urgency about the transfer. Inform Comrade Lu Xuan that she is just carrying out the work of the Tiandihui and will be transferred when the term expires—consider it an explanation to him." He added.

"Alright," Zhou Botao replied. Then he worriedly asked:

"Will he use this topic to make a fuss?"

"Ah, I think he won't. How he knew Li Jianai's identity—this is probably not an easy question to answer."

The hidden cadre identity of the Political Security Bureau was confidential. Even Senators had no right to access these materials if it was unrelated to work.

"Incidentally, let's see if the cadres we cultivate can stand the test, endure loneliness, and have sufficient discipline, consciousness, and sensitivity." The Executive Deputy Director's voice was very low, appearing to be talking to himself.

"..." Zhou Botao didn't know whether he should answer.

"Nothing, let's leave it at that for now."

"Yes, Comrade Director." Zhou Botao walked out of this courtyard where the constant temperature air conditioning seemed to be always on.

Thus, Li Jianai was "forgotten."

Some days later, Feng Nuo finally waited for the long-awaited equipment. The machinery factory kept its promise this time. Not only did they manufacture a brand-new insulating lacquer boiling kettle, but even the enameling machine and winding machine were built and sent over. Moreover, many structural improvements were made, improving many links such as exhaust, coating, polishing, and drying. It was no wonder they worked so hard to solve these problems; the "equipment" in Feng Nuo's workshop was really too crude. The strange smells and noises floating out every day had already made the Senators in the machinery factory miserable. Originally, such small-scale equipment didn't need Senators to come and install it personally, but several people were still worried and came along to see the operation of the equipment.

Feng Nuo was very excited and immediately greeted Qian Yuzhi to help the mechanical department Senators install the whole set of equipment, ready to start trial use.

"You don't have enough manpower here. This set of equipment is best operated by two or three people together." At this time, Sun Li said, "The machinery factory is really too busy recently. See if you can transfer people from the Planning Agency to assist. We can send a skilled worker to guide here."

Feng Nuo quickly promised to think of another way, then invited them to sit down, drink tea, and smoke. Because he repaired computers for people, he had some good cigarettes here. Only then did he see the Senators off.

Feng Nuo estimated it would be hard for him to transfer anyone from the Planning Agency, so he'd better find a way to hire a temporary worker. He planned to ask Feng Shan later if she had reliable classmates or students to recommend. At this time, seeing Qian Yuzhi also happily stroking the new equipment, he couldn't help asking inexplicably: "Xiao Qian, do you have any relatively reliable people to introduce to work in our workshop? Capable and careful ones, with generous treatment."

Qian Yuzhi didn't expect the Chief to ask about this. He scratched his head, intending to say he didn't know anyone, but the name of the tenant in the attic appeared in his mind. Capable? Indeed capable, she knocked him over with three punches and two kicks. Careful? Indeed careful, it could be seen from the neatness of her room cleaning every day. The key was that this chick had some worries recently and seemed to want to change jobs. To be honest, he didn't know why she wanted to change jobs because her actual work wasn't too busy—it could even be said to be leisurely. She only went to work three days a week, and mostly came back before dark.

He answered vaguely: "I have a... friend, working in the Tiandihui. Not too busy, can come over a few days a week... But I have to go back and ask."

Since being "put on the other list" by both Lu Xuan and Dugu, Li Jianai had fallen into a state of semi-unemployment. Apart from being responsible for the accounts of those few key accounts, she had almost nothing to do—generally speaking, the Tiandihui didn't support idlers, there were always other things, but Dugu Qiuhun didn't arrange other work for her. He also told her that when there was no specific work, she didn't need to go to Zhangjia Village and could "work" at home, directly leaving her "hanging" there.

Because of this "special treatment," her colleagues alienated her. Except for work matters, no one said an extra word to her.

Li Jianai somewhat realized that her identity might have been exposed, but without specific instructions, she dared not act rashly, so she had to endure like this.

Feng Nuo didn't mind; he just asked casually. So he told him to notify Li Jianai to "come and try when free."

Therefore, when Li Jianai appeared in front of him the next day, Feng Nuo was quite surprised. However, Li Jianai soon proved her "capability" and "carefulness." She introduced herself crisply and actively showed relevant documents. After asking a few sentences about her resume and full-time job, Feng Nuo agreed to let her work part-time—naturally, he couldn't welcome a young and beautiful girl coming to work here enough. At the very least, she could help with cooking and housework.

Actually, when Li Jianai heard Qian Yuzhi mention this the day before, she also felt it was very absurd. But thinking carefully, she felt there seemed to be no reason why not. Anyway, currently, she had lost contact with the "organization" and had a lot of free time every week. The two Senators she could contact, Lu Xuan and Dugu Qiuhun, were very cold. Why not go see what this Senator Feng in the electric-something workshop was like? Hearing Qian Yuzhi say his Living Secretary seemed to be a senior sister from Fangcaodi, although she hadn't taken her classes, Li Jianai had some impression of this girl. Going over this time, she could try to build a relationship; maybe she could find another way out in the future.

So she reported her intention to work part-time to her superior. As soon as the report was sent up, she immediately received an "Approved" reply. This efficiency made her scratch her head.

The team was barely gathered, so time shouldn't be wasted. Feng Nuo immediately called Sun Li and asked him to send someone to guide them. After a while, a person wearing ordinary worker's clothes knocked and entered. Feng Nuo had seen him; he was exactly the person who brought Qian Yuzhi over last time. His name was very special, called "Jia Ben" (Toluene). He had a deep impression, thinking at the time which chemical department Senator was on duty when taking him in.

This man looked over thirty, appearance unprepossessing, but his eyes were piercing. He had few expressions on his face, only showing a polite smile when reporting to Feng Nuo.

"Section Leader Jia." Qian Yuzhi greeted the visitor with a slightly guilty conscience; this person was his former section leader.

Jia Ben nodded to him, glanced at Li Jianai again, a trace of surprise flashing in his eyes fleetingly.

Feng Nuo didn't notice these abnormalities and immediately joined Qian Yuzhi and Li Jianai to listen to Jia Ben's introduction. Jia Ben explained while demonstrating, and explained the operation process clearly in a short time. Then Feng Nuo instructed Qian Yuzhi to take the 0.3mm copper wire and a batch of relatively good insulating lacquer trial-produced two days ago to try starting the enameling machine. The equipment ran well. Then he tested the winding machine—also manual—with some bare copper wire. As for the boiling kettle, it would have to wait until the next time insulating lacquer was boiled to test, presumably with no problems.

It was just that the speed of this hand-cranked enameling machine was really not fast, and ensuring constant speed was also somewhat difficult. The mechanical department Senators thought it would be best to consider converting to steam power after the technology matured a bit. As for the constant speed issue of hand-cranking, it was now solved by a gearbox.

Not mentioning Feng Nuo starting to mass-produce enameled wire here—he had to make at least a few thousand meters to be enough for trial-producing relays. After Jia Ben finished guiding Feng Nuo's gang, he went to Sun Li's office to hand over the task and returned to his section. After work, he left the factory chatting with other workers as usual. However, he didn't return to the dormitory. Telling his co-workers he was going to East Gate Market, he left alone.

Jia Ben arrived at East Gate Market, ordered wine and food in a secluded small tavern, ate and drank, and incidentally wrote a letter. There was only a piece of white paper in the letter with a few simple numbers written on it. He sealed it, wrote a PO box address, and dropped it into a mailbox on the way back.
