# Chapter 1943 - Boost

The matter, however, took an unexpected turn. When Zhou Botao dispatched someone to coordinate with the Tiandihui regarding Li Jianai's work adjustment, Dugu Qiuhun erupted.

True, Dugu Qiuhun possessed a somewhat scattered disposition and certain blind spots, but he had also been deeply involved in internal affairs work during the transmigration's early days. This entire affair reeked of irregularity from every angle—how could he fail to detect it? Upon retrieving Li Jianai's file—the very one Lu Xuan had examined—he immediately grasped the situation.

He already nursed resentment over his exclusion from sensitive military and police security matters. Now, in this case, everyone from the Political Security Bureau to Ye Yuming had treated him like a potential threat. Even Lu Xuan had concealed the truth from him. The realization that a Political Security Bureau operative had been planted directly beside him while he remained ignorantly in the dark ignited his fury. Consequently, he flatly rejected the Political Security Bureau's coordination request, declaring that Li Jianai currently serviced several key accounts near East Gate Market—not merely Lu Xuan's property—and he would not interfere with the assignment. Any adjustment to other districts or counties must await the expiration of her one-year rotation period. As for substituting someone else to handle Tiandihui contracting matters at Zhangjia Village, Dugu Qiuhun stated bluntly that the Key Account Department was stretched extremely thin and no personnel were available.

Zhou Botao found himself at an impasse. Dugu Qiuhun had adopted the attitude of a dead pig unafraid of boiling water; when his stubborn streak emerged, no persuasion proved effective. Fearing that prolonging the situation would breed complications, Zhou had no choice but to visit Political Security Bureau headquarters and seek his superior's counsel, hoping someone with more extensive connections might soften Dugu Qiuhun's stance.

"If Dugu is unwilling, don't force him. This falls within his legitimate authority," the Executive Deputy Director of the Political Security General Bureau said. He stood before a vigorously growing plant in the courtyard, pruning it with meticulous care. He removed not only diseased leaves but also branches and foliage that protruded excessively, disrupting the overall aesthetic, depositing them in a basket alongside.

"Explain the objective circumstances to Comrade Lu Xuan in realistic terms... Hmm, this branch blocks the light somewhat. What a pity." The Executive Deputy Director contemplated briefly, then snapped off a thriving branch, his expression registering genuine regret.

"As for that scout, suspend contact for the time being to avoid leaving any handles for exploitation. There's no urgency regarding the transfer. Inform Comrade Lu Xuan that she's merely executing Tiandihui duties and will be reassigned when her term expires—consider it an explanation to him." He added.

"Understood," Zhou Botao replied. Then, with evident concern, he asked:

"Will he use this issue to make trouble?"

"Ah, I think not. How he discovered Li Jianai's identity—that's probably not a question he can easily answer."

The hidden cadre identities within the Political Security Bureau were classified information. Even Senators lacked access to such materials unless work-related necessity demanded it.

"Incidentally, let's observe whether the cadres we cultivate can withstand testing, endure isolation, and demonstrate sufficient discipline, awareness, and discernment." The Executive Deputy Director's voice dropped low, as though musing aloud to himself.

"..." Zhou Botao couldn't determine whether a response was expected.

"Nothing more. Let's leave it at that for now."

"Yes, Comrade Director." Zhou Botao departed from the courtyard where the climate control seemed to maintain perpetual perfect temperature.

Thus, Li Jianai was "forgotten."

Some days later, Feng Nuo finally received the long-awaited equipment. The machinery factory honored its commitment this time. They delivered not only a brand-new insulating lacquer boiling kettle but also complete enameling and winding machines. Moreover, they'd implemented numerous structural improvements, enhancing exhaust, coating, polishing, and drying systems. Their extraordinary effort made perfect sense; the "equipment" in Feng Nuo's workshop had been appallingly crude. The bizarre odors and cacophony emanating daily had already made life miserable for senators at the machinery factory. Ordinarily, such small-scale equipment installation wouldn't require senatorial presence, yet several had accompanied the delivery anyway, anxious to witness the equipment's operation firsthand.

Feng Nuo fairly vibrated with excitement, immediately summoning Qian Yuzhi to assist the Mechanical Department senators in installing the complete setup, preparing for trial operations.

"You're understaffed here. This equipment operates best with two or three people working in coordination," Sun Li observed at this point. "The machinery factory is genuinely overwhelmed at present. See whether you can requisition personnel from the Planning Agency for assistance. We can dispatch a skilled worker to provide on-site guidance."

Feng Nuo quickly promised to explore alternative solutions, then invited them to sit, offering tea and cigarettes. His computer repair work had garnered him some premium tobacco. Only after properly entertaining them did he see the senators off.

Feng Nuo estimated that securing anyone from the Planning Agency would prove difficult; his best option lay in hiring temporary labor. He planned to ask Feng Shan later whether she could recommend reliable classmates or students. At that moment, observing Qian Yuzhi also happily caressing the new equipment, he asked on impulse: "Xiao Qian, do you know anyone relatively reliable to recommend for work in our workshop? Capable and meticulous individuals—the compensation would be generous."

Qian Yuzhi hadn't expected the Chief to broach this topic. He scratched his head, intending to say he knew no one, but the image of his attic tenant surfaced unbidden. Capable? Undoubtedly—she'd knocked him flat with three punches and two kicks. Meticulous? Certainly, as evidenced by the daily spotlessness of her room. Crucially, this young woman seemed troubled lately and apparently wanted to change positions. Truthfully, he couldn't fathom why she sought new employment, as her current work wasn't particularly demanding—one might even call it leisurely. She only worked three days weekly and typically returned before dark.

He answered evasively: "I have a... friend, employed with the Tiandihui. Not especially busy, could come over several days weekly... But I'd have to inquire first."

Since being "blacklisted" by both Lu Xuan and Dugu, Li Jianai had descended into semi-unemployment. Beyond managing accounts for those few key clients, she had virtually nothing to do. Generally speaking, the Tiandihui didn't support idle workers—there were always tasks—yet Dugu Qiuhun assigned her nothing. He'd even told her that when no specific work demanded attention, she needn't travel to Zhangjia Village and could "work" from home, effectively leaving her suspended in limbo.

This "special treatment" prompted her colleagues to ostracize her. Beyond strictly work-related exchanges, no one addressed her unnecessarily.

Li Jianai had begun to suspect her identity might be compromised, but without explicit instructions, she dared not act precipitously. She could only endure.

Feng Nuo didn't particularly mind; he'd merely asked casually. He instructed Qian Yuzhi to notify Li Jianai to "come try it out when convenient."

Consequently, when Li Jianai appeared before him the following day, Feng Nuo registered considerable surprise. However, Li Jianai soon demonstrated both "capability" and "meticulousness." She introduced herself crisply and proactively presented relevant documentation. After a few questions regarding her background and full-time employment, Feng Nuo agreed to let her work part-time. Naturally, he could hardly object to a young and attractive woman joining the operation. At minimum, she could assist with cooking and housekeeping.

Actually, when Li Jianai first heard Qian Yuzhi mention the opportunity the previous day, she'd found it absurd. Upon reflection, though, she could discern no reason to refuse. Currently, she'd lost organizational contact and possessed abundant free time weekly. The two senators she could access—Lu Xuan and Dugu Qiuhun—both treated her with pronounced coldness. Why not investigate what manner of person this Senator Feng from the electrical-something workshop might be? Hearing from Qian Yuzhi that his Living Secretary appeared to be a Fangcaodi senior, Li Jianai realized that although she'd never taken the woman's classes, she retained some impression of her. Making this visit, she could attempt to establish rapport; perhaps it might open alternative pathways forward.

She submitted her part-time work intention to her supervisor. The moment her report ascended, she received an "Approved" response. The efficiency left her bemused.

With the team barely assembled, no time should be wasted. Feng Nuo immediately contacted Sun Li, requesting guidance personnel. Shortly thereafter, someone in ordinary worker's attire knocked and entered. Feng Nuo recognized him—precisely the individual who had escorted Qian Yuzhi previously. His name was quite distinctive: "Jia Ben" (Toluene). The name had made a deep impression; Feng Nuo remembered wondering at the time which Chemical Department senator had been on intake duty when this recruit arrived.

The man appeared past thirty, unremarkable in appearance, yet his eyes possessed a penetrating quality. His face remained largely expressionless, showing only a polite smile when reporting to Feng Nuo.

"Section Leader Jia." Qian Yuzhi greeted the visitor with faint guilt; this man had been his former section chief.

Jia Ben nodded to him, then glanced at Li Jianai, a fleeting trace of surprise flashing through his eyes.

Feng Nuo noticed none of these subtleties, immediately joining Qian Yuzhi and Li Jianai to attend Jia Ben's instruction. Jia Ben explained while demonstrating, clarifying the operational process with admirable conciseness. Then Feng Nuo instructed Qian Yuzhi to retrieve 0.3mm copper wire and a batch of relatively superior insulating lacquer they'd trial-produced two days prior, attempting to start the enameling machine. The equipment ran smoothly. Next he tested the winding machine—also manual—using bare copper wire. As for the boiling kettle, testing would have to wait until the next insulating lacquer batch; presumably it would function without issues.

The hand-cranked enameling machine's speed proved genuinely sluggish, and maintaining constant velocity presented difficulties. The Mechanical Department senators suggested converting to steam power once the technology matured somewhat. Regarding the constant-speed issue with hand-cranking, they'd implemented a gearbox solution.

Setting aside Feng Nuo's commencement of mass enameled wire production—he required at least several thousand meters for relay trial production—after Jia Ben finished guiding Feng Nuo's crew, he proceeded to Sun Li's office to report task completion, then returned to his section. After work hours, he departed the factory chatting with fellow workers as usual. However, he didn't return to the dormitory. Informing his colleagues he was heading to East Gate Market, he separated from them.

Jia Ben arrived at East Gate Market and ordered food and drink at a secluded tavern. While eating and drinking, he composed a letter. The missive contained only a sheet of white paper inscribed with several simple numerals. He sealed it, wrote a post office box address on the exterior, and dropped it into a mailbox on his return route.
