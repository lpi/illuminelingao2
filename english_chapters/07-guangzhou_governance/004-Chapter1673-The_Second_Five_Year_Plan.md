# Chapter 1673 - The Second Five-Year Plan

To overcome water resource problems, after Operation Engine ended, the Senate began the construction of Lingao's main reservoir: Songtao Reservoir.

Songtao Reservoir was the largest reservoir on Hainan Island, with a total storage capacity as high as 3.125 billion cubic meters and an irrigation area of 3.122 million mu. After completion, Lingao, Danzhou, Chengmai, and Qiongshan in northern Hainan would all benefit to varying degrees, with Lingao being the largest irrigated area.

After completion, it would not only promote agricultural production in the entire northern Hainan but also alleviate the problem of industrial water shortage that currently plagued the industrial sector.

However, the engineering volume of Songtao Reservoir was huge. In this spacetime, the dam construction started in 1958, and the earth-rock dam was not completed until 1961. The supporting irrigation canal project was not successively completed until the 1990s. For the industrial blueprint in the Senate's next Five-Year Plan, this was merely a drop in the bucket and distant water could not quench immediate thirst.

The Pearl River Delta, whether in terms of transportation, water resources, manpower, or market, was a premier good place in 17th-century China. To further develop productive forces, industrial transfer was imperative.

In the Second Five-Year Plan formulated by the Planning Agency, the scale of Ma'niao Iron and Steel Company would no longer expand. The center of gravity of the Senate's steel industry would shift to Guangdong, and a second machinery manufacturing center would be established in Guangzhou.

The Second Five-Year Plan would focus on developing the following industries and projects:

**Power:** Manufacture of complete sets of equipment for self-contained power stations; manufacture of 220V and 380V small low-voltage network transmission and distribution equipment and related instruments; incandescent bulb manufacturing.

**Machinery:** Focus on developing the equipment manufacturing industry, completing the self-replication of basic industrial mother machines, capable of self-manufacturing basic machine tools such as lathes, milling machines, and planers, and trial manufacturing hundred-ton hydraulic presses; vigorously develop the manufacture of various professional mechanical equipment—focusing on supporting equipment for metallurgy, machinery, and chemical industries. Increase investment in the design and manufacturing capabilities of process equipment, improving the output, variety, and quality of standard parts, gears, and bearings.

**Precision Instruments and Equipment:** Increase investment in the development and trial production of optical equipment, instrumentation, and measuring tools, focusing on developing hand-cranked mechanical calculators.

**Chemical Industry:** Further expand the production scale of the "Three Acids and Two Alkalis"; expand the production of synthetic ammonia by the combined carbon process; focus on developing salt chemicals and coal chemicals. Conduct preliminary exploration of organic chemical production. In specific projects, focus on project tackling for pharmaceuticals, pesticides, chemical reagents, and pyrotechnics. Search for and test rubber substitutes.

**Metallurgy:** Launch a second steel complex in Guangdong, further expanding steel output and increasing steel grades and profile types. Carry out project tackling for special steels crucial to the national economy: silicon steel, stainless steel, manganese steel, and tungsten steel. Expand the scale of electrolytic copper production. Further improve the output and purity of non-ferrous metals.

**Power Equipment:** Further improve the performance of boilers and steam engines, expanding output. Under the premise of ensuring quality, launch exploration into medium and high-pressure boilers; the development focus of steam engines is multiple-expansion, high-horsepower types, mainly supporting ships and power stations. Batch manufacture small single-cylinder and multi-cylinder diesel engines. Carry out trial production of gasoline engines.

**Transportation Vehicles:** Serialized and standardized production of steam locomotive heads and wagons; promote iron-ribbed wooden-hulled technology on large and medium-sized vessels; vigorously develop inland river motor vessels; promote new types of ships; trial build iron-hulled ships and piston aircraft.

**Light Industry:** Focus on promoting silk weaving production, garment manufacturing, and deep processing of food.

**Electronic Appliances:** Carry out vacuum tube R&D and radio component manufacturing, batch manufacture wired and wireless transceivers with fully self-produced components; batch manufacture radios, loudspeakers, and the first generation of manual exchange telephone systems.

**Transportation and Communications:** Complete the simple highway and wired telegraph system around Hainan Island and crossing the island in a cross shape. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, all counties in the Hainan Region will be connected by highways and telegraphs; construct the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway; Haikou Port Phase I; Sanya Port Phase II; Kaohsiung Port Phase II; Changhua Port Phase I; Changhua-Shilu simple highway; Sanshui River Port; construct Guangzhou Wireless Broadcasting Station and Sanya Time Service Station.

**Mining:** Tiandu Iron Mine Phase II Project; Shaoguan Coal Mine Phase I Project; Hongay Coal Mine Phase II Project; oil exploration and trial development in Southeast Asia.

**Water Conservancy:** Complete the construction of Songtao Reservoir and part of the supporting channel projects. Strive to ensure the industrial and agricultural production and people's domestic water needs in Lingao after the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan. Additionally, build coastal dykes in major coastal agricultural areas of the Senate such as Kaohsiung and Lingao to resist seawater intrusion.

**Culture and Education:** In the Second Five-Year Plan, a Complete Primary School will be established in every county of the entire Hainan Region. For counties with a population of less than 10,000, a Junior Primary School will be established first.

In Guangzhou and Kaohsiung, a ten-year National Demonstration School will be established modeled on Fangcaodi. in Kaohsiung and Jeju Island, schools will be established based on the standard of one Junior Primary School per 16,000 people.

Higher education, which was never touched in the past, also had projects: establish a Naval Academy in Hong Kong, an Army Academy in Jeju. Establish a Comprehensive Polytechnic College and a Higher Normal College in Lingao as higher education institutions for sciences and arts.

Tom Liu held the document in his hand, looking at the long list of projects listed above: Shaoguan Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Blast Furnace, No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace, Shaoguan Coal Mine No. 1 Shaft, Shaoguan Central Coal Washing Plant, Hong Kong Shipyard No. 1 Large Drydock, Lingao Optical Equipment Factory, Guangzhou No. 2 General Machinery Plant, Hongay Coal Mine No. 2 Pit, Hongay Central Coal Washing Plant, Lingao Instrument and Measuring Tool Factory, Lingao Electronics Factory, Lingao Cable Factory, Ma'niao Ferrotungsten Alloy Factory, Ma'niao Metal Structure Factory, Guangzhou Glass Factory, Guangzhou Meat Processing Plant, Guangzhou Silk Factory, Guangzhou Gas Plant, Guangzhou Motor Factory, Qiongshan Building Material Cement Plant, Changhua Cement Plant, Wenchang Coconut Product Processing Plant, Haikou Seafood Processing Plant, Jeju Island Meat Processing Plant, Leizhou Sugar Factory...

This time it was truly "Go Big and Go Fast," and Tom Liu felt both happy and excited. Because of the difficult birth of silicon steel sheets, the development of the power system had been somewhat stagnant recently. Except for self-contained power stations for non-ferrous metal smelters and salt chemical plants to solve power consumption for electrolysis, the prime movers in Lingao's industrial system were still dominated by steam engines and gas engines. Tom Liu sensitively felt that the Electric Power Party members were not very popular in the Planning Agency.

From the planning of this Five-Year Plan, it could be seen that the Senate generally still affirmed electricity as the direction of development! With such policy-tilted support, the Great Leap Forward in Electric Power would no longer be a slogan shouted by a few Electric Power Party members in the Nanhai Coffee House.

Feeling snubbed were the IT professional Senators. Clearly, rebuilding a modern IT system in their lifetime was a fool's dream; at most, they could continue to maintain those IT devices that dwindled over time. The biggest hope was nothing more than the Senate re-developing vacuum tube mainframe computers as soon as possible—the Lingao version of ENIAC.

Before that, they could only satisfy themselves with the R&D and use of "mechanical computers" in the Second Five-Year Plan, busy with paper tape punching and organizing punched index cards. Secretary of State Ma Qianzhu was enthusiastic about this, but IT programmers knew very well that these projects required fitters more than IT engineers.

Technical Senators held heated discussions on the Second Five-Year Plan. For a time, the venue was extraordinarily lively, and many people showed rare excitement on their faces. Although many projects in the Second Five-Year Plan were just expanding scale and improving quality, they were industrial scale expansions and upgrades completely relying on the industrial capabilities of this spacetime without the support of products brought from the other spacetime. This was a severe test of their efforts to promote industrialization over the past five years, and the challenges within were self-evident.

However, precisely because of this, once they passed this test, it meant they basically possessed the core capabilities of "self-maintenance" and "self-upgrade" of the industrial system, mastering the highest technological level and strongest productive forces of this spacetime. Next, conquering the mainland and even the world would be just a matter of time!

"With so many port and road projects, I'm afraid our construction company can't handle it." Mei Wan was both happy and worried. "Transportation going big and fast requires our construction company's effort, but there are so many industrial projects too..."

"Don't worry about this; the General Construction Company will definitely expand," Ma Qianzhu said with certainty. "Senators must fully play their roles as industry leaders and managers, letting naturalized citizens have a free hand to work. You can't always be contractors and construction workers yourselves. Also, the Planning Agency has considered it. I'll reveal a policy to you first: when we conquer Guangdong, all indigenous construction enterprises and practitioners in the province will be unified and incorporated. Not to mention anything else, carpentry and bricklaying they can do; maybe even better than the workers we trained ourselves."

"Good, good, then I'm relieved." Mei Wan nodded repeatedly.

"Besides, don't be scared by these Phase II projects. Don't apply the civil engineering concepts from the other spacetime to ours. That's a huge difference." Wu De laughed, "Sanya Port Phase II is just building a breakwater and a trestle bridge; don't overthink it."

"Regarding the oil industry, where is our target? Brunei or Taiwan?" The long-suppressed Oil Party members raised a question.

Given the huge consumption in oil shale mining and processing, the Second Five-Year Plan did not list the mining of oil sand deposits in Danzhou, Hainan, and Zhaoyuan, Shandong, but directly considered shallow oil field exploitation.

Shallow oil fields existed in Miaoli County, Taiwan, with shallow oil and gas resources. Small amounts were mined in the Qing Dynasty and Japanese occupation era, with well depths maxing out at 120 meters, very suitable for the Senate's currently not-so-clever well-drilling technology. However, the output of these wells was very small; oil fields with larger reserves were mostly buried below 2000 meters.

Brunei's oil fields were not only shallowly buried but also had large reserves and good quality, making them very suitable mining targets. But the distance was too far; if developed, it would necessitate establishing a new base.
