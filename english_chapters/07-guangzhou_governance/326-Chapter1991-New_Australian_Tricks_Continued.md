# Chapter 1991 - New Australian Tricks (Continued)

"That is natural. Team Leader Chen who led team here yesterday said, this sticker is divided into three levels. From low to high respectively White, Green, Blue. This White is mark of paying tax according to regulations once. For example my family only paid tax first time last month; naturally White. Green is given only if paying tax according to regulations twice continuously. As for this Blue, that requires four times continuously, that is paying tax without problem for a year, to receive. Shopkeeper Tong opposite was the first batch paying tax early this year. Counting him on this street only two families have green sticker. Proud extraordinarily these days."

"Haha, that Iron Rooster Shopkeeper Tong is happy paying tax? Chiefs' methods are truly amazing."

"Brother Yu, this is you not understanding. Iron Rooster can't resist Australian Steel Pincers..." Dong Mingdang unknowingly or knowingly changed Li Officer usually on mouth to Brother Yu here. Instantly made Li Ziyu's heart jump fiercely. "You look again what is beside sticker."

"Saracen numeral, I recognize, is one. Red."

"This is another trick. This 1 means my shop counts as Level 1, that is a level with least turnover. Red indicates business not bad. If black 1 indicates business average. This Level 1, 1 tael silver tax annually fits to less than 3 mace per quarter. That is 2 mao 5 of new currency. Shopkeeper Tong opposite is Level 2. This tax is much higher, quota 4 yuan per quarter. Of course this tax isn't paid extra for nothing; function is huge. Nothing else, heard of Delong right? In past Delong only loaned to doing big business. Interest lower than peers on street don't know how much. Recently rumored Delong plans to loan to small households too..."

"So what?" Li Ziyu couldn't figure out relation between Delong loaning and Finance and Tax Bureau sticker.

"Wanting to apply with Delong, first is this level. If Level 2 and above, then paying tax according to regulations for a year, that is changing sticker to Blue. Shopkeeper Tong is already Level 2. As long as paying tax no problem in second half year, sticker changing to Blue can apply Delong loan. He is happy about this. Opening door doing business who doesn't have lean times. When silver short in hand, applying Delong's fund saves a big chunk just on interest. Besides knowing this Delong is Chiefs' business. Borrowing Delong's fund equals Chiefs investing. Those on street wanting to eat white occupy white [freeload/extort] also have to weigh if ruining shop and money can't return, this shopkeeper runs to Chief crying, can they bear it."

"Wonderful, this is truly wonderful. Only this latter layer I fear Chiefs didn't expect. Saying so, like Master Gao Ju there isn't it pasting Level 3?"

"Master Gao? Master Gao is truly Merchant Prince. How can mix with us small door small households." Dong Mingdang laughed at herself self-mockingly, conveniently filling tea for Li Ziyu. "I heard Shopkeeper Tong say. This Level 1 Level 2 are all for us, um... small households paying fixed tax. Merchant Prince Big Households like Master Gao are 'Audit Collection.' That sticker is a shiny yellow brass coin with auspicious clouds. Not only big and good-looking, but also framed with a glass frame... Key is below this brass coin a row of bold black Saracen numerals, marking is total tax he paid."

"Why he wants to mark paid tax up?"

"This speaking is troublesome. Brother Yu your family doesn't do business right..."

"No. But I have friends doing a bit business."

"That is it. You can ask him later. Opening door doing business first thing is having Scene [Face/Prestige]. In this Guangzhou city past usurping Green Woolen Sedans were everywhere; combing up famous prostitutes spent thousands tens of thousands. Why? You earn much earn little, others don't know. Can only judge if you have ability by looking at your Scene. Scene big others trust your strength, only then willing to do business with you. We small door small households don't care, relying on word of mouth neighbors helping. Big households like Master Gao value this Scene tight." Dong Mingdang sipped tea, continued saying, "Guangzhou liberated over a year everyone saw clearly Australians' style of acting. What should take not a bit wiggle room; what shouldn't take they absolutely don't take extra. Even subordinates wanting to skim oil are punished heavily. When paying tax even fearing you don't understand, simply breaking fingers telling you how this tax calculated. Compare with former Ming's confused tax counts as cloud mud difference. So once this sticker hangs, equals telling everyone: Tax can pay this much, what I do is naturally big money earning business. Who can distrust you? This works much better than buying a few Green Woolen Glass Window Sedans..."

"Brother Yu, Brother Yu!" Li Ziyu finished talking about things on wall just thinking about asking where clothes on Dong Mingdang came from, Zhao Gui scratching crotch outside relaxing ran in hurriedly. "Ah Juan came, looks like finding you."

"Ah Juan?" Li Ziyu somewhat scratched head. He knew area Zeng Juan responsible for wasn't in his block. Why coming during work time?

"Brother Yu... I knew you must be at Miss Dong's..." Zeng Juan dragged long tone sizing up pair with bad intention.

"Go go go, talk outside," Li Ziyu seeing situation hurriedly welcomed forward dragging Zeng Juan to street. "What matter?"

"Give you this. Accompany me to Ah Yu's home."

"Ah Yu's home?" Li Ziyu opened document passed by Zeng Juan. Seeing written on it:

Guangzhou City Police Bureau:

Hereby our Bureau Comrade Zeng Juan due to public duty needs to go to Zhang Family Father and Son Food Company, to handle a tax related case. Hope your Bureau coordinate police force to accompany.

Guangzhou City Finance and Tax Bureau
August 10, 1636

Blank space on bottom half was Director's signature: Agree, transfer relevant precinct—Mu Min. Following second line was opinion of this Bureau Section Chief: Decided Comrade Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui accompany—Lian Nishang.

"Isn't Ah Yu at Great World?"

"He is at old shop these days. Go la. No matter, process only."

Regarding accompanying to handle case, Li Ziyu indifferent. Anyway without this he still had to stroll on street. And chatting with Miss Dong just now felt mood much better.

"Ah Juan, you are not going to catch Ah Yu right?" Li Ziyu joked.

"No. Ah Yu has no trouble. Remember he said buying land before?"

"Remember, remember."

"Just contract has problem. Bureau decided letting him void contract re-sign, supplement tax. He isn't responsible person."

"Oh, that is good. As long as problems solvable by money aren't big problems." Li Ziyu turned head looking behind Zeng Juan. "Just you alone on mission?"

Zi Yu now counted as old man in Australian yamen too. Australian style of doing things he became more and more familiar. Just like mission generally at least two people.

"And Comrade Xu. I let him go there directly wait us. If not for return receipt of this document needing you and Ah Gui signature, I too lazy to find you."

"Male?"

"Nonsense." Zeng Juan asked baffled by Li Ziyu.

"Then why last week Comrade Li managing this street had a female in group? He said every group has."

"Oh, you say this matter. This is our bureau's new method. Training by working, cultivating one-specialty multi-capability talents. Director Zhang arranged after collection period Tax Hall except leaving two to three on duty, all filling to frontline help, learning practice. Two days later report finished, girls of organ Tax Statistics Division also come to frontline. This street you manage isn't key area so only arranged one. Key area every group can reinforce three people maximum."

"Three people... Ah Juan you good fortune lo..."

"Where good fortune. I am just tax officer." Zeng Juan smacked lips regrettably. "They go to Tax Assessment Division. Won't pay attention to us rookies."

"Tax Assessment Division?" Li Ziyu instantly remembered Dong Family Shop. "Right Ah Juan, just now I saw sticker on wall at Miss Dong's. Listening her tell, your Finance and Tax Bureau has many curves..."

"All three Chiefs' ideas. After pasting this, still can't lack troubling you police."

"Is this thing related to us?"

"Not big matter. Just you noticed colored Saracen numeral on every sticker right?"

"Miss Dong told me. Said knowing business good bad by color."

"Not knowing business good bad by color, is color divided by business good bad. Chiefs said we tax officers and Tax Assessment Division hands few, impossible to go down households daily. So regarding business good bad of shops on street really not necessarily clearer than you patrol police."

"This is true..." Li Ziyu thought. Who business good who destitute in block he patrolled, he really could say nine out of ten. Even not quite clear, asking surrounding seven aunts eight aunts based on face familiarity also not far off.

"So, first is if you see obviously business good for days but still hanging black Saracen numeral, want to notify our Finance and Tax Bureau. We naturally send specialist to verify, seeing if need adjusting level higher for him. Second, does shop hang paste certificates and signs according to regulation. Clearly operating but no tax paid sticker on wall also notice along way..."

"Here comes again! Truly treat us police as dogs on street. Is road easy to walk want us stare. Are there drifters beggars want us stare. Is hygiene clean also want us stare. Now comes this set again..."

"Don't don't don't, Brother Yu listen to me finish. Our Director said, this is called Comprehensive Tax Governance understand? Don't understand fine. Anyway you know helping us stare not working for free is enough. Bureau Finance and Tax Bureau will allocate fund from special fund to subsidize you. Not much. About 7 to 8 cents per person monthly."

"Really?"

"That is natural. Our Finance and Tax Bureau this bit money can't speak not count. Chiefs of several units already countersigned documents. Our Finance and Tax Bureau internal received notification. Estimate you soon too. How about? Just helping us look usually can earn two days wage for nothing. Still passable?"
