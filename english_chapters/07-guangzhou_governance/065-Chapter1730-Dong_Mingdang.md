# Chapter 1730: Dong Mingdang

"He might not necessarily be unusable for us," Lin Zunxiu said. "Now that the court is in trouble, if he steps forward, the court will naturally give him a future."

Liang Cunhou nodded and didn't say anything more, seemingly pondering something. Lin Zunxiu waited respectfully for him to speak. The Lin and Liang families appeared to have only a merchant-client relationship on the surface, but secretly they were deeply connected. The major financial backer behind the restaurant opened by the Lin family was the Liang family. It was a case of "having the reality of master and servant without the name of master and servant."

After a long while, Liang Cunhou said, "Let's discuss this matter later. Keep trying to win him over for now. Doesn't he have dealings with the Hair-shorn thieves? You can find out more news about the Hair-shorn thieves through him."

"This younger brother understands."

"From now on, just do business and live your life as usual. If there is anything, I will send someone to find you. If you need to see me, go to the Visit Spring Courtyard and ask Yuewan to pass a message, and I will arrange it," Young Master Liang said. "I'm going to live in seclusion for a while."

"Is Miss Yuewan reliable?" Lin Zunxiu was somewhat worried.

Liang Cunhou said, "Her whole family, young and old, are in the palm of my hand." Just as he was speaking, a figure suddenly flashed across the wall. Lin Zunxiu, already harboring a guilty conscience, couldn't help but shout out, "Who is it?"

"It is the servant girl Suiyu..."

With the voice, a tall and slender maid came in, holding a green jade plate in her hands, which was full of various fruits.

Liang Cunhou said, "Don't worry. Those who have sought refuge with me in this generation can only serve in the outer coutyard. The inner courtyard uses 'old people' who have received grace for several generations. Those who can enter here are loyal servants who can be entrusted with life and death. Words from outside do not enter, and words from inside do not go out."

As soon as his voice fell, Suiyu knelt down and kowtowed: "Thank you, Young Master."

Liang Cunhou gestured slightly, and the maid retreated. Lin Zunxiu praised, "Brother Liang indeed manages his family well..." After saying it, he felt that this remark was surprisingly inappropriate. After all, managing the household was a woman's job. Using it to praise a Juren master living at home had a hint of mockery.

Liang Cunhou didn't mind and said indifferently: "Family and state—family and state are actually one body. As the saying goes, if one cannot sweep a room, how can one sweep the world? If one cannot even manage one's own family well, how can one serve the court and the country? I manage my family with military law here, and controlling subordinates involves only two words: one is strictness. Regardless of whether you are a new person or an old person, 'honored' or disgraced, a favorite or a black sheep, if you make a mistake, you will be punished by family law; the second is benevolence. Serving in my residence, the monthly money and rations are more than two or three times higher than those of outside servants. Everyone's family use is abundant; the old are cared for, and the young are educated. Servants who are sick are provided with doctors, and those who pass away are given coffins and graves. Governing the family like this, there is no worry that everyone will not serve you happily and work themselves to death for you."

Lin Zunxiu said, half flattering and half admiring: "Young Master has great talent."

Liang Cunhou smiled slightly: "You may go."

After sending Lin Zunxiu away, his personal page boy came over and whispered a few words in his ear. Liang Cunhou nodded and said, "It is not suitable for me to come forward in this matter. Tell Master Mai to talk to him."

The Guangzhou Prefectural Yamen—now the Guangzhou Special City Municipal Government—was brightly lit. The staff of the municipal government were working intensely. A gas lamp brought from the old time-space hung in Liu Xiang's office, illuminating the entire room brightly.

The large red sandalwood table, serving as a desk, was piled with documents. Liu Xiang had been insanely busy these few days, arranging takeover matters, setting up various tasks, sorting out takeover asset documents, reviewing endless documents, and meeting endless people. Every day he rose at the fifth watch and slept at midnight, and his face had shrunk a size.

Hearing the second watch struck on the drum tower outside—at present, Guangzhou City had not yet established a new timekeeping system, and still adopted the system of morning bells and evening drums, firing a cannon at noon, and striking the watches at night. At the same time, a strict curfew was promulgated to prevent anyone from causing destruction under the cover of night. Streetlights and big clocks, two necessities of modern cities, were non-existent in Guangzhou—Liu Xiang put down the red and blue pencil in his hand. Getting up to stretch his body, he had just finished reading Lin Baiguang's "Implementation Plan for Public Security Rectification in Guangzhou."

As the host of the former Guangzhou City Operation Department, Lin Baiguang knew a lot about the basic situation of Guangzhou. Therefore, after entering the city this time, he was appointed as the Director of the Guangzhou Comprehensive Governance Office. A department that managed almost everything from city appearance and sanitation to public security.

In this report and the thick appendix accompanying it, Liu Xiang saw many problems listed as "urgently needing solution"—simply all-encompassing. These were also things that the citizens reacted very strongly to, concerning their vital interests. Among them were traffic aspects, sanitation aspects, and also public security aspects. The "big city diseases" of the 21st century could all be seen in similar forms in 17th century Guangzhou. And the original government agencies of one prefecture and two counties in Guangzhou were very negligent in city management, or could even be said to have let things drift. Many problems had persisted for decades or even centuries.

"Being a mayor is really not easy," Liu Xiang patted his dizzy head. He decided to meet with Lin Baiguang tomorrow to discuss selecting a few livelihood issues that were relatively simple to handle but could achieve sensational results to solve in one go. On one hand, to show the work efficiency of the new municipal government, and on the other hand, to give the Guangzhou citizens an impression of "a new atmosphere in the new dynasty."

Guo Xi'er walked in: "Chief, supper is ready. Will you have it now?"

"Bring it in." Liu Xiang also felt his stomach was empty. "I'll read documents for a while longer after eating, then rest."

While eating the white porridge brought by Guo Xi'er, he suddenly thought of something: "Has that Dong Mingdang gone to sleep yet? If not, let her come see me."

He had been busy like a spinning top these few days and hadn't had time to see her at all. Finishing work a bit early today, he remembered this matter.

To be honest, he didn't care much about the "hidden Ming officials" Dong Mingdang wanted to report. Although after inspection, there were indeed a few provincial-level officials who were missing alive or dead, Liu Xiang didn't care too much whether they could be caught—firstly, they were of little use anymore; secondly, he believed that with the level of the Senate's violent organs, as long as they were still in the city, they would be dragged out sooner or later. The upcoming household registration check would be enough to reveal them. But this little woman trying every means to see him aroused his curiosity somewhat.

At this moment, he scrutinized Dong Mingdang who was brought before him. Seeing her come in openly, she first kowtowed to him, then stood up in front of him. Although her gaze was slightly lowered, she didn't have the coyness of a small woman of this time-space bowing her head almost ninety degrees when seeing a strange man. She was not in mourning. Although her clothes were plain-colored, they were also very exquisitely made and beautiful, and her hair was combed neatly. Where was the look of someone whose father had died?

Liu Xiang was surprised in his heart and asked: "You are Dong Mingdang?"

"This servant is." Her voice was crisp and pleasant, and her answer crisp and neat. This gave Liu Xiang a slight favorable impression. He looked carefully; Dong Mingdang wasn't tall, but her figure was very well-proportioned. She had a clean melon-seed face, without makeup, and possessed sixty or seventy percent beauty.

"I heard you want to report the whereabouts of officials in the city," Liu Xiang asked slowly. "Now that you have seen me, tell me everything in full detail."

Dong Mingdang said: "Actually, this servant doesn't know the whereabouts of any hidden officials."

Liu Xiang was stunned, and Guo Xi'er showed an expression of disbelief—no one had dared to deceive a Chief so blatantly yet. The end for many who deceived the Chiefs was either death or being tortured to death slowly in mines more terrible than death. This girl had such gall! She suddenly felt a sour distension in her lower abdomen, a feeling of being unable to hold her urine: deeply regretting her meddling to report for this girl!

Although Guo Xi'er had been a student at Meadow School for a few years and trained in the maid training class for a few months, she still couldn't help but kneel down with a thump: "This servant deserves to die!"

"Get up! None of your business!" Liu Xiang shouted a reprimand, then said to Dong Mingdang, "Since you don't know, why did you say so? This is a matter of military importance, not to be joked about!"

"If this servant didn't say there was important military intelligence, how could Your Excellency see a little woman like me?" Dong Mingdang lowered her head and said respectfully.

Liu Xiang nodded: "You have already seen me. If you have anything important to say, say it. If it is about your father's funeral affairs, you don't need to worry; we will arrange it properly. As for you mother and daughter, you don't need to worry either."

"Many thanks for Your Excellency's benevolence. This servant sought to see Your Excellency not for this matter. But out of a wish to serve the Great Song." Dong Mingdang said respectfully.

Liu Xiang hesitated for a moment, wanting to tell her to "say it again," but then thought it unnecessary. Speaking of which, he had seen quite a few men and women actively coming to defect to the Senate over the years. But a situation like Dong Mingdang's was a first.

"Miss Dong, you have national hatred and family rancor with my Great Song Senate. You now propose to serve us; how can we believe you?"

Dong Mingdang nodded: "Your Excellency speaks truly. It is unreasonable both emotionally and logically. Even if it were true, you probably wouldn't dare use such a heartless person. However, Master Dong was not my father."

It turned out Dong Mingdang was a "drag-oil bottle" (child from a previous marriage). Her family was originally a small landlord in a certain county in Shandong. When Master Dong was the magistrate in Henan, he coveted her mother's beauty and colluded with bandits to kill her father's entire family. He snatched her mother away as a concubine. She was young at the time, and being a girl, was allowed to be brought along under Concubine Jiang's bitter pleading, counting as Master Dong's adopted daughter.

Liu Xiang found it somewhat hard to believe; this background was too bizarre. He couldn't help pondering. Dong Mingdang said, "This servant knows Your Excellency naturally won't believe it, and my mother's words probably can't count either. However, most of the Dong family servants are still here. His personal attendant, Dong De, who helped the tyrant in his oppression, is still alive. You can send someone to interrogate him and ask if what this servant said is false."

Liu Xiang said: "Regardless of whether what you said is false or true, serving the Senate requires going through procedures. It cannot be decided by my word alone." He thought for a moment, "I am not perfunctory with you. My Senate acts differently from the Great Ming; everything has rules and regulations. No single person's word is law. If you really intend to defect to the Great Song, in a few days my Senate will recruit worthy talents in Guangzhou, regardless of gender. As long as you pass the review, you will be a naturalized citizen."
