# Chapter 1983 - Yin-Yang Contract

Although the Zhang Family Old Shop changed to "Zhang Family Old Shop Food Company" and bought another house, changing the "home and shop in one" state, centuries-old habits were not so easily changed. Zhang Yu's parents always felt uneasy not living in the shop. So the newly bought residence was just half an alley away from the old shop. Could be said to arrive upon lifting a leg.

The new residence was larger and newer than the old one. Master Zhang was an old-school businessman. Although business grew, he didn't go for empty scenes. Besides more staff eating and sleeping at home and hiring two women for laundry and cooking, there was no other ostentation. Zhang Yu came back late, so he just made do with leftovers.

It was already lit when Zeng Juan ran to the Zhang family. Zhang Yu had returned from outside the city and was eating dinner. Seeing Zeng Juan arrive, he was about to invite him to eat together.

"No need," Zeng Juan burned with anxiety, "I ate. You eat quickly; I have things to ask you!"

Zhang Yu was startled, not knowing what this "old friend" came to find him for so nervously. He suddenly remembered the counterfeit money encountered when paying the bill at the gathering a few days ago—could there be some trick inside? But that cashier himself said confiscating the fake money ended the matter.

He stammered: "Ah Juan, is it about the fake money? I don't know where that fake money came from..."

Zeng Juan paused: "What fake money?"

"Just last time we went to eat at Purple Light Pavilion..." He recounted the process once. "Is there some important procedure to handle?"

Hearing this, Zeng Juan sighed in relief: "Counterfeit currency is the Police Bureau's business. I'm talking about Tax! Tax!"

"What about tax again?" Hearing it wasn't about fake money, Zhang Yu sighed in relief. If it was a tax problem, he felt assured instead—he had long asked Zhang Ting and others to handle the second period tax payment, and relevant vouchers were brought back. He asked himself he had a clear conscience regarding tax, doing everything according to Australian rules item by item, not shorting the Tax Bureau a copper.

"We paid taxes on time and schedule? Tax declaration had no concealment either; you know all..."

"I know! But today this is very suspicious; if not careful, your whole family might be dragged in!" Zeng Juan looked solemn. "You just eat. After eating, quickly bring account books and contract drafts for me to see!"

Seeing him speak seriously, Zhang Yu dared not delay. He hurriedly finished the meal in a few bites, then took him to the shop.

Account books and contract drafts were in the accounting room. Now although the Zhang family split, setting up separate account books and cashiers, the accountant was still one—after all, not many accountants could use Australian bookkeeping. So account books and contract drafts of both companies were kept in the old shop's accounting room.

"Bring out the contract draft of land trading between you and Noble Gathering, and all vouchers involving this item." Zeng Juan turned the kerosene lamp flame to maximum.

Contract texts, relevant receipts, and account books were stored by category. Zhang Yu quickly found the desired file from the shelf—all organized neatly, labels pasted carefully with paste.

Zeng Juan looked through the draft Zhang Yu gave him, his face becoming uglier and uglier. Although the original land trading contract wasn't there, the final draft was enough. Zhang Yu watched him flip through page by page with a solemn expression, wondering why this brother demanded the land buying document from days ago urgently without even greeting upon meeting. He had paid full tax according to the trading amount on the document and pasted stamps; didn't miss anything.

After a long time, Zeng Juan finally spoke:

"Ah Yu, I ask you. So this land of the Luo family counts as given to you at fair price?"

When Zeng Juan heard Zhang Yu say this land's asset registration was 300 yuan, he felt the matter was big.

"Ah Juan, are you joking? Is Master Luo so easy to get along with? 300 yuan is on the surface; actually added 25% interest. This is relying on my hat of Senate Special Supplier; otherwise he wouldn't dare..."

"Confused! Confused! Zhang Yu, you are seeking death!" Zeng Juan slapped the table and jumped up. "This is a Yin-Yang Contract! Off-book accounts! Do you really think the Finance and Tax Bureau are all past clerks? Do you know according to collection and management norms, how to punish..."

Zhang Yu was obviously scared by Zeng Juan's reaction, sitting there blankly watching him yelling, only reacting when hearing he would be punished.

"Ah Juan, Ah Juan, listen to me, listen to me!" Zhang Yu pushed Zeng Juan forcefully onto the chair, moved a small stool to sit close himself, then handed the cup to Zeng Juan. Seeing him drink water and calm down a bit, he started speaking.

"Of course I wouldn't do that. We are all Senate people; can we not understand this bit? Master Luo and I made another deal, that is, for this 25%, no cash given. You know, my Great World shop is going all out to make military rations. Only this old shop can make those 'Cookies,' 'Cakes' and such Australian dim sum originally; can't make enough to sell at all. This Master Luo aimed at the Australian dim sum in this old shop. He gave me a list, saying supply goods to the shops above at regular prices to offset payment. This has nothing improper, right." Zhang Yu lifted his eyes looking at Zeng Juan.

"Seems... no..." Zeng Juan felt something was wrong somewhere but couldn't pinpoint it. "There is also a contract?"

"Of course," Zhang Yu patted his chest loudly. "My old man's contract was also made by me. If you want to see, I can get it. But the contract isn't with Master Luo, but with each shop."

"Hmm? With each shop?"

"Yes, the ones the old shop supplies. Sign a document with each one. Master Luo insisted on doing this. Besides, he yielded half a percent interest. Being the buyer I could only comply." Seeing Zeng Juan about to flare up again, Zhang Yu hurriedly declared, "Ah Juan, rest assured, these documents all have sufficient stamps pasted! Not a cent less of Senate tax." Saying so, he simply got up to find contracts and tax receipts.

"Only stamps?" Zeng Juan flipped through the brought contracts and tax receipts.

"Yeah? What else do you want?" Zhang Yu looked blank. "Buying land doesn't only have Stamp Tax?"

"But you supplied goods to shops; this is sales behavior. No Circulation Tax?"

"Ah Juan, what are you doing!" Hearing buying land required paying Circulation Tax himself, Zhang Yu immediately became unhappy. "I am the Buyer, Buyer! My family's goods are for offsetting payment, not selling. Whoever makes money pays tax. Master Luo selling land should pay tax on this deal. Where is the logic for me, the land buyer, to pay tax? Besides..." Seeing Zeng Juan about to refute, Zhang Yu snatched the contract and pointed out item by item to him. "Ah Juan, look carefully. On this document, not a single clause says my family's goods are sold for money. Even if you want to collect my tax, collect based on what?"

Zeng Juan took the contract and read carefully item by item again, finding the whole contract only stipulated Zhang Family Old Shop's supply quantity, times, frequency, quality, etc. Indeed not a sentence mentioned price or offsetting payment meanings. Truly cunning. Looking at Zhang Yu with an unconvinced face under the Australian oil lamp, Zeng Juan wasn't sure if he was cursing Master Luo or this brother of his.

But his brother was his brother after all. Zeng Juan felt he should explain clearly to Zhang Yu properly. Speaking of which, Master Luo indeed did this quite brilliantly. In the past, that would definitely fool through and be convenient for both parties. It was normal for Zhang Yu to get confused—when it comes to money tricks, who can be shrewder than those money dogs under big households!

But he, Zeng Juan, knew Director Ai was thinking about catching a chicken for the Inspection Bureau to practice hands. With Zeng Juan's understanding of the Senate, things reached this stage, documents concrete; even if he didn't report, follow-up checks would definitely send Zhang Yu in very quickly. Thinking of this layer, he settled his heart instead. He drank a big mouthful like an ox, moistening the throat dry from anxiety just now, before slowly starting to speak to Zhang Yu: "Ah Yu, if you treat me as a brother, don't hide from me. Whose idea is this?"

"Ah Juan, you know my family's background. Small business where water doesn't cover instep; where do we have this ability. This was done by Master Luo family's accountant, Advisor Liao. Why, problem?" Seeing Zeng Juan change tone, Zhang Yu felt uneasy instead.

"Finance and Tax Bureau regulations: income from transactions you make at obviously lower than fair market prices cannot be used as tax basis. The old shop providing goods free is still deemed sales, should levy tax based on general market price as tax basis..."

"No, no, Ah Juan listen to me. I am buying land. The old shop's goods are the interest there. I really don't receive a penny for supply. The one making money is Noble Gathering... He calculated me?!!"

"Not exactly..." Zeng Juan felt Luo Zhixiang shouldn't have such big guts to deliberately calculate Zhang Yu who wore the Senate Special Supplier hat. Besides, the nature of this matter wasn't determined; no need to scare his old friend too much. "He signed documents separately just to save money, pay less tax. Old routine!"

Zeng Juan had read the Ming Dynasty Tax Data Compilation in the Finance and Tax Bureau library and listened to old clerks in the division brag. He knew this was the customary Yin-Yang Contract. This time Luo Zhixiang trading at parity in the contract was already giving enough face to the Senate. According to Great Ming custom, having one-tenth in contract price would be very good.

"Then what to do?" Zhang Yu panicked upon hearing. Two days ago he vowed to be a loyal running dog, oh no, subject of the Senate. Today he was digging the Senate's wall corner. Paying tax and losing money was small; losing Senators' trust was huge. Zhang Yu's life and fortune all depended on this.

What to do? On the surface, Luo Zhixiang intended to evade tax by establishing contracts separately. This routine was useless under Senate rule. In actual operation, because Zhang Yu's family registered new and old shops separately, under current fiscal system, he pitied Zhang Yu along. According to Zeng Juan's thought, if Zhang Yu's two shops weren't registered separately, then attaching the old shop's contract as an appendix would be fine. Merging the two could barely explain as trading at market price; at most count as old shop transaction price not clearly agreed. Now Zhang Family's two shops didn't even have the same legal person. Zhang Yu was very honest to let his old dad sign and seal the old shop contract. This trick couldn't be played.
