# Chapter 1804 - Educating the Next Generation

Before leaving Lingao, Zhang Yunmi had earnestly asked Liu Xiang what it was like to serve as an administrative head. She remembered only that Liu Xiang had looked troubled at the time, staring at her for a long while before answering.

"Administrative work roughly divides into civil servants and political appointees, though our current organizational structure and territorial scope blur this distinction. But one thing can be stated clearly: if someone genuinely wants to do their job well, the image of 'newspaper and clear tea for a whole day'—lounging about the office—is absolutely impossible." Liu Xiang had no idea how to explain this to someone like Zhang Yunmi, who possessed absolutely no practical experience and relied entirely on imagination. Finally, out of sheer helplessness, he had silently installed a maritime simulation management game on her laptop, then assigned her a "purely masochistic" goal of achieving "Full Maritime Trust."

"If you can truly achieve a 24+2 city full maritime trust on your own, you'll probably understand roughly one-tenth of the workload facing a reasonably responsible regional administrative head." Liu Xiang had told her in a tone both serious and smug: "I've included a very useful modifier for you. Even using the modifier isn't shameful, because trust can't be modified into existence."

After overcoming her initial aversion to the game's outdated graphics, Zhang Yunmi had devoted all her "spare time" in Hong Kong to this challenge after departing Lingao. After roughly a month of competing against herself, she finally managed to establish a self-sufficient small trade circle across six Baltic ports without any modifications—only to discover that more troubles were just beginning.

In winter, agricultural production ceased, and the sea randomly froze ports.

Area XX needed expanded fish and meat supplies, but experience dictated against building new fishery facilities immediately. First, lumberyards had to be expanded at the timber production base and hemp plantings increased at the hemp production base—otherwise the entire industrial chain would collapse.

Military blockades devastated production outside city walls while simultaneously generating massive refugee populations. Without sufficient material reserves to weather the military disaster, production across the entire trade area would collapse.

Facing a stack of documents two palms high after organizing, Zhang Yunmi shook her head and pulled her wandering thoughts back to the present. "It really is quite similar!" She couldn't help feeling a measure of admiration. "But actual work is far more complex! There's no convenient data viewing plugin like PI in real life." Zhang Yunmi's summaries only extracted what each document concerned and what requirements it stated. The specific data and reports involved had to be read and analyzed by Liu Xiang himself. Many documents merely mentioned difficulties and requirements without explaining the actual situation. If these weren't strictly returned for rewriting, personnel would have to be dispatched for investigation.

Her gaze fell upon several documents separated to her right. Disgust crossed Zhang Yunmi's face. "The stuff from these people keeps getting uglier. I must tell the boss." Stretching lazily without regard for decorum, she gathered the organized documents under her arm and rose.

*Knock! Knock! Knock!* "Uncle Liu!"

"Come in!" Liu Xiang responded wearily.

"Uncle Liu, this batch is finished. The ones placed horizontally on top are completely beyond me." Zhang Yunmi set the large pile of documents before Liu Xiang with a plaintive expression.

"Fine, let me look first. Copy these few right here. Add a note to this one, then file it—my private memorandum file." Liu Xiang handed Hong Huangnan's "private official letter" directly to Zhang Yunmi.

Equipment like photocopiers had been classified as "non-essential electronic products" from the beginning. Apart from bringing one unit to serve as a warehouse template, none had been transported at all. Document copying meant either typing wax stencils in the printing room or hand-carving steel plates. When important documents with extremely limited circulation required archiving, backup, or distribution to others, genuine "hand-copying" was the only option. And transcription of classified documents between Senators could only be performed by "politically trustworthy" personnel—such as life secretaries loyal in body and mind to the Senators, or, more extravagantly, by Senators themselves.

"What the hell is written here!" Liu Xiang opened one of the documents Zhang Yunmi had marked "beyond handling." The neat four-six parallel prose structure immediately blinded his eyes—before he even read the content. Examining it closely, he counted over four hundred characters. Excluding twenty or thirty "artistic characters" whose overly elaborate forms defied identification, the remaining readable text expressed this: rare snow had fallen in Guangzhou last winter, an auspicious sign of Heaven and Earth celebrating the return of the Great Song. Yet this snow had severely affected daily life. The populace lacked sufficient grain reserves while still having to provide "Reasonable Burden" to support the military. The locality therefore requested tax exemption during this year's summer harvest.

Liu Xiang expended considerable effort "deciphering" the superficial meaning, but sensed something hidden. Certain words and allusions felt jarringly inappropriate. For instance, when praising the distributed farm tools as easy to use, the text read "Labor of bending the body, undertaken by women and children, looking up to the beauty (*mei*) of the plow." Normal logic demanded "benefit" (*li*), and whether by meaning or by rhyme and tonal patterns, *mei* should not have been used—yet there it was. Liu Xiang analyzed briefly and discovered the trick.

"After all this, they're still playing 'hidden tail poems'!" Liu Xiang couldn't help exclaiming with a laugh, startling Zhang Yunmi into looking up in bewilderment.

"Teacher Liu—what's going on?"

Liu Xiang's particular pedagogical instincts awakened instantly.

"This document from Xinning County reports that the local landlord class has collectively petitioned, asking us to 'practice benevolent government' and exempt summer harvest taxes. Their stated reasons: first, it actually snowed last winter; second, they already paid a round of 'Reasonable Burden.'" Liu Xiang explained the surface reasoning first. "But that's not the point. The point is here." He indicated characters at the ends of certain lines, skipping two lines between each example.

"*Mei* (beauty), *Qin* (celery), *Yu* (desire), *Xian* (present), *Tai* (great), *Shou* (governor)..." Zhang Yunmi followed Liu Xiang's finger, silently reciting the characters, then stared with wide, flickering eyes of confusion.

Liu Xiang's urge to perform surged to full throttle.

"'*Mei Qin*' (Beautiful Celery) comes from the *Liezi*, chapter *Yang Zhu*. Originally it meant that a gift, though meager as goose feathers, represents great intention. But applied to us 'descendants of the Great Song,' it carries another meaning." Liu Xiang paused. "To save the tottering Song Dynasty, Xin Qiji once composed a policy essay titled 'Ten Presentations of Beautiful Celery.' The person who wrote this document is comparing himself to Xin Qiji—he wants to climb the ladder!"

Zhang Yunmi was puzzled. The acting director of the Xinning County Office—naturalized cadres now served as acting county chiefs—was a naturalized citizen whom she recalled as having a rich peasant background from Chengmai. Though his previous correspondence had many problems, nothing approaching parallel prose sophistication—that rough fellow simply lacked the cultural foundation.

When she raised the question, Liu Xiang merely sighed: "The counterattack and infiltration methods of the old forces truly exceed expectation!" But after sighing, he offered no further explanation, simply burying his head in the next document.

Zhang Yunmi was left with a head full of question marks. Seeing that Liu Xiang seemed disinclined to elaborate further, she didn't press him, returning instead to her great transcription work.

Zhang Yunmi resumed copying, and Liu Xiang continued reading documents. In truth, the parallel prose had been merely an amusement; the Political Security people had already notified him of the specific situation. Now Liu Xiang awaited the conclusion of further investigation before he could set the tone for subsequent action. But that was tomorrow's concern; more pressing matters demanded immediate attention.

The most urgent was naturally the new currency issuance. Fortunately, now that several capable officers from Wudaokou had arrived to manage the effort, he needed only to provide support and cooperation. Decision-making authority resided with Chen Ce and his team.

Next came comprehensive urban governance. This work had a thousand threads and was far from simple. A heap of issues remained unresolved, but at least the police force had been assembled, and grassroots governance was showing initial results. For Liu Xiang, the police system was the critical network through which the Senate's directives could penetrate deep into Guangzhou's grassroots. Nearly all significant civil affairs had to be executed through the police system and the baojia system under police management. The police actually bore responsibility for collecting basic social sentiment as well. Therefore, Guangzhou's municipal administration was essentially "administrative policing." And the upcoming "rectification of the customs industry" represented another major undertaking in police work.

As he was considering how to discuss specific work with Mu Min, Zhang Yunmi suddenly asked: "Uncle Liu, is the thing you've been discussing recently about organizing Guangzhou's brothels?"

Liu Xiang started. Though this matter hadn't been specifically concealed in her presence, he had never discussed it directly with her. After all, the topic was somewhat awkward for a woman.

"Indeed it is."

"I have a question. Since we entered the city, there've been a thousand things to do. Surely many things are more urgent than rectifying brothels and prostitutes? Why start with this?"

Liu Xiang coughed. "That's actually an administrative question. Let me test you first—why did we choose this as the entry point?"

"If you say it's for women's liberation, I don't think that's quite right," Zhang Yunmi smiled slightly. "Is it to expand the city government's fiscal revenue?"

Liu Xiang nodded approvingly. "That's only one of the reasons."

"And the second?"

"We came to Guangzhou to do administrative work. In truth, we're doing the work of revolution." Seeing Zhang Yunmi begin to curl her lip, revealing a "here we go again" expression of complaint, Liu Xiang sensed that the political education at the Academy hadn't quite taken root.
