# Chapter 2011 - Matchmaking Conference (II)

Qin Ruiyu held the camera himself, constantly seeking angles to shoot. The naturalized workers were long used to this, but the students were slightly unsettled by the incessant "click" sounds.

Du Yibin sat in the back with Song Yingsheng, watching the scene, occasionally inviting Song Yingsheng to have tea and snacks. Song Yingsheng remained silent, brows knited, expression quite awkward.

A few minutes later Wang Jun finished speaking. The men and women sat in rows. Without matchmakers, they faced each other across a distance of less than twenty centimeters. Though snacks and tea cups were on the tables, no one touched them.

"Alright, you may converse freely. Note that when the drum sounds, you must change seats. If you're interested in someone but can't decide yet, you can note down their number first. Pairing will happen after it ends." Wang Jun explained tirelessly. "Now, matchmaking begins!"

As soon as his voice fell, the small drum sounded.

A slight awkwardness filled the air. At first, no one spoke. Wang Jun used persuasion, encouragement, and jokes to enliven the atmosphere—short of inviting Meng Fei to possess him.

Finally, under his constant encouragement, people began to talk.

Compared to the men's tension and shyness, the students were much more extroverted. Their behavior wasn't exactly "poised and graceful," but had a certain bold, crisp flavor typical of market women.

This differed from naturalized citizen matchmaking in Lingao: in those events, both parties would fill out a basic information card to exchange and read before talking. The card listed details like age, work unit, occupation, income, etc. A quick look provided a basic understanding of the other person.

But this time Wang Jun didn't create information cards, because the shelter students basically lacked reading ability. Moreover, the content on the cards would be clear to "system insiders" but like a celestial book to ordinary people. Students wouldn't understand what "Administrative Grade 3" or "Technician Grade 1" meant, nor the implications behind them. As for monthly income, students had absolutely no concept of the Silver Yuan Circulation Voucher's value and would need explanation anyway—better to leave it to the men themselves.

As for the women's situation, Wang Jun felt there was little to introduce. Students were mostly "Three-No" personnel: "No family," "No occupation," "No assets." Basic information was just age and name. This could easily be communicated verbally.

Following the pre-taught procedure, they opened with two topics. First: tell each other name and age. Second: tell each other family situation. Then free conversation to introduce specific circumstances.

The students cared nothing for occupations or titles, and even less for diplomas. They were most concerned with the man's income and family situation.

For them, work units were a vague concept. Whether "worker," "cadre," "police," or whatever position, in their eyes it was all "serving" the Australians. Serving meant "drawing pay and eating grain."

This actually relaxed some of the nervous male naturalized citizens. Based on their experience attending various matchmaking events in Lingao and elsewhere, young women with even a slight understanding of the Council's system—not necessarily "insiders"—would nine times out of ten lose interest in further conversation upon asking their work unit and position. Now encountering students who didn't care about these things, they involuntarily began talking more.

"...I work in a factory. Yes, the big workshop. Monthly wages—that's the pay you mentioned—is 5.5 yuan. How much is 5.5 yuan? It can buy about 500 catties of brown rice. No problem feeding a family. I have no family burdens, just a bachelor. Follow me and life will be comfortable."

"...I don't have a house right now, but if we marry, the Council of Elders will definitely allocate me an apartment. Twenty-year mortgage, and the property rights will be mine. What's a mortgage? It's a loan—borrowing money, then paying it back over twenty years. Deducted from wages every month."

"I'm a service staff for the agency. An agency is like the Ming Dynasty's yamen. No, no, I'm not an official, nor a runner, neither—just doing odd jobs, neither official nor clerk..."

"...I don't mind that you have children. I don't have children myself. Keep the child, he'll count as my son. I'll treat you both well..."

"...I still have parents at home, health is okay. Dad does odd jobs outside, Mom takes in piecework at home. Have a younger sister below me—already married. Income-wise, 4 yuan 4 jiao 25 fen a month. I have a house, fifteen years left on the mortgage..."

"...I'm from Shandong. Right, came on the Chief's ship from the north. Originally had a house and land at home, lost it all in the soldier chaos. Dad, Mom, wife all died, leaving two kids... Doesn't matter if you can't bear children, I don't mind. You just be a mother to the two kids. When they grow up they'll be filial to you, care for you in old age..."

...

The atmosphere in the venue gradually became lively. Wang Jun finally returned to his seat—instructing the drummer to delay the drumbeat by five minutes.

"It wasn't easy getting them warmed up; give them a few more minutes."

"You've got an easy job as host," Du Yibin teased.

"What else can I do? It's not a variety show. Still need to organize some performances." Wang Jun drank some tea and swallowed a snack. "I actually wanted them to rehearse a few numbers to liven things up, but there was no time, and no suitable artistic personnel to help rehearse."

Five minutes later, the drum sounded. In the first wave, over a dozen couples stood up and left. They were immediately guided to a side room for private talks, where snacks and tea were provided for them to chat slowly. After varying lengths of time, some went to the registration area to register, while others returned to the tables. Wang Jun looked—about five or six couples registered in the first wave. That was quite a lot. He immediately picked up the tin megaphone:

"Six new couples have tied the knot! Everyone keep trying. Matchmaking events aren't held every day—even if they were, it wouldn't be your turn every time..."

Wang Jun had never worked in sales, but he was familiar with hunger marketing and inciting a sense of crisis. He constantly picked up the megaphone to "agitate," explicitly or implicitly reminding everyone that "opportunity knocks but once."

Under such encouragement, the others quickened their pace. After the final drum of the first session sounded, about thirty-plus couples had completed matching registration. After the conversations ended, there was one more chance: both parties would submit the number of their desired partner to Wang Jun for a final matching.

In this final matching, five more couples formed. This made an actual total of forty-one new couples—a ratio that would be "launching a satellite" miraculous in the old timeline, but perfectly normal in this one. Marriage was more about partnering to live life: mainly looking at external conditions, rarely discussing spiritual life.

The remaining nine women were either too young and felt the men's conditions were slightly lacking, wanting to pick and choose more; or were women who had lost fertility. The remaining men were basically those with poor conditions: heavy family burdens, income too low.

Compared to the women, there was more disappointment in the leftover men's eyes. They had heard the matchmaking candidates were former prostitutes from Guangzhou. Thinking that since they were reforming, as long as they themselves weren't disabled or ugly and had normal jobs, wouldn't matchmaking be a sure thing? They'd felt quite secure, expecting success, but hadn't expected the women to still look down on them. Their dejection was beyond words.

"Very regrettable, some still haven't foundpartners they like. No need to worry: at the very end we'll give everyone another chance. If you don't succeed in the end, don't be discouraged. Matchmaking events will be held again. Hope you find your other half next time."

But since it was matchmaking, forced pairing was unreasonable. Wang Jun declared the first session over, and the remaining personnel exited—the "last chance" he mentioned was a final matching of remaining personnel after all three sessions finished.

Du Yibin was very happy—this was much better than he'd expected. Over eighty percent success rate! He couldn't help feeling a little smug, glancing sideways at Song Yingsheng.

Song Yingsheng's emotions at this moment were hard to express. As for the activity itself, he approved. Since ancient times, sage governance meant the old, young, widowed, and lonely all had support. Men should marry, women should wed. The Australians even considered solving the life-long matters of reformed prostitutes. Caring for the subjects to this extent could be called "Benevolence."

But he also disapproved of the Australians' habit of "making a big deal out of small matters." In his view, such small matters could be handled by assigning one or two "official matchmakers." Why did Elders need to appear personally, and wastefully organize such empty spectacles—in the end, it was just matching a few artisans and reformed prostitutes.

Seeing Elder Du looking at him, probably wanting him to praise the Council of Elders again. Speaking of which, there were many praiseworthy aspects of the Australians, but this Elder Du seemed particularly obsessed with extracting his comments, which annoyed him endlessly. He coughed lightly and said:

"This is indeed a great benevolent act by the Council of Elders. However," he stroked his beard, "it seems like making a mountain out of a molehill."

Lu Cheng and others nearby, hearing this sour old pedant actually viciously attack the Council of Elders as "making a mountain out of a molehill," immediately widened their eyes, wishing they could go up and punch the old man.

Du Yibin was used to his captious remarks and wasn't surprised. He asked: "How so?"

"This student sees that those matchmaking today are merely artisans and laborers, and the women just reformed prostitutes. Sending one official matchmaker and one scribe to match by name would finish in half a day. Everyone would have a spouse, and all would be grateful for the Council's virtue. Now you set up a special venue, organize grandly, make men and women choose for themselves, spend so much, yet nine pairs remain unmatched. Isn't this making a mountain out of a molehill?"
