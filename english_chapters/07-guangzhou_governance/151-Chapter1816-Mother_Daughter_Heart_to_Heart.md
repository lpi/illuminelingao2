# Chapter 1816 - Mother-Daughter Heart-to-Heart

Li Ziyu quickly said: "I bought a few Shandong pancake wraps—stuffed with braised meat. Quite fragrant. Officer Lian, won't you try one?"

Lian Nishang looked at the oil-paper-wrapped assorted pancakes with a slight frown: "Eating such things in the study room isn't quite appropriate. But thank you for the kind thought."

Li Ziyu then remembered that normally the chiefs emphasized not eating strong-smelling food in public spaces. He'd actually forgotten in his carelessness. Thinking, he quickly put the cakes away.

Watching Lian Nishang leave, Li Ziyu thought privately: *This young woman really is hard to deal with.*

On Six Banyan Street, the busy Dong Family Shop took down its banner. Dong Xiang latched the wooden boards over the door. Orchid wiped clean the tables and chairs. Both went off to sleep. In the shop, only Dong Mingdang remained at the accounts desk, working the abacus to settle the day's books.

Her abacus skills weren't exactly polished. Often there were pauses. The clicking and clacking of beads echoed through the empty shop hall, making the late hour feel all the more quiet and lonely.

Auntie Jiang trimmed the candle wick. Feeling sorry for her daughter, she said: "It's getting late. Why not sleep? These accounts can wait until early morning."

"Early morning there are people delivering washed laundry to collect. Have to record it, issue tokens. So many things to do. Where's the time for sums?" Dong Mingdang rubbed her eyes. "Our little business—settling accounts doesn't take long. Besides, tomorrow I still need to help Orchid wash vegetables—everyone says Mother's pickles are delicious."

Auntie Jiang settled onto the table edge with a sigh: "Truly it's fate! In the past, you and I in the master's household—though we didn't have much standing—you were still pampered and carefree, wanting for nothing. Now running our own business, throwing ourselves into public view, is bad enough. Still having to do such hard labor—Mother feels for you, but it's no use."

"Mother, I actually think these days are rather comfortable. Being someone's concubine—what's good about it? You served our master your whole life. Besides suffering, you suffered. Even Father's main wife, your senior—did she ever truly value you? Back then, we were confined to three side rooms. We hardly dared step out the door. Never mind seeing the master or the main house—even slightly senior maids and servants required us to bow and scrape. We swallowed who knows how much humiliation. When the master came to your room, the kitchen gave us something decent. Skip him for ten days or half a month? They'd send us leftovers to make do. All those New Year's new clothes—we got the fewest. I'm not his flesh and blood anyway—nothing to argue about. But you served him a dozen years, even bore him children—though none survived—they still shouldn't treat you like this. That Master Zhu—how are you so sure he'd treat you better than our master? As I see it, men are all cut from the same cloth."

Auntie Jiang sighed again. Silent for a moment, she said: "Dangdang, I know your strong spirit. You want to make something of yourself. But you're a girl after all. And from a scholarly family too. Running this kind of business—first, it ruins your marriage prospects. What decent family would ask for your hand? Mother doesn't matter. I'm in my mid-thirties now. Mix anywhere, just mixing along. Even suffering and groveling serving others—I've aged past caring. At least I could set you up for comfort. In a few years, marry you into a respectable family. Then Mother would have nothing more to fret about. Now running this small business: one, it harms your marriage prospects. Two, if some mishap makes it fail—how would we even survive?"

Dong Mingdang laughed: "Mother, you worry too much. The dozen-plus years we've lived have been dependent on others. Not mentioning resentment—the Master Zhu you mention—can you guarantee he'll keep you your whole life? When we were at the Dong household, weren't you always terrified? Every time the master didn't visit for a month or two, you feared he'd grown tired and would sweep us out the door? Watching others' faces, walking on eggshells, none of that matters. And it's not like I can't swallow my pride either. But even if you watch their faces and tread carefully, it might not end well. Better to support ourselves with our own hands—at least there's some certainty. As for this business, I still think: Guangzhou has money everywhere. It's just whether we can pick it up. The Australians have come. The times are peaceful. Business is easier too."

Auntie Jiang wanted to say more, thought better of it, and said: "Mother is useless. You have vision and opinions. As you say then. Just remember your own status. Running business means showing your face—unavoidable. But conduct yourself with measure!"

Dong Mingdang gave an "I understand."

Auntie Jiang said primly: "It was wrong of you to personally hand those *Lonicera* flowers to that Li constable today. Should have had Orchid or Dong Xiang do it. And those painted flowers on the paper bag—you drew them? Though business means cultivating public officials, this is going too far. What if that Li constable gets ideas? If he sends a matchmaker—how do we respond? Say yes—it demeans you. Mother would grieve. He's just a petty clerk, after all. Say no—and he might hold a grudge. These constables and runners—any of them decent people? Harming folk like us with no roots, no connections—just a flick of the wrist."

Dong Mingdang said softly: "Mother, you're right. Your daughter was thoughtless. But in your daughter's view, Australian police aren't the same as Ming constables and runners. That Officer Li—judging by his past words and deeds, though somewhat dandyish like a young master, he's an upright person. It won't come to that. Even if worst came to worst, Prefect Liu's chamber maid has some friendship with your daughter. If things got urgent, we could ask her."

After leaving Guangxiao Temple, Dong Mingdang had prepared a gift of Guangzhou specialties and called on Guo Xier—precisely to cultivate connections. Guo Xier had no acquaintances in Guangzhou. Besides work, it was all work. She naturally found it boring. Dong Mingdang's visit suited her perfectly. Dong Mingdang was a sharp-witted survivor of a great household's politics. Reading people and knowing what to say came naturally. Guo Xier had no guile. A couple of exchanges and they became close friends, often visiting back and forth. This was also an important reason for Dong Mingdang's confidence in opening the shop.

Auntie Jiang said: "Just keep your sense of limits! Depending on others is never as good as depending on yourself."

Dong Mingdang thought—now you say "depend on yourself"! She held back a laugh and lowered her head: "As you say, Mother."

Auntie Jiang rose: "I won't keep you from your work. When you're done, go to bed soon." Her gaze was tender yet worried. "Don't wear yourself out."

"I know, Mother. I'll sleep in just a bit."

"And your foot-bindings—wrap them tight before bed. I've noticed these past days they've gotten loose. Your small feet—I spent so much effort to shape. If they loosen up, all that work goes to waste."

Dong Mingdang had been secretly loosening her bindings for quite a while now. She hadn't thought her mother's eyes were still this sharp. She could only answer: "Yes, your daughter understands."

The Great Song Guangzhou Special Municipal Police Bureau's Public Security Section was always bustling. All the people patrol officers and National Army soldiers arrested flowed constantly in. The converted yamen hall serving as office space was often packed to bursting, voices clamoring.

Though both the National Army and Bopo Army—two powerful armed forces—were stationed in Guangzhou to maintain order, in this era where Ming legal authority had crumbled yet Elder Council glory had not yet illuminated the land, plenty sought to fish in troubled waters. In the first month, serious cases had proliferated. After several months of "severe crackdowns," murderers and robbers had dramatically declined. Replacing them were floods of petty offenses: fraud, theft, pickpocketing, extortion, brawling, property damage, sanitation violations... These weren't explosions of new crime in Guangzhou but rather: under Ming law, some hadn't counted as offenses; others were things citizens had accepted as normal but now counted as minor public order cases. Naturally the numbers rose.

Li Ziyu's main job in Public Security was handling these people delivered by patrol officers. Some urinated or defecated in the streets. Some fought. Some were neighbor disputes... Some suspects, who in the past might have caught "deterrent beatings," couldn't now—police bureau regulations forbade using canes. Someone else handled that.

"Ah Gui, take these two to the back and 'hang them up.' Let them cool off first, then turn them over to the public order court."

Li Ziyu handed two youths who'd beaten a vegetable farmer outside the city and robbed his vegetables to Ah Gui. In the holding cells in back, there was a horizontal bar mounted to the wall. Those being "hung" were single-handcuffed to the bar, bodies not suspended, toes touching the ground. After half a day or a day, some even lost bladder control—just about to get a drink of water when Zeng Juan appeared in the office, weeping.

"Brother Yu! You have to help me!"

His entrance and cry drew everyone in the room to stare. Li Ziyu was startled too. Then looking at Zeng Juan's appearance: hair disheveled, face criss-crossed with scratches, some already oozing blood. Clothes covered in mud, even torn open with a rip.

Li Ziyu quickly came forward: "Zeng Juan, what happened?! Got into a fight?" He gestured at Ah Gui: "Bring paper and pen! Take notes!"

"Mingnu!... Mingnu... Mingnu is gone! Wuwuwu... It must be that damned woman who sold her off... wuwuwu..."
