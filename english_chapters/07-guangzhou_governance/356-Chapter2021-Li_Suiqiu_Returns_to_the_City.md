# Chapter 2021 - Li Suiqiu Returns to the City

When Cui Hantang received local scholars who came to visit, he always upheld the intention of "befriending"—even though Fu Meng reminded him not to get too close to these people. However, Cui Hantang believed religion should maintain a "folk" character and shouldn't appear with an "official" face. Being too "official" made many things impossible to do and words impossible to say, losing flexibility instead.

Currently, his titles of Elder and "Supervisor of Five Immortals Temple" already gave him plenty of "official air." If he followed policy closely and imitated every step, he would push away many middle-of-the-road masses. Better to maintain a certain superficial independence, existing as a gray communication channel between public and private.

As for what would happen to these scholars and gentry in the future, and how the Council of Elders would treat them, that wasn't his concern. For now, the scholars' attitude had a significant guiding effect on expanding New Daoism's influence in Guangzhou.

Although he had interacted with many Guangzhou scholars recently, including some "celebrities," he hadn't met anyone of real weight yet—Li Suiqiu counted as the first.

Li Suiqiu was a famous literati in late Ming Guangdong, the renowned "Peony Top Scholar," skilled in poetry and painting. He was a representative figure of the ripe and brilliant urban culture of the late Ming. But at the same time, he was a member of the Restoration Society (Fushe), an anti-Qing patriot, who finally died defending Ganzhou for the Ming.

But at this moment, Li Suiqiu was neither "Peony Top Scholar" nor "anti-Qing patriot," just an ordinary scholar who repeatedly failed examinations and devoted himself to poetry and prose. Although he participated in the "Yinshan Assembly" in the second year of崇祯 (Chongzhen) and was an early member of the Restoration Society, he didn't have much political influence yet.

He probably never dreamed that the *Confidential Directory of Guangzhou Local Celebrities* compiled by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau would record his entire chronology in another timeline. Enjoying the same treatment were his teacher Chen Zizhuang, and ten others of the yet-to-be-formed "Twelve Masters of Southern Garden Poetry Society."

These people, who fully expressed their integrity and loyalty in another timeline, were key targets of the Council of Elders' attention. Not only because they had great appeal among Guangzhou's gentry and commoners, but also to prevent them from becoming "anti-Council martyrs."

So in the days since entering the city, although the Political Security Bureau monitored them closely, they weren't disturbed. Some who secretly left Guangzhou weren't stopped either: for the Council of Elders, their voluntary departure was actually a good thing.

Li Suiqiu didn't leave Guangzhou. He was extremely filial; in the history of the old timeline, during the Chongzhen era, he refused imperial conscription citing his mother's old age. His mother, Madame Su, was over seventy now and couldn't withstand long travel fatigue. So he took his wife and children to live in seclusion with his mother at the old family manor, Liaoshui Residence, in Banqiao Village, Panyu County.

They stayed there for over half a year. The Li family had lived in Banqiao Village for generations and had considerable influence there. Although social order outside the city was temporarily chaotic after Guangzhou fell, the village community had local militia for self-defense and wasn't affected much. Soon the National Army swept the countryside, clearing banditry, and Guangzhou's suburbs returned to peace. Li Suiqiu originally wanted to return to the city then, to see the situation before deciding to stay or leave, but a great plague broke out in Guangzhou, and rumors spread that Governor Xiong would lead an army to counterattack. So Li Suiqiu gave up the idea of returning. He simply stayed in the countryside to study and write in peace, living a secluded life. By the time the plague receded, it was already the ninth year of Chongzhen.

From the spring of the eighth year of Chongzhen when the Australians seized Guangzhou to now, a year and a half had passed. Despite the treacherous situation in the city—from the voodoo case to the plague outbreak and the recent series of "tax cases" triggered by tax collection cleanup—leaving the city's gentry and wealthy households in panic, Li Suiqiu's life was quite peaceful. He even completed his work *Zhouyi Yaowu Dangming*, accomplishing a major task.

Although he lived in seclusion in the countryside, concentrating on writing and refusing guests, adopting a stance of "ignoring window affairs, only reading sage books," he was actually very clear about the situation inside Guangzhou city—servants left at home came to Banqiao Village every now and then to deliver items and letters. Sometimes they even brought the hair-thieves' "gazette" like *Sheep City Express*.

Li Suiqiu wasn't ignorant about the Australians: when Australian goods from Purple Nu first appeared in Guangzhou years ago, he bought Australian mirrors for his mother and wife; he watched the military parade in Guangzhou before He Rubin's "Expedition to Qiongzhou"; when the Australians besieged Guangzhou and burned Wuyang Post Station, he hurriedly fled into the city with his family from his villa outside the East Gate; later, on the rockery of his teacher Chen Zizhuang's Donggao Villa, he watched with his own eyes the "iron ladder" built all the way from "Great World," with iron self-moving carts running on it spewing black smoke and white mist.

Li Suiqiu's impression of Australians started as "sea merchants with ingenious skills," then "pirates with strong ships and sharp cannons," and finally "giant bandits with hidden intentions"... But no matter how the hair-thieves advanced step by step, he never thought these pirates "very good at business and industry" dared to use the Great Song banner to vie for the world!

Using the power of merely Qiongzhou Prefecture to oppose the Ming Dynasty's thirteen provincial administration commissions, these hair-thieves were too overconfident!

Li Suiqiu absolutely didn't believe Australians had the qualifications to "compete for the Central Plains." After all, they were pirate merchants by origin. In Guangzhou, they only recruited poor commoners to go to Qiongzhou, never hearing of them recruiting scholars—though they were very enthusiastic towards merchants.

Since ancient times, there were those who won the world on horseback, but never heard of winning the world on a ship, let alone ruling the world from a ship.

He originally thought since Australians were pirates, at most they would imitate Zheng Zhilong back then, seizing Guangzhou to coerce the court into amnesty. As long as the court promised a title like Lingao Defender or Qiongzhou Guerilla General, allowing them to "act conveniently" in Qiongzhou, they would probably withdraw. If the court refused, they would inevitably extort "contributions" from wealthy households in the countryside like during the siege of Guangzhou, plunder a bit, and leave. He hid in the countryside to avoid the brunt. If the hair-thieves fish-meat the villagers and killed innocents indiscriminately, he would have to raise militia and fight to death to protect his hometown.

Unexpectedly, after entering the city, these hair-thieves neither robbed nor killed, nor rushed to do business or extort "protection money." Instead, they settled down to govern in Sheep City. It was said the Australian "Prefect Liu" even entered the city grandly in an "eight-bearer sedan chair." Since then, a proclamation every three days, a "policy" every five days, even publishing a specific "gazette" to announce them. Quite a bit of "monkey wearing a hat" feeling—Li Suiqiu didn't mind; a bandit king occupying a mountain stronghold would also wear a dragon robe to play emperor, let alone hair-thieves who took the First City of the South with overwhelming power?

Unexpectedly, the hair-thieves' "monkey wearing a hat" act was quite convincing. After entering the city, their three axes first cleaned up the clerks and rectified public security, followed by dredging ditches, repairing roads, stabilizing prices, managing hygiene, developing commerce, clearing bandits... Even several "chronic diseases" of the city untreatable for years were cured by the hair-thieves. Especially the great plague at the end of last year touched him deeply. Though his family hid in the countryside and had no direct perception of the plague, servants guarding the city residence and friends inside the city all praised the Australians when talking about it. calling them "talented in governing and managing affairs."

Seeing that nearly two years had passed since Guangzhou fell, the city not only suffered no war damage but prospered day by day. Friends and teachers who had disappeared gradually surfaced. Some knowing he was in Banqiao came to visit.

Originally worried that since the Australians raised the flag of rebellion, they would inevitably recruit local literati for their use, he learned from visiting friends: Australians had no intention of recruiting "worthies" in Guangzhou. Let alone "three visits to the thatched cottage," even the imagined scenes of "forcing into puppet service with swords" never appeared. Instead, they staged a "Civil Service Exam" drama. This left Li Suiqiu laughing and crying: he had been flattering himself.

Since there was no danger of forced puppet service, and Australians had gained a firm foothold while Governor Xiong's counterattack was indefinitely postponed, the family huddled in the countryside felt quite inconvenient. Especially since snacks and supplements his old mother liked were nowhere to be found in Banqiao. Half a month ago, Li Suiqiu took his whole family from the Banqiao Village old house back to their Guangzhou home.

Entering the city felt like a lifetime away. Not only were streets clean and wide, but the streetscape was also neater than before. Commoners plied their trades peacefully; lean-tos in front of shops were all demolished, business booming everywhere—this Guangzhou city was more prosperous than under Ming rule.

These sea pirates governing affairs effectively and benefiting the neighborhood was unheard of since ancient times. Li Suiqiu puzzled over it hundred times but found no answer. Returning home, the old servant guarding the house came out to welcome them. Seeing the house safe and undisturbed as before, except for a "house number" nailed to the lintel, not a hair was harmed—though he knew this earlier, seeing it with his own eyes still made him marvel.

Shortly after Li Suiqiu returned home, the local plaque-armor (Paijia - local constable/headman) came to the door, saying he came to "pay respects to Master Li."

In the past, characters like Paijia coming to the door were customarily handled by the steward; absolutely no meeting with the master. Unexpectedly, this time the Paijia insisted on Li Suiqiu receiving him personally. This surprised him—didn't know what new rules emerged in Guangzhou during his year-and-a-half seclusion. He called the Paijia in, asking to know he came to report household registration.

"Please forgive me, Master," the Paijia bowed repeatedly. "I am on official duty, involuntarily, please forgive me."

He continued saying because of Australian orders, every household must re-register household registration and receive a household register. The Li family had no one home before, only a few servants guarding the house; registration couldn't be done without the family head. Since he returned, he must be asked to "condescend to sign the register"—the Australian Police Bureau would "interrogate."

"...If registration is unclear, the family head and family members will be summoned to the Police Bureau for questioning," the Paijia bowed lower and lower. "Please forgive me, Master, register according to the book. So this small one can report back according to regulations."
