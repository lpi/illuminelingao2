# Chapter 1796 - Assaying Gold and Silver

Such "disorder" was something the Senate's governance mindset was unwilling to see. From the perspective of people's livelihood, although small and micro enterprises and individual households were small in scale, they were indispensable parts in solving employment and facilitating social life. If appropriately supported, they were also good tax sources.

But they were truly too small and scattered. Whether management or taxation, the administrative cost to be paid was too great. Organizing guilds would make it easier to operate.

And the next step of issuing new currency specially needed the support of industrial and commercial households.

In the three months from entering the city in March to now, preliminary establishment of police institutions, abolishing broker houses (*yahang*), establishing wholesale markets, state-owned commercial enterprises rushing to establish points in Guangzhou... in the end, were all to support the issuance of new currency. Liu Xiang wanted to achieve that as soon as the new currency was issued, it could circulate unimpeded in Guangzhou. Whether the industrial and commercial associations could be effectively controlled and managed would become the key to the success or failure of the issuance.

This Industrial and Commercial Congress first sorted out the city's industrial and commercial guilds and associations. It promulgated the "Regulations on the Management of Trade Guilds", implementing a registration system. All guilds and associations had to register and file with the municipal government; each guild and association must have a fixed office address and personnel in charge; all "public fields" and "public property" under the guild's name must be registered and filed, otherwise they wouldn't be recognized. "Official money" under each guild's name must have accounts.

For the situation where there were multiple guilds in the same industry, because the situation was complex and each guild had its own public property, they were temporarily not merged. For industries without organized guilds, they were ordered to organize guilds and elect persons in charge within one month.

Liu Xiang's gaze swept over the text part of various resolutions and orders below, stopping at the list of the first Council of the General Chamber of Commerce. Gao Ju unquestionably served as the president, Zheng Shangjie was the supervisor, and there were thirty standing directors below. He had seen or heard of most people. Among them, a few were "hidden cadres" controlled by the Political Security Bureau, and a few were specially selected from small and micro industrial and commercial households—one of whom was Zhang Yu's father—used to balance the power of big households in the federation. Liu Xiang thought, we must support these few people well, not economically, but in political status. We need to lift them up.

While pondering, Guo Xi'er walked in, reporting that the members of the first Council of the General Chamber of Commerce had all arrived.

"I'm coming." Liu Xiang said standing up, instructing, "Notify Director Chen again, say everyone has arrived, invite him to the meeting."

A few days later, night fell low. The "Jufeng Hao" smelting shop in the old city of Guangzhou had already boarded up, yet light leaked from the cracks in the door—extremely bright. The smoke rising from the smoke tower on the roof also indicated that this shop hadn't extinguished its fire.

The main hall of the smelting shop should not have had tables and chairs like other shops, to prevent evildoers from using tables and chairs to jump over the one-person-high counter and spy on the actions behind the counter. But today, a long table was set up like in the living room of a wealthy family. A circle of people sat around together, each looking wealthy, sipping tea. In a side room behind the counter, firelight rose slowly, exactly smelting silver and casting ingots.

"Manager Shen, usually when smelting silver we send servants, you don't let us watch, so be it. Today so many colleagues from Guangzhou Prefecture City are here, yet you still won't let us verify!" The speaker was Boss Zhu of the Rice Guild. It was said he was also a clan relative, of the "Tu" generation character, but starting from his grandfather's generation, his branch's name was gone from the Golden Register and Jade Plate. Relying on the wealth and connections accumulated by ancestors, by Boss Zhu's generation, he was already the head of the Guangzhou Prefecture Rice Guild. Unfortunately, after the hair-bandits broke the city a few years ago and inserted a Dachang Rice Shop, Boss Zhu's momentum weakened. In recent years, expecting Boss Zhu's business to be suppressed by Dachang all along, his temper also became increasingly irritable.

"Boss Zhu! This old one's whole family relies on this craft to eat! Besides, this small crucible smelting rolls with heatwaves. All you proprietors are protected by the God of Wealth, but in case you get clashed (injured/offended), this old one's family can't afford to offend!" Manager Shen replied unceremoniously.

"Still eating! If the hair-bandits really push this thing through, your family should also close down!" Boss Zhu retorted unceremoniously. "I just want to see. In the future, I'm afraid this craft won't be seen anymore!"

Everyone looked at each other's expressions, looking at each other in dismay—was this Boss Zhu abandoning himself to despair! Boldly shouting "hair-bandits" in public! Was this trying to get us all killed! Hair-bandits, ah no, Australians had been here for almost a hundred days, and hadn't said they would move against various big... uh... puppet Ming clan relatives. Those with names on the Golden Register and Jade Plate hadn't been touched. What temper was Boss Zhu throwing? Could it be he really treated that one sitting in the Forbidden City as his own family and wanted to show loyalty?

Manager Shen was rebuffed and lost face, his face puffed up red—although guarding the silver smelting furnace all his life had long baked his face red—he hmphed heavily and said: "At worst, this old one will close the shop and defect to the Australians on Qiongya Island. This old one can't imitate the Australians' silver coins, but I haven't lived these decades in vain. With a pair of eyes and a pair of ears, looking at fineness and listening to the ring of money, I'm not afraid I can't earn a living with this skill!"

Boss Zhu took a breath as if to retort again, but the other few were unwilling, starting to persuade one after another. Some persuaded Manager Shen to calm down, some questioned what evil fire Boss Zhu was venting today, some diverted the topic, each with a tongue blooming like a lotus. Only Gao Ju in the seat of honor sat motionless, saying nothing, only savoring the Limu Mountain Oolong tea in his hand. After a while, the scene cooled down. Looking at each other, everyone felt bored, so they learned from Gao Ju and stopped talking, only eating tea snacks and tasting tea. Occasionally someone said things like "This walnut crisp tastes familiar, must be from the Zhang Family Tea Food Shop outside Yongqing Street.", or "This Australian Oolong tea is stomach-nourishing, pairing with tea snacks doesn't feel overly sweet." But at most everyone echoed once or twice before it went cold again.

Gradually, clinking and clanking sounds came from behind. Manager Shen closed his eyes and pricked up his ears to listen to the force, either frowning or smiling and nodding. Everyone understood at a glance, this was about done. Sure enough, not long after, a running apprentice entered holding a lacquer tray, saying to everyone: "Reporting to the manager! Reporting to all proprietors! A one-tael-six-mace fine silk small ingot has cooled down, covered with red cloth; under the blue handkerchief is a fine silk ingot originally made in our shop." Gently placing it in front of Manager Shen, this little apprentice turned around and trotted, bringing an Australian kerosene lamp from the back. Including the one on the table, he placed them left and right in front of Manager Shen, transferred the fire, and dialed the wick to the brightest. Instantly, the hall radiated with light, just like daytime.

Everyone's eyes focused on Manager Shen in an instant, even Boss Zhu who inexplicably picked a fight just now was the same. The expert was about to make his move!

Manager Shen first took the hand cloth handed over to wipe his hands, then used a silk-woven hand bag to cover his left hand, before using his left hand to grab that newly cast fine silk small ingot. Everyone saw it and cursed secretly in their hearts: usually when asking you to look at silver fineness, never saw you wear gloves! Just in this moment of distraction, those who were distracted to spit at people didn't notice where Manager Shen conjured a small golden hammer from. This small golden hammer was also famous in the Guangzhou business world. It was the Shen family's ancestral treasure, made of pure gold, named the Golden Striker (*Jin Ji Zi*). Legend had it that it was blessed with secret methods; one knock on gold or silver, and it could tell the head of the Shen family exactly what the fineness of the gold or silver was. Looking again and again, knocking again and again, after comparing back and forth, Manager Shen put the Golden Striker into his bosom, sat upright, with a look of unfathomable depth.

Everyone looked at each other, not daring to speak. After a short while, it was Boss Zhu again who couldn't hold it back: "How is it exactly, Manager Shen, give us a word!" But what he got in exchange was a sideways glance from Manager Shen, lightly revealing a few words from between his teeth: "What's the panic!"

Boss Zhu wanted to flare up again, but the little apprentice happened to bring another tray. This time it was a pair of silver plaques, three inches long, two fingers wide, and one fen thick. Every family had seen these. As long as patterns and words were engraved, then polished, they would be the flower tokens indispensable to every family, used to authorize big and small affairs in the family. The two in front, however, were square and whole plates, without any carving. Manager Shen watched and knocked again, then collected them, sitting straight in the center, continuing to maintain an unfathomable appearance.

Afterward, things of different sizes and shapes came one after another in succession. All in pairs, one newly cast, one originally owned by the Shen family.

The last one to come up was Boss Shen's son. In the tray he held, besides two silver ingots the size of ten-tael official treasury silver, there were two thin sticks.

Boss Shen knocked again, then stood up and gave up his seat, letting his son sit down to start knocking and observing from the beginning. He himself ran behind the counter and took some things out. Everyone had little interest in knocking on silver ingots and silver plaques—they had just seen it once. Their eyes focused on Old Shen's hands. The one looking like a fish was a Silver Star steelyard (*dengzi* scales), able to weigh down to a few *fen* of a *qian*. The other one was in a box, not yet opened, but Gao Ju already understood. It must be a balance scale made by Westerners—the ones made by Australians were finer, he had one at home, usually enshrined as a treasure.

The father and son measured again, then solemnly put away various tools—Old Shen put the Golden Striker back into his bosom. Everyone's eyes focused on Old Shen again. Manager Shen brewed the atmosphere for a long time, opened his mouth and said a sentence: "Changxi, you speak first."

"Yes! Father!" Manager Shen's son was originally standing behind Manager Shen. After getting Manager Shen's words, he took a step forward. His originally bowing and scraping posture changed, instantly becoming dignified and imposing. The circle of people sitting saw it, quite a few nodding secretly: worthy of being the Little Shen Assayer preparing to take over Manager Shen's shift, the title of "Fiery Eyes and Golden Pupils Shen Gongbao" wasn't entirely based on hot air.
