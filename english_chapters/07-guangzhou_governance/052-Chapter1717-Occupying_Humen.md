# Chapter 1717 - Occupying Humen

The other officers he deemed unreliable were kept in the headquarters to "assist with military affairs"—effectively placing them under surveillance. He sent his own trusted men to take over their troops. After finishing these arrangements, he summoned Liu Zhipei, wanting to understand how the man had allowed the Da Guan soldiers to rush out of the barracks and cause such havoc.

Unexpectedly, it was not Liu Zhipei who came but one of his personal guards. Upon asking, he learned that his clan nephew had been killed the previous night.

"Squad Leader Liu ordered the brothers to assemble, but he didn't show up after more than an hour. We went to check and found him already dead!" the guard said. "We didn't know what to do. Later, someone sent a message saying that the Da Guan soldiers in the central army were rebelling and besieging the general, so everyone hurried over."

"Damn him, Ma Chengzu! So you had planned this all along!" Liu Fengsheng lamented the tragic death of his clan nephew. He realized that Ma Chengzu's call bringing in dozens of men meant he had prepared early. Today's events had been truly perilous.

On the river, more than a dozen Daihatsu landing craft were emitting black smoke, chugging past the single-masted sloops in front, heading toward Humen, Upper Hengdang Island, and other positions. The boats were loaded with soldiers of the Marine First Expeditionary Detachment.

Although the various forts and camps at Humen had already raised blue flags symbolizing surrender, the soldiers remained tense. Following their training, they crouched down, holding their percussion cap rifles with bayonets already fixed, ready to jump out and engage at any moment. The cannons on the single-masted sailing ships had their sights set, muzzles pointing directly at the targets, ready to fire.

The landing occurred without any fighting. The forts had originally held only a few garrison soldiers, mostly old and weak. These men didn't even have the keys to the fort's powder magazine; their daily duty was merely to guard the fort and report any suspicious activity on the river. As the fleet approached, no orders came from Humen Fortress, nor did anyone emerge to command resistance. Seeing the large group of "Hair-shorn Thieves" approaching, they scattered in an uproar before Liu Fengsheng's order to "stand by and do not resist" could reach them. When the Marines boarded the various forts, they were already empty.

Liu Fengsheng stood fully armored outside Humen Fortress, leading all the officers. Beside him were more than ten "elders" from Taiping Market. It was late winter turning to early spring, and the wind blowing from the river was quite chilly. Several thinly clad "elders" were already stomping their feet and blowing on their hands, unable to bear the cold.

In comparison, Liu Fengsheng's side looked quite orderly. However, compared to the completely numb "elders," the feelings of the surrendered generals were even more apprehensive. Regardless of one's view of honor and disgrace, betraying one's master to seek glory was always a dishonorable thing. Moreover, they worried about how the Australians would deal with them after the surrender, despite the many guarantees He Xin had made.

Watching the Australians in blue-gray uniforms constantly landing from the river, they felt increasingly worried.

While their hearts were beating like drums, an Australian soldier suddenly ran over quickly and asked, "Which one is the defender of Humen Fortress, Liu Fengsheng?"

Liu Fengsheng hurriedly responded, "This humble officer is he."

"Senator Shi Zhiqi summons you, the generals of Humen Fortress, and the gentry to meet him."

"Yes, this humble officer will go immediately."

It was Shi Zhiqi, the commander of the Marine First Expeditionary Detachment, who had landed at Humen. At this moment, he was arranging the defense and takeover operations of the Marine Corps in the yamen behind Anunghoy Fort. Xi Yazhou had requested that after occupying Humen, he should expand locally as soon as possible and firmly control this key to Guangzhou.

He had originally intended to enter Humen Fortress directly to set up a command post—there were many houses in the camp, making it a ready-made garrison. However, the staff member from the Urban Work Department who came to meet him reported that a fierce battle had taken place inside Humen Fortress. The yamen was now flowing with blood and hadn't been cleaned up yet. Shi Zhiqi had to abandon this idea and settle here for now.

He had already gained a rough understanding of the situation regarding the defenders and garrison in Humen Fortress from the Urban Work Department. He was not particularly interested in these old officers, but right now there was a shortage of manpower everywhere. These old soldiers, who had shown no mercy in killing their former comrades and had submitted a "petition of surrender" as a token of loyalty, could still be utilized temporarily.

Liu Fengsheng and his group entered the courtyard of the fort's yamen under the guidance of the guards. When they were still a rod's length away from the eaves, they hurriedly knelt down. A woman's voice came from inside: "The Chief has ordered that everyone need not kneel. Please come in, General Liu!"

Liu Fengsheng was stunned, thinking to himself: *Do the "Hair-shorn Thieves" bring women to war?* Then he suddenly realized his thoughts were "greatly disrespectful." They were not "thieves," nor even "Australians," but proper "Chiefs." Thinking of this, he hurriedly got up, took a few steps forward, and announced his name: "Humble General Liu Fengsheng pays respects to the Chief."

"No need for formalities. Come into the room."

Liu Fengsheng walked in and saw that the room had been tidied up very cleanly. There was only a large table in the center, and something hanging against the wall covered by a curtain. Two Australian guards stood on the left and right sides of the door, with short guns slung across their chests. The Australian Chief was a man in his thirties. At first glance, his clothes were no different from those of the guards. There was also a female soldier beside him.

He dared not look too much and hurriedly lowered his head, holding his breath and concentrating, waiting for questions.

"You are Liu Fengsheng?" Shi Zhiqi looked at the middle-aged man in full armor who stood respectfully before him. He had seen Liu Fengsheng's file: he came from a military background, joined the army at sixteen, accumulated merit to become a Thousand-Household, won more merit during the She-An Rebellion, obtained the rank of "Guerrilla General," and after spending money to maneuver for a few years, finally filled the position of Defender of Humen Fortress.

"Yes, this humble general is he."

Shi Zhiqi thought that it was not easy for him. Twenty years of military life, risking his life in battle and spending money to cultivate connections—he had finally climbed to this position with great difficulty. According to the materials, he didn't get a wife until he became a Thousand-Household in his thirties, and purchasing a residence in Guangzhou was something that had happened only in recent years. The materials said he was both greedy and stingy; no wonder the Urban Work Department hadn't spent much effort to persuade him to surrender.

"I heard that a fierce battle took place in your yamen today?"

"Yes." Liu Fengsheng immediately recounted what had happened that morning: how he had prepared to summon the generals to discuss surrendering to the Senate, how Gao Xidian and Ma Chengzu had launched an attack, and the fierce battle that had taken place in the central army headquarters.

"...Gao Xidian and Ma Chengzu were arrogant and rebellious, attempting to stop a chariot like a mantis, resisting the Heavenly Army. Today, these scoundrels have been completely exterminated! Their heads are displayed at the camp gate to demonstrate the might of the Great Song and the Senate..."

Shi Zhiqi nodded slightly. He knew of Ma Chengzu, and such fierce resistance was expected. However, he had no impression of who this Gao Xidian was. For these people to still rise up and resist in a completely hopeless situation showed that the Great Ming still had loyal ministers and righteous men.

However, he didn't dislike Liu Fengsheng. If there were loyal ministers and righteous men everywhere, the Senate wouldn't be able to make progress. In the final analysis, humans are animals that adapt to the general trend. As long as the Senate led the general trend well, those who understood the times would be the majority, and the world could be taken into the bag.

He nodded slightly and said, "Although they didn't understand the times, refused to submit to the King's transforming influence, and resisted stubbornly to the end, they were after all loyal ministers of the Zhu Ming. Don't display their heads anymore—bury them quickly along with their bodies. Set up a marker so their families can come to collect the bodies later."

Liu Fengsheng hurriedly said, "The Chief is benevolent..."

"I now appoint you as the Captain of the Provisional 1st Battalion of the Guangdong General Detachment of the National Army. Return to the camp now and handle the handover procedures with the people I've sent. You can rest assured—our promises are all valid. You may take all your personal property; for what you cannot take temporarily, I have already instructed the receiving personnel to arrange houses as temporary warehouses for you to store your private property."

Liu Fengsheng hurriedly knelt down to thank him. Shi Zhiqi frowned. "My Senate does not practice kneeling rituals. You can dispense with this in the future. After the handover, lead your troops to Hong Kong Island for reorganization and training. How specifically to proceed will be arranged. You just need to restrain your subordinates and wait quietly." He glanced at Liu Fengsheng again. "I know there are many bad habits and old rules among the officers and soldiers. Now that you have newly surrendered, I won't haggle with you, but the rule that you absolutely must not disturb the people must be remembered. If there is any act of disturbing the people, I will never show leniency!"

Liu Fengsheng hurriedly said, "The troops under this humble officer's command are all local natives, and there will absolutely be no disturbance of the people."

Shi Zhiqi nodded. "I trust you. Restrain your subordinates well and obey orders. There will surely be a great future. You may go."

For every sentence Shi Zhiqi said, Liu Fengsheng responded in kind. He didn't know how significant the position of Battalion Captain was, but he understood the part about going to Whampoa Island for training. Logically, whenever troops moved, there should be a starting fee. He had expected the Australians to issue a generous "grace reward," but Shi Zhiqi never mentioned it even when he said "You may go."

He couldn't help but feel disappointed. Everyone said the Australians were generous, but they were so stingy.

However, he dared not mention it, nor reveal disappointment in his expression. He bowed respectfully and retreated. Shi Zhiqi then received officers of various ranks above the level of Waiwei from outside Humen Fortress in batches, speaking comforting words.

The last to be received were the liaison officer and the gentry of Taiping Market. To them, the Australians were already old acquaintances. Every year, Taiping Market had to pay a "reasonable burden" to the Australians, so the arrival of the Australians this time did not cause panic. After Shi Zhiqi said a few polite words, he dismissed the gentry, leaving the liaison officer to ask about the food issue for the garrison.

According to the plan, the Marine Corps would leave a company here to guard Humen Fortress.

"Chief, don't worry. The town has already prepared everything," the liaison officer said respectfully. "Right now, there are thirty piculs of grain in the warehouse ready for use at any time."

"Your place is a key pass on the Pearl River. The Joint Logistics Headquarters will set up a supply station here. You must put in considerable effort." Shi Zhiqi saw the liaison officer's brows furrow tightly and smiled. "What? Afraid of being eaten out of house and home by us?"

"This small one dares not, dares not." The liaison officer was scared out of his wits and immediately knelt on the ground, kowtowing repeatedly.
