# Chapter 1979 - Brothers Reunited

Midday at the Purple Light Pavilion, signs of human activity were sparse. Under the newly built sedan and horse corridor eaves, the one-armed Spaniard, holding dual responsibilities of greeter and security, sat bored smoking a cigarette. Several idlers and children squatted nearby, curiously sizing up his beard and towering nose.

Business at this "Top Club" in Guangzhou city was mostly at night. During the day, except for guests coming to the first-floor large bathhouse to enjoy "water wrapping skin" in the morning, few customers patronized. The various large and small private rooms on the second and third floors were almost empty.

However, in this row of empty rooms, one private room on the second floor was filled with laughter and cheerful voices.

The exquisite private room wasn't large but decorated luxuriously. The walls were covered with silk wallpaper purchased from Hangzhou—a product of Wanbi Villa Silk Weaving Factory. Against the wall was a delicate curios shelf displaying various playthings. By other walls were wood-framed fabric sofas—filled with Hainan kapok, covered with custom imported Indian covers having special patterns and texture, not only beautiful but also soft and comfortable—this thing wasn't considered rare nowadays but was still an object pursued by many local rich households.

The private room had no windows. Above the purple sandalwood Impossible Eight Immortals Table in the center was a sixteen-branch ironwork crystal kerosene chandelier. The slightly yellow soft light projected into the room, creating a cozy, comfortable, and lazy atmosphere.

The Eight Immortals Table was already set with four fresh, four dry, and eight碟 fruit dishes, and a pot of hot tea.

Gathered in the private room were Li Ziyu's brotherhood. The host was Zhang Yu, currently riding on the crest of success, known as the "Guangzhou Young Domineering CEO."

At this moment, he had completely changed into an "Australian style" outfit. Not only did he have short hair and wear an "Australian front-opening jacket," even the wooden clogs on his feet were changed to rubber-soled cloth shoes often worn by Australian cadres, looking high-spirited.

Li Ziyu was the last to arrive. Being a private social engagement, wearing a police uniform was inconvenient, so he was also in a simple set of cotton "cadre clothes" today.

"Brother Yu, sit! Brothers are just waiting for you."

"Really sorry, everyone sit, sit, sit. A small matter at the bureau delayed me."

"You came back from training in Lingao; now you are a popular person in the bureau."

"Not at all, not at all..." Although Li Ziyu was modest, the smile on his face couldn't be suppressed.

The training in Lingao was like a dream—in a few months, he saw many things he hadn't seen, heard many things he didn't know. It was as if he originally stood outside a garden gate, only able to guess the splendid fragrance inside from flower branches extending over the wall, but now the gate opened wide for him, letting him tour inside.

New knowledge, new atmosphere, new concepts flooded into this young man's mind like a tide, making him feel he had lived a lifetime in an instant.

Returning from Lingao training, although not officially promoted yet, internal news had spread that Li Ziyu would soon "go down to grassroots" to serve as Deputy Director of a police station in the city.

He had studied in Lingao and knew this police station was a grassroots unit of the Senate police system. Serving as Deputy Director meant he formally stepped into the ranks of "Police Officers," not just a "Constable."

He looked at everyone smilingly. When his gaze swept to the guest seat, he couldn't help shouting:

"Shixin! You finally came back!"

The Chen Shixin before him was also in "Australian dress." Because they hadn't seen each other for about a year or more, his attire and appearance had changed, bringing a sense of陌生 unfamiliarity within familiarity.

"Ah Yu!" Chen Shixin couldn't suppress his excitement and actually bowed respectfully. "Little brother pays respects!"

"Aye, aye, don't be like this! We are all Senate people now; must perform Australian etiquette!"

"Yes, yes, you are right." Chen Shixin hurriedly extended his hand. Two pairs of hands held tightly together, not separating for a long time. There were thousands of words in their chests, yet they didn't know where to start.

"Sit! Sit!" Zhang Yu hurriedly greeted, "It's not like you haven't met for ages. Shixin only went to Lingao for over a year."

"Indeed, only over a year's time," Chen Shixin nodded, "but coming back to look, it truly changed the world!"

The four brothers had been together since skipping class at community school. Back then, they just liked Australian stuff and played together, not thinking about other things. But the world is unpredictable; no one expected each would experience so much. Zhang Yu made his fortune knowing Senator Hong through Chen Shixin's connection; Li Ziyu lost family but found a job in the Police Bureau, even helping Zeng Juan find his sold niece, and rose rapidly relying on this matter and the implicated Mao Family Case; thanks to the two brothers' care, Zeng Juan also passed the exam into the Finance and Tax Bureau after idling for half a year—Zhang Yu's set of review materials helped him greatly.

Recalling those years, the four couldn't help laughing loudly, feeling the unpredictability of worldly affairs. However, these fluctuating experiences made their hearts stick closer, feeling the preciousness of original friendship even more.

This gathering was actually a "reception dinner" for Chen Shixin returning from Lingao.

Chen Shixin returning this time was no longer the ambiguous identity of "student recommended by Senator Hong." He attended the Art Vocational Training Class in Lingao and was assigned to the Guangzhou Propaganda Department as a formal staff member of the Literature and Propaganda system this time.

"That, Ah Yu, you're quite something." Li Ziyu sized up the room. "I heard from Ah Juan you booked this place? Got eyes, this is a soundproof room, right."

"Soundproof room?" The other few were stunned. But this private room was indeed a bit different—it had no windows.

Although Purple Light Pavilion private rooms emphasized "privacy" most, and various circulation settings fully considered "guest privacy," private rooms usually had windows for ventilation and light.

"Ah Yu, you are indeed knowledgeable. Heard this was learned from Lingao, all made by Chiefs. I don't understand either; anyway, heard Miss Pei say even if screaming inside, outside can't hear a bit. I tried; it's true. There are only three in the whole Purple Light Pavilion. Now people with a bit of status like to choose here to discuss matters. You didn't see it when studying in Lingao?"

"Seen..." Li Ziyu thought I only saw it when visiting certain places, and not good places either, so he waved his hand. "I only heard of it; this is the first time seeing it."

"Look, among us, Master Zhang—no, according to Australian calling, CEO Zhang—is the one qualifying as having status."

"Go aside, Ah Juan, you tax dog. Ah Yu, shouldn't you punish yourself with a cup first."

"Good, you call me tax dog; tomorrow I'll apply to specifically investigate you, this dog big household!"

"Haha..." The four laughed.

Zhang Yu stopped bickering with Li Ziyu, turned to fill Chen Shixin's wine glass, and said: "You went to Lingao for so long, not even a letter! We won't fuss about this fault, but tell us what you saw and heard!"

Chen Shixin laughed: "If talking about observations in Lingao, Ah Yu probably said them long ago. I won't say more to show my incompetence. Just talk about my own experiences."

Chen Shixin went to Lingao with a recommendation letter, inevitably underwent a "purification," then entered the Fangshaodi Art Training Class.

The teacher base of this art training class was the dozen apprentices brought out by the Italian Trini in the past. Of course, Trini himself also came to teach—but his business volume kept rising, so he hardly came once a month.

"Those gentlemen are actually about my age, but every one has a unique skill. What I thought back then was truly too simple..." He talked non-stop about how he learned sketching, color, writing artistic characters, making structural models with cardboard, playing with mud to make sculptures... occasionally following teachers to "arrange venues" everywhere.

Although Chen Shixin entered the Art Class, actually the class's teaching direction leaned towards practical arts. Students not only had to master basic painting skills but also learn some arts and crafts skills, including making sculptures, exhibition arrangement, display, interior decoration, printmaking, drawing propaganda posters, etc. Some also went to learn ironwork and glass skills. In short, the content learned was very miscellaneous. Opportunities for practice were also plentiful—basically learning while doing.

However, these miscellaneous skills suited Chen Shixin's taste. He was originally a curious person with considerable hands-on ability, truly feeling like a fish in water with these skills.

"When we were together before, we always said Australians were 'knowledgeable and retentive,' with incredibly great learning. But truly contacting their learning, it's simply like the ocean—boundless," Chen Shixin gestured. "Take this painting; various techniques, various styles, as long as you want to learn, simply endless, can't finish learning in a lifetime... When I was in Guangzhou before, I always felt I had read books and seen many Australian magazines, having some knowledge. Never thought upon arriving in Lingao, I felt I was a person sitting in a well looking at the sky—that bit of learning, let alone Australian skin and hair, doesn't even count as a dust mote."

"Shixin speaks true!" Zhang Yu also sighed with emotion, about to say something, when suddenly the small bell in the private room rang. He got up to open the door; it was the waiter delivering wine and dishes.

Wine and dishes in Purple Light Pavilion were pushed in by dining cart. Purple Light Pavilion's wine and dishes were very exquisite, all "Australian Cuisine," naturally priced not cheap either. For the few "eating fiscal rice" present, spending a month's salary wasn't enough. Fortunately, there was Zhang Yu, this financier.

"Come, this is Roasted Goose made by Purple Light Pavilion—said to be Guangzhou's best. Everyone eat while hot." Zhang Yu greeted.

"Wait!" Li Ziyu stood up raising his wine glass. "First everyone drink a cup together, congratulating Shixin's return to Guangzhou."

The wine was "Xue Ziliang" brand fruit wine from Lingao, wine color dark red, taste clear and sweet, neither easy to get drunk nor easy to get a headache, so quite liked by gluttons fond of long banquets. Price naturally wasn't cheap.

"Wish Shixin success upon taking office!" Everyone raised glasses together. "Cheers!"
