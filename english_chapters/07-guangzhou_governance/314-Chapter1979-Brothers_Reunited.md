# Chapter 1979 - Brothers Reunited

Midday at the Purple Light Pavilion revealed sparse signs of activity. Beneath the newly constructed sedan and horse corridor eaves, the one-armed Spaniard—holding dual responsibilities as greeter and security—sat smoking a cigarette with evident boredom. Several idlers and children squatted nearby, curiously examining his beard and prominent nose.

Business at this "premier establishment" in Guangzhou concentrated at night. During daylight hours, except for guests visiting the first-floor grand bathhouse to enjoy "water wrapping skin" in the morning, few customers patronized. The various large and small private rooms on the second and third floors stood almost entirely vacant.

However, within this row of empty chambers, one second-floor private room brimmed with laughter and cheerful voices.

The refined private room wasn't spacious but was decorated lavishly. The walls bore silk wallpaper purchased from Hangzhou—a product of Wanbi Villa Silk Weaving Factory. Against one wall stood a delicate curios shelf displaying various ornamental pieces. Other walls featured wood-framed fabric sofas—filled with Hainan kapok, covered with custom imported Indian covers possessing distinctive patterns and texture, not merely beautiful but also soft and comfortable. This item wasn't considered rare nowadays but remained an object pursued by many local wealthy households.

The private room lacked windows. Above the purple sandalwood Impossible Eight Immortals Table in the center hung a sixteen-branch wrought iron crystal kerosene chandelier. The faintly yellow soft light projected into the room, cultivating a cozy, comfortable, and languid atmosphere.

The Eight Immortals Table was already arrayed with four fresh dishes, four dried, and eight small plates of fruit, plus a pot of hot tea.

Assembled in the private room was Li Ziyu's brotherhood. The host was Zhang Yu, currently riding the crest of success, known as the "Guangzhou Young Domineering CEO."

At this moment, he'd transformed completely into "Australian style" attire. Not only sporting short hair and wearing an "Australian front-opening jacket," even the wooden clogs on his feet had been exchanged for rubber-soled cloth shoes commonly worn by Australian cadres. He appeared high-spirited.

Li Ziyu arrived last. Being a private social engagement, wearing his police uniform would be inappropriate, so he too donned a simple set of cotton "cadre clothes" today.

"Brother Yu, sit! We brothers have just been awaiting you."

"Truly sorry. Everyone sit, sit, sit. A minor matter at the bureau detained me."

"You returned from training in Lingao—now you're a popular figure at the bureau."

"Not at all, not at all..." Though Li Ziyu affected modesty, the smile illuminating his face couldn't be suppressed.

The Lingao training had been dreamlike—in several months, he'd witnessed things never seen, heard things never known. It was as though he'd originally stood outside a garden gate, capable only of guessing the splendid fragrance within from flower branches extending over the wall, but now the gate had swung wide, permitting him to tour inside.

New knowledge, new atmospheres, new concepts had flooded into this young man's mind like a tide, making him feel he'd lived an entire lifetime in an instant.

Returning from Lingao training, though not yet officially promoted, internal news had circulated that Li Ziyu would soon "descend to the grassroots" to serve as Deputy Director of a municipal police station.

Having studied in Lingao, he understood this police station was a grassroots unit of the Senate police system. Serving as Deputy Director meant formally stepping into "Police Officer" ranks, no longer merely a "Constable."

He regarded everyone with a smile. When his gaze swept to the guest seat, he couldn't restrain an exclamation:

"Shixin! You've finally returned!"

The Chen Shixin before him was also in "Australian dress." Because they hadn't seen each other for approximately a year or more, his attire and appearance had transformed, bringing a sense of strangeness within familiarity.

"Ah Yu!" Chen Shixin couldn't suppress his excitement and actually bowed respectfully. "Little brother pays respects!"

"Hey, hey, don't do that! We're all Senate people now—we must perform Australian etiquette!"

"Yes, yes, you're absolutely right." Chen Shixin hurriedly extended his hand. Two pairs of hands clasped tightly together, not separating for an extended moment. Thousands of words swelled in their chests, yet they didn't know where to commence.

"Sit! Sit!" Zhang Yu hastily urged. "It's not as though you haven't met in ages. Shixin only went to Lingao for just over a year."

"Indeed, only a year's duration," Chen Shixin nodded, "but returning to look, the world has genuinely transformed!"

The four brothers had bonded since skipping classes at community school. Back then, they'd simply enjoyed Australian products and played together, not contemplating deeper implications. But the world is unpredictable. No one anticipated each would experience so much. Zhang Yu had made his fortune knowing Senator Hong through Chen Shixin's connection. Li Ziyu had lost family but secured employment in the Police Bureau, even helping Zeng Juan locate his sold niece, and had risen rapidly leveraging this matter and the implicated Mao Family Case. Thanks to both brothers' patronage, Zeng Juan had also passed examinations into the Finance and Tax Bureau after idling half a year—Zhang Yu's set of review materials had aided him substantially.

Recalling those years, the four couldn't restrain boisterous laughter, marveling at the unpredictability of worldly affairs. However, these turbulent experiences had bonded their hearts closer, making them treasure their original friendship even more profoundly.

This gathering was essentially a "welcome home dinner" for Chen Shixin's return from Lingao.

Chen Shixin's return this time carried none of his previous ambiguous status as "student recommended by Senator Hong." Having attended the Art Vocational Training Class in Lingao, he'd been assigned to the Guangzhou Propaganda Department as formal staff within the Literature and Propaganda system.

"So, Ah Yu, you're quite the operator." Li Ziyu surveyed the room. "I heard from Ah Juan you reserved this place? Discerning choice—this is a soundproof room, correct?"

"Soundproof room?" The others appeared startled. But this private room was indeed somewhat distinctive—it lacked windows.

Though Purple Light Pavilion private rooms emphasized "privacy" above all, and various circulation arrangements fully considered "guest discretion," private rooms typically possessed windows for ventilation and illumination.

"Ah Yu, you're truly knowledgeable. I heard this was learned from Lingao, all designed by Chiefs. I don't comprehend it either. Anyway, I heard Miss Pei say even if one screams inside, nothing can be heard outside. I tested it—absolutely true. There are only three in the entire Purple Light Pavilion. Nowadays people with any status prefer selecting here to discuss matters. Didn't you observe this while studying in Lingao?"

"Seen..." Li Ziyu reflected that he'd only observed it when visiting certain establishments, and not reputable ones either, so he waved dismissively. "I'd only heard of it. This is my first time experiencing it."

"Look—among us, Master Zhang—no, according to Australian parlance, CEO Zhang—is the one qualifying as possessing status."

"Get lost, Ah Juan, you tax hound. Ah Yu, shouldn't you penalize yourself with a drink first?"

"Fine, you call me tax hound? Tomorrow I'll apply to specifically audit you, this nouveau riche household!"

"Haha..." The four laughed together.

Zhang Yu ceased bantering with Li Ziyu, turned to fill Chen Shixin's wine glass, and said, "You departed for Lingao so long without sending a single letter! We won't belabor this fault, but recount what you witnessed and experienced!"

Chen Shixin laughed. "If discussing observations in Lingao, Ah Yu has probably articulated them long since. I won't elaborate further and reveal my inadequacy. I'll merely discuss my personal experiences."

Chen Shixin had departed for Lingao bearing a recommendation letter, inevitably underwent "rectification," then entered the Fangshaodi Art Training Class.

The instructor base of this art training class consisted of the dozen apprentices cultivated by the Italian Trini previously. Naturally, Trini himself also taught—but his business volume kept escalating, so he scarcely appeared once monthly.

"Those instructors are actually approximately my age, yet every single one possesses specialized expertise. What I'd imagined back then was genuinely too simplistic..." He spoke continuously about learning sketching, color theory, writing artistic characters, constructing structural models with cardboard, molding clay sculptures... occasionally accompanying teachers to "arrange venues" everywhere.

Though Chen Shixin had entered the Art Class, the curriculum's pedagogical direction actually leaned toward practical arts. Students not only had to master fundamental painting skills but also acquire various arts and crafts competencies, including sculpture fabrication, exhibition arrangement, display techniques, interior decoration, printmaking, drawing propaganda posters, and so forth. Some even studied metalwork and glass skills. In summary, the content studied was extraordinarily diverse. Opportunities for practice proved equally abundant—essentially learning while executing.

However, these miscellaneous skills suited Chen Shixin's temperament perfectly. He'd originally been a curious person with considerable manual dexterity, genuinely feeling like a fish in water with these competencies.

"When we gathered previously, we perpetually declared Australians were 'knowledgeable and retentive,' possessing incredibly vast learning. But genuinely engaging their scholarship, it's simply oceanic—boundless." Chen Shixin gestured expansively. "Take painting alone—various techniques, various styles. As long as you desire to learn, it's simply infinite, impossible to exhaust in a lifetime... When I resided in Guangzhou previously, I'd always felt I'd read books and examined numerous Australian magazines, possessing some knowledge. Never imagined that upon arriving in Lingao, I'd realize I was a person sitting in a well observing the sky—that morsel of learning doesn't even constitute Australian skin and hair, doesn't even qualify as a dust particle."

"Shixin speaks truthfully!" Zhang Yu also sighed emotionally, about to elaborate, when suddenly the small bell in the private room chimed. He rose to open the door—the waiter delivering wine and dishes.

Wine and dishes at Purple Light Pavilion were transported via dining cart. The establishment's cuisine was extraordinarily refined, all "Australian Cuisine," naturally priced accordingly steep. For the several "eating public grain" present, expending a month's salary wouldn't suffice. Fortunately, Zhang Yu, the financier, was present.

"Come, this is Roasted Goose prepared by Purple Light Pavilion—reputedly Guangzhou's finest. Everyone partake while hot." Zhang Yu urged.

"Wait!" Li Ziyu stood raising his wine glass. "First everyone drink together, congratulating Shixin's return to Guangzhou."

The wine was "Xue Ziliang" brand fruit wine from Lingao, wine color deep crimson, taste clear and sweet, neither inducing intoxication readily nor producing headaches, thus quite favored by gluttons fond of prolonged banquets. Price naturally wasn't modest.

"May Shixin succeed spectacularly upon assuming office!" Everyone raised glasses together. "Cheers!"
