# Chapter 1726: Lü Yizhong

"I won't see her." Liu Xiang thought she was probably just coming to beg for mercy and grace. He didn't have time for such small matters right now. "Tell her that we will properly encoffin her family's bodies. Have them settle at the Examination Hall first. When the time is right, we will naturally let them return to their hometown."

Liu Xiang spoke a few more words with the surrendered persons and comforted them. He also instructed the clerks and runners of each department to "come for roll call and continue working as usual." After dismissing them, he then said to Wei Bifu: "Old brother, you have turned from darkness to light. Our Senate will naturally not treat you unfairly. I now appoint you as Advisor to the Guangzhou Military Control Commission. Come to work tomorrow—only, I must trouble old brother and your family to stay at Guangxiao Temple for a few days first."

Wei Bifu hurriedly stood up and said: "Your Excellency's words are too kind. This humble official will definitely serve the Great Song with all my might, and work as hard as a dog or horse for Your Excellency."

"Alright, alright. You needn't use this 'Your Excellency' and 'humble official' routine anymore."

"Yes, yes, I respectfully follow your esteemed command."

Wei Bifu withdrew with utmost respect. Only Liu Xiang was left alone in the private office. Just as he was about to go out to see if the moving team had arrived, his new personal secretary, Guo Xi'er, walked in.

Guo Xi'er was a younger cousin of Guo Ling'er from a collateral branch of the family. Her family was taken in to Hainan together with Guo Ling'er's family back then. Guo Ling'er entered the Maid School, while Guo Xi'er, being too young, entered Meadow School. Her grades were not very good, at the bottom tier. Last year, after graduating from lower elementary, she became a clerk at some agency.

Just then, her cousin was pregnant and giving birth. Seeing the female clerks eyeing Liu Xiang covetously one by one, Guo Ling'er, to secure her position, noticed that her own little sister had also grown up gracefully and received "new-style education," so she got an idea—you need your father and brothers in battle, and in the boudoir, you also need sisterly solidarity. So, taking advantage of the fact that she had "made contributions" by giving birth to a daughter and Liu Xiang's ear was soft but another part hard, she blew pillow talk for months and managed to get her little sister into Liu Xiang's bed—of course, it was registered in the Administrative Office under the title of "personal secretary." Her name was also changed to "Guo Xi'er," with her age written as sixteen—though she was actually only fifteen. Guo Ling'er, afraid of things getting complicated, substituted nominal age for actual age. Liu Xiang, though somewhat aware later, just muddled along and accepted it—compared to her elder sister, Guo Xi'er was much more lively—after all, she had received a new-style education from childhood.

"Chief," Guo Xi'er, having only recently become a personal secretary, was still a bit shy around her master. "A lord from the Ming country is here to visit. This is his card."

Liu Xiang thought to himself, if this were an ordinary Great Ming gentleman rushing to curry favor, there would be no need to see him right away. However, taking the card and looking at it, the visitor was Lü Yizhong. This former secretary to Wang Zunde, who had been captured during the Chengmai Campaign, had been sent back to Guangzhou to serve as a "personal secretary" to Guo Yi after his surrender. He was considered a "Leading Party" of long standing. Liu Xiang had already spoken to the External Intelligence Bureau, which was responsible for managing him, about transferring him to the new Guangzhou Military Control Commission team for employment. Since he was so sensible as to come visiting, naturally he should be seen.

"Please show him in immediately."

Since the Pearl River Campaign, Lü Yizhong had been sent back to Guangzhou, nominally as Guo Yi's "Scribe," but actually serving as a communication channel between Guo Yi and the gentry and officialdom of Guangzhou. Though despised by the scholars and gentry, with the Australians as his backing, all the officials and gentry in the city humored him and didn't dare offend him. Only a few hot-headed young scholars had publicly insulted him and even wanted to give him a good beating. But after these young men all inexplicably "committed suicide" by drowning or hanging, no one mentioned Lü Yizhong's past anymore. He moved among the gentry and officialdom with increasing ease—some things Guo Yi couldn't say or do were all handled by him. He became quite a significant figure in the Guangzhou Station and even the entire city of Guangzhou, and had made some money. As the Senate's momentum grew, Lü Yizhong no longer felt ashamed of his betrayal and seeking glory from his enemies. He even felt somewhat "blessed by misfortune."

However, now he was both joyful and anxious. Joyful that the King's Army of the Senate had landed, and competing for the Central Plains seemed just around the corner. He himself would be a veteran minister who followed the dragon north. Anxious because Guo Yi unexpectedly was not the newly appointed Guangzhou Prefect, but was reassigned back to Lingao for "other important duties." In Lü Yizhong's eyes as a veteran bureaucratic insider, this was a sign that "Shopkeeper Guo" was falling out of favor. Linking this to the fact that the Senate's "Chairman Wen" had suddenly become "Guangdong Commissioner" while a Senator surnamed Wang became "Chairman," Lü Yizhong naturally thought that this must mean Chancellor Wen had fallen and was "sent out to be a Regional Governor." Guo Yi being suddenly dismissed at this juncture was obviously because he was Chancellor Wen's man, and he himself was naturally "Shopkeeper Guo's man"—this could be quite bad.

As the saying goes, a new day brings new ministers. With Guo Yi removed from office, the new "Chief" would naturally appoint his own team. A week ago, he had received notice that a large group of "Northward Expedition Cadres" would be coming to Guangzhou. This made him anxious—compared to the subordinates the Chiefs cultivated themselves, he, a "surrendered person" by origin, was already at a disadvantage, let alone being "one of Guo Yi's people"—simply designated for the cold bench. And if Shopkeeper Guo was further investigated for some "fabricated charge" after returning, and he himself was labeled an "accomplice" and thrown into the "Imperial Prison" of the Great Song, that would be very bad indeed. So he had started early on to seek connections and find a backer—the newly appointed Prefect of the Great Song's Guangzhou was naturally the most suitable candidate.

A few days ago, he had received notice that the Military Control Commission had indeed confirmed his transfer to serve there. Lü Yizhong was overjoyed. Today, hearing that Chief Liu had already entered the city, he didn't wait for Liu Xiang to summon him but came visiting on his own.

Lü Yizhong had originally wondered whether he should shave his head and change his clothes before visiting—now that Guangzhou had been "recovered," Guo Yi and his colleagues had all shaved their heads and changed clothes. As a "guest minister" of the Senate, he should also make a gesture. But he thought about it and decided that since he hadn't been notified to shave his head and change clothes, it wouldn't be appropriate to act on his own initiative. Besides, he didn't know how Chief Liu intended to employ him, so it was better to go as he was.

Lü Yizhong came in, paid his respects. Liu Xiang knew about this man. Though he was employed by the Senate, he didn't really count as a proper "naturalized citizen." He was a "gray figure" in the Senate's personnel system, of the same nature as Sun Kecheng, the chief manager of the Qiwei Escort Agency. He was a very useful assistant for the Senate in interfacing with traditional society. For such people, the Senate's policy was "fully employ, but don't fully trust." So Liu Xiang was very polite to him, saying a few reassuring words, telling him to "work in peace, no need for concerns." He also said that Guo Yi's departure from office was for "other important duties," hinting that he shouldn't worry about his future.

Lü Yizhong felt slightly more at ease and couldn't help but feel grateful. He proceeded to say how he was "wholeheartedly loyal" to the Senate and was willing to "dedicate himself completely" to the Senate's great cause. He also expressed his willingness to be a "vanguard and running dog" for Liu Xiang and "serve with all his might."

With those words, he took out a sandalwood box from his bosom and said in a slightly mysterious, lowered voice: "This is a small gift from this humble official to the Chief. Just a token of esteem!"

Liu Xiang waved his hand: "You know our rules. Why are you doing this? I know your situation. Rest assured."

Lü Yizhong smiled broadly and said: "This humble official understands the Senate's disciplines and wouldn't dare offend. This is not something valuable, just a small trinket. Though curious, it's not a valuable item."

Liu Xiang's curiosity was piqued. Taking the box and opening it, he saw it contained a pair of silver spheres, only as big as walnuts. They were intricately carved with openwork patterns. Shaking them gently, there was a faint tinkling sound. Though made of silver, they were very light to the hand—at most just a few qian of silver. They were indeed not a valuable item. He just didn't know what they were used for.

"These are called Burmese Bells. Reportedly they came from Burma. This pair was made by an old, established shop in Guangzhou. The bell tongues inside are made of the finest pearls. They are the most exquisite—a wonderful item for the boudoir..."

Liu Xiang had originally been puzzled about what these things were for. Now, with his explanation, he understood. It turned out these were Ming Dynasty "sex toys." He was both amused and exasperated, and could only say: "Much obliged, much obliged."

Lü Yizhong saw his expression was indifferent and knew he still didn't know the "wonderful uses" of this object. He continued:

"For pleasures in the bedchamber, this object has the wonderful effect of helping to conceive a son." He lowered his head. "This humble official has heard that the Chief's knee is still empty. May the Chief soon have a son to continue the ancestral line..."

"Thank you for your kind words." Liu Xiang put the box away and set it aside. He didn't really care about this gift, nor did he care much about having a son. But he quite enjoyed Lü Yizhong's flattery. Even though he knew clearly that Lü Yizhong was shamelessly bootlicking, it still felt so good...

"Old Lü," his words unconsciously carried three parts more intimacy. "You don't need to play these games. Let's talk business first. If I were a Ming Prefect, coming here to take office, what should I do to make this prefecture enjoy favorable weather, abundant produce, and prosperous people?"

Hearing this, Lü Yizhong knew this was soliciting his advice. He immediately rallied his spirits and thought before saying: "The easiest thing in the world to do is being an official, and the hardest thing is also being an official. It all depends on the official's intentions and luck. If you want to keep it simple, just employ two capable personal secretaries for legal and financial affairs, maintain good relations with the clerks of the three classes and six departments, be harmonious with the gentry, show three parts of conscience in legal cases and lawsuits. After three years in office, you can retire smoothly with at least a middling evaluation, and still pocket a few tens of thousands of liang for yourself."

"What if you want to accomplish something?"

"Then it depends on the official's skill and ability." Lü Yizhong had himself been a Prefect, and had tasted all the flavors of the job. He spoke clearly and logically: "A local official may be called the Lord of a Hundred Li, with the power to ruin families and destroy clans, but in the end, he is still an outsider, a powerful dragon from afar. To accomplish anything is truly not easy. Building bridges and roads, constructing irrigation, reforming abuses... these are all good deeds. Yet whenever one benefit is raised, one other benefit is damaged. Some gain advantage, while others lose. The difficulties therein are truly unspeakable. Only a strong-willed official with skill can maintain control. But no matter how great your ability, some people still cannot be offended. Matters involving them must be handled with utmost caution."

"Oh? Who are they?"

"First, the clerks. They are most treacherous, yet local administration is entirely in their hands. If they act slyly and cunningly, at the least they can embarrass you; at worst, you'll be dismissed, removed from office, or even lose your life—none of that is uncommon. So no matter how capable a local official is, he must humor them, at least to ensure they don't trick him."

"Second, it's the gentry, isn't it?"

"The Chief speaks truly." Lü Yizhong nodded. "As they say, 'In governance, don't offend the great families.' All gentry have connections in the province and at court, and they also have great influence locally. To govern a prefecture or county peacefully, you cannot offend them. To accomplish anything, you need to be on even better terms with them."

Local officials actually had very limited funds and grain at their disposal. To accomplish anything practical invariably required the generous donations of local gentry. Even if they don't donate, at least they shouldn't obstruct. That itself wasn't easy. There were certainly gentry keen on public welfare, but there were also plenty of "bad gentry" who used their status to harm the locality.

Seeing Liu Xiang listening carefully, Lü Yizhong recounted many things he had seen and heard while serving as an official and personal secretary. The many tricks and deep intricacies left Liu Xiang amazed: the learning in being an official was truly profound.

Fortunately, he himself was an official of the Senate. If he had been a single-crossing official of the Great Ming, he probably wouldn't have been able to handle it at all.

Lü Yizhong said: "...The Chief is implementing the new policies of the Senate and naturally has plans for sweeping away the old and establishing the new. This humble official's shallow views are probably useless...

Liu Xiang smiled: "You speak wrongly. Without your explanations, how would I know who are the tigers in this Guangzhou Prefecture?" He thought for a moment and continued: "But there are priorities. We just entered the city, and there's so much to do from scratch. I don't know where to start."

Lü Yizhong smiled ingratiatingly: "The Chief surely has strategies already in mind. But in this humble official's view, governance depends most on the art of the 'administration of clerks.' Only when the clerks are properly managed can you command as easily as using your own arm. Right now, the Heavenly Army has just recovered Guangzhou, carrying the prestige of victorious campaigns. The gentry families all have homes and businesses and won't openly oppose the Heavenly Army at this juncture. The Chief's governance at this time will surely find them accepting whatever comes. But these clerks, having controlled the locality for years and relying on their family-transmitted secrets, consider manipulating the government their specialty. The Chief must be on guard against them."

These words contained his own private motives. Lü Yizhong was himself a Juren who had served as Prefect. He had a natural aversion to the clerk class, which seemed docile but was actually insidious and cunning, and would sometimes even bite back. Toward his gentry peers, he naturally had a protective inclination.

Liu Xiang thought this made sense. The gentry had great influence, but at this current stage, they wouldn't jump out to oppose the Senate. It was the clerks—they were the people who directly handled grassroots affairs and faced the commoners. His work in Guangzhou required their assistance, and if mismanaged, it would not only damage the Senate's interests but also harm the credibility of the new government in Guangzhou.

But he didn't want to discuss the handling of clerks too deeply in front of Lü Yizhong. He asked: "I wonder, in this Guangzhou city, which families are the prominent great families?"
