# Chapter 1832 - Suspension for Rectification

Today she had been silently practicing Pipa tunes in her room. He Xiaoyue never had any talent or aptitude for the four arts (zither, go, calligraphy, painting). Although her maiden family was wealthy, girls were not valued at home; knowing a few characters was considered having a proper upbringing. Now learning from scratch was harder than for the younger Pipa Zai. Because she kept making mistakes in fingering, Mu Yun's expression had been very unpleasant.

He Xiaoyue had been beaten into fear by Sister Yao and dared not slack off. Although Miss Mu Yun didn't hold a bamboo board or rattan cane, He Xiaoyue knew she was meat on the chopping block—they could prepare her however they wished.

Midway through practice, a cleaning maid suddenly came over. Without explanation, she took He Xiaoyue out, through the passageway, directly out the back, and onto this pleasure boat. They bound her hands and feet, threw her onto the bed in the cabin, stuffed a rag in her mouth, and warned: "Don't talk nonsense or move around. Someone will attend to you in a while!"

She was terrified. Listening to the idle chatter of the maids, fierce servants (beans-and-water), and prostitutes these past days, she heard that the brothel sometimes sold "has-been" prostitutes with poor business or advanced age to foreign merchants or water-based brothels. If the prostitute was unwilling to go, they would simply bind her and send her onto the boat. Did the brothel feel she was "rotten wood that couldn't be carved" and decided to sell her for money?

Selling to a foreign merchant as a concubine could be considered "returning to virtue" (leaving prostitution). For He Xiaoyue, it should be a blessing. However, He Xiaoyue didn't think so. Foreign merchants came from all over. Once sold, it meant never returning to her hometown. Furthermore, those who bought "has-been" prostitutes cheaply from brothels were mostly mid-level traveling merchants. These merchants mostly came from remote areas with average financial conditions. Moreover, there was usually a First Wife running the household. Buying a prostitute home naturally wouldn't lead to a life of luxury; it was equivalent to buying a servant for the family. Also, men traveled for business for years at a time, leaving the household managed by the First Wife. If the First Wife was kind, one could survive. If the First Wife was fierce, the concubine would be driven to labor like a slave, and within a few years would die from overwork and abuse.

Worse yet, if sold to a water-based brothel, it would be miserable beyond words.

So the thought of being resold struck her like a thunderbolt, just like when she learned she was sold to the brothel.

He Xiaoyue struggled up from the bed. Fortunately, the ropes only bound her hands and feet separately, not Hog-tied to immobility. She managed to shift from the bed to the floor, and leaning against chairs and tables, inched little by little to the window.

Although she didn't know this pleasure boat belonged to Fangchun Court, judging by the cabin furnishings, it must be owned by a wealthy family. Her fear grew—were they really selling her to a water-based brothel?

The windows of this pleasure boat weren't fully inlaid with Australian glass. Although glass was transparent, it was inconveniently too transparent for those engaging in "flower boat" activities. Thus, the windows were uniquely designed: surrounding frames of fine wood lattice pasted with colored soft gauze, with only a lotus-shaped window pane in the center inlaid with glass.

This allowed light and viewing while preventing "spring scenery" inside the cabin from leaking out.

He Xiaoyue managed to stand up leaning against a small table. Peering out through the glass pane, she saw a river jetty outside, where many pleasure boats and flower skiffs seemed to be moored.

Amidst her terrified hesitation, she suddenly heard people talking. Glancing sideways, she saw a young man with short "Kun" hair in black clothes talking to someone—the person he was talking to she recognized: it was Sister Yao.

She had seen this young man on the streets of Guangzhou. He was called a "Policeman," similar to the former bailiffs and yamen runners. After escaping the Hall of Chastity and being placed in the Benevolence Hall, He Xiaoyue had seen the "Policemen's" style. She knew their reputation was good, far superior to the old bailiffs.

*What is a policeman doing here?* He Xiaoyue was puzzled. She saw the policeman seemed to be reprimanding Sister Yao, while Sister Yao blocked the gangplank at the bow, seemingly preventing the policeman from boarding.

He Xiaoyue shivered—*This policeman wants to board the boat!*

Although she didn't know why, if a policeman wanted to board, there must be a case. She wanted to cry for help but feared the police and brothel were in cahoots, leading to more beatings and abuse... Hesitating, she suddenly thought: If they were truly in cahoots, why would Sister Yao desperately block him? Clearly, there was a secret on this boat the brothel couldn't let the police know!

Thinking of this, she felt certain. However, her mouth was stuffed with cloth; she couldn't speak to cry for help. She knew if she didn't make a sound now, she would never have the chance.

But the cloth was stuffed extremely tight; her tongue couldn't push it out. He Xiaoyue looked around. There was nothing in the room to help. Fearing the policeman wouldn't board and she'd lose her last chance, she steeled her heart, managed to seat herself on the table, pulled up her legs, closed her eyes, and kicked hard at the glass window pane regardless of consequences!

Li Ziyu was tangling with Sister Yao. Seeing her making every excuse to block his inspection, he became more convinced Mingnu was on board. Just as he was about to order soldiers to seize Sister Yao, he suddenly heard a crash from the boat. Looking toward the sound, he saw the glass of a cabin window shattered, and two small feet sticking out!

Upon seeing this, Sister Yao trembled all over and almost collapsed. Li Ziyu knew there must be something fishy on the boat. He immediately shoved Sister Yao aside, shouted "Take her!", jumped onto the gangplank in one stride, and boarded the pleasure boat.

There were originally two "beans-and-water" guarding the boat. Seeing Li Ziyu boarding aggressively with men, they knew the jig was up. Daring not to obstruct officers on duty, they stepped aside.

"Search!" Li Ziyu commanded. Several National Army soldiers immediately spread out to search.

In just a moment, the soldiers brought out a woman. She looked seventeen or eighteen, with a pretty face but haggard and pale. Her clothes were bright, but her hair was messy and her frame slender. Blood seeped from her feet, presumably from kicking the glass.

Seeing Li Ziyu, the woman flopped to her knees, shouting, "Officer save me! Officer save me!"

A soldier reported, "She was alone in the cabin, tied up, with a cloth stuffed in her mouth..."

Seeing it wasn't Mingnu, Li Ziyu felt anxious and his face turned iron-blue. He said coldly to Sister Yao, "No wonder you wouldn't let me inspect. So your pleasure boat has a distinct 'illness'!"

Seeing she couldn't cover it up anymore, Sister Yao hurriedly said, "This... this small one doesn't know where she came from..."

Seeing a chance, He Xiaoyue hurriedly crawled a few steps on her knees, knocked her head on the deck several times, and wailed, "I beg the Officer to save this slave! They... they are forcing a respectable woman into prostitution!" She collapsed on the ground crying.

Although Li Ziyu hadn't found Mingnu and was anxious, the appearance of He Xiaoyue proved Fangchun Court had major problems. He originally wanted to force Sister Yao to reveal Mingnu's whereabouts then and there. But on second thought, with He Xiaoyue as a handle, Fangchun Court had run straight into the muzzle of the "Custom Industry Rectification Campaign." They would be at his mercy! He could turn the brothel upside down and take it apart to find Mingnu if needed. No need to stand firm and negotiate politely like now. Making up his mind, he said to He Xiaoyue:

"Don't cry, Miss He. I understand your plight. Come back with us to assist in the investigation. Don't be afraid. The laws of the Great Song are the guardian gods of the people. We will never wrong a good person nor let a bad person go! Whatever grievances or mistreatment you suffered, tell us in detail back at the station!"

Hearing this, He Xiaoyue felt settled. She kowtowed again: "This slave prays to gods and Buddhas for the Officer to have enduring nobility! Everything is up to the Officer's decision!"

Li Ziyu turned to Sister Yao with a cold sneer: "Fangchun Court isn't your family's property. Is it worth such loyal devotion? Like a clay bodhisattva crossing the river, you can't even save yourself. I think you'd better be sensible!"

He signaled the soldiers: "Chain them all up! Take them away!"

Li Ziyu ordered two soldiers to stay on the boat and search further to ensure no secret compartments remained. He led the others back to the flower hall. Sister Han Qiao was waiting anxiously. She had wanted to send a maid to check the situation, but Zhao Gui, who looked stupid and dull, allowed absolutely no negotiation—when he said no leaving, he meant no leaving, no matter how she talked.

Just as she was anxious, she saw Li Ziyu come out from the back with a stern face. Sister Han Qiao sensed something bad. Then she saw He Xiaoyue stumbling behind him. It was like a thunderbolt striking her head; she almost collapsed.

Li Ziyu walked up to her and sneered, "Madam Han, I see your house really has quite a few tricks..."

Sister Han Qiao suppressed her panic and forced a smile: "Master Yu, this slave doesn't understand..."

Old Man Fang saw things had gone south and hurriedly came out to smooth things over: "Master Yu! Madam Han was confused for a moment. She is an old resident here, someone who knows rules and reason. Since the Great Song arrived, she hasn't dared violate any regulations. It's just old habits that couldn't change immediately. I beg you to raise your hand high..." He winked repeatedly at Sister Han Qiao as he spoke.

Sister Han Qiao was about to say something, but Li Ziyu gave them no chance to act. He cut them off: "Save these words for the bureau. Fangchun Court privately hides women of unknown origin and forces respectable women into prostitution. Suspend business for three days for rectification! We will decide the punishment after investigation. Ah Gui, take all involved personnel away!"

The courtyard instantly fell into chaos. Prostitutes, maids, and male servants all held their breath, daring not to speak. They had never encountered such a thing—a small policeman looked around, and because of a bought woman, took the madam away! And closed the brothel! Even the headmen of the Fast Squad in the past had never done this!

Li Ziyu instructed Zhao Gui to take Sister Han Qiao back first and report the situation of Fangchun Court to Lian Nishang, the Executive Deputy Leader of the "Clean-up Custom Industry Working Group."

"Tell the Second-Level Commander: I feel there may be other illegal activities here requiring further investigation. Requesting reinforcement from the bureau." Li Ziyu said pompously.
