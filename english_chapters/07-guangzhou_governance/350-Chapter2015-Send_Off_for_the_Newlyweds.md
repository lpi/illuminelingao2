# Chapter 2015 - Send-Off for the Newlyweds

The approaching celebration infused both the Qingjie Institute and Jiliang Institute with palpable joy. The happiness proved contagious—not only those preparing to marry felt it, but those remaining behind as well. Even the elderly, disabled, and widowed residents who would likely never form families again wore smiles.

The single women preparing to depart for Lingao packed their belongings. "Belongings" amounted to little more than a few garments and bedding articles, all tied with official-issue rope, with clothes and miscellaneous items stored in uniformly distributed rattan cases. The Council also provided each woman with a bamboo water flask and a tin meal box for the journey.

In truth, they'd originally possessed almost nothing. Most women entering the Qingjie Institute had arrived destitute—beyond a change of clothes, some lacked even bedding, relying entirely on charity from wealthy city ladies. That charity first had to pass through exploitation by the institute's managers, and what reached their hands invariably proved the poorest quality.

After the Guangzhou City Government assumed control, it frankly lacked surplus energy to care for them extensively. It simply removed one layer of exploitation, ensuring everyone ate adequately and didn't wear rags. Later, a self-help production program commenced. Earning processing fees allowed them to eat better and acquire some household items. Though mostly trivial possessions, for them it marked the first time they'd owned anything at all.

For this matchmaking marriage, perhaps from guilt or to "buy favor," the Elders had furnished every single woman marrying from the Qingjie Institute with a respectable dowry. After all, their future married lives wouldn't follow easy paths. Appropriate material compensation seemed only reasonable.

The dowry roughly equated to shopping vouchers worth one month's average naturalized worker salary—not substantial, but enough to purchase considerable goods in Lingao, serving as "startup capital" for establishing households. Additionally, each woman received new clothes—a dress—plus a glass mirror.

The clothes were one matter. Many felt them too "flashy" to wear publicly. But the glass mirror represented a precious object unattainable for ordinary people. The women cradled them, unable to look away.

"Alright, stop admiring them, everyone! If you break your mirrors it'll be too late for tears!" He Xiaoyue, wearing a brand-new cadre uniform, called out. "Departure time approaches. Pack your belongings quickly."

Since her rescue during the "Vice Industry Rectification Campaign," He Xiaoyue had come to understand society's perils intimately. After residing in the shelter awhile, she'd thought everything through completely: her in-laws were garbage, her natal family had never treated her as human, and after her escape, men and women outside had only sought to profit from her body. Thinking it over, only the Australians had helped her without expecting anything in return. Whether Dr. Liu back then or the Australians cleaning up brothels later, they'd never plotted against her. Rescuing her again this time, treating her injuries, taking her in, providing food and clothing—the more she reflected, the more hateful the "old society" seemed, and the deeper the Australians' kindness. After staying in the shelter barely five or six days, she'd told Lu Cheng she was willing to "join the group."

A cultured woman like He Xiaoyue naturally attracted Council favor. Thus she'd transformed into a Civil Affairs department staff member. Because she'd stayed in the Qingjie Institute for several years and knew the chaste widows inside, after this matchmaking activity she was assigned to accompany them to Lingao for their marriages.

"Pui, pui, pui! Don't speak ominous words," a woman spat. "Breaking a mirror brings bad luck! Especially before marriage."

"Sister Zhen, you know breaking it's unlucky, yet you hold it like that? Put it away quickly," He Xiaoyue urged.

"I haven't looked at myself properly in so many years. Now that I have this crystal mirror, how can I not look properly?" Sister Zhen sighed, setting the mirror down. "In the blink of an eye, I've been here fifteen years. I'm old—truly old."

When she'd entered the institute, she'd been a young woman in her prime. Now youth had fled; middle age approached. Forced to come here to "keep chastity" for survival back then, she'd spent life's best years within this square courtyard—a living coffin. Now, finally granted a chance to restart life, spiritual excitement went without saying, yet she harbored apprehension about the future.

"Where are you old? Your complexion's much ruddier now," He Xiaoyue teased. "Don't know which lucky man gets to marry you as a wife."

"I'm old nonetheless. How can I compare to a young girl like you? You're the fortunate one." Sister Zhen spoke wistfully, storing the mirror away.

He Xiaoyue knew she'd misspoken. Though being able to marry and have someone to depend upon for life represented a joyous event, they were marrying disabled men after all. Future life would likely prove harder than for ordinary couples. Recently, quite a few women had wanted to cancel their engagements. To prevent loss of "results," the shelter's female cadres had gone all-out with persuasion work—He Xiaoyue primarily handled this duty.

She didn't dare say much about these marriages, only commenting: "What fortune do I have? Widowed young, abducted and nearly sold to a brothel, suffered so much before the Council of Elders rescued me."

Sister Zhen grasped her meaning, patted her arm, and laughed. "Say no more. Since ancient times, marry a chicken, follow a chicken. Even if my household head is disabled, I accept it—better than remaining here a lifetime. But you—you're young, though not too young. Why not hurry and find someone suitable? Unlike Sister Zhen, you could find someone better..."

These words made He Xiaoyue's ears burn. She chided: "Everything's fine—why drag me into it? My mind's made up. Men are no good. I don't want to marry. Working for the Council of Elders a lifetime will be relaxed and happy. These few months have been more enjoyable than the past dozen years."

Sister Zhen laughed. "You talk craziness! When you arrived here you were escorted under guard, plotting escape. Now, asked not to keep chastity, you refuse to marry?"

"Hey, can that be the same?" He Xiaoyue protested. "Back then, keeping chastity here, we were just living dead."

At this, Sister Zhen couldn't help nodding agreement.

"...Working for the Australians these few months—tired, yes, endless work every day—but my heart's never been so free. Like a bird escaped from its cage..."

Indeed, these days she seemed to possess inexhaustible strength, willing to do whatever was asked. Even tasks she'd been unwilling to do previously, she now performed with joy.

Sister Zhen laughed. "True, true. I also feel you're different from before—not only more talkative but loud-voiced too."

At the Jiliang Institute, a different scene unfolded. Students successful in matchmaking were now concentrated in one dormitory, also packing belongings.

Like the widows in the Qingjie Institute, the students originally owned little. Low-class prostitutes couldn't compare to girls in high-class brothels who received countless tips and could stash away valuables. The clientele of low-class prostitutes were mostly poor; even when clients occasionally gave gifts, the madam would seize them.

According to Wang Jun and Du Yibin's vision, every marrying woman should receive a generous dowry as a "demonstration." But their idea was jointly rejected by Lin Baiguang and Ai Zhixin—no money, and no soliciting sponsorship.

However, after arguing vigorously, they'd managed to secure a passable dowry for the "single women." As for the students, it proved much shabbier: just some bedsheets, towels, pillowcases, and similar textiles, uniformly printed with "Souvenir of Guangzhou's First Matchmaking Conference."

Though the dowry was meager, for the students, marrying a decent man with stable income and starting a family already represented tremendous fortune. Compared to the somewhat delicate atmosphere in the Qingjie Institute, laughter and joy filled this Jiliang Institute dormitory daily. Not only were they happy, but close friends who weren't selected rejoiced for them too, often visiting to exchange "husband-managing techniques" and fantasize about future new lives.

While joy reigned here, other buildings inevitably felt somewhat desolate. Seeing sisters finding homes, everyone felt anxious—when would their turn come? The likes of Bian Cuibao had become rats crossing the street. Beyond speaking to them, people cursed them merely for passing by, as if their failure to be selected was entirely Bian Cuibao's fault.

Though the "activists" weren't selected, they sat secure on their fishing platforms. Director Lu had said: there will be opportunities next time—perhaps even better men than now?

Before noon, belongings in both locations were ready. Lu Cheng checked each individually. She summoned the marrying women to gather in the cafeteria. To celebrate their new lives, a sumptuous meal had been specially prepared, and each person received a bottle of kombucha. Directors Lu and Mao, along with Lu Cheng and other female cadres, attended.

Seeing this arrangement and the food on the tables, the women recognized this as a farewell meal—the time for departure had arrived. Mixed feelings arose; many eyes reddened. Lu Cheng raised a wine cup, about to speak auspicious blessings, when sobbing emerged from below. Lu Cheng merely said "don't be sad," but feeling sourness rise in her own heart, she choked up and couldn't continue. The crowd below burst into tears.

Director Lu stood at a loss, uncertain what to do. Mao Xiuyu whispered: "Let me say a few words."

He held his cup, walked to the front, and announced: "Women comrades, I am Mao Xiuyu—everyone knows me, yes? Today I'll rely on my age to speak briefly. First, a presumptuous statement: among all seated here, probably no one has greater seniority here than me."

He usually never boasted of seniority. Hearing this, Lu Cheng stared wide-eyed with curiosity.

"Since I was introduced to this Huanghua Temple in my twenties, I've worked as a handyman for thirty years, watching over ten head officials come and go, performing every kind of work. I've witnessed every variety of worldly condition in this Huanghua Temple."
