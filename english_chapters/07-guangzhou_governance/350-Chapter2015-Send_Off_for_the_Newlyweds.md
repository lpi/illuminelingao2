# Chapter 2015 - Send-Off for the Newlyweds

The happy event was approaching, filling both the Qingjie (Chaste) Institute and Jiliang Institute with joy. This joy was seemingly contagious; not only were those getting married happy, but those who weren't were also happy. Even the elderly disabled and widowed residents, who likely wouldn't have families again in this life, wore smiles.

The single women preparing to marry in Lingao were packing their luggage. "Luggage" was really just a few clothes and bedding items. All were tied with official-issue rope, with clothes and miscellaneous items stored in rattan suitcases distributed uniformly. The Council of Elders also issued each person a bamboo water flask and a tin meal box for eating en route.

In truth, they originally possessed almost nothing. Most women entering the Qingjie Institute were destitute; aside from a change of clothes, some lacked even bedding, relying entirely on the charity of wealthy ladies in the city—which first had to pass through a layer of exploitation by the institute's managers. What reached their hands was invariably the poorest quality goods.

After the Guangzhou City Government took over, it honestly didn't have much surplus energy to care for them either; it simply removed a layer of exploitation, allowing everyone to eat their fill and not wear rags. Later, a self-help production program was initiated; earning processing fees allowed them to eat better and acquire some household items. Though mostly trivial items, for them it was the first time they owned property.

For this matchmaking marriage, perhaps out of guilt or "buying favor," the Elders had given every single woman marrying from the Qingjie Institute a decent "dowry"—after all, for them, future married life wouldn't be an easy path. Appropriate material compensation was only reasonable.

This dowry roughly equated to shopping vouchers worth one month's average salary of a naturalized worker. Not much, but enough to buy quite a few things in Lingao, serving as "startup funds" for organizing their households. Additionally, each person received a set of new clothes—a dress—plus a glass mirror.

The clothes were one thing—many felt they were too "flashy" to wear out—but the glass mirror was a precious object unattainable for ordinary people. The women held them, unable to look enough.

"Alright, stop looking everyone, if you break the mirror it'll be too late to cry!" He Xiaoyue, wearing a brand-new "cadre uniform," spoke loudly. "Departure time is soon, everyone pack your luggage quickly."

Since being rescued during the "Vice Industry Rectification Campaign," He Xiaoyue deeply understood the perils of society. Having lived in the shelter for a while, she had thought things through completely: her in-laws were definitely garbage, her natal family hadn't treated her as human either; after escaping, men and women outside only wanted to profit from her body... Thinking it over, only the Australians helped her without expecting anything in return. Whether Dr. Liu back then, or the Australians cleaning up the brothels later, they never plotted anything against her. Rescuing her again this time, treating her injuries and taking her in, providing food and clothing... the more she thought, the more hateful the "old society" seemed, and the deeper the Australians' kindness. After staying in the shelter less than five or six days, she told Lu Cheng she was willing to "join the group."

A cultured woman like He Xiaoyue was naturally favored by the Council of Elders. Thus she transformed into a staff member of the Civil Affairs department. Because she had stayed in the Qingjie Institute for several years and knew the chaste widows inside, after this matchmaking activity she was assigned to "care for" them and accompany them to Lingao for marriage.

"Pui pui pui, don't say ominous words," a woman spat. "Breaking a mirror is bad luck! Especially before getting married."

"Sister Zhen, you know it's bad luck to break it, yet you hold it like that—put it away quickly," He Xiaoyue urged.

"I haven't looked at myself properly for so many years. Now having this crystal mirror, how can I not look properly?" Sister Zhen sighed, putting down the mirror. "In a blink of an eye, I've been here fifteen years! Old, I'm old."

When she entered the institute, she was a young woman in her prime; now youth was gone, approaching middle age. Forced to come here to "keep chastity" for a living back then, she had spent the best years of her life in this square courtyard living coffin. Now finally having a chance to restart life, the spiritual excitement went without saying, yet she held some apprehension about the future.

"Where are you old? I think your complexion is much ruddier now," He Xiaoyue teased. "Don't know which lucky man gets to marry you as a wife."

"I am old after all. How can I compare to a young girl like you—you're the lucky one." Sister Zhen said wistfully, putting the mirror away. He Xiaoyue knew she had misspoken: though being able to marry and have someone to rely on for the rest of her life was a joyous event, they were marrying disabled men after all. Future life would likely be harder than for ordinary couples. Recently, quite a few people wanted to regret and cancel the engagement. To prevent the loss of "results," the female cadres of the shelter went all out in persuasion work—He Xiaoyue mainly did this job. She dared not say much about this marriage, only saying: "What luck do I have: widowed young, abducted and almost sold to a brothel, suffered so much before being rescued by the Council of Elders."

Sister Zhen understood her meaning, patted her arm, and laughed: "Say no more. Since ancient times, marry a chicken follow a chicken. Even if the head of the house is disabled, I accept it—better than staying here a lifetime. But you, you're young but not too young, why not hurry and find a suitable one? Unlike Sister Zhen, you can find someone better..."

These words made He Xiaoyue's ears burn. She chided: "Everything's fine, why drag me into it? My mind is made up. Men are no good; I don't want to marry. Working for the Council of Elders a lifetime is relaxed and happy. These few months have been more enjoyable than the past dozen years."

Sister Zhen laughed: "talking craziness! When you came here you were escorted under guard, plotting to escape; now asked not to keep chastity, you refuse to marry?"

"Hey hey, can that be the same?" He Xiaoyue said. "In the past keeping chastity here, we were just living dead."

At this, Sister Zhen couldn't help nodding.

"...Working for the Australians these few months, tired is tired, endless work every day, but my heart has never been so free. Like a bird out of the cage..."

Indeed, these days she seemed to have inexhaustible strength, willing to do whatever asked. Even things she was unwilling to do in the past, she now did with joy.

Sister Zhen laughed: "True, true, I also feel you're different from before—not only talkative but loud-voiced too."

In the Jiliang Institute, it was another scene. Students successful in matchmaking were now concentrated in one dormitory. They were also packing luggage.

Like the widows in the Qingjie Institute, the students originally had few possessions—low-class prostitutes couldn't compare to girls in high-class brothels who received countless tips and could stash away valuables—the clientele of low-class prostitutes were mostly poor; even if clients occasionally gave gifts, the madam would seize them.

According to Wang Jun and Du Yibin's idea, every marrying woman should be given a generous dowry to serve as a "demonstration." But their idea was jointly shot down by Lin Baiguang and Ai Zhixin—no money, and no soliciting sponsorship.

However, after arguing strongly, they managed to give the "single women" a passable dowry. As for the students, it was much shabbier. Just some bedsheets, towels, pillowcases and such textiles, uniformly printed with "Souvenir of Guangzhou's First Matchmaking Conference."

Though the "dowry" was meager, for the students, marrying a decent man with stable income and starting a family was already a great boon. Compared to the somewhat delicate atmosphere in the Qingjie Institute, laughter and joy filled this dormitory in the Jiliang Institute every day. Not only were they happy, but their close friends who weren't selected were happy for them too, often coming to sit, exchange "husband-taming techniques," and fantasize about future new lives.

While joy reigned here, other buildings were inevitably somewhat desolate. Seeing sisters finding a home, everyone felt anxious—when would it be their turn? The likes of Bian Cuibao were now rats crossing the street; let alone speaking to them, people cursed them just passing by. As if their failure to be selected was entirely due to Bian Cuibao.

Though the "activists" weren't selected, they sat secure on the fishing platform. Director Lu said: there will be opportunities next time—maybe even better men than now?

Before noon, luggage in both places was ready. Lu Cheng checked one by one. She called the marrying women to gather in the cafeteria. To celebrate their new lives, a rich meal was specially prepared, and each person received a bottle of kombucha. Directors Lu and Mao, along with Lu Cheng and other female cadres, were present.

Seeing this setup and the food on the tables, the women knew this was a farewell meal; the time for departure had come. Mixed feelings arose; many eyes turned red. Lu Cheng held a wine cup, about to say some auspicious words of blessing, when sobbing came from below. Lu Cheng just said "don't be sad," but feeling a sourness in her own heart, she choked up and couldn't speak. The crowd below burst into tears.

Director Lu was at a loss, unsure what to do. Mao Xiuyu whispered: "Let me say a few words."

He held his cup, walked to the front, and said: "Women comrades, I am Mao Xiuyu—everyone knows me, right? Today I'll rely on my age to say a few words. First, a presumptuous statement: among all sitting here, probably no one has more seniority here than me."

He usually never boasted of seniority. Hearing this, Lu Cheng stared wide-eyed in curiosity.

"Since I was introduced to this Huanghua Temple in my twenties, I've worked as a handyman for thirty years, seeing over ten head officials come and go, doing every kind of job. I've seen every kind of worldly state in this Huanghua Temple."
