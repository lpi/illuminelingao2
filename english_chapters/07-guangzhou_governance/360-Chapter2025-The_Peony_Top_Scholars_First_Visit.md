# Chapter 2025 - The Peony Top Scholar's First Visit to Five Immortals Temple

Then he thought, wasn't there a ready-made opportunity right before him? This young Master Zhang wanted to hold a ritual, and Qing Jing came to invite his family to participate—needless to say, his mother would definitely support such things. Why not simply use the pretext of joining the ritual to visit the Five Immortals Temple and meet the hair-thieves' "Daoist"?

Thinking of this, Li Suiqiu suddenly gained energy, calling: "Someone!"

Thus, on this morning, the brothers Li Suiqiu and Li Suiqi came to Five Immortals Temple to "offer incense."

As expected, the moment he entered the temple gate, Qing Huan entertained him while saying something to a young Daoist beside him; the young Daoist glanced at the Li brothers and scurried inside.

"Needless to say, he's gone to report to the Australians." Li Suiqiu thought.

Qing Huan led the two brothers on a tour. Though it was called "offering incense," Li Suiqiu actually hadn't brought incense—presumably the temple had some. But only after entering did he learn the New Daoism didn't emphasize burning incense offerings. Though not forbidden, it wasn't encouraged either. Only sincere worship and fresh flower offerings were valued. Inside the halls, incense burning was completely prohibited; only large incense burners were placed on stone steps. Each person was allowed only three thin incense sticks; tall incense, stick incense, gold and silver paper—none could be burned.

So as they walked, there wasn't the smoke-filled, hazy feeling of large temples. Though many worshippers came, order was excellent. In halls with more people, Daoist students guided and dispersed crowds, entering from one side, exiting from another, orderly indeed.

"No wonder everyone says Australians most value the word 'order'; indeed well-deserved." Li Suiqiu secretly appraised.

Touring to the middle hall, though the back was separated by doors, sounds of children reciting and playing and singing could be heard. He was secretly surprised; could the Australians be running a community school here? Asking Qing Huan, it was indeed so. His heart secretly sighed: though it was an easy effort, not everyone was willing to do it.

The highlight of touring Five Immortals Temple was climbing the Number One Tower of Lingnan. Li Suiqiu had climbed this bell tower more than once before, even holding poetry gatherings there with teachers and friends. But this was the first time since the Australians entered the city; he felt quite emotional.

Upon climbing up, he saw a fat Daoist already waiting above with a beaming smile.

"Supreme Treasure of the Dao," the fat Daoist bowed, "Are you the Li brothers?"

"Indeed, your students." Li Suiqiu thought: as expected, he appeared.

This was the "Australian Daoist" he had seen at several ritual activities. Reportedly also a true baldy Elder. In Guangzhou he seemed to lead both monks and Daoists.

Li Suiqiu was very confident: the moment he appeared at Five Immortals Temple, that Australian Daoist would certainly come to meet him—he was, after all, a celebrated scholar famous throughout the South.

"This humble Daoist is the Five Immortals Temple abbot, Supervisor of Guangzhou Five Immortals Temple, Cui Hantang. I have long admired your great name."

Though Cui Hantang was casual and fearless, he was very careful about working on famous people—completely different from many Elders who disdained or even viewed famous figures of this timeline as enemies. This was probably because, as a lover of traditional culture, he naturally had a favorable impression of traditional celebrities. Moreover, for a renowned scholar and national hero like Li Suiqiu, fan goggles automatically applied.

Cui Hantang looked at the elegant, fair-skinned, lightly bearded young gentlemen before him, secretly sighing: according to old timeline history, in a dozen years he would die in battle at Ganzhou—unimaginable that such a refined gentleman could fearlessly abandon everything and die heroically! His admiration grew, and his courtesy became increasingly respectful.

If any Elders saw Cui Hantang's manner at this moment, they would certainly scold him for "losing his position" or "licking the Ming remnants' boots." But Cui Hantang's martial value wasn't low, and ordinary Elders didn't dare openly mock him.

"Don't mention it, don't mention it." Li Suiqiu returned the greeting. He secretly wondered: what's this hair-thief Daoist's angle? Why so respectful to me?

Speaking of fame, he indeed had some reputation in Guangdong—poetic talent. Beyond that, his moral essays weren't exceptional; just an ordinary celebrity. He had long heard Australians were all supremely arrogant, each claiming talents to govern heaven and earth. Let alone contemporary great Confucians, even the Supreme Sage was often given the contemptuous nickname "Old Kong Number Two" by them.

"Come, this humble Daoist has prepared pure tea; please enjoy." Cui Hantang invited them to sit on the bell tower.

The policeman manning the observation post had been sent away. English garden-style rattan furniture was set up, along with a set of Gongfu tea utensils. Beside them was a small wind stove with an iron kettle "glug-glugging" steam. A Daoist student was fanning the flames.

The rattan furniture wasn't rare—Zicheng Shop had long sold complete sets, said to be woven from Qiongzhou's red and white rattan, some with iron frames, each with exotic flair, quite popular among wealthy households in the city. Li Suiqiu's family also had several sets, placed in the garden, study, and other locations.

As for the tea tray and utensils, he recognized them as "Gongfu tea" brought by Australians. It first became popular at Zi Ming Lou. Gradually it became fashionable among wealthy families. Though Li Suiqiu didn't follow this trend, he'd drunk it many times. Gongfu tea itself wasn't rare, but it required Australian "Limu Mountain Oolong Tea"; especially the supreme grade "Frozen Peak," with its faint orchid fragrance, was very expensive. Tea merchants everywhere wanted to discover the secret of "Limu Mountain Oolong Tea," but the Australians guarded it strictly; even sending people to Qiongzhou yielded no results.

Li Suiqiu and his brother sat down. Cui Hantang washed cups and scalded vessels, brewing Gongfu tea. The three said nothing, First drinking a round.

"Truly excellent tea." Li Suiqiu tasted and knew Cui Hantang had offered the finest tea—even at Zi Ming Lou before, he hadn't drunk this quality. Probably supplies reserved for Elders, the true baldies.

Flattery works no matter what. Li Suiqiu was someone whose daily life was superior to ordinary people, born to a local gentry family, long accustomed to life's pleasures and courtesies. But being respectfully treated by these "pirate giants" rampaging through Guangdong and famous throughout the realm still felt quite satisfactory, regardless of how he inwardly resented their attempt to "usurp the throne."

"Good tea. Good tea." Li Suiqiu set down his cup.

"This is tea specially supplied to the Council of Elders by the General Office; can't be bought outside. Naturally it's the finest." Cui Hantang leaned back, his full-moon face wearing a half-smile. "Brother Li's visit to our humble temple for incense... our humble temple... um... this... brings radiance..."

Cui Hantang intended to use this opportunity to win over, or at least make Li Suiqiu develop some positive feelings toward New Daoism and himself, for future work.

Actually, within the Council of Elders, there were completely different opinions about these famous historical figures of the Ming. Some believed they should try to recruit them for their use, absorbing them into the system. Others wanted to eliminate them ASAP. Most Elders on the sidelines felt indifferent, neither wanting to recruit nor eliminate—as long as they stayed home and didn't cause trouble.

Cui Hantang belonged to the first view. Of course, he differed slightly from other Elders with similar views: he harbored certain selfish intentions, hoping to convert Li Suiqiu, the Peony Top Scholar, to New Daoism, and then gradually bring in his teacher Chen Zizhuang and the Twelve Masters of the Southern Garden one by one. Strengthening New Daoism's power.

Of course, he hadn't mentioned this idea to anyone, because saying it would certainly get him criticized by the Council: "consorting with gentry," "corrupting the ranks," etc.

But today his opening fell flat immediately, earning Li Suiqiu's disdain: hair-thieves really were crude barbarians who couldn't even exchange basic pleasantries.

Though thinking so, Li Suiqiu still said courteously: "Not at all, not at all. Having nothing to do at home, hearing Young Master Zhang wants to hold a blessing ritual at your esteemed temple, this student came to see the excitement."

Cui Hantang started, then realized Qing Jing must have gone to Li's home to invite "participation." Secretly praising "well done," he described the matchmaking and collective wedding in tiresome detail from beginning to end.

Li Suiqiu listened to him boast, but it was no different from news in *Sheep City Express*. Seeing this fat Daoist spitting while speaking, his words vulgar, face full of smug satisfaction, he secretly felt distaste.

His cultivation was excellent; he listened expressionlessly to this "official announcement." Then slowly asked: "What the Daoist Master describes, this student has also read in the newspaper. This collective wedding is certainly a good thing, giving widowers and widows someone to depend on. It also fits the Council of Elders' claim to save all people from fire and water. But now the realm is in turmoil; countless commoners are mired in fire and water. How does the Council of Elders intend to save them?"

Cui Hantang thought, this Li Suiqiu not only came prepared but went straight to the point, unadorned.

In Li Suiqiu's view, things like caring for widowers and widows were minor matters. Since the Australians invaded Guangdong, displaying a posture of contending for the Nine Provinces, he wanted to see what substance their grand ambition really had.

For Cui Hantang, this answer was difficult. Fortunately, he had imagined how to respond if similar questions arose when dealing with Guangzhou's Confucian scholars.

"The great situation of the realm, surely Master Meizhou sees more clearly than this humble Daoist." Cui Hantang said. "Honestly, the Ming's current situation is nothing but reversed timing, geography, and popular support."

"What does that mean?" Li Suiqiu became interested. Discussing national affairs and critiquing governance were what intellectuals enjoyed most since ancient times. Cui Hantang's novel viewpoint immediately touched his itch.

"Master Meizhou has read much; you probably know that since ancient times, those who accomplish great things need both ability and luck. As they say, man proposes, heaven disposes. Heaven's will cannot be violated." Cui Hantang began mystifying. "What is heaven's will? Speaking of it seems abstruse; in reality, it mostly results from human affairs, but ordinary people take it for granted and don't pay attention."
