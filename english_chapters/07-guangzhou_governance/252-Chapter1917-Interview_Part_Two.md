## Chapter 1921 - Interview (Part Two)

Elder Ai Zhixin was especially pleased—such arithmetic ability was outstanding even among the natives. Excellent! The Tax Bureau currently had no computers for people to use. A good hand with the abacus and sensitivity to numbers were key to collecting taxes well. This was a fine prospect! Then came the final question:

"Now, please listen to the last question. After you begin working, you once discover someone carrying gifts walking into your bureau, then proceeding directly into the director's office. Faced with this situation, what would you do? Begin your answer!"

Hearing this question, Zeng Juan momentarily panicked. He had seen similar questions in his interview study guide. This was a classic interpersonal relations question. How to answer presented a dilemma. If he didn't advise against it, that made him a person without principles in modern parlance. But if he did advise against it—he was just a lowly newcomer. How could he discuss such a matter with his superior? Though it might be proper in principle, it didn't accord with human sentiment, and saying so would sound hypocritical. If the examiner pressed him on this issue, the slightest flaw in his answer would invite relentless follow-up questions.

He pondered again and again. Seeing the hourglass for thinking time nearly run out, he steeled himself and gritted his teeth, thinking: *Whatever! It's not my business anyway—just push it aside!* He steadied his nerves and said: "Respected examiners, this candidate begins answering the final question. Faced with such a situation, I would not make any unnecessary moves, because I believe every official under our Great Song is certainly one who upholds the law impartially and would not accept anyone's benefits. I believe my superior is certainly a Great Song civil servant who can withstand any test. The only thing I need to do in this situation is remind other colleagues who witnessed it not to spread talk that would be detrimental to internal workplace harmony. At the same time, I would work even harder at my assigned duties as a way of repaying the trust that the Senate and the people have placed in me. Respected examiners, this candidate has finished answering!"

Hearing this, Elder Ai Zhixin wanted to slap his thigh in approval. Damn! This was the makings of an official! Just before, that old literati above had invoked Zou Ji Satirizing the King of Qi into Accepting Advice, rambling on with a load of nonsense that made him want to doze off. But this lad was clever—yes, very clever! However, he was after all an Elder, and some dignity was required. So he casually indicated that Zeng Juan could leave. Zeng Juan bowed once more, said: "Thank you, examiners!" and left the examination room.

The moment he stepped out, Zeng Juan felt completely drained. He couldn't help feeling somewhat anxious, not knowing if his answer to the final question had been appropriate. He had an extremely strong desire for success, which inevitably made him prone to worry.

When Yuan Shuzhi's number was called, it was his turn to enter. Being older, he had been through many examinations and had a better mindset than Zeng Juan. Hearing his number called, he remained quite calm. But the instant he entered the examination room, he still felt somewhat nervous: the examiners sat in a row, just like in Zeng Juan's room—an Elder in the center with naturalized citizen cadres on either side.

The Elder in Yuan Shuzhi's examination room was none other than Dong Yizhi. Although the entire examination was conducted fairly with appropriate recusal systems, Elders always had their privileges. Dong Yizhi had long known that this old scholar before him was the one Zhang Yunmi had designated as receiving a high essay score. He had reviewed this person's essay and felt that while the prose wasn't particularly sophisticated, the thinking was a rare example among old literati of someone who could grasp the Senate's spirit. Because Dong Yizhi had already made up his mind, as long as Yuan Shuzhi wasn't a mute, he would admit him.

As for Yuan Shuzhi, when he saw that the chief interviewer was actually the examination official who had changed the conditions to accept his application, his spirits immediately lifted. According to old customs, he would be the examiner's protégé. If he passed, this teacher-student relationship would be established. This made Yuan Shuzhi extremely excited—if he could cling to an Elder's coattails, wouldn't he rise straight to the clouds! So he steadied himself and strode toward the examination desk.

Like Zeng Juan, Yuan Shuzhi followed the standard procedure from the textbook and took his seat. Then the naturalized citizen cadre began reading the questions:

"Congratulations on advancing to the interview. We won't say much else—let's begin the interview directly. Please listen to Question One: Some people say that age is a treasure, and learning serves as reference. What are your thoughts on this statement? Begin your answer!"

Encountering this question, Yuan Shuzhi silently groaned. This question seemed aimed straight at him. At his age, he couldn't act pompous based on seniority, but neither could he say that having lived most of his life, he amounted to nothing. So he could only brace himself and answer: "Respected examiners, I believe this saying has merit. Emperor Gaozu of Han once issued a decree: 'Select commoners of fifty years or more who are virtuous and capable of leading others to do good, and appoint one as a Township Elder for each township. Choose one Township Elder to serve as County Elder, who together with the county magistrate and officials shall educate the people in proper matters, and shall be exempt from labor and military service. On the tenth month, bestow wine and meat upon them.' This shows that elders are often highly virtuous and respected, with broad experience, and can offer much guidance to the younger generation—thus age is indeed a treasure. However, Master Han Yu's *On the Teacher* states: 'What I follow is the Way. Why should I care whether someone was born before or after me? Therefore, whether noble or base, young or old, wherever the Way exists, there exists my teacher!' He also said: 'Where three walk together, one must surely be my teacher. Therefore, a student need not be inferior to his teacher, nor a teacher necessarily wiser than his student. Understanding may come early or late, and each person has their own specialty—that is all.' From this we can see that learning knows no age—young or old, as long as the Way is present, there lies the teacher. If it benefits the resolution of a matter, whether the person be elderly or a mere child, one should treat them with the courtesy due a teacher and seek their guidance. Even Confucius could not explain the debate between two children about the sun—how much less so for ordinary people! This candidate has finished his answer!"

When Yuan Shuzhi finished, Dong Yizhi wanted to exclaim "Excellent!" several times. He had indeed not disappointed! Originally Dong Yizhi had felt some displeasure at the criticism from the Senate for changing the rules to recruit this old scholar. But now he felt his decision had been absolutely right! If not for changing the age restriction, this would have been a pearl cast aside! This old fellow was good—his efforts had not been in vain.

Having finished his answer, Yuan Shuzhi's blue robe was already soaked with sweat. But to maintain his composure, he steadfastly did not wipe it away—quite admirable for a man of his age.

"Very well, let's look at Question Two." The naturalized citizen cadre continued, "Please listen: Some people say that achievement brings position; others say that position brings achievement. Please share your thoughts."

Hearing this question, Yuan Shuzhi breathed a sigh of relief. This question was simple—just flatter a bit: "Respected examiners, I begin answering Question Two. I believe both statements are correct, but it depends on the circumstances. Under the Pseudo-Ming, how many great talents with vast learning could not enter official service? Great talents like Tang Yin and Xu Wei were never employed and died in obscurity. Yet those who did obtain office gave no thought to speaking on behalf of the people, only engaging in factional attacks and lining their own pockets. Under the Pseudo-Ming, those of achievement could not obtain position and perished; those with position gave no thought to their duties and were despised. Thus achievers without position died, and those with position did nothing—the realm was in peril!

"As for our glorious Senate, the civil service examination is open wide to search for heroes throughout the realm and employ them, so that the talented obtain their positions and the knowledgeable can display their abilities. Achievement and position complement each other as inside and outside, striving to restore our Great Song's ten thousand *li* of rivers and mountains and dispel the century of darkness over Huaxia! Truly it is as the orange grows in Huainan it is an orange; planted in Huaibei it becomes a thorny citron! This candidate has finished answering Question Two."

Hearing this, Dong Yizhi couldn't help but slap the table. This startled Yuan Shuzhi considerably. The assisting examiners beside him also felt somewhat awkward. Dong Yizhi had to pretend to cough to cover it up, then continued: "Candidate, please listen to the final question: Tell us about a book that left the deepest impression on you."

Yuan Shuzhi's first thought was *Dream of the Red Chamber*, so he immediately answered: "Respected examiners, the book that left the deepest impression on me is our Australian Song masterpiece *Dream of the Red Chamber*. This book encompasses everything, yet is neither scattered nor disordered; tender and affectionate, yet neither licentious nor vulgar; appearing magnificent and splendid, yet filled with words of heartache. It speaks of philosophy, discusses enlightenment, tells stories, and describes the human world. Reading this book, I felt as if I had entered the Grand View Garden within its pages. Closing the book, it was as if I had visited some ethereal immortal realm—truly a fantastical dream of a marvelous book! These are but shallow views; I hope the examiners will not laugh at me. This candidate has finished answering."

Dong Yizhi nodded with satisfaction. Were it not for the examination system prohibiting the direct announcement of results, he would have already proclaimed Yuan Shuzhi an Australian Song civil servant. But procedures still had to be followed—procedural justice was still justice. So he gave a high score, and the other cadres followed suit. This old Kong's score would certainly not be bad. As for Yuan Shuzhi, though he sensed the examiner viewed him favorably, he still couldn't fathom these Australians' temperament. With an anxious heart, he exited through the main gate, reunited with Zeng Juan, and concluded this examination. The moment he walked out of the examination hall, Yuan Shuzhi felt as if everything had been a dream...

The number of candidates coming for interviews today was quite large. In fact, this civil service examination was rather lenient. If judged by old timeline written examination standards, barely anyone truly qualified. During the grading phase, some Elders had pointed out that the examination content was too advanced, too difficult for people educated under traditional educational models, exceeding their comprehension.

In the wildly varied answer sheets, it was evident that most candidates' knowledge structures were quite lopsided. Directly recruiting them and assigning them to work positions would likely prove challenging. Some candidates also lacked practical understanding of the positions they had applied for—judging from their answer content, they were completely unsuited to their chosen positions.

However, among the various written examination papers, Liu Xiang, Lin Baiguang, and others still filtered out quite a few "talents worth cultivating." Broadly speaking, any candidate with even the slightest bright spot was placed on the interview list. More than five hundred people ultimately advanced to the interview stage.

The principles for the interview were also set quite loosely, because Liu Xiang had already decided that this batch of successfully recruited civil servants could not go directly to work—all of them had to undergo "re-education" at the Guangzhou Cadre Training School.

"Honestly speaking, they are indeed talented, but not the kind we need," Liu Xiang said to Zhang Yunmi. "However, they are all very clever and good at learning—in this time and space, educated people are good at learning. As long as we guide them onto the correct path, they will become our talents."
