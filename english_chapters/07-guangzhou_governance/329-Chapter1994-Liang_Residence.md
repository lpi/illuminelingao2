# Chapter 1994 - Liang Residence

Liang Cunhou sat quietly in his study, brow furrowed, cradling a cup of tea that had long since gone cold. A wisp of cool breeze drifted in through the window, gently lifting the pages of a newly bound poetry collection on his desk. The soft rustling seemed unusually loud today, as if the wind itself were restless.

The courtyard beyond lay silent—not even a cough disturbed the stillness. Everything appeared as it had for years: the moss-covered rockery, the ancient trees in their verdant grandeur, the pool of jade-green water, and the dozens of orchid pots he loved so dearly...

*How long can this peaceful ease remain?* Liang Cunhou asked himself.

The Noble Gathering affair seemed to have settled, but Liang Cunhou—well-versed in the Bandits' patterns—could smell the approaching storm. Some invisible hand appeared to be tightening around them, openly and in secret, making Young Master Liang feel as though breathing itself grew difficult by the day. He felt restless and distracted, unable to grasp at anything, filled with a floating sense of insecurity—as if all four walls offered nothing to lean upon.

A maid's voice came softly from outside the door: "Lin Zunxiu, Young Master Lin, has arrived..."

Liang Cunhou started as if waking from a dream. He set down his teacup, exhaled slowly, and replied: "Show him in at once. No need for the Flower Hall—bring him directly to the Inner Study."

Lin Zunxiu strode in moments later, dispensing with pleasantries entirely. He simply placed a newspaper on the desk and spoke directly: "Brother Liang, please look at this. It's the new article 'Crime and Punishment of Finance and Tax,' published in the Daily the day before yesterday. I read it carefully. It discusses various precedents and malpractices of so-called Australian Song taxation—what the Australians call 'Cases and Interpretations.' Voluminous and technical, but whether reading between the lines or on the surface, every word conveys a single message: *Pay tax according to law; evaded taxes will be investigated.* Under Australian statutes, the shadow enterprises in which we hold shares are all classified as illegal businesses—every one of them appears on their lists for 'striking and collecting.' Among them, the brothels and gambling dens... even if we brought them into the light and legalized them, the tracked-back taxes, the confiscations—never mind all that. The mere criticism from respectable quarters alone would be more than we could bear. And without those substantial cash flows, how are we to deal with the Bandits?"

Liang Cunhou gazed blankly toward the window. After a long pause, he spoke: "Zhao Juren visited yesterday."

Lin Zunxiu stiffened. "What did he want?"

"The Zhao family and my Liang family have always been on friendly terms—considerable silver has passed between us over the years. Yesterday, however, he came to settle all accounts. His words were evasive, guarded. I suspect he intends to suspend dealings with the Liang family for some time."

"Why would he do that?"

"Zhao Juren said that since receiving Director Zheng's instruction to 'abide by the law and follow the law' some days ago, he had already reported all his family's assets and businesses to the Finance and Tax Bureau, accepting both penalties and payments. He came specifically to apologize. The meaning beneath his words was clear: he wished the Liang family well and hoped we would look after ourselves. He fears the Bandits intend to move against us."

Lin Zunxiu flared with anger: "That spineless old man! The Bandits haven't even done anything yet, and he's already frightened into such a state!"

After a moment's hesitation, he added: "Surely it won't come to that? The Bandits make endless proclamations about benevolence and virtue. The Liang family has aided them many times and co-founded the Charity Hall. When Governor Wang attacked Qiongzhou, we extended them numerous courtesies. One might say we've shown them considerable grace. Such treatment would chill the hearts of every scholar and gentleman! How would they ever win hearts and gather talent in the future? Without popular support, how can they hope to take the realm?"

Liang Cunhou sighed softly. "The Bandits' hearts are set on the common people, not on scholars. They enforce harsh laws and severe punishments, treat scholars with contempt—yet they excel at the hundred crafts, refine agricultural techniques, engage freely with merchants, and promote their Pseudo-Learning. Foolish commoners, coveting petty profits and knowing nothing of the Greater Righteousness, their vision extending no further than their own feet—they are easily deceived by the Bandits. Though the Bandits cannot win the hearts of the realm's scholars, their soldiers are superbly trained and their weapons keen. Since antiquity, the Mandate of Heaven has belonged to those with strong soldiers and sturdy horses. What can a few scholars accomplish? The Australians have their own scholars; they need not employ us! They are just like the Mongols—perhaps bows and horses alone will suffice to make all of Hua Xia reek of mutton."

Lin Zunxiu lowered his head in thought. It was true. Though the Australians had conducted some sort of "Civil Service Examination" after occupying Guangzhou—and many people assumed it was the Australian equivalent of the Imperial Examination—those with any understanding knew it was nothing of the sort. The Imperial Examination selected *officials*; this "Civil Service Exam" merely recruited *clerks*. The requirements were loose, and the admitted candidates came from all walks of life, encompassing every class and trade. Strictly speaking, it showed no regard whatsoever for scholars.

After a pause, Liang Cunhou picked up the newspaper again. His finger tapped against it rhythmically, producing soft *pa-pa* sounds. "Brother Lin, I've read this article too. The Bandits' hearts are sinister. Some time ago, they published Tax Law openly in the newspaper, proclaiming that 'Paying Tax is Glory' and 'Everyone is Equal Before Tax Law,' demanding that scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants all pay taxes and grain alike. No preservation of scholarly dignity whatsoever. And now they've published this rubbish. Ostensibly discussing how violations of tax law should be punished, in reality they're establishing firm footing, positioning themselves on the side of orthodoxy. By proclaiming and clarifying widely first, they avoid charges of 'Punishing Without Teaching.' Yesterday I heard their Tax Propagandists were going door to door explaining the regulations. After their lectures, they require every family head, master, shopkeeper, and accountant to sign and pledge their understanding. What is this? It's a confession extracted in advance for the public hall! To know the law and yet offend—to test the law with one's person—this becomes 'Harming the Country, Thieves of the People.' Fail to pay the New Dynasty's taxes, refuse to obey the New Dynasty's laws, and you cannot be the New Dynasty's subjects. The so-called 'Manifestation of Official Penalties'—this is precisely that manifestation. When they catch a few examples in the future, I fear it will be 'Official Penalties' indeed. Look at them—unwilling to shoulder the burden of 'Punishing Without Teaching,' insisting on claiming the moral high ground, step by step!"

Finishing, Liang Cunhou smiled bitterly and tossed the newspaper onto his desk with a sharp *pa*.

Lin Zunxiu felt his heart turn to ice. After a long silence, he burst out resentfully: "Then what? Everyone in Guangzhou knows how much Young Master Liang has done for the Bandits. If they truly treat us unconscionably, let the whole world witness their coldness and ingratitude! Let them see who would willingly become a discarded bow once the birds are gone! Besides, though Guangzhou's scholars and gentry are cowed by the Bandits' tyranny, many hearts still turn toward the Court. Generations of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness—they won't simply sit by and watch!"

Liang Cunhou shook his head gently. "Brother Lin, you see only sentiment. Others look at the balance of power. Sentiment may be pitiable, but power cannot be reversed. Since ancient times, countless generations of the loyal and righteous have perished at the hands of villains! Today, the ground beneath Guangzhou is already enemy territory. With the Bandits' military edge ascendant and the Court's position contracting, I fear the realm will struggle to mount a recovery for some time. The great gentry clans excel at reading the political winds—a single trace requires parsing five different meanings. My Liang family drifts further from the Bandits day by day. And our earlier actions were too hasty; the people we drew in were a mixed lot. Some even accepted Pseudo-Posts. Other families have surely detected much of my anti-Bandit sentiment. Such matters, under the Great Ming, would constitute conspiracy to rebel. Though each person may sympathize in their heart, a family's honor and disgrace hang entirely upon this. They will never implicate themselves in our affairs. When the day comes, I fear we'll discover no shortage of those willing to sell out friends for personal glory."

Speaking these words, Liang Cunhou couldn't help but recall how, in years past, producing a Liang family visiting card anywhere in Guangzhou had opened every door. A wave of melancholy washed over him.

*This world has changed.*

He sighed softly and continued: "In the past, when you and I discussed the Way behind closed doors, we felt the Bandits were uncultured barbarians, relying solely on strange techniques and excessive ingenuity, on the sharpness of their guns and cannons. Their civil administration seemed full of gaps, lacking any coherent system. We assumed their rule could not endure. Only now do I understand—the Bandits possess a different method of governance. And power is centralized. They can squeeze people however they wish. We, however, can only let ourselves be kneaded and molded. Our only recourse now is what the ancients called 'the brave warrior severing his own wrist.' We must immediately settle all accounts and withdraw our shares. Even losing some silver, we must cleanly sever ties with every shadow enterprise. This anti-Bandit business can never again be spoken of to anyone. Send away anyone involved. Burn all correspondence. We absolutely cannot let them seize witnesses or evidence. If matters come to a head, we can only admit firmly to tax evasion—nothing more. We cannot implicate anything else. If they demand fines, we pay silver. If they want favors, we send heavy gifts. We cannot resist directly. Even if it means breaking the family, we must survive this calamity. In hindsight, our greatest miscalculation was severing contact with the Bandits. We should have interacted with them insincerely, dealing with them through empty formalities. Under such flexible accommodation, we would have had far more room to maneuver. We could have probed their intentions. Now, however, we can only advance—not retreat—trapped in a dead game. Master Guo has been transferred back to Lingao. In an emergency, there's no one even to mediate."

Lin Zunxiu said in alarm: "Then—then what? We simply let the Bandits ravage us? We can only watch from the shore, let them slaughter as they please?"

Liang Cunhou's face twitched twice. Through gritted teeth, he said softly: "If we fight like a cornered beast, acting recklessly, we only give the Bandits purchase to grab. What we need now is to suppress with stillness. Crouch low, make ourselves small. Temporarily sheathe our claws and teeth. Even if we lose our commercial enterprises, the Liang family still possesses fine fields and paths, hundreds of clan members. Our roots remain in the earth. Moreover, Guangzhou is one of the realm's wealthiest regions—the Court cannot simply sit by and watch as it falls. Sooner or later, they must raise troops to crusade. And the Bandits seek to dig up the very foundations of the Teaching of Names. If the skin no longer exists, where can hair attach itself? You and I, as scholars, will never share sun and moon with these Bandits. When the day comes—when the Heavenly Army arrives—you and I shall donate our fortunes to raise the banner of righteousness. History's pen is iron: it shall forge for us brothers a wisp of loyal spirit!"

After seeing Lin Zunxiu out, Liang Cunhou felt as though the last trace of vital essence had drained from his body.

*Brother, it is your elder brother who has failed you.*

Guangzhou City Finance and Tax Bureau, Room 114.

Wang Qiyi stood at the head of the room, his gaze sweeping over each face before him. Compared to Yao Yulan's icy expression, Zeng Juan and Huang Ping displayed flushed cheeks and slightly flaring nostrils.

"Do you understand your respective assignments?"

"Understood!" The five naturalized cadres answered in unison, their standard postures suddenly reminding Wang Qiyi of the military.

"We want civil struggle, not martial struggle—"

*Ring ring ring...*

"Hello? Oh, Director Mu... Mm, mm, good. I'll have them proceed directly there as well—they'll meet at the taxpayer's location. I'm entrusting this matter to you. Thanks, thanks!" He hung up the phone. Wang Qiyi braced both hands against the table and spoke in a weighty tone: "The Police Bureau forces cooperating with us are already in position. I emphasize once more: the pistols currently issued to tax cadres are for *self-defense only*. If you encounter danger, retreat immediately—no entanglements. Matters involving knives or guns will be handled by the police. Our Investigation Bureau's authority for forceful enforcement has not yet been approved. Pay attention to *degree* when enforcing the law! Firearm use must be established strictly on the basis of 'self-defense.' Now—everyone move out."

"Yes, sir!"

Watching the task force members file out, Wang Qiyi walked briskly back to his own office. He pulled open the second drawer on the right side of his desk and withdrew a Glock 17. Then he fished out the maintenance manual tucked beneath it. Comparing his actions carefully against the instructions, he performed a thorough, unhurried maintenance of the weapon. When finished, he aimed it at the new Lingao wall clock that had recently been delivered.

"Little Li, go prepare the sedan. Have Little Hu notify Director Li Fulai. We're going to the Liang residence."
