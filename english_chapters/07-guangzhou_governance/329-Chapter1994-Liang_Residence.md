# Chapter 1994 - Liang Residence

Liang Cunhou frowned slightly, holding a tea cup that had long gone cold in his hands, sitting in the study quietly lost in thought. A wisp of clear breeze blew in slowly from outside the window, flipping open the newly carved poetry collection by the table gently, making a rustling sound, making today's wind seem particularly noisy.

The courtyard was quiet; not a trace of coughing could be heard. Still the old look of many years ago: green mossy rockery, verdant ancient trees, a pool of green water, and dozens of pots of orchids he loved most...

How long can this quiet ease remain? Liang Cunhou asked himself secretly.

The matter of Noble Gathering seemed to have calmed down, but Liang Cunhou, familiar with the Bandit's routines, still smelled the scent of mountain rain coming. Openly and secretly there seemed to be an invisible hand tightening slowly, making Young Master Liang feel breathing becoming difficult gradually, upset and distracted, yet unable to scratch anything, filling him with a floating insecurity of relying on nothing on four sides.

Maid outside door transmitted softly: "Lin Zunxiu, Young Master Lin came..." Liang Cunhou seemed to wake up suddenly, put down tea cup, let out a long breath saying: "Invite quickly. Need not go to Flower Hall; invite directly to Inner Study."

Not long after Lin Zunxiu walked in hurriedly. Did not politely exchange greetings upon meeting, simply placed a newspaper on desk head, saying straightforwardly: "Brother Liang please look, this is the new article "Crime and Punishment of Finance and Tax" published on Daily day before yesterday. Little Brother read carefully. Article wrote about various precedents and malpractices of so-called Australian Song taxation. Australians call them Cases and Interpretations. Voluminous and general, openly and secretly all mean one sentence: Pay tax according to law; hidden tax must be investigated. But according to Australian laws, the dark door businesses we participated in shares are all illegal businesses, all in list of striking and collecting. But among them Brothels, Gambling Dens etc. if passed bright road [legalized], let alone tracking back tax payment, confiscation, just this tumid criticism among villages how can you and I bear. And lacking this large injection of flowing water turnover, how to deal with Bandit people."

Liang Cunhou looked at window blankly, said after long time: "Zhao Juren came yesterday."

Lin Zunxiu stunned, asked: "What meaning for him coming?"

Liang Cunhou said: "Zhao Family and my Liang Family always friendly, having many silver money dealings. Yesterday however leveled accounts, and words flashing [evasive]. Fear won't have dealings with Liang Family for a while."

Lin Zunxiu said: "Why is this?"

Liang Cunhou said: "Zhao Juren said since obtaining Director Zheng's word wanting him to abide law and follow law days ago, he already reported family big small assets businesses to Finance and Tax Bureau, admitting punishment admitting payment. Yesterday came specially to apologize. Meaning outside words, want Liang Family to take care much, look after self well. Fear Bandits want to be unfavorable to us."

Lin Zunxiu raged greatly saying: "This soft-boned old man, this Bandit hasn't done anything yet, scaring him into such appearance!"

Hesitating slightly, Lin Zunxiu said again: "Not to this extent right? Bandits brag benevolence and virtue. Liang Family helped Bandits many times, and co-founded Charity Hall. When Wang Governor attacked Qiong [Hainan] gave Bandits many conveniences too. Can say having grace to Bandits. Such conduct wouldn't it make gentry scholars teeth cold [chilled/disappointed]? How to win people's heart gather talents in future? Without people's heart how to get world?"

Liang Cunhou sighed lightly saying: "Bandit's heart is in small people not in scholars. Severe laws and harsh punishments, treating scholars harshly, yet skilled in hundred crafts, refined in farming, communicating with merchants, prospering Pseudo-Learning. And foolish people mostly covet petty profits, know not Great Righteousness, sight not passing feet and inches. Thus mostly confused by Bandits. Although cannot collect heart of scholars of world, but Bandit soldiers and armors are refined and sharp—Ruler of Heaven, since ancient times belongs to those with strong soldiers and sturdy horses. What can a few scholars do? Australians have own scholars; need not use us! Bandits are just like Meng Yuan [Mongols] generally; fear only relying on bows and horses can also make Hua Xia smell of mutton [invade/rule China]."

Lin Zunxiu lowered head thinking; indeed so. Although Australians engaged some "Civil Service Exam" after occupying Guangzhou, many people thought it was "Australian Imperial Exam." But people knowing slightly knew, this basically wasn't any Imperial Exam—Imperial Exam is selecting Officials; this "Civil Service Exam" actually only recruiting Clerks. Not only conditions loose, admitted ones were even more Three Teachings Nine Streams, encompassing all. Speaking seriously, basically didn't put scholars in eyes.

Pausing slightly, Liang Cunhou picked up newspaper again, finger tapping newspaper making pa-pa sound, saying: "Brother Lin, I also read this article. Bandit heart is sinister. Time ago Bandits distributed Tax Law on newspaper widely, propagating what Paying Tax is Glory, Everyone Equal Before Tax Law, asking Scholars Farmers Artisans Merchants to pay tax as one body pay grain as one body. Totally not preserving scholar dignity. Yesterday published this rubbish again. Openly talking about how to punish violations of tax law regulations. Actually establishing heel first, standing on orthodoxy. Widely proclaiming and clarifying, then it isn't Punishing Without Teaching. Yesterday I heard some Tax Propagandist going door to door explaining doubts and confusions. After talking want every Family Head, Master, Shopkeeper, Accountant to sign and draw pledge. What is this? This is confession on public hall in other day! Knowing and offending, trying law with body, is Country Harm People Thief. Not paying New Dynasty's tax, not obeying New Dynasty's law, naturally cannot be New Dynasty's subject. So-called Manifesting Official Penalties, this is manifesting. Catching a few monkeys in future, fear will be Official Penalties—You look, they are unwilling to carry black pot of 'Punishing Without Teaching,' insisting on occupying reason step by step!" Finished speaking, Liang Cunhou smiled with self-loss, threw that newspaper on desk with a pa.

Lin Zunxiu heart cold as a sheet. Silent for half day, suddenly resentfully said: "Then, then what? Who in whole Guangzhou doesn't know Young Master Liang has great grace to Bandits. If truly having unbearable matter in other day, then let world see Bandits' coldness and thinness! See who in world willing to be Bow when Birds Gone [discarded tool]! Moreover Guangzhou scholars gentry though awed by Bandit's despotic power, many heart towards Court. Generations of Loyalty Filial Piety Integrity Righteousness imply wont sit and watch!"

Liang Cunhou shook head gently, saying: "Brother Lin, you see only Emotion. Others look at Situation/Power. Emotion though pitiable, Situation cannot be reversed. Since ancient times generations of Loyalty Filial Piety Integrity Righteousness defeated by hands of villains are uncountable! Today Guangzhou ground is already Enemy Country. With Bandit's soldier edge flourishing, Country situation shrinking, fear Court hard to have recovery strategy for a while. Gentry big clans value Wind Color [political climate] most. A trace of wind needs to smell five flavors. My Liang Family drifting apart from Bandits day by day. And time ago you and I acted with much haste, people pulled in good and bad mixed. Some even accepted Pseudo-Post. Causing families to detect much of my Anti-Bandit heart. This matter if in Great Ming is crime of Rebellion Conspiracy. Although each person heart towards it, but a gate of honor and disgrace all tied here. So absolutely won't involve own family into this matter. Thinking when matter happens other day fear no lack of Selling Friend for Glory generation." Speaking here Liang Cunhou couldn't help recalling Liang Family sending a visiting card on Guangzhou ground in past nothing disadvantageous. Involuntarily heart burst of melancholy.

This world changed!

He sighed lightly, said again: "In past you and I discussed Dao behind closed doors, only feeling Bandits boorish without culture, only relying on strange techniques excessive ingenuity, guns cannons sharp. Civil matters leaky hundred outs, not forming system. Ruling cannot be long. Today just know, Bandits have other method of ruling. And power in center. Pinching people much convenient as want. We however can only let people knead flat rub round. Plan for today only Brave Warrior Severing Wrist. Quickly level various accounts withdraw shares. Even losing some silver money must tear and smooth dark door businesses clean. Matter of Anti-Bandit absolutely cannot speak to others again. Handling persons also send out of Guangzhou. Burn all letters. Absolutely cannot let people grab human witness. If matter happens only can bite dead on stealing leaking tax money. Cannot involve other. Wanting fine give silver; wanting benefit send heavy gift. Cannot resist against it. Even risking breaking family must pass this calamity. Thinking now most miscalculation was breaking contact with Bandits. Really should have snake with emptiness [interact insincerely], circle deal perfunctory with them. Under flexible accommodation room would be much bigger. Also could probe Bandit intention. Now however only can advance cannot retreat, forced into dead game. Master Guo transferred back to Lingao. In urgency even mediating is no one."

Lin Zunxiu panicked saying: "Then, then let Bandits ravage? We can only sit watching from dry bank, let him slaughter?"

Liang Cunhou face twitched twice, gnashed teeth gently saying: "If we do Trapped Beast Fight, acting recklessly, only let Bandits grab painful feet. Now however need to Suppress with Quietness. Crouch low do small. Temporarily restrain claws and teeth. Even losing merchants goods, my Liang Family still has good fields paths, hundreds of clan children. Liang Family root not moved. Moreover Guangzhou is world wealth tax heavy land. How can Court sit watching losing land for long. Sooner or later must raise soldiers to crusade. Also Bandits want to dig my Teaching of Names [Confucianism] foundation. Skin not existing, where hair attached? You and I scholars definitely not share sun moon with Bandits. Waith till other day, when Heavenly Army arrives, you and I donate family raise righteousness. History Pen like iron, shall cast you and I brothers a wisp of Loyal Soul!"

Sending away Lin Zunxiu, Liang Cunhou seemed to leak last trace of Spirit Essence.

"Brother, it is Elder Brother sorry to you."

Guangzhou City Finance and Tax Bureau Room 114.

Wang Qiyi stood at upper position. Gaze swept over everyone's face. Compared to Yao Yulan's cold face, Zeng Juan and Huang Ping full face red nose wings flapping slightly. "Understood respective tasks?"

"Understood!" Five naturalized cadres' uniform answer and standard standing posture made Wang Qiyi suddenly think he was in army.

"Want Civil Struggle not Martial Struggle..."

"Ding Ling Ling..."

"Hello? Oh, Director Mu... Mm, mm, good. I let them also go directly there, merge at taxpayer place. This matter entrusted to you. Thanks thanks!" Hung up phone. Wang Qiyi supported on table with both hands, said with heavy voice: "Police Bureau police force cooperating with us already in place. I emphasize once again. Pistols currently distributed to tax cadres are for self-defense. Encountering danger retreat immediately don't have any entanglement. Moving knife moving gun matters police will handle. Our Investigation Bureau's violent law enforcement power hasn't been approved yet—Pay attention to Degree when enforcing law! Wanting to use firearms must be established on basis of 'Self-defense'—Then everyone set off."

"Yes!"

Watching subordinates task force members filing out. Wang Qiyi also walked quickly back to self office pulling open second drawer on right hand side of desk. Took out a GLOCK 17. Then fished out maintenance manual pressed underneath. Comparing instructions unhurriedly meticulously did maintenance for pistol once. Finished then aimed virtually at the new Lingao Wall Clock sent recently on wall.

"Little Li you go prepare sedan. Let Little Hu notify Director Li Fulai. We go to Liang Family."
