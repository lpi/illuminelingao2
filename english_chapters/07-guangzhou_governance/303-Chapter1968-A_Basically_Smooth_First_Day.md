# Chapter 1968 - A Basically Smooth First Day

Then he saw the woman scribbling on the paper with a very sharp dip pen, then standing up to place the paper on an iron platform, pressing down hard before handing it to him.

"This will do. This is the original Tax Registration Certificate, which needs to be hung in a conspicuous position in your business premises." The female cadre in the window said as she handed over a small booklet. "This is the duplicate. You must keep it safe; it will be used for handling many tax businesses in the future."

Steward Yan took it and opened it, finding the small booklet very exquisitely made. It was transcribed with various sentences in standard Song typeface that he couldn't quite understand. The paper also had watermarks, but the large seal in the lower right corner had changed to "Great Song Senate Guangzhou Special Municipality Finance and Tax Bureau Directly Subordinate Administration Bureau." What was the trick here? Steward Yan felt the Australians' twists and turns were sometimes truly incomprehensible to humans.

Putting away the new registration certificate, Steward Yan and Advisor Xu counted the various documents again. Only after feeling there were no omissions did they walk out the main door. Unexpectedly, before even descending the steps, they were surrounded by a group of people with square boxes hanging around their necks.

"May I ask if your tax payment went smoothly this time?"

"Smoothly, smoothly." Steward Yan knew these were Australian "reporters," and what they wrote would be published in the newspaper. This "interview" was also expected, and he definitely had to cooperate well. So he immediately put on a face full of spring breeze.

"Then how do you two feel the Australian Song Finance and Tax Bureau differs from the Usurper Ming's Taxation Office in collecting tax?"

"In this student's humble opinion: Great Song tax collection is, firstly, clear and transparent. Here and here," Steward Yan knew Australians liked "new vs. old comparisons" the most to highlight their "advanced nature." So he instantly composed an essay in his belly. Presently he took out the tax receipt and waved it.

"What was collected, for when, how much—it's all in black and white. Secondly, upright and honest. Without hiding from you all, this humble one prepared every kind of customary red envelope today," Steward Yan actually understood the Senate's requirements for cadres very well. He hadn't brought a penny extra today, but since he met reporters, naturally he had to flatter, "but didn't use a single bit. Whether floating surcharges, meltage fees, or straw sandal money—none of these existed. This is truly a Senate that thinks of us common people!"

"Then could you two stand for a moment holding the tax receipt and registration certificate?"

"Sure, sure." Steward Yan immediately held up the tax receipt with Advisor Xu, faces full of spring breeze, posing as if ten miles of spring breeze couldn't compare to them.

With a flash, even Steward Yan, who had seen this "camera," felt his legs go weak. He forced up his spirit to squeeze out of the crowd, not to mention Advisor Xu behind him who was already half-scared to death.

The first day's tax collection work entered the right track after more than an hour. Every window began to "digest" the flow of people at a similar speed. After a short rest at noon, by 13:43 PM when the last taxpayer left, the Guangzhou Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau Directly Subordinate Collection Hall had processed 64 registration transactions and 63 collection transactions. The extra registration was because the Zhang family, seemingly having received news from somewhere, handled separate tax registrations for their old shop in the city and their new shop at Da Shijie as independent enterprises.

Zhang Yu's "family separation" this time was thoroughly complete by current standards. Zhang Xiaoqi was somewhat surprised looking at the records on the tax registration stub register. Apart from the industry category, these two shops differed not only in name, venue, and business scope, but even the legal representative was different. This was also the only family among all large households to do so thus far. Currently, the Senate and Finance and Tax Bureau had no clear direction on future tax policies for group enterprises and related enterprises, nor did they have any support plans for small enterprises and new enterprises. Of course, with Zhang Xiaoqi's tax common sense and years of experience, she could guess these things would exist sooner or later. Moreover, tax categories and items couldn't continue to be so extensive; detailed policies and different tax rates for different enterprise types and business scopes would be inevitable in the next step. But for Zhang Yu to do this right now already showed quite the style of reasonable tax avoidance from the old timeline. Did he come up with this idea himself? No, this must be someone familiar with tax systems, and familiar with old timeline tax systems, to think of. Zhang Yikun—Zhang Xiaoqi couldn't help thinking of this person. Ai Zhixin had "informally" briefed this matter in internal meetings—could there also be a Zhang Yikun in the Finance and Tax Bureau giving "pointers" behind the scenes?

She immediately thought of Ai Zhixin—could this guy be "stealing while guarding"? From his designs on Nan Wan'er, one could tell he wasn't an honest man. But there were no women named Zhang around Ai Zhixin... this left her secretly puzzled.

Today's tax funds hadn't been tallied yet. Now every window was doing daily closing, abacuses clicking like crazy in the hall. To be honest, only a few taxpayers came to each window today; even Nan Wan'er at Window No. 1, the fastest, only handled 5 households. In Zhang Xiaoqi's view, the efficiency was simply outrageously low. Some of these girls had already started reconciling for the second time, afraid of making a single mistake. Fortunately, most collections were Delong checks filled out with amounts, saving a lot of trouble counting cash. It seemed the "daily deposit of business funds" and "cashless payment" promoted earlier were quite effective.

So Delong's entry must be implemented. Even if impossible temporarily, she must chase Meng Xian later to make him agree. Zhang Xiaoqi secretly made up her mind. Just thinking this, she saw some windows actually starting a third reconciliation.

"Everyone stop for a moment. Checking twice is enough." Zhang Xiaoqi immediately stopped this behavior. Being careful and responsible for one's work was certainly good, but this couldn't be maintained by disregarding efficiency and repeating reconciliation over and over. They must strive for success in one go. This was what her director taught her when she first started working years ago, and now she wanted to instill this awareness in these 17th-century girls.

"I am very happy with your carefulness and responsibility, but you must also have confidence in your own ability. Our work can't possibly be so little every day with so much time to check accounts over and over. Besides, we have to do summarization next. So I hope everyone strives to complete it in one go in the future. Now, those who have checked twice without problems can organize tax funds and vouchers, and send them to the accounting room for summary reporting."

There were many ways to summarize tax funds. In the old timeline, it could be classified by taxpayer, affiliated tax authority, tax category, treasury, etc. But here Zhang Xiaoqi chose summarization by tax category. This was naturally because the entire Guangzhou currently had only one tax management authority, the Guangzhou Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau Directly Subordinate Administration Division, and the treasury was only the Central Bank agency acting through Delong. Besides this, she had another unspoken reason: the couple privately believed this method was suitable for coping with upcoming government requirements.

Unlike hall accountants in the old timeline who were generally only one or two people or even part-time, in Zhang Xiaoqi's hall, the accounting room occupied one large and one small room, plus a voucher warehouse. The small one was the Voucher Accounting Room, with a total of three people.

According to regulations, tax receipts/tickets placed by window staff every day had to be registered for issuance here first. This batch of the latest Australian Song Finance and Tax Bureau tax receipts had a set of 19-digit serial numbers in the upper right corner of each receipt according to old timeline standards. The numbers were continuous, so when the voucher accountant recorded window staff usage, they only needed to register the starting and ending numbers. After daily collection business ended, window staff should organize their issued, unused, and voided tax receipts, then do a daily closing report at the voucher accountant's. The voucher accountant would compare accounts with actuals, and after confirming no errors, register the daily usage register. Unused ones could continue to be used by window staff; for issued ones, the first ply of the tax payment certificate (Tax Authority Retention Ply) should be properly kept by window staff after summarization in the accounting room, bound into books monthly, and submitted to the Voucher Accounting Room for retention and reference. If voided tax receipts had both plies intact, they would be recovered, bound, preserved, and registered by the accounting room. If errors were found in subsequent reconciliation requiring voiding, they had to wait for management personnel to recover the second ply (Taxpayer Tax Payment Certificate Ply) from the taxpayer before preserving and registering them together. Tax receipts were not allowed to be lost, altered, or damaged without cause. Window staff were not allowed to borrow or misappropriate tax receipts from each other, and tax receipts must be used sequentially according to serial numbers without skipping or breaking numbers.

Compared to the Voucher Accounting Room, the Hall Tax Accounting Room next door was much livelier. This didn't mean the atmosphere was lively with chatting, but that the sound of abacuses in this room was double the density of the windows doing daily closing just now.

This large room was fully seated with twelve people, almost equaling the number of window personnel. The scene looked big, but actual efficiency wasn't high. Zhang Xiaoqi was also helpless about this. If there were computers, one person could do all this work. But now, summarizing tax receipts sent from windows by household into summary receipts classified by tax category required too much manual labor just for one conversion.

Although Guangzhou had a "Computing Center," and Ai Zhixin originally held great hopes for it and had conducted relevant business consultations with Feng Nuo, they soon discovered the electromechanical computers of the Computing Center were large and clumsy, and truly inconvenient for the Tax Bureau to use—if nothing else, just card-ifying these tables was a huge task. So the Finance and Tax Bureau didn't pin hopes on "computerization" from the start, planning to use it only when doing data summarization and analysis.

The girls in the accounting room first received tax receipts and funds one by one from windows and checked if totals matched. Then, with two people per tax category, they passed tax receipts sequentially, registering the amount of the tax category they were responsible for on the register. Finally, they calculated the sub-total for each tax category and the grand total, comparing it with the total tax funds. After matching, they transcribed the tax category sub-totals from the register onto the "Tax Summary Payment Slip" in the format of one tax category per slip, completing the tax fund summarization work.
