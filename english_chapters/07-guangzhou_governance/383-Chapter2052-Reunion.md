# Chapter 2052 - Reunion

"I see... You need us to send someone? No problem... Oh, the Police Bureau is sending people too. Director Wu, you're making quite a move here... Haha, alright, no problem. I'll make sure they arrive within fifteen minutes!" Although Wu Mu's voice on the phone maintained its usual stiff coldness, Wang Qiyi still detected a hint of excitement. It was understandable—this was someone who'd been "exiled" as an external official. Now with such an excellent opportunity to distinguish himself, heightened emotions were perfectly normal. Moreover, this fellow didn't keep the spoils to himself—even at such a tense moment, he hadn't forgotten to notify the other departments to send people. Mm, he seemed like someone worth dealing with, Wang Qiyi thought as he scribbled out a note. His dislike of Yao Yulan also lessened somewhat.

"Everyone come in!" He called out at the doorway, summoning them all inside. Time was of the essence—things were pressing now, and Wang Qiyi dispensed with explanations. After briefly assigning the new task, he directed them immediately: "Second Team's Yao Yulan and Huang Ping, along with Team Leader Zeng, head to the assembly point immediately. Take this note—it has the meeting location. Go downstairs to get weapons and protective gear. Move quickly—you must arrive within thirty minutes!"

"Yes! Service to the Executive Committee and the People!" The three naturalized cadres clicked their heels together in unison and responded.

"Alright, hurry along. Stay safe, and let the police and Political Security take the lead in dangerous situations—we're not the American IRS..." Wang Qiyi waved them off and called to his guard outside the door, "Little Hu, go downstairs and prepare a carriage. Go with them—fully armed!"

After Yao Yulan and the others left, Wang Qiyi turned to Xu Zhewei and Chu Xiaoran: "We'll put the Shi family line on hold for now. Return the account books we retrieved from the Shi family's old store, and don't say anything else." Wang Qiyi paused to think. "Also, make sure you see Young Master Shi—that Smith fellow—and ask him if he'd be interested in attending the next batch of taxpayer training sessions. I or Director Zhang will be the lead instructor."

"Yes!"

After acknowledging the order, Chu Xiaoran asked somewhat hesitantly: "Is the bureau planning to go easy on the Shi family? If so, it would help us know what kind of latitude to use in our investigation."

"Shame on you for scoring excellent on every tax training exam," Wang Qiyi laughed. "Investigation and disposition are two different things. Investigation deals only with objective facts; disposition is where you calibrate latitude! The Shi family situation is somewhat complicated—it'll probably need to be reported up to the city and the ministry. There are more pressing matters right now, so we can't attend to them. For now, organize the Shi family materials and do as I said."

By the time Yao Yulan and the others reached the assembly point, the squad led by Lian Nishang from the Police Bureau's Public Order Section had also just arrived. The Political Security Bureau cadre waiting there verified everyone's credentials and notes without a word, then led them down a small path. Zeng Juan, out of habit, tried to make small talk: "Comrade, thanks for your hard work. May I ask your name..." He'd barely started when he saw Yao Yulan put a finger to her lips in a silencing gesture, and he hastily swallowed the rest of his sentence.

The group proceeded in this wordless silence. Fortunately, the destination wasn't far. Before long, they spotted a tall, graceful female cadre standing at the entrance to a small alley. The Political Security cadre leading them approached, stood at attention, and saluted. After the female cadre returned the salute, he turned and jogged into the alley. Throughout the exchange, neither spoke a word—leaving Huang Ping and Zeng Juan secretly amazed, wondering if everyone at Political Security was mute.

The female cadre stepped forward to shake hands separately with the team leaders Lian Nishang and Yao Yulan before finally speaking: "I'm Yang Cao from Political Security Bureau. Over the past few days, key targets have been arriving at the courtyard behind us, including some connected to the current stamp tax case. Leadership has ordered immediate arrest and expedited interrogation. Follow me."

With that, she turned and walked deeper into the alley, her sharp aura making Zeng Juan wince. In Yang Cao's view, this arrest operation was extremely simple—Political Security could handle it entirely on their own without any assistance. But since Director Wu had arranged it this way and specifically emphasized cooperation, there must be a reason. Her job was to execute well. Don't ask what shouldn't be asked, don't think about what shouldn't be thought—that was the habit Yang Cao had cultivated throughout her time at Political Security.

The riot squad from the Police Bureau was already in position. Unlike regular police, they were equipped with full-body armor and helmets, though their weapons were generally "non-lethal"—mostly shield-and-baton teams coordinated with long-pronged forks, plus gunners armed with shotguns and Hall-pattern rifles for suppressive fire. In National Police operations, the riot squad handled not just riot control but also some of the SWAT team's duties.

The riot squad leader was currently conferring with Yang Cao, while two members had the battering ram ready. Behind them, a line of officers were prepared to assault.

Huang Ping studied the small courtyard before him—an utterly ordinary Guangzhou residence, the kind commonly seen throughout the city. Yet its location was truly well-chosen, hidden in the outer suburbs beyond the East Gate. The front two rows were all residential, with the city wall behind. Without a guide, this place would be nearly impossible to find. Now he crouched beside Yao Yulan, his six-shot revolver already loaded. He could feel himself trembling slightly with excitement, and sweat was starting to bead on his skin.

The faint body fragrance emanating from Yao Yulan beside him made his thoughts wander. The last time they'd been this close was during training in Lingao. Huang Ping's marksmanship with the revolver had been abysmal—a strapping young man who simply couldn't steady the small firearm. His team leader Yao Yulan had no choice but to give him extra practice at the range after class. Once, apparently driven to exasperation, she'd thrown caution aside and embraced him from behind, gripping his wildly swinging arms and bellowing at him to hold steady. That time, Huang Ping truly did hold steady—and also committed to memory the soft, resilient sensation pressing against his back.

He stole another glance at Yao Yulan in front of him. She wasn't wearing "protective gear"—the Tax Bureau had borrowed several simplified riot suits from the Police Bureau, consisting of steel-reinforced rattan helmets, hardened leather chest protectors, and gloves. According to regulations, the Economic Major Cases Investigation Division could choose to wear them during field operations, but clearly Yao Yulan hadn't even considered them. Inspector Lian across the way had also only brought her revolver. Meanwhile here he was, a grown man—Huang Ping pushed at his helmet—feeling somewhat embarrassed in front of the women. But he quickly relaxed: that fellow Zeng Juan had the full kit—helmet, chest protector, gloves—and was posted at the alley entrance waiting for news. Wasn't that even more embarrassing?

"Report!" A shadow silently approached Yang Cao. "All the lookouts have been taken down."

"What about the dogs in the courtyard?"

"Dealt with."

"Good. Move out!"

At her command, two riot squad officers coordinated their movements and quickly scaled the wall. Moments later, the courtyard gate quietly opened from inside.

"We're moving in. Inspector Lian, have your people secure the side buildings." Yang Cao gave the low command, then led the group straight to the main hall.

Huang Ping rushed in alongside the riot squad. Once inside the courtyard, he saw two dead dogs lying in the yard—presumably dealt with beforehand.

Perhaps something outside had alerted those within. The main hall suddenly erupted in commotion—sounds of dragging and objects crashing. Someone was calling in a suppressed voice: "Hurry!"

"National Police! Everyone inside, listen up! You're surrounded. Resistance is futile... Leniency for confession, severity for resistance..." The Police Bureau was well-practiced in such matters. Seeing the door and windows barricaded, someone immediately began the "persuasion."

Of course Yang Cao and her people had no patience for lengthy negotiations with those inside—the shouting was merely a distraction. The riot squad had already crept beneath the windows with pepper tear-gas grenades ready, the breach team poised for action.

Yang Cao and Lian Nishang locked eyes, nodded three times in unison, then swept their hands simultaneously. Violent coughing erupted from within as the door was smashed open by the battering ram. Donning their masks beforehand, the team poured in and efficiently subdued the occupants, who were already doubled over with tears and mucus streaming.

"Hands behind your heads! Face the wall! Squat! One at a time now." Lian Nishang was well-practiced in handling such situations. Faced with the "short-hair" six-shot revolvers pointing at their heads, this group of criminals showed no inclination toward martyrdom, obediently squatting on the ground. A few who were already squatting didn't dare stand back up, waddling like ducks as they shuffled toward the wall—drawing quiet laughter from some of the young officers.

"What are you doing! No moving!"

"Stay still!"

*Crack!*

"You damned short-hair—mmph mmph mmph..." Just as the smoke in the room was dissipating and Huang Ping and the others were removing their masks, a burly man who had been squatting obediently suddenly exploded into motion. In his estimation, there were only two female "short-hairs" behind him—with his strength, knocking them down should be child's play. Then he'd seize their revolvers, and the situation might still be salvageable. But he'd barely moved when one of the female short-hairs locked his joint. Through sheer brute force he managed to hold on, only to hear the whistle of a club—a heavy blow landed on his waist, sending him stumbling back to the ground. They beat him with seventeen or eighteen strokes until he was utterly prone. His hands were pinned behind his back, and a rag from god-knows-where was stuffed into his mouth, its stench shooting straight to his brain.

Yang Cao approached, slowly squatted before the man, grabbed his topknot, and lifted his head. Then she pulled out a photograph from her pocket and began studying him carefully.

"You're the one..." Yang Cao released his topknot, stood up, dusted off her hands, and said to the Political Security cadre beside her, "Watch him carefully—don't let him kill himself."

Huang Ping, guarding the doorway, heard Yang Cao speak and turned to see what sort of person this man was—someone important enough to make Political Security's list. And why had that voice sounded so familiar?

But when his gaze fell upon the man's face, he froze completely.
