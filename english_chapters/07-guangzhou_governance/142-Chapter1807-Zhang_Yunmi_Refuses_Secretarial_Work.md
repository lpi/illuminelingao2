# Chapter 1807 - Zhang Yunmi Refuses to Be a Secretary

Lu Cheng answered the summons and entered—one look showed three officials in the office, including one young Elder about whom there had been considerable romantic speculation. Regarding Liu Xiang, Lu Cheng had already given up after Mentor Du's training. Of course, perhaps the bigger reason was the rumor that had spread after Guo Xier was taken as his concubine: that Elder Liu was a "lolicon." Clearly, Lu Cheng no longer met the loli standard. Moreover, she had by now lost much interest in marrying an Elder for "glory by association."

As the new team's "Women's Federation Director," there was actually little women's work to do. In newly liberated Guangzhou, clan authority and patriarchal authority had not yet been suppressed. Women's work simply had no implementation context. Instead, this "liberation of fallen women" movement happened to encompass both her Women's Federation and Political Security work. Today she was submitting a report on establishing a "Relief Institute." Having sensed something strange in the atmosphere when she entered, Lu Cheng said nothing more. She simply had Liu Xiang sign a receipt and voluntarily withdrew.

Shortly after Lu Cheng left, Ding Ding also took his cue to depart: "Well, Director Qiu indeed wasn't quite on point in grasping the spirit. I'll go back and give him a good tutoring session. You're busy; I'll take my leave first." Then came another round of courtesies. After seeing off the intruding Ding Ding, the office returned to tranquility. It was still transcribing documents and reviewing files as before.

*Snap!* Zhang Yunmi finally finished copying the correspondence that needed "carbon copying." She compared it against the original to ensure there were no transcription errors, then folded the document's head and tail toward the middle to align them. From her personal handbag, she took out her private seal and stamped it at the fold—Hong Huangnan's letter wasn't long, only one page. Multiple fold-stamps weren't possible, so she could only fold it in half and stamp once. Then on the copied text itself, she randomly selected several positions to stamp with a small "COPY" seal. Only then did she hand these two copies to Liu Xiang. Liu Xiang glanced over them to confirm nothing was wrong, then wrote the copying reason on the back of the letter paper. Finally, he applied his private seal beside his signature. With everything complete, Liu Xiang stuffed the letter paper into a special inter-Elder envelope already addressed, his mind wandering to other matters.

"Uncle Liu?" Zhang Yunmi once again deployed her lethal address appropriate to the topic at hand.

"Hmm?"

"I want to do some practical work." Zhang Yunmi decided to speak plainly. Despite using the title "Deputy Director of General Office," correspondence with Lin Ziqi had revealed that public opinion in Lingao still contained considerable voices saying she was doing secretary work, subjecting her to quite a bit of teasing from Lin Ziqi.

"Huh?" Liu Xiang's engineering mindset immediately fell into the cognitive trap: "The General Office Director's work is already very practical. It provides deep and broad exposure to governmental operations in Guangzhou Prefecture. Why would you call it impractical?"

"Well, I see that woman Lu Cheng doing quite interesting work lately. I thought perhaps I could—how to put it—go down to the grassroots?"

Liu Xiang heard this and was startled—young lady, do you know what "rescuing fallen women" work currently involves? Those reproductive system diseases don't necessarily only spread through genital contact! If you want to join that work, a certain German won't come knocking at my door with a gun? Little miss, are you here specifically to set me up?

He quickly deployed extensive biological terminology to explain to Zhang Yunmi the risks of going "down" to this particular "grassroots." This made Zhang Yunmi's face turn crimson, and she deeply suspected in her heart that this strange uncle was taking the opportunity to verbally...

After thorough communication, Liu Xiang finally understood that Zhang Yunmi essentially didn't want to continue work titled "Deputy Director of General Office" but essentially "Chief Secretary to Mayor Liu." He couldn't help scratching his head again.

Liu Xiang scratched his head not because of little Zhang's new request. His worry was: if little Zhang stopped doing this work—under the current system, Elders really could be this willful—then who would handle the current confidential work?

Previously in Qiongshan, confidential work had been given to Guo Linger—this was also standard Elder practice. What could be more reliable than a pillow-companion? Even if this proposition didn't hold, biologically speaking Elders still habitually entrusted classified matters to their life secretaries for management. Now Liu Xiang's life secretary had changed. Not only was Guo Xier an inexperienced hand, she was also someone who "couldn't learn." When he had her read correspondence to make summaries, she'd fall asleep before finishing one page. Furthermore, Guo Xier had a "loose tongue"—perhaps due to youth and inexperience, her speech could easily be maneuvered to reveal extensive secondary information. For example, on the first night Guo Linger sent her to bed, during his refractory period Liu Xiang had casually asked a question or two and she immediately let slip, revealing all of Guo Linger's previous advice about "you're young, childbearing isn't appropriate" and similar "caring" counsel. Another example: she was allergic to celery. When getting food at the cafeteria, normally one would just tell the server "no celery please," but she insisted on saying "I can't eat celery"—not realizing this statement revealed additional personal information. More tragically, if the server added a "why," she would honestly answer "I'm allergic, can't eat it"... Having observed her all the way from Lingao to Guangzhou, Liu Xiang had long excluded Guo Xier from his working hours. Otherwise he wouldn't have withstood pressure to accept little Zhang as secretary-general—there simply were no more "trustworthy" people.

But along the way, Liu Xiang had also discovered this girl actually had quite an interest in fashion design. The pattern templates used in school instruction she had already mastered in cutting. She could even sketch some self-designed templates in freehand—though peculiar designs like Zhongshan suit upper body with deep-robe hemline left Liu Xiang utterly baffled. But this didn't prevent Liu Xiang from supporting her continued development of this interest. In Hong Kong, he had urgently written to Lingao to order an experimental pedal sewing machine. He had also written to several Elders with fashion design talents and to some Hanfu enthusiast Elders requesting pattern templates, teaching materials, design drawings, and similar items. These materials had all arrived within a week of entering Guangzhou. Now Guo Xier spent every day in Liu Xiang's official residence doing her fashion design and tailoring, happily absorbed in her work.

Liu Xiang's thoughts had somehow wandered to Guo Xier, then naturally jumped to that youthfully innocent and delightful... *Ahem*, quickly pulling his thoughts back. Liu Xiang shifted on his seat to move closer to the desk, face seriously tapped his forehead, intoned "Well then..." before pulling a manila document folder from the right-hand drawer and handing it to Zhang Yunmi.

"There is actually one piece of work, though it needs submission to the State Council first. Once approved, then the team can be formed. Take a look at this first." Liu Xiang thought for a moment, then added: "Also, according to organizational principles, I can currently only assign you to 'primarily oversee' one area of work. I can't transfer you to a specific department. If you insist on that, you'll need to go through the Organization Bureau's procedures."

Zhang Yunmi gave a big-eye-little-eye style contemptuous eyebrow raise, unclear whether she was mentally opposing bureaucratic work styles. She reached out to accept the folder Liu Xiang handed over, and immediately saw the title on the folder: "Proposal for Establishing Cadre Training Institutions in Guangzhou."

"You know, our current cadre corps is generally stretched thin. Most current mid-level and above cadres are shouldering responsibilities incommensurate with their capabilities. Even with such underqualified cadres, there's still a shortage." Liu Xiang said. "This underqualification manifests both in professional competence and in political thinking. You've probably seen this batch's reports these past few days."

Zhang Yunmi nodded in agreement.

"And now, we urgently need to supplement with more grassroots civil servants. These all have to be recruited locally. These people are different from the cadres we brought—our influence here is limited, the information transmitted is distorted. So whoever is recruited will inevitably be deeply steeped in old thoughts and old concepts."

When they were on Hainan, "grand strategy" had always been controlled by the Elders. Even many specific tasks were personally handled by Elders. Naturalized cadres, apart from following along due to gratitude, ambition, and other personal factors, had little understanding of "why we do things this way" or "the purpose of doing things this way." Specifically, essentially all naturalized cadres lacked awareness of the fundamental question: "What kind of country are we trying to build?"

Agricultural cadres might know they were supposed to build their assigned area to look like propaganda posters. Factory naturalized cadres might know production targets and similar directive plans, might understand some technology. But few of them could explain why they were given such production tasks, such industrial arrangements—they lacked understanding of the overall Australian Song, of the entire industrialization endeavor. This wasn't obvious when the Council of Elders was confined to Hainan, because the Elders directed everything and naturalized cadres only needed to follow the baton. Questions they didn't understand could get Elder answers anytime—nearly every industry had Elders on the front lines guiding and participating in work.

But in Guangdong, the extreme shortage of cadres not only required everyone to be multi-skilled. To ensure Hainan Island—the world's only industrialized zone—could maintain stable output and technological development, the vast majority of Elders capable of guiding industrialization and nation-building had to remain on Hainan Island. The newly liberated Guangnan East Circuit, despite far greater population and territory than Hainan Island, could only muster some thirty-odd Elders scattered about. Including those working in Hong Kong, there were still only forty-some.
