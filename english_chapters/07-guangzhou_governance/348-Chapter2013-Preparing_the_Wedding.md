# Chapter 2013 - Preparing the Wedding

The matchmaking conference concluded successfully. Seventy-six couples registered in the end. The three Elders congratulated these freshly minted couples, fully embodying the routine of "simple conditions, lively atmosphere."

The matchmaking conference ended satisfactorily. Du Yibin and Wang Jun were quite pleased—though the matter had its twists and turns, it was accomplished in the end. And judging by the results, it wasn't just good, it was excellent.

On one hand, the propaganda agencies obtained excellent material. Qin Ruiyu was particularly satisfied, planning not only a special report and headlines for *Sheep City Express* but also a special extra edition to write this up extensively. It fully demonstrated the "benevolence" of the Council of Elders and greatly aided the Council's civil affairs work. On the other hand, this event genuinely solved the marriage problems of a group of naturalized citizens. Especially for personnel at the bottom tier of the naturalized hierarchy, although the current solution was a drop in the bucket, at least it gave others hope, stabilizing social sentiment. Moreover, through this event, it practically stimulated some natives and new naturalized citizens who held skeptical, wait-and-see attitudes toward the Council—since the start of matchmaking activities, the atmosphere among students at the Jiliang Institute had greatly improved. Once people had hope, their outlooks naturally transformed, far surpassing any amount of ideological work.

The next task naturally was to organize a glorious collective wedding for them, pushing this matchmaking event to its climax and bringing it to a perfect close.

While the three Elders drank and "celebrated" in the Elder's dining room at the Great World, they discussed the follow-up matters.

"A collective wedding is no problem. Even if finance has no money, we can go begging—ask local wealthy folks to contribute, consider it their good deed." Qin Ruiyu, seeing great propaganda value in this, suddenly became enthusiastic. "The real trouble is what comes after."

"What trouble? We've issued wives and held weddings for them; surely we don't have to raise their sons too?" Du Yibin had drunk a few extra cups of mulberry sweet wine, his face flushed.

"Raising sons isn't necessary, but what about bridal chambers?"

"Damn!" Wang Jun slammed his cup heavily on the table. "Forgot about that!"

The focus of Chinese marriage is the house, even in the 17th century. This involves both interest considerations and practical significance: if you can't live together after marriage, what kind of marriage is it?

The first batch of disabled naturalized citizens weren't a big problem; they enjoyed policy benefits, and once married, the Civil Affairs department would issue them an apartment. But this current batch were hardship cases.

"Don't they have houses in Lingao? Why resolve it in Guangzhou?" Du Yibin didn't understand.

"They do, but very few." Wang Jun, long in the factories, was much more familiar with naturalized citizens' living conditions than the farm-bound Du Yibin. "Most of these people are losers who couldn't afford houses in Lingao, mostly renting or living in dorms. After transfer to Guangzhou, they were all arranged in temporary dorms of various enterprises and agencies. You know those dorms—bunk beds for ten or twenty people in a big room. Fart and the whole room hears it. How can that be a bridal chamber?"

"But I heard there are single-room family dorms..."

"Those are arranged for already married naturalized couples, plus some so-called visiting family dorms. Can only be borrowed temporarily as bridal chambers."

"Damn, this problem is harder than raising sons." Du Yibin started scratching his head.

"We can't solve this alone—didn't they say a new district is being built on Henan Island? Will there be dorms built there?"

Qin Ruiyu nodded: "There is such a plan, and I heard a batch of dorms has started construction. But this collective wedding can't wait that long. Social news hotspots have continuity; once the moment passes, it's hard to create impact."

Wang Jun and Du Yibin were out of ideas—houses couldn't be conjured out of thin air. Besides, bridal chambers needed certain privacy and domestic functions; not easy to improvise.

Qin Ruiyu pondered repeatedly, then said: "I actually have an idea. Though not a long-term solution, perhaps it can make do for a year or so, waiting for the new dorms."

"With so many agencies flooding into Guangzhou, housing in the city is already tight. Where to find over a hundred rooms at once?"

"Rooms in temples and monasteries."

Du Yibin and Wang Jun's faces instantly showed an expression of "you are no ordinary mortal."

Although most Elders were atheists, they largely upheld the principles of "freedom of religion" and "respecting religious customs." They knew temples and monasteries had many empty rooms, but stuffing newlywed couples into "ascetic" religious venues to live seemed shocking to both Wang and Du.

"Don't look so surprised, okay?" Qin Ruiyu laughed. "First, renting out rooms is very common for temples and monasteries in this era. Slightly larger ones all have this business—monks in Beijing even run inns—it's hardly shocking. Second, there happens to be a batch of temple properties available for use right now."

"What temple properties?"

"You've been in Guangzhou so long, haven't you heard of Governor Liu's religious reforms?"

"Oh, oh, you mean that." Wang Jun suddenly realized. "The corporatization reform under the Three-Self principles?"

"Right. That's the one."

"Ah, actually didn't pay much attention to it..." Wang Jun was somewhat embarrassed. Du Yibin went to Enping upon arriving in Guangdong, so not knowing was fine, but Wang Jun had been running around Guangzhou.

"Putting aside the reform, did they confiscate many houses..." Du Yibin was enthusiastic.

"Don't rush." Qin Ruiyu waved his hand. "Let me start from the beginning..."

Liu Xiang's administration in Guangzhou naturally wouldn't spare the temples and monasteries holding vast land and property. His so-called religious reform's general policy was separating religious venues from assets, weakening their economic power. What Liu Xiang cared most about was "temple assets." Referencing the later Shaolin Temple approach: he reformed Guangzhou's temples and monasteries into "companies." Temples with licensed clergy registered as "corporate juridical persons," with assets including religious buildings, ritual implements, scriptures, etc., paying religious taxes and management fees. Non-religious temple assets like real estate, shops, and farmland were spun off as registered capital for identically named commercial companies, operating and paying taxes like ordinary enterprises. These "religious companies" were supervised by the Religious Affairs Office.

Thus, the Religious Affairs Office actually controlled substantial temple assets, including many rental properties.

"...Actually that's the minor part. Those properties are mostly rented out, few vacancies. Mainly, during the last cleanup of illicit cults and rectification of Guandi temples, quite a few properties were confiscated along with them. Now they're either temporary dorms or sitting empty—honestly, most aren't in great condition, but with slight repairs, arranging for a hundred couples to live temporarily is no problem."

"That's settled then." Du Yibin was greatly excited. "Just make do for a year or two."

However, their wishful thinking sparked debate when it reached City Hall. First was the wedding scale issue. Some Elders felt one event was enough, while others felt the numbers were too few and the scale should be larger; less than a hundred couples wasn't news, not even qualified for front page headlines.

"For local women, the grander and larger this wedding is, the more it will stimulate them to actively choose marriage with naturalized citizens. So we should turn this collective wedding into a city-wide celebration—the scale must be large." Liu Xiang also said.

"Male naturalized citizens eager to marry number far more than a hundred; adding all Jiliang Institute students wouldn't be enough." Wang Jun said. "The problem is, this is our first time running such a matchmaking activity. We should be cautious, not just chase scale. If hasty marriages lead to discord and incidents later, it won't be good."

Zhang Yunmi said: "Your matchmaking activity was just as hasty. Meeting and chatting for a few hours then marrying—what emotional foundation is there to speak of?"

Wang Jun was momentarily speechless.

Lin Baiguang smoothed things over: "This collective matchmaking itself has propaganda goals, to encourage more commoners to choose naturalization. The collective wedding even more so—it must be grand in scale to have good effect. How about this: there are quite a few naturalized employees freely dating at work. Under current conditions, organizing a lively wedding themselves is difficult. We could use this opportunity to absorb them into participating—after all, a collective wedding has Elders attending to congratulate, and the scene is lively and grand. They'll surely be willing."

"There are also some who haven't held ceremonies, just registered. At most treated friends and colleagues to a meal—they definitely want a grand wedding in their hearts. We can retroactively hold it for them." Zhang Yikun interjected—since the collective wedding would almost certainly be held at the Great World, he was particularly keen on it. He added many creative ideas: newlyweds taking flower boats for a Pearl River night cruise, fireworks, inviting the Plaid Skirt Club for performances, etc.

"What about funding? Making it so big, where does the money come from?"

"Didn't they say it comes from the General Office Special Fund?"

"The Special Fund isn't conjured by Xiao Zishan. In the end, isn't it still money from Finance and Taxation?" Ai Zhixin smiled bitterly. "There's only so much money; changing the name doesn't create more... Besides, the quota approved by the General Office isn't enough for you to spend like this."

"The money problem is simple," Liu Xiang thought for a moment. "We can't take on everything and raise a batch of Elder Council giant babies. We naturally will subsidize this matter, but the Council can't pay for everything—capable naturalized citizens should contribute part themselves. How about this: except for couples from the matchmaking conference, other participating naturalized couples follow the principle of voluntary registration without coercion. Participants pay a portion of the costs—specific amount to be determined by organizers after calculation."
