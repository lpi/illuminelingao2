# Chapter 2066 - Counterfeit Silver Dollars

"Isn't it said that the embossing is stamped directly onto the paper by a steel die?"

"That's exactly the problem—it's the die itself that defeats us," the foreman said. "We've tried several approaches, all without success. We've managed a few that look passable at a glance, but none that hold up to close inspection."

"This is a matter for Old Qiu to ponder further."

"I fear even he has reached the end of his rope." Hao Er paused, then added meaningfully, "You all must proceed with the utmost caution. Should the Australians obtain any of this, you may live long enough to earn money—but not long enough to spend it..."

"Understood!" the foreman acknowledged, then asked, "Master, what shall we do next?"

"Continue your experiments. As for the block-carving, I think we should have Old Qian pause for now—wood simply won't work. We'll need to find another material for engraving. In the meantime, trace out the pattern on the notes in complete detail—enlarge them and copy every element as clearly as possible. The more precise, the better!"

Hao Er emerged from the workshop and stood in the courtyard for a long while, silent. Hao An dared not speak and waited respectfully at his side.

At length, Hao Er spoke. "Hao An... do you think we were right or wrong to get involved in this business?"

Hao An lowered his head and considered before answering. "Is business not going well, Master?"

"If it were going well, would I need to ask?" Hao Er drew a deep breath. "Were it not for the debt of protection I owe Master Wang, I would never have accepted this. It should never have come to this!"

Hao An knew, however, that his master's reservations were more show than substance. Given Master Wang's power and influence, Hao Er could hardly have refused. Besides, years ago, when Hao Er's audacious forgery of official appointment documents had gone awry and fallen into an enemy's hands, it was Master Wang who had intervened and kept him out of prison—otherwise, his bones would long since have turned to dust.

"Master mustn't speak so despondently," Hao An said. "The winds of a thousand days at sea cannot all blow fair. This time, Stone Elder himself has dispatched men to assist—he knows the Australian enemy better than anyone. Perhaps there will be a breakthrough."

"You speak sense." Hao Er nodded. "Come, let us inspect the other place."

Master and servant left the courtyard, slipped into a narrow alley, and soon reached a dead end piled high with firewood. Hao An moved the firewood aside, revealing a small door in the wall. He knocked softly; a viewing slit snapped open.

Hao An raised his lantern to his brow, letting those inside see his face. Moments later came the sounds of bolts and locks being drawn back.

This was yet another courtyard. It was heaped with charcoal, and beside it lay a large pit filled with ash.

At the center stood an open-sided workshop, brightly lit and blazing with furnace fire. The clanging of metal on metal rang incessantly. Heat and charcoal dust gusted outward—all in all, it resembled a blacksmith's forge.

This was the back courtyard of a goldsmith's establishment. Work was proceeding apace; Hao Er's arrival drew no special notice from the busy craftsmen.

*"Make way! Make way! Molten silver coming through!"* At the shout, a glowing crucible glided along a rail suspended from the rafters, propelled from beside the furnace.

Hao Er stepped aside and watched as the silver was poured into a casting mold. Smoke billowed; the acrid smell of carbon-and-tung-oil scorch assaulted his nostrils. The foundry workers seemed oblivious. After a time, the silver cooled, the molds were opened, and row upon row of round silver discs tumbled out. An elderly, white-haired master carefully picked up one disc with tongs and announced, "Ruined! Recast!"

Hao Er intercepted him. "Master Qiu, what's the matter? This looks quite good to me."

"Ah! Master! When did you arrive?" The man called Master Qiu set down his tongs and fetched two exquisite silver dollars from a nearby table. "Master, please observe."

Hao Er waved him off. "I know nothing of such matters. Tell me, and I shall listen."

Old Qiu held up the first coin in his palm. On its obverse were the characters "One Yuan" in regular script, surrounded by wheat-sheaf designs. Below ran a smaller inscription: "Central Reserve Bank," along with several unfamiliar Australian symbols resembling tadpole script. On the reverse was a circular emblem trailing ribbons, surmounted by a four-pointed star. Most remarkably, the rim of the coin was milled with a ring of fine serrations—how on earth had they been inscribed?

"Master, this is one of the Australian one-yuan silver dollars now circulating in the streets. The manager had it exchanged from Delong Bank—fresh-minted currency. As you can see: the design is sharply defined, the surface flawless, without the slightest burr. Weighed, each coin comes to six *qian*, seven *fen*, seven *li*, and five *hao*; thickness is seven *li*, eight *hao*, one *si*, two *hu*, five *wei*; diameter precisely one *cun*, one *fen*. Assay shows it contains five *qian*, nine *fen*, two *li*, eight *hao*, one *si*, eight *hu*, five *wei* of pure silver—not quite ninety percent; roughly eighty-seven five on the touchstone."

Hao Er had heard these figures recited before. Old Qiu was the foremost expert in this line—an elderly man now, inclined to ramble—but Hao Er indulged him.

"Now please examine this one." Master Qiu exchanged coins. "How does the appearance strike you?"

This second coin felt similarly heavy in the hand—almost identical in weight. Under lamplight, both faces showed recognizable designs, quite close to the original. Yet the counterfeit's surface was less lustrous, bearing faint wave-like striations—the telltale ripple of high-purity silver known colloquially as "moire silver." What was normally a hallmark of quality became, in this case, an insurmountable flaw. The imagery, too, looked coarser; the serrations at the rim were uneven.

"This is nearly there—at least eighty percent similar," Hao Er conceded.

"It's the best we've made, but it costs us dearly." Master Qiu shook his head ruefully.

Hao Er understood at once. "This was chased by hand?"

"Indeed. We hired master engravers—top talent—and used ninety-seven five assay pure silver specially. Yet the result still falls short of the Australians' coins, which test at less than ninety percent purity!"

Hao Er studied the two coins, turning them over and over. The hand-chased counterfeit was not only rougher in finish but duller in sheen.

"The Australians' silver is plainly different from ours," Master Qiu observed. "See how the genuine coin has no moire pattern, not a single bubble—dense and solid. Ours is all moire and full of pores; we can't match its smoothness."

Old Qiu picked up another disc. "This one just came out of the mold—the die was engraved by those master craftsmen. But once cast... well, it's simply... simply..." He said "simply" twice but could not bring himself to finish.

Hao Er took the "silver disc." Its design was blurred, its fine patterns and inscriptions barely discernible. Worse, its shape was visibly irregular compared to the original.

"And the silver content?"

"Also ninety-seven five assay pure silver!"

Hao Er murmured, "Pure silver... Could it be that the Australians have added some unknown ingredient, which is why their coins cast so beautifully?"

"We considered that." Old Qiu brought out several more plain silver discs. "Master, please look: these are test pieces alloyed with varying proportions of base metals. The results... are no better than pure silver."

Moreover, they had discovered a vexing problem: silver coins cast from molds differed fundamentally from copper cash. Copper coins, once cast, might have burrs, but their size and shape generally conformed to the mold. Silver coins, cast under identical conditions, showed variations in both dimension and form.

"Master Li was once the premier craftsman at the Guangdong Treasury Mint; the molds he makes are uniform in thickness and size. Yet no matter how we try, nothing works. In the end, Master Li suggested we use genuine Australian silver dollars as a test—to see what method they actually employ. So we melted down a crucible-full of real coins."

"...And the result? The cast ingots were indistinguishable from our earlier attempts! It seems the Australians use ordinary silver—only they possess some secret technique for minting that we do not."

Hao Er turned the samples and finished products over and over, growing increasingly agitated. He had assumed the counterfeit coin operation would be easier. Surely, with skilled goldsmiths on hand, they could replicate designs well enough—eight or nine parts out of ten. Yet the reality mirrored the paper-currency side: negligible progress, not even the basic materials resolved.
