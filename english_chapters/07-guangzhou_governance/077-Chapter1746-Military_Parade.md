# Chapter 1746: Military Parade

Seeing the customers "recklessly discussing the state polity" and risking inviting disaster, boss Zhang of the tea house hurried to greet them: "Old customers, fresh out of the oven, this is the walnut cookie from the Zhang family. The Australians like it the most. Everyone, come and try the taste." Saying this, he asked the waiter to bring out a plate of walnut cookies for everyone to taste.

The walnut cookies from Zhang Yu's shop were like most shops in Guangzhou City; they closed for a day on the day the Australians entered the city and opened again in the afternoon of the next day.

"There's nothing special about these walnut cookies." These were all old tea customers, with mouths as picky as could be.

"It doesn't matter if it's special or not. The key is that it's imperially sealed by the golden mouth of the Australians," Boss Zhang said. "Even so, you have to book a few days in advance, or you can't buy it."

"I know this Old Zhang's Walnut Cookie Shop. It's a very small shop, although an old one. Business is just so-so—his family sometimes mixes in stale goods from the previous year into the walnut cookies sold. Only those greedy for cheapness or tea houses use his family's stuff... Don't know how it caught the Short Hairs' discerning eyes."

"Heard that Shopkeeper Zhang's son went to the Great World of Yifan and became a sworn brother of the Australians..."

Everyone showed a "suddenly realized" expression. Someone said: "Nowadays, as long as you are related to the Australians, you can always get good things!"

"A new emperor brings his own courtiers."

"Wake up from a sleep, and the world has changed."

...While talking, the sound of gongs rang out outside again. This time it was thirteen consecutive beats, "Civil and military officials, soldiers and civilians, all make way." Then came the shouting of the tithing head: "Everyone make way, the Grand Army is passing through the city!"

Boss Wang closed his fan: "Okay, let's go look."

Currently, the people in the tea house swarmed out, only to see that the streets were already crowded with commoners watching the excitement. The "official errand runners" maintaining order along the white line were now called "Detective Brigade." With their backs to the street and bamboo sticks in hand, they shouted prohibiting people from crossing the line.

Bursts of music came from far and near. This was the "The British Grenadiers" played with military drums and fifes, which the citizens of Guangzhou had never heard before. The sheepskin military drums were intense and high-spirited, and the fifes were melodious and calm.

Accompanying the drumbeats, a team of flag bearers appeared at the end of the street. The citizens of Guangzhou looked curiously at the blue Morning Star Flag and the red Iron Fist and Gear Flag, discussing what the patterns on them meant. As the eagle flag bearer of the South China Army appeared at the gate of the Great South Gate holding the military flag high, this speculation reached its peak.

Appearing with the eagle flag bearer was the Grenadier Company directly under the South China Army. They wore bright red grenadier uniforms, black "Bishop Hats" (mitre caps) decorated with golden cords and shiny brass plates. White canvas armed belts hung with leather cartridge boxes, canvas grenade pouches, and bayonet scabbards. Their tall stature combined with the "Bishop Hats" made each of them look like a giant.

They were merely the advance troops of the terrifying military demonstration. The troops that followed were so strong in military strength and imposing in power that it was almost unbelievable. The troops began passing at seven o'clock. Teams of line infantry wearing brass basin-style steel helmets and blue-grey uniforms were groomed very neatly, faces shaved clean, leather boots polished bright. Bayonets glittered in the sunlight. Four-column formations were serious and tight, appearing strictly disciplined. Next were the light infantry, also in blue-grey uniforms, carrying Hall rifles shining with raven-blue light. Their light military caps had hat bands that could buckle camouflage loops. Behind the light infantry was the Mountain Company, all Li and Miao soldiers conscripted from the mountainous areas of Hainan Island. Hanging machetes at their waists, carrying Nanyang rifles and poisoned crossbows on their backs.

"...My goodness, the Wokou (Japanese pirates) are here!" A commotion suddenly arose in the crowd.

The Japanese infantry of the Battotai (Sword-drawing Team), all wearing Jinbaori surcoats, bamboo conical hats, with dual swords inserted at their waists and carrying Nanyang rifles on their shoulders. Although short in stature, their whole bodies exuded the violent aura of serving as mercenaries killing for many years. Following closely behind was the Korean White Horse Team wearing white clothes and black big hats. Reasoning up the rear were the combat engineers, wearing rough canvas waistcoats and vests over their uniforms, carrying long-handled engineer axes on their shoulders, tool bags at their waists, and double-barreled shotguns on their backs. Each one was sturdy and powerful.

It simply dazzled the onlookers. They were used to the cumbersome and dilapidated "traveling robes" and "vests" of the Imperial Court's officers and soldiers, which were neither grey nor red, rusty armor and messy weapons. Where had they ever seen such new-style troops with neat attire, uniform steps, and high spirits? They couldn't help but secretly cheer: No wonder the Australians are invincible. Where in the world is there such a first-class strong army?

The drums rumbled, and the columns marched along Chengxuan Street. A sound of uniform footsteps, as if anything on the journey would be trampled to pieces.

The soldiers sang "The British Grenadiers" loudly, advancing and advancing, team after team, more and more. The crowd watching the march was silent, dumbfounded by the vast, endless, and exquisitely equipped nature of this team.

What surprised the crowd most was the convoy—the scholars and common people of Guangzhou rarely saw horses, let alone so many horses in the formation.

Gun carriages pulled by six horses with limbers, two-wheeled kitchen carts pulled by four horses, two-wheeled and four-wheeled baggage carts, two-wheeled/four-wheeled light carriages for officers... The wheels rolled forward on the stone slab road, sounding like thunder.

The massive convoy was mostly for show. They passed through the city and soon unloaded equipment at the newly built wharf of the Joint Logistics Headquarters by the riverside, loading it onto ships—on the march route, ships were the most important means of transport.

The marching columns of the South China Army walked for hour after hour, walking for the whole morning. It was not until nearly eleven o'clock that the last baggage cart left Chengxuan Street under the escort of the rearguard. As the whistle sounded, the "Detective Brigade" maintaining order on the street withdrew their posts, and the common people also dispersed in a hubbub.

Boss Wang, Mad Cow, and the others stood for half a day, having long digested the char siu bao and raw boiling congee. At this moment, their stomachs were empty again. Since one matter doesn't trouble two masters, they entered the tea house again to continue "drinking tea."

"I've long heard that the Australian soldiers are strong and horses are sturdy. Seeing is truly believing!" Little Boss Li asked the tea master to brew a new pot of Pu'er and praised.

Mad Cow said: "This counts for nothing. The Australians haven't taken out all their belongings yet. Just those fire-wheel gunboats that can't come ashore, one coming out would scare people to death—as big as a mountain! The masts are taller than the tallest tree!"

"The Australians' ships are sturdy and cannons are sharp, this has long been spread. just didn't expect their land forces to be so strong too. Truly first-class strong soldiers!" Little Boss Li sighed, "Just this spirit and energy, the government troops and Tartars are not opponents!"

"If the government troops were opponents, how could the whole army be wiped out in Chengmai back then..." Fat Shu said, "At that time, the Australians didn't have many troops yet."

"I see this Guangdong of ours is going to become the territory of this 'Australian' Song."

...

Everyone talked for another half an hour or so, and finally dispersed one after another. The fat man strolled a few blocks shaking his white paper fan and entered a small shop with the sign "North and South General Goods." The assistant greeted him enthusiastically. "Boss is back."

"Mm." The fat man sat on the counter and lit a pipe. "Did today's stuff come yet?"

"It's at the old place."

The fat man opened the fourth drawer under the counter and took out an unsigned and undated letter. After opening the letter, he counted, nodded with satisfaction, and then put the circulating notes in the letter into his bosom.

After the demolition of Chengxuan Street and the "Military Parade," Liu Xiang suddenly felt the work in his hands was much smoother. Countless visiting cards were piled on his desk, all from the local gentry and big households seeking an audience. Some who felt they were not qualified enough to seek an audience also sent a full card with heavy gifts to show solemnity.

The gifts sent under the corridor of the central courtyard of the original Guangzhou Prefectural Yamen, ranging from bolts of silk and satin, white rice and flour, to small packages of dim sum and fruits, various cultural relics, calligraphy and paintings, jewelry and jade articles... and sealed silver, were all guarded by special personnel from the Planning Commission, piled all over the corridor, looking exactly like a general merchandise trading warehouse about to ship goods. Liu Xiang asked the people from the Planning Commission to register them into the warehouse. For some things, a sum was allocated on the account and given to the Guangzhou Municipal Government for use—he really needed these things for expenses now.

However, the key lay in who to see and who not to see. Liu Xiang was now so busy that he wished he could clone himself, so naturally he wouldn't meet them immediately. He asked Zhang Yunmi to organize the sent cards, separating them into four categories: "See immediately," "See in the near future," "Can see," and "Don't see." As for the basis, it was the "Guest Book" transferred from the Guangzhou Station. It listed in detail the specific situation, closeness of relationship, depth of cooperation, and size of contribution to the Guangzhou Station of the gentry and big households who had dealings with Purple Kee Enterprise on ordinary days. Also used as reference materials were some background data on Guangzhou gentry and big households provided by Lin Baiguang.

"Little Zhang, just categorize the cards according to these materials. There are special people to write the reply cards, you don't need to worry. If there is anything you don't understand, ask Sister Zheng Ah..."

"Okay..." Zhang Yunmi said okay, but actually looking at the pile of big red full cards and accompanying gift lists on the table, she decisively sucked in a breath of cold air. How many are there! Moreover, she was already bad at traditional characters and classical Chinese reading at Fangcaodi School, especially these 17th-century traditional characters made her even more confused.

Liu Xiang could originally have given this matter to Lü Yizhong, but he suspected that Lü Yizhong would have personal goals when classifying, so he didn't dare to fully entrust him at this critical node. It was more reassuring to hand it to one of their own.

After Liu Xiang assigned the new task to Little Zhang, he turned his attention to the household census work.

The household census was more difficult than imagined. The Great Ming not only had no such thing as house numbers, but also no perfect street naming system. The main streets and alleys were okay. Many back streets and humble alleys had no names. Although there were tithing heads and runners familiar with the local situation to lead the way, entering households for registration still encountered many difficulties. Liu Xiang had to concurrently serve as the "Place Name Committee" work himself.
