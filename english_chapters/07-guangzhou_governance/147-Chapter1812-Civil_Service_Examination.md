# Chapter 1812 - Civil Service Examination

Li Ziyu glanced inside at the bustling construction scene and said: "It's fine. Brother Zhang's family is doing renovations—I'll just stand here and chat."

"I'm truly embarrassed. Please forgive me, Brother Ziyu... These past days have been absolutely exhausting. The chiefs want us to expand production scale. They're telling us to take out loans to enlarge our storefront, and they're having us open retail outlets with this 'front shop, back factory' model. Just looking at loan policies is making my head spin. And our space is too small—we need to find a new location..."

Half a month ago, Zhang Yu's father, accompanied by Zhang Yu, had gone to the Grand World. Ostensibly to "pay respects"—the Zhang family's walnut pastry shop was now booming business. Zhang Yu's father wanted to go thank Chief Hong. They didn't get to see Chief Hong, but met Zhang Yikun instead. After a brief conversation of three or four sentences, by the time they emerged, the Zhang family had already signed a loan agreement with Delong.

Once home, father and son felt something was off. They had had no intention of expanding production. Even the shop renovation had been reluctant. Yet somehow they'd signed a loan contract in a daze—not just renovating the old shop, but also opening new stores and workshops.

But by then it was too late for regrets. They had no choice but to forge ahead.

Finding land wasn't too difficult—there were plenty of empty lots and vacant buildings in the city. Zhang Yu thought that if opening a shop, the location was crucial. Good locations were also hard to find. Achieving a "front shop, back factory" layout would be challenging. Their old family shop not only had good location but also three generations of reputation with some small fame. Better to keep the main store there.

But keeping it there meant expansion required space, plus living quarters. The plot felt cramped. None of the neighbors were selling currently. After much deliberation, father and son finally decided to move the family out, converting the entire residential shopfront into a "front shop, back factory" layout, with only simple dormitories inside for apprentices and workers.

This being a major undertaking, finding a house, moving, demolishing buildings... this whole series of tasks had to be completed even while finding temporary production facilities to maintain supply. Fortunately, Director Zhang was very generous, temporarily lending them a vacant space in the Grand World for production.

Beyond the transition space, the Elders' care was practically "meticulous": the bank loan's procurement expenses had designated suppliers. For instance, decoration and construction work was entirely introduced by Delong—very few contractors in all Guangzhou knew how the Australians built and decorated—for example, this tiling work for floor and wall tiles, only two or three contractors with connections to the Grand World and Ziji could do it. Since Delong was willing to designate, the Zhang family father and son were happy to keep things simple.

Beyond construction contractors, equipment also had to be ordered from Lingao. One thing led to another, and this loan wasn't very generous at all.

"...This loan amount is really substantial," Zhang Yu said worriedly. "Though annual interest is only 18 percent, I'm always afraid of some mishap..."

Actually, he was somewhat puzzled, because the loan money he hadn't actually seen: Delong gave him something called a checkbook, like an accordion-fold thing. When contractors finished a job, Zhang Yu's father would fill in the amount according to the "contract" documents, sign his name, tear it out, and that counted as payment.

The Zhang family as petty bourgeoisie naturally hadn't dealt with bills and notes in daily life, but roughly knew such instruments existed. It's just that the money units on their Australian notes weren't *liang* or *wen*, but "yuan."

Speaking of "yuan," Guangzhou residents had some concept of "Australian circulation vouchers." Zhang Yu naturally knew about them too. He wondered if this was the Australians' "circulation vouchers."

Whether circulation vouchers or not wasn't too concerning, since contractors and suppliers all accepted the checks. The question was how to repay the loan—where would Guangzhou get circulation vouchers? And how many circulation vouchers per tael of silver, Zhang Yu had absolutely no idea.

"You know the Australians... no, the chiefs—they love big factories and hate small workshops. Naturally these investments have to be large. But since the chiefs picked your family as a demonstration..." Brother Zhang, your family's about to rise to great heights! Congratulations!"

The Australians never stopped talking about "industrialization" and "scaling up." Magazines and newspapers mentioned it constantly. For the few good brothers familiar with "Australian learning," this was all too familiar theory. This last sentence cheered Zhang Yu somewhat. He smiled:

"Ha ha, oh stop, stop."

"Young Master Zhang! Please come in a moment—can you look at where to put these tiles?"

"Alright, alright, I'm coming."

Li Ziyu saw he was very busy and quickly said: "Go on in and get busy. I'm going to find Zeng Juan."

"Zeng Juan's been preparing for the Australian civil service exam lately. You going over is perfect to help him plan. Today I'll have to be a poor host. Next time I'll treat you to tea, Brother Ziyu." As he spoke, Zhang Yu clasped his hands.

"No worries at all—don't be so formal." Li Ziyu saw his family's business flourishing and prospering. Though not his own affair, his heart felt cheerful. Strange indeed—ever since the West River adventure escaping back to Guangzhou, the bond between him and these brothers seemed to have grown ever deeper.

Zeng Juan was currently sitting in his room looking at the *Yangcheng Express*' latest recruitment notices. On the table were piled examination syllabi and the *1635 Great Song Civil Service Exam Question Bank*.

In Guangzhou's summer heat, just sitting on a bench was a form of torture for Zeng Juan. To escape the heat, he sat barefoot, feet soaking in a basin of cool water, slowly flipping through the newspaper. Occasionally glancing at the exam syllabus.

The setback of his previous police exam attempt had greatly impacted Zeng Juan. He had originally thought that as a scholar, he could easily enter the Australian authorities and secure a position. But the Australians hadn't shown even a sliver of special interest in him. Meanwhile, Li Ziyu's news that the police bureau was full of instructors transferred from Lingao made Zeng Juan feel an acute sense of crisis. Obviously the Australians preferred using their own trained people...

Someone with his scholarly weakness probably wouldn't catch the Australians' eye.

Just as Zeng Juan was despairing, a Guangzhou municipal government civil service recruitment notice rekindled his hope.

"There truly is a way when all seems lost... I thought I, Zeng Juan, would spend the rest of my life making candles..."

So Zeng Juan bought a stack of syllabi and question banks according to the notice's exam requirements. This complete set cost a full four taels of silver. Though not cheap, it wasn't much more expensive than the Thirteen Classics and various essay collections used in private academies. Plus Zeng Juan had pooled resources with former classmates to share some books, so his parents' expressions weren't particularly sour. But they also knew this was their son seeking advancement, so they gritted their teeth and paid up—at least they didn't have to take out "exam loans" from Delong like some "exam friends."

The books were bought, but reading wasn't easy. Not only were they in simplified characters, even the font direction and book format were different from before. Not to mention the writing style. Many people couldn't even figure out how to read them at first. This was where Zeng Juan's past reading of "Australian books" paid off—he read without difficulty, understanding the meaning far more thoroughly than others.

The Australian departments and positions still gave Zeng Juan headaches though. This Australian civil service exam was an unprecedented new thing with no precedent to follow, making targeted preparation impossible.

"If only Big Brother Huang, who knew Australian affairs so well, was still here. Now there's nobody to consult with..." Zeng Juan sighed lightly and continued randomly flipping through books.

"Brother Zeng, are you in?" Just then, Li Ziyu's voice came from outside, making Zeng Juan's eyes light up.

"Here! Here!" Zeng Juan didn't even bother drying his feet but practically charged out of the room to receive him. "Long time no see, Brother Ziyu! You've been well?"

"Shamefully, I haven't visited you brothers all this time. How has Brother Zeng been lately?"

"Brother Ziyu working at city hall as an official—that we brothers haven't been forgotten is precious enough."

"Brother Zeng, those words—do I, Li Ziyu, look like such a sycophant to you?!"

"Ha ha ha, absolutely not. The Elder Council took over Guangzhou with a hundred things to do. The police bureau must have endless matters. Just this Patriotic Hygiene Month alone probably wore you all out."

"If you know that, why say such things? I think you're itching for a beating?!" Li Ziyu said, making a mock-threatening fist.

"Officer Li, I was wrong. Don't arrest me, I'm a law-abiding citizen of Great Song."

After some teasing, Zeng Juan invited Li Ziyu inside.

"Hey! Zeng Juan, you're really working hard! All these books—I never saw you this diligent back in the academy!" Li Ziyu pointed at the pile of books on the table, laughing. "I heard from Zhang Yu you're taking the Australian civil service exam?"

Zeng Juan brewed a pot of cool tea and handed it to Li Ziyu, then said: "Before I didn't feel there was any hope. Those moral essays I wrote—thinking I could get some minor position with them was pure fantasy. But with the Australians here everything's fresh and new. Even this civil service exam is novel. Though I failed the police exam, I still want to try again."

"Indeed, Brother Zeng is right. Great Song is truly different from the former Ming in every way, and there are lots of opportunities too. The chiefs say failure is the mother of success. With Brother Zeng's intelligence and talent, you'll surely have a brilliant future."

"Brother Ziyu is too kind. First I need to pass this Great Song civil service exam... Brother Ziyu, I actually have some questions I'd like your advice on."

"The chiefs say us scholars are all pedants. I didn't think so before, but now I really find it unbearable... Ask away. Whatever I know, I'll tell you."

"It's the Great Song government's positions—I can't figure them out. I don't know which to choose. This recruitment seems to be all for clerk-level positions. I'm not sure which has better advancement prospects. I even specially re-read some Former Song historical materials but found nothing useful..."
