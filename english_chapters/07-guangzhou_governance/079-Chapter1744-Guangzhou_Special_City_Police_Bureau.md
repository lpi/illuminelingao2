# Chapter 1744: Guangzhou Special City Police Bureau

Jia Jue couldn't find this Wang Daniao (Big Bird Wang)—this was originally his nickname, but over time it became his name instead—asked the neighbors, who said no one had been seen entering or leaving here for several days.

Jia Jue cursed secretly in his heart. The Chief regarded the matter of dredging and opening ditches so importantly. As a clerk of the Household Division, he couldn't find the crucial person. Wouldn't this leave an impression of "ineffectual handling of affairs" on the Chief?

If he had known earlier, he should have kept a close watch on this fellow Wang Daniao as soon as the Chief entered the city—he had also come to register during the roll call.

Since he couldn't find him, Jia Jue had to go back and report truthfully to Liu Xiang.

In fact, this Wang Daniao was still in Guangzhou City. After the incident of torture to force the handover of the Fish Scale Books occurred, he was worried that the Australians wouldn't let go of the Canal Map in his hand. This Canal Map was a treasure! Although he hadn't done anything illegal or committed crimes that angered heaven and people, this Canal Map was an ancestral cash cow. The capital for the whole family to eat and drink well, and the rice bowl for generations of descendants all depended on this map. If he handed it over, wouldn't there be nothing left soon? He would also have to stick his butt up to dig ditches and dredge silt—his family hadn't done this for many generations.

The demolition of Chengxuan Street made him realize that the Australians would sooner or later need to use the Canal Map in his hand. He was unwilling to hand it over, but the Australians had plenty of ways to make him hand it over. As soon as Wang Daniao thought of suffering the pain of torture instruments, he hurriedly took his family and slipped away.

Wang Daniao had a small estate in the countryside, but he didn't hide in the estate—this place was no secret to people in the yamen, and someone would definitely report it.

Fortunately, he still had a connection. That was, he was a sworn brother with a "Big Bone" in the "Guan Di Temple people" at the Great North Gate suburb—many of the laborers used for opening ditches and dredging were temporarily recruited from beggars, and he was very familiar with them. So he took his whole family to seek refuge with him, and was now hiding in a residence outside the city gate suburb.

When the Australians were at their wits' end, they would naturally send someone to send a message to negotiate with him. Pulling chestnuts from the fire was dangerous, but wealth and honor were always sought in danger. One must know that without this Canal Map, the Australians couldn't even think of finding all the open and hidden ditches in the city. Even if your ships are sturdy and cannons are sharp, what can you do? It's impossible to lift Guangzhou City open!

After receiving the report, Liu Xiang immediately instructed Lin Baiguang to mobilize the police and Detective Brigade to search the whole city, drawing portraits and arresting at various city gates. Wang Daniao's estate in the countryside was also searched, but not even a shadow of a person was found.

Without the Canal Map, the specific distribution of ditches and canals in the city would be difficult to know. It would depend entirely on manual patrolling and inspection, and the workload would be huge.

Liu Xiang was helpless. He deeply felt that the complexity of managing a 17th-century city far exceeded his imagination. Since the shortcut couldn't be taken, the only way was to break it with force. He immediately shifted the focus of municipal work to household surveys. Fortunately, Mu Min arrived at this time.

There had been a discussion within the National Police about who would be the Director of this Guangzhou Special City Police Bureau. Obviously, the so-called Guangzhou Police Bureau Director was actually also the Chief of the Guangdong Police Department, considered a regional high official in the police system. Unlike being a section chief in the headquarters organ, not only was the power great, but the responsibility was even greater. Doing it well would lead to an immeasurable future.

Originally, Ran Yao intended to send a male Senator—Guangzhou was a newly occupied area, and as the person in charge of a forceful organ, the work intensity could be imagined. But the Executive Committee's opinion was to let Mu Min go. The apparent reason was that Mu Min's service experience was comprehensive: she had done public security, criminal investigation, and stayed in the Political Department for a year. It was just right to go to deal with a complex new environment like Guangzhou. But it was said that the real reason was to "promote gender equality."

So Mu Min came to Guangzhou and became the top leader of the police department.

The backbone of the Guangzhou Police Bureau was naturalized citizen police transferred from Hainan, totaling only one hundred and fifty people. Part of these people were police officers recruited from naturalized citizens. Among them, those with the longest qualifications had almost five years of police service, and some had already become police station chiefs. They had rich work experience, but their professional knowledge was relatively lacking. The other part were cadets who had just graduated from the Police Administration Class. They all received formal police education of the Lingao system but lacked work experience. The common problem was that they were not very familiar with Guangzhou. Many people knew nothing about Cantonese. This caused great trouble in carrying out work.

As soon as Mu Min moved into the Guangzhou City Police Bureau—the original Lingao Circuit Yamen—she immediately convened a meeting of all naturalized citizen police to roughly understand the public security situation in Guangzhou City and the current work content. In Mu Min's view, the work these few days felt a bit like treating the head when the head aches and treating the foot when the foot hurts. Roughly, the police organ was used as an execution tool, and many key affairs were not started. Even the basic team of the police organ hadn't been set up.

Naturally, Liu Xiang couldn't be blamed for this, nor could Lin Baiguang. This was entirely the pot of the police organ itself. Mu Min now not only had no qualification to complain but also had to fully cooperate with their work while improving her own work.

However, Liu Xiang and Lin Baiguang had done at least two things well. First, they stabilized the team in the reception of old clerks, so that the old public security personnel of Guangzhou Prefecture and its two counties were basically mastered in the hands of the new regime, preventing them from scattering to do evil, and also providing usable manpower for the newborn police organ. That this super-large city of the 17th century, Guangzhou, could maintain roughly stable public security, the work of Lin Baiguang's Comprehensive Governance Office contributed greatly. Second, they completely mastered the archives of Guangzhou's tithing personnel, firmly grasping this most grassroots social organization.

Village heads (Lizheng), Bao chiefs (Baozhang), Tithing heads (Paijia), Resident Group Leaders... although called differently, the role played in social management was the same. To do public security work well, an effective Baojia system must be established.

Because of social chaos at the end of the Ming Dynasty, it was a climax of China's Baojia system construction. Guangzhou's Baojia system was also considered quite perfect. Under the current situation of serious shortage of police force, to improve public security, it was nothing more than doing "mass prevention and mass governance," and this policy had a direct relationship with whether the Baojia system was perfect.

So her first thing was to ask Liu Xiang to transfer part of the archives stored in the archive repositories of the Prefecture and County Yamens over. Part of the clerks' division archives among them were especially valuable to her.

The personnel system of Lijia, Baozheng, rural officials, etc. of the whole prefecture and county, as well as the archives of clerks and runners in the yamen, were all managed by the Clerks' Division. All appointments, removals, promotions, transfers, and salary increases had to pass through their hands. Mastering this part of the archives was tantamount to mastering the detailed situation of these most grassroots personnel.

Now Liu Xiang wanted to carry out household surveys to clean up household registration, which was a good opportunity to fully master this system. A perfect household registration system was indeed a key point of police work.

Mu Min immediately set out to establish the Guangzhou Special City Police Bureau.

The new Guangzhou City Police System temporarily did not set up branch bureaus within the territories of Nanhai and Panyu counties. The Municipal Bureau commanded various police stations, and other counties established county bureaus.

She temporarily had no time to attend to the branch bureaus of various counties, focusing her main energy on the Municipal Bureau first. According to the principle regulations in the organization ordinance, the Guangzhou City Police Bureau established the Administration Division (governing Household Registration, Public Security, Traffic, and Health Sections), the Justice Division (governing Criminal Investigation, Interrogation, Forensic, and Clerical Sections), and the General Affairs Division (governing Internal Service, Training, Discipline, and Archives Sections). The institution was relatively simple with few levels.

She took over the Detective Brigade and related clerks originally commanded by the Comprehensive Governance Office and reorganized them. Part of the people were adjusted and enriched into various departments according to their specialties. In this way, the police institution was quickly established. The remaining Detective Brigade personnel were also adjusted. Part of the personnel formed the uniformed "Uniform Squad," responsible for street patrol; the other part formed the non-uniformed Plainclothes Squad, acting as eyes and ears in the urban areas and four suburbs.

As for the police stations in various districts, her view was the same as Lin Baiguang's. Before having detailed household registration data, there was no rush to establish formal police stations. But to ensure public security, several temporary substations were set up in the city to station police forces. So that police could be dispatched in time when there was a police alarm. At the same time, fire and public security lookout points were set up at high places such as Double Gate Tower, Zhenhai Tower, Wuxian Temple Bell Tower, and various city gate towers. Signals were transmitted using mirrors, flag semaphores, and smoke/fire.

Using the National Army as the main force, a full-time Riot Mobile Unit was established, stationed at major traffic nodes in the city and various city gates respectively, ready to move out at any time. The Uniform Squad of the Detective Brigade patrolled in groups and sections, while the Plainclothes Squad dispersed to various places in the city.

The next thing, Mu Min planned to take over the "street watchmen" throughout Guangzhou City.

The street watchmen were responsible for opening and closing street gates and beating the watch for night patrol. In fact, they did grassroots public security work. They hung out on the streets for a long time, knew people well, and knew a lot about the lower-class society. Even if this part of people were not incorporated as police officers, they should at least be managed by the police bureau. This was also a component of mass prevention and mass governance.

However, Lin Baiguang expressed a different opinion—as the Director of the Comprehensive Governance Office, although he was parallel to Mu Min, in many practical affairs he exercised Liu Xiang's functions and powers. So many things Mu Min wanted to do had to be discussed with him.

"This matter is not urgent." Lin Baiguang said, "Street watchmen are beggars on the surface, but actually they count as gang members."

Saying this, he introduced the situation of the Guan Di Temple people to her.

"...The Guan Di Temple people are called beggars, but actually they are the largest dark force in Guangzhou City. Our incorporating street watchmen is reaching out into the sphere of influence they have controlled for a long time, which will inevitably cause their strong backlash. Although we have guns in our hands..."

"I understand," Mu Min immediately understood his meaning, "We are not too clear about their details. Cutting the grass without removing the roots won't work."

Lin Baiguang nodded. Speaking with smart people was relaxing: "Yes, not only that. The Guan Di Temple people's penetration into the lower-class society is very deep, which can be said to be intertwined. They actually control many aspects of urban management and operation work. If they stand up against us now, many tasks will fall into passivity when we possess insufficient manpower and incomplete institutions."
