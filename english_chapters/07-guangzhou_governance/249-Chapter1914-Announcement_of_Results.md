## Chapter 1918 - Announcement of Results

Once political qualification was established, the writing and argumentation were examined. There were some commendable points—the analysis and arguments were quite novel. It was difficult for ordinary old literati to possess such insight. This was clearly the work of someone with at least some "Australian studies" cultivation. Such a person was inherently "actively seeking progress" and should receive some favorable scoring.

As for the weaknesses, they were merely limitations in the writing itself, including some typos and grammatical errors, but the logic flowed smoothly and even someone with a lower cultural level could understand it. Therefore, there was no need to be too particular about prose and wording.

Zhang Yunmi finally delivered a stern criticism to the naturalized citizen cadres, telling them that one could not judge things based on personal likes and dislikes. The more one faced such situations, the more one needed to maintain impartiality. At the same time, she also told the defected old literati cadres that everyone was now an Australian official and should work together in sincere unity. The Senate supported "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend,"  but personal attacks were not acceptable. As for the "four ways to write 'chicken'"—she didn't know them either! Thus, with both sides receiving equal reprimand, the matter was put to rest.

Liu Xiang and the others also attached great importance to this first civil service examination. Although it should be considered a "local civil service examination," given that the Senate would soon relocate its capital to Guangzhou, a considerable number of these civil servants would likely be promoted to central ministries. Therefore, during selection, the "reliability" factor in political terms still had to be the primary consideration.

However, upon reviewing the personal information of these applicants, the reliability concern turned out to be nothing to worry about. Of the 1,899 people who came to take the examination, only 27 held the former Ming *xiucai* degree—just slightly over 1 percent of the total examinees. There was not a single *juren* or *jinshi* among them.

Originally, before the recruitment began, there had been a heated debate in the Lingao Senate about whether Ming dynasty *juren* and *jinshi* could participate in the civil service examination. Many people, from the perspective of "purifying the ranks," expressed that such people absolutely must not be allowed to "infiltrate the revolutionary ranks."

"Infiltrate the revolutionary ranks" indeed! Liu Xiang thought to himself—these people were actively trying to distance themselves from us!

Still, this distancing was for the better. Though there were no "juren" or "jinshi" defecting to the cropped-hairs, eliminating the sensational publicity effect that the propaganda department would surely be disappointed about, it also spared the Senate endless arguments and disputes.

Looking at the registration data, those taking the civil service examination were mainly "tongsheng" from community schools and private academies, as well as small traders, shop assistants, and craftsmen who had studied for a few years and were now engaged in various trades. Overall, they were basically from the urban citizen class, with some rural households from nearby areas. Very few came from destitute backgrounds; most belonged to the urban middle and lower classes—which confirmed the saying that studying requires capital.

Although they all had some education, considering that the vast majority of candidates had no foundation in "Australian studies"—even though the aptitude test questions were not particularly "modern"—for many scholars who had spent their lives buried in classics and eight-legged essays, the questions still seemed like incomprehensible texts. Liu Xiang estimated that those who got questions right were probably just guessing.

To select talent as effectively as possible, the grading process did not simply mark right or wrong and assign scores, but also categorized and screened each paper. Candidates who scored high on mathematics and logic questions were singled out—even if their scores in other sections were lower, it didn't matter. For many candidates, their aptitude test score essentially determined whether they would proceed to the interview or even be admitted. Of course, if a candidate's essay was too poor, it basically meant that such examinees were unlikely to enter administrative management positions.

Yuan Shuzhi did not know his examination fate, but his current mood was rather calm—he was already a man past fifty, his days numbered. If he didn't pass, he would just become an accountant at the teahouse and live out his days in peace.

The Australian New Calendar year-end was approaching. Yuan Shuzhi was busy helping with the accounts while Zeng Juan went out collecting debts daily. On this day—the end of the year—the accounts had already been balanced. Yuan Shuzhi had eaten breakfast with little to do, so he sat in the accounts room and picked up *Dream of the Red Chamber* to read.

Suddenly he noticed a commotion in the street. Many students were hurrying toward the Tribute Courtyard.

"Quickly, quickly, go! The Elders are about to post the results!"

At this outcry, the crowd erupted. Examinees' faces flushed red with either anticipation or anxiety. Many people in the teahouse who had been washing up or having breakfast could not wait to finish eating—they rose impatiently to join the stream of people rushing outside.

Suddenly Zeng Juan burst in breathlessly. He drained the teacup on Yuan Shuzhi's table in one gulp, caught his breath, then announced loudly: "Old... Old... Yuan! The results are posted!!!" Hearing the words "results are posted," Yuan Shuzhi jumped to his feet. "Young Master Zeng, is it true?! Don't tease me!"

"Of course it's true! Today is December 30th! I had just stepped out when I heard people saying the Australian Song examination results were posted, so I immediately ran back to tell you. Let's go look together—I can't bear the suspense alone!"

"Good! Good! Good! I shall go with Young Master Zeng!"

Yuan Shuzhi and Zeng Juan immediately left and headed toward the Tribute Courtyard. Dashi Street, where the Tribute Courtyard was located, was already in an uproar. The area in front of the posting location was surrounded so densely by crowds that it was impenetrable. Not only candidates and their families came, but many idle spectators had also gathered. Everyone wanted to see what kind of "Australian spectacle" this first Australian examination result announcement would be! There were also quite a few parents with daughters of marriageable age, positioned at the entrance and ready to pounce, watching for any "newly minted Australian jinshi" of suitable appearance and talent to snatch up as sons-in-law.

The posting location was on the wall screen outside the Tribute Courtyard—the same place where examination results had been posted in the past. To symbolize breaking with the old and ushering in the new, Liu Xiang had specially ordered a colorful canopy to be erected overnight. Though the time had not yet arrived, the area in front of the colorful canopy was already packed with student candidates, each jostling for a good position. Having arrived late, Zeng Juan and company could only remain at the outer edge.

Fortunately, the list had not yet been posted. Some students pressed their palms together, murmuring something—on closer listening, it seemed to be prayers to gods and buddhas for blessings.

*Creak—*

The courtyard gates opened punctually at the *si* hour. Four people in Australian "cadre uniforms" emerged from within. Two held wide sheets of white paper, while the other two carried a ladder and a bucket of paste and brush respectively. Those waiting outside couldn't help but feel secretly disappointed—the Australian ceremony was far too simple! Never mind cannons and drums, at least there should be some sort of formal ritual. Just four minor clerks coming out to paste things on the wall?

Even so, everyone immediately parted to make way. The four cadres approached the wall, set up the ladder, and pasted up the notice.

A roster of black characters on white paper slowly unfurled—black text on white background. This format was unprecedented. Though the provincial examination announcements were not as elaborate as the metropolitan examinations, at least they used red paper. Who ever heard of just slapping up a sheet of white paper? Was this the legacy of the Great Song? Though puzzled, the candidates didn't care. Fame, fortune, and profit moved hearts—even if it were white paper with red text, the examinees wouldn't mind.

The moment the cadres stepped back, the crowd surged toward the roster with a great whoosh.

Only then did everyone see that this roster differed from the Ming dynasty's format. Each entry was preceded by an examination number in those curly Arabic numerals, followed by the candidate's name, the position applied for, and their ranking within that position. Knowledgeable spectators explained that this was the list of those who passed the written examination. There would still be an interview ahead—like passing the metropolitan examination but still needing to go through the palace examination.

Soon the crowd was in an uproar. Cries of great joy and great sorrow rose one after another. Some shouted ecstatically: "I passed, I passed!" grabbing the shoulders of whoever stood nearby—familiar or not—and shaking them violently. Others burst into tears crying: "No, this can't be true!" and similar phrases, wailing to the heavens, tears staining their clothes...

Yuan Shuzhi was too old to push through the young men, so he could only ask Zeng Juan to squeeze in alone. After Zeng Juan pushed into the crowd, he still couldn't get past the outer ring. He stood on tiptoe, craning his neck, searching meticulously for his own name and examination number. He had only gotten halfway through the roster when he spotted Yuan Shuzhi's name. He immediately shouted:

"Old Yuan... you're on it..."

But he saw the roster read: Sanitation Bureau Administrative Position: Yuan Shuzhi, Aptitude Test 41, Essay 60, ranked first for this position in the written examination.

Before he could report the scores, Zeng Juan was shoved aside. Being short, he was nearly suffocated by the jostling. Struggling to speak, Yuan Shuzhi outside grew even more anxious, shouting: "Young Zeng! Tell me! Did I pass or not?!"

Zeng Juan summoned all his strength, his voice coming from deep in his throat: "Dammit! Old Yuan, you passed! Aptitude 41, Essay 60! First place for the Sanitation Bureau position!"

*BOOM!* Everyone who heard "first place" exploded! How capable must this person be! First place for the Sanitation Bureau position! That virtually guaranteed selection! Some low-scoring passers felt relieved they weren't competing for the same position as this ancestor. Others who had failed clenched their fists, determined to seek out this expert for guidance before attempting again next year!

"I passed! I passed! I passed! Everyone look, number 1269—that's me!" Yuan Shuzhi clapped his hands and laughed toward the sky.

His face flushed with excitement, as though he had returned to eighteen years old. The furrows on his face, bunched together from laughter, seemed filled with renewed vitality. Heedless of the surrounding crowds, he began loudly reciting:

*A dragon stranded on the beach is mocked by shrimp;*
*A tiger fallen from the highlands is bullied by dogs.*
*The tiger lies deep in the mountains, listening to wind howling;*
*The dragon rests in shallow waters, waiting for the tide.*
*Where the ocean ends, the sky becomes the shore;*
*Atop the highest peak, I am the summit.*
*Like the sun rising in the east can rise again,*
*The great roc spreads its wings and resents the low sky.*
*Who hasn't had days as a tiger fallen on the plains?*
*Wait until I rise again from the mountains!*
...

Yuan Shuzhi babbled these half-poem, half-song phrases incoherently, looking as though the world's wind and clouds emanated from him, his brows brimming with joy. Zeng Juan meanwhile had no leisure to listen to his recitations. He searched the list from top to bottom, then from bottom to top, but still couldn't find his own examination number or name. He couldn't help growing anxious—afraid he had misread from too far away. Disregarding everything else, he burrowed deeper into the crowd, making it all the way to the base of the notice and starting his search again from the top.
