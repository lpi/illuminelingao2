# Chapter 1806: Propaganda Work

Liu Xiang remained calm on the surface, took the document and started flipping through it, but his silence already indicated his displeasure. In the past, the ruled area was small, and the county office had no administrative funds. Whatever happened came directly from the center, and the specific executing ministries brought personnel and materials to the local area to work directly. The county office deployed local administrative power to cooperate, just like during the typhoon disaster; the propaganda and recruitment work were all done by teams directly from Lingao, and Liu Xiang only had the police and other local administrative forces "watch the venue" for them to maintain order. But now Guangzhou Prefecture was such a big stall. Lingao gave Guangzhou a lot of autonomy, and the direct control of various ministries and commissions over their agencies deployed in Guangzhou dropped linearly. At the same time, these agencies in Guangzhou were almost all run by naturalized citizens, so the Guangzhou Municipal Government had a great say in these "vertical line departments" (Tiao-tiao).

The Propaganda Section of the City Government was theoretically subordinate to the Culture and Propaganda system, but Liu Xiang felt that the recent propaganda direction of "Yangcheng Express" completely failed to grasp the governance thinking of the Guangzhou Municipal Government. Therefore, he did not approve any of the follow-up plans. At the same time, in order to prevent this "vertical line department" from acting on its own, Liu Xiang specially instructed the various related departments regarding the manpower and materials needed for propaganda: no resources were to be given without Liu Xiang's approval.

After flipping through another new version of the propaganda plan, Liu Xiang finally understood why someone wanted to get rid of Ding Ding.

"He did a good job in news distribution in the Propaganda Department." This evaluation was the most euphemistic one Liu Xiang could think of.

Pulling the bell pull, Liu Xiang ordered the orderly who ran over to serve tea to all three of them. Sipping the tea, Liu Xiang read the key chapters of the document again and organized his thoughts on talking to Ding Ding.

Leaving aside Ding Ding's work ability, the deeper issue was probably the provincial-ministerial contradiction—or what might be called the "line vs. block" contradiction. Of course, this was not a problem for Liu Xiang. As long as the subordinates were naturalized cadres, Liu Xiang could use his status as a Senator to force them to do things according to his mind. But this inevitably set a precedent for cross-boundary command for later comers, which was something strictly to be avoided.

"Old Ding!" Liu Xiang opened his mouth with a somewhat heavy tone. He took another sip of tea and nestled into the sofa in a very relaxed, non-aggressive posture to continue talking to Ding Ding.

"I am an absolute layman regarding propaganda theory and whatnot; I don't understand it." Just as he finished a sentence, Ding Ding seemed about to interrupt, so Liu Xiang hurriedly pressed his hand in the air, stopping Ding Ding from speaking.

"But from the perspective of administrative work, I feel that this propaganda plan is not appropriate." Liu Xiang slightly observed Ding Ding's expression, and sure enough, it was a look of "laymen shouldn't interrupt" and "just sign it."

"Look, let's not talk about anything else, let's talk about this prostitute liberation work that must be launched immediately." Liu Xiang turned to a paragraph in the middle and pointed it out to Ding Ding. "Let me ask first, who do you think benefits the most from us doing this liberation work?"

"Who else could it be? Isn't it just this bunch of..." Ding Ding almost blurted out "whores," but caught a glimpse of Zhang Yunmi's back from the corner of his eye and instantly changed his words, "lost women!"

"In the short term, it is indeed this group of people. They will receive professional medical assistance, as well as our legal aid to help them break free from unreasonable indenture contracts. They can leave the trade, and even those willing to continue in this... 'customs industry' can get the remuneration they deserve. from this aspect, mobilising such a large administrative force to carry out this movement is directly rescuing them. It is not an exaggeration to say we are their 'benefactors'." Liu Xiang could only follow Ding Ding's meaning first.

"In the long run..." Liu Xiang skipped that 'but' directly. "In the long run, by using these lost women as an entry point, we extend the tentacles of the public security, procuratorate, and court deep into the interest chain of the gray industry, allowing us to monitor local black and evil forces more accurately. This is number one; these rescued lost women will be uniformly trained in industrial skills and finally master a skill to participate in social production. We get a batch of young labor force. This is number two; as for number three, our gender ratio is so unbalanced now. Whether these people are arranged for employment in Guangzhou or Hainan, or scattered for resettlement, in the end, it solves the lifelong major events of hundreds of able-bodied men. The contribution to our social stability is incalculable."

The more Ding Ding listened, the more impatient he became: "These principles are all correct, but what does this have to do with the propaganda plan!"

"That's the problem! According to the calculation just now, our government seems to have spent a lot of effort and suffered a big loss, ending up saving many lost women, but in the end, the one who benefits the most is actually our government! So shouldn't the propaganda be more balanced? Don't always start from the benefactor mentality of 'these... lost women took huge advantage,' but explore and explain the starting point and significance of this action more?" Liu Xiang also almost used the word "whores."

Ding Ding realized what Liu Xiang was trying to say at this point. This plan was brought out after Ding Ding participated in it, so he naturally knew what the general propaganda tone inside was. "The Senate loves the people like children," "The Senate has great grace for the world," "The Senate is just good, just good," "The evil hostile forces/old society are just bad, just bad." Generally speaking, it was this kind of tone—or rather, the propaganda department had basically been using this tone all along.

"Look, for us in administration, treating the head when the head aches and the foot when the foot hurts is the lowest level. My level is slightly better; I look for the root of the problem. Like when I was in Qiongshan dealing with the problem of stealing telegraph wires. Besides intensifying the crackdown, we had to cut off the root. Since all the people in the county who knew how to forge iron were packaged and sent to Lingao for training as workers, those who stole telegraph wires couldn't transform the stuff into daily iron tools, so stealing became meaningless. Statistically speaking, the number of telegraph wire thefts dropped linearly after this measure was implemented." Liu Xiang wanted to give an example but accidentally started bragging about himself again. Catching a glimpse of Ding Ding's mocking expression, Liu Xiang knew he had slipped up again.

Since Xun Suji's notes on going to the countryside were published internally, Liu Xiang had been very careful not to brag about his "political achievements" in Qiongshan, but slipping up momentarily was unavoidable.

"Of course, the most important thing was that cheap iron tools from Lingao Iron and Steel Company paved over like a tide, making those traditional blacksmiths lose the meaning of existence. This fundamentally solved the problem. Those who stole for a living and for labor were solved. The remaining ones who still stole were purely because they were born cheap. Catch one of these people and send one to dig sand." Liu Xiang speeded up to finish the story. He couldn't help it; he had obsessive-compulsive disorder.

"I think propaganda is the same. Find the root of the problem accurately. Whether the Senate is good or not doesn't rely on propaganda blowing. I have to say, the current situation in Lingao was really created by us 500 people eating, living, and working together with the people, leading the people hoe by hoe. Although in terms of original intention, we were forced to work because if we didn't do this, no one in this world could do the work we wanted to do. And if we really want to pick words, 'eating together' definitely didn't meet the standard, but we did participate in labor and led the common people to work more efficiently..." Seeing Ding Ding revealing a "don't you dare engage in political propaganda in front of me" expression, Liu Xiang decided to get straight to the point.

"So I think our propaganda work should publicize more on why we do this, and explain the reasoning clearly to the common people. Whether it's reasoning or intimidation—saying foreigners have strange venereal diseases and if we don't cut off the transmission path from this side, it will eventually lead to broken families and deaths or whatever—it's all fine. As long as the propaganda department is willing to reason, the common people will listen, whether they believe it or not. With a face like 'look how many benefits I gave, hurry up and kowtow in gratitude' like now, I think the propaganda effect will definitely not be very good. Don't end up with the common people saying, 'After the Senators conquered Guangzhou, they hurriedly bestowed favors on the whores,' that would be a hell of a ghost." At this point in the context, the use of "whores" came out so naturally that Liu Xiang didn't even notice it himself. Zhang Yunmi heard it, but she had her back to the two uncles, staring wide-eyed and pursing her lips to hold back her laughter, but her trembling shoulders had already exposed her.

Ding Ding didn't laugh. Liu Xiang's last few sentences made him figure out some things, and he was contemplating now.

"Comrade Ding Ding seems... salvageable after all." Liu Xiang looked at the contemplative Ding Ding and sighed with emotion in his heart.

"Dong dong dong," a knock on the door sounded. "Report! Mayor Liu, a document has arrived." A familiar female voice sounded outside the door—Lu Cheng.

Lu Cheng's title was "Director of the Guangzhou Women's Federation." She was not a cadre selected by Liu Xiang from Qiongshan County: when Liu Xiang was asked to select cadres from Qiongshan County, he deliberately didn't pick Lu Cheng—firstly, Lu Cheng belonged to a secret department, and transfer was actually not suitable through his route; secondly, Lu Cheng indeed hindered Liu Xiang from "collecting people." But unexpectedly, Lu Cheng was still parachuted directly into Guangzhou from the Cadre Department. It was unknown whether it was through the Political Security line or the Women's Federation line. But seeing that she was no longer the "County Women's Federation Deputy Director" but directly became the leader, and looking at her resume, she had received training from Du Wen in Manyao, she should have come through the Women's Federation line—however, no matter what line she came through, it was certain that she was a "hidden cadre" planted by the Political Security Bureau. This identity was known only to Mu Min and Liu Xiang, even among the Senators.

Since she was the person in charge of the so-called "Women's Federation," the main person in charge of the recent movement to liberate lost women would be Lu Cheng. Since she was a training object looked upon differently by the Cadre Department, Liu Xiang wanted to see if she could show such ability.
