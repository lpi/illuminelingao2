# Chapter 1785 - The Investigation

Li Ziyu didn't know if Old Gao's "hit the jackpot" was sincere congratulations or mockery, so he kept his mouth shut. Zhao Gui, on the other hand, chuckled foolishly a few times.

Since it was confirmed there had indeed been a corpse, naturally they had to determine if this was the crime scene. Both Gao Chongjiu and Li Zhenguo believed it was not. Their reasoning came from the bloodstains. Li Zhenguo determined this from the area and depth of blood penetration. Chief Mu had said: the human neck has arteries and veins; once decapitated, there is massive blood loss. The blood penetrating the soil couldn't be this little. Gao Chongjiu, having seen many beheaded criminals on the execution ground over the years, reasoned: the head is the chief of the "Six Yangs," full of blood and *qi*; chopping it off causes an instant spray. But there were no spray traces on the surrounding walls or ground.

The deceased was beheaded elsewhere and then moved here. The question was, why go to such trouble to move it here?

Gao Chongjiu thought this wasn't hard to explain. Because the end of Scissors Lane East Branch Alley 7 was a river channel. Dumping a corpse into the river was an easy and simple way to dispose of it. Even if the corpse floated up a few days later, who knew where it would have drifted? Even if the police wanted to find the incident location, it would be like finding a needle in a haystack. Moreover, most urban river channels connected to the Six Pulse Map (sewage system); if it drifted into a hidden drain and rotted there, truly even gods wouldn't know.

Smoothing out the logic, the matter was very simple: the murderer, hiding nearby after seeing Li Ziyu and the others turn back, quickly returned to the scene, moved the corpse to the river pier at the end of the alley, and dumped it directly into the river channel.

So when Li Ziyu and the watchman returned, the corpse had vanished. It must still be in the river now.

"Not only is the corpse still in the river, but the corpse-dumping murderer is also still on this street," Li Zhenguo said with a touch of regret. "Pity we don't have dogs here!"

He had heard Wu Xiang and other naturalized police from Lingao say that Australian police stations had dogs that could identify people by scent, specifically used to catch criminals. Just bring the dog to the scene to sniff, and it could track down the fugitive. Very magical.

But such dogs were not allocated to the police station—the Australians had brought many dogs of various kinds never seen before to Guangzhou, but they mostly accompanied public order patrol teams in alleys and surrounding villages, baring teeth and growling. Li Zhenguo had only heard there would be a "Police Dog Team," but even Mu Min didn't know when.

Although they lacked the legendary Australian police dogs, they still had the street gate.

Because Scissors Lane was nearly five *li* long, to facilitate management via gates, the government had historically divided it into South Scissors Lane, Middle Scissors Lane, and North Scissors Lane, separated by two major east-west roads. Each section had north and south street gates, with "watchmen" responsible for opening and closing them.

The crime scene was near the southern end of South Scissors Lane. Just now, when Gao Chongjiu arrived, he had kept a thought in mind and told the watchman not to open the street gate—normally it would open at first light. Now, the entire South Scissors Lane remained sealed; outsiders couldn't enter, and those inside couldn't leave. Unless this corpse-dumping murderer was a cat burglar who could fly over eaves and walk on walls, he must still be in some corner of this street. And the murder scene must also be somewhere on this street.

Gao Chongjiu's certainty had its logic. The street gate system was actually a revival of the old "Li-Fang" (ward) system. Since the city was no longer a perfect grid, the street gate system was adopted. After gates closed at night, except for doctors and midwives, commoners couldn't pass. Even powerful big households wouldn't casually ask for the gates to be opened at night without reason.

Although this was somewhat inconvenient for citizens, it was indeed very useful for public order. Except for high-flying thieves, ordinary petty thieves found it hard to operate at night. When Gao Chongjiu worked in the yamen, whenever he encountered a major case demanded to be solved strictly by superiors, as long as the chief of the Fast Band roughly knew which street the criminal was on, he would have the street gates closed. Then runners led by the *baojia* head would search house by house. Unless the intelligence was wrong, capturing the criminal was practically guaranteed.

This method never failed, though it disturbed the people greatly. But for runners, it was a good chance to make a fortune: whether going door-to-door questioning or searching, shops and households had to cough up money for "respect." If anyone lacked foresight, turning their home and shop upside down and stealing things was light punishment; labeling them with "colluding with thieves" suspicion and dragging them to the cell for a few days of "hospitality" was not something a few hundred copper cash could solve.

Li Zhenguo knew this method too. In fairness, this was currently the simplest and fastest way. Finding the criminal naturally meant finding the corpse. He agreed immediately. The two immediately returned to the police station and spoke to the chief: the chief sent men to seal all street gates connecting South Scissors Lane to other places, preventing anyone from sneaking over, and simultaneously summoned the *baojia* heads and team leaders of this precinct to the station for a meeting to check for recent suspicious persons.

As for Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui, since they were patrolmen of this precinct, they had to help too. The chief originally wanted to send them to guard the street gates, but Li Zhenguo said they were the first discoverers and should stay at the station to be questioned immediately if anything came to mind. At the same time, someone was sent to the Municipal Bureau to request corpse-handlers (Wu-gong) to fish for the corpse in the river channel.

The station's duty police fanned out. It was just breaking dawn; households hadn't gone out yet. With one call from the station, except for one bedridden with illness, the *baojia* heads of South Scissors Lane arrived in no time.

Li Zhenguo first asked if there were any suspicious outsiders locally in the past few days, or any suspicious events.

According to the new household registration system, any outsider staying in a precinct residence or shop for more than twenty-four hours had to report for a temporary residence permit at the police station. This wasn't a modern invention; Wang Shouren had similar regulations when he implemented the Baojia system, but the registration system back then wasn't clearly institutionalized, and efficiency depended on whether bureaucrats and Baojia heads were diligent.

The household registration system the Senatorial Council implemented in Guangzhou was naturally much more effective than the simple Baojia system. The Baojia heads had a dedicated "official" over them—the Household Registration Police. Naturally, efficiency improved significantly. Especially since current household registration police in each station were naturalized cadres sent from Lingao, who had their own methods, the system was established quickly.

But the Baojia heads couldn't say anything specific. Everyone expressed there were no suspicious characters recently. New arrivals in the city were few lately: due to the Senatorial Council army's Northern Expedition, ordinary people didn't travel if they could help it—traveling long distances during troop movements was risky. So only a dozen outsiders had reported temporary residence in the last three days. Gao Chongjiu knew that generally, those serving as Baojia heads on the street weren't ordinary commoners; at the very least they had seen some world, were articulate, and could manage all sides. Their judgment of people was "sharper" than average. If they said there were no suspicious characters, then naturally there weren't. This disappointed Gao Chongjiu slightly.

As for suspicious events, the Baojia heads racked their brains and mentioned a few, but most were trivial matters. At least superficially, none seemed connected to a murder case.

Li Zhenguo said since there were no usable leads, he would ask the Baojia heads to lead the way and canvas house to house with the station police.

Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui naturally had to tag along.

Just as they began house-to-house questioning, two corpse-handlers arrived rowing a small boat. They were specifically responsible for salvaging corpses in the city's river channels. Corpse-handlers had low status and no salary, relying entirely on rewards from the deceased's family and the government. The water was bone-chilling in winter and stank to high heaven in summer; except for beggars, no one was willing to do this work.

Two burly men rowing a small boat: one stayed at the bow calling gently, one sat at the stern lowering a string of giant rolling hooks tied with coarse hemp rope to the river bottom. They searched back and forth, section by section, in the fifty meters upstream and downstream of the river pier.

The river channels hadn't been dredged for years, and there was much debris and trash underwater. Searching section by section like this, the rolling hooks snagged many heavy objects, but pulling them up revealed only various kinds of garbage. The two fished in the channel for half a day, catching nothing, let alone a headless corpse.

News reached the two detectives questioning residents. Now Gao Chongjiu and Li Zhenguo couldn't sit still. No corpse meant their previous deduction couldn't stand. Besides instructing the corpse-handlers to expand the search range, Gao Chongjiu and Li Zhenguo decided to split up. Gao Chongjiu would continue questioning residents, while Li Zhenguo would return to the scene to see if he could find more clues.

Since they were returning to the scene for inspection, Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui naturally had to accompany them again. Li Zhenguo returned to the scene, which had been cordoned off by police. Although there was nothing there, news of a murder on the street had spread. Street gates on both sides were tightly closed, and team leaders busily knocking on doors to question people proved the rumors weren't false. So as soon as Li Zhenguo returned, many idle onlookers gathered nearby.

Li Zhenguo first went to West Branch Alley 11. This alley was quite long; one could walk along it to another north-south street. The street gate here was also locked. Clearly, after dark, the criminal could neither enter nor leave from here. Either he just hid in the alley when dumping the corpse, or the crime scene was right here!

Li Zhenguo tried hard to recall what he had seen and learned while on missions with Wu Xiang. Obviously, a corpse is very heavy. A person carrying one couldn't walk a long way. Therefore, the crime scene wouldn't be very far from the dump site.
