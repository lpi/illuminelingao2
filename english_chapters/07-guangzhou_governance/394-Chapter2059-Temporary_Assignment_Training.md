# Chapter 2059 - Temporary Assignment Training

"Treasury Manager—that's a very lucrative position. Mines fall under his jurisdiction, don't they?"

"Yes." Wang Qiyi took a sip of water and continued. "The Liang family's assets there are probably substantial. Starting from there lets us strike at the root. We have another favorable condition: Foshan will soon become the Executive Committee's 'governance model district.' The entire Executive Committee will be watching—coordinating with local forces will be much easier for us."

"Governance model? They're not even assigning an Elder as county chief—how can they grasp the spirit?" Zhang Xiaoqi asked curiously.

"Ah, you don't know about this." Ai Zhixin said. "You weren't at the regional meeting when they communicated the documents last time. The notice said Young Elders sixteen and older will soon be assigned for temporary training positions—and the location is Foshan."

"I see! What a luxury lineup!" Zhang Xiaoqi exclaimed in surprise.

"That's right, ultra-luxury lineup. We're cultivating the third echelon now."

"Sending a group of children down to the grassroots for temporary positions—isn't that a bit reckless? This isn't Speaker Qian's idea, is it?" Zhang Xiaoqi wasn't very approving.

"His opinion is definitely part of it. But everyone has this thought, I suppose." Ai Zhixin said. "By the way, Director Zhang, Director Wang—your daughter is also going to Foshan for temporary assignment. The notice should arrive soon."

Zhang Xiaoqi murmured, "Is this really appropriate? It feels strange to me."

"What's inappropriate about it?" Wang Qiyi looked quite pleased. "Muqing isn't young anymore. It's time for practical training—to prepare her for being an heir!"

"I don't think there's anything inappropriate either. How old was Little Zhang when she came to Guangzhou? Only about eighteen. She's the principal of the Guangzhou Cadre Academy now, and isn't she doing well?"

Zhang Xiaoqi worried, "She's still young—and she's a girl. I'm not comfortable with her being sent to a pacified zone..." As she spoke, she rose to get the telegram book.

"Hey, hey, what are you doing?" Wang Qiyi stopped his wife.

"Going to telegram the General Office to say I disagree with Xiaoqing going to Foshan for temporary assignment—if she must do temporary training, it should be in Guangzhou."

"Everyone else is going, but she alone doesn't go—isn't that inappropriate..."

"I don't care. Xiaoqing absolutely cannot go to Foshan for temporary assignment!"

Wang Qiyi hastily tried to persuade her, arguing that "this is the Executive Committee's unified arrangement; being too special wouldn't be appropriate." But Zhang Xiaoqi's attitude was firm—no discussion: temporary assignment was fine, but it had to be in Guangzhou.

"If Director Zhang really insists, why not have her assigned to our Tax Bureau?" Ai Zhixin suggested. "She'd have the temporary assignment credentials. And Tax Bureau work is demanding—we're handling a major case. Let Xiaoqing participate nominally."

Wang Qiyi glared at Ai Zhixin, silently cursing: why are you muddying the waters? Getting assigned to the Tax Bureau would do Wang Muqing's future development absolutely no good.

However, the suggestion obviously touched Zhang Xiaoqi's heart. She said somewhat hesitantly, "The Tax Bureau is a department where we hold leadership positions. Wouldn't that be inappropriate?"

"Don't avoid recommending the worthy just because they're related!" Ai Zhixin said. "Speaker Qian's daughter became the first secretary of the Yuan Youth League, and he didn't say it was inappropriate. He even actively participates in Yuan Youth League activities to support his daughter. Besides, Elder seats are hereditary anyway. No matter where they're assigned, it's all training for future leadership positions. What's there to be concerned about?"

This left Wang Qiyi speechless. Indeed, he wasn't just some "civil servant" working for the government—he *was* the government. From this perspective, Ai Zhixin was absolutely right.

Now Ai Zhixin was really getting going. "Besides, Director Zhang, you're the backbone of our bureau. If your daughter goes off to Foshan, you'll definitely be worried sick and unable to work properly. That would probably significantly impact our Tax Bureau's work..."

Seeing his wife about to be talked over by Ai Zhixin, Wang Qiyi quickly interjected: "I think we need to respect our daughter's opinion on this! Sister Zhang, hasn't that always been your educational philosophy? Let children decide what they can decide for themselves—parents shouldn't interfere or arrange too much."

This counter-attacked Zhang Xiaoqi from the flank. Seeing his wife considering this, Wang Qiyi deployed the delay tactic: "This temporary assignment won't start immediately. Let's go home and discuss it properly, also get Xiaoqing's own opinion. How about that?"

After he put it this way, Zhang Xiaoqi also felt that insisting on telegraphing immediately was a bit rash, so she shelved the matter, planning to "think it over carefully" at home. Wang Qiyi silently exclaimed "close call!" He'd managed to delay this crisis for now. As for how to convince his wife afterward—well, Director Wang had naturally cultivated that skill to perfection. Even if he wasn't 100% confident, he was at least 70-80% there.

"If they're all Young Elders on temporary assignment, someone must be in overall charge, right?" Zhang Xiaoqi continued asking.

"Naturally. According to the document I saw, first there's Ye Mengyan accompanying them throughout. You know Little Ye—though he's our generation, his actual age is only a few years older than the children." Wang Qiyi said. "And he's from a military background. Having him lead the group will definitely ensure the children's safety. For the administrative side, someone else is at the helm."

"Who?"

"Jiang Yuanzhi. He's now the Administrative Commissioner for the Guangzhou region, leading a team of about twenty people. Specifically responsible for inspecting the various prefectures and counties in the Guangzhou region that don't have Elder county chiefs assigned." Wang Qiyi explained.

"Jiang Yuanzhi—he used to teach at Fangcaodi's Vocational Education Department, and even taught financial accounting and abacus to our Tax training class..." Zhang Xiaoqi had been colleagues with Jiang Yuanzhi and clearly knew him better.

"Abacus? He can use an abacus?" Ai Zhixin was somewhat surprised.

"Of course. He even won abacus awards as a child. Otherwise why would I have asked him to teach?"

"No wonder he's thin as an abacus rod. Since you know him, that makes things easier. We're going to Foshan to handle the case right when the Young Elders are coming for temporary assignment. We can let them get somewhat involved—that way the pressure will be greater. Mm, we can take bigger policy steps..."

Wang Qiyi immediately understood this was preparation to use the Young Elders as a shield—with Young Elders on temporary assignment, the Executive Committee's tolerance for errors would naturally be much higher.

"Let's try to follow policy guidelines on that."

"Director Zhang, at that time we'll have to trouble you two."

Hearing Ai Zhixin say this, Zhang Xiaoqi also responded politely: "Ha, no problem. Who told you to put him in the team leader position..."

"Director Zhang, you're being modest. I think no one is more suited to be team leader than Director Wang. I agree with everything you've said! We'll start from Foshan. First thing tomorrow morning, I'll contact Jiang Yuanzhi."

"Oh, give me a break..." Wang Qiyi wore an expression of "don't think I don't know what you're thinking." "No one more suited than me, you say. There are only three people in this room..."

"Hahaha..."

With work matters settled, the three of them naturally relaxed somewhat. Ai Zhixin habitually began teasing the Wang couple. "How's that 'breeding program' you two set up working out?"

"Breeding program" was Ai Zhixin's joking name for the Tax Bureau's recent after-work training. The proposal came from Wang Qiyi and Zhang Xiaoqi. The reasoning was that many single naturalized cadres who'd graduated from Fangcaodi were now around twenty years old—in Ming terms, whether male or female, thoroughly late to marry. Young people without ties had unsettled minds, and there was Han Yue's precedent as a warning.

Du Yibin and Wang Jun's group wedding idea had given them a thought—since the Executive Committee could "arrange marriages," it could also promote "free romance" by giving young men and women more opportunities for contact.

So Wang Qiyi had recently not only reduced after-work training frequency to give them time to stroll the streets, but also only lectured until the mid-session break. After that, those with families could go home while single cadres continued self-study. Wang Qiyi didn't stay in the classroom watching them either—he'd just close the door and let them do as they pleased. At first, the young people were all tense, sitting properly and reading. Later, discovering that Director Wang never came back and it was always the class monitor who announced dismissal and locked up, they gradually grew bolder—chatting, joking, changing seats. The classroom became quite lively.

After more than a month, by Ai Zhixin and Wang Qiyi's observation, at least three couples had formed within the Tax Bureau. Whether they'd actually marry was another matter, but at least it was a good start. At one meal, Ai Zhixin boasted to other Elders at the table. Given the male-female ratio among naturalized cadres, this attracted quite a few people thinking about finding wives for their subordinates at the female-heavy Tax Bureau. So first Mu Min took the lead, then everyone urged Wang Qiyi to organize "training" for single naturalized cadres across the municipal government and Guangzhou-stationed units following the Tax Bureau model.

"You're the breeding station." Zhang Xiaoqi wasn't offended, sitting down next to Wang Qiyi with her cup. "Your husband here is a leader who truly cares about comrades..."

"Oh, get out of here..." Wang Qiyi's expression wasn't as good as his wife's. "I'm in such trouble now—do you know how many people there are? Over a hundred just in the initial batch. Liu Xiang is playing dumb over there, saying 'good, good, good' non-stop, talking about promoting the experience. What training? Just convert Zhang Yunmi's cadre school into a matchmaking corner."

"That's different. Yunmi is still a young unmarried woman..." Mentioning Zhang Yunmi made Ai Zhixin's eyelid twitch involuntarily.

"Leaving that aside, how is the rest different?"

"This—this is learning. Can we call what happens between classmates matchmaking?" Thinking of the Wang couple's situation, Ai Zhixin waved it off. "You don't understand... Just do it. If you feel the content isn't good enough, just ramble using that lecture outline Liu Xiang organized before. Grab a few conscripts from various departments."

"Too many people... I think we should do it in batches, no more than 40 people each time." Wang Qiyi indicated surrender.

"Whatever works. Anyway, I've never done anything like introducing people to potential partners. Hahaha, Old Wang, you two capable folks will just have to work harder."
