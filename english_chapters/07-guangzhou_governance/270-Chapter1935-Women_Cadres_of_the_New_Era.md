# Chapter 1935 - Women Cadres of the New Era

The first round of cadre selection by the Qiongya Detachment responsible for going north to take over political power originally did not include Zhu Qiujing's name—she belonged to purely technical cadres and wouldn't be needed immediately. However, the establishment of the Computing Center in Guangdong had been placed on the agenda.

However, with the continuous advancement of the South China Strategy, the plan to set up a new Data Center in Guangzhou had been explicitly put on the agenda. Although the personnel arrangement for Senators was not yet clear, in the list of naturalized cadres to be deployed, Zhu Qiujing's name ranked at the top due to her familiarity with the situation in Guangzhou, her excellent professional qualities, and sufficient management experience.

Since she was going to shoulder a burden, Xu Laowu didn't include her on the cadre promotion list—since she was about to be transferred and promoted externally, there was no need to occupy a position here now. So this promotion was all for technical cadres in "backend" departments. Especially a few apprentices following Feng Nuo to "repair computers."

Zhu Qiujing didn't have any objections to this; instead, Du Wen came to fight for justice. Two days ago, she specifically sent a memo with a stiff tone, reminding Xu Laowu that as a place with a dense concentration of female cadres and employees, the Data Center should treat women's work as an important core task, and in particular should strengthen the cultivation and appointment of women cadres. Although no names were directly mentioned, Senator Xu knew this was a protest against his delay in further promoting Zhu Qiujing.

Leaving that aside, the second half of the memo was a nagging reminder to Xu Laowu to "earnestly safeguard women's rights and interests and improve women's status." Xu Laowu personally held a supportive attitude towards this, but such clichés, mixed into official documents, made Xu Laowu cry out that he couldn't take it. After all, if she put it in an official document, he couldn't not read it—what if there was some official business?

For a long time, there had been controversy within the Senate regarding the status of women and women's policies in this timeline. Regarding the radical policy of implementing complete gender equality advocated by a group led by Queen Du and Ji Xin, many people had doubts. Some even proposed that advocating gender equality too early might not necessarily adapt to the current self-positioning and identification of women on the one hand, and on the other hand, it could easily trigger a backlash from various forces traditionally centered on male power, which would be detrimental to uniting and expanding the ruling base as much as possible. But on one hand, the influence of ideas from the old timeline still remained, and on the other hand, out of the more realistic need to liberate productive forces, release human resources, and expand consumption demand, most Senators still recognized that in the new society, the status of women must be improved. Regardless of how many explicit or implicit glass ceilings existed in reality, at least in terms of laws and norms, gender equality should be supported, and on this basis, strive for the understanding and support of a broader mass.

Just as a certain male Senator from the Social Work Department who assisted in drafting the "Instructions" said during the defense in the Senate: Gender equality is an important symbol distinguishing the new society, or in other words, modern society, from ancient, feudal societies. Moreover, experience from the old timeline clearly showed that the process of liberating women was also a process of liberating a considerable portion of productive forces. In quite a few social positions, women could work better and more stably than men. In addition, establishing the principle of gender equality definitely did not mean that factual inequality between men and women would disappear immediately. Even in the old timeline, in the Nordic high-welfare countries where so-called equality had somewhat entered the realm of obsession, those in control of power were actually mostly still men. What the Senate needed to do was push open this door, clarify its determination as a long-term national policy, and leave the rest for history to do itself.

It was against this general backdrop that, less than two years after the Second Plenary Session, the Senate successively passed multiple programmatic documents involving women's legal status, personal rights, social and economic rights, and the cultivation and appointment of female cadres. The most important among them were summarized by later generations as "Three Regulations and One Instruction," namely the "Regulations on Establishing the Legislative Principle of 'Gender Equality'," "Regulations on Guaranteeing Women's Rights to Schooling, Employment, and Promotion," "Regulations on Ensuring Women's Personal Safety and Inheritance Rights," and the aforementioned instruction on strengthening the cultivation of women cadres. This series of policies and regulations not only clarified the principle of gender equality at the legislative level but also proposed a series of specific measures in judicial and administrative practice and carried out corresponding organizational guarantees.

Many years later, when global historians with a conscience (not necessarily young ones) constantly unearthed many dark histories from the early days of the Senate: the Maid Revolution, slave trading and usage, the Ziming Building Entertainment Group, and the Action in Dengzhou, no one dared to deny the Empire's many pioneering contributions in promoting human rights and equality. Regardless of their attitude towards the Empire, historians had to admit: "Even with many shortcomings and limitations, what arrived globally simultaneously with the Empire's warships and bayonets were unprecedented 'rule of law, equality, and freedom.' Among them, gender equality was an absolute highlight. As the renowned future female scholar Beauvoir Du praised unreservedly: (In the field of gender equality) before the Senate, there was only eternal night. God said, 'Let the Senators come.' Thus, everything became bright."

Of course, the current Senator Xu didn't know any of this. For him, what needed to be considered at present was nothing more than how to select naturalized cadres. Anyway, they were basically all women here, and every time cadres were promoted, women were the majority, so there was no headache-inducing "sex ratio" problem. What's more, Queen Du had always been at odds with him, and since she didn't name names, let her say whatever she loved to say.

Taking the record book from Team Leader Zhu's hand and chatting briefly, Senator Xu conducted another patrol inside the building. After checking the original data materials constantly increasing on the rows of shelves on the ground floor, similar to a library in the old timeline, as well as the manual statistics hall where data was being synchronized to wall charts via ladders, Senator Xu confirmed that the current work progress was all normal. After leaving for less than an hour, he returned to his office, sat in front of the ThinkPAD laptop brought from the old timeline, and continued his exploration journey on the Senate BBS. This wasn't an outburst of Senator Xu's otaku attributes, but because in a series of threads discussed very heatedly on the internet recently, Senator Xu smelled the scent of some conspiracy, and even more unfortunately, he was actually named and involved.

Speaking of this, it had to do with Queen Du's positioning of Senator Xu—"a typical representative of the decadent and declining forces of the bourgeoisie in the Senate." Senator Xu graduated from a 985 university in the late 90s majoring in computational mathematics. Upon graduation, he caught the good times of the first internet bubble, successfully started a business with a few senior fellow students, cheated some venture capital, sold it to a listed company, and made a small fortune. Speaking of which, as a successful person who had a house and a car at a young age in the early 21st century, Senator Xu should have absolutely no motivation or determination to participate in the transmigration, nor did he fit the standard image of most transmigrators.

However, fate is such an elusive thing. Currently high-spirited Senator Xu first married his girlfriend from university. Although they didn't have children for a while, their life together over a few years was harmonious and happy. What followed was a typical plot of a third-rate TV drama. During business dealings, he met a stylish and beautiful female client. Senator Xu, who was half a "phoenix man," uncontrollably had something happen with her. But unfortunately, Senator Xu didn't have the skill to keep the colorful flags fluttering outside while the red flag at home didn't fall. His first wife resolutely divorced him and took away a lot of the family property. And the subsequent plot was also very cliché. Shortly after the mistress was upgraded to fiancée, Senator Xu discovered that he was never his future wife's only one; what attracted her was probably just his few coins.

Senator Xu, who had been dealt a blow to the head, wanted to turn back and eat the grass he had left behind, but suddenly sadly discovered that his first wife had already taken a step ahead: she had married a former high school classmate. This time, Senator Xu felt a bit like all hopes were dashed. For a while, he resorted to forums and playing games to amuse himself. It was precisely at this time that, by chance, he saw CEO Wen's recruitment post. If it were before, such a post would be nothing more than another form of MLM advertisement to Senator Xu. But in the eyes of a person who had just experienced a drastic change in life, if there was really a chance to change time and space to live, it might be quite interesting. Holding the mindset that it was at worst a trip to the seaside, Senator Xu boarded the plane heading south and finally got on the pirate ship of the Transmigration Company.

After surviving the chaotic days after D-Day and acting as basic labor, which helped Senator Xu reduce his waist size by three sizes, due to Senator Xu's work experience in information system design and management in the original timeline, coupled with his older age and more mature work style, Senator Xu was chosen by the Planning Agency to start setting up the Planning Agency Data Center, mainly for data statistics and management. It could be said that he built this institution and this team single-handedly, brick by brick. Although the work couldn't be called completely satisfactory, seeing his efforts bear fruit still gave him a considerable sense of satisfaction. With the completion and activation of the new Data Center building, work in all aspects showed even more flourishing momentum. As the promoter of all this, Senator Xu's days during this period could be counted as smooth sailing.

But just in these few days, a post posted by a Senator who had long opposed the Senate's ruling system suddenly appeared on the BBS, targeting the long-standing Senator share dividend system. The issue of Senators' shares was first clarified at the first Transmigrator Conference in the old timeline, the so-called "Training Ground Conference." Although later revised and detailed through two plenary sessions, with relatively clear methods for acquiring and calculating this one-fifth of the Senate, the initial shareholding ratio and amount did not change significantly. That is to say, the Senators' shareholding ratios were mainly calculated from the funds and materials they provided in the old timeline, and had little to do with their performance in the new timeline. The main attack point of this post was here, and unfortunately, Senator Xu was cited as an example and became a target.
