# Chapter 1785 - On Patrol

Li Ziyu strolled down the street, feeling a bit bored. A fine spring day, yet he couldn't call friends for an outing, nor lie high in his study for endless philosophical talk. Wandering the streets in stinking shoes—the job was tedious and trivial. Though his uncle had said: "Those who serve are not free; those who are free do not serve," Li Ziyu still found this kind of service hard to adapt to.

Service was bitter, and particularly bitter for the Australians—he had felt this deeply these past few days.

A so-called patrolman just wandered the streets all day. Fine in fair weather, but miserable in rain—the bureau issued a bamboo hat and a straw raincoat. Change into wooden-soled hemp sandals and hit the street just the same. In the past, let alone "Fast Band" runners, even coolies wouldn't stand by the bridge in such weather.

Li Ziyu recalled the days of "serving" the Ming. Even for military households in the Wei-Suo system, "drilling" was rare year-round; even mustering for roll-call happened only on paydays—and since pay was long overdue, roll-calls were rare. An officer like his uncle, apart from reporting to the yamen daily, mostly used the Wei-Suo soldiers to do private work for his family. "Proper service" days numbered a month a year at most. When the Australians attacked Guangzhou, the Wei-Suo had tensed up; almost every male was "swept up as a soldier," anyone over fifteen given a stick and called an "able-bodied man." Li Ziyu was sent to the walls too, causing the womenfolk to wail to heaven—not just his family, the whole Wei-Suo was a sea of weeping. But Li Ziyu spent only one day on the wall before his uncle quietly swapped him out.

Now it was "proper service." Although still in his "probationary period," patrols no longer had old naturalized police leading them; they had to handle everything alone. Li Ziyu checked the sun; it was slanting west, about early Shen hour (3-5 PM). Long way to go before clocking off. His shift didn't end until midnight.

Daytime was fine. After dark, streets were pitch black, save for a lamp at the watchman's hut. Otherwise, only "wind-defying lanterns" hung before big houses gave off light. Dots of light, like ghost-fires.

On his first independent patrol, Li Ziyu had been trembling. Being paired with Zhao Gui, who looked unreliable, made him even more anxious. Luckily, out of consideration for "rookies," their assigned beat was a residential area—quiet streets, mostly homes. Public order was simpler than in commercial districts. The old Hainan policeman had said: "On this beat, just watch for people dumping trash or pissing in corners."

But Zhao Gui, being honest to a fault, had asked, "If there's only shit and trash but no culprit, what do we do? Should we ask the neighbors..."

He glanced at Zhao Gui walking behind him. Thirty-something, sturdy build. Face... what Li Ziyu called "so honest he can't fart." Wearing the uniform so sloppy looked like a talent. Worst of all, Zhao Gui constantly scratched his crotch unconsciously, on patrol or handling a case. Li Ziyu felt humiliated.

Zhao Gui seemed dim-witted. Reportedly a former day-laborer for big households—in Li Ziyu's view, lower than a slave. Slaves had food and clothes; day-laborers lived hand-to-mouth. How had the Australians recruited this guy? And illiterate too.

Illiteracy aside, Zhao Gui was purely stupid. "Pure illiterates" like him were "Class C Cadets" at the police school. With short training and no time for literacy classes, they couldn't learn theory systematically. They learned "on the job"—basic concept education, physical and drill training, then deployed to stations, paired one-on-one with other police.

Since Li Ziyu was literate, he was paired with Zhao Gui, inheriting the literacy task. If Zhao Gui didn't get his Class C diploma by the mid-year assessment, Zhao would lose half his pay, and Li would lose a third and be disqualified for "excellence" that year. For Li Ziyu, this was pressure and motivation. After every shift, he dragged Ah Gui to learn new characters and speech. First lesson: write his name. "Ah Gui, your surname is Zhao—the Great Song's imperial surname. Your ancestors had virtue. I'll teach you 'Zhao'. In the new script, it's 'Run' (走) plus an 'X'. Right! Like that action you love—walking and scratching your crotch." Ah Gui nodded, half-understanding, and scratched again...

Li Ziyu looked down on Zhao Gui—he was a scholar, yet had to serve alongside such a poor, low-class person. But then he thought: *Officials travel a thousand miles only for money.* The pay was real. And this was a new dynasty; new dynasties used existing people. Even Fan Kuai had been a dog butcher.

Moreover, Zhao Gui was basically his servant now, taking orders without complaint. Since getting Zhao Gui, the Li household had a handyman—chopping wood and carrying water, Ah Gui did it all. Seeing he was diligent and lived alone in a temple, Li Ziyu's parents rented him a side room.

They walked slowly. Each patrol had to pass every "check-in point" at least eight times—about once an hour. No need to rush. The job was simple: question suspicious persons, check road signs and door plates, ensure shops hung licenses and hygiene permits, forbid blocking streets with goods or trash; check if garbage piles and manure jars were covered—important management tasks.

Most residents here were middle-class, with some big households mixed in. The streets were better than the poor alleys—gravel-paved, less trash and sewage. Being residential, few pedestrians were about, aside from women washing vegetables or working with children. Naturally, no "suspicious characters."

A key task was knowing the residents. Pan Jiexin demanded every precinct policeman know every household on his beat like the back of his hand.

"Only when you know clearly how many people, old and young, male and female, are in every house can you spot a 'stranger' at a glance." Pan Jiexin emphasized learning basic populace intelligence.

"Sister-in-law Liu, washing rice?" Li Ziyu greeted a woman squatting by the public well washing a basin of clothes.

"Oh, the two officers. On patrol again?" Sister-in-law Liu wiped her hands on her apron. Plain-looking, but her smile was warm. "Saw you out in the rain the other day; you work hard."

Sister-in-law Liu was an "outgoing" woman on their beat, thirty-something, capable and brisk. Her husband was a pharmacy clerk; she subsidized the family by acting as a "house broker"—though unlicensed, she'd been brokering house sales and rentals here for years.

Glib and well-connected, she was a "activist" valued by the police. The naturalized police instructor told Li Ziyu to contact her often.

When they arrived at the station, the Tithing Group Head led them to every house on the route to show their faces and learn the setup—a basic "Mass Prevention and Cure" method of Mu Min's.

Most commoners feared runners like tigers. As for the new police, they saw them as essentially Australian runners. So the first point of the new police system was harmonizing relations. Use Tithing Heads to introduce them and build familiarity.

"Don't talk deliberately—especially don't use 'official jargon.' Chat about daily life. Relaxed people reveal useful info. Casual gossip can bring important leads," the naturalized policeman said. "You and Zhao Gui have only four eyes and work a few hours. Turn the masses into your eyes and ears."

"Oh, no, no, it's all serving the Senatorial Council and the People." Li Ziyu, being educated, recited the new slogans easily. But he knew worldly ways; after the high tune, he added, "Eating grain, doing service. Since we took the job, we must be worthy of the pay—right, Sister-in-law Liu?"

Honest words. Sister-in-law Liu, a shrewd woman, seeing this handsome young man speak without official airs, felt a fondness. She laughed, "Yes, yes. Since you came, it's much more peaceful. Before, I had to lock the courtyard gate just to dump trash."

In the city, a specific class of low thief existed—slang name "Handful of Cash." Lacking "skill," they waited for common households to leave doors unguarded, darting in to steal whatever was there. If nothing valuable, a broom or hat would do. Low value, but a loss for the people. Typical "small/micro cases" in public order: tiny value, big reaction from residents.
