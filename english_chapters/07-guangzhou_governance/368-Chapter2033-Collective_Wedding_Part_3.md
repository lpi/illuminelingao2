# Chapter 2033 - Collective Wedding (Part 3)

In the September of the Little Ice Age, the weather had turned cool. Though direct sunlight remained oppressive, the open river surface carried refreshing bursts of breeze.

The mighty fleet sailed upon the broad Pearl River against late summer's wind. Colorful flags and ribbons fluttered, fresh flowers swayed, and drum music arrived on the breeze—truly conveying the sensation of floating like immortals. The wealthy landlords observing the spectacle found themselves in high spirits. They produced food boxes and laid out wine and delicacies one after another. Those who had hired flower boats enjoyed even greater convenience; boatmen had long prepared banquets allowing them to drink and make merry while admiring this rare "Australian Scene."

White Swan Pool had traditionally served as a pleasure ground for wealthy and powerful families. Upon hearing the Australians would conduct a "flower boat cruise" here, prosperous households had reserved riverside restaurants, teahouses, and flower boats far in advance, arranging banquets and bringing concubines and beautiful servants. Accompanied by dancing girls and singing boys, they drank and reveled while awaiting the flower boats' arrival.

Those who hadn't capsized during the tax storm had gradually adapted to Australian rule. Merchants particularly—though taxes had multiplied several-fold, after deducting "filial respect" formerly rendered to officials and protection money paid to local gangs and corrupt clerks, the total proved substantially less than before. Since Wen Desi had repeatedly proclaimed the slogan "Founding the Nation on Industry and Commerce" in newspapers, merchants' status had risen sharply while social pressure plummeted. No longer did they maintain the low profile of former days, fearful of attracting high officials' or street rascals' attention and suffering financial loss. Thus, even those not numbered among the twelve sponsors treated this as a prime opportunity for their businesses to "establish reputation and prestige."

The main venue at Great World naturally featured only the twelve sponsors' names. But here at White Swan Pool, no such restriction applied. Along the riverbank, various major businesses hired craftsmen and laborers to erect colorful floral arches in succession. Some imitated the Australians by constructing flower beds. Flower farmers in the Henan area sold out their entire stock of flowers and trees virtually overnight, reaping considerable profit.

At present, along White Swan Pool stood fully one to two hundred arches and flower beds of all dimensions, competing in beauty and clustered with blossoms. Various auspicious phrases adorned them: "Centennial Harmony," "Phoenixes Flying Together," "Holding the Tray to the Eyebrows"—all manner of brain-wracking expressions. Those more astute hired writers to compose billboard-sized slogans like "Long Live the Council of Elders," "Long Live the Sage Son of Heaven of Great Song," "Serve the Council of Elders and the People," and similar declarations. Naturally, each business's name remained indispensable—after all, these conspicuous gestures required witnesses.

The Gao Ju family naturally numbered among the twelve sponsors. As president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Council of Elders' premier "old friend," how could he abstain from such an occasion? Though sponsorship amounts were limited to three hundred yuan per family, he played freely with flower beds and colorful arches by White Swan Pool. He proved generous, instructing Yan Xiaomao to hire the city's finest craft decorators and florists at premium rates, erecting two leading arches at White Swan Pool.

One bore the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce and Industry's name, the other—slightly smaller—Gao Ju's own firm. Both arches ranked among the finest in size and luxury. Beneath them rose a flower bed nearly two people in height. Atop this, a skilled carpenter had fashioned a model based on the "Holy Ship" propaganda images from magazines, floating above a floral sea against a background of red sun tied with red *tongcao* flowers.

Most gentry and wealthy households had suffered grievous losses during the tax investigation. Fearing that excessive action or speech during these turbulent times might violate Australian taboos, most avoided attendance. However, various families' young scions had always loved spectacle and took family troubles lightly. They still summoned friends to witness the "Australian Scene," expressing satisfaction vocally. Such magnificent wonders proved rare even among well-traveled high officials. Amid admiring sighs, all faintly sensed the Australians were "mad"—supporting a few lowborn prostitutes' rehabilitation at such expense suggested either money to burn or dubious mental faculties.

In a restaurant's private room, several figures resembling wealthy young masters overlooked the fleet sailing amid drums and music, conversing as they watched.

"Such extravagance and waste—what do the Australians rely upon to generate wealth?"

"What do they rely upon? Everyone's family property and fields," the speaker replied sourly.

"There you're mistaken. This truly cost the Australians minimal expense—it's all the city's various major households spending money to participate."

"Isn't it merely Gao Ju's twelve families?"

"More than that," the speaker smiled faintly. "If you visit the Temple of the Five Immortals presently, a *Luo Tian Da Jiao* is underway. There's scarcely space remaining for tablets recording 'joyous contributions.' How many major households citywide are rushing to deliver money to Daoist Cui—and if Daoist Cui declines, household heads nearly weep with anxiety. Isn't that a wonder of the world?"

"This Australian art of wealth accumulation is truly invincible beneath heaven. To devise such methods!" Laughter erupted from the private room.

The fleet's passengers naturally remained ignorant of shoreline discussions. The entire armada sailed slowly along the riverbank. The grooms and brides bathed in cool river breezes; whatever their initial mood, their hearts now opened. Such life experience exceeded even dreams! Several women wept joyfully, washing away their makeup, requiring hasty touchups.

Du Yibin currently occupied a painted pleasure boat within the fleet. Originally, he needn't have participated in this cruise—most Elders attending the wedding awaited at Great World—but he couldn't abandon his "precious burden": Song Yingsheng.

Since organizing the matchmaking event, Song Yingsheng's attitude had softened considerably, yet he refused concession on key matters. Helpless, Du Yibin seized every opportunity to let him "experience the new life." Thus Song Yingsheng was again dragged by Du Yibin to participate in this collective wedding. Moreover, Du Yibin specifically reserved Song Yingsheng a seat within the fleet and accompanied him personally.

"I wasn't this enthusiastic pursuing my girlfriend back then," Du Yibin couldn't help complaining.

However, Song Yingsheng didn't appreciate his kindness, claiming "slight indisposition" preventing departure, then alleging "seasickness." Only after Du Yibin exposed all pretexts did he explicitly state he preferred avoiding such large events.

Yet Du Yibin countered that Song had contributed to this collective effort—the characters for "Guangzhou City's First Matchmaking Assembly" bore his calligraphy. These characters were beautifully rendered; Du planned a special article in the *Yangcheng Evening News* collective wedding edition detailing Song Yingsheng's inscription, including appreciation.

Song Yingsheng wanted to weep. Truly, one misstep created eternal regret. He'd written a few characters, and now the Hair thieves wielded this leverage to coerce him. Thus he came to participate in this "unprecedented grand ceremony" "with great difficulty."

At present, he sat upright in the painted pleasure boat's "first-class seat"—the vessel's second-floor pavilion, open on all sides with excellent views. The seat proved not only comfortable but accompanied by tea and snacks. Ordinary major households, unless their "joyous contribution" proved sufficiently substantial, couldn't occupy this position. Song Yingsheng's shabby dress contrasted starkly with the Elder accompanying him to first-class seating. From the outset, he attracted fellow passengers' attention and discussion. When Song observed these wealthy passengers regarding him with varied expressions, he immediately grasped Du Yibin's intention. This ensured that jumping into the Yellow River wouldn't cleanse him! If anyone recognized him, wouldn't the charge of "submitting to the Hair" be firmly established!

Seeing him sitting on pins and needles, Du Yibin understood his thoughts. Not wishing excessive provocation, he comforted: "Mr. Song need not worry excessively. These major households are mostly locals unfamiliar with you, Sir..."

Song Yingsheng snorted proudly, indicating he didn't accept Du Yibin's nonsense. Then he sat upright in silence.

Though silent, the beautiful scenery remained visible along the route. The landscape and arrangements proved certainly grand and magnificent, too beautiful to fully absorb. Yet in Song Yingsheng's mind, this appeared truly excessive and wasteful! If the matchmaking event warranted suspicion of "making mountains from molehills," this collective wedding constituted "making giant mountains from molehills" and "executing it extravagantly." Even with Du Yibin's "human relations" theory as framework, he truly couldn't bear it.

"Too luxurious, too luxurious!" Song Yingsheng shook his head involuntarily. "This was originally a beautiful endeavor—why render it so ostentatious! These represent the people's fat and marrow! Though Guangzhou now enjoys stability, all Guangdong remains mired in endless strife, the people still in deep water and scorching fire. Even within this Guangzhou city, I fear many poor souls lack sufficient food and face uncertain next meals. Why spend this money on such vain displays?"

Du Yibin felt no anger hearing these words. In his view, this old man's simple moral framework fit his values admirably. This compassion for the poor originated from genuine sentiment, not affectation. Crucially, his concern for Guangzhou and Guangdong affairs demonstrated considerable identification with the Council of Elders' regime.

"Mr. Song, don't worry. This money was entirely donated by merchant households in the city, not derived from tax revenue or grain reserves..." he comforted.

"This remains inappropriate," Song Yingsheng shook his head. "Though not from taxes, isn't it still ultimately extracted from the common people? Those merchant households neither farm nor manufacture; they profit from circulating goods—isn't what they earn the people's money? They donate here, then turn around to extract it from the people over there..."

Du Yibin thought: isn't Song Yingsheng's thinking somewhat outdated? Not a trace of his third brother's "advanced nature." Convincing this old man to serve their purposes would still require considerable effort...

He contemplated briefly, then said: "Sir's words are incorrect. Merchants travel in all directions, circulating goods and exchanging what one has for what one lacks—this constitutes beneficial activity. Taking profit from such endeavors proves only natural."
