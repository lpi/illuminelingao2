# Chapter 1835 - Strange and Changeable

Lian Nishang sneered. "This isn't Fangchun Court's land? The land deed is still on file at City Hall."

"Whose land deed it may be, this servant neither knows nor can control," the maid replied. "But this courtyard is now the Liang Residence's outer household. Without orders from my Master or Young Master, no one is permitted to enter. If you wish to investigate a case here, please have your Master send a formal card to this residence. This servant will naturally sweep the steps and wait to receive you." She paused. "As for now, please go back. Pardon me for not seeing you out." Raising her voice, she called: "See—guests—out—"

The maid was arrogant and self-assured, treating Lian Nishang and her group as beneath notice. Li Ziyu knew something of Lian Nishang's temperament—she would yield to soft tactics but never to force, and she harbored extreme hostility toward everything of the Ming, especially officials and gentry, regarding them almost as enemies. He couldn't help but worry secretly that things would blow up beyond control.

*What if she actually drew her gun and shot this woman?* Li Ziyu fretted. Setting aside that this was a "favored" head maid—even if it were an ordinary servant beaten to death, the Liang family wouldn't let it go easily.

Sure enough, Lian Nishang issued a terse order: "Corporal, fix bayonets!"

At the command, the National Army soldiers drew their bayonets in unison. In an instant, they clicked them onto their rifles. A row of snow-bright blades flashed in the courtyard sunlight. The two house guards who had advanced to "see the guests out" couldn't help but shrink back, their expressions turning timid.

At this critical juncture, someone suddenly shouted: "Wait!"

The voice was high and sharp. Everyone in the courtyard froze involuntarily.

Following the voice, a woman came quickly down from the main room, nearly running all the way to Lian Nishang. She fell to her knees with a dull thud, knocked her head heavily upon the ground, and said: "Servant Yue Wan pays respects to this officer."

This sudden reversal was so strange and unexpected that not only were Lian Nishang and her people stunned, but even the servants in the courtyard stood dazed.

Li Ziyu studied her closely. She was perhaps eighteen or nineteen, with beautiful features and luminous eyes. She wore a deep blue brocade skirt dotted with plum blossoms along the hem, and a water-red jacket over it. Her jet-black hair was done up in a *Ruyi* bun, adorned only with a white jade plum blossom hairpin. Simple, yet she projected an unstudied freshness and elegance.

So this was the "mistress" bought out by Master Liang. Li Ziyu reflected that such a woman—though a *laoju*—was someone he could hardly dream of seeing in the past, let alone becoming intimate with.

He had assumed she must be some pampered, flamboyant creature. He never expected she would humble herself so readily.

Lian Nishang also appeared taken aback. Only after a moment did she manage: "You are Yue Wan?"

"Yes, this servant is." Yue Wan replied with head lowered. "Just now this servant was resting in the back and didn't know the officer had arrived. The servants are foolish and rude—they have given great offense. Please don't haggle with them, officer. This servant apologizes here." She kowtowed again. "Any offense against the officer is due to this servant's failure in discipline. Whatever punishment the officer deems fitting, this servant dares not complain."

Li Ziyu had never dreamed the situation would pivot so quickly. Yue Wan's humility immediately deflated Lian Nishang's momentum for a forcible search. For a moment, she couldn't think of an appropriate response.

Sensing this, Yue Wan spoke again: "Officers, please come to the front hall first and allow this servant to serve tea. Whatever orders you have, please give them—this servant will definitely comply and never disobey."

Lian Nishang said: "Stand up and speak." When Yue Wan had risen, she continued: "No need for tea. We stated our purpose just now. We hope you will cooperate with our work."

Yue Wan said "yes" several times. Lian Nishang then asked about Mingnu's whereabouts.

"This girl is indeed in this servant's courtyard, though I don't know if she is called Mingnu..." Yue Wan said. "If the officer is looking for her, this servant will have someone bring her out and hand her over to the officer immediately."

Li Ziyu had expected her to employ every means to deny and deflect. Instead, she admitted everything immediately. Lian Nishang was probably also somewhat surprised. She asked: "If so, why did your maid deny it?"

Yue Wan spoke softly: "It is always this servant's failure in discipline. As you see clearly, she is a favorite in the Liang Residence and is somewhat spoiled." After saying this, she turned. "Suiyun!"

That head maid had been standing with arms akimbo, looking unconvinced. Hearing Yue Wan call her name, she stiffened and replied: "Servant is here."

"Kneel!" Yue Wan commanded. Suiyun trembled all over, her beautiful eyes reddening, but she didn't dare disobey. She dropped to her knees with a thud.

"The officers are handling a case. First, you didn't report to me; second, you didn't discuss with the officers. Rude and arrogant to the extreme! Where did all those books you've read disappear to?!"

Though Suiyun's face showed defiance, she dared not talk back. With every scolding sentence from Yue Wan, she knocked her head upon the ground, saying "Servant deserves death," tears streaming uncontrollably.

Li Ziyu understood this maid was ordinarily proud and arrogant. Being humiliated by Yue Wan like this, her shame and resentment must be unbearable. He couldn't help but feel a faint sympathy stirring within him.

Having scolded her for several sentences, Yue Wan then said: "Liang Quan, Liang Shun—bring the family discipline implements. Beat her forty strokes!"

The servants hastily responded, ran to fetch the implements, dragged Suiyun to the ground, and began beating her with cracking sounds.

"The fault is always this servant's." Yue Wan said humbly. "If anyone else here has done wrong and the officer wishes to take them back for questioning, this servant has no objection. In short—everything is as the officer disposes."

Lian Nishang felt as though she had punched a cotton quilt—there was no resistance to push against. Just as she gathered herself to speak, a servant woman approached from behind, leading a little girl. Li Ziyu recognized her at a glance—it was Mingnu, missing for more than ten days!

She was dressed neatly, and her complexion was fair. Presumably she hadn't suffered much in terms of food and clothing. Only her small face was full of fear and timidity. One could only imagine the terror she had endured these days.

If not for Gao Chongjiu, Lian Nishang, and the Australians, Mingnu would have fallen into the dust forever, condemned eternally! Thinking of how he had been running back and forth these past days, chasing Mingnu's trail everywhere only to come up empty again and again... all manner of bittersweet feelings surged through his heart. He walked forward several steps involuntarily, called out "Mingnu!"— and pulled the timid girl into his arms. Tears fell before he could stop them.

Mingnu had been badly frightened and seemed somewhat dazed. Li Ziyu was the first familiar face she had seen in days—her uncle's good friend. She had been beaten into fearing to cry, but now, held in Li Ziyu's arms, the grievances and terror of so many days suddenly erupted. She wailed loudly. Through her tears, she said:

"Uncle Jade, Uncle Jade, why did you only come now..."

Li Ziyu had originally planned to pretend he didn't know Mingnu, to avoid revealing the tail of "using public office for private gain." But now he could no longer suppress the emotions flooding through him. Hugging Mingnu tightly as though afraid someone would snatch her away, he said: "Uncle Jade came to save you! Don't be afraid! Uncle Jade will take you home right now!" His own voice choked with feeling.

Everyone present was moved. Several police officers understood something of the situation now and sighed one after another. Though Lian Nishang remained expressionless, her eyes too had reddened. She said: "Don't cry anymore. It's good that we found her. Take her back to record a statement first..."

Yue Wan bit her lip tightly, comprehending the full picture. Madam Han had violated a taboo and purchased someone she shouldn't have! This had not only ruined Fangchun Court but would implicate Master Liang's side as well. She trembled: "It was Madam Han who had no eyes! This servant was also confused for a moment—I needed a little maid. Seeing her cleverness, I asked for her, not knowing I was offending the Master's tiger prestige. I deserve ten thousand deaths..." She knelt down again.

Lian Nishang said: "Get up!" A question still lingered in her mind, and she asked: "Since you wanted a little girl to serve you, why did you have to select by birth date and horoscope?"

"Many thanks for the officer's magnanimity." Yue Wan stood and smiled apologetically. "There is a reason for this as well. This servant's health has always been poor. Not long ago, I consulted a physiognomist. He said there was a problem with this servant's fate, and the people serving around me must have compatible attributes to avoid misfortune."

The explanation was reasonable. Lian Nishang nodded. She asked a few more questions about the courtyard's situation. Yue Wan answered clearly, without evasion. While they were talking, a house guard came to report: "The forty strokes are finished. Please give instructions, Miss."

Li Ziyu glanced toward the courtyard and saw Suiyun—who had been so domineering moments ago—lying on a bench with disheveled hair, face covered in sweat, trembling all over from pain.

Yue Wan, who had been smiling, changed her expression and said coldly: "Beat another twenty."

The house guard was taken aback but dared not disobey. He retreated to continue the punishment. The cracking sound of boards rising and falling in the courtyard mingled with Suiyun's gradually fading groans of pain. Those present showed expressions of discomfort.

A master punishing a slave was not illegal, so long as no one died. Moreover, this was the Liang family's domestic affair and irrelevant to the case—Lian Nishang naturally couldn't interfere. As for the Liang family servants, they dared not say a word.

At that moment, Zhao Gui suddenly interjected. He stepped forward and addressed Yue Wan: "Yue... Miss, don't beat anymore... she will die..."

Yue Wan had not paid him any attention—though he wore the Australian yamen runner's uniform, he exuded a rustic, dull air from head to toe. She hadn't expected him to suddenly interject and plead for mercy. She hesitated and said: "This officer is kind-hearted! Sir, rest assured—this is a light board. This servant was beaten with the same since childhood. It won't kill anyone! Disciplining her with a few more strokes now is for her own good!"

Seeing the very unpleasant expression on Lian Nishang's face, she hastily added: "Since this officer has spoken, let's spare her this time!" Turning her head, she called to the courtyard: "Stop."

"I had originally decided never to spare her lightly. But since this officer pleads for you," Yue Wan said sternly, "you should thank him!"

Suiyun could no longer move on her own. Two servant women supported her left and right, barely managing to bring her to the steps. She knelt before Zhao Gui and panted: "Thank you for your grace, officer..." She began to kowtow.

Zhao Gui waved his hands in a fluster: "No, no. Don't kowtow."

Yue Wan said: "Today, with this officer pleading for you, we'll let it pass. If there is such arbitrary and domineering behavior in the future, I will break your legs!"
