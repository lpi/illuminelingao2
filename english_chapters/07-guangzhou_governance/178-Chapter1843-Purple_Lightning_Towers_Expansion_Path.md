# Chapter 1843 - Purple Lightning Tower's Expansion Path

The moment she returned to Guangzhou, several wealthy young masters who were regulars at Purple Lightning Tower had appeared one after another, hosting banquets to "wash away the dust" for her. Scions from families still holding official Ming status dared not come in person, but they too sent gifts with word that they had "caught a slight cold" and would "visit another day."

The noon banquet had been enjoyable for host and guests alike. After seeing off the last wave of visitors, Pei Lixiu's head was still swimming, but her spirits ran high. She returned to her General Manager's Office.

Her secretary, Xia He, welcomed her into the lounge with a face wreathed in smiles, helped her settle in, and brought the sobering soup. After Han Yue's sudden transfer, Xia He—who had been marginalized—had regained authority over Purple Lightning Tower's inner chamber, becoming once again the establishment's foremost "favorite."

Her mood was naturally buoyant. Recent news that Han Yue had been suddenly arrested had put a spring in Xia He's step. Even the staff throughout Purple Lightning Tower knew that Secretary Xia had a "happy event" to celebrate.

"Do drink a little less at social engagements. It may be fruit wine, but it still takes a toll on the body." Xia He delivered the latest issue of *Guangzhou Social Situation* as she spoke, the pages still emitting bursts of fresh ink.

"Reuniting with old friends, a few extra cups are inevitable. Besides, as the company develops, we'll need their continued support." Pei Lixiu rubbed her temples. She flipped casually through *Guangzhou Social Situation* and found the latest report on the Mingnu Disappearance Case.

She was strangely interested in this affair—not because of any concern for protecting the rights of women and children, but because of Dong Mingdang, who featured in the report. She knew Dong Mingdang. When she had still been the Guangzhou Prefect's daughter—albeit one of low standing in the Dong household—Purple Lightning Tower had cultivated social ties with Dong Mingdang and her mother, laying groundwork for future contingencies. At the time, this illegitimate miss had left little impression. But Dong Mingdang's performance in the Mingnu incident had given Pei Lixiu cause to look at her with new eyes.

This kind of thinking was nothing remarkable in the hype-driven twenty-first century, but in the seventeenth century, it was simply not something ordinary people possessed.

"I hadn't realized this little girl had such deep waters in her mind—using this incident to promote her own shop. Why didn't I discover she had such business talent back then? Opening a shop herself and publicizing it—she really has some skills."

*Why didn't I recognize her potential?* Pei Lixiu mused. *It seems the new society is better at discovering talent.* She was not particularly interested in reforming society, but suddenly she seemed to understand why the Senators were so enthusiastic about it.

She flipped casually to the second page. It contained the record of the first "big tiger" brought down in the sex industry rectification campaign: Fangchun Court. The report in *Social Situation* was written without emotional coloring, narrating facts straightforwardly, and was far more detailed than public reports.

The rectification of the sex industry was what Pei Lixiu cared about most. What she had obtained from Lingao was not investment but "policy." How much of this policy could actually be implemented depended entirely on the results of the rectification.

Because Fangchun Court was the first large brothel found guilty of "forcing free persons into prostitution" and "private trafficking of persons," it had been made into a typical example. After the work team officially took residence, the brothel was essentially "destroyed."

The "root-digging" movement carried out by the work team in Fangchun Court—after Lian Nishang had severely interrogated the power-holders within, such as Han Qiaojie, Huang Xiang, Muyun, and Yao-sao—caused the seemingly dead-calm establishment to erupt like a volcano.

Not only did prostitutes come forward one after another to accuse the abuse and exploitation they had suffered, but even *majie*, servant women, and *doufenshui* followed suit to "expose" and "accuse." For a time, everyone pushed against the falling wall. Even claws and teeth like Huang Xiang and Yao-sao wept bitterly while recounting their own "miserable histories," expressing determination to "draw a clear line" with Han Qiaojie and "wash their hearts and renew themselves."

Pei Lixiu skipped past the prostitutes' complaints and the madam's crimes at the front, falling directly to the detailed inventory of Fangchun Court's situation at the back. It listed in detail the floor area, building structure, personnel composition, and fixed assets, allowing Pei Lixiu to fully assess how large this piece of "meat" was and how much of it she could eat.

Purple Lightning Tower was a state-owned enterprise directly under the Planning Commission. Though it couldn't claim "First-Class National Policy Company" status, it remained an important source of the Senate's current revenue. In the past, this distinction hadn't mattered much—it was merely one of countless straws inserted into the Great Ming to draw blood. But now circumstances had changed. Purple Lightning Tower operated in Guangzhou but answered directly to the Planning Commission. Its profits and taxes flowed to the central government. As for the Guangzhou Municipal Government, there was only land tax revenue.

In other words, if Purple Lightning Tower Entertainment Co., Ltd. grew bigger and stronger, it would be the Planning Commission feasting on meat. Mayor Liu's office, at best, would get to drink the soup.

Moreover, Purple Lightning Tower's expansion plan had its eyes on properties confiscated during Guangzhou's public morals rectification campaign. The attitude of Guangzhou Special Municipality toward Purple Lightning Tower's expansion plan could easily be imagined.

During Pei Lixiu's trip to Lingao, many people had pointed out this "center versus local" issue—some obliquely, some directly.

"It's uncertain whether this piece of meat, Fangchun Court, can be eaten smoothly." Pei Lixiu set down *Social Situation* and murmured to herself.

"Chief, Su Ai has arrived. Shall I invite her in?"

"She's here? Please do." Pei Lixiu's spirits lifted. Since Su Ai had been rescued from Zhaoqing by Thorpe, she had been settled at Purple Lightning Tower. Having nowhere else to turn, and being a famous courtesan unable to perform manual labor, she had no place to shelter except for "service enterprises" like Purple Lightning Tower. Fortunately, she was a "Yangzhou Thin Horse" by background, so coming to Purple Lightning Tower suited her profession. She now specialized in reception and training work.

"Chief."

Su Ai walked in and adjusted her attire respectfully before bowing. Though this wasn't their first meeting, she remained extremely deferential. After her bow, she stood aside with hands clasped, waiting for instructions.

In the past, privately, she had been Pei Lixiu's "handkerchief sister"—a boudoir confidante who shared everything. Publicly, she had been the most favored concubine beside the dignified Guangzhou Touring Censor. For Pei Lixiu to associate with her back then had been climbing the social ladder.

Now everything was reversed. Pei Lixiu was not only a Senator of the Senate that officially ruled Guangzhou and even all of Guangdong—"noble beyond words" in the Great Song—she was also the proprietor of this very Purple Lightning Tower where Su Ai now sheltered and earned her living. Su Ai herself was merely a "stray dog," relying on past friendship to muddle through under Pei Lixiu's hand. These distinctions could not be mistaken.

Therefore, since arriving at Purple Lightning Tower, she had never presumed on their old friendship. She remained respectful and humble at all times.

Pei Lixiu had grown accustomed to her manner and found it rather comfortable. She waved her hand and said amiably, "Why such formality between sisters? Sit, sit—chat with me for a while."

"Yes. Many thanks to the Chief." Su Ai replied softly and seated herself carefully on a lower stool.

Pei Lixiu had summoned Su Ai not to reminisce or discuss poetry and lyrics—Su Ai had known back then that Miss Pei was something of an airhead. Setting aside poetry and song, even when it came to writing a few characters, she was inferior to a maid from a scholarly household. At best she could recognize some common words.

In the noble ladies' salon at Purple Lightning Tower in the old days, Pei Lixiu had played nothing more than the role of a hospitable and enthusiastic hostess. When it came to refined pursuits, she was entirely ignorant.

What Pei Lixiu was actually calculating concerned Fangchun Court. Though she had never been there herself, she'd heard people say it was one of the premier large brothels in the city. Not only were the buildings magnificent, but the location was excellent. If Purple Lightning Tower could occupy it, the benefits to future business development would be immense.

But that was only one consideration. Pei Lixiu's ambitions didn't stop there. In her view, the abundant manpower in the old brothels was also a considerable resource—suitable candidates to supplement Purple Lightning Tower's ever-expanding workforce, greatly beneficial for diversified operations.

However, as a modern woman, she knew nothing about old-style brothels, and she found the mentality of "practitioners" within even harder to comprehend.

Fortunately, she now had Su Ai. Su Ai came from a famous courtesan background in Jiangnan. The various routines of brothels could not be hidden from her; she was precisely the resource Pei Lixiu needed to rely on.

That said, Su Ai was a "Yangzhou Thin Horse" by origin. Her skills in serving men were first-rate, but when it came to practical management, she was out of her depth. Moreover, years of living by selling smiles had fostered in her a strong dependency mentality. Being a consultant was acceptable, but standing alone to take charge of work was beyond her. Someone else—reliable and capable—would have to be found.

Turning these thoughts over, Pei Lixiu opened her mouth and asked, "Sister Su, I've heard you came from a Jiangnan brothel in the past?"

When Su Ai had still been Censor Gao's concubine, this question would have been impolite to ask. Even for a famous courtesan, the background wasn't necessarily something to boast about. Now, naturally, there was nothing to be coy about.

"Yes, this servant was in a Yangzhou brothel in the past," Su Ai answered.

Though Pei Lixiu had told her several times to stop calling herself "this servant," she still used the humble term.

"Then you must be very familiar with the rules and workings of the brothel."

"Naturally. This servant was in the brothel from childhood until Lord Gao redeemed me at nineteen. I witnessed much of what went on inside—I know a bit about matters high and low."

"Then how familiar is Sister Su with local brothels here?"

Famous courtesans like Su Ai were born with keen minds. She was literate and read newspapers every day, keeping abreast of various developments in the Guangzhou market. With barely a moment's thought, she understood Pei Lixiu's meaning—she had her eyes on Fangchun Court!

Su Ai felt no surprise at all. Since ancient times, officials bullying the people and seizing property had been common fare. When certain parties had sought to suppress the Australians back then, the plain truth was that someone had coveted Australian property and tried to force "donations"—and when that failed, trouble ensued. The Great Ming officials had "started it," so one could hardly blame the Australians for "finishing it." Guangzhou was now the Australians' domain; choosing the fat to devour was only natural.
