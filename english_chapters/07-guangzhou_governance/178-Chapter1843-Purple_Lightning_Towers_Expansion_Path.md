# Chapter 1843 - Purple Lightning Tower's Expansion Path

As soon as she returned to Guangzhou, several rich young masters who were regulars at Purple Lightning Tower popped up one by one, hosting a banquet in Purple Lightning Tower to "wash away the dust" for her. Scions from families with official Ming status dared not come, but they also sent people to deliver gifts, expressing that they "caught a cold occasionally" and would "visit another day."

The noon banquet was enjoyable for both guests and host. Sending away the last wave of guests, although Pei Lixiu's head was dizzy, her spirit was extremely excited. She returned to her "General Manager's Office."

Her secretary Xia He welcomed her into the lounge with a face full of spring breeze, helped her settle down, and brought "sobering soup." After Han Yue was suddenly transferred away, Xia He, who had been marginalized, regained the power of Purple Lightning Tower's "inner chamber," becoming the number one "favorite" of Purple Lightning Tower.

Her mood was naturally good. The recent news that Han Yue was suddenly arrested made Xia He walk with wind. Even the employees up and down Purple Lightning Tower knew Secretary Xia had a "happy event."

"Drink a few cups less at social engagements. Although it's fruit wine, it hurts the body after all." Xia He said while delivering the latest "Guangzhou Social Situation," which still emitted bursts of ink fragrance.

"Reuniting with old friends, it's inevitable to drink a few more cups. Besides, the company will develop in the future, and we can't do without their support." Pei Lixiu rubbed her temples. She flipped through "Guangzhou Social Situation" casually and saw the latest report on the Mingnu Disappearance Case inside.

She was strangely interested in this case—not because of protecting the rights and interests of women and children, but because of Dong Mingdang who appeared in the report. She knew Dong Mingdang. When she was still the daughter of the Guangzhou Prefect, although her status in the Dong Residence wasn't high, Purple Lightning Tower still socialized with Dong Mingdang and her mother for the purpose of placing idle chess pieces. However, she didn't leave much impression on this illegitimate miss. Dong Mingdang's performance in the Mingnu incident this time made Pei Lixiu look at her with new eyes.

This line of thinking naturally counted as nothing in the hype-prevailing 21st century, but in the 17th century, it was simply not something ordinary people possessed!

"I didn't expect this little girl to have great ravines in her chest (strategy/depth). Using this matter to promote her own shop. Why didn't I discover she had such business talent back then? Opening a shop herself and advertising, she really has some means."

Why didn't I discover she was this kind of material back then? It seems the new society can discover talents better. Pei Lixiu was actually not too interested in reforming society, but suddenly seemed to understand why the Senators were especially enthusiastic about this.

She flipped to the second page casually. It was the record of rectifying the first "big tiger" in the wind industry rectification action—Fangchun Court. The report in "Social Situation" didn't contain much emotional coloring, recording facts in a narrative way, and the content was much more detailed than public reports.

The rectification of the sex industry was what Pei Lixiu cared about most. What she got from Lingao was not investment, but "policy." How much this "policy" could be implemented depended entirely on the results of the sex industry rectification.

Because Fangchun Court was the first large brothel found guilty of "forcing free people into prostitution" and "private trafficking of population," as a typical example, after the working group officially stationed in, this brothel was basically "destroyed."

The "digging roots" movement carried out by the working group in Fangchun Court, after Lian Nishang severely tortured the "power holders" in the courtyard like Han Qiaojie, Huang Xiang, Muyun, and Yao-sao, made the originally seemingly calm-as-dead-water Fangchun Court erupt like a volcano.

Not only did prostitutes come out one after another to accuse the abuse and exploitation they suffered, but even *majie*, servant women, and "doufenshui" also followed to "expose" and "accuse." For a time, everyone pushed the falling wall. Even claws and teeth like Huang Xiang and Yao-sao wept bitterly telling their own "miserable history," expressing determination to "draw a clear line" with Han Qiaojie and "wash their hearts and renew their faces to be new people."

Pei Lixiu skipped the prostitutes' complaints and the makam's crimes in the front, falling directly to the detailed introduction of Fangchun Court's situation in the back. It listed in detail Fangchun Court's floor area, building structure, personnel composition, fixed asset situation, etc., allowing Pei Lixiu to fully assess how big this piece of "meat" was and how much she could eat herself.

Purple Lightning Tower was a state-owned enterprise directly under the Planning Commission. Although it couldn't count as a "First-Class National Policy Company," it was also an important source of the Senate's current finance. In the past, this naturally didn't matter; it was just one of the countless straws inserted into the Great Ming to suck blood. Now it was different. Purple Lightning Tower was in Guangzhou but was a SOE directly under the Planning Commission. Profits and taxes all went to the central government. As for the Guangzhou Municipal Government, there was only land tax revenue.

In other words, if Purple Lightning Tower Entertainment Co., Ltd. became bigger and stronger, it was the Planning Commission eating meat. Mayor Liu here, at best, would drink a mouthful of soup.

Moreover, Purple Lightning Tower's expansion plan aimed at the property confiscated in Guangzhou's rectification of public morals action. The attitude of Guangzhou Special Municipality towards Purple Lightning Tower's expansion plan could be imagined.

During Pei Lixiu's trip to Lingao, many people pointed out this "Central and Local" issue either implicitly or directly.

"It's not certain if this piece of meat, Fangchun Court, can be eaten smoothly." Pei Lixiu put down "Social Situation" and muttered to herself.

"Chief, Su Ai is here. Should we invite her in?"

"She's here? Invite her in." Pei Lixiu's spirit was lifted. Since Su Ai was rescued from Zhaoqing by Thorpe, she had been settled in Purple Lightning Tower. having nowhere to turn to, and being a famous courtesan who couldn't carry with shoulders or lift with hands, she indeed had no place to settle down except for "service enterprises" like Purple Lightning Tower. Fortunately, she was a "Yangzhou Thin Horse" by origin, so coming to Purple Lightning Tower counted as matching her profession. She specialized in some reception and training work.

"Chief."

Su Ai walked in, respectfully adjusting her dress and bowing. Although it wasn't the first time they met, she was still extremely submissive. After bowing, she immediately stood aside with lowered hands waiting for orders.

In the past, privately she was Pei Lixiu's "handkerchief sister," a boudoir friend who talked about everything; publicly, she was the most favored concubine beside the dignified Guangzhou Touring Censor. For Pei Lixiu to associate with her, that was social climbing.

Now it was quite different. Pei Lixiu was not only a Senator of the Senate officially ruling Guangzhou city and even the whole Guangdong, "noble beyond words" in the Great Song; she was also the big shopkeeper of this Purple Lightning Tower where she sheltered and made a living. She herself was just a "stray dog," relying on past friendship to muddle through a meal under her hands. This relationship couldn't be mistaken.

Therefore, after arriving at Purple Lightning Tower, she never dared to pose as Pei Lixiu's "old friend," always being respectful and humble.

Pei Lixiu was used to her style and felt quite comfortable in her heart. She waved her hand and said politely:

"Why are we sisters polite about this? Sit, sit, chat with me for a while."

"Yes, many thanks to the Chief." Su Ai said in a low voice, sitting down carefully on the lower stool.

Pei Lixiu called Su Ai over, naturally not to reminisce or talk about poetry and lyrics—Su Ai knew back then that this Miss Pei was a straw bag (airhead). Let alone poetry and songs, even writing a few characters, she was inferior to a maid from a scholarly family. At best, she recognized a few characters.

In the past noble ladies' salon of Purple Lightning Tower, Pei Lixiu played nothing more than a hospitable and enthusiastic hostess. When it came to elegant things, she knew nothing.

Pei Lixiu was actually calculating about Fangchun Court—although she hadn't been to Fangchun Court, she heard people say it was one of the top big brothels in the city. Not only were the houses magnificent, but the geographical location was also excellent. If Purple Lightning Tower could occupy it, it would be greatly beneficial to future business development.

This was one thing. Pei Lixiu's ambition didn't stop there. In her view, the abundant manpower in the old brothels was also a considerable resource, suitable candidates to supplement Purple Lightning Tower's increasingly expanding employee team, greatly beneficial for carrying out diversified operations.

However, she was a modern woman after all, knowing nothing about old-style brothels, and finding the thinking mode of the "practitioners" within even harder to understand.

Fortunately, she now had Su Ai. Su Ai was from a famous courtesan background in Jiangnan. The various routines of brothels naturally couldn't be hidden from her; she was exactly the object to rely on.

However, Su Ai was a "Yangzhou Thin Horse" by origin. Her skill in serving men was first-class, but when it came to specific handling and management, she was beyond her ability. Moreover, years of living by selling smiles made her have a strong dependency psychology. Being a consultant was okay, but standing alone to take charge of work wouldn't do. Someone else reliable and capable had to be found...

Thinking, Pei Lixiu opened her mouth and asked: "Sister Su, I heard you came from a Jiangnan brothel in the past?"

This question, when Su Ai was still Censor Gao's "Concubine," was not popular to ask. Even for a famous courtesan, it wasn't necessarily glorious. Now naturally there was nothing to taboo.

"Yes, this servant was in a Yangzhou brothel in the past." Su Ai didn't know why Miss Pei suddenly asked about the past, and answered.

Although Pei Lixiu told her several times not to call herself "this servant" anymore, she still used this humble term.

"Then you must be very familiar with the rules of the brothel."

"Naturally. This servant was in the brothel since childhood until redeemed by Lord Gao at nineteen. I saw much of the matters in the brothel, knowing a bit about things up and down."

"Then how much does Sister know about local brothels?"

Famous courtesans like Su Ai were born with an exquisite heart. She was literate and read newspapers every day, knowing various disturbances in the Guangzhou market. With a turn of her brain, she immediately knew Pei Lixiu's meaning—she had her eyes on Fangchun Court!

She didn't feel surprised at all. Since ancient times, officials bullying people and seizing others' property was a common meal—when they wanted to suppress the Australians back then, plainly speaking, it was also because someone eyed the Australians' property and forced them to donate, causing the trouble when it failed. The Great Ming officials did the first (started it), so don't blame the Australians for doing the fifteenth (retaliating/finishing it). Guangzhou was now the Australians' world; choosing the fat to eat was a matter of course!
