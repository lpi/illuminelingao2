# Chapter 1725: The Surrendered Persons

This time, before entering the city, he had estimated that if the officials didn't surrender and committed suicide, the family members would probably follow in death—in this time-space, there was no such thing as preferential treatment for prisoners or kindness towards women and children. Once defeated and captured, men would be beheaded, and women would be sent to brothels as a matter of course. Unless the victor was willing to show mercy—which was quite rare.

This time, some of Prefect Dong's female relatives were actually still alive, which was quite strange. He couldn't help but ask again: "What happened?"

"They were originally going to die honorably, but for some reason they hesitated for a moment. By the time they were about to hang themselves, the Heavenly Army had already arrived—so they were saved." Wei Bifu said, "This humble official believes their resolve to die was not firm."

"This is understandable. Even ants cling to life."

"Yes." Wei Bifu lowered his head and said, "Does Your Excellency want to call them over for questioning?"

"No need," Liu Xiang shook his head. "Just lead the way."

Beside the Flower Hall, there was a side courtyard, which was the residence of the personal secretaries. Wei Bifu said the secretaries' whereabouts were currently unknown, and they had probably gone into hiding.

Behind the Flower Hall was the Prefect's daily living quarters, similar to an ordinary wealthy family. The rear courtyard also had a small garden, slightly adorned with springs and stones for rest and relaxation.

Liu Xiang saw that the furniture in the hall was in disarray, and various clothes and valuables were strewn all over the ground. A tea tray of red sandalwood was lying on the ground, and several cups were smashed to pieces... One could imagine the fear, chaos, and despair this family had experienced before Prefect Dong's death by poison. Liu Xiang felt quite moved.

Wei Bifu carefully accompanied "Lord Liu" on the inspection. He saw that the Fubo Army soldiers who had rushed in early in the morning were standing guard at various doorways and steps, each standing ramrod straight with eyes straight ahead. Even with all kinds of valuables and gold pearls strewn about on the ground before them, they were unmoved. He was secretly amazed in his heart—if it were anyone else, the rear quarters would probably have already turned into a battlefield of fighting over loot, and the valuables would probably be so thoroughly looted that not even a tea cup would be left!

However, those collecting the valuables were another group of Fake Hair-shorn. They worked in teams of three. One person carried a small wooden box and a bag on his back for transporting valuables; one person held a ledger and a dip pen, with an ink bottle hanging from his neck, solely responsible for registration and recording. Another person was responsible for picking up items, and for each item picked up, he would hold it up and shout.

"One gilt silver step-shake inlaid with kingfisher feathers!"

"One half-worn blue patterned satin vest!"

"One piece of broken Chao silver, weight unknown!"

"One string of copper coins, over a hundred! Not counted!"

...

Such shouts rose one after another in the halls. There were also special personnel overseeing them. Wei Bifu thought to himself: the old saying was that the Hair-shorn thieves were meticulous as hair and treated every coin as if their life depended on it. Seeing it today, it was indeed true!

However, he didn't dare show this thought. He just kept his head bowed and back stooped, awaiting instructions. At this time, a naturalized citizen worker jogged over, stood before Liu Xiang and bowed: "Chief!"

Liu Xiang knew they were from the Planning Institute's Special Search Team. Just the private property of the Prefect in the yamen was probably considerable, and they could make a good profit again. He smiled and said: "No need for formalities. How long have you been here? Have you finished inventorying the treasury?"

"Three hours." The cadre replied crisply and efficiently. "Most of the front areas have been searched. The treasury will be inventoried tomorrow. The rear quarters are today's focus and need to be carefully examined."

"Good haul?"

The cadre looked a bit embarrassed: "Honestly, the haul is not much. Whether in the secretary's residence or here, we haven't found large sums of silver. There are quite a few valuables though. We're preparing to dig for hidden caches next."

"Oh, do you have any leads?"

"Yes. Although many of Prefect Dong's family members have already fled, his steward and personal attendant have both been captured. Once we've interrogated them all, we'll find it—and if not, we have our own methods. We definitely won't let the silver grow mold underground."

"Good, hurry up. Clean up the house so guests can come. I'm waiting to use this place."

"Yes, Chief. We will be as quick as possible."

Liu Xiang gave a rough look around the prefectural yamen. Seeing that there were many buildings, and the architecture was also high and spacious, much better than the conditions at Wuyang Post Station, he decided to temporarily set up the Guangzhou Municipal Government here. Although according to the plan, the Senate intended to start anew on the Henan Island and build a "Guangzhou New City," with the administrative center to be set up in the new city area, their main work for now still had to be carried out in this old city area.

Instead of coming in and out of the city every time he dealt with affairs, it would be more convenient to open his office here.

Liu Xiang had also considered the Guangdong Provincial Administration Commission yamen, but on second thought, it was better to leave that for Commissioner Wen's Guangdong Greater Region headquarters. Besides, as Guangzhou Mayor, he still had the Nanhai and Panyu county yamens to use. Moreover, Guangzhou being a provincial capital, yamens and government offices lined both sides of Chengxuan Street like trees. There were also many large temples in the city. There were plenty of transitional housing options, and there was no need to rush to grab buildings.

He immediately decided to set up the Guangzhou Military Control Commission in the Guangzhou Prefectural Yamen. He then instructed that the surviving and remaining surrendered officials and their families in the prefectural yamen should move out as soon as possible to vacate the buildings.

According to the takeover plan, the surrendered persons in the city, their families, and property would all be resettled at the Guangdong Imperial Examination Hall on Dashi Street at the foot of Yuexiu Mountain. The Examination Hall was vast in area with numerous buildings, enough to accommodate surrendered and captured Ming Dynasty officials. More important officials and their families would be sent to Guangxiao Temple for screening. Surrendered generals and soldiers would all be sent to Hong Kong Island for reorganization.

Liu Xiang looked around and saw that the Flower Hall was mostly tidied up. He then instructed that the surrendered persons of the one prefecture and two counties of Guangzhou be received in the Flower Hall. Led by Guangzhou Vice Prefect Wei Bifu, below were county assistants, registrars, constables, educational directors, fishery commissioners, patrolmen... various ranked and unranked officials, as well as the clerks and foremen of the three classes and six departments at the prefectural and county levels... They stood densely packed in the courtyard. Yet not a single cough was heard.

Liu Xiang instructed Wei Bifu to call out names. The surrendered persons came up one by one to pay their respects. Liu Xiang asked a few questions and then dismissed them. This was not him putting on airs of authority, but actually getting a general sense of the surrendered persons' situations to see if they could be utilized. What disappointed him slightly was that not only had the Prefect committed suicide, but even the magistrates of Nanhai and Panyu counties had also killed themselves. Almost all who surrendered were assistant officials.

Assistant officials were far less influential. The Great Ming didn't necessarily have "popular support," but "official support for the Ming" was indeed a fact. If the External Intelligence Bureau could have gotten a few local senior officials to surrender this time, it would have been very useful for future pacification by proclamation. After all, senior officials served as weathervanes.

However, the whereabouts of officials in other yamens were no longer within Liu Xiang's authority. His calculations could only be made within the territory of this Guangzhou Prefecture—if only there were proper chief officials from the other prefectures and counties under Guangzhou Prefecture who could "turn to the light."

Looking at it now, Wei Bifu was quite a character. Although his true ability was unknown, at least he was enthusiastic enough about "leading the way." He could temporarily be called upon to help with affairs.

After receiving the surrendered persons, Wei Bifu came forward again and said: "To welcome the Imperial Envoy, we humble officials have prepared gifts to express our humble intentions. We humbly beseech the Senate and Lord Liu to accept them."

The surrendered persons had presented ten thousand liang of silver, as well as many precious items—aloe incense, jade belts, pure gold jewelry, jade pots, and other precious objects. A rough look suggested they were also worth several tens of thousands of liang.

The gifts were divided into two portions. The larger one was presented to the Senate; the smaller was naturally a gift for Liu Xiang.

Liu Xiang said: "The various items presented by Wei Bifu and the others show your loyal hearts. The portion presented to the Senate, I will accept. As for the gifts to me personally, I will take none of them. Take them all back." Wei Bifu and the other surrendered persons hurried to kneel on the ground and repeatedly begged: "If Your Excellency accepts nothing, we humble officials are truly uneasy. We humbly beseech you to kindly accept a portion!" Liu Xiang, seeing their words were sincere and earnest, ordered his secretary to accept one jade pot, and all the rest was returned.

Liu Xiang then "admonished" them a few words, nothing more than telling them to "not carry burdens," "study hard, accept reform, and strive to serve the Senate and the people as soon as possible"...

After the lecture, he instructed the surrendered persons to disperse, keeping only Wei Bifu and several veteran clerks from the original Guangzhou Prefecture and the Nanhai and Panyu county yamens. He inquired about the local conditions of Guangzhou.

Liu Xiang had the Planning Institute personnel inventory and record all the valuables clearly, and even the jade pot he had accepted was turned over to public funds. Seeing this, several surrendered persons secretly marveled: they said the Australians were greedy, and truly they counted every penny, yet their Senators were each as pure as water. What a strange way of thinking!

Then he chatted very casually with the surrendered persons about the basic situation in Guangzhou.

What he cared about most was population. Population was not only labor but also a consumer market. Guangzhou was not like Qiongshan—even now, Qiongshan's urban population hadn't exceeded 40,000 people—Guangzhou was one of the mega-cities of the 17th century. Just feeding the non-agricultural population was a major task. Especially since Guangdong was not yet fully occupied, the grain supply from Guangxi would also be cut off for a considerable period. Understanding exactly how many non-agricultural people there were, and what the self-sufficiency rate of grain, firewood, cloth, and other daily necessities was, would enable the organization of effective trade supply channels and avoid crises caused by insufficient supply.

However, the feedback received was not satisfactory. The population statistics figures he could get were still the Yellow Register figures stored by the prefectural and county yamens—Liu Xiang had already experienced the accuracy of the Yellow Register figures back in Qiongshan.

According to the Yellow Register and estimates from the Household Department clerks, Nanhai County had 38,000 households, Panyu County slightly fewer. Guangzhou City had a total of about 60,000 households, with a population of around 200,000. The true figures were probably somewhat higher. The population of the entire Guangzhou Prefecture was probably between 500,000 and 600,000.

Liu Xiang started to lose his mind. Although the Yellow Register listed detailed categories of households like military households, craftsman households, force households, and so on, in reality, these household classifications had become meaningless by the late Ming. Military households didn't necessarily serve as soldiers, and craftsman households weren't necessarily craftsmen. Deriving non-agricultural population figures from these would require great imagination.

"We still need to do a population census," Liu Xiang murmured to himself, making a note in his notebook.

After talking for a while, when there was a lull, his naturalized citizen secretary, Guo, walked in and said softly: "Chief, the young lady of the Dong family wants to see you."
