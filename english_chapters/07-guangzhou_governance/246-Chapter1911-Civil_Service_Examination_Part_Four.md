# Chapter 1911 - Civil Service Examination (Part Four)

Dong Yizhi felt somewhat proud, enjoying the feeling of making decisions for the people. However, that afternoon Shen Ruiming came to raise objections, believing he had "arbitrarily changed the rules" and was guilty of "not abiding by the law"... leaving Dong Yizhi feeling quite snubbed—because the age limit had originally been set by him. Others questioned how the household registration work was being done, letting people report whatever age they pleased, which made Mu Min's expression very ugly.

Finally, Lin Baiguang stepped in to smooth things over, saying that this exam, besides selecting talent, also had the intent of "winning over popular sentiment." The old men had "earnest desire to serve," and such enthusiasm shouldn't be discouraged. Furthermore, the literate population in the old society was small to begin with; using age as a barrier would reduce it even further.

Finally, he proposed a compromise: immediately issue a public notice stating that to meet the enthusiastic demand of the masses to take the exam, the age limit for this exam would be cancelled. Anyone over eighteen years of age, in good health and without disability, could apply. As for those who lied about their age on household registrations to register, they must correct it themselves before the exam; otherwise, their exam qualification would be cancelled and they would face legal accountability. As for whether to prosecute certain candidates for making noise at the registration site, Lin Baiguang felt: "...Current public sentiment can be used; some matters are better treated with leniency than severity. Otherwise, we lose the intention of legislation and governance."

On the day of the exam, Yuan Shuzhi and Zeng Juan rose early. Zeng Juan's mother had long prepared two exam baskets. Since ancient times, candidates entering the examination hall always prepared this set. Whether it was the college exam, provincial exam, or metropolitan exam, all consisted of three sessions, each lasting three days. Though called three days, in reality one entered the hall the night before the first day, received the paper at midnight (zi hour) the next day, and handed it in the morning of the third day.

Candidates in the examination hall not only had to write essays but also eat, drink, and relieve themselves, so all items needed for these activities, even bedding, had to be prepared. However, candidates ranged from rich to poor, so there was a world of difference between their exam baskets and contents.

Zeng Juan's family had never produced a scholar, and Zeng Juan had never sat for the college exam. These two exam baskets were borrowed by Zeng Juan's mother from old neighbors—items belonging to old *xiucai* who had studied and taken exams all their lives. The bamboo-woven baskets, having weathered decades of wind, rain, smoke, and fire, were dark yellow and dim, their original color indiscernible, but the items were sturdy.

Zeng Juan's mother had prepared everything required: the four treasures of the study, copper slightly, canopy top, door curtain, stove, candle stand, candle snuffer, scroll bag, stove charcoal; also examination food: dim sum, lotus seeds, dried longan, fried rice, pickled melon, ginger, asafoetida...

So many things couldn't fit in one basket, so there was also a bedding roll. Wealthy families naturally had servants carry these to the gate; once inside, they could spend a few coins to have the hall's servicemen or old soldiers carry them. Ordinary families had to use their own labor. Those even lower couldn't even scrape together enough rice and vegetables for the basket, barely managing to bring some necessities.

Zeng Juan didn't know whether to laugh or cry, because the newspaper and registration site had long announced: this public exam was divided into a written test and an interview. Only those who passed the written test would enter the interview. The written test lasted only one day, and lunch was uniformly prepared by the government, so there was no need to prepare so many items.

After much persuasion, he finally convinced his mother to forego the heavy exam baskets. He only wrapped the necessary exam items in a bundle. Zeng Juan said: "I see Australian cadres and soldiers all have a canvas shoulder bag that can carry things and is convenient to carry. Pity there's nowhere to buy one."

Just as they were speaking, Zhang Yu arrived with a shop assistant carrying a food box. Knowing today was Zeng Juan's public exam day, he had specially packed some dim sum from his shop to bring over.

"A-Juan, I wish you victory at the first unfurling of the banner, instant success!" Zhang Yu said.

The hands of the two friends gripped tightly. Zeng Juan felt an indescribable warmth in his heart. For the past half-year, it was Zhang Yu who had paved bridges and roads for his public exam career, spending money and effort entirely out of friendship without expecting return. To have such a friend, what more could a man ask for? He nodded emotionally.

"Ziyu hasn't returned from Lingao yet. If he were in Guangzhou, he would also have come to send you off!" Zhang Yu said. Then he spoke some encouraging words to Yuan Shuzhi. Finally, even Mingnu came out to say a few auspicious phrases, wishing Uncle and "Grandpa" to "soar to the sky in one flight" and "amaze the world with a single cry." This moved Yuan Shuzhi to tears—he was a man with no kin, having never enjoyed the joy of family bonds. Now receiving a caring auspicious wish from this little girl, his heart was extraordinarily agitated. He said to Mingnu: "Good girl, Grandpa will definitely fly to the sky!" Everyone laughed at this.

Bidding farewell to friends and family, Zeng Juan and Yuan Shuzhi embarked on the journey of the public exam.

The civil service examination location was set at the former Great Ming Guangdong Tribute Courtyard (Gongyuan). Because there were many positions this time, the number of applicants had surged. Over 2,000 admission tickets alone had been issued. Guangzhou didn't have a school large enough to serve as an exam hall. The retained former Guangzhou Prefectural Vice-Magistrate, now General Office Counselor Wei Bifu, suggested using the original Guangdong Tribute Courtyard. This Tribute Courtyard located on Dashi Street had 5,000 exam cells, enough to accommodate all candidates.

Even for Senators from the 21st century, this Tribute Courtyard was an architectural marvel. Continuous buildings, magnificent in scale. All Senators who came to Guangzhou, including Liu Xiang, inevitably visited this place.

At this moment, the chief examiner of this civil service exam, Zhang Yunmi, was standing on the Mingyuan Tower, gazing at the endless stretch of black roof tiles. This building was the commanding height for invigilators to monitor the entire venue. For this public exam, it also served as the invigilation office.

Because this was the first large-scale unified exam organized by the Senate, all parties took it seriously. Liu Xiang had originally wanted to send the National Army to maintain order around the perimeter and serve as chief examiner himself. It was Lin Baiguang who advised against making it too grand.

"Although the civil service exam evolved from the imperial examination, we aren't doing the imperial examination system after all. It's best not to leave such an impression on the citizens. Just send more police to maintain order. As for the examiner, the current principal of the Guangzhou Cadre School, Zhang Yunmi, is the most suitable candidate."

Seeing Liu Xiang still seemed reluctant, he whispered: "These candidates have heavily traditional mindsets. If they pass, they will mostly view the presiding Senator as their 'Seat Master' (Patron/Teacher). A little girl like Zhang Yunmi doesn't matter, but if it were another Senator..."

These words startled Liu Xiang into a cold sweat, cursing himself for forgetting this detail! So he appointed Zhang Yunmi as chief examiner.

Zhang Yunmi was no longer flustered by her various temporary positions—she was beginning to adapt to her role.

"This place is really big!" Zhang Yunmi praised, standing on the Mingyuan Tower.

The Mingyuan Tower wasn't actually tall. But in 17th-century Guangzhou, which had almost no multi-story buildings, a two-story building was a commanding height, sufficient to overlook the entire Tribute Courtyard.

The Tribute Courtyard faced south, its main structures forming a symmetrical rectangular layout. Surrounded by high walls with watchtowers at the four corners, it looked like a small city.

The central axis ran from south to north: Main Gate, Yi Gate, Dragon Gate, Mingyuan Tower, "Heaven Opens Literary Fortune" Archway, Zhigong Hall, Jieshen Hall, Jukui Hall, and the Rear Gate.

The central axis of the Tribute Courtyard was a stone-paved road, flanked by towering ancient trees. The stone slabs were mostly broken and overgrown with weeds. Even after the recent rush cleaning, weeds could still be seen everywhere in the cracks—under Ming rule, this Tribute Courtyard was used only once every three years. Being vast in area, maintenance wasn't easy, giving it a somewhat desolate and dilapidated feel.

Flanking the stone road were dense rows of exam cells. Dozens of cells formed a row, with the entrance wall of each row marked with a Chinese character from the "Thousand Character Classic": "Heaven Earth Black Yellow, Universe Vast Wilderness..." "Heaven" was on the east, "Earth" on the west; "Black" on the east, "Yellow" on the west, and so on until the cells were exhausted. The Mingyuan Tower stood in the exact center of the Tribute Courtyard, serving to monitor the whole venue.

Curious, Zhang Yunmi had gone into the lanes to look. The cells were low and narrow—only 3 *chi* wide, 4 *chi* deep, and 6 *chi* high. Inside, one couldn't stand straight or lie down. One could only sit upright. Inside, there were two brick ledges on the walls for placing wooden boards called "cell boards." One for sitting/sleeping, one serving as a desk. Candidates burned candles and wrote essays inside. During the autumn provincial exams, the weather was still hot. Thousands of people squeezed into these tiny shacks with no ventilation—sweltering, sweating, smoked by candles, bitten by bugs, racking their brains to piece together essays. The hardship of writing inside could be imagined.

What Zhang Yunmi found most unbearable was that each row of cells had a few rooms designated as "stink cells," containing excrement vats serving as toilets. Candidates relieved themselves right there. The cells were narrow and poorly ventilated, so the stench was overwhelming. Although it had been a long time since the last exam when she visited, passing by the stink cells she could still smell the stench of urine and feces. For this reason, she specially submitted a report applying to build several large latrines in the Tribute Courtyard for candidates to use. If environmental hygiene wasn't handled well, an outbreak of infectious disease would be disastrous.

"Report to Chief, it is exactly 8 o'clock. Shall we let the candidates in?"

"Open the barrier gates, let the candidates in." Zhang Yunmi nodded in agreement.

The new rule was to open the exam hall gates at 8 AM, start the exam formally at 9 AM, and end at 12 PM. The second session would start at 2 PM and end at 5 PM.

Zeng Juan and Yuan Shuzhi waited outside the Main Gate. A dark mass of candidates had already gathered outside. Because of the large numbers, police had blocked the surrounding roads, allowing only those with admission tickets to enter. Everyone craned their necks, eager to see what this first "Australian Imperial Exam" would look like.

Yuan Shuzhi had never entered the Tribute Courtyard, but he had heard people say that for the provincial exam, entry was signaled by cannon fire: three shots to open the Main Gate, three more for the Yi Gate, and finally three for the Dragon Gate—only when the Dragon Gate opened did one formally enter the venue. At that moment, he suddenly heard a cannon shot from the Zhenhai Tower, followed by bells and drums chiming in unison from all over the city, striking eight times. He knew it was now the Australian "eight o'clock," or the middle of the *Chen* hour.
