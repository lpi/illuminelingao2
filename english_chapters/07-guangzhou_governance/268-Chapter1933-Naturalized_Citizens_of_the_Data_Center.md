# Chapter 1933 - Naturalized Citizens of the Data Center

The Secretary of State and the Minister of Planning hoped to reduce current machine time consumption in this way, cultivating statistical analysis capabilities that did not rely on computers, so as to maintain a certain ability to manage government affairs through data in the future when there were no computers. On this basis, the Planning Agency planned to merge some relevant departments and further expand on the existing foundation, uniformly using the signboard of "National Data and Computing Center" externally.

According to this policy, the calculation and data processing departments of various ministries were uniformly brought under the Data and Computing Center, implementing vertical management. The calculation and data departments of various ministries were treated as dispatched agencies. At the same time, a comprehensive cleanup of equipment and personnel in various departments was carried out, and equipment that was not used efficiently or improperly was confiscated. The related operators were uniformly subjected to "rotational training in batches" by the Calculation and Data Center.

As a result, the scale of Xu Laowu's team expanded significantly. The collected equipment was all handed over to Feng Nuo and his team for maintenance and refurbishment, while the operators were all concentrated for rectification training—Xu Laowu was rather dissatisfied with the operators he received. Because these people worked in scattered locations and had not undergone holistic training, a considerable number of them had bad usage habits. There were also quite a few "relationship hires" among them, who had entered the agencies as operators through various connections. Inevitably, they had some airs of "I have connections," especially those who came in through the path of Senators' Living Secretaries. Xu Laowu decided to give them a harsh lesson first, a show of strength. He specially found a few ruthless aunties from the Quarantine Camp to give them "outward bound training."

"Let you know the power of the Data and Computing Center!" Xu Laowu thought to himself.

He looked at the huge quartz clock on the wall—this quartz clock was a three-in-one creation using a movement brought from the old timeline, a battery homemade by Dr. Zhong, and a casing made by a naturalized craftsman.

The Data and Computing Center had relatively high requirements for timekeeping, so it was entirely equipped with quartz clocks brought from the old timeline.

The clock already pointed to five thirty. The staff on the middle shift began organizing the work at hand to prepare for the shift change. Because the center did not have high-intensity tasks like the census recently, today's work was actually drawing to a close. According to the center's regulations, the deadline for declaring data for the day was 18:00. Generally, by this time, various departments would no longer come to submit documents. The frequency of folder movement also dropped significantly. The reception counter at the front end had already begun filling out the daily work log for archiving. The reporting groups in the central area also had people tidying up their desktops getting ready to get off work; even the backend data entry group, which was still in a high-load working state, was conducting the handover between the middle and evening shifts. Occasionally, girls getting off work could be seen leaving the work area to change clothes in the staff rest area at the back.

The working environment of the Calculation and Data Center was probably the best among all the Senate institutions in Lingao. The rest area was divided into several rooms of different sizes. Apart from coat lockers lined up against the wall and independent changing rooms, each room was also set up with two rows of long tables and corresponding benches. At the end of the tables were self-service drink tables, stocked with drinks and small snacks. On the table were three insulated buckets containing hot water, black tea, and coffee respectively. Unlike the practice of some powerful departments providing large amounts of so-called "Energy Potions," Senator Xu insisted on not letting such kill-the-goose-that-lays-the-golden-egg things enter the venue, advocating instead for the use of reasonable scheduling and management systems for constraint.

There were quite a few girls sitting on the benches by the tables. Some were organizing personal items, some were taking time to run up for a drink of water and a rest, and some gathered together discussing various topics of interest to girls. Seeing the Senator enter, they stood up in unison and immediately dispersed. Since it was close to finishing time, Senator Xu simply nodded repeatedly, signaled for them to sit down, and walked past. Due to the nature of the work, the reception and data entry groups of the Data Center were the domain of girls, and for a long time, Senator Xu was the object of envy, jealousy, and hate from various otaku "soy sauce" Senators. But heaven knows, for quite a long period, this place was basically the domain of all kinds of "dinosaurs." Senator Xu felt he was beginning to understand Hong Changqing; facing such a level of appearance, having no thoughts was only normal.

However, this had begun to change recently. With the completion of the new office building, the office conditions and benefits of the Data Center gained some fame, especially attracting graduates from the College of Arts and Sciences. After all, the office location was within Bairen City where Senators clustered, the working environment was good, the pay was decent, and one could learn some real skills. Senator Xu found that this had become a typical white-collar job of this timeline. Especially after the abolition of the Maid School, many trainees transferred here to work. Correspondingly, the appearance level of the staff rose rapidly, and the students from the College of Arts and Sciences also led the fashion trends of this timeline. Even the girls who originally worked here began to pay attention to clothing, cosmetics, makeup, and so on. As the saying goes, "there are no ugly women, only lazy women." The former dinosaurs had also undergone significant changes recently. Correspondingly, the number of times various Senators came to inspect and coordinate work recently had increased exponentially. Xu Laowu had to issue an announcement: "No visits or inspections allowed without business contact."

Seeing that everything around was normal, Senator Xu prepared to go downstairs to inspect the server room, this precious darling of the Senate. But as he turned around, through the window by the stairs, he saw several "Golden Star Zero" vehicles parked in the parking lot outside the lawn. Although access control to Bairen City had been relaxed with the gradual activation of the new administrative center in the original county seat, it wasn't open to just any Tom, Dick, or Harry. Needless to say, behind every vehicle was a certain Senator, and every vehicle was waiting for a certain girl or girls in the building.

"Damn it, it's become a mistress concentration camp," Senator Xu shook his head, trying to dispel a slightly sour feeling in his heart, and walked down the stairs.

He changed into the smock, shoes, and hat worn by operators in the dedicated changing room, washed his hands, and then entered the dedicated corridor. Pushing open the thick soundproof door wrapped in kapok at the end of the corridor, he entered the highest confidentiality area of the Planning Agency Data Center—the Entry Center and the Server Room. A chill hit him in the face, instantly giving Senator Xu the feeling of walking into a refrigerator. In fact, calling it a refrigerator wasn't wrong. The original design here was similar to the mobile coal gas cold storage that performed outstandingly in the Pearl River Delta Invasion. The outer walls surrounding the room contained thermal insulation layers filled with multiple layers of diatomaceous earth and kapok, and even the door was a composite door sandwiched with insulation. Apart from the cooling itself mainly adopting a ground-source heat pump, and the installation of ventilation fans, it was pretty much the same as a cold storage.

Extremely strict temperature and humidity controls were implemented here, no less inferior to Feng Nuo's computer room. Thermohygrometers brought from another timeline strictly monitored the indoor temperature and humidity, ensuring the equipment ran under optimal conditions. Dedicated personnel would inspect the thermohygrometers everywhere every fifteen minutes. Once the needle exceeded the corresponding zone, measures would be taken immediately to adjust it.

The reason for adopting such a design, which seemed somewhat insane to Senator Xu, was a big discussion among the code monkeys on the BBS in the early years of the traversal. To the various industrial party members in the Senate, the code monkeys seemed to have the least promising future. Even if the ultimate first-generation traversers spent their entire lives, no one expected to be able to produce electronic products at the level of the twenty-first century. Although some put forward proposals thinking that a simple 8-bit machine could be developed in the future, Senator Xu estimated that being able to create a Lingao version of ENIAC would already be thanking the heavens. Thus, how to maintain the usage efficiency and lifespan of precision electronic products represented by computers as much as possible became a big problem for the code monkeys who were still willing to stay in their profession, and for the Planning Agency which had a special preference for digital management based on computer databases.

In order to ensure that the equipment could extend its life as much as possible, after material conditions permitted, the new building of the Data Center fully considered this during design. Although the current Senate could not yet make complete anti-static flooring, a copper mesh laid on an iron frame was indeed installed under the floor of the machine room, with wires directly grounded. To ensure safety, the machine room itself had no windows, relying entirely on electric lighting and mechanical ventilation. To achieve temperature and humidity control efficiently and with low energy consumption while reducing costs, the designers basically copied the design concept and material technology of the coal gas cold storage, finally forming the appearance seen now: more than a dozen computers were lined up on both sides of the room, with a relatively wide passage in the middle. The tables needing input were passed in from a small door at one end, and directly sent out from a small door at the other end after completion. The girls responsible for input wore half-cotton padded uniforms similar to the Shandong Detachment uniforms, inputting data into screens whose principles they completely could not understand.

Although after discovering the Fox Immortal legend, Senator Xu had requested to replace the FoxPro fox pattern with the Star Fist National Emblem, it was unclear whether they still worshipped it or not. After all, Senator Xu was not perverted enough to check the girls' chests every day. However, to some extent, these girls should indeed thank the divine artifacts in front of them. Thanks to the scarcity of their skills, their job grades all reached the "Technician" level assessed by the Senate, and a few leading team leaders were even assessed as "Associate Engineers." Coupled with the work meals and employee dormitories originally provided by the Data Center, these girls definitely lived very well in Lingao. Since most of them came from the initial intake of refugees, and some were taken in without even fathers or brothers, their monthly salary suddenly appeared quite substantial. These girls had high incomes and widened horizons, so they inevitably became picky about men. As a result, in Lingao where the gender ratio was so disparate, there actually appeared a phenomenon of "leftover women." The shift leader walking towards Senator Xu was one of them.
