# Chapter 2043 - Three Rules of Agreement

"...So, Song Yingsheng has agreed to surrender?" Wen Desi asked with some surprise as he looked at Du Yibin, who had come in beaming to discuss the "Song Yingsheng" matter.

"Sort of, but not completely," Du Yibin, who had come specially to report, said. "He only said he's willing to 'serve' me personally—but he has three rules."

"Let's hear them."

"First, he will not accept any title or reward from the Council of Elders."

"Free labor, might as well take it. Agreed."

"Second, the Council of Elders cannot use his name for appeals."

"Okay. Is he very famous?"

"Sort of. The Two Songs of Fengxin..." Liu Xiang added.

"Oh, that doesn't matter much."

"His family still has some influence in Jiangxi," Cui Hantang interjected. "His great-grandfather was a Prime Minister."

"So a prominent local family—but it doesn't matter much."

"Third, he will not do anything detrimental to the Great Ming."

Wen Desi didn't speak, but several other Elders were about to explode: This was practically a humiliating surrender treaty!

Du Yibin quickly added: "But he also said, as long as it benefits the common people and the locality, he will do it."

Wen Desi thought for a moment and said: "Agree to his terms. Since that's the case, he'll count as your personal aide—I'll approve this as a special case."

"Thank you, Chief Wen!"

"But since he's unwilling to surrender, we can't pay him a salary..."

"I'll cover all his expenses."

"Alright then." Wen Desi nodded. "Write up an application for this, get the Region to sign off, and report it for the record."

Watching Du Yibin's back, Liu Xiang grumbled: "Little Du put so much effort into this... I don't think he was this attentive even when chasing his girlfriend."

"Just short of kneeling and licking."

"Sigh, don't be so harsh, okay? We're all comrades," Liu Xiang said. "Didn't he expend all this effort for the Council of Elders?"

"Exactly!" Cui Hantang, full of food and drink, patted his belly. "Song Yingsheng is at least a scientist of our Great Han! Better than a bunch of people rushing to kneel and lick foreigners like Newton and Descartes..."

"Since when is Song Yingsheng a scientist? It's his brother, okay!"

"Song Yingxing is at most a popular science writer, what kind of scientist is he? Did he discover any laws?"

"Speaking of which, it's really pathetic. 17th-century European science is already full of stars, yet here we treat Song Yingxing and Xu Xiake like treasures!"

"Bullshit! When our Great Han ruled East Asia, Europeans were still savages wearing furs in the woods."

"That's all the Manchus' fault!"

Seeing the Elders about to quarrel, Wen Desi frowned. Liu Xiang quickly said: "Let's not talk nonsense about another world. Mind the optics!"

"Little Du is sincere, but that old fellow Song Yingsheng—he committed suicide for the Ming in history. Du Yibin's tossing about better not end up fetching water with a bamboo basket," Wang Jun quickly pulled the topic back.

Wen Desi nodded: "Ninety miles is only half of a hundred-mile journey. Little Du wants to use this wedding to make Song Yingsheng completely surrender. It's really tough for these celebrity chasers." He stretched, and his life secretary immediately served him a cup of black tea.

Wang Jun said: "The celebrities Du Yibin has his eye on are at least technical types: Song Yingxing, Wu Youxing, Fu Qingshu, Bi Maokang—technical celebrities like these can still use their strengths under our Council of Elders' rule, maybe even unleashing potential they couldn't in the Ming era. But some 'celebrities' the Council of Elders delights in trying to recruit—I think they're all reactionaries..."

This remark practically named Cui Hantang. Wen Desi smiled slightly. Such debates were clichéd within the Council of Elders, dating back to the "Moli Xuan Work" days.

"Can't say that entirely: these celebrities of the old era have some influence. If we can win them over for our use, it's not without benefit to our rule," Liu Xiang said. "We could set up a United*Front/Department..."

"No, the Council of Elders doesn't have so many people to do this full-time, and most comrades are very wary of 'United**Front'—can't blame them, there are too many precedents," Wen Desi smiled. "So this work can only be done semi-officially, not as a specialized agency. I think Daoist Cui and Little Du's approach is fine—anyway, it's their personal behavior. If there are changes later, they can't say we broke our word."

Just then, Zhang Yunmi returned from the stage. She had removed her makeup, changed clothes, and was wiping sweat with a towel.

"You were dazzling on stage just now!" Liu Xiang rose to greet her. "No wonder you're the pillar of the Plaid Skirts!"

"Sorry, haven't danced in a long time, a bit rusty."

"Not at all, not at all, your participation is already commendable." Wen Desi laughed. "Come! Let's toast Little Zhang! Congratulating her and the Plaid Skirt Club for firing the first shot for the Council of Elders on the new cultural front!"

The Elders responded enthusiastically. Only Cui Hantang was unhappy, but he raised his glass too.

Gao Ju thought: This Australian woman truly isn't shy at all—not only not shy, but drinking openly with everyone! Even the most unrestrained famous courtesans he hadn't seen behave like this.

The Australians don't hurry to conquer the world, just doing this stuff every day. Gao Ju suddenly felt great concern for the Council of Elders' future.

"Young Master Zhang, look at this Australian song and dance, this old brother really can't understand it..." Gao Ju whispered to Zhang Yu. "You're young and close to the Elders, do you know the secret within?"

Zhang Yu actually didn't understand either. But he read many Australian magazines and knew a bit about the term "new culture." In his dealings with Elders, he had heard some idle chatter. He vaguely understood the Australians' intentions. But he dared not openly state his thoughts. "Presumptuously guessing Heaven's will" was a great crime.

He thought briefly and said: "Master Gao, in my humble opinion, the Council of Elders' governance has always been commanding and far-sighted. Far above us. Things that seem strange or even absurd to us, we only realize afterwards how correct their decisions were. If we don't understand the reason, just follow along!"

Gao Ju was shaken, thinking: This Young Master Zhang is young, but his view is quite reasonable! Why should I probe into the Australians' every word and deed? Just follow and support! After all, since the Australians came to his backyard, as long as he acted according to their requirements, everything went smoothly, never suffering a loss!

"Young brother speaks reasonably!" Gao Ju said while raising his glass to Zhang Yu. The two drank together. But Gao Ju was calculating: Does my family have a suitable girl?

While the collective wedding was being celebrated with great jubilation at Great World, and Wang Qiyi was still up late anxiously clearing the Tianrui Garden account books, whispers could be heard from the side room of an ordinary small courtyard near Guangzhou's South City Gate. If one were close, one would discover the windows had been carefully sealed with cloth, evidently to prevent light from leaking out.

"Second Brother, this time it was my negligence, trusting that hair-thief. What 'according to law,' it's all deception."

"Oh? Then tell me how this hair-thief deceives people?" The middle-aged man called "Second Brother" lightly waved a folding fan, stroking his beard while looking at the person across the table with a faint smile. Sitting opposite was none other than Advisor Liao from Luo Family's Guiren Ju.

"The so-called 'according to law'—the hair-thieves shout it loudly, but in my view, it's just that the necessary tribute wasn't paid. The Luo family must have offended Zhang's running dog somewhere and got targeted..."

"If that were truly the case, could a fine of just over a hundred taels of silver let it slide so easily?"

"Second Brother, the hair-thieves haven't established a firm footing in Guangzhou yet. You know the wealthy families in the city often have cross-shareholdings and are interconnected. Though the Luo family isn't big, pulling one hair moves the whole body. The hair-thieves naturally have to weigh things. Over a hundred taels isn't much; it seems the hair-thief officials still want to leave some leeway for future interaction. I know to be more 'flexible' in the future..."

"Confused!" The middle-aged man called "Second Brother" snapped his fan shut and pointed at Advisor Liao's nose. "The hair-thieves' laws are all published in the newspapers, and posted outside the government office and Salt Tax Bureau. You fool didn't even look, and still talk about tribute here!"

Advisor Liao looked shocked. His sworn brother had always taken good care of him, rarely losing his temper over the past decade. Today he was complaining about the hair-thieves, whom everyone hated, yet his sworn brother not only scolded him as confused but spoke up for the hair-thieves?

"Second Brother is right to scold." Advisor Liao, though unconvinced, could only acquiesce. Without his sworn brother's promotion, he would probably still be a lowly unranked accountant in the Liang mansion. "Tomorrow I'll send someone to copy a set to read carefully."

"No need." The middle-aged man took a booklet from his sleeve and handed it to Advisor Liao. "Take this and read it."

Advisor Liao took the booklet with both hands. On it was written in simplified characters: *1636 Astralian Song Tax Policy Compilation*. Opening it under the light of the Australian candle on the table, he saw tax laws followed by explanations, listed item by item, clear and straightforward. Except for the hair-thieves' left-to-right horizontal text being hard to read, it was truly a good book. recalling the clerks' secretive attitude towards the Fish Scale Ledgers in the past, the Liang family must have spent considerable effort to obtain this booklet. Giving it to him now clearly meant he was to be given heavy responsibility.

Thinking of this, Advisor Liao beamed with joy: "Many thanks, Second Brother. I will study this precious book thoroughly and do the job..."

"Precious book?" The middle-aged man saw Advisor Liao's expression and knew he was overthinking it, laughing despite himself. "Third Brother, you're literate too. I won't lie to you—this booklet costs just one mace of silver at the street book market." Seeing Advisor Liao's eyelids droop, the middle-aged man quickly returned to the main topic. "Third Brother, do you know about the Lin family's matter?"
