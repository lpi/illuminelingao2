# Chapter 1757 - The Nephew

Was his future to be just like his father's—sitting by the stove day after day, dipping candle wicks? He had studied, and he had read many of the Australians' "magazines"; his horizons were far broader than most. Yet that very breadth of vision only deepened his dread: nothing is more agonizing than to awaken from a dream with nowhere to go. And that was precisely the torment in which he now found himself mired.

After eating the congee his mother had saved for him, Zeng Juan was about to review the books he had neglected these past days. The Four Books and Five Classics were the foundation of any scholar's education; one had to be able to recite them backward and forward. He had just picked up a volume when his mother came over.

"A-Juan, go to your brother-in-law's place and look in on Mingnu, Chengzi, and Huazi."

These were his sister's three surviving children. The fourth had been stillborn when she died in childbirth.

Ever since his sister's death, no one had been looking after the three children properly. Zeng Juan's parents, full of pity for their grandchildren, sent him every ten days or so to check on them and bring a few things.

Zeng Juan was not especially eager to go. Since his brother-in-law had remarried, every visit meant enduring the new wife's cold looks and snide remarks. But his mother insisted.

"Go. If you don't, that woman will think we've washed our hands of them. What chance would your nephew and nieces have then?"

"But Brother-in-Law is still there..."

"What do you know? Where there's a stepmother, there's a step-father." His mother had prepared a bundle of summer clothes for the children. "Take these. And put on a bit of an uncle's authority."

Zeng Juan had no choice but to comply. He knew his mother was right: without the maternal family standing behind them, the three children would suffer terribly. And he was fond of his nephew and nieces.

He left with the bundle and headed down the street. In fact, his sister's husband's place was only two streets away—just a few alley turns and he'd be there.

He arrived at the tea-house door. Business was good; customers filled the tables. It was a modest little establishment, typical of the neighborhood—a tiny two-story building with no more than a dozen tables between both floors. There had once been an awning out front with four or five more tables, which also sold seasonal treats like mooncakes in their time; now it had been dismantled completely. Ever since the illegal-structure demolitions on Chengxuan Street, everyone knew the Australians meant business—a few coins slipped to the runners no longer sufficed. Most people hadn't waited for official notice before tearing things down themselves. A few who thought their "backers" were powerful enough had had their structures razed by the government and been hauled off to the yamen for a flogging and fines—while their so-called "backers" hadn't so much as uttered a peep.

Zeng Juan's brother-in-law's "backer" was a runner in the Panyu County Quick Class, related by some vague familial tie. For a tea-house or eatery, without someone from official circles to stand behind you, you simply couldn't stay open.

That "backer" had been "retained," but even he no longer dared to stick his neck out and take on odd jobs. So Zeng Juan's brother-in-law had prudently dismantled the awning himself.

Brother-in-law was at the counter doing accounts. Seeing Zeng Juan approach, his face soured. "A-Juan, what are you doing here?"

"It's getting hot. My mother wanted me to bring some clothes for the children." Zeng Juan said, "Are Mingnu, Chengzi, and Huazi well?"

"Fine, fine, fine." Brother-in-law took the bundle with an expression of distaste and tossed it carelessly behind the counter. "No sickness, no injury—that's 'well.' Is there something else?"

Ever since his sister's death, his brother-in-law's attitude had grown colder by the day. Had it been up to Zeng Juan's temper, he'd have turned and left on the spot. But his mother's admonition still rang in his ears. "I'd like to see the children."

That kicked the hornet's nest. Brother-in-law's face darkened and he sneered, "Your family's meddling a bit too much, isn't it? They're descendants of the Cao family—what do they have to do with the Zengs? I'm their father, after all! Why must you and your mother poke your noses in every few days? If you ask me, you'd do better to study hard, pass the *xiucai* exam, and save your father from boiling stinking tallow—that would be proper!"

Zeng Juan swallowed his anger. "Brother-in-Law, that's no way to talk. Though my sister is gone, they're still my parents' grandchildren. Bone broken, the marrow still connects. Our family may not have much money, but we have to do what we can to ease our conscience..."

"Bullshit!" Brother-in-law sneered again. "When your sister died, why didn't your parents take Mingnu home to raise? Even if girls are a bother, they could have taken one of the boys—that would've saved me trouble! Now that I've remarried, you come around every few days with a few rags—do you think I'm short of tattered clothes? If your parents can't afford to help, they should mind their own damn business."

Zeng Juan was furious at this contemptuous treatment of his parents. He was about to retort when the new wife emerged from the back kitchen, carrying a bucket of dirty water. Seeing Zeng Juan, her face fell. He called out "Sister," but she ignored him, strode past, and hurled the slop-water into the street—nearly splashing his face. Zeng Juan knew "Sister" disliked him—despised him, really—but he had no choice but to keep appearing, to assert his presence.

"Husband, we're almost out of firewood—don't forget to buy more. And don't forget to collect those tea-bowls over there." The woman addressed her husband without so much as a glance at Zeng Juan. "There's so much work in the shop, and here you are chattering with some good-for-nothing moocher! I'm going to cook—those three worthless brats are waiting to be fed!"

Brother-in-law could only wear a fawning smile. "All right, all right, I'll go now." He waited until she had disappeared behind the kitchen curtain before turning back with a cold look. "You'd better be going. I won't see you out."

Having been given the boot, Zeng Juan had no choice but to leave. Since his sister's death, her husband seemed like a different person; he'd always been so cheerful before. Even the new wife—his mother had mentioned—hadn't been a sharp-tongued shrew in her own family. Who'd have thought she'd turn out like this the moment she married in!

He returned to the street, still uneasy, but since Brother-in-law wouldn't let him into the rear quarters, there was nothing he could do. He had just started back when he suddenly spotted Mingnu limping along with a large bowl in her hands. Inside was a lump of fermented bean curd. Zeng Juan hurried over and called out, "Mingnu!"

At the sight of him, Mingnu's tears began to fall before she even opened her mouth. Zeng Juan quickly led her aside, set down the bowl, and wiped her tears with his sleeve. "Why are you limping?"

At the question, Mingnu's lips quivered as if she were about to wail. Zeng Juan hastily covered her mouth. "Don't cry, don't cry. Tell me slowly."

Through her sobs, Mingnu explained that the night before, she had broken a teacup while washing dishes, and "Mother" had punished her by making her kneel. She had knelt the whole night until she collapsed on the floor. Even now her knees were swollen; she could barely walk...

Mingnu was only ten, and being male, Zeng Juan naturally couldn't inspect her injuries himself. But seeing how labored her steps were, he knew she wasn't lying.

"What about your father? Didn't he try to intervene?"

"Father did tell Mother to cool off, said a teacup wasn't worth much. But Mother flew into a rage, saying she must have sinned through eight generations to end up running this household." Mingnu wept as she spoke. "Working herself to the bone in the shop for a pittance, and on top of that having to look after our food and clothes..." She shrank into herself. "She screamed like a madwoman. Father didn't dare say another word."

Zeng Juan's heart ached. He crouched down and gently rubbed her knees. Mingnu bared her teeth—it clearly hurt badly. His eyes stung; he nearly wept himself. Then he asked, "And Chengzi and Huazi? Are they all right?"

"They don't even dare to speak at home now. They're terrified of making Mother angry."

Zeng Juan noticed that Mingnu's clothes were still tidy, just a bit grubby; her hair hadn't been properly combed. He asked, "Are you getting enough to eat?"

Mingnu nodded. "There's food, just nothing good. Huazi asked for fish and got slapped across the face. Mother says Father's tea-house doesn't make any money, can't even cover daily expenses..." Suddenly she burst into tears again and threw her arms around his waist. "Uncle! Please, please ask Grandmother to take me home! I heard Mother and Father talking—business is bad, they're short on cash—they want to sell me to a big household as a maid-servant..."

Zeng Juan trembled with rage. Stepmothers abusing their predecessors' children was the way of the world. As long as no one died, no one thought much of it. No matter how indignant or sympathetic he felt, he could only swallow it. But to sell his niece into domestic bondage—that was beyond the pale. He couldn't believe his brother-in-law's family was truly so desperate. This woman was trying to purge his sister's children entirely!

His sister's flesh and blood, all that remained of her in this world—he couldn't let them be ruined.

He wanted to storm back immediately and demand whether his brother-in-law had any conscience left, to curse him until his ears rang, and to give that woman a few resounding slaps. But then he thought: he wasn't even a licentiate—not even a *tongsheng*—and his brother-in-law and the wife simply wouldn't take him seriously. When a woman went wild, several men together might not be a match for her. Was he really going to brawl with that woman in the street and make a disgraceful scene?

Even if they meekly submitted to his scolding, what then? Zeng Juan knew that after such an uproar, the "dog couple" would never mend their ways—on the contrary, there'd be hell to pay. His own family had no means to support his nephew and nieces, so in the end the children would suffer even more.

A vast frustration churned in his chest, yet all his anger was futile. In this matter, he was utterly powerless. He could only comfort her: "Don't be afraid. Uncle will go home and think of something. I won't let you become a maid-servant." He rummaged in his sleeve for a long while, then could only sigh helplessly.

On the way back, Zeng Juan kept turning the problem over in his mind—how could he stop this? His family had no money, no powerful "threshold" to lean on for backing—and even if they had, no one dared stick their neck out these days. Lost in these chaotic thoughts, he suddenly heard someone hawking:

"Fresh Australian paper! Come and have a look..."

He stopped in his tracks. *How could I have forgotten?* It was the Australians' world now. Why not ask Zhang Yu—a man in favor with the Australians—for help? He'd actually met a real Australian Chief! One word from an Australian and that dog-couple would be scared witless!
