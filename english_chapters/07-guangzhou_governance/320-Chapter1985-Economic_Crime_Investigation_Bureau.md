# Chapter 1985 - Economic Crime Investigation Bureau

"Our collection work started less than two quarters, losses are not big yet, so we must kill this kind of thing in the cradle, absolutely cannot appease evil." Ai Zhixin slapped the table loudly. "Let these people see if the Senate's Finance and Tax Bureau has good teeth, see if they still dare to play petty cleverness. You go investigate freely. Remember, don't fear implication, don't fear offending people. I believe in your ability!"

"Serve the Senate and the People!" The four naturalized citizen cadres present stood up in unison.

"Good, then I announce the establishment of Guangzhou Finance and Tax Bureau Case 712 Luo Family Stamp Tax Special Task Force. Director Wang Qiyi as leader. Municipal Direct Management Division Zeng Juan as Team 1 Leader, extracting Municipal Tax Statistics Division Xu Zhewei, Municipal Tax Assessment Division Chu Xiaoran as members, responsible for account book review; Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau Economic Investigation Division Investigator Yao Yulan as Team 2 Leader, with Municipal Economic Crime Investigation Division Investigator Huang Ping as member, responsible for investigation execution. I hope you unite and cooperate, exert strengths to complete this task perfectly, giving the Senate and people a satisfactory answer."

"After dismissal, personnel not present will be notified separately by Municipal Bureau Office. Task Force works centrally in Room 114," Wang Qiyi added.

Economic Crime Investigation Division? Zeng Juan's eyelid twitched. What unit is this? Why have I never heard of it.

As early as the "Grain Collection Bureau" period in Lingao, Ai Zhixin and the gang of Wudaokou Senators had ambitions to build a departmental armed force similar to Song Dynasty Imperial relative's Tax Police Regiment. Of course, not only them; Senators with a title big or small all calculated pulling teams for their own departments: Health Enforcement Brigade, Industry and Commerce Enforcement Corps, Communication Security Corps, Agriculatural Reclamation Armored Division... etc., varied and many. The whole Senate set off a wave of building departmental armed forces. For a time Senators argued openly and connected secretly. The Great Library retrieved and printed various pamphlets at Senators' request to prove the "necessity," "rationality," and "conformity to international practice" of these institutions.

Of course, these ideas were all shot down by the consistently correct Executive Committee. Up to now, the only one succeeding was Health, obtaining a department with "business guidance right" within the police system: Health Police.

Even so, the gentlemen of Wudaokou—including Ai Zhixin—still dreamed of establishing a violent law enforcement force completely controlled by themselves. After Finance and Tax Bureau establishment, temporarily co-located in Guangzhou, because far from Lingao, he thought it an excellent chance to make a breakthrough, so he spared no effort peddling his view to the Wang Qiyi couple. The Wang Qiyi couple didn't mix in initially. One important reason was both were older, seeking stability and safety in everything, disliking fighting and killing, let alone wanting gun barrels. In their view, at least in Finance and Tax Bureau, cost of gun-carriers was huge and output low compared to account-turning ones, truly not worthwhile. Besides, naturalized citizen cadres cultivated by themselves were gold nuggets mastering theories hundreds of years ahead in this plane; running to handle guns and knives was too pity.

Time rewinds to over three months ago. During first quarter collection preparation, Ai Zhixin took out an important material in a secret meeting in the small conference room.

This material wasn't concocted by Ai Zhixin. It was a compilation of various economic situations obtained by various departments in daily work after the Senate entered Guangzhou. Among them were those obtained in social surveys, also confessions obtained in several big cases. These materials were mostly very fragmented but enough for them to glimpse the quality of this Number One Trading Port in South China and various merchant princes inside. The couple's view on Ai Zhixin also gradually changed from "cannot be done" to "might as well try."

After secret discussion, Ai Zhixin drafted a plan, reported to Wudaokou, and internally brewed for over half a month before submitting to Administration Council via Cheng Dong. Since long ago "Wudaokou" crowd's private briefing had been quite effective. Combining collected reactions including original Executive Committee bigwigs to Soy Sauce Senators of all classes, they determined the strategy of "Advance Two Retreat One."

The so-called "Advance Two Retreat One": the retreated "One" was ceasing to insist on copying old timeline Tax Police Regiment model, abandoning or reducing violent attributes; the advanced "Two" was taking advantage of current unclear power/responsibility boundaries of departments and many vacancies in social management measures, focusing on making articles on supervision scope and law enforcement authority.

The core content of the whole application was divided into two major parts. Part one mainly expounded on principle issues like background, significance, necessity of establishing Economic Crime Investigation Division. Guangdong province just liberated; except Guangzhou and key provincial towns, Senate regime basically stayed at the level of manifesting presence. Considering severe shortage of naturalized citizen cadres and National Army security forces, it can be determined that for a considerable long time, government control power would be in a state lacking both depth and breadth. For example, even within a prefecture city like Guangzhou which the Senate "cared for" emphatically, economic management at transmigrator social level was blank. Facing massive funds needed for Guangzhou old city renovation, new city construction, social governance etc., the Senate lacked an effective economic supervision and management system. Departments were not very clear about economic affairs within their own authority either. Except Finance and Tax Bureau, other departments' economic talents were approximately zero, fundamentally unable to fully mobilize entire Guangzhou's economic power for our use. And there was a more important reason: here wasn't old timeline, without unified, centralized, powerful social security environment created by Red regime. Instead it was more like early establishment of USA. Under this circumstance, sticking to old timeline pure civilian post setting was obviously inconsistent with reality.

Finance and Tax Bureau as the only economic management organ of the Senate should shoulder responsibility of managing social economy, filling vacancy of government functions. According to three principles of overall planning, unified construction, professional division of labor, suggest Senate establish a politically reliable, flexible reacting, professionally competent composite talent team as sharp knife of social economic management, changing passive to active, enhancing people's compliance with law by thunderous means, ensuring Senate will is executed 100%, guaranteeing long-term peace and stability of society and orderly stability of economy.

Part two of article proposed Finance and Tax Bureau Trio's reference suggestions on details like organization structure, responsibility authority, personnel allocation of Economic Crime Investigation Division. Based on Cheng Dong's instruction of "Hands and feet as long as possible, influence as small as possible," first, Economic Crime Investigation Division was low-key established as Finance and Tax Bureau directly subordinate secondary unit and only set at Provincial (Municipal) level. Commanded by Finance and Tax Bureau Directors of each region.

Second, Economic Crime Investigation Division's responsibility scope was no longer limited to tax-related cases, but responsible for supervising and inspecting entire social economic order including financial market. Focus on cracking down on serious illegal behaviors affecting economic management order, financial fraud, endangering tax collection and management, manufacturing/trafficking counterfeit currency, smuggling, obstructing normal management of companies/enterprises.

In authority, can carry weapons and possess mandatory powers like summoning suspects and witnesses, arresting criminal suspects, search and tracking; to avoid loss of effective evidence and assets, Economic Crime Investigation Division can also take preservation measures like prior sealing and freezing on relevant materials and assets. Meanwhile considering indigenous people in this timeline generally have thin legal awareness, violent resistance to law happens from time to time, illegal behaviors protected by force are common, Economic Crime Investigation Division should possess appropriate self-defense capability, ensuring investigators' own safety while forming effective deterrence to lawless elements, facilitating smooth unfolding of investigation and inspection work.

In execution, besides detaining/auctioning assets according to law, Economic Crime Investigation Division can also independently prosecute criminal suspects. Above authorities adopt case-by-case approval system. Except sealing/freezing needing consent signature of County (District) level upward (including County/District level) Finance and Tax responsible comrades, others all need consent signature of Provincial (Municipal) level upward (including Provincial/Municipal level) Finance and Tax responsible comrades to be effective.

Third, seeing current generally low cultural quality of naturalized citizen military/political cadres under Senate rule, and Economic Serious Crime Investigation Bureau [sic] having no heavy violent law enforcement demand, suggest selecting physically fit professional cadres from departments like Finance and Tax Bureau Inspection Division to go to Lingao for armed law enforcement training. meanwhile considering Senator Salina's part functions in Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives served in old timeline highly overlap with Economic Crime Investigation Division, and Senator Salina herself not only possesses rich frontline law enforcement experience/ability but also considerable accounting knowledge, suggest Organization Department seek her personal opinion on serving as head of Economic Crime Investigation Division.

Behind main text of document was a page of postscript, relevant explanatory document. According to their experience, in Lingao Senate besides real power bigwigs with ghosts in hearts, there were large amount of Soy Sauce crowd who "vote against whatever I don't understand." This postscript used most "crude" language to tell them currently various economic problems like financial fraud, tax evasion in society had no department managing. Finance and Tax Bureau as counterpart department and having professionals should establish a set of management supervision system, especially strictly striking those feigning compliance or even vainly attempting to oppose Senate laws. Old timeline finance and tax departments were pure civilian because nation gave a ubiquitous safe environment. Chaos of grassroots society in this plane is known to all. If finance and tax cadres can only be pure civilians, then truly meat. So for subordinate safety, necessary self-defense measures must be had.

Wang Qiyi said: "Salina is already prepared to be candidate for General Guard Bureau Director. Unlikely to come to this new department right."

"Isn't this better." Ai Zhixin had a well-thought-out plan. "What do several bigwigs hate most? Waste. This General Guard Bureau Director essentially is a Big Guard. Lingao already has a Big Guard Wu Yayang; why add another?"
