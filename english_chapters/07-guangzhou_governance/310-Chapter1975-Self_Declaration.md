# Chapter 1975 - Self-Declaration

After months of getting along, Zeng Juan and this team leader of similar age were already calling each other brothers, which was unique in the Guangzhou Finance and Tax Bureau. Compared to "those people" from Lingao, this batch of newly recruited civil servants could obviously talk better with the retained old staff; some were even familiar before. As for "those people," everyone said they were arrogant, acting like superior beings just because they joined the dragon a few years earlier, throwing terms like "hillbilly," "backward," "remnant evil" around, keeping "Senate" on their lips every day. Actually, when the Senate first arrived in Lingao, they were just mud legs too. But Huang Ping didn't have these bad habits. Although this young brother was from Fangshaodi schools and considered a "root-red seedling-upright" "disciple of the Son of Heaven" in the Senate's naturalized citizen cadre system, he made people feel comfortable in dealings and didn't have the habit of taking pride in rudeness like some hillbilly naturalized citizen cadres.

Several times Zeng Juan heard he could even quote a few lines from the Four Books and Five Classics, and his brush calligraphy was also very beautiful. Obviously not from a poor background.

Probably a fallen young master.

While thinking, the three had arrived at the Gao Residence gate. Since a date was booked during the last visit, as soon as the three in uniforms appeared, of the two doorkeepers, one hurriedly went to report and the other welcomed the three in. Master Gao had instructed the door: whether he was home or not, as long as Australian cadres came, welcome them first, then report, to avoid slighting the Australians.

"Senators are one thing, but the cadres under them are mostly destitute people. Now climbing up the dragon and phoenix, they inevitably have the airs of a poor boy suddenly getting rich, harboring grievance against us. Be extra careful in dealing with them; don't slight them." Gao Ju had secretly instructed his stewards and advisors; this rule was set for this.

The three didn't stand on ceremony either. After showing credentials and task letters according to regulations, they went through the gate and turned to the side courtyard familiarly. It wasn't Zeng Juan's first time at the Gao Residence. He still remembered the first time entering; where had he seen such a truly wealthy household? His eyes went straight. He thought if not for this skin, let alone sitting properly waiting for tea, this "young master" of an incense shop would probably have been beaten out with sticks at the door.

Advisor Xu was waiting at the small courtyard gate, face full of smiles. After brief pleasantries, he led them to the "Reception Room." This courtyard was specifically allocated by the Gao family to deal with various Australian Song yamen. The main room was a real "Reception Room"—a square white-background black-character plaque was nailed on the lintel of the antique room, reading "Reception Room" in bold Song typeface.

The room was also refitted according to Australian style: carved long wooden screens were removed and changed to floor-to-ceiling glass windows. Various "Purple Light Pavilion" style tea tables and sofas were complete. Imitating the Australian style of receiving guests, a large screen was set behind the host and guest of honor sofas. The pattern on the screen was specially selected—Gao Ju asked master craftsmen to create the "Ten Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains, Sacred Ship Sunrise" image bought from Lingao using mother-of-pearl inlay lacquer work, truly magnificent.

The room also placed many "green plants" according to "Australian style." Cycads, originally looked upon as silly big black and coarse, now became the new favorite of the Gao family, standing on both sides of the steps under the eaves of the main room.

In Zeng Juan's view, this reception room was even better than the offices and reception rooms of Senator Directors. This rich family was indeed different; even currying favor was better than small citizens.

Advisor Xu apologized at the door, saying Master Gao and Steward Yan were out meeting guests or discussing business and couldn't get away. He would stand in for now; if they had any "instructions," just say it.

Huang Ping tirelessly reiterated the Finance and Tax Bureau's regulations on tax management home visits again: except for special requirements, financial supervisors should handle reception. Listening on the side, Zeng Juan truly felt Team Leader Huang had a good temper. They hadn't come to the Gao family just once or twice. Every time Steward Yan wasn't here, this Advisor Xu would go through this speech, wasting everyone's breath. Conversely, after listening to Team Leader Huang once, Steward Yan hadn't nagged about these things again.

Putting these aside, this Advisor Xu was quite shrewd. While this Guangzhou city was still using brushes, he was the first advisor to learn to use a dip pen to write simplified characters and Arabic numerals. Now he walked ahead, holding a Sacred Ship brand notebook in hand with a fountain pen clipped inside. If not for the long gown on his body and the bun on his head, he was no different from the cadres waiting for meetings in the Finance and Tax Bureau.

Seated and tea served, Huang Ping didn't make much small talk and went straight to the topic. There were mainly two items today: first, re-clarifying Advisor Xu's "Financial Person-in-Charge" identity; second, conducting pre-training for self-declaration work. The so-called Financial Person-in-Charge was just the "Tax Reporting Accountant" of the old timeline. But considering the general cultural quality of accountants in the new timeline and the promotion of debit-credit double-entry bookkeeping in the next step, Zhang Xiaoqi proposed a tone that made everyone nauseous: "Leaders grasp key points, leaders lean on grasping, leaders handle directly."

She felt that people who could sit in the top chair of the accounting office in these big households were top-notch in both IQ and EQ. It was much easier to make them understand how tax was calculated and collected. After all, taxation wasn't black technology; there was no unbridgeable cognitive gap. As for self-declaration, limited by the Finance and Tax Bureau's own strength and taxpayers' ability, only fifteen households were circled for the first batch after comprehensive consideration. Although Zhang Xiaoqi obtained support from Cheng Dong, Li Mei, and Si Kaide for comprehensive accounting system reform of industrial and commercial enterprises, this support stayed on paper. The Commerce and Finance Departments issued several documents clarifying the "spirit," but there were no specific measures on how to implement it.

Zhang Xiaoqi's original plan to transfer some people from the Fangshaodi Accounting Vocational Class to conduct several comprehensive centralized trainings for taxpayer households in Guangzhou was also rejected by Cheng Dong as timing being unripe.

So after final negotiation, the Finance and Tax Bureau determined the basic principle of "Grasp the large, control the medium, fix the small." Borrowing a few accountants from Delong to conduct relevant training for large taxpayers first. Currently, the first batch of fifteen households was the "Large" in "Grasp the large." The bottom line set by Zhang Xiaoqi was to establish tax-related subject ledgers separately according to double-entry bookkeeping, and if possible, try to promote debit-credit double-entry bookkeeping based on accrual basis among some taxpayers with high accounting quality.

This news of taxpayer self-declaration was no less than a thunderclap for big households. In the past, even if they had connections to the sky or even hooked up with the Palace, relying on human relations and rule-abiding filial piety to pay less or even no tax, ultimately how much to pay was said by the government. Nowadays, paying how much tax was said by oneself—this was truly a rare thing since ancient times. As news spread, many who thought they knew the ropes said this was just changing the soup but not the medicine; the Great Song new court was "being lenient" to sensible big households in a different way.

Advisor Xu wasn't such a layman. On declaration day, the woman behind the high counter with a face like peach blossoms said the four words "Tax According to Law" lightly. But whether he, Steward Yan, or even Master Gao understood tightly that behind the Australians' "According to Law" were merciless killing means. The forced demolition and digging all over streets when first entering Guangzhou, later the Witchcraft Case and clearing Guan Di Temple, and the legends of hanging gentry like dogs in batches in the countryside—all were "According to Law." Whoever didn't abide by their law would lose wealth lightly or lose life heavily. This "Self" sounded nice, but it was just to see if you were honest, if you were of one heart with the Australians. Presently, he listened seriously to Huang Ping's simple explanation, then took the account book to flip through carefully.

"Comrade Huang..." Advisor Xu spoke after a long time, "Oh, and Comrade Zeng. The entry method you mentioned, I have never seen before. Every occurrence requires two entries?"

"Yes, this is called double-entry bookkeeping," Huang Ping recalled how Zhang Xiaoqi made them students accept such a "superfluous" bookkeeping method in Lingao. "Take the tax you paid a few days ago. In the past, you took the tax slip back, recorded a running account, then recorded an expenditure, and that was it. Now you have to record a Debit here to clear the Tax Payable."

Huang Ping tapped the Tax Payable subject on the ledger, then picked up another ledger written with "Cash." "Record the same money here, under Credit, deducting the tax funds from your own money. So one Debit one Credit, Debit equals Credit..."

"That's it! Is this the Australians' Dragon Gate Ledger?" Advisor Xu seemed to discover something suddenly and slapped his thigh fiercely.

"Dragon Gate Ledger?" Huang Ping scratched his head. All his accounting knowledge came from the short two-year cram education in the Finance and Tax Class. Besides understanding simple Australian accounts, he could only understand and know that merchants now still used the "Four Pillars Balancing Method" from the Song Dynasty. Some merchants were worse, just using running accounts, and a considerable part of merchants didn't even have account books.

Zhang Xiaoqi, this half-baked expert, naturally wouldn't talk to them about the evolution of Chinese traditional accounting systems. Saying too much required submitting to the Truth Office for review, so better to directly instill "Australian Bookkeeping Method."

"Team Leader Huang, this Dragon Gate Ledger spread from Old Xi's side," Zeng Juan followed up. There were Shanxi people among their colleagues; not sure why Directors Ai and Wang joked that he was a fellow villager of Old Xi. Now everyone in the Finance and Tax Bureau knew Shanxi was nicknamed "Old Xi" by Australians, just like Shanghai County was called "Magic City." Zeng Juan's family incense shop had a small business and thin foundation, but this didn't prevent him from hearing some "business circle" news.

Seeing someone understand, Advisor Xu became more spirited to show off in front of these Australian cadres. Speaking of which, this Dragon Gate Ledger hadn't spread to Guangdong for long, and few shops used it, but it "indeed had wonderful points." Among those who could use it skillfully, Advisor Xu was confident that if not first in this city, he was definitely second.
