# Chapter 2041 - A Performance Across Time

"Do you think Yunmi will come today?" a girl suddenly asked.

Since the Plaid Skirt Club was established, Zhang Yunmi had always been the team's CENTER, occupying the central position in every song. This continued until two years ago when she left Lingao for Guangzhou. After that, Lin Aili took her place.

"She hasn't been on stage for two years. How could she?"

"Two years off stage doesn't matter, but Yunmi is a big official now—could she dance with us?"

"Why not? Before, she didn't have a position but was still an Elder."

"That's different. Back then, she was an idle Elder without a post. Though her status was noble, few people knew her. Now it's different—she's a senior cadre in Guangzhou and the principal of the Cadre Training School—among the naturalized citizen cadres here today, probably many are her students."

"That's true. Dancing in front of students in a skirt like this..." The girls looked at their skirts—calling them skirts, they didn't even cover the knees. Though they had all received new-style education from childhood and were mostly orphans without parents instilling ideas, the relatively conservative social atmosphere still put great pressure on them. Even in Lingao, the "most advanced" place, many naturalized citizens still pointed and whispered about them behind their backs.

No matter how much the Elders affirmed them, how many honors they gave, how many examples female Elders set for them, the girls still felt an inexplicable sense of shame about their performances.

Suddenly the curtain lifted. Everyone looked up and it was none other than Zhang Yunmi. She wore a newly made performance costume, looking radiant.

"Yunmi!" The girls all crowded around her.

"You look so beautiful in this!"

"Are you going to perform too?"

"If we're performing, we haven't rehearsed..."

"We've danced 'Journey of Love' so many times, we don't need to rehearse to know it."

Having been separated from them for two years, Zhang Yunmi's mindset was very different from before. She'd originally had no intention of performing. This appearance was half in response to requests from the Plaid Skirt Club's Elder sponsors, and also because Municipal Government Elders all suggested she reprise her role, contributing to the effort to change customs.

"Is everyone doing well?" Zhang Yunmi asked with a smile. These two years of experience had made her more worldly.

"Yes, yes, everyone's good." Lin Aili had always been the team's number two, only becoming Center after Zhang Yunmi left. Now she clutched Zhang Yunmi's hand, unwilling to let go. "We've all been hoping you'd come back..."

"Coming back is impossible," Zhang Yunmi laughed. "But a guest appearance is no problem."

"With you as Center, we feel more at ease during performances." A girl said, "Aili's voice is too soft—feels unreliable."

"Where am I soft? Where am I soft?" Lin Aili pretended to be angry.

"Oh, so you're saying my dancing is stiff then." Zhang Yunmi joined in the teasing.

The girl became flustered: "No, no, absolutely not... Your dancing is beautiful..."

The stage crew began calling: "Countdown three minutes—prepare to go on!"

Outside, the sky was gradually darkening, the heavens slightly blue. Clouds cast their shadows. Against the dusk, Great World's hall seemed even more brilliantly lit. The spectators beyond the security line, though hungry all day, remained excited, enthusiastically discussing the banquet scene in the hall. Vendors also seized the opportunity to squeeze through the crowd, hawking various snacks and thirst-quenching fruits.

Suddenly, the lights on the stage built on Great World's steps came on, and shadowy figures could be seen moving on stage.

Everyone had heard that this wedding would feature an "Australian performing troupe"—or some said it wasn't a theatrical troupe but the Council of Elders' "song and dance troupe." Supposedly, it was "most licentious and corrupting." Just young women showing legs and arms, swaying hips and bottoms, was enough to make hot-blooded young men lose control. Supposedly because it was too obscene, this troupe rarely performed, reserved for Elders only, with only a few naturalized citizens having seen it...

The loafers spat gossip continuously while listeners itched with curiosity, all wanting to see this rarest of Australian spectacles. Now as the stage lights came on, the crowd instantly stirred, surging forward. Fortunately, preparations had been made—not only had the National Army set up a security line, but special barriers had been placed to prevent the crowd from overwhelming it.

With five metallic strikes through the speakers, the opening of "Journey of Love" began. With the music, the stage lights suddenly "whooshed" fully on, illuminating the girls on stage dazzlingly—their performance costumes were blue, made of real silk mixed with silver thread. By adjusting the ratios of silk and silver, different shades were woven. To enhance this subtle shimmering effect, crystal glass was added as decorative accents. What seemed a simple costume was actually extremely labor-intensive and material-costly. Because silver oxidizes easily and loses its luster, such a costume could only be used a few times before being scrapped—utterly extravagant. But its stage effect under the lights was unprecedentedly stunning.

The shimmering costumes sparkled under the stage spotlights, captivating even the idlers who had come specifically to see "white legs."

With the opening, Zhang Yunmi, originally facing away from the audience, spun around, made an adorable "blow a kiss" gesture, and swayed her hips as she walked from the back row to the front.

The entire plaza erupted. The crowd surged like ocean waves, suddenly undulating and crashing against the security line in an explosion of exclamations.

The exclamations came not only from natives seeing such a performance for the first time, but also from many naturalized citizens. Because many of them recognized that the most radiant girl standing in the center of the formation, wearing a miniskirt, singing and dancing, was none other than the Municipal Government Secretary-General and Cadre Training School Principal—Zhang Yunmi.

A female Elder of high position and great power coming out personally to dance! This news instantly spread throughout the venue inside and out. The crowd was in an uproar. Spectators outside, needless to say, pushed forward desperately. Even the guests in the hall now forgot propriety, swarming outside to watch this "unprecedented marvel" from the closest distance.

The skirts of the dancing girls swayed in one direction with the beat, then swished back the other way. This rhythmically synchronized dance instantly captivated countless people, drawing another wave of exclamations.

"Such uniform dancing! Like one person!"

"Look at the Elder lady's legs..."

"An official's daughter playing the role of a courtesan—truly unprecedented!"

"Those legs! So long and straight!"

"You've drooled down to your chest!"

"Stop pretending to be proper—you're pushing forward just as hard!"

...

The crowd's noise was so great it nearly drowned out the music from the speakers. The National Army had to draw bayonets to prevent the audience from surging forward. Reserve forces also began dispersing people at the crowd's rear to prevent further pressing forward.

Liu Xiang watched the grand scene before him, feeling somewhat moved. The shock of cultural forms transcending time was unprecedented, but whether this shock would be accepted by people of this timeline was still unknown—he had read about how the Moscow Bolshoi Ballet's visit to Chinese communes in the 1950s had received the comment "naked women dancing."

"What a waste..." Cui Hantang beside him said, patting his belly. "These speakers! These amps! These costumes! And these girls—why not do anything else instead of this!"

Liu Xiang nodded: "The impact is certainly strong, but the effect is uncertain."

"Exactly, exactly! My Daoist ritual dancing, *daoqing* performances, Eight Trigrams Sword and Tai Chi... any of them would blend better with the social environment than this! Yet this bunch still manages to get so many resources!" Cui Hantang complained indignantly. The speakers, mixing equipment, and amplifiers were things he had long coveted. He'd borrowed them a few times, always having to plead. But the Plaid Skirt Club could borrow them just by asking. Moreover, he had always had issues with the Plaid Skirt Club, denouncing it as decadent culture, which had caused considerable friction with the club's bigwigs.

Liu Xiang laughed when he heard this: "You're still hung up on that? Self-funding for religious organizations is national policy. The Plaid Skirt Club also self-funds—how many resources can they consume? Besides, the Council of Elders considers these 'decadent songs' no big deal. I know: you just can't stand it."

"Right, I just can't stand this nonsense. Good Chinese people doing this stuff..."

"See, that's not right." Liu Xiang felt it was necessary to give Daoist Cui a reminder. "Why do you think we risked our lives coming to this timeline?"

"For our ideals."

"Exactly. Those grand ideals of stars and seas, communism, imperialism—let's not talk about those, they're too lofty. Many Elders just want a human zoo or to be Governor of Tahiti. Those Plaid Skirt Club guys just want to experience being an idol manager."

"If they want to satisfy their cravings behind closed doors, nobody's stopping them. The problem is satisfying cravings takes resources—what good does it do for our cause?"

Liu Xiang chuckled: "That talk isn't good for unity. Chief Wen put it well: don't always think about controlling heaven and earth and reproductive organs, trying to control everything. Look, these few Elders running their idol group consume a little resources. Harmless to man and beast, saving everyone so much worry. Otherwise, if they were all like... those few in the Council of Elders, wouldn't that be more annoying?"

Now Cui Hantang finally understood. These seemingly casual words were actually quite heartfelt.

"Old Liu, you make sense. I'll turn a blind eye to this and let them do their thing." Once Cui Hantang thought it through, he became quite broad-minded. "Besides, Little Zhang also likes this stuff—might as well let her be happy."
