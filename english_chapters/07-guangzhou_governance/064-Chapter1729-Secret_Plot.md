# Chapter 1729: Secret Plot

Liang Cunhou nodded: "It's rare for Second Master Huang to have such a loyal and patriotic heart! However, sending a warning only requires a messenger. Young Master Huang has great talent and understands the situation of the Hair-shorn thieves. You are a rare talent for the court. I have more important matters that require Second Master Huang's talent."

Huang Bingkun hurriedly said: "As long as it benefits the country and the people, I am at Young Master Liang's command!"

"The trend in Guangzhou is gone. The Hair-shorn thieves' morale is high and unstoppable. The government troops have neither combat power nor the will to fight. The only thing available now is the people's hearts!" Liang Cunhou whispered.

"But the Hair-shorn thieves are accustomed to confusing people with empty words. Commoners are bewitched as if drunk or crazy. Even if a sage were reborn, he couldn't explain it clearly..." Huang Bingkun felt that every time people's hearts were discussed, the Hair-shorn thieves were always the winners.

"Hehe. That is incorrect!" Liang Cunhou said, "The Hair-shorn thieves have just landed and their foothold is not stable. It is the perfect time to mobilize the Righteous Army!" He was slightly excited, "This place is not like Qiongzhou. It is a place that has long submitted to the King's influence. There are many gentry and scholars. As long as we explain the great principles and have leaders come out, we don't need to worry about the Righteous Army not rising up like bees!"

Liang Cunhou's plan was to have Huang Bingkun go to the more remote county towns in the Pearl River Delta to mobilize the Righteous Army. He estimated that the Australians wouldn't have too many troops. The officials in various counties were either afraid of the enemy like tigers or trend-chasing. In the short term, it would inevitably be "pacification by proclamation." Since the Hair-shorn thieves didn't have many troops, they couldn't disperse their forces to garrison every county. Therefore, the counties would either have no garrison or very few troops. They were all playing the Empty Fort Strategy.

"I heard Young Master Huang say that every time the Hair-shorn thieves occupy a place, they recruit Fake Hair-shorn to 'respectfully transform' it," Liang Cunhou said. "The Hair-shorn thieves have achieved what they have today entirely by relying on ignorant and unruly people to defect and be their vanguard. We cannot give them this chance."

They had to seize the time when the Hair-shorn thieves hadn't yet recruited "Fake Hair-shorn" on a large scale to send people out to organize and mobilize local gentry and powerful families. They often recruited village braves, and once gathered, they could raise thousands of men in an instant.

As long as they eliminated the magistrates and small garrisons sent by the Hair-shorn thieves, the momentum of the Righteous Army would be greatly boosted, and the commoners in the county would not dare to be incited by the Hair-shorn thieves. From one county to several counties, and then from several counties to various places, it would instantly form a prairie fire!

"...At that time, the Hair-shorn thieves will only have a few thousand troops, struggling to cope left and right. At most, they will just be trapped in Guangzhou City. Trade cut off, food and grass insufficient. What use will their sharp ships and cannons be then? Once the Heavenly Army arrives, they will eventually have to flee back to Qiongzhou."

Huang Bingkun felt this plan was feasible. Although the Hair-shorn thieves' army was good at fighting, their numbers were extremely small, certainly insufficient to control such a large territory as Guangdong. If a situation of "the whole province raising the Righteous Army together" could really be created, the Hair-shorn thieves wouldn't be able to slowly cultivate their own power.

"This plan is excellent, but..." Huang Bingkun worried, "I am an outsider. How can I gain the trust of the gentry when I arrive in the county, and how can I persuade them to raise troops..."

"You don't need to worry about this matter." Liang Cunhou said, "I have suitable people locally. It's just that they are not familiar with the Hair-shorn thieves' situation and need you, this 'military counselor,' to assist."

Huang Bingkun felt a surge of excitement. Although he was a Xiucai, he had fought many battles with his father in the past: fought bandits, fought pirates, and engaged in armed fights with nearby villages over water sources. His courage still remained. Living submissively under the pressure of the Hair-shorn thieves for these years, he had long held back a bellyful of fire. Hearing that he was to lead the "Righteous Army" to fight, he couldn't help but feel heroic. He stood up, cupped his hands and said: "I dare not spare my body and will certainly not disgrace the mission!"

Liang Cunhou nodded slightly with an appreciative expression, raised his wine cup, and said: "Second Master Huang, I toast you!"

Lin Zunxiu also hurriedly said: "I also toast you." But in his heart, he breathed a sigh of relief.

The three drank the wine in their cups in one gulp. Huang Bingkun said: "I have one more thing, please ask Young Master Liang to consider."

"Speak freely."

"We are starting the Righteous Army for the country and the people, but we still need a name from the court to appeal to people..."

"Second Master Huang doesn't need to worry about this. I will send someone to handle it. Among the lords in the court, there have long been those who saw through the wolfish ambition of the Hair-shorn thieves. Among the local gentry in Guangzhou, there are also high-minded scholars who disdain the Hair-shorn thieves."

"Good!" Huang Bingkun said, "This matter should be done urgently, not delayed. Please arrange it, Young Master, I will set off tomorrow!"

"Don't be anxious." Liang Cunhou said, "Although the four gates of Guangzhou do not prohibit pedestrians now, the inspection is very strict. Since you have to carry my letter, it would be bad if it were found out. Wait a few days for the gate restrictions to relax a bit, and I will send a special person to send you off. Don't go back these few days. Just rest here. I will send someone to your lodging to take care of things, bringing your servant boy and luggage together. They will go with you when the time comes."

"He is not my household servant, but a gift from a friend in Guangzhou. He hasn't received much grace from me. My trip involves the danger of war. If he follows, he may not be able to exert his utmost effort and might act as a burden. Please dismiss him for me, Young Master Liang: he can return to his original master's house or seek a living on his own."

"Not appropriate. Handling it this way might leak your whereabouts. I think he should just stay in my residence." Liang Cunhou said, "I will send capable servants to go with you."

"Many thanks, Young Master Liang!"

The three of them discussed for a long time, talking about countermeasures after the Hair-shorn thieves entered the city. Liang Cunhou sent someone to take Huang Bingkun to the guest room to rest. He then secretly discussed with Lin Zunxiu again.

"The Hair-shorn thieves will definitely summon the gentry of the whole city in the next few days. Others don't matter, but Mister Qiutao is the most worrying..."

Chen Zizhuang was the number one gentry in Guangzhou City and had a very high reputation. His attitude would affect many people.

Lin Zunxiu said puzzledly: "Young Master worries too much, right? Although Mister Qiutao offended the Emperor, right and wrong, loyalty and treachery can always be distinguished clearly..."

Liang Cunhou said: "I am not worried about this! How dare I doubt Mister Qiutao's moral articles? It's just that he also has a family. If he harbors a thought of dealing with them perfunctorily and circles around with the Hair-shorn thieves, the Hair-shorn thieves will have achieved their goal!"

Lin Zunxiu thought about it. Chen Zizhuang wouldn't necessarily commit suicide to die for the country just because Guangzhou City fell. When the Hair-shorn thieves came to invite him to a meeting, he would at most claim illness and not go, closing his door to guests. He couldn't go completely against the Hair-shorn thieves. The Hair-shorn thieves could use this to make an issue.

"In that case..."

"We need to ask him to lie low for a while." Liang Cunhou said, "The plan for now is to quickly notify him to hide. This will trouble you..."

Lin Zunxiu was startled and said: "But this younger brother has no old acquaintance with him..."

With Chen Zizhuang's status and position, a merchant's son with insignificant academic honors like Lin Zunxiu couldn't climb up to him at all.

"Why do you need to be an old acquaintance?" Young Master Liang laughed, "Your family runs a restaurant. Just go find him under the pretext of delivering a banquet. I have another letter here. He will definitely see you then."

He lowered his voice: "This matter is of great importance. This foolish brother dares not entrust the letter to others. I can only ask you to make a trip personally."

Since he said so, Lin Zunxiu had to say: "This younger brother will go tomorrow!"

Liang Cunhou nodded and asked again: "Of those people in your Yuyuan Society, how many are reliable and how many are unreliable?"

The Yuyuan Society was a mixed bag. Although most people held the attitude of "using barbarian skills to control barbarians," there was no lack of "Spiritually-Hair-shorn" who admired Hair-shorn studies and prostrated themselves before the Australians.

This question made it difficult for Lin Zunxiu to answer. He thought for a while and said: "Except for a few people, most are still reliable. The Hair-shorn thieves are now openly rebels. No matter how confused they are, could they serve thieves with their bodies?"

Young Master Liang shook his head and said: "They are still reliable now, but it's not certain in a few days. Serving thieves with one's body and acknowledging a thief as father are very common occurrences in all dynasties. Even in the roving bandits' army, there are many people of the robed class." He picked up a piece of roast duck, put it in his mouth and chewed slowly, saying, "The society is full of scholars. The Hair-shorn thieves have just entered the city, and everything is waiting to be done. What they lack is talent..."

Lin Zunxiu shivered: "You mean, the Hair-shorn thieves will lure them with false positions?"

"That is certain." Liang Cunhou sneered, "Don't look at how they haven't held imperial examinations in Qiongzhou for many years and only ran schools—that was because Qiongzhou didn't have so many scholars. Now that they are in Guangzhou, they will inevitably recruit scholars in the name of opening imperial examinations to recruit talents. At that time, how can those children from poor families resist? Ordinary scholars are one thing, but everyone in the society is versed in Hair-shorn studies. Once they accept false positions, the harm will be severe!"

Lin Zunxiu thought about it and it was indeed true. He hurriedly said: "This... then what?"

Young Master Liang took out a leather document case from the drawer, and took out several Delong checks and a list from inside.

"These are Delong checks. Your family runs a restaurant, so large withdrawals won't attract attention. Just distribute them one by one according to this list. Consider it a subsidy from the society. Naturally, you also have to give them a few hints. Don't let the desire for fame and fortune turn their heads! Ending up with 'the heart to take but no life to enjoy'." Liang Cunhou said grimly.

"This younger brother understands!" Lin Zunxiu said awesomely.

Liang Cunhou stroked his forehead with his hand: "Nowadays, people's hearts are not what they used to be. Without silver, it's hard to move an inch. Even this loyalty has to be maintained by silver!" He sighed endlessly as he spoke.

Lin Zunxiu remained silent. Suddenly Young Master Liang asked again: "How is Wu Ming?"

Lin Zunxiu was startled: "Him? He is very interested in Hair-shorn studies and is also clever. I heard he has dealings with the Hair-shorn thieves in the Great World."

Liang Cunhou was silent for a long while, then said: "Let me think again."

"This person is probably not very reliable." Lin Zunxiu said, "He has always been disrespectful to the court and frivolous in speech."

"This is understandable. He prides himself on being smarter than ordinary people and writes brilliant essays, but he repeatedly fails the exams. Up to now, he hasn't even obtained the status of a supplementary student," Liang Cunhou sighed, "Haven't you heard that essays have fate? He can't see through this point, so naturally, he has resentment in his chest. I originally wanted to help him in this exam, but heaven does not granting human wishes!"

Lin Zunxiu said: "That's also his lack of fortune."

"Whether he has fortune or not aside, he cannot be used at this moment. What a pity!" Liang Cunhou felt it was a pity. If he had helped him enter the academy this time, publicly he would have obtained court honors, and privately he would have received his grace. Naturally, he wouldn't be bewitched by the Hair-shorn thieves. "This person is proficient in Hair-shorn studies and clever. He could have been a great help to us."
