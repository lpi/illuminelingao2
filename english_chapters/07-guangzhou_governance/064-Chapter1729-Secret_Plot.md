# Chapter 1729: Secret Plot

Liang Cunhou nodded: "It is rare for Second Master Huang to harbor such loyal and patriotic sentiments! However, sending a warning requires only a messenger. Young Master Huang possesses great talent and understands the Hair-shorn bandits' situation—you are a rare asset for the court. I have more important matters that require your abilities."

Huang Bingkun hastened to say: "As long as it benefits the country and the people, I am at Young Master Liang's command!"

"The tide in Guangzhou has turned against us. The Hair-shorn bandits' morale is high and unstoppable. The government troops have neither combat power nor fighting spirit. The only resource available now is the hearts of the people!" Liang Cunhou spoke in a low voice.

"But the Hair-shorn bandits are habitually skilled at confusing people with empty words. The commoners are bewitched as if drunk or dreaming. Even if a sage were reborn, he couldn't explain the truth to them..." Huang Bingkun felt that whenever the hearts of the people were discussed, the Hair-shorn bandits always emerged victorious.

"Heh. That is not so!" Liang Cunhou countered. "The Hair-shorn bandits have just landed and their foothold is not yet secure. This is precisely the time to mobilize the Righteous Army!" A hint of excitement crept into his voice. "This place is unlike Qiongzhou. Here the King's influence has long held sway. There are many gentry and scholars. As long as we explain the great principles and leaders step forward, we need not worry—the Righteous Army will rise like bees!"

Liang Cunhou's plan was to have Huang Bingkun travel to the more remote county towns in the Pearl River Delta to mobilize the Righteous Army. He estimated that the Australians couldn't have many troops. The officials in various counties were either paralyzed by fear of the enemy or simply following the prevailing wind. In the short term, they would inevitably opt for "pacification by proclamation." Since the Hair-shorn bandits lacked sufficient forces, they couldn't disperse their strength to garrison every county. Therefore, the counties would either have no garrison at all or only token forces. They were all playing the Empty Fort Strategy.

"I heard Young Master Huang say that every time the Hair-shorn bandits occupy a place, they recruit Fake Hair-shorn to 'respectfully transform' it," Liang Cunhou said. "The Hair-shorn bandits have achieved everything they have today entirely by relying on ignorant, unruly people who defect and serve as their vanguard. We cannot give them that opportunity."

They had to seize the time before the Hair-shorn bandits could recruit "Fake Hair-shorn" on a large scale, sending people out to organize and mobilize local gentry and powerful families. These men typically recruited village militia, and once gathered, could raise thousands of men instantly.

As long as they eliminated the magistrates and small garrisons dispatched by the Hair-shorn bandits, the momentum of the Righteous Army would surge dramatically. The commoners in each county would no longer dare to be incited by the bandits. From one county to several, then from several to all corners—it would spread like wildfire across the prairie!

"...At that point, the Hair-shorn bandits will have only a few thousand troops, struggling desperately on all fronts. At most, they'll simply be trapped inside Guangzhou City. Trade severed, food and supplies insufficient—what use will their sharp ships and cannons be then? Once the Imperial Army arrives, they will inevitably flee back to Qiongzhou."

Huang Bingkun found the plan viable. Though the Hair-shorn bandits' army excelled at fighting, their numbers were pitifully small—certainly insufficient to control territory as vast as Guangdong. If a situation of "the entire province raising the Righteous Army together" could truly be created, the Hair-shorn bandits would have no time to slowly cultivate their own power base.

"This plan is excellent, but..." Huang Bingkun hesitated. "I am an outsider. When I arrive in these counties, how can I gain the gentry's trust? How can I persuade them to take up arms..."

"You needn't worry about that." Liang Cunhou said. "I have suitable people locally. They simply lack familiarity with the Hair-shorn bandits' situation and need you—their 'military counselor'—to assist."

Huang Bingkun felt a surge of excitement. Though he was only a *Xiucai*, he had fought many battles alongside his father in the past: against bandits, against pirates, and in armed feuds with neighboring villages over water sources. His courage remained intact. Living submissively under the Hair-shorn bandits' pressure all these years, he had long harbored a belly full of fire. Hearing that he would lead the "Righteous Army" into battle, he couldn't help but feel heroic. He stood, clasped his hands, and declared: "I dare not spare my body and will certainly not disgrace the mission!"

Liang Cunhou nodded with an appreciative expression, raised his wine cup, and said: "Second Master Huang—I toast you!"

Lin Zunxiu hurriedly added: "I toast you as well." But in his heart, he breathed a sigh of relief.

The three drained their cups in one gulp. Huang Bingkun said: "There is one more matter I would ask Young Master Liang to consider."

"Speak freely."

"We are raising the Righteous Army for the country and the people, but we still require the court's imprimatur to rally support..."

"Second Master Huang needn't worry about this. I will send someone to handle it. Among the lords at court, there have long been those who saw through the wolfish ambitions of the Hair-shorn bandits. Among the local gentry of Guangzhou, there are also high-minded scholars who hold the bandits in contempt."

"Good!" Huang Bingkun declared. "This matter should be done urgently, not delayed. Please make the arrangements, Young Master—I will depart tomorrow!"

"Don't be hasty." Liang Cunhou cautioned. "Though the four gates of Guangzhou do not currently prohibit pedestrians, inspection is very strict. Since you must carry my letter, it would be disastrous if it were discovered. Wait a few days for the gate restrictions to ease, and I will send a special person to see you off. Don't return to your lodgings these few days. Rest here instead. I will send someone to your quarters to handle matters, bringing your servant boy and luggage together. They will accompany you when the time comes."

"He is not my household servant, but a gift from a friend in Guangzhou. He hasn't received much grace from me. My mission involves the dangers of war. If he accompanies me, he may not exert his utmost effort and might become a burden instead. Please dismiss him on my behalf, Young Master Liang—he can return to his original master's household or seek his living independently."

"That won't do. Handling it that way might reveal your whereabouts. I think he should simply remain at my residence." Liang Cunhou said. "I will send capable servants to accompany you."

"Many thanks, Young Master Liang!"

---

The three discussed matters at length, talking through countermeasures now that the Hair-shorn bandits had entered the city. Liang Cunhou sent someone to escort Huang Bingkun to the guest quarters to rest. Then he conferred privately with Lin Zunxiu.

"The Hair-shorn bandits will certainly summon the city's gentry in the next few days. The others don't matter, but Mister Qiutao concerns me most..."

Chen Zizhuang was the foremost gentry of Guangzhou City and enjoyed an immense reputation. His attitude would influence many others.

Lin Zunxiu said, puzzled: "Young Master worries too much, surely? Though Mister Qiutao offended the Emperor, right and wrong, loyalty and treachery—these can still be distinguished clearly..."

Liang Cunhou said: "That is not my concern! How would I dare doubt Mister Qiutao's moral convictions? It's only that he too has a family. If he harbors any thought of dealing with the bandits perfunctorily—circling around them evasively—the Hair-shorn bandits will have achieved their goal!"

Lin Zunxiu considered this. Chen Zizhuang wouldn't necessarily commit suicide for the country merely because Guangzhou had fallen. When the Hair-shorn bandits came to invite him to a meeting, he would likely at most plead illness and refuse, shutting his doors to guests. He couldn't openly defy the bandits. And the Hair-shorn bandits could exploit even that.

"In that case..."

"We need to ask him to lie low for a while." Liang Cunhou said. "The immediate plan is to notify him quickly to hide. I must trouble you with this..."

Lin Zunxiu was startled: "But I have no prior acquaintance with him..."

Given Chen Zizhuang's status and position, a merchant's son with insignificant examination credentials like Lin Zunxiu couldn't possibly gain access to him.

"Why would you need prior acquaintance?" Young Master Liang laughed. "Your family runs a restaurant. Simply go to him under the pretext of delivering a banquet. I have a letter here. He will certainly see you then."

He lowered his voice: "This matter is of great importance. I dare not entrust the letter to others. I can only ask you to make the trip personally."

Since he put it that way, Lin Zunxiu could only say: "I will go tomorrow!"

Liang Cunhou nodded, then asked: "Of those people in your Yuyuan Society—how many are reliable, and how many are not?"

The Yuyuan Society was a mixed bag. Though most members held the attitude of "using barbarian skills to control barbarians," there was no lack of "Spiritually Hair-shorn" who admired Hair-shorn studies and prostrated themselves before the Australians.

This question made it difficult for Lin Zunxiu to answer. He thought for a moment: "Except for a few individuals, most are still reliable. The Hair-shorn bandits are now openly rebels. No matter how confused someone might be, would they really serve thieves with their own bodies?"

Young Master Liang shook his head: "They are reliable now, but in a few days, that may change. Serving thieves with one's body, acknowledging a thief as father—these are common occurrences throughout history. Even in the roving bandits' armies, there are many from the robed class." He picked up a piece of roast duck, put it in his mouth, and chewed slowly. "The society is full of scholars. The Hair-shorn bandits have just entered the city and everything awaits doing. What they lack is talent..."

Lin Zunxiu shivered: "You mean the Hair-shorn bandits will lure them with false positions?"

"That is certain." Liang Cunhou sneered. "Don't be deceived because they haven't held imperial examinations in Qiongzhou for years and only ran schools—that was because Qiongzhou didn't have enough scholars. Now that they're in Guangzhou, they will inevitably recruit scholars under the guise of holding examinations to gather talent. When that happens, how can children from poor families resist? Ordinary scholars are one thing, but everyone in your society is versed in Hair-shorn studies. Once they accept false positions, the harm will be severe!"

Lin Zunxiu considered this and realized it was indeed true. He said urgently: "Then what should we do?"

Young Master Liang produced a leather document case from a drawer, extracting several Delong bank drafts and a list.

"These are Delong drafts. Your family runs a restaurant, so large withdrawals won't attract attention. Distribute them one by one according to this list. Consider it a subsidy from the society. Naturally, you must also offer a few hints—don't let the desire for fame and fortune cloud their judgment! They might end up with 'the heart to take but no life to enjoy.'" Liang Cunhou spoke grimly.

"I understand!" Lin Zunxiu said solemnly.

Liang Cunhou pressed his hand to his forehead: "These days, people's hearts are no longer what they were. Without silver, one cannot take a step forward. Even loyalty must be maintained with silver!" He sighed endlessly as he spoke.

Lin Zunxiu remained silent. Suddenly Young Master Liang asked: "What about Wu Ming?"

Lin Zunxiu was startled: "Him? He is very interested in Hair-shorn studies and quite clever. I've heard he has dealings with the Hair-shorn bandits at the Great World."

Liang Cunhou was silent for a long moment, then said: "Let me think further."

"That person is probably unreliable." Lin Zunxiu said. "He has always been disrespectful toward the court and careless in speech."

"This is understandable. He prides himself on being smarter than ordinary people and writes brilliant essays, yet he repeatedly fails the examinations. To this day, he hasn't even obtained the status of a supplementary student." Liang Cunhou sighed. "Haven't you heard that essays have their own fate? He cannot see through this point, so naturally he harbors resentment. I originally intended to help him in this examination session, but heaven did not grant my wish!"

Lin Zunxiu said: "That is also his lack of fortune."

"Whether he has fortune or not aside, he cannot be employed at this moment. What a pity!" Liang Cunhou felt it was a waste. If he had helped Wu Ming enter the academy this time—publicly, the man would have obtained court honors; privately, he would have been in Liang's debt. He naturally wouldn't be seduced by the Hair-shorn bandits. "This person is proficient in Hair-shorn studies and clever. He could have been a great asset to us."
