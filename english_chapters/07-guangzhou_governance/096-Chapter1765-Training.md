# Chapter 1765 - Training

The police trainees' jaws dropped and their eyes widened. They had assumed that being a policeman meant being a petty constable—even if the Australians didn't treat runners as low-caste pariahs, there was little to boast about. They hadn't expected the Australians to wrap the whole thing in lofty rhetoric about "serving the people," elevating "earning a bowl of rice as a lowly runner" to the level of "a knight-errant dispensing justice."

"As for *why* you want to be police—I'm sure the answers vary. Most of you are here to put food on the table, to support your families, to eat a little better, to bring home a few extra coins." Before he had even finished, laughter rippled through the crowd. Pan Jiexin smiled too. "There's nothing wrong with that! We're human beings. We have to eat; we have feelings and desires; we have families to feed. But don't forget: everything we eat and wear is provided by the Senatorial Council and the people. Yes, being a policeman is about personal advancement and compensation—but more importantly, it's about repaying the Senatorial Council and the people. No matter where you came from or what trade you followed, always remember this!" His gaze swept the hall. "Always remember: Loyal to the Senatorial Council! Loyal to the Nation! Loyal to the People! Loyal to the Law!"

He finished and let his eyes roam once more. "That concludes my remarks!"

The trainees bellowed in unison: "Sir!"

After the ceremony, the sergeants marched the trainees to the parade ground for basic police etiquette and formation drills. Pan Jiexin strolled over to observe. He had barely reached the edge of the field when two sharp whistle-blasts sounded—"Twee! Twee!"—and the formation, which had been practicing the quick-march, halted at once. The sergeant serving as drill instructor ran over, snapped to attention, and saluted: "Report! First Session Short-Course Trainees of the Guangzhou Police Academy currently conducting formation drill. Awaiting your instructions!"

Pan Jiexin returned the salute, inwardly sizing up the situation. "Proceed as planned," he said. The sergeant turned on his heel, jogged back, and called out the cadence to resume.

Formation drill had always been delegated to the army; Pan Jiexin had never had to worry about it. He noticed that each trainee wore mismatched shoes—one cloth shoe, one straw sandal. This was a time-tested trick for drilling raw recruits who didn't know left from right.

From the ragged lines, he knew this drill would take a long while yet. Still, nothing built discipline and obedience like formation training.

Li Ziyu stood in the ranks, inwardly cursing. This wasn't joining the Quick Class—it was being drilled like a common foot-soldier! Even regular troops didn't train this hard! As his mind wandered, his step faltered; he nearly knocked the cloth shoe off the man in front of him.

"Halt!" the sergeant bellowed. "Third rank, fifth man—you again! Earlier during attention drill it was you, too! Can't you keep your arms tight? Sloppy as wet noodles!"

"I—" Li Ziyu froze.

"I what? Say 'Report'!"

Li Ziyu finally found his voice: "Report!"

"Fall out! Ten push-ups! Count out loud!"

"Yes! One—two—three—" Li Ziyu scrambled out of line, dropped to the ground, and began the exercise he had only recently learned.

"Doesn't count. Start over!"

"Why is your rear end sticking up like that?" A heavy boot landed on his backside. Li Ziyu yelped and collapsed flat.

"Get up! Stop acting like a woman!"

"Elbows level! Chest down! Right... legs straight!"

The sergeant drilled Li Ziyu for seven or eight minutes, one-on-one. The rest of the formation stood ramrod-straight throughout.

Pan Jiexin surveyed the entire field. This had once been the open ground where the Wanshou Palace set up its ritual altars; it had been leveled and turned into a parade ground, though it still felt rather small. Workers were installing a horizontal bar and a balance beam off to one side.

Though the recruits had passed a fitness screening and looked reasonably healthy, the heavy training load and nonstop schedule would be too much for their constitutions. A five-minute kilometer was below junior-high PE standards in the twenty-first century, yet here it was enough to eliminate many. The trainee doing push-ups in front of him was already breaking out in a cold sweat.

Pan Jiexin slipped quietly into the kitchen. The newly renovated facility was steamy and fragrant. It was nearly mealtime, and the aroma of rice and dishes hung in the air.

His appearance caused a small stir. An assimilated cadre in charge of the mess trotted over. "Chief—"

"Give me an apron." He wasted no time on pleasantries. "Don't stop working—carry on."

Donning apron and cap, Pan Jiexin began prowling the kitchen. This mess unit had been dispatched by the Joint Logistics Headquarters. To reduce supply-chain complexity and redundant construction, all Guangdong logistics were currently handled by Joint Logistics. Director Hong had anticipated that feeding the various incoming contingents would be a problem, so he'd set up a "Cooking Training Course" in Hong Kong ahead of time to produce several dozen kitchen teams capable of meeting Senatorial Council standards for cuisine and hygiene.

Having meals provided by Joint Logistics kitchens gave the Senators peace of mind. Hygiene standards differed wildly between the two timelines; even the cleanest native's notions of cleanliness would be problematic by old-world standards. Most importantly, assimilated cooks were far more honest than local cooks steeped in the tradition that "a cook who doesn't steal, the gods themselves forsake."

Running a mess hall might sound trivial, but mismanagement could become a big deal. Though this was only a short-course session, Pan Jiexin regarded it as the foundational capital of the National Police in Guangdong, and he took the trainees very seriously.

A large bamboo steamer was lifted off the fire, revealing rows of neatly arranged galvanized iron lunch-boxes. Pan Jiexin picked up tongs, extracted one, popped it open, and poked a chopstick into the rice. He waited a few seconds, withdrew it, and examined it closely.

The softness, moisture, and steam were all correct—no excess water added to inflate the yield. He tasted a bit: the slightly rough, chewy texture of brown rice, the proper aroma, no mustiness or off-flavors. The grains were intact, neither broken nor powdery. Good rice.

"Set this box aside for me."

"Yes, Chief." The head cook was used to spot-checks and inspections of every variety, but having a Chief personally inspect the kitchen still made him nervous—everyone knew the Chief's standards were exacting.

The dishes were ready. The Academy trainees were fed according to Joint Logistics' "New Recruit Supply Standard." Because recruits in this timeline were typically underfed, the ration standard was fairly generous, with increased protein.

Large iron trays held golden fish-cakes fresh from the roasting pan, fragrant and glistening. Beside them were big pots of stew: vegetables plus "frozen minced meat" and crushed bean dregs. The so-called "frozen minced meat" was the daily residue scraped from the sausage and fish-paste production lines, mixed together and frozen solid—intended specifically for mass cooking.

Finally, there were greens, "stir-fried" in salted water. In theory, the vegetables were "locally sourced"—but in practice, everything came from Hong Kong. Director Hong had discovered that shipping produce from the Agricultural Reclamation Brigade was far cheaper and more convenient than buying from Guangzhou's suburbs. By this timeline's general standards, the meal was lavish.

Pan Jiexin sampled every dish, then inspected the sanitation and the separation of raw and cooked items. Passable, barely. Assimilated personnel were more reliable, but not entirely so; constant supervision was necessary.

"Good," he said. "Serve on time!"

The morning's training ended quickly. The trainees, led by their squad leaders, filed into the assembly hall to collect their meals—apart from the hall, the Wanshou Palace had no room large enough. Even so, they had to eat in shifts.

The hall echoed with heavy breathing. The point of formation drill was precisely to instill discipline; for natives who had never been subjected to such regimentation, the "rigid" exercises were pure torment.

Meals were served individually—one box per person. From its founding, the Fubo Army had eschewed communal eating. Communal meals were not only unsanitary but invited the phenomenon of "just enough to cover the bottom of the plate"—and gave sergeants and veterans chances to help themselves to more than their share.

For most of the trainees, this first meal was unbelievably good. Before the food had even been fully distributed, the sound of loud swallowing could be heard from every corner. When the command "Eat!" was given, the hall erupted with the sounds of ravenous devouring. Some men were weeping as they ate.

For Li Ziyu, the food was decent enough, but not so good as to move him to tears. Besides, on the first day, there wasn't even a whole chicken, duck, or fish—rather stingy, in his view. Watching the men at neighboring tables wolf down their food like starving ghosts, he felt a touch of disdain. *What a bunch of paupers!*

His gaze drifted and suddenly landed on the "President" who had addressed them that morning—he was eating here too. Right at the first-row table. From where Li Ziyu sat, he could clearly see the Chief's meal: it was exactly the same as the trainees'.

Li Ziyu was quietly astonished. He had read plenty of Australian magazines full of talk about "sharing hardship and sharing sweetness," but he hadn't believed it was real. The classics certainly mentioned Bai Qi—"wearing the same clothes as the lowliest soldier, eating the same food; sleeping without a mat, marching on foot, personally carrying his own rations, and sharing the soldiers' toil; when a soldier had a festering sore, Bai Qi would suck the pus out himself." But that was the ancients. In the Ming, at least, he'd never seen a single general or officer behave that way. Officers dined on delicacies in silk robes while soldiers shivered and starved—that was the norm; nobody thought it strange. So he'd assumed the Australian magazines were just boasting.

*Who'd have thought the Australians really do practice it!* He was startled, and suddenly it dawned on him: the reason the Australians were invincible, the reason the *kun* soldiers "dared to fight," wasn't merely their superior firearms.
