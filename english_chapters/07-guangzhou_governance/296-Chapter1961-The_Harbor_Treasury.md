# Chapter 1961 - The Harbor Treasury

Thinking that he would soon be able to launch actual tax work, Ai Zhixin felt a small thrill of excitement. He had been in Guangzhou for several months and had achieved some accomplishments in "finance," but in "taxation" he could say he had no practical achievements at all—it was all just planning. Partly the plague had caused delays, and partly there was simply a severe lack of suitable personnel.

Now not only had the Wang couple arrived, but they'd also brought a batch of cadres from the tax short-course training class—far superior to his current subordinates, who were a mixed bag of old and new hands, basically "self-taught." There was much work that Ai Zhixin simply didn't trust them to handle, so he had been putting things off.

He looked at the arrival date and number of accompanying personnel, called Ai Yixin, and asked her to arrange appropriate offices and dormitories in the Salt Administration compound—also the Finance and Tax Bureau compound—according to the telegram.

Because there wasn't much practical work, these past few months Transmigrator Ai had spent considerable time on "basic infrastructure." Not only had he repaired numerous dilapidated buildings in the former Salt Administration compound and renovated a batch of old buildings, but he'd also built septic tanks and public toilets. He even installed a modern drainage system in the small courtyard that served as his office and bedroom—he'd had quite enough of chamber pots.

Finally, by demolishing some dangerous old buildings, he'd cleared open space for an exercise yard, doing exercises daily with Finance and Tax Bureau staff—tormenting the retained old clerks bitterly.

Though the Salt Administration compound was large with many buildings, the structures were extremely old. Combined with Guangzhou's humid and hot environment, the internal sanitary conditions were quite poor. The long-serving old clerks had various respiratory and joint ailments, and whenever the seasons changed, a group of them would report sick. In just half a year since Ai Zhixin took office, three of the retained clerks had reported "died of illness" or "medical retirement." Transmigrator Ai thus conceived the idea of "physical exercise" and started a "fitness movement" in the Finance and Tax Bureau—both for the retained personnel and to maintain the exercise habits that the naturalized citizen staff transferred from Hainan had developed.

Now, though the Salt Administration compound couldn't be called "completely renovated," it was at least much better than when he first arrived. Otherwise the Wang couple might not be willing to live in the compound.

On the day the Wang couple arrived in Guangzhou, Ai Zhixin rose early again—not to greet them, but because today was another routine harbor treasury audit. As Director of the Finance and Tax Bureau, he needed to go to Da Shijie to conduct an inventory audit of the Australian Song national treasury—the harbor treasury—and sign off on related transferred goods. Personnel from the Monopoly Bureau would also accompany him.

The so-called harbor treasury was actually the Executive Committee's national treasury, as well as the vault for various Delong Bank branches. Although the policy of establishing the Central Reserve Bank as the Executive Committee's central bank had been set, because the Central Reserve Bank had just opened and lacked branch offices, currently much central bank work was still being handled by Delong's local branches on its behalf.

The Executive Committee's finances served war first and foremost. The Finance Province would establish supply centers in traffic hubs (mainly ports) behind the front lines—at second or third tier positions—following the military. These supply centers later became national treasuries in various locations. Because Australian Song controlled the sea and wasn't afraid of robbery, and transport basically relied on ships, the national treasury was generally established at ports—called the "harbor treasury." Of course, this also had to do with the early period when they hadn't yet openly raised their flag and established their nation, making it inconvenient to use the word "national."

The harbor treasury originated from the wealth and valuables seized during the early raid on Gou Family Manor. The precious metals and other valuable items were shipped back to Lingao and stored directly in the Fengcheng's hold at Bopu Port. At that time the Fengcheng was the safest place, and being at the port also made it convenient to sell these valuables in places like Guangzhou in exchange for other materials urgently needed by the Executive Committee. After the perilous infancy period passed, specialized warehouses were built at the port, and the materials stored in the Fengcheng's hold were gradually moved ashore.

After the Chengmai Campaign, though they hadn't captured Qiongzhou Prefecture City or Haikou Garrison, they had essentially achieved actual occupation of Qiongshan County. The finance sector then established the Qiongzhou Prefecture Supply Center there—specifically responsible for collecting and transshipping materials throughout Hainan. Military grain collected through "reasonable burden" around the prefecture city was submitted directly to the Qiongshan County Supply Center, tallied and registered directly at the port, then shipped to supply the expeditionary army in Guangzhou. This put local acquisitions to immediate use, improving efficiency and ensuring resource utilization. After the war, these supply centers quickly transformed into harbor treasuries. As the Executive Committee's financial, commercial, and business departments expanded, the requisition and warehousing of materials from taxation, industry, commerce, monopoly, customs, agriculture—all departments' materials—went through these harbor treasuries. Because Ai Zhixin had managed the Qiongzhou harbor treasury, he was also assigned to establish harbor treasuries in other locations. This established the Australian Song's most basic national treasury system, with each harbor treasury staffed by several naturalized citizen clerks handling disbursement and receipt, and a basic accounting system.

Although material allocation was mainly managed by the Planning Commission, the actual disbursement was still handled by the Finance sector's harbor treasuries.

Guangzhou's harbor treasury was located inside Da Shijie, in the "Inner World" near the docks, where rows of warehouses stood. Along the outer row of warehouses, a line of offices housed the harbor treasury administration.

Harbor treasury work was always bustling. Messengers carrying communication satchels from various local agencies came and went, bringing correspondence about material flows from various locations. Every hour, the communication center's messenger would deliver the latest data changes from the Planning Commission and Delong's branches in various locations.

At wooden counters, cashiers collected material requisition slips or warehouse receipt slips from relevant departments and directed the appropriate warehouses or ships to release or deposit materials. They then logged the time, slip number, and material items onto a rolling blackboard for public announcement. Copyists seeing the blackboard announcements would transcribe them to ledgers, while telegraph operators simultaneously transmitted the important portions of the ledger entries to the Finance Province and Planning Commission in Lingao, who were responsible for bookkeeping. When certain inventory items approached set thresholds, or when a warehouse would run short before the Transportation Department's next scheduled transfer, they would notify the Commerce Department, Industry Department, or nearby transfer warehouses to ship supplementary supplies.

Ai Zhixin didn't go directly to the harbor treasury office but headed straight for the warehouse area at the "Inner World" dock.

Because today was inventory day, there was currently no incoming or outgoing business at the warehouse area. The usual bustle of horse carts, hand carts, and porters was completely absent. All warehouse doors were tightly closed and the docks were deserted—only the footsteps of patrolling National Army soldiers occasionally broke the silence. In fact, each warehouse had personnel inside tallying inventory.

Ai Zhixin glanced at his wristwatch—there was still plenty of time before it ended. Naturally he wouldn't personally go into the warehouses to count inventory, but every inventory day he would be present, and sometimes would conduct surprise inspections of specific warehouses or items. Any work eventually has a day of "fatigue," and signs of going through the motions and doing perfunctory work had already been faintly appearing even before the Two Guangs Campaign. Due to issues with cadre capability and numbers, the Executive Committee's administrative system was actually quite weak. If the transmigrators themselves couldn't personally be on the front lines—or at least appear as if they might show up at the front lines at any moment—many things in execution would go awry.

"Old Liu!"

He called out, and Liu Gang, who had been following alongside, immediately quickened his pace to approach.

"Your Excellency..."

"You go to the salt warehouse first and see how the salt inventory is going," Ai Zhixin said. "A new batch of salt arrived yesterday. Go check whether the salt matches the tickets."

With the Executive Committee controlling Hainan and Guangdong, all the Ming Dynasty's salt fields in Guangdong and Hainan were now under the Executive Committee's control. However, for the time being they couldn't effectively control salt field production, nor could they deploy enough qualified naturalized citizen cadres to manage the salt fields, so they could only strictly control checkpoints in the circulation domain to ensure the salt monopoly system was implemented.

There were countless tricks for embezzlement in the salt business, and salt workers weren't naive little rabbits either. The various private salt merchants wouldn't simply hand over their existing profits—whether it was the Great Song, Great Yuan, Great Ming, or the Australians, those who dared to sell contraband salt throughout the ages were all prepared to lick blood from knife blades.

Liu Gang came from a private salt merchant background and knew these tricks well. This was precisely why Ai Zhixin was willing to recruit him into the Monopoly Bureau's Salt Affairs Company.

"Yes, Your Excellency!"

Liu Gang left with his people. To support the new currency issuance, maintaining price stability and ensuring supply of important livelihood materials had been repeatedly mentioned at economic work conferences. So Ai Zhixin's salt monopoly policy was to stabilize market prices by fully supplying the market with low-priced salt. First, ensure market salt supply; second, drive out private salt; stabilize the market first, then gradually raise prices.

However, this was easier said than done. Liu Gang's former partners weren't being honest—taking advantage of the Executive Committee releasing low-priced salt, they were stockpiling in large quantities. So except in areas where the Executive Committee's commercial circulation could directly reach and salt prices had dropped, salt prices in the vast rural areas remained relatively high.

Ai Zhixin lit a cigar—it seemed that without a state-owned commercial network, effective regulation was impossible. The released materials were all being hoarded by devious merchants.

Busy time always passes quickly. Throughout the morning, Ai Zhixin not only conducted random spot checks on multiple warehouses but also reviewed numerous accounting ledgers and original vouchers. He signed a large stack of documents and met with several naturalized citizens. By the time he finally stopped to eat the bento Ai Yixin had brought, it was already past 2 PM. As he sat eating, through the window he suddenly saw the "scheduled ship arrival" signal flag being raised from the harbor's observation tower.

The arrival time of most of the Executive Committee's steam-sail hybrid transport ships couldn't be pinpointed to exact hours—they could only approximately know whether a ship would arrive in the morning, afternoon, or evening of a given day.
