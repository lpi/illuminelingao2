# Chapter 1944 - Primitive Relay

"Feng Shan, come and continue calculating the designs for the suction and rotary schemes."

Feng Nuo had now turned into an electrician again, beginning to arduously review electrical formulas. Based on the principle of starting everything simple and also due to power supply considerations, he chose to trial-produce the simplest DC relay first. However, after all, it wasn't his major. The little bit of circuit and university physics courses he learned in his freshman year had long been returned to the teacher, let alone high school stuff.

Xiu Yuxuan provided him with some texts of trial production materials he worked on back then, as well as some scrapped trial samples. It could be seen that Chief Engineer Xiu's understanding of relays was not much better than his own.

For the past two days, Feng Nuo pondered the relationship between relay suction force, power supply, and coil parameters all day long. The progress could be described as struggling. Feng Nuo flipped through many books on relays; books discussing this formula were few and very brief. He could only rely on figuring it out himself.

Relays in the original timeline only needed to control the working circuit and didn't care much about the suction magnitude; whereas he was using the suction force of the relay to drive a mechanical structure. From this perspective, what he was building wasn't a relay at all, just a simple electromagnet.

Feng Nuo was a bit frustrated by his new discovery, and the long calculation made his brain hurt, so he pushed a pile of scratch paper in front of Feng Shan and instructed, "First verify what I calculated before, then continue designing. There are a few key points."

"First, base it on our self-made 0.3mm diameter enameled wire. Don't forget to ask Jianai to send enameled wire samples to the Central Laboratory later to measure the lacquer layer thickness;"

"Okay, no problem, Teacher." Feng Shan replied, taking a notepad and pencil, and started recording key points.

"Second, limit the total power. First consider the contact time for each hole checking to be 0.1s. At least ensure Chief Zhong's 24V/20,000mAh battery can support checking 20,000 cards, preferably more than 50,000 cards."

According to Feng Nuo's rough estimate, if 50,000 cards were to be checked, calculating based on the usual situation of 160 holes per card, the power supply connection time would be over 200 hours. The power of each coil would have to be maintained at about 2 watts. Under this condition, ensuring the suction force wasn't too small wasn't very easy.

"Okay."

"Third, the suction force should preferably be above 5 Newtons."

Existing mechanical materials probably couldn't guarantee a very light mechanical control mechanism. Too small a suction force might be difficult to drive.

"Okay."

"Hmm... If there's extra energy, consider the influence of temperature rise and magnetic leakage on the coil. I haven't considered this part now; it's fine to experiment slowly later."

"Mhm."

"Oh, also, many materials say that to reduce the influence of remanence, a copper or brass pin or shim should be added to the top of the armature. Don't forget to count the thickness in."

"..."

"Unlike theoretical scientific research, the most critical thing in applied technology development is to be based on existing conditions. With these constraints, we can move towards solving the problem, rather than engaging in aimless empty talk. As long as the path is open, problems such as slow speed, low efficiency, poor quality, and high energy consumption can be conquered one by one by concentrating forces."

After Feng Nuo threw out this pile of headache-inducing problems, he sounded off a grand theory—of course, this was also speaking from experience. Feng Nuo was considered a Problem Solver in laboratories in the original timeline. After speaking, he walked to the bed in the corner of the workshop and fell headlong onto it. Feng Shan was used to Feng Nuo's long-windedness and exhortations; she silently took over that pile of messy scratch paper and began to look through it.

Feng Nuo was very tired, but felt his spirit was still very excited. He tried hard to stop his thinking and empty his brain to rest. It was dinner time now. Qian Yuzhi and Li Jianai had both gone to the canteen, and would bring back boxed meals incidentally. The faint roar of servers from next door, the rustling sound of Feng Shan calculating and writing in the room, and the occasional chant and metal clashing sound from the distant machinery factory workshop slowly relaxed his tense nerves. Feng Nuo liked this feeling very much. Gradually, these sounds drifted further and further away from him... Unknown when, he had fallen asleep.

...

When he woke up, it was completely dark outside. Only a small lamp on the workbench was lit in the room. Feng Shan was reading a book by the dim light. On the table beside her lay a small stack of neat white paper filled with neat and standardized formulas and derivations—she had completed the design plan.

Feng Nuo walked over, picked up the plan, and read it once. He felt there were no problems. He estimated that the copper usage of this plan was not small, and the iron core material also needed further processing. Fortunately, Qian Yuzhi was ready labor—his trade was a mechanic.

In the following days, Feng Nuo applied for machine tool machining hours from the machinery factory and had Qian Yuzhi assign the silicon steel material into the shapes and sizes in the designed suction/rotary schemes. Some more complex work was done by old workers. He also personally led Qian Yuzhi and Feng Shan to operate the winding machine and made a few samples.

The size of the sample was about a circle larger than an adult's fist, which was acceptable in this era where industrial products were generally silly, big, black, and rough. Powering on to test, the suction force was smaller than the theoretical value, and the coil temperature rise was more obvious. Although in the application of the punch card machine, the relay was powered intermittently, the possibility of a certain hole position being punched for many consecutive cards could not be ruled out. It seemed that although this troublesome punch card computer had no electronic components, cooling problems also had to be considered. Since there was no motor, air cooling was hopeless. Did it need water cooling? Using copper pipes to circulate water for heat dissipation would involve considering the sealing and sorting of pipelines—Feng Nuo didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

But this could be counted as a success. Feng Nuo was in a very good mood. He wrote a report to the Planning Agency requesting more raw materials to produce one hundred each of rotary and suction relays first.

Then, he called the Standard Parts Factory and asked when they would finally have thinner copper wire. Although his relays here mainly drove mechanical structures, there were also a small number of relays used to control other relays. The suction force of this type of relay was not important; lower power consumption was better. If he didn't want to greatly increase the coil length of the relay, he could only use thinner copper wire to increase resistance and reduce current, incidentally reducing the weight and volume of the relay.

The answer from the Standard Parts Factory was "under testing." As for progress, it was "currently unclear," but "progress is great."

"Let's designate this as Model B." Thinking of this, Feng Nuo made a note in the memorandum. Next was organizing the manufacturing process to submit to the Planning Agency for archiving. He also had to find Senators from the Ministry of Science and Technology and the electrical department to meet and discuss the naming and finalizing of relays and even various future electronic components. Working in the Planning Agency for a long time, he was sensitive to such matters, and it was also one of his duties—there weren't many IT Senators serving in the Planning Agency anymore.

Hearing that Feng Nuo had come up with a completely current-timeline version of the relay, many Senators came "attracted by the reputation." Their intentions were nothing more than asking Feng Nuo to strike while the iron was hot and continue to develop more models of relays for different needs. When it wasn't done, it seemed this thing wasn't indispensable, but once it was done, demands sprang up like bamboo shoots after rain. Some asked him to develop AC relays, some asked for overload/underload protection relays, some for time-delay relays, and some even asked for thermal relays and photo relays.

"This has nothing to do with the electromagnetic relay I'm working on now, okay!" Feng Nuo roasted in his heart while having to find other excuses to coax away a Senator who patted his chest saying he would operate in the Senate to set up a dedicated electronic equipment factory for him. He naturally hadn't forgotten that the main direction right now wasn't relay development at all, but to finish the tabulating machine quickly.

"It seems electronic equipment development is also a vast world with great potential." Feng Nuo secretly regretted that he definitely couldn't compare with the electrical department Senators in this aspect. Currently, these guys had no time, allowing him to take the lead. Once they reacted, it would be impossible for him to rely on his foundation to snatch food from their turf. It was more reliable to honestly work on computers.

"But cooperation is possible. In the future when they have electron tubes and transistors, they can't just build radios, TVs, and radars; electronic computers are a matter of time. At that time, my current layout will show its power. No one can bypass me to build electronic computers." Feng Nuo thought while unconsciously smiling, causing Li Jianai, who had just entered the workshop, to look at him several times. Feng Shan, on the other hand, was long used to her own Chief wandering off in broad daylight from time to time and turned a blind eye to it.

Among the few people, Li Jianai entered the workshop last. She understood neither mechanics nor electricity, let alone computer theory; but she seemed naturally suited for this line of work. Being influenced every day, she actually basically understood the working mechanism of relays, even better than Qian Yuzhi. Feng Nuo let her assist Feng Shan, responsible for trial-producing several other models of relays. This raised her status in the workshop above Qian Yuzhi. Every day she either ordered him to get raw materials or turn workpieces. Watching the teenager being busily commanded by her, she felt inexplicably happy.

Since coming to help Feng Nuo, Li Jianai felt her long-suppressed spirit had eased a lot. Compared with Chief Dugu and Chief Lu, Chief Feng was very approachable. Senior Sister Feng Shan was a bit taciturn but also very gentle and friendly, plus there was a goofy Qian Yuzhi.

Thinking back, she had never had such relaxing days since she was born. Memories of childhood were naturally blurry, but nothing more than the words cold and hungry; starting from the quarantine camp, she was a screw of the "organization," and the "organization" had no warmth to speak of; the atmosphere among the students of the Maid School wasn't good to begin with, let alone she was a "hidden personnel," always separated from others by a layer emotionally; as for after graduation assignment, she encountered such an experience...
