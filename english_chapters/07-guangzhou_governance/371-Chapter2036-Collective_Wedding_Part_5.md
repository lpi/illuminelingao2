# Chapter 2036 - Collective Wedding (Part 5)

"What harvest?" Wang Jun asked curiously.

"This harvest means nothing to you, but Daoist Cui..." He pouted towards Cui Hantang, "He's going to be overjoyed."

Saying this, Wang Jun's interest was piqued. Just as he wanted to ask further, the sound of firecrackers became more and more dense. The observation post at the gate sent a signal: The new couples were entering.

Seeing this signal, Wen Desi was the first to stand up and began to applaud. This action caught everyone off guard. So the group of Elders hurriedly stood up and applauded along. The naturalized citizens and indigenous representatives in the venue all followed suit, and for a time thunderous applause rang out. The loudspeakers began to play the *Unity and Friendship March*. Staff arranged long ago threw large bags of colored paper confetti into the wind from the Bell Tower and the roof of the Great World. The colored confetti danced like snowflakes, mixed with candies. Children jumped for joy, grabbing at the drifting colored paper and candies. Inside and outside the venue was a scene of jubilation.

The new couples entered under the gaze of thousands. This was probably the most glorious moment of their lives.

The onlookers were boiling over—when had they ever seen such a dreamlike scene? Even the well-traveled gentry and wealthy households were awed by the spectacular scene created by this wedding company. More than one person sighed secretly in their hearts: "Too extravagant!"

For Fang Fei, this bit of spectacle really wasn't enough to look at—he still despised the facade of the Great World for being too rustic, not "magnificent" or "gorgeous" enough.

Li Suiqiu was currently watching the wedding scene silently from not far away. The Great World was actually not far from his family's villa outside the Great East Gate. Moreover, there was now a small train. Last night he stayed at the villa, then sent a few servants to occupy a viewing spot outside the Great World.

He naturally knew that as long as he opened his mouth to Cui Hantang, there would naturally be a seat for him in the "VIP Area" inside. Those local bigshots who had thrown in their lot with the Australians were now sitting upright on hard wooden benches, beaming one by one as if sitting in the clouds—among these people were quite a few of his old acquaintances, also old families of Guangzhou; some families still had relatives serving as officials in the Ming state, yet at this moment they all wore the faces of the new nobility following the dragon.

Indeed, the words "Fame" and "Profit" were the most eroding to human hearts in this world! Since meeting with Cui Hantang, Li Suiqiu had been even more hesitant and uneasy. Cui Hantang's words had actually moved him quite a bit: the strife and unrest in this world were nothing more than the common people being too poor and bitter. He had read history books thoroughly and knew that changes of dynasties were mostly caused by land mergers. The Great Ming today was also like this; the people were in dire straits and could only take risks—even without the Hair thieves, the Great Ming was now in imminent danger.

If the Australians really had the ability to "increase productive forces" as this Daoist Cui said, wouldn't this thousands-of-years cycle of "Destruction—Establishment" be broken? Living and working in peace and contentment would no longer be a dream.

However, thinking again, he felt what Daoist Cui said was a bit too mysterious. Where in the world was there such a thing as touching stone to turn it into gold? Even if they had some secret methods to increase land yields, that would be very limited. How could it benefit the whole world, let alone that land is something natural, it couldn't be created out of thin air, right?

Li Suiqiu had been distressed about this matter for a long time. He realized he had walked into a dilemma. Loyalty to the Great Ming originally had nothing to doubt; however, the Australians' performance after arriving in Guangzhou and their reputation in Qiongzhou in the past made him realize that perhaps the Australians had various faults, and perhaps they liked to brag and deceive, but at least right now the common people were receiving their benefits, happily serving as "obedient subjects of the Great Song." And the Great Ming he wanted to be loyal to had no attraction for the common people. Come to think of it: he, Li Suiqiu, had received "National Grace," but what benefits had the common people received?

Just as he was hesitating over these matters, news of the collective wedding was passed to his eyes through newspapers again. He had to admire the Australians' idea of running newspapers. Whether you were willing or not, whether you approved or not, as long as you didn't want to be uninformed, you had to endure the endless tide of news. And this information would modify a person's views silently—Li Suiqiu had already experienced this. From the initial "Han and thieves cannot coexist" when they entered the city, to "The Hair thieves' governance also has redeemable points," and then to the recent "Australians winning the hearts of the people"... Li Suiqiu himself realized this transformation was far more powerful than Daoist Cui's chatter and piling up of nouns.

The collective wedding before his eyes was the same. Li Suiqiu's perception of this was no different from Song Yingsheng's: A good thing, but making a mountain out of a molehill. But reading the special reports for several days, he also had quite a few feelings. In the end, he actually decided to come out and watch the excitement.

Once watching this excitement, he secretly regretted it—this was too noisy and unbearable. The position he occupied was very close to the Great World Plaza, an excellent location, but the Australians didn't allow big households to build sheds, nor could they set up tables and chairs. Li Suiqiu could only stand and watch. This was fine, but since sheds couldn't be built, naturally outsiders couldn't be kept out. There were extremely many onlookers around, squeezing him so he couldn't move. Even though seven or eight servants protected him from the side to avoid the suffering of being squeezed, and someone shaded him and fanned him, this fullness of sweat stench and heat still steamed him unbearably.

Finally persisting until the newcomers entered, this spectacle made Li Suiqiu shake his head secretly: truly holding the Tai'e sword by the blade! Treating such pawns, hundred-craft workers, prostitutes, and actors with such preferential treatment was truly not the bearing a new dynasty should have. The Australians treating status and hierarchy so lightly, fear it would be hard to achieve great deeds.

Amidst his random thoughts, he suddenly saw an acquaintance: it was Zhang Jiayu. Just about to call him, he saw the figure flash and disappear again.

Just wanting to look again, suddenly music played loudly in the venue. A high-pitched male voice echoed over the plaza:

"Inviting the Elder, District Chief of Guangdong Region, Wen Desi, to bear witness to the wedding for the new couples!"

Under Fang Fei's hosting, Wen Desi walked down from the rostrum, standing beamingly behind the witness stand. A simple witness ceremony was already prepared here. The Morning Star Flag and the Senate Flag shone together. On the big red woolen tablecloth embroidered with the golden "Gear, Wheat, Holy Ship, Iron Fist" emblem, besides fresh flowers, a thick leather-bound *Civil Code* was placed—of course, just a hollow model.

The Council of Elders acting as witness, issuing marriage certificates. This was a system implemented since the "Red and White Council" in Lingao. Its purpose was nothing more than to promote the modern marriage system and establish the concept that "marriage is a legal relationship."

Naturally, except for the early period, few Elders had time to witness weddings for naturalized citizens or indigenous people. Most of the time, the witness was just a petty clerk. But the solemnity of the witness ceremony had always been repeatedly emphasized by the Civil Affairs Department. Sometimes there would be surprise inspections.

Wen Desi had witnessed quite a few times. For one, he had always been the "Head" of the Council of Elders; his attendance not only showed "importance" but also gave the newcomers and families "face." Secondly, his name had a good omen. This time could be considered familiar usage.

Wen Desi wore a smile, waving frequently to pay respects to the newcomers, guests, and onlookers. When the music paused slightly, he leaned into the microphone:

"Comrades, friends, broad citizens, hello!

"The ancients said: Life has four great joys: Sweet rain after a long drought, meeting an old friend in a foreign land, the wedding night, and seeing one's name on the golden list. Today, the new couples here are tying the knot of Qin and Jin forever. As the witness, I want to say a few words from the bottom of my heart to the new couples.

"New couples who can come to this Great World Plaza today to tie the knot. I wish you hearts united forever. Love each other at the beginning of marriage, respect each other like guests after marriage, teach children together after having them, and moisten each other with foam [help each other in humble circumstances] when old.

"On this day of great joy, I also ask you never to forget the past. The newcomers who came to the collective wedding site today, each probably has endless bitterness and endless sorrow in their hearts. Today's good times did not come easily. I think the relatives you miss, whether they are still in this world or not, if they could see your appearance today, they would definitely feel gratified and sincerely happy for you."

Low sobbing sounds arose from the queue of newcomers. Fang Fei was somewhat anxious in his heart. The propaganda effect of Chief Wen's speech was naturally not bad, but these newcomers each had a painfully tragic history in their hearts; a few sentences could trigger immense resonance. If Chief Wen really made the newcomers howl and cry collectively, it would inevitably spoil the scenery, and maybe be used by "ulteriorly motivated" people. He hurriedly winked at Wen Desi repeatedly.

Wen Desi smiled and nodded, continuing:

"...The hardships and destitution of the first half of life, struggling in the dark quagmire, finally welcomed today's dawn, living a happy life. The more in these beautiful times, the more you cannot forget the hardships of the past, cannot forget how you walked here step by step—forgetting the past is equivalent to betraying the future.

"The Council of Elders and I personally sincerely wish you a happy life and a perfect marriage.

"Serve the Council of Elders and the People!"

As soon as Wen Desi's voice fell, warm applause rang out in the whole arena. This applause was like waves, quickly transmitting out from the center of the Great World Plaza, wave after wave. The entire surrounding area rippled. As someone shouted slogans like "Serve the Council of Elders and the People" and "Long Live the Council of Elders," the applause was like thunder, unable to stop for a long time.

Fang Fei held the host script, wanting to speak several times, yet every time he approached the microphone, he was blocked by this enthusiastic applause. He smiled somewhat helplessly and also clapped his hands along.

After a good while, the applause gradually subsided. Only then did he lean close to the microphone and say loudly:

"Two surnames allied, a contract in one hall, a good union forever tied, a match of equal claim. Seeing the peach blossoms burning bright this day, suitable for chamber and home; predicting melons and vines growing endlessly in other years, prosperous and flourishing. Respectfully with the pledge of white heads, written on scarlet paper; good to place the alliance of red leaves, clearly recorded in the Mandarin Duck Registry. Inviting the Elder, District Chief of Guangdong Region, Comrade Wen Desi to issue marriage certificates to the new couples!"
