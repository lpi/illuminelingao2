# Chapter 2055 - Act Quickly

Wang Qiyi's head was spinning. Wu Mu had probably already dispatched people to Hong Kong. When you connected all the information, even he could see that the Shi family wasn't just a problem—it was a major, major problem.

He suddenly realized that this case involved multiple parties, all of whom actually had jurisdiction. Especially once the case touched on "anti-Executive Committee activities"—if Political Security found any substantive evidence, they could take over the whole thing, leaving his side as mere "co-investigators."

It wouldn't do to have put in all that effort only to have others claim the credit. Wang Qiyi—

Never mind how serious Smith's crimes actually were. Strike first and gain the upper hand. Even if this fellow truly was part of the network, the Tax Bureau should be the ones to arrest him first. Thinking this through, Wang Qiyi turned to Yao Yulan and asked, "Anything else?"

"That's essentially everything. The Police Bureau is also investigating the counterfeit currency, but Inspector Lian isn't in charge of that area, so she's not clear on the progress."

"Mm, understood. Thank you for your work, Team Leader Yao." Wang Qiyi then looked at Chu Xiaoran and Xu Zhewei. "How did your visit to the Shi family go? Did you see Smith?"

Xu Zhewei glanced at Chu Xiaoran. Seeing her gesture for him to speak, he responded energetically: "Report, Director Wang. The Shi family was very cooperative. We met Smith and conveyed the officials' message. He expressed great honor at the Executive Committee's recognition and said he would definitely participate actively in the training. He asked several policy questions, which Sister Chu answered for him."

"Nothing else?" Wang Qiyi asked, seeing Xu Zhewei stop.

"Nothing else."

Pretty steady, Young Master Shi, Wang Qiyi thought. But soon you'll learn what it means for disaster to fall from the sky while sitting at home. He mentally calculated how long it would take Wu Mu's people to make the round trip from Hong Kong, then reviewed his own situation.

"Alright, I'm assigning tasks now. Xu Zhewei, go get all the materials on the Shi family—the old store's, the Sanya store's, the Hong Kong warehouse's. Everything we currently have at the bureau. Bring it all here. We're working centrally. Everyone must have complete mastery of this. We only have twenty-four hours!"

"Director Wang, are we doing a full investigation of the Shi family?" Huang Ping's mind worked fast. Hearing Wang Qiyi mention twenty-four hours, he immediately knew leadership wanted an arrest—and he'd be called into action again. He looked quite excited.

"Yes, just because the Shi family hid deep doesn't mean our Tax Bureau has no means. We're going to fight a beautiful battle and not let others steal our thunder." Wang Qiyi rallied the troops.

"So... Director Wang, do you think the Shi family has big problems?" Chu Xiaoran's question made Wang Qiyi frown. This wasn't really a question you should be asking me. But he didn't take it to heart, waving his hand: "The Shi family's problems are huge—hanging a few from lampposts wouldn't be unjust. Did you forget what Director Ai said when the task force was established? Guangzhou is the Executive Committee's domain. Go investigate thoroughly, investigate hard. What, feeling sorry for them?"

"Hahaha, how could that be?" The room erupted in laughter. "Director Wang, we guarantee we'll complete the mission!"

"Good!" Wang Qiyi nodded firmly. "That's the spirit I want. Xiao Hu, go get coffee to perk everyone up. We'll..." He was about to say "pull an all-nighter" but swallowed the words.

Seeing Chu Xiaoran's sallow complexion, Zeng Juan and Huang Ping's haggard faces—Yao Yulan still looked relatively normal, but she'd also been up all night—he changed course: "Let's aim to go through the case again this afternoon, get a good night's sleep, and hit it hard tomorrow!"

In the early morning, Guangzhou's horizon was just showing the first hints of fish-belly white dawn. Early-rising citizens were only beginning to wash up. The whole city seemed still immersed in last night's dreams, quiet and tranquil.

Through the thin mist, the sound of wheels and hooves suddenly broke the stillness. Several carriages with dark blue lacquered exteriors emerged from the fog, pulling up before a vermilion gate with a coachman's low "whoa." Before the carriages had even stopped, the doors opened and strapping men jumped out one after another, lips pressed tight, expressions solemn. They wore full-coverage steel helmets, dark blue uniforms matching the carriage color, black tactical vests, and military boots. The metallic clinking as they ran made clear their armament extended well beyond the "six-shot revolvers" in their hands.

No warnings, no announcements. The men dispersed immediately, taking up assault positions. Then the vermilion gate crashed down under the battering ram's blows, and the ready team poured through into the compound. Their urgent footsteps woke the household. Screams and cries erupted in chaos.

"Great Song Executive Committee Economic Major Cases Investigation Division!" Yao Yulan and Huang Ping, pistols in right hands and credentials displayed in left, each led an elite squad charging through the crowd toward the rear courtyard. The bright white characters "PAYING TAXES IS GLORIOUS" on the backs of their tactical vests gleamed brilliantly in the morning sun.

Moments later, Wang Qiyi stepped unhurriedly over the threshold, Glock in hand, and stood on the steps surveying the Shi family members huddled in the front courtyard: "Investigation Division operation! Men to the left! Women to the right! Ladyboys in the middle!"

...

Ahem... Director Wang's dreams were always this full of domineering charisma. Of course, it was only a dream. Last night, Director Zhang had strictly ordered him to stay put as commander, to give the young people opportunities to train, to learn to delegate.

Shaking his groggy head, Wang Qiyi savored the pleasant dream once more. Hmm... maybe "PAYING TAXES IS GLORIOUS" shouldn't be on the vest backs—the Major Cases Investigation Division's authority wasn't limited to taxation... How about "ECONOMIC GUARDIANS"? Feeling he'd debugged an issue, Wang Qiyi licked his lips in satisfaction, then remembered those four characters had been used by the domestic economic police back in the day. Come to think of it, they darkly aligned with the Investigation Bureau's mission.

Yao Yulan and Huang Ping stood before the desk, fully equipped and ready to go. "Alright, I won't waste words. It's now five minutes to six." Wang Qiyi checked his watch. "You must arrive at the Shi residence to make the arrest by six-thirty. Political Security and Police are already on their way to assist... Go!"

Last night, Wang Qiyi had thought it over and decided to call both Mu Min and Wu Mu. Arresting one Young Master Shi with just two people from the Economic Major Cases Investigation Bureau might be risky. As an Elder, he could bypass Political Security and Police to coordinate directly with the National Army for assistance, but that would look rather unseemly. Turnabout was fair play—Wu Mu had called him during the last arrest, so if only for face, he couldn't not notify the other two this time. Besides, all three agencies had met at the municipal government meeting. There had to be mutual benefit; post-operation summaries needed phrases like "provided full cooperation" and "worked in close coordination."

After giving his instructions, Wang Qiyi tried to stand up to see them off, but when he pushed himself up, he couldn't rise.

"Director Wang, are you alright?" Huang Ping nimbly stepped forward, reaching out to support him.

"I'm fine. Time is of the essence—go. Stay safe, and let their people handle the dangerous parts first." Wang Qiyi waved them off and awkwardly sat back down.

Watching the two close the door behind them, Wang Qiyi grabbed his cup and gulped down strong tea, let out a long breath, then slowly pushed himself up from the table.

After stretching his back, he drank down the "Kidney Restoration Elixir" specially supplied by Runshi Hall, then paced slowly around the office, wondering whether to stop by Ai Zhixin's office once working hours began. By Executive Committee standards, with everyone being Elders and him senior to Ai Zhixin, he shouldn't need this "morning report, evening briefing" routine. But ever since he'd noticed the vague hostility between his wife and Ai Zhixin, Wang Qiyi felt he should stroke the ego of this colleague who outranked him by half a level. Ai Zhixin was capable and driven, and the Tax Bureau's smooth operations on all fronts owed much to his skilled coordination. Plus, he responded well to flattery. Whether professionally or personally, positioning himself properly as "Deputy" Director was the best choice.

Lost in thought, Wang Qiyi was suddenly seized by an inexplicable chill, and his eyelid began twitching incessantly. Damn, was it the right eye for disaster or fortune? He tidied up his desk as the work whistle sounded. Wang Qiyi picked up the case progress summary he'd written last night, skimmed it again, and seeing no major issues, tucked it into his notebook and prepared to find Ai Zhixin. Just then came a knock.

"Report!"

"Come in."

Seeing Nan Wan'er lead in a visibly anxious Liu Cuihua, Wang Qiyi tensed. Please don't let there be a "fatal incident" at the girls' dormitory.

The Tax Bureau had many young women, making it a place the naturalized male cadres constantly eyed. Back when this group of girls was still preparing to leave Lingao, Ai Zhixin had thoughtfully found two "dormitory matrons" and even drawn up a formal dormitory "self-governance" system with a five-person management group that rotated every six months. If Wang Qiyi remembered correctly, the current group leader was this Liu Cuihua.

"..."

"Director Wang, there's something we need to report to you," Nan Wan'er said, seeing Liu Cuihua hang her head, too frightened to speak. "Chu Xiaoran from Dorm 203 on the second floor requested leave to go out last night and hasn't returned on time this morning."

"Mm." Wang Qiyi hummed absently. He knew why Liu Cuihua was afraid to speak. According to Ai Zhixin's self-governance rules, the group leader was responsible for doing a headcount every night when the dormitory locked up at eleven, and reporting the results and any personnel on leave to the municipal bureau's duty office. Clearly, Liu Cuihua had not done so.
