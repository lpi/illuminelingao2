# Chapter 1720 - Call to Arms

Huang Bingkun hesitated. The Huang family had always passed down "farming and studying," boasting of a legacy of poetry and etiquette, and was most upright and rigidly moralistic. They never allowed their children to set foot in places like brothels.

Just as he was hesitating, Wu Ming pushed him from behind: "Quick, it's not suitable to stay on the street for long!"

Huang Bingkun thought this could be considered acting expediently in an emergency. The two slipped into the courtyard. Behind them, the tortoise slave closed the back door and bolted it, whispering: "Two masters, please follow this small one."

Huang Bingkun had originally thought that this professional establishment would be a forest of meat and a pool of wine, full of debauchery. Unexpectedly, this was a quiet, secluded courtyard. He followed the tortoise slave all the way forward and saw a unique world here, with sparsely spaced flowers and trees, a deep courtyard that was actually very quiet and elegant.

He couldn't help but feel secretly ashamed: his own knowledge was truly meager!

The Fangchun Courtyard was a large establishment in Guangzhou City. High-level establishments in the Ming Dynasty were not simply brothels but actually comprehensive complexes combining dining, entertainment, and fashion centers. Not only were there courtesans, helpers, and musicians, but also a large group of service personnel such as tailors, jewelry craftsmen, chefs, and so on. Wealthy people stayed here for leisure more often not out of the need for "sex"—every one of them had delicate wives and beautiful concubines at home—but closer in nature to modern private clubs.

Young Master Lin had patronized a courtesan here. He often came for romantic outings and banquets. He was a great patron, and he also met guests and discussed confidential matters here.

The tortoise slave took them to the entrance of a small courtyard and left. A maid welcomed them in. A table of fruits and snacks had already been set up in the central hall. Quite a few people had arrived. Huang Bingkun glanced around and saw that besides acquaintances from the Yuyuan Society, there were also a few unfamiliar faces. Young Master Liang, however, was not among them—probably because of his noble status, it was inconvenient for him to come out in such chaos.

Because most were acquaintances, they didn't exchange greetings one by one and sat down. Someone served tea. Everyone at the table was talking with fervor.

"The high means of the Australians—we probably don't need to discuss anymore. Just looking at the peace of this market, this Guangzhou City is undoubtedly the world of the Australians."

"This mountain of gold and silver that is Guangzhou—the Australians have probably coveted it for a long time!"

"Entering the city was also peaceful. I originally thought there would be a disaster of blood, fire, and blades." Someone seemed to be rejoicing. "It's rare that their military discipline can be so strict!"

"I heard that the Hair-shorn thieves treat their subordinates most generously, but the discipline is strict."

"Even the petty criminals in the city dare not move recklessly. The suppression is very effective. We people with families and properties are most afraid of market turmoil." The speaker seemed to have lingering fears. "When I came over just now, I saw a rack already erected at the intersection, with several bandits hanging on it—I heard they were all beggars who took advantage of the chaos to loot."

"Killed well! These scoundrels are used to extorting money in the market, and even scholars and gentry have been harassed by them for a long time."

"The Australians have always been unyielding. I only don't know what they will do next now that they have occupied Guangzhou."

"It would be good if they asked the Imperial Court for peace talks and amnesty."

"If they wanted amnesty, they could have been granted amnesty in Lingao. How can the Imperial Court let it go after they fought into the provincial capital like this!"

"I am only worried that the Imperial Court will gather a large army to suppress the rebellion. This flourishing City of Five Rams, I'm afraid, will be turned into flying ash!" Someone said worriedly.

These words resonated with everyone. Common people feared war the most. Once a siege battle occurred, the common people would be the unluckiest. At that time, let alone a small scholar like you, even the gentry masters couldn't avoid the fate of family destruction and death.

The siege of Guiyang during the She-An Rebellion was only a few years ago. Guiyang was besieged for several years. The grain in the city was exhausted, people ate each other, and even the daughters of officials were dragged away by the defenders to be cooked and eaten. The entire city almost turned into a ghost domain. Before the siege, besides the original soldiers and civilians, there were also refugees pouring in from everywhere, totaling hundreds of thousands of people. By the time the siege was lifted, only six hundred people survived.

The scholars and citizens of Guangzhou had also heard of this terrible news. Thinking that in case the Imperial Court's grand army came to encircle and suppress, wouldn't this Guangzhou become the second Guiyang? Everyone showed expressions of uneasiness.

"I think Brother is worrying too much," Wu Ming said. "Not to mention that the Imperial Court is currently stretched to the limit—whether it can gather troops to encircle and suppress is a question. Even if it can mobilize the grand army of several provinces, I don't think there is much chance of winning." He looked at the people present. "When Governor Wang encircled and suppressed Lingao, how many troops did the Australians have? Now the Australians have many more troops than at the beginning!"

"So, even if the Imperial Court wants to suppress, I'm afraid they can't fight to the foot of Guangzhou City."

Wu Ming nodded. "The Australians have strong soldiers and sturdy horses, combined with sturdy ships and sharp cannons. Even if the Imperial Court can send troops from several provinces to attack, I see the chance of winning is very slim!"

Huang Bingkun originally wanted to reprimand Wu Ming, asking "where did your stance go," but on second thought, what he said was completely reasonable. He knew better than Wu Ming how the military power of the Australians was. Expecting the weak official troops to defeat the Hair-shorn thieves in one fell swoop was probably like the sun rising from the west.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel secretly disheartened. At this time, he heard someone whisper: "That's good." Before he could think more, he heard someone say:

"Now that the Australians are advancing to take Guangzhou, the prefecture cities in the province will naturally be hard to protect. Our families and lives are all here, and from now on we can only let the Australians mold us as they please."

"Since we have to bow our heads under the eaves, we still have to befriend some Australian high officials to protect ourselves."

"Speaking of Australian high officials, I heard that Prime Minister Wen is the head, but we small people have no door to see him. Originally, it would be excellent to see Shopkeeper Guo, but that Gao Ju is hateful!"

"Brother Shi, speak cautiously! That person is hot right now, not someone you and I can discuss."

"Exactly. Maybe we will have to rely on Master Gao in the future."

Second Master Huang observed everyone's expressions carefully and found that no one showed a strange expression; instead, quite a few had secret joy on their faces. *These drifting and illicit people—could it be that they want to be rebels!*

His face became darker and darker. These people read the books of sages and received the grace of the monarch, but when things came to a head, what they thought and said was all about how to maneuver for self-preservation. Maybe they would even seek personal gain in the future and make a fortune under the hands of the Hair-shorn thieves!

He sneered and said with a hint of sarcasm: "Gentlemen, the martial arts of the Hair-shorn thieves are first-class in the world. So there is no need to worry too much about the disaster of war. I think the Imperial Court is definitely no match for them. Gentlemen can rest assured."

Many people's faces felt slightly hot, remembering that they still held titles like Xiucai or Jiansheng of the Great Ming. Then they heard him add:

"What is most worrisome for everyone is: how will the scholars conduct themselves?"

"Why does Brother Huang say this?"

"The Hair-shorn thieves always use the 'Fake Hair-shorn' they taught themselves. When employing Fake Hair-shorn, they love to use those from poor backgrounds and ignorant commoners. Where is there a place for us scholars?"

As soon as these words came out, there was an uproar. Everyone shook their heads, most with looks of disbelief. Someone said, "The Song Dynasty always shared the world with scholar-officials—we don't need to worry. Today he trusts the muddy-legged Fake Hair-shorn only because scholars still don't trust him, so he has to do so. If the Australians want to compete for the world, they must be courteous to the worthy and condescend to scholars, open the imperial examinations, and select famous scholars. The muddy-legged Fake Hair-shorn are merely an expedient measure."

As soon as this statement came out, it immediately received the approval of the majority.

Seeing that everyone didn't believe him, Second Master Huang smiled bitterly in secret and didn't say anything more. He had no confidence in these people to begin with, and now he just treated it as them talking to themselves.

While they were talking, a family servant hurriedly came in from outside and whispered a few words in Young Master Lin's ear. Lin Zunxiu's face changed, and the servant took out a paper scroll from his bosom and handed it over.

Young Master Lin unfolded the paper scroll and looked at it a few times, his face turning pale. Everyone asked anxiously: "What is it?" "Could it be the Australians' proclamation?" "What does it say?"

"This is a notice just posted on the street. The servant copied it." Lin Zunxiu said, handing the paper scroll to Young Master Shi.

"Denouncing Zhu..." Young Master Shi only read two words and dared not speak further. Everyone around was moved, presumably understanding what kind of document he was holding. Huang Bingkun hurriedly took it over and looked—sure enough, it was a treasonous manifesto.

**Manifesto Denouncing the Zhu Ming**

The Former Song was unfortunate, repeatedly suffering from Tartar captives. First meeting the Jingkang Incident, Wan-yan deceived the benevolence of Hui and Qin. Then encountering Yashan, the Meng Yuan bullied the young monarch and orphans. Alas, the Virtue of Song—though the community was far from the Central Plains, overseas migration preserved the ancestral temple still in Australia. The Yuan administration was without the Way, and heroes rose up. The black-headed commoners strove forward; the Hu barbarians had no luck of a hundred years. The Divine Land was recovered, and the Central Summer uniquely possessed a Sage Monarch.

As for Zhu Yuanzhang, the Taizu of Ming, he rose from the ranks of soldiers, setting his heart on the Divine Artifact. He murdered the Prince of Ming, killed colleagues; Youliang, Guozhen, Shicheng and others were all slaughtered. Expelling the Tartars was originally the common enterprise of the heroes of Central Summer. When the merit reached magnificence, how could it be the sole power of a single man from Huai West? Yuanzhang's administration—the tyranny all followed Hu customs. Strong and unreasonable, the rank odor of mutton was still in the central ridge. When the rabbits died, the dogs were cooked; Liu Ji and Song Lian lost their lives. When the birds were gone, the bow was hidden; Shanchang and Lanyu lost their lives. Those on the road of Longyou, none could endure it.

The founding of the False Dynasty was like this, and passed to the second generation it was even worse. The uncle seized the nephew's throne, having the nature of jackals and wolves. Being intimate with the eccentric and depraved, harming the loyal and good. Something god and man both hate, heaven and earth do not tolerate.

Reaching the middle period, it was even more absurd: The King loved border exploits, the Tiger Guard Division was lost at Tumu. Ministers hated communication with the sea, Japanese pirates poisoned the Southeast. Such various things cannot be fully counted. The people of the Central Country all turned their backs on virtue. Since Shenzong, the court administration has declined daily. Being close to the evil and far from the good, the innocent children are like grass and trees. A crowd of clowns are in power, the flesh-eaters are nothing but eunuchs. With the Single Whip Method, ten rooms have nine empty; the white silver has been collected, the people's spirit has declined. Yin and Yang are not in tune, parents fall on the roads; the five grains do not ripen, and the innocent children cry for food.

Until recently, the breath is gasping. With the Three Cases of the Inner Court, the harmony of the court and the wild is lost. The Wanggong Explosion—Heaven took away its Kingly Qi. Eunuchs confuse and create chaos; Wei the Eunuch can be called Thousand Years. Roving bandits run rampant; post soldiers may be called Chuang Wang. Internal worries and external troubles, precarious and imminent. Stirring up whale waves, the Red Barbarians breed in the sea. Iron horses and carved bows, the Jurchen are rampant at the border. Dragons and snakes rise from the land, the Purple Myrtle Star completely reveals killing intent. Chasing the deer and asking the tripod, the Zhu Ming's fate is exhausted!

This Dynasty originated in the Southern Wilderness, inheriting the business of the ancestors, looking north from the South Sea, with the ambition to pacify the people. Receiving the Grand Mandate of Heaven, widely opening the Imperial Foundation, here raising the Banner of Righteousness to clear away evil spirits. The Six Armies will pacify Southern Yue; Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang will reappear in the present. Returning to Qiongya from ten thousand li, it is expected that the carriages and books of the Four Seas will be unified.

Now distributing this Manifesto to the Two Capitals and Thirteen Provincial Administration Commissions and Four Hundred Prefectures:

**The Mandate of Heaven lies with Song; the date of Ming's demise can be counted! The Heavenly Army will arrive—officials and people should look out for themselves!**

*Do not say that you were not warned in advance!*
