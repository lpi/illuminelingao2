# Chapter 1885 - Plague War (Part 4)

## Plague War (Part 4)

Liu Deshan was so frightened he jumped. He had never seen an Elder so furious. He fell to his knees with a thud, his voice trembling: "This humble one deserves death! It was all because I was greedy for a few coins..."

Lin Motian thought of how Guangzhou's plague might well have been brought in by this merchant's smuggled furs, and his anger flared: "You fool! Your death wouldn't be enough to pay for it! You're about to drag down the entire population of Guangzhou to die with you!"

Liu Deshan's whole body shook like chaff. Though he didn't quite understand what was happening, it was clear that privately trading furs had violated a major taboo of the Elders' Council.

Lin Motian had no patience to keep haggling with him. He instructed a health police officer to interrogate him: Which merchants and individuals had he sold the imported furs to? Who had he been in contact with recently...

"Get every last detail out of him," Lin Motian said viciously. "If he's not cooperative, bring a few veterans from the Interrogation Section for thorough torture! Don't miss a single word!"

With that, he left the kneeling, begging Liu Deshan behind and strode out of the interrogation room, ordering the Epidemic Prevention Battalion to immediately send people to the harbor to impound the Dongshan Ju vessel.

"Tow the ship to the quarantine anchorage at Changzhou Island. Personnel on board go to the isolation camp on the island. Don't touch anything on the ship."

"Yes!"

"Catch a few rats from the ship—dead or alive are both fine. Make sure to do proper isolation and disinfection work!"

Since private fur buyers were mainly European merchants, and by regulation, foreign merchants couldn't trade in Guangzhou but only in Hong Kong, they couldn't possibly have bought uninspected furs. The leak mainly came from Macau. The Portuguese in Macau had long-standing, intricate relationships with Guangdong merchants, making them the most likely source of smuggling.

At Lin Motian's request, Liu Xiang ordered the closure of the border gate, suspending all trade with the Portuguese. He also ordered a blockade of the Pearl River estuary, strictly forbidding Portuguese ships from entering or leaving Macau.

"Effective immediately, movement of personnel between both sides is prohibited. Only Portuguese purchasing food and daily necessities at the border gate will be allowed. All Macau vessels are forbidden to leave port. Any newly arriving Portuguese ships must divert to Hong Kong."

After Liu Xiang signed the order, he sighed: "Now we'll be famous. Within a few months, everyone from Hirado to Batavia will know Guangzhou is having a plague outbreak. Skyler is going to throw a fit..."

"At a time like this, who's talking about economic issues," Lin Motian said. He was quite displeased with Skyler—if not for his "Wealth of Nations" attitude, they wouldn't have been importing furs from Liaodong in the first place. Now they'd made plenty of silver, but the plague had come along with it.

"That's how it is then," Liu Xiang said, suddenly feeling a sense of displacement that he was being superseded. Guangzhou city now seemed like Lin Motian's word was law. Everything revolved around epidemic prevention; all other matters had been set aside. And the Elders and naturalized cadres coming to consult and discuss went directly to Lin Motian.

Lin Motian had no time to understand how Mayor Liu was feeling. He just kept issuing orders, with commands and documents flowing continuously from the Municipal Government's Epidemic Prevention Office, rapidly transmitted throughout the entire city.

Neighbors initially thought the proprietor and staff of Xingfu and Liu Deshan had been caught up in some "rebellion" case and arrested by the Australians. But then personnel wearing long white isolation suits and thick masks appeared to post seals and spray medicine in the shops and homes, immediately arousing public panic. Then, as one regulation and announcement after another was issued, news that an epidemic was spreading in Guangzhou quickly spread throughout the city.

Though the streets weren't under martial law, the nighttime curfew had been restored. Significantly more police and National Army soldiers were patrolling the streets, all wearing thick white face masks without exception. Regulations had been established for reporting illness and death, sanitation measures were being enforced more strictly, a "Rat Extermination Campaign" had been launched urging every household to submit one dead rat per day...

Once the word "epidemic" spread, wealthy households in the city began relocating to their country estates. Lin Motian had originally ordered police to closely monitor changes in the flow of people in and out of the city, prepared to immediately activate the martial law order if large-scale population exodus appeared. However, since there had been no explosive outbreak of infection and death, there were no immediate signs of mass flight. Within the city, households were all boiling vinegar, burning charcoal, and smoking mugwort, filling Guangzhou with a haze of smoke.

Quarantine Inspector Huo Junming put on his red armband and large mask, then began today's patrol with Zhao Gui.

He was of local military household origin, with even a minor "minor banner commander" position attached to his name. At seventeen, he had already been filling in as a soldier in the camp forces. When the Australians arrived, he had muddled along with the commanders in "surrendering to the Song."

After surrendering to the Song, back pay for many years was immediately distributed, not a single coin short. The brothers in the camp were overjoyed, all saying the Elders' Council was truly generous. But the good times barely lasted a few days before orders came down that everyone was to pack up and board ships—no exceptions allowed. Several hundred Fubo Army soldiers with bayoneted rifles stood watching menacingly.

Everyone thought they were being loaded onto ships to go fight, and they all wept miserably. Unexpectedly, shortly after setting out to sea, they docked and disembarked. The place, somewhere in the Lingding Ocean apparently, was called "Hong Kong" according to the sailors.

As a Guangzhou native, "Hong Kong" had been a household name these past few years. It was said that foreign ships from both East and West all went there to trade, and the Australians had even built a fortress there, filled with mountains of gold and seas of silver...

But that was just talk, because no one around him had ever been to Hong Kong. Despite being lifelong residents of Guangzhou, most of them had never even been to Humen.

Hong Kong had no mountains of gold or seas of silver. In front of the massive Hong Kong fortress were only enormous cargo yards and towering cranes belching black smoke and white steam. Ships filled the harbor like clouds, giving the soldiers their first glimpse of modern port operations, which was eye-opening indeed.

Upon reaching Hong Kong, Huo Junming naturally received the "purification" treatment, followed by "training." First, officers and soldiers were separated: officers in one group, soldiers in another, personal guards and household retainers in yet another. Then came the culling of the old and weak—the elderly, sick, and disabled were all separately housed in an "accommodation unit." Those willing to return home to make their own way were given severance pay and could take the transport ships between province and Hong Kong back to Guangzhou at their leisure. Those with nowhere to go were taken in and settled by the Hong Kong Agricultural Reclamation Battalion.

After culling the old and weak came the "root digging" phase, which mainly involved "settling accounts" for the "historical issues" of officers and veteran ruffians. Though considering the need for future recruitment of defectors, aside from a handful of egregious criminals who were hanged at the soldiers' strong demand, most managed to keep their lives. But they had already been terrified senseless by the violent mass movement and firmly insisted on "laying down arms and returning to the fields." They were subsequently dispersed and resettled in Hainan Island, Taiwan, and Jeju Island.

As a reward for the Elders' Council's magnanimity and their abandoning darkness for light, they were allowed to retain their property. Immovable property and shares that couldn't be taken along were purchased by the Enterprise Planning Bureau.

Lower and middle-ranking officers and soldiers who hadn't aroused popular anger were given a choice: those willing to continue military service stayed at the Hong Kong Training Detachment for continued training; those unwilling either received severance or were resettled as immigrants.

Huo Junming originally didn't want to remain a soldier. His family was in Guangzhou, and he wanted to take his severance and go home. But then he thought that going home meant no prospects. He had been a soldier since age seventeen, seven or eight years of being a common grunt, and he knew nothing else. Going home, he couldn't even get hired as a shop assistant—shops all wanted people who had apprenticed from childhood. Unless he went to the docks to carry loads and work as a coolie. Better to stay with the Australians. Fighting was dangerous, but the Australians were famously formidable in battle—maybe one fight would earn him a future.

But fighting didn't come his way. Instead, he was loaded back onto ships and returned to Guangzhou. Off the ships, they didn't enter the city but first trained at the old Drill Camp of the Guerrilla Commander. Only then did he learn he had joined something called the "National Army Epidemic Prevention Battalion."

He originally didn't know characters, but a few months of training and literacy classes meant he could more or less read newspapers and such. He knew those three characters for "National Army"—the instructors had covered it in the lesson on "The Armed Forces of the Elders' Council," saying the National Army was a type of force under the Elders' Council's command, with functions similar to the old "militia squad" in the yamen. But what "Epidemic Prevention Battalion" meant, he completely didn't understand.

Not until "Dr. Lin" gave them lessons did Huo Junming learn what "epidemic prevention" meant. That night, he tossed and turned, unable to sleep. He thought about how this corpse-carrying work used to be done by beggars, so why were they suddenly having to do it? There were several thousand vagrants at the ready in Guandi Temple—why not use them instead of "respectable people" like themselves? These Australians really were muddle-headed!

Some of those training together were crying, some lay in bed staring at the ceiling wordlessly, some wiped tears and entrusted their comrades with their "orphans"...

Huo Junming tossed and turned all night without sleep. The next morning his eyelids were swollen. During roll call, three had reportedly run away. He was just calculating whether to run himself when these three were brought back at lunchtime. Trussed up with their arms behind their backs, they were dumped in a corner.

Now things got serious. During training, people had run away too, but back then they were still personnel awaiting assignment, and getting caught just meant crouching in a dark room eating leftovers for a few days. Now that they were in the Epidemic Prevention Battalion, they had formally enlisted in the Song military. Running now meant being a "deserter."

The three unlucky souls were first dragged to the parade ground by the "guards" and beaten savagely in front of everyone. Then they were declared "expelled from military service," "three years of hard labor in the mines," "forfeiture of military pay." The last item made everyone's calves tremble: "Entire family exiled to the miasmatic lands of Taiwan"—the Epidemic Prevention Battalion's soldiers were all of Guangzhou local military household origin.

Now Huo Junming didn't dare think about "escape" ever again. He could only obediently attend classes. Since it concerned his own life, no one dared to slack off—and besides, the Australians had a renowned reputation for "miraculous effectiveness" in medicine, which also increased their confidence in learning.

Because the training class run by Lin Motian lasted only one week, and the Epidemic Prevention Battalion members had extremely low education levels, teaching focused on basic identification of plague and other epidemic symptoms and cases, along with corresponding protective measures and epidemic prevention methods. The principle was: simple, easy to remember, executable.
