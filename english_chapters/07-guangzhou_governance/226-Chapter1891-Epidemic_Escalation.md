# Chapter 1891 - Epidemic Escalation

## Epidemic Escalation

After Wen Desi departed, Lin Motian penned a note to Cui Hantang, explaining his urgent need to locate a "feng shui treasure site" in the suburbs—somewhere suitable to serve as a charitable cemetery for the epidemic's victims. He requested Cui Hantang's assistance with the site inspection.

He then composed a second note to Shen Ruiming, calling for prosecution of those recently detained for mobbing the epidemic prevention station and violently resisting quarantine inspectors' attempts to enter private residences.

"...Prosecute under the charge of obstructing official duties or endangering public safety. We must create a powerful deterrent."

After handing these notes to the messenger, Lin Motian exhaled deeply. Since matters of principle could not be compromised, perhaps in their specific implementation he could incorporate something to soothe the public's hearts—a memorial service, perhaps? Yet with the city gripped by panic, gathering the masses for such an event hardly seemed prudent.

*This really is difficult.*

Fu Wuben, roused from slumber by the crackling loudspeaker broadcast, yawned cavernously. His eyes struggled open, but the instant recognition of his surroundings jolted him awake. He dressed with brisk efficiency and began his ablutions. A new day had dawned, and there was work aplenty awaiting him.

Doctors and nurses from Bairén General Hospital, Ma'ao Army General Hospital, and Hong Kong Naval General Hospital had been streaming into Guangzhou one after another, reinforcing the frontline epidemic prevention efforts. Even so, the gaps in the city's health department remained vast.

Since the plague's outbreak, personnel shortages had multiplied alongside mounting epidemic prevention pressures. The various epidemic prevention stations and newly established infectious disease treatment centers still lacked sufficient resident doctors. Given the specialized nature of infectious disease management, most personnel stationed at these locations came from the Epidemic Prevention Battalion. Having a few medics assigned was already considered favorable—though in Lin Motian's estimation, these medics from crash courses were scarcely distinguishable from ordinary epidemic prevention team members. Anything remotely serious required summoning support from the Guangzhou General Hospital. Implementation of isolation and cremation policies met constant obstacles, and every department cried out for more hands.

Fu Wuben struggled to keep his leaden eyelids from drooping while his hands moved with practiced speed. A towel draped around his neck in the manner he'd learned from Old Xie, he brushed his teeth rapidly while his mind was already churning through the day's tasks.

His role was to serve as a roving physician for the epidemic prevention stations. With the health department's limited capabilities, stationing a dedicated doctor at each location was impossible. Instead, they had adopted a district system—one physician permanently based at a central station would make rounds among five or six surrounding epidemic prevention posts.

Fu Wuben had earned his physician certification through the "lineage disciple" pathway. But by health department regulations, traditional Chinese medicine lineage disciples were required to undergo modern medical training. Thus he had visited Bairén General Hospital multiple times for advanced study and had absorbed the principles of modern medicine. His understanding of infectious diseases hovered just above the level of popular science. Yet facing naturalized citizens who needed to learn what "bacteria" even meant from scratch, his expertise was more than sufficient to impress. Besides, he had earned a Class A diploma, marking him as a bona fide intellectual among the naturalized citizens under the Elders' Council's administration. And everyone knew that though this Dr. Fu was young, he was an Elder's personal disciple—quite possibly a future senior cadre in the health department. No one dared treat him lightly.

Though he bore the title of station doctor, the health department possessed no effective treatment for plague. His duties consisted primarily of diagnosing suspected cases, verifying that epidemic prevention measures had been properly implemented, completing the daily paperwork Lin Motian demanded, and "educating" the naturalized citizen workers engaged in epidemic prevention.

This last task—training—was the most crucial. As the epidemic intensified, prevention work grew heavier, and the ranks of deployed personnel had swelled dramatically. These naturalized citizen workers not only knew nothing of epidemic prevention; they possessed scant basic health knowledge and harbored varying degrees of fear about their work. Simply issuing orders and demanding execution would likely cause problems. When it came to changing customs, mistakes could be tolerated. But health work was a matter of life and death. Better they understand a little than remain wholly ignorant.

"Comrades, in our previous studies we learned the principles of microbial pathogenesis. Today we'll examine one of the most severe infectious diseases in the health epidemic prevention system—plague, which we designate 'Disease Number One.' This is a classic bacterially-caused illness. Let's learn about the pathogen, pathogenesis, and key points for prevention and treatment." Fu Wuben wrote two large characters—鼠疫 (*Plague*)—on the blackboard in his best professional manner and commenced his lecture.

"I know that in the quarantine and epidemic prevention training sessions previously organized by the Elders' Council, some comrades gained preliminary understanding of key prevention and treatment points for common infectious diseases such as plague, cholera, bacterial dysentery, and smallpox. But I'm aware you must still have many questions, especially since most of you had no background in health or microbiology before attending those sessions. Director Zhao has therefore instructed me to deliver another lecture on the fundamentals of these diseases. But truthfully, the Council's training sessions already covered this in considerable detail. This is merely a review."

"The causative bacterium of plague is called Yersinia pestis—no, no, not 'one-two-three army.'" Fu Wuben glanced at the notebook of a medic in the front row and turned to write "耶尔森菌" (*Yersinia*) on the blackboard.

"Why such a strange name..." the medic mumbled, somewhat embarrassed, and scratched out a few lines in his notebook.

Fu Wuben recognized him. This was Yu Qing, whom his master Liu San had pulled from the river upon entering Guangzhou and subsequently saved through surgery. The man had originally practiced medicine himself. After being rescued, he had persistently sought to become Liu San's disciple. Seeing his determination, Liu San had agreed, making Yu Qing Fu Wuben's "junior brother." However, because his origins remained unclear, he had only been assigned to work as a receiving physician at Runshitang's Guangzhou branch.

"Yersinia is named after a medical pioneer of our Great Song... judging by the name, probably a Semu person." Fu Wuben tugged at his dress-code collar—he remained deeply uncomfortable with Lingao-style cadre uniform collars. "But that's beside the point. Comrades needn't necessarily remember the bacterium's name. Prevention and treatment are what we most need to focus on. Allow me to introduce the plague Yersinia..."

"What's with you, comrade? Which department are you from? Why are you blocking me at a time like this? Do you know what I'm here to report? This matter is stipulated in the Quarantine and Epidemic Prevention Implementation Measures! I can even request to see your epidemic prevention team leaders directly!"

Just as Fu Wuben was lecturing enthusiastically, a commotion erupted at the main entrance. He set down his book and peeked outside. The medic Yu Qing in the front row had already risen to his feet, his expression darkening with displeasure.

"What's all this shouting? If you have something to say, say it calmly. This is no way to behave!" Yu Qing called toward the gate. Though he had only recently joined the cause and remained a new naturalized citizen, he had personally witnessed the brilliance of "Australian medicine." Liu San had taken him as a disciple but offered guidance only in traditional Chinese medicine, saying little about Australian techniques. Yu Qing therefore treasured every lecture and training session the health department organized. When Fu Wuben's class was interrupted, he—seated in the audience—felt angrier than the man at the podium. Especially when he looked and saw it was merely a quarantine inspector at the door.

Fu Wuben gestured for everyone to remain calm and walked over. "I'm the central station doctor. What's the matter?"

"Comrade!" The quarantine inspector, seeing a doctor had arrived, ignored the sentry and saluted. "I'm from Station Sixteen. I have an urgent situation to report!"

A crowd had already gathered. Fu Wuben said, "We have procedures for how we do things. Unless it's extremely urgent, making such a commotion is itself a violation of procedural principles..."

"This *is* extremely urgent!" The quarantine inspector's face flushed crimson as he thrust a document forward, loudly declaring: "One suspected case of pneumonic plague discovered!"

"What... what...?" Yu Qing hadn't heard clearly.

"Have him repeat that!" But Fu Wuben had heard. He was stunned, nearly dropping his teaching materials. Several cadres who had attended the training class blanched at the words "pneumonic plague" and leapt from their seats, running to the door.

"Quarantine Inspector Huo Junming reporting! One suspected case of pneumonic plague discovered in South Scissors Lane!"

Fu Wuben snatched the document from the inspector's hands. "Plague contact history... acute onset... high fever... cervical lymph nodes... bloody sputum... gram-negative bacillus..." He felt his hair standing on end. "Messenger! Report to Epidemic Prevention Battalion Headquarters immediately!"

"What about his plague contact history? Why wasn't he isolated?" Fu Wuben demanded, staring hard at Huo Junming. According to Lin Motian's latest requirements, the quarantine inspector responsible for each district had to conduct not only street patrols but also regular household inspections. The moment a suspected case or contact was discovered, mandatory isolation had to be enforced.

"The patient had contact with a fur peddler while purchasing goods—but he didn't recognize that peddler. They only stood in line together..." Huo Junming's expression was one of profound frustration. "That peddler was confirmed shortly afterward. But this patient today... because he didn't recognize the man and they'd only exchanged a few words, he forgot all about it afterward... When I went to inspect, he didn't mention it. His family knew nothing. Who could have imagined he would become infected like this!"

"And that peddler? What's his current condition?" Yu Qing asked. Beside him, Fu Wuben wanted to ask why peddlers—a profession clearly designated for special monitoring—could still permit such a situation to occur. But after a moment's reflection, he felt the question was pointless. His lips moved once or twice, but he said nothing more.

"Still in isolation at the Infectious Disease Hospital," Huo Junming said. "But I've never been to the Infectious Disease Hospital, so I don't know his current condition..."
