# Chapter 1810 - Forcing Virtue Into Vice

"Whatever you come up with, do it quickly." Madam Han said. "The Australians work swiftly and decisively. Besides, this household registration matter can't be delayed. If they discover there's an unregistered person here, the fines won't be small!"

"Yes, this servant understands." Madam Yao hurried to acknowledge.

Because she was preoccupied with the "pretty goods" in the back courtyard, as soon as she withdrew from the main house, she headed toward the rear courtyard.

Madam Yao was so diligent partly because she had received "patronage" from Madam Han—she had come from a lower-class brothel background. Getting hired into a first-class establishment like the Fangchun House as a client matron meant Madam Han had given her a recognition of sorts. The other reason concerned her own future livelihood.

This "pretty goods" had been brought by Wang Dong less than a month ago. Though Wang Dong was young, he was an old hand at romance. His father Wang Daniao was fond of women; the son was no less so. He had been consorting with prostitutes from a young age.

But though Wang Daniao had some income through his maps, he wasn't truly wealthy. Plus his fondness for women meant considerable expenses. He didn't have that much money to fund his son's brothel adventures. So Wang Dong hung around the pleasure quarters "free-riding on visits and meals." He was handsome, knew board games and chess, calligraphy and painting—nothing he couldn't manage. The friends he made were all hangers-on and moochers, unscrupulous types. Having mixed in brothels for a long time, prodded by others, he had taken up the trade of seducing respectable women and then reselling them.

Seducing respectable women typically targeted young widows from middling or lower families, or inexperienced young women from remote areas. Using sweet words and romantic deceptions to lure them into elopement, then selling them at an opportune moment—because such women were mostly of unclear origin with no go-between, ordinary households absolutely didn't dare buy them. Only madams backed by powerful forces would even consider asking.

This trade ruined women's reputations and easily attracted vengeful victims. Without considerable backing, one couldn't do it. Wang Dong had his father's connections in the yamen, so naturally he had no fear. After the Australians entered the city, he disappeared for a while before resurfacing recently—apparently because of his father Wang Daniao. Wang Dong had been detained by the Australians for a few days, but since he didn't know his father's whereabouts either, and the Australians couldn't get anything useful out of him, they released him.

Since Wang Dong was of no use to the Australians, he naturally didn't need to keep hiding. His home had already been sealed by the Australians. With nowhere to go, but with the brothel business flourishing again, he simply resumed his old trade—freeloading at various pleasure houses. Carefree and content. More than ten days ago, he had suddenly delivered a young woman to the Fangchun House, asking fifty taels of silver. Because this young woman was a widow yet still "intact"—a virgin, technically—and came from a good family, literate and somewhat skilled in the literary arts, she was what pleasure houses called "pretty goods." Under normal circumstances, she could easily fetch four or five hundred taels. After haggling, Madam Han settled at fifty taels. This kind of woman of unclear origin—brothels always bargained ruthlessly.

As for the abducted woman, once she discovered the "rich relative's house" her lover had brought her to was actually an unmistakable brothel—well, "scream until your throat tears, no one will come."

Abducted women naturally raised a fuss—suicide attempts, struggling, scratching, biting, kicking—all too common. For Madam Yao, none of this mattered. Brothels had plenty of ways to "handle" them.

In the establishment's back courtyard was a secluded compound with gates always tightly shut. Madam Yao arrived at the door and lightly knocked several times. The door creaked open halfway, revealing a middle-aged servant woman who saw it was Madam Yao and hurried to greet her with an obsequious smile: "Madam Yao!"

Madam Yao didn't respond. She lifted her leg and stepped through the gate. Inside the gate was a small courtyard. Though cramped, this was where the establishment's prostitutes turned pale with terror. The three main rooms were the "courtroom." The east and west wing rooms were the "cells." Any newly arrived prostitute had to be "given a thrashing" here. Never mind decent women unwilling to fall into prostitution—even pleasure-house girls born to the trade, as long as they were sold outright to Madam Han, new arrivals had to come here to "drink sesame oil." This so-called "drinking sesame oil" meant holding oil in the mouth, stripped naked and bent over a bench for whipping—three hundred strokes per session. Not a drop of oil could fall from the mouth; if it did, the count started over. Even the fiercest women, after two or three rounds of sesame oil, had to bow their heads.

New arrivals got beatings; the establishment's "old hands" didn't escape either. Those who broke house rules, those with too few clients, those contemplating "going straight"... all would be brought here to "face the court" and receive punishment—and naturally weren't permitted to scream, lest they disturb the elegant mood of gentlemen enjoying themselves in front.

Inside the courtyard, not a soul stirred. Only the sound of sobbing—sometimes urgent, sometimes slow—echoed mournfully. In the summer afternoon it sounded eerie beyond description.

Madam Yao wasn't bothered by this. Nor did she look at the servant woman following close behind. She asked: "How's that woman doing?"

The servant woman hastily smiled: "She's willing to eat rice porridge now. It's just she's been beaten so badly she still can't sleep at night. Just this morning she asked me if she could get some bruise-healing medicine."

Madam Yao smiled smugly. So she was willing to eat porridge—that meant she wanted to live. Knowing her body hurt and wanting medicine showed she feared suffering. After all this water-grinding, it was time to switch to gentle methods. Of course, if she thought she could stall for time, she'd need another taste of suffering—this was no place for showing off cleverness.

"Since she's softened, no need to force her onto the brick-kneeling every day. Food can be better too. But at night she still has to wear chains—to prevent her from killing herself." Madam Yao instructed the servant woman.

They'd had cases before: women feigning submission, then hanging themselves the moment guards relaxed.

Death meant not just official trouble—paying to smooth things over—but the establishment would also feel unlucky. Everyone in this trade was especially superstitious about ghosts and spirits. On stormy, dark nights, there would often be "hauntings," disturbing the whole brothel. For the madam, apart from psychological terror, monks and priests had to be invited for rituals. Another expense.

The Fangchun House had experienced such things before, so Madam Yao was particularly careful about this.

"Yes, this servant understands."

"Take me to see her."

The servant woman led her to the east wing room door. Opening it and fumbling with the lock. The room wasn't large, dim inside, with only a few benches and some bricks scattered on the square-tiled floor. A wooden bucket in the corner was soaking some bamboo strips. In the center, two wooden pillars were studded with hand and foot shackles. One of them held a woman, still sobbing constantly.

The room reeked with an unpleasant smell—human sweat, urine stench, and leftover food all mingled together. But Madam Yao wasn't bothered. She paused only to let her eyes adjust to the dim light inside. Then she sauntered over.

Hearing someone enter, the woman chained to the pillar raised her head. She was pale and haggard, looking no more than seventeen or eighteen. Ragged clothes, disheveled hair, yet her skin was tender and her frame delicate—clearly a well-raised, pampered household upbringing. Especially the pair of her small feet visible beneath her skirt hem, bound correctly and daintily—obviously the work of a master.

Seeing it was Madam Yao, the woman's face showed fear—these days of daily beating, daytime whips and canes, nighttime brick-kneeling with candles balanced on her head, had tormented her to the point of living death. Seeing Madam Yao felt like a little demon seeing the King of Hell. She couldn't help but tremble all over like chaff.

Madam Yao was pleased in her heart. She looked the woman up and down: "Miss He, these days you've thought it over—yes or no?"

This woman was none other than He Xiaoyue, who had escaped from the Pure Virtue Hall earlier. After following Liu San's group back to Guangzhou, she had been placed in a charity hall. He Xiaoyue, originally from a wealthy family in another province, had been forced by her family into widowhood after her fiancé died, then sent by her mother-in-law's family to the Pure Virtue Hall to preserve her virtue. After half a year in the Pure Virtue Hall, she had finally escaped. But she couldn't endure the charity hall's dreary boredom either. Finding opportunities to sneak out for walks, one thing led to another—she caught the eye of that good-for-nothing Wang Dong. A sheltered young lady, even if somewhat spirited, knew nothing of the world's treachery. Even with a bit of spunk, a few coaxing words and she was seduced. Then—sold to the Fangchun House.

At first in the brothel she struggled and resisted. But the brothel's methods also taught her that her bit of spirit instantly became wailing and begging. Gradually, her resolve to preserve virtue faded considerably; she only wanted less physical suffering, buying time day by day.

Her heart was full of regret, needless to say. But things had come to this—never mind escape; even suicide couldn't be managed. He Xiaoyue saw this fierce "madam" enter and couldn't help feeling several degrees more timid.

"This servant greets you, Auntie," He Xiaoyue said softly. "I beg you for mercy. Let this servant send word out. This servant's family still has some silver. However much you want, they'll surely provide to ransom this servant..."

"Ransom?" Madam Yao sneered. "You're still dreaming this pure autumn dream! Let me tell you: your seducer sold you to the establishment for three thousand taels of silver. Now you've been eating and drinking here on the establishment's coin—this account hasn't been settled with you yet! Bring out three or five thousand taels of silver, and Mother might not even deign to glance at you!"

Three or five thousand taels of silver—even ordinary wealthy households couldn't easily produce such a sum. He Xiaoyue knew this madam wouldn't release her. Her heart was both remorseful and hateful. She begged softly: "I beg Mother for mercy. I was originally a widow keeping faith. Mother, if you could spare me, I'm willing to serve as ox and horse in the establishment for life."

"Oh, I would never have guessed you were a virtuous widow," Madam Yao sneered. "If you're a virtuous widow, how did you end up with that worthless bachelor?"

At this, He Xiaoyue lowered her head in silence, only continuing to sob. Madam Yao knew her psychological defenses were slowly crumbling. She struck while the iron was hot.
