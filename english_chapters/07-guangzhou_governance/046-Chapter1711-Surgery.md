# Chapter 1711 - Surgery

At that moment the young man weakly opened his eyes. Seeing someone taking his pulse, he managed to speak: "Sir, please don't trouble yourself... This intestinal abscess of mine is an old ailment. This time I won't survive it... I only beg that my benefactor bury my body and not leave it exposed in the wilds. For your kindness, in my next life I will repay you as an ox or horse, tying grass and bearing rings of gratitude..."

Liu San thought that without surgery there was nothing to do but prepare for the worst. He was about to offer a few comforting words when a crewman came to report: they were almost at the Guangzhou World dock.

Meng Xian said: "Guangzhou World has a clinic—they can do minor surgery..."

Liu San remembered too. Guangzhou World did indeed have a small clinic. It wasn't open to the public; it was there to safeguard the health of the transmigrators stationed in Guangzhou and the senior naturalized cadres—after all, Ming-era medical standards weren't exactly reassuring to transmigrators. Later, the Ministry of Health planned to use it as the foundation for a Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital in Guangzhou, monetizing medical services to rake in money locally—the official justification being "meeting transmigrators' health needs after the northern offensive." Quite a lot of materiel and equipment had been shipped to Guangzhou World. So this clinic was now quite well-equipped with medicine and instruments.

With all that, saving this man's life should be possible. Liu San hurriedly had the sailors fetch a stretcher, loaded the young man onto it, and rushed to Guangzhou World.

Zhang Yikun, the manager of Guangzhou World, came to the gate in person to greet them. Liu San had no time for pleasantries; after a quick hello, he asked directly whether Guangzhou World had the conditions for surgery. Zhang Yikun nodded: "There's a small operating room. Who needs surgery?"

Liu San briefly explained the situation. Zhang Yikun looked troubled: "Saving lives is certainly the right thing to do, but this person you've rescued is a complete unknown, and you want to use controlled materials. This, this..."

Liu San said urgently: "His life is hanging by a thread. We have the ability to save him—I can't just stand by and watch him die..."

Zhang Yikun, like most transmigrators posted abroad, had long grown accustomed to the cruelty of medieval society. The life or death of a non-naturalized native meant nothing to him. Even with Liu San's plea, he still hesitated.

Liu San said: "How about this: I guarantee I won't use a single piece of Class-1 controlled material—only instruments and equipment, plus a small amount of consumables—all of which I'll pay for at cost. Will that work?"

Put that way, Zhang Yikun couldn't very well refuse. Without further ado, he led Liu San to the clinic. Liu San looked over the instruments and medicines in the cabinet—they would be adequate for the surgery. The operating room had one surgical table but no shadowless lamp; however, the lighting equipment available would suffice.

Though he specialized in pharmacology, he was a proper medical-school graduate and could handle routine surgical procedures.

At this point, all he could do was try everything. He enlisted the clinic's medic and nurse as assistants. First, they washed and sterilized their hands and changed clothes. His two apprentices also scrubbed up and changed, to observe.

There were no modern anesthetics in the clinic—even if there had been, they would be expired. He used nitrous oxide for anesthesia—one of the easiest anesthetic gases to produce in the Yuan Council's inorganic chemical industry, made by heating ammonium nitrate powder to decomposition. It was typically inhaled mixed with oxygen, but since producing pure oxygen was still difficult, they used a mixture of nitrous oxide and air.

Once the anesthesia took effect, Liu San immediately picked up the scalpel and made the incision. He had neither an EKG nor blood-pressure monitoring. Moreover, because the abdominal situation was unclear, he did not use the standard McBurney's incision in the right lower abdomen but instead made a large opening along the right rectus muscle—since the patient was a "John Doe," if the rescue failed there would be no family to "cause a medical disturbance" by beating up staff or extorting money. So Transmigrator Liu was comparatively bold. The patient, under anesthesia, lay unresponsive to whatever was done.

He operated while explaining to his apprentices: he opened up the muscles and peritoneum layer by layer, suctioned out the pus, lifted the cecum, and found the appendix—already severely inflamed and gangrenous. He first clamped it with hemostatic forceps, ligated with No. 4 thread, and made a purse-string suture on the cecum wall about half an inch from the appendix base before cutting the appendix. The stump was swabbed with povidone-iodine, then inverted and buried in the purse-string suture; as the suture was tightened, the mosquito forceps were withdrawn, and finally the suture was tied off so the appendix stump was completely buried. A few reinforcing interrupted stitches of No. 1 thread secured the seromuscular layer. After irrigating and suctioning out all pus and exudate from the abdominal cavity, the cecum was replaced, a drainage tube was inserted and brought out through an opening below the incision, absorbable thread was used for continuous closure to seal the cavity, saline was used to irrigate the wound to prevent infection, No. 4 non-absorbable thread was used for interrupted sutures on the external oblique aponeurosis, and No. 1 non-absorbable thread for interrupted sutures on subcutaneous tissue and skin. The surgery was complete.

Though a minor procedure by modern standards, Liu San was drenched in sweat. His two apprentices, who had only studied TCM under him until now, were clearly awed—they gazed at their master with admiration and wonder.

Liu San had no confidence in the outcome. The post-operative hurdle was infection; without antibiotics, recovery depended entirely on the patient's own immunity, and the mortality rate was quite high. Having promised not to use controlled materials, he couldn't use the antibiotics brought from the original timeline. He could only use antibiotics produced by the Health Department's own pharmaceutical plant—of limited purity and considerable side effects. Every year, a number of patients treated by the Health Department died from drug side effects.

"Go ahead and give it to him." He wrote a prescription and handed it to the nurse. "Is everything in stock?"

"All these drugs are available," the nurse said respectfully. "Chief, your surgery was truly brilliant..."

"It was passable," Liu San said. "I'm a bit out of practice."

Zhang Yikun came over to chat and also complimented him on his brilliant technique and boundless virtue, much to the weary Transmigrator Liu's satisfaction.

Over the following days, Liu San went off to attend to various official duties in other areas. He returned only once, a few days later, to remove the drainage tube, take out the stitches, and handle other follow-up. He instructed Liu De, who was staying behind, to administer Tongmai Sini Decoction daily to the patient, followed by restorative treatments with Huangqi Jianzhong Decoction and Guipi Yangxin Decoction. Zhang Yikun also assigned an attendant to look after the patient daily.

The young man had a strong constitution to begin with. With proper rest and adequate nutrition, he was gradually recovering within days. By now he had grown quite familiar with Liu San's apprentices. Learning that the man who saved his life was one of the Australian Song transmigrators whose renown shook the entire south, he pressed hands to forehead again and again, overwhelmed with gratitude.

This day was the third day of the third month—the Shangsi Festival. Liu De told him that Transmigrator Liu had returned. The young man immediately asked to be taken to pay his respects and thanks. Upon entering Liu San's temporary office, he saw the cheerful Liu San chatting and laughing with Zhang Yikun. He immediately prostrated himself and kowtowed in thanks for saving his life.

Liu San had his apprentices help him up and asked about his condition and background. The young man spoke with a Shaanxi-accented Mandarin and answered respectfully: "I am honored that my benefactor inquires. This humble person's health has greatly improved. My surname is Yu, given name Qing, courtesy name Zecheng. I hail from Suide in Shaanxi Province. Because my hometown has suffered years of disaster, I had no choice but to leave. Along the road of exile, both my parents perished... I drifted through hardship all the way to Hunan and Hubei, where I heard that in Guangzhou people were recruiting refugees to farm in Qiongzhou—providing three meals a day of white rice, all you could eat, with no worries about food or clothing. I received this glad news and came specifically to seek a way to live. That day, as my boat was about to reach Guangzhou, who would have thought we'd encounter a White Dragon patrolling the river! It was toward dusk, and suddenly the sky and earth changed color, the wind rose and waves surged, and a white dragon whose head touched the clouds and whose tail hung down to the middle of the river came twisting toward us. In an instant the boat capsized. Every passenger was drowned. After I fell in the water, I was lucky to find a floating plank, and thus escaped with my life. But then my old intestinal abscess flared up again; amid the storm and rain, suffering from both cold and pain, I was certain I would die... I never imagined that Heaven would be so merciful as to send a transmigrator benefactor to rescue me from the road to the Yellow Springs! Otherwise I would long since be in a fish's belly! And my benefactor further healed my grave illness with divine skill. Such kindness, high as heaven and deep as the earth, I can never repay even a fraction in my lifetime..." As he spoke, the memory stirred up old sorrows, and he wept uncontrollably.

Liu San comforted him with kind words. Yu Qing gradually stopped weeping and dared not cry further. Zhang Yikun, however, asked with keen interest: "That White Dragon you encountered—that must have been a tornado, rarely seen in southern China but common in the Americas. There's nothing supernatural about it. Tell us in detail what the tornado was like."

Yu Qing clearly didn't want to revisit that terrifying scene, but he dared not refuse to answer. He said only: "At the time I was panic-stricken, my soul flying away. I only vaguely saw the White Dragon stretching from sky to river; then the boat capsized. What happened afterward I can't remember."

Zhang Yikun smacked his lips with apparent regret. Liu San comforted Yu Qing: "You've only just recovered—go rest."

But Yu Qing said: "My benefactor's kindness in saving my life is like a second birth—you are to me like a reborn parent. I have nothing to repay you with; I have nothing of value except a volume of medical writings passed down in my family, the livelihood of my ancestors for generations. I wish to present it to my benefactor; I beg my benefactor to accept it." As he spoke, he pulled an oilcloth bundle from his breast, unwrapped it to reveal a thread-bound book, and presented it to Liu San with both hands.

Liu San took it. The book had a wax-treated cover with the four characters *Qingniu Yifang* (Medical Prescriptions of the Blue Ox) written on it. It seemed to have been water-damaged; the characters were somewhat blurred. Inside, the pages were hard yellow paper, all handwritten—a collection of medical formulas. He closed the book and said solemnly: "A gentleman does not covet another's treasures. Since this is your family heirloom, you should keep it yourself. I am a physician; when I encounter peril, how could I not lend a hand? Saving lives is my calling—I do not seek repayment. As for my medical skill, even if the high officials and nobles of this Ming dynasty came begging, I might not be willing to treat them. That you and I should meet is simply fate. Healing your illness makes me happy enough." Half of Liu San's words were sincere truth, half were the high notes of virtue—to demonstrate an Australian Song transmigrator's magnanimity.

Yu Qing pleaded again: "I know my benefactor's medical art surpasses the gods—even Hua Tuo reborn or the Medicine King revived could not equal it. But I beg my benefactor to consider my heartfelt gratitude and accept this book. If it might fill even one gap, it would repay a small part of my debt of gratitude."
