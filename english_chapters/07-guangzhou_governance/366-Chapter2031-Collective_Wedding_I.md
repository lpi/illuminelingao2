# Chapter 2031 - Collective Wedding (I)

"This Daoist has plenty of enjoyment! No need for your flattery. You bald head, you're quite the clever one!" Cui Hantang laughed.

Shi Tong'an knew that though he called him "bald head," he actually quite enjoyed the flattery. Feeling pleased, he smiled along: "The Daoist Master is one who has attained the Dao in Australia, naturally above such enjoyments. But if there's anything needed, just instruct this poor monk."

Cui Hantang laughed heartily: "Fine, fine. If I need anything, I'll certainly tell you first."

After seeing Shi Tong'an off, the dejection Cui Hantang had felt over failing to sway Li Suiqiu was swept away—just a Li Suiqiu, what's the big deal? When the Tax Bureau swallows you down to the bone, we'll see if you're still so arrogant! But among Li Qiushui's group, there were several clever ones—worth considering taking in. After all, Li Suiqiu's days were still comfortable, while these scholars were all quite poor...

The fundraising campaign was a great success under Cui Hantang's management. Though he "skimmed off" quite a bit, through everyone's efforts, funds for the collective wedding and renovating the newlyweds' housing were secured. Everyone was satisfied.

According to the standard collective wedding procedure, there would typically be a "city parade" first. However, parading through Guangzhou's streets wasn't feasible—after all, the streets were too narrow for carriages, and using rickshaws would be too shabby. So "Pearl River cruising" would substitute.

During parades, couples would typically take commemorative photos at churches, city halls, or certain landmark spots. Local conditions didn't permit this, so Fang Fei eliminated this step. Instead, after the boats reached the dock, the newlyweds would take group photos at Great World Plaza. Then the wedding would begin right there.

The wedding venue was set at Great World's outer plaza—the city was still too cramped, lacking spaces for large-scale public gatherings. This location could accommodate several thousand observers, and was easy to secure and evacuate. Crucially, it had the sound amplification and lighting equipment necessary for mass gatherings and performances.

As for the wedding ceremony, they rejected the "Chinese style" proposed by the Huaxia Society, also turned down the "Western style" proposed by Wu Shimang and others, and finally vetoed the "revolutionary style" proposed by the Spartacus Society. In the end, they adopted the so-called "Australian style," which was actually a simplified version of old-timeline wedding company practices. The cultural performance would be self-funded by the Plaid Skirt Club—Wu Ciren had specially come to Guangzhou for this, allegedly to "inspect Guangdong's transportation and public safety situation."

As for the ceremony itself, several "leaders" would naturally need to give speeches and serve as officiants. Liu Xiang was quite willing to be the officiant, but Fang Fei ultimately decided to ask Wen Desi to officiate—not because he was the "highest official," but because Fang Fei thought his name was auspicious. "Desi" could be interpreted as "gaining heirs," and even its literal meaning was excellent—a tremendous good omen for newlyweds.

After the ceremony would come the wedding banquet. Seventy-six couples plus congratulating relatives and friends and wedding guests from all sectors added up to roughly five hundred people. At eight per table, that meant sixty tables. Neither the Ziming Restaurant nor local restaurants could handle such scale; they'd need to hire cooks specializing in wedding and funeral catering. They'd also need to specially erect tents, build stoves, and hire waiters—very troublesome, with hygiene and various other problems. Finally, Fang Fei made the call: buffet!

The biggest advantage of a buffet was requiring fewer service personnel. Mu Min was quite worried about gathering so many guests for the collective wedding. If arranged as eight-person tables, cooks, helpers, and waiters alone would number one to two hundred. Maintaining order would be very stressful.

Fang Fei was run off his feet, and Liu Yikun, head of Great World, was equally overwhelmed. For a while, the entire Guangzhou Municipal Government seemed to revolve around the collective wedding. Even the commoners in the streets and alleys were touched by this festive atmosphere—newspapers and posters had spread the news throughout the city. Those merchants and wealthy households who had "donated" or "offered meritorious contributions" through various channels were puffing out their chests, boasting about supposed "inside information" they didn't actually know—actually just hearsay combined with their own imagination.

Amid this joyous atmosphere, the day of the collective wedding finally arrived: September 1st, 1636—Liu Xiang joked this was the start of school.

"That's right, married life is also learning," Fang Fei smiled. "Family is a school. We've come here not only to change the old marriage system but also to change old family life."

Early in the morning, the women preparing to marry who were gathered at the "Guangdong Province Temporary Shelter" got up—they had already bathed the night before and changed into completely new undergarments and outerwear. The wedding clothes had been custom-made in Lingao, sponsored by the Huaxia Society: red dresses with hanfu elements, following the traditional women's hanfu style of upper jacket and lower skirt, using modern tailoring techniques for a more fitted, movement-friendly design.

They had already had their hair trimmed beforehand—to reduce styling time while also promoting the "new woman," all hairstyles were simple modern cuts without traditional buns. Just for this wedding, each woman had a specially-made red velvet flower tucked by her temple. Looking both gorgeous and elegantly simple.

When the bridal clothes were brought out, the brides exclaimed in amazement—when had they ever seen such beautiful garments? Not only were the cutting and decoration gorgeous, but the fabric was top-quality silk. In their former days selling smiles at doorways, their best clothes had been nothing more than crude cocoon-silk garments.

"So beautiful!"

"These must be Australian clothes—I've never seen anything like this..."

"I never thought I'd wear a red skirt—I could die content now."

"Don't talk about dying on such a happy day—how annoying!"

...

The brides chattered around the clothes, laughing and comparing. Though the styles were identical with only size differences, they kept picking up and putting down, holding each piece against themselves. Several mirrors were grabbed and passed around. Exclamations of amazement arose constantly, punctuated by bursts of laughter.

"Everyone stop comparing, they're all the same style. Hurry and get dressed. Time waits for no one."

He Xiaoyue urged the brides on. She too had changed into new clothes today, though still the "female cadre uniform"—naturally paling beside the splendidly dressed brides. As usual, she carried a bag containing today's wedding schedule and arrangement documents. He Xiaoyue had a heavy responsibility today—though not dressed prettily, she was effectively the "bridesmaid" for all seventy-six brides, accompanying and guiding them throughout. This was her first time handling work independently, and she couldn't help being highly nervous.

Because there were too many people, having Ziming Restaurant's professional makeup artists do their makeup wasn't possible. Each person was simply given a small personal pouch containing a simple makeup kit to do their own—though calling it makeup, it was just powder, rouge, and lipstick.

But even this simple makeup was enough to make the brides radiant—after all, smiles from the heart are the most beautiful.

Under He Xiaoyue's urging, the brides finally finished dressing, then left the shelter escorted by staff and police.

The area in front of the gate had been swept clean. As they exited, strings of ten-thousand-character firecrackers were lit on both sides, while musicians hired from the city played all the way. The few residents near this desolate, dilapidated temple came to see what the noise was about, curiously watching this grand wedding.

"So many brides! Whose wedding is this?"

"Marrying so many wives! Or concubines?"

In this era, there was no concept of collective weddings. Even taking concubines, one wouldn't take two simultaneously. These elegantly dressed brides streaming endlessly from the gate bewildered many people.

"What nonsense—this is the collective wedding the Australians are holding! Collective wedding! Dozens of couples getting married together!" explained someone who had read the papers or heard "announcements" at the teahouse.

"I see, these Australians really like to make a fuss, always coming up with new things."

"Not even wearing veils—and these clothes are too immodest!"

"Australians like this style. Haven't you seen those female cadres? Those pants are so tight—you can even see their buttocks."

Vulgar laughter erupted from the crowd.

"I heard many of them used to be prostitutes?"

"Shh! You want to die? Watch out or the police will arrest you!"

"Prostitutes or not, the Australians don't mind, so why are you worried?"

"Prostitutes are good—skilled, haha."

...

Though there was quite a bit of crude, indecent commentary among the onlookers, He Xiaoyue paid no attention. She held her head high and called out: "Everyone don't worry, watch your step, ignore what outsiders say."

In the canal in front of Huanghua Temple, five newly decorated "dragon" speedboats were already moored. The brides boarded one by one, to be taken to the "cruise ship" at the Pearl River.

This cruise ship was the *Octopus*. It had originally been assigned as a Joint Logistics transport passenger ship specifically for personnel and material transport between Guangzhou and Wuzhou. This time it was specially allocated for the cruise, and after simple repairs and modifications, it was completely decorated with fresh flowers. Guangzhou had always been famous for its flower markets; since the Ming Dynasty, Henan District had been the main gathering place for flower farmers. Fang Fei had ordered large quantities of fresh flowers and plants from the flower farmers of Henan District, all used to decorate the venue and ships.

The *Octopus* had been freshly painted, the various decorations that had been removed were reinstalled, restoring its former glory as Guo Yi's yacht. Today, further festooned with flowers, it was moored at Tianzi Wharf, drawing countless commoners to watch.

Tianzi Wharf itself was also freshly decorated with flowers. Not only were police maintaining order, but National Army troops had come to stand guard in formation. Folk music troupes gathered from throughout Guangzhou Prefecture played their instruments. The atmosphere at the wharf was grand and lively.
