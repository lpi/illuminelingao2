# Chapter 1831 - Pleasure Boat

Li Ziyu actually didn't care about this group of painted beauties; he only cast his gaze toward the "Pipa Zai." Fangchun Court was a large establishment, keeping as many as six or seven "Pipa Zai" year-round. The older ones were eleven or twelve, the younger still in early childhood. The older ones had already learned an air of romantic charm, while the younger ones were still ignorant.

However, Mingnu was not among them. Li Ziyu was a bit anxious. Gao Chongjiu's news was generally reliable. If Mingnu wasn't here, it meant Sister Han Qiao must have hidden her.

"Master Yu, this is the roster for the whole house. Please look it over." Huang Xiang had already come over with a stack of account books. according to the implementation details of the new management regulations, every brothel had to keep "sound ledgers" for the Public Security Section to inspect at any time.

Too comprehensive and complex ledgers were indeed a bit difficult for the brothels, so currently only two types were enforced. One was the roster: every employee in the brothel, from the madam down to the cleaning maids, everyone had to be registered. The other was following the inn convention: visitor registration. Anyone staying overnight in the brothel had to register.

Li Ziyu opened the roster and slowly turned from the first page. He didn't actually look closely until he reached the page registering "Pipa Zai". He looked carefully: there offered seven names in total. There were their "flower names" after entering the house, followed by their real names—this was required by the regulations. Fangchun Court was quite compliant.

But none of the seven names, neither flower name nor real name, was Mingnu. He thought that since Cao Huangshi had sold her from her maiden home, she might have used the surname Huang. However, none of these girls was surnamed Huang. He looked carefully at the Pipa Zai again; the number was also correct: seven.

Li Ziyu put down the roster and asked, "Is everyone in the house here?!"

Sister Han Qiao busily said, "All here! All here!" Huang Xiang gave a wink, and Sister Han Qiao quickly added, "There is a Miss Yue Wan, originally of our house, but she has been 'combed' by the Eldest Young Master of the Liang family. She is now considered Young Master Liang's mistress/outside woman. Although she still lives in the courtyard, she does not receive guests and is not under the house's management..."

"I know about this." Li Ziyu nodded. He had known this when he accompanied Lian Nishang on the "investigation" last time. This situation was common in brothels. "I mean, is there anyone else not on the register?"

Sister Han Qiao's heart jumped. *Did this policeman hear some wind?* She involuntarily glanced at Old Man Fang, piling up smiles as she said, "No, no, how would this slave dare to break your rules! They really are all in the book. If there are any others, they would be the maids of Miss Yue Wan's courtyard—but they are Liang family people, unrelated to this slave."

Her tiny reaction was caught by Li Ziyu's eyes. He knew there must be something fishy, and he felt confident. He closed the book and said pleasantly, "I trust what Madam Han says! No need to call roll. But now the regulations have security rules about fire and theft prevention. I wonder if you have implemented them all?"

Sister Han Qiao quickly said, "Master Yu, since you ordered these things, how would we dare not implement them? The water buckets and fire sand mentioned last time are all prepared. If you don't believe it, this slave will take you to look right now."

Li Ziyu laughed loudly: "Good, good. I also intended to inspect. In that case, please send someone to lead the way. I want to inspect inside the brothel." Before Sister Han Qiao could speak, he added, "As for everyone else, please wait here for a moment. After I inspect, I still have to lecture on the regulations. Do not disperse." He said to Ah Gui, "You take the brothers to maintain order here. Don't disturb everyone. And don't wander off. I'll be back in a moment."

Zhao Gui hurriedly responded, "Yes!"

Not letting the crowd disperse meant no one moving around in the brothel. Finding a person would be much simpler, and it prevented them from moving the person on the fly.

Sister Han Qiao was startled again. This Li Ziyu was indeed acting strangely! She had no right to refuse a police inspection. Moreover, Li Ziyu's reason for inspection was not only legitimate, but she herself had just personally invited him to "go look if you don't believe it"! That was originally just a figure of speech, but he had immediately taken it up.

"An eighty-year-old mother collapsimg a child"—I fell for this kid's trick! Sister Han Qiao cursed inwardly. On her face, she maintained a full smile: "Good, good, allow this slave to lead the way..."

"How can we do that," Li Ziyu smiled slightly. "Madam, you are the master of this whole house; I dare not trouble you. I think this Sister-in-law Yao should lead the way."

Sister Han Qiao wanted to speak again, but seeing his expression leaving no room for discussion, she could only say, "Yes, yes." She turned to Sister-in-law Yao: "Sister Yao, go lead the way for Master Yu. Serve him well!" She winked as she spoke.

Although somewhat worried, Sister Han Qiao wasn't completely panicked. Because the police had frequently come to Lefang Street for random checks and lectures recently, she had made some preparations.

Sister Yao hurriedly curtseyed and said, "This slave understands!"

Li Ziyu picked a few capable National Army soldiers to follow him to check the courtyards one by one.

Fangchun Court was extremely large. The layers of buildings, corridors, and courtyards twisted and turned, with carved beams and painted rafters. It not only made the National Army soldiers from poor backgrounds click their tongues in wonder, but even the somewhat knowledgeable Li Ziyu found it eye-opening.

Because the personnel had already been concentrated in the front courtyard, the various courtyards were quiet and empty. Sister Yao led Li Ziyu's group through the courtyards one by one as requested. Seeing they had reached the back courtyard with still no sign of Mingnu, he couldn't help but feel anxious.

He had suspected Mingnu was hidden in one of the rooms, but along the way, he entered whichever courtyard he wanted. Sister Yao didn't stop him from entering rooms either, clearly behaving with the confidence that no one was there. He wondered if Gao Chongjiu's news was wrong. But he remembered his conversation with Sister Han Qiao about "people not on the register" and the eye contact between her and Old Man Fang—there must be a trick.

The person must still be in the brothel, likely hidden somewhere. Li Ziyu thought to himself. Seeing Sister Yao's confident appearance, he thought, *Today I will turn this brothel upside down if I have to!*

Coming out of the back courtyard, Sister Yao clearly breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Master Yu! You've seen all the rooms in Fangchun Court high and low. What other instructions do you have?"

She could see Li Ziyu's anxiety but feigned nonchalance, secretly gloating: *Even with your official status, you still have to drink my foot-wash water! How many days have you been on the job!*

Li Ziyu stopped and steadied his breathing. He remembered the instructor at Wanshou Palace saying one must find clues in the details. Was there anything overlooked in the places he just walked past?

Thinking this, he suddenly saw a small door on the back courtyard wall. He pointed and asked, "What is this place?"

"It's nothing, outside is the river jetty." Sister Yao accompanied with a smile, "Going out leads to the embankment."

"Open it!"

"This..." Sister Yao didn't expect him to want this door open. She froze and stammered, "Master Yu, outside this door is the riverbank. Stepping across means leaving the courtyard..."

"I told you to open it, so open it." Li Ziyu's face was cold. "You say it's an embankment, so it's an embankment?"

Sister Yao was now in a bind. She hesitated, "This... this slave doesn't have the key to this back door..."

Seeing her panicked expression, Li Ziyu knew there must be something strange behind this door. He suddenly shouted, "Men!"

The soldiers behind him stepped forward. Li Ziyu ordered, "Smash the door open for me!"

The soldiers immediately complied, raising their rifle butts to smash. Sister Yao panicked and quickly said, "Don't smash, don't smash! This slave will go get the key."

"You follow her." Li Ziyu instructed a soldier.

Helpless, Sister Yao had to get the key and open the door.

Outside the door was indeed the White Goose Pool. Steps were built on the stone embankment. At the bottom of the steps, a pleasure boat was moored.

Li Ziyu's eyes lit up. He asked, "This is your house's pleasure boat, right?"

The brothels on Lefang Street often had their own pleasure boats for water excursions. Usually, they were moored at the river jetty at the back door.

Hanging on this pleasure boat was the plaque "Bang Han" (Near Cold), which was exactly Fangchun Court's pleasure boat—before inspecting Fangchun Court, Li Ziyu had learned from Gao Chongjiu and others to do some homework beforehand, gaining a rough understanding of Fangchun Court's situation.

Sister Yao's face changed dramatically. She forced herself to stay calm: "This pleasure boat is not our house's. Someone probably couldn't find a place to moor for a moment and borrowed this place... This is a common occurrence..."

Li Ziyu "hehe"-ed twice, immediately feeling confident.

***

He Xiaoyue was currently locked in the cabin of the pleasure boat. The brothel's methods these past days had tortured her. She had long thrown away the thought of guarding her chastity to death and had thoughts of compromising for the sake of survival. Seeing the timing was about right, Sister Yao switched to gentle methods, having someone remove her shackles and apply stick-wound medicine. The kitchen sent delicate dishes with meat and vegetables daily. Last night's meal even included a small bottle of Suzhou Hualu wine—she hadn't smelled wine for years.

Under such sugar-coated bullets, He Xiaoyue's will gradually wore down, and her psychological defense collapsed. Sister Yao came occasionally to persuade her a few more times, and she had effectively given up resistance. A few days ago, Mu Yun came to teach her Pipa. He Xiaoyue knew this was preparation for selling smiles, but dared not think or say "no" again, half-refusing and half-accepting as she learned.

Although she had resigned herself to fate, thinking that the rest of her life would reduce her to a prostitute leaning on the door selling smiles, He Xiaoyue would involuntarily feel despair in the dead of night, washing her face with tears, and even thinking of ending it all with death.

However, since ancient times, the only difficulty is death itself. Although He Xiaoyue repeatedly thought of "dying," she ultimately couldn't make that resolve.
