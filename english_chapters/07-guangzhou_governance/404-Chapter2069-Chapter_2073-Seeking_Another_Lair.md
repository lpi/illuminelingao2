# Chapter 2069 - Seeking Another Lair

Hao Er nodded in agreement. As for the next steps, he had already made his calculations. He said:

"In my view, the Australian pirates' surveillance in Guangzhou grows ever tighter by the day. The city is no place to conduct operations. Yet if we work outside the county seat, the roads are unsafe—banditry occurs frequently, and the Australians conduct thorough inspections. It would not do to transport valuables. Therefore, this enterprise should be divided into parts, each handled in different locations."

Hao Fang's proposal was to work in parallel. Outside the county, they would solve the problems of plates, molds, paper, and ink. This way, aside from the slight risk of transporting engraved plates, moving paper and ink would not easily arouse suspicion even if inspected en route.

As for printing the silver-dollar notes, that would naturally take place within the city itself. First, a printing workshop could be easily concealed. Second, the main market for silver-dollar notes was right there in Guangzhou's urban center. Once printed, they could be circulated locally.

As for the silver coins—though the jewelry shop provided cover, the operation was simply too conspicuous. It required large quantities of charcoal, and lighting fires produced smoke, making concealment difficult. Once the pirates discovered counterfeit silver dollars in circulation, they would inevitably investigate such establishments strictly. Better to manufacture them in a quiet location outside the county.

"...Your plan is sound. But once the silver coins are minted, they must be spent—and transported back to Guangzhou. Unlike paper notes, these are heavy items..."

"The counterfeit silver coins can be spent locally," Hao Fang mused. "In my view, the manufacturing site should be in Foshan!"

Foshan was renowned for its metallurgical industry. Large and small smelting workshops were beyond counting, and it would be easy to set up a new workshop there to cover the coin-minting operation. Procuring fuel and casting materials would also be convenient. Moreover, the town boasted many master foundrymen; as long as the true purpose remained secret, much of the work could be delegated to local craftsmen.

Furthermore, Foshan was a gathering place for merchants where goods flowed in all directions. The daily volume of goods moving through was incalculable, and the flow of silver and currency was immense. Counterfeit silver coins minted there could be diffused locally, mixed into the massive payment streams where they would be far less likely to be detected. Killing two birds with one stone.

Meng Guolu nodded: "Hao Er, these are truly the words of a seasoned strategist. This plan is most appropriate!" He continued: "Stone Elder was of the same mind. When I left the capital, he sent word to instruct me: production and distribution must be separate; parties must not meet."

"Well said!" Hao Er clapped his hands in agreement. "Exactly so. Stone Elder truly possesses far-seeing wisdom!"

"We shall divide tomorrow and act separately," Meng Guolu said. "Hao Er, return to Guangzhou and first relocate the silver-coin workshop to Foshan. As for us—once we find a suitable location, we shall contact you. Fifteen days from now, come to this temple to offer incense and make donations. On the tenth page of the alms register, I shall leave a coded message under the name 'Meng Chang'; you will understand at a glance."

The Fourth Master whom Hao Er had not met at Yongtai Temple was at that moment seated in a quiet chamber at the Xilai Hermitage outside the Western Gate, sharing tea with a monk.

Though the two had exchanged warm greetings upon meeting like old friends reunited, in truth this was their first encounter.

They studied each other. Fourth Master was rather stocky, of short stature, with dark skin, slightly high cheekbones giving him a broad, flat face, and small eyes. By the standards of the old time-space, he resembled a sun-darkened, leaner version of "Third Du"—precisely matching the common Guangdong villager's appearance. Dressed in coarse cloth like a shop assistant, sitting beside Gou Er in his monk's robes, Gou Er looked like a gray mouse and he like a black monkey.

Fourth Master expressed mild surprise: "Why has Second Master taken on the guise of a Buddhist?"

Gou Er lowered his voice: "Keep it down. My dharma name is now Haixiang; my master composed a verse: 'Ocean guests moor at Yingzhou, the dharma-image mirrors Heaven and Earth.' I'm now a senior dharma-master of the Hai generation."

Fourth Master said: "I have long heard of Second Master's grand talents—years of battling the Australian pirates, always managing to escape danger at the critical moment..."

Gou Er smiled bitterly: "Let us not speak of the past. What grand talents? I've merely been luckier than others."

He and Rotten-Eye Hu had pulled off a major coup in Wuzhou—though it had briefly shocked both court and transmigrator circles, in reality it was meaningless. The Great Victory at Wuzhou evaporated in an instant, and Xiong Wenchan's capital was squandered entirely. Worse, believing it too dangerous to leave Xiong Wenchan alive, the Australians had launched the Guangxi campaign; now Guangxi too was on the brink.

Gou Xunli had participated in conspiracy after conspiracy, escaping time and again while his collaborators died or were captured one after another. Gradually, he had acquired the epithet "God of Plague." Had Stone Elder not insisted on using him, he would have long since become a homeless stray.

Now he could not even say whether his relentless struggle against the Australians was driven by revenge or simply the need to earn his bread—perhaps both at once.

Though he had accepted this assignment and returned to Guangzhou, he knew that the city was implementing household registration and issuing identity papers. The great households, even those not yet harassed by the pirates, were now under intense surveillance; even casual conversations might blow his cover. After much deliberation, the safest course was to assume the role of an outsider to the mundane world.

Though the Australians had instituted their "Religious Corporate Reform," their control over religious orders remained superficial—Buddhist monasteries especially. Not only were they numerous, but the Council of Elders had no corresponding oversight mechanism. For the moment, this remained a blind spot in their control system.

With Stone Elder's help, Gou Xunli quickly obtained ordination documents. He shaved his head, donned monastic robes, and became a "monk."

"...Nowadays the monasteries are unwanted by anyone—the Australians can't be bothered with them. With my ordination documents in hand and silver to spare, I lodged here; the abbot doesn't care what I do and lets me come and go freely. Besides, with a shaved head and grown-out beard, the pirates' wanted posters and portraits are useless. This is the most suitable arrangement imaginable."

Fourth Master pondered: "So be it. The deeds for the properties you provided have all been transferred. The contact with Hao's craftsmen has been made; everything proceeds according to plan. But this estate is located in Qingyuan—far too remote. A round-trip by boat takes several days; communication is slow. I've seen there are fields and houses west of Yuexiu Mountain as well. Perhaps..."

Gou Xunli shook his head: "The pirates have organized mutual-guarantee systems inside and outside Guangzhou, implementing collective-responsibility laws. With officials and soldiers constantly coming and going, it's impossible to set up operations so close. The surrounding mountains make Qingyuan, Conghua, and Guangzhou all accessible by river, convenient for both goods and transport. Qingyuan itself sits astride major routes; whether for dispersing merchandise or personnel movements, all can be concealed. Moreover, dyeing and casting both require water—being near the North River ensures no shortage. Right now the pirates have bitten off more than they can chew: Guangzhou proper may be locked down tight as an iron barrel, but outside the city, governance in the counties still follows the old appeasement policy. Even where they've appointed real or fake Australian county magistrates and implemented Australian systems, it's nothing but a net full of holes. With a little care, one can slip through. So while Qingyuan is barely a hundred li from Guangzhou city, it's an entirely different world."

Fourth Master said disdainfully: "What has Guild-Head Gao ever accomplished—city foxes and village rats, nothing more. Never mind. You need only tell me the results; keep your separate spheres. Too much shared knowledge serves no purpose."

Gou Xunli said: "Though they may be petty rogues, some have loyal hearts. Guild-Head Gao may be unreliable, but his brother has a core of integrity. Pity he's too young!"

Fourth Master said: "The money has been received, the estate purchased—there's nothing urgent for the moment. I too am preparing to visit Qingyuan. If Gao's people are needed for action, I'll have someone place a notice in the newspaper saying there's a buyer seeking Dong Qichang's *Fisherman's Painting* at high price. Tell Guild-Head Gao discreetly, to avoid confusion later." He produced a scroll from his bundle and handed it to Gou Er: "Have his man present this to Master Hao when making the exchange; then goods can be handed over."

Gou Xunli said: "Tomorrow I shall take the excuse of soliciting alms and make rounds to all the contacts. After completing this circuit, I too must find a place to shut myself away for meditation. Though this temple is good, it's not safe to stay long—lingering too long, and the pirates' watchdogs will surely detect flaws."

Fourth Master shook his head: "No hurry. A fortnight won't yield results... Guild-Head Gao is ultimately not a steady man. Take care not to expose yourselves."

"Once I'm outside the city, I'll change clothes before proceeding—it won't cause problems... But if the court doesn't send a major army here, what's the point of all these petty schemes?"

"The court cannot act at once. Moreover, years of money shortage remain unresolved. If we can glean the secrets of their currency system from this enterprise, that too would be a gain. The great ones above make their decisions; we below need only carry out orders, without asking too many questions."

"And if things go wrong?"

Fourth Master paused: "If we truly devote ourselves heart and soul to the royal cause, how can we fail?... Besides, when things fall apart, won't you be the first to run anyway?"

"Don't mistake the Australian pirates for mere bandits. You people from the capital think everything follows logic, and you've underestimated the world's heroes—otherwise how would there be refugees everywhere, eastern barbarians running rampant, and now Australian pirates too? Always think a few steps ahead. Don't find yourself with no way out when disaster strikes!"
