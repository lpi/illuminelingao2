# Chapter 1793 - Run Over Pasteboard (Gebei)

Manager Shen said that although this kind of silver had existed since ancient times, ingots were rarely seen on the market. It was mostly used to make jewelry and head ornaments, being quite rare.

"This silver is slightly lighter than white silver, but the color is good and it doesn't easily turn black. Wealthy families cast small ingots to reward people for fun." Manager Shen said, "As for casting it directly into such a large ingot, this is the first time this humble one has seen it."

"So it's fake silver then?" Li Ziyu saw him beating around the bush, talking for a long time without saying real or fake, so he asked directly.

"I dare not say that," Manager Shen shook his head repeatedly, "Zhuti silver has existed since the Han Dynasty and has circulated in all dynasties. Even in this Guangzhou market, the price of Zhuti silver jewelry is higher than that of silver jewelry."

Li Ziyu returned to the Municipal Bureau with this information. Hearing that this was "not white silver", Wu Xiang immediately instructed Li Ziyu to take all the gold and silver confiscated from Widow Wang's house, including broken pieces, ingots, and jewelry, to Jufeng Hao for inspection. The result was that apart from these five ten-tael silver ingots and a few pieces of jewelry being Zhuti silver, the rest were white silver and gold of varying fineness.

"These silvers and jewelry definitely didn't belong to this poor widow, they must have been left by the deceased or the suspect." Li Zhenguo said.

"If they were the suspect's, I think he would very likely have taken the Zhuti silver away. After all, this isn't a common thing, leaving it behind could be the root of trouble. I think the silver is very likely the deceased's. The suspect thought it was just ordinary silver." Li Ziyu expressed his view prudently.

Overall, the possibility that it belonged to the deceased was high. According to Manager Shen, although Zhuti silver was not rare in Guangzhou, it wasn't everywhere either. Moreover, it mostly appeared in the form of jewelry. Now the deceased actually brought fifty taels of Zhuti silver at once, which compelled people to link the deceased with the Yunnan-Guizhou area.

Wu Xiang remembered several issues Director Mu highlighted in the recent cadre meeting for naturalized citizens, especially mentioning the recent new currency issuance work, asking everyone to pay close attention to financial and economic anomalies in the market—Zhuti silver ingots definitely counted as a suspicious point.

He immediately decided to report this situation to Mu Min first. At the same time, take a series of measures: issue notices to all police stations and security checkpoints in the city, asking them to check if there were any heads in their jurisdictions; publish a corpse identification notice in the "Yangcheng Express"—although this corpse had no head, he still hoped the deceased's family members could confirm the identity through the description of physical characteristics. Finally, continue to investigate the recovered evidence and clues.

The screening work inevitably fell on Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui again. This time, their task was to screen based on the victim's clothing.

The clothing evidence found at the scene was really quite substantial. There were fully seven or eight pieces of men's trousers, jackets, and short shirts, as well as unburnt clothing fragments and shoe soles dug out from the stove hearth. Comparison by the coroner showed the size matched the headless corpse, so they should be the victim's clothes.

Although there were clothes, things weren't necessarily simple. Guangzhou was a major commercial port and a geopolitical center, with numerous officials, gentry, and merchants, where "all kinds of goods gathered". Not only were there a wide variety of silk and cloth produced in the province, but also textiles from all over the country and even Europe, Southeast Asia, and Japan. Various patterns, textures, weaving methods... added together there were probably over a thousand kinds. Although there were trade associations like the Silk Guild and Cotton Guild to inquire at, the workload was boundless—besides, the guilds might not necessarily know clearly what goods the shops imported. Or it might require asking shop by shop. Even if they found out which shop the goods came from, the clerk might not remember who the material was sold to. Moreover, for material to become clothes, it had to pass through a tailor's hands. With all these twists and turns, any link could break due to the forgetfulness of the parties involved.

Li Ziyu thought again and again, deciding to start with the two remaining unburnt shoe soles.

There were far fewer shops making shoes than shops selling silk and fabric. Screening would be much easier. Li Ziyu immediately went to a famous local shoe shop, asking the shopkeeper to take a look at what kind of shoes these soles were roughly from, and where they might have been sold.

The shopkeeper took the two scorched shoe soles, scrutinized them for a while, and said: "This isn't my humble shop's goods."

"Then whose is it? Can the shopkeeper tell?"

"Not anyone's. This was made by women at home." The shopkeeper said, "Officer please look, the thread used for this sole and upper, and the stitches of the awl, aren't the technique of a shop."

Li Ziyu was greatly disappointed, secretly cursing himself for being muddled: not many people bought shoes from shops to wear, most families still made shoes themselves to wear—he used to wear shoes made by his mother too.

"...However, this shoe sole does have a shop mark." The shopkeeper said.

"Oh, which one?"

In medieval society, not many people wore shoes. Most poor people didn't wear shoes, and even if they did, they were homemade, either straw sandals or cloth shoes. Traditional needlework, making shoes was a basic skill. Shop shoes were mostly purchased by the wealthy and leisure class. But truly particular families also considered shoes made by their own female relatives and servants as superior, rarely visiting shoe shops.

However, whether for shoe shops or wealthy families making their own, shoe soles were mostly purchased from outside—making shoe soles was hard work.

There was a specific trade for making shoe soles, commonly known as "Gebei makers" (*da gebei de*). Shopkeepers hired poor women, distributing scrap cloth strips and paste, for them to make at home, paid by the piece.

This making of Gebei (run over pasteboard) involved gluing fragmentary cloth strips together layer by layer with paste, then drying them with a branding iron into thin cloth boards similar to cardboard. Then the Gebei was cut into pieces of shoe soles, then the soles were edged with new cotton strips, and finally, multiple layers of soles were glued together with paste and branded dry. That was the finished product ready for sale.

"I know the Gebei of this shoe sole at a glance, it's goods from Old Hou's family outside the Small South Gate. His Gebei uses hemp cloth in the scrap cloth ends. The sole material only has six or seven layers, the key is that the paste is mixed with rice straw pulp for making local paper. Without peeling it open, it's hard and thick, but peel it open and you can even see the rice straw stems—truly goods just for show. Big shoe shops generally don't use it, mostly sold to small shoe shops and peddlers doing business with countrymen, and quite a few are sold retail by themselves."

Li Ziyu took Zhao Gui and found Old Hou's family outside the Small South Gate. Old Hou recognized at a glance that these were his goods. As for where they went, he couldn't say. He sold several thousand pairs of this kind of shoe sole wholesale to various shoe shops and vendors a month, and could also sell a few hundred pairs retail at the storefront. Even removing the share of shoe shops that didn't retail shoe soles, the remaining number was still considerable. How could vendors and clerks remember who bought them.

Moreover, judging from the wear and tear of this shoe sole, these shoes had been made for more than half a year. The hemp threads of the sole had many breaks, and some places on the sole were almost worn through to holes.

This amounted to saying nothing. Just as Li Ziyu was about to bid farewell in disappointment, a shop clerk suddenly interrupted: "Isn't this the batch of shoe soles sold to Changyu?"

With the shop clerk mentioning it, Old Hou also remembered. These were indeed shoe soles he sold to Changyu.

Why did both the clerk and the boss remember? Because the quality of this batch of shoe soles was particularly poor. The price Changyu offered was so low that ordinary Gebei workshops were unwilling to accept it. In the end, Old Hou accepted it, but stated clearly that quality wasn't guaranteed. So this batch of shoe soles used a lot of rice straw pulp in the material. The cloth Gebei was also only pasted with five layers.

As for why Changyu ordered such a batch of inferior Gebei shoe soles, Old Hou knew nothing. Anyway, he and Changyu settled money and goods, sold and done. But what he could be sure of was that this batch of shoe soles was all sold to Changyu, with no other customers.

Having obtained this important clue, Li Ziyu asked for Changyu's address and hurriedly took Zhao Gui to Changyu to understand the situation.

Changyu's storefront was in the north city—on a desolate street near the Small North Gate. It was a small shoe shop with a one-bay frontage. The arrival of Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui immediately caused a stir in the shoe shop. The shopkeeper hurriedly came out to welcome them with bowing and scraping politeness. Upon hearing them ask about that batch of inferior Gebei purchased from Manager Hou, the shopkeeper's face didn't look good, serving tea and bowing, then taking out a red envelope. Li Ziyu had a hard time explaining to him that he was here to investigate a case, regardless of whether his shoes were good or bad.

"Were these shoes made here by you?" Li Ziyu showed the two scorched shoe soles.

The shopkeeper took them, scrutinized them for a glance, and said they were indeed his goods. Except for the soles being purchased from the Hou family, the hemp thread used to stitch the soles was from his shop.

Li Ziyu remembered what the shoe shop shopkeeper said and asked: "It is said these shoe soles weren't made by shop clerks..."

Changyu's shopkeeper nodded: "Indeed they weren't made by my clerks. My shoe shop is small, all outsourced to others to make."

Changyu was a small shop with insufficient strength, only two clerks besides the shopkeeper himself. The business volume was small and unstable. So the business model was to wholesale shoe soles, uppers, and hemp thread, and outsource the processing to women from poor families to make. Paid by the pair.

As for why he ordered such a batch of inferior Gebei shoe soles from Manager Hou, the shopkeeper said with a look of shame: "Truly the price given by the customer was too low, and my humble shop extremely wanted to do this business, hence resorting to this inferior policy."

It turned out that half a year ago, a customer ordered five hundred pairs of cloth shoes from him, saying they were rewards for employees. But the price offered was very low, only half the price of ordinary shoes.

"...At this price, there was still a 5% commission," the shopkeeper said with a bitter smile, "If done according to ordinary methods, I'd have to lose money to do it. But it's rare for my humble shop to have such a big business. I was muddled for a moment, money blinded my heart, so... so... I agreed."

Since it was so cheap, and to ensure profit, naturally one could only lean towards counterfeit and inferior quality. Fortunately, the other party also said, as long as wearing them for ten days or half a month caused no problems, the deal was considered done. He naturally exhausted his abilities and racked his brains to come up with ways to cut corners.

"Since my humble shop opened, although not some old brand, making such shoes was also the first time, truly ashamed."

Li Ziyu asked: "Who bought this batch of shoes?"
