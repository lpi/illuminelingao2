# Chapter 1992 - New Australian Tricks Continued Again

"Good, good, of course it makes sense. Truly God of Wealth, much better than the Health Committee which is both stingy and has many problems."

"Not just your family, it is said Chief Zheng, you know the one managing the Physics and Chemistry Lingao? Ah no, Industrial and Commercial Federation, and the Customs at Guangzhou and Xiangshan Ao wharves, Health Committee all have..."

The "Collection by Agent / Entrusted Collection" plan originally planned by Zhang Xiaoqi successfully freed the Finance and Tax Bureau from the dilemma of tax farming, but there was no follow-up later, until the second quarter when it began to be implemented gradually. This was certainly because the plan needed refinement, but more importantly, after investigation they found the actual situation in Guangzhou was even worse than the worst they had imagined. After considering the quantity and quality of their naturalized cadres, the trio of the Finance and Tax Bureau determined the idea of "Grasping the Big, Grasping the Consolidated, Grasping the Easy."

The so-called "Grasping the Big" was taking the big households in the city as the main targets of collection; "Grasping the Consolidated" was directly collecting heavy taxes on bulk goods using the new wholesale markets formed under government organization after knocking out the牙 hang (broker/commission agencies). This part of tax collection was entrusted to Zheng Shangjie's Industrial and Commercial Federation. The Finance and Tax Bureau sent two people to be stationed at each market in rotation to be responsible for management supervision and accepting reports. Similarly, the Customs collected taxes on export goods as an agent. At the end of the year, the Finance and Tax Bureau would allocate handling fees of 5% of the total entrusted tax collected from its own office funds to each entrusted collection unit.

For taxpayers with fixed quota tax assessment, they were classified into two categories according to the idea of "Grasping the Easy." Among them, Level 2 fixed quota taxpayers were basically the middle class between big households and small households. This part of merchants operated relatively single industries, and their overall strength had a relatively large gap with true big households. They had no independent accounting ability or low ability, but generally had relatively stable operating income and fixed assets of not low value. Regarding this situation, Wang Qiyi believed they should be assessed fixed quotas according to Business Tax and Property Tax respectively, and required them to go to the hall to declare and pay tax by themselves to facilitate the Finance and Tax Bureau strengthening daily management.

Level 1 taxpayers could be said to be the bottom layer in the business circle. Operating income was mostly limited to maintaining livelihood, and fixed assets were even less worth mentioning, but the quantity was huge. Similar to later generations' individual households, "Husband and Wife Shops." The operating status of such shops was uncertain, opening and closing frequently. Let alone specific operating conditions, even grasping the exact quantity was a difficult problem.

In Wang Qiyi's eyes, these small flies were used to solve social problems. The cost of collecting tax from these people was far higher than the revenue; "scraping meat from fly legs" was not worth the loss.

However, most Senators including Liu Xiang believed that taxation was not only a money problem but also represented the ruling power of a state. To whom to pay tax was a major issue of right and wrong concerning people's hearts. So they compromised and determined that these Level 1 taxpayers only paid tax symbolically.

According to the decision discussed by the few in the Finance and Tax Bureau: this tax rate should be low to the extent that the burden was negligible, urging taxpayer households to pay tax actively, reducing the inspection and collection cost of tax departments.

The tax quota was a one-size-fits-all by industry. Each industry assessed a total quota containing all tax types (actually only Business Tax and Property Tax). All Level 1 merchants in this industry paid tax according to this quota. The quota was determined based on the principle of being slightly lower than the average revenue and total assets of this industry (for example, catering industry like Dong Family Shop was 1 yuan quota per year, equivalent to the monthly basic salary of a Guangzhou civil servant). Then the Industrial and Commercial Federation and the Finance and Tax Bureau would come forward, according to industry division, designate one household Agent Collection and Payment Taxpayer responsible for tax collection work in each industry.

For fixed quota taxpayers who had paid tax in the wholesale market, they were allowed to deduct tax. The basic principle was, if their turnover in the wholesale link did not exceed the upper limit of the current graded turnover, then according to the "Levy First Refund Later" mode, after paying the current period fixed quota tax, provided the agent collection and payment tax payment certificate issued by the wholesale market management office to the Finance and Tax Bureau to apply for tax deduction/refund. Considering the high inter-bank lending interest in the new spacetime, Zhang Xiaoqi stipulated that the Finance and Tax Bureau Tax Collection Hall should complete audit and refund within three days (not three working days) after receiving application, or deduct from next period tax with taxpayer's consent. For taxpayers whose turnover in the wholesale link exceeded the upper limit of the current graded turnover, the Tax Assessment Division and Management Office would jointly inspect on site. If exceeding the upper limit for two consecutive declaration periods, their grading level would be adjusted upward or collection method changed.

Li Ziyu listened to Zeng Juan's ceaseless introduction with a smile on his face, but a stream of cold air rose from the soles of his feet. Since entering the police force, from patrolling streets to solving cases, then to advanced studies in Lingao, his deepest feeling was the Senate's "Omnipotence." This omnipotence was not only reflected in their "Strange Techniques and Excessive Ingenuity"—this was nothing much, more was their strong desire to control everything. The key was, they not only had this desire, but also had endless "Strategies"—in front of the Senate, there seemed to be no difficult situation to cope with.

As a claw and tooth of the Senate, he was both proud of this system at all times, and often involuntarily trembling with fear.

The matter in Zhang Yu's company was "Routine Business." So Zhang Yu had full grasp of propriety regarding the arrival of these two "Old Friends." From beginning to end, there was not half a sentence of "Brother," "Old Friend" or similar addresses, only using polite addresses commonly used for greeting public servants, and even less half a sentence of private talk—what should be said was said days ago. Zhang Yu had confidence in his heart now, naturally didn't fear. He followed what Zeng Juan exhorted, answered one for one asked, spoke truth. Very quickly completed all procedures.

Finally, he originally wanted to chase a question: "Then what about the land contract?" This matter was his heart disease. If the transaction was completely voided, he had to look for land again—this wasn't something accomplishable in two or three days! And the machines ordered in Lingao waited for no one, let alone machines needed installing, debugging, workers needed training. Although the dates on Joint Logistics orders were loose, once delayed delivery he still had to pay compensation.

Delay in any link, he had the possibility of bankruptcy. However hesitating again and again he still didn't ask out—Zeng Juan didn't explain this matter to him, probably already had arrangements. Asking too much himself might provoke some trouble on the contrary. Anyway with Ah Juan looking after, he trusted!

Lights were bright in the Deputy Director's Office of Guangzhou Finance and Tax Bureau. Wang Qiyi was reading the basic situation investigation report on "Custom Industry" just delivered, preparing for the upcoming "Flower Donation" collection.

"Report!"

"Come in! ...Oh, Team Leader Zeng."

"Report Director Wang, the matter you arranged has been handled. Zhang Company agreed to void contract, supplement tax after re-signing contract. Old Shop Zhang and supplement contracts signed with other merchants also notified them to void together."

"Oh, did they have any emotions?"

Although Zhang Yu's family wasn't naturalized citizens within the system, they were heavily promoted by Senator Hong, and set up as typical "Collaborators" by Guangzhou Industrial and Commercial Federation. In specific execution Director Wang still had to pay attention to methods and ways.

"No, Zhang Yu and his father were very cooperative, fully supporting our Finance and Tax Bureau work. Just they wanted to know when they can re-sign contract. Zhang Company has ordered large batch of equipment and machines from Lingao; without land cannot start construction of factory buildings. And they also accepted large amount of orders from Joint Logistics..."

"This query is very reasonable. He must have pressed a very large sum of money on this; loan interest is enough for him to suffer. But no need to worry. Noble Gathering side won't move for now. After Team Leader Yao goes to issue Punishment Decision Notification today give him a few more days of peaceful life. We should look for a big fish. You notify Zhang Company to grasp these few days to re-sign contract and complete tax payment. Land transaction is still valid."

"Yes!"

"Alright, you go back. Remember to write a log about today's matter."

......

"Report"

"Come in"

"Report Chief, the matter of issuing Punishment Notification to Noble Gathering today completed successfully. Encountered no obstruction. Involved party very cooperative. Report finished!"

"Cough cough... Team Leader Yao, don't always hold airs like this. Relax a bit."

"Yes!"

"........................"

"Chief Wang, there is another thing I feel should report."

"You say."

"On the way back today, Team Leader Tian from Police Bureau who went with me said his family is relatives around bends with Shopkeeper Luo of this Noble Gathering. He said this Noble Gathering actually can't count as Luo family's at all. This Old Master Luo had submitted to Liang family when alive. Now this Luo Zhixiang is completely a fop. Noble Gathering surviving till today relies entirely on Advisor Liao [Liao Shiye] managing."

"So saying this Advisor Liao is a honest and kind person."

"Strange is strange here. This Advisor Liao isn't an old person of Noble Gathering, but came to Luo family suddenly after Old Master Luo passed away years ago, and became a person whose words are final once entered Luo family. Saying as true shopkeeper is not exaggeration."

"Interesting, interesting." Wang Qiyi stood up from behind desk, walking carelessly to Yao Yulan's side.

"I feel this Advisor Liao, he, his body has big article," Wang Qiyi stood too close. Yao Yulan seemed able to hear his heartbeat. She dared not look up, could only maintain looking straight ahead. Eyes happened to fall on Wang Qiyi's collar. Don't know why face started burning, speaking also somewhat stuttering.

"Mm, as a Political Security cadre your judgment has very much professional quality. We wait and see." Wang Qiyi said salt-less bland-less walking away from Yao Yulan. Just when Yao Yulan wanted to breath out a long breath, suddenly felt shoulder patted three times not lightly not heavily by someone.

"My big daughter's matter, many thanks for your help. But in future still need to do own job well first." Wang Qiyi leaned down from behind unexpectedly, whispering sticking to Yao Yulan's ear.

"Yes! For Senate... Yes! Chief Wang!"

"Okay, you go back. Remember to write work log."

Sending away Yao Yulan, Wang Qiyi paced back slowly behind desk again, sitting into chair with a plop. He raised left hand towards sun, clenched fist, released, clenched fist again, released. Suddenly smashed left hand on table fiercely three times. "Pat, pat, you pat a head [what the hell]."
