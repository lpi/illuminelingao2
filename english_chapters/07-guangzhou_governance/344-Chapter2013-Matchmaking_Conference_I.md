# Chapter 2013 - Matchmaking Conference (I)

Although Civil Affairs provided special nursing allowances for naturalized citizens with Grade 4 disabilities or higher who couldn't care for themselves—which, combined with disability subsidies, ensured an income no lower than the average naturalized worker's wage, and even higher for those with meritorious service awards—the phrase "unable to care for themselves" was enough to deter most women.

The cadres present repeatedly "mobilized" them, specifically emphasizing income levels and benefits: the couple wouldn't need to go out to work yet could enjoy a living standard comparable to most naturalized workers, plus extra welfare considerations. Finally, another batch of people chose these disabled workers. Most of these women had poorer conditions themselves: older age, children to support, or physical defects...

In the end, quite a few of this group remained unselected. Du Yibin knew the actual capacity of this matchmaking effort had reached its limit. Fortunately, there weren't too many personnel with Grade 4 disabilities or higher, so the problem wasn't glaring.

The "single women" who had selected suitable partners registered with the cadres and immediately packed their luggage to move into a separate dormitory—within a few days, the Civil Affairs department would arrange boat tickets for them to go to Lingao. Although Du Yibin and Wang Jun claimed that if they changed their minds they'd at most waste a one-way ticket, in reality, once they reached Lingao, they would absolutely never leave again, even if asked to.

As for those who hadn't made a selection, they remained in the shelter awaiting the next matchmaking event. Although Mao Xiuyu hinted that some "means" could be used to make them choose, Du Yibin felt it was too cruel. After consideration, he decided to let them choose later.

"The matchmaking conference is tomorrow. Should we talk to Elder Du about letting them participate too?" Lu Cheng, seeing over thirty people remaining with disappointed faces, felt somewhat unbearable.

Lu Weijia was indifferent, but Mao Xiuyu shook his head repeatedly: "Can't do that, absolutely not." He explained: "They remained because they were unwilling to choose disabled naturalized workers; if we let them participate in the matchmaking conference and they marry able-bodied naturalized workers, what will those who chose disabled men earlier think? How could we hold such events in the future?"

Both heard this and felt it made sense. Mao Xiuyu then suggested it would be best to isolate these single women—whether those preparing to marry or those who hadn't found matches—far away, preventing even news from leaking, lest knowledge of the students' matchmaking activities agitate them.

"We have no choice then." Lu Weijia nodded.

"Let's split up and handle our tasks."

Du Yibin and Wang Jun's matchmaking conference convened grandly at the shelter the next day. One hundred naturalized workers attended the matchmaking, all dispatched to work in Guangzhou or there on business. Their occupations were diverse, ranging from cadres, workers, police, soldiers... everything was there.

When selecting the men, Wang Jun and Du Yibin had put in some thought. Difficulty in finding wives was a perennial hard problem among naturalized workers. This was due not only to the disparate gender ratio but also to the rise in women's economic status. After large numbers of female naturalized citizens gained their own incomes, marriage became less urgent, and their requirements for mates changed.

Consequently, in the Lingao marriage market, those weaker male naturalized workers found it difficult to find partners. Firstly, they were generally older—"old bachelors"—lacking appeal to women; secondly, due to literacy and ability, they occupied the bottom tier of the Council of Elders' naturalized citizen hierarchy, engaged in simple physical labor. Not only was their income on the lower side, but they also lacked promotion prospects. Any female naturalized worker with a bit of vision looked down on them.

Since they couldn't find anyone within the system, they had to turn their eyes to the non-naturalized masses—but the demonstration effect of Lingao's naturalized citizen community was too powerful, and single men were too numerous. The expectations of eligible local women, already limited in number, were also high. As a result, this batch of naturalized workers over forty could only rely on buying prostitutes to solve their physiological needs.

Spending a blissful moment with "yellow ticket" holders could solve physiological needs, but it offered no help for a person's need for emotional comfort. Having no family and no children, the shadow of a lonely old age hung constantly over their heads.

During this mainland offensive, this batch of lower-tier "old workers" had also been dispatched successively. Although their abilities weren't up to leadership positions at various levels, Guangdong needed large numbers of basic administrative personnel and workers—at least they could read, calculate, and speak passable Mandarin. Incidentally, they came to Guangdong, where the gender ratio wasn't so skewed, to solve their personal problems.

Wang Jun selected from this group naturalized workers with over three years of service to the Council of Elders and aged thirty-five or older. He weeded out some who were clearly unsuitable, finally forming a list of one hundred men.

Early in the morning, these "older leftover men," notified to go "matchmaking," gathered at the City Hall government offices. To show support for this matter, Liu Xiang specially arranged several barbers to cut hair and shave faces on-site, and issued a new set of clothes to every worker attending the matchmaking. Wang Sangou, Deputy Chief of the City Government General Affairs Section, wearing a brand-new uniform, bustled joyfully among the group of bachelors waiting for haircuts and shaves, occasionally teasing them happily.

"Shave that beard cleaner, look younger!"

"Why haven't you washed this face properly? Look at those dark circles—what woman would look at you!"

"Going matchmaking with a frown? Don't want a son?!"

...

The bachelors were also beaming. Although they'd been told beforehand that the matchmaking candidates were rescued prostitutes, for old bachelors, getting a wife at all was an unexpected joy; they didn't mind the wife's background. They retorted to Wang Sangou's teasing:

"Section Chief Wang, you're an old bachelor too, why not go matchmake?"

"Your virtue is high and prestige heavy, plus you're a Section Chief—matchmaking would be a piece of cake."

"Section Chief Wang, you're a senior veteran of our bachelor world. Why not find a wife and sire a son yourself?"

"Spare Section Chief Wang, at his age, the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak."

"Haven't you heard 'old but vigorous'? King Wen of Zhou had a son at eighty."

"Using an umbrella as a hunting rifle yet killing a fox—is that what you mean?"

...

Wang Sangou beamed, unbothered by the bachelors' banter, shaking his head: "At my age, how many years do I have left? Even if I can hunt foxes, I won't do it—dragging down a good woman. You are all still young. Marry a wife, start a family, life will get better and better. This is all thanks to the Council of Elders!"

Joy filled the courtyard. Wang Jun, preparing to host the matchmaking ceremony, was all smiles. After bustling about for so long, he finally had some results. Though he was doing this to pad his performance record, everyone's happiness infected him too.

While enjoying the mood, he saw Du Yibin arriving, also beaming. Besides guards and a secretary, he brought an old man wearing a Dongpo scarf and a straight gown. His demeanor looked like an old pedant, face dark and expression unhappy. Wang Jun wondered: Who is this?

"This is Mr. Song... Song Yingsheng..." Du Yibin said, and fearing Wang Jun wouldn't know who he was, added, "Song Yingxing's older brother."

Song Yingsheng looked indignant. Ever since being captured in Enping and repeatedly failing to seek death, he found this Elder Du "deeply affectionate" toward him, trying desperately to persuade him to "surrender to Song." Upon arriving in Guangzhou, every time they met an Elder, Du would specially mention: "This is Song Yingxing's brother."

He was truly puzzled. Judging from the attitude of Elder Du and other Elders toward him, the Australians obviously attached great importance to his third brother Yingxing. But Third Brother was merely an unranked instructor at the Fenyi County School, and he himself was just a county magistrate. Second Brother Song Yingding had already passed away. As for their father, he was an old Licentiate who hadn't passed the imperial exam in forty years and had also passed away a few years ago. Their grandfather had died young. The most prominent member of the family was Great-grandfather Song Jing who had once entered the Grand Secretariat—but he'd been dead for nearly a century.

Although his family could barely be considered a "great clan" in Jiangxi, they weren't wealthy or powerful. Song Yingsheng wracked his brains but couldn't figure out why the hair-thieves were so interested in his third brother.

Persuading him to surrender in Enping wasn't enough; when this hair-thief magistrate returned to Guangzhou this time, he insisted on bringing him along, saying he wanted him to "broaden his horizons." Arriving in Guangzhou, though he hadn't seen the legendary Australian "massive construction" or "turning stone to gold," Guangzhou's streets indeed had a new look. Not only had illegal shops been demolished, but streets had been repaired, and ditches were being dredged everywhere.

Song Yingsheng was a former county magistrate. Although Enping wasn't a big place, he knew that doing these things was labor-intensive, costly, and thankless—especially the illegal shops, which were a chronic illness.

Since the Australians entered the city, they had actually done some concrete, good deeds! This improved his perception of the Australians considerably.

To be honest, he generally affirmed Du Yibin's governance in Enping, though there were many points he "disapproved of," feeling the Australians were overly trivial and "not talent for governing the world," only able to pass unimpeded thanks to guns and cannons.

Arriving in Guangzhou, he realized this administrative triviality had immense benefits—especially in a great city like Guangzhou. In his days here, being dragged around by Elder Du to various places, he felt deeply that the market streets here were vastly different from the past. Not only were streets orderly and clean, but the appearance of pedestrians on the street was also different from before. So his attitude toward Elder Du had softened slightly.

Being called to attend some "matchmaking conference" this time, Song Yingsheng refused inwardly. But having been reduced to a prisoner, he had to compromise. Attending such an event irrelevant to his integrity wouldn't hurt. Besides, Elder Du said he didn't need to do anything—help if willing, otherwise just stand aside and watch the fun. Since the Chief had put it that way, Song Yingsheng acquiesced.
