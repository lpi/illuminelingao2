## Chapter 1919 - Ups and Downs

Yet searching through, there was still nothing! Zeng Juan's heart burned with anxiety. He had originally been extremely confident about passing, but now his name was nowhere to be found. He steadied his nerves, telling himself: Old Yuan passed, so I definitely will too. His Australian studies were even deeper than mine—how could I possibly fail? He continued searching, but after going through the roster several times back and forth, his name and number remained elusive. He felt utterly dejected.

Yuan Shuzhi had vented his elation thoroughly. He calmed himself, and his mind immediately cleared from its daze. At that moment, he made a decision: he would definitely perform well in the Australian Palace Examination to justify all his hard work!

Just as he was thinking this, he glimpsed Zeng Juan squeezing out of the crowd, looking completely crestfallen. He started momentarily, then realized—could Young Zeng have failed to make the list? Impossible! His Australian learning was deeper than mine—how could he fail? He silently cursed himself for being thoughtless, too caught up in his own joy. Young Zeng had helped him so much, yet he had just gotten carried away. He was wondering how to console him when the crowd began to stir.

It turned out that this "cropped-hair *xiucai*" Hu Ziming had also come to view the results with several friends. He was confident of his own success. Sure enough, there in the first row of the roster was his name: Hu Ziming, Comprehensive Governance Office Clerical Position, Aptitude 32, Essay 80.

This score placed him among the top examinees on the list, and he was first for his position. Hu Ziming was extremely pleased with himself. A group of former classmates crowded around to congratulate him. Having previously caught the Australians' favorable attention for "knowing how to handle affairs," and now with such outstanding examination results, he was implicitly becoming the leader among them. The dozen or so students who had taken the examination together surrounded him like stars orbiting the moon.

"Hmph, truly it's said that wealth in the mountains draws distant relatives, while poverty in the marketplace draws none!" Yuan Shuzhi secretly sneered. Having experienced all manner of human warmth and coldness, he most despised such behavior!

"Eh, isn't that Ajuan from the candle shop? You came to take the examination too?" A green-robed young man standing beside Hu Ziming spotted Zeng Juan standing nearby and called out. The whole group turned to look. Some who didn't know Zeng Juan nodded in acknowledgment. Others, seeing his plain clothes and dejected expression and assuming he hadn't made the list, put on airs of superiority. A former classmate who had gotten along well with Zeng Juan came over with a delighted expression: "Ajuan, did you pass? I barely scraped in at the bottom—that was close!" This fellow was always careless and hadn't noticed Zeng Juan's expression.

The green-robed man beside Hu Ziming spoke in a mocking tone: "I'm sure with Ajuan's mastery of Australian learning, passing was no problem whatsoever!" His accent was pure new-style Cantonese, which Yuan Shuzhi could barely understand. This person had had some conflict with Zeng Juan at the academy. He had noticed Zeng Juan early and observed him for quite a while. Seeing his dejected appearance, he was now quite certain the fellow had failed, and wanted to thoroughly humiliate him in front of everyone.

"*Ahem, ahem*... Fellow examinees, the sun grows scorching. Let's not stand here. Another day I shall host a dinner for everyone!" Yuan Shuzhi deliberately coughed a few times and stepped forward to defuse the situation. He gave a perfunctory bow, wanting to lead Zeng Juan away from this place.

The student who had first spoken wasn't about to let them escape so easily. His eyes rolled and he casually remarked to his companion: "Ajuan must have topped the list. The likes of us will never be worthy of his company from now on!" Hearing this, Zeng Juan's face instantly darkened. He was at the breaking point—this was simply too much! He was about to rush forward and give him a punch, if only to vent his frustration. But the more experienced Yuan Shuzhi grabbed his arm and gave him meaningful looks. He sized up this fellow with his triangular eyes, several prominent pimples gleaming on his face, flower-patterned head ornament, green-patterned jacket, jade at his waist—the outfit slightly ostentatious. The family likely had some modest property and connections. From his experience, it wasn't hard to guess this person had some grudge with Young Zeng.

"Isn't that the one who stole books from Shangqi... that whoever... surnamed Yuan, that's it—that's you!" The green-robed man thought for a moment and then declared loudly, as though he had discovered something remarkable. They say when cursing someone, don't expose their shortcomings. Even Yuan Shuzhi's good temper couldn't prevent his expression from souring immediately. Hu Ziming, who had been watching the show from the sidelines, saw the situation escalating and quickly stepped in to smooth things over.

"Fellow scholars all came here to take the examination, surely harboring ambitions in your hearts. Why fight over momentary gains and losses? Starting a fight at this cultured ground of the Tribute Courtyard—wouldn't that invite ridicule? I hope you might give me, Hu, some face and let bygones be bygones? Brother Yuan possesses great talent; how can we carelessly comment?" Saying this, he actually bowed toward Yuan Shuzhi and Zeng Juan, performing a ninety-degree bow with a most proper attitude—though the contempt deep in his eyes was well-concealed!

The green-jacketed man bowed back with a smile: "Brother Hu is right. I wonder if these two great talents passed or not! Ahahaha!"

Yuan Shuzhi squinted up at the sky and said unhurriedly: "Unworthy as I am, the Senate did not reject me—I have the fortune to be among those on the red list!" Saying this, he even brushed off his long robe, feeling quite vindicated. Everyone was startled. Hu Ziming immediately put on a smiling face: "Congratulations, congratulations!"

The green-jacketed man, unwilling to concede, pressed further: "And what about Zeng Juan?"

"Er..." Just as Yuan Shuzhi was about to say that Zeng Juan had only escorted him to the examination, someone in front shouted: "Quick, look—another roster is coming out!"

"Hahaha, I think Zeng Juan hasn't made the list!" The green-robed man's braying voice rang out again.

This time, neither Zeng Juan nor Yuan Shuzhi paid him any attention, for they saw two more guards carrying a red silk roster. This time the roster was clearly thinner than the first. Zeng Juan's eyes lit up—there was still more names to post! When the guards finished pasting it up, everyone gathered again beneath the notice, carefully searching for their names.

This roster had far fewer names than the first—only about thirty in total. Everyone quickly realized that these examinees' scores were somewhat higher than those on the first sheet, though only by a few points. Some went from grief to joy; others were greatly disappointed. Just then, a piercing laugh rang out:

"Hahaha, didn't I say so! Zeng Juan hasn't made the list!" The green-robed man gloated. Yuan Shuzhi caught a glimpse of him seemingly breathing a small sigh of relief as he mocked.

"A bunch of wretches who can't stand seeing others do better than themselves!" Yuan Shuzhi silently sneered.

Zeng Juan's name was still not on this roster, but Wu Ming's name appeared: Aptitude 61, Essay 81. Written examination ranking: 15th.

Zeng Juan showed no expression this time. He had calmed down by now. Senior Wu was like him—well-versed in Australian books. Though Wu Ming's essay ability was certainly stronger than his own, he had the review materials that Li Ziyu had given him, making his preparation more targeted. That *Two Hundred Essay Topics with True Solutions* book—there couldn't be more than a few copies in all of Guangzhou! He had studied it thoroughly, so his scores shouldn't be too low. He carefully reviewed his examination in his mind: he was quite confident about the aptitude test—many questions he had either practiced from the review materials or encountered before in "Australian books." If there was any major loss of points, it would only be in the essay section.

But he had practiced his essays many times too. The Australians' question-setting wasn't tricky or strange. He had written according to the formulas in *Two Hundred Essay Topics*—it should have been methodical and steady. Even if he didn't score high, getting above 60 shouldn't have been a problem.

There was no reason his paper would... He waited, waited to verify his judgment, waited to slap those people's faces hard.

Sure enough, soon the third roster came out. Three rosters now hung neatly in a row—and this final one had only three names. Zeng Juan's name was prominently among them, and it was listed first!

Aptitude 79, Essay 80. First place for Tax Bureau Tax Source Management Position. First place overall in the civil service written examination!

This immediately caused a sensation. Overall first place—wasn't that the equivalent of *huiyuan*?! Never mind the metropolitan examination; even the top scorer in the provincial examination—the *jieyuan*—was an extraordinary figure.

The two characters "Zeng Juan" on the roster were like a resounding slap, landing hard on the faces of the green-robed man and others who had mocked him.

Overall first place—*smack*... *smack*—and especially loud!

The green-jacketed man looked as though he had swallowed a dead baby, staring wide-eyed at the roster as if trying to dissolve the characters through sheer gaze.

"This... this is impossible! They must have graded the papers wrong!" The green-robed man was hysterical.

"Dear brother, mind your words—beware that disaster comes from the mouth!" Hu Ziming warned.

In truth, the green-robed man simply couldn't accept this reality. Everyone knew the Australians were always known for their rigor and efficiency. For such an important "talent selection ceremony," they had strict anti-cheating regulations and procedures—they couldn't possibly make such a low-level mistake as grading the wrong paper! Hadn't everyone seen that even collecting the papers didn't involve local people, but rather students brought in from Lingao!

Water flows downhill while people climb up. Human nature was always to look up, not down. The group that had just been lording it over everyone now instantly wore faces full of "friendly" smiles. By now no one bothered with the green-jacketed man anymore; they all crowded forward to congratulate Zeng Juan.

As the saying goes, you don't slap a smiling face. Though their behavior was too calculating, they had at least observed proper etiquette. They would be working together as colleagues in the future—maintaining good relations with one's coworkers was something Zeng Juan understood. He had at least that much emotional intelligence!

Yuan Shuzhi was also happy for Zeng Juan. Young Zeng was well-versed in Australian learning; placing first was only natural. After exchanging some auspicious words, suddenly a group of servants arrived, carrying groom's ceremonial attire. The one who appeared to be the butler stepped forward and clasped his fists: "Would this be Young Master Zeng?"

Zeng Juan nodded and returned the bow: "I am he. May I ask what business brings you here?"

"Would Young Master Zeng please come with us for a moment? Come now, help Young Master Zeng change into the auspicious robes!"

"You... what are you doing?" Zeng Juan was utterly bewildered. He saw that all the newcomers were smiling, with no fierce expressions. Zeng Juan wasn't worried about personal safety—who would dare commit crimes right under the Australians' noses? But what exactly was this about? His mind was full of questions. Yet no matter what he asked, these servants only kept repeating "Congratulations on your success, Master," while crowding around trying to get him to put on the clothes.

Yuan Shuzhi suddenly slapped his thigh: "Catching a son-in-law from below the notice board!"
