# Chapter 1915 - Ups and Downs

Yet searching through the entire roster, there was still nothing! Zeng Juan's heart burned with anxiety. He had been extremely confident about passing, but now his name remained conspicuously absent. He steadied his nerves, telling himself: *Old Yuan passed, so I definitely will too. His Australian studies were even deeper than mine—how could I possibly fail?* He continued his search, but after combing through the roster several times in both directions, his name and number remained frustratingly elusive. Dejection settled over him like a heavy cloak.

Yuan Shuzhi had vented his elation thoroughly. As he calmed himself, his mind cleared from its euphoric daze. At that moment, he made a resolution: he would perform exceptionally in the Australian interview to justify all his hard work!

Just as this thought crossed his mind, he glimpsed Zeng Juan squeezing out of the crowd, looking completely crestfallen. Yuan Shuzhi started momentarily, then realized—could Young Zeng have failed to make the list? *Impossible!* His Australian learning ran deeper than mine—how could he fail? He silently cursed himself for thoughtlessness, too caught up in personal joy. Young Zeng had helped him so much, yet he'd just gotten carried away in celebration. He was wondering how to offer consolation when a disturbance rippled through the crowd.

It turned out that the "cropped-hair *xiucai*" Hu Ziming had also come to view results with several companions. He felt confident of success. Sure enough, there in the first row of the roster appeared his name: **Hu Ziming, Comprehensive Governance Office Clerical Position, Aptitude 32, Essay 80.**

This score placed him among the top examinees on the list, first for his position category. Hu Ziming was extremely pleased with himself. A group of former classmates crowded around to congratulate him. Having previously caught Australian favorable attention for "knowing how to handle affairs," and now with such outstanding examination results, he was implicitly becoming their leader. The dozen or so students who had taken the examination together surrounded him like stars orbiting the moon.

"Hmph, truly it's said that wealth in the mountains draws distant relatives, while poverty in the marketplace draws none!" Yuan Shuzhi secretly sneered. Having experienced every variety of human warmth and coldness, he most despised such behavior!

"Eh, isn't that Ajuan from the candle shop? You came to take the examination too?" A green-robed young man standing beside Hu Ziming spotted Zeng Juan nearby and called out. The entire group turned to look. Some who didn't know Zeng Juan nodded in polite acknowledgment. Others, observing his plain clothes and dejected expression and assuming he hadn't made the list, put on airs of superiority.

A former classmate who had maintained good relations with Zeng Juan approached with a delighted expression: "Ajuan, did you pass? I barely scraped in at the bottom—that was close!" This fellow was perpetually careless and hadn't noticed Zeng Juan's dark expression.

The green-robed man beside Hu Ziming spoke in a mocking tone: "I'm sure with Ajuan's mastery of Australian learning, passing was no problem whatsoever!" His accent was pure new-style Cantonese, which Yuan Shuzhi could barely understand. This person had apparently had some conflict with Zeng Juan at the academy. He had noticed Zeng Juan early and observed him for quite a while. Seeing his dejected appearance, he was now quite certain the fellow had failed, and wanted to thoroughly humiliate him before everyone assembled.

"*Ahem, ahem*... Fellow examinees, the sun grows scorching. Let's not linger here. Another day I shall host a dinner for everyone!" Yuan Shuzhi deliberately coughed several times and stepped forward to defuse the situation. He gave a perfunctory bow, intending to lead Zeng Juan away from this unpleasant scene.

The student who had first spoken wasn't about to release them so easily. His eyes rolled and he casually remarked to his companion: "Ajuan must have topped the list. The likes of us will never be worthy of his company from now on!"

Hearing this, Zeng Juan's face instantly darkened. He was at the breaking point—this was simply too much! He was about to rush forward and deliver a solid punch, if only to vent his frustration. But the more experienced Yuan Shuzhi grabbed his arm and gave him meaningful looks.

Yuan Shuzhi sized up this fellow with narrowed eyes: triangular eyes, several prominent pimples gleaming on his face, flower-patterned head ornament, green-patterned jacket, jade at his waist—the outfit slightly ostentatious. The family likely possessed some modest property and connections. From his experience, it wasn't difficult to guess this person harbored some grudge against Young Zeng.

"Isn't that the one who stole books from Shangqi... that whoever... surnamed Yuan, that's it—that's you!" The green-robed man thought for a moment and then declared loudly, as though he had discovered something remarkable.

They say when cursing someone, don't expose their shortcomings. Even Yuan Shuzhi's generally good temper couldn't prevent his expression from souring immediately.

Hu Ziming, who had been observing the escalating situation from the sidelines, quickly stepped in to smooth things over.

"Fellow scholars all came here to take the examination, surely harboring ambitions in your hearts. Why quarrel over momentary gains and losses? Starting a brawl at this cultured ground of the Tribute Courtyard—wouldn't that invite ridicule? I hope you might give me, Hu, some face and let bygones be bygones? Brother Yuan possesses considerable talent; how can we carelessly comment?" Saying this, he actually bowed toward Yuan Shuzhi and Zeng Juan, performing a ninety-degree bow with most proper attitude—though the contempt deep in his eyes was well-concealed!

The green-jacketed man bowed back with a smile: "Brother Hu is quite right. I wonder if these two great talents passed or not! Ahahaha!"

Yuan Shuzhi squinted up at the sky and said unhurriedly: "Unworthy as I am, the Senate did not reject me—I have the fortune to be among those on the red list!" Saying this, he even brushed off his long robe, feeling quite vindicated.

Everyone was startled. Hu Ziming immediately put on a smiling face: "Congratulations, congratulations!"

The green-jacketed man, unwilling to concede, pressed further: "And what about Zeng Juan?"

"Er..." Just as Yuan Shuzhi was about to claim that Zeng Juan had merely escorted him to the examination, someone in front shouted: "Quick, look—another roster is coming out!"

"Hahaha, I think Zeng Juan hasn't made the list!" The green-robed man's braying voice rang out again.

This time, neither Zeng Juan nor Yuan Shuzhi paid him any attention, for they observed two more guards carrying a roster on red silk backing. This roster was clearly thinner than the first. Zeng Juan's eyes lit up—there were still more names to post! When the guards finished pasting it up, everyone gathered once more beneath the notice, carefully searching for their names.

This roster contained far fewer names than the first—only about thirty in total. Everyone quickly realized that these examinees' scores ran somewhat higher than those on the first sheet, though only by several points. Some transitioned from grief to joy; others experienced fresh disappointment.

Just then, a piercing laugh rang out:

"Hahaha, didn't I say so! Zeng Juan hasn't made the list!" The green-robed man gloated.

Yuan Shuzhi caught a glimpse of him seemingly breathing a small sigh of relief as he mocked.

*A bunch of wretches who can't stand seeing others do better than themselves!* Yuan Shuzhi silently sneered.

Zeng Juan's name was still absent from this roster, but Wu Ming's name appeared: **Aptitude 61, Essay 81. Written examination overall ranking: 15th.**

Zeng Juan showed no expression this time. He had calmed down by now. Senior Wu was like him—well-versed in Australian books. Though Wu Ming's essay ability certainly exceeded his own, he possessed the review materials that Li Ziyu had given him, making his preparation more targeted. That *Two Hundred Essay Topics with True Solutions* book—there couldn't be more than a few copies in all of Guangzhou! He had studied it thoroughly, so his scores shouldn't run too low.

He carefully reviewed his examination performance in his mind: he was quite confident about the aptitude test—many questions he had either practiced from the review materials or encountered before in "Australian books." If there was any major loss of points, it would only be in the essay section.

But he had practiced his essays repeatedly as well. The Australians' question-setting wasn't tricky or strange. He had written according to the formulas in *Two Hundred Essay Topics*—it should have been methodical and steady. Even if he didn't score high, achieving above 60 shouldn't have posed a problem.

There was no reason his paper would... He waited, waited to verify his judgment, waited to slap those people's faces hard.

Sure enough, soon the third roster emerged. Three rosters now hung neatly in a row—and this final one contained only three names. Zeng Juan's name was prominently among them, listed first!

**Aptitude 79, Essay 80. First place for Tax Bureau Tax Source Management Position. First place overall in the civil service written examination!**

This immediately caused a sensation. Overall first place—wasn't that the equivalent of *huiyuan*?! Never mind the metropolitan examination; even the top scorer in the provincial examination—the *jieyuan*—represented an extraordinary figure.

The two characters "Zeng Juan" on the roster landed like a resounding slap across the faces of the green-robed man and others who had mocked him.

Overall first place—*smack*... *smack*—and especially loud!

The green-jacketed man looked as though he had swallowed something foul, staring wide-eyed at the roster as if trying to dissolve the characters through sheer force of gaze.

"This... this is impossible! They must have graded the papers wrong!" The green-robed man was hysterical.

"Dear brother, mind your words—beware that disaster comes from the mouth!" Hu Ziming warned.

In truth, the green-robed man simply couldn't accept this reality. Everyone knew the Australians were renowned for their rigor and efficiency. For such an important "talent selection ceremony," they maintained strict anti-cheating regulations and procedures—they couldn't possibly make such a low-level mistake as grading the wrong paper! Hadn't everyone observed that even collecting the papers didn't involve local people, but rather students brought in from Lingao!

Water flows downhill while people climb upward. Human nature was always to look up, not down. The group that had just been lording over everyone now instantly wore faces full of "friendly" smiles. By now no one bothered with the green-jacketed man anymore; they all crowded forward to congratulate Zeng Juan.

As the saying goes, you don't slap a smiling face. Though their behavior proved too calculating, they had at least observed proper etiquette. They would be working together as colleagues in the future—maintaining good relations with coworkers was something Zeng Juan understood. He possessed at least that much emotional intelligence!

Yuan Shuzhi was genuinely happy for Zeng Juan. Young Zeng was well-versed in Australian learning; placing first seemed only natural. After exchanging some auspicious words, suddenly a group of servants arrived, carrying groom's ceremonial attire. The one who appeared to be the butler stepped forward and clasped his fists: "Would this be Young Master Zeng?"

Zeng Juan nodded and returned the bow: "I am he. May I ask what business brings you here?"

"Would Young Master Zeng please come with us for a moment? Come now, help Young Master Zeng change into the auspicious robes!"

"You... what are you doing?" Zeng Juan was utterly bewildered. He observed that all the newcomers were smiling, with no fierce expressions. Personal safety wasn't a concern—who would dare commit crimes right under Australian noses? But what exactly was this about? His mind churned with questions. Yet no matter what he asked, these servants only kept repeating "Congratulations on your success, Master," while crowding around trying to get him to put on the ceremonial clothes.

Yuan Shuzhi suddenly slapped his thigh: "Catching a son-in-law from below the notice board!"
