# Chapter 1813 - Countermeasures

Seeing Old Man Fang off, Madam Han called in her two "Guardian Generals" and also had the pimp headman Huang Xiang summoned.

Huang Xiang was also from a pleasure-house family. Somewhat literate, he had been "famous for a time" as a boy singer, quite favored by literati and gentry. But after his voice changed he never recovered. His once-slender build mysteriously became thick and powerful. Unable to either "sell craft" or "sell body," he had only mixed work in the establishments thereafter.

Because he had been "raised as female" from childhood, forcefully bent into someone who could only arch his rear to receive. Toward women he was instead incapable. Madam Han found such "powder folk" more reliable to use—at least she didn't need to worry about him messing around with the prostitutes.

Though Huang Xiang was merely a "powder folk" supervisor in the establishment, he was an extremely clever and sharp-witted person. He served as half a manager, in effect, in this Fangchun Pleasure House.

After coming in and paying respects, Madam Han sat stony-faced without speaking for a long while. The three didn't dare speak either, only standing on the floor waiting.

Madam Han wasn't intentionally putting on airs. She was genuinely troubled about the current situation and didn't know what to do.

"These plague-bringing Australians!" she cursed silently. The times had changed. She suddenly felt somewhat lost. Things that used to be routine now had to be carefully reconsidered—she hadn't yet figured out the new official masters' thinking.

What concerned her most were the five or six little girls being trained under Muyun. The eldest was already twelve, a *pipa* girl who could take work slips and receive clients. Though these girls' talents weren't top-grade, proper training would eventually yield patrons willing to pay for "combing." Each one meant at least three or four hundred taels income. If well-trained and the patron generous, a thousand taels was possible.

By rights, such small girls should be most worry-free. Young and living in the establishment—all had been beaten into submission. But several of these children still had family. If those families learned about this ordinance, there'd certainly be trouble-making and complaints. One girl's uncle in particular was an utterly disreputable rogue who would certainly come making scenes to extort money.

In former days she naturally wouldn't have feared. But now in this era of regime change, privately-motivated vendettas and false accusations proliferated. People ruined families and lives over such things routinely. The Fangchun House had operated here for years. Setting aside grudges and resentments, the wealth alone was enough to make people envious.

After a long while she finally spoke: "You all know about it—the Australians have a new ordinance now." She hesitated. "We don't really know the Australians' true nature or which way they actually lean. But as I see it, officials are probably all the same. The Australians just took the city—they've got ambitions of conquering the realm, so they're bound to exercise diligence for a while. Even new officials need three fires when they take office. So we need to accommodate them somewhat. On the surface we need to muddle through—and we shouldn't make things too hard for Old Man Fang."

The three naturally agreed—after all, Madam Han was the establishment's backbone.

"It's just that several clauses in this ordinance involving body-sale contracts—we can't let the girls find out about them." Madam Han said. "If this isn't handled well, this business of ours might as well close up shop."

Huang Xiang said: "Mother, this matter probably can't be kept secret. Even if we seal our lips tight, there'll always be loose-tongued patrons. The girls will find out sooner or later."

Madam Han nodded: "I know this is only a delaying tactic. But delaying for a moment gives time to prepare." She pondered, then said: "For now, never mind those 'self-employed' ones in the establishment. All those who've sold their bodies outright—within the next few days must write out loan contracts: interest can't be high, but principal must be high. High enough to crush any thoughts they might have."

"This 'false money, real contract'—the girls probably won't agree to write it. They're not stupid. Who takes on debt for no reason?" Muyun worried.

Madam Yao said: "If they won't write it, so what? First give her 'full blossom' beating, then make her kneel holding incense. Whenever she's willing to write, she can get up! Anyone who's not tactful gets dragged to the back for some sesame oil!"

Muyun said: "Madam Yao, using force—sure, it'll get done. But this is 'false money, real contract' after all, with no leg to stand on. These are troubled times. Many things are better left alone. Push too hard, and if the girls get instigated to make trouble together, taking it to court—we're already in the wrong, and now without backing. There'll be lawsuits to fight!"

Madam Han, hearing Muyun's words, also felt she had a point. Now times were volatile. Though closing the establishment's gates made inside seem no different from before, with her still the unchallenged mistress—still, winds from the storm outside had somewhat blown in. This "ordinance" was one example.

If she pushed the girls too hard and they made trouble, who knew what complications might arise.

She'd actually rather the Australians come collect some taxes—before, the government didn't levy taxes, but there were plenty of deities collecting offerings in every direction. As long as they didn't meddle in her affairs.

Thinking this way, she became hesitant again. Just then Huang Xiang spoke: "Mother, in this humble one's view, we needn't have the girls write loan contracts. I just looked through the ordinance carefully. In my humble opinion, why not go openly? Gather the girls together and say that from now on, even those who've sold themselves outright—earnings from receiving clients will be split with the house..."

These words barely out, before Madam Han could respond, Madam Yao had already jumped out: "Brother Huang, I think lard has greased your heart! Split earnings—that's only for 'self-employed' girls! If the whole establishment did this, how would Mother make a living?!"

Madam Han also found this idea preposterous. She didn't speak, just watching how this pimp would explain himself.

Huang Xiang was unruffled: "Now that we're splitting, they become people with wages. The room and board the establishment provides, the servant girls attending them... which of these doesn't cost money? Even if Mother doesn't nickel-and-dime them, they'd be embarrassed to freeload, wouldn't they?"

At these words, everyone suddenly understood. Right, before—except for "self-employed" prostitutes with patrons—all the others' client fees belonged to the madam. The girls, besides pilfering private money from patrons, had no income. Food, clothing, and supplies were naturally provided by the madam. Now splitting meant making earnings—but these prostitutes' every tea and meal, every soup and water, down to the clothes they wore, the bedding they slept on, the lamp wax they burned, the rooms they lived in... all of this could be itemized and priced to them. Be a bit ruthless, and what the girls got from their split wouldn't even cover expenses.

"...If not enough, no matter. Mother is most benevolent. They can owe—just charge a little interest. As long as it's not usurious gouging, the Australians probably can't say anything." Huang Xiang bowed ingratiatingly with his sycophantic smile.

Such things weren't unprecedented in establishments. Some "self-employed" prostitutes without patron backing, operating entirely on their own—this was exactly how they were ultimately coerced into complete body-sales.

Madam Han's brow immediately relaxed. She patted Huang Xiang's head with a smile: "You little rabbit, so that's your game! How didn't I think of it!"

"It's Mother's benevolence..."

"Nonsense! Benevolence edible?" Madam Han curled her lip. "Just do it your way!"

The group discussed the method. Madam Han dismissed Huang Xiang and Muyun, leaving only Madam Yao. Then she quietly asked: "How's the girl in the back courtyard doing?"

Madam Yao, perfectly understanding, whispered: "Still refusing. But her words don't sound so chaste and virtuous anymore." She smiled smugly. "If Mother hadn't been so kind and not let me use too many methods, I'd have had her on her knees begging for clients long ago!"

Madam Han nodded slightly: "Your methods I know. But though she's a widow, she's still intact. And being from a good family—if trained properly, patrons willing to 'comb' her could fetch us quite a windfall. So first: no letting the powder folk spoil her. Second: don't torment her too much. Scars left on her body wouldn't look nice."

Forcing decent women into prostitution involved both soft and hard methods. The soft ones aside—the hard ones: first, having the pimps rape her, destroying her chastity and breaking her psychological defenses. Second, using torture and beatings until she couldn't endure the suffering. Meanwhile, close watch to prevent suicide. Torment her until she wanted neither to live nor to die, then deploy gentle methods—carrot after stick—this alternating hard and soft, tight and loose. Very few women could escape.

However, this full treatment had to be used cautiously on women who were still virgins—defiling them meant no patron could "comb" them, costing the madam a fortune. Excessive beating leaving scars on their skin would likewise devalue them. Pleasure houses after all were "high society entertainment venues" of that era. Such shameful matters, however well-known, couldn't be so blatantly displayed.

The Fangchun House had experienced such incidents before. So Madam Yao was especially careful about this.

"I understand. So I've stationed two people to watch her day and night. The ropes aren't entirely untied. It's just this girl has an extremely violent temper. Without giving her some suffering, she probably won't appreciate Mother's kindness." She saw Madam Han still hesitating, and added: "You just rest easy, Mother. You know my few little tricks, don't you? Guaranteed no scars left on her body!"

Madam Han said: "Your tricks I know. I'm just worried—" She explained the ordinance's requirement about prostitutes having to volunteer. "Though Old Man Fang has patted his chest, it still feels unreliable. If she really has to go to the police station, or register in front of Australian cadres for a license, and she makes a scene right there—what then?"

Madam Yao heard this was her concern. She too hesitated: "If that's the case, it's a bit hard to handle—she's got no attachments, no leverage to use against her. Let me think of a foolproof method..."
