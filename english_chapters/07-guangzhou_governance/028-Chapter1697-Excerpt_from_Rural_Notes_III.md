# Chapter 1697 - Excerpt from Rural Notes III

After visiting the farmers in the village, I felt that the work in this village was still on the soft side, and many tasks were not implemented in place. Old Huo has good popularity in the village, but insufficient prestige. Villagers universally say he is "easy to talk to."

Having good popularity and being easy to talk to should technically be advantages, but in grassroots rural work, this is instead a weakness. The fact that many policies were not implemented in place in Tankou fully illustrates that the "governing consciousness" of grassroots cadres is insufficient. In the execution of policies, failure to implement and distortion are universally existing problems.

I learned that Old Huo and most villagers came from several villages close to each other in Huang County, and quite a few people in the village are relatives or old acquaintances. This relationship causes the existence of "considering human feelings" and "feeling embarrassed because of being fellow villagers" in specific work. This is a problem that needs to be focused on and overcome in our education and training of grassroots cadres. Grassroots cadres should talk less about human feelings and more about principles. Especially in implementing policies, they should strive towards being uncompromising.

During the visit, I discovered a relatively large-scale breeding farm by the village, with "Heaven and Earth Society Intensive Pig Farm Project" written on the wall. It occupies more than ten mu. However, it has not been put into use. A rusted lock barred the door. I asked Old Huo to open the door, and walking in, I saw it was full of wild grass and trash inside, without a single building, only a big pit said to be prepared for building a biogas digester, now full of accumulated water.

Old Huo seemed to have some dissatisfaction with this too, "The county told us to do this. The county allocated a part of the funds first to set up the framework, saying this way it would be easier to strive for Heaven and Earth Society projects. As a result, the village's self-raised portion couldn't be collected fully. Our village is an economically weak village; it's too hard to ask everyone to raise funds. In the end, the matter fizzled out and was left here."

This shut-tight project illustrates from one aspect that the success rate of Heaven and Earth Society agricultural projects in previous years was not very high. Some projects were poorly managed and operated, causing waste of investment and loss of assets. I feel that the reason some of our comrades had good intentions but didn't accomplish good deeds is mainly because two problems are often ignored: first, how government investment projects can be transformed into collective economic entities; second, how farmer cooperative economic organizations can undertake government investment projects. I discussed with comrades in the county that we must find every way to "activate" these unsuccessful projects to exert their function and form benefits as much as possible.

In the afternoon, the sun became bigger and bigger. Three or four people wearing straw sandals (local masses are usually barefoot on weekdays), red armbands, and bamboo hats walked from outside the village. One of them was even a policeman. It turned out these people came from the township to the village to inspect health and epidemic prevention work. While talking, one of them recognized me; he was the village head of Borang Village whom I had met before. This cadre was temporarily drafted to participate in the town-wide inspection of Longtang Town. He was very surprised to see me and turned back to criticize Old Huo, "A Central Chief has come, why didn't you report to the county?" Old Huo apologized repeatedly. I said, "Don't blame Old Huo, I forbade him from telling you."

Since the comrades in Longtang Town knew I was here, I might as well go to the town government to do some research. The road from Tankou to Longtang Town is not far, only three kilometers, and we arrived after walking a short distance. The main cadres of the town had all gone to neighboring villages to go to the countryside. What I was most concerned about was farmers' production and income. I found the cadre responsible for statistics in the town, checked some statistical reports, and asked about relevant situations.

To tell the truth, the town's statistical work is done poorly; reports are incomplete and filing is messy. This also further reflects our current situation of severe lack of qualified grassroots cadres.

I learned about the statistical methods. The responsible comrade told me: statistics on immigrant village farmers' income mainly come from two channels: sampling surveys by the Rural Investigation Team and level-by-level reporting by villages and townships. On one hand, the sampling scope is small, and data coverage is poor; on the other hand, data reported by townships and even counties and cities are easily subject to human interference. For example, to launch high-yield "satellites" and strive for advanced "Red Flags," data would be intentionally inflated.

This was also expected. Regarding problems existing in this aspect, the agricultural department is designing a new target assessment system, focusing on strengthening the policy orientation of increasing farmers' income and striving to improve the accuracy of statistical data.

About more than an hour later, several main naturalized cadres of the town returned to the town office in a hurry; obviously, comrades in the town had reported the news to them. This discounted my idea of "not disturbing officials."

I said to them, "You go quickly and get busy. My staying in the village this time is to experience rural life personally, not to cause trouble for grassroots comrades, let alone need your accompaniment." Several cadres still wanted to accompany me for dinner in the town. I said, "If you really want to accompany me, then come tonight when the villager symposium is held to discuss the plan for doubling farmers' income. We will dissect the 'Shandong Sparrow' of Tankou Village together."

My landlord for tonight is also surnamed Huo. Dinner had a bit more "content" than lunch. Besides rice and sweet potato meal, there was dried fish. Without anyone accompanying, the farm meal tasted delicious no matter what.

At 6:30 pm, the symposium was held in the central room of the farmer's household where I lived. The landlord specially borrowed an Australian oil lamp from the village office, illuminating a room full of people. Although tired for a day, everyone's spirits were high. Villagers spoke enthusiastically. They all reflected that coming south from Shandong was the great grace of the Senate, and they wanted to work hard to repay it.

Regarding how to develop the countryside, most of them said the climate and soil in Shandong and Hainan are different, and they are not good at rice planting, needing support from the Heaven and Earth Society. But there are too few Heaven and Earth Society agricultural technicians, coming not even once or twice a month, and crops won't wait for people when encountering problems! Some people have already developed blind trust in Heaven and Earth Society technology, wanting to ask the Heaven and Earth Society to help solve everything. Some villagers reflected that it's too hot here in summer, with many mosquitoes, and many people suffer from malaria. Although the town health center provides free medicine, going to town to get medicine is troublesome, asking if health workers can be sent for mobile treatment. Concerning the farmer mutual aid associations being promoted by the Heaven and Earth Society and engaging in intensive farms, villagers had quite a few questions, both policy-wise and economic.

I could roughly understand the local dialect spoken by the villagers. It seemed the villagers' greatest concerns focused on two aspects: First, after the establishment of the Agricultural Association, is the land joined into the association still their own? Second, in intensive management, how is harvest distribution calculated?

From these two points, everyone is interested in increasing income through intensive management. The farm households in this village generally have low economic ability. Although they have achieved "warmth and fullness," the level is relatively low, and the proportion of households using "melon and vegetable substitutes" is large. The motivation to improve the status quo is instead greater than in several model villages and advanced villages.

At the meeting, everyone discussed many issues about how to produce better. Whether it is intensive management or engaging in sideline businesses, after much discussion, the hardest part is the lack of startup capital. Each family basically has no savings. There were very many mosquitoes and insects at night. I asked the guard to give each fellow villager a bottle of floral water, and they were very happy.

The symposium went on until past 10 pm, with occasional arguments and occasional laughter. Village cadres and villagers formed a consensus on grasping production and promoting development. I promised to help Tankou Village coordinate the implementation of the water pump installation project and do the supporting engineering for the Thousand Women Embankment as soon as possible. The task of grasping the implementation of these two projects in the next step is quite heavy.

This was a big sunny day.

At past 4 am, the gong for going to work sounded in the village. We ate breakfast with the landlord, rice porridge plus salted vegetables. After the meal, I paid two days' board fees according to regulations.

My staying in the village this time covered both a specific point and a broader surface. At past 8 am, I came out of Tankou and started to take a boat along the river to conduct surface research on three other villages in Longtang Town. Near noon, I arrived at Meibao Village. Because the town mayor researched with us, lunch even included a small plate of "Heavenly Kitchen Pickles" produced in Lingao, probably bought temporarily from Qiongshan. This meal was not as comfortable as those meals in Tankou; with someone accompanying the meal, even arranged meals changed flavor.

Six kilometers east from Meibao Village, I arrived at the area of the Tropical Crops Institute in the original timeline. From the Great Library's materials, I found and read some development materials of the Tropical Crops Institute, and its Qingfeng Class, Team 6, Team 4, Team 1, and Right Reform Class.

Here, I unexpectedly met students from the Senate Communist Youth League Cadre Training Class. After talking with the leading Senator Lin Ziqi, I learned they were conducting field inspections, which is an important course of the Senate Communist Youth League Cadre Training Class.

"Although the students are almost all children of peasant families, they rarely leave their own villages, even rarely going to the town," Lin Ziqi told me. "Such inspections help them broaden their horizons and increase their knowledge."

They had already inspected Qiongshan for a week. The next location is to go to Wenchang, compare the similarities and differences of the natural and social environments of the two places, and make an inspection report.

Seeing these young boys and girls full of thirst for knowledge, I deeply felt that our future rests on them.

After bidding farewell to the students, I climbed Lingjiao Ridge and made sketches of the landscape of the Tropical Crops Institute area. After finishing, I came to a spring said to be famous since the Song Dynasty, where women were washing clothes by the spring. I asked, "Was the spring water in the past bigger than now?"

They scrambled to say that when they were young, the spring water was much bigger than this. When they were young, which was the Wanli era, it never snowed on Hainan Island. Since the Tianqi era, the weather in winter has become colder and colder, and it actually snowed. The spring water is not much either.

Standing by the spring, my feeling of the extreme climate of the Little Ice Age at the end of the Ming Dynasty deepened. If Hainan can feel the extreme climate, how terrible must it be in the Nine Borders region! Thus I became more determined and confident in accelerating the development of modern agriculture and building a disaster prevention and relief system.

The sun was about to set. I bid farewell to the fellow villagers and took a boat back to Qiongshan by the Nandu River. This stay in the village for two days and one night was short in time but great in harvest. Goodbye Tankou! Goodbye Longtang! I will come again in a few days, striving to help Tankou implement rural development into reality.
