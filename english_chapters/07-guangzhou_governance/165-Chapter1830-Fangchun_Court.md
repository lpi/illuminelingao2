# Chapter 1830 - Fangchun Court

Temple Keeper Fang could only nod repeatedly, saying, "I know, I know. I wouldn't dare violate your rules, Officer! I was confused! Which houses are checking today? This small one will lead the way."

"We'll just look around randomly. Whichever one I point to, we check."

"Yes, yes." Old Man Fang's heart drummed nervously. Just a few days ago, he had helped register a temporary residence permit for a new girl at Fangchun Court. Registering a temporary residence permit didn't require the person to be present; with his status as the local Baojia head, going to the police station to report it wasn't difficult. The difficult part was how to make her "voluntary."

The contents of the "Guangzhou Special City Custom Industry Management Regulations" had now spread through Lefang Street. Originally, the madams and managers wanted to block the news, but the Public Security Section sent people directly. Not only did they post notices everywhere on Legfang Street, but they also pasted them on the spirit wall inside the main gate of every brothel, warning against tearing them down. They also conducted surprise spot checks from time to time. A few days ago, a brothel madam was arrested for secretly tearing down a notice and sentenced to whipping. Thirty lashes tore her skin and flesh, not to mention a fine of five hundred taels of silver.

Compared to the whip wounds on their buttocks, the five-hundred-tael fine was what truly made the madams feel heart-wrenching pain. Naturally, no one dared to tear down the notices anymore. Pasting notices wasn't enough; soon, people from the yamen came to gather the girls for "lectures." For a time, the contents of these regulations became known to everyone.

Thus, the hearts of people in the brothels became unsettled. Although the madams' prestige from years of dominance remained, and no prostitute dared to stand up and discuss personal freedom and treatment with the brothel yet, the entire atmosphere had changed. The madams and managers restrained themselves considerably; incidents of beating the whole house or casually beating prostitutes became much rarer.

Under such circumstances, making Miss He "voluntarily" become a prostitute was excessively difficult. Old Man Fang had originally found a "connection"—as long as the madam "handled" the girl, and she didn't shout "unwilling" on the spot when receiving the Yellow Ticket, it would pass.

But now the wind was blowing so tight, Old Man Fang didn't dare take the risk. He reckoned that with all government matters, they were always strict at the start and naturally became lax after a while. It was better to lie low for now. If the woman didn't get a Yellow Ticket, she couldn't receive guests. At most, she would eat Sister Han Qiao's rice for a few months, which meant nothing to the brothel. Besides, Sister Han Qiao's plan was to find a wealthy guest to "comb her hair" (take her virginity/debut), so they could afford to wait and spend more time training her.

The police running to Lefang Street every few days—could they have sniffed out something? Things weren't like before; he had no acquaintances in the yamen anymore. Even the few who were retained didn't dare speak to him casually.

Old Man Fang was suspicious but piled a smile on his face to greet them along the way.

It was currently noon, the most leisurely time. Brothels customarily didn't open to welcome guests until the afternoon. At this moment, apart from some girls who had been "overworked" last night, most had just gotten up. They lazily pushed open attic windows to stretch, hair slightly messy, brows charming. Though without powder and makeup, they possessed a unique allure. Their stomachers half-covered and half-revealed them, creating an interesting contrast with the green trees and red flowers outside the window.

As the group walked through this land of fireworks, the prostitutes gathered at the windows instantly scattered like birds and beasts, dropping their curtains one after another. The male servants, cleaning women, and madams of the major houses poked their heads out, wondering what fit the Australians were throwing this time, silently praying to gods and Buddhas that the Australian constables wouldn't come in.

Li Ziyu looked neither sideways nor askance, leading his men straight past these houses to the main gate of Fangchun Court. He pointed at the gate: "This one!"

Old Man Fang secretly groaned. Fangchun Court was exactly the place causing his "psychological illness." He hadn't expected the police to pick this one first.

Saying no was naturally impossible. He could only rely on Sister Han Qiao's adaptability.

The "doormen" sitting at the gate monitoring the entrance saw the police coming and sprang up from their stools. One hurriedly came forward to pay respects and say hello, while the other quietly turned and walked toward the back.

Li Ziyu first glanced at the regulation notice pasted on the spirit wall to ensure there was no damage or defacement. Only then did he walk slowly inside. Before they even reached the main hall, Sister Han Qiao came out to welcome them, her face beaming with spring breeze: "Oh my, it's Master Yu! And Master Zhao! What wind blew the two of you here?" As she spoke, she gave a deep curtsey.

Li Ziyu was secretly surprised. He and Zhao Gui had only been to Fangchun Court once, tagging along during a raid with other old police officers as inconspicuous followers. He hadn't expected this madam to remember not only him but also the extremely low-presence Zhao Gui. She could even call out their names.

In these gold-squandering dens where people were welcomed and sent off, sizing people up was key. Remembering people was a basic skill. Especially for important figures—even if unseen for years, as long as the madam or girl from that time was still there, they could call out the name upon appearance.

Li Ziyu said, "Since you recognize us, I won't stand on ceremony. We are here for a routine inspection. You need not fear. Great Song civil servants do not take a single needle or thread from the people. Have all the girls here gather in the courtyard. I've brought common soldiers; it wouldn't be good to offend the beauties!"

Sister Han Qiao knew this group came prepared and evasion wouldn't work. She reckoned her "house" hadn't violated Australian laws. The few "Pipa Zai" (trainees) had been cleared and registered during the last inspection. Only He Xiaoyue remained locked in the back courtyard, not yet disposed of. But very few people knew about her presence in Fangchun Court. The police couldn't possibly have come specifically for her.

Feeling somewhat settled, she forced a smile: "Hehehe, what are you saying? Since Master Yu wants to inspect, this is official business; this slave naturally should comply. But several girls haven't gotten up yet. Please trouble Master Yu to sit in the hall for a moment; this slave will send people to call them immediately." After speaking, she curtseyed and stepped back, calling Huang Xiang and Sister-in-law Yao, who were waiting on the side, to summon all the prostitutes.

"Call the Pipa Zai too; the officers want to inspect!" She gave a wink to Sister-in-law Yao as she spoke. Turning back, she led the group inside with a face full of smiles.

This was Li Ziyu's first time entering such a high-end brothel. Although formerly possessing a "family background" thanks to his uncle's protection, his monthly allowance wasn't enough to spend in such a high-end venue. Moreover, he was young then, and since his uncle had no son, Li Ziyu was considered the heir to two branches and was strictly managed. So even if he had occasional dalliances, he dared not enter such a lavish place of romance. After becoming a police officer, although he had followed others here for inspections, he had only stood guard in the courtyard and hadn't entered the main hall. Naturally, he had no "experience." Now, his eyes were finally opened.

Fangchun Court was worthy of being a gold-squandering den flocked to by the princes and nobles of Guangzhou City. The sheer size of the grounds was jaw-dropping. Just inside the gate stood a huge Australian marble spirit wall, beautifully carved. A large character for "Fortune" danced like a dragon and flew like a phoenix, clearly from the hand of a master. Bypassing the spirit wall, what appeared before the eyes were eighteen carved pillars supporting the eaves, corner beams, and winged corners. It was a three-story pavilion. Every window and door panel was inlaid with Australian glass. The moon beams were hollowed out and carved into a detailed "Banquet at Yaochi." The hanging fascia featured traditional "Hui" patterns, with auspicious clouds carved at the joints. Large red lanterns hung on the verandas of every floor. One could imagine the golden brilliance at night.

The courtyard was large, paved with blue bricks. Every three steps on both sides stood a pot of rich peonies, blooming brightly. A stage towered in the center of the courtyard. A huge flower bud made of folded colored silk hung above the stage. Two veranda corridors flanked the left and right, leading to unknown places.

With no time to look in detail, Sister Han Qiao led the two into the flower hall to sit. Maidservants immediately served fragrant tea. Sister Han Qiao offered the tea, saying, "This is this year's pre-rain Maojian tea."

Unfortunately, Li Ziyu was no tea drinker, and Zhao Gui knew absolutely nothing about it. Both took a sip, but neither appreciated the subtlety within.

Sister Han Qiao secretly cursed the two as "bumpkins." In the past, characters like constables and yamen runners, even headmen, weren't qualified to sit in the flower hall of Fangchun Court. Those who came here were high officials and nobles; how could a lowly runner sit here? The runners themselves knew their place and mostly talked in the inner hall where the madam handled affairs. Today, she not only invited them to sit in the flower hall but also served top-grade tea, yet they didn't even offer a single "good tea" praise.

Now that her patrons were all shrinking back and "biding their time," she had to let these petty officials run rampant!

She kept a smiling face and chatted with Li Ziyu. Madams were mostly former prostitutes, especially those from brothels like Sister Han Qiao. They had learned a set of conversation skills since childhood. As long as you weren't mute, they could chat even with the most boring and dull person.

While they drank tea and chatted, the courtyard became lively with the chirping of orioles and swallows. The prostitutes of the house were all called to gather.

Such a gathering wasn't the first time, so the prostitutes assumed it was another "lecture."

They naturally already knew the content of the regulations being preached. However, for the time being, no one dared to take it seriously. People who ate "brothel rice" weren't kindly souls; they had their own skills in suppressing and deceiving people. The prostitutes were either currently "red" (popular) or "combed" (supported by a patron)—the "privileged class" of the house. Not only were they not mistreated, but the madam, managers, and fierce servants (beans-and-water) had to flatter them. Naturally, they had no thought of "rebelling." Or their "business" was ordinary, and beatings and scoldings were daily fare, but they had been beaten into submission and dared not stand out under the madam's long-term tyranny. Even if they had the heart, they feared the Australian yamen and the madam were in cahoots. So they were somewhat perfunctory about this lecture.

Li Ziyu watched more and more people arrive but didn't see Mingnu. He felt anxious. He wanted to ask, but remembered Gao Chongjiu's reminder: everything must stand on "official business." So he suppressed his emotions, picked up his teacup, drank slowly, and scrutinized the group in the courtyard.
