# Chapter 1969 - A Nearly Perfect Conclusion

In Zhang Xiaoqi's view, this was already a simplified process that could not be simplified further. Although she had earlier proposed the requirement of remitting tax funds within 48 hours, subconsciously she still wanted tax funds not to stay overnight in the hall. As long as there was no money, a lot of trouble could be reduced. So she grasped the progress of the summarization link very tightly, personally staring in the Tax Accounting Room with Nan Wan'er, hoping to complete the summarization early and send today's tax funds to Delong quickly.

Yao Yulan was sweating a bit. She and Liu Cui were responsible for the final verification of tax funds. Now others were already resting and chatting, but on her side, no matter how she calculated, the account had a surplus of over 400 yuan.

Liu Cui wanted to report to the Chief from the start, but she held her back. She didn't want to alert the Chief too early. First, she had to be sure she hadn't made a calculation error. Second, if she wasn't wrong, then one of the sisters ahead was wrong. she didn't really want to be the bad guy. She hoped to calculate and compare from various registers to pick out this household, then let them re-verify and register. But before she finished calculating, Zhang Xiaoqi discovered the anomaly, walked over and asked, "What's wrong?"

"Report to Chief!" Caught off guard, the conditioned reflex formed from long-term training in the Political Security Bureau made her stand up immediately and answer with full breath: "The account has a surplus of 421 yuan."

"Okay, sit down. Let's have a look." Zhang Xiaoqi was startled. This Yao Yulan—Wu Mu and others had given her a memo about her—was a "hidden cadre." Born into a standard naturalized citizen family, her parents had actively defected to the Senate. Theoretically, her political rating should be very high, but she was now a "hidden cadre"—according to her husband Wang Qiyi's deduction, it might be because she wasn't suitable for professional political security work.

This girl had a somewhat haughty personality. Wang Qiyi didn't like her and sent her here, euphemistically calling it strengthening supervision during the tax collection process. Zhang Xiaoqi didn't pick up an abacus but called all the girls over, taking this opportunity to explain the simplest error correction on the spot. Business wasn't heavy today; she estimated this surplus was likely just a mistake in registering a certain tax category for one taxpayer household in the register. No big problem. So after explaining the method, she let them verify it themselves. She didn't intend to criticize anyone. In her view, these girls were already outstanding. One had to know that before this, let alone using abacuses and making tables, few of them even had a tiny bit of cultural foundation.

The entire tax fund summarization work went fairly smoothly. Including voucher closing reports, everything was completed before 4 PM.

"Nan Wan'er, go to the duty room and see if the people from Qiewei have arrived. If they've registered, notify them to prepare to load the vehicle for Delong."

Since tax funds were still primarily cash at this stage, daily tax fund remittance became a big problem. Back in Lingao, Ai Zhixin had planned a "Tax Police Corps" imitating the National Uncle's path, but unfortunately, it was shot down along with Wudaokou's "Vault Guard Company" and "Financial People's Commissariat Special Service Bureau." The reason was "The Senate does not approve of departments starting their own kitchens and doing their own thing. The construction of strong-arm agencies must be unified in approach and planned as a whole. Shan Daoqian's Traffic Court and Traffic Police aren't allowed either. You guys blatantly wanting to grasp gun barrels—is that acceptable?"

However, the daily escort of large amounts of cash had to be solved. Relying solely on the Fubo Army and National Army was obviously unrealistic; both belonged to the military and might have mobilization drills even without combat missions. Not to mention applying for dispatch required coordination with the military. Even if they could be deployed, if a different group came for every escort, Delong and the Tax Bureau would probably go crazy. Later, the National Police took over this plate. Each escort adopted the method of "advance application, nearby assignment," jointly escorted by the Police Mobile Unit and the local police station.

But this method was actually still inconvenient. It also involved coordination issues between both sides. Finally, utilizing the opportunity of Qiewei Escort Bureau restructuring into a comprehensive security company, Qiewei stepped forward to form an armed escort team.

The team was nominally under Qiewei Security but actually under the jurisdiction of government departments at all levels, mainly the Finance Province. It could only engage in escort business and did not have law enforcement powers. This finally solved the problem of transporting large amounts of cash for Delong and the Finance and Tax Bureau; simultaneously, it solved the placement problem for those veterans in the troops with poorer abilities who had no room for advancement whether in the army or discharged to localities.

The escort team assigned to the Finance and Tax Bureau in Guangzhou city was a small squad, with eleven people and two specially modified Red Flag carriages. Escort personnel were all equipped with shotguns, only wearing blue uniforms—dyed with the most common local indigo dye—with two huge Song typeface characters "Qiewei" on the back.

Originally Ai Zhixin had also applied for a dedicated cash transport vehicle, but after calculating potential daily tax amounts, Cheng Dong suppressed the application: "Save costs for the revolution. If you really encounter large tax amounts, borrowing from Delong temporarily will be in time."

Today's tax funds, excluding checks, didn't even fill the smallest money box with the received cash, so there was no need for the escort team to help move it. After interfering with the lock code, Zhang Xiaoqi took Nan Wan'er and three others onto the carriage. The amount today wasn't much and checks were the majority, so they didn't remit to the Delong Bank vault at Da Shijie but directly to the Guangzhou Branch. The Guangzhou Branch wasn't far from the Salt Administration Office. The five women had just warmed up the topic of the latest trendy dresses in Lingao when Zhang Xiaoqi saw the Delong sign.

Just as the carriage steadied, Meng Xian came up to greet them: "Director Zhang, Sister Zhang, was I timely?"

"Thank you, thank you President Meng for personally coming to welcome us."

"Look at you saying that. This is the first serious tax payment of our Great Song. How could I not come for a newly opened business? Besides, even without this, just for you, Elder Sister, coming, I have to keep you company." Meng Xian had long shed the appearance of a fresh university graduate after years in Guangzhou, becoming increasingly slick. Ushering them inside, Meng Xian meant for the two to find a quiet place to drink tea and chat, leaving the tax remittance work to specific personnel. After all, the process had been simplified to the extreme, so naturalized citizen cadres should have no problem. But Zhang Xiaoqi insisted on watching on site, looking worried. Precisely *because* it was simplified to the extreme, Zhang Xiaoqi was more worried. When discussing with Meng Xian earlier, he stated he was from a finance background and wasn't particularly clear about the twists and turns of the finance and tax system, so he could help review, but Zhang Xiaoqi had to make the plan herself.

Nan Wan'er helped the Delong teller unload the tax funds from the carriage, waited for Zhang Xiaoqi to unlock the combination lock, and both sides counted the total amount together, then signed the transfer slip. Then she took out the Summary Payment Slip from her satchel and handed it to Delong staff. Delong staff first totaled the amounts on each Summary Payment Slip, then compared it with the tax funds on the transfer slip. After matching, they began registering the amount of each Summary Payment Slip and taking in the tax funds. After completion, they stamped the Remittance Received seal on all plies of the Summary Payment Slip and returned the first ply (Tax Authority Remittance Ply) to Nan Wan'er.

"Director Nan, this is the remittance receipt. Please come to collect the treasury entry receipt at a suitable time tomorrow."

"Done?" Meng Xian leaned over and asked.

"Chief Meng, our business here is temporarily finished," Nan Wan'er replied respectfully.

"President Meng, the business on your side isn't finished. Don't forget what I agreed with you: remittance is remittance, treasury entry is treasury entry. For treasury income, both remittance account income and expenditure must be done. Don't mix them up again. Also, the second ply is the Remittance Bank Retention Ply, and the third ply is the Entry Treasury Retention Ply. Bind these two separately; don't lose them. Tell your people to have the fourth ply ready; we'll come for it early tomorrow morning..."

"Alright, alright, no problem Director Zhang. I'll immediately keep a close eye on them to do it right now. Good, good, good..." Seeing Zhang Xiaoqi about to start nagging mode again, Meng Xian didn't politely ask her to stay for dinner and hurriedly sent this big sister out the door. He thought to himself that when this middle-aged woman started nagging, it was truly endless.

Rushing back to the Collection Hall without stopping, it was already close to off-work time. Zhang Xiaoqi gave some instructions and went with Nan Wan'er to the back of the hall, to the Tax Statistics Division inside the Bureau courtyard. Now the front desk business was over, but the Tax Statistics Division's work had just begun. The eight head-to-head desks in the office were full. At a glance, the ones with the fastest progress were obviously Xu Zhewei and Li Hongyu responsible for vouchers. Because the organization was currently simple with few personnel and hall/treasury combined, the work pressure on the voucher accountant in the Bureau agency was very small. They only needed to do outbound registration when the Hall voucher accountant came to claim new tax receipts, and do monthly closing according to the Hall accountant's closing manual at month-end. So the two also moonlighted in tax fund ledger registration and tax receipt write-off work.

"Director Zhang." Seeing Zhang Xiaoqi walking towards them, Xu Zhewei immediately stood up. He was a standard Shandong bloke, around 20 years old, looking very distinct in a roomful of girls. LIke the vast majority of Shandong people under Australian Song rule, he was also "booty" from the Engine Operation. In Lingao, Xu Zhewei first met his former young master Wang Xinglong and cousin Wang Jinchun, later worked in a factory, and then because he could read and calculate, was recommended into the vocational school finance and tax class when Cheng Dong was grabbing people everywhere. Now he had become a cadre. The series of changing circumstances in a few short years often gave him an unreal feeling. Like now, talking to a real Chief under the gaze of a roomful of girls.

"Sit, everyone sit." Seeing everyone stand up as soon as she appeared, Zhang Xiaoqi hurriedly pressed her hands down to gesture. "Continue busy, I'm just looking." Saying this, she walked to Xu Zhewei and Li Hongyu's desk and flipped through the ledger. It seemed the Hall accountant had already been here; the declared amounts and invoiced amounts for today had already been filled in the ledger.

"Director Nan, do the write-off for today's remittance too, then you can go back."

"Okay, Director Zhang."
