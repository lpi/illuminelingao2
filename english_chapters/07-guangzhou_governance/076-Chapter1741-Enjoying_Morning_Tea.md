# Chapter 1741: Enjoying Morning Tea

"Enjoying morning tea" (Dan Zaocha/Tan Zaocha) is the most enjoyed reserved program for the leisure class in Guangzhou. Even in this extraordinary period when hair-thieves entered the city and the King's flag changed on the city wall, shopkeepers of major tea houses in the city still proudly hung out the "Open Today" sign board. Before six o'clock in the morning, the front of the door was already piled with mountains of steamer baskets with smoke curling up, and the inside was still bustling, with a table hard to find.

"Enjoying morning tea" is of course not just for eating a sumptuous breakfast as the literal meaning suggests. It is a social method customary to Guangzhou people. Just like tea houses in the north, tea guests from all directions early in the morning, either carrying bird cages covered with blue silk cloth or bringing a few "Hua Gu Long" (naughty children), call three or five intimate friends, find a clean seat, exchange greetings, take seats, say "Kung Hei Fat Choy" (Wish you prosperity), and then take seats one by one. Then order three or five steamers of dim sum like char siu bao, shaomai, steamed dumplings, a pot of raw boiling congee, and of course the indispensable pot of tea. After these necessary procedures are completed, the formal social interaction begins. This is called "King Kai" (chatting), called "Kan Dashan" (bragging) in the north, "Bai Longmenzhen" (gossip/chat) in Sichuan. Like its brothers with different names, this is a way to exchange intelligence, mainly current events and social news. Naturally, there are quite a few bragging and unreliable things mixed inside, but interested people can still get something from it.

Speaking of the biggest news in Guangzhou City recently, it is none other than the hair-thieves officially tearing their faces with the Imperial Court, breaking Guangzhou City, and appointing a Prefect surnamed Liu. Speaking of the news of this Grandfather Liu, it is really like fish in the Pearl River, fished up one after another. The freshness of the big event that could make the "Know-It-Alls" in the tea house argue until their faces were red and spittle flew hadn't passed yet, and another even more explosive news came up, directly replacing the position of its predecessor with infinite glory. The freshness of Grandfather Liu cutting the Gordian knot and destroying the clerks who had been harmful for a long time a few days ago hadn't passed yet, and today the tea house was talking about another matter.

"Several bosses, do you know?" A smiling fat man opened his chatterbox just after taking a sip of tea, "These few days, Chengxuan Street, wow, was all leveled by the Short Hairs. That Ah Zhu, oh, Boss Zhang you know him too, the boss of Qingyun Rice Noodle Shop, his house was half leveled. Hehe, forced to go hang himself. This gang of bastards really give birth to sons without an asshole."

Everyone nodded repeatedly upon hearing this. Only a young man in green clothes looked at everyone without understanding. Boss Zhang was an old man with three strands of black beard on his face who believed in harmony making money. He was also the best dressed. He said to the young man in Mandarin: "He said that these days the entire Chengxuan Street was demolished by the Australians. Boss Zhu of Qingyun Rice Noodle Shop, ah, that was also a young man I mentored, had half his house demolished and is making a fuss about hanging himself." The young man suddenly realized and nodded repeatedly. Boss Zhang turned his head and said to the fat man in Mandarin: "Boss Wang, ah, this Mr. Li is a sea merchant from Southern Zhili, the young owner of an old patron of my humble shop Yehengxiang. Please bear with him more."

The fat man blushed slightly, stood up holding the teacup, and said in Mandarin: "Offense, offense, Boss Li don't blame me. Brother, I use tea instead of wine to punish myself with a cup." Little Li hurriedly stood up too, groped three times on the table to grab the teacup, lifted it and said: "Dare not, dare not. Brother arrived in the precious land for the first time and still needs Brother to look after me more. Another day Brother I will prepare a full banquet to invite all bosses to get drunk and rest." The two drank to each other.

A lean-looking man beside took over the conversation and said: "The Short Hairs got rich? So many valuable things."

The fat man wiped the corner of his mouth with his robe sleeve and said: "Of course not! I have a die-hard buddy who is a handsome boy in Nanhai County. He said, ah, the Short Hairs piled all the valuable things at the East Parade Ground. Pay whatever fine and you can redeem them back. Also, those who demolished it themselves three days ago are not there."

Boss Zhang stroked his beard and nodded: "Doing what they say, rare; clear rewards and punishments, even rarer."

The man sneered: "Rare? Your die-hard buddy is bragging, right? Don't know how much he made. Who in the whole world doesn't know, this is the time for your die-hard buddy to make money. Hiding a few taels of silver unnoticed here, stealing a few taels of gold unnoticed there."

"Eat shit, Mad Cow!" The fat man was furious, slapping the table bang-bang loud. "You can eat things randomly but you can't talk randomly. You insult me, Fat Shu, fine! But you can't insult my die-hard buddy. He is a filial son. If it weren't for him listening to his old mother to be kind to others and make money with harmony, your broken dog kennel would have been demolished long ago!"

"Boss Wang, Ah Niu! Don't quarrel! Come come come, eat a bun first." Boss Zhang hurriedly intervened to smooth things over, putting a char siu bao in each person's bowl. Mad Cow simply took the opportunity to back down and started eating the bun. The fat man was still chattering endlessly.

"Boss Li, it's not me Fat Shu bragging. If my die-hard buddy was a scum who harmed the neighbors like Mad Cow, he would have been sent to swing on the swing by Prefect Liu long ago. It's precisely because he has always been a good person who is diligent and does good deeds, living a peaceful life himself, that he was retained. He said, the whole what-what Action, oh, this is the Short Hairs' word, these public servants didn't hide a single brick or tile privately, all sealed and sent to the East Parade Ground. Whoever dared to touch anything would swing on the swing, not even hardship fees. Get rich get rich, get rich your old mother!"

"This group of Australians does have a new atmosphere." Boss Zhang nodded and said counting his fingers. "Eliminated customary fees, reduced extortion, business is business, clear rewards and punishments. Business for small merchants and small households like us who rely on ability to eat is much easier to do."

"This is indeed true." Little Boss Li, who had been at a loss, took over Boss Zhang's conversation. "Kun... ah Australians seem to have the ability to touch stone and turn it into gold. Business is good wherever they go. Heard from my father that in previous years doing business across the sea, we had to buy face from various sea lords. Just the tribute gift money took up fifty percent of the profit every year. If not timely, both people and boat would be gone. Once the Australians came, collected Liu Xiang, broke Old Zheng, from Southern Zhili to Guangzhou, the whole way is unimpeded, and the profit has more than doubled. Pity ah, how could they do such..." He looked around and whispered when no one was paying attention. "Great rebellious thing!"

Hearing the sore spot, everyone sighed in unison.

Regarding how long the Red Flag could fly, not only them, but the gentry and common people of the entire Guangzhou Prefecture were wait-and-see. After all, the Imperial Court had accumulated prestige for a long time and was an unshakable existence for these small people. Although they had no affection for this Imperial Court that only knew how to eat, take, block, and demand, if the Heavenly Army arrived, it would inevitably turn everyone, good or bad, into powder. The Hair-thieves could get on the boat and leave, but they couldn't escape even with wings.

"Yeah. Who... ah sorry, everyone knows Mad Cow specializes in selling chicken congee to Short Hair soldiers to eat. I told him many times, telling him not to do Short Hair business. When the time comes, ah, we don't know if we will die or not, Mad Cow is definitely dead."

"What do you know!" Mad Cow was unhappy, putting on an arrogant look, knocking on the table and saying. "I tell you, unless the Short Hair run away themselves, just that gang of shrimp soldiers and crab generals of the Imperial Court, one Short Hair soldier, let them have ten, they can't beat. Even the Guan-Ning Army is far behind."

"You just brag!"

"Hey! Fat Shu, do you still remember what I did before?"

"I know, you were just a Big Head Soldier (soldier)."

"Good. You admit I'm an expert, right? I tell you, I don't compare other firearms and cannons, just the killing aura of the Short Hair soldiers, the Guan-Ning Army can't even catch up by slapping the horse. The Eastern Barbarians (Manchus) who brag to be invincible with ten thousand are only fit to carry night soil." Mad Cow unbuttoned his upper garment, pointing to a long centipede-like scar on his belly and said. "Fat Shu! Back then I followed Commander He to fight Lingao. Would I be afraid of you bastard? When attacking Shishan, we had ten thousand brothers, hand-to-hand combat with a few hundred of them, lost completely clean and bare! Were chased and killed for dozens of miles like driving ducks. I've even sat in the Short Hairs' prison. Am I like you bastard? Only have a mouth. (Unlike you bastard who only talks)"

Everyone was dumbfounded hearing this, involuntarily imagining the magnificent scene of a few hundred people chasing ten thousand people running all over the street, and involuntarily took a breath.

"So, the saying that Kun... Australians are only good at firearms is extremely absurd?" Little Boss Li suddenly felt like a frog in the well.

"Which bastard said that? Even if the Short Hair soldiers fight the Eastern Barbarians, without using muskets and cannons, I bet the Short Hairs win."

"If it's really as Ah Niu said. It's not impossible for the Australians to stay in Guangzhou for a long time."

"More than that. The Short Hairs say they are descendants of the Song Dynasty. It wouldn't be surprising to fight back to Kaifeng to be the Emperor."

While talking, bursts of gong sounds suddenly came from outside. People in the room stopped talking. The waiter of the tea house hurried out to see what was happening. It turned out that the tithing head of the Great South Gate suburb was beating a gong passing by. Seeing the waiter come out, he said: "Heavenly Army is passing on the street again. Everyone don't be so panicked. Those willing to watch the excitement stand inside the white line to watch. Don't walk on the street surface, understand?"

"Understood."

The tithing head knocked the gong and went forward again. The waiter came back and told the people in the room, and everyone immediately had a new topic. That Mad Cow said: "I said why someone was pushing a cart along the street brushing lime lines early in the morning. It turns out it's for this use!"

"Passing troops, why passing troops again?" Discussion was rife in the tea house.

"I see the river surface is full of Kun... Australian troop carriers, big and small, going up the West River and North River. Passing troops again at this time?"

"Probably going to fight all the way to Nanxiong, close the Five Ridges gateway, the Imperial Court's army can't come down, and the Senate closes the door to be the Emperor."

"Don't know if this Song is 'Southern' Song or 'Yue' (Guangdong) Song?"
