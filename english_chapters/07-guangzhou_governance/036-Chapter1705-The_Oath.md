# Chapter 1705 - The Oath

It was a fine, clear day. In the slightly cold north wind of Hainan's winter, the military flags of Ma'ao Fortress fluttered and snapped in the breeze.

Tian Liang had risen before dawn, repeating his daily routine over and over. He followed the issued documents and regulations to the letter, fearful of missing a single item.

A week had passed since the order to "pack your gear and stand ready for departure." Preparation work for every company, every battalion had been completed. Officers from the operational units at brigade, battalion, and company level, as well as those from the General Staff and Joint Logistics, tirelessly inspected every soldier and every company's equipment, again and again, afraid of overlooking a single detail.

Materiel had piled up like mountains. Not only supplementary equipment for the expedition, but weapons too had been updated. Soldiers' rifles were replaced based on ordnance inspection results. Personal equipment, heavy baggage, light baggage—all were checked repeatedly to prevent omissions. Yet while ensuring completeness, care was taken not to exceed weight limits. The "three categories, four specifications" work for each unit was inspected strictly according to regulations—that is, the rules governing what each soldier carried for wartime, peacetime, and training, and what was not to be carried.

These regulations had been enforced before, but never as meticulously as now. The General Staff officers who came to inspect brought scales, weighing each soldier's load individually—truly not a *jin* over the limit.

Tian Liang was run ragged. His company was newly formed. Though old soldiers had been distributed proportionally when the new units were organized, the ratio of new recruits in the company was still too high. Moreover, the new recruits were the first batch of conscripts under the mandatory service system, and their morale was rather complicated.

These past few years, life in Hainan had been getting steadily better, and the common people's enthusiasm for military service had dropped significantly. No matter how good the treatment or how high the status, once fighting started, there was danger to life. The good days had only just begun. So after the new recruits entered the barracks, their moods fluctuated wildly. As an officer, one not only had to do ideological work but also ensure there were no deserters. For this purpose, each squad had designated "assistance targets," with veteran soldiers responsible for "man-to-man" supervision. Though the Yuan Council's civil administration system could now ensure that any deserter would be recaptured as long as he didn't flee to the mainland or deep into the mountains, a single desertion would greatly damage morale. Those who had been wavering might see an example and make up their minds to flee as well.

"Catching a deserter takes time. Before he's caught, your company's morale will waver because of one deserter. Those who had been undecided, seeing someone set an example, might make up their minds to desert too." At the officer training course, Transmigrator Wei Aiwen from the General Staff Political Department had explained this during his lectures on company-level political and ideological work.

Preventing desertion and boosting morale thus became primary tasks for grassroots company officers like Tian Liang. For the slow-tongued, inarticulate Tian Liang, this was a difficult assignment. Fortunately, during this expansion, a batch of "student officers" had been assigned—the army's first class to complete the full three-year officer training program. They had all finished two years of lower-primary education at Fangcaodi before transferring to the Army Training Class for three years. Their educational level and military aptitude were incomparable to existing officers; what they lacked was practical experience in leading troops and combat. Tian Liang's company had also received a young officer, and he delegated these matters to him.

Since there was no training, most of the time was spent in meetings—mobilization meetings, reminiscence meetings, at all levels, in constant rotation. The newly arrived student officers were articulate, full of new terminology, and skilled at motivation. The propaganda materials distributed by the Propaganda Department were filled with descriptions of famine, plague, rapacious taxes, refugees selling their children, cannibalism, Eastern Barbarian incursions, roving bandit hordes, and gentry tyranny...None of this required much embellishment. Anyone who had fled from the mainland had either experienced or heard of such things firsthand.

Besides propaganda materials, organizing soldiers to share their own "bitter memories" and bringing in special "speaking teams" were also important methods. Testimonies from real people were more vivid and moving than dry written materials.

He recalled the figures his company clerk had summarized for him from yesterday's "reminiscence meeting": ninety-five had experienced fleeing famine and begging; one hundred had gone hungry; seventy had lost one or both parents; ninety-one had lost siblings; fourteen had been sold into bondage; thirty-one had sold wives, children, or siblings; nine had been sodomized...and finally, a cold, terrible number: ten had eaten human flesh.

His company had only one hundred men total.

The peaceful times in Hainan had buried the terrifying memories of their past. But now the political mobilization meetings were summoning those horrible memories from the depths of their minds, transforming them into immense rage, and igniting high fighting spirit.

Tian Liang walked past the company bulletin board. Besides the ever-present copy of the *Lingao Times*, there were now determination statements from every man in the company. Handwriting of every style covered the wall, not a few in red ink, startlingly vivid. Just as Tian Liang was about to read some of them, he suddenly heard weeping from the soldiers' recreation room. Shortly after, two soldiers emerged supporting a third, who had apparently fainted. Tian Liang was now accustomed to such scenes. Most of the soldiers here had escaped from the brink of death. Whose family didn't have a bellyful of misery? Usually it was buried, but now that it had been stirred up, the emotional upheaval was often more than their nerves could bear.

Thinking of his own past, Tian Liang's eyes grew hot, and he nearly shed tears. Fearing someone might see, he quickly turned away, rubbed his eyes, composed himself, and then continued toward the cookhouse ahead.

The company cookhouse was busy. The cooking squad and soldiers on kitchen duty were hurrying about, preparing lunch. Since entering combat-ready status, each company had handed over their pigs and sheep to the Tiandihui cooperative in exchange for fresh meat. Daily food supplies from the Joint Logistics had also gone up a notch. Now there was chicken, duck, fish, and meat not just every day, but at every meal.

Looking at the steaming dishes on the large platters, Tian Liang remembered a soldier saying these past days they were eating "last meals for the condemned." He couldn't help but feel a surge of indescribable emotion.

---

Suddenly, a rapid drumbeat sounded across the entire camp. Tian Liang started—this was the drum signal for "emergency assembly." He immediately seized the whistle hanging around his neck and blew it, shouting at the messenger running toward him: "Quick! Assemble the whole company!"

Almost simultaneously, the emergency assembly drums were sounding throughout the camp. Officers and soldiers who had been preparing for deployment for months felt their hearts jolt. Almost in unison, a single thought flashed through their minds: "It's here!"

The four infantry battalions training at Ma'ao Fortress, along with the army and brigade direct support units, rapidly assembled on the main parade ground.

"At ease!" The duty officer gave the command, then shouted: "Commander of the Southern China Army, please speak!"

"Comrades!" Xi Yazhou stood on the wooden reviewing stand, speaking into a freshly installed loudspeaker. "I will now read you the orders." He unfolded the document in his hands. After a brief pause, he read: "Order of the Chairman of the Yuan Council!..." The moment these seven words left his mouth, the entire assembly snapped to attention with a collective *whoosh*. Every eye was fixed on his tightly closed lips, awaiting what followed.

"The Southern China Army and its subordinate units: Infantry Battalion One, Infantry Battalion Eight..." Xi Yazhou recited a long string of unit designations in a single breath. "Our armed forces under the leadership of the Yuan Council—the Australian Expeditionary Court of the Great Song—have achieved great victories in the revolutionary war against the puppet Ming reactionary government. The enemy's aggression against us has met with ignominious defeat, and the lair of the warmongers has been severely punished. All of Hainan has been liberated. This is the result of the united effort and heroic struggle of all our officers and men. I extend to you my warmest congratulations and thanks.

"But our combat mission is not yet complete. The puppet Ming still oppresses the vast people across the Chinese lands. The corrupt and incompetent puppet Ming regime not only fails to protect the people but intensifies its cruelty against them. The land of Cathay is engulfed in fire and flood.

"I hereby order! All personnel of the Fubo Army are to resolutely execute every command of the Yuan Council, cross the sea on the Northern Expedition, sweep away the puppet Ming's reactionary forces, and liberate the homeland. At the same time, they shall exterminate bandits, Eastern Barbarians, and roving rebels, and suppress all resistance and sabotage by reactionaries.

"Chairman of the Yuan Council and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Wang Luobin."

"Long live!" The moment Xi Yazhou's voice fell, the several thousand soldiers assembled on the parade ground shouted in unison.

The troops arrayed in formation gave three cheers of "Long live!" Everyone knew: the Chiefs were about to contend for the Central Plains and seize all under heaven!

After reading the Northern Expedition Order, Xi Yazhou swept his gaze over the blue-gray formations below and called out:

"Bring out the colors!" The political commissar shouted. A standard-bearer emerged from the rear ranks, raising high an eagle banner. The flag was visibly worn, its once-crimson field faded to a grayish red—but the iron fist, wheat, and cogwheel design, along with the ornate "S.S.A.E." Latin letters beneath, remained clearly visible.

Tian Liang knew this was the military banner that had flown atop the earthen rampart during the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign. He had participated in that battle. Recalling the close combat atop the rampart, his blood began to boil.

"Please raise your left hand, place it over your left chest, and face our banner as we take the oath." The instant Xi Yazhou finished speaking, Tian Liang was so overcome with emotion that his muscles went taut, his ears rang, and he could barely control himself. He repeated after the oath-leader, word by word: "For the Yuan Council and the people, I am willing to sacrifice myself, to press ever forward, to fight bravely..."

The military band struck up—broadcast from the camp's loudspeakers—the strains of the March of the Fubo Army echoed across the grounds. Shouts of "Long live! Long live!" rolled across the entire Ma'ao Peninsula. Tian Liang gripped the hilt of his command sword, his whole being filled with strength. If he could die on the battlefield for the Yuan Council at this very moment, how happy that would be.
