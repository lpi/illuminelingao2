# Chapter 1849 - Honoring Ancestors

In the afternoon, Li Ziyu's work enthusiasm was high. After copying documents, he went out on two missions with the team, both arresting people in brothels. Recently, there had been particularly many anonymous reporting letters from various brothels. A large number of old cases regarding madams and managers abusing and persecuting prostitutes to death were dug up.

These reporting letters arrived at the police station and were all transferred to the Security Section currently undertaking the sex industry rectification case. After simple sorting and analysis, arrests began according to the list.

Neither naturalized citizens from Hainan nor locally retained recruited personnel had any concept of the modern legal system. Moreover, those working in the brothel line were basically not good people. There was no injustice in arresting them. Mu Min also intended to ensure a high-pressure posture on the sex industry, so arresting people upon having leads became the sole standard for handling cases.

Arrested people were thrown directly into temporary detention centers for slow interrogation. Li Ziyu was so busy his feet didn't touch the ground: registering, recording statements, handling procedures. Although busy, he hadn't seen the Section Chief, so his heart was a bit apprehensive. Only near the end of the shift did Lian Nishang return travel-stained. As soon as she entered, she patted the documents in her hand at Li Ziyu and said to him: "Ayu, congratulations. You were named by the Bureau Chief to go to Lingao to accept training. This is the notification."

"Thank you, Section Chief Lian!" The stone in Li Ziyu's heart finally fell into his stomach. He took the notification from the Section Chief's hand and snapped an "Australian style" attention.

"No need to be polite, it's all the Senate's grace." Lian Nishang looked at the young man in front of her with complex emotions, actually feeling a tiny bit of envy in her heart, "The departure time hasn't been set yet, but it will be within these few days. You spend a day handing over the matters in your hands."

"Yes!"

Li Ziyu held the transfer order document. The Security Section suddenly became lively. Colleagues around surrounded him. Everyone congratulated Li Ziyu. Some said Li Ziyu had good luck, some said Li Ziyu was a lucky general, some said Li Ziyu was promoted by a noble person. Everyone asked Li Ziyu not to forget them after returning from training and getting promoted. While socializing with colleagues, Li Ziyu looked at the notification. Although trying hard to put on a calm expression of "not surprised by favor or disgrace," the corners of his mouth still curled up with joy.

The short few lines of simple words without emotion on the notification read like an exquisite embroidered article to him. Refreshing the heart and spleen like nectar and jade liquid. He instantly understood why the teacher at the community school said "good articles can also be used to go with wine."

Uncontrollably reading the transfer order dozens of times until almost memorizing every word and sentence, Li Ziyu then reluctantly put the notification away close to his body. Off-duty time had arrived—usually, he would always delay getting off work a bit, but today he decided to tell the family this good news early and share his joyful mood with them.

Before reaching home, Li Ziyu's voice had already transmitted far into the courtyard.

"Old Bean (Dad), Mom, I'm back!"

Li Ziyu's mother came out to welcome him. Just reaching the courtyard gate, she saw Li Ziyu trotting in like wind and fire.

Although Li Ziyu's family was a military household, they still stressed "abiding by rules and walking properly," with upright behavior. After serving the Australians, being a policeman also required "majesty," so he rarely behaved like this, surprising Mother Li very much.

Now was the time of dynasty change. Her heart was always a bit apprehensive, looking nervously at Li Ziyu:

"Yu'er, what happened? Why are you so early today?" Before finished speaking, she was pulled into the main room by Li Ziyu. Seeing his father sitting by the long table reading a newspaper, Li Ziyu turned and pressed his mother into the chair by the tea table. He said to his paired parents: "Dad, Mom, son prospered this time. Just now a notification came, wanting son to go to Lingao to accept training. Coming back is to get an official position. Unexpected, right? The thing we were thinking about a few days ago happened today. Do you say son's luck is good or not?" Saying this, Li Ziyu took out that transfer order from his bosom and shook it in his hand.

"What? Really?" Father Li put down the newspaper in his hand and stood up. In excitement, he almost knocked the cup off the long table.

"Dad, look." Li Ziyu handed the transfer order to his father. Father Li looked up and down a few times and asked "This training?"

"Dad, it's like this: In the Great Song officialdom rules, one cannot be an official without undergoing training. Even if you are already an official, before being promoted a level, you must undergo training again before taking office. So that means your son—I am about to become an official, although a small official." Li Ziyu repeated in detail what he heard from Gao Chongjiu.

"Ai. Dad understands." Father Li's face turned completely red. Turning his head to Mother Li, he said: "Child's mother, go quickly, to the alley mouth, find Butcher Tian to buy two catties of pig head meat, no, buy a pig head, and get another two catties of wine! Our Li family is going to prosper again! This is all Ancestor's blessing! Go quickly, why are you stunned? Go quickly, go quickly. Coming back we have to offer sacrifice to ancestors!"

Mother Li responded repeatedly, busy taking a basket and walking out.

Father Li was so happy that his front words didn't match his back words. Watching the equally excitedly tearful Mother Li turn out of the main room, he turned back to Li Ziyu: "What big official small official, this is official status! Official status!"

Li Ziyu thought I was already civil service establishment. Going up is still civil servant. If that is official status, then he already had it. But this couldn't be explained to his dad to understand, so he replied respectfully: "Father is right."

"Only with this first step can there be subsequent ones. I'll go invite the ancestral tablets. You call Zhao Gui, tidy up the main room, carry an Eight Immortals Table out."

"Zhao Gui, returned?"

"He has the early shift today, came back in the afternoon." Father Li said, "He told me you were going to prosper. I still thought it a bit obscure. Unexpectedly what he said was actually true!"

Father Li suddenly remembered something, pointing at the newspaper and saying: "No wonder, the newspaper published your matter. Seems not fake at all, the Australians are indeed going to promote you!"

"Oh? I've been very busy these few days, haven't had time to read the newspaper. Let me see." Li Ziyu said and was about to take the newspaper.

"What's the hurry, do proper business first. You go call Zhao Gui, ask him to come help out. Although he is not of my Li family, he is also a loyal and reliable person, and has some fortune—since he came to our house, your luck has been consistently good. I see you can become sworn brothers of different surnames with him in the future. Maybe one day he will help you."

Li Ziyu agreed. Just talking, Mother Li came in carrying the pig head from outside, saying happily: "Butcher Tian is quite fun. Knowing you are going to Lingao for training, he gave half a set of intestines and lungs. Wait for me to wash them clean and cook."

The incense table was set up, and ancestral tablets were invited out. Mother Li shouted: "Come lend a hand." Zhao Gui ran out from the kitchen beside the main room, took the wine and pig head from Mother Li's hands, turned and entered the kitchen again.

Mother Li followed Zhao Gui into the kitchen to work bussily. The father and son in the main room became leisurely: Father Li looked at the transfer order again and again, reciting it with a drawn-out tone from time to time; Li Ziyu held the newspaper reading the Mingnu case series reports. When Mother Li and Zhao Gui arranged the things for sacrifice, Mother Li came out to greet: "Husband, things are prepared. It's getting late."

The father and son put down things in their hands. Everyone stood before the incense table to burn incense and kowtow, offering sacrifices to ancestors and comforting their spirits in heaven. Although Ah Gui didn't kneel and bow, he observed from the side. After worshipping ancestors, the family plus Zhao Gui took seats to eat and drink. It lasted until very late, until Father Li was dead drunk before ending.

Because there were many things in the bureau, and he had to hand over work, several matters on hand had to be processed as soon as possible. Early the next morning, Li Ziyu returned to the bureau. Just entering the Security Section, he saw someone bringing a young man in. Wearing a green silk pleated robe, a pair of fine-knotted Chenqiao cloth shoes, black silk knee pads tied over clean water cloth socks, and a tasseled hat on head. A look revealed the attire of a dissolute son of the city.

Heard him shouting "Injustice" loudly as soon as he came in, saying "I was walking properly, neither stealing nor robbing, didn't even spit a mouthful of phlegm, why arrest me into the yamen?"

The arresting police didn't answer, dragging him directly into the registration room to photograph and register. Li Ziyu didn't take it seriously, continuing his paperwork.

Not a few minutes later, the police handling procedures in the registration room suddenly rushed out, shouting loudly: "Quick, quick find a doctor!"

Ripples instantly rose in the pre-trial room. The part-time hygienist hurriedly went in with a medicine chest. Someone rushed to find the police station's duty doctor.

Li Ziyu walked over to watch the excitement, but saw on the floor of the registration room, the young man just brought in was convulsing, foaming at the mouth. Several police officers surrounded him; some let him smell Zhuge Marching Powder, some unbuttoned his clothes, messy in a ball.

This person's consciousness was not yet comatose, only tearing at the clothes on his chest vigorously, panting hard, shouting for water with a hoarse throat. In just a few minutes, his head suddenly tilted to the side, and his whole body seemed to loosen up.

Li Ziyu thought secretly "not good." With the body convulsing originally, now suddenly relaxing, likely the soul had flown and spirit dispersed.

Sure enough, the doctor called over checked the pulse and shook his head, saying the breath was gone.

"Really unlucky!" The policeman who caught him stomped his foot, "Caught him with difficulty, and he died again! Now it's hard to explain to the task force!"

Li Ziyu originally thought this was just a dissolute son who committed some minor offense. Hearing this, he quickly asked: "Who is the deceased?"

"Who else? one of the criminals being secretly pursued in the Mao Family Inn case: Wang Dong!"

Arresting Wang Dong took more time than expected. Since Wang Daniao disappeared and was subsequently killed, he had been a "stray dog," with no fixed abode, only "sticking to whoring" in various brothels to sponge meals. At night he mostly slept in concierge rooms or backyards of brothels.

After the rectification of the sex industry began, police frequented major brothels. Because Wang Dong had engaged in "abducting and trafficking women," feeling a bit unstable, he stopped appearing in brothels and hid in a "private door" of a musician household he had old ties with to muddle through some days.
