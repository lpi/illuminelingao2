# Chapter 2019 - Meritorious Participation (II)

"That's simple enough. I'll contact them." Fu Meng volunteered. He wasn't as much of a "homebody" as Cui Hantang, who was content to remain in the temple working on "infrastructure."

"Mm, you handle it then. Each one must contribute at least one hundred yuan."

"One hundred is already substantial, and you say 'at least'?" Though Fu Meng held little affection for the other two groups, he remained reluctant about this blatant extortion routine.

The purchasing power of the silver yuan notes they issued proved quite substantial. A table at a Guangzhou restaurant with chicken, duck, fish, and meat—an eight-treasure feast that eight men couldn't finish—cost merely two yuan. One hundred yuan represented a small fortune.

"It is substantial, but the expenses are enormous." Cui Hantang felt Fu Meng was good in every respect, except his occasional sense of justice sometimes left him helpless. "Don't forget the house repairs also fall to us..."

Cui Hantang had actively shouldered the temporary bridal chamber issue precisely to play the "borrow chicken to lay eggs" maneuver. Unexpectedly, Ai Zhixin had refused to pay for repairs, ruining his initial plan. Coincidentally a new pretext had appeared—naturally not to be missed.

Gathering money from the Three Religions to repair houses for my New Daoism—isn't it wonderful? Thinking of this, Cui Hantang felt quite pleased with himself.

Fu Meng departed to "conduct liaison work." Cui Hantang estimated this alms-begging trip wouldn't prove difficult. Fu Meng was a dignified Elder. Asking in the Wedding and Funeral Council's name, neither Buddhism nor Catholicism would refuse him face. Especially the Buddhist Association Chairman and Abbot of Guangxiao Temple, Tongjiong, was a very sensible individual who cooperated well with the Religious Affairs Office. It was that malodorous new Guangzhou Bishop Ma Yangchun who often displayed expressions of "disapproval" in meetings. Cui Hantang always felt this German harbored an inexplicable sense of superiority.

Raising money from these two would be simple. Next came mobilizing wealthy households for "meritorious participation."

Though Daoist rituals possessed many designations—dispelling disaster, praying for blessings, seeking peace, salvation were all valid reasons—no one had ever conducted a "Marriage Jiao," nor were there ready-made rituals or scriptures. Cui Hantang scratched his head extensively without knowing how to perform this Marriage Jiao. Then he reflected: *I'm the head of a temple. Why worry about this?* He immediately instructed Qing Yun to summon Daoist Hou.

Since returning to Five Immortals Temple, Daoist Hou had been exceedingly diligent. His "professional ability" was supreme among the retained Daoists, so he handled most of the temple's "traditional business." Matters like conducting rituals naturally fell to him.

Hearing about holding a Marriage Jiao, Daoist Hou felt surprised, wondering what manner of ritual this was. No patriarch of any sect possessed such a ritual. Besides, what scriptures to chant? How to compose the memorial? He harbored full disapproval, but facing this stout Daoist master, Daoist Hou naturally dared not say "don't know." But asking him to invent a "Marriage Jiao" ritual and scriptures from thin air—he lacked that capability.

Daoist Hou considered repeatedly and said: "Daoist Master, regarding this Marriage Jiao, forgive this humble Daoist's ignorance, but I've never learned it. If such a ritual is required, in my humble opinion, better to conduct a Blessing Jiao. Write on the memorial that it is to pray for blessings for newlyweds; that would be appropriate."

Cui Hantang heard this made sense, nodded repeatedly, and said: "In that case, you handle this matter. This is arranged by the Guangzhou Municipal Government, to be conducted for three consecutive days. Many distinguished guests will be entertained for meritorious participation. You must arrange everything properly."

"I obey the Dharma decree." Daoist Hou hurriedly bowed.

Under the New Daoism system, no such thing as "Dharma decree" existed. But flattery always succeeds. Daoist Hou's flattery was quite well-received by Cui Hantang.

Daoist Hou withdrew to prepare. Cui Hantang then summoned the temple's reception monk (Zhike)—this Zhike had originally been an old hand at Five Immortals Temple. After the temple was "taken over," Daoists scattered, and he'd fled to a Daoist courtyard outside the city. Being a Zhike rather than an ordinary Daoist, the abbot there valued him highly. But a small temple inevitably felt like squandered talent. Later hearing the Great Song's new abbot summoned everyone back, he'd returned. Cui Hantang was delighted to see the Zhike return and immediately reinstated him.

Responsible for receiving pilgrims, a Zhike played a pivotal role in any temple. "Donors" were not only a main economic source, but having several "influential patrons" to rely on also saved considerable trouble. Thus, temples of any scale valued the selection of Zhike highly. Especially for a large and famous temple like Five Immortals Temple, the Zhike had to possess diplomatic skills and know the family situations of city gentry and wealthy households like the back of his hand.

Cui Hantang wanted the Zhike to venture out these coming days, ostensibly to "distribute blessings," visiting gentry and wealthy households associated with Five Immortals Temple one by one, informing them the temple would soon conduct a "Marriage Jiao" for the collective wedding hosted by the Guangzhou Municipal Government.

"...You needn't explicitly request their participation, merely mention the matter." Cui Hantang instructed. "If asked who is hosting the ritual, say it is Zhang Yu, boss of Zhang's Food Company."

The Zhike nodded. "This humble Daoist understands."

"Some gentry and wealthy households need not be visited." Cui Hantang instructed. "You know which ones."

"Yes, this humble Daoist understands." The Zhike comprehended perfectly. Shortly after his return, Cui Hantang had given him a list, instructing him to reduce interactions with the wealthy households on it. Being a person "with one more heart orifice than Bi Gan," he naturally understood this was the Council of Elders' "Roll Call of Doom"—households on it had worrying prospects. However, occasionally this list would be modified, with households added or deleted.

"Good, proceed." Cui Hantang reclined on the bamboo couch. "If they wish to participate, register them and bring it back for me to review."

"Visiting one by one like this will require approximately two or three days. When is the ritual scheduled?"

Cui Hantang avoided the question. "The date isn't established yet. Just handle this first."

"Then this humble Daoist will depart tomorrow."

Watching the Zhike depart, Cui Hantang reflected on how he'd arranged everything in merely an hour and could now sit back and enjoy the fruits. He felt smug: all abilities are illusory; leadership skills are genuine!

The following day, Cui Hantang rose early. Though lazy, he didn't sleep in. Rising at 5 AM was an old habit from the old timeline. He didn't eat breakfast after washing, drinking a cup of warm water first, then changed into Daoist robes served by Xiao Qian.

Qing Yun came to report: the audience had assembled.

"Good, let's go exercise!"

As soon as the sky brightened, people gathered before Five Immortals Temple to watch this "Australian Spectacle." Seeing the temple gate open, a stir ran through the crowd: "Coming," "Coming."

A group of blue-robed Daoists emerged from the opening gate, led by the Australian stout abbot, filing out with approximately thirty individuals. Both men and women were present. They formed six rows on the small square before the temple, five per row. The stout abbot stood opposite the formation and called: "Center on Qing Yun, spread out in gymnastics formation!" A young Daoist at the center raised his hand high, and other Daoists spread arms to space themselves out, two arm-lengths apart front, back, left, and right. The stout Daoist called again: "Warm up!" Daoists interlaced fingers and rotated wrists in place, alternating ankle rotations, then stretching arms and pressing legs...

After a set of warm-up exercises, the stout Daoist called again: "Five-Step Fist, ready, begin!" With this, the stout Daoist turned and led the practice, young Daoists following his commands and movements:

Parallel Stance Fist Hold, Bow Stance Punch, Snap Kick Punch, Horse Stance Block Strike, Cross Stance Punch, Knee Raise Palm Pierce, Drop Stance Palm Pierce, Empty Stance Palm Strike, Parallel Stance Fist Hold.

After completing Five-Step Fist three times, the stout Daoist changed commands: "Tai Chi Thirteen Forms, ready, begin:"

Immortal Points Sword, Universe Ball Hold, Beauty Looks in Mirror...

By now the watching crowd was buzzing: "What are these Daoists doing?" "Practicing martial arts for display?" "Not afraid of people stealing skills?" Bold children were already imitating the punches and kicks.

For regulars, this wasn't novel at all. They came daily partly with notions of "stealing skills."

Cui Hantang had been practicing Tai Chi early every morning these days precisely to gather popularity. Seeing more people watching each morning, he felt the timing was ripe. After the final form "True Qi Refines Elixir," he didn't dismiss the group but walked around the small square with composure, declaring:

"Respected neighbors, life lies in movement. This fist set is named: Tai Chi Thirteen Forms. Created by Patriarch Sanfeng, the Thirteen Postures consist of thirteen groups of movements with potent offensive and defensive intent, including Opening, Ball Holding, Single Push, Probe, Lift, Pounce, Carry, Separate, Cloud, Dissolve, Double Push, Lower, and Closing. It contains three Daoist internal cultivation methods: Tu Na (breathing), Daoyin (guiding), and Cai Bu Hun Yuan Zhuang (Gathering Primordial Stance). The movements are designed according to the needs of exercising the human body's eight meridians, which connect internally to the five organs. The entire routine contains the five organs and eight meridians internally, and five steps and eight methods externally, combining defense and offense, fusing Daoist health-preserving alchemy, hence called 'Tai Chi Thirteen Postures.' It is truly the orthodox way of health preservation, the essence of Tai Chi. Frequent practice can strengthen the body and prolong life. Now teaching here freely. Every morning we Daoists practice outside the gate for half an hour. Those willing to learn can observe and practice independently. This health-preserving secret method is taught by fate; how much you learn depends on everyone's comprehension."

Having finished speaking, Cui Hantang led the young Daoists to practice independently to the music of *Cloud Water Zen Heart* flowing from inside the temple.

After completing this morning ritual, an hour had elapsed. The Daoists were starving with stars in their eyes and cold sweat on their backs, especially the retained old Daoists whose physical fitness proved inferior to the students. Practicing early without eating, they were nearly hypoglycemic. Fortunately, Cui Hantang treated people generously, and the food was excellent. Upon returning to the dining hall, duty Daoists served bowls of thick rice porridge, with jars of brown sugar on the table to sweeten to taste. There were also fried dough sticks (youtiao).
