# Chapter 1734: Chengxuan Street

The institutional setup had been arranged before entering the city, and the main cadres had already been selected. After Liu Xiang distributed the received indigenous personnel, the institutional construction was considered roughly completed.

Outside, it was noisy with registration and head-shaving. Liu Xiang couldn't manage so much, so he hurriedly went down to his office—Lin Baiguang was already waiting for him.

"The Great Army is about to enter the city. This matter is a bit rushed; it all depends on you." Liu Xiang didn't stand on ceremony and went straight to the point.

The 4th Battalion and the National Army responsible for the occupation of Guangzhou Prefecture entered the city on the day the city was opened. Now it was the main force of the South China Army participating in the Guangdong Strategy that was about to enter the city. From a purely military perspective, there was no need for these troops to enter the city, but the Senators all thought it was necessary to take this opportunity to publicize "Our Martial Prowess," letting the natives fully appreciate the military might of the Fubo Army and fully deterring potential resistance elements. So it was decided that the Great Army would pass through the city fully armed.

"This matter is really not easy to handle." Lin Baiguang spread out the map of Guangzhou he brought. This map was the painstaking effort of the City Operation Department over the past few years. However, the City Operation Department was only a secret agency after all, and had no power to send surveyors swaggering into every building for on-site surveying, so the details were not very precise. It roughly drew the main street network and building groups in Guangzhou City to scale.

"Although it's not a military parade, it's actually the same thing as a military parade." Lin Baiguang said, "As far as the situation I grasp goes, the most suitable route is to enter from the Great South Gate, go north along Chengxuan Street, pass through Shuangmendi, and finally exit from the Great North Gate or the Small North Gate—crossing the entire city."

Chengxuan Street was Beijing Road in modern time-space. Through all dynasties, Beijing Road was the north-south central axis of Guangzhou City, with very important traffic status. There were a large number of government offices, academies, and temples distributed on both sides of the street, and it was also an important commercial area. An armed parade here could achieve the best effect.

"...The key is that this street is wide enough and is a stone-paved road." Lin Baiguang pointed at the map, "You must have seen the streets of Guangzhou."

Liu Xiang nodded: "Narrow, uneven surface. And mostly mud-stone mixed roads."

"Mud-stone mixed roads are already considered good; most are dirt roads with no stones at all." Lin Baiguang said, "But the difficulty is not here."

"Where is it then?" Liu Xiang couldn't make heads or tails of it.

"I can't explain it clearly here. It's better for us to go and see directly." Lin Baiguang smiled slightly, "I think you should work on-site more to understand the difficulty of managing a big city."

"I accept this suggestion." Liu Xiang nodded, "There is another thing. Do you think you can temporarily serve as the Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Police Bureau?"

"This isn't appropriate, right? The National Police and our civil affairs department are two systems. Besides, Ran Yao still has people in his pocket. He hasn't proposed a candidate yet just to balance the internal situation—let's wait until the formal appointment comes."

"You can hold it concurrently first. I'll issue you an appointment letter later. It won't be too late to hand over when the formal director arrives. There are many things to handle in police affairs. And the sooner the better. Besides, how can you, the Director of the Comprehensive Governance Office, manage without the gun barrel?" Liu Xiang shook his head, "Although I am the Director of the Military Control Commission, managing the army on horseback and the people off horseback, having command over both the army and the police, you have many trivial matters. You can't come to make a report and application every time..."

"Don't you have the Detective Brigade you incorporated?" Lin Baiguang smiled, "These people are very useful."

Liu Xiang and Lin Baiguang left the City Hall. They neither called for a carriage nor took a sedan chair, bringing more than ten guards with them. Lin Baiguang also called for a scribe from the Works Department and several copying clerks and detective team members. Together they went towards Chengxuan Street.

Chengxuan Street was not far from the Prefectural Yamen—historically, this had always been the political and cultural center of Guangzhou. There were numerous government offices, academies, and temples here, so the surrounding houses and streets were relatively neat and impressive. It was just that the streets and alleys were mostly twisting and winding, and the paths were narrow and not straight. The road surface was even more muddy—sewerage facilities were almost non-existent here. Not to mention domestic sewage flowing everywhere, the accumulated water after rain would take a long time to dry. Liu Xiang thought to himself that fortunately he listened to Lin Baiguang's reminder when coming out and put on high-top oilcloth boots. Otherwise, it would be hard to even walk.

"This is considered good here. Because it's close to the government offices and close to the main commercial area, the residents are relatively richer, and the road surface is still mud-stone mixed. If you really go to the poor alleys, the mud never dries."

"I originally thought Guangzhou would be better than Lingao and Qiongshan. It seems about the same." Liu Xiang smiled bitterly, "With this sanitary condition, it would be strange not to have an epidemic in summer."

"Ancient society had no concept of urban planning and management."

As they walked along, there was a gate at every alley entrance. The styles of the street gates were varied; some were decent gate towers, and some were just a door opening in a wall across the street with a fence door installed. The simplest were just chevaux-de-frise made of bamboo, blocking the alley entrance at night and moved aside during the day.

"Street gates are an important element of Guangzhou's public security. After dark, the street gates are locked, which puts a great limit on criminal activities at night. In an era without street light illumination, this is the most effective means of urban public security management."

"Equivalent to the curfew we are implementing now."

"That's the meaning. actually, night travel was also prohibited here before. Runners patrolled the streets every night, and anyone seen walking at night would be interrogated. If they felt your behavior was suspicious, you would inevitably be reprimanded by the Jail Warden Lord, beaten twenty strokes, and have to stay in the jail for a night, to be released on bail the next day. Of course, if you are a gentry or have some money in hand to bribe in time, you don't need to suffer this physical pain."

"Truly f***ing corrupt." Liu Xiang said.

"Corrupt as it is, it still has its function." Lin Baiguang said, "They are very familiar with the criminal gangs and beggar gangs in the city. If you want to handle public security well, you have to rely on them—at least for now."

Liu Xiang saw a small gray brick house of similar appearance beside every street gate. Although mostly dilapidated with incomplete doors and windows, they used gray cylindrical tiles only used for official houses. He couldn't help but be curious. Just as he was about to go over and look, a copying clerk beside him said: "Your Excellency, this is the official house where the street watchman lives. It's very filthy inside..."

It was indeed very filthy. Not to mention urine stains all over the walls, there were several urine buckets placed against the wall, emitting a strong stench. A large notice was pasted on the wall above the urine buckets, which was exactly the "Message to Guangzhou Citizens" he had instructed the Comprehensive Governance Office to post all over the city yesterday.

Unexpectedly, it was posted here. Liu Xiang smiled bitterly, but people coming to pee would definitely see it.

"Street watchman?"

"Yes, Your Excellency."

Seeing him bewildered, Lin Baiguang explained that the so-called street watchman was the person responsible for opening and closing the street gates and striking the watch at night, generally served by beggars. If there were unclaimed corpses lying on the road, they were also responsible for moving them.

"Public security relying on beggars, truly ridiculous." Liu Xiang shook his head. He already understood that these houses were actually the "police boxes" of modern society. Although 21st-century police boxes might not necessarily have police, at least there were security guards. Here they actually used a beggar.

"How much money is he given a month?"

"How much is given is a matter of the street; the yamen doesn't care." The scribe said cautiously.

Liu Xiang was almost made to cry by this bizarre urban management idea. A detective team member thought Liu Xiang wanted to see the watchman, so he walked to the door, kicked open the reed curtain blocking the door as a makeshift door, and shouted: "Come out! The Prefect Lord wants to see you!"

A man in a uniform full of patches came out from inside and knelt down with a thump in front of Liu Xiang: "This lowly one kowtows to Your Excellency."

Liu Xiang saw that his appearance was fairly clean, just that the clothes were patches upon patches. He said: "Get up and speak."

"Yes, Your Excellency."

Liu Xiang asked: "You strike the watch here; how much money and rice does the street give you a month?"

The watchman dared not look up, keeping his head lowered: "Replying to Your Excellency, no money or rice."

Liu Xiang said: "Without money or rice, what do you rely on to live?"

"Rely on the care of the neighbors, giving some leftover rice and porridge. Can still get by."

Liu Xiang suddenly looked back and asked the scribe: "Does the street not give the watchman money and rice?"

The scribe was named Jia Jue. Because he was usually considered to have a "conscience," treating the common people without extortion or fraud, and never making difficulties when taking money to do things, he belonged to the clerks with a good reputation. So he wasn't purged this time. Hearing Liu Xiang's question, he dared not delay and said: "Actually, there is..."

"Embezzled by whom?"

"The money and grain are all handed over to the Big Bones everywhere." Jia Jue said. The "Big Bones" he mentioned were beggar heads.

Liu Xiang nodded, thinking how could he forge this. Beggars also had gangs. However, watchmen were an important security force in ancient cities. Their night watch striking was not only for telling time but also had the effect of scaring and disturbing criminals. They could be organized and utilized now.

The group walked onto Chengxuan Street. This street was indeed "Grand." A visual estimate put the width at over 9 meters. It counted as a rarely broad street in this Guangzhou City. The most crucial thing was that the road surface was completely paved with green stone slabs—although the slabs were cracked or missing to varying degrees, and water had accumulated in many places.

"The average road width is about 9.2 meters. Our people have measured it." Lin Baiguang said.

"This width is up to the level of a two-lane road. A proper military parade won't work, but marching in a column of six is no problem. Gun carriages and baggage carts can also run."

"Hehe, that's why I invited you to come and see. It's not what you think." Lin Baiguang smiled, "Materials, this stuff, are often unreliable."

Chengxuan Street was a quite lively and prosperous main trunk road and commercial street in Guangzhou City, with numerous shops on both sides. Although because the city had just changed hands, many shops were worried about safety and boarded up without opening, and most stall vendors didn't set up stalls, there were still quite a few merchants open for business on the street. The appearance of their group immediately caused a commotion. People knew from their attire that these must be the big officials of the Australians. Some well-informed ones already knew this was the "Australian Prefect," and with a whoosh, they all hid on both sides of the street. The assistants who were shouting vigorously also became mute. The originally somewhat lively street suddenly became deserted.
