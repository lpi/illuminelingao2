# Chapter 1951 - The Youth

These chattering girls—she didn't know a single one of them, nor did she want to. To her, these people and their lives existed in an entirely different world. She couldn't understand their way of thinking, nor did she want to. As for the "affluent" life they led, Feng Shan wasn't envious in the slightest.

The waiting time was somewhat long and boring. She took out calculation paper from her bag and began working on a problem Feng Nuo had assigned her yesterday.

Yesterday, Feng Nuo had already given her the general approach to this problem, but the specific method still required her to figure out on her own. Normally, once she started calculating, she would become immersed in this wondrous world. But today was different; the upcoming meeting and the girls' incessant chatter in her ears made it difficult to concentrate.

Recently, there had been some slight changes in her life, causing a flutter in the heart of this young woman who had been immersed in "learning and more learning" for years. The letter from a few days ago in particular had kept her awake all night.

It wasn't that the letter's contents were particularly special—if anything, the letter was merely a trigger, evoking all sorts of thoughts she'd had over the years about herself, about Feng Nuo, and about the Executive Committee.

She wondered what the future would hold. Feng Shan set down her pencil and pondered in silence.

The chatter in the tea room suddenly quieted down—a young man had entered.

Store Number 43's customers were mainly the relatives and life secretaries of transmigrators, or at the very least the transmigrators' "family service staff." Apart from the occasional male transmigrator accompanying a life secretary, men rarely appeared here.

There were indeed transmigrators who kept male "life secretaries," but they were few and far between and never showed their faces at Store Number 43.

Yet the young man before them was clearly not a "young transmigrator." Though he wore the Academy's black uniform, the insignia on it indicated he was a member of the Fangshaodi Selection Group—not one born with "noble blood."

In theory, Store Number 43 didn't prohibit ordinary people from entering; anyone willing to spend money could come in to shop. But naturalized citizens and locals really wouldn't dare enter this place without someone to escort them.

However, the gathered girls immediately realized this was probably a transmigrator's "disciple," "student," or the next level up—"foster son."

Come to think of it, he certainly looked the part: a handsome, swarthy face; hair cropped in a buzz cut; a sturdy yet well-proportioned build; dignified bearing; composed and confident demeanor—all matching the standard image of the "New Chinese Man" that transmigrators most favored in propaganda posters. To be honest, not even many transmigrators themselves could achieve that look, but in various propaganda posters, such young men took center stage.

Under the gazes of a room full of young women, the young man's dark face reddened slightly. He quickly scanned the tea room, gently shook his head to refuse the approaching waitress, and strode toward the corner where Feng Shan sat with an 80-centimeter gait.

"So handsome!"

Though spoken in a lowered voice, in the suddenly quiet space it was clearly audible. This was followed by a wave of suppressed tittering. The young man's face seemed to redden further. He pretended to have heard nothing, walked to Feng Shan's side, and offered a standard 15-degree "greeting" bow.

Following Fangshaodi's general etiquette, Feng Shan stood up and extended her hand. The two shook hands lightly and immediately separated.

"Please forgive my slight tardiness," the young man said quietly.

"No matter, I only just arrived myself." Feng Shan put away her calculation notebook. "Please have a seat."

The two sat down. Feng Shan told the waitress to "bring another cup." The waitress had been watching in stunned amazement and only snapped out of it upon hearing the request, hurrying to fetch a cup.

The tea room that had been filled with chatter suddenly became very quiet. The girls all wanted to listen carefully to what this unexpected young stranger would say to this girl in the life secretary uniform—women always loved gossip. But they heard nothing. Feng Shan had chosen a seat in the corner, far from everyone else. Most critically, at first the two just sat in silence facing each other, each staring at their own teacup, not saying a word.

After several minutes of this silence, the young man finally broke the stillness between them.

"Senior Sister Feng, your asking me here today—" He looked around. "Isn't this somewhat inappropriate?"

"It's fine, this place is good." Feng Shan poured him a cup of tea. "Please."

"Thank you."

"I've read your most recent letter." Feng Shan took out a stack of envelopes bound with thin cord from her bag. "I completely understand your feelings."

"..."

"It's just... I can't accept them." As she spoke, Feng Shan pushed the envelopes toward his hand.

"You mean—"

"We're not possible." Feng Shan's tone was calm and measured. "Surely you understand this too."

"But Senior Sister, you told me..." The young man suddenly seemed to remember something and continued, "I could also ask Teacher to intervene—"

"No need. What I told you that day was my true feelings." Feng Shan placed her hand on her chest. "I wasn't deceiving you—we truly were happy when we were together. My refusal isn't because of status—this uniform means nothing to me."

"If that's the case, then why..."

"After our date the other day, I've been thinking a lot these past few days," Feng Shan said. "A person's time and energy are limited. I'm afraid I can't balance both studies and... feelings."

"Is studying really that important?!" The young man seemed somewhat agitated.

"How could it not be important?" Feng Shan said. "You and I—what do we rely on to live this worry-free life of scholarship? It's the Executive Committee's grace, and it's also because we're good at learning."

"Even so, there's still personal life," the young man seemed unable to comprehend her thinking. He stammered, "The transmigrators have also said that while learning and work are very important, personal life should also be balanced."

"Perhaps. But for me, personal life is learning." Feng Shan lowered her head. "I'm sorry."

An expression of despair and sadness appeared on the young man's face. It was a long while before he managed to force out a sentence: "Is it because of the transmigrator?"

Feng Shan nodded silently and said, "Compared to brief personal romantic happiness, I would rather devote my life to exploring the infinite knowledge of the Executive Committee—and this applies to everyone, not just you. Please take these letters back and burn them—keeping them might affect your future prospects. I originally wanted to write you a letter, but after several attempts nothing seemed right. In the end I felt it would be better to explain in person—a gentleman has no private words."

When Feng Shan returned to the machinery factory, dinner time had already passed.

Feng Nuo was in conversation with a transmigrator she didn't recognize. It wasn't Transmigrator Zhong, nor any of the transmigrators from the machinery factory or electrical sector who came by regularly, nor anyone from the project research team.

"Old Feng, this project is very important. We'll definitely be placing several sets of orders." The unfamiliar transmigrator said.

"Haha, that puts a lot of pressure on me. But this system is basically fully developed, and the sorting machine has also been finalized. The prototype will be delivered tomorrow. We'll test the whole system as fast as possible and get a batch into production. Besides your order, the Social Welfare Province and Police Headquarters are also pushing us." Feng Nuo was all smiles, showing no signs of pressure whatsoever. "Quality is guaranteed—lifetime warranty."

"That's wonderful. Then it's settled. And please take care of that Li Jianai for us."

"No problem at all, Old Wu. We'll definitely support your work."

They shook hands and exchanged a few more words before the unknown transmigrator took his leave.

Feng Shan felt somewhat puzzled—the visitor seemed interested in the punch card computer system, so why did he also mention Li Jianai? But she didn't ask further, simply saying, "Teacher, I'm back."

Feng Nuo didn't pay much attention, just gave a hum of acknowledgment. Then he suddenly noticed her eyes were somewhat red.

"Why are your eyes red?"

"Wind blew sand into them just now, so I rubbed them." Feng Shan blinked. "I've worked out the problem you assigned me. Please take a look and see if there are any issues."

"Just leave it on the desk. We'll look at it together later."

Feng Nuo had originally wanted to ask more, but at the moment his mind was elsewhere—he was still thinking about what the visitor had said.

The visitor was in fact Wu Fu, Director of the Technical Department of the Political Security General Bureau. Unsurprisingly, the Political Security Bureau was also very interested in establishing a punch card database and procuring punch card computer systems—they were the department most enthusiastic about collecting data and materials, and the efficiency of traditional manual classification and retrieval for massive amounts of data was inevitably low. The trial production of mechanical computers was good news. However, Wu Fu's other purpose in visiting was the matter of Li Jianai's work transfer.

Although the habitually self-assured Deputy Director had indicated there was no need to worry about this minor matter, internally the Political Security Bureau was still quite concerned about Li Jianai's situation. This hidden asset's case had implicated two transmigrators, Dugu Qiuhun and Lu Xuan. These two transmigrators' identities were already somewhat sensitive, and unfortunately the matter had now reached its current stalemate, causing considerable headaches for Zhou Botao and others.

Actually, this was purely an accident. From the start, the Political Security General Bureau had made clear it did not conduct "investigations" on transmigrators, much less had any plans to deliberately collect dirt on any transmigrator. This was also the basis for the Political Security Bureau's consistent claim that it never "investigated" transmigrators—after all, once such instructions existed, whether verbal or written, they would become trouble if the matter ever came to light.

Of course, they weren't that innocent either. The transmigrators were situated in an ocean of naturalized citizens, and even without deliberately collecting information, the ubiquity of the work network was enough to bear fruit unintentionally. All kinds of materials about transmigrators' words and deeds continued to flow onto the Political Security Bureau's desks, but for now they weren't processed—just simply filed for the record. They had only promised not to investigate transmigrators; they never said they would destroy all raw materials containing transmigrators' words and actions.
