# Chapter 1837 - Torture

Because of family misfortunes, Lian Nishang had almost fallen into the dusty world of prostitution, so she detested madams and their like to the extreme. Although the Interrogation Section had naturalized police officers trained in modern interrogation techniques, she insisted on picking Xie Buliao and a few other retained yamen runners from the Soap Squad—all old hands at torture who were cruel and merciless—to conduct the interrogation. The key was to kill the prestige of these madams and break their psychological advantage of having the power of life and death in the brothels; otherwise, the prostitutes would have misgivings and it would be difficult to open a breakthrough.

Seeing Section Chief Lian call his name, Xie Buliao couldn't curry favor fast enough. Moreover, this Han Qiaojie had offended him in the past; how could he let go of this opportunity to avenge a private grudge publicly and righteously? Lian Nishang didn't understand interrogation much, so she let Xie Buliao arrange it. After she asked a few questions about name and age, Xie Buliao took his subordinates up. Without a word, they first stripped off Han Qiaojie's skirt and clothes, tied her naked to a long bench like a pig, and soaked a small paddle woven from bamboo strips in cold water. Coming up, he gave her forty strokes with the small paddle immediately.

Public servants like Xie Buliao all had family-inherited skills, and knew how to control the severity of their blows at will. When he was young, he had a lover who was a *majie* (servant woman) in a brothel. This *majie* used to be a *laoju* (prostitute) in the brothel, but as she grew older and business declined, she was reduced to a servant. Xie Buliao intended to spend some money to redeem her. Unexpectedly, Han Qiaojie opened her mouth like a lion, demanding no less than three hundred taels of silver. The matter fell through. Later, the *majie* died of illness, and Xie Buliao always held a grudge.

So this time, his strikes were both heavy and ruthless. Poor Han Qiaojie, who usually lived a life of luxury and was a popular courtesan when she was a *laoju*, had never suffered much hardship. This beating frightened her out of her wits, and she even screamed "Help!"

The *laoju*, *doufenshui*, *majie*, and others were all gathered in the hall. Seeing the usually majestic and uncompromising madam beaten until her skin split and flesh tore, struggling and screaming miserably on the long bench like a naked fish about to dry up and die, they couldn't help but secretly cheer in their hearts. Those of Han Qiaojie's usual cronies: Muyun, Huang Xiang, and others, were pale and almost fainted.

Lian Nishang was secretly surprised. she had originally worried that these old public servants would show mercy to a madam like Han Qiaojie because of complex past social relationships, but she didn't expect this former runner to be so diligent. Judging from Han Qiaojie's hoarse cries of pain and pleas for mercy, and her desperate struggles regardless of the rope bindings, Xie Buliao not only didn't go easy on water but also added extra ingredients.

After forty strokes, Han Qiaojie was faint and had only one breath left. Her buttocks and thighs were swollen several fingers high like rising dough, bruised and black.

Lian Nishang frowned and said: "Why did you beat her so heavily? Beaten like this, how can we use torture during the interrogation?"

Xie Buliao bowed his waist and said respectfully: "Section Chief, you don't know. These madams and turtle-servants are the most tricky and vicious. If you don't knock out their prestige right away, they will never be honest. Besides, you are a woman, so that madam must have had thoughts of slackness and contempt. Therefore, this lowly one gave her a taste of suffering. As the saying goes, if the official isn't fearsome, the claws and teeth must be!"

Lian Nishang shook her head and said: "Although that is so, how do we use torture next?"

Xie Buliao laughed: "What's difficult about this? If we want to use the bastinado, this lowly one will first use a few strokes to open flowers on her buttocks, dispersing the bruised blood on her thighs. Then using the rod or whip, hitting another forty or fifty times won't kill her, at most leaving some scars—does a madam of *laoju* origin care about this? If the Section Chief pities her, this lowly one has iron chains here. First make her kneel on them to answer. If she is still dishonest, put on the finger crushers and pull once—even an iron man would have to speak!"

He said this calmly and leisurely, making Han Qiaojie, who had just recovered her senses, feel her liver and gall splitting with fear. Ignoring the burning pain in her thighs, she hurriedly cried out: "This servant is willing to confess! I beg the Master to spare the torture!"

Lian Nishang swept a glance at Han Qiaojie's cronies kneeling below. Each one was pale, wishing their heads could fall into their chest cavities. The *laoju*, on the other hand, stretched their necks to look, beginning to whisper to each other, some even revealing a hint of a smile.

This beating was effective, Lian Nishang thought.

Because the matters to be asked next involved the case, Lian Nishang had to give up the "public trial" drama—fortunately, with today's incident, Fangchun Court became the negative "example" in the rectification of the sex industry. Dealing with Han Qiaojie later would be a breeze.

The focus of the interrogation was the relationship between Fangchun Court and Master Liang. Han Qiaojie didn't dare to speak at first, only saying that because of Yuewan, the Liang family took care of Fangchun Court. This sounded reasonable to Lian Nishang, but it could fool outsider naturalized cadres, not local indigenous people. Xie Buliao knew her family had long-standing ties with the Liang family, so he said Han Qiaojie was dishonest and whipped her a few more times with a leather whip dipped in water.

These few lashes instantly split the skin and flesh of her already swollen buttocks, almost making Han Qiaojie's soul leave her body, howling like a slaughtered pig and begging for mercy. Everyone in the courtyard shivered at the sound.

"When you told Yao-sao to torture the girls and force free people into prostitution, did you ever think you would suffer this?" Lian Nishang was usually very serious and showed little emotion, but now feeling happy in her heart, she teased Han Qiaojie.

"It's all this servant's fault, this servant deserves death. This servant is willing to confess. I beg the Master to spare the torture—"

Han Qiaojie wept and sniffled, daring not conceal anything anymore. She confessed that the Liang family was indeed one of Fangchun Court's backers. The reason she said "one of" was because the Liang family valued their reputation heavily and didn't want to directly support a brothel. Usually, if there were matters involving officials or gentry, the Zhong family would come forward.

The Zhong family could barely count as gentry in Guangzhou city. The head of this family, Master Zhong Aijiao's ancestors were landlords in the countryside. His grandfather made a fortune doing business in the city. His descendants studied and produced a few Xiucai, counting as people of the scholarly class. Zhong Aijiao passed the Xiucai exam himself but never passed the Juren exam. When he was over forty, he simply bought a Title of Jian-Sheng Student. Master Zhong had money at home and became int-laws with Mo Rongxin, the manager of Wenlan Academy, securing the position of director of Wenlan Academy, openly mixing into the ranks of "gentry."

Gentry like Master Zhong naturally couldn't compare with the Liang family, but precisely because of their humble origins, they had somewhat of the style of Broken Boot Party members. Many things that proper gentry disdained or couldn't do were left for them to take the lead on. Once, on the birthday of Old Master Liang's concubine, Zhong Aijiao curried favor with a maid beside her, letting his own wife become sworn sisters with Master Liang's concubine, thus hooking up with the Liang family line.

Apart from this, Han Qiaojie didn't know much. Han Qiaojie moved frequently with the female relatives of the Zhong family, but couldn't completely connect with the female relatives of the Liang family. However, Fangchun Court had encountered difficulties several times in the past, all resolved through the Zhong family using the Liang Residence's influence. Liang Cunhou *shoulong* (buying out/de-virginating) Yuewan was also threaded by the Zhong family.

"Liang Cunhou claims to have never been close to women, why did he *shoulong* Yuewan?" Lian Nishang asked.

Han Qiaojie grinned and grimaced in pain: "What man doesn't love women? It's just that his family has strict rules, not allowing arbitrary connections with brothel women. If not taking them as concubines or maids, they have to be bought out completely to be household courtesans—the Liang family keeps their own opera troupe. When Master Zhong said Master Liang wanted to *shoulong* Yuewan, this servant was also surprised."

Four years ago, Yuewan was seventeen, already a very popular *qingguanren* (courtesan who sells art not body) locally. Many gentry and wealthy landlords wanted to *shoulong* her. Han Qiaojie naturally waited for the highest price, preparing to sell for a good sum. Unexpectedly, Master Zhong quietly visited Fangchun Court, saying Liang Cunhou intended to *shoulong* Yuewan.

The price for "bedding" was six thousand taels of silver. Although this figure wasn't more than other rich men, it was above average. Han Qiaojie wanted to "sell to the highest bidder," but dared not offend the Liang family, so she painfully agreed.

After Liang Cunhou *shoulong* Yuewan, he immediately started construction, renovating a side courtyard of Fangchun Court to keep his beauty in a golden house.

"...The servants used there are all sent by the Liang Residence. Although connected to this servant's courtyard by a door, the guard is usually very strict. Except for taking some wine, food, and clothing from the servant's courtyard, there is almost no interaction... Even Yuewan, this servant only sees her once or twice every ten days or half a month."

Prostitutes and madams were people extremely good at observing expressions. Although currently suffering from severe torture and unbearable pain, she still sensed from Lian Nishang's interrogation content that the Australians had designs on the Liang family, so she hurriedly tried to distance herself.

"How often does Liang Cunhou come to Yuewan's courtyard? Besides him, is there anyone else?"

"Sometimes he comes every day, sometimes he doesn't come for months. Moreover, Yuewan's courtyard has a separate gate, he comes and goes at his convenience, and this servant doesn't know completely." Han Qiaojie said, "As for guests, he often feasts in Yuewan's courtyard. I heard there are many guests."

"Do you remember who they are?"

Han Qiaojie wanted to say she didn't remember, but fearing Xie Buliao's leather whip would lash down again, she busily said: "This servant remembers some, but there are some this servant doesn't know—"

Lian Nishang asked her to name all the people she remembered one by one. Han Qiaojie dared not evade, naming five or six people she felt were less important.

"...Just these?"

"These are the frequent visitors, this servant remembers. As for guests coming, there are really quite a few. It's just that it's been a long time, I can't think of them all at once. Some guests, this servant doesn't know either..."

Lian Nishang thought she could ask in detail slowly. She turned the topic to the critical point: "Do you know about Yuewan inviting a Daoist priest for fortune-telling recently?"

"I know! I know!" Han Qiaojie nodded hurriedly, saying Yuewan had not been in good health recently, and inviting many doctors had no effect. Later, Master Liang said there was a Daoist from the capital with deep cultivation, so he invited him to tell Yuewan's horoscope.

"...This Daoist also read faces for many people in this courtyard—his cultivation is truly remarkable!"

"Did he say anyone's horoscope clashed with Yuewan's?"

"He said so. For this reason, Master Liang changed many of the people serving around her."

"When was this?"

"More than two months ago," Han Qiaojie said.

"Oh, what is this Daoist's name?" Lian Nishang asked.

"He is called Daoist Wood-Stone."
