# Chapter 1963 - Adjustment

Wang Qiyi knew that the so-called non-tax revenue was "confiscated property"—the witchcraft case, the clearing of the Guan Di Temple group, and the crackdown on brokerage houses implicated many of Guangzhou's gentry and wealthy households, allowing the Planning Commission and Wudaokou to make a huge windfall.

Because Guangzhou would gradually transition to become the Executive Committee's new capital, not only did a new urban area need to be built on Henan Island, but the old urban area also needed corresponding renovation. Therefore, the State Council appeared relatively generous with construction appropriations, and a large portion of this "windfall" was allocated to the Guangzhou Municipal Government.

This made Liu Xiang very happy indeed, but the gentlemen at Wudaokou all knew that such windfalls were unsustainable. Moreover, a very bad consequence was that sudden wealth from "striking down local tyrants" would cause administrative leaders to lose a correct assessment of fiscal capacity, leading to large-scale expansion—which could ultimately result in a broken capital chain...

Consequently, the pressure on the finance and tax sector became even heavier—not only did they have to manage money well, but they also had to obtain money as much as possible, so that Guangzhou city's construction projects could continue.

"As a local leader, the impulse to engage in massive infrastructure construction is understandable." Wang Qiyi sat down in a rattan reclining chair, and Ai Yixin brought tea and cigars.

Since Wang Qiyi didn't smoke, Ai Zhixin didn't light a cigar either; both chose tea.

While waiting for the cook to deliver dinner, Ai Zhixin asked when Zhang Xiaoqi would come to Guangzhou.

"Soon, probably in about fifteen days. Just the last bit of training courses; she'll depart as soon as classes are over."

"Then it'll be very inconvenient for you to live here alone. I'll arrange a maid for you..."

"Hey, hey, no need, no need..."

"Look at you getting anxious," Ai Zhixin chuckled. "When I say maid, I mean a maid, no other implications. Living alone, you can eat at the cafeteria, but are you going to tidy the room, clean, and do laundry yourself?"

Wang Qiyi thought this was indeed a realistic need. Refusing outright would be ungracious, so he expressed his thanks.

Dinner was served, and the two ate together, talking as they ate—a "working meal."

Wang Qiyi asked about the current development of the Finance and Tax Bureau's work, especially regarding taxation. He felt that since he was in taxation, it was best not to meddle in finance. Although currently, due to manpower shortages, revenue and expenditure used the same system—procedurally this was very inappropriate.

In the long run, finance and tax would inevitably separate. As a fellow tax professional, Ai Zhixin surely knew the relationship between the State Taxation Administration and the Ministry of Finance in the original timeline—seemingly equal but actually half a level lower. A leader from the State Taxation Administration "transferring laterally" to the Ministry of Finance was actually a "promotion." This man was very ambitious, and Cheng Dong wouldn't stay in the Finance Director position—analogous to the Minister of Finance—forever. The Australian Song's plate was getting larger and larger. Now departmental leaders would at worst end up as "Vice-National Level" officials not in the Standing Committee in the future, so ministerial leadership positions would open up. Even if the future Australian Song Empire's Taxation Administration and Finance Ministry really became equal, Ai Zhixin would mostly likely choose the Finance Ministry. It could be seen simply from Ai Zhixin changing the "Tax Bureau" to "Finance and Tax Bureau"—a one-word difference made a world of difference. As Director of the Finance and Tax Bureau, although doing tax work, he could logically concurrently manage finance work and still belong to the finance system. It would be very justifiable to sit in the Finance Minister's seat later. In that case, if the tax system became independent one day, and he and his wife weren't too old, the position of Director of the Taxation Administration would likely be theirs. After all, there were few transmigrators working in tax.

One could imagine that the tax work in Guangzhou and subsequently Guangdong would inevitably be frighteningly large.

Wang Qiyi wasn't afraid of work, but this meant that in coming years he would run around, stay up late working overtime, and have less and less time with his wife and children... This gave Wang Qiyi, who was naturally very family-oriented, a headache.

Ai Zhixin gave a rough introduction to the current status of the Finance and Tax Bureau. Currently, finance and tax work was basically operating by relying on the old system. Firstly due to lack of people; secondly waiting for the final plan approval from Wudaokou. However, after eliminating the brokerage houses and establishing some professional wholesale markets, they had at least started collecting circulation taxes on grain, firewood/charcoal, vegetables... these daily bulk commodities.

"Did you bring the stamp duty stamps this time?" Ai Zhixin suddenly remembered and asked.

"Printed," Wang Qiyi didn't know why he cared so much about this. "According to your suggestion, the printing factory made entirely new engravings this time, and the paper was also upgraded. The samples are in the document bag; they should be on your desk tomorrow."

Stamp duty had actually already begun implementation, but they were using old stamps from the early days in Lingao. Ai Zhixin felt the old stamps were too crude and lacked "authority," so he specially ordered new tax stamps.

"What does Wudaokou think of the plan I sent up?" Ai Zhixin finally turned to the main topic.

The Finance Province had held a closed-door discussion on Ai Zhixin's plan for a whole day. However, most people at Wudaokou didn't know much about taxation; they understood macro concepts like finance and taxation, or taxation and economy, but lacked understanding on the question of *how* to collect tax.

Ultimately, it was Wang Qiyi and Zhang Xiaoqi who revised the draft based on Ai Zhixin's original plan. Referencing the *Tax Collection Administration Law* and implementation rules from the old timeline, combined with the reality of the Australian Song—especially personnel quality and printing technology levels—they preliminarily determined a system of dual emphasis on inspection and collection, with management as support. This amounted to overturning half of Ai Zhixin's design. Wang Qiyi had originally thought that after producing the new plan, he would inevitably have to argue with Ai Zhixin. Unexpectedly, after hearing Wang Qiyi's analysis of grassroots taxation, Ai Zhixin readily agreed. *He's a doer!* Wang Qiyi thought, breathing a huge sigh of relief. If they clashed on such top-level design matters, the work below couldn't be done.

Next came the discussion of plan details.

The new plan preliminarily determined to position the newly established Finance and Tax Bureau's tax function on the basic function of tax departments: collection and management. A complex series of issues like tax categories, rates, preferences, scope, and subjects would be thrown to others at "Wudaokou." The tax department would only provide reference opinions, with final execution decided by the State Council via provisional measures.

Ai Zhixin was somewhat reluctant about this modification. According to his vision, he planned to handle not just tax policy but also fiscal policy within the Finance and Tax Bureau. But Wang Qiyi said his wife had roughly assessed it: there were only so many barely usable naturalized citizen cadres. Although carbon paper and special receipts were available, there were no computers—cobbling one together for use was possible, but if it couldn't be popularized it had little significance. Personnel quality was low; spreading the operation too wide would only lead to excessive inspection costs and rampant fraud. As for such professional issues as policy formulation, never mind naturalized citizens, even he and Wang Qiyi hadn't done it. Even in the old timeline, this wasn't something a tax bureau had to worry about.

The most professional personnel would be stuffed into the inspection team to serve as the Tax Bureau's "sword handle." At the same time, female naturalized citizen cadres who were meticulous, responsible, strong learners, and good communicators would be selected to handle front-desk collection and publicity work. On this basis, the position of "tax administrator" would be reactivated to be responsible for urging reporting and payment and for tax publicity. New tax administrators would be filled by newcomers. Their work was simple: delivering tax bills to notify taxpayers to pay on time, or visiting to urge payment when taxpayers were overdue, while doing some publicity work.

Tax administrators were not allowed to directly collect tax payments. All tax payments had to be made by the taxpayer or their agent at the tax collection hall. Considering 17th-century cash management levels, it was tentatively decided that the day's tax payments would be balanced daily by the collection hall accountant after work and remitted within 48 hours.

Although the Central Reserve Bank, this "central bank," had been established, in reality the Guangzhou branch of this "central bank" was just the Guangzhou branch of Delong hanging up another sign. So-called two signs, one team—though accounts and ledgers were already separated.

The Delong Guangzhou branch, hanging the central bank sign, continued to play the "national treasury" role. It needed to open a separate tax suspense account and an independent national treasury account. After Delong reconciled the collected tax payments daily, it should issue a tax payment receipt within 24 hours, to be retrieved by the Finance and Tax Bureau tax accountant (not the hall accountant) for booking and filing. Tax receipts uniformly used manual tax payment certificates rather than payment slips, to facilitate filling in tax amounts by household. Tax payment documents adopted a model of 2-ply payment certificate + 4-ply summary payment slip (omitting the copies for the commercial bank and the useless ones from the old timeline). As for the right to verify tax amounts and audit accounts, it was all centralized to a specialized verification and audit team for calculation and determination. This set of procedures could be said to be full of holes to anyone with slight tax knowledge. But this was already the limit of what they could do with existing conditions.

"Lack of people, lack of technology—this is the best we can do however we toss it," Wang Qiyi said helplessly. Without high-quality talent and advanced technology, even collecting money couldn't be done smoothly... truly a vicious cycle.

"Let's do more inspections when the time comes. At least set up the stage first." Looking at the final draft that was neither fish nor fowl, Ai Zhixin seemed to have suddenly lost half his spirit.

"By the way, we have to submit a report to Cheng Dong. This practice of two signs, one team can't continue like this. Now Delong acts as both a commercial bank and national treasury. Although there are separate ledgers and accounts for the central bank now, the actual operation is still by the same group of people. Mixing things together like this will cause problems sooner or later." Wang Qiyi dealt a lot with the People's Bank and Finance Bureau in grassroots units, so he understood quite a bit about their internal management.

"This is indeed a problem—but I'm afraid he has the will but not the power to solve it. Also, the issue of our special fiscal account here still hasn't been resolved. What exactly is planned for this system?"

Currently, Guangzhou's fiscal expenditure was still in the "full appropriation" mode. Both Liu Xiang and Ai Zhixin felt things weren't running smoothly.
