# Chapter 1751 - The Tofu Workshop

If it was a lane where wealthy families had gathered, the work was easier—there would only be a few households along the whole street. But for streets of ordinary middle-class families where household gates were numerous, it was easy to miscount. If one knocked on the wrong door, an earful of curses from the residents would inevitably follow.

Zhang Yu saw that the tofu shop owner's daughter was not at the counter, so he returned to his shop. Inside, he found his parents sorting through several sheets of paper—which he recognized as their house deed and land title. These were the most precious possessions in the household; growing up, Zhang Yu had rarely laid eyes on them. They were normally kept in an iron box, stored away with the utmost care. Why had they been brought out today?

Upon inquiry, he learned that the Australians had not only come to "register households" today, but had also inspected the house deed and land title, and had even measured the dimensions.

"Look, they've stamped a verification seal on them," his father said.

Zhang Yu looked closer. Indeed, both the house deed and land title bore a newly affixed red stamp. This stamp differed from the official seals of the Ming—it was circular with a "four-pointed star" at its center. Zhang Yu knew this was called the "Morning Star." Encircling the star was a line of flattened Song-style characters: "Guangzhou Special Municipality Real Estate Registry Verification Seal."

"Once this stamp is affixed, the house and land are officially secured," Zhang Yu's mother remarked with a sigh. Each change of dynasty was a redistribution of social wealth. For a petty urban bourgeoisie like them, generations of toil had amounted to nothing more than these bits of house and land. Naturally, they valued them above all else.

"How much did it cost?" Zhang Yu knew that all official business came with expenses. Last year, when he had sat for the *tongzi* examination, he'd had to pay to receive his test papers, and once inside the examination hall, there were unavoidable tips to "reward" the proctors.

"It didn't cost any money..." Father Zhang's joy was tinged with a shadow of worry between his brows. He said quietly, "I'm just afraid this change of regime won't last."

If the government forces returned and the Australians simply walked away, the stamp on these deeds would be indelible. If the yamen chose to make trouble over it, the consequences could range from minor to catastrophic. With a ruthless and black-hearted official, this alone could ruin an entire family.

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's mother grew anxious again, stammering, "Then... then... what should we do?"

Father Zhang could offer no coherent answer. Of course, when they came to re-register, one could claim to have no documents—but he had heard that the Australians had already posted proclamations throughout the city: any property without proper deed or title would be deemed "illegal construction" and ordered demolished within a set timeframe. And this was no empty threat—on Chengxuan Street, whether it was a century-old shop or a tiny stall, anything classified as "illegal" had been razed clean.

Zhang Yu, however, said, "In my view... the government won't be coming back..."

His voice was very low, but it still startled his parents. Though this was the Australians' era now, it had only been a dozen days or so. No one dared declare that the Ming was finished and would never retake Guangzhou.

"Don't talk nonsense..." his father whispered harshly, "Don't say such things outside!"

Zhang Yu nodded. "I understand. But based on what I've observed these past days: the Australians have strict discipline, and the high and low are united in selfless purpose. The whole realm will surely rally to them, carrying their provisions and following like shadows." Seeing his parents not quite grasping his literary flourish, he added, "When the Australian police came into our shop to conduct business, they didn't eat a single pastry or take a single wen. On this point alone, the Ming won't be coming back!"

Liu San stepped from the narrow, dim shop onto the bright street and immediately felt a sense of relief—it had been suffocating inside. The shop floor, barely ten square meters, contained not only a counter but also a massive kneading table and a sizeable oven. Various tools of the trade and raw materials crammed every remaining inch. Once the census team had entered, there was barely room to turn around.

A strange odor permeated the room: the distinctive fragrance of roasting confections—rendered fat, dried fruit, and flour; the musty smell of damp equipment; the smoky scent of burning charcoal; and an indescribable body odor. He had noticed bedding stuffed carelessly beneath the large kneading table—presumably where the apprentices and shop hands slept at night. And beside the oven, someone had actually wedged a chamber pot.

Looking back at the "Designated Supplier of Da Shijie" placard in the shop, Liu San couldn't help a rueful inner smile. How had Zhang Yikun managed this? A designated supplier, indeed—with sanitary conditions like these, it would be strange if the food produced here didn't cause problems.

Liu San was wearing a police uniform—to conceal his status as a Senator. He had proposed to Lin Baiguang that he wanted to venture deep into the streets and alleys to inspect Guangzhou's public health situation. Lin Baiguang had arranged for him to join a different census team each day; this way, he could observe discreetly while using household registration as a pretext to enter places normally inaccessible to outsiders.

He wanted a genuine look at the actual sanitary conditions of Guangzhou—particularly the scope of the epidemic prevention challenges they faced.

The Guangdong Campaign was not expected to result in many combat casualties. The greatest pressure on the health department actually came from epidemic prevention. Guangzhou was a metropolis of five or six hundred thousand inhabitants; even in the modern era, the burden of public health and disease prevention would be considerable, let alone in the seventeenth century, when sanitary conditions were appalling and infectious diseases ran rampant.

The sanitary conditions of ancient cities were extremely poor. Although in the twenty-first century Liu San had read countless treatises, monographs, and documentaries about the sanitation infrastructure of ancient cities—full of phrases like "the wisdom of ancient working people" and "ahead of its time"—if not for the plentiful authentic photographs and written records left by the living specimen of late-Qing medieval society, he might well have believed them and assumed that Hengdian Film Studios was an accurate reconstruction of the past.

But the reality was far different. Liu San was well aware that most medieval cities had no—or only minimal—sanitary water supply and sewage systems. Each spring and summer, epidemic diseases would rage unchecked. "Sunstroke"—often caused by unhygienic food—was one of the most common causes of death in summer.

This was precisely why the Senatorial Council kept its distance from Ming cities and preferred to build new towns on vacant land. As Wen Desi put it: "Ancient cities are, in essence, garbage heaps infested with rats, bedbugs, fleas, and every manner of pathogen. No amount of silk, marble, or scenic landmarks can mask the stench they emit."

One of Liu San's tasks was to safeguard the health of this city. In particular, he needed to stamp out every latent threat to public health and epidemic prevention—malignant infectious diseases in the seventeenth century were no laughing matter.

But as he followed the census team through the streets, he quickly realized this would be no easy undertaking. Seventeenth-century Guangzhou was not an overcrowded city. Like all traditional Chinese cities, the area within the walls contained much vacant land: some was left behind when residences and temples fell into ruin, while other plots had never been built upon at all. These tracts held vegetable gardens, paddy fields, and even the occasional scattered graveyard.

Yet residential dwellings and shops were remarkably cramped. This strange phenomenon puzzled him. He asked Jia Jue, a retained clerk from the Revenue Office, who explained that though urban land was plentiful and prices not particularly high, the cost of building was prohibitive. A small plot of land was within reach of many ordinary citizens, but to properly construct a large house was beyond most people's means—the price of brick and tile was simply too steep. To say nothing of common folk and petty households, even middle-class families building homes had to mix in scrap brick and salvaged tile. Only grand lineage houses or Buddhist temples and government offices could afford to build with properly dressed bricks laid in neat, mortared joints.

Traditionally crafted bricks and tiles relied entirely on manual labor, and firing them was both time-consuming and fuel-intensive, resulting in low output and correspondingly high prices.

Bricks and tiles were expensive, and timbers for beams and pillars were no cheaper. Guangzhou sat in the Pearl River Delta, where no building-quality timber grew nearby; all of it had to be shipped from upriver in the Pearl River basin. The longer the journey, the higher the cost—even tofu would fetch the price of meat.

Having spent over ten days in Guangzhou, Liu San had gained a deeper understanding of seventeenth-century life. Not only industrially manufactured goods but natural resources as well were extraordinarily expensive. Compared to the rock-bottom cost of labor, the only explanation was abysmal productivity.

Despite having land available, housing remained cramped and residential population density was high. Scenes like the Zhang family's pastry shop—where apprentices and shop hands slept on makeshift beds atop the shop floor at night—were ubiquitous among the city's merchants and workshops.

More alarming still, on the government-owned land outside the city walls along the moat, there were shanty settlements of the urban poor. These were not the "shanty redevelopment areas" of twenty-first-century Chinese urban renewal, nor the slums of Brazil or India, but an even more primitive version—almost no structures taller than a person, just "rolling-on-the-ground shacks." Constructed directly from bamboo poles, straw, and scrap wood on the damp, muddy banks of the creeks, often right beside potter's fields and mass graves. Some shanty areas were built directly atop "charity plots"—living side by side with the dead.

Crowded living conditions, drainage facilities that were practically nonexistent, no public latrines whatsoever, open dung vats everywhere, crisscrossing waterways choked with years of unscooped sludge and reeking to high heaven... Liu San thought to himself: this was nothing less than the perfect breeding ground for epidemic outbreaks. How on earth had the Guangzhou of old managed to survive? He would have to get to the bottom of this when he returned.

He hadn't intended to inspect the tofu workshop—this place's conditions were surely no better than the walnut pastry shop. But then he reconsidered: tofu production required large quantities of water. It couldn't rely on hauled water; there must be a well. He might as well check the water quality.

Walking into the tofu workshop, he saw that registration was in progress. He paid it no mind and surveyed the surroundings instead. This, too, was a shop-cum-workshop. The floor was bare earth, quite muddy from the heavy water use in tofu-making. Straw sacks had been laid over it for easier footing. The pot for boiling soy milk, the wooden buckets for holding it, and the boards for pressing tofu looked reasonably clean, covered with yellowed white cloth. But behind the soybean-boiling stove was a heap of raked-out ashes, alongside a stack of firewood. The soybeans, stored in straw sacks, lay directly on the earthen floor atop nothing more than a tattered reed mat underneath.
