# Chapter 2044 - Talent Shi Misi (Smith)

"I heard street rumors claiming the house is to be confiscated. As you instructed, I didn't investigate."

"Mm, correct." The middle-aged man sighed deeply. "These hair-thieves appear crude, but they're actually deep thinkers with comprehensive plans—everything interlocked. You must have realized what they intend for the city's gentry. Remember, particularly at this juncture, you and I must remain composed and act with extreme caution. One misstep means eternal ruin."

"I understand, but the Lin family..."

"Don't fret excessively. Young Master Liang has his own arrangements."

"But Young Master Lin contributed substantial funds and effort. Proceeding thus might dispirit our allies."

"You think the hair-thieves are easily managed? Days ago, genuine hair-thieves led a team to the Liang mansion. Making such a spectacle, would they depart without extracting their pound of flesh? Achieving great enterprises requires disregarding trifles. Besides, Young Master Lin was oblivious anyway. The hair-thieves are ruthless but don't aim to destroy morale. The Lin family offended the new dynasty—spending silver to avert disaster won't impede the greater plan." Seeing Advisor Liao about to speak again, the middle-aged man waved dismissively. "The account clearing early this year was executed admirably. That false hair-thief petty officer at the Liang mansion discovered nothing these past days. Tomorrow I'll expose a few minor discrepancies to let him complete his task and depart. But on your end, are the account books documenting the monetary transactions for *that matter* still retained?"

"As Second Brother commanded, all burned..."

"Truly? Speaking privately as brothers—if you haven't burned them, hurry and transcribe a set while memory serves..." The middle-aged man's voice dropped meaningfully. "One cannot depend entirely upon others. Beware of being discarded after serving your purpose. These private accounts constitute your ultimate life-preserving talisman."

"Understood, understood." Advisor Liao nodded while glancing sidelong at the middle-aged man. "Is Second Brother returning tonight?"

"At this hour? The streets swarm with police and foreigners. Are you attempting to implicate me?"

"Ha ha, then lodge at my residence, Second Brother." Advisor Liao removed the cloth from the window, stepped out, and clapped twice. "Manager Zhou, summon those two girls to help Master Mai relax..."

There's nothing worse than dreaming about a man, except remembering it upon waking. Wang Qiyi reflected with irritation.

Yesterday his wife had finally reached Guangzhou, and after several joyful rounds of intimate exchange through the night, he should have slept contentedly. Instead, he'd dreamed of Shi Misi.

Curse it all. The more Wang Qiyi pondered, the more awkward he felt, regretting his insistence on summoning this "talent" to the office yesterday for a "tax-enterprise consultation." The man's appearance was genuinely unfortunate—corpulent and apparently somewhat lame? Initially, Wang Qiyi worried he would feign ignorance, so he deliberately attempted to entrap him verbally. But he soon discovered his concerns unnecessary. This Second Master Shi didn't shy from demonstrating his comprehension of the Council of Elders' various policies and technologies. He even grasped the newspapers' significance, discerning the meaning embedded within articles—this revelation impressed Wang Qiyi.

Clever natives existed previously, but conversations with them proved tedious—either "Chief speaks reasonably" or "I hadn't considered thoroughly," mere "teaching fish to swim." Unlike this Shi Misi, who possessed genuine confidence and articulated logically why his business operated as it did, without that servile demeanor of natives who kowtow and confess guilt the instant an Elder poses a question. Near the conversation's conclusion, Wang Qiyi mentioned the Lin family. Shi Misi candidly stated the Lin family still conducted affairs according to tradition; he had counseled Lin Zunxiu, but not being household head, his words carried no weight. His own family had terminated monetary dealings with the Lin family after remitting taxes in the first quarter and was currently reconciling accounts.

A shrewd individual—but he sold out his associates remarkably swiftly. Weren't they all members of that "Yuyuan Society"? Truly disloyal. While admiring his acumen, Wang Qiyi profoundly despised these gentry scions internally.

But ultimately, family interests always reign supreme, let alone such "allies."

Second Master Shi's expression of forthright candor made Wang Qiyi profoundly uncomfortable. After all, he was merely "exploiting legal loopholes," not "violating law."

"This person is genuinely talented! But employing him likely won't prove as reassuring as other native collaborators."

Native collaborators like Gao Ju and Zhang Yu, though harboring their own calculations, actually depended on certain "personal relationships" with the Council of Elders. They valued their personal connection with their contact Elder highly, employing every method to "maintain" this bond. Though they studied the Council of Elders' laws and policies, they didn't comprehend them thoroughly, relying more heavily on the Elder's private "interpretation." They might question regulations but executed them vigorously. In essence, their relationship rested on trust blending "profit," "personal affection," and "long-term partnership."

Second Master Shi's approach differed completely. They understood they couldn't attach themselves to the Council of Elders swiftly, much less gain "trust," but they grasped the secrets of the Council of Elders' governance faster than other traditional merchants, fully exploiting "the Council of Elders' rule of law" to profit themselves.

Such individuals, compared to merchants supported by the Council of Elders, though suspected of "savage growth," were undeniably the most vigorous and thoughtful cohort.

If such people could be controlled, they would benefit the Council of Elders' great enterprise. But should they stumble, they would become oversized ticking bombs, causing tremendous trouble—Wang Qiyi had witnessed numerous such cases in the old timeline.

Truly a dilemma. Wang Qiyi examined Shi Misi's dossier on the table, worrying secretly.

That wasn't the sole vexation. At breakfast, Wang Qiyi received confirmation from Ai Zhixin that the application for Salina to transfer to the Economic Crimes Investigation Division had been rejected. Since obtaining preliminary approval from Cheng Dong over two weeks prior, Ai Zhixin and he had been preparing systems, personnel, positions, and office space, hoping to make Salina feel valued so she could work steadily in her new post. After all, in this political monstrosity that was the Council of Elders, having one additional Elder in the department meant more than merely another worker—it also signified subtly strengthening the department's voice within the Council. Now this vacillation gave both of them profound frustration. Even stranger was the Administration Council's rationale for rejection: Salina's current post was critical and unsuitable for transfer or concurrent appointment. If Wang Qiyi hadn't learned from his wife's letter what had actually transpired within the Council, he would have suspected the Administration Council leadership was too indifferent to fabricate a proper excuse.

This transfer, which appeared eminently appropriate to the Administration Council leadership, inevitably triggered factional disputes during implementation.

Their application encountered resistance from the outset. First, the Han-Supremacists questioned whether the Xue Ziliang and Salina pair—both ABCs and new immigrants—occupied excessively important positions. The Special Reconnaissance Team and Elder Security Bureau (commonly termed Secret Service) were conspicuous enough; now they desired more. Many others perceived Salina must belong to the "North American Gang" or "Otaku Party," and since the "Otaku Party" already had Qian Shuiting at the center, Xue Ziliang and Qian Shuixie in the military, Panpan in propaganda, and Zheng Shangjie in commerce, Salina assuming control of the Economic Crimes Investigation Division would mean occupying a core position in finance as well. If the "Otaku Party" successfully extended their influence this time, they would lack nothing in power, silver, firearms, and public voice—their ascendancy to dominance would be predetermined. This prospect displeased many.

Such clamor didn't initially affect the Administration Council's judgment; the transfer application passed preliminary review. But an unexpected incident later sparked a tempest within the Council, directly demolishing the Finance Department's calculations.

At the Council of Elders' Navy's inception, the Naval faction aspired to construct an imperial navy vastly surpassing the old timeline's British Empire, sailing the seven seas. Naturally, as a target to emulate and transcend, the British Navy's "engage the enemy upon sight" regulation was enshrined as sacred doctrine. "The principle of engaging enemies upon sight witnessed and guided the British Empire Navy from weakness to strength, from the North Atlantic to dominating the seven seas. Now, we—yes, we—must engrave it into our own imperial navy's essence. Let our warriors charge forward courageously! The crown of maritime hegemony can only be forged by naval guns!" So proclaimed Elder Wang, then a staff officer in Navy Command, when expounding this operational principle at the Elder Assembly. At that time, the Council Navy had just eliminated Zheng Zhilong with overwhelming force, and Liu Xiang had surrendered with his entire organization. Everyone felt like monarchs sweeping the world. Hearing Staff Officer Wang's impassioned "exposition," some emotional Elders even leaped onto their seats, pumping fists and chanting slogans supporting the Navy. The Naval matter passed easily without objection, except for the somewhat darkened countenances of "Young Officers Club" members like Wei Aiwen and Zhang Bailin.

However, impassioned emotions cannot provide sustenance, nor resolve practical problems. Just over a month ago, a certain peripheral Elder, while returning to Hainan from official duties with "Eunuch Zhao" in Hangzhou, was aboard a navy warship conducting night navigation when the lookout spotted an unidentified vessel. The duty officer immediately rang the assembly bell per regulations. Unable to visually identify friend or foe, and receiving no response to the initial light signal query, the captain followed the "engage upon sight" principle and immediately commanded the ship to assume attack position, preparing to engage. At this juncture, the awakened passenger Elder approached to inquire about the situation. Upon learning the warship he occupied was about to enter combat, and particularly hearing the opposing ship probably wasn't as swift, he immediately refused, demanding the captain prioritize his safety, abandon combat, and turn away immediately, threatening to relieve the captain of command. During the altercation, the opposing vessel entered range. The naturalized captain disregarded the Elder's threat and ordered fire. After a broadside salvo, the opponent halted immediately. Naval inspection revealed it was a smuggler ship that hadn't purchased a sailing flag.
