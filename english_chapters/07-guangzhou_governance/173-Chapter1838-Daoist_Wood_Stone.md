# Chapter 1838 - Daoist Wood-Stone

The confession Lian Nishang obtained at Fangchun Court soon reached Mu Min's desk. Mu Min ordered a copy made immediately and forwarded to Wu Mu. Liang Cunhou was already on the Political Security Bureau's "observation list," and any material involving him or his family would be copied and added to the newly established file.

The reconnaissance work on Liang Cunhou was the Political Security Bureau's affair; Mu Min wouldn't interfere. But she vaguely sensed some connection between Fangchun Court and the Mao Family Inn case. This was an intuition forged by years of police work. She sent Lian Nishang a warrant, ordering her to "dig up the roots and grab typical examples" at Fangchun Court—specifically to investigate the persecution of prostitutes within the brothel.

Mu Min revealed this matter at the internal briefing, and it immediately aroused strong interest from various parties concerning Fangchun Court. Rectifying the sex industry was one of the Senate's important administrative priorities in Guangzhou. It involved not only positive factors like "transforming social atmosphere," "social reform," and "women's liberation," but for the local government, it also offered benefits in both "rectifying public security" and "tax revenue." Therefore, relevant departments all requested deep involvement in this event, using it as a "typical example."

Wen Desi, who presided over the meeting, immediately waved his big pen and announced that various departments would form a joint working group at Fangchun Court to carry out "on-site office work."

Once this order was issued, the Propaganda Department rushed ahead of everyone. Dingding first sent people to produce special reports, closely followed by Mayor Liu dispatching personnel to be stationed there, and then naturalized cadres from the Commerce Bureau and Purple Lightning Tower Entertainment Co., Ltd. also arrived... The entrance of Fangchun Court buzzed with traffic and constant comings and goings. Everyone on Music Workshop Street understood: Fangchun Court was finished.

Mu Min was naturally happy to have everyone help. Moreover, her true intention was mainly to use this to pressure Liang Cunhou, forcing him to make a move.

As long as he moved, there would be openings.

*The next one to clean up*, Mu Min thought, *would be the Guan Di Temple group. That abscess was also due to be lanced.*

"Old Immortal, how should we take the next step?"

Still in the adobe house in the small courtyard in a humble alley of Guangzhou city, a layman and a Daoist spoke by the window.

"Is Yue Wan's side safe?"

"Although Fangchun Court has become a pot of boiling water, her side remains calm. The hair-thieves haven't come to bother. Coming and going is neither prohibited nor questioned." Manager Hu nodded. "Calculating from this search, the Young Master is truly blessed by heaven!"

"This is all merit accumulated by your master treating subordinates well over the years," the Daoist stroked his beard. "It's just a shame that Fangchun Court is ruined."

"Whatever Old Immortal says is right. It's just that Miss Suiyun suffered quite a bit." Manager Hu sighed. "My Young Master also wishes to ask the Old Immortal for advice. Can he visit Yue Wan's side or not?"

The Daoist shook his head. "Naturally, he cannot. The hair-thieves searching Yue Wan's courtyard means they inevitably became suspicious of your master—that's one consideration. Second, the hair-thieves are raising a massive case at Fangchun Court. I hear Han Qiaojie, Mu Yun, and others have all suffered severe torture; they've likely confessed everything. Third, with hair-thieves now swarming Fangchun Court and the sound of beatings shaking the sky, what elegant young master would rush there to enjoy such scenery? Abnormality suggests demons—how could the hair-thieves fail to think of this point?"

Manager Hu nodded in agreement, then added: "Han Qiaojie's side doesn't worry me; presumably they have nothing important to reveal..."

The Daoist slowly shook his head but didn't elaborate. He was the Daoist Wood-Stone that Han Qiaojie had mentioned. Though his face appeared old and haggard, he was actually still in his prime. This was partly the trace of years spent wandering, sleeping in the wind and eating dew, toiling endlessly on the road—and partly deliberate.

Though he presented himself as a wandering Daoist, he had originally served in the Jinyiwei—the Imperial Guard. Using geomancy, ghost-catching, exorcism, and medical treatment as cover, he had traveled deep into various regions to investigate public sentiment and monitor officials. After the Chongzhen Emperor ascended the throne and abolished the Jinyiwei's practice of monitoring officials, he lost his position. He had then been recruited by the court boss "Stone Old Man"—Shi Weng—to work for him.

Since the hair-thieves arrived in Qiongzhou eight years ago, he had been running about on his master's behalf concerning this matter. Yet several plots had failed at the last moment. This time he came to Guangzhou not merely to use sorcery against the hair-thieves, but also to shoulder an important mission from his master.

"Not to be paranoid, but I fear the hair-thieves have already spread a dragnet around Music Workshop Street, waiting for us to stumble in." Daoist Wood-Stone spoke slowly. "Looking for a child through Fangchun Court was truly a major miscalculation!" He sighed with regret.

Because scrutiny outside had become so intense, the Guan Di Temple group dared not involve themselves in child trafficking anymore. Human traffickers also didn't dare buy and sell children of unknown origin at will. For a time, they couldn't find a suitable one—which was why the idea arose of looking for a suitable candidate among the *pipazai* through Yue Wan's connections.

In truth, Mingnu's horoscope was barely acceptable—merely the closest match among the girls they could lay hands on. Wuzhiqi had warned several times that the days available for performing the magic were slipping away. If a suitable child wasn't found, the formation would be completely ruined. Only then had Daoist Wood-Stone thought of using the *pipazai*. Many of them had been abducted by "flower-patters"—kidnappers—their origins unknown. No one would care if they disappeared. And because this Mingnu had been bought secretly, without even registering for a temporary residence permit at the police station, she was even "cleaner."

Yet he never anticipated that the hair-thief police would be so thorough, turning Guangzhou city upside down to search for one little girl—finally not hesitating to force their way into a gentry's outer residence! Neither Daoist Wood-Stone nor anyone else involved had expected this. Thinking of it now, Daoist Wood-Stone couldn't help but feel secretly vexed.

Originally, he had kept a low profile, sitting firmly on his fishing boat. But through this incident, he was considered "exposed" to the hair-thieves. Not only that—the Liang family had also been implicated.

Following past experience, slipping away was the best choice once exposed. But this time that wouldn't work. None of the missions he shouldered had been completed. He had spent large sums of money only to lose many lives—though those caught were hired help, if the hair-thieves opened a breach through them and used the opportunity to raise a massive case... Setting aside others, once the Liang family was implicated, with their extensive connections to relatives, *tongnian* graduates, teachers, and friends in the capital, should they send word to assign blame, Stone Old Man's days would become very difficult indeed!

He pondered for a moment and spoke slowly: "The items at Yue Wan's place must be destroyed as soon as possible—don't transfer them elsewhere anymore. If caught with them, it will be irrefutable evidence! Moreover, the hair-thieves don't care about gentry dignity; it's hard to guarantee they won't search again!"

Manager Hu said: "This lowly one understands."

"As for Miss Yue Wan herself, there's no need to worry too much. The hair-thieves won't punish her right away," Daoist Wood-Stone continued. "The hair-thieves still cherish the favor owed from your master's help back then. And their foothold in Guangdong isn't stable yet; without sufficient cause, they won't touch the Tai Sui's head. It's only that the hair-thieves are violent and unpredictable by nature—simply avoid touching their reverse scales over trivial matters. Today is not like the past."

Manager Hu said: "What the Daoist says is true."

Daoist Wood-Stone sighed. "You and I have been acquainted for many years. There is something I must say—not suitable for outside ears."

Manager Hu said: "Old Immortal speaks gravely. Please speak."

Daoist Wood-Stone spoke slowly: "I had thought Wuzhiqi's magical power was immense—that he could definitely stir great waves in this city. Unexpectedly, his Daoist arts were broken. Perhaps... the Great Ming's fortune is truly exhausted..."

Manager Hu's face showed fear. The court's luck was low, the Emperor Star dim—Daoist Wood-Stone had mentioned this several times on previous visits to Guangzhou. This time they had prepared such an elaborate magic formation, yet in the end it was a total defeat. Could it be that the Mandate of Heaven truly rested with the hair-thieves?

Thinking how, in the first month of this year, the bandit rebels had broken Fengyang and burned the imperial mausoleum... the Great Ming's fortunes were truly dire to the extreme. Could it be that these hair-thieves were also born in response to calamity, and the Great Ming was really going to perish?

The thought sent a chill down his spine.

The Daoist continued: "I will abandon this place soon. You must never come here again. When I find a new location, I will contact you."

"Yes. Then I shall quietly await the Daoist's word."

"Please tell your master to retract his claws and teeth temporarily and hibernate. As long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of running out of firewood. Though Governor Xiong has retreated into Guangxi, the Emperor has not blamed him. Currently, various Wolf Troops and *Tusi* in Guangxi are being transferred to assist in the campaign. I hear the White Rod Army will also be summoned."

"So the Court has a plan to recover Guangzhou?" Manager Hu's face lit with excitement.

"Exactly."

After Manager Hu departed, Daoist Wood-Stone summoned his young apprentice and whispered a few instructions.

"Go contact Master Mo. Tell him to pass a message to Gao Tianshi: The offering is gone. No matter what means he uses, he must obtain another offering quickly."

Daoist Wood-Stone vaguely felt in his heart that perhaps he should simply kill this demon Daoist now, then quit this place of trouble—Guangzhou. But he couldn't fail to give his master an explanation. Whether this Daoist Wu's magic worked or not, like a drowning man, there must be a straw to grasp.

He silently poured out the tea remaining in Manager Hu's cup and washed the teacup clean. He had already placed poison in the tea—a poison obtained from the Eastern Depot. According to dosage, it was divided into one-day onset, two-day onset, three-day onset, up to a maximum of seven-day onset. In the past, the Eastern Depot had often used this to secretly execute anyone the Emperor and the Depot found "annoying." Manager Hu wouldn't survive past tomorrow night after returning—even if a doctor was called, he would probably only be diagnosed with an attack of *jiaochangsha*—colic.

Liang Cunhou couldn't do this, but he could.

Speaking of poisoning Manager Hu, he actually felt a trace of sorrow. Manager Hu had been a *fanzi*—an agent—under his command in earlier years. Ordered to come to Guangzhou during the Tianqi era to monitor Liang Cunhou's grandfather, the former Zhejiang Right Administration Commissioner Liang Younian, he had been a servant in the Liang Residence for more than ten years now. He was a capable officer under him. However, they had met and contacted too many times; he knew too much and had become too prominent a target. Once arrested, he would inevitably implicate the Liang family. The consequences would be unimaginable. It was better to remove him quickly and cleanly.

Fortunately, besides this Daoist magic, he still had a backup plan. He only hoped there would be enough time. *If only the Great Ming also possessed the "telegraph" that could transmit news instantly like the hair-thieves*, Daoist Wood-Stone couldn't help thinking.
