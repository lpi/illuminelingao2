## Chapter 1917 - Civil Service Examination (Part Ten)

Now that the examination was over, all that remained was to await fate's verdict. Yuan Shuzhi knew that since ancient times, fine essays had been at odds with fortune—no matter how learned one might be or how brilliant one's writing, in the end, nothing could overcome the word "luck."

The Ming dynasty's civil service examination pass rate was appallingly low. While becoming a *xiucai* was not too difficult, the pass rate for the provincial examination—that crucial stepping stone into the gentry class—was less than four percent. From the first year of Longqing (1567) to the end of the Ming dynasty, the pass rate for provincial examinations in the twelve provinces including Fujian and Guangdong was merely 3.1 percent.

This pass rate only represented those who actually participated in the examination. In reality, because each province had far too many students, one had to first pass selective screening examinations to even qualify for the provincial examination. Some prestigious academies controlled a considerable number of provincial examination slots, further compressing ordinary students' chances of participation. The intensity of competition made achieving degrees like *juren* or *jinshi* something most scholars could only dream of but never attain. Aside from attributing success or failure to "fate," there was nothing else to be done.

Zeng Juan's parents, along with his niece, waited outside the Tribute Courtyard. The child was small and they dared not venture into the crowds, so they waited at a distance. When Mingnu spotted them emerging, she bounded over to greet them. The whole family surrounded them, showering them with solicitous attention. Yuan Shuzhi also basked in Zeng Juan's reflected warmth, filled with deep emotion—it had been far too long since he had enjoyed such tenderness.

Returning to the Zeng household, the kitchen already had a pot of sand clams simmering. They had bought them the previous day from Tanka fishing folk and kept them alive until they had expelled all the sand, then stewed them in a copper pot. The whole family gathered around the stove to eat. The milky-white broth was fragrant and delicious. Zeng Juan's mother had also prepared many small side dishes. Agui came to the feast as well, bringing two bottles of Lingao-produced "fruit wine." Glass-bottled with a pale yellow liquid, it looked utterly "premium." Supposedly this fruit wine was made from jackfruit, then infused with various fruits and herbs. The wine was a reward he had received after the public trial of the Maojia Inn case.

"...Even the Elders love to drink it!" Agui gestured animatedly.

"Since even the Elders love it, let us also taste this Australian flavor." Father Zeng's spirits soared—he had never been so happy.

Opening the bottle, the fruity fragrance immediately filled the air. Yuan Shuzhi and old man Zeng were both old drinkers who had never smelled such fragrant wine. Their mouths immediately watered. So everyone except Mingnu served themselves some; Mingnu naturally drank her favorite kombucha. The family gathered around the table, cups raised in joyful celebration.

Everyone picked out the clam meat and dipped it in sauce, savoring it heartily. There was no technique to this style of eating—it all depended on the freshness of the ingredients themselves. At this moment, Yuan Shuzhi, slightly tipsy, watched everyone sweating profusely as they concentrated on eating, and suddenly thought of his own father and mother, dead for many years. This feeling he had not experienced for far too long—a wave of sorrow gripped his heart. He forced himself to hold back the emotion. Just then, Father Zeng handed him a wine cup, saying: "Old brother, let's have a drink. This fine wine—old brother, truly thank you. Without you, Zeng Juan might not have studied so diligently."

"Not at all—young Zeng Juan is clever and quick-witted. I should be the one thanking him." He drained his cup in one gulp.

After finishing the clam meat, the clam broth at the bottom was the essence. Mother Zeng dropped in a handful of noodles to make clam noodle soup. Everyone had a small bowl, ending the meal in satisfaction.

That night, Yuan Shuzhi slept without a single dream. He felt he had found a long-lost sensation—the feeling of "home."

The days of waiting were always especially hard to endure. While waiting for the results to be posted, Yuan Shuzhi dreamed more than once that he had failed, returning to the ruined temple to scrape by through petty theft. Now he had awakened, feeling ashamed of his past behavior. Yet having read some Australian books, he also understood that his past miserable circumstances were not of his own making—they were caused by the detestable Pseudo-Ming. Every time he thought of this, his hatred for the Pseudo-Ming's Zhu family deepened a little more.

Before the results were posted, Yuan Shuzhi did not go out. Every day he stayed at the Zeng household reading leisurely Australian books to pass the time. This was also part of his preparation, for if the "written examination" passed, there would be an "interview" stage. According to the study guides, the interview had no specified examination scope—it mainly assessed the candidate's experience, interpersonal skills, and ability to respond to situations.

To test these qualities, having rich life experience was one aspect, and having considerable reading was another. Particularly since the Australians were newcomers, candidates had not yet figured out which tradition their examinations followed, but reading more "Australian books" would surely please the examiners.

Yuan Shuzhi was extremely fond of various Australian novels. Unlike younger people like Zeng Juan, Yuan Shuzhi was not particularly enamored with *The Legend of the Condor Heroes*. What captivated him completely was another Australian novel called *Dream of the Red Chamber*, also known as *The Story of the Stone*.

This book had only recently come to market, yet it had already taken all of Guangzhou by storm. From gentry households to common folk, anyone with literate womenfolk in the family tried every possible means to obtain and read it.

Truly, this was a marvelous book, recounting the rise and fall of the four great families—Jia, Shi, Wang, and Xue—while using the inner-chamber sentiments of Jia Baoyu, Lin Daiyu, Xue Baochai, and others to tell countless stories of the human world. This Cao Xueqin was said to have had ancestors who were high officials in the Great Song, but after the Yashan disaster, they drifted to Australia. The latter half of his life was extremely impoverished, and owing to his rich experiences, he wrote this masterpiece. However, many of the allusions and writings within were clearly not from the Song dynasty—nor from the Great Ming—and the text used place names like "Jiangning" and such, truly befitting "false village talk." Presumably the author had some scruples and dared not speak of current affairs, using false village talk as a cover.

Rumors in the marketplace also had it that this Cao Xueqin was actually a pseudonym of Literary Chairman Wen. This Literary Chairman Wen and others were all descendants of Australian officials who, having lost a political struggle, had no choice but to cross the sea on a raft. Thus, during the voyage back to the old country, Literary Chairman Wen wrote this timeless masterpiece. Of course, this was all speculation and should not be taken as truth.

Yuan Shuzhi was utterly obsessed with *Dream of the Red Chamber*. He had nearly worn the book to tatters from reading. Whenever he read the author's self-describing poem—"Pages full of preposterous words, a handful of bitter tears! All say the author is mad; who understands the taste within?"—his eyes would inevitably well with tears. As for passages like "Like birds when food is gone, scattering to the woods, leaving only a vast white expanse of clean earth"—by then he would already have soaked his lapels with tears. Whenever this happened, if Mingnu was nearby, she would always ask: "Grandpa, why are you crying?"

Yuan Shuzhi would quickly wipe his tears and say with a smile to Mingnu: "Mingnu dear, Grandpa isn't crying—it's just that this book has a sour taste that stings my eyes."

"Grandpa's fibbing! How can books have taste?!"

"Mingnu is still young and doesn't understand. When you grow up, you'll know. Ah, but sometimes Grandpa truly wishes you would never grow up, so you could be this happy every day. The world of adults, ah... Well, let's not talk about this. Shall Grandpa give you a horsey ride in the courtyard?"

"Yes! Yes! Horsey ride!" Mingnu and Yuan Shuzhi went to the courtyard, once again a picture of grandpaternal joy.

During this period, because Yuan Shuzhi had nothing to do except play with the child or read *Dream of the Red Chamber*, many years later this old Kong actually became one of the first scholars of Red Studies in the Australian Song. He worked diligently to prove that the author was actually Literary Chairman Wen, and that Lin Daiyu was the daughter of Obama, the Australian Grand Chancellor who had persecuted Chairman Wen and others—Ao Mixue...

Meanwhile at the Examination Academy, the grading work for the civil service examination was proceeding intensively. All the behavioral aptitude questions were graded by students from Fangcaodi School—they were comfortable with such things, and it was easy to catch errors.

To prevent grading mistakes, they specially employed a system of dedicated reviewers to reduce the error rate to the lowest possible level.

As for scoring the essay portion, because these were subjective questions, they were greatly influenced by the graders' personal biases. Particularly since the graders included both naturalized citizen cadres who came from Fangcaodi and cadres who had defected from the old literati ranks. The two sides had vastly different experiences, worldviews, and aesthetic sensibilities.

To prevent either side from deliberately rejecting candidates from the opposing camp or favoring those from their own, Zhang Yunmi employed cross-grading. The same paper would be graded once by a naturalized citizen cadre and once by a defected old literati cadre. If the two scores differed too greatly, she as chief examiner would personally grade it. At this moment, one particular paper had sparked intense controversy between the two camps of examiners.

This paper was first reviewed by a naturalized citizen cadre who had originally been a failed scholar. One look at the mixed classical and vernacular writing angered him—what was this nonsense?! Displeased, he thought: "This kind of writing—what is it even saying! Half-classical, half-vernacular, the literary logic doesn't flow. Truly dogshit writing!" He gave it a score of 30.

Then when the naturalized citizen cadre reviewed it, he slapped the table in approval. Such an excellent paper, yet those pedants had given it only 30 points—truly a disgrace to scholarship! No, he couldn't let such great talent go undiscovered. Since he now ate Song grain, he should do his part in selecting talent for Song. This paper deserved at least 70 points.

Such a discrepant pair of scores emerged. The paper was then sent to both sides who began to quarrel. The naturalized citizens cursed the others as pedantic ninnies who thought knowing a few chicken-squawking phrases made them special, while suppressing the masses. The old literati cursed them as crude boors who couldn't even write the four variations of the character for "chicken," yet dared to pontificate! Giving 70 points to such dogshit writing—truly a case of crude fellows sticking together and covering for each other. Thus the dispute was brought before Zhang Yunmi.

Zhang Yunmi examined the paper. The classical language was not profound, and as for elegance—that was out of the question. Judging by the language education she had received, the phrasing and sentence construction were indeed clumsy. In all likelihood, this was the work of an unsuccessful *tongsheng*. However, the writing was fairly accessible. As for the content and viewpoints, the insights were quite outstanding among old literati, especially lines like "Beneath the Sacred Ships there are no private factions"—such flattery was extremely well-executed.

After careful consideration, Zhang Yunmi settled the paper at 60 points. To help everyone understand her reasoning, she offered an explanation:

First, the essay's thesis was "correct." Though the essay's prose level was not high, the viewpoints were accurate, the logic was clear, and it conformed to the Senate's consistent political positions. Politically, it passed.
