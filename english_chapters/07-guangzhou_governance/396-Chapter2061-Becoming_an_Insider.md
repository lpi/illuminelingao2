# Chapter 2061 - Becoming an Insider

How could one become an "insider"?

Going into business partnership was naturally best—but that depended on opportunity. Like the Zhang family that sold walnut pastries, for instance. Or having unique craftsmanship, like Chen Liji. Having money alone wasn't quite enough. Subscribing to Executive Committee enterprise shares? Setting aside that such opportunities didn't come often, even when they did, with his "Song content," he wouldn't get a turn—the nouveau riche group led by Gao Ju had long since divided up the stock subscriptions among themselves.

Besides, even purchasing Executive Committee stock didn't make one an "insider." To the Executive Committee, having money just made you a good customer, a good taxpayer. They'd generously pay dividends, but wouldn't treat you as "one of their own." Moreover, though the He household was comfortable, they were far from "wealthy." Though they had a hundred mu of tenant-farmed land in the countryside and a few rental properties in the city, in a place like Guangzhou where major households were as common as fur, he counted as insignificant. Without the twin halos of juren status and the Shawan He clan, he probably wouldn't even make the list.

To become an "insider," one had to enter the Executive Committee's inner circle.

In the Ming, even a commoner could, as long as he passed the imperial examinations, achieve "a farmer at dawn, in the emperor's hall by dusk." With a shengyuan degree, one gained status in the local area—even officials and clerks had to show courtesy. With a juren degree, one entered the gentry class—one was "in the circle."

But this Great Song Executive Committee had appeared from who knows where. Obviously, the "civil service examination" held in Guangzhou didn't count as imperial examinations—at least it was several levels below the Ming's system.

This difference in levels wasn't simply the gap between "official" and "clerk," but a difference in the examination level itself:

The Guangzhou civil service examination wasn't conducted by the "Executive Committee" but by the "Guangzhou Municipal Government." The presiding official Liu Xiang, though an Elder, held only the position of Guangzhou Prefect. The successful candidates were all assigned local Guangzhou cadre positions. Clearly, this civil service examination was "local."

By comparison, those truly trusted by the Elders were almost without exception cadres from Fangcaodi. Though young and mostly not high-ranking, their status among naturalized citizens was beyond question.

He Wei had gathered plenty of intelligence in Lingao, especially about Fangcaodi—he'd long heard of this school's famous name. Nearly all the young cadres in positions of authority came from here. Genuine "Son of Heaven's disciples."

With Squire He's intelligence, he naturally understood this was the Australians' "Imperial Academy"—actually, speaking of it, even more prestigious than the Imperial Academy. After all, the late Ming Imperial Academy's aura had dimmed considerably, with too many who'd bought their way in or entered through donations.

Once enrolled in Fangcaodi, one became a "student of the Executive Committee"—He Wei had seen this phrase repeatedly in newspapers. Obviously, the fastest way currently to become one of the Executive Committee's own was to study at Fangcaodi.

After much deliberation, He Wei made his decision: send his children to study at Fangcaodi!

Fortunately, Fangcaodi was "open enrollment"—as long as one was willing to pay tuition and living expenses and had an acceptable family background, all were admitted.

Though the Executive Committee harbored inherent distrust of old-style scholars, they didn't reject accepting their children for education—reforming the old ones might be impossible, but reforming the young ones was still very achievable.

So He Wei's tentative inquiry received an immediate response. Zheng Shangjie indicated that children of Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce members would definitely receive "priority admission."

Having received confirmation, He Wei began considering at home which of his children to send.

Speaking of children, though he had neither three wives nor four concubines, he did have one wife and one concubine, plus two chamber maids who had borne him children. In total, there were seven surviving legitimate and illegitimate children, all minors.

According to the Australians, age six or seven was best for enrollment. But enrolling at that age without servants to attend to them made He Wei uneasy. After much thought, he decided to send his legitimate third son who had just turned nine and his illegitimate twelve-year-old second daughter to Fangcaodi to study.

Compared to other major households who sent distant relatives' children or at most illegitimate offspring to Australian schools, Squire He's move was earth-shattering in Guangzhou. It also deeply pleased Director Zheng. Especially when he visited Director Zheng's office and happened to find a Director Du from Lingao also present—after hearing Director Zheng's introduction of his children's enrollment situation, this Director Du was so delighted she praised him as "an enlightened and progressive father."

Squire He genuinely didn't understand what was "enlightened" about sending a girl to school, much less where the "progress" lay. His reason for sending his second daughter was partly so she could look after her younger brother, and partly because he'd heard the Australians had an almost obsessive fixation on female education, verging on "demonic possession." Whenever they heard parents were willing to let daughters study, they invariably praised them—this was his way of currying favor.

Hearing Director Du's words, it was exactly as expected! Though He Wei didn't quite understand the reasoning, as long as the Australians were happy!

Returning home, he ordered the servants to pack and prepare to send the children to school.

But the second concubine, upon hearing that not only would her daughter not have bound feet but would wear "uniforms" exposing her arms and calves while sitting in the same room with a bunch of men, came crying to him for a good half month, saying this would ruin her daughter's reputation and make her unmarriageable. Most tiresome.

Yet from then on, Director Zheng's words became much warmer. She even "reminded" him, helping him dodge the "Stamp Tax Case" disaster. Squire He returned the favor—not only reorganizing his city properties into "companies" as the Australians required, but also incorporating his tenant-farmed countryside land into a company to establish a farm managed by the Tiandihui—less worry and less effort.

Of course, Squire He's true thoughts weren't really about this. Everything above was merely seeking to preserve himself and continue the family line. As a gentry lineage, he deeply understood the importance of power. No matter whether the reigning emperor was surnamed Zhu or Zhao, without someone in the court, no matter how large the family fortune, one was just a fat pig—or worse, wouldn't even get the chance to grow fat. Since the Australians were unwilling to "share governance with scholar-officials" and only trusted the "Son of Heaven's disciples" they'd trained themselves, wasn't sending offspring to Australian schools to study Australian learning and become Australian "cadres" the logical course? This would become the He family's backing in the new dynasty.

Today was Monday. After work, Zeng Juan took his team member Mei Fazhi as usual to collect last week's taxpayer declaration and payment ledger copies from the tax service hall. The collection period was nearing its end, so the hall was relatively quiet. The group of young women were just lamenting the lack of topics when along came the now city-famous hero of the "Stamp Tax Case"—naturally they had to crowd around and tease him a bit.

"Not at all, not at all. This was all thanks to the excellent guidance from the leaders and everyone's support for the task force. I merely followed orders. It's nothing worth mentioning."

"Team Leader Zeng is definitely educated—even his polite deflections sound so literary..."

"Team Leader Zeng, I heard the first tip about the Luo family came from our Sister Nan. Don't you think you should thank Sister Nan?"

"Yes, yes, of course." Zeng Juan reflexively started to cup his hands in a formal bow before realizing it wasn't appropriate, so he followed the Lingao naturalized citizens' style, slightly bowing toward Nan Wan'er with a nod. "Director Nan, if you hadn't brought the Luo family's stamp tax to my attention, none of what followed would have happened..."

"Team Leader Zeng, you're too kind. Just doing my job..." Nan Wan'er responded coolly.

"Sister Nan... I think you're even more polite than Team Leader Zeng." Liu Cuihua knelt on a stool and wrapped her arms around Nan Wan'er's neck from behind, making a face at Zeng Juan. "Team Leader Zeng, the leaders are about to commend you. Such a great honor—the first ever for our Tax Bureau. I say you really ought to treat Sister Nan to a nice dinner to make it right. There's no class tonight, you know~"

"Cuihua, stop it. Get down." Nan Wan'er pried off Liu Cuihua's arms. "Team Leader Zeng, don't listen to her. She's just a child at heart..."

"..."

"A Juan," team member Mei Fazhi whispered in Zeng Juan's ear. "I also think Director Nan helped you quite a bit. Not showing your appreciation wouldn't be right."

After a moment's thought, Zeng Juan agreed that Mei Fazhi was right—a flimsy thank-you really was inadequate. He promptly expressed his intention to treat Nan Wan'er to dinner as thanks. Nan Wan'er, seeing she couldn't refuse, scanned the girls around her: "Team Leader Zeng is treating—who's coming?"

"Sister Nan, he's inviting *you*. Why are you calling us? Am I right?"

"Though Australian light bulbs are bright, you can't just light them anywhere, anytime."

"Hahahaha." The room erupted in laughter, leaving Nan Wan'er's face flushed red.

"Team Leader Zeng, I appreciate the thought, but I'd better not go..."

"Oh come on, Sister Nan—I'll come with you. Team Leader Zeng doesn't mind one more freeloader, right?" Just as Nan Wan'er was about to decline, Liu Cuihua suddenly jumped in again.

"..." Nan Wan'er thought to herself: you little glutton! But this gave Zeng Juan an opening to continue:

"That would be even better. Director Nan, if there's nothing special tonight, it's settled then."

The sun was still far from setting when Zeng Juan arrived early at the restaurant. Though he'd never been here, if it met Zhang Yu's standards, it couldn't be too bad. This restaurant was originally the largest in the Lin family's portfolio: "Zhanxiang Lou." Built alongside the water, with carved beams and painted rafters, part of it even jutted out over the water like a pavilion. On autumn days, drinking wine in the breeze with water flowing beneath one's feet felt almost divine.

After Lin Zunxiu and his father were hanged, it was taken over by Ziming Tower. Not only was the literary name "Zhanxiang Lou" changed to the much more down-to-earth "Mixiang Ju" (Rice Fragrance House), but prices dropped by more than half—at least enough that someone like Zeng Juan who drew a government salary could, with some teeth-gritting, set a decent table. Besides, Ziming Tower's reputation was such that for people with official positions like them, it really was somewhat inappropriate. This "Rice Fragrance House," on the other hand—if Zeng Juan hadn't been at the Tax Bureau and known some inside information, he would have assumed like everyone else that it was a government property of the Guangzhou administration. This made it much more appropriate for entertaining guests.
