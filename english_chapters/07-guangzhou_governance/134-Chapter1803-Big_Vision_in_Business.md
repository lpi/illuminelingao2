# Chapter 1803 - Big Vision in Business

Gao Ju knew this meant he had to go "enter the ring" with the Australians to negotiate conditions. He cursed inwardly that they certainly found it easy to just flap their lips. Speaking of the merchants' worries, he had them too—no one was born with high awareness, willing to take out gleaming white silver to exchange for paper money.

However, Gao Ju was very clear that the Senate's determination for this currency reform was extremely great. From several conversations with Liu Xiang and Zheng Shangjie, he knew there was no room for maneuver in this matter. If the Money Industry Guild wanted to execute it at a discount, the Australians would absolutely not accept it.

Gao Ju wasn't clear why the Senate wanted to implement new currency reform. In the past, when the Australians implemented circulation notes on Hainan Island, he estimated it was because the Australians lacked silver, and Guangdong was a place lacking copper coins, so they had to use this method to compensate. But now their situation was entirely different from before. Not to mention anything else, just the fact that the Senate had defeated Zheng Zhilong, forced Liu Xiang to surrender, and exterminated or subdued various pirate leaders in Fujian and Guangdong meant that most of the Eastern and Western Ocean business was now in their hands. The merchants in Guangzhou city estimated that this item alone brought in three or four million taels of silver annually. Logically speaking, they shouldn't lack silver at all.

Speaking of the Australians' own expenses, they were frugal to an absurd degree. Even those most fiercely opposed to the "short-hairs" had to admit that the Australians "lived in humble palaces and ate poor food." Except for their fondness for female sex, there was nothing to criticize in their lifestyle enjoyments.

After thinking it over, Gao Ju couldn't figure out what the Australians needed to spend vast amounts of silver on to come up with this trick of silver dollar circulation notes.

Using silver dollars was naturally very good, but using precious notes, this was a bit ominous. Gao Ju was a merchant and knew that every time the imperial court made a move in the economy, it would inevitably attract speculators like flies to a stench, manipulating things to make a fortune. The resulting fluctuations...

He understood Guangzhou too well. Although the merchants sitting in this meeting were the top big merchants in the business world, the wealth they could mobilize was probably not even one-tenth of the silver in this city. In the dark masses of thousands of citizens' homes, inside the caves of rockeries, in the stone chambers of houses, under the stone slabs of courtyards, in the chests of bedrooms and studies, a massive amount of wealth slumbered—if this silver were utilized by someone, it would instantly become a destructive force. Don't look at the Australians' strong ships and sharp cannons; if they lost the battle in the economy, they equally couldn't stand firm in Guangzhou.

Thinking of this, Gao Ju couldn't help but feel vaguely worried for the Australians.

Worries aside, the work Zheng Shangjie arranged still had to be done. Once the new currency was issued, it had to circulate in the market without hindrance.

He deliberated again and again, then said, "Gao has understood everyone's meaning. However, the Senate views the issuance of new currency extremely heavily. At the meeting of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that day, those present to cheer were all there; was there any room for feelings? I see very little room for maneuver."

"Doesn't this rely on Master Gao coming forward? You are an old acquaintance of the Australians," Boss Zhu said. "Even if there are some expenses, everyone is willing to contribute; we definitely won't let Master Gao suffer a loss."

The words were spoken with strange intonations. Gao Ju had excellent self-control and just smiled slightly: "The Senate acts differently from the Fake Ming; they have always been open and aboveboard. Such methods cannot be used."

Because this matter had a huge relationship with the money industry, seeing that Gao Ju was unwilling to take the lead, Liang Chenlong asked again, "Is there really no room at all in this matter?"

Gao Ju said, "Although Gao is an outsider, I have settled in this Five Rams City of Guangzhou Prefecture for over thirty years. My whole family and fortune are here. The safety of Guangzhou and the quality of the market are all closely related to Gao."

He first stated his position, indicating he would absolutely not do anything to "sell out everyone's interests to curry favor with the Australians." Of course, this couldn't be said explicitly, just touched upon. Naturally, everyone might not believe it, but that didn't matter. With an attitude present, the words he spoke would be more persuasive.

"...It's just that the Senate views this matter as a top priority. I heard they have already sent a Minister of Finance to Guangzhou to supervise this matter. Even Chiefs Wen and Liu may not be able to interject in this matter."

Once these words were said, they looked at each other in dismay. Typical disappointment appeared on the faces of the seated merchants. Everyone knew that Gao Ju's biggest backer was "Minister Wen." If even Chief Wen couldn't speak on it, didn't that mean none of them stood a chance? regardless of whether this was true or false, Gao Ju's unwillingness to take the lead was enough to explain the Australians' determination in this matter.

"I wonder if they will issue many of these circulation notes? It is said that 'those willing to exchange circulation notes for silver money will be treated the same as silver dollars,' but if there are too many notes and insufficient ready silver, then..." Liang Chenlong shook his head and didn't continue.

This worry was shared by everyone. Now that he explicitly stated it, the worries and dissatisfaction of each family surged out like water from a broken dike, and the hall of Jufeng Bank became noisy for a while.

Boss Zhu said sarcastically again, "I see, in the future, these circulation notes will definitely be worthless."

Gao Ju felt his words were a bit too arbitrary. Credit had to be maintained by everyone. If these silver dollar circulation notes were not indiscriminately issued, the regulations were set perfectly, and there was no inconvenience in market use, plus the support of all trades and industries, the circulation notes should be able to maintain a stable value. Otherwise, the abuses would be unimaginable. If the market was messed up, even if someone could pull chestnuts from the fire to make a fortune, the majority would suffer.

If it were the Great Ming issuing circulation notes today instead of the Australians, then he, Gao Ju, would definitely avoid them like the plague, and even use all resources to sabotage it, because the Ming court had given merchants enough lessons on treasure notes and many other things: the government's words couldn't be trusted. But the Australians were different. Circulation notes had been used in Hainan for many years without anything inappropriate; the Australians also had a good reputation for always keeping promises. Gao Ju still trusted them.

He remained silent at this moment, waiting for the turbulent discussion to ease a bit. Only after each family had expressed their opinions but reached no conclusion did he speak:

"Gao has a view, stated for your consideration," he said. "These Australian new circulation notes have just been issued. Although we don't know if they are good or bad yet, we must always think towards the good, not the bad. Banknotes being issued naturally means everyone has to use them, but the ones with the closest stakes are us merchants. If the circulation notes have bad credit, the first ones to be unlucky are us merchants. So we have to help the circulation notes build credit. If the circulation notes stand firm, our business will be easy to do. Otherwise, if the market is chaotic and prices change three times a day, how can everyone still do business?"

Note compared to the "seeking advantages and avoiding disadvantages" rhetoric filling the hall just now, this gave people a refreshing feeling, and everyone immediately quieted down.

"Oho!" Boss Mi said. "I didn't see that Master Gao could speak such grand principles!"

Gao Ju ignored his vague sarcasm and said, "Everyone, please think. These circulation notes have been used in Qiongzhou Prefecture for four or five years, and we haven't heard of anything inappropriate. The Australians have always been the most trustworthy. They would absolutely not be so short-sighted as to kill the hen to get the eggs."

These words were well-founded, and everyone couldn't refute them—many present had been to Hainan or even Lingao; facts spoke louder than eloquence.

Gao Ju continued, "How shrewd one is in business, calculating income and expenses on a thirteen-column abacus without missing a bit, that is small cleverness. What's important is vision. The bigger the business, the farther the vision must be. Everyone here does big business; your vision must look at the big picture."

As he spoke, he lit a cigar for himself and slowly blew out smoke rings: "Nowadays, the Ming Kingdom has internal troubles and external aggression, swaying in the midst of a storm. The Qin has lost its deer, and the heroes of the world chase it together. Gentlemen, please think, among these heroes of the world, who has the strongest power? Who has the greatest ability?"

The Great Ming was about to fall, and the Senate wanted to contend for the world; this was something everyone knew. But no one had said it so clearly yet. Everyone shivered upon hearing this, feeling a sense of sudden realization.

"...Our purpose in doing business is to help the Senate win the war!"

"Master Gao," a merchant frowned slightly, his voice mumbling, "I still don't quite understand your words."

"Then I'll explain it more clearly." Gao Ju replied, "As long as it's a business that can help the Senate win battles, I'll do it, even if I lose money. This isn't losing money; it's putting down capital. When the Senate wins the war and times are peaceful, what business won't be good to do? By that time, you will have contributed, and the Senate will naturally repay you, making business convenient everywhere. Think about it, is there any business more profitable than this?"

"These words are true," said Shopkeeper Ding of the grain bank. "Even if they don't give us any benefits, as long as the roads are calm and the people are harmonious, this business can be done."

Seeing someone agree, Gao Ju struck while the iron was hot, "Not speaking of future matters, just speaking of the present: ever since the Senate purged the pirates off the coast of Fujian and Guangdong, now sugar, tea, porcelain, and various mountain goods from Fujian don't need to detour through Jiangxi and go down the Five Ridges. They come directly to Guangdong by sea, and the price has dropped by more than half—everyone think, is this the logic?"

Although these words did not completely convince the merchants, there was at least not as strong a resistance as before. With Gao Ju using both soft and hard tactics, the heads of various trade guilds finally agreed to cooperate with the new currency issuance and fully use silver dollars and paper notes.

Liang Chenlong returned home in a sedan chair. Although Gao Ju had said those words, he was still uneasy. Liang Chenlong's Maokang Money Shop was only a small peer in the money industry, small in scale, but he was a clansman of the Liang family. Relying on this relationship, he often handled some unspeakable silver and money transactions for the gentry. Therefore, he had deep relationships among the gentry and became the head of the Silver and Money Industry Guild.

The Australians entering Guangzhou hit Maokang's business the hardest. Because his family had close business dealings with the silver and money industries in both the Northern and Southern Capitals. With Guangzhou changing flags, the gentry in the city either fled or went into hiding, and communication between north and south was cut off. Maokang's remittance and lending businesses with the two capitals were almost completely interrupted. Currently, they were just doing some local business to maintain themselves.

He arrived at his outer study where he worked and lived, hurriedly wiped his face, and without even having time to drink the tea served by the maid, he spread out paper, ground ink, and started writing a letter.
