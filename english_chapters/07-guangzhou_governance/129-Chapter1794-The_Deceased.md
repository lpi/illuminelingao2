# Chapter 1794 - The Deceased

Such transactions naturally had records. The shopkeeper took out the ledger and checked: the person who bought the shoes was someone called Shi Tidi.

Li Ziyu didn't know who Shi Tidi was, but the criminal police in the police bureau all knew. This managing *shiye* (private advisor) of Wenlan Academy had already been arrested because he was involved in acting as a middleman to hire thugs to attack the Chaoshan Guild Hall, and was now detained in the prefectural yamen prison.
 
Wu Xiang immediately interrogated Shi Tidi. Hearing that it was about buying shoes from Changyu, Shi Tidi was quite straightforward and immediately admitted he handled it.

It turned out this batch of shoes was purchased by him for the students of Wenlan Academy. As the largest and wealthiest academy in Guangzhou, every year there was so-called "clothing and shoe money"—everyone could get a bolt of cotton cloth and two pairs of shoes. As the *shiye* actually in charge of specific affairs at Wenlan Academy, it was completely normal for Shi Tidi to profit from this.

So it was like this. Wu Xiang thought, since these shoes were bought by Wenlan Academy, the victim was very likely a student or related personnel of the academy.

"Have the shoes all been distributed?"

Shi Tidi said this was a matter of the end of last year, the shoes had long been distributed. There were still a dozen pairs left in the academy untouched.

Wu Xiang immediately ordered police officers to go to the academy to transfer the roster of shoe distribution on New Year's Eve last year and the remaining shoes. After comparison, the shoes were confirmed to be from the same batch of Changyu goods as the burnt shoes.

With the case developing to this point, Mu Min felt things might not be as simple as imagined. She ordered the establishment of a special task force, led by Wu Xiang, specifically responsible for this case. At the same time, Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui were also added to the task force.

The task force visited one by one, investigating the whereabouts of the shoes. Finally, screening confirmed that including students, teachers, and miscellaneous workers, a total of more than two hundred and forty people in Wenlan Academy received the shoes.

Most people still remembered these two pairs of shoes because the quality was really terrible. Whether wearing them themselves or giving them to others, basically none lasted more than three months before the soles either cracked or wore through holes. Everyone was quite calm about such inferior shoes—because the things distributed in the academy had always been this "black-hearted". Take the blue cloth bolts distributed together with these shoes, the weave was coarse and loose, and they couldn't withstand water; once in the water, they would rot terribly.

However, some people who received shoes were not in the academy. The police screened and found thirty-one people currently unaccounted for. Most of them had asked for leave from the academy. The reasons were varied, but Gao Chongjiu knew these people were mostly afraid of encountering some mishap staying in Guangzhou due to the Australians entering the city, so they simply went back to the countryside to avoid the limelight.

After a round of investigation, Gao Chongjiu reported that among the thirty-one people not in the academy, five lived locally, neither coming to school nor being at home, whereabouts unknown. He suggested listing these five people as key screening targets.

A, male surnamed He, from Nanhai County. Forty years old. An Added Student (*zengsheng*) of Nanhai County, studied in the academy for five years, always failing to pass the provincial exam. Married. Family circumstances relatively difficult. Relied on parents and parents-in-law for assistance. Said he went to drink tea and discuss matters with friends on a certain day at the end of last month, family members searched for many days without result, hasn't returned yet. This person studied hard usually, and didn't have extensive social connections.

B, male surnamed Cao, thirty-four years old. From Nanhai County, a Student of the Imperial College (*jiansheng*). Married. Studied in the academy for seven years, rarely went to the academy usually. Went out to drink tea on a certain day at the beginning of this month, hasn't returned yet.

C, male surnamed Xun, twenty-six years old, from Haikang County, an Added Student of Haikang County. Widowed, studied in the academy for two years. This person was said to be a *shiye* in a wealthy family, basically didn't come to the academy. The last time he appeared in the academy was during the New Year to distribute money and rice. Hasn't been seen coming to the academy since then.

D, male surnamed Wang, twenty-four years old. From Panyu County. A Child Student (*tongsheng*). Married. Studied in the academy for three years. Came to the academy often, didn't like studying. Shortly after the Senate entered the city, not only did he stop coming to the academy, but his whole family also vanished.

E, male surnamed Pu, twenty-one years old, from Guangzhou Rear Guard military household. Unmarried. Studied in the academy for three years. Studied relatively seriously. Disappeared shortly after the Senate entered the city, family didn't know his whereabouts.

However, none of these five missing persons matched the discovered headless corpse, because according to Liu San's identification, the deceased's age was roughly between fifty and fifty-five full years old. None of the five missing persons matched in age.

Because students might not necessarily wear the shoes themselves and might pass them on to relatives, friends, or servants, it seemed inappropriate to rule out the suspicion of these five people just like that.

The task force interrogated the family members and surrounding personnel of these five people, asking about the whereabouts of the shoes. Except for the male surnamed Wang whose whole family vanished and the male surnamed Xun whose employer was unknown, the family members of the others all recalled the whereabouts of these two pairs of shoes.

Thus, only two people's shoes remained unaccounted for. Wu Xiang on one hand ordered people to investigate the social background of the missing Xun Sansheng and Wang Dong at the academy, and on the other hand brought Shi Tidi out again. This person was an old hand at Wenlan Academy, extremely familiar with the academy's situation, maybe useful information could be learned from his mouth.

With forces divided into two groups, Li Zhenguo went to the academy to investigate and learned a situation: the head of the academy said Xun Sansheng was recommended for admission by a certain high threshold (influential family) in the city, claiming to be an Added Student of Haikang County, but no one had seen his student certificate from Haikang County School.

Because Wenlan Academy wasn't a government school, whether students were truly Licentiates (*shengyuan*) wasn't important. However, Wenlan Academy had always been famous for "literary examinations". Even for children of wealthy and noble families, if they really were lackluster and couldn't pass the exam for a Xiucai, they at least had to get a title of *Jiansheng* to enter for study. Someone coming like this with nothing was rarely seen in the academy.

"Although this Xun Sansheng enrolled, he never came to the school to study. But he never missed a trip to collect money, rice, and goods during the three festivals. Looking at his appearance and words, he isn't a seed for reading books either." The person in charge said.

"Do you know which family this high threshold recommending him for admission is, sir?"

"Speaking of this, the background is quite big." The head said, "It's Master Zhong Aijiao—one of the board directors of this academy."

This aroused Li Zhenguo's interest. Although Master Zhong could only be counted as the tail of the first class among Guangzhou's gentry, for him to inexplicably recommend a person of unknown origin into the academy, what was this Xun Sansheng's background?

The head said this Xun Sansheng was purely hanging a name in the academy. Usually, apart from coming to collect money, rice, and items from the academy during the three festivals, he didn't come to study. Although the person looked plain, there was nothing out of line about him.

As for this Wang Dong. The head shook his head, only saying he was a "loafing profligate son", "rotten wood that cannot be carved". The head didn't know much about him, saying he came to study purely to kill time, and his attendance at the academy was also at will. It was just that he often seduced ignorant and handsome students in the academy. Some coveted his money and enjoyment, letting him succeed with a few, and there were often jealous fights, making the academy foul and misty.

"Speaking of such a student, our academy absolutely cannot tolerate him. It was just that the managing Shi Shiye insisted on having him, which allowed him to run wild in the academy. Alas! Truly a disgrace to gentility!"

From the head's expression, hatred for Shi Tidi coercing the academy was overflowing in his words.

Li Zhenguo came out from the academy and rushed to the Zhong residence. Master Zhong said this Xun Sansheng was indeed recommended by him to the academy, actually he was a *shiye* of his family—recommended to the academy just to get a share of money and grain. Such things were tacitly understood among the board directors.

As for Xun Sansheng's whereabouts, Master Zhong said it was chaotic outside recently, people in the countryside estate were uneasy, so he sent Xun Shiye to the countryside a few days ago.

As for the shoes distributed by the academy, he naturally had no impression. But the shoes should be worn by Xun Shiye himself—"His wife died, no one makes shoes for him. Could he not wear ready-made shoes?"

On this side, Wu Xiang interrogating Shi Tidi also obtained important information. It turned out this Wang Dong had quite a background, being the young master of the "King of Drains" family.

It turned out this Wang Dong was the son of Wang Daniao, the labor foreman Liu Xiang wanted to find. Because his family had hereditary work of clearing silt and unblocking drains, mastering the "Drain Map" in their hands, they got the nickname "King of Drains".

Wang Daniao disappeared without a trace shortly after Liu Xiang entered the city. His son also evaporated from the world with him, leaving only female relatives and servants at home. Despite the Police Bureau drawing portraits and investigating openly and secretly inside and outside Guangzhou City, not a single hair was found.

Unexpectedly, this case would actually implicate Wang Daniao! Li Zhenguo came back, the two compared the situations, and felt the suspicion on Wang Dong's side was larger. Li Zhenguo then proposed a hypothesis: The deceased was Wang Daniao!

Whether judging from age or body shape, the deceased and Wang Daniao were very similar.

Wu Xiang, however, didn't dare to be too sure, because the data said Wang Daniao was just a hereditary foreman under the jurisdiction of the prefecture yamen's Works Workshop, specially in charge of clearing drains and digging silt—in the yamen runner system, his rank was the lowest. Being just a foreman, he also had to work hard. However, the deceased had a portly figure, undeveloped muscles, no calluses on limbs, and skin was also fine and white... looking like a wealthy landlord living comfortably no matter how one looked at it.

"Captain Wu, you don't know about this. This foreman's family is tight with money." Gao Chongjiu listened to their conversation and interjected that the Wang family had the Drain Map in hand, never caring about specific construction, always calling disciples and grand-disciples under them to open drains—although the successive heads of the Wang family had humble status, the private wealth in the family wasn't small.

"...I think the deceased is possibly indeed Wang Daniao. The body shape is really very similar—now there correspond shoes as evidence."

"Since his family has money, why wear such inferior shoes?"

"This isn't strange," Gao Chongjiu said, "Wang Daniao is quite stingy usually, only willing to spend money on women and his son. He isn't particular about food and clothing."

"Assuming the deceased is indeed him, why did the murderer want to kill him, and why cut off his head and genitals?" Wu Xiang said, "The most valuable thing on him is the Drain Map. The murderer just had to kill him and grab it. Why take the risk to do that series of things afterward?"
