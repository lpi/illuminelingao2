# Chapter 1818 - Interrogation

Gao Chongjiu said: "Li Ziyu from the Public Security Section used to patrol that area. He knows the territory well and is familiar with the parties involved. Let him come help me with this."

Wu Xiang nodded: "Fine, but he'll be needed elsewhere soon. Two days with you at most."

"Two days is enough." Gao Chongjiu seemed very confident.

Wu Xiang called Li Ziyu over: "Xiao Li, since you're familiar with the parties involved, I'm assigning you to work with Old Gao on this."

Gao Chongjiu emerged and handed the case receipt to Zeng Juan: "You're in luck—they've accepted your case. Let's head out to investigate right now!"

Zeng Juan dropped to his knees with a thud, weeping: "Thank you officers for your great kindness and virtue. My sister's spirit in heaven will surely bless you all with long life."

Gao Chongjiu found this rather unsettling. He quickly waved for Li Ziyu to help him up: "Get up quickly. Great Song... ah... doesn't go for this sort of thing. Child disappearance cases are all about time—the faster we move, the better our chances of finding her."

Leaving the police bureau, Gao Chongjiu didn't head to Zeng Juan's brother-in-law's teahouse. Instead, he first went to a teahouse diagonally across from the municipal government building and whispered a few words to a waiter.

Teahouses near the prefectural and county yamen had always been gathering places for those in government service to conduct business. Though the prefectural yamen had become the municipal government, Gao Chongjiu's old connections still operated here. One word from him, and before long there would be news coming back.

Leaving the teahouse, Gao Chongjiu said to Li Ziyu: "By tomorrow evening there should be word. Tell your little brother to rest easy."

Li Ziyu felt a surge of warmth. He hadn't had much contact with Gao Chongjiu and never imagined he'd be such a warmhearted person. He hurried to flatter him, saying when he had free time he'd definitely treat him to tea.

Gao Chongjiu was deliberately cultivating him, so he exchanged a few more courtesies.

The group arrived at the Wanshenglu Teahouse. Morning was the teahouse's busiest time. Used steamer baskets piled at the entrance. Waiters' calls rose and fell. A scene of thriving prosperity.

Gao Chongjiu swaggered in with Li Ziyu in tow, stopped in the middle of the floor, and cleared his throat with a cough.

A sharp-eyed waiter had already spotted police officers entering. He hurried over to greet them. Seeing familiar faces, he quickly greeted them:

"Ninth Master! It's you! It's been ages since you've graced our humble establishment. Are you here for tea today or on duty? Let me find you a seat first—shall I bring a pot of cool tea?"

Gao Chongjiu didn't look directly at the waiter. With a smile that didn't reach his eyes, he snorted and said: "Is your boss in?"

"Yes! Yes!" The waiter saw he wasn't sitting or chatting, then noticed Li Ziyu and Zeng Juan standing beside him—both familiar faces—and knew something was wrong. He hurried to say: "I'll go get him right away. Please sit over here, your honor..."

"No need," Gao Chongjiu said. "I'm here on official business today. A case! Have your boss and his wife both come out. I'll ask a few questions and then leave." That said, he remained standing in the center of the hall.

His standing there was no small matter. Teahouse customers generally didn't like having "law enforcement" nearby—let alone law enforcement not there to drink tea. Immediately, those wanting to enter from outside stopped coming in, and those who'd been planning to stay for a few more rounds settled their bills and left. The boss and his wife, who hurried out in alarm, inwardly groaned.

Zeng Juan's brother-in-law was surnamed Cao. Gao Chongjiu knew him—this kind of "official" constable spent his days roaming the city and knew everyone. And teahouse operators had to deal with all sorts of people. To operate normally, they were always accommodating to constables and runners.

In Boss Cao's recollection, though he had no special relationship with Gao Chongjiu, he hadn't offended him either. They got along on a surface level.

Seeing Zeng Juan beside Gao Chongjiu, his face immediately lengthened—*That little bastard!* Boss Cao silently cursed. Then seeing Li Ziyu too, he inwardly cursed his bad luck even more! He knew this Li Ziyu—back when he used to hang around with his former brother-in-law's group, they'd often come to the teahouse to mooch meals. Who'd have thought he'd become a government officer now!

No need to say it—these two "Australian constables" had been instigated by that little bastard Zeng Juan to make trouble for him! Thinking this, Boss Cao's sphincter tightened. He hurried to plaster on an ingratiating smile and approached:

"Oh my! Ninth Master! What an honor to have you here! Please, please, sit here. Wife, quickly bring good tea for the two officers!"

Gao Chongjiu unceremoniously declined: "No need. You're the boss?"

"Your honor really is forgetful of us humble folk..."

"Cut that nonsense! I'm here on duty," Gao Chongjiu glared. "Working a case!"

"Yes, yes." Boss Cao groaned inwardly. "This humble one is indeed the boss."

"What's your name?"

"Cao Xueguang."

"And your wife?"

"Coming right away, coming right away!" Boss Cao nodded and bowed.

Zeng Juan's former brother-in-law's wife, Madam Huang, brought over two bowls of tea. She held them high, enthusiastically calling out: "Oh my, officers, please have some tea. It's so hot out and you're working so hard on official business."

Zeng Juan watched this vile woman's fawning manner and gritted his teeth with hatred, wanting nothing more than to step forward and kick her in the chest. But seeing this "dog couple" reduced to helpless groveling, he secretly relished it, and his determination to pass the civil service exam grew even stronger.

Gao Chongjiu didn't take the teacup. Hands behind his back, he said slowly: "We are the people's police. We don't touch a single needle or thread belonging to the common folk. No need for tea. Just answer our questions honestly."

"Yes, yes." Madam Huang was somewhat embarrassed. She could only set down the raised tray.

"So you're Boss Cao's wife?"

"Yes, yes, this servant is!" Though Madam Huang was vicious and fierce, she was still afraid of government officers.

"What's your name?"

"Cao, née Huang."

"How many children do you have?"

"Three. Ah, no, two... Three." Madam Huang was so flustered she misspoke.

"Which is it? Deceiving the Council of Elders is a crime, you know..."

Boss Cao hurried to say: "Reporting to Ninth Master: three. It's three."

"Are they all at home?"

The couple's faces immediately tensed. Gao Chongjiu knew his judgment was correct. Seeing they hadn't answered, he pressed: "Are they there or not?"

"Yes, yes, yes." Boss Cao could only say through gritted teeth.

"Bring them all out to see."

"Well, um..." Boss Cao's face showed difficulty. He couldn't help glancing at Madam Cao Huang.

Madam Cao Huang pushed forward: "Officer! What's there to see about a few little mud monkeys! How old are they? What law could they possibly break?"

Gao Chongjiu said: "Since they can't break any laws, what's wrong with letting us see them? We're just following orders. Please don't make things difficult for us."

Boss Cao now knew these police had come specifically about Mingnu. Endless evasion probably wouldn't fool them. He hurried to say: "The two younger ones are at home. I'll have someone bring them out for the officers to see right away. The eldest went to her grandmother's house and isn't home."

Gao Chongjiu made an "oh" sound and nodded: "In that case, please have Boss Cao send someone to bring the eldest back. Once I've seen them all in person, I can go back and close the case."

"Well, um, it's a long way. I'm afraid she can't come back right away." Boss Cao stammered.

"No problem. We came out today specifically to handle this case," Gao Chongjiu said unconcernedly. He pulled over a stool and sat down with a thump. "I'll just wait here slowly." He called to Li Ziyu: "Come, you sit too." Then to Boss Cao: "No need to attend to us here. Go about your business. When the child comes back, we'll take one look, ask a few questions, and leave."

Li Ziyu watched his whole performance—making things difficult for the Cao couple at every turn, yet watertight throughout—and couldn't help but admire him secretly. Two police officers in black uniforms sitting in the center of the hall—never mind customers outside not wanting to enter, even those inside would be driven away.

Cao Xueguang's face alternated between green and white. He didn't know what to do. He watched as nearby tea patrons either got up to leave or settled in with "watching a show from across the river" expressions. Madam Cao Huang couldn't hold back. She said: "What case are you two officers working on? Why must you see a ten-year-old girl? She's no fairy—what's there to see?"

"This is an official assignment." Gao Chongjiu said. "We must see her. Please understand." He called to a waiter: "Two bowls of tea—on my tab!" He then said amiably: "Madam, we can't drink your tea—regulations: don't take a single needle or thread from the masses, don't drink a single cup of their tea. This is my own order. I'll settle the bill shortly."

Boss Cao saw there was no escape. He could only say with a bitter face: "Mingnu isn't here..."

"Where did she go?"

"To Foshan."

"You just said she went to her grandmother's house." Gao Chongjiu said.

"That's right, that's right. She went to her grandmother's house in Foshan."

Gao Chongjiu laughed and said: "Your Mingnu has two grandmothers. One is her blood grandmother—this young Master Zeng's parents..." He pointed at Zeng Juan. "Did Mingnu come to your house?!"

Zeng Juan said loudly: "Reporting to Ninth Master: no!"

"As for the other grandmother," Gao Chongjiu said meaningfully, "that would be your mother, Cao née Huang. Your maiden name is Huang Ping. Your family lives in the Xiaonanmen outskirts. When did you get a family in Foshan?" He slammed his teacup heavily on the table and said sternly: "I advise you to be honest! Tell us—where did you really send Mingnu?!"

These words from Gao Chongjiu not only exposed Madam Cao Huang's lies to her face, but the last sentence also struck at the dark secret in their hearts like a thunderbolt. Boss Cao's face instantly went pale. His body swayed as if he could barely stand. Though Madam Cao Huang was inwardly terrified, she still tried to argue: "Mingnu has hands and feet. How can I keep track of her? Maybe she ran off somewhere to play."

"So she really is missing then?"

At this point, Madam Cao Huang couldn't deny it any longer. She could only admit that was indeed the case.

"When did she go missing?"

"Today... Yesterday..."

Zeng Juan couldn't hold back and shouted: "You're lying! When I came two days ago, Mingnu was already missing. This morning when I asked again, her whereabouts were still unknown. Not only didn't you care, you cursed me for meddling!"
