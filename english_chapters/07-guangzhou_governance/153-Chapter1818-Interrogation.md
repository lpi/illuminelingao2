# Chapter 1818 - Interrogation

Gao Chongjiu said: "Li Ziyu from the Public Security Section used to patrol that area. He knows the territory well and is familiar with the parties involved. Let him assist me with this."

Wu Xiang nodded: "Fine, but he'll be needed elsewhere soon. Two days with you at most."

"Two days is sufficient." Gao Chongjiu seemed thoroughly confident.

Wu Xiang summoned Li Ziyu: "Xiao Li, since you're familiar with the parties involved, I'm assigning you to work with Old Gao on this."

Gao Chongjiu emerged and handed the case receipt to Zeng Juan: "You're in luck—they've accepted your case. Let's head out to investigate immediately!"

Zeng Juan dropped to his knees with a heavy thud, weeping: "Thank you officers for your great kindness and virtue. My sister's spirit in heaven will surely bless you all with longevity."

Gao Chongjiu found this rather unsettling. He quickly motioned for Li Ziyu to help him up: "Rise quickly. Great Song... ah... doesn't go for this sort of thing. Child disappearance cases are all about time—the faster we move, the better our chances of finding her."

Departing the police bureau, Gao Chongjiu didn't proceed directly to Zeng Juan's brother-in-law's teahouse. Instead, he first visited a teahouse diagonally across from the municipal government building and murmured a few words to a waiter.

Teahouses near the prefectural and county yamen had always served as gathering places for government servants conducting business. Though the prefectural yamen had become the municipal government, Gao Chongjiu's old connections still operated here. A single word from him, and news would return before long.

Leaving the teahouse, Gao Chongjiu told Li Ziyu: "By tomorrow evening there should be word. Tell your younger brother to rest easy."

Li Ziyu felt a surge of warmth. He hadn't had much contact with Gao Chongjiu and never imagined him to be such a warmhearted person. He hastened to offer flattery, promising to treat him to tea when he had free time.

Gao Chongjiu was deliberately cultivating him, so he exchanged several more courtesies.

The group arrived at Wanshenglu Teahouse. Morning was the teahouse's busiest period. Used steamer baskets piled at the entrance. Waiters' calls rose and fell. A scene of thriving prosperity.

Gao Chongjiu swaggered in with Li Ziyu in tow, halted in the center of the floor, and cleared his throat with a conspicuous cough.

A sharp-eyed waiter had already spotted police officers entering. He hurried over to greet them, and recognizing familiar faces, quickly said:

"Ninth Master! It's you! It's been ages since you've graced our humble establishment. Are you here for tea today or on official duty? Let me find you a seat first—shall I bring a pot of cool tea?"

Gao Chongjiu didn't deign to look directly at the waiter. With a smile that touched only his lips, he snorted and said: "Is your proprietor in?"

"Yes! Yes!" The waiter noticed Gao Chongjiu wasn't sitting or chatting, then spotted Li Ziyu and Zeng Juan standing beside him—both familiar faces—and sensed something was amiss. He hurried to say: "I'll fetch him immediately. Please sit over here, your honor..."

"No need," Gao Chongjiu said. "I'm here on official business today. A case! Have your proprietor and his wife both come out. I'll ask a few questions and then be on my way." That said, he remained standing in the center of the hall.

His presence there was no trivial matter. Teahouse customers generally disliked having "law enforcement" nearby—let alone law enforcement not there to drink tea. Immediately, those wanting to enter from outside stopped coming in, and those who'd been planning to linger for a few more rounds hastily settled their bills and departed. The proprietor and his wife, who hurried out in alarm, inwardly groaned.

Zeng Juan's brother-in-law was surnamed Cao. Gao Chongjiu knew him—this sort of "official" constable spent his days roaming the city and knew everyone. And teahouse operators had to deal with all manner of people. Operating normally required being accommodating to constables and runners.

In Proprietor Cao's recollection, though he had no special relationship with Gao Chongjiu, he hadn't offended him either. They maintained surface cordiality.

Spotting Zeng Juan beside Gao Chongjiu, his face immediately lengthened—*That little bastard!* Proprietor Cao silently cursed. Then seeing Li Ziyu as well, he cursed his ill fortune even more fervently! He knew this Li Ziyu—back when he used to run around with his former brother-in-law's group, they'd often come to the teahouse to cadge meals. Who could have imagined he'd become a government officer now!

No need to spell it out—these two "Australian constables" had been instigated by that little bastard Zeng Juan to cause him trouble! Thinking this, Proprietor Cao's sphincter tightened. He hastened to plaster on an ingratiating smile and approach:

"Oh my! Ninth Master! What an honor to have you here! Please, please, sit here. Wife, quickly bring fine tea for the two officers!"

Gao Chongjiu unceremoniously declined: "No need. You're the proprietor?"

"Your honor truly forgets us humble folk..."

"Cut the nonsense! I'm here on duty," Gao Chongjiu glared. "Working a case!"

"Yes, yes." Proprietor Cao groaned inwardly. "This humble one is indeed the proprietor."

"What's your name?"

"Cao Xueguang."

"And your wife?"

"Coming directly, coming directly!" Proprietor Cao nodded and bowed.

Zeng Juan's former brother-in-law's wife, Madam Huang, brought over two bowls of tea. She held them high, enthusiastically calling out: "Oh my, officers, please have some tea. It's so hot out and you're working so hard on official business."

Zeng Juan observed this vile woman's fawning manner and ground his teeth with hatred, wanting nothing more than to step forward and kick her in the chest. But seeing this "dog couple" reduced to helpless groveling brought him secret satisfaction, and his determination to pass the civil service exam intensified.

Gao Chongjiu didn't accept the teacup. Hands clasped behind his back, he said deliberately: "We are the people's police. We don't touch a single needle or thread belonging to the common folk. No need for tea. Just answer our questions honestly."

"Yes, yes." Madam Huang was somewhat embarrassed. She could only set down the raised tray.

"So you're Proprietor Cao's wife?"

"Yes, yes, this servant is!" Though Madam Huang was vicious and fierce, government officers still intimidated her.

"What's your name?"

"Cao, née Huang."

"How many children do you have?"

"Three. Ah, no, two... Three." Madam Huang was so flustered she misspoke.

"Which is it? Deceiving the Council of Elders is a crime, you understand..."

Proprietor Cao hurried to say: "Reporting to Ninth Master: three. It's three."

"Are they all at home?"

The couple's expressions immediately tensed. Gao Chongjiu knew his judgment was correct. Seeing they hadn't responded, he pressed: "Are they there or not?"

"Yes, yes, yes." Proprietor Cao could only say through clenched teeth.

"Bring them all out to see."

"Well, um..." Proprietor Cao's face showed difficulty. He couldn't help glancing at his wife.

Madam Cao née Huang pushed forward: "Officer! What's there to see about a few little mud monkeys! How old are they? What law could they possibly break?"

Gao Chongjiu said: "Since they can't break any laws, what's the harm in letting us see them? We're simply following orders. Please don't make things difficult for us."

Proprietor Cao now understood these police had come specifically about Mingnu. Endless evasion probably wouldn't fool them. He hurried to say: "The two younger ones are at home. I'll have someone bring them out for the officers to view immediately. The eldest went to her grandmother's house and isn't home."

Gao Chongjiu made an "oh" sound and nodded: "In that case, please have Proprietor Cao send someone to bring the eldest back. Once I've seen them all in person, I can return and close the case."

"Well, um, it's a considerable distance. I fear she can't come back immediately." Proprietor Cao stammered.

"No problem. We came out today specifically to handle this case," Gao Chongjiu said unconcernedly. He pulled over a stool and sat down with a thump. "I'll simply wait here patiently." He called to Li Ziyu: "Come, you sit too." Then to Proprietor Cao: "No need to attend to us here. Go about your business. When the child returns, we'll take one look, ask a few questions, and leave."

Li Ziyu observed his entire performance—making difficulties for the Cao couple at every turn, yet flawless throughout—and couldn't help but secretly admire him. Two police officers in black uniforms seated in the center of the hall—never mind customers outside not wanting to enter, even those already inside would be driven away.

Cao Xueguang's complexion alternated between green and white. He didn't know what to do. He watched as nearby tea patrons either rose to leave or settled in with expressions of "watching a show from across the river." Madam Cao née Huang couldn't restrain herself. She said: "What case are you two officers working? Why must you see a ten-year-old girl? She's no fairy—what's there to see?"

"This is an official assignment." Gao Chongjiu said. "We must see her. Please understand." He called to a waiter: "Two bowls of tea—on my own tab!" He then said amiably: "Madam, we can't drink your tea—regulations: don't take a single needle or thread from the masses, don't drink a single cup of their tea. This is my own order. I'll settle the bill shortly."

Proprietor Cao saw there was no escape. He could only say with a pained expression: "Mingnu isn't here..."

"Where did she go?"

"To Foshan."

"You just said she went to her grandmother's house." Gao Chongjiu said.

"That's right, that's right. She went to her grandmother's house in Foshan."

Gao Chongjiu laughed and said: "Your Mingnu has two grandmothers. One is her blood grandmother—this young Master Zeng's parents..." He pointed at Zeng Juan. "Did Mingnu come to your house?!"

Zeng Juan said loudly: "Reporting to Ninth Master: no!"

"As for the other grandmother," Gao Chongjiu said meaningfully, "that would be your mother, Cao née Huang. Your maiden name is Huang Ping. Your family lives in the Xiaonanmen outskirts. When did you acquire a family in Foshan?" He slammed his teacup heavily on the table and said sternly: "I advise you to be honest! Tell us—where did you actually send Mingnu?!"

These words from Gao Chongjiu not only exposed Madam Cao née Huang's lies to her face, but the final sentence struck at the dark secret in their hearts like a thunderbolt. Proprietor Cao's complexion instantly went pale. His body swayed as if he could barely stand. Though Madam Cao née Huang was inwardly terrified, she still attempted to argue: "Mingnu has hands and feet. How can I keep track of her? Perhaps she ran off somewhere to play."

"So she really is missing then?"

At this point, Madam Cao née Huang could no longer deny it. She could only admit that was indeed the case.

"When did she go missing?"

"Today... Yesterday..."

Zeng Juan couldn't contain himself and shouted: "You're lying! When I came two days ago, Mingnu was already missing. This morning when I asked again, her whereabouts were still unknown. Not only didn't you care, you cursed me for meddling!"
