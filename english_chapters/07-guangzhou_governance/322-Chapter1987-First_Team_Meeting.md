# Chapter 1987 - First Team Meeting

After the meeting, Zeng Juan, Yao Yulan, and Huang Ping were led directly to Room 114 by Wang Qiyi. Looking at the bright windows and clean tables of the office, Zeng Juan always had an indescribable complex feeling. Regarding knowledge, Chiefs knew astronomy above and geography below, even recounting trivial matters of barbarian marriages thousands of miles away with familiarity.

A few days ago, he occasionally heard Director Zhang and Director Nan along with a group of female colleagues in the hall chatting about the Jianzhou Jurchens. They said there was a woman in the Mongol Khorchin tribe called Da Yu'er, thirteen years old in the fifth year of Tianqi of the Usurper Ming, married to Jianzhou Jurchen Huang Taiji as a concubine, bearing three daughters. Although this woman was the concubine of the slave chieftain, she was childhood sweethearts with Huang Taiji's fourteenth brother Dorgon. However, worldly affairs are impermanent and father's orders hard to disobey; the lovers could only be speechless upon meeting. Just this was enough, but this Da Yu'er's elder sister Harjol was also taken into the palace by that slave chieftain Huang Taiji two years ago (1634) and was heavily favored... These boudoir matters were recounted pile by pile as if experienced personally. Spoken clearly and logical, as if seen with own eyes—even housewives by the water well weren't this gossipy.

Gossip was fine, but usually Chiefs' style was no different from boorish villagers. Even Director Zhang walked with a valiant martial air, not showing a bit of gentleness expected of a wife and mother. Just now at the meeting, Director Ai chopped his hand down fiercely telling them to investigate to death—murderous spirit everywhere, without the steadiness expected of a superior. Zeng Juan felt even the old fiends in yamen probably wouldn't be this rude.

Xu Zhewei and Chu Xiaoran arrived very quickly. Both were notified temporarily, looking blank after sitting down. Wang Qiyi arranged to give them the files and let Zeng Juan explain the basic situation, then closed his eyes to rest his mind alone.

A few days ago, he met with main leaders of Guangzhou city individually to discuss the handling idea of this case. Roughly speaking, ideas were within expectation: One was weaving crimes, haggling over every ounce; two was acting according to law, inadvisable to implicate widely. Finally was Liu Xiang; his opinion was "Golden Mean." This wasn't him playing slick; he hoped to strike the power of gentry and big households hard, yet didn't wish to engage in excessive harsh laws and severe punishments ruining market vitality, affecting economic vitality—after all, improving economy was his primary goal.

Even within the Finance and Tax Bureau, his and Ai Zhixin's ideas diverged. Ai Zhixin insisted on the concept of violent organs, positioning the Finance and Tax Bureau as the manifestation of state power, ensuring public compliance with rigid management. Specifically to Case 712 Stamp Tax Case, Ai Zhixin hoped to use this opportunity to give Guangzhou city's big households a severe warning. Even hitting grass to scare snakes for those without involvement, letting these guys who haven't truly felt meat pain since the Senate entered the city understand how to be obedient subjects. His so-called "Breaching one point to pull out a string" actually intended to engage in massive implication among merchants, especially big households.

However, according to the financial behaviors in Great Ming commerce Wang Qiyi learned from field census, it was far more complex than imagined. Mutual borrowing and shareholding were numerous as ox hairs. Although Finance and Tax Bureau management was already very extensive [rough], it couldn't stand merchants being even more "extensive." If really finding one line to investigate a string, estimate all big and small merchants in Guangzhou would be finished; the strike surface was truly too big. By then deterrence force would be enough, but would scare a large batch of industrial and commercial households to close and run.

Wang Qiyi believed the Finance and Tax Bureau in this spacetime plane undertook not just simple work of Finance Bureau plus Tax Bureau. As the only social economic management organ of the Senate, it should emphasize "Reasoning." Besides taxation, more importantly managing economic order well and focusing on cultivating tax sources. "Digging big pond to raise good fish" was also one of the duties. Now Guangzhou fiscal revenue already had guarantee. Grasping the whole group of big households to torment to death was truly unnecessary; setting a few examples to kill chicken to scare monkeys would do. Moreover, the Senate established administration in Guangzhou for just a year; actually indigenous people's understanding of various policies was very limited. Not only giving them a warning but also giving them a buffer, an opportunity, letting them self-correct and actively keep consistent with the Senate—courtesy before force.

These differences were fine, after all they were hidden. Before the second quarter collection period started, Zhang Xiaoqi returned to Lingao to look after children and summarize Guangzhou experience to start perfecting fiscal systems of various governments in Hainan Grand Region. Ai Zhixin also went to Lingao according to plan for questioning by Administration Council regarding Guangzhou Municipal Tax Sharing/Grading Pilot Plan. Wang Qiyi himself dead-skin-face [shamelessly] insisted on following his wife "back home to look," directly leading to Guangzhou Finance and Tax Bureau's Senator team being empty for over a week, truly offending Ai Zhixin who originally wanted him to sit in town in Guangzhou not lightly. After coming back, Director Ai's face became very unsightly, smiles always revealing reluctance.

A ball of flax [mess]... Wang Qiyi rubbed his temples. Transmigration, transmigration, so what if transmigrated. Thought being a superior man needed no more mental and physical effort, unexpectedly involving people, money, things, tearing happened just the same, even harder to handle than old timeline. Back then at least everyone understood tacitly and had baselines, while this bunch of Crude Blanks in Lingao truly dared to ride on your face to tear... He looked up finding others in the room were silently flipping through files, involuntarily smiling wryly again.

Above was hard to deal with; below wasn't easy either. An unsuccessful scholar of the old era, a refugee without family, a widow dragging a daughter, a former indigenous person who resisted "Government Army," plus a loyal informer... Still 3 men 2 women, truly damn god-match. Pity if Hollywood didn't film this as a series.

Pit, big pit. His finger gently rubbed back and forth on the teacup handle, heart starting to calculate how to use these guys out. Although these few before eyes could be said to be the best goods he could take out, this quality was truly not reassuring. Saying nothing else, just this age: except Chu Xiaoran slightly older, others were all bratty boys and girls around twenty. Just hope they don't get temperamental and poke big baskets; that would ruin their whole lives.

Steady, still should put Steady as head. Wang Qiyi suddenly remembered a sentence seen on BBS when still in Lingao: "Build hard stockades, fight dull battles." Putting it here was truly appropriate.

"Everyone read the case, right? Inspection Division's Director Li wrote very detailedly." Wang Qiyi straightened body and scanned a circle. This room decoration was too like old timeline; he seemed to find back the feeling of hanging post at grassroots back then. "Now you aren't familiar with the case, nor familiar with each other. So my requirement for today's work is: first read the file thoroughly, second communicate more among yourselves, not just about the case. Since partnering for these months, I don't hope you are still nodding acquaintances when disbanding at the end. Understood?"

"Understood! Director Wang." Five people stood up in unison again.

"Sit sit sit, we are discussing case details, not Loyalty Expression Assembly." Wang Qiyi truly had no good feeling for this set naturalized citizens liked especially. Don't know which guy invented it? "I'll arrange briefly first, Xu Zhewei..."

"Here!"

"Sit down, sit down!" Wang Qiyi covered face with hands helplessly spreading in the chair. This military training effect was too good. "I say, in this room no matter who says what, not allowed to be so startled again, understand!? ...Yao Yulan what are you doing? Sit down!"

Yao Yulan heard Wang Qiyi's words and conditioned reflexively wanted to stand up again, interrupted forcefully. For a time half-bowed body sticking buttocks out, hands pressing on table, neither standing nor sitting.

"...You sit quickly sit quickly." Wang Qiyi saw her awkward there and hurriedly reached out signaling her to sit down again.

"Hahahaha" "Hahaha" Xu Zhewei led, other few also chuckled lightly. Atmosphere instantly harmonized a lot.

Seeing Yao Yulan sitting back, Huang Ping next to her hurriedly pushed her stool forward conveniently, "It's okay, sit down quickly." Seeing Yao Yulan blushing all over face, he hurriedly comforted, "Everyone is happy Director Wang said no more this set in future, not against you."

"Before you read case files, I'll spend a few minutes simply talking about some tax-related details involved in this case. You are contacting such case for the first time; fear some things not comprehended deeply."

......

Off-work whistle had sounded twice, but Wang Qiyi still talked non-stop, flying dragon and dancing phoenix [flamboyant calligraphy/gestures] talking and drawing in front of the presentation board. His so-called "Simple Talk" hadn't stopped for 5 hours since afternoon work start till now. The five naturalized citizen cadres below dared not doze off, but faces of blankness also showed they were already turned into brain paste by Wang Qiyi's impassioned "Guidance."

"You remember, meaning of Deemed Sales of Goods is collecting payment or issuing receipt to purchaser..." Wang Qiyi cared nothing about subordinates' numb expressions, getting more HIGH as he spoke. Transmigrated for seven or eight years, words spoken were big and comprehensive; training class only taught basic knowledge. Never had such dripping pleasure talking business once. This time finally refreshed, care not if they could understand.

"Bang bang bang"

"Come in!"

"Director Wang, canteen started serving meal. Still send here like noon?"

"Okay." Wang Qiyi raised hand looking at watch, "Ouch so late. You notify them, send over quickly."

"Okay."

Zeng Juan's dinner ate as quietly as lunch. Others too. In the room only sounds of chewing rice and drinking soup. Director Wang's Chief authority placed there; no one dared speak or move recklessly. Plus Chief himself wasn't considered very good at talking; started topics several times wanting to liven atmosphere but ended up with nothing definite, atmosphere becoming more awkward instead.

"Alright, you eat slowly. I'm going to training class." Wang Qiyi had self-knowledge, shoveled two mouthfuls of rice randomly counting as finished. "Understand as much as you can of what lectured in afternoon; don't take to heart, mainly have a perceptual knowledge. Like this, Team Leader Zeng..." Wang Qiyi got up and patted Zeng Juan closest to him conveniently, "You watch time. About time let everyone go back to rest. No task tonight."
