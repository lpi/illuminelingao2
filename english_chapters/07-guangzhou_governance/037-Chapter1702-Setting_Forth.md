# Chapter 1702 - Setting Forth

After the oath-taking concluded, the order came: "Return to barracks, pack up, immediate mess call." Tian Liang returned to his company and was about to instruct the cooking squad to hurry with the meal.

Since they would soon be marching out, the cooks had prepared all the remaining good provisions—a feast rivaling New Year's. Platter after platter of roasted sausages, braised chicken, cabbage stewed with pork slices...the dishes kept coming, all you could eat.

Today even the rice was different—no longer brown rice but real polished white rice, steaming hot.

The cooking squad leader was an old soldier, kept behind with the rear echelon due to his age. As he ladled out portions, he spoke earnestly: "Brothers! Eat your fill. Once we've crossed the sea, who knows when we'll get a meal like this again!" As he spoke, Tian Liang noticed his eyes had reddened. He felt a tug at his own heart.

Seeing that the soldiers' expressions were all somewhat unnatural, Tian Liang was about to say something when the cooking squad leader produced a bottle of rum and poured a little for everyone. The squad leader was a Shandong native. He raised his bowl and said in New Speech tinged with a thick regional accent: "Brothers are about to go to war and see battle. I won't bother with fancy words—just a few auspicious ones." Raising his bowl high, he declared: "May you all triumph at every turn, may your horses bring you to victory, may you live a hundred years and your posterity rise to rank and nobility for ten thousand generations!" He drained his bowl in one gulp and showed it was empty.

Tian Liang raised his glass: "For the Yuan Council and the people! For victory! Cheers!"

The entire company raised their cups together and shouted: "For the Yuan Council and the people! For victory—cheers!"

At last the time for departure had come. The gates of Ma'ao Base swung open. The color guard, bearing the newly bestowed eagle banner of the Southern China Army, was the first to emerge. The crimson eagle standard fluttered in the sunlight, a silver double-headed eagle perched atop it, the flagpole adorned with magnificent golden cords and black-and-white ribbons.

Beneath the eagle banner, Xi Yazhou rode forth in full regalia, mounted on his warhorse. Behind him came his cavalry escort—composed of former Japanese mounted warriors—followed by one company after another marching to the beat of drums and the wail of fifes: infantry, artillery, engineers, logistics troops...hooves clattered and wagon wheels rumbled.

In the fields beside the base, along the irrigation ditches, farming laborers straightened from their work to watch the splendidly renewed, finely arrayed army march out of the base—column after column, seemingly endless. From the slogans that split the sky, they had long known the troops were setting out on campaign. Now, seeing the army emerge, they dropped their tools and crowded onto the road embankment.

The families of soldiers whose homes were nearby had long since received word that the troops would be marching out. They waited by the roadside, hoping to catch a glimpse of their loved ones. Now, seeing the army coming, they rushed to the road's edge, anxiously scanning the passing soldiers.

Tian Liang marched beneath his company's guidon. He saw the family of Lin Fu, the newly appointed commander of the 10th Battalion: parents, wife, and three children—the youngest still held in arms—waiting eagerly by the roadside, clutching Lin Fu and saying something to him. Though the battalion commander kept a straight face, feigning indifference, he couldn't stop stroking his children's heads. Tian Liang suddenly couldn't bear to watch.

*At least I'm unencumbered, with nothing to weigh me down*, he thought to himself.

"You all come back safe, you hear? I'll burn incense for you every day..." An old woman whom the troops often looked after had struggled up onto the embankment and called out loudly.

"Farewell, neighbors! Wait for us to return!" shouted a soldier.

"Army! Go well!" The old farmers wept! The neighbors wept! The villagers all wept! Men, women, old and young—all shed tears of reluctant parting.

From somewhere among the companies rose the song *Farewell to Our Loved Ones*, set to the tune of *Farewell of Slavianka*.

*The Yuan Council calls us to battle,*
*Warriors leave their homes, board the ships—this song accompanies their march.*

*In Holy Year Four we sang it defending Chengmai,*
*In Holy Year Eight we'll sing it entering Guangzhou.*

*Comrades, arise as one—through wind and rain, through hardship, all these years.*

*Forward, comrades, bravely forward—we rise for our motherland, into sacred war!*
*Forward, comrades, bravely forward—we rise for our motherland, into sacred war!*
*Rice-waves roll across the fields, our homeland strides ahead.*

*Vanquish the enemy, praise the Yuan Council, defend our happiness and peace!*
*Vanquish the enemy, praise the Yuan Council, defend our happiness and peace!*

The singing grew ever louder, soaring to the heavens. Under the blue sky, the blue-gray army stretched like a great serpent from Ma'ao all the way toward Bopu.

Bopu Harbor was fully prepared for the army's departure. Masts crowded the docks like a forest. To ensure safe transport, all troop ships this time were T800-class large sailing vessels; even the galleons captured from the Spanish were pressed into service. The *Great Whale*, a flat-decked barge that rarely operated due to fuel shortages, had also been refurbished to carry warhorses and artillery.

Materiel and cannons had already been loaded aboard and lashed down with ropes. The sailors waited on deck. It was indeed a fine day.

Along the streets of Bopu, from far outside the town, crowds of soldiers' families and civilians seeing off the army lined both sides—a sea of humanity. Bopu's streets were decorated with festive lanterns, streamers, banners, and flags. Groups of students in uniform waved small paper Morning Star flags, cheering.

One, two, three...dozens, hundreds of military banners flew and snapped in the wind.

These flags varied in design and pattern. Blue Morning Star national flags, the Fubo Army banner with its cogwheel, wheat sheaves, and iron fist, battalion colors embroidered with various insignia and ribbons marking battle honors and decorations, personal flags of transmigrators...all manner of banners danced in the clear sky.

Beneath the flags, marching in three-column formation to military songs, came the soldiers in their brand-new Year Five uniforms, packs and weapons on their backs, striding in step along the streets toward the docks under their officers' lead.

The Army's four infantry battalions—the 1st, 8th, 9th, and 10th—along with the Southern China Army headquarters and the army and brigade logistics and attached units, had marched on foot from Ma'ao Fortress to this place. Here they would board ships bound for the first destination of the northern expedition: Hong Kong.

Flags, ribbons, cheers—amid all this tumult, Tian Liang marched with head held high in time with the songs, basking in the fervent gazes and cheers from both sides of the street. He felt almost dizzy. When had he ever received such glory? He felt his whole body filled with strength.

Just then he noticed an officer in the column ahead, striding boldly forward—by his rank, also a company commander or thereabouts. Beside him a handsomely dressed naturalized woman was walking hard to keep pace with him. She must be the officer's wife, come to see her husband off. Watching her figure as she kept alongside the marching column without falling back, he couldn't help but be moved by her devotion.

*Make sure you come back alive*, he thought silently. *Otherwise you'll be letting your wife down!*

In East Gate Market, an hour after the troops had left their barracks, Wang Luobin, the newly appointed Chairman of the Yuan Council—dressed in an unranked Year Five Army uniform—rode in an open carriage to the East Gate Market Stadium for a meeting. This had been temporarily converted into a venue. Not only were most of the transmigrators in Lingao gathered here, but the assemblymen of the county advisory councils from across Hainan had also been summoned to attend.

The carriage was escorted by thirty-six splendidly attired cavalrymen. The heralds carried the Morning Star national flag, the Chairman's flag, and Wang Luobin's personal transmigrator banner. The procession trotted along the main road. Every house along the route displayed the national flag. Streets and lanes were packed with excited, enthusiastic crowds. Laughter and shouts mingled, wave after wave of cheers rolling toward the procession.

Wang Luobin's carriage arrived at a cleared cargo yard near the docks. This had been prepared as the site for the departure ceremony. A great festooned arch stood in the center of the grounds, and a temporary reviewing stand had been erected beside it. When the carriage stopped below the stand and Wang Luobin stepped down to wave to the crowd, a shout of "Long live the Yuan Council!" suddenly erupted from the masses. Then everyone began shouting "Long live!" and countless small flags waved like a surging tide.

He mounted the reviewing stand. The principal officials of the Yuan Council had already arrived. Wang Luobin exchanged greetings with them, then waited for the troops led by Xi Yazhou to arrive.

The Southern China Army's banner approached from the distance. The column halted below the stand. Xi Yazhou rode up to the reviewing stand, dismounted with a swing, tugged at the hem of his uniform, and strode up the steps with his hand on his command sword. Before Wang Luobin, he snapped to attention with a *crack*, saluted, and reported in a loud, measured cadence:

"Fubo Army! Commander of the Southern China Army! Major General of the Army! Xi Yazhou! Reporting: Request permission to depart!"

Wang Luobin answered loudly: "Permission granted to depart!"

Xi Yazhou turned, descended the stand, mounted his horse, and gathered his reins. At that moment Wang Luobin took up a great horn and blew the departure call.

*Woooo—*

The deep, resonant note echoed over Bopu.

"The Chairman himself is sounding the horn!"

This news rolled through the crowd like a wave across the sea.

"They're going to conquer the realm!"

The thought flashed through everyone's mind.

"Advance!" Xi Yazhou raised his riding crop.

The troops began to pass in review before the reviewing stand. From the loudspeakers came the *March of the Fubo Army Warriors Setting Forth*:

*The whole nation takes up arms, all march out together,*
*See the great banners flying in splendor!*

*Whence comes this host?*
*From Qiongzhou at the ends of the earth.*

*Soldiers and civilians united as one,*
*Leading the charge to save the nation.*

*This cause the whole country answers.*

*Now we cross the strait—*
*We'll wipe the enemy clean!*

*Now we cross the strait—*
*We'll wipe the enemy clean!*

*Able generals lead elite troops,*
*Martial prowess unmatched in the world!*
*Under the red banner stands our leader, the Yuan Council.*

*Reconquer Bianliang,*
*Then take the lands of Youyan!*

*Exterminate the roving rebels and enjoy peace,*
*Exterminate the roving rebels and enjoy peace!*

*March out the passes and strike the Eastern Barbarians,*
*Restore our Cathay's fair rivers and mountains!*

*Drive back the Tartar soldiers, march together to Liaodong,*
*The people cheer for us, their soldier-sons!*
*The toiling masses shall be liberated,*

*The Chinese Revolution shall succeed!*

*The toiling masses shall be liberated,*

*The Chinese Revolution shall succeed!*

At first it was the choir over the loudspeakers, then all the troops and the crowd seeing them off joined in. The singing grew louder and louder, like rolling thunder, echoing across the southeastern sky.
