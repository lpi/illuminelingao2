# Chapter 1821 - Filing a Report

"What?! That can't be. No matter what, Mingnu is still your brother-in-law's own flesh and blood. His family isn't destitute—why would they sell her? Did you search for her first?" Li Ziyu was somewhat startled. He had visited Zeng Juan's brother-in-law's teahouse before, mooching meals with their group.

"It's all because of my brother-in-law's damned second wife!" Zeng Juan's face went white with anger as he spoke of her. "That woman has been going on about how Mingnu is a 'money-losing commodity' and wanted to sell her off as a servant girl. She'd been scheming about this for quite a while. I never imagined she'd actually go through with such a vicious act!" As he spoke, he couldn't help but break into sobs.

Zeng Juan hadn't originally had much affection for this niece. But after his sister passed away, the child became the only living memento of his sister in this world. Her place in his heart became entirely different.

"Hey, hey—real men don't cry easily. Don't weep!" Li Ziyu hurried to comfort him. "Come, tell me what happened!"

"Two days ago I went to bring the children some snacks and clothes. Coming out of the teahouse I happened to see Chengzi and Huazi—my two nephews. You've met them..."

"I know them. Get to the important part."

"Chengzi and Huazi were just sitting on the street, not playing or making noise. When I spoke to them, they both started crying, saying Mingnu was gone!"

"When did this happen?"

"They said she wasn't at dinner the night before yesterday." Zeng Juan said. "I hurried to find my brother-in-law and his wife. Brother-in-law hemmed and hawed. That woman insisted Mingnu had just gone out to play. I pressed them again and again until brother-in-law finally admitted Mingnu 'wasn't there.' I asked where she'd gone. At first they wouldn't say. Later, when I kept asking, that woman started cursing me for 'meddling.' Then she said Mingnu had run off on her own. Later she changed her story again, saying Mingnu had been snatched by 'kidnappers'... When I asked my brother-in-law to come help search for Mingnu, she blocked us every way. That's when we got into a fight and I got pushed to the ground..." After finishing his furious account, Zeng Juan wept and pleaded with Li Ziyu: "Brother Yu, you have to help me! When a child goes missing, the authorities never bothered with it before. How is our family supposed to find her now...? Wuuu wuuu wuuu..."

"Don't worry, Brother Zeng! Child disappearances are major cases in Great Song. Just sit tight. I'll have Ah Gui come take your statement for the report, and I'll immediately go report to my superiors!"

"Brother Yu, I, Zeng Juan, swear I'll repay your kindness as an ox and horse for the rest of my life!"

Li Ziyu had no time for pleasantries. He remembered from the anti-trafficking training at the Wanshou Palace that the instructor had specifically emphasized the "time-sensitivity" of abduction cases. If reported and handled within the first 24 hours, the chances of recovery were much higher. The more time passed, the lower the chances of solving the case.

He hurried to the Criminal Investigation Section to report the case to the detective on duty.

The detective on duty was Gao Chongjiu. The Criminal Investigation Section had plenty of work—he had over a dozen cases of various sizes on his hands. However, child trafficking cases were classified as "major cases" in Great Song's police system. He didn't dare treat it lightly. He quickly instructed them to first take Zeng Juan's statement, then transfer it over when done.

"Name?"

"She only has a nickname—Mingnu."

"Age?"

"Ten years old this year."

"Gender?"

"Huh? Female, female."

"Home address?"

"Mine or Mingnu's?"

"The child's, naturally."

"141 Six Banyan Street, Wanshenglu Teahouse."

"How long has she been missing?"

"She wasn't seen at dinner the night before last." Zeng Juan said. "If I hadn't gone to deliver snacks today, I still wouldn't know Mingnu was missing." Thinking about what bad people Mingnu might encounter made Zeng Juan choke up again.

...

Zeng Juan gave his statement to Ah Gui—at this point the case hadn't risen to the level of a trafficking case. By procedure, it could only be classified as a missing persons case.

Gao Chongjiu looked over the statement. Seeing that Li Ziyu had personally accompanied the reporter, he knew the person filing the report must have some connection to this Officer Li. He couldn't be indifferent—he even needed to appear cordial. Among the first cohort from the Wanshou Palace, this Li Ziyu was doing the best, clearly favored by the chiefs.

By the old rules, the yamen wouldn't have handled such cases at all. In Guangzhou city, the number of women and children who went missing each year numbered in the hundreds if not thousands. Under the former Ming's government, such cases would definitely never be handled. Gao Chongjiu had solved a few "kidnapper" cases when he was a constable, but most were due to accidentally stumbling upon clues, then investigating deeply and finally cracking them. Very few were solved after someone reported to the authorities—constables generally didn't bother with such matters. Only occasionally would wealthy families request searches.

Though the constables' custom of "eating black" was standard practice, they generally didn't accept "offerings" from kidnappers. This trade not only separated flesh and blood families, but those in this line acted in strange and sinister ways. Even those in official service feared being tainted by association with them—"injuring one's hidden virtue."

However, though there was no collusion, that didn't mean those in government service didn't know about their activities. Constables in particular had extensive networks of low-level informants and eyes. If they put in effort, finding a person wasn't too difficult. So Gao Chongjiu first said a few comforting words to Zeng Juan before asking about the specific details of the case.

But after reading the statement and asking a few questions, Gao Chongjiu said: "Looks like your brother-in-law sold the child himself."

Zeng Juan said urgently: "That's exactly right, Officer. But he refuses to admit it. His damned wife is even more vicious and slippery. That's why I came to the police station to report it..."

Gao Chongjiu said: "Since you're Ah Yu's friend, I won't beat around the bush. If he sold her himself, our police station really can't do anything about it..."

"How can that be..." Zeng Juan blurted out, then realized his tone wasn't respectful enough—he was asking for help here!

Li Ziyu also said: "Ninth Master, please help us out! His sister left behind only this drop of blood. We can't let her be ruined!"

Gao Chongjiu said: "Ah Yu, you're too polite. It's not that I won't help, but the way this report is filed, forget whether it can even be accepted as a case—even if it is, it's useless. Though anti-trafficking is now handled as a major case, Great Song law doesn't say selling your own children is illegal. If we investigate and your brother-in-law just produces the body-sale contract, this case ceases to be a missing persons case, and the police can't do anything to him."

Gao Chongjiu was an old hand at government affairs. Though he'd only been a Great Song police officer for a few days, he'd already read the several laws and regulations issued by the Council of Elders relevant to daily casework several times. Yamen constables and runners, though they committed all manner of misdeeds themselves, had much stronger "legal consciousness" than ordinary citizens. When bamboozling common folk, they could cite laws and regulations off the top of their heads, leaving people dumbfounded. These few sentences came out effortlessly, leaving Li Ziyu and Zeng Juan speechless.

"Furthermore, according to Great Song criminal law, reporting a missing persons case where the missing person is a child requires the guardian—meaning the parents—by regulation. Ah Juan is only the uncle, not a guardian. If he files this report, the bureau can simply refuse to accept the case."

"Then... then... what do we do?" Zeng Juan was so anxious he wanted to tear out his hair. Li Ziyu hurried to comfort him, then said: "Ninth Master, can you think of another way?"

Gao Chongjiu saw the timing was about right. He lowered his voice: "There is a way. But you need to have your friend say it this way..."

How to say it? Reporting a missing person directly wouldn't work because Zeng Juan wasn't Mingnu's guardian. His report wouldn't be accepted.

"...Just say his two nephews Chengzi and Huazi saw Mingnu talking to an old woman, then Mingnu followed her away. They called after her from behind but she didn't hear."

Li Ziyu let out an "ah," thinking this was fabricating testimony. He couldn't help feeling nervous. He whispered: "Wouldn't this be filing a false report?"

Gao Chongjiu said: "If you want to work this case, you have to say it this way. This way there's suspected 'kidnapping' involvement, and it can be filed as a 'child abduction case.' Once the case is filed, I'll take some brothers to that teahouse. Use some methods—a few misleading words, a few scares—and we'll get the girl's whereabouts. What happens next is your friend's business."

Li Ziyu felt this wasn't quite right, but he knew old hand Gao Chongjiu had a point. Just the guardian hurdle alone was one they couldn't get over.

After much deliberation, Li Ziyu pulled Zeng Juan aside and explained thus and so. Zeng Juan immediately said no problem—as long as it could save Mingnu, he was willing to say anything.

"You need to think this through clearly. When the time comes, if your brother-in-law produces the body-sale contract, the police station can't do anything to him either. How to save Mingnu—you'll have to figure that out yourself."

"As long as I can find out where Mingnu is, I'll definitely find a way to rescue her." Zeng Juan was full of resolve.

The two finished their discussion. Zeng Juan immediately filed the report according to the script Li Ziyu had coached him on. Gao Chongjiu finished recording the statement and went to handle the case filing procedures.

Trafficking cases were classified as major cases in the Council of Elders' police system. As soon as the case was reported, the duty officer didn't dare delay. He immediately reported to Wu Xiang, who was on duty at the bureau. Case investigation began immediately. Before long, an officer from the Forensics Section brought over a standard facial composite kit. Li Ziyu knew this tool too—through the reporter's description of the subject's facial features, a likeness could be quickly assembled. Very convenient to use. This wasn't exactly a modern invention—ancient yamen had similar methods. But portrait sketching skills back then were poor, and the assembled images often bore little resemblance to the actual person. Nothing like these lifelike composite cards.

The officer quickly assembled a composite most resembling Mingnu based on Zeng Juan's description. Li Ziyu took the image to the copy room to request copies—the police bureau naturally had no copying machine. They used a photo-reproduction method with cameras. The prints wouldn't be ready until tomorrow at earliest.

Though the case was filed, Wu Xiang didn't have enough manpower to assign. At this point Gao Chongjiu volunteered: "I'll handle this case."

"You already have over a dozen cases on your plate."

"No matter. This kind of trafficking case is mainly about gathering intelligence. I know everyone in Guangzhou city. A day or two of asking around and I'll definitely have leads—if not, it'll probably be hard to crack."

Wu Xiang understood his meaning: "Alright, you handle it! Find the girl's whereabouts quickly. If too much time passes and they send her outside the city, she'll vanish like a stone in the ocean."
