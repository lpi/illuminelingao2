# Chapter 1965 - Tax Agency

In the personnel system, besides continuing to implement Lingao's method of evaluation through examination, preference would also be given to frontline grassroots and operational personnel. While increasing frontline subsidies, personnel exchanges would be strengthened. Newcomers would invariably first fill the tax administrator and front-desk collection positions. Only after being assessed as "competent" or higher in both positions and completing a certain number of years of service could they be adjusted to enter agency work.

According to the plan agreed upon with Ai Zhixin, Wang Qiyi reorganized the Finance and Tax Bureau personnel after completing the all-staff examination following the resumption of work. Excluding fewer than ten logistics personnel and employees who unfortunately passed away during the plague, the Finance and Tax Bureau now had a total of 78 operational personnel. Following the principle of mixed grouping of old and new, they were divided into 8 ordinary groups, with 9 people per group. The remaining 6 people were led by Wang Qiyi himself. These 9 groups would conduct a thorough survey of the entire Guangzhou city by area. Each area would be cross-checked and reviewed by different teams at least once. Wang Qiyi's team, besides being responsible for one area, would also conduct spot checks on the inspection situations of other areas.

"Sharpening the knife does not delay woodcutting," Wang Qiyi explained to Ai Zhixin at the previous briefing. "We have quite a lot of data on hand, but I want these people to go look and walk around on the ground. The root of tax collection is the tax source. The clearer and more comprehensive our grasp of the tax source, the more convenient it will be to carry out work later. We can collect tax a day late, but this work must be done solidly."

Currently, the Finance and Tax Bureau had a large amount of archival material transferred from the Civil Affairs, Police, and the old Guangzhou Prefecture. Starting tax work by relying on desk analysis of these things would be no problem. But Wang Qiyi believed that for taxation to be implemented effectively, the most important thing was for people to be grounded and management to be grounded. Forming work teams to walk the streets and alleys: first, to give Guangzhou citizens a direct impression of what the Executive Committee's new "tax collectors" looked like; second, to collect data by the most intuitive and direct means. Wang Qiyi didn't distrust the data transferred from Civil Affairs and other departments, but experience from the old timeline told him that seamless comparisons of desk data didn't imply truth. Moreover, relying entirely on others for such first-hand data felt terrible; tax work must have its own information sources.

"Remember, the most important things are walking, looking, asking, listening, and speaking." Wang Qiyi spoke to the ready-to-go teams at the work team mobilization meeting. "Walking means walking to every household; looking means observing every nook and cranny; asking means not omitting any questions on our inquiry form; listening means not only listening to answers but also listening to their complaints and whatever they are willing to say; speaking means publicizing our finance and tax work, telling the broad citizens how our Executive Committee's Finance and Tax Bureau differs from that of the Usurper Ming! Don't be afraid of being long-winded, and don't be afraid of mistakes. There are no mistakes—just record what you see and hear. What we want is the truth."

The finance and tax census method formulated by Wang Qiyi was crude even by new timeline standards. But he didn't care much. The survey situation of each individual household might have large discrepancies, but the results for entire blocks and entire industries wouldn't. That was enough. These materials were data preparation for the next step of refining tax categories and items, serving as the Guangzhou Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau's basic archives together with materials transferred from other departments. Another point was to discover cadres with high professional quality and strong responsibility during the inspection work to select for the tax assessment group, preparing talent reserves for the collection period starting soon. As for collection, his wife would be leading the third batch of teams coming here; those students in the finance and tax class were more suitable for this work than the current cadres.

"Okay, I have no objection to your plan." Ai Zhixin put the document on the desk. "I think we might as well call this work 'Sharpening the Knife.'"

"Sharpening the knife? As in 'sharpening the knife does not delay woodcutting'?"

"No, as in 'sharpening the knife for pigs and sheep.'"

After discussing the first order of business, Ai Zhixin and Wang Qiyi began refining the organization and management system of the Guangzhou Finance and Tax Bureau. In terms of organizational structure, the Finance and Tax Bureau temporarily only had tax collection operations. Ai Zhixin's previous vision was very correct and consistent with reality, so Wang Qiyi basically made no changes.

The Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau planned to be temporarily divided into two levels: agency and frontline. The frontline would only set up the Collection Division (Tax Collection Hall) and Management Division. The agency would set up the General Office, Collection and Management Division, Tax Assessment Division, Inspection Division, Tax Accounting Division, and Financial Accounting Division.

"Two accounting divisions aren't necessary. We have too few people; this can completely be merged into one division with internal sections." Ai Zhixin felt that with everyone shouting about personnel shortages, opening his mouth to ask for people while creating two similarly sounding institutions would likely get him sprayed by some meticulous but not very knowledgeable transmigrators.

"Heh heh, my Director Ai, this isn't easy to handle," Wang Qiyi patted his notebook. "Financial accounting manages our own money; tax accounting manages tax funds—the state's money. Putting them together makes getting sprayed even easier, doesn't it? Most importantly, you forgot—in the old timeline, on the night of December 31st each year, where did the party secretaries and mayors go to visit? The Planning and Statistics Courts of the National and Local Tax Bureaus and the Treasury Court of the People's Bank. It's the same here for Liu Xiang. He might not care how we collect tax, but he definitely cares about tax accounting reports. How about we modify it: rename Tax Accounting Division to Tax Statistics Division, and Financial Accounting Division to Finance Division. That should be fine."

"This works." Ai Zhixin nodded, feeling somewhat unhappy inside. It seemed his proposals were always changed around by the Wang couple. Though details, it was still unpleasant. He decided not to always offer opinions first. "Then Old Wang, tell me, should our bureau also have a slogan or tenet? Fangshaodi has the school motto 'Knowledge is Power.'"

"Serve the country, serve the economy, serve society." Wang Qiyi blurted out.

"Holy crap, Old Wang, can you be a bit political? This is 1635, not 2015. We are a management agency, not a service agency. I think just four words: Gather Wealth for the State..."

"Collect Tax for the People?" Wang Qiyi followed up reflexively.

"Just four words." Ai Zhixin was simply speechless. "Just the first four. Why for the people? If anything, it's for the Executive Committee. I don't want to create a bunch of taxpayers in this timeline who shout 'I am a taxpayer' at the drop of a hat."

"People pay tax and can't even talk about it? You're too dictatorial and overbearing." Wang Qiyi joked, but criticized inwardly: *Political awareness is really high. Leaving aside that Chinese traditional thinking lacks this consciousness, even abroad in the old timeline, those shouting this were just losers—shouting was useless anyway. Once money hits the treasury, it's not yours. The state collects tax not relying on conscientiousness or 'for country and people' awareness, but on the power of legalized violence controlled by the state apparatus.*

"We don't say it, but our tax is used that way. Even if only partly, the common people will feel we do better than we say," Ai Zhixin guided patiently. "If we say this tax is collected for the common people, then doing poorly subtracts points, and doing well adds no points."

"..." Whether tax was entirely taken from the people and used for the people was actually hard to explain clearly. Rather than leaving a handle for criticism, better to directy go with "Royal Grain and National Tax."

"Chinese say Royal Grain and National Tax; foreigners say only taxes and death are inevitable. Everyone knows clearly in their hearts; we don't need to be coy."

"Alright." Wang Qiyi didn't want to entangle too much on this issue. In the old timeline, he had been seconded up and down, and presided over work, but always hovered in deputy operational positions. This had much to do with his lack of interest in such affairs and poor political sensitivity. Being a "Vice" Director again in the new timeline confirmed that a leopard cannot change its spots.

After defining the organizational departments, the next step was posts, responsibilities, and personnel. Guangzhou Special Municipality Finance and Tax Bureau preliminarily determined:

Agency internal setup: General Office, with General Affairs Section, Secretarial Section, Personnel Section, Publicity Section, Archives Room, and Cashier Room, responsible for overall logistics. The Archives Room only managed internal archives, not tax archives. The Cashier Room was administratively under the General Office, but personnel and operations ran independently.

Collection and Management Division: With two internal sections for collection and management, primarily responsible for overall planning and coordination of frontline collection and management work. Currently merged offices with the frontline Collection Division and Management Division.

Tax Assessment Division: With Investigation, Preliminary Review, Assessment, and Re-review sections, responsible for tax assessment of all taxpayers in the jurisdiction. Whether fixed-amount collection or account-based collection, payment declaration requires a tax assessment notice issued by the Tax Assessment Division.

Inspection Division: With Case Selection, Hearing, Inspection, and Execution sections. Responsible for periodic or irregular tax inspections of taxpayers and the collection management of the Finance and Tax Bureau within the jurisdiction. Inspection methods could be key inspections of selected individual households or special inspections by area or industry. Except for collection operations, all Inspection Division operations could run independently.

Finance Division: Responsible for the Finance and Tax Bureau's own fund usage and management.

Tax Statistics Division: With Statistics Section and Ticket Section. Responsible for compiling tax reports and unified management of tax receipts/tickets.

Frontline departments only set up two:
Collection Division: Responsible for tax declaration and collection work within the jurisdiction.

Management Division: Responsible for urging tax reporting and payment, feedback on tax assessment situations, and tax law publicity within the jurisdiction.

"A bit top-heavy," Ai Zhixin muttered looking at the plan. "A pile of leaders in the agency, and below are all the ones doing the work. Are there too many sections?"

"Can't be helped. We can only lean towards the grassroots in personnel staffing, and wages and benefits must also be better for the grassroots." Wang Qiyi felt the same as Ai Zhixin about this plan. In the old timeline, he also felt the grassroots were tired and bitter, especially since his own wife was at the grassroots. But now that he was in charge doing top-level design, he realized those agency sections were really hard to cut or merge.
