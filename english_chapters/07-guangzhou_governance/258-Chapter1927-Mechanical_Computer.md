## Chapter 1927 - Mechanical Computer

"Is it entirely mechanical this time?" Ai Zhixin asked with concern. To be honest, he wasn't very reassured by the combination of "mechanical" and "computer." The Finance Department had used several hand-cranked mechanical calculators. On the whole, the results were barely satisfactory. Aside from being clunky, big, and ugly, they frequently malfunctioned. However, he had to admit that even so, their efficiency was much higher than calculating manually with an abacus.

"There are also some electronic computers," Feng Nuo said, hesitating slightly when he mentioned "electronic computers." This "electronic computer" was "cobbled together" by the IT department using stocked microcontrollers and other components—for most people, a pile of messy circuit boards couldn't be seen as a "computer."

"That's good then. The hand-cranked calculators we use in the Finance Department are just passable, but the failure rate is too high," Ai Zhixin shook his head. "Of course, it's still much faster than clerks calculating, but it can't automatically summarize. Without statistical functions, we still have to manually summarize and fill in forms—the margin for error there is huge."

The more hands numbers passed through, the greater the probability of error.

"That's why what we brought this time is a 'computer,' not a 'calculator,'" Feng Nuo said. "Where will our office be located? This set of equipment isn't small."

"Director Liu's opinion is that your office should be temporarily located in the Big World. As for the Computing Center—there are plenty of houses in Guangzhou city, but most decent ones are government offices or temples, all over a hundred years old. Many leak rain and grow mold, and there are lots of rats and insects, so they aren't suitable for housing your precision equipment—so the plan is to put it in the Guangzhou New District on Henan Island."

It was no secret that Henan Island was planned to be the new urban area of Guangzhou; the planning maps had long been released. In a sense, all the agencies currently working in the old city of Guangzhou were "temporary."

"How long will it take to build the computer room on Henan Island?" Feng Nuo was very concerned about this.

"The computer room is basically finished, but the conditions on Henan Island are relatively poor; it's basically a big rural village," Ai Zhixin said. "Actually, I think it's quite good. Guangzhou city is currently being dug up everywhere, so it's not much better than the countryside."

Feng Nuo and his colleagues didn't have much interest in this medieval city anyway, especially after seeing the notifications about plague and epidemics. They had absolutely no feeling for the old city of Guangzhou. Hearing that the computer room was already built, they immediately expressed that they could move there tomorrow.

"Don't rush," Ai Zhixin waved his hand. "Rest for a few days in the Big World first."

After seeing off Ai Zhixin, Feng Nuo and Xu Laowu had already "rested" enough on the boat—basically sleeping as soon as they got on, and even if they couldn't sleep, they just lay there. Now was a good time to stretch their muscles, so they walked and chatted inside the inner world of the Big World, looking forward to the future Southern Computing Center.

"Reasonably speaking, this computing center should be equipped with servers—after all, Guangzhou will be our capital for the next few years. Will this thing really work?" Xu Yicheng finally couldn't help saying what he had wanted to say all along.

The computing center Xu Yicheng managed in Lingao ran largely on servers from the old timeline—although he wasn't a professional hardware technician, he was well aware of the huge generational gap between electronic and mechanical computers. This machine, touted as the first practical mechanical computer manufactured by the Senate, fell far short in computing power not only of the world's first electronic computer, ENIAC, but even of the mechanical relay computer designed by the German Zuse.

Xu Yicheng had participated in the development process of this computer in Lingao. mainly looking at it, he felt it should at least be upgraded to a relay computer to have practical value.

"Actually, we don't have many usable servers left—not counting the systems sealed for backup at Gaoshanling—and you know those systems can't possibly be put into daily use."

The final backup system at Gaoshanling was the last resort for preserving and reading the vast ocean of data in the Great Library. The Senate hoped to use them to survive the "Dark Age" of computers. They wouldn't be touched now under any circumstances.

"Our IT department has a plan to build computing servers using ARM—the Planning Commission has a container full of reserves of those things. It will be no problem to use them until the day we can replicate tube or transistor computers. The key is that our peripherals are dying."

Whether keyboards, mice, monitors, hard drives, printers... these things all had lifespans, and the Planning Commission's reserves were naturally not inexhaustible.

Without peripherals, servers were meaningless. And now the demand for big data processing was expanding day by day. Just from the perspective of census and household registration, the expansion of data processing volume brought by the conquest of Guangdong had risen by a geometric order.

"So we can only use punched cards?"

"Exactly," Feng Nuo said. "Of course." After speaking, he fell into deep thought, his mind returning to the bumpy past of developing this computer.

Ten months ago.

"...PR14 is not conducting. Dr. Zhong, good luck, it's just a current-limiting resistor that's broken. I remember having a spare..." Feng Nuo said as he stood up from his chair and walked to an iron cabinet in the corner of the room. The iron cabinet was placed on a seemingly new white wood table, its height exactly level with Feng Nuo's upper body. Zhong Lishi saw that the iron cabinet was about half a meter high, half a meter deep, and one meter long. Much of the surface paint had peeled off, only the handle was polished shiny, and the keyhole was in the middle of the double doors. It looked like junk moved down from the *Feng City* wheel. It was probably originally a storage locker in the crew quarters.

Now the steel plant and machinery plant could also roll out cabinets of the same specifications; there were plenty in Zhong Lishi's office and warehouse. But for some reason, compared to what was brought from the original timeline, even compared to junk like this, the products of this timeline always looked rough, yet one couldn't specify exactly what was wrong. Zhong Lishi remembered the feeling of comparing American goods with domestic products when he first went to study in the US in the 90s. In this regard, the situation with his clock and battery products was even more serious. "Maybe it will be better in a few years," he thought to himself. "In the old timeline, by the year 2000, 'Made in China' had swept the world."

Feng Nuo took out a key and opened the cabinet door. There wasn't much inside: a stack of untidy printed materials, mixed with quite a few handwritten and hand-drawn materials and blueprints, a few light bulbs, a roll of solder, several self-sealing plastic bags, and a few iron boxes. Feng Nuo took out a battered Xinghualou mooncake tin, opened the lid, and took out a paper packet. The paper packet was stamped with an already blurred black stamp: Do Not Eat—obviously a product of this timeline. Zhong Lishi recognized it as desiccant manufactured by the chemical plant.

Feng Nuo closed the cabinet door, walked back to the desk, put the box on the workbench, and shook it under the desk lamp. The few components inside made a rattling sound. He picked one up, looked at it for a moment, shook his head, threw it back, and then said, "Doesn't seem quite right. Better not just swap it in for you." He paused to think, saw Zhong Lishi's pitiful expression, and quickly added, "Last month Shenhe's computer broke. It was also a Sony, seemed to be a similar model, maybe an older one. His problem was pretty serious—screen artifacts caused by loose soldering on the screen cable. Couldn't fix it with a soldering iron. We don't have specialized equipment and materials now, nor a clean room, so it's definitely a goner."

Zhong Lishi understood. He felt Feng Nuo was being a bit long-winded, laying so much groundwork just to tell him to go check Lin Shenhe's scrapped motherboard for a similar component. He was a bit anxious, worried that Lin Shenhe's broken computer was no longer in his possession. Just as he wanted to speak, sure enough, Feng Nuo continued, "Shenhe went to Gaoshanling to scrap the computer and happened to run into Feng Zongze going to store his computer. He's rarely in Lingao all year round, wouldn't have come back if not for this plenary session. The computer he brought hadn't been used much, so he planned to store it at Gaoshanling..." Seeing him dragging Feng Zongze into it, Zhong Lishi hurriedly said, "Then I'll go ask Shenhe. I might need your help to take a look in a few days. Thanks in advance." With that, he slipped out of the room.

Feng Nuo was stunned for a moment, having to shallow back the gossip about Shenhe borrowing Feng Zongze's computer. He thought it would probably be difficult for Dr. Zhong to get parts from Lin Shenhe's old computer. Since that gentleman's computer couldn't be repaired, it was already scrapped; technically, ownership had reverted to the Planning Commission and the Senate.

Since the crossing, as time passed, more and more personal items from the old timeline belonging to Elders were being scrapped. Elders generally had deep feelings for these items, especially "Alien-tech" products like computers that were unlikely to be revived in their lifetimes. Most hoped to preserve them in a more professional environment like the Planning Commission's controlled goods warehouse; the hot and humid environment of Elder apartments or offices would only accelerate damage.

Out of consideration for preserving old timeline technology, the Planning Commission also offered a paid service to recover old timeline waste items from Elders.

Although the recovery conditions offered by the Planning Commission were very attractive—often new timeline high-grade special supplies, plus some old timeline office supplies, expired or nearly expired food and luxury goods, etc.—many people still hoped to rent a sealed storage box in the Planning Commission warehouse to seal these old items up, waiting for a slim chance to see the light of day again.

However, electronic and electrical items like computers were not within the scope of the storage service. Once confirmed by maintenance personnel as unrepairable, they would be forced into the scrapping procedure so that the Planning Commission could dismantle these waste devices to obtain more spare parts. Although electronic equipment nowadays mostly used large-scale integrated circuits and there weren't many components that could be desoldered, having one more spare part meant one more possibility of repairing other equipment. This was crucial for the Planning Commission, whose electronic and electrical equipment was constantly decreasing due to damage.
