# Chapter 1964 - Exam Assessment

"A separate fiscal revenue account?" Wang Qiyi understood immediately. Indeed, without being a fiscal entity, he, Ai Zhixin, was merely a petty official passing orders up and down. The so-called "Finance and Tax Bureau" was just a dispatched execution unit of Wudaokou, with extremely little room for maneuvering.

"Correct. And the last State Council bulletin stated we need to establish and improve fiscal systems at all levels. With our current Hainan model, localities can't be counted as fiscal entities at all—they can only be viewed as dispatched agencies of the central government. Going to Guangdong, with local tax revenue so large and being so far from Lingao, we can't possibly collect everything to Lingao and then return it to the Guangdong government upon application."

In fact, many issues in this regard were already entangled between Guangzhou and the central government in Lingao. Due to insufficient cadres, the Executive Committee had to follow an extreme "better troops and simpler administration" model. The Guangdong Region and Guangzhou Municipal Government shared the same team for many departments, the drawbacks of which were self-evident. There were many "unjustifiable" aspects involved, and there were actually no clear regulations on how to divide and use the collected tax. The Finance Province had been muddling through until now using the "fiscal rebate" method.

"Don't be in a hurry about this first..." Wang Qiyi suddenly realized that continuing this discussion would involve more than just finance and economics matters. Financial power, administrative power, and organizational power were the core powers of a government; controlling these three basically meant controlling a level of government. Currently, neither the Transmigrator Assembly nor the State Council had clear statements on the authority positioning of governments at various levels. Rashly getting involved and standing on the wrong side wouldn't yield good results, even under the banner of "purely technical discussion."

He thought for a moment and said, "Director Ai, I think establishing fiscal revenue accounts at each level is acceptable, but don't say so much. Just say it's for the convenience of calculating fiscal costs and preparing budgets in the future. You can explain it clearly when you report to Director Cheng; he'll definitely understand. Let him help provide cover and limit the scope of this matter to within our finance and economics circle."

"Aren't you being too cautious..." Ai Zhixin shook his head. "Improving the fiscal system is one of the national policies determined at the government affairs meeting, published in full to all transmigrators and high-level naturalized citizen cadres. There's nothing to avoid."

"Ideally so." Wang Qiyi shook his head and took a document out of his briefcase.

The plan modified by the Wang couple faced no questions; Ai Zhixin basically agreed with their approach entirely. On one hand, because the two had long experience in the front lines of tax collection and management in the old timeline; on the other hand, as the head of the Finance and Tax Bureau, Ai Zhixin had too many things to comprehensively consider now that the department had just opened. Personnel accommodation, transmigrator security, workspaces, office expenses, internal systems, and coordination with other departments and Mayor Liu's side had tired him out so much he hadn't touched Ai Yixin for nearly half a month. Since the general direction was set by himself and Wang Qiyi and Zhang Xiaoqi had no objections, he would leave the specific work to them.

"A leader must know how to delegate power."

The next day, after Vice Director Wang's appointment and specific responsibilities were announced at the cadre meeting, Wang Qiyi officially took office. He wasted no time; the first thing he did upon taking over was to review the personnel files of the entire bureau.

Besides the students Ai Zhixin and Wang Qiyi brought from the Fangshaodi finance and tax training class in Hainan, the Finance and Tax Bureau's personnel composition was quite diverse. The ones most trusted and reused by transmigrators were naturally cadres of naturalized citizen origin, primarily those from the Northward Bound Detachment. Another part was similar to "White Area Party" origins—personnel from the original Guangzhou Station, mainly naturalized citizen staff from the "Wansheng Rental Agency" who collected "reasonable burdens." These two parts, along with the students newly brought from Hainan, were the most trusted by transmigrators and had the highest professional quality.

Then there were the retained personnel. Numerous and heterogeneous. After months of elimination and purging, quite a few still remained. Although Ai Zhixin didn't trust them, considering they were familiar with local conditions and there was a severe shortage of operational cadres, he could only continue to employ them.

Finally, there were the "civil servants" whom both Ai Zhixin and Wang Qiyi felt were useless. This group was recruited through the first Guangzhou Civil Service Exam. Although they had undergone a phase of "civil servant basic training," they had neither professional knowledge nor any experience to utilize—they were complete "blank sheets."

Wang Qiyi decided to take them "all in one pot" and first organize a professional exam.

The exam papers had been written and printed by Wang Qiyi before coming to Guangzhou. To find an exam hall that could accommodate over a hundred people, he specially applied to Liu Xiang to borrow the Guangzhou Cadre Training School currently under construction.

The exam provided no preparation materials, nor did it explain the scope of the exam; everyone was simply told to attend on time. Although there were "divergent opinions" about the Chief's whim, not going was obviously not an option—as they say, it's a slash whether you extend your head or shrink it, so verify and take the exam first.

The exam results were not published, nor did anyone lose their job or get punished because of it, but it caused quite a stir among the Finance and Tax Bureau staff. No one knew what medicine the Chief was selling in his gourd.

The reaction among naturalized citizens was smaller; under the Executive Committee's rule, exams were required for everything, so they weren't unfamiliar. But for the old clerks retained in Guangzhou, it was different. They were veterans at collecting taxes; although the rules and regulations of the new "Chiefs" were written in new terms, they could understand seventy or eighty percent of it after pondering. A few days ago, Chief Ai had even told them to put down their burdens and work hard. They thought that since they could still wear this skin and hold this rice bowl, it was already huge luck, so naturally they had to work well and "serve the Executive Committee and the people." But now this new Director Wang came up and wanted a "school exam." They didn't intend to get an academic degree nor were they soldiers. Why did people holding this bowl and doing this job need to take an exam? As for the newly minted civil servants, it was a "complete defeat." Many either handed in blank papers or wrote unintelligible archaic prose. Therefore, the ones most anxious and uneasy were actually this group. They were terrified of failing the exam and being "dismissed."

Actually, Wang Qiyi's purpose wasn't to "test" but to assess the situation. The papers didn't contain much modern tax law knowledge but used many simple cases to assess the examinees' familiarity with tax business. As the saying goes, change remains the same at its core. Unlike the "black tech" of the industrial and technology sectors, taxation—regardless of how clothes change over thousands of years—is centrally about those same few things.

Through the exam, it could be seen that some retained old clerks were actually higher in overall level than naturalized citizens. Their thinking was clear and alterations were few. For several questions, the old clerks could actually give direct answers. If not for the separate seating arrangement, Wang Qiyi would have suspected them of cheating. In contrast, the naturalized citizens' accuracy rate was lower than the old clerks, but basically everyone could analyze and solve problems according to the steps taught in basic courses. Each case had step-by-step explanations, formulas, results, and conclusions without missing any. Even if the final calculation was wrong, this methodical, rigid way of doing problems and things was very important.

That most newly assigned civil servants handed in blank papers was also within his expectations, but a few individuals left a deep impression on him. Because some exam questions involved macro finance, taxation, and monopoly, they could say something about it, obviously having read books in this area.

Land tax, salt administration, grain transport, and river works belonged to "practical affairs." Although the imperial examination didn't pay attention to "policy essays" involving this part, those intent on an official career still had to study them. It was just that among this batch of civil servants, there were very few Xiu Cai degree holders. Most were low-level scholars still struggling at the Tong Sheng level and children of small industrial and commercial families. They couldn't even write Bagu essays fluently, and their economic ability was generally low, so they couldn't afford these books and naturally didn't know much about this area.

With a baseline in hand, he knew what to do. Wang Qiyi decided to bring about some ideological transformation for these people, especially the retained old clerks who had defected. As for how to transform them, Wang Qiyi had an idea long before coming, which was learning.

Learning was both learning tax knowledge and learning tax collection processes; understanding the processes meant these people understood the rules—the Executive Committee's rules. Understanding the rules and having knowledge meant truly understanding the Executive Committee's taxation. Wang Qiyi believed that a person who understood why every cent of tax was collected and how it was collected would consciously and thoroughly abandon all old habits to become a qualified Great Song tax worker. Yes, he didn't expect them to be loyal to us from their hearts, but as long as they could become qualified tax cadres, that was enough.

Subsequently, the Guangzhou Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau issued Document No. 1 of 1635 based on Wang Qiyi's suggestion. This document, which seemed ordinary to Wang Qiyi, became one of the basic systems of the finance and tax system in the days to come. No matter how system slogans and purposes changed over the years, "learning" always ranked first. What Wang Qiyi expected even less was that because of this, he was revered by some later scholars as the first person to "create a learning-oriented government."

The basic learning materials were the *Provisional Norms for Tax Collection and Management of the National Finance and Tax System* and the *Taxation Work Manual*, compiled by Wang Qiyi and Zhang Xiaoqi in their spare time after D-Day, based on the implementation rules of the tax collection and management law of the old timeline and combined with the reality of this timeline. This norm classified items and simply and clearly listed the policy basis for daily tax work one by one, clarified method paths, pointed out matters needing attention, provided law enforcement references, and standardized tax collection and management behaviors, posts, responsibilities, processes, and standards. It was very suitable for the current cultural knowledge level of naturalized citizens. Wang Qiyi planned to open a training class during the two and a half hours from 18:30 to 21:00 every day after work, rotating training for all business personnel of the Guangzhou Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau according to the standard of 40 people per session. Personnel not in rotation training on the day would all conduct self-study.
