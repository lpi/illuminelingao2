# Chapter 2062 - Mi Xiang Ju

Nan Wan'er naturally understood her elder sister's feelings. She pushed away the bowl in front of her, poured herself another cup of tea, and took a slow sip.

Though the restaurant they had chosen was small, small did not mean crude. On the contrary, it was quite ingeniously arranged. It was called **Mi Xiang Ju**—literally, "Rice Fragrance Residence." It was not one of Guangzhou's old establishments, but rather one that had opened within the past six months.

Unusually for a restaurant, it was run entirely by women. From management to service staff, from head cook to scullion, every single person was female. Although this configuration was not unheard of in Guangzhou, it was exceptional for restaurants—neither tea houses, wine shops, nor brothels—to do so.

For women to enter the catering trade had been essentially taboo: who had ever heard of a woman working as a chef, server, or even restaurant manager?

But this Mi Xiang Ju did precisely that. The result? After opening, its business had not merely been "passable"—it had been unexpectedly good. At the very least, it had begun to turn a profit after less than six months.

There were, of course, reasons for this success. First, Guangzhou now had many more wage-earning women than before, and these working women increasingly needed a place outside their homes to eat, just as men did. Second, under Australian rule, Guangzhou had become markedly safer and more orderly—even at night, women faced little harassment.

On the other hand, traditional restaurants and tea houses still catered heavily to men, and even women who could afford to dine out rarely did, finding the experience uncomfortable with so many male patrons about. Apart from certain "improper" establishments that served both male and female clientele, reputable restaurants saw very few women. For ladies of status or respectability, going to such restaurants was simply out of the question.

Mi Xiang Ju was founded precisely to fill this gap. Its furnishings and dishes were all designed with female customers in mind. Its most distinctive rule was simplicity itself: it never admitted male patrons, unless they were accompanying a female guest. And even then, men could only enter if accompanied by a woman of their own.

As a result, many women from respectable families who wanted to dine out—whether widows, young spinsters, or simply ladies of status—frequented Mi Xiang Ju. Visiting a pleasant restaurant like this brought them no ill rumors, and Mi Xiang Ju quickly developed a thriving trade.

For Zeng Juan, this restaurant was ideally suited to conversations she wished to keep private. Here, the secluded booths ensured nobody would eavesdrop on what two women discussed. And naturally, there was no risk of encountering awkward male acquaintances.

Zeng Juan took a small sip from a bottle of Gervas, savoring its taste. She found this beverage quite agreeable—sweet, cool, refreshing, and subtly effervescent. It seemed tailor-made for women. She could not fathom why men would prefer it less, though it had indeed become fashionable among the menfolk of Guangzhou ever since the Australians had taken hold.

But lately, drinking Gervas had acquired a new meaning: people now called it "praising the Australians" or "praising the hairless ones," implying acceptance of Australian rule. Naturally, many who disliked the Australians boycotted it. Conversely, sipping Gervas in public had become a subtle way of signaling political loyalty.

For their part, Zeng Juan and Nan Wan'er barely concerned themselves with such nuances.

"Sister Zeng," Nan Wan'er said quietly after a pause, "do you think there will truly be war again?"

Zeng Juan put down her cup and shook her head. "I don't know. Such matters are for the higher-ups to decide. What can we ordinary folk know?"

"But if there *is* another war... what will happen to us?"

Zeng Juan smiled thinly. "What else could happen? For people like us, the only thing left is to try and hold on to what we have. As long as we aren't crushed underfoot by some giant's careless step."

"But this time—" Nan Wan'er hesitated. "The Australians have it well in hand, don't they? I've heard the Ming court's army is no match for them."

"That's certainly what everyone says." Zeng Juan picked up a candied date from the plate and nibbled on it. "But who really knows until the dust settles?"

They both fell silent. Outside the window, distant street sounds filtered in: vendors hawking their wares, the rumble of carriage wheels, the occasional shout of a stevedore or servant. All the familiar, mundane, reassuring commotion of a city at peace.

*At peace...*

How long would it last?

Zeng Juan let her gaze linger on the window shutters, painted in fashionable Australian colors.

"More Gervas?" Nan Wan'er offered.

Zeng Juan nodded absently. "Why not? It's better than worrying ourselves to death."
