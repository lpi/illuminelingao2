# Chapter 1798 - The Merchants' Thoughts

"Whether we exchange or accept, it doesn't matter; high or low fineness, it's always silver. If the common people recognize it, it can be considered a good deed benefiting the country and the people. If the common people don't recognize it, that can't be blamed on us," Gao Ju said.

"But this fineness..."

"Fineness is easy to discuss. Our silver isn't full fine silver either. As for the common people's silver, that has never been sufficient in color. Only this money that cannot enter the crucible needs to be considered." As Gao Ju spoke, he patted the wooden box at his hand. It was an extremely exquisite raw wood grain joinery box, flat and level, exactly what the Australians issued to hold "money samples."

Everyone naturally understood what Master Gao was talking about: the "Australian Precious Notes."

Precious notes, money tickets, money posts—these things were not unfamiliar to Chinese merchants. The Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties all had fairly mature paper currency issuing systems handed down in one continuous line. Especially the paper currency issuance and circulation of the Southern Song Dynasty could be called a miracle in Chinese financial history—the Southern Song supported tribute payments and war expenses for over a hundred years with half the country, demonstrating consummate skill in the use of fiscal and financial means. By the Yuan Dynasty, paper currency was simply used as the basic circulating currency.

At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the currency laws collapsed, and paper currency was extremely devalued and ruined, but its influence and credit among the people still remained. After Zhu Yuanzhang took the throne, he banned the circulation of copper coins and fully restored the use of paper currency without encountering too much resistance. In the final analysis, the common people were not unfamiliar with the thing called paper money. Zhu Yuanzhang's decision to use paper currency was naturally related to his own experience as a commoner of the Yuan Dynasty. In his view, this was a very normal thing.

The Great Ming Treasure Notes had no reserve fund—this wasn't too big of a problem. Paper currency was guaranteed by the government's authority, as long as it could ensure that the paper currency was accepted by the market and circulated. At the same time, keeping the speed and magnitude of devaluation within a certain degree was not unacceptable. One should know that throughout the Republic of China era, over a hundred types of paper currency circulated on the land of China. Most couldn't be said to have reserve funds, nor was their currency value very stable, yet they still circulated for quite a few years.

However, in the era when the Great Ming Treasure Notes were born, the Ming government neither had effective grassroots administrative capabilities nor was directly exposed to a comprehensive penetration of the market economy in rural areas like the late Qing and Republic of China. Furthermore, Zhu Yuanzhang's incorrect understanding of treasure notes made the government view paper currency as a means of accumulating wealth "out of nothing." Zhu Yuanzhang's one-time reward of 300,000 *guan* in ultra-large denomination notes to Zhu Di demonstrated his ignorance of paper currency policy. Not to mention that printing large amounts of banknotes indiscriminately caused extreme inflation, the government adopted discriminatory policies towards its own issued "legal tender." Except for a few limited tax custom stations in the whole country, it couldn't be used to pay taxes anywhere. This strange policy was equivalent to the issuer declaring no confidence in the value of the notes issued—this was probably unique in currency issuance.

Self-discrimination coupled with unrestrained indiscriminate issuance caused the Great Ming Treasure Notes to continuously devalue and shrink in the market, finally forcing them to withdraw from the circulation market. Aside from leaving a notorious reputation of "inventing clever names to compete for profit with the people," they left nothing positive. Although some literati notes claimed that the Great Ming Treasure Notes were overthrown in a short time by merchants "striking" out of distrust for paper currency, in reality, they barely managed to circulate until the Zhengde era, although by this time their value and scope of circulation were negligible.

Most of the merchants gathered in this shop hall hadn't seen treasure notes circulate, but they had more or less heard their ancestors speak of them. Now hearing Gao Ju mention "Australian Circulation Notes," everyone's hearts involuntarily lifted—compared to the Australian silver dollars, their concern for this paper money went up a level.

After treasure notes withdrew from the market, similar money posts, silver tickets, bills of exchange used by foreign merchants, and even money chips in the Jiangnan area—these people had seen more or less all of them. However, these things were mostly autonomous in the nature of checks and drafts.

They had all seen the new circulation notes. Compared to the old circulation notes they had seen in the past, the notes were slightly larger, but much smaller than the money posts and silver tickets on the market. The old circulation notes were already very exquisite, and now the new ones were even more so. The paper was crisp and substantial, giving an indescribable pleasure when touched between the fingers.

Compared to the silver dollars which only had three denominations, there were more types of paper money. Not only were there silver dollar redemption notes of three equal values, but there were also several kinds of small-denomination subsidiary coin notes. Each had patterns and was extremely exquisite.

How to convert had already been explained at the meeting, and there were detailed illustrated instruction manuals in the coin sample boxes. As long as one was literate, one wouldn't fail to understand. Moreover, the Australian currency conversion was very simple, just a decimal system.

"This banknote is extremely strong and solid; I wonder what paper it is."

"It's probably mulberry bark paper," someone said.

"How can mulberry bark paper be made so smooth and flat?"

...

"Don't argue; only the Australians can make this paper. This is their secret technique," Old Huo, the head of the paper guild, whispered. The paper trade was the industry hit earliest by Australian goods and subsequently controlled most strictly. In the early years, massive amounts of Australian paper from Lingao were dumped in Guangzhou, from high-end to low-end, forcing all the paper workshops in Guangzhou Prefecture, big and small, to close down. Only the distribution channels for selling paper were kept alive because the Australians needed distribution. Now, apart from selling some special paper from other places, most of the paper guild's goods were imported from the Hong Kong Cooperative branch.

Aside from the paper, the patterns and designs on it were a hundred times more complex than the old circulation notes of the past. The merchants present knew the key here: the best woodblock carvers in the entire Guangdong market couldn't make such plates—even if one found the Ministry of Works artisans in the capital who carved and printed various official documents and titles for the Six Ministries, they wouldn't have this skill.

"So, these circulation notes cannot be forged," someone said.

"Precisely so," Liang Chenlong, the head of the Money Industry Guild, said slowly. The Money Industry Guild was the first to bear the brunt of this currency reform. Before coming to Jufeng Bank, the thirteen large and small peers in the money industry had already held a closed-door meeting to discuss countermeasures. There were many discussions at the meeting, but no countermeasure was ever agreed upon, so they had to "wait and see the wind direction first." In fact, their industry peers knew the benefits of the Australians issuing new money at a glance.

"Electronic are all businessmen, dealing with silver and copper coins all day. For the money received every day, we inevitably have to check the fineness of the silver and identify good and bad coins. Even so, we often receive damp silver and rotten coins."

Everyone nodded. The energy shops spent on identifying silver and money was indeed not small. Silver had to be checked for color and weighed; copper coins also had to be checked for copper quality and weight. This inevitably involved some arguing with customers. If they met a customer who was hard to deal with, there would be a famine to fight. There were even some villains and rascals who specialized in using rotten silver, inferior coins, and private coins to "crash shops" and buy things. If one missed it and accepted them, it was fine, but if one pointed it out, they would immediately make a scene at the shop entrance, and the shop would inevitably have to spend money to avoid disaster.

Even with such caution, inventory would always reveal some lead ingots, rotten damp silver, and crab-eye sand-shell small coins. When sending the broken silver to the smelting shop to cast into ingots, one had to waste breath with the smelting shop over the fineness again. In short, it was indescribably troublesome.

"Now that the Australians' silver dollars are out, no matter the fineness, one dollar is one dollar, half a dollar is half a dollar. As long as it's not lacking or short, everyone has to recognize it. This is the benefit. If it can be promoted, it will be a huge benefit to the common people and us merchants," Liang Chenlong said. "However, the Australians also have precious notes; this is worrying."

"Let's not talk about the small-denomination subsidiary coin notes," Liang Chenlong said. "Nowadays copper coins are insufficient, and most of what circulates are inferior coins privately or officially minted, which aren't much better than these paper tickets. Using paper tickets is even more trouble-free. It's just these silver dollar circulation notes..."

As he spoke, a look of worry appeared on his face. His hesitant attitude immediately hooked everyone's worries.

Banknotes and silver dollars circulating at equal value was not a rare thing for Ming merchants. Ever since paper currency circulated in China, paper currency was theoretically equal in value to copper coins. Whether it was the *Jiaozi* of the Song Dynasty or the *Baochao* of the Great Ming, the face values were "wen" and "guan." But in actual use, the "wen" and "guan" of paper notes never matched up with copper coins. Buying a few bowls of muddy wine with treasure notes of dozens or hundreds of *guan* face value was a common occurrence in the Ming Dynasty.

But now the circulation notes corresponded not to copper coins, but to genuine silver. And they had to circulate and exchange at equal value. The merchants naturally had worries. First, did the Australians have so many silver dollars for equal exchange? Anyone with a slight understanding of finance would inevitably consider this issue. Although Ming merchants didn't understand financial science, they still knew the concept of over-issuance. Take the various "shop tickets"—which were modern shopping vouchers—issued by various shops; they were often over-issued. If someone collected them all to redeem, many shops would immediately be bankrupted by the run.

This was secondary. What the merchants worried about more was that the Australians had no intention of guaranteeing the currency value at all: would they dump a large amount of circulation notes to purchase all the silver in the market, leaving a pile of paper money to devalue? Although they hadn't personally experienced this routine, they had heard of it from old legends. The Yuan Dynasty gathered up the gold and silver of the Central Plains in this way back then.

In the final analysis, no matter how well printed, a circulation note was just a piece of paper; how could it be as reliable as real gold and silver! Even yellow and shiny good copper coins felt more reliable in hand than this beautiful patterned paper.

"If only silver dollars were circulated and not silver dollar notes, this would be a great benevolent government. Our peers, large and small, would inevitably work together to handle the task," Liang Chenlong stroked his beard and said. "As for these subsidiary coin notes, small coins are scarce in the market, so using them alongside copper coins is no harm."

Everyone understood his meaning. This sentence from the Money Industry Guild set the tone for the meeting. Everyone's eyes turned to Gao Ju.
