# Chapter 1839 - New Opportunity

"China Current Affairs Section, Item One—"

In the small teahouse, Zeng Juan held a newspaper and read aloud. Dozens of tea guests around him listened intently.

This job of reading newspapers in the teahouse had come to him through Zhang Yu. Ever since Zhang Yu's family obtained a loan to expand their business, he no longer had time for such work—nor did he care for the modest income anymore. So he had recommended Zeng Juan. Reading newspapers required not merely literacy but also familiarity with the countless "news vocabulary" coined by the Australians. Ordinary scholars could read the characters but remained ignorant of the meaning. This work had to be done by someone "versed in Australian affairs."

In the past, he had read nothing more than storybook novels and legends of the strange from Australian publications. But since the Australians occupied Guangzhou, more and more people had developed strong interest in this freshly minted "Great Song" and paid close attention to Australian administrative measures—after all, their various actions in the city were intimately connected to the lives of the broad masses of citizens.

People like Zeng Juan had become very popular. Not only did ordinary petty citizens view him with new respect, but even some wealthy households in the vicinity were quite polite when they saw him. Some even brought newspapers and copied announcements, asking him to explain the content of the articles.

"The bandit leader Li Zicheng's unit, which participated in breaking Fengyang, excavating the Ming Imperial Family's ancestral graves, and burning the Huangjue Temple where Zhu Yuanzhang once became a monk at the beginning of the year, is confirmed to have invaded the Guanzhong Plain this month. Ming Commander Hong Chengchou fought multiple battles with this unit but failed to achieve decisive victory. This paper's observer believes the Li Zicheng unit is likely maneuvering toward Xianyang and attempting to besiege Xianyang City..."

"Because some bandit forces have moved toward the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal area, the Ming Court, worried that canal grain transport would be destroyed by bandits, has officially issued a document ordering all grain transport from Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions this year to be concentrated in Shanghai County and then transported by sea to Tianjin Wei..."

"International Current Affairs Section, Item One..."

"The British merchant ship that entered Macau this month brought unexpected news. In mid-April this year, the British East India Company reached an agreement with the Portuguese Governor of Goa in India. The Portuguese side promised British merchant ships could enter and leave freely, enjoying the same treatment as Portuguese merchant ships regarding taxation and material supply; simultaneously, the British East India Company promised to sell military supplies such as gunpowder to the Portuguese colonies in Goa, Ceylon, and other Indian regions, and to transport Australian-Song produced arms stored by Portugal in Macau... This paper's observer believes the colonial struggle between the Netherlands and Portugal in India, Borneo, and the Lombok Islands will grow more intense by the day, while the Spanish Kingdom government, which nominally rules Portugal, seems indifferent. Britain's move fully illustrates its dissatisfaction with Netherlands' actions in the Asian region..."

"The Joseon Li Dynasty, disregarding our Senate's repeated tolerance on the Jeju ownership issue and ignoring the fact that Jeju Island has been our territory since ancient times, recently dispatched ships and soldiers again to harass our Jeju territory. Our Jeju garrison dealt a head-on blow, completely eliminating the invading enemies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a solemn warning, hoping the Li Dynasty will not proceed further down the wrong path..."

"The recently risen legendary figure in Manila, Count Van Nanuowa, has recently commenced a business venture. He has demarcated a dedicated development zone on the southeast coast of Palawan Island. Can this 'gold digger' who once miraculously excavated gold mines in multiple locations reproduce his miracle? This paper specially interviewed several Spanish captains currently resting in Macau..."

"Great Song Liberated Area Current Affairs Highlights, Item One..."

"The main body of the first clipper trade vessel has been completed at Hong Kong Shipyard and can enter the outfitting stage late this month. This ship will soon be put into service on trade routes between the Great Song and Europe."

"Yesterday, the 8th Vocational Skills Grading Examination concluded successfully. Examination results will be posted for public notice late this month. Trades involved in this exam include fitter, turner, electrician... The 9th Vocational Skills Grading Examination will be held in October this year. It is reported that for the first time, this exam will establish three new test centers—in Jeju, Kaohsiung, and Guangzhou—in addition to Lingao and Sanya in Hainan Province, to facilitate local personnel taking the examination..."

"This month, the Sanya Telegraph Exchange General Station was completed, marking the full completion of the Hainan province-wide round-island telegraph project. Telegraph transmission and reception tests will be conducted in the near future. After being put into operation, messages from the ends of the earth can be transmitted to Lingao and Haikou in just a few minutes..."

"Good news from the Jeju Island State-run Horse Farm: All foals born in this batch have survived."

...

"Local Highlights, Item One..."

"Mayor Liu inspected the renovation site of the former Examination Hall today. After renovation, this place will serve as the Guangzhou Municipal School of Administration, responsible for training and continuing education of cadres in Guangzhou and the entire Guangdong province..."

"Several more suspects in the Mao Family Inn Mass Murder Case have been apprehended. The Police Bureau stated that some suspects remain at large. The broad masses are urged to heighten vigilance, pay attention at all times to suspicious persons and events in their vicinity, and report promptly to the local *paijia* headman or nearest police station. The police will give certain rewards to those who provide useful information leading to capture of suspects..."

After Dingding arrived in Guangzhou, the layout of the *Yangcheng Express* had expanded significantly, adding multiple sections such as international, domestic, and cultural life. Of course, most content was still reprinted from the *Lingao Times*, but certain effort had also been devoted to gathering and editing local news.

Because this newspaper not only covered various orders and policies of the Senate in Guangzhou but was also rich and colorful in content—beloved by the people and bringing entertainment to the impoverished lives of citizens—its influence spread easily.

Though the current affairs sections weren't numerous, they contained quite a lot of news. Zeng Juan read them out one by one, taking a full hour.

His mouth had gone dry from reading, yet many people still had questions for him to explain.

"Ajuan, what is this telegraph thing? How can it transmit letters?"

"Where is this Jeju Island? Why do Koreans want to fight with us?"

"The civil service exam—that's the imperial examination opened by the Australians, isn't it?"

...

Zeng Juan explained them one by one. For some he didn't know himself, he had to improvise answers to satisfy them. But what everyone was most interested in remained the Mao Family Inn case.

"Is there any follow-up on the Mao Family Inn case besides arresting escaped criminals?"

Zeng Juan shook his head. "No new news today."

Since the Mao Family Inn case occurred, it had become the topic of gossip for Guangzhou citizens over tea and meals. The case summary serialized in the newspaper had become the news tea guests paid most attention to recently.

Seeing everyone seemed somewhat disappointed and had no new questions, he announced:

"Today's domestic and foreign current affairs sections are done. I'm going to rest for one *shichen*—that's two hours—then read the life section." Zeng Juan wiped the sweat from his forehead and drank a bowl of Chen Liji's herbal tea in large gulps. Ignoring the noisy circle of listeners around him, he walked straight to the back hall. Picking up a palm-leaf fan, he fanned himself properly for a few minutes to compose himself. Wasting no more time, he took out a "Public Basic Knowledge Manual" from the drawer and began reviewing.

"Ajuan! You're here after all!"

While Zeng Juan was rocking his head back and forth, memorizing by rote, a familiar voice interrupted him. He looked up and saw his classmate and good friend Zhang Yu, carrying a food box.

"Ayu, you came to deliver tea snacks again? It's too extravagant! Don't send any more—your family is operating on a small capital after all..."

"Spirit runs high when happy events occur," Zhang Yu said with a smile. "Take this to Ayu's later and let Mingnu taste it—you must be tired of walnut cakes. What I'm sending now is a new creation." Zhang Yu deliberately stopped halfway, whetting Zeng Juan's appetite.

Zeng Juan didn't show any greedy expression but sighed: "It's all thanks to Brother Ziyu this time!" At these words, his eyes immediately reddened. A few days ago, Li Ziyu had sent someone to say Mingnu had been found. He had run all the way to Li Ziyu's house, held Mingnu, and wept bitterly—he had never realized how deep his feelings were for this niece. The Australian books said: *You only know what is most precious after losing it.* In that moment, he had felt this truth unforgettably.

Beyond gratitude and happiness, Zeng Juan felt secretly ashamed. He was a seven-foot man who had read books and understood reason. Yet in a matter concerning his closest kin, he had been completely powerless. If Li Ziyu hadn't exhausted his full effort, Mingnu would most likely never have been found.

No matter what, he must pass the Australian civil service exam so that he might have a chance to repay Li Ziyu's kindness in the future. Because of this resolve, he had become increasingly "diligent" these past few days, bringing review materials even when coming out to earn money.

"Ayu is truly loyal!" Zhang Yu said. "There's another happy event. I received a letter from Shixin yesterday!"

"Oh?!" Now Zeng Juan's eyes widened. Guangzhou had still been the Great Ming's when Chen Shixin went to Lingao. "How is he in Lingao?"

"He said in the letter that after arriving in Lingao, through Chief Hong's recommendation, he's now learning painting with a Westerner. No tuition needed, and the Australians even provide him living expenses. Life is quite good. The Australians said they need people who can paint very much. Once he completes the training, he'll naturally have rice to eat. He told us not to worry. He'll return to Guangzhou recently to visit his parents, and we'll gather then."

"I never expected Shixin to prosper as well." Zeng Juan was happy for his friend, yet a strong sense of anxiety and unease about his own "mediocrity" until now rose within him.

Market rumors said: *When China prospers, the Senators are imperial.* The arrival of the Australians had brought many opportunities. His friends had seized them one by one, yet he still had nothing...

"When he comes back, we must gather properly and drink deeply!" Zhang Yu, immersed in yearning for a beautiful future, hummed the latest Australian ditty: "Today is a good day..."

Zeng Juan wasn't as carefree as him. He had other thoughts: with only two hours of rest time, he needed to hurry and memorize. Turning his head, he resumed reading a paragraph and memorizing a paragraph.
