# Chapter 1966 - An Auspicious Start

Guangzhou in spring was warm and bright; even in the early morning of the Little Ice Age, Zhang Xiaoqi didn't feel a trace of the late spring chill she would have felt in her hometown. She was currently strolling behind the window counters of the Guangzhou Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau's tax collection hall, carrying a cleaning rag. Her navy blue uniform was crisp and well-fitted, the metal tax emblem shining on her chest. The neat desks and the stacks of tax receipts placed in position—everything before her eyes gave Zhang Xiaoqi a feeling of returning to the hall in the old timeline where she had worked for over a decade, causing a momentary trance. Outside the windows were girls mopping the floor—more accurately, the tax cadres of the Australian Song Guangzhou Special Municipality Finance and Tax Bureau's Tax Collection Hall. The entire hall had been thoroughly cleaned last night; this morning was just routine, but the girls still meticulously cleaned every nook and cranny again. The main doors were already open, the glass on them clear as if non-existent, and the "Tax Guide Desk" facing the entrance was wiped spotless.

Mm, today must be a good day for opening. Zhang Xiaoqi looked out the door with confidence. Outside the iron railings below the steps stood a crowd of "tax payment activists." Ai Zhixin had originally planned to conduct a "tax payment mobilization" for the Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce through the municipal government, mobilizing several large households to take the lead in paying taxes to drive the trend. Unexpectedly, as soon as this news got out, the old moneybags in the Federation "participated enthusiastically." It was said that several merchant princes fought tooth and nail over who could get the first Australian Song tax receipt, and even privately asked people to pull strings, all of whom Ai Zhixin dodged.

Unable to pull strings, they sent sharp, close servants along with accounting masters to queue up early to "cautiously report." Now these people consciously formed a semi-circle not far away, pointing at the girls mopping the floor on the steps.

It wasn't the first time an Australian new government office opened, and Australian female clerks and cadres were no longer rare in Guangzhou city; everyone had seen plenty of female constables too. But today this place was a bit peculiar. Everyone knew this "Finance and Tax Bureau" was just the Tax Office of the past, but the strange thing was hearing that the collectors in this Australian Tax Office were all young women in their prime—dozens in one room without a single man, and even the leader was an Australian woman! Rumors ran wild that any woman coming from the Australians, no matter how unlike a human or ghost she was before, would transform into a top-beauty after being trained by the Australians. Now with so many Australian-flavored women to see all at once, quite a few idlers and loafers in the city mixed into the crowd to watch the western peep show.

 Seeing these girls busy on the steps, each with bright eyes and white teeth, their clothes tight against their bodies showing off exquisite curves... some had two braids, others wore their hair in a bun behind their heads without a stray hair, and some simply cut their hair short—adding a flavor of capability and sharpness. Truly a different Australian flavor.

Hearing the clicking of tongues getting louder, Zhang Xiaoqi frowned and walked out, thinking: *How come these Ming locals have the same virtue as the Lingao crudes? The girls today are wearing long sleeves and long pants, wrapped up tight—it's not miniskirts and tank tops, what are they clicking about?* Standing at the door and following the gazes of several men with shining eyes, Zhang Xiaoqi realized she had overlooked a major problem. Previously only thinking of guarding against Ai Zhixin's dirty mind of changing long skirts to short skirts, she forgot that compared to the pleated skirts used by the military and police systems, these extremely well-tailored long pants her subordinates wore were even more tempting to the Great Ming locals. Now those men's eyes were constantly wandering over the waists and hips of the girls mopping the floor...

Women in this timeline, even laboring women, didn't go out wearing only pants—even when farm women went to the fields, they wrapped a short "work skirt" around their waists. Taking off the skirt and wearing only pants was attire reserved for the boudoir. for the common people of this timeline, the scene before them was no less than "No Pants Day" in the old timeline.

Forget it! This counts as setting a trend. Zhang Xiaoqi steeled her heart—better than letting Ai Zhixin change it to short skirts exposing thighs in a few years.

During her "patient guidance" of Nan Wan'er over the past few days, she hadn't discovered any "improper" moves by Ai Zhixin. However, with her woman's intuition, she was certain Ai Zhixin had designs on Nan Wan'er.

Originally this wasn't her business either. Leaving Ai Zhixin aside, within Wudaokou, male transmigrators hooking up with female clerks happened from time to time. She just scoffed at it when she heard, at most tightening the educational work on Wang Qiyi at night.

But Nan Wan'er alone held an indescribable affection for her. She was always worried about her being hogged by some crude fellow... especially this slick Ai Zhixin. He already had two or three cute girls by his side, yet was still targeting Nan Wan'er!

"Chief, cleaning is done. Should we open the doors?" Nan Wan'er came over to report.

Zhang Xiaoqi looked at her watch: "A few minutes left, no rush. Open the doors on time. Gather everyone; I have a few words to say."

In a moment, the tax collectors gathered around her.

"Today is our first official day of collection," Zhang Xiaoqi's gaze swept over the female tax collectors with flushed cheeks. "What should be taught has all been taught. Processing tax isn't hard, just firmly remember 'act according to regulations' and 'be meticulous as hair'!"

The girls nodded together.

"You must remember at all times, when you collect tax here, you represent the Executive Committee, represent the government. You are 'gathering wealth for the state.' No one is allowed to question or negate your decisions. What you say goes. Understood?"

"Understood!"

"Similarly, remember to always act according to regulations—regardless of whether you think the regulation is reasonable, that is not for you to consider. Our work is very serious and allows for no omissions or favors."

After finishing, Zhang Xiaoqi instructed: "Open the doors!"

"Hiss... this woman, truly skin like white snow!"

"Eyes so big, so deep, must be a Colored-Eye person..."

"Shut up quickly you condemnables, this is a real Australian Chief. Watch out or trouble comes from the mouth!"

Zhang Xiaoqi's appearance caused another stir in the crowd; many stood on stools and folding chairs to see what a genuine Australian woman looked like.

Today's matter shouldn't have required him to come out personally. In the past, which of those tax runners and clerks dared to come bother him? A few coins from his subordinates would have sent them away.

He knew the Master's meaning: *To curry favor with the Australians, one must cater to their actions in everything. Now that these Australians are vying for the Central Plains, it's only a matter of willingness, not ability. Since Guangzhou opened its gates, the Master has fawned over the Australians increasingly. But the Australians don't have the attitude of relying on the Master as a backer or arm like in the past. Although they give enough face in the Federation of Industry and Commerce, they treat him as merely a merchant of their own—this makes the Master very disappointed.*

This time, Master Gao not only made him queue early to occupy a spot but also sent Advisor Xu along, just to be absolutely safe. Rushing to pay taxes to the government like this—Yan Xiaomao had truly never seen such a thing.

Seeing this "hall" square and upright like a box, Steward Yan somehow thought of a coffin. On the way here, Advisor Xu had been muttering about the heavy yin energy from a room full of women, making his mood even worse.

Just as he was thinking, a squad of soldiers and police ran up carrying barriers and cloth strips, setting up the small barriers one by one on the ground and connecting them with cloth strips all the way to the main door on the steps. Steward Yan's brain spun and he immediately understood why. Australians liked queueing and liked making others queue; they probably felt there were many people and made a channel for everyone to queue. So he lifted his butt, grabbed Advisor Xu who was still watching the excitement, and squeezed to the very center barrier opening. Yan Xiaomao guessed right—Ai Zhixin and Wang Qiyi had just come outside the hall, saw the crowd gathering more and more, containing many idle onlookers besides the merchants notified to pay tax today, and immediately coordinated a squad of National Army and a small team of patrol police to maintain order, setting up a preliminary check below the steps to isolate those watching the fun.

Just past 8:00 AM, with a whistle from the police, Steward Yan and Advisor Xu squeezed and shuffled along the channel separated by barriers and cloth strips toward the steps. He left the servants behind to look after the gear used for queueing. The Australians said no non-taxpayers allowed inside; Steward Yan, knowing their temperament well, naturally obeyed honestly. Fortunately, his sharp eyes and fast feet had grabbed the first spot, and the channel wasn't long, so walking wasn't too uncomfortable. Advisor Jiang from the neighboring channel wasn't so lucky; having brought too many servants, he was directly told to leave and queue again.

Walking up the steps and entering the main door, he was met by a half-height desk, tidied very neatly, with several stacks of documents large and small, the Four Treasures of the Study, and an Australian "fountain pen." Coming to think of it, these Australians were funny—the pen was clearly made of bamboo and wood but they insisted on calling it a "steel" pen—supposedly the tip was steel. The female clerk sitting behind the desk, however, was born with delicate features, her autumn-water eyes glancing about enchantingly—it was just that the grim official uniform on her body really spoiled the scenery, Yan Xiaomao secretly lamented. This female clerk—oh, should be called female cadre—spoke neither humbly nor arrogantly but very politely. After checking his documents, she pointed to a window behind her marked with Arabic numerals and told him to go queue there.
