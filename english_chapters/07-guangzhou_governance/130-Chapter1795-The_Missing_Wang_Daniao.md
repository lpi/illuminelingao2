# Chapter 1795 - The Missing Wang Daniao

"Perhaps... someone doesn't want us to know that Wang Daniao is already dead," Li Zhenguo said.

"In that case, cutting off the head makes sense, but why cut off his genitals?" Wu Xiang still couldn't understand.

"I think it likely has the same meaning as chopping off his head," Gao Chongjiu muttered to himself for a moment and said, "Captain Wu, do you know how the nickname Wang Daniao (Big Bird Wang) came about?"

It turned out this Wang Daniao was "endowed with extraordinary talent", his "instrument was magnificent", and he was extremely fond of women. Colleagues in the yamen then gave him such a nickname. Over time, it actually covered up his real name.

"I used to soak in the bathhouse with him, the size of his thing was indeed quite astonishing." A trace of wretched smile appeared on Gao Chongjiu's face, "This guy Wang Daniao is very lecherous, has several wives and concubines at home, and still messes around with women outside. He is quite famous in the yamen."

This statement made some sense. The criminal police decided to first confirm if the corpse was Wang Daniao's.

How to verify? When Wang Daniao fled, it was very hasty, only taking his son and wife. There were still a few female relatives left at home. Finding a few who had bedded Wang Daniao should be able to identify some characteristics.

Wu Xiang sent several police officers to the Wang family—although the Wang family hadn't been raided, they were under surveillance—and summoned all of Wang Daniao's concubines over.

After identification, it was confirmed that the headless corpse in South Scissors Alley was Wang Daniao!

Several items of clothing found at the scene were also identified by them as Wang Daniao's items.

In this way, the possibility that Li Zhenguo deduced—decapitation and castration were to cover up the victim's identity—increased greatly.

"After tossing and turning for three or four days, we finally stand at the starting point." Wu Xiang said with emotion.

Only by clarifying the victim's identity could the investigation work of the murder case be considered started.

With the case developing to this point, the police roughly sorted out the entire process of the crime.

The victim Wang Daniao had been hiding in Widow Wang's home for more than a month recently. During this period, the murderer frequently came to Widow Wang's home to meet him. This murderer came late and left early, staying overnight at the Wang house, with obvious intent to conceal his identity. Wang Daniao was in danger, yet still met with him frequently and let the murderer stay overnight, indicating the two not only knew each other but had an extraordinary relationship. The two were very likely secretly planning something.

For some reason, the murderer decided to kill Wang Daniao. The motive for killing was likely to seize a certain item. Wu Xiang believed the thing the murderer wanted was likely the "Drain Map".

For Wang Daniao, the most important thing was this Drain Map. When he fled from home, he didn't want gold, silver, or treasures, only taking this Drain Map. Because of its importance, the Drain Map was likely carried on his person.

However, based on existing clues, it remained unclear whether the murderer obtained the Drain Map.

In the process of killing Wang Daniao, Widow Wang played the role of an accomplice. Judging from Wang Xiuzhu participating in the corpse disposal work, she was likely not coerced, but originally in the same gang as the murderer. The murderer silencing her indicated Wang Xiuzhu likely grasped many important situations—at least she knew what the murderer and Wang Daniao were talking about.

After discussion, the special task force decided to start screening from the interpersonal relationships surrounding Wang Daniao, Wang Dong, and Wang Xiuzhu. At the same time, try to find Wang Dong's whereabouts—the task force believed Wang Dong likely had another residence in Guangzhou City. For a young man who loved enjoyment like him, he probably wouldn't be content to hibernate in a corner to pass his days. Finding him should be easier.

Liu Xiang put down the latest issue of "Public Security Brief" sent by Mu Min and said to Lin Baiguang: "It seems things are not simple."

Lin Baiguang nodded: "This is beyond doubt. Wang Daniao's case can be basically confirmed to have political factors." He unhurriedly stubbed out the cigarette in his hand, "Obviously, the murderer taking such great pains to dispose of a labor foreman doesn't make sense. And that Drain Map, it's structurally important, but useless to an individual."

"Correct. And this Zhuti Silver, also reveals strangeness." Liu Xiang was somewhat uneasy. Recently the municipal government was intensely preparing for the new currency issuance. The suddenly popping up Zhuti Silver made him somewhat restless.

"This, I'm afraid we can only know the reason after catching the murderer," Lin Baiguang said, "But you don't need to worry too much. This thing won't have too much impact on the new order of the financial market."

The amount of Zhuti Silver seized wasn't large, and the Great Library's reply was that Zhuti Silver didn't possess the possibility of large-scale inflow into Guangzhou. Even if it flowed in large scale, it didn't matter—Zhuti Silver contained nickel, which the industrial sector welcomed very much. If natives were willing to develop this trade, it should all be purchased.

"Ideally so." Liu Xiang said, frowning, "In my view, the work of clearing drains and dredging silt cannot be delayed any longer. We originally pinned out hopes on finding the Drain Map, now it seems the situation is a bit complex. With Wang Daniao dead, the whereabouts of the Drain Map become even more confusing. We start working now."

Lin Baiguang nodded: "Good. I'll go arrange it. Also, Lingao proposed they can provide some technical support."

"Having support is best, without it we still have to start quickly. It rained a few days ago, and urban waterlogging is quite severe. I went to see the flooded areas, drains don't drain, water bubbling out. The problem is not generally big. But manpower is still a bit insufficient."
 
Lin Baiguang smiled: "We now have preliminary grassroots organizations, we must use them. Lack of manpower doesn't matter. Call the Baojia to mobilize. One out of three males, all go to the construction site to open drains and clear silt."

"Mobilizing so many people, food is a big expense, plus tools..."

"We can start levying a cleaning fee, collected according to housing area and number of permanent residents. Levy extra pollution discharge fees on heavy pollution enterprises." Lin Baiguang said, "Guangzhou doesn't have a scavenger team yet, we can take this opportunity to establish one."

"Good guy, you levying household by household, where do we get so many tax collectors? If handed over to the police bureau to collect, the police will run their legs off."

"The cleaning fee can be collected as a surtax." Lin Baiguang said, "This is actually a local tax, we just attach it to the retail link of grain. For every *jin* of grain sold, levy a certain amount of cleaning fee—common people have to eat, to eat they have to buy rice, paying the tax when buying rice. Doing this has another benefit, which is that taxation in the circulation link is relatively hidden. In the 21st century, many people still thought direct tax was the only tax, spouting strange theories like 'most Chinese don't pay tax'. In the 17th century, people who can understand this are even fewer."

"This idea is not bad, but this way wouldn't the grain price go up? You know we originally planned to levy business tax in the grain market."

The document establishing wholesale markets for grain and non-staple food was officially issued a few days ago. Lin Baiguang had been looking for suitable facilities to utilize these days—if not, he had to find a suitable place to build new ones.

"This tax amount is very small." Lin Baiguang said, "Small enough that you can ignore it, but the grain consumed by Guangzhou people every month is a massive figure. Adding together it becomes very considerable."

"Alright, you really have a way." Liu Xiang said, "While clearing drains, also clean up illegal structures and garbage in the city. We have to plan well."

Clearing drains was just the first step, demolishing illegal structures was also easy. But how to dispose of the massive amount of silt and garbage after clearing drains, and how to settle the residents after demolishing illegal structures, all had to be planned ahead.

Cleaning out thousands upon thousands of tons of garbage from a big city with a population of several hundred thousand at once, expecting surrounding villagers to digest it immediately in the form of fertilizer was very difficult. There must be a designated place for stacking. Once the poor living in various illegal structures had their houses demolished and became homeless, they also had to have a place to be accepted. Otherwise, it would cause serious social problems.

The two discussed for a good while, making calculations on specific settlement methods and funding sources. Liu Xiang calculated with a pencil for a long time, sighing: "This job is really tedious."

"You, the one in charge, don't pick at details too finely. Tell Little Zhang to do the specific plan—also give her some opportunities to exercise." Lin Baiguang laughed, "She came to us for an internship, best give her some specific work, don't let her always do paperwork."

"That's fine too." Liu Xiang nodded, picking up another report on the table. This was the meeting minutes sent by Zheng Shangjie regarding the First Plenary Session of the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce. Liu Xiang knew the current meeting was basically official red tape—because merchants didn't completely understand what kind of regime the Senate was. Out of the traditional concept of "whoever is Emperor, listen to them", industrialists and merchants inevitably appeared to be at the government's disposal on the surface. Asking them to speak their true hearts was impossible.

Although it was official red tape, Liu Xiang still carefully flipped through the minutes. The First Congress used proportional representation, roughly taking into account all aspects. But looking at the speeches, those speaking more were still big merchants and big guilds. Small and medium merchants basically had no speeches. The content of speeches was also relatively empty. Obviously, before the big picture was settled, everyone was unwilling to appear "too active".

But this didn't matter. Liu Xiang knew the main purpose of this congress was to establish various trade associations underneath, organizing all industrial and commercial households, to facilitate conveying the Senate's voice and orders to them, and also for the convenience of taxation.

Some larger industries, such as silk, grain, sauce and vinegar, printing and dyeing, spices, maritime trade, etc., originally had various guilds, but these guilds were relatively loose in organization. Due to differences in practitioners or conflicts of interest, having multiple guilds in one industry wasn't rare. In addition, the vast number of small merchants and small shops generally found it hard to join guilds, actually remaining outside of guilds.
