# Chapter 2018 - Meritorious Participation

Just as the crowd outside grew impatient, a stout Daoist suddenly emerged—Cui Hantang, Supervisor of the Five Immortals Temple. He held a tea bowl in his left hand while extending his right with five fingers flat, fingertips pointing upward, thumb pressing the ring finger to form a Purification Gesture. He dipped the ring fingertip into water, then flicked the holy water outward by snapping his thumb against the fingertip. He chanted: "Jade Wheel Brims with Light, Full and Without Defect. Dark Visions Clear and Thorough, Divine Gates Swing Ajar. High Sovereign Dwells Within, Jade Crown and Feathered Robes. Pray Descend Your Spirit Qi, Come Meet My Returning Date." Simultaneously, his hand formed a Sword Gesture while his feet tread the Seven Star Steps, chanting: "One step Heaven's Light used, two steps Earth's Light appears, three steps Human's Light shines, four steps Gods and Spirits, five steps Five Elements Light gathers at the North Sun, six steps South Dipper brilliant, seven steps North Dipper radiates perfection." The crowd watched with amusement. Suddenly the stout Daoist shouted: "Start the show!" Fu Meng hurriedly connected the projector to the "Zhong's No. 5 Mobile Power Pack," and a beam of light shot from the open door crack onto the large screen.

According to Cui Hantang's original plan, he would have also proclaimed: "Open the Five Directions, Collect the Sunlight, Reveal the Yin Light and Divine Light," then point his finger at the screen, perform a spell, and activate the projector—fully demonstrating this was his magical power. However, after staging this "magic" once, he'd been summoned to City Government. Someone had written to the Council of Elders accusing him of "using the pretext of popularizing science and occupying controlled materials to actually promote feudal superstition," which not only embarrassed Cui Hantang but also humiliated Lord Zhang—after all, New Daoism's missionary tenet to "promote science" had been set by him personally.

The Religious Affairs Office and Planning Commission wanted to reclaim the projector. After cursing countless obscenities in his heart, Cui Hantang had to specifically seek out Liu Xiang and force a smile, guaranteeing he would never again link film technology with magic. Only then was the projector saved. Upon returning, he'd grumbled a few words but was chided by Fu Meng: Lingao already has cinemas, and many naturalized citizens have watched movies. Aren't you staging a rival show against the Council of Elders by doing this? If a cinema opens in Guangzhou later, will you perform this routine before every screening?

Cui Hantang realized this made sense. If a Guangzhou cinema truly opened, wouldn't he be publicly slapping his own face? So he'd canceled this segment for future screenings. However, unwilling to relinquish the powerful tool of film, he still performed some "Daoist magic" before starting the film, hinting at a connection.

Seeing the Daoist finish his ritual, the crowd watched as figures and scenes materialized on the screen, and voices of people within reached their ears. Fortunately, this wasn't the inaugural screening, so there was no longer the sensational uproar of the entire audience. But people remained curious. Occasionally someone would venture behind the screen to see who was performing such realistic shadow puppetry, discovering the same image on both sides.

Puzzled, they all praised the stout Daoist's magical powers, but soon became absorbed in watching with rapt attention.

Today's screening was an obscure old film, *Legend of the Eight Immortals*. It told the story of seven Penglai Pavilion immortals—Lü Dongbin, Iron Crutch Li, He Xiangu, Han Zhongli, Han Xiangzi, Lan Caihe, and Zhang Guolao—enlightening Cao Guojiu.

Expelled from the palace, Cao Guojiu was successively enlightened by the seven immortals but dismissed them, until he was banished again for admonishing a fatuous ruler, finally perceiving the truth. Disheartened with officialdom, Cao Guojiu set his heart on seeking immortality. Experiencing countless trials during his wanderings, enlightened by the seven immortals to view fame and fortune as dross and worldly affairs as fickle, he suddenly saw the light, ascended to immortality, and tread across the sea with the seven immortals...

The film was produced in the eighties. By modern standards, the special effects weren't worth fifty cents, the plot lacked drama, and costumes and art design appeared crude. Yet for commoners whose usual entertainment consisted of watching "local opera" in vernacular, this movie proved "shocking."

Though they couldn't quite comprehend the Mandarin spoken by characters, Fu Meng's subtitles created no obstacles to viewing. Instead, it helped promote Mandarin.

Before two hours had passed, the *Eight Immortals* story concluded.

Cui Hantang walked beneath the screen, raised his sleeve to cover his face, and spoke through a microphone hidden within the fabric: "Life in this world is fraught with a thousand hardships; worldly prosperity passes like clouds and smoke; chasing fame and profit brings no peace of mind; high office and rich salary can't preserve the body; better to turn to the Dao and be carefree for a hundred years."

With this declaration, he pinched a sword gesture, and the image transformed to another scene: a majestic temple hidden among green mountains and lush bamboo, stone paths weaving through forest, Daoists in blue robes carrying buckets and loads walking nimbly through bamboo groves with smiles... Beside an ancient mid-mountain temple, a middle-aged Daoist with flowing beard and ruddy complexion poured tea, played chess, read scriptures, and splashed ink to write the large character "Dao"... On the mountain peak amidst clouds, an old Daoist master with white hair and youthful face, light-bodied and vigorous, traversed mountains as if on flat ground, meditating on the Dao or practicing sword and fist techniques...

The stout Daoist spoke again: "Respected neighbors and elders, starting today, this temple will teach the Way of Fitness every morning following scripture lectures. We welcome all neighbors and Daoist practitioners to visit and participate in the Supreme Great Dao together. Please spread the word..."

After delivering this advertisement, Cui Hantang retreated into the temple. Qing Yun and several young Daoist students hurriedly dismantled the screen and carried it back inside.

"Ma Yangchun, that smelly hairy creature, dares compete with Fat Lord for believers!" Cui Hantang felt triumphant. Ma Yangchun, newly promoted to Bishop of the Guangzhou Diocese, had obtained approval from the Religious Affairs Office to construct a new church outside the South Gate and was enthusiastic about missionary work. Friction with Daoist Cui had proved inevitable.

"Religious reform is beneficial, but letting this foreign religion profit from all the changes is highly inappropriate!" Cui Hantang changed clothes, reclining on the bamboo couch while drinking tea. "Catholicism originally possessed no local property; we couldn't harvest from them. Instead, they seized the opportunity to purchase several properties! Claiming they want to open some charity house! Bullshit! Can't we operate charity houses ourselves? Isn't it merely to lure converts?"

Fu Meng disagreed. "If he wants to operate charity, there's no problem. The Council of Elders can't manage everything—if he runs one, we run one too."

Hearing this, Cui Hantang slapped his thigh. "Old Fu, you're absolutely right. We'll establish one too! They won't let us run primary schools? Operating a charity hall can't be objectionable."

Fu Meng said: "If we want to establish one, no one above or below will object. Only there's no space remaining in Five Immortals Temple. We'll have to locate another venue."

"Venues can always be found; our Daoist Association possesses properties." Cui Hantang reflected. "But finding qualified people is difficult." He put away his usual playful, improper demeanor, resting his chin in his hand. "Need responsible and compassionate individuals—otherwise better not to establish one."

While he was deep in contemplation, a Daoist student suddenly entered to report that Elder Wang Jun had arrived.

"Invite him in immediately." Cui Hantang felt surprised, because Wang Jun rarely visited Five Immortals Temple—his workplace was in Huangpu, some distance from Guangzhou city. Usually he only came when specifically invited to repair computers and such.

Inviting him inside to converse, he learned Wang Jun had come begging for alms.

"...That's roughly the situation. We want to use the Wedding and Funeral Council's name to have the Three Religions step forward and solicit sponsorship for this collective wedding—ideally if we could also provide some dowry for the brides."

"That Liu Xiang just loves this taking-off-pants-to-fart nonsense," Cui Hantang grunted. "If Fat Lord had his way, requesting these gentry and wealthy households to pay would be honoring them! But no, he pushes the money away. We can't piss gold or shit silver. Being so high-minded, how can we accomplish anything!"

Hearing this, Wang Jun felt a profound sense of finding a kindred spirit. He nodded repeatedly.

"...Don't worry, Fat Lord will handle this." Cui Hantang thumped his chest resoundingly. "Roughly how much money? Just name a figure. I'll arrange it."

"Two or three hundred yuan would suffice—money for the banquet." Wang Jun wasn't entirely certain if this "saving the nation by devious route" approach was appropriate. "Don't need excessive amounts, just adequate."

"I understand. You fellows are definitely afraid of Liu Xiang and the others gabbing." Cui Hantang pondered momentarily; actually, he comprehended Liu Xiang's logic in refusing strict major-household sponsorship. "Don't worry, I'll definitely accomplish this for you, and without getting you into trouble."

Wang Jun interacted with him frequently. Though Cui Hantang liked grand talk, he usually delivered on promises. With his declaration, the matter was considered settled. Wang Jun said immediately: "Then we rely entirely on you."

"Relax! If I can't even secure this modest sum, what am I doing as Vice Director of the Wedding and Funeral Council?" Cui Hantang laughed. "Just await the good news."

Wang Jun departed satisfied. But securing money required careful consideration. Though he'd gathered considerable incense money these days, that was capital for grand moves in Guangdong; he couldn't bear to spend it. Thinking it over, he needed another pretext. Going directly to believing gentry households to beg wouldn't do—too degrading. They had to rush to deliver money. Thinking repeatedly, it seemed holding a Daoist ritual (

Jiao) was the only avenue.

He had the ritual name prepared too. Since it was raising funds for a collective wedding, the title would be "Marriage Jiao." Daoist rituals covered everything from praying for blessings, celebration, thanking gods, to salvation; holding a Marriage Jiao wasn't excessive. As for the organizer, since Wang Jun and the others couldn't appear in official capacity, they'd simply find one of the twelve sponsors to step forward. Then invite other wealthy households to "meritorious participation." These gentry and wealthy households were shrewd; they'd grasp the hint immediately. Raising several hundred yuan would prove more than sufficient.

Fu Meng listened to his conception and cheered repeatedly, adding: "For the person stepping forward to host the ritual, I think Zhang Yu from Zhang's Food Company would be ideal. His shop was supported and promoted single-handedly by us following Guangzhou's liberation; it bears the strongest Council of Elders affiliation. If his family steps forward, would other gentry not comprehend?"

"Little Fu, you've made an excellent point. But we can't be the only ones exerting effort, correct? The monks and foreign priests have to contribute a little too—after all, they're also members of the Wedding and Funeral Council."
