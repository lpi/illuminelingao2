# Chapter 2018 - Meritorious Participation

Just as the crowd outside was growing impatient, a fat Daoist suddenly emerged. It was Cui Hantang, the Supervisor of the Five Immortals Temple. He held a tea bowl in his left hand, and extended his right hand with five fingers flat, fingertips pointing up, thumb pressing the ring finger to form a Purification Gesture. He dipped the tip of his ring finger into water, then flicked the holy water out by snapping his thumb against the fingertip. He chanted: "Jade Wheel Brims with Light, Full and Without Defect. Dark Visions Clear and Thorough, Divine Gates Swing Ajar. High Sovereign Dwells Within, Jade Crown and Feathered Robes. Pray Descend Your Spirit Qi, Come Meet My Returning Date." Simultaneously, his hand formed a Sword Gesture while his feet tread the Seven Star Steps, chanting: "One step Heaven's Light used, two steps Earth's Light appears, three steps Human's Light shines, four steps Gods and Spirits, five steps Five Elements Light gathers at the North Sun, six steps South Dipper brilliant, seven steps North Dipper radiates perfection." The crowd watched with amusement. Suddenly the fat Daoist shouted: "Start the show!" Fu Meng hurriedly connected the projector and the "Zhong's No. 5 Mobile Power Pack," and a beam of light shot out from the open door crack onto the large screen.

According to Cui Hantang's original plan, he would have also shouted: "Open the Five Directions, Collect the Sunlight, Reveal the Yin Light and Divine Light." Then point his finger at the screen, perform a spell, and then turn on the projector—fully demonstrating this was his magical power. However, after playing this "magic" once, he was summoned to the City Government. Someone had written to the Council of Elders accusing him of "using the pretext of popularizing science and occupying controlled materials to actually promote feudal superstition," which not only embarrassed Cui Hantang but also humiliated Lord Zhang—after all, the missionary tenet of New Daoism to "promote science" was set by him.

The Religious Affairs Office and Planning Commission wanted to reclaim the projector. After cursing countless motherf*ckers in his heart, Cui Hantang had to specifically find Liu Xiang and force a smile, guaranteeing he would never again link film technology with magic. Only then was the projector saved. Upon returning, he grumbled a few words but was blamed by Fu Meng: Lingao already has cinemas, and many naturalized citizens have seen movies. Aren't you staging a rival show against the Council of Elders by doing this? If a cinema opens in Guangzhou later, will you go perform this routine every time a movie starts?

Cui Hantang realized this made sense. If a Guangzhou cinema really opened, wouldn't he be publicly slapping his own face? So he canceled this segment for future screenings. However, unwilling to give up the powerful tool of film, he still performed some "Daoist magic" before starting the film, hinting at a connection.

Seeing the Daoist finish his ritual, the crowd saw figures and scenes appear on the screen, and voices of people in the mirror reached their ears—fortuneately, this wasn't the first screening, so there was no longer the sensational uproar of the whole audience. But people were still curious; occasionally someone would go behind the screen to see who was performing such realistic shadow puppetry. They found the same image on both sides of the screen.

Puzzled, they all praised the fat Daoist's magical powers, but soon became absorbed in watching with relish.

Today's screening was an obscure old movie, *Legend of the Eight Immortals*. It told the story of the seven immortals of Penglai Pavilion—Lu Dongbin, Iron Crutch Li, He Xiangu, Han Zhongli, Han Xiangzi, Lan Caihe, and Zhang Guolao—enlightening Cao Guojiu.

Expelled from the palace, Cao Guojiu was successively enlightened by the seven immortals but dismissed them, until he was banished again for admonishing a fatuous ruler, finally realizing the truth. Disheartened with officialdom, Cao Guojiu set his heart on seeking immortality. Experiencing countless trials during his wanderings, enlightened by the seven immortals to see through fame and fortune as dirt and worldly affairs as fickle, he suddenly saw the light, ascended to immortality, and tread the sea away with the seven immortals...

The film was made in the eighties. by modern standards, the special effects weren't even worth fifty cents, the plot wasn't dramatic, and costumes and art design were crude. Yet for commoners whose usual entertainment was watching "local opera" in vernacular, this movie was "shocking."

Although they couldn't quite understand the Mandarin spoken by characters, with subtitles made by Fu Meng, there were no obstacles to watching; instead, it helped promote Mandarin.

Before two hours passed, the *Eight Immortals* story finished:

Cui Hantang walked under the screen, raised his sleeve to cover his face, and spoke through a microphone hidden in the sleeve: "Life in this world is fraught with thousands of hardships; worldly prosperity passes like clouds and smoke; chasing fame and profit brings no peace of mind; high office and rich salary can't preserve the body; better to turn to the Dao and be carefree for a hundred years."

Saying this, he pinched a sword gesture, and the image changed to another scene: A majestic temple hidden among green mountains and lush bamboo, stone paths weaving through the forest, Daoists in blue robes carrying buckets and loads walking nimbly through bamboo groves with smiles... Beside an ancient temple mid-mountain, a middle-aged Daoist with a long flowing beard and ruddy face poured tea, played chess, read scriptures, and splashed ink to write a large character "Dao"... On the mountain peak amidst clouds, an old Daoist master with white hair and a youthful face, light-bodied and healthy, traversed mountains like flat ground, meditating on the Dao or practicing sword and fist...

The fat Daoist said again: "Respected neighbors and elders, starting today, this temple will teach the Way of Fitness every morning after scripture lectures. We welcome all neighbors and Daoist practitioners to visit and participate in the Supreme Great Dao together. Please pass the word to each other..."

After shouting this advertisement, Cui Hantang turned back into the temple. Qing Yun and several young Daoist students hurriedly took down the screen and carried it back into the temple.

"Ma Yangchun, that smelly hairy thing, dares compete with Fat Lord for believers!" Cui Hantang was triumphant. Ma Yangchun, newly promoted to Bishop of the Guangzhou Diocese, had obtained approval from the Religious Affairs Office to build a new church outside the South Gate and was enthusiastic about missionary work. Inevitably there was friction with Daoist Cui.

"Religious reform is good, but letting this foreign religion benefit from all the changes is very inappropriate!" Cui Hantang changed clothes, lying on the bamboo couch drinking tea. "Catholicism originally had no property locally; we couldn't harvest chives from them. Instead, they took the opportunity to buy several properties! Saying they want to open some charity house! Bullshit! Can't we run charity houses ourselves? Isn't it just to pull heads into their religion?"

Fu Meng disagreed: "If he wants to run charity, there's no problem. The Council of Elders can't run everything—if he runs one, we run one too."

Hearing this, Cui Hantang slapped his thigh: "Old Fu, you're right. We'll run one too! Won't let us run primary schools? Running a charity hall can't be wrong."

Fu Meng said: "If we want to run one, no one above or below will object. Only there's no space left in Five Immortals Temple. Have to find another place."

"Places can always be found; our Daoist Association has properties." Cui Hantang thought. "But finding people is hard." He put away his usual playful, improper face, resting his chin in his hand. "Need responsible and loving people—otherwise better not to run one."

While he was deep in thought, a Daoist student suddenly came in to report that Elder Wang Jun had arrived.

"Invite them in quickly." Cui Hantang was surprised, because Wang Jun rarely came to Five Immortals Temple—his workplace was in Huangpu, some distance from Guangzhou city. Usually he only came when specially invited to fix computers and such.

Inviting him in to talk, he learned Wang Jun was here to beg for alms.

"...That's roughly the situation. We want to use the name of the Wedding and Funeral Council to have the Three Religions step forward and solicit sponsorship for this collective wedding—best if we can also provide some dowry for the brides."

"That Liu Xiang just loves this pants-off-to-fart nonsense," Cui Hantang grunted. "If Fat Lord had his way, asking these gentry and wealthy households to pay is thinking highly of them! But no, he pushes the money away. We can't piss gold or shit silver; being so high-minded, how can we get anything done!"

Hearing this, Wang Jun felt a strong sense of knowing a kindred spirit. He nodded repeatedly.

"...Don't worry, Fat Lord will handle this." Cui Hantang thumped his chest loudly. " Roughly how much money? Just name a figure. I'll arrange it."

"Two or three hundred yuan would do—money for the banquet." Wang Jun wasn't entirely sure if this "curve to save the nation" approach was appropriate. "Don't need too much, just enough."

"I got it. You guys are definitely afraid of Liu Xiang and the others babbling." Cui Hantang pondered for a moment; actually, he understood Liu Xiang's logic of refusing strict big-household sponsorship. "Don't worry, I'll definitely get this done for you, and without getting you into trouble."

Wang Jun interacted with him often; although Cui Hantang liked to talk big, he usually delivered on promises. With his declaration, the matter was considered settled. Wang Jun said immediately: "Then we rely entirely on you."

"Relax! If I can't even get this little money, what am I doing as Vice Director of the Wedding and Funeral Council?" Cui Hantang laughed. "Just wait for the good news."

Wang Jun left satisfied. But getting money required careful thought. Though he had gathered quite a bit of incense money these days, that was capital for big moves in Guangdong; he couldn't bear to spend it. Thinking it over, he needed another pretext. Going directly to believing gentry households to beg wouldn't do—too degrading; they had to rush to bring money. Thinking again and again, it seemed holding a Daoist ritual (Jiao) was the only way.

He had the name for the ritual ready too. Since it was raising funds for a collective wedding, the title would be "Marriage Jiao." Daoist rituals covered everything from praying for blessings, celebration, thanking gods, to salvation; holding a Marriage Jiao wasn't excessive. As for the organizer, since Wang Jun and the others couldn't appear in official capacity, just find one of the twelve sponsors to step forward. Then invite other wealthy households to "joyfully participate" (meritorious participation). These gentry and wealthy households were shrewd; they'd understand the hint. Raising a few hundred yuan would be more than enough.

Fu Meng listened to his idea and cheered repeatedly, adding: "For the person stepping forward to hold the ritual, I think Zhang Yu from Zhang's Food Company is good. His shop was supported and promoted single-handedly by us after liberating Guangzhou; it has the strongest Council of Elders color. If his family steps forward, would other gentry not understand?"

"Little Fu, you have a point. But we can't be the only ones putting in effort, right? The monks and foreign monks have to bleed a little too—after all, they are also members of the Wedding and Funeral Council."
