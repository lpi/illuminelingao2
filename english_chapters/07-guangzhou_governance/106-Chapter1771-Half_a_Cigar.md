# Chapter 1771 - Half a Cigar

Gao Ju understood that the moment he nodded, he would ascend to become the foremost figure in Guangzhou's commercial world. The mighty Teochew-Swatow merchants, the Cantonese trading houses, and all the rest would have to look up to him. But that consideration was secondary—the crucial point was that henceforth, he would be a man with official standing in the Great Song.

When a merchant's wealth reached a certain threshold, his ambitions inevitably turned toward political power. Without political protection, wealth could neither endure nor grow.

Gao Ju's rise had depended on Eunuch Yang as his patron; step by step, that backing had elevated him to his present position. Now the Ming was crumbling, clearly in its death throes. And at this precise moment, the Australians had come to recruit him. If he could attach himself to such a lofty branch, he would become a true "follower-of-the-dragon" vassal—and the Gao clan's future would be beyond measure.

Yet once he accepted this post, he would be lashed irrevocably to the Senatorial Council's ship. For a man who had spent most of his life as a Ming subject, that thought brought an inescapable uneasiness.

"Well?" Zheng Shangjie studied his expression—eager to taste the forbidden fruit yet afraid of arousing suspicion—and smiled. "What does Master Gao say?"

"Well... well..." Gao Ju fished a handkerchief from his sleeve and mopped the sweat beading on his forehead. "I thank the Senatorial Council and the Chiefs for this honor. But this is a momentous matter. Allow me... allow me to think it over..."

Zheng Shangjie's smile remained charming. "Very well. I know Master Gao must be prudent. I won't press for your answer today."

"Thank you, Director Zheng, for your understanding." Unconsciously, Gao Ju had adopted a deferential tone.

"Don't mention it. I've asked you here today on another matter as well."

Gao Ju relaxed slightly. "Please, give me any instructions. I'll serve to the best of my ability."

"An old friend wishes to see you." Zheng Shangjie smiled.

A shiver ran through Gao Ju. "Oh? Who might that be?" Among the Senators, he had "old friends" in only three: Wen, Wang, and Xiao. But he'd heard all three held high positions in the Senatorial Council; even ordinary Senators rarely met with them. He himself didn't dare dream of such an audience.

"You'll see soon enough." Zheng Shangjie rose. "Come, this way."

Gao Ju stood and followed her to a door bearing the words "Conference Room." Zheng Shangjie pushed it open. Behind the long table, someone was seated; seeing him enter, the figure rose to greet him. Short hair, a tall frame exceeding six *chi*, clad in an "Australian robe" that fell to the knees with a soft hood at the back and a belt at the waist—exactly like the mysterious man who had appeared in his back courtyard seven years ago. Even the face seemed unchanged.

"Master Wen!" Gao Ju couldn't help exclaiming.

Wen Desi nodded with a smile and raised a hand in greeting. "Master Gao! How have you been?"

"Master Wen!" For a moment, Gao Ju was too overcome to speak. Seven years ago, the three of them—Wen, Wang, and Xiao—had appeared together in his back courtyard, setting his life on an entirely new course. Without the Australian goods they brought, Gao Ju would have remained just one of countless foreign-goods merchants on Haopan Street. How could he have become the leader of Guangzhou's overseas-trade community?

They were, in no small measure, the lucky stars of his destiny. Although in recent years Gao Ju had maintained intimate dealings with Guo Yi and the others—serving as the Australians' foremost agent in Guangzhou—he had never presumed to seek out Wen Desi himself. The Guangzhou Station people had told him that Wen, Wang, and Xiao all held critical positions in the Senatorial Council; even fellow Senators found it difficult to arrange meetings. A mere merchant like himself had even less hope.

Now that the Senatorial Council had swept through Guangdong in an unstoppable tide, poised to contend for the Central Plains, the gap between them was vaster than ever. Although in his own mansion Gao Ju occasionally boasted about "when Senator Wen was in trouble, how I helped him" or "Senator Wang took a fancy to my house-slave Girl-Bright at a single glance"—he had never imagined these three Senators would still remember those early days when they had done business together. Great men have short memories; for Gao Ju, shrewd about the ways of the world, that was only to be expected.

So even though rumor had it that Wen Desi was coming to Guangzhou as Military Governor of Guangdong, Gao Ju hadn't rushed to find a way to meet him. The man was now a regional overlord, overseeing an entire province's affairs—far too busy to receive visitors casually. Never mind Guangdong; in Guangzhou alone, countless people must be clamoring for an audience. To seek one uninvited might suggest a desire to renew old ties—but would a great man want to acknowledge his humble friends from former days? That was a considerable question mark. Without first sounding out the other side's attitude, a hasty visit could end not in renewed friendship but in the host's displeasure.

Better to invest effort in people like Liu Xiang and Zheng Shangjie—both "county officials" and hands-on managers.

And yet Master Wen—no, Senator Wen—had summoned him in private! Gao Ju was deeply moved. The fact that Chairman Wen was dressed this way for their meeting was clearly a signal: "I have not forgotten our former connection; I cherish our old bond." To think that this Senator—called "Prime Minister Wen" by some, the foremost figure in the Senatorial Council—would condescend to a mere merchant like himself... Before he knew it, tears were streaming down Gao Ju's face.

In over fifty years of life, this was the first time Gao Ju had wept in front of another person. Over the years, he had navigated commerce and officialdom, mingling with governors and provincial administrators, prefects and county magistrates. Thanks to his vast fortune and Eunuch Yang's backing, he'd always been treated politely enough; at banquets they'd call each other "brother." But had any of them ever truly respected him? They all saw him as a fat sheep ready for shearing at any moment.

Just as he was too overcome to find words, Wen Desi came forward and extended a hand. "What's this? Don't you recognize an old friend?"

"I dare not, I dare not." Gao Ju hastily wiped his tears. "Master Wen—Chief Wen—I simply don't know what to say!"

"Please, sit." Wen Desi motioned him to a chair and sat down himself, sighing. "It's been seven years since we parted! The day we came to your back courtyard to do business with you—it seems like just yesterday."

Gao Ju hurried to reply: "Back then, this humble man was blind and failed to recognize the majesty of the Senatorial Council. I actually haggled over every penny—I deserve death a thousand times..."

Wen Desi waved his hand. "Please! We were doing business: in commerce, talk commerce. Besides, we ourselves weren't in any better shape then—sneaking into your courtyard in the dead of night. That you didn't seize us as robbers was remarkable!" He laughed heartily and handed Gao Ju a cigar.

Hearing that Wen Desi held no grudge about the past, Gao Ju felt even more at ease. He accepted the cigar respectfully and said, "Without the Australian goods the Chiefs brought, how could this humble man have built such a foundation? It is all thanks to the grace of Chief Wen, Chief Wang, Chief Xiao, and the Senatorial Council."

Wen Desi nodded with a smile. "Don't be too modest." He produced a match, struck it, and made to light Gao Ju's cigar himself. Gao Ju was startled; before he could think, he leaned in to accept the light. Only after exhaling the first puff of smoke did he realize how presumptuous he'd been: lighting pipes and pouring water was servants' work! How could he have been so thoughtless? He said in alarm, "I dare not, I dare not—you are too kind..."

Wen Desi shook out the match and dropped it in the ashtray. "You have rendered meritorious service to the Senatorial Council—to the Great Song!" He stressed the words "meritorious service." "Without you, we might have wasted years and encountered setbacks beyond count. This, the Senatorial Council will never forget."

These words made Gao Ju's ears ring. He had never dreamed Wen Desi would say such things to him. A jumble of emotions churned in his breast—elation and anxiety alike. He hurried to respond: "Chief Wen... You flatter me. I'm only a merchant. Although I've done a great deal of business with the Senatorial Council, it was all for profit. How dare I speak of 'meritorious service'?"

"Doing business is also meritorious. Who says seeking profit isn't a service? I'd say that Guangzhou's prosperity is half the credit of its merchants." Wen Desi lit a cigar for himself. "Without merchants, would Guangzhou have its reputation as 'the most splendid city south of the sky'?"

"Yes, yes, Chief, you are absolutely right!" Gao Ju nodded excitedly. He had never heard anyone in the Ming speak so explicitly of valuing commerce. He felt he had found a kindred spirit.

Wen Desi continued, "Guangzhou has only recently been liberated. Trade has resumed, but activity remains sluggish; there are also many abuses that urgently need elimination. The trouble is, we don't know enough about Guangzhou's commercial world. We'll need the business community's support. You're our old partner here—don't fall behind the times!"

Gao Ju hastened to reply, "Wherever I can be of use, I am at your service!"

Wen Desi nodded. The two chatted a while longer before Gao Ju rose to take his leave. As he departed, Wen Desi said, "Guangzhou's commercial affairs—I'm counting on you."

Moved, Gao Ju answered, "Thank you, Chief Wen, for your trust. I will go through fire and water and never flinch!"

It was past noon when he arrived home. The Third Concubine was watching over a table of food, her face anxious. Gao Ju's principal wife remained at the old home in Xiuning; in Guangzhou, the Third Concubine managed the household.

Seeing him return looking well, she breathed a sigh of relief and grumbled, "You said you'd be back before noon. If you were going to be late, why not send a boy ahead to let us know? You had everyone worried."

"I never expected to have such a remarkable encounter today." Gao Ju smiled.

"What encounter?" The Third Concubine helped him change clothes while dispatching a maid to bring water for washing and had the servants reheat the dishes.

"I met an old friend." Gao Ju withdrew from his sleeve the half-smoked cigar. "Fetch my hundred-treasure-inlaid rosewood calling-card box."

The box was brought. Gao Ju had the Third Concubine wrap the cigar-butt carefully in soft tissue, wind red thread around it, and only then place it inside the box.
