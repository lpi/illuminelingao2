## Chapter 1925 - History of the Senate

The Guangzhou Municipal Administrative School was established within the Tribute Courtyard. Besides the examination cells, north of the "Heaven Opens Literary Fortune" archway was the "Public Hall Area," containing buildings centered on the Hall of Ultimate Impartiality—all put to use.

For convenient access, the school's main entrance utilized the original north gate. Yuan Shuzhi and the others had to follow directional signs around in a circle before finding the entrance.

Though the buildings covered substantial area, not many were suitable. All structures were over a hundred years old—leaking roofs and moldy walls everywhere. By Senate standards, they were barely passable.

Running training programs had precedent from the Police Training School. They transferred a third of the Police Academy's administrative team as core, copied regulations with minor modifications, and Zhang Yunmi became administrator without much effort.

Of 1,899 examinees, 501 advanced to interviews. With urgent need for personnel, standards were lenient. Few were eliminated during interviews. After political review and physical examination, 456 ultimately enrolled.

These ranged from old to young. Yuan Shuzhi, in his early fifties, wasn't even the oldest—someone expert in astronomy was older.

Though emphasizing physical training and military-style management, since most came from urban petit-bourgeois backgrounds—many being older with less-than-optimal health—there was no intensive military training initially. First came grouping by physical examination results—those with scabies infection being the largest category. All received urgent treatment.

Based on Lin Motian's experience, many diseases stemmed from poor sanitation and malnutrition. The first step was curing illnesses and cultivating hygiene habits while improving diet to strengthen bodies.

Training remained closed format, meals provided by school following nutritional standards. Meat, eggs, fish, vegetables—everything amply provided.

"This treatment is probably rare even among naturalized citizens," Zhang Yunmi remarked. Nutritious meals were provided to Engine Operation refugees too, but those were people pulled from death's brink—quite different from these scholars.

"If we don't build their health, forget running—they'll doze during classes," Lin Motian said. "They're different from farmers. Families supported their studies; they never experienced manual labor tempering. Their studying broke down their bodies..."

Healthy trainees underwent military training first. This established obedience and team spirit while exercising their bodies. Senate civil servants didn't have nine-to-five schedules—seven days a week, twelve hours daily was commonplace.

Training curricula were compiled by each department. The philosophy centered on practical operations, not theory, focusing on procedures and document formats. Traditional clerks dominated government affairs precisely because they knew procedures and formats. Elders with civil service backgrounds agreed: grassroots civil servants needed to "follow established procedures." Decision-making was for higher-level cadres.

Unified textbooks included basic cultural courses, general knowledge, and ideological political education.

Basic cultural courses meant replacing their writing habits with simplified characters and vernacular Chinese. Since Ming vernacular differed considerably from modern vernacular, re-education was needed.

General knowledge—simple natural science and hygiene—was a long-term project.

Ideological political education was complex with considerable debate. It required explaining the Senate's "national polity," "origins," and "founding principles." The Truth Office had gone through years of revision and Senate debate before finalizing the text.

Since this concerned national polity, upper echelons instructed that material on "Great Song Australian Temporary Court" origins should be "broad rather than detailed," avoiding gaps difficult to patch later.

However, for post-D-Day history and policies, the Truth Office was instructed to "write extensively" to demonstrate "political correctness" and "Mandate of Heaven." Three points were emphasized: the Senate was the "sole representative" of Huaxia people's interests; the Elders' descent saved Huaxia from existential crisis; the Senate was the world's "beacon," representing the most advanced productive forces, systems, and culture—"Had Heaven not sent the Sacred Ships, all ages would be endless night."

The Senate's legal succession came from Great Song. The return was not a new dynasty rising, but kings returning. Dynasties after Song—Yuan and Ming—weren't recognized as legitimate. Mongol Yuan was denigrated as "false"; Ming treated as "usurpers."

However, differences between this Song and that Song had to be made clear. If Great Song succession were overemphasized, it would weaken Senate authority, creating an exploitable opening for ambitious people. Therefore, the Truth Office compiled this history:

March 19, 1279: Battle of Yamen ended in defeat. Lu Xiufu carried the eight-year-old emperor into the sea. Southern Song fell.

September 1279: Southern Song remnants sailed six months before entering a gigantic maelstrom in the South Seas. After days of violent storms, they emerged into unknown waters under brilliant sunshine. They landed on a verdant island, naming it "Australia."

January 1, 1280: The exile government established capital here—the "Great Song Australian Temporary Court." A new emperor was installed.

Through fortuitous circumstances, the Great Song achieved tremendous development. After a century, productive forces increased dramatically. Contradictions between emerging capitalists and military nobility versus old landlords and nobility became irreconcilable, causing the First Civil War. The emperor issued a self-criticism edict and established the Senate, incorporating commercial and military elites into the power class.

Decades later, contradictions between the emperor's faction and Senate triggered the Second Civil War, ending in complete defeat for the emperor's faction. The Great Song name was preserved, but the emperor became a figurehead with only ritual authority. All other powers belonged to the Senate.

While these events unfolded, Australians expanded across the landmass and colonized far and wide.

Exploration ships attempted returning north but couldn't break through the maelstrom. Every few decades, wrecked ships from the maelstrom's other side drifted through, carrying passengers of various ethnicities—Portuguese, Dutch, Japanese—whose descendants formed Australia's multicultural population.

The Sacred Ships were expeditions sent after discovering the maelstrom could be traversed at certain times. Considering they might never return, ships were fully stocked. All passengers were granted Elder titles before departure.

The Truth Office invented this maelstrom to hint at a wormhole. Since Australia bore no civilization traces, creating a nonexistent maelstrom interpretable however needed would facilitate future work.
