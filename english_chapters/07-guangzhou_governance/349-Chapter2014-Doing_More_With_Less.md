# Chapter 2014 - Doing More With Less

"What percentage of total costs are we talking about?" Ai Zhixin asked promptly.

"I don't think setting a percentage makes sense—it might prove too large or too small. Let's base it on income instead. Participants will pay the equivalent of one month's average salary for a naturalized worker," Liu Xiang proposed. "Spending one month's wages on a wedding isn't excessive, is it?"

"That's too little," Ai Zhixin countered. "At least three months. These are all veteran naturalized citizens without wives. How much could they possibly spend? They must have accumulated two or three years of savings at minimum..."

"Not just two or three years," Wang Jun quipped. "I suspect some have thirty or forty years of savings."

Laughter rippled through the conference room. Even Zhang Yunmi couldn't suppress a smile.

Liu Xiang struggled to maintain composure but had to wave his hand with a grin. "Alright, alright—enough joking. Let's return to business."

Lin Baiguang smiled. "I think one month's salary hits the right mark. Precisely *because* they're bachelors without family obligations, they probably spend freely. Their savings won't amount to much. Charge too much and you'll breed resentment. If someone genuinely can't afford even this amount, we'll deduct it monthly from their salary—the sum's small enough that it won't affect their livelihood."

"Settled, then." Seeing Ai Zhixin about to protest again, Liu Xiang cut him off decisively.

Du Yibin interjected quickly: "For the funding shortfall, I don't think we need fiscal appropriations. Here's my suggestion: solicit donations from wealthy Guangzhou households. We'll list these merchants' names at the wedding as thanks—and award them purchase contracts for wedding supplies. For those merchants and wealthy families, this amounts to a small pledge of allegiance. The grain merchants, Gao Ju, and others will definitely donate money and goods. They might even have family members participate. This way we can also gauge where the major households stand based on donor numbers and amounts—useful intelligence for future work."

"A sponsorship and advertisement approach. Clever, very clever," Zhang Yunmi said. "This money's pocket change to them, plus they gain advertising returns."

Before Liu Xiang could respond, Lin Baiguang shook his head. "Even assuming many wealthy Guangzhou households would eagerly contribute if we hinted—and they'd be generous—frankly, proceeding that way would be inappropriate. First, it risks giving citizens and wealthy families the illusion that sponsorship creates special relationships with us. Second, it sets dangerous precedent. Donations should represent occasional charity; frequent requests become indistinguishable from taxes. We might handle the degree competently, but what about future Guangzhou city governments? When extracting money becomes this easy, good intentions pave the road to poor outcomes."

Having worked in county agencies during the nineties, Lin Baiguang had witnessed excessive grassroots governance firsthand. Frequent, forced donations consumed a regime's credibility and the people's goodwill. Regular occurrences not only burdened the masses but generated poor social perception—what should be benevolence gets perceived as exploitation and burden-shifting.

"I also think it's inappropriate." Wang Qiyi, who'd remained silent thus far, voiced opposition. "Such unconventional wealth-extraction methods should be employed sparingly. When they held the Asian Games, I was a primary school student. The school required every student to donate at least fifty cents—they even ranked donations by class, school, and county, fostering competition. It looked impressive: 'entire populace actively participating in the Asian Games,' very spirited. But for students from struggling families, fifty cents or one yuan wasn't trivial—imagine how those parents and students viewed such 'donations.' Excitement and pride? I think Beijing's later refusal to accept public donations for the Olympic bid represented substantial improvement."

"So if they offer donations, we refuse?" Du Yibin pressed anxiously. In yesterday's discussion, donations had represented the primary funding source.

"Correct. We can't accept this money," Liu Xiang stated. "Especially now, as our New Life Movement deepens and relations with wealthy households grow delicate. We must exercise particular care with boundaries to avoid sending the outside world wrong signals... or providing future pretexts."

Du Yibin, Wang Jun, and others looked visibly deflated.

Zhang Yikun spoke up promptly: "Donations are naturally off the table. But we can solicit sponsorship and advertising—perfectly legitimate commercial behavior. For instance, wedding refreshments, banquet ingredients—several enterprises in Guangzhou enjoy our specific support. Having them sponsor would be entirely appropriate."

These enterprises shared common attributes: they'd prospered following Guangzhou's liberation, maintained Council backing and investment, and crucially bore no connections to old wealthy households or gentry—their histories were clean. Soliciting their sponsorship and advertising provided publicity while demonstrating the Council's support for these new industrialists and merchants.

Zhang Yikun's proposal won universal approval.

"What if they're unwilling..."

"Anyone with a functional brain would fight for the opportunity," Zhang Yikun laughed. "Would the Council elevate a stupid enterprise as a benchmark?"

Policy thus settled, Zhang Yikun felt confident. He already had a draft sponsor roster mentally prepared. Zhang's Food, backed by Elder Hong, topped the list—since they produced snacks, relevant pastries could be entrusted to them. His own life secretary's small family industry naturally warranted attention. Then there was a "new enterprise" Elder Liu San supported in pharmaceuticals—Chen Li Ji. This old-timeline brand had operated barely thirty years in this timeline. As soon as the Council entered the city, Liu San personally visited requesting "cooperation," lavishing attention on this pharmacy that had languished in mediocrity for years. The move left Runshi Tang's proprietor feeling rather adrift.

Since Liu San valued Chen Li Ji so highly, this shop had to receive a share. Runshi Tang was a "Council-affiliated enterprise" Liu San had vigorously championed previously, so it couldn't be neglected either...

While calculating selected "sponsors," Zhang Yikun scribbled on paper, quickly compiling twelve merchant names. He passed the list around—since Liu Xiang had elevated sponsor selection to a political consideration, the Elders naturally had to review it, fully embodying "collective leadership."

"I understand our connections with these two pharmacies, but what use are drugstores at a wedding?" Zhang Yunmi asked, puzzled. "Their wares obviously aren't wedding necessities..."

"Useful—very useful." Du Yibin, who raised pangolins and possessed some traditional Chinese medicine knowledge, said, "After marriage comes childbirth. To conceive, women need menstrual regulation and qi and blood tonification. I propose we gift each couple nourishing medicines at the wedding to help them conceive early..."

"So it *is* about raising sons after all." Qin Ruiyu laughed.

"Exactly as it should be," Wang Jun declared enthusiastically. "Only with children does it become a family! And they'll all be children of the Council—the more the better."

Other projects found natural solutions through sponsorship. Dabo Shipping would provide flower boats for Pearl River night cruises. The Plaid Skirt Club would supply performances—several club luminaries had lobbied the Guangzhou government extensively for permission to perform publicly and "expand the influence of new arts." Now they'd finally secured a legitimate opportunity. Far from charging fees, they'd happily provide their own provisions.

The bridal chamber issue also found resolution during the meeting. After coordination, they designated several temple properties for "targeted rental" to newlyweds, with provisional one-year leases.

Cui Hantang, Chairman of the Guangzhou Religious Association, patted his belly contentedly. "I have plenty of older properties available—enough to accommodate at least a third. But temple properties are scattered and predominantly commercial. Many residential units are dilapidated, and repairs would cost substantially—Director Ai probably wouldn't approve expenditure—so we can only manage temporary arrangements. Long-term won't work." He glanced toward Ai Zhixin.

Cui Hantang had intended to "borrow the east wind," using this opportunity and General Office allocations to repair temple properties managed by the Religious Affairs Office. Hence his enthusiasm for Wang Jun's proposal to lend "temple properties" for naturalized citizens' marriages.

However, Ai Zhixin didn't take the bait, refusing to allocate repair funds. He stated that temple properties managed by the Religious Affairs Office had undergone corporate reform, and property maintenance should follow the "beneficiary pays for repairs" principle—raising funds independently. No logic supported General Office-funded repairs.

Ai Zhixin effectively ignored Cui's hints. He harbored no interest in such "money for prestige" activities. As Director of Finance and Taxation, the current fiscal situation offered little optimism. They relied entirely on primitive fiscal maneuvering to barely maintain stability.

Discussion continued, with others contributing ideas regarding venue decoration, procedures, and protocols. Enthusiasm mounted as they spoke, poised to transform the event into a grand ceremony "unprecedented and unrepeatable."

"Let's conclude here. We shouldn't consume excessive resources on this affair." Liu Xiang, observing Ai Zhixin's facial tics, curtailed everyone's boundless imagination. "We're all amateurs at ceremonial planning. Assign specific event activities to Fang Fei. Old Zhang will handle sponsorship organization." He stretched. "No rush on the wedding itself. Arranging housing first represents the urgent priority—obtaining the certificate makes them husband and wife; no need to await the wedding for consummation. We'll transform customs while we're at it!" He turned to Qin Ruiyu. "Your propaganda department needs to manage public opinion adeptly. Not merely newspapers—the role of guides must be fully utilized."
