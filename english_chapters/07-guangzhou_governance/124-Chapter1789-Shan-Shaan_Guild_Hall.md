# Chapter 1789 - Shan-Shaan Guild Hall

Li Ziyu was the patrol officer for the area, so naturally, he led the way. Following Wu Xiang's instructions, he first took him to the entrance of East Branch Alley 8, then to West Branch Alley 11, walking through all the crime scenes once.

Wu Xiang spoke very little along the way, only stopping to ask a few questions at certain places. But he didn't discuss anything specific. Just kept scrutinizing. Making Li Ziyu feel very mysterious.

Walking and stopping like this, all the way to the back door of Zhenbo Garden in East Branch Alley 8, Wu Xiang suddenly asked: "Where is this?"

Li Ziyu hurriedly said: "Section Chief Wu, this is the back door of the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall."

"Since it's a back door, why is the lock hanging on the outside?" He pointed at the door.

The door was larger than ordinary back doors, with double door leaves. Hanging on it was a cast iron padlock, covered in rust.

With this question, Li Zhenguo also suddenly realized he had missed a suspicious point. This was clearly the back door of the guild hall, how could the lock be locked on the outside?

In 17th century China, the locks commonly used by people were padlocks. The biggest difference between padlocks and modern locks like pin tumbler locks is that padlocks can only be opened and locked from one direction. Therefore, building doors have door bolts on the inside and do not use locks. Only when going out and leaving the house empty do people use a lock to lock the door from the outside.

Li Zhenguo knew that for back doors and corner gates of government offices, guild halls, and large households, although there were door bolts on the inside, they also had to be locked with padlocks at night. As for back doors that were generally not opened, they were locked by an iron general all year round. Locking from the inside like this was mainly for internal security needs, preventing people inside the building from privately communicating with outsiders, which could lead to theft and romantic affairs.

So it was a bit unfathomable that the back door of this Shan-Shaan Guild Hall was actually locked from the outside. Because in this way, if people inside the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall wanted to open the back door, they would have to come out from the main gate and go around a big circle to come to the back door to unlock it. This was too contrary to common sense.

Could it be that someone came out from the back door of the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall last night? This question appeared in the minds of both Wu Xiang and Li Zhenguo. As the saying goes: abnormality implies demons. Li Zhenguo looked carefully at the padlock. The lock was rusty, yet the area around the keyhole was shiny, obviously this lock had been opened recently.

"There's a problem with this lock!" Li Zhenguo said excitedly, "Someone definitely came out from here last night!"

Wu Xiang nodded and said: "It's hard to be sure if it was yesterday, but this is indeed a suspicious point."

Li Ziyu plucked up his courage and said: "Section Chief Wu, Comrade Li, this, doesn't count as... a suspicious point..."

"Oh?" Wu Xiang was immediately interested. This young patrol officer actually raised an objection immediately, "Let's hear it."

Seeing no sign of anger from him, Li Ziyu said cautiously: "It's true this is the back door of the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall, but actually it's the back door of Zhenbo Garden."

Since Zhenbo Garden had been relegated to a "haunted house", the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall naturally wouldn't use it for living after buying it, but specially assigned it a use "unafraid of ghosts", which was to temporarily store coffins.

When merchants do business and scholars travel for study, once they die in a foreign land, the guild hall of their hometown is obligated to handle their funeral affairs. So they often purchased charitable land. However, ancients placed the utmost importance on returning to their roots. Those who died in a foreign land, as long as conditions permitted, would have their coffins transported back to their hometown for burial. Some coffins were temporarily stored in temples and guild halls. Waiting for the day they could be transported back to their hometown. Therefore, larger guild halls often set aside a separate courtyard in a quiet place at the back to store coffins. Although there were not many merchants from Shaanxi and Shanxi in Guangdong, the guild hall also had such facilities.

Since coffins were to be stored, they couldn't be brought in and out through the main gate. Firstly, it hindered Feng Shui, and secondly, with people coming and going in the guild hall, seeing it would inevitably be unlucky. So they always entered and exited through the back door of Zhenbo Garden—boats on the river channel could be used directly.

Li Ziyu said that for the convenience of coffins entering and exiting, the padlock was always locked on the outside. Because of Zhenbo Garden's "reputation", it was almost completely isolated from the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall. Even people from the guild hall were unwilling to walk through Zhenbo Garden when going in and out.

"People transporting coffins bring them in from the back door and leave from the back door. Even the miscellaneous workers holding the back door key dare not walk through Zhenbo Garden back to the guild hall, preferring to go around from the back door and enter through the main gate. So this lock is always hung outside the door, not inside."

"Quite eerie." Wu Xiang nodded, feeling this patrol officer grasped the local situation very well. He asked again, "Who are the steward and the gatekeeper miscellaneous worker of the guild hall? Find them, I have something to ask."

Li Ziyu said: "This I don't know, the main gate of the guild hall is not in Scissors Alley..."

It turned out that the main gate of this Shan-Shaan Guild Hall opened onto the neighboring Incense and Medicine Alley. According to the division principle that wherever the main gate opens is the jurisdiction of that street, this large area in East Branch Alley 8 was not in Li Ziyu's jurisdiction.

Upon hearing his words, Wu Xiang immediately instructed to go to the Shanxi Guild Hall on Incense and Medicine Alley.

The group left South Scissors Alley and hurried to the main gate of the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall. Seeing the police arrive, the gatekeeper hurriedly called the steward out.

The steward was an "Old West" (Shanxi native). Having done business in Guangzhou for more than thirty years, he was half a native, only his Cantonese was never spoken very well. Hearing Wu Xiang speak "New Language" (Mandarin), he was actually relieved—compared to Guangzhou Mandarin, this New Language was easier to communicate in.

Hearing that the police wanted to ask about Zhenbo Garden, the steward was quite surprised. This was a "haunted house" well-known far and near in the city. Even people from the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall wouldn't go in during broad daylight if there was nothing to do. Besides, inside were all temporarily stored coffins. Ordinary people avoided them like the plague, what was there to see?

He said this Zhenbo Garden was indeed the property of the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall, but rarely did anyone go in. Including himself, he rarely went in once or twice. To speak of the specific situation inside, one had to ask Old Qi, the miscellaneous worker in the guild hall.

So Old Qi was called. What Old Qi said was the same as Li Ziyu. For the convenience of coffins accessing, he indeed entered and exited Zhenbo Garden from the outside. After finishing things, he would lock up and go around back to the guild hall from the outside. Wu Xiang then asked him why he didn't enter and exit from the guild hall side? Could it be there was no door between the guild hall and Zhenbo Garden?

"My lord, naturally there is a door, and this humble one also has the key. But that place has too heavy a yin energy, going in huge broad daylight feels ghostly..."

Opening the sandwich wall door from the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall allowed entry into Zhenbo Garden. But usually, even in broad daylight, Old Qi dared not walk this path alone. His preference was to take the long way around for peace of mind.

"Is the key to the sandwich wall door in your hand?" Wu Xiang pursued.

"Naturally," Old Qi said, "This key hangs in the gatehouse where this humble one lives. To be honest, this humble one gets scared looking at it, avoiding using it if possible."

"Is the key still there?"

"Yes, yes, no one steals this thing. I even saw it this morning."

"Who else has it besides you?"

"Master steward has one."

"What about the key to the back door?"

"It is the same, this humble one keeps one, master steward keeps one."

The steward said: "I don't have one." He added a sentence, "The one you use was originally mine."

Seeing the police puzzled, he explained that Old Qi only came last year. The original miscellaneous worker died during the plague last spring. At that time the epidemic was very severe, and many people in the guild hall fell ill. Those who hadn't caught the disease hurried to hide outside the city to avoid the plague. In the chaos, no one could attend to things. When they returned, the miscellaneous worker had already died of illness and was sent by the benevolent hall to the charitable tomb for burial. The several keys he carried also went missing—one of which was the key to the back door of Zhenbo Garden.

Li Zhenguo suddenly said: "Was this miscellaneous worker stationed in South Scissors Alley, and his wife called Wang Xiuzhu?!"

The steward blinked his eyes and said: "It's true he lived in South Scissors Alley. I don't know if his wife was called Wang Xiuzhu, but she was indeed surnamed Wang—she often came to the guild hall to do sewing and mending for people, people called her Auntie Wang..."

Li Ziyu almost cried out: Widow Wang's late husband was a gatekeeper and odd-job man, who died when the plague broke out last spring. So, Widow Wang's late husband was the miscellaneous worker of the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall!

In this way, the killing of Widow Wang had some connection with the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall. He remembered Gao Chongjiu said the murderer seemed to be looking for something in Widow Wang's house. Could it be the key to the back door?!

The murderer wouldn't look for a key for no reason. He needed this key inevitably to achieve some purpose... Could it be...

Wu Xiang and Li Zhenguo looked at each other. Li Zhenguo said: "We want to go into Zhenbo Garden to have a look."

The steward was somewhat embarrassed, saying: "This was originally nothing, only... only... it's getting late..."

Wu Xiang took out a pocket watch from his pocket. It was already five o'clock, but the days were long now, so the sun still looked very bright. He said: "It doesn't matter, it's not dark yet. We'll go in and have a look, if there's nothing we'll come out in a while."

Helpless, the steward had to tell Old Qi to open the door and take them into Zhenbo Garden.

Old Qi was a hundred times unwilling, but since the steward had ordered, he dared not disobey. Seeing several policemen here, thinking since they were police of the Great Song and had weapons with the Royal emblem, the murderous aura was heavy, probably able to suppress evil.

To save time, Wu Xiang instructed Old Qi to open the rear sandwich wall door and enter the garden from the guild hall side. Old Qi had no choice but to take the key and lead the way.

Old Qi led them winding and turning all the way to the rear sandwich wall. At the bottom of the sandwich wall was a small black lacquered door. The paint was peeling, the door was bolted, and a large padlock was also hung, already rusty, with Daoist talismans seemingly faintly visible on it. Over the wall, only large trees were seen densely, the tree shade covering the sky like a canopy.

"Over that wall is Zhenbo Garden." Old Qi said, inserting the key into the lock hole. Just as he was about to turn it, suddenly he trembled and screamed: "Oh God!"

Several policemen were startled. Li Zhenguo looked carefully and saw half a blurry black footprint beside the lintel of the small door!

Wu Xiang hurriedly moved closer to look. The footprint was very blurry, but judging from the size and shape, this should be a man's footprint. The footprint was very new, obviously left not long ago. Judging from the damp traces, maybe it happened last night or this morning!
