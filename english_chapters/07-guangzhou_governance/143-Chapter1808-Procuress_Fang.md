# Chapter 1808 - Procuress Fang

Madam Han Qiaojie said: "Father Fang, speaking this way is too formal. Yueque Street is everyone's rice bowl—one suffers, all suffer. If things really go that way, how can this business continue?"

"Mother is absolutely right. Originally these girls' prices were rising steadily. Now we're not even allowed to buy and sell women anymore—they're all 'self-employed' now—how are we supposed to do business?" The woman beside her chimed in to help.

The woman was in her early thirties, curvaceous and alluring, wearing a pink embroidered jacket over a green silk skirt. Her flower name was "Muyun"—she was the house's "dormitory matron." Muyun had come up as an old prostitute, a veteran of the pleasure trade. She had also been a discarded concubine from some gentry family, well-versed in upper-class manners and protocols. Madam Han had recruited her to train the young *pipa* girls.

A dormitory matron's competence directly affected the quality of future "money trees." Thus she was a figure of considerable importance in the establishment.

An older woman in her forties immediately simpered: "Sister Mu speaks true! Originally buying a little girl cost only three taels of silver. If you went to the charity hall for one, it was even free. Now it's unbelievable—eleven or twelve-year-old girls, if they're reasonably pretty, cost twenty or thirty taels right away from the traffickers! This is practically highway robbery!"

These prices were naturally known to Muyun—ever since the Australians came to Guangzhou and established charity halls, the good old days of giving a few strings of cash or a few *dou* of rice, or even just promising food to survive, and then freely picking and choosing girls wherever refugees gathered, were gone forever.

"If this continues, soon there won't even be any *pipa* girls!" Muyun felt some genuine anxiety. If there were no *pipa* girls, her actual livelihood would be cut off! Muyun depended on this work for her living. If it were abolished, she would be useless to the establishment. The theater was heartless about such things. Once Madam Han turned her face and refused to recognize her, she—a woman with no husband and no relatives—when her savings ran out, either she'd become a nun or she'd have to return to her old trade. At her age, that bowl of rice wouldn't be easy to eat.

The woman helping her didn't know her worries. She just kept echoing agreement. This woman's surname was Yao. She was also an old prostitute, but her looks were plain and her background coarse. After more than thirty years as a prostitute in lower-class brothels, she had risen to become a "client matron" through flattery and willingness to serve as the madam's running dog.

The client matron was nominally supposed to serve the established prostitutes, but actually functioned for surveillance and control. Madam Yao came from prostitute origins herself and knew the feelings and thoughts of prostitutes like the back of her hand. Her management therefore often hit the mark, earning her the nickname "The Iron." It meant that any difficult prostitute who fell into her hands would be "pressed flat." Her treatment of prostitutes was extremely fierce. When whipping "misbehaving" prostitutes, she felt no qualms, keeping count as she beat. As for good girls bought in who refused to submit to prostitution, her torment methods were even more varied. Her viciousness could be called ruthless and cold.

Madam Han didn't trust "the powder team"—she felt using women to manage women was more reliable. So she had recruited Madam Yao from the lower brothels to become head of the client matrons in her establishment.

Old Man Fang said slowly: "Madam Han, the Ming dynasty also forbade 'buying decent women for prostitution' before..."

Madam Han's eyes rolled. "That I naturally know. It's just that back then the authorities didn't like meddling, and no one was tactless enough to invoke that principle! Even if someone was that tactless, we had ways to handle it—"

Back then she had powerful patrons. Yamen runners and constables were all her old acquaintances. Whatever outrageous thing she did, she feared nothing. But now things were very different. Her backer currently didn't dare attract trouble and had specially sent someone to remind her to "make less trouble." As for familiar yamen runners and constables—some had been arrested with fates unknown, some had gone over to the Australians. Now they were all as well-behaved as shop apprentices.

Most critically, she had personally witnessed the Australians' swift, decisive, word-keeping methods—just considering how they had cleaned up this Yueque Street's sanitation, several madams and pimps had their buttocks bloodied, and the fines extracted totaled two or three hundred taels.

Old Man Fang saw her hesitant expression and knew what was on her mind. He laughed a few times: "New officials always burn a few fires when they take office." As he spoke, he glanced sideways twice. Madam Han understood. She immediately told Muyun and Madam Yao to withdraw.

Old Man Fang said: "You're a born pleasure-house child yourself. Don't you know these tricks—just call them adopted daughters. When they're grown, have them sign a document saying they willingly became prostitutes."

Madam Han sneered: "I thought you had some clever idea. This hardly counts as throwing dirt in people's eyes. In the old days it might have worked. Now it won't: buy a child, there has to be a body-sale contract. With that contract, it's buying women for prostitution. But without that contract, if she runs outside, what grounds do I have to retrieve her? Now isn't like before. If things blow up, I'll be the one in trouble."

Old Man Fang smiled: "You're clever all your life, confused for a moment. Even in the examination bribery cases, no one takes silver directly to bribe the examiners—they write IOUs. The body-sale contract can't be written now, but having her family write an IOU is easy enough, isn't it? Make the principal loan amount high enough, and you'll crush any thought of redemption. Even if her family prospers later, all those years of interest—haven't you earned anyway? If there's no family, it's even easier: false money, real contract—even if she works for you a lifetime she won't pay it off. You think she won't willingly write it?"

These words moved Madam Han. "That is indeed a method!" But on second thought, this method might look clever, but still required official tolerance to work. Now it was the Australians' territory. The police loved meddling most of all. If she encountered a few tough customers who made a scene, her rhetoric might not work. Though Old Man Fang looked like an unconcerned old gentleman, he was actually a shrewd operator. He surely didn't fail to think of this.

Could this old man have some backup plan in mind? She realized Old Man Fang had no special relationship with her. Being this enthusiastic about offering suggestions was rather unusual. Probing, she said:

"This method is good, but without official protection, if things really blow up, it still won't end well."

Old Man Fang sipped his cool tea: "Madam Han, don't you worry. Since I'm offering this idea, naturally I have a foolproof plan for the official side. I'll just ask you one question: what do you think of this idea?"

Madam Han privately thought there was really no other way—if she truly had to operate by this "ordinance," the money going to her coffers would decrease considerably. Moreover, the hearts of the girls in the establishment would become unstable. Quite a few might "go straight." This she absolutely could not accept. For now, she'd agree. See what he said.

She nodded: "That method is good. But officially there'll be expenses. Give me a figure—I need to weigh whether it's worth it."

Old Man Fang chuckled softly: "Madam Han is indeed straightforward. But I'm not entirely clear on the expenses—rest assured, it surely won't exceed the old standard fees."

Not exceeding the old standard fees meant it would be similar to what was previously given to the shift heads and runners as "regular payments." This wasn't unbearable. However, she still wasn't entirely reassured. In the old days, the senior men among the constables were all her old acquaintances. Now Old Man Fang's vague talk—who knew if he was telling the truth? She suddenly grew suspicious. Could this old man have lost at gambling, or become infatuated with some painted lady, spending more than he earned, and now, under cover of the Australians' new ordinance, was trying to swindle money?

Madam Han had operated brothels for many years. She had seen all manner of storms and characters. She knew well that human hearts were treacherous. Even friends of many years might flip the bowl on you—let alone someone like Old Man Fang. This had to be guarded against. Testing him, she said:

"Father Fang, rest assured. We've been neighbors for years—how could I trap you? It's just not time yet. When the time comes, I'll naturally show you the real deal."

Madam Han remained half-believing, half-doubting. She swept her sleeve: "Real deal or not we'll set aside. But I don't burn incense until I see the Buddha."

Old Man Fang nodded with a smile: "Understood, understood. Since I'm your temple keeper, managing incense-burning is my business. Just now I happen to have something that'll show you the real Buddha. Your back courtyard—isn't there a new girl just arrived?"

Madam Han started. She gave a cold laugh: "Father Fang, that you'd know isn't strange. So what?"

"This girl was brought by that little brat Wang Dong, right? That brat's got real nerve. The Australians have a bounty out for his father, and he still dares run around outside seducing women!" Old Man Fang said.

"So what if he did, so what if he didn't? I don't care who brought her."

"This counts as you buying a decent woman for prostitution." Old Man Fang narrowed his eyes and smiled. "But, as long as you follow the method I described, I guarantee you'll get the license within days."

According to the newly promulgated Guangzhou Vice Industry Management Ordinance, new prostitutes had to personally go to their local police station and declare their voluntary entry into the vice trade, then receive a special "yellow ticket" license. Otherwise it was illegal practice, and the madam and pimp would be held responsible. A girl like the one Wang Dong had brought could naturally never "voluntarily" become a prostitute—otherwise she wouldn't need to be tied up.

Madam Han was half-believing, half-doubting. Seeing Old Man Fang so confident, she reckoned this old man might harbor some greed but probably didn't have the gall to make an enemy of her by swindling—just try it first. She nodded: "Fine, let's do it your way!"
