# Chapter 2069 - The Counterfeiting Den

The door opened to reveal a flight of stone steps, leading downward. Hao An held the lantern high as they descended.

Below was a large underground chamber, lit by oil lamps placed at intervals along the walls. At a glance, one could see several large worktables, each occupied by craftsmen bent over their tasks. The air was thick with the smell of ink, paste, and paper—mingled with an undertone of damp and mildew.

Hao Er coughed lightly. Immediately, a foreman circulating among the workstations came over, murmuring, "Master has arrived!"

At the sound, the craftsmen rose from their seats and stood with hands at their sides.

Hao Er nodded, signaling them not to be overly formal. He asked the foreman, "How goes it? Still making progress?"

"Reporting to Master: the routine work proceeds smoothly, but *that* matter—we haven't made much headway."

"It's been months now, and still no progress?" Hao Er's face showed a flicker of disappointment. "Summon Master Zhang."

Master Zhang was a man of about forty, his hands roughened with calluses from years of working with paper and paste. Seeing the proprietor's summons, he hurried over.

"Master Zhang, how do things stand? Have you produced any samples yet?"

"Master! We... we have made some, but..." Zhang handed over two rectangular slips of paper, each about a dozen centimeters long. Hao Er took them and examined them.

The slips were covered in intricate, almost chaotic patterns—elaborate and convoluted designs, with "Finance Ministry Central Reserve Bank Currency Voucher" inscribed in regular script at the top. Beneath that, in slightly larger characters: "Exchangeable for One Silver Yuan."

"Master! This is the original you gave us," Old Zhang indicated one of the slips, then pointed to the other. "And this is the best copy the lads and I have managed over the past few days. But still..."

He shook his head, clearly unsatisfied.

Hao Er studied the two slips intently—now one, now the other—occasionally shaking them gently and noting the soft rustle.

"This isn't bad. Except... the paper feels a bit limp, lacking that crisp texture. But it's really quite close!"

Master Zhang laughed ruefully and shook his head again. "It's no good—not at all! This one was painstakingly hand-drawn by the lads over two days. Old Wang even aged it afterwards. Otherwise, it wouldn't pass even a casual glance! If we had to draw every one like this, we couldn't produce more than one in several days—and our eyes would give out!"

"If you can draw it, can't you engrave it?" Hao Er glanced at the craftsmen laboring at the benches. "If you can draw it..."

"Old Qian!" Master Zhang called out. "Bring over the new plate you carved—let the master take a look!"

A man named Master Qian answered and carefully carried over a large wooden board, setting it respectfully before Hao Er.

On the board lay several carved printing blocks, all the same size but with entirely different patterns.

Hao Er leaned in to examine the blocks as a manager hastily brought an Australian oil lamp closer.

As he looked, he traced the lines in the air with an iron stylus Old Zhang handed him.

"My... this is exquisite work indeed!"

There were four finished blocks in all, each bearing extremely fine engravings—patterns of extraordinary intricacy, twisting and coiling like vines entangled. The designs were complex enough, but the scale was even more daunting: in places, the engraved lines were barely thicker than a strand of hair.

Such craftsmanship made even the worldly Hao Er exclaim in admiration. "Old Qian, you truly are the master of your trade!"

"Alas, even I am at the end of my rope," Master Qian sighed. "Many of the finest details simply cannot be reproduced. I can only hope people won't scrutinize too closely."

"Let me see. Have you done any trial prints?"

"We have." Master Zhang retrieved a paper folder from a nearby drawer. "Once printed, we realized how far off we still are."

Hao Er took the folder and extracted the bills inside. At first glance, the size, color, and patterns seemed roughly correct. But the moment he held them, something felt off—even setting aside the quality of the paper, the design itself was unmistakably flawed.

"...It's hard to say exactly *what* is wrong, but even at a casual look, one feels the difference at once," Master Qian said bitterly.

Hao Er shared the sentiment. Compared to the genuine note, the counterfeit exuded a palpable crudeness. Though he couldn't pinpoint the exact flaw, placing the two side by side made the truth inescapable. The real bill had lines that seemed finer, more delicate; the patterns were subtly smaller; the colors varied in depth and luster, producing effects the forgery could never match.

"It's certainly difficult!" Hao Er had to admit—this was proving far harder than expected. He had already invested months into this counterfeiting enterprise, including a detour to produce a batch of forged tax stamps. Yet despite the immense outlay of manpower and resources, progress remained negligible.

A wave of frustration washed over him. He fell silent.

Seeing the master's displeasure, Master Qian hastily added, "Master! It isn't that we haven't applied ourselves—truly! The Australians' 'treasury notes' have patterns beyond imagination! Not only are the lines incredibly fine and dense, but they also shift between colors. Though only two inks seem to be used—blue and black—if you count carefully, just the border design alone employs three or four distinct shades! Some have luster, some do not. And then there are the constantly changing pattern variations. Each requires its own separate block. To replicate their designs perfectly would mean carving more than a dozen blocks—never mind whether we can even mix the right colors. And every block must align precisely; if even one prints crooked by a hair, the whole sheet is ruined."

Traditional woodblock color printing, constrained by materials and technique, could not employ too many colors; the results tended to look flat and blocky, incapable of gradual shading or nuanced light and dark. No matter how expertly Master Qian carved his blocks, the moment ink touched paper, the deception was exposed.

"Old Zhang, I think Old Qian's skills may not quite be up to this," Hao Er said quietly once Master Qian had stepped away. "The lines are too coarse. We need finer work still."

"Master, it's not his fault," Master Zhang hastened to defend his colleague. "These lines are simply too fine! Old Qian has the skill, but he can't engrave on wood at this scale."

Traditional blocks required hardwoods with dense, fine grain—fruitwoods like pear or jujube—so that carvings held true, took ink well, and lasted through many impressions. Naturally, Hao Er had secured the finest timber. But the wood's natural fibers set a limit: lines too fine simply could not be cut into it.

They had considered other materials. Guangzhou boasted skilled ivory carvers—masters who could etch minute patterns and even text onto tiny ivory ornaments and puzzle-balls. But ivory could not hold ink, nor could pieces large enough for printing blocks be obtained.

"Old Zhang!" Hao Er raised his eyes to the ceiling, his gaze wandering to some distant point as though seeing through the roof itself. "This is nothing like forging paintings or gambling tokens. If we can pull this off, not only will our past offenses be forgiven, but the imperial court will reward us with titles and ranks! And we can avenge Zhu Jian—and your Xiang Ming, too!"

"You mean the court also...?"

Hao Er nodded. "Stone Elder is aware of our work. He says our current methods won't succeed. So he has specially summoned two luminaries from Suzhou—the 'King of Blocks,' whose counterfeits can fool even experts, and 'Chaotic Brush Liu,' whose forged signatures and handwriting deceive even the originals themselves. They should arrive any day now."

"Master—you mean... the *faking genius* 'King of Blocks'? And 'Chaotic Brush Liu,' whose imitations of calligraphy are so perfect even the authors can't tell? Heavens! These two are..."

Hao Er smiled faintly. "Indeed, both are legendary figures in the 'Suzhou forgery' trade. But that's not all. Word is that the Lin family of 'Tribute Paper' and the Meng family of 'Master Inkmakers' are also sending representatives—men of no renown in our forging circles, perhaps, but their craft will be indispensable..."

Ever since they had begun this counterfeiting operation, the major hurdles—setting aside the block-carving—included the everyday consumables: paper and ink. Despite all their efforts, these problems remained only half-solved.
