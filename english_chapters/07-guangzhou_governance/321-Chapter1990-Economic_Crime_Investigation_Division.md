# Chapter 1990 - Economic Crime Investigation Division

"Think about it, Salina is a professional. In the past because she was a foreigner, she wasn't heavily used, always in roles like consultant or instructor. The so-called General Guard Bureau is also just a guard role. Now she is to be entrusted with heavy responsibility. Can we not utilize her skills well? Senator protection work is too waste of talent. Isn't proposing her to concurrently hold an economic crime investigation job fully exerting her specialty? Moreover with the Senate's nature, maybe they will combine two functions into one—isn't the Yankee Secret Service also a law enforcement unit of the Treasury Department? We also make a Treasury Secret Service; this law enforcement power will be secure."

Zhang Xiaoqi said: "Are you forgetting someone. If not listing him as candidate, will he have ideas?"

"Who?"

"National Police's; you really don't know?"

"Hehe." Wang Qiyi knew his wife referred to Pan Jexin who currently hosted police training work in Guangzhou. He was Director of National Police Criminal Investigation Division, said to have resigned to join transmigration because dissatisfied with work in old timeline. But dealing with him, Wang Qiyi could always feel this person had considerable understanding of economic problems. But what did this matter? Wang Qiyi felt his wife worried too much. "We don't care what he did before. Even assuming he came from Economic Investigation, so what? Coming to new timeline for so many years, he didn't mention past profession at all, obviously planning to hide it. Naturally won't jump out to drag hind legs on our plan."

"Then Salina? Do you think she is willing to come?" Wang Qiyi worried a bit.

"Hard to say. But I think compared to her current idle state in General Guard Bureau, she should like our Economic Crime Investigation Division more. After all very similar to IRS Criminal Investigation Division," Zhang Xiaoqi said.

"I just worry we spread the stall too big at once." Ai Zhixin always felt this plan was hard to get agreed by Soy Sauce crowd who had no awareness of being superiors.

"How to say," Wang Qiyi wrung his hands, "Reasonably speaking, what we apply do is what no one does now; no problem of snatching other departments' power. Otherwise waiting for accident to happen then panic? Of course, actually..."

"Actually, you aren't particularly confident either, right." Zhang Xiaoqi smiled while lifting teacup. "I saw it from that Tax Farming time. These people are like: I don't understand nor learn, I have no solution, anyway just curse. Technical details he can't beat you, he goes online [political/moral high ground] talking big principles. Big principles can't beat you, he simply acts rogue, saying anyway I am Senator, if not for doing whatever I want who comes to this broken place."

"Donglin Faction style!" Ai Zhixin said hatefully.

"Then what do you think? No way, this is reality." Wang Qiyi obviously didn't like this topic.

"I think our article is written too bureaucratic. Those few in Administration Council who understand are fine. Others, estimate will oppose without even looking," Zhang Xiaoqi said.

"Could it be..."

"When I was at the hall before, during festivals people also gave some small shopping cards. A few hundred yuan isn't much, nor asking you to do illegal things, just begging for smooth tax reporting, looking after small flaws..." Zhang Xiaoqi rolled eyes at husband, "Transmigrated and not Chinese anymore?"

Running Ministries, actually they all understood. Senate system was Center Grasping All. Doing any project required applying to "Center." So since Administration Council and Planning Academy were set up, Running Ministries became the only way for Senators wanting to do projects.

"This matter is a bit big. Institution setting isn't one department's matter," Wang Qiyi rubbed chin, "Departments to run are many, also involving many Senators' stance and attitude. This probably isn't a matter of few hundred yuan shopping cards..."

The three understood the tricks inside, but these words were truly taboo right now. Previous stage Senate just passed anti-corruption document in Second Plenary Session, so Cheka was very busy. Although Political Security Bureau hummed and hawed, black materials in hand were plenty—naturally, everyone knew Political Security Bureau didn't do "Senator Reconnaissance," didn't do "Profile of Hundred Officials." But monitoring whether naturalized citizen cadres were "loyal" was its main work. If Senator had movement, nearby naturalized citizen cadres would always be touched. As long as investigation filed, Senator would also get messy.

"This matter, I see only few hundred yuan shopping cards..." Ai Zhixin silenced for long time, said, "Investing too much isn't worthwhile."

Ai Zhixin set the tone. Wang Qiyi couple said no more, even secretly sighed in relief.

Ten-plus days later, Ai Zhixin brought back Administration Council's formal approval document from Lingao. Plan was changed seven bits and eight pieces. Wang Qiyi knew roughly from Ai Zhixin's telegram early on. Fortunately Cheng Dong coordinated with key Police and Legal bigwigs Ran Yao and Ma Jia in advance, satisfying their modification requests on part authority, and asked support from Wu De who had good relation. Plus aspect of strengthening social management fit Secretary of State Ma's taste. Modified plan passed with shock but no danger.

However in formal approval document, Economic Crime Investigation Division's authority scope was narrowed to key striking four items: disturbing economic management order, financial fraud, endangering tax collection and management, obstructing normal management of companies/enterprises. Striking manufacturing/trafficking counterfeit currency and smuggling were changed to cooperating with Police, Customs work.

In authority, Investigation Division possessed all powers of tax administrative investigation and tax criminal investigation, entitled to exercise all investigation rights. But in mandatory power, changed from originally can summon suspects and witnesses, arrest criminal suspects, to 24-hour summoning and interrogation right. Arrest right Ran Yao and Ma Jia both insisted could only belong to police. Of course considering backward communication and tight manpower in this plane, temporarily County/City level Police Bureau where Investigation Division located would issue serial-numbered blank arrest documents for Investigation Division to use anytime, but must report to same-level Police Bureau afterwards. Wait until timing mature then adopt case-by-case application method.

As for execution right, Investigation Division entitled to decide search, seizure, sealing of involved houses, goods, transport tools etc. movable and immovable properties, but no disposal right of confiscation and auctioning movable/immovable properties.

Cases needing judicial prosecution must be transferred to Procuratorate to handle. Considering Procuratorate only had one Senator Shen Ruiming now, suggested Finance and Tax Bureau dispatch professional cadres to hang post in Procuratorate specifically dealing with economic cases.

"Authority narrowed a bit. But we have few people. Counterfeit currency and smuggling cases, fear can't bear in short time. Better be a consultant role."

Anyway, institution was built finally. Ai Zhixin encouraged everyone to look forward, pay attention to work methods. Plan passing this time was largely because they low-key limited Economic Crime Investigation Division to internal organ of Finance and Tax Bureau secondary unit. Finance and Tax Bureau as department with independent personnel organization right, according to Third Plenary Senator Conference resolution details, establishing secondary unit only needed filing to Administration Council. Cheng Dong specifically coming to Administration Council to apply approval was already giving considerable importance (after all filing and approval differed much in efficacy when dealing later), no need to tear face with vast Soy Sauce crowd at General Assembly.

"These aren't key. Now Administration Council approved doesn't mean no one tears with you later. Administration Council ultimately listens to Senator General Assembly. We will continue briefing everyone on this issue. Premier Cheng told me before leaving, want us to quickly bring out that Senator Foundation plan discussed before, letting those guys know backdoors are opened early for them leaving enough immunity. Save them always feeling a supervision organ targets them," Ai Zhixin said.

"This is easy to say. Director?"

"I talked with Ming Lang of Organization Division. He said no more position restrictions on Salina now. As long as she is willing she can serve. He will help us hand relevant documents to Salina personally for confirmation."

"You say will she accept?"

"Why not?" Ai Zhixin asked back with assurance. "Being idle for so many years, now having a serious job able to exert talent, can she be unhappy?"

"Hard to say, my Director Ai." Wang Qiyi shook head. "Why promoted her to General Guard Bureau Director initially? Plainly speaking wasn't it because she leaned on no side? Everyone felt safe. She leaves, swap who to be this guard? Even if she wants to come, above may not agree."

Ai Zhixin stunned for a while, said: "Talk later. Anyway I proposed the candidate. If they disagree, find another one. Someone must go up."

Sure enough, this matter of Salina taking office had no follow-up after report went up. This Investigation Division temporarily had to be led by Wang Qiyi. The glorious task of this Guangzhou Number One Tax Case fell on his shoulders.

Although with Wang Qiyi's depth, this case probably wasn't too complex. But his years of cultivation told him things wouldn't be so simple.

Since ancient times, using big cases to strike dissidents was a consistent method. The Senate naturally couldn't be exempt from vulgarity. Back then Mao Family case was used to strike a large batch of big households inside and outside city. Now Noble Gathering case, from grasped materials, might involve many gentry inside and outside Guangzhou city.

Whether oneself should just do official business, or engage in wide implication. This depended on Grand Magistrate Liu and others' "Temple Calculation." Wang Qiyi pondered again and again, decided to meet Liu Xiang first, fully listening to his opinion.

"Help me appoint meeting with Mayor Liu, also Director Lin, Chief Mu." He said to Office Secretary. "Right, and Director Wu."
