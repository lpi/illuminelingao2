# Chapter 1678 - Qiongzhou Prefecture City

"Because they got used to poverty! Old habits are hard to break." Yun Suji said, "The level of social civilization has prerequisites: only when granaries are full do people know rituals and etiquette. We can't talk about full granaries yet; we just let everyone eat their fill. The road of civilization and enlightenment is still long."

"The whip and the gallows are still the most reliable for promoting social civilization and progress."

They talked until they ended outside Qiongzhou City. Dugu Qiuhun summarized: "Consumed so many motorcycle hours, and the Army still hasn't settled the bill."

He only said this puzzling sentence, and the naturalized cadres of the Qiongshan County Office were already welcoming them at the courier station. Dugu Qiuhun did not enter the city; he took two two-wheeled carriages and drove straight to the ferry by the Nandu River to cross to Wenchang County.

The next morning, Yun Suji woke up to the chirping of thrushes. He stayed at the Qiongshan County Office Guesthouse. According to the Second Five-Year Administrative Plan, the future Hainan Regional Government would be located in Qiongshan County, so it wouldn't take long for this place to become the Regional Guesthouse.

The County Office Guesthouse was located in Renhe Ward inside the prefecture city. On the outside, it was a grand residence with deep courtyards, but inside was a different world. The Class-A guest rooms where Yun Suji stayed were all independent courtyards. It was renovated by Guangzhou Purple-label craftsmen according to Senator reception standards. The cooks serving in the guesthouse canteen were also from the commercial hall restaurants in Lingao, naturalized employees trained in modern culinary arts.

Since the Senate issued clean government regulations, reception had also shrunk. Last night, the Senator Director of the Qiongshan County Office gave him a "welcome dinner," but it didn't reach the "four dishes and one soup" standard; many famous local grand dishes were missing.

"Chief, you're awake?" Jin Xishan's voice came from the washroom. Sound of splashing water came from inside, probably washing clothes. Following the voice, Jin Xishan had already walked out, quickly came to the bedside, picked up the clothes he took off last night, and attended to him getting dressed.

"There are attendants here. Just put the clothes in the laundry basket and give them to wash."

"They are all intimate garments; how can I let them wash them? Besides, there are your clothes, Chief. Their work is rough; it would be a waste to ruin them." Jin Xishan said while nimbly taking off his sleeping robe and changing him into a cotton shirt.

Yun Suji stood still, enjoying her service—not only Jin Xishan, but his proper wife Liu Meilan also served his daily life decently and satisfactorily. He felt this place was truly a man's paradise—he wondered how Old Zhang managed to mess it up?

After helping him dress, Yun Suji moved to the washroom. It was completely "Australian-style" decoration, with a basin, flush toilet, and shower all available. Jin Xishan had prepared mouthwash, tooth powder, and face washing water.

Yun Suji picked up the toothbrush made of horsehair with an ivory handle, dipped it in tooth powder in a box carved from rhinoceros horn, and brushed his teeth in front of the mirror. He couldn't help sighing secretly: Where could one enjoy such a life in the old spacetime! Except for his mother, no woman would be so good to him, a petty clerk.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Jin Xishan waiting respectfully with a towel, and suddenly felt a little guilty.

Senator Yun had a harmonious family these few years and no domestic disputes. Although Liu Meilan had the "self-awareness of a lady from a big family" and could be called virtuous, it was also thanks to Jin Xishan being submissive wholeheartedly, always lowering her eyebrows and pleasing the eye in front of Liu Meilan.

Therefore, Yun Suji always felt he owed her. Coming for the squatting investigation this time, he conveniently brought her out for sightseeing and relaxation. The newly formulated "Senator Discipline Regulations" clarified that Senators could bring Life Secretaries on business trips within Hainan, so people wouldn't gossip.

He spat out the mouthwash, and a hot, wrung towel was handed over. Yun Suji took it, glanced inadvertently, and saw Jin Xishan with a head of black hair combed into a ponytail, the hair tips on her forehead carefully curled into bangs, wearing a neatly ironed maid uniform. There was a unique sense of clean and efficient beauty.

Involuntarily, his heart stirred. Although "wife is not as good as concubine," in reality, he had cohabited with Jin Xishan for three or four years, and the freshness was long gone. Liu Meilan was a model of "abiding by women's morals" and never created conflict over which bedroom the man slept in, but Jin Xishan's looks and figure were inferior to Liu Meilan, and her opportunities to receive "favor" were also much fewer. This was one of the reasons Senator Yun always felt he let Jin Xishan down.

However, looking at Jin Xishan today, he found that this southern girl bought for carnal desire back then had unknowingly grown into maturity and beauty. Her slightly dark skin instead highlighted a healthy beauty. He couldn't help pulling her into his arms, one hand around her fragrant shoulder, the other lifting her skirt hem, groping inside, kissing her forehead, eyes, and cheeks... kissing passionately.

Jin Xishan was startled, instantly turning soft under his caress, whispering: "Chief... don't..."

"What Chief? Call me Master!" Jin Xishan wasn't used to calling him Chief when she first received his favor; when lost in passion, she always called him "Master," which became a boudoir secret between the two.

"Master, under broad daylight, people will hear..."

"Hear what? It's only six o'clock. Besides, outsiders can't enter this courtyard. Come, let Master love you properly."

...

Eating breakfast an hour later than scheduled, Yun Suji took people out to visit the prefecture city. Before getting into the sedan chair, he saw an old well with grooves worn by ropes at the mouth in front of the house, named "Danye Well." The accompanying cadre said that since ancient times, the prefecture city had a saying of "Seven Wells, Eight Alleys, Thirteen Streets," and this well was one of the "Seven Wells."

Yun Suji's first stop of inspection was the Five Lords Temple (Wugong Temple), also known as the "First Tower of Hainan." It was built in the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty to commemorate five famous officials banished to Hainan during the Tang and Song dynasties: Li Deyu, Li Gang, Zhao Ding, Li Guang, and Hu Quan. Near the Five Lords Temple were Xuepu Hall, Five Lords Vihara, Guanjia (Watching Crops) Hall, Sugong Temple, arch bridges, lotus ponds, wind pavilions, and Qiongyuan Garden, forming a group of Lingnan-style ancient buildings.

Wherever Yun Suji went in the Five Lords Temple, it was quiet. The people managing the ancestral hall were already waiting respectfully. He was a Senator, and for the natives who realized that Qiongzhou Prefecture had changed dynasties, naturally knew his weight. Immediately someone led the way and introduced.

However, this Five Lords Temple was just a courtyard with no magnificent scenery to view. It was also in disrepair for years, with dilapidated and falling parts everywhere. Yun Suji felt uninterested.

Walking out, the accompanying cadre said that among the "Seven Wells, Eight Alleys, Thirteen Streets," every street and alley had its own history and legend. Many neighborhoods were famous because people lived there. For example, Dashi Alley was named after famous gentry like Zheng Tinghu, a director of the Ministry of Works' Waterways Bureau in the Ming Dynasty, and Zhong Fang, the "Great Confucian of Lingnan"; Jinhua Village and Zhujuli were visited by many tourists from the mainland because Qiu Jun and Hai Rui came from there.

Just like this, Yun Suji toured Qiongzhou Prefecture City cursorily in the morning. Qiongzhou was originally a county seat. In the second year of Hongwu (1369), Sun An, Vice Minister of War, led more than a thousand officers and soldiers to station on Qiong Island. Qiongzhou was subsequently upgraded to a prefecture, with the prefecture governance located in the prefecture city, having jurisdiction over the entire Hainan, starting to be called "Prefecture City" (Jun Cheng). The prefecture city expanded its enclosure and built city walls again. Nine years later, the Prefecture City took shape, with a circumference of 1253 zhang, height of 2.7 zhang, thickness of 2.8 zhang, 1843 battlements, 57 storehouses, opening three gates in the east, south, and west. The East Gate was originally Chaoyang Gate, later changed to Yongtai Gate; the South Gate was called Jingnan Gate; the West Gate was called Shunhua Gate. The Prefecture City, like Lingao County City, had no North Gate but built a city wall tower called Wanghai Tower. In the 17th year of Hongwu (1384), Sang Zhao, Commander of Hainan Guard, added an earthen city wall of 380 zhang outside the West Gate as a sub-city, and the city defense system was thus finalized.

He walked to the Drum Tower on Gulou Street between the South Gate of the city wall and the Prefecture Yamen. The accompanying cadre said a few words to the gatekeeper, and he swaggered up the stone steps of the Drum Tower, touching the moss-covered, scarred walls and the dilapidated house on the Drum Tower.

Seeing the sea of roofs before his eyes, he found it hard to imagine that this used to be the first choice for many local literati in Hainan to climb high and gaze far, reciting poetry and composing couplets.

The accompanying cadre reported to Yun Suji: Calculated according to the new system, the city wall was more than 4,100 meters long, more than 9 meters high, and more than 6 meters wide, with three city gates in the east, west, and south, and four corner towers, possessing sub-cities, moon cities (barbicans), and moats. After speaking, he pointed out the location of the small alleys and streets in the prefecture city for the Chief, such as East Gate Street, West Gate Street, South Gate Street, etc.

Yun Suji found that: because the Eastern District gathered institutions like Prefecture Yamen, County Governance, and Prefecture School, its functions were political, cultural, religious, etc., so there were Beidi Alley, Shangshu Street, Renhe Ward, Xianqian (County Front) Street, Xianhou (County Back) Street. There were also some uniquely named roads like Ma'an (Saddle) Street, Datie (Blacksmith) Street, Xiuyi (Embroidery) Ward.

"Where is Qiongtai Academy?" Yun Suji asked.

As the cultural center of Hainan for a thousand years, the refined atmosphere of Qiongzhou Prefecture City nurtured countless literati and heroes. "Three worthies in one Li, three Jinshi in five Li" was the most apt description of the talents emerging in the prefecture city during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Famous figures also enthusiastically promoted education and learning. At that time, the prefecture city not only had Prefecture Schools and County Schools but also Charity Schools and Private Schools for the children of some common people to study. Qiongtai Academy was established in the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, becoming the highest institution of learning in Qiongzhou. Last year, the Senate supported the Moli Studio model in Haikou and built it in advance.

"Chief, in the north. Outside the city wall." The cadre handed him a telescope.

In the lens, he saw a patch of white walls and red tiles by the sea, appearing to occupy an area even larger than Fangcaodi. What Yun Suji didn't know was that Mei Wan originally wanted to build the academy directly at the location of the Haidian Campus of Hainan University in the original spacetime, but was opposed by Qiongshan cadres who planned an industrial zone for Haidian, so it was changed to the south of Haidian, facing it across the river. This school had been built, and enrollment was underway. In the future, it could accommodate more than five hundred boarding students.

The cadre emphasized: "Construction standards are the same as Fangcaodi."

"Where is Xiuying Port?"

"Where is Baishashuizhai?"

He looked around again, ordered someone to take out the map for comparison, and couldn't help having a plan for the future farm location.

"This farm, let's call it Evergreen Park (Wanlvyuan)."
