# Chapter 1691 - Investigation Continued

"So much jealousy?"

"Because she couldn't give birth to a son—not just a son, she didn't even bear a daughter!" Old Yang threw his head back and poured the last bit of gravy into his mouth, wiping his lips. "Wouldn't that mother and son be anxious?"

"Does beating a wife make her give birth?" Yun Suji wondered what kind of logic this was.

His wife spoke up at this moment: "I heard the women say that Gaifeng's man was useless, that's why she couldn't interpret a son..."

Old Yang scolded: "What nonsense are you spouting! Learning to chew your tongue without any evidence, is your butt itching again?"

Old Yang's wife was scared into silence.

Yun Suji said: "Old Yang, that's not right of you. You just said yourself that you don't beat your wife. Are you going back on your word now? Are you a man or not!"

Old Yang hurriedly said: "Yes, yes, Chief, I was confused!"

Yun Suji thought that this meal had been very fruitful. He felt that what Old Yang's wife said was likely the truth; women knew women's affairs best. He asked Old Yang's wife again: "What else do you know?"

Old Yang's wife dared not speak. Yun Suji said: "Don't worry! I'll make decisions for you in everything. I definitely won't let your man whip your bare bottom, otherwise I'll have my guards use a carrying pole to whip his bottom!"

Old Yang laughed heh-heh and said: "Go ahead and say it, go ahead. I'll pretend I didn't hear."

Only then did Old Yang's wife say: "...Heard it was an illness left over from when fleeing the disaster! Speaking of which, it's pitiful too!"

"Didn't seek some medicine to take?" Yun Suji thought of Runshitang, the old shop specializing in nourishing yin and tonifying yang.

"Look at what you're saying, us farm people rely on the word 'endure' when we get sick, let alone how could he mention that kind of illness to anyone?"

Old Yang's wife continued: "He was pitiful, but isn't Gaifeng even more pitiful? Us women talk together usually: Gaifeng was a living widow, and on top of that, Gaifeng's mother-in-law is a shrew. When Gaifeng's dead ghost of a husband was away on corvée labor, and she went to the fields alone during the day, Old Lady Cao would give her, give her..."

Old Yang's wife stopped speaking. Yun Suji asked in confusion: "Give her what?"

Old Yang's wife forced a smile: "It's all women's matters, saying it would soil your ears!"

Yun Suji said: "It doesn't matter, tell me."

"She used needle and thread to sew her trousers shut tightly. If a few threads were broken when she came home at night, she would be pressed onto a bench and beaten! Gaifeng was so scared she didn't even dare to drink an extra mouthful of water. every day when she came home her face was blue from holding it in. A few times she even peed directly in her trousers, sigh, truly committing a sin..."

This was too vicious. Yun Suji couldn't help but be stunned; wasn't this a poor man's version of a chastity belt? He had thought only European nobles played with that stuff.

"Old Lady Cao is also from a poor background, right? treating a daughter-in-law so cruelly?"

"If not a poor family, how would there be a child bride? A child bride in a poor family is bitterer than goldthread! Truly not even as good as a rough servant girl in a small landowner's family!" Old Yang sighed, "When we were back in our hometown, during the spring famine when we couldn't go on, someone proposed calling Blackie to go be a child bride for someone. I said I'd rather let her starve to death at home than let her be tormented to death by someone! Now at least the world has changed!"

Old Yang's wife continued: "...After Gaifeng's dead ghost of a man passed away, she was afraid Gaifeng would remarry and watched her even tighter. Not only did she sew her trousers when going out, she even followed her when eating and going to the latrine at home, and made Gaifeng sleep on the inside when sleeping."

After dinner, Old Yang's wife cleared away the dishes and brewed a pot of sour date leaf tea. Yun Suji asked: "Her son is gone, what use is a daughter-in-law? Watching her so tight, what's the point?"

"A young widow is valuable." Old Yang laughed, "Nowadays, marrying a young widow costs a large sum of betrothal gifts too. Like Gaifeng, young, no drag-along bottles [children], she'd cost at least three cows in betrothal gifts."

"Since she covets the betrothal gifts, why not hurry up and find someone to match her with? Can holding her in hand produce a grandson?"

"How long can three cows last?" Old Yang said, "She's thinking of a long-term plan."

"What long-term plan? Planning to recruit a husband to support her?"

Old Yang slapped his thigh: "Chief, you really predict things like a god! Old Lady Cao wants to recruit a distant nephew from her maiden family—fertile water doesn't flow into outsiders' fields."

Yun Suji laughed: "Since she wanted to recruit, how come she didn't succeed?"

"The man is serving as a soldier on Jeju Island, who knows when he'll come back?" Old Yang said, "At this juncture, Liu Yuanhu took a fancy to Gaifeng..."

"Wait, wait, didn't you say Liu Yuanhu didn't snatch the widow?"

"He indeed didn't snatch her, it was Gaifeng who was willing to go with him herself." Old Yang's wife interrupted, "Liu Yuanhu has no in-laws at home, is a cadre himself, and also a strong young lad, could Gaifeng not be happy?"

Old Yang's wife then enthusiastically gossiped a bit: how the two caught each other's eyes, how they met secretly, and how they hid in the woods to kiss, "that was called dry wood and raging fire"... as if she had witnessed it all herself. Yun Suji thought: women's gossip ability is indeed extraordinary.

"...Last month, I think, Gaifeng gathered up her belongings, and taking advantage of Old Lady Cao not paying attention, ran to Liu Yuanhu's house. By the time Old Lady Cao came to her senses, the two had already run to the town to get a 'marriage certificate' and come back. It's considered completely out in the open."

Liu Yuanhu's policy level isn't bad, Yun Suji thought. Rural areas have always been very indifferent to getting certificates; even in the 21st century, there represent plenty of couples who just hold a banquet and don't get a certificate. Liu Yuanhu getting a marriage certificate directly solidified the legal relationship. He didn't serve as a village cadre for nothing.

He said: "Old Lady Cao must be unhappy then."

"That's natural. If it were anyone else, this matter definitely wouldn't have succeeded! Old Lady Cao is a master of making a fuss! But Liu Yuanhu is a bachelor, with no kin, a rash fellow, and used to throwing his weight around as a cadre in the village. Let alone a lonely old woman, I think he'd dare beat even his own parents! What good could Old Lady Cao get by making trouble? After suffering losses a few times, she didn't dare seek out Liu Yuanhu anymore. She went to Fan Twelve to complain—Chief, think about it: Liu Yuanhu and Fan Twelve wish they could wear one pair of trousers, would he help her? Besides, back when it was about Gaifeng binding her feet, Fan Twelve and Old Lady Cao had plenty of disputes. So not only did she not get her daughter-in-law back, she was given small shoes to wear—she was sent to the Thousand Women Embankment construction site for a few months. Old Lady Cao couldn't swallow this breath, so she went directly to the township to sue..."

"Oh? Going to the township to sue too?" Yun Suji thought, so there are petitioners in this timeline too.

"She went a few times. The township said since her daughter-in-law's man had already died, she could marry whoever she wanted, the township couldn't control it." Compared to Old Yang, his wife's news was much more well-informed. "She couldn't sue at the township, so she went to the county to sue, and the county ignored her too—this time she was dizzy with anger. All day long in the village she says the village swallowed her pension money, snatched her daughter-in-law, and even took many things Fan Twelve did and talked about them everywhere on the street..."

Old Yang felt this wasn't quite appropriate and winked at his wife, which was seen by Yun Suji. Yun Suji smiled: "What, still have concerns?"

Old Yang was a bit embarrassed: "To tell the truth, Fan Twelve and the others, sometimes they do things unethically, act rashly! But everyone is still fellow villagers, and he has done a lot for everyone. Some things, when doing them at first, we didn't think were useful and everyone cursed, but afterwards we felt they were truly useful, it was our vision that wasn't far-sighted. If really make a fuss and send him to the labor reform team, I wouldn't feel easy about it either..."

Yun Suji said: "So Fan Twelve still has merit for the village?"

Old Yang nodded: "If you say he has no selfish motives and is whole-heartedly for everyone, he isn't a saint. He has selfish motives, eating more and taking more is inevitable, and playing the tyrant, tying people up and beating people is also common. But our village can't do without such a person. Just take the roads inside and outside the village, the water diversion canals, and the biogas digesters for collecting fertilizer... without him worrying about it, those definitely couldn't be done. Surrounding villages all envy our village for having a capable person as village head."

Yun Suji asked again: "What's the matter with Old Lady Cao saying the village swallowed her pension money?"

"Only she herself knows this, Fan Twelve probably knows too." Old Yang said, "The pension money was indeed collected by Liu Yuanhu from the township and handed to the village office. As for whether Old Lady Cao received it, or how much she received, it's a case of the public saying the public is right and the woman saying the woman is right. I can't figure it out either."

"Did Gaifeng ever receive pension money?"

" could she touch a single copper coin?" Old Yang sneered, "Gaifeng was just a slave in her husband's family—not even as good as a slave, masters still give slaves monthly money and monthly rice. It would be considered good if she could eat a few full meals!"

Old Yang's wife also said: "Since marrying Liu Yuanhu, her complexion has improved a lot! She also has a smile when working together with everyone."

Yun Suji had roughly understood the whole story. This was completely different from what he had originally thought. It seemed that listening to only one side wouldn't do; "bitter suffering and deep hatred" didn't necessarily mean the embodiment of justice. Although Fan Twelve, Liu Yuanhu and these people couldn't be called "clean and honest," Old Lady Cao was not "innocent" or "persecuted" either. The truth of the matter is always more complex than the appearance.

He felt he had gained a lot at Old Yang's house, so he continued to chat. Seeing his high interest in talking, Old Yang added another wick to the oil lamp, unaware that the night was already deep.

Suddenly, rapid footsteps "thump thump thump" sounded outside. A guard ran in sweating profusely. Seeing Yun Suji, he didn't even have time to salute, gasping: "Re... Report... Chief: Cao... Cao..."

Yun Suji was startled and quickly asked: "Old Lady Cao?"

The guard nodded repeatedly: "Hanged... hanged... hanged herself!"

Yun Suji stood up with a start and said: "Go, let's hurry and take a look!"

When Yun Suji rushed to the entrance of the village office, he saw a circle of people already surrounding the entrance, noisily craning their necks to watch the excitement. Liu Yuanhu and a few young men were maintaining order. Fan Twelve's face was pale, standing at the door looking completely out of his wits. Seeing Yun Suji come over, he said in an almost pleading tone: "Chief! Chief! It really has nothing to do with me..."

"If it has nothing to do with you, what are you panicking for!" Yun Suji said, "Go, let's go in and take a look first!"
