# Chapter 1698 - Summary

"Little Yun," Du Wen pushed the black-rimmed glasses on her nose, stood up from behind the desk, and walked hurriedly a few steps in the room. "Your report is very good! I've already spoken to the Truth Office. *Morning Star* will publish the full text of your report—not the eight-legged essays in the Times."

When she said this, Stalin's gaze was staring at Yun Suji from the plaster bust on the desk. Yun Suji felt a bit uncomfortable, not because of the Iron Man comrade's gaze, but the address "Little Yun" really spoiled his appetite.

"It's decent," Yun Suji hid his emotions. "Go down to look more, and you'll have everything."

"The problem is that no one is willing to go down and look! Every one of them thinks of being a bureaucrat, being a lord!" Du Wen said resentfully. "I knew this bunch of petty bourgeoisie couldn't accomplish anything..."

Yun Suji didn't want to discuss this issue deeply. He leaned forward slightly: "If there's nothing else..."

"No, I still have words to say." Du Wen sat down on the chair again. "This time Senators going to the countryside, in my opinion, has more symbolic significance than practical significance. But even so, it's enough to let Senators know what the real countryside looks like. Avoid building carts behind closed doors all day."

"Right, right." Yun Suji nodded.

"What I worry about most now is that after Senators go to the countryside, every one of them will have an outbreak of 'Holy Mother Disease'." Du Wen put on a worried look. "After a symposium, Senators' ears soften, and upon return they blather about 'farmers are too hard, burdens are too heavy,' constraining our industrial society's reasonable capital construction requirements, and wanting some let-nature-take-its-course pastoral poetry."

Yun Suji nodded.

"If this goes on, in the end, it will still be a resurgence of old ways: the whole village idling, squatting at the village entrance with a big bowl for half a day after eating, big girls and young wives gathering to stitch shoe soles and chat about 'Zhang family's long and Li family's short' causing clouds of gossip to rise, men gambling, fighting, and beating wives... I know rural life very clearly. Traditionally in our place, there are two crops a year in rural areas. Often planting, harvesting, and field management accumulate to just two months of busy farming, and ten months of idle rest. Now giving a bit more corvée labor is just right to leave them no time to beat wives..."

Perhaps she noticed a trace of a smile at the corner of Yun Suji's mouth, Du Wen continued: "Comrade Little Yun, don't think I oppose beating wives out of feminist thinking. Beating wives is a manifestation of shameful patriarchal society, but its rampancy in rural areas fully proves that farmers are still very idle! Look, worker families rarely have this thing. Didn't you say that in the villages visited, there were many cases of wife-beating and adultery? Therefore, the corvée labor provided is still not enough!"

Yun Suji said: "Personally, I think the amount of corvée labor is open to question. The current total amount of corvée labor may not have reached the lower limit yet, but there are still quite a few problems in labor distribution, with situations of abuse and unfair assignment. In addition, some labor arrangements lack scientific nature; assigning military shoes by head count is one. I communicated with the Joint Logistics Department; the quality of military shoes assigned is universally not high, and cutting corners is very serious. Also, corvée labor should still be performed nearby. If it's too far, not only will it take up time on the journey, but farmers also have to bring dry rations and luggage for the road, increasing the burden on farm households."

"These are all details and can be fine-tuned." Du Wen said, "But the keynote of rural work cannot change! We must educate them to change old concepts, customs, and backward lifestyles. Otherwise, once backward and dilapidated habits and concepts resurface, sufferings like 'famine, death, displacement' will immediately reincarnate. The true meaning of life is 'one must work upon birth for days to be prosperous and guaranteed,' adding bricks and tiles to the faith guidance of 'the Senate saves and leads the whole world.' Some Senators represent already saying that my running study classes and engaging in movements is simple and crude—indeed there are individual cases of going overboard, I admit this, but the general direction is not wrong! For the Senate to realize the Technology Rapid Rise Second Five-Year Plan and territorial expansion, we must transform society, with efficiency prioritized in development!"

"Yes, yes, I feel so too." Seeing Du Wen getting agitated, Yun Suji couldn't help shrinking back a bit.

"So our viewpoints are the same then."

"On the issue of rural work, my view is the same as yours." Yun Suji nodded. This wasn't just echoing; to realize various grand wishes and aspirations from the beginning of the crossing, they had to work more efficiently than other systems: whether from the efficient extraction of surplus products, constraining the alienation and expansion of bureaucratic corruption, inhibiting the involution tendency of grassroots control, or climbing the tech tree and expanding industrialization, it was all like this.

"Our Secretary of State Ma said: 'A large part of the surplus products occupied by the upper society is still consumed by the upper society itself, and much wealth is even embezzled by officials and lower aristocrats during the collection process. But from the general trend, the surplus products collected are directly proportional to the stability and expansion capability of the upper society. Therefore, long-term competition between systems favors systems that collect as many surplus products as possible.' How can we collect products as effectively as possible? How can we improve labor efficiency more effectively? This needs good discussion," Du Wen's interest in talking was strong. "In the end, there must be a combat-effective grassroots organization!"

Yun Suji expressed agreement with this.

"It's a pity the existing human resources won't do. They are infected too much by the old society, and their outlook on life and values are hard to reverse. Hope still has to be placed on young people."

"It is indeed so." Yun Suji rarely resonated with Du Wen. "Current village cadres, like Fan Twelve, are already considered rare talents. Old Huo's type is so-so. More can only be said to be unusable. But for young people to shoulder heavy responsibilities, they still need sufficient education."

Du Wen nodded with satisfaction: "So we need a strong social group to unite, organize, and guide them!" Du Wen was brimming with enthusiasm, leaving Yun Suji a bit puzzled.

"What do you think of the Senate Communist Youth League?" Du Wen asked suddenly.

"Very good. We indeed need such a youth organization." Yun Suji thought of the Senate Communist Youth League Cadre Training Class activity he encountered in Qiongshan. His impression of it was quite good: pragmatic.

"A good organization must also have good leadership. Otherwise, I'm afraid it will go astray."

Yun Suji suddenly understood; so Du Wen also wanted to dip her finger in the Senate Communist Youth League! That was why she reeled him in like this; in the end, she thought he identified with her philosophy.

Speaking of which, Yun Suji still quite approved of many of her philosophies. At least in grassroots work, being grounded was her greatest advantage. In the entire Senate, only the few people in her Social Investigation Department had been able to sink their hearts into running around the grassroots to do research in these few years.

"Some people want to turn the Senate Communist Youth League into Boy Scouts; I can't agree with this. Holding a bonfire party, camping, hunting a few rabbits, learning several knots, enriching students' lives, and exercising students' physique—this isn't wrong. But they have more and more important things to learn—first is political study!"

To avoid listening to her long-winded speech, Yun Suji hurriedly stated his stance: "On this issue, I absolutely support you."

A smile appeared on Du Wen's face: "Very good, very good."

Yun Suji returned to the office of the food factory in a daze. Du Wen's words made him a bit uneasy. It seemed that surrounding the leadership and philosophy of the Senate Communist Youth League, another struggle was inevitable.

Yun Suji pushed open the office window. His current office was already a small suite on the second floor. Outside the window was the food factory's earliest Workshop No. 1: "Cleaning Workshop." These workshops were no longer simple red brick pillars, bamboo and wood trusses, and reed mat sheds; except for the brick pillars remaining unchanged, the trusses had become wrought iron, and the roofs had been replaced with corrugated sheets hot-rolled from galvanized iron. Looking out from the window, chimneys emitted smoke of black and white colors, trance-like returning to the appearance of old industrial zones in the old timeline.

The air was filled with a sweet smell. This was the smell emitted from the paste being boiled to make relief rations in the instant food workshop. Inside, besides dried sweet potato powder, a considerable proportion of bagasse powder was mixed in as filler. Of course, it could also add a little heat energy. After all, bagasse still retained quite a lot of sugar.

The production scale of relief rations had already doubled, while the production scale of the Kvass workshop had reduced by half: on one hand, sweet potatoes, the main raw material for Lingao Kvass, were needed to make relief rations; on the other hand, it also freed up more workers. After all, the Mainland Campaign still relied on grain, not beverages.

Because of the Mainland Campaign, the food factory's production had completely entered a state of combat readiness. Product lines underwent comprehensive adjustment. Currently, except for products with foreign trade demand whose capacity hadn't been compressed yet, all other products made way for combat readiness production.

"A new quota of 5 tons of fruit drops has been issued. Is this learning from the Japanese devils?" Yun Suji muttered looking at the latest "military use order" delivered.

Besides fruit drops, the things listed in the "military use" catalog were extremely varied. Yun Suji had originally planned to produce canned food for the army: after mass production of galvanized iron sheets, producing all-metal cans still had difficulties, but producing glass jar cans sealed with tinplate had no difficulties. The food factory had already carried out small-scale batch production. However, the Joint Logistics Headquarters believed glass jars were easily broken and loss was too great, vetoing this proposal. So the army's instant food mainly consisted of dry goods and pickled items.

He picked up the latest production progress schedule and plan sent by the dispatch room on the table. He managed not only a food factory but a series of food processing enterprises within Lingao County, including Heavenly Kitchen Sauce Garden, Marine Products Processing Factory, Grain Processing Factory, etc. There was also a batch of private workshops and trading firms inside and outside the county as cooperating units. It was equivalent to a food trust.

He quickly made a few tick marks on it with a pencil. The arrival of soybeans from the Ming Dynasty was far below his expectation, which would affect soy sauce production; potato supply from Jeju Island was completed on schedule, but the delivery volume of beef and horse meat lagged significantly. If nothing unexpected happened, the delivery plan would fail to be completed for the third consecutive month; salt delivery progress was normal...
