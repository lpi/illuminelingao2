# Chapter 1980 - Doubts

"This Dragon Gate Ledger: whenever an occurrence happens, enter four items: Jin (Enter), Jiao (Pay), Cun (Store), Gai (Owe). Simply put, Jin is income money, Jiao is expenditure. Cun is assets, Gai is debt. Jin minus Jiao, Cun minus Gai, if Jin minus Jiao equals Cun minus Gai, it is Mo (since Western Han, China had the tradition of Red recording Out and Ink recording In), meaning profit. Calculating profit and loss on two lines, balancing is called Closing Dragon Gate." Having said this, Advisor Xu was quite proud. With his cultivation, he had already understood the core essence of this Australian bookkeeping method from Huang Ping's speech just now. The so-called double-entry was just recording one matter twice; that whatever equation wasn't much different from checking account balance when Closing Dragon Gate.

He lightly stroked his beard, looking at the two youngsters before him with a pleased face. This Team Leader Huang acted quite like an Australian, but looking closely, he was probably from a servant background and hadn't read books; this new Comrade Zeng, however, had the demeanor of a scholar in behavior. Hearing he was a newly recruited "civil servant" of Guangzhou, a scholar shaving hair and changing clothes to be a clerk for Australians—although future rapid advancement was inevitable, it was ultimately strange clothes and loss of dignity. Sigh...

"So it seems, since Advisor Xu understands this account, doing it accordingly shouldn't be too difficult?" Huang Ping interrupted Advisor Xu's drifting thoughts.

"This, reading slowly should be no problem," Advisor Xu didn't shy away, "but doing the accounts, I fear I still need to look more. Being older, sometimes even if I understand, I can't turn the corner when writing. Please tolerate us more..."

"Easy to say, easy to say," Huang Ping nodded. "Because everyone is using the new bookkeeping method for the first time, we will give everyone a buffer period, about three months. During this period, we will come to check accounts at any time. If errors are found, they can be rectified in time without punishment."

"That is being considerate to us." Advisor Xu cupped his hands in thanks.

"One more thing, how is your corporatization restructuring going?"

This was one of the key tasks promoted by the Guangzhou Finance and Tax Bureau in Guangzhou, adhering to instructions from the Finance Department. Traditional industrial and commercial enterprises, many didn't separate family and enterprise. Even overseas merchants like Gao Ju were no exception; operating and living consumption funds were mixed. Tax work found it difficult to verify specific capital, operating costs, and profits, and thus couldn't achieve "scientific" and "precise" taxation. Even economic census was hard to unfold.

"Master Gao has already instructed on this matter; the accounting room is handling it," Advisor Xu responded slowly and unhurriedly. "Truly, Master Gao has many shops and properties under his name, and there are equity participations outside. The situation is very complex. Clarifying it one by one really can't be fast. Please forgive us."

These words were watertight. Corporatization restructuring itself was a very complex matter, especially for big industrial and commercial households like the Gao family. So the Finance and Tax Bureau itself gave a fairly broad timetable for restructuring. Huang Ping's reminder was just a kind of "continuous policy pressure" to avoid big households thinking this was just a gust of wind that would be over after blowing past.

Coming out of the Gao family, it was nearing noon. The two's stomachs were growling. Advisor Xu didn't keep them for a meal—everyone understood the Australians' rules—even if he did, they dared not eat.

Zeng Juan said: "Team Leader Huang, let me treat you to a meal. Consider it celebrating your promotion."

"This isn't appropriate, right?" Huang Ping said. "Besides, I'm just transferring jobs; how can it be called 'promotion'."

"Hehe, don't be modest." Zeng Juan usually called him brother; at this time, he intentionally furthered the relationship. "Just go to my family's tea house. Eat a few plates of dim sum to satisfy hunger. My family's tea house dim sum has some small fame in the neighborhood."

Huang Ping hesitated but felt nothing inappropriate. They had meal allowances for going out on business; at worst he would pay after going. He had long heard Guangdong tea dim sum was unparalleled in the world, but having been in Guangzhou for a long time, besides the cafeteria, he really hadn't eaten any Guangdong tea dim sum. He nodded presently: "Alright, then I'll impose."

Spring in Guangzhou during the Little Ice Age was very comfortable. The first collection period of the Guangzhou Finance and Tax Bureau ended smoothly. Zhang Xiaoqi fulfilled her previous promise and applied for two days of leave for the girls in the Tax Collection Hall, letting these children who had been spinning continuously inside the Finance and Tax Bureau compound like under "house arrest" since stepping into Guangzhou relax well. Of course, she didn't forget to give herself a day off. Speaking of Guangzhou, she really hadn't toured it properly.

Since the end of the plague in Guangzhou city, after vigorous rectification by Liu Xiang and the Guangzhou Police Bureau, public health conditions had improved a lot. After a large number of illegal "lean-to shops" were demolished, the originally "intestine-blocked" main roads became much smoother. Although the ditch clearing and canal digging projects hadn't fully completed, the overall city appearance had improved significantly. At least it was no longer the "stinking garbage dump" in Wen Desi's mouth.

However, compared to the "Ancient City" in Hengdian World Studios, this Guangzhou was still somewhat dilapidated. If there was anything attracting Zhang Xiaoqi to "tour," it was nothing more than the original 17th-century local customs.

After several "public security rectifications," the security index inside the city walls of Guangzhou had risen to "Blue Zone" standards. Senators carrying weapons in this area didn't need security guards. But for safety, the Municipal Police Bureau still assigned two plainclothes guards from the General Affairs Section 10 to follow and protect from a distance.

Zhang Xiaoqi was too lazy to carry a pistol, so she gladly accepted the guards. After all, the recently notified "Witchcraft Case" made her, a mother, jumpy for a while. She even specifically asked about the placement of rescued women and children. She didn't want her two darlings to encounter any risk.

Zhang Xiaoqi led Niannian and Guoguo on the street. Today she didn't trouble the old Liu couple but called Nan Wan'er along. Compared to Aunt Liu who was submissive and called her "Madam" every sentence, Zhang Xiaoqi felt chatting with Nan Wan'er was more comfortable. Sometimes she even thought, was modern people's low-age period extended, or were ancient people precocious? Besides a few hundred years of cognitive gap, she hit it off with this girl more than ten years her junior on many things.

"Auntie hug... Auntie hug..." Niannian was unhappy seeing Zhang Xiaoqi pick up Guoguo, pulling Nan Wan'er's sleeve and not letting go.

"Kiss Sister, then hug... Mm... so good." Nan Wan'er picked up Niannian and said to Zhang Xiaoqi: "Sister, you really weren't wrong; small children also compare. Look, Niannian gets unhappy as soon as you hug Guoguo."

Although Zhang Xiaoqi usually asked her to call her "Sister," she never dared to call herself "Little Sister," using the identity of "Older Sister" in front of children too—this wasn't some fashionable reason like "fearing old," but really not wanting to appear too "favored."

Nan Wan'er grew up in a pile of women and knew deeply that gaining a superior's favor for a person without foundation was both a blessing and a root of disaster. Honor and disgrace often depended on a thought of the superior. Chief Zhang was inexplicably good to her, but she couldn't guess this "Sister's" meaning at all.

She originally thought Zhang Xiaoqi intended for her to be Chief Wang's "Life Secretary," "taking a concubine" for her husband. This counted as "wifely virtue" of a mistress in a big household. Moreover, this Senator Zhang only had three daughters, fully meeting the "no son" standard for taking concubines.

Being a "Life Secretary" for Chief Wang, she wasn't unwilling. Nan Wan'er was very clear about her "status." She was a "servant" since childhood; even as a disciple, there were ranks.

Chief Wang himself was a good person. Most rarely, the "Main Wife" Chief Zhang favored her. As long as she "knew her place," living peacefully would be no problem...

But later developments seemed otherwise. She only saw that Chief Zhang liked her very much, even barging into Chief Ai's place to call her out—obviously worried Chief Ai would make moves. But having called her out, she didn't allow Chief Wang any chance to meet her privately, seemingly guarding against something...

This confused Nan Wan'er. In her view, this causeless favor was more frightening and uncomfortable than Chief Du's various "theoretical" education back then. But she dared not show it at all.

"Who says otherwise. If not for really liking children, raising Qingqing well alone would be enough."

"Just have one? Would Chief Wang be willing?"

"Your brother-in-law? What does he have to be unwilling about. The belly is mine; of course I have the say."

"But Qingqing is a girl after all..." Nan Wan'er thought Chief Zhang's family was indeed strange. Having three daughters, the father wasn't anxious at all and spoke with pride. She couldn't understand; didn't a girl belong to her husband's family after marriage? Wouldn't the two Chiefs have no one to send them off or visit graves after passing away?

"What's wrong with girls? To me, Chief Du hasn't educated you enough, haha. Look, do you lack food, drink, or money now? Wearing the uniform, who dares look down on you? Aren't you better than those men?" Zhang Xiaoqi pout at the waiter running in the roadside shop. "In Usurper Ming, women couldn't eat or dress without relying on men. Marrying a chicken follow a chicken, marrying a dog follow a dog—that was it. Now it's Australian Song. We women have jobs and money; why must we eagerly marry someone and treat ourselves as sold to another family? In my opinion, giving birth is so hard, children should take our women's surname..."

"Then isn't that becoming a matrilocal son-in-law?"

"Pfft... what matrilocal. Guoguo is surnamed Wang, Niannian is surnamed Zhang. Did your Chief Wang marry into our Zhang family matrilocally? In Australia, it's normal for children in one family to take father's surname or mother's surname."

"Is this true?" Nan Wan'er looked at Zhang Xiaoqi in disbelief. She knew some of the couple's relationship and always thought Chief Wang just "feared his wife," unexpectedly even giving away children's surnames—although girls, they were Wang family daughters after all. Wouldn't Chief Wang's ancestors die of anger knowing this? But thinking of her identity as "Sister" and "Brother-in-law," Nan Wan'er felt relieved again.
