# Chapter 1893 - Leading by Example

## Leading by Example

Lin Motian was convinced that pneumonic plague had not just appeared in the past two days—their quarantine network, laughably crude by modern standards, had simply failed to detect it. Yet even within areas covered by the network, pneumonic plague cases had emerged in clusters—almost simultaneously—indicating a massive outbreak might already be underway.

Lin Motian stepped out of the Health Department gate, feeling utterly spent in body and spirit. Getting anything done here was truly difficult. He had thought that in a place like Guangzhou, where Elders congregated, he would at least draw less fire than externally stationed Elders like Zhao Yingong. He hadn't expected this work would still make him universally despised—yet there was no alternative. The relatively mild quarantine methods employed before hadn't halted the plague's advance. Daily numbers of newly confirmed cases and deaths hadn't significantly decreased, and now with pneumonic plague appearing, matters would only worsen. Fortunately, Guangzhou's current weather was warm, buildings were well-ventilated, and his newly announced mandatory disinfection orders for residential buildings would help. Pneumonic plague shouldn't rage as fiercely as the old timeline's Manchurian epidemic. He still had a chance.

Life on the streets was growing ever more desolate. Lin Motian now walked the streets daily to observe. Though everyone advised him to stay indoors to avoid infection, he knew that quite a few epidemic prevention team members and related workers had already fallen ill and died. Mu Min had reported at a meeting that major vacancies now existed among *paijia* heads and *baozhang* positions—aside from those who had died of illness, many people adamantly refused to continue serving as these grassroots "officials." If he himself went into hiding, it would devastate the morale of workers risking their lives on the front lines.

The streets lay silent. Since the stricter epidemic prevention regulations had taken effect, that noisy, cheerful city of Guangzhou had gradually sunk into a terrible, deathly stillness. From far away came the sound of pushcart wheels rolling—corpse collection carts—particularly jarring in the silence.

Lin Motian wore his isolation suit and thick mask. Even so, the epidemic prevention team members, National Army soldiers, and police on street duty could recognize him. They knew this doctor with the guards was a Chief.

An Elder patrolling the streets served well to calm hearts. Thus not only did Lin Motian do this, but other Elders also appeared in public from time to time. Even Elders from somewhat unrelated departments did the same—on the days when new cases reached new highs, Elders from the legal affairs department still held court to hear cases.

Of course, he wasn't entirely unprepared. Liu San had already secretly arranged for a batch of low-temperature preserved streptomycin injections to be shipped from Lingao. Though expired, they should retain some efficacy. Should any Elder become infected, they could be used immediately.

Lin Motian was walking down the street when he faintly heard an agitated young man's voice ahead: "...Everyone knows cremation violates human ethics, but if we don't do this, it could bring disaster upon all the city's elders...!"

He thought it was another quarantine inspector clashing with residents. Turning to look, he saw it was actually a young commoner arguing with a tearful old woman. But looking more closely, the young man's eyes were also red-rimmed, and his voice was beginning to tremble as he spoke.

He walked slowly toward them. The patrol officers and epidemic prevention team members immediately stood at attention and saluted upon seeing an Elder. He waved his hand and stepped forward: "Elder, don't be sad. Once someone has died of illness, crying won't help, and there's also the danger of spreading disease. Let them take him away quickly..."

Seeing the old woman about to cry again, he instinctively moved to help her. The quarantine inspector saw this and was alarmed, quickly pulling him back: "Chief, this household just had a disease victim removed..."

Lin Motian started and stepped back accordingly. He continued: "The saying goes: 'Rest in peace in the earth.' But now, for the sake of millions of citizens in our Suicheng, for the living, we inevitably cannot attend to the deceased... Ethics are important, but the lives and safety of millions of souls are more important. I hope you can understand, Elder..." As he spoke, he slowly bowed to the old woman—a gesture that somewhat masked the awkwardness of his having retreated a step just moments before.

The patrol officer, quarantine inspector, and young man were all startled. The old lady didn't know who Lin Motian was, but these three knew: since the Elders' Council formally took over Guangzhou, there had never been a precedent of an Elder voluntarily bowing to an individual citizen. Elder Lin had broken precedent—and to a completely illiterate old lady at that! The young man's knees went weak and he nearly knelt, then suddenly remembered that the Great Song didn't follow this kowtowing custom. After a long pause, he managed to say in a trembling voice: "Chief, this..."

"I can see you've been very active in absorbing the Elders' Council's spirit. Did you come from Qiongzhou?" Lin Motian was somewhat puzzled—judging by the young man's attire, he obviously wasn't a naturalized citizen.

"N-no, but my eldest brother is a *baozheng*, and I'm currently a *paijia* head for this district. We are very... supportive of the Elders' Council's edicts." The young man's New Speech wasn't yet fluent. "Yesterday my father passed away from illness. When my mother heard he would be taken away for cremation, she... couldn't bear it... But... the plague... I... we understand..." As he spoke, tears threatened to fall again, but everyone understood his meaning.

"You've done the right thing," Lin Motian said softly. "Cremation doesn't mean we fail to honor the deceased. In this disaster, even when quarantine workers sacrifice themselves, cremation is unavoidable—I myself am no exception. When the plague is extinguished, we will definitely erect a monument to honor those citizens and martyrs who gave their lives fighting the plague... Take good care of her..."

The propaganda department naturally wouldn't miss such an opportunity. The story of Lin Motian bowing to a disease victim's family member quickly made the newspapers. The propaganda department seized the momentum to launch a new offensive. Guangzhou's newspapers were soon filled with reports like *Elder Lin Motian Bows Three Times to Family of Epidemic Zone Victim*, *Elder Lin Personally Visits Epidemic Zone, Addresses Leaders at All Levels of Quarantine Battalion*, and *Elder Lin Motian Inspects Epidemic Zone: The People of Great Song Are Invincible*—it must be said that Lin Motian had struck an excellent pose. Elder Qin also capitalized on the momentum to hold a grand memorial service at Louze Garden Cemetery for workers who had died on duty, which could be called the height of mourning honors. A special edition of the *Yangcheng Express* was subsequently published.

Under the powerful propaganda offensive and relentless suppression by military and police, resistance to the isolation and cremation policies finally began to diminish.

"Tell them to take this down." Lin Motian finished another day of patrol and entered the Health Committee door wearily. While reaching for the day's epidemic report, he pointed at the bulletin board displaying a newspaper featuring a large photo of himself. This newspaper had been posted for quite a while, and Lin Motian still found the propaganda about himself somewhat nauseating. Today he finally couldn't help himself and took the initiative to request the newspaper's removal.

"Yes, Chief!" The sentry snapped to attention and saluted.

"Where's today's epidemic report?" Lin Motian looked at the document folder at the door—empty.

"A comrade from the office already took it," the sentry explained.

Then it should be on his desk. Lin Motian thought this as he walked toward the command center, but from far away he could already hear a commotion.

"What's all the noise about?" Lin Motian said, somewhat displeased, quietly reproaching the jubilant workers.

"Chief, wonderful news!" A messenger lifted a document with an excited expression—obviously today's epidemic report. "Since the pneumonic plague outbreak, this is the first time our compiled daily death toll has decreased!"

Lin Motian staggered and stepped back, but finally a trace of a smile appeared on his pale face. A turning point at last! *I don't have to worry about being sent back to teach anymore!*

Though he hadn't expected the epidemic to gradually fade and disappear starting today, at least this was a good omen.

Lin Motian took the report from the messenger's hands. Not only were death numbers starting to decline—though the decrease was small—but the number of people being isolated on Changzhou Island was also decreasing, and even the escape rate had dropped.

Escape incidents from Changzhou Island had occurred more than once. Some succeeded, others failed. But every escaped isolated person was placed on a wanted list, especially at road checkpoints. Initially, escapees who were caught were simply sent back for re-isolation for twelve days. But as the number of escapees increased—and many were never found again, creating enormous hidden dangers—the handling of escapees grew harsher. Not only could sentries at the quarantine camp shoot escapees on sight, but after being caught and re-isolated, they would also face exile to Taiwan after their isolation ended.

After implementing this measure, escapes from isolation had decreased dramatically—after all, spending twelve days in a quarantine camp versus being exiled overseas were worlds apart. And as publicity intensified, citizens better understood the purpose of quarantine isolation, and resistance had lessened considerably.

Last week there had been only three escape cases from isolated personnel, all of whom were captured. Lin Motian looked at the confessions attached. Each could be called "pitiable" or "understandable," but rules were rules. He annotated the report as usual: *Handle according to precedent.*

After experiencing panic, all of Guangzhou was gradually calming down. All kinds of epidemic prevention work were becoming more professional, policy implementation was growing smoother, and epidemic fluctuations were beginning to stabilize. Lin Motian and the Elders in Guangzhou were gradually finding everything proceeding well. Some policy innovations that had originally been extremely difficult to advance—such as demolishing buildings to clear silt—were now gaining more and more support under the grand cause of "epidemic prevention." Many citizens and shops that had previously refused to cooperate had signed agreements under strong public pressure, just waiting for the plague to end before beginning demolition and silt-clearing. Liu Xiang was also preparing to use "epidemic prevention" as justification to implement a series of urban construction projects inside and outside the city, and to use the opportunity to pressure local gentry and wealthy households into "voluntary donations."

"If I don't make their hearts tremble, they won't know how to write 'Liu'!" Liu Xiang clicked his abacus in his office.
