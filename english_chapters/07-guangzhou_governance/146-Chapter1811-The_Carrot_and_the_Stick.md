# Chapter 1811 - The Carrot and the Stick

"Let me tell you: stop dreaming your daydreams! Once you've come to the establishment, forget about pretending to be chaste and virtuous. Get yourself cleaned up quickly and come out to receive clients! If you're obedient, Mother will naturally find a rich patron to 'comb' you. If not—first I'll have a few bachelors give you some thick candles! Then bring in some muscular laborers and boatmen to serve you every day—let you enjoy yourself to the fullest!"

"No, no, no... I beg Mother for mercy. This servant certainly won't forget your great kindness..." He Xiaoyue had long since been frightened out of her wits. Now hearing she was to be so abused, she began pleading and begging for mercy.

"If you're obedient, Mother will naturally find a wealthy patron to 'comb' you. If not—first I'll have the powder folk give you thick candles! Then bring some strapping laborers and boatmen to attend you daily—let you enjoy yourself to the full!"

"No, no, no... I beg Mother for mercy. This servant will never forget your great kindness and virtue..." He Xiaoyue had already been scared out of her wits. Now hearing of such treatment, she kept pleading and begging.

Madam Yao saw the timing was about right. She softened her tone to coax: "Young lady—I know you're a widow keeping faith who was forced to that ghost-hole Pure Virtue Hall for your widowhood. Your natal and marital families—from what I see—don't take you seriously. Even if you were sold back and redeemed now, wouldn't they just send you back to the Pure Virtue Hall to live? Heads bent seeing only the four corners of sky, shut in your room all day spinning and weaving, never enough to eat, beaten and scolded at every turn. Think this is any worse than a widow's tower? And that Master Zhu someone came to propose—you think Mother didn't check? You think he'd treat you any better than Master Dong? In the end, women of our class—what man is really any good? They're all birds of a feather."

This was half true, half false: she said the Master Zhu wasn't investigated—naturally nonsense—but that these men were "birds of a feather" might well be true. These words made He Xiaoyue's heart lurch: falling into the pleasure quarters she naturally didn't want. But returning to the Pure Virtue Hall—that living coffin—where she couldn't lift her head, couldn't see sky, stuck in a room every day spinning and weaving, never enough to eat, beaten and scolded constantly... she absolutely didn't want that either. That's why she had risked escape in the first place.

She saw He Xiaoyue fall silent. She knew her words had struck home. She coaxed further: "Though our business here isn't exactly glorious, the girls eat and drink well, wear silks and satins, have servant girls attending them. In what way is it worse than the Pure Virtue Hall? You're from an educated family after all. In a few years, some young master or merchant's son from a gentry or wealthy house will take a fancy to you. Then you'll 'go straight' naturally. Why torture yourself over a moment's reputation?"

He Xiaoyue said nothing. She had begun to waver toward resignation. The inner turmoil was visible on her face. Madam Yao saw the moment was right. She abruptly changed expression and said harshly: "Miss He, I see you're a sensible person. Auntie here has been kind to you, so I've gone easy these few days. Otherwise—you think you'd have good fruit to eat! Now listen well!"

Saying this, she left. The servant woman locked the door. Madam Yao said in a low voice: "Go to the accounts office. Get a few plasters of bruise medicine for her. And tell the big kitchen—give her some decent food and drink tonight."

The servant woman understood perfectly. She answered: "Yes, this servant understands." Then flattered: "Auntie's methods are really something."

Madam Yao said smugly: "Hmph—never mind some door-widow young miss. Even court-appointed chastity-arch widows, once they fall into my hands, I'll have them begging on their knees to receive clients!"

She returned to the front to report the situation item by item to Madam Han, saying within a few days this He Xiaoyue would submit. After a few more days to recuperate, Muyun could teach her some lute. Slowly they'd select patrons willing to 'comb' her.

"Have Muyun teach her lute for a few days first," Madam Han thought. "See whether she's bright or dim-witted."

"Yes." Madam Yao agreed. Then said: "Only this registration business..."

"This isn't urgent. Wait and see if Old Man Fang's miracle pill works." Madam Han mused. "As for household registration, there's no rush either. For now, just register her as a temporary resident. Once she's fully submitted, we'll do permanent registration."

Temporary registration didn't require personal appearance—that was limited to fifteen days stay. Madam Han's biggest worry now was that during the 'yellow ticket' application, He Xiaoyue might shout "unwilling!" right in public. That would be the end—the police station under public view, with Australians renowned for inflexibility.

"In my view, we still need more gentle methods. Don't press her too hard." Madam Yao said. "This young miss suffered plenty in the Pure Virtue Hall. She's from a wealthy background—can't handle that kind of hardship. As long as we give her good food and drink, make her feel life here is better than the Pure Virtue Hall, there's a ninety-nine percent chance of success."

Madam Han nodded: "This is easy enough. Just handle it."

"Yes." Madam Yao agreed. About to withdraw, Madam Han called her back, asking: "Just now someone brought a child to show me, asking if I wanted her—normally nothing special. But now I'm hesitating. Help me think it through?"

Madam Yao said: "How did the child come in? If through a kidnapper, that's still alright—clean origins. I'm afraid it's relatives or parents selling her. With this ordinance now, if they use their identity as parents and relatives to make trouble, the establishment won't handle it well."

Brothels were quite happy to buy more children. But with the Australians' situation still unclear, neither Madam Han nor Madam Yao dared act rashly.

Yet Madam Han was truly reluctant to let go of this potential "money tree." She had already "examined" this girl earlier—well-proportioned, a local, and seemingly quite clever.

She hesitated: "You make sense. I just feel this child has good bones. And only fifteen taels asking price. Would be such a waste to pass up."

Madam Yao's original intention was not to buy. But seeing the madam's expression, knowing she couldn't let go, she said: "If you want to buy, why not follow Old Man Fang's suggestion—register her as a foster daughter. Anyway, those few girls in the establishment now all need some identity. One more or one less doesn't matter."

Madam Han nodded: "Alright. Let me think about it more."

Li Ziyu had felt quite pleased with himself lately. In the police bureau's business examination the day before, he had broken into the top ten for the first time. Because of his persistence in reporting the headless corpse case and his subsequent performance during the investigation, although the case still hadn't been solved, Chief Pan and the others had shown signs of valuing him. They had specifically sought him out to ask if he had any interest in criminal investigation. They had also transferred him from his most basic patrol post at the district station up to the municipal bureau's Public Security Section. Ah Gui had risen with the tide and was also counted as "meritorious personnel," transferred up together.

Now, Li Ziyu was no longer a mere grassroots patrol officer, but a "team leader." Of course, he could only lead Ah Gui—just one person.

All of this fully demonstrated that the chiefs wanted to promote him... Therefore, during meals at the cafeteria, Li Ziyu could eat two more bowls of rice than usual.

Li Ziyu came from a minor bureaucrat family. His drive for merit and position was stronger than most. So lately, his work enthusiasm was considerable. He was even eating meals in the last batch.

The municipal bureau's food was the same as the district stations', but it had a cafeteria—which also served as the large auditorium. More people too. Li Ziyu had just entered the cafeteria when Zhao Gui was already calling him.

"Brother Yu, over here!"

He had already come early to get their meals and was waiting at a seat. Since being transferred to the municipal bureau, Zhao Gui had become even more attentive to Li Ziyu—practically becoming his personal assistant.

"Brother Yu, I owe you so much. Without you I definitely would've failed this exam! Here, eat more meat." As he spoke, Zhao Gui tried to transfer the only drumstick from his lunchbox to Li Ziyu's.

"Hey, hey, no no no." Seeing the murderous looks from nearby diners, Li Ziyu hurriedly blocked Zhao Gui's queue-jumping behavior. "Don't—the new way of life is all about us following rules. I'd better just wait in line."

"Hehe, yes yes, then sit inside first. I'll bring over the porridge when I pour it." While Zhao Gui smiled apologetically, he gestured toward the interior.

Li Ziyu lifted the bamboo curtain and entered the room. It felt cool and refreshing. Inside were about a dozen small tables. On a cabinet counter by the wall, wiped sparkling clean, sat seven or eight large ceramic jars covered with gauze—filled with various drinking snacks: boiled sprouted beans, dressed bean sprouts, Australian pickles, boiled razor clams... Behind the counter were wine jars and porridge barrels. Wine vessels and bowls and chopsticks all washed clean and gleaming. The whole effect was crisp and hygienic.

Because it wasn't mealtime, not a single customer sat inside. The woman minding the bar was in her early twenties—Li Ziyu saw her, and immediately something stirred. This was the young lady from the Dong family's shop!

Dong Mingdang's mother and daughter had opened this shop. Li Ziyu was a regular customer.

Then, as Li Ziyu was just about to find a seat, he noticed his eyes drawn to a table where a female police officer sat—someone with short, efficient hair, a pretty oval face. Unlike other female officers in Guangzhou who gathered together to chatter during meals, this one sat alone at a table, quietly eating, her face full of preoccupation.

"Hey, Ah Gui—who's that woman over there? I don't think I've seen her before?"

Ah Gui raised his rice-flecked face, following Li Ziyu's gaze.

"That's a real looker. But I don't know her... Someone like that wouldn't talk to me anyway, hehe."

Just then, the man sitting across from Li Ziyu spoke up: "That person? She's Officer Lian Nishang, a household registration officer transferred from Lingao a few days ago. She's been assigned to work in the municipal bureau's Household Registration Section. But..." The man lowered his voice a few notches and continued: "Word is she came here as a veteran to guide our work.
But I hear she actually got transferred to Guangzhou because she made some mistake in Lingao..."

"Oh... I see... I see..." Li Ziyu wore an expression of sudden enlightenment.

"Brother Yu, what do you see now?" Ah Gui asked, bewildered.

"Nothing, nothing. Just eat up, eat." Li Ziyu saw his household's business thriving and prospering, and though it wasn't his own affair, his heart felt cheerful. How strange—ever since the West River adventure escaping back to Guangzhou, his feelings for these few younger brothers had seemed to grow increasingly deep.
