# Chapter 1994 - New Australian Tricks

"This," Wang Qiyi flipped notebook forward a page, "this I asked Pei Xiuli after Liu Xiang finished talking about Special Taxes that day. You truly didn't say wrong, that Su Ai is really a talent. You see this Hangyuan; still different from the brothels we think..."

"Say key point, say key point."

"Oh oh," Wang Qiyi interrupted not annoyed, continued marking on notebook with pen slowly, "Hangyuan industry can't be simply defined as brothel. Defining as High-end Club seems more precise. But actually in old timeline I really can't figure out which industry can benchmark against Hangyuan—completely none."

In Ming Dynasty Hangyuan, "Sex Transaction" was only part of business. More similar to "Entertainment Industry." Dignitaries, rich men big households feasted and amused here usually. Listening songs watching operas, playing Double Six [backgammon-like], playing Go... Not only Hangyuan kept "Small Squads" able to sing opera themselves, but also kept "Chess Attendants," "Ball Society" [Yuan She - Football/Cuju] etc. idle helpers for masters' leisure amusement.

To support this entertainment industry, big Hangyuan also had own logistics department. Not only cooks excellent in cooking dishes and tea snacks, but also tailors able to design and cut best-looking clothes, skillful craftsmen making various jewelry, playthings...

This "Small and Complete" business model made Hangyuan's tax type, tax rate somewhat controversial. But Wang Qiyi felt, rather than arguing these business differences, better to start directly from operating income.

"...Through our investigation: Hangyuan income basically can be divided into three categories. One is prostitution fee [Piao Zi], nothing much to say. Two is service income: like playing music singing songs providing banquets etc. Three is sales goods income—ready-made clothes, jewelry, food sold in Hangyuan have excellent quality, price not cheap, having considerable reputation in market. As for similar long-term keeping mistresses also counts in prostitution fee. Besides there is income from Comb-up [virginity auction], but now this belongs to trafficking population; heavy sentence if caught. Already basically none. I think we completely needn't divide so meticulously. Directly divide into two categories: income with sex transaction and income without sex transaction."

"Old Wang I somewhat understand your meaning. With sex transaction, directly use Yellow Ticket to inverse conduct this cost to Hangyuan from bottom to top, compressing her profit in this aspect."

"Yes. And compared to us investigating Hangyuan or Hangyuan self-reporting, starting from Yellow Ticket can be said as Precision Strike."

"Then Hangyuan? Don't say" Ai Zhixin supported head raising a hand, stopping Wang Qiyi, "Is Hangyuan managed as normal enterprise? Add some heavy tax to it, but unnecessary to be ridiculously high. After all service income and sales income count as normal business right."

"Director Ai, correct. I think same as you. Must give Hangyuan opportunity for theoretical transformation too." Wang Qiyi felt could end. "Hangyuan itself doesn't merely rely on selling flesh to mix rice to eat..."

"Okay. You go back organize this Special Tax Plan?"

"No problem. Anyway I am idle being idle..."

"Hahahaha, Old Wang, you couple truly dedicate time to Senate."

"Haha, Director Ai you also take care of body." Wang Qiyi pretended to look direction of Ai Xinyi. "But this Special Tax Liu Xiang said sounds too ugly. Like being thief."

"Could it call Flower Donation?" Ai Zhixin had lingering fear of painful experience being sprayed [criticized] for Tax Farming initially.

"I see, tax collected when auditing Yellow Ticket also classify in Stamp Tax. But tax item is Custom Industry License. By then have special Stamps pasted on Yellow Ticket also convenient for check isn't it. As for Hangyuan, just follow Entertainment Industry. Entertainment Industry item under Circulation Tax. Old timeline was 20%; we give it 30%. Thus entire Custom Industry collection down, on tax type doesn't have any place possibly letting people see we are collecting flesh money. Anyway according to Third Assembly Resolution only Tax Type needs all Senator General Assembly approval. Tax Item only needs Administration Council and Standing Committee passing would do."

"High person, truly high person!" Ai Zhixin admired Wang Qiyi sincerely this time. This working in grassroots was different; skill of fooling leaders set by set, also leak-proof. "But saying so, our tax item reform should also be put on agenda."

"Should be. If not, push open taking this chance. Then get Deed Tax up too. Give Liu Xiang a Joy on Joy how about?"

"Hahaha, okay. Do as Old Brother says. But this way, inappropriate to call tax collected by Hangyuan Circulation Tax. I see better follow original old timeline calling, Business Tax [Ying Ye Shui]. Pay tax as long as operating business. Care not what you do. Very appropriate covering surface also wide."

"This best however." Wang Qiyi thought to self: Big Brother you finally discovered Circulation Tax name has problem.

Guangzhou summer in Little Ice Age was still unbearably hot. Even changed into short-sleeve summer wear, Li Ziyu was still full head sweat. Watching coolies shaking palm fans waiting work under roadside shade with chest exposed, Li Ziyu felt uniform on body sticking more uncomfortable.

Nearly half month back from Lingao. Neither Bureau nor Chief announced his promotion appointment. Although more than one person patted chest saying his "Commission" was right in Bureau Personnel Section. But till now this legendary "Deputy Director Commission" wasn't read to him.

He was still Security Section ordinary staff as usual. concurrent Patrol Police work one morning one afternoon every other day made him faintly have a breath blocked in chest. But work still to do, street still to patrol. Now entire Police Bureau was one radish many pits; no chance for you to slack. Could only chat aimlessly with Zhao Gui following behind listlessly.

"Brother Yu, is there Senate big ship in Xiangshan Ao now?"

"Maybe there is. That place was desolate originally, just some Dan households [Boat people]. Later heard Chiefs built wharf there."

"I heard Mother Wu say her unworthy son now goes to Xiangshan Ao to be some Navy Student..."

"Oh..." Li Ziyu cared not at all. Too many people joining army for a bite of rice these years. Moreover Senate pay was much higher, also never owed.

"Mother Wu said her son gets at least 2 yuan payment monthly..."

"How much?!!!!"

"Two yuan, two yuan..." Zhao Gui was startled by Li Ziyu.

Two yuan? Monthly two yuan payment! This bunch of illiterate Qiu Ba [Soldiers], based on what take so much. I, a dignified staff of Police Bureau, literate, busy from dawn to dark tired like dog daily only monthly two yuan salary. Need use silver to feed this bunch of Dan people begging living on water? Senate truly blind! Li Ziyu thought resentfully.

"Ah Gui! Don't scratch anymore!" Seeing Zhao Gui's hand reaching crotch again, Li Ziyu grabbed baton, a very standard backhand strike smashing over.

"Brother Yu, don't hit." Zhao Gui feared pain hurriedly retracted hand. "Brother Yu, front is Dong Family Shop. We wandered this whole morning, go rest feet."

Fine too. Li Ziyu looked at big sun overhead thinking. Going to see Miss Dong in this hot day not bad too.

Dong Family Shop now was long not the look of selling Shandong Pancake on street with two small huts back then. Since Dong Mingdang re-organized shop under Zhang Xiaoqi's guidance, engaging several new dishes, this business visibly redder day by day. Plus naturalized citizens in Guangzhou city increasing, Dong Mingdang simply hired two female workers in one breath, and took over a frontage next door to expand business area.

Yesterday that room just tidied up. According to Australian saying was "Renovation" finished. Miss Dong was organizing accounts behind counter waiting for Health Police to establish inspection. Looking up seeing Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui walking this way, hurriedly circled to shop door greeting two.

Regarding Dong Mingdang, Li Ziyu felt hard to describe his feeling in one sentence. Initially he looked down a bit. After all an unmarried daughter showing face on street doing business was too improper. Later following contact felt this Miss Dong was a maverick strange woman; heart also started having a bit other ideas. And now, this Miss Dong was both "Model" appointed by Chief Zheng and climbed friendship with Chief Zhang of Finance and Tax Bureau. Unknown how much higher than himself this small patrolman. Seeing her he felt discouraged. Based on what some people so lucky.

Today Dong Mingdang wore a set of standard Australian outfit—Blue and White One-piece Long Skirt. Lotus root-like white small arms exposed outside completely. To Li Ziyu who saw big world in Lingao this wasn't rare originally. Just, just why seeing Miss Dong wearing so wanted to swallow saliva? Li Ziyu hurriedly retracted mind, moving eyes to shop wall. saw on wall besides previous Health Pemit and Tax Registration Certificate added a copper coin-like sticker below.

"This was just pasted by Finance and Tax Bureau day before yesterday." Dong Mingdang eyesight extremely good. Seeing Li Ziyu slightly doubtful initiated explanation. "This seems to be Chief's idea, saying paid or not tax see and know."

This is rare. Li Ziyu leaned forward looking carefully. Correct, dark pattern on this sticker only Chiefs could make.

"Paid tax then collect this back to paste?"

"Where so simple." Not meal time yet shop empty. Dong Mingdang arranged Li Ziyu and other sitting while arranging Lan'er pouring tea. "This sticker is tax officer from Finance and Tax Bureau coming door to door pasting after paying tax. All shops paying tax in first half year have. But these few nearby are different..."

"How different?" Li Ziyu instantly came to interest. When studying originally, he liked most watching these Australians playing big tricks in inconspicuous places one by one.

"Look at mine, white." Dong Mingdang pointed at wall then pointed at street opposite. "Shopkeeper Tong over there is green."

"Is there explanation inside?" Senate was most skillful in making systems, and often hit vital point of management. So Li Ziyu knew this new trick inevitably embraced certain new measure.
