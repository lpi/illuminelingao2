# Chapter 2027 - Outrageous Claims

"May I ask where this harm lies?" Li Suiqiu was born in Guangdong and had only traveled to Jiangnan and the capital, understanding little about the northern environment and climate beyond passing glimpses.

"The harm lies in environmental destruction," Cui Hantang said. "Master Meizhou probably doesn't know that though Guanzhong was once fertile land, a thousand miles of rich fields, it actually lies in a low-rainfall zone... entirely dependent on trees and grasslands for protection and nourishment. Once vegetation thins, neither water nor soil can be retained..."

Seeing Li Suiqiu's face showing increasing puzzlement, Cui Hantang knew continuing like this would be like playing music to a cow—after all, Li Suiqiu didn't know what the "400mm rainfall zone" was, nor "the Little Ice Age." Someone living in Guangdong's subtropical monsoon climate probably wouldn't understand "water and soil conservation" either.

So Cui Hantang had to lower his discourse and first explain some technical terms. Li Suiqiu had originally approached this with a "let's hear what nonsense you have" attitude, but upon listening, found it quite reasonable. Though he hadn't traveled extensively, he had been to the capital, experiencing the scenery and environment from south to north—Lingnan's lack of seasons, Jiangnan's humid warmth, and the north's drought and windblown sand. He had known these were different climates but had never considered why they differed. Cui Hantang's explanation gave him a small enlightenment.

"...What the Daoist Master says, this student roughly understands. An area's climate depends on water and heat—is that correct?"

"Precisely!" Cui Hantang breathed a sigh of relief. Though the answer was somewhat crude, it was far more efficient than teaching Daoist disciples back in Lingao.

"So weather cycles between cold and warm, like the rotation of four seasons, cold for a hundred years, warm for another hundred—cold brings drought, warm brings floods. And now it's another cold, dry period?"

Talking to intelligent people really isn't tiring... Cui Hantang thought secretly.

"Shaanxi and Guanzhong are originally dry, low-rainfall regions, and now they've encountered a 'cold season' with even less rain. Hence nine droughts in ten years. Water and soil conservation is especially important." Cui Hantang spoke eloquently. "Nurturing water and soil depends entirely on vegetation..."

Though the ancients had concepts of "leveling mountains and controlling water" and administrative orders for "forest reserves," their environmental awareness mostly remained at the agricultural needs level. Most management focused on irrigation and soil improvement, with insufficient understanding of maintaining vegetation and conserving water. Combined with the huge demand for timber from both government and civilians, they had to encourage cultivation to feed large populations and increase taxes.

"...Since the Han and Tang, forests have been felled, grasslands plowed, day after day, year after year, until forests and grasslands were nearly destroyed. When Ming Taizu founded the nation, he cultivated in Guanzhong to the tune of thirty million *mu*. Though it brought temporary benefit, vegetation was completely destroyed, causing endless harm to future generations."

After the vegetation in arid and semi-arid regions was destroyed, the land lost its water retention function, and the local humid microclimate created by forests ceased to exist. This further exacerbated climate and soil deterioration. In areas lacking irrigation, it became completely dependent on the heavens. Agricultural yields per *mu* dropped drastically. In North China and the Northwest, before 1949, wheat yields of just a few dozen *jin* per *mu* were normal.

"...With low output, commoners could only farm more land to survive. The more land cultivated, the less it produced. Thus repeated, a thousand miles of fertile land became a barren wasteland of windblown sand and bare mountains. Now Ming's national fortunes wane, gentry and officials show no concern for the people—how can commoners not rebel?"

After going around in a large circle, they finally returned to the thesis that "natural disasters are also human calamities." Li Suiqiu silently savored the meaning, finding some novelty in it. Since ancient times, critiques of dynastic governance failures had revolved around "not caring for the people" and "dim ruler and treacherous ministers." After all, people of that era couldn't understand the causes of natural disasters.

After pondering a moment, Li Suiqiu said: "Since the Daoist Master puts it this way, presumably the Council of Elders has some extremely clever methods to avoid these human calamities?"

Cui Hantang said proudly: "Naturally!"

Li Suiqiu thought this Daoist was not only quite fat but also a first-rate braggart. Since they'd come this far, he wanted to hear more, so he asked: "Then please enlighten me."

"The ancients said: brute force overcomes all tricks..." This saying made Li Suiqiu look puzzled, and Cui Hantang suddenly remembered this phrase only existed from the Qing Dynasty onward, quickly correcting himself: "Those with real ability don't care about little tricks—to solve the root of natural and human disasters lies in 'productive forces'!"

"What are productive forces?"

"Well... take an acre of land for example. If our Council of Elders' Heaven and Earth Society cultivates it, growing the same rice, they can harvest several hundred *jin* more than local commoners—if every acre throughout the realm could yield fifty *jin* more, without needing to cultivate everywhere, commoners could have enough food and clothing. Even with disasters, they wouldn't become starving corpses."

Li Suiqiu thought secretly, what big talk from this fellow! Though he didn't directly manage farmland himself, he had lived in the countryside and knew the rent collection situation thoroughly. Farming depended entirely on the heavens; favorable weather meant a "great harvest." But such years might not come once in ten. Even in bumper years, each *mu* could only yield an extra hundred-odd *jin* of rice. What farming secret could increase yields by several hundred *jin* per *mu*? Truly unheard of.

He didn't doubt Cui Hantang was bragging, because news of the hair-thieves' "secret methods" for farming and manufacturing had long spread. Those who'd been to Qiongzhou Prefecture and Lingao all eagerly told of the hair-thieves' fields they'd seen.

If the hair-thieves could serve the Ming, the current crisis could be resolved. Li Suiqiu couldn't help secretly feeling regret. Setting aside their powerful ships and cannons, just their abilities in farming, manufacturing, commerce, and governance were rare in the world. What a pity!

"This unworthy student presumes productive forces are methods for making land yield more?"

"Precisely. All trades and industries are thus. Everything prioritizes developing productive forces. Ming has reached its current state because, at the bottom of it, productive forces are insufficient. Population growth is good, but also means countless more mouths to feed. Before, a hundred *mu* fed a hundred people, everyone ate well and dressed warmly, with meat and wine on holidays and a few new clothes. Now even cultivating all available land yields only three hundred *mu*, but the population has become a thousand. Yet yields per *mu* remain the same." Cui Hantang spoke energetically. "Moreover, among these thousand people, a few dozen aren't satisfied with just eating rice—they want meat and wine daily, trading grain for fish and meat, silks and satins. Naturally many must starve..."

"So if these thousand people's productive forces increase, even with only three hundred *mu*, as long as yields increase, even if some want meat and silk, no one will starve?"

"Perhaps a few unlucky souls might starve or go hungry, but not like now where everyone must starve, with no choice but to rebel and steal food or simply be killed and not need to eat... Take our Council of Elders' Qiongzhou—though I dare not claim everyone is warm and fed, at least no one starves." Cui Hantang sighed deeply. "Since ancient times, commoners' desires have been minimal, seeking only food and safety. If even that can't be provided, what face is there to sit in court?"

Though Li Suiqiu couldn't fully grasp this "productive forces supremacy" immediately, he understood the last sentence—clearly criticizing the current Emperor.

Honestly, though the current Emperor had been somewhat harsh toward his tutors, arguably "blocking channels of remonstrance," they had also heard from friends in the capital: His Majesty governed diligently, working from dawn to late night, unprecedented in recent decades. So many people, including Li Suiqiu, though having various opinions and dissatisfactions with Chongzhen's governance, still held great hope.

"My teacher said: 'The current Emperor doesn't love wealth or women, governs diligently and loves the people—a sage ruler of his generation.' Yet why is war raging everywhere and rebellions boiling over? Besides insufficient productive forces, are there other reasons?"

"Diligent governance? Hehe." Cui Hantang couldn't help laughing: "Though Ming's predicament isn't his fault, not only has there been no improvement, but the situation worsens daily—more than half of it caused by his diligent governance! The more diligent he is, the faster Ming perishes!"

"How so?"

"He's too eager to see results! The so-called good intentions paving the road to hell—without ability, the more one tries to do good, the worse things get! Looking at his governance over these years, I'd say: suspicious by nature and fond of close supervision, preferring firmness and prone to anger. Close supervision leads to harshness and ingratitude; proneness to anger leads to hasty blunders. With such an inconsistent person as emperor, in my view his diligent governance is just reckless meddling! First he executed the eunuch Wei, then suppressed the Donglin—that's fine, remnants of previous reigns. But what's with changing chief ministers year after year? National policies change from morning to evening, leaving local officials at a loss. Someone like this as emperor, without discernment in judging people, is tragedy for Ming, for the commoners, and for himself." Cui Hantang, speaking excitedly, grabbed his teapot, opened his floodgates and critiqued the emperor with flying spittle.

"As the saying goes: 'Victory and defeat are common in military affairs.' This lord though—when employing generals, he urgently presses for battle; when they fail, he investigates thoroughly. In Chongzhen's second year, he executed Vice Minister of War Yang Hao; in year three, he executed Jiliao Governor Liu Ce; in year three, he executed Jiliao Supreme Commander Yuan Chonghuan; in year five, he executed Governor Shen Qi; in year seven, he executed Grand Canal Transport Commissioner Yang Yipeng; he exiled Minister of War Yan Mingtai; removed Xiong Mingyu from office; threw Sun Chuanting into prison, and demoted Sun Chengzong back home to await death. Though these men all lost battles, they had some ability. Given trust and authority, they might have achieved great deeds. Just because of one failure, they were killed; those lucky to survive were so frightened that many committed suicide. An emperor who executes so readily will certainly have all capable ministers and generals killed off. No matter how talented, everyone becomes panicked, and no one dares take responsibility!"
