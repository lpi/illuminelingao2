# Chapter 2027 - Outrageous Claims

"May I inquire where this harm resides?" Li Suiqiu, born in Guangdong and having traveled only to Jiangnan and the capital, understood little of northern environment and climate beyond fleeting observations.

"The harm lies in environmental devastation." Cui Hantang spoke deliberately. "Master Meizhou likely remains unaware that though Guanzhong once constituted fertile plains—a thousand miles of abundant fields—it actually occupies a low-rainfall zone, entirely dependent upon trees and grasslands for protection and nourishment. Once vegetation diminishes, neither water nor soil can be retained."

Observing Li Suiqiu's expression growing increasingly puzzled, Cui Hantang recognized that continuing this trajectory would prove futile—akin to performing music for cattle. After all, Li Suiqiu possessed no knowledge of the "400mm rainfall zone" or "the Little Ice Age." Someone inhabiting Guangdong's subtropical monsoon climate would scarcely comprehend "water and soil conservation."

Consequently, Cui Hantang moderated his discourse, first elucidating basic technical concepts. Li Suiqiu had initially approached this exchange with an attitude of "let's hear what nonsense you offer," yet upon listening, discovered considerable reasonability. Though he had not traveled extensively, he had journeyed to the capital, experiencing scenery and environment from south to north—Lingnan's seasonless climate, Jiangnan's humid warmth, the north's drought and windborne sand. He had recognized these as distinct climates yet never contemplated why they differed. Cui Hantang's exposition provided modest enlightenment.

"What the Daoist Master articulates, this student roughly comprehends. A region's climate depends upon water and heat—is this accurate?"

"Precisely!" Cui Hantang exhaled with relief. Though the formulation remained somewhat crude, it proved far more efficient than instructing Daoist disciples back in Lingao.

"So weather cycles between cold and warm, resembling the rotation of four seasons—cold for a century, warm for another. Cold brings drought, warmth brings floods. And presently we inhabit another cold, arid period?"

Conversing with intelligent individuals truly proves effortless, Cui Hantang thought privately.

"Shaanxi and Guanzhong originally constitute arid, low-rainfall regions. Now they've encountered a 'cold season' yielding even less precipitation. Hence nine droughts in ten years. Water and soil conservation assumes paramount importance." Cui Hantang discoursed eloquently. "Nurturing water and soil depends entirely upon vegetation."

Though the ancients possessed concepts of "leveling mountains and controlling waters" and administrative mandates for "forest reserves," their environmental consciousness largely remained confined to agricultural requirements. Most management emphasized irrigation and soil improvement, with insufficient comprehension of maintaining vegetation and conserving water. Combined with enormous governmental and civilian timber demands, they felt compelled to promote cultivation for feeding expanding populations and increasing tax revenue.

"Since Han and Tang times, forests have been felled, grasslands plowed, day after day, year after year, until forests and grasslands approached near-total destruction. When Ming Taizu established the nation, he promoted Guanzhong cultivation totaling thirty million *mu*. Though it delivered temporary benefit, vegetation suffered complete devastation, inflicting endless harm upon subsequent generations."

Following vegetation destruction in arid and semi-arid regions, land forfeited its water retention capacity, and the localized humid microclimate forests created ceased existing. This further aggravated climatic and soil deterioration. In areas lacking irrigation infrastructure, agriculture became utterly dependent upon heaven's mercy. Agricultural yields per *mu* plummeted catastrophically. In North China and the Northwest prior to 1949, wheat yields of mere dozens of *jin* per *mu* represented normalcy.

"With diminished output, commoners could only cultivate additional land for survival. Yet the more land cultivated, the less it produced. Thus the cycle perpetuated—a thousand miles of fertile plains transformed into barren wasteland of windborne sand and denuded mountains. Now as Ming's national fortunes wane, gentry and officials demonstrate no concern for the populace. How can commoners refrain from rebellion?"

Having completed this extensive circuit, they finally returned to the thesis that "natural disasters equally constitute human calamities." Li Suiqiu silently contemplated the implications, discovering some novelty. Since antiquity, critiques of dynastic governance failures had revolved around "neglecting the people" and "dim rulers with treacherous ministers." People of that era, after all, could not comprehend natural disaster causation.

After pondering momentarily, Li Suiqiu inquired: "Since the Daoist Master frames matters thus, presumably the Council of Elders possesses extraordinarily ingenious methods for avoiding these human calamities?"

Cui Hantang responded with evident pride: "Naturally!"

Li Suiqiu assessed this Daoist as not merely corpulent but a supreme-grade boaster. Having proceeded this far, however, he wished to hear more. "Then please enlighten me."

"The ancients proclaimed: brute force overcomes all stratagems..." This pronouncement elicited Li Suiqiu's puzzled expression, whereupon Cui Hantang suddenly recalled this phrase originated only from the Qing Dynasty, swiftly correcting himself: "Those possessing genuine capability disregard petty tricks. Resolving the root of natural and human disasters resides in 'productive forces'!"

"What constitutes productive forces?"

"Well... consider one acre of land as example. Should our Council of Elders' Heaven and Earth Society cultivate it, growing identical rice, they can harvest several hundred *jin* more than local commoners. If every acre throughout the realm could yield fifty *jin* additional output, without requiring cultivation everywhere, commoners could achieve adequate sustenance and clothing. Even confronting disasters, they would not become starving corpses."

Li Suiqiu thought privately: what grandiose claims from this fellow! Though he did not directly manage farmland, he had lived rurally and thoroughly understood rent collection circumstances. Farming depended entirely upon heaven's favor; propitious weather meant a "great harvest." Yet such years might not arrive once per decade. Even during bumper years, each *mu* could yield merely an extra hundred-odd *jin* of rice. What agricultural secret could increase yields by several hundred *jin* per *mu*? Genuinely unprecedented.

Yet he did not doubt Cui Hantang's veracity, for news of the hair-thieves' "secret methods" for agriculture and manufacturing had long circulated. Those who had visited Qiongzhou Prefecture and Lingao enthusiastically recounted the hair-thieves' fields they had witnessed.

Were the hair-thieves to serve the Ming, current crises could achieve resolution. Li Suiqiu could not suppress secret regret. Setting aside their formidable ships and cannons, merely their capabilities in agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, and governance proved rare throughout the world. What tragedy!

"This unworthy student presumes productive forces represent methods for enhancing land yields?"

"Precisely. All trades and industries operate thus. Everything prioritizes developing productive forces. Ming has reached its current predicament because, fundamentally, productive forces prove insufficient. Population growth constitutes benefit, yet also signifies countless additional mouths requiring sustenance. Previously, one hundred *mu* fed one hundred individuals—everyone ate well and dressed warmly, with meat and wine during festivals and occasional new garments. Now, even cultivating all available land yields merely three hundred *mu*, yet population has expanded to one thousand. Yet yields per *mu* remain unchanged." Cui Hantang spoke with animation. "Moreover, among these thousand individuals, several dozen remain unsatisfied with merely consuming rice—they demand meat and wine daily, exchanging grain for fish and meat, silks and satins. Naturally many must starve."

"So if these thousand individuals' productive forces increase, even possessing only three hundred *mu*, provided yields increase, even should some desire meat and silk, none need starve?"

"Perhaps a handful of unfortunate souls might starve or experience hunger, yet not like presently where everyone must starve, compelled either to rebel and seize sustenance or simply perish and require no food... Consider our Council of Elders' Qiongzhou—though I dare not claim universal warmth and satiation, at minimum none starve." Cui Hantang sighed profoundly. "Since antiquity, commoners' desires have remained minimal, seeking solely sustenance and security. If even that cannot be provided, what legitimacy exists for occupying the throne?"

Though Li Suiqiu could not immediately fully grasp this "productive forces supremacy," he comprehended the final sentence—transparently criticizing the current Emperor.

Honestly, though the current Emperor had demonstrated some severity toward his tutors, arguably "obstructing remonstrance channels," they had likewise heard from capital acquaintances: His Majesty governed diligently, laboring from dawn until deep night, unprecedented in recent decades. Consequently many individuals, Li Suiqiu included, though harboring various opinions and dissatisfactions regarding Chongzhen's governance, still maintained considerable hope.

"My teacher proclaimed: 'The current Emperor neither loves wealth nor women, governs diligently and cherishes the people—a sage ruler of his generation.' Yet why does warfare rage everywhere with rebellions boiling over? Beyond insufficient productive forces, exist other reasons?"

"Diligent governance? Hehe." Cui Hantang could not suppress laughter. "Though Ming's predicament originated not from his actions, not only has improvement failed to materialize, but circumstances worsen daily—more than half attributable to his diligent governance! The more diligently he labors, the more rapidly Ming perishes!"

"How so?"

"He demonstrates excessive eagerness for results! The so-called good intentions paving hell's road—lacking capability, the more one attempts beneficence, the worse outcomes become! Examining his governance across these years, I would characterize him thus: suspicious by nature and fond of micromanagement, preferring severity and prone to fury. Micromanagement breeds harshness and ingratitude; proneness to rage generates hasty errors. With such an inconsistent individual as emperor, in my assessment his diligent governance constitutes merely reckless interference! Initially he executed eunuch Wei, then suppressed the Donglin—acceptable enough, remnants from previous reigns. Yet what explains changing chief ministers annually? National policies transform from morning to evening, leaving local officials bewildered. Someone of this character as emperor, lacking discernment in evaluating people, represents tragedy for Ming, for commoners, and for himself." Cui Hantang, speaking with mounting excitement, seized his teapot and unleashed torrential criticism with flying spittle.

"As the maxim states: 'Victory and defeat constitute military commonplaces.' Yet this sovereign—when employing generals, urgently presses for battle; when they fail, thoroughly investigates. During Chongzhen's second year, he executed Vice Minister of War Yang Hao. Year three witnessed execution of Jiliao Governor Liu Ce. Year three witnessed execution of Jiliao Supreme Commander Yuan Chonghuan. Year five brought execution of Governor Shen Qi. Year seven saw execution of Grand Canal Transport Commissioner Yang Yipeng. He exiled Minister of War Yan Mingtai, removed Xiong Mingyu from office, imprisoned Sun Chuanting, and demoted Sun Chengzong homeward to await death. Though these men all suffered defeat, they possessed genuine capability. Granted trust and authority, they might have achieved greatness. Merely due to singular failure, they faced execution. Those fortunate enough to survive grew so terrified that many committed suicide. An emperor who executes with such abandon will certainly eliminate all capable ministers and generals. Regardless of talent, everyone descends into panic, and none dare assume responsibility!"
