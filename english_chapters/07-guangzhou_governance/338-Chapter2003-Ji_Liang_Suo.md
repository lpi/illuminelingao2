# Chapter 2003 - Ji Liang Suo

However most women had home hard to return. Women sent to Pure Chaste Hall. Regardless voluntary or forced. Either family poor. One less mouth eating. Or family fighting for property. Fearing orphan widow occupying more benefit. Poor women truly sincere wanting to keep chastity determinedly. That was one two in hundred only.

Now Pure Chaste Hall although disassembled. To them was losing livelihood instead. When announcing Pure Chaste Hall disbanding initially. Everyone could go home respectively. Not only most people "Resisting Death Not Obeying." And almost caused human life accident. Making this "Virtuous Governance" almost having a nose of ash.

Later Liu San came specially opening several symposiums. Roughly understood Chaste Women unwilling to leave was not for "Keeping Chastity." But livelihood problem. Thus finally decided engaging "Production Self Help" in Shelter. Leaving to arrange gradually later.

"I want to see Pure Chaste Hall." Du Yibin opened door seeing mountain. "Also Ji Liang Suo."

This Director Deputy Director looked at each other one eye: This Chief coming asking nothing. Seeing nothing. Opening mouth wanting to see women. What routine is this?

However since Chief inspecting. Where he wanted to see naturally listening respect at convenience. Lu Weijia hurried said: "This easy. Arranging now."

"Chaste Women" lived in still past Pure Chaste Hall houses. Because increased women sheltered from similar institutions of whole province various places. Original houses not enough living. Repaired and built part of houses again. Dormitory equipped double deck bed and necessary washing utensils. Women carrying infants specially equipped room. Originally dirty messy environment also swept clean. Also built public toilet specially. Regardless peripheral environment or life condition all had big change.

"Chaste Women" no longer locked in small yard like past. Could act freely within range of Shelter. Spinning weaving in dark indoor was their only work in past. Now they either served as "Nanny" or "Waiter" in Shelter. Some undertook "Outer Distributing Processing." Mainly sewing various uniforms and making shoe uppers.

Saying work. Not relaxed. But work environment compared to past was bright hygienic. Also having sufficient food and rest. Making these women originally pale thin due to long term malnutrition and imprisonment life recover healthy face color. Originally bone thin like wood stick body also plump up.

Although Shelter rule very strict. But couldn't resist Hormone power. So Du Yibin finding Person in Charge in Shelter talking then felt self coming one step late. Naturalized personnel working in Shelter already "Using Power Seeking Private" "Gooding Up" with quite a few "Chaste Women." Said several pairs went to "Register."

"Have this matter?!" Du Yibin instantly head painful. Like this what fart I engage.

"Yes. Probably seven eight pairs." Lu Weijia seeing his face color very ugly. Hurried said. "This is agreed by Civil Affairs Department. Saying solving naturalized citizen marriage problem..."

"You also solve he also solve. How I solve?" Du Yibin quite unhappy. Feeling his work robbed. Mao Xiuyu misunderstood meaning. Thinking this Chief came to Pure Chaste Hall to "Select Beauty." Then leaned up said: "What good looking of these widows. Mostly thirty forty years old Half Old Xu Nian [middle-aged women]..."

Du Yibin originally annoyed. Pulled crooked by him even more heart annoying. Scolded: "You know a fart!"

Mao Xiuyu scared a jump. Hurried shutting mouth not talking.

"Now how many 'Chaste Women' you have here?"

"Chief. Last time file came. Asking us not calling them 'Chaste Women' again..." Lu Weijia said carefully.

"Oh. Right right." Du Yibin patted head. "Then how many widows?"

Lu Weijia dared not correct Chief words—Formal address is "Single Women"—Said: "Currently have three hundred nine persons. Among which twenty three persons have infant following body. Besides local city. Also have sent from outside prefecture."

"Age?"

Age composition relatively favorable. Only less than forty persons over fifty—Pure Chaste Hall life bitter and tiring. Chaste women usually lived not long. Among all age groups. Thirty to forty proportion highest.

This situation had big discrepancy with what he imagined. But three hundred plus people not few either. Even if half people truly want to keep chastity. Can solve marriage problem for hundred plus naturalized citizens too.

Two Directors seeing his face color cloudy sunny uncertain. Sometimes murmuring to self. Didn't know what crazy this Chief fit exactly. Half sound. He then said: "Go. To Ji Liang Suo. Seeing prostitutes."

"Chief. Pure Chaste Hall not seeing..."

"Say later!"

Two people dared not disobey. Had to take him to Ji Liang Suo again.

Ji Liang Suo set in originally barren horrible Back Garden. Residual corpses here already cleaned. Built several groups of temporary sheds. Broken wall also repaired with bamboo fence. Periphery also set Petition Police sentry box—Although public security outside city turned better. But still had small amount scattered bandit robber activity. Robbery. Killing and Theft happened occasionally at night.

Middle lower class prostitute social relation complex. Three teachings nine streams people all contacted. For facilitating education also preventing accident appearing. Here was completely closed management. Students could only act inside Ji Liang Suo.

"Chief!"

Seeing them arriving. A young naturalized female cadre welcomed up.

"You are..."

"I am Lu Cheng. From Guangzhou City Women Federation. Currently in charge of Ji Liang Suo work."

"Married or not?" Du Yibin asked suddenly.

"Ah?" Lu Cheng scared a jump. "No... Not..."

"Why not marry?"

Lu Cheng contacted quite a few Senators. Haven't met anyone with such style. Thinking what this Chief wants. Don't tell me looked upon self? "Work busy. Didn't meet suitable..."

"Work busy is not excuse." Du Yibin thought. Obviously here has single female cadre. There has no wife. "Must find a cadre soldier to marry quickly!"

Lu Cheng baffled. Heart said this businesses your fart matter! But mouth still crisp agile said: "Yes! I as soon as possible!"

Lu Weijia thought what routine is this Chief exactly? Coming inspecting ought see not seeing. Ought ask not asking. Just staring at "Chaste Woman" and "Prostitute." Mao Xiuyu had another plan. Don't tell me this Chief came here seeking maid to accomplish concubine? But since Chiefs rich possessing four seas. Why necessary finding here. Truly can't think through.

Lu Cheng roughly introduced Ji Liang Suo situation. Here currently sheltered near five hundred prostitutes declaring unwilling to continue engaging in this industry in Rectifying Wind Transformation Action. Source included Guangzhou Prefecture subordinate various prefectures counties. These prostitutes mostly middle lower class prostitutes. Family poor sold. Family mostly lost news. Eyes looking no relatives locally. Because cheap prostitutes. Exploited by Old Bustard Leading Family heavily. Body without any savings. Some also had various diseases.

"...After they arriving here. Helped them doing purification. Also treated disease. Now developing Production Self Help activity..."

"How is situation of these prostitutes?"

"Female students emotion still stable." Lu Cheng didn't correct Chief word directly. "They mostly background very bitter. Suffered exploitation and abuse in brothel. Can come here all grateful to Senate."

"Have any problem?"

Front words were scene words. Lu Cheng entered Political Security Training Class. Knowing Chief valued "Existing Problem" most.

"Emotion has. Mainly relatively pessimistic to future life. And has Loving Leisure Hating Labor tendency."

Long term prostitute life made them mostly lose labor consciousness. Formed delicious lazy. Muddling along life habit. So although developed "Production Self Help" for them. But production efficiency couldn't reach half of "Single Women."

"Some people quite resisting labor." Lu Cheng speaking full belly gas. "Under Old Bustard Turtle Slave hand scared like a quail. Dare not speak words; Arriving Ji Liang Suo one by one like monkey opened lock. Clever teeth sharp mouth can choke you back breath! Seeing us good heart. Committing rules not vague a bit..."

Looks like. Lu Cheng suffered quite some gas in Ji Liang Suo. Mao Xiuyu hurried echoing said: "This gang of bit... students terrible. Every one is Rolling Knife Meat [tough meat/brazen]. Face skin thick! Skin on butt also thick! Committing mistake beating rattan useless to them a bit. Finishing beating lifting pants still want to joke a few sentences: Saying what Old Mother kneeled iron chain. Branded fire chopstick. These few hits just serve as scratching itch... Truly know not shame!"

"They suffered torture in brothel in past. Our little corporal punishment has no deterrence to them..." Lu Weijia said. "So I say still need mainly education. Cannot rely on corporal punishment..."

Du Yibin listening brows frowned more. Such woman how can serve as naturalized citizen wife? Disabled naturalized citizen need not think more. By then maybe making out "Wu Dalang" [husband murdered by wife] kind matters. Wang Jun this guy truly unreliable!

He already had heart wanting to beat retreat drum. However person already at door—Just now he already didn't go to Pure Chaste Hall. Not going again this time inevitably appeared too rough.

Petition police opened door. Leveled mud ground paved white lime sand. Seven "Long Houses" built sequentially—Bamboo pole wood material as bone. Bamboo strip reed mat as wall. Covered a layer of yellow mud above. Brushed white lime again. Looking reasonably neat clean. Gap ground between Long Houses were rows of drying cloth poles. Hung full of woman clothes. Wind blowing like Universal Flags generally. Although this spacetime didn't have brief bra stocking kind of things. But with Du Yibin knowledge also knew mostly women undergarments. Involuntarily slightly somewhat awkward.

Mao Xiuyu thought he felt unlucky. Then low voice to Lu Cheng said: "Directory Lu. You see if call them collect down first—Hindering view..."

"No need collect." Du Yibin heard this word. More somewhat angry. Scolded. "Drying several clothes has what relation? Making big fuss over small issue!"

"Yes. Yes. Yes." Mao Xiuyu immediately bent waist hunched back. Making a "Small Person Deserve Die" look. Shrank to back.

Only scarce few "Female Students" on empty ground. Some squatting by well washing clothes. Some sitting on chair at Long House door napping. Lu Cheng said most people working in workshop. These were sick ones.
