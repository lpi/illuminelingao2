# Chapter 2003 - Jiliang Institute

However, most of the women had no homes to return to. Women sent to the Chastity Halls—whether voluntarily or by force—came from families either too poor to feed another mouth or embroiled in property disputes where orphans and widows were feared to occupy too much inheritance. Of those genuinely and sincerely determined to preserve their chastity, perhaps one or two in a hundred.

Now that the Chastity Halls had been dissolved, these women had lost their livelihood. When the disbanding was initially announced and everyone was told they could go home, not only did most "resist unto death," they nearly caused fatalities. The "virtuous governance" initiative almost ended up with egg on its face.

Later, Liu San came specially to conduct several symposiums. He came to understand that the chaste women's unwillingness to leave wasn't about "preserving chastity" but about livelihood. Thus it was finally decided to implement "productive self-help" programs at the shelter, leaving gradual arrangements for later.

"I want to see the former Chastity Hall," Du Yibin said bluntly. "And the Jiliang Institute."

The Director and Deputy Director exchanged glances. *This chief has come asking about nothing, seeing nothing—and now opens his mouth asking to see the women. What's his game?*

However, since the chief was inspecting, wherever he wanted to see, they would naturally comply. Lu Weijia hurried to say: "That's easy. I'll arrange it now."

The "chaste women" still lived in the former Chastity Hall buildings. Because they'd taken in women sheltered from similar institutions throughout the province, the original buildings had become inadequate. Repairs and new construction had provided dormitories equipped with double-decker beds and necessary washing facilities. Women carrying infants were specially provided separate rooms. The originally filthy, chaotic environment had been swept clean. A public toilet had been specially built. Both the surrounding environment and living conditions had undergone dramatic improvements.

The "chaste women" were no longer locked in small courtyards as in the past. They could move freely within the shelter's boundaries. Spinning and weaving in dark rooms had been their only work before; now they served as "nannies" or "attendants" within the shelter. Some undertook "outbound processing"—mainly sewing various uniforms and making shoe uppers.

The work was by no means light. But the work environment, compared to the past, was bright and hygienic. With sufficient food and rest, these women—originally pale and thin from long-term malnutrition and confinement—had recovered healthy complexions. Their previously skeletal frames had filled out.

Although the shelter's rules were quite strict, they couldn't resist the power of hormones. When Du Yibin spoke with the person in charge, he realized he'd come one step too late. Naturalized personnel working at the shelter had already "used their positions for private gain," partnering up with quite a few "chaste women." Several pairs had even gone to register.

"This happened?!" Du Yibin's head instantly throbbed. *What the hell am I supposed to do now?*

"Yes. About seven or eight pairs." Seeing his face darken, Lu Weijia hurried to say, "This was approved by the Civil Affairs Department. They said it was to solve the naturalized citizen marriage problem..."

"You solve it, he solves it—how am I supposed to solve it?" Du Yibin was quite displeased, feeling his work had been stolen. Mao Xiuyu misunderstood, thinking this chief had come to the Chastity Hall to "select beauties." He leaned in and said, "These widows aren't much to look at. Most are thirty or forty years old—middle-aged matrons..."

Du Yibin, already annoyed, found himself pulled even further off course by this nonsense. "You don't know shit!" he snapped.

Mao Xiuyu jumped, startled, and hurried to shut his mouth.

"How many 'chaste women' do you have here now?"

"Chief, the last directive came down saying we shouldn't call them 'chaste women' anymore..." Lu Weijia said carefully.

"Oh. Right, right." Du Yibin patted his head. "Then how many widows?"

Lu Weijia didn't dare correct the chief's terminology—the formal designation was "single women"—and said: "Currently we have three hundred and nine persons. Among them, twenty-three have infants. Besides locals, we also have those sent from outside prefectures."

"Ages?"

The age composition was relatively favorable. Fewer than forty were over fifty—life in the Chastity Halls had been bitter and exhausting, and chaste women typically didn't live long. Among all age groups, the thirty-to-forty bracket had the highest proportion.

This situation differed significantly from what he'd imagined. But three hundred-plus people wasn't a small number. Even if half genuinely wished to preserve their chastity, that could still solve the marriage problem for over a hundred naturalized citizens.

The two directors watched his expression shift between cloudy and clear, occasionally muttering to himself. They had no idea what ailment possessed this chief. After a long moment, he suddenly said: "Let's go. To the Jiliang Institute. I want to see the prostitutes."

"Chief, about the Chastity Hall—aren't you going to inspect it?"

"Later!"

The two didn't dare disobey. They had no choice but to lead him to the Jiliang Institute.

---

The Jiliang Institute was located in what had once been a desolate, eerie back garden. The corpses that had littered the area had been cleaned away. Several groups of temporary sheds had been built. The broken walls had been repaired with bamboo fencing. Guard posts had been set up at the perimeter—although public security outside the city had improved, there were still scattered bandits and robbers active. Robbery, murder, and theft still occurred occasionally at night.

Lower-class prostitutes had complex social relationships, contacts across all walks of life. To facilitate education and prevent incidents, the institute was completely closed-management. Students could only move within the Jiliang Institute grounds.

"Chief!"

Seeing them arrive, a young naturalized female cadre hurried forward.

"You are...?"

"I'm Lu Cheng, from the Guangzhou City Women's Federation. I'm currently in charge of the work at Jiliang Institute."

"Are you married?" Du Yibin asked suddenly.

"Ah?" Lu Cheng jumped, startled. "No... not..."

"Why not?"

Lu Cheng had dealt with quite a few Senators, but she'd never met one with this style. *What does this chief want? Don't tell me he's taken a fancy to me?* "Work has been busy. I haven't met anyone suitable..."

"Work being busy is no excuse." Du Yibin thought: *Obviously there are single female cadres here, and single men there.* "You need to quickly find a cadre or soldier to marry!"

Lu Cheng was baffled. *What business is this of yours?!* But her mouth remained crisply efficient: "Yes! I'll do so as soon as possible!"

Lu Weijia wondered: *What exactly is this chief's routine?* He came to inspect but didn't look at what he should, didn't ask what he should. He just stared at "chaste women" and "prostitutes." Mao Xiuyu had another theory: *Don't tell me this chief came here seeking a maid to make into a concubine?* But since chiefs possessed the wealth of the four seas, why would they need to look here? He truly couldn't figure it out.

Lu Cheng gave a rough introduction to the Jiliang Institute's situation. Currently, they sheltered nearly five hundred prostitutes who'd declared unwillingness to continue in the industry during the Public Morality Rectification campaign. The sources included various prefectures and counties subordinate to Guangzhou Prefecture. These prostitutes were mostly middle and lower-class. Those from poor families who'd been sold, most of whom had lost contact with their families. Locally, they had no relatives. As cheap prostitutes heavily exploited by madams and pimps, they had no savings. Some also suffered various diseases.

"...After they arrived here, we helped them undergo purification. We also treated their diseases. Now we're developing productive self-help activities..."

"What's the situation with these prostitutes?"

"The female students' morale is still stable." Lu Cheng didn't directly correct the chief's terminology. "Most of them have very bitter backgrounds. They suffered exploitation and abuse in the brothels. Everyone who's come here is grateful to the Senate."

"Are there any problems?"

The previous words had been diplomatic. Lu Cheng had attended Political Security training classes. She knew chiefs valued "existing problems" most.

"Emotionally, there are some. Mainly they're quite pessimistic about future life. And they have a tendency to love leisure and hate labor."

Long-term prostitution had caused most of them to lose work consciousness, forming habits of self-indulgence and muddling through. So although "productive self-help" programs had been developed for them, their production efficiency couldn't reach half that of the "single women."

"Some are quite resistant to labor." Lu Cheng spoke with a belly full of grievances. "Under the madams' and pimps' control they were scared like quails, didn't dare speak a word. Arriving at the Jiliang Institute, every one of them is like a monkey freed from its lock—sharp-tongued, can choke you breathless! Seeing that we're kindhearted, they don't hesitate to break the rules..."

It appeared Lu Cheng had suffered considerable frustration at the Jiliang Institute. Mao Xiuyu hurried to chime in: "This gang of bit—students—they're terrible! Every one is thick-skinned and shameless! Corporal punishment is completely useless on them. After a beating, they pull up their pants and still want to crack jokes, saying things like 'Old Mother endured iron chains and fire brands—these few hits are just scratching an itch'... Truly shameless!"

"They suffered torture in the brothels in the past. Our minor corporal punishment holds no deterrence for them..." Lu Weijia said. "That's why I say we still need to rely mainly on education. We can't depend on corporal punishment..."

Du Yibin listened, his brow furrowing deeper. *How could such women serve as naturalized citizens' wives? Disabled naturalized citizens needn't even think about it—they might end up like Wu Dalang.* That Wang Jun fellow was truly unreliable!

He already had the urge to beat a retreat. However, he was already at the door—just now he'd already skipped the Chastity Hall inspection. To skip this one too would appear far too perfunctory.

The guard opened the door. The leveled mud ground was covered with white lime sand. Seven "long houses" were built in sequence—bamboo poles and timber for frames, bamboo strips and reed mats for walls, covered with a layer of yellow mud and whitewashed with lime. They looked reasonably neat and clean. In the gaps between the long houses were rows of drying poles hung full of women's clothing. When the wind blew, they fluttered like banners. Though this era lacked brassieres and stockings, with Du Yibin's knowledge he could tell these were mostly women's undergarments. He felt involuntarily somewhat awkward.

Mao Xiuyu thought the chief found it inauspicious and said in a low voice to Lu Cheng: "Director Lu, see if you can have them collect those—they're obstructing the view..."

"No need to collect them." Du Yibin heard this and grew even angrier. "What difference does drying a few clothes make? Making a fuss over nothing!"

"Yes, yes, yes." Mao Xiuyu immediately bent his waist and hunched his back, making a "this lowly one deserves death" expression and shrank to the back.

Only a sparse few "female students" were on the open ground. Some squatted by the well washing clothes. Some sat in chairs by the long house doors napping. Lu Cheng said most people were working in the workshop. These were the sick ones.
