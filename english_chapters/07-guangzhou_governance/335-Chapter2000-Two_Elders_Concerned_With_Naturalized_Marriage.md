# Chapter 2000 - Two Elders Concerned With Naturalized Marriage

"But surely with so many prisoners under Fu Youdi's jurisdiction, there must be some suitable ones," Du Yibin asked, unwilling to give up.

"If we look, there'll definitely be some who match your conditions, but the number is probably far from enough—especially under your plan: two... even three wives per person..." Ran Yao was frankly rather surprised reading this clause.

With the current gender ratio of the population under the Council of Elders' control, never mind two wives—even one wife per person couldn't be achieved. This Elder Du was being quite generous, giving out two at once! Not only did the prisons simply not have enough "eligible female inmates," even if they did, there was no way to arrange things this way.

"There's another way—get the Portuguese to go to Goa and buy Indian women over. Even in the twenty-first century, Indian women's status was very low, never mind the seventeenth century. Worst case, we just spend more money!"

Going overseas to "buy wives" for naturalized citizens had been proposed by different Elders on various occasions. These "Human Complementation Plans" had all failed to pass due to enormous costs. The most critical issue was that slave trading required local agents with generous profit margins.

Beyond economic reasons, some argued this would artificially create "mixed blood," causing the second generation of naturalized citizens to become impure "descendants of Huaxia"—in short, considerable controversy.

"...Also, the widows from Guangzhou's Qingjie Hall—remaining widowed wastes resources! We should mobilize all of them to remarry."

Ran Yao frowned: "Many naturalized citizens don't even have wives. Assigning two or three at once to these disabled people—the optics really won't be good."

"That's why I hope for small-scale, non-public weddings."

Du Yibin's rambling speech made Ran Yao laugh. He thought this young man had commendable courage but was too idealistic.

"Being this generous, the Planning Committee will devour you." Ran Yao shook his head. "Finding wives for disabled soldiers was done in the fifties for disabled Korean War veterans. They didn't give each of them two wives either."

"Well, times are different—a few wives doesn't matter..."

"Take out the clause about two wives per person—it's too divorced from reality. Doing it your way turns it into something secretive. We're promoting 'one husband, one wife' after all."

"What about costs?" Ran Yao said. "This would be huge. Right now disabled naturalized citizens' wages are enough for personal subsistence, but raising a family would be hard. This economic situation simply can't keep a wife around!"

"But this would win hearts and minds..."

"Winning hearts and minds also has costs." Ran Yao laughed. "I can co-sign a proposal for overseas purchasing. But forget about female prisoners. As for Qingjie Hall women—talk to Liu Xiang."

Ran Yao watched him leave and lit up the Chuqing-edition cigar. "This IT guy has quite a lot of gimmicks. Eyeing up the female prisoners is just to save money."

Du Yibin ran around Guangzhou for days. Clear responses were few. In the end, only an Elder named Wang Jun responded to his call.

This Elder Wang was one of several marginal Elders dispatched to Guangzhou during the Two Guangs offensive. His most important title was "Chief Engineer, Ministry of Machinery"—a title for engineering Elders without administrative positions.

Elder Wang's presence in Lingao was quite low. His specialty was automotive electronics construction and maintenance—too disconnected from current productive forces. During the steam engine era, there was no business for him. He knew nothing about high voltage. He'd become a jack-of-all-trades in machinery, currently maintaining the vehicles and equipment brought through the crossing, while learning to repair steam engines.

After the Two Guangs offensive began, he was dispatched to Guangzhou for mechanical maintenance at the temporary shipyard on Henan Island.

This work was demanding and important. Elder Wang felt stuck in a "forgotten corner," pondering whether to start some "project" to demonstrate his presence.

Du Yibin's memorandum arrived—distributed to all Elders in Guangdong regardless of relevance.

Elder Wang, like other Elders, "always attached importance" to solving naturalized citizens' marriage problems, but wasn't impressed with Elder Du's specific solutions.

"Female prisoners, female prisoners—where would you get so many?" Wang Jun thought. "Buying foreign women is more realistic."

He'd always found it strange: why was Quark Qiong's slave-trading activity in Southeast Asia limited to males? Women were equally good laborers—using them to solve naturalized citizens' marriage problems would kill two birds with one stone.

Suddenly, he recalled shipyard workers mentioning that local natives were quite interested in naturalized workers, often asking about their income and marital status.

"Right—we should solve this locally after all!"
