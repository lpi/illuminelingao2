# Chapter 2034 - Perseverance

"Furthermore, now they're spending money to build these arches and flower platforms, sponsoring the wedding—where does all this spent money end up?"

This stumped Song Yingsheng—he had never considered this question.

"Doesn't the money spent still end up in the hands of poor commoners, ordinary folk?" Du Yibin knew that concepts like "stimulating consumption" were rarely understood in 17th-century China. Most people still held to the thinking of "agriculture as the foundation" and "valuing agriculture while despising commerce." For them, currency's main function was to store value—silver should be hidden in jars and buried underground.

"Building all these flower platforms and arches first let the flower farmers of Henan District make some money. Building platforms and arches also requires many decorative craftsmen, carpenters, laborers... Thus money ends up in craftsmen's hands—doesn't everyone benefit from the collective wedding?

"Sir surely knows that it's much easier for the rich to make money than the poor. Wealthy merchants move beads on an abacus, flip through ledgers, and white silver flows in every day. Even rural landlords, with no regular income, collect rent when the season comes, gaining money and grain for nothing from their land. The poor rise before dawn to work, can't sleep until after dark, toil all day yet earn only a few copper coins—barely enough to maintain food and clothing. No matter how frugal, they can't save much. If any trouble comes, they must borrow to survive. Now the rich spend money for face, craftsmen and flower farmers gain benefits—everyone benefits. Why not?"

Song Yingsheng nodded unconsciously.

"If these wealthy men were all extremely frugal, spending nothing beyond their own food and clothing, hiding everything underground—today these decorative craftsmen, carpenters, laborers, florists, and Henan District flower farmers would all earn no money. Unable to buy grain, unable to feed their wives and families..."

"So you're saying wasteful spending is actually good?"

Though Song Yingsheng somewhat accepted his words, deep down he remained unconvinced. In his view, flowers and decorations couldn't satisfy hunger when starving or warm you when cold. Once demolished, they became useless waste. He particularly couldn't abide such waste.

Du Yibin thought: You're shifting the goalposts! But he could only say pleasantly: "Spending money and wasteful spending are not the same thing—please note, sir."

In Song Yingsheng's view, they were the same thing. The Song family in Jiangxi was a typical landowner household that combined farming with scholarly pursuits. Such families held a certain amount of land with stable income, had family members with degrees or who had served as officials, but weren't particularly prominent. In economic terms, they were roughly middle level. Therefore, family rules and traditions emphasized "frugality," with very strict control over consumption expenses. Song Yingsheng, raised in such a family, naturally couldn't abide the Council of Elders' extravagance.

"...Even wasteful spending sometimes isn't a bad thing. Everything has two sides." Du Yibin didn't bother watching the shoreline scenery, continuing to debate with this old pedant. "I have a little story here: A scholar going to the capital examinations arrived at an inn and produced one tael of silver, wanting to inspect the best room. If satisfied, he'd stay; if not, he'd leave. The scholar went to see the room. The innkeeper immediately used the silver to pay off his debt at the rice shop next door. The rice shop owner went straight to the butcher to pay his meat bill. The butcher used the money to pay the pig farmer. The pig farmer immediately paid off his credit for bean cakes. The bean cake merchant rushed to the inn to pay off his room debt. Just like that, the one tael of silver returned to the innkeeper's hands. At this point, the scholar said the room wasn't suitable and left with his silver. You see, the innkeeper didn't earn a single coin, yet everyone cleared their debts and everyone benefited. Money circulating back and forth, used countless times, creates wealth from thin air, supporting countless common people. If everyone were frugal, just hiding silver at home, burying it underground—what good would it be? Nothing but a lump of metal!"

This was a little story Ma Yinchu had told about economics, simply and clearly expressing currency's "liquidity." But this concept was too novel for Song Yingsheng; he was somewhat confused. He pondered a long while, trying to find the secret in it, but couldn't untangle any thread.

Du Yibin, having finally gained the upper hand, felt rather pleased. He quickly added several more points: "Our Council of Elders holding this collective wedding, having the rich sponsor it—this is also redistributing from rich to poor. Everyone's satisfied, society is harmonious—truly everyone's happy..."

"There are so many poor people in the world—can the Council of Elders really save them all?"

Good, that's a good question! Du Yibin thought. According to the traditional time-travel novel formula, this proved the other party's heart was wavering.

"There are millions upon millions of poor people in the world. To say the Council of Elders can save everyone would be a lie. But since our Council of Elders returned to China, we've been determined to let the realm's poor people live like 'humans,' not be 'two-legged sheep' generation after generation!" Du Yibin spoke with heroic spirit, feeling quite good about himself.

Yet Song Yingsheng didn't show the expected "excitement" or "bow in submission." He only lowered his head, sighed softly, seeming not to believe his words. Du Yibin had to continue:

"Take this collective wedding. Though not many people benefit, it expresses an attitude of the Council of Elders. As long as common people are willing to bid farewell to the old society, live according to the new society's order, and work diligently—regardless of their background, age, or gender—the Council of Elders will look after their welfare: not only ensuring they have food and clothing, but letting them live good lives, have their own families and children, with lineage unbroken..."

He had originally wanted to add: "Those who still cling to the decadent, backward notion that starving to death is a small matter while losing chastity is a great matter, those stubborn suicidal types who don't choose purification, can just hurry up and die." But on second thought, the threatening component was too strong. Song Yingsheng, who in the old timeline could have died for the Ming dynasty, had a very firm heart—such threats would instead provoke his resistance. So he swallowed the words.

Song Yingsheng didn't know whether to laugh or cry, knowing that his constant praising of the Council of Elders was just to make him surrender. He had to speak frankly:

"Chief Du, you once kept me here by saying you needed to govern Enping well. Though it wasn't my wish, I could barely accept it. But now the bandits in various parts of Zhaoqing have been pacified. This student is just a scholar—can't carry loads on my shoulders or lift with my hands, ignorant of the seasons and crops, knowing neither astronomy nor calendars, unskilled in crafts or commerce. At most, I can write a few eight-legged examination essays. What benefit is there in forcing this student to stay?"

Du Yibin thought: Finally some progress! Who told the textbooks to call your third brother the great Eastern scientist of the 17th century, and the *Tiangong Kaiwu* the encyclopedia of Chinese 17th-century crafts?

Though quite a few Elders dismissed Song Yingxing and his writings—after all, from their knowledge perspective, these achievements were insignificant—most Elders believed: in medieval China, intellectuals like Song Yingxing who could achieve "unity of knowledge and action" with scientific consciousness were very rare. Though his knowledge was insignificant to people from the old timeline, such talent had great symbolic value, and might still have considerable untapped potential.

Du Yibin thought, fine then, let's speak frankly. He considered and said:

"First, you served as an official with integrity and ability, contributing to the locality. You're a qualified administrative talent, and our Great Song is in need of people—naturally we hope talented people like you will stay to benefit the people. Second, before long, our Council of Elders will recover Jiangxi—the Song family has prestige and reputation there, which would help us stabilize Jiangxi's situation. Third, there's your third brother Song Yingxing."

The first two points weren't surprising; Song Yingsheng had guessed most of it. But this matter of his third brother—he remained puzzled: why were these Australians so interested in his third brother that they would detain him out of extended association, spending so much effort to persuade him to surrender?

"We've seen the book your third brother Song Yingxing wrote while teaching at Fenyi County School. Your brother Song Yingxing's talent is truly amazing! So I very much hope both you brothers will serve our Council of Elders, rather than letting your talents be buried in Ming's hands."

These words made Song Yingsheng feel bewildered. Though he and his third brother had stood out in the Jiangxi provincial examination in the 43rd year of Wanli—his brother ranking third in the province, himself ranking sixth, with only the two of them passing from all of Fengxin—a sensation at the time called "The Two Songs of Fengxin"—afterwards they had no further success in examinations. They hardly counted as "talent." As for his brother's usual writings, they were merely about farming methods and crafts—nothing extraordinary.

He smiled bitterly: What could the Australians possibly see in him and his brother? Yet vaguely, he felt somewhat proud of this.

Speaking of which, since his capture, he had watched the Australians' governance along the way. Everywhere they went, things took on a new aspect. Arriving in Guangzhou, this feeling grew even stronger. Though he often privately grumbled when seeing new things—especially those related to women—the common people's lives were indeed better than before. Walking the streets, even the commoners' complexions seemed healthier than before.

Calling them both "benevolent" and "capable" wasn't an exaggeration. Unlike some Elders within the Council, Song Yingsheng, as a traditional official, didn't view the Australians' hanging people along the way and later mass arrests and executions as "cruel"—because these were normal in medieval society. Moreover, the Australians killed and arrested based on evidence, didn't kill innocents indiscriminately, and didn't cast a wide net of persecution—calling them "benevolent" wasn't wrong at all.

As for "capable"—setting aside their orderly governance of Guangzhou, just this collective wedding that satisfied all parties had incalculable impact. Probably many poor commoners would now make up their minds: to shave their heads and join the hair-thieves.
