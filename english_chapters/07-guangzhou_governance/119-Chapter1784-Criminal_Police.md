# Chapter 1784 - Criminal Police

It was already 5 AM when the Municipal Bureau Criminal Investigation Division received the report from the police station. After receiving the report, the police station had found it a bit unbelievable. To prevent a false alarm, they first sent someone to the scene to check: there was nothing at the scene. Let alone a corpse, not even a scrap of cloth remained. This made the station hesitant. However, seeing Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui swearing oaths that they had seen it with their own eyes, the station chief felt he couldn't be careless, so he sent a messenger to the Municipal Bureau to report.

The only officers in the Municipal Bureau Criminal Investigation Division who could barely be called criminal police were the five naturalized detectives transferred from Lingao. The Chief of the CID was Wu Xiang. Though only in his early twenties, he was the most senior detective among them, with a "distinguished" background: the first class of the Police Administration Course at Fangcaodi National School. Moreover, he was a "top student" personally mentored by Mu Min.

Wu Xiang also found the report odd. He had followed Mu Min in Hainan, Jeju, and Taiwan, seeing all kinds of homicide scenes. Even if no corpse was left, there would inevitably remain physical evidence like bloodstains, bloody clothes, or weapons. A case solely based on the report of two patrol officers like this was unheard of.

Although there was no corpse, a murder was still a murder. Since these two patrolmen insisted there had indeed been a corpse, a site investigation was necessary.

However, the CID was currently extremely busy. Due to its location and large population and commerce, Guangzhou's public order situation was very chaotic. No city in the Senatorial Council's controlled areas could compare. Upon entering the city, during the transition between the old and new regimes, crimes occurred frequently. At the peak, there were as many as a hundred robbery and theft cases in the city in a single day. If not for the Military Control Commission using heavy penalties in troubled times, adopting a policy of immediate arrest, trial, and execution for malignant criminals, coupled with uninterrupted day and night patrols by the army, the security situation would not have been stabilized in such a short time.

Even so, criminal cases within the city remained frequent. Theft, robbery, and murder happened from time to time, and the CID was overwhelmed—Wu Xiang himself had five or six cases to handle. Since this case had no corpse and it was uncertain if it could even be formally filed, Wu Xiang sent two detectives to take a look at the scene first and talk to the patrolmen.

In the CID, the only ones who had received formal criminal police training were those few naturalized officers transferred from Lingao. To cope with the criminal cases of such a large city with hundreds of thousands of people, this was obviously insufficient. Therefore, a batch of local Guangzhou officers was recruited on the spot.

The backbone of this group consisted of bodyguards from the Qiwie Escort Agency who had been engaged in "shop-sitting" and "courtyard-guarding" locally. They weren't numerous, but they were very familiar with Guangzhou's society and people. As personnel of the earliest traditional enterprise controlled by the Senatorial Council, Qiwie staff were naturally considered "politically reliable."

Another part consisted of retained runners from the original "Fast Band" (detectives/thief-takers). Both regular and "white body" (unofficial) runners were included. After several rounds of purging the Detective Squad, those remaining were those with "minor historical crimes and no blood debts." The Senatorial Council didn't consider this group very reliable, but they were extremely familiar with the "Three Religions and Nine Schools" (various sects of society) and the "city foxes and social rats" (petty criminals) of Guangzhou, which was very useful for police work. Thus, they were added to the CID.

The two detectives sent were Gao Chongjiu, a retained runner from the Fast Band, and Li Zhenguo, a former bodyguard from the Qiwie Escort Agency.

Li Zhenguo was a son of a landlord. He loved martial arts from a young age and could wield a single saber with wind-generating speed by age twelve. At sixteen, the Li family had a conflict with a neighboring rich family over land property. The other side bribed bandits to assassinate Li Zhenguo's grandfather and father. In a rage, Li Zhenguo killed several people from the opposing side. He naturally couldn't stay in his hometown, so he took his family, changed his name, and fled to Guangdong to seek refuge with fellow villagers. From then on, he became a bodyguard at Qiwie.

Due to his family background, he couldn't endure the hardships of traveling escorts but was relatively articulate. He spent years "shop-sitting" in the city, interacting with people of all shades and becoming very knowledgeable about various trickery. So after entering the city, he was listed as a key target for detective training. Both Mu Min and Wu Xiang had personally guided him through some cases.

Although neither of them had received formal criminal police training, their past work was somewhat similar to that of criminal police, and they had rich social experience. Having interned with the detectives for over a month, they had learned quite a lot of criminal investigation thinking and techniques. With the CID short-staffed and overloaded, they were considered ready for independent duty.

The two rushed to the local police station. Seeing that the Municipal Bureau had indeed sent detectives, the station chief didn't dare neglect them and personally took them to the scene—where Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui were still keeping watch.

But upon arriving at the scene, there really wasn't much of a lead. There were no traces left on the ground. The two examined the spot where the corpse was reportedly found for a long time but didn't see any suspicious residual traces.

Gao Chongjiu was an old hand at public affairs. He talked with Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui again and felt they didn't look like they were "possessed." Saying their eyes were blurred by the darkness didn't make sense either—a corpse isn't a small stone on the ground; for two people to hallucinate simultaneously wasn't easy.

"Master Li, even if it wasn't a corpse, it must be something of similar size and shape to make sense," Gao Chongjiu said after circling the scene for a while.

Li Zhenguo nodded. Though a martial artist, the bodyguard was meticulous and well-versed in worldly affairs. He also felt Li Ziyu couldn't be mistaken.

Since they couldn't be mistaken, where did the corpse or corpse-like object go? Obviously, regardless of whether what Li Ziyu saw was a corpse, it wasn't a living thing and couldn't walk by itself. The only possibility was that someone moved it while Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui left to find help.

Since it was moved, it meant they originally didn't intend to dump it on the street. Most likely, they saw the patrolmen's lantern light during transport and fled in panic, abandoning the corpse. Later, finding the police had left, they returned to move it.

The question was: where was it moved to? And where was it originally moved from?

The person moving the corpse must have hidden nearby after dropping it, watching Li Ziyu leave the scene before returning. Where could they hide?

Li Zhenguo looked at the surrounding environment. The alley the police patrolled was a north-south long street called Scissors Lane. Next to it was a nameless branch alley. During the street sign and house number census in the previous phase, it was numbered "Scissors Lane East Branch Alley 7," meaning the seventh branch alley on the east side of Scissors Lane. This alley wasn't deep. Standing at the entrance, one could see it was typical of a back alley for a large household or temple, ending at a river pier.

Opposite the mouth of this branch alley was another branch alley, "Scissors Lane West Branch Alley 11." Although the two alleys were opposite, they didn't form a perfect crossroad; actually, the West Branch Alley 11 was another twenty steps south.

Li Zhenguo estimated the corpse mover likely hid in "Scissors Lane West Branch Alley 11." First, although it was dark at the time of the incident, the road section was straight with no place to hide nearby. If someone were close, Li Ziyu wouldn't have failed to notice. And Li Ziyu had gone into East Branch Alley 7.

The key now was: where did this "corpse" go? Without a corpse, their work was rootless wood, a complete waste of time.

Li Ziyu stood aside watching them circle this small area, feeling very nervous. If this turned out to be a "false report," he would have to bear the consequences—perhaps even lose his job.

Thinking of this, Li Ziyu couldn't help secretly regretting not listening to the watchman's advice to just pretend he didn't know.

Zhao Gui stood there foolishly, scratching his crotch from time to time. Li Ziyu didn't know if he was really stupid or just pretending. *This guy sure is calm! Indeed, idiots are broad-hearted.*

Besides scratching his crotch, Zhao Gui occasionally waved his hand to shoo away flies.

Sanitation in the alleys was poor; trash and puddles were everywhere. As the weather turned hot, flies naturally multiplied.

But these few flies saved Li Ziyu. Gao Chongjiu suddenly said, "Master Li, look at the ground!"

It turned out there were several spots on the ground at the alley mouth where many flies were gathering, buzzing around. But looking closely, there was neither trash nor feces where they gathered. Beneath was either mud or crushed stone paving. Nothing that should attract flies.

But for an old catcher like Gao Chongjiu, this was enough: no filth, yet swarms of flies gathering. This indicated there had been bloodstains there, and not a small amount. Although it had seeped into the soil overnight and was hard for human eyes to spot, it couldn't fool the flies. This also matched Li Ziyu's statement of "a large patch of black blood seeping onto the white cloth."

Although it had rained last night, the rain hadn't been heavy enough to thoroughly wash away and dilute the blood in the soil.

Without a word, Li Zhenguo squatted down and took out a pair of gloves, several bamboo picks, and yellow paper labels written with "Arabic numerals" from his canvas bag. After waving away the flies, he first marked the spots where the flies gathered with paper labels, then began digging with a bamboo pick. In no time, he dug up some black soil, brought it to his nose to sniff, and revealed an "as expected" expression. Although Gao Chongjiu felt this was superfluous, since Li Zhenguo was "the Chiefs' man," he quickly took it and sniffed too: there was a bloody stench.

Li Zhenguo didn't stop there. He continued digging. Every few digs, he would sniff, put the soil-stained bamboo pick into a small oil-paper bag, write a label, and switch to a new bamboo pick.

Li Ziyu watched, finding it novel. He didn't even know what they were doing—if they wanted to dig up a corpse, they should use a shovel. What could they dig up with a bamboo pick? Though puzzled, he watched with interest. He watched as Li Zhenguo dug several inches deep, took out a ruler from his bag to measure, recorded a few strokes in a notebook, changed spots, and repeated the process. Finally, he muttered a few words to Gao Chongjiu and stood up.

Gao Chongjiu nodded at Li Ziyu and laughed, "Good lad, there really was a corpse! You two silly boys have hit the jackpot!"
