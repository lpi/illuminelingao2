# Chapter 1952 - Questions (Part One)

Therefore, when Feng Nuo submitted a memorandum through normal procedures, citing "outstanding performance in part-time work at the Electronic Equipment Workshop" and "potential for further study and advancement" as justification for officially transferring Li Jianai's personnel file from the Tiandihui to the Machinery Factory, the Political Security Bureau was naturally happy to go along with this convenient solution, moving Li Jianai out from under the noses of Dugu Qiuhun and Lu Xuan so these two wouldn't have to feel like something was stuck in their throats every day.

So Zhou Botao once again personally went to the Tiandihui to coordinate this matter and explain the situation. Given this face-saving way out, Dugu Qiuhun wasn't inclined to make things difficult for himself and no longer blocked the transfer. Besides, nearly a year had passed, and even if he blocked it this time, Li Jianai would be rotated to another region in two months anyway.

To be safe, the group also agreed to have Wu Fu personally visit Feng Nuo to explain Li Jianai's identity situation, to prevent any more missteps—ordinarily, according to regulations, this sort of thing could have been handled by having a subordinate deliver a note.

Fortunately, Feng Nuo's department was a classified unit with a relatively high security level and had dealt with the Political Security Bureau several times before. There were no further complications, and he readily agreed to provide convenience for Li Jianai's work. Additionally, they also managed to discuss the procurement of the punch card computer system, leaving both parties quite satisfied.

Feng Shan noticed a faint smile on her teacher's face—he was clearly in a good mood. After leaving Store Number 43, her own mind was in turmoil. She had wandered aimlessly around East Gate Market for a long time. It wasn't just her personal emotional matters; more than anything, it was about the thoughts and impressions she'd accumulated from all she'd seen and heard while at Feng Nuo's side over the years.

But these thoughts, given her status and position, were perhaps too "presumptuous"—even carrying a flavor of "ingratitude." Sometimes even just thinking about these issues filled her with guilt.

The recent romantic experience in particular had made her feelings even more chaotic. When she was with this junior student, he too had talked about his experiences and observations while studying at the Academy and the various doubts that had arisen from them.

She summoned her courage and asked, "Teacher, I... have a few questions I'd like to ask you."

Questions? Feng Shan often asked him questions—about mathematics, of course. Feng Nuo didn't notice that her manner was a bit different today. He nodded, indicating that Feng Shan should continue.

Feng Shan hesitated for a moment. She realized she didn't know where to begin. After thinking for a moment, she decided to start with a specific question.

"One of Jianai's senior sisters works at the General Construction Company. She's... a transmigrator's life secretary. Today she told us about something. There's a cadre at their company who, during a routine inspection by the Cheka not long ago, was found to have problems with bribery, corruption, and abuse of power. Apparently it was quite serious, with strong public indignation, and he'd been reported before. But because a transmigrator higher up protected him, it wasn't made public, and now he's back at work. The workers have reacted very strongly. Teacher, if this person is so bad, why would the transmigrators protect him?"

This was the first time Feng Shan had "questioned" the correctness of the transmigrators. She looked at Feng Nuo with slight nervousness.

Feng Nuo was taken aback—he hadn't expected her to ask this kind of question. He recalled that the recent "situation briefing" had mentioned that for naturalized citizen cadres with less serious problems, internal warning disciplinary action would be taken, with the focus still on the "cure the sickness, save the patient" approach. After all, cultivating cadres wasn't easy right now, and they needed to "protect" and "save" them. Sending someone to Fu Youdi was simple enough, but then all the effort and energy invested earlier would be wasted.

But this question was difficult to answer. He thought for a moment, then carefully replied, "Well, there are two possible reasons. First, people aren't gods—everyone makes mistakes, and the causes of mistakes are varied. It might be a momentary lapse, or old habits from the Pseudo-Ming that are hard to break. The Executive Committee must allow them to make mistakes. If the error isn't too serious, they should also be given a chance to reform. As they say, 'water too clear has no fish; people too scrutinizing have no followers.'"

"Mm... Second, currently all our undertakings are severely lacking in capable people. If this person has outstanding abilities, or there's temporarily no one to replace him, then even if he's committed relatively serious errors, we might temporarily tolerate and retain him, to avoid letting individual factors affect our overall construction plans. This is the view of sacrificing the parts to preserve the whole."

He had hesitated about whether to mention this second point, because it contained elements of pragmatism, and pragmatism was something that could be both good and bad. After careful consideration, he decided to say it—Feng Shan should already be mature enough to accept such a viewpoint, as evidenced by the fact that she could ask this question.

However, he left half a sentence unspoken: this person would probably be reporting to Fu Youdi's place very soon anyway. Now that he knew Li Jianai was a "hidden asset" of the Political Security Bureau, the spread of this information would likely be traced by the Bureau before long. Once they judged that this person's "negative influence" outweighed his "positive contribution," the Executive Committee would naturally cast him aside without hesitation.

"Teacher, if this person is a corrupt and fraudulent bad person, how could he possibly contribute to our construction enterprise?"

Feng Nuo's forehead began to bead with sweat.

"First of all, a bad person isn't necessarily an incapable person. If all bad people were incompetent, they wouldn't cause so much damage. Second, people are complex. This person may have damaged our enterprise through corruption, but he may also be supporting our enterprise through construction at the same time. His selfish desires may have led him to corruption, but that doesn't mean he lacks the intention to work loyally for the Executive Committee. So we must weigh the pros and cons."

"Finally—this isn't about that person specifically—but you should recognize that when the Executive Committee employs people, the primary consideration is usually whether they can competently perform their duties. If they cannot competently perform their duties, then regardless of their personal virtue, they should not be employed. If they can competently perform their duties, then even if they have some shortcomings and selfish motives that don't violate laws and regulations, they will still be employed. People completely without private thoughts or shortcomings are rare; if we refuse to use people's strengths merely because of their shortcomings, there won't be many usable people left."

—This was to prevent Feng Shan, who had received positive education at Fangshaodi since childhood, from falling into the trap of purely moralistic thinking.

"Teacher, do the transmigrators also have shortcomings?"

...Here it comes at last. "Everyone has shortcomings," "transmigrators are also people"—with Feng Shan's level of logic, she would naturally ask this syllogistic question.

Although he knew the transmigrators would eventually step down from their pedestals, that they would eventually be questioned by naturalized citizens and locals about their "glory and righteousness"—and that life secretaries, being closest to the transmigrators, experiencing their emotions and desires, seeing their strengths and weaknesses, would naturally be the first to have this myth shattered in their hearts—when actually facing such a question, Feng Nuo was still speechless for a long time.

...Feng Shan nervously watched her teacher's reaction, already prepared to immediately apologize if Feng Nuo became angry.

Actually, this question didn't need to be asked. If judged by the moral standards taught in national schools, the transmigrators certainly had shortcomings—quite a few, in fact. Even without school moral education, judging by simple conscience alone, it was hard to say the transmigrators were without flaws.

So she had already answered the question in her heart. She just wanted to hear her teacher's answer.

Perhaps, deep down, she still hoped her teacher could convincingly refute her answer the way he did with those mathematics problems—it was the Executive Committee that had rescued her from hell and brought her into heaven, and she hoped heaven was full of angels.

"Of course, we also have shortcomings." Feng Nuo answered with difficulty. As he said these words, he felt like a bystander, and his own voice sounded very dry.

A long silence. Feng Shan felt her heart pounding; Feng Nuo still hadn't come back to himself.

"Ah, I just meant... what I mean is, the transmigrators know everything, they work extremely hard all the time, and they've never been corrupt..." Although her teacher showed no sign of getting angry, Feng Shan felt she needed to explain, though she didn't know what exactly she was explaining.

Feng Nuo silently said to her in his mind: this is what they call "the emperor has no private affairs and accepts no bribes." The transmigrators' supracitizen status and rights were written into the "Common Program"—that is, the constitution—and guaranteed through the transmigrator state's various laws and administrative systems and entire power structure. Naturally there was no need for corruption or fraud. The Executive Committee didn't teach naturalized citizens "dragon-slaying arts," so of course you wouldn't be aware of this yet.

As for working desperately, putting in overtime—the reason the transmigrators now all appeared to "walk with wind, speak like bells, shake hands vigorously, and call everyone 'comrade'"—was the same: it was simply because "power is the best aphrodisiac." Of course, put another way, it was the inspiration and stimulation of "the great cause." Feng Nuo himself, having gone from living like a salted fish in previous years to his changed work enthusiasm this year, felt this particularly deeply.

"Mm... and I think you, Teacher, don't have any shortcomings." Feng Shan added somewhat embarrassedly.

Of course Feng Nuo wasn't without shortcomings, but in Feng Shan's view, her teacher truly didn't have noteworthy flaws like "greed," "corruption," "crudeness," or "inability to distinguish right from wrong." Even "lechery"—the most common trait among transmigrators, one that probably every naturalized citizen knew about—he didn't have.

Heh heh, Feng Nuo thought, the "Tale of Genji" hobby didn't count as a shortcoming? Of course, that kind of shortcoming was of a higher grade...

He couldn't help laughing at himself self-deprecatingly, shaking his head as he said, "How could I not have shortcomings..."

But he didn't continue this topic, and the atmosphere lightened somewhat.

"You said that when the Executive Committee employs people, the first consideration is actually a person's ability, and that some private thoughts and shortcomings won't affect their employment. But in moral education class at school, they always say we should give selflessly, sacrifice everything for the Executive Committee's cause, that the Executive Committee never fails a good person and never lets a bad person off. Why is that?"
