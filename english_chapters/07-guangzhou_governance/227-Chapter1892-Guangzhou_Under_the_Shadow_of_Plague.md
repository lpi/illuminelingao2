# Chapter 1892 - Guangzhou Under the Shadow of Plague

## Guangzhou Under the Shadow of Plague

If this case was confirmed, that peddler was probably doomed as well. Fu Wuben sighed silently to himself. If this patient had caught the disease just from exchanging a few words of conversation, then that fur merchant very likely also had pneumonic plague. And with so many days having passed, he might already have septicemia—perhaps even...

"Let's hope this suspected case can be ruled out as pneumonic plague." Everyone present silently prayed.

After a long while, Fu Wuben finally stammered: "Quick! Quick, report to Director Lin!"

The results came quickly. Lin Motian looked at the report on the first pneumonic plague case. Well, what had to come would come. Since he had accepted this hot potato, this was unavoidable.

Lin Motian immediately began issuing new quarantine and epidemic prevention regulations. Since the epidemic had begun to counterattack, the next step might soon be an outbreak. Moreover, the previous measures he had taken—rat extermination, strict fur trade quarantine—could no longer stop the droplet transmission route of plague. The source of infection would likely shift from mainly rats and fleas to mainly human-to-human transmission. He had been hesitating all along, reluctant to present this document that would be considered shocking by this timeline's standards. But now he had no choice—without deploying sufficiently tough measures, no one knew how the epidemic would develop next, or even whether Guangzhou would become a dead city!

According to the regulations Lin Motian had been implementing, a quarantine system had been gradually taking shape, but these measures were still far from sufficient. Before them, after all, was death's spokesperson—against whom humanity had struggled for millennia without success. One could imagine that a considerable number of the ordinary soldiers participating in frontline quarantine would not live to see the final victory. But this was no time for softheartedness. Lin Motian's next measures wouldn't just fail to protect these ordinary quarantine personnel—they would expose them to even greater danger.

The outbreak of pneumonic plague and the accelerating daily increase in infections had completely shut up certain Elders who had been making snide remarks. Support for his work was now unprecedented from all sides, and Wen Desi had even sent a telegram to all departments and Elders throughout the province, demanding they "provide every convenience."

Lin Motian began undertaking more detailed district divisions, preparing to implement martial law in districts where pneumonic plague cases had appeared. The street patrol system was changed to mandatory household inspections, and he requested more quarantine inspectors from Hong Kong. He required each quarantine inspector to cover every individual household during each patrol. Once a suspected case was discovered, the patient and close contacts were to be immediately forcibly isolated. Houses of infected persons would be burned at his discretion, with compensation provided. Citizens were gradually accepting the isolation policy, showing that the propaganda department's work was indeed important—the next step of tightening policies would still need the propaganda department's continued assistance. All traffic checkpoints would strengthen quarantine, with non-essential trade completely prohibited. The small portion that remained would have to go through strict quarantine and disinfection procedures. Vagrant shelters would be established to take in drifters and beggars, striving to eliminate their current status outside household registration. Bathhouses, inns, entertainment venues—even coffin shops and slaughterhouses—would all be sealed or strictly controlled...

The stricter new quarantine regulations had barely been published when all of Guangzhou erupted in uproar. Never mind local citizens being unable to accept them—even Mayor Liu's expression turned extremely ugly. As long as these measures were implemented, the fiscal pressure on Guangzhou city would explode to a degree he found unbearable. If executed for a few months, the municipal government would go bankrupt. Fortunately, Lin Motian had repeatedly emphasized in his reports to Lingao that this epidemic prevention work needed the full cooperation of the Elders' Council—Guangzhou alone could hardly pull through—which gave Liu Xiang considerable leverage when requesting funds from the central government.

Besides, everyone was well aware of the question: money or life? So despite their displeasure, they still had to fully cooperate with execution. If even they themselves were reluctant about the isolation policy, one could well imagine how much resistance there would be implementing it among the populace.

Lin Motian's group returned from inspecting the newly built disease victims' cemetery construction site. The cemetery was located at Yantang, at the foot of Baiyun Mountain, not far from the urban area. Cui Hantang had specifically gone to see it, rambling on about feng shui in the site selection and design. Neither Lin Motian nor Liu Xiang had any interest in listening to his pontifications—they only cared about how many people could be buried here.

The planned burial capacity was four thousand plots, plus wall niches and flower-bed burials, totaling capacity for about ten thousand urns of ashes. Lin Motian thought this number should be sufficient.

"If it's not enough, we're probably not escaping either."

The name "Disease Victims' Cemetery" was too morbid, so the cemetery adopted the name of the old charitable institution under the Guangzhou Prefecture office that had managed paupers' graves and collected roadside corpses—the Louze Garden. It was named Louze Garden Cemetery.

Workers were cutting terraces into the hillside and laying slope protection stones. Architect Ji Runzhi, urgently transferred from Lingao, was responsible for the project's design and construction.

Thinking that his first architectural project in Guangzhou was actually a cemetery, this designer who had dreamed of building countless "Thousand-Year Reich" buildings predictably had an ugly expression. Naturally he wasn't in a good mood toward Lin Motian and the others either. Despite Liu Xiang's repeated assurances that "the design should be bold, the materials refined, and no need to worry about funding," Ji Runzhi couldn't muster much enthusiasm.

The cemetery grounds included three small religious buildings: one Buddhist temple, one Taoist temple, and one Catholic church. The Taoists were sent by Cui Hantang; the monks were found locally from temples. As for the priests—when the Jesuit missionaries heard that "Black Death" had broken out in Guangzhou, they came of their own accord like flies drawn to filth. Though their medical skills were useless against plague, they were still determined to "save as many souls as possible" and had rushed to Guangzhou. Liu Xiang directly assigned these missionaries to the cemetery as caretakers, incidentally performing Mass at burials. This arrangement drew protests from the missionaries—because the deceased hadn't been baptized in life, holding requiem Mass at burial was meaningless.

Lin Motian had no interest in participating in such doctrinal disputes and returned early to his office.

Walking back to the office, due to pneumonic plague transmission, stricter quarantine and isolation measures were already being enforced. The streets, which had still had some human presence before, had lost their once bustling crowds—so desolate it sent chills down one's bones. Every household had doors shut tight. Garbage blew across the streets in the wind—a scene of utter desolation.

The once thriving marketplace had lost all signs of life. Though most shops were still open, there were hardly any customers inside. Owners and workers wore worried expressions—the market depression caused by the large-scale quarantine and isolation was beginning to show. Lin Motian knew that the Chamber of Commerce had gone to Liu Xiang a few days ago to petition for tax exemption for the next six months. The industries affected touched every aspect—from lofty foreign merchants earning fortunes daily, to humble small craftsmen and peddlers, everyone was having a hard time. The only exception was coffin shops—they had received a small windfall from large orders from epidemic prevention stations for thin coffins for cremation.

Switching to specialized cremation coffins was another of Lin Motian's improvements to reduce cremation resistance. Previously, the corpse collection team had used oilcloth body bags. These had to be custom-made from raw materials to finished products at the United Logistics uniform factory in Hong Kong. Not only were costs high, but they also gave people a feeling of cheapness.

Having a coffin was at least more dignified than being put in a bag—the latter, in many people's minds, was the same as being wrapped in reed mats: the after-death standard for the destitute class.

Switching to thin coffins made from various miscellaneous woods could not only be manufactured locally but was also much cheaper.

However, this bit of "prosperity" was utterly insignificant compared to the market depression. According to police system reports, many urban poor were beginning to have difficulty making a living and had to rely on relief to survive. Moreover, the middle and lower-middle classes were also experiencing varying degrees of hardship and urgently needed assistance. Now, relief grain had to be shipped from Hong Kong to Guangzhou every day.

Liu Xiang had said with a bitter smile at yesterday's municipal government work meeting: "The Elders' Council thought Guangzhou was a milk cow—turns out it's a dying cow on its last legs! Not only is there no milk, but we have to keep giving it blood transfusions."

"But as long as the milk cow stays alive, there'll be milk. If it dies, there's nothing left," Lin Motian said.

Guangzhou's currency reform had completely stalled—there was hardly any commercial circulation now. The silver lining was that the expected problems of currency shortage and unscrupulous merchants hoarding goods for profit hadn't materialized: the plague bacillus had destroyed all such possibilities.

The series of new policies promoted by the Guangzhou Municipal Government had also completely ground to a halt. All human and material resources had been transferred to epidemic prevention.

The work of fighting the plague was enormously complex—the Epidemic Prevention Battalion, investigation teams, quarantine camps, infectious disease hospitals, epidemic prevention stations, the crematorium, and now the cemetery... He had to oversee everything. Exhausted, he returned to the epidemic prevention command center of the Health Department. Before stepping into the buffer zone to remove his isolation cloak, he couldn't help frowning again: an envelope hung at the door—today's epidemic report had arrived. He wondered if today's numbers would improve his mood.

There was some good news: "Cremation policy implementation proceeding smoothly—all disease deaths and suspected disease deaths in the city have been cremated according to regulations... Propaganda front achieving significant results—the proportion of citizens accepting the Elders' Council's isolation and cremation policies is gradually increasing. Resistance to isolation, escapes during isolation, and secret burial or dumping of corpses have essentially disappeared. Street sentiment monitors in all districts deserve great credit... The plague isolation ward at the Infectious Disease Hospital has discovered 24 pneumonic plague cases. Scattered pneumonic plague cases have begun appearing in various districts, and the numbers are showing an upward trend..."

Lin Motian looked at the document with a gloomy expression. His greatest fear had come true: with the appearance of pneumonic plague, the incidence and morbidity rates that had been trending toward stable or even slight decline had shown a marked jump. The epidemic was rebounding.
