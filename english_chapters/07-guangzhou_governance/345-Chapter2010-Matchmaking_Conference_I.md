# Chapter 2010 - Matchmaking Conference (II)

Upon hearing the introduction, Wang Jun's initially indifferent expression instantly changed. He corrected himself: "So it's Mr. Song. A pleasure to meet you, a pleasure."

"You honor me." Song Yingsheng witnessed a scene that had played out countless times already. Regardless of the Senator's prior expression, upon hearing that sentence, they would break into a smile, then size him up repeatedly with curious eyes, usually praising Senator Du for "having a good eye." Afterwards, whatever they discussed, the hair-thief Senators would be extraordinarily polite, and many would inquire about news of his third brother.

What exactly had Third Brother done to benefit the hair-thieves, making them so obsessive? While secretly puzzled, Song Yingsheng was quite worried.

"Sit and rest for a bit. Another Senator is coming soon."

"Another Senator is coming?" Du Yibin was surprised. He'd thought his fussing about had made him a nuisance in Guangzhou.

"A Senator from Propaganda is coming." Wang Jun picked up his thermos cup and took a big gulp of tea. "Think about it—such good material, Propaganda has to report it fully, right?"

"True, why didn't I think of that..."

"Qin Ruiyu sent a messenger just now saying he'll attend in person. He's also preparing to take photos—in a few days it'll be in the papers, both Lingao and Sheep City! It'll also be in *Qiming Star*!"

While the two talked, Song Yingsheng sat silently alone, observing this "matchmaking auditorium."

Collective matchmaking wasn't exactly novel to Song Yingsheng. Serving as an official in Guangdong, he'd traveled somewhat and seen scenes of minority men and women in the Two Guangs gathering at markets, singing songs to matchmake. The Australians being overseas barbarians, presumably this practice was popular among them too.

Arriving at the scene, he realized the arrangement was completely different from his imagination. Tables were set with tea bowls and cups, and people were placing fruit platters filled with various snacks on the tables. *Are they opening a teahouse?* Song Yingsheng was quite puzzled. Looking up, he saw numerous colorful ropes strung crisscross across the beams like a spiderweb, hung with paper lanterns and various colorful rings and ornaments. Though simple, it was colorful and looked lively and festive.

Although the building was old and the tables and chairs were tattered secondhand goods cobbled together, everything had been cleaned thoroughly and arranged neatly. It was completely the "New Life" style. Having been in Guangzhou for a few days, Song Yingsheng had fully grasped the overwhelming propaganda of the "New Life Movement" in the city.

Song Yingsheng had a favorable impression of this "New Life Movement," feeling it had the flavor of "governing as in ancient times." Although the management was inexplicably trivial, the results were significant—perhaps less so in Enping, but in Guangzhou, there was a sense of "a changed world."

Today at the shelter, one could tell it was a converted ruined temple. In terms of architectural repair, the Australians actually hadn't spent too much manpower or material resources. Temporary patches were visible in many places. New buildings were humble huts of bamboo frames and reed mat walls, coated with yellow mud and topped with straw. Yet the grounds were swept clean, and items organized neatly. There was no sense of "making do" amidst dilapidation; instead, there was a vigorous air of flourishing growth.

"Master Song, your calligraphy is good. Come help out," Du Yibin said, bringing a stack of red square papers and the Four Treasures of the Study.

He didn't lack people who could write, but having said "watching is fine" today, he still wanted to "educate" him a bit.

Unfortunately, this middle-aged man was very stubborn. Du Yibin knew that in the original timeline, Song Yingsheng had committed suicide after the Southern Ming fell, so he didn't dare push too hard, only engaging in some "subtle influence."

Writing a few characters wasn't a big deal, and Song Yingsheng couldn't well refuse. In fact, this was an area where he could fully look down on the hair-thieves. From what he'd seen: from Senator Chiefs down to naturalized cadres, every single hair-thief wrote terrible characters.

"What should I write?" He picked up the ink stick, knowing it was the coarsest soot ink, and felt rather unhappy. As for the inkstone and brush, one glance showed they were crude goods used by accountants and the like.

"Just these few characters, one per square." Du Yibin said.

Song Yingsheng looked closely. The slip of paper read: "Guangzhou City First Collective Matchmaking Conference."

Leaving aside the quality of the calligraphy, this half-coherent phrasing made Song Yingsheng silently criticize it. However, the words contained nothing offensive. He immediately ground the ink, dipped the brush, and wrote them one by one on the red squares in a single breath. Du Yibin stood by repeatedly cheering, calling the writing "exquisite." This embarrassed him: his brushwork could by no means be called "exquisite" among scholars; at best it was competent.

Du Yibin was speaking from the heart—never mind brush calligraphy, they couldn't even write decent characters with fountain pens or pencils. Once the ink was slightly dry, he called a naturalized citizen to pin these large square characters onto the beams one by one.

While the squares were being pinned up, the men and women for the matchmaking arrived. The bachelors arrived first. In terms of age, the youngest was over thirty-five, generally over forty. For ordinary poor commoners, this age already showed signs of premature aging; some had stooped backs. But these men were veterans naturalized for over three years. Years of living and working under the Senate meant not only sufficient nutritional intake but also much more scientifically reasonable arrangements for rest and labor compared to local commoners. Not only did they not look old, but they appeared vigorous. Having had haircuts, shaves, and changed into new clothes, they were all glowing with health.

Because there were slightly too many people, the auditorium couldn't accommodate everyone matchmaking at once, so a three-session model was adopted. The first session was for men and women with lottery numbers 1 to 50. The second session was for 51 to 100. The third session was a "resurrection match" for those who hadn't found suitable partners in the first two sessions.

The venue had twenty tables and one hundred chairs. The rule was female students sat still while male naturalized workers rotated in order, conversing for five minutes. If dissatisfied, move to the next. After a full rotation, there would be free interaction time. A full circuit would take about two hours.

This model was already maturely implemented in Lingao and other places, though Wang Jun wondered if it might be too advanced for the students.

*Hope it goes smoothly,* Wang Jun thought.

Estimating, three sessions would take about a day, finishing before 5 PM. This way naturalized citizens living in the city could return before dark. Security outside the city was poor; curfew was enforced after nightfall, and no one except armed patrols was allowed on the roads.

"Come, come, everyone take your seats." Seeing the entering bachelors looking lost, Wang Jun called out with a tin megaphone. "You all sit on the left side of the tables—yes, leave the right side for the women!"

After the men were seated, the women arrived. Compared to the silent, sullen bachelors, the students were much livelier. They were veterans of the entertainment world; seeing men, naturally they wouldn't be as shy as ordinary village women. They looked around, whispering and discussing the men in low voices.

"Hey, hey, stop the chatter—hurry and sit according to your numbers." Wang Jun directed.

Once seated according to numbers, separated from the men by a table, the previously boisterous women suddenly became shy. Heads bowed, let alone discussing the men, even their eyes were cast down bashfully, only stealing glances at the men.

Wang Jun thought these students' demeanor changed too quickly. Seeing the first fifty pairs of men and women seated facing each other, and seeing Propaganda's Senator Qin arriving on the scene with staff, he signaled Du Yibin, then walked slowly to the center of the venue.

There were naturally no microphones here, but the matchmaking host holding a tin megaphone would be too comical and bad for photos. Wang Jun would just have to fully utilize his throat.

He came to the front of the tables, scanning the men and women present.

"Ahem..." Wang Jun cleared his throat: "Comrades, students! I am the host for this event, Wang Jun. I represent the Senate in hosting Guangzhou Special City's first collective matchmaking activity. Although this is the first time in Guangdong, we've held it many times in Hainan with significant results! Your respective leaders have already discussed the details with you, so I won't repeat them. This matchmaking conference we're holding embodies the Senate's care for activists. I know some may think: why does the Senate manage everything, even marriage? Thinking this way is wrong! As the saying goes, revolutionary work is no small matter! Many of you are no longer young, yet still single. The persecution of the old society gave you no opportunity, no conditions to marry—it was inhumane!" He paused deliberately. "Now you live in the new society. The organization specifically organized this matchmaking conference to let you start families and settle down. Solving personal problems allows you to better serve revolutionary work! The Senate not only reforms the old society but also initiates new forms of romance in the new society! This is the Senate's care for you! I hope that in this activity, both men and women can find a partner they like, build a new family, continue your own and Huaxia's bloodlines, serve the Senate and the people, and become fully qualified naturalized families!" Pausing here, warm applause rang out from the men's group. The women's side reacted quickly too, also applauding. This satisfied Wang Jun—they were student activists after all.

"Good! I'll announce the next segment. Each of you has a number tag on your clothes. This is your matchmaking number..." Wang Jun began explaining the rules. According to the rules, names wouldn't be used during the process; address and confirmation would be by number tag.
