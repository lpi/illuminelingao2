# Chapter 2068 - The "Heshengcheng" Paper Shop

"Come, come—maybe one day we'll really be able to spend money without carrying any cash around, haha!"

"What kind of autumn daydream is that..."

"Here, here—another cup of Gervas, it won't go to your head..."

"I don't want that sweet water! Come on, look at this fruit wine—the real stuff, authentic Australian goods straight from Lingao!"

Fawenniu had already drunk quite a lot of Gervas, and after mixing in the fruit wine, it wasn't long before he felt the effects. Seeing that it was getting dark and still thinking about matters at home, he excused himself and left the others behind.

Fawenniu's home was in the southern part of the city. Leaving the restaurant and feeling the river breeze on his face, his drowsy head cleared somewhat, though his legs remained unsteady, causing him to stagger as he walked. He stopped and started, and with great difficulty made it to the entrance of Papermaker's Street. One misstep sent him careening into a passing sedan chair—the collision so forceful that the two bearers stumbled and nearly overturned the sedan.

The accompanying servant seized Fawenniu by the collar and cursed, "Are you blind? How do you walk?" The two bearers rolled up their sleeves and made as if to confront him.

Fawenniu could tell at once that the sedan likely carried some "master." In the old days—even if he wasn't in the wrong—he would have had to bow and scrape and apologize profusely. But things were different now. Australian constables were everywhere, and if it came to blows and they were hauled off to the precinct station, no amount of status would save anyone. These days, the gentry and great households dared not make scenes on the streets. Besides, he was a "properly registered" "Opinion Guide" with an Australian pass—he was practically one of *their* people now. The wine emboldened him, and he stiffened his neck and shot back, "The road belongs to everyone—why didn't your sedan watch where it was going?"

The two servants grew incensed and made to "teach him a lesson," but a man's voice emerged from inside the sedan: "He's drunk. Don't quarrel with him—just go."

At the master's command, the servants reluctantly released Fawenniu, and with some resentment, lifted the sedan and departed. Fawenniu, smug with self-satisfaction, called after them, "This Guangzhou doesn't belong to you anymore..."

The man in the sedan did not hear this last remark. The chair moved briskly through the evening shadows, entering Papermaker's Street and soon arriving before a shop front.

The street was called "Papermaker's Street" because it had once been famous for its concentration of paper shops. But ever since the Australians had begun flooding the market with various types of "Lingao paper," traditional paper had suffered severe setbacks. Nine out of ten of the old shops had disappeared; those that remained either worked as distributors for Australian paper or specialized in certain niche products. The street had grown quiet and desolate.

The shop before which the sedan halted had a modest facade, its signboard also reading "Paper Shop." Evening had fallen, and the clerks were busy putting up the shutters and taking down the shop banners. Seeing the sedan approach, they stood respectfully at attention. The manager hurried out from inside to greet them: "Master..."

The man in the sedan said nothing, only nodded. The sedan was carried directly through a large gate beside the shop.

The chair settled in the courtyard. *Hao the Second* stepped out—a man in his early forties, handsome and refined. Because he was the second son, everyone called him "Hao Er" or "Second Master Hao." On the Guangzhou industrial and commercial tax registration rolls, Hao Er was listed as the owner of the "Heshengcheng" Paper Shop.

He did not exchange pleasantries with the manager or clerks, but went straight into the shop's rear courtyard, attended only by his personal servants.

The rear courtyard was his residence. Here, however, there was no wife or family—Hao Er's household, it was said, lived at their country estate. The only one present was a "chamber maid" kept for "daily use."

Seeing him enter, the chamber maid hurried out to greet him, dropping a curtsy: "Master."

"Light the lamps," Hao Er ordered. "And have a meal prepared. Bring it to the study. After that, you may eat and rest as you please—there is no need to attend me here."

He came to this place seven or eight times a month, and each time it was the same routine. The chamber maid thought nothing of it and went off to comply.

After giving these instructions, Hao Er and his two personal servants entered the side courtyard where the study was located. From this moment on, except for the chamber maid who would deliver the meal shortly, no one else could enter this courtyard.

One of the servants went ahead into the study and lit the "Australian oil lamp." Instantly, the dark room blazed with light.

"Too bright. Turn it down," Hao Er ordered. "Hao Ping, you stay and keep watch here." With that, he led the other servant toward the back of the study.

Behind the study lay a small courtyard, dotted with artificial rockeries and trees. One rockery featured a grotto entrance, and inside, the space was unexpectedly elegant: stone-lined walls all around, a stone table in the center, four stone stools, and various refined ornaments. Hao Er nodded. Hao An, the lamp-bearing servant, put down his lantern and moved one of the stone stools aside. Beneath it was revealed an iron ring.

Hao An grasped the ring and pulled. A stone slab rose—revealing a passageway beneath. A damp, cold draft rushed up. In the faint light of the lantern, stone steps could be glimpsed leading downward.

Master and servant descended quietly. After a dozen or so steps, they reached the bottom and continued forward. Before long, the sound of flowing water became audible, and the sight of an underground channel emerged—a narrow boat moored at a stone landing.

This was a branch of the Six Meridian Canals. At this moment, Hao Er and his servant stood beneath Papermaker's Street itself—an ancient conduit dating to the Song dynasty. Apart from the now-deceased Wang Daniao, no one in Guangzhou knew this underground passage still existed.

Hao An poled the boat with a bamboo staff. The small craft glided slowly through the murky water. In the pitch-black channel, only the lantern hung at the bow provided illumination.

Its dim glow revealed the grimy, stained walls of the conduit—the accumulation of centuries. Occasionally, tree roots and ant burrows could be seen. The boat drifted silently through the foul water.

The channel had once, several hundred years ago, been a natural river navigable by boats—an inland waterway through the city. Over the ages, as it became clogged with refuse and sewage, it had been roofed over to become a covered sewer. In the early days, teams had regularly dredged it; later, as years passed and attention waned, decades of neglect had allowed garbage to pile up like mountains. Sometimes the boat could barely thread its way between heaps of refuse and excrement protruding above the water; sometimes it ran aground entirely on mounds of muck and filth, requiring vigorous poling to break free.

Swarms of rats scurried among the garbage and sewage, foraging for scraps. Decomposed animal carcasses—gnawed and rotted beyond recognition—lay everywhere. Occasionally, human remains could be spotted as well: some had drowned in the open canals and drifted in; most had met violent ends and been dumped here.

The stench and filth were beyond description. Both men wore masks padded with medicinal herbs to ward off miasma, yet even so, the air left them gasping and short of breath. Were it not for the occasional shafts of light and fresh air filtering in from the drain grates above, they might well have suffocated.

The boat pulled up beside a stone stair. Hao An raised his lantern and led the way, looking back now and then. Hao Er followed, hands clasped behind his back. After several turns, they reached a dead end—an age-blackened wooden door.

Hao An tapped a few times. A small window in the door slid open abruptly.

Hao An lifted his lantern to his face, letting the person inside see him clearly. Moments later, the sounds of bolts and locks being drawn back could be heard. The door opened.

Behind it loomed a row of cabinets, their backs facing outward. They pushed the cabinets aside and stepped into what appeared to be a storeroom, its shelves laden with bound books and mounted paintings. The wooden staircase creaked beneath their feet as they climbed; at the top, Hao An lifted a trapdoor. They emerged into a warehouse of sorts, its racks piled high with printed books and framed artwork.

"Master, the coast is clear," Hao An said softly, peering out through a crack in the door.

Hao Er nodded. He pushed the warehouse door open.

They stood in an ordinary courtyard. Several large trees, decades old, cast the yard in perpetual shade, and at night it was utterly dark. To the east lay a row of workshops for processing paper pulp. Opposite stood racks for drying still-wet paper. To the south was a street-facing shop—a framing and mounting business that also dealt in the works of notable calligraphers and painters.

To the north was a row of stone-walled buildings where the managers and master craftsmen lived. Master and servant headed straight for the main hall, then turned into an eastern side room.

Hao An pushed aside a decrepit cabinet, revealing a wooden door fitted with an iron ring. He pulled the ring, and the door swung open.
