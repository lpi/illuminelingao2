# Chapter 1731: Roll Call

Dong Mingdang lowered her head and said, "Yes, thank you, Your Excellency. Only, I ask Your Excellency to issue a document permitting this servant and my mother to live in Guangzhou."

Liu Xiang said, "The Senate originally had a policy for the families of Ming officials: those willing to return home will be issued travel expenses, and those unwilling to return home can find their own way. It is acceptable if you wish to stay in Guangzhou. After the review is over, you can go wherever you wish."

"Many thanks for Your Excellency's grace." Dong Mingdang said, "It is just that this servant and my mother are now orphans and widows, with neither livelihood nor anyone to look after us. I beg Your Excellency for extra grace to return a few servants and the private property of this servant and my mother."

"If they are willing to follow you, we will not make things difficult. Each person is free to stay or leave. As for your mother and daughter's private savings, they need to be audited. In principle, as long as they do not exceed the limit, they can all be returned." Liu Xiang said.

Dong Mingdang knelt down and kowtowed: "Many thanks for Your Excellency's grace!"

When Guo Xi'er came out of the office and saw Dong Mingdang's still calm expression, she couldn't help complaining: "You really got me in trouble today!"

Dong Mingdang took Guo Xi'er's arm and smiled: "It was all Mingdang's rashness. I troubled Elder Sister this time." Saying this, she stuffed a handkerchief bundle into Guo Xi'er's hand. She whispered:

"Thanks to Elder Sister's help this time, Mingdang will never forget it until death. A small trinket, just a token of respect."

Guo Xi'er acted as if scalded by fire, hurriedly pushing it back: "No, no, don't harm me."

Dong Mingdang thought she felt it was too light in hand and thought it was something worthless, so she deliberately lifted a corner of the handkerchief. Inside was a gold step-shake with an emerald begonia flower pendant—worth at least two or three hundred taels of silver.

Unexpectedly, Guo Xi'er still firmly refused to accept it. Dong Mingdang, afraid that too much pushing back and forth would attract attention, had to take it back and said: "Elder Sister is so polite, Mingdang really feels uneasy..."

"Don't be polite." Although Guo Xi'er was not born into a rich family, she could still see the luxury and exquisiteness of the jewelry. Although she was tempted, she dared not covert it. Thinking again of her pitiful background, she felt great sympathy, "My hometown was originally in Shandong too, the same as your mother's. I should always help a little." She sighed, "I didn't expect your life experience to be so miserable. You mother and daughter don't even have a man to support the house now; days in the future will probably not be easy. Keep it to live on."

"I will still need to ask Elder Sister to look after us in the future." Dong Mingdang curtsied again before leaving.

Dong Mingdang returned to her room and roughly told her mother about the meeting with Liu Xiang. She added: "Now Lord Liu has allowed us to take away a few servants. Daughter has been thinking, we mother and daughter only have one personal attendant and one maid. Even if we take them both, four women still can't support a household..."

Concubine Jiang nodded silently. She was not old, only in her early thirties, and born with graceful charm, actually a few degrees more beautiful than her daughter. However, Concubine Jiang was not favored in the Dong family. First, she had no son; second, Concubine Jiang was dull and lacked interest. Master Dong didn't come to her room a few times all year round.

Since she wasn't favored, her treatment was naturally a grade lower than others. Other female family members had one personal attendant and two maids; Concubine Jiang only had one maid.

Although the personal attendant and maid could be taken away, there was no man in the family after all. Women living alone would inevitably attract butterflies and bees. For a widow, if there was no husband's family or natal family to look after her, being harassed and molested would be common. There were even people who specialized in kidnapping and snatching widows to sell them.

Dong Mingdang pondered, "I see that Dong Xiang, who originally served in the Master's study, is a good person. He is clever and, rarely, dutiful. He has never been married. I see Lan'er is also twenty; why not match her to him? Let the couple support the household externally, and we mother and daughter will preside internally. Neither of them is a local, and in these chaotic times of war, they won't have the thought of returning home."

Concubine Jiang said: "Dang'er, this is appropriate. Only, if we stay in Guangzhou, what about our livelihood in the future?" Her brows were knitted and she was full of worry as she spoke. Master Dong's hometown naturally couldn't be visited. Concubine Jiang's natal family relatives hadn't been in touch for many years. With natural and man-made disasters continuing in the north all these years, it was unknown if they were still alive. Concubine Jiang wasn't a "Red Concubine" in the Dong family, and had no extra income besides her monthly allowance. She had a little savings, jewelry, and antiques in hand, but sitting and eating the mountain hollow was not a long-term plan.

Dong Mingdang was confident and said: "Concubine Mother, Guangzhou is a prosperous place with silver everywhere, as long as you are willing to put in the effort to pick it up. In Daughter's view, the Australians act with great method and will surely achieve greatness in the future. Following behind them, we will have plenty of opportunities. Please rest assured about our livelihood in the future; Daughter has her own ways."

Concubine Jiang was a person with no opinions of her own. Seeing her daughter speak logically and unable to think of other ways herself, she agreed.

Early the next morning, Dong Mingdang packed her luggage and got up to go to Guangxiao Temple. She had delayed for a few days on pretext, and the other family members and servants of the yamen were already gone. The Planning Institute Search Team, because Prefect Dong's hidden silver had already been recovered, only left a few people to check and register worthless rough goods. The Dong mother and daughter didn't have many things, and with Guo Xi'er coming over to look after them, the inspection was perfunctory. Dong Mingdang tried her best to humor Guo Xi'er. Knowing she wouldn't accept expensive gifts, she presented her with a Sichuan fan of her own. Guo Xi'er accepted it.

Liu Xiang naturally didn't have the energy to pay attention to the friendship between his female secretary and Dong Mingdang. He had too many things to do. At this moment, he was receiving the clerks and runners of the Three Classes and Six Departments of Guangzhou Prefecture in the main hall. Today was their first day to "answer roll call" at the new Guangzhou Municipal Government.

For the takeover of Guangzhou City, a basic principle set by the Senate was to "temporarily preserve the old state machinery." The Senate had already established a clean and relatively efficient administrative machine on Hainan Island and had trained a large number of cadres. But these cadres were far from enough for use in a big city like Guangzhou. Liu Xiang's first step was to ensure that the clerk and runner teams of the one prefecture and two counties could work stably, ensuring the stability of Guangzhou's urban order and basic functions. Clerks and runners were at the bottom of society, yet they were responsible for most administrative affairs in ancient cities. Their familiarity with the city was far above that of ordinary people. Although they had always been extremely harmful, Liu Xiang couldn't sweep them out cleanly, but had to utilize them.

For this reason, he and Lin Baiguang had roughly set a basic principle for dealing with the clerk team in several meetings before entering the city: "Strike at the typical examples, educate and retain the majority." The retained personnel would be treated with "position without power, fully utilized," and then the "non-active elements" among the retained personnel would be eliminated gradually over three to five years. "Active elements" would be converted into formal naturalized citizen cadres.

Since the Tang and Song Dynasties, the clerk class had been known for being "treacherous and evil" and "cunning clerks." Regardless of whether an official was clean or corrupt, as long as he opposed the clerks, the official couldn't serve peacefully, let alone achieve political achievements.

Although Lin Baiguang was a supporter of the "temporarily preserve the old state machinery" policy, he was full of wariness towards this group. Although the "old system," the clerks' greatest magic weapon for coercing officials, no longer existed, and the new system didn't need their "precedents" and "old regulations," their familiarity with the laws of officialdom operations still gave them the ability to do evil. The new cadres trained by the Senate, and even the Senators themselves, could inevitably fall into their traps if they were slightly careless.

"If things are done badly, they can be corrected, but once popular support is lost, it's hard to retrieve," Lin Baiguang reminded Liu Xiang. "You must pay special attention not to be used by them—doing bad things with good intentions, history is full of such examples. In the end, the ones being scolded will be the Senate and you!"

Liu Xiang wanted to fully utilize their functions, but couldn't let them trap him.

"I have considered this," Liu Xiang said. "The first thing is to establish authority. As the saying goes, a new official applies three fires. I think the first fire should burn this prefectural yamen. I looked at the black materials you gave me; there are many. I think we should start with 'eliminating the chief evils.' Pick a few from the Three Classes and Six Departments who usually committed crimes and aroused great public anger, and hang them on lampposts first. The people below will naturally understand..."

"Don't underestimate them. The harm of clerks has lasted for a thousand years from the Tang and Song to the Republic of China. During this period, whether it was incorruptible officials or wise monarchs, they were helpless against them. I investigated; many clerk families have passed down the trade for several generations, some even starting from the Song Dynasty. It's a family-inherited craft. Not only must you be careful, but you must also be meticulous."

At this moment, Liu Xiang sat in the office with his eyes closed to rest. On the desk were case files—all black materials. Relying on these black materials, he was going to start a killing spree today.

Although this contradicted the "rule of law" concept advocated by the Senate. Fortunately, he was now the Director of the Guangzhou Military Control Commission. According to the backdoor opened by the Law Society, "military control" meant "martial law." As the Director, he also concurrently served as the Grand Judge of the Guangzhou Military Court, which was almost "speaking the law."

A doorkeeper on duty ran over panting, covered in sweat, and reported: "Your Excellency! It's already nine o'clock. Shall we ascend the hall?"

"Ascend!" Liu Xiang checked his watch, stood up abruptly, and ordered: "Tell the gatekeepers to fire the cannon! Guard personnel to posts fully armed!" He was very careful, checking his hair and the new navy blue Sun Yat-sen suit in the mirror—the tailors of the General Office could finally make decent Sun Yat-sen suits now.

Smoothing out the wrinkles, he then went out, walking slowly to the rear side of the main hall. Guo Xi'er and two armed guards followed closely. The doorkeeper had already arrived a step earlier, standing at the side door bowing and waiting.

The main hall was already solemn and murderous, full of people. Along the public desk, twenty-four National Army soldiers and twenty-four National Army Japanese Squad soldiers lined up in two columns extending to the door of the second hall. The National Army soldiers all grounded the butts of rifles with gleaming bayonets; the Japanese Squad wore bright red surcoats with Iron Fist crests, dual swords at their waists, standing erect without blinking.

More than ten scribes in neat robes and boots stood on the west side of the hall pillars. On the east side, the foremen of the Three Classes and the runners stood in distinct clothes awaiting orders. A chair was set to the left of the public desk, where Wei Bifu, Counselor of the Guangzhou Municipal Government, was seated. On the right was Lü Yizhong, the newly minted Secretary of the External Liaison Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Government.

Seeing such a formation, the clerks and runners felt uneasy. Since ancient times, new officials taking office invariably had to set fires, let alone during a change of dynasty! How would this Australian Lord Liu set the fire? Some knew their sins were great and felt very uneasy, but this ancestral rice bowl couldn't be lost—this was not only a livelihood for eating and getting rich, but also the key to saving lives: at the beginning of the new dynasty, if they couldn't integrate into the system in time and lost their protective umbrella, the new and old hatreds accumulated outside would erupt together, and their families would be ruined and dead in an instant!

The main hall and the courtyard were black with people standing, yet the surroundings were surprisingly quiet. Suddenly, the sound of a curtain lifting was heard, knowing that Chief Liu was coming out. Then, "Bam—Bam—Bam!" three cannon shots were heard. The doorkeeper shouted at the top of his voice:

"By the order of the Great Song Senate, Guangzhou Prefect Liu Xiang ascends the hall—"

He came up with this title himself after asking Guo Xi'er. With this shout, the clerks and runners, all trained in this kung fu, shouted "Ooo—" in unison to display hall prestige. Like marionettes, they lifted their feet and took a step back in unison. Listening to Liu Xiang's footsteps clattering from the east rear side door, he went straight up to the seat and stood at the desk.

"Peace to Your Excellency!"

Hundreds of people inside and outside the court knelt down in unison. The sound shook the main hall, making it buzz.

"Everyone please rise." Liu Xiang had a poker face with no expression. Even so, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Wei Bifu and Lü Yizhong cupped their hands upwards and sat down with hands on knees. The rest stood solemnly with hands at sides, occasionally stealing glances at the public seat. Liu Xiang also sat down.

Liu Xiang looked at the black crowd standing from below the main hall desk all the way to outside the main gate, feeling a bit puzzled. According to the data provided by the City Operation Department and the roster taken from the Shelf Archive, the number of people in this prefectural yamen was more than that of the county yamen, but the "authorized clerks" were less than a hundred. Adding the runners with wages, there were only more than three hundred people.

Although he knew from the materials that every county and prefectural yamen had many "temporary workers" who were not on the payroll and didn't receive wages, there shouldn't be so many people!

He frowned and said: "Roll call!"

The roll call was fast. There were more than three hundred people in total. After the roll call, twenty-five people were absent. Eight of them had taken long leave, and only seventeen were absent without reason.

"Expel those absent!" Liu Xiang ordered. Seeing that many people still hadn't been called, he turned his face to ask Wei Bifu: "There are still many people whose names haven't been called. This..."

"They are all unregistered Public Service workers," Wei Bifu said. "Those on the register get three taels and six mace of wage silver annually. Those not on the register only serve and don't take money."

Liu Xiang nodded. Three taels and six mace of wage silver annually—this salary treatment was low enough. As for the many runners who served without taking money, it went without saying what they lived on.

The work of runners was essentially a kind of unpaid labor. For the designer of this system, it was not inappropriate not to pay runners or pay only symbolic wages, because this was originally a kind of "public service." This crude system lasted for more than a thousand years, and no court recognized the impropriety in it. Officials complained about "clerks being slippery as oil," but never thought about trying to change it at the source.

Liu Xiang asked again: "How many unregistered people are there?"

"This—" Wei Bifu said with difficulty, "This humble official is not clear either. Probably about fifteen or sixteen hundred people."
