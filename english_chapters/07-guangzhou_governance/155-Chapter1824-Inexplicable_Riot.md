# Chapter 1824 - Inexplicable Riot

"There may be more than one corpse." Gao Chongjiu said. "Damn it—the moment I walked in, I knew something was off about the smell here! A faint stench underneath! No wonder they're drying stinking fish and rotting shrimp outside!"

Li Ziyu heard there were more bodies. He was about to speak when suddenly a commotion erupted outside. Vague shouts and clamor approached. One of the "brothers" ran over, looking tense: "Ninth Master, there's trouble outside! They're saying there are corpse-harvesters in here. The crowd wants to break in and beat the criminals to death..."

Such things weren't uncommon in this era. Criminals whose crimes were notorious and who aroused extreme public outrage were often "beaten to death" by the populace due to "righteous public fury"—during interrogation or on their way to the yamen.

But Gao Chongjiu knew this was bad. From when they'd entered to investigate until now, barely half an hour had passed—by Australian reckoning, not even a full hour. The Sword-Drawing Squad didn't speak the language and couldn't have leaked case information. As for the brothers he'd brought, they all understood the rules. They would never speak carelessly to outsiders.

The only possibility was that Gao Tianshi's people had stirred this up—only he knew what ghosts were hidden in this Mao Family Inn.

*He's desperate to silence witnesses!* Gao Chongjiu thought. This "sworn brother" was not only implicated—he was deeply involved.

Thinking this, he hurried to say: "Everyone get the prisoners into the front office!"

The front office was not only the largest room but also the sturdiest. It could buy some time. The National Army at Zhenhai Gate would certainly come to suppress the riot—Gao Chongjiu knew this wasn't ordinary "righteous public fury" but something stirred up deliberately. There must be dangerous elements mixed in, ready to strike in the chaos.

He called two brothers over: "Watch the one surnamed Fu inside. Don't let him escape, die, or kill himself!"

Though the Sword-Drawing Squad's squad leader didn't understand the Cantonese outside, from the clamor and the changing expressions of Gao Chongjiu and the others, he knew something was wrong. Without waiting for Li Ziyu's order, he barked a command in Japanese. The soldiers drew their bayonets and fixed them, forming a semicircular formation between the main gate and the front office. Bayonets pointed outward, percussion caps cocked.

Li Ziyu could speak halting Mandarin. He hurried over to tell the squad leader that rioters outside were trying to break in and kill witnesses. He needed them to protect the prisoners and secure the scene.

Li Ziyu's Mandarin and the Japanese soldiers' level were about equally bad. The two gestured and pantomimed for quite a while before they understood each other.

"...You understand?"

"I understand!" The squad leader nodded.

"Don't kill too many people..." Sweat beaded Li Ziyu's forehead. "They're... all masses who don't know the truth... meaning... they don't understand what's going on..."

Gao Chongjiu said: "Ah Yu, stop waving your hands around. If fighting really breaks out, there'll be corpses everywhere. Tell him to follow your commands—whoever you tell him to hit, he hits. No shooting without permission!"

Before he finished speaking, dozens of people had already surged through the main gate. They looked like local commoners, all in ragged clothes, holding "weapons" ranging from firewood sticks and carrying poles to boat oars and bamboo poles. They swarmed in with aggressive shouts.

Gao Chongjiu saw most were ordinary people who'd been stirred up. He groaned inwardly. Corpse-harvesting aroused extreme public fury. Such an intense reaction from the populace was entirely normal. In the past, the authorities wouldn't interfere with such things. So the people felt they were "eliminating evil for the community" and had nothing to fear. But now the situation was different—he wasn't motivated by thoughts of "merit" for cracking a big case. The key was that the Australians never muddled through—they demanded clarity on everything. If the main culprit really got beaten to death, there'd be no good outcome for himself.

With just these ten Japanese soldiers plus the few brothers he'd brought, there was no way to stop this many people. The ten Japanese soldiers wouldn't hesitate to kill, but killing innocent commoners was indefensible both morally and practically—and would make the Australians lose face.

While pondering countermeasures, suddenly another wall began to shake. Voices screamed from outside: "There are kidnappers in here!" "Storm in and butcher them!" "Kill the kidnappers!"...

The inn's perimeter wall was just bamboo fencing plastered with mud. How could it withstand such assault? In moments, a section collapsed with a crash, and many commoners instantly poured through.

Seeing the Sword-Drawing Squad waiting in formation, the crowd hesitated briefly. In that moment, another voice called out: "These are Australian officials—they kill bad people! Don't be afraid, everyone!"

Gao Chongjiu shouted at the top of his lungs: "Fellow citizens! The kidnappers have been captured! Please don't take the law into your own hands. We will escort them to the yamen for official trial, then execution by slicing..."

"The officers want to let them go!" "Beat them to death and be done with it!" "The officers took bribes from the criminals!" "They're all in it together!"...

Vague voices echoed from the crowd, fanning the already boiling public rage to a roaring blaze. More and more people surged in. Aggressive, menacing. Li Ziyu felt his body trembling uncontrollably.

Seeing the situation turning dangerous, the squad leader barked an order. The soldiers released their hammers, shouldered their muskets, and readied to fire.

Li Ziyu knew if this volley went off, seven or eight would surely fall. Trapped between advancing and retreating, sweat poured from his forehead. The crowd pressed forward. The squad leader kept glancing at him sideways. In his dilemma, Gao Chongjiu said: "Have them fire one blank volley. After firing, we retreat into the building and hold out—Zhenhai Gate is close. Once shots ring out, reinforcements will definitely come!"

Li Ziyu nodded repeatedly. He hurried to gesture again with the squad leader. The squad leader muttered something to his soldiers. They raised their muskets together and fired a volley over the heads of the mob.

The muffled gunfire echoed through the air. Bullets shrieked over people's heads. The courtyard was instantly shrouded in smoke. The crowd that had charged in let out terrified screams, stumbling and shoving each other as they fled toward what they thought was the gate. The wave that had seemed unstoppable moments before instantly shattered into countless panicked individuals. They crashed into each other, screaming, scattering in all directions.

Though Gao Chongjiu's expression remained unchanged, the volley's effect still left him shaken—not just the almost overwhelming visual and auditory impact, but the deterrent effect on the crowd's will. In the old days, once a riot broke out, government officers absolutely wouldn't dare confront the mob head-on. Neither whips nor sabers were any use against a crowd seeing red.

Even amid the chaos and clamor, he could still hear the Japanese officer's calm if awkwardly-accented Mandarin: "Clear chambers!" "Load!"...

The smoke gradually dispersed. The crowd that had nearly filled half the courtyard had vanished entirely. Only a dozen or so unlucky souls who'd been knocked down and trampled in the chaos remained, groaning. The ground was littered with discarded carrying poles, firewood sticks, wooden clubs, and other "weapons," plus many tattered straw sandals.

Li Ziyu, still in shock, felt his legs trembling. His hands were so weak he could barely grip his baton. If not for the lanyard on his arm, he probably would have dropped it long ago. Looking at Gao Chongjiu, his face was also quite grim. But those ten Japanese soldiers, though their expressions were grave, remained calm and composed. Muskets held at the ready, already reloaded, waiting in formation.

The clamor that had filled the street outside suddenly vanished completely. The sound of river currents washing against the bank became instantly clear and distinct. Li Ziyu's nerves were stretched to the breaking point. Suddenly, the street erupted with the shrill sound of police whistles. He felt his whole body go limp, nearly collapsing to the ground.

Wu Xiang studied Li Ziyu with mixed feelings. He couldn't help wondering if there existed some people naturally born to be police officers. He remembered when he was learning investigation from Mu Min, his teacher had told some interesting stories of reasoning and detection. The one that left the deepest impression was about a detective surnamed Ke—wherever he went, murders occurred, and he brought the killers to justice every time.

This unassuming patrol officer had been on the job barely a few months. He'd already risen from beat cop to the municipal bureau's Public Security Section. Now, tracking a human trafficking case, he'd stumbled into another major case—his luck was simply outrageous.

A corpse-harvesting case was a major serious case even under the Ming. That someone had incited the public to attack the prisoners showed clear intent to silence witnesses—meaning the case ran deep. Combined with the headless corpse case Li Ziyu had initially discovered—still unsolved, shadowy figures lurking behind it...

From the clues already found, this gang wasn't just doing simple kidnapping and harvesting. Wu Xiang had learned during training, and heard from Wang Zhaomin and other old hands, that harvesting cases often involved elements of sorcery and black magic.

He watched the detectives searching through the dilapidated riverside inn. A groundless notion suddenly flashed through his mind: *Could there be some connection here?*

The scene had been cordoned off by National Army troops who'd arrived at the sound of gunfire. Police hastily transferred from the city were searching the premises. Gao Chongjiu had said the criminals had set up such an elaborate operation on the riverbank—it couldn't be just for the few victims found so far. There were likely more victims' remains undiscovered.

"Just the harvesting gourds alone—they prepared no fewer than twenty. Seven or eight of them have amber inside. One gourd, one soul. At least seven or eight people died here. And there are over a dozen empty ones—they were planning to continue..." Gao Chongjiu said from experience.

Wu Xiang felt a chill run through his body—an indescribable cold, deathly aura. More terrifying than when he'd watched bandits publicly kill dozens of villagers back in the Eighteen Villages as a child.

"Reporting, Section Chief!" A police officer came running up, out of breath. "We've found something that appears to be human remains." His face was full of disgust as he spoke. Clearly, the scene wouldn't be pleasant.

Wu Xiang nodded: "Let's go have a look."
