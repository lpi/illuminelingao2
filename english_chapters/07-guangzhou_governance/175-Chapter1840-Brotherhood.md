# Chapter 1840 - Brotherhood

Zeng Juan gave Zhang Yu the cold shoulder, but he didn't get annoyed. He first poured two cups of herbal tea from the big clay pot, tasted it—it was the unsweetened kind—nodded slightly, placed one cup in front of himself and one by Zeng Juan's right hand. Then he gently opened the paper package, revealing slices of goose-yellow, tender, and fragrant tea food. For a moment, the fragrance overflowed, making Zeng Juan look sideways repeatedly, his tongue rolling and clicking in his mouth, not knowing what he was mumbling anymore.

"What is this?" Still unable to resist the seduction, Zeng Juan asked while reaching out to take a piece. Sniffing it and confirming it was the aroma of food, he was about to stuff it into his mouth.

"This is Australian tea food, called 'cookies' (quqi). The recipe was taken from the Australians, just tried out."

"Mmm..." Zeng Juan's hand couldn't stop.

"It's just that this thing is precious. Not only does it need fine white flour sifted, but also eggs, white sugar, and some butter—this is Mongol goods, where to find it in Guangzhou? Had to use lard—the Chief said we can consider using water buffalo milk to make butter later—even so, it cost a lot of capital. The family only tried making ten catties. I brought this over to let a few tea houses test the water. If it sells well, my family will have one more tea food to sell in the future."

"Mmm mmm mmm, delicious." hearing "high cost," Zeng Juan didn't mind and continued grabbing non-stop. When saying delicious, he even sprayed out some crumbs, distressed terribly. He rolled them to the edge of the table with his hand into his palm, swallowed what was in his mouth with a mouthful of herbal tea first, then raised his hand and clapped the crumbs into his mouth.

"How is it, not bad, right!"

"Mmm mmm mmm, really delicious..." Before the sound of "eating" was finished, with a crunch, another cookie entered his mouth.

"En, that's good. This package for you was made by my sister Ting'er personally..." Zhang Yu said deliberately. Sure enough, Zeng Juan choked, beating his chest and pouring water. Blushing, Zeng Juan said: "Ayu, Sister Ting is at your house?"

"Yes, now the business is big and employs many people. The family is short of hands. My aunt came over to talk to my mother, so she came to my house to work—"

Zeng Juan didn't know what mental theater he fell into, looking like a peach blossom and spacing out for a good while before suddenly recovering. Changing to a serious face, he wondered: "That's not right! According to Uncle's temper, if your family got the Australian secret recipe, how could he let Sister Ting help? Doesn't your family claim to pass to daughters-in-law but not daughters?"

"Hehe, what's rare about this recipe." Zhang Yu laughed, "It's all written in the books printed by the Australians. It's just that ordinary families can't find the materials, nor do they have ovens to bake."

"Such secret recipes are just printed in books for everyone to see casually?" Zeng Juan was a bit surprised this time.

"Yes, the Australians actually don't care about such insignificant skills." Zhang Yu's words were full of the envy that a tycoon dropping a leg hair could crush people to death, "However, baking takes quite some effort. It requires a closed oven wihout open fire, and fire control must be mastered—this is the hardest part. The Australians have 'thermometers.' No matter what material is used for burning, how many degrees and how many minutes, if timed well, it succeeds every time. It's difficult in our shop. Although there are ready-made closed ovens, my father baked three or four times before fumbling it out."

Zeng Juan's family made candles, so he naturally knew the importance of fire control. Maintaining the fire required painstaking effort—when making a certain kind of candle, only certain firewood was burned: charcoal, wood, rice husk, or straw. The fire control was different and very subtle. His father said when he learned the business from his grandfather back then, he got quite a few "knocks on the head" for this.

Now the Australians solved it lightly with a thermometer.

"Mmm, some are a bit burnt." Zeng Juan smacked his lips, raising the half-bitten cookie in his hand to signal Zhang Yu.

"I told dad, even if it costs a high price, we must buy a thermometer—unfortunately, there is no stock in Guangzhou now. Chief Hong said he would find a way to help us import one from Lingao."

"Sigh, ever since your family hugged that Chief Hong's thigh, you've become more and more prosperous and advanced." Hearing his words, Zeng Juan suddenly looked dejected for a moment. But immediately, as if making up his mind, he picked up the "Public Basic Knowledge Manual" and started reading and reciting.

Zhang Yu knew Zeng Juan was interested in his cousin. He could guess seventy or eighty percent of the reason for those confusing words just now. He intended to matchmake in his heart but had no suitable words to say. Perhaps, as Zeng Juan wished, studying the Australian exam materials well and finally passing the Australian exam would achieve his thoughts.

Thinking of this, he took out a thick book from the pocket he carried.

"This is what I just bought from the Australian bookstore. Lending it to you to read."

"What idle book, I don't have time to read now..." Zeng Juan scanned it casually and instantly widened his eyes. The cover was prominently printed with "Analysis of 200 Real Questions of Shen Lun (Essay Writing)."

Zeng Juan's reading and reciting enterprise was interrupted by surprise once again. "You... you... you kid really have money! This book sells for 12 yuan! My dad can't save 12 silver cakes working hard for a year!" He suddenly stopped talking and looked at Zhang Yu with doubtful eyes, "You are lending this book to me?"

"I have no use if I don't lend it to you—I don't plan to take the civil service exam; business at home can't leave me." Zhang Yu spoke with the tone of a new business elite.

"But this is too expensive, I deserve it with shame, deserve it with shame..." (Idiom: ashamed to accept)

"It's lending to you, not giving to you." Zhang Yu emphasized the word "lend," "As for money, don't worry. The 'single soldier energy bar' my family trial-produced last time passed the appraisal. The Fubo Army Joint Logistics signed a big order. The Australians are going to install machines for my family and build a new factory specifically to produce this thing. The prepaid deposit has already arrived. Buying a book is nothing."

"12 yuan for a book is nothing..." Zeng Juan muttered a few times, smiling bitterly, "Just this 'Public Basic Knowledge Manual' and an exam syllabus cost six silver cakes, causing me to seek a student loan from Delong. Now I have to work reading newspapers at this reading point every day to pay off the debt! You kid's family, let me calculate, besides Chen Liji, your family is the second one the Australians injected capital to set up a factory for, right! Why do you have such good luck!"

Zhang Yu himself often sighed that if he hadn't risked it back then and hooked up with... the Australians first, he didn't know what situation his small tea food shop would be in now.

"Ajuan, as soon as this summer passes, the Australians' first Enke (special civil service exam) will be held. Work hard. Take the book and read it—we are good brothers." Zhang Yu said in a very sincere tone.

Zeng Juan looked at Zhang Yu silently, his lower lip trembling, but he didn't know what to say. Words of thanks were so pale and powerless at this moment.

"En, mutual encouragement with you, gentleman!" Zeng Juan answered forcefully, spoke no more, and turned his head to continue gnawing on that "Public Basic Knowledge Manual" which he couldn't fully understand and could only memorize by rote.

Zhang Yu didn't disturb him anymore, lifted the curtain, and walked out. He heard the tea guests outside, who hadn't dispersed yet, discussing enthusiastically the content Zeng Juan read just now. Those who were literate spread the "Yangcheng Express" on the table, pointing and gesturing.

"What kind of thing is this electrician (dian-gong)? Isn't it Duke of Thunder and Mother of Lightning? Why Electric-Duke (dian-gong) now? The Australians' new trick?"

"This is the 'gong' of craftsman, not the 'gong' of male/female," a literate person said, "Does the thunder and lightning in the sky also use craftsmen?"

"What exactly is going on with Portugal and Spain? Why does the King of Spain control Portugal? Speaking of which, didn't the Zeng family kid say last time that this Spain is the Franks? Last time he seemed to say there is a France north of Spain, which doesn't get along with the Franks! These countries in the West feel messy."

"What's there to say about a few foals born on that Jeju Island, sending a special manuscript!"

"You have no knowledge now. Horses correspond pregnant longer than humans, taking twelve months. And it's not a few horses, but more than two hundred foals born in this wave of late spring and early summer, and all survived. Do you know the market price of horses?"

"Why hasn't this Mao Family Inn case been solved until now? This group of Australian police, I see, is also ordinary!" A tea guest boasted shamelessly, "They are quite adept at catching littering and spitting and fining..."

...

Amidst the noise, Zhang Yu saw bold red characters on the front page placed aside writing "Guangzhou Special Municipality Advanced Worker Commendation Conference Held Today." Just as he wanted to look carefully, several familiar customers from the past saw him and called out.

"Ayu! You are a rare guest!"

"Come, come, come over quickly and drink tea together!"

"Ajuan wants to study again, tell us about the things in this newspaper."

"Exactly, you are familiar with the Australians, must know more clearly than him."

...

Running business with his father these days, Zhang Yu had improved greatly in dealing with people. Doing business required popularity. He immediately cupped his hands in greeting with a smile, greeted people around him in a circle, and then sat down.

What tea guests cared about most was the recent Mao Family Inn major case.

"Ayu, tell us, what exactly is the trick in this Mao Family Inn case? Making a rising wind and scudding clouds (creating a stir) all over the city, and still no accurate news until now? This group of people offends heaven and reason; the Australians caught them but don't interrogate or execute by slicing, just detaining them like this?"

"This group of flower-patters truly deserves ten thousand deaths! I heard people say they are also engaging in some sorcery?"

"That's right, truly engaging in sorcery!" A tea guest lowered his voice, pretending to be mysterious, "I heard Lord Liu (Mayor Liu Xiang) fell for it and was almost bedridden. Later, a Daoist priest was invited from Lingao to exorcise it."

"It is said they also subdued a little ghost (imp). My second aunt's three brothers' cousin's brother-in-law is a cleaner in the city government, he said so."

"I heard Daoist Zhang from the Five Immortals Temple say that this gang of demons wants to break Guangzhou's Fengshui! Ruin local dragon vein."

"Where does Guangzhou have any dragon vein? That Daoist Zhang of yours doesn't even have a Daoist certificate."
