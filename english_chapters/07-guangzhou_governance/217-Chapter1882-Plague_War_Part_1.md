# Chapter 1882 - Plague War (Part 1)

## Plague War (Part 1)

Though bubonic plague remained a deadly infectious disease, even in the 21st century with multiple treatment options available, the most effective measures were still strict quarantine and isolation. The great Manchurian plague epidemic of the early 20th century had been controlled precisely through isolation measures—extinguishing the plague's spread without any specific medication.

Their current medical conditions were really no different from those of the late Qing government in the early 20th century. So Lin Motian could only rely on these same methods.

Fortunately, there had been no large-scale outbreak yet. As long as they isolated from the source in time, they might be able to halt it before it erupted.

One thing had been done at exactly the right time: the comprehensive collection of beggars and vagrants. This group had near-100% infection rates of parasites like fleas, and their living environments harbored filth—they were natural gathering places for pathogens. Beggars also had the characteristic of mobility and broad contact, making them highly likely to spread disease.

Comprehensive collection was essentially cutting off this massive source of infection. From this perspective, Mayor Liu's determination had been perfectly timed. Of course, much credit also went to the police system that had been established over the past half-year—many basic administrative tasks were now being handled entirely by the police system.

However, people who had been in contact with patients needed somewhere to be isolated. Not just plague contacts, but also any lepers they would take in in the future.

Lin Motian unrolled the large-scale Guangzhou-Hong Kong map hanging on the wall and studied it carefully.

The islands around the Pearl River estuary were scattered like stars, and islands could effectively prevent human traffic. The island environments were also relatively healthier. Thus he decided to establish the quarantine zone for deadly infectious diseases on an island. At first glance there were many choices—both inner river islands in the Pearl River and sea islands in the inner and outer Lingding Ocean. But to meet quarantine requirements, the island couldn't be too far from Guangzhou—otherwise transporting patients each time would take too long—yet it couldn't be too close to the mainland, or it wouldn't serve to isolate patients. The island also had to have fresh water.

Though the various islands in the inner and outer Lingding Ocean seemed suitable in all respects, they were all too far from Guangzhou. Even choosing Longxue Island, the closest in the inner Lingding Ocean, it was still 86 kilometers to Guangzhou. Even using motorized boats like the Dafa, traveling from Guangzhou to Longxue Island would take over ten hours. Not only was the transit time for transporting patients too long, but security would also be difficult to arrange.

If they chose an inner river island in the Pearl River, it would be closer to Guangzhou, but isolating patients would become problematic. Though the Pearl River was wide, there were numerous fishing boats on the river, greatly increasing the possibility of escape. Moreover, many river islands had already been developed into farmland and villages. Establishing a quarantine zone would inevitably affect the normal production and life of the island's residents.

Caught between these difficulties, Lin Motian circled a few candidate islands—the final decision would still be in the hands of the Guangzhou Municipal Government anyway.

That evening, Lin Motian was summoned to the municipal government to attend a "Epidemic Prevention Work Conference" with Liu Xiang and others. Facing the terrifying prospect of a possible plague outbreak, Liu Xiang simply stated: "Everything will be done according to your requirements."

As for the island quarantine zone, Lin Motian proposed several alternatives, including both river islands and sea islands. In the end, Liu Xiang approved establishing the quarantine zone on Changzhou Island in the Pearl River.

"There are a few villages on Changzhou Island, but the population is small, and we can't drive the villagers from their homes," Liu Xiang said as he signed the letter of appointment and authorization, his face clouded with worry. "With over ten thousand people and no time to quickly build a camp... they'll probably have to sleep outdoors."

"The camp isn't a big problem. It's summer now—a thatched hut will do. No one will freeze to death," Lin Motian said. "Who will be responsible for building the camp? I have some things to discuss with them specifically."

"Just find Lin Baiguang for that." Liu Xiang nodded toward Lin Baiguang. "Whatever requirements you have, you can contact the person in charge directly—I'll issue meeting minutes, and all levels of municipal government cadres will follow your commands."

Lin Baiguang nodded: "Tell me, what are your specific requirements? I'll arrange it immediately."

As he spoke, he had already pulled out a notepad from his briefcase and was writing rapidly with his Montblanc fountain pen. Before Lin Motian even opened his mouth, he had already finished one sheet, pulled a stamp from his pocket and stamped it, folded it, and handed it to the confidential secretary.

"Send this to the National Army Command immediately, quick!"

"I've already ordered a company from the White Horse Squad to move to Changzhou Island immediately. The Coast Guard has a guard post there—that shouldn't be a problem, right?"

"No problem at all." Lin Motian quickly replied. His clansman was truly "meticulous in thought"—not only had he immediately made preparations, but he had specifically transferred a Korean company that didn't speak the local language to guard the island.

"Now tell me your requirements."

Lin Motian explained that the quarantine zone didn't actually need very complete infrastructure, nor did it need to accommodate over ten thousand people for long-term residence. Because the plague's incubation period was very short—the medical community generally considered it to be six days.

"...Once sent to the island, anyone who doesn't develop symptoms after nine days of isolation can be considered uninfected. Then they can be transferred to the refugee camps in Hong Kong for resettlement. So the residential facilities don't need to be elaborate."

The quarantine camp Lin Motian designed was divided into three parts. The first part was the purification facility—quarantine personnel arriving on the island would be "purified" by standard procedures: bathing, disinfection, shaving all body hair, and burning all personal clothing.

"...We need to build a specialized garbage incinerator to burn the personal clothing of quarantine personnel. Also build a cremation furnace to cremate any personnel who die during quarantine. Sewage and feces need dedicated disinfection pools and cannot be discharged directly into the river..." Lin Motian enumerated each point. According to his plan, the camp would be divided into three zones. The first zone was the observation zone—personnel who had been purified would first be held in the arrival area for 24 hours, then transferred to the detention zone for nine days of quarantine isolation. The last zone was the treatment zone, housing personnel who became ill during quarantine. Each zone had to be completely isolated from the others.

Though called treatment, in reality they had neither gentamicin nor streptomycin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol. The only effective antibiotic was sulfonamide, but the product purity was poor, reducing efficacy and causing quite a few deaths from drug allergies alone. Essential treatment support like intravenous infusion equipment and materials was also in short supply. What was called "treatment" was really just "waiting for death." The purpose was simply to prevent patients from spreading the bacteria to others before dying.

"...The quarantine camp doesn't need to occupy the entire island—just a small area will do. Too large an area would be difficult to secure. But there must be sufficient separation between each zone. Their positions cannot be upwind or downwind of each other."

As he spoke point by point, Lin Baiguang recorded each one in his notebook. When Lin Motian finished, Lin Baiguang had also finished writing:

"Is there anything else?"

"That's all for now," Lin Motian said. "The Great Library certainly has more complete blueprints and materials, but unfortunately we'd have to go back to Lingao to access them."

"Send someone back to check right away," Lin Baiguang said. "Write up a request, and I'll arrange for someone to retrieve the materials."

"Good." Lin Motian secretly admired this clansman's decisive, no-nonsense efficiency.

"The two furnaces will take some time, but if we improvise, we can manage," Lin Baiguang said, flipping through his notebook. "I'll arrange the building materials and workers—mainly timber, reed mats, and wire; we'll request emergency rations from the United Logistics Headquarters in Hong Kong for food supply. Utensils and pots we'll find in the Enterprise Planning Bureau's Guangzhou warehouse—there should be plenty of confiscated goods there. For clothing, we'll get supplies from the Enterprise Planning Bureau's Hong Kong warehouse—there are refugee camps there, so the warehouse should have reserves."

As he spoke, he wrote on his notepad, then immediately had Liu Xiang and Lin Motian review and sign. Before long, several "applications" were completed.

"Let's split up and get moving," Liu Xiang said, his face pale. It really was one wave after another. Being mayor of Guangzhou was truly no easy job.

Lin Motian naturally had no free time either. He immediately began discussing the police system's work with Mu Min.

The Elders' Council had no formal grassroots organizations like neighborhood committees in Guangzhou yet. Many basic administrative tasks were being implemented through a three-tier system of Police Bureau—Police Station—Baojia. Therefore, epidemic prevention also required strong support from the police system.

Previously, the Guangzhou Municipal Government had already printed and distributed a "Public Health Manual." This manual was intended for all grassroots cadres and police, and each baojia's baozhang had also received a copy. Besides some basic content like "maintain cleanliness and hygiene," "eliminate the four pests," and "good living habits," it also contained descriptions of symptoms for many common and uncommon infectious diseases, aimed at enabling these grassroots personnel to promptly identify and report cases.

To prevent the low-educated grassroots workers and baojia heads from getting various technical terms wrong when making reports, the health department, when compiling this section, simply used terms like Disease No. 1, Disease No. 2, and so on instead.

Now he required the police and baojia systems to closely monitor the health conditions of personnel in their areas according to the symptoms described in the manual. Beat officers had to conduct daily inspections of their jurisdictions and listen to reports from baojia heads on the health of all residents and temporary transient personnel. Reports were to be submitted daily to the Health Section of the Municipal Police Bureau. The health police would separately arrange spot-checks and inspections.

In addition to these measures, each bao would have a dedicated quarantine inspector added. Like the beat cops, the quarantine inspector would patrol regularly, keeping track of the exact health conditions of all households in the bao, collecting information about their contact with plague patients. Any suspected or confirmed plague cases had to be immediately isolated and reported.

To ensure cases would be promptly reported, he didn't dare entrust definitive diagnoses to Guangzhou's local traditional Chinese doctors. Setting aside professional issues, their numbers alone were far from sufficient. Lin Motian had originally wanted to use only naturalized cadres or Fubo Army soldiers, but it proved impossible to assign that many personnel for his exclusive use.
