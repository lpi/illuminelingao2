# Chapter 1882 - Plague War (Part 1)

Though bubonic plague remained deadly even in the twenty-first century, where multiple treatments existed, the most effective countermeasures were still rigorous quarantine and isolation. The great Manchurian plague epidemic of the early twentieth century had been controlled through precisely these methods—the disease extinguished without any specific medication.

Their current medical capabilities were essentially no different from those of the late Qing government in that same era. Lin Motian had only these same tools at his disposal.

Fortunately, no large-scale outbreak had occurred yet. Swift isolation from the source might halt the epidemic before it erupted.

One measure had been implemented at precisely the right moment: the comprehensive collection of beggars and vagrants. This population suffered from near-universal parasitic infestation—fleas and lice—and their living conditions harbored filth, making them natural reservoirs for pathogens. Their mobility and broad contact networks made them highly likely vectors for disease transmission.

The comprehensive collection essentially severed this massive infection source. Mayor Liu's decisive action had been perfectly timed. Credit was also due to the police system established over the past half-year—many basic administrative tasks now functioned entirely through police infrastructure.

However, those who had contacted patients needed somewhere for isolation. Not merely plague contacts, but also any lepers they might take in future.

Lin Motian unrolled the large-scale Guangzhou-Hong Kong map mounted on his wall and studied it carefully.

Islands dotted the Pearl River estuary like scattered stars, and islands could effectively prevent human traffic. Island environments also tended to be healthier. He decided to establish the deadly infectious disease quarantine zone on an island. At first glance, choices appeared abundant—inner river islands in the Pearl River, and sea islands in both the inner and outer Lingding Ocean. But to satisfy quarantine requirements, the island couldn't be too distant from Guangzhou—otherwise patient transport would take too long—yet it couldn't be too close to the mainland, or isolation would be compromised. Fresh water was also essential.

The various islands in the inner and outer Lingding Ocean seemed suitable in every respect, yet all lay too far from Guangzhou. Even Longxue Island, the closest in the inner Lingding Ocean, sat eighty-six kilometers away. Even motorized vessels like the Dafa would require over ten hours to reach it from Guangzhou. Patient transit times would be excessive, and security arrangements would prove difficult.

Choosing an inner river island in the Pearl River would place them closer to Guangzhou, but patient isolation would become problematic. Though the Pearl River was wide, fishing boats swarmed its waters, greatly increasing escape possibilities. Moreover, many river islands had already been developed into farmland and villages. Establishing a quarantine zone would inevitably disrupt the normal production and lives of island residents.

Caught between these competing demands, Lin Motian circled several candidate islands—the final decision would rest with the Guangzhou Municipal Government.

That evening, Lin Motian was summoned to the municipal government for an "Epidemic Prevention Work Conference" with Liu Xiang and others. Facing the terrifying prospect of a possible plague outbreak, Liu Xiang stated simply: "Everything will be done according to your requirements."

Regarding the island quarantine zone, Lin Motian proposed several alternatives, including both river and sea islands. Liu Xiang ultimately approved establishing the quarantine zone on Changzhou Island in the Pearl River.

"Several villages exist on Changzhou Island, though the population is small. We can't drive villagers from their homes," Liu Xiang said as he signed the letter of appointment and authorization, his face clouded with worry. "With over ten thousand people and no time for rapid camp construction... they'll probably sleep outdoors."

"The camp presents no major problem. It's summer—thatched huts will suffice. No one will freeze." Lin Motian paused. "Who will handle camp construction? I have specific requirements to discuss with them."

"Just find Lin Baiguang for that." Liu Xiang nodded toward Lin Baiguang. "Whatever requirements you have, contact the person in charge directly—I'll issue meeting minutes, and all municipal government cadres will follow your commands."

Lin Baiguang nodded. "Tell me your specific requirements. I'll arrange everything immediately."

As he spoke, he had already drawn a notepad from his briefcase and was writing rapidly with his Montblanc fountain pen. Before Lin Motian even opened his mouth, Lin Baiguang had finished one sheet, pulled a stamp from his pocket, applied it, folded the paper, and handed it to the confidential secretary.

"Send this to the National Army Command immediately. Quickly!"

"I've already ordered a company from the White Horse Squad to Changzhou Island. The Coast Guard has a guard post there—that shouldn't pose any problems, correct?"

"None at all." Lin Motian quickly replied. His clansman was truly meticulous—not only had he made immediate preparations, but he had specifically transferred a Korean company that didn't speak the local language to guard the island.

"Now tell me your requirements."

Lin Motian explained that the quarantine zone didn't actually require elaborate infrastructure, nor did it need to accommodate over ten thousand people for extended residence. Plague's incubation period was remarkably brief—the medical community generally considered it six days.

"...Once sent to the island, anyone who remains symptom-free after nine days of isolation can be considered uninfected. They can then transfer to Hong Kong's refugee camps for resettlement. The residential facilities needn't be elaborate."

The quarantine camp Lin Motian designed comprised three sections. The first was the purification facility—quarantine personnel arriving on the island would undergo "purification" via standard procedures: bathing, disinfection, complete body-hair removal, and incineration of all personal clothing.

"...We need a specialized garbage incinerator for burning quarantine personnel's personal clothing. Also a cremation furnace for cremating anyone who dies during quarantine. Sewage and feces require dedicated disinfection pools—direct river discharge is prohibited..." Lin Motian enumerated each point. According to his plan, the camp would divide into three zones. The first was the observation zone—purified personnel would remain in the arrival area for twenty-four hours before transferring to the detention zone for nine days of quarantine isolation. The final zone was the treatment area, housing anyone who fell ill during quarantine. Each zone required complete isolation from the others.

Though called treatment, in reality they possessed neither gentamicin nor streptomycin, tetracycline, nor chloramphenicol. The only effective antibiotic was sulfonamide, but poor product purity reduced efficacy, and drug allergies alone had already claimed lives. Essential treatment support—intravenous infusion equipment and materials—was also in short supply. What they termed "treatment" was really "waiting for death." The purpose was simply preventing patients from spreading bacteria to others before dying.

"...The quarantine camp needn't occupy the entire island—a small area will suffice. Too large an area would be impossible to secure. But sufficient separation between zones is essential. Their positions cannot be upwind or downwind of each other."

As Lin Motian spoke, Lin Baiguang recorded each point in his notebook. When Lin Motian finished, Lin Baiguang had also completed his notes.

"Anything else?"

"That's all for now," Lin Motian said. "The Great Library certainly contains more complete blueprints and materials, but we'd need to return to Lingao to access them."

"We'll send someone immediately." Lin Baiguang said. "Write up a request, and I'll arrange material retrieval."

"Good." Lin Motian secretly admired his clansman's decisive, no-nonsense efficiency.

"The two furnaces will require some time, but improvisation is possible," Lin Baiguang said, flipping through his notebook. "I'll arrange building materials and workers—primarily timber, reed mats, and wire. We'll request emergency rations from the United Logistics Headquarters in Hong Kong. Utensils and cookware we'll find in the Enterprise Planning Bureau's Guangzhou warehouse—plenty of confiscated goods there. For clothing, we'll draw supplies from the Bureau's Hong Kong warehouse—the refugee camps there should maintain reserves."

As he spoke, he wrote on his notepad, then immediately had Liu Xiang and Lin Motian review and sign. Before long, several "applications" were complete.

"Let's divide and mobilize," Liu Xiang said, his face pale. It really was one crisis after another. Being mayor of Guangzhou was no easy burden.

Lin Motian had no leisure time either. He immediately began discussing police system operations with Mu Min.

The Elders' Council had no formal grassroots organizations like neighborhood committees in Guangzhou yet. Many basic administrative tasks were implemented through a three-tier system: Police Bureau, Police Station, and Baojia. Epidemic prevention therefore required strong police system support.

Previously, the Guangzhou Municipal Government had printed and distributed a "Public Health Manual." Intended for all grassroots cadres and police, each baojia's *baozhang* had also received a copy. Beyond basic content—"maintain cleanliness and hygiene," "eliminate the four pests," "good living habits"—it contained symptom descriptions for numerous common and uncommon infectious diseases, enabling grassroots personnel to promptly identify and report cases.

To prevent low-educated grassroots workers and baojia heads from mangling technical terminology in reports, the health department had simply used Disease No. 1, Disease No. 2, and so forth.

He now required the police and baojia systems to closely monitor health conditions of personnel in their areas according to manual descriptions. Beat officers had to conduct daily jurisdiction inspections and hear reports from baojia heads regarding the health of all residents and temporary transients. Reports were to be submitted daily to the Municipal Police Bureau's Health Section. Health police would separately arrange spot-checks and inspections.

Additionally, each *bao* would receive a dedicated quarantine inspector. Like beat cops, the quarantine inspector would patrol regularly, tracking precise health conditions of all households in the *bao* and collecting information about their contact with plague patients. Any suspected or confirmed plague cases required immediate isolation and reporting.

To ensure prompt reporting, he dared not entrust definitive diagnoses to Guangzhou's local traditional Chinese doctors. Professional limitations aside, their numbers were far from sufficient. Lin Motian had originally wanted to use only naturalized cadres or Fubo Army soldiers, but assigning that many personnel for his exclusive use proved impossible.
