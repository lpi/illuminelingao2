# Chapter 2046 - The Person Eating Empty Rations

Seeing the situation, which had just improved, about to slide into chaos again, Xiao Zishan quickly stood up. "What everyone says makes sense. I didn't consider it thoroughly just now. Then... how about this?" Xiao Zishan calmed himself, waited for the surrounding noise to subside a bit, and continued, "First, we still need to build dedicated official ships. Second, everyone's private yachts naturally shouldn't be delayed. But regarding the shipyard situation, everyone just heard—it's fully booked. Besides, ships need to be designed, which takes time. So the expedient method for now is still to use Great Wave's ships, which everyone has taken before. We can book a VIP cabin or charter the whole ship for you. At that time, key positions on the ship will be replaced by Security Bureau personnel. As for dangerous waters, if Great Wave isn't convenient, you can take Navy non-combat vessels..." Xiao Zishan looked toward the Navy Elders, thinking: I gave you a ladder; if you insist on being stubborn and provoking public anger, don't blame others.

"Excluding transport ships, Navy non-combat sequence vessels also include dispatch ships, survey ships, etc. Speed is decent, but the environment is average. If you take them, we will specifically instruct the captain to prioritize Elder safety and mission as the primary task, but the accompanying Elder must also obey the captain's arrangements. At that time, our Navy will also dispatch combat vessels to escort you. If enemies are encountered, everyone's ship retreats first, letting the warships engage. As for those willing to board warships, they must unconditionally obey the captain and not interfere with combat." The Navy crowd's half-step-back stance caused another buzz, but this time it was relatively reasonable, so no one stood up to confront them.

"Why differentiate between booking a cabin and chartering the ship when taking Great Wave's liner? If just booking a cabin, what if Great Ming death-squads sneak aboard? Not all Great Wave crew members have passed the Political Security Bureau's high-standard investigation. Killing someone at sea is much easier than on land." Someone turned back to the initial topic.

"No need to charter a ship every time, too wasteful..."

"I also think chartering a ship at the drop of a hat is too wasteful. If transporting goods and personnel together, it's fine. But to charter a whole ship just for one Elder is really..." Obviously, some felt adhering to revolutionary frugality was better.

"I think it's better this way: borrow from the original maid subsidy practice. For official business trips taking private commercial ships, the General Office will pay travel subsidies comparable to charter costs, how about that?"

"Per head or per trip?"

"Per head, of course."

"What about non-official business? For example, if I want to take my child to Guangzhou for fun..."

"Self-paid." Just as everyone thought this wrangling was over, Wu Nanhai, who had been silent, suddenly indicated he wanted to speak. "I think Director Xiao's principle is very good. If not taking public vehicles or ships for official business, the General Office pays. for private matters, the General Office helps arrange and contact, and the General Bodyguard Bureau is responsible for safety. These costs are self-paid. Otherwise, wouldn't busy people unable to get away suffer a loss?"

Wu Nanhai's words caused another buzz. Everyone spoke at once, but obviously, all were indicating they belonged to the "busy people unable to get away" category, so they naturally praised the Minister of Agriculture's proposal. Wu Nanhai continued: "Also, regarding the self-built private yachts mentioned just now. I think the General Office can pay to rent everyone's idle yachts when travel ships are needed—of course, entirely voluntary. This would benefit both public and private interests."

"We can design and manufacture several sets of modular Elder standard cabin kits, easy to install and dismantle, saving everyone the trouble of caring about cabin issues when choosing ships..."

"We will prioritize listing this part of the expenses in this year's extra-budgetary expenditure and disburse it as soon as possible..."

The meeting ended quite successfully. The Navy avoided the destruction of the "engage upon sight" rule; the soy-sauce Elders satisfied their self-esteem and sense of security; the Finance Sector avoided paying large dividends... Everyone was happy. The only ones not so happy were the tax department—Salina's matter was inexplicably ruined by this unrelated affair.

Although it was ruined, Ai Zhixin thought there was still a chance: after all, the opposition wasn't as loud as he expected. However, Zhang Xiaoqi said in her letter that she remained like a Daoist cultivator—aside from doing her job well, she didn't seem to care about these things, nor did she care where she worked.

"Maybe she hasn't truly planned to accept us people in her heart." Zhang Xiaoqi wrote at the end.

"If she hasn't accepted, then so be it," Wang Qiyi thought. "But Chief Cheng's calculation is truly shrewd, winning both ways. As for the Navy bunch, carrying the sedan chair for others aside, they were sold and still happily counting money." Of course, seeing through it without saying it, Wang Qiyi muttered in his heart while pulling his thoughts back, turning his gaze to the Lin family report delivered by Yao Yulan and the others last night on the table.

Wang Qiyi picked up the report on the table and went through it again. This was already his third time reading it. Overall, the writing was a bit awkward, with quite a few typos and grammatical errors. But fortunately, the logic was clear and straightforward, and the event description was detailed. Especially lacking the "boots and hats" (prologue and epilogue formalities) of old-timeline report materials, reading it felt refreshing.

The Lin family's main businesses were basically fronted by Guiren Ju, but whether purchasing or supplying, the actual transaction parties were those wine shops and tea houses in which the Lin family held large shares. The parties used handwritten notes stamped with Luo Zhixiang's private seal for transactions, with ridiculously chaotic prices. Inputs and outputs were recorded in the books, but typically large input and small output—situations where a *dan* of rice cost 10 or 20 taels of silver were common. When asked, the answer was "poor management, bought expensive"... The Lin family did this simply because the bulk of their business profits didn't come from these goods transactions at all. "Large input, small output" could effectively inflate operating costs, so even if revenues from various businesses were recorded normally, the calculated profit was negligible, or even operating at a loss. As for the Lin family, naturally there were no dividends to take, naturally poor as church mice. Taxes? Impossible.

"Heh, operating in debt—concept quite advanced." Wang Qiyi looked at the Lin family balance sheet copied on the attached page, thinking they really didn't take the Council of Elders seriously. We are hair-thieves; are we easier to deal with than Ming clerks? It seems for the catering service industry, levying based on turnover is more appropriate...

"Little Hu!"

"Here!"

"Call Team Leader Yao and the others to my office!"

Wang Qiyi's office wasn't big; once Yao Yulan and the other two sat down, it seemed full.

"I've read your report. Very good, written clearly and logically. So, how do you think we should do this job next?" Wang Qiyi cut the crap and went straight to the point.

"Reporting to Director Wang, we..."

"Team Leader Yao, sit down, sit down and speak."

"Okay..." Seeing Wang Qiyi wave for her to sit, Yao Yulan adjusted her clothes somewhat awkwardly and sat back on the sofa. "After discussion, the three of us agree we can start from two aspects."

"En, which two aspects? Briefly explain." Wang Qiyi looked attentive, all ears.

"First, make tax adjustments to current accounts, especially cost categories, to re-verify profits. The goal is to find out exactly how much dividend the Lin family took. But the workload is relatively large, requiring temporary deployment of personnel with accounting basics to assist."

"That's no problem. I can arrange verifies and transfer some personnel from accounting undergoing rotation to the front line to go over."

"Thank you, Director Wang. The second aspect is to expand the investigation scope to verify long-term large accounts receivable. This is to accurately grasp their operating income and find out how much business tax was evaded. We use the cash basis; this method of keeping accounts on credit should be cracked down on."

"Expand the scope to where?"

"Based on the payers of large receivables. Removing those not under Council rule, about twenty households remain. But some of these people aren't on our inspection list, and some are out of town."

"That doesn't matter. Ignore those in Ming territory. For anyone under Council rule needing investigation, you have inspection power. For those out of town, make a list later, and I'll sign external investigation letters for you. Anything else?"

"Director Wang..." Yao Yulan hesitated and said, "Just now downstairs, Comrade Chu and Comrade Xu also mentioned a matter. I didn't hear very clearly. Let them report to you."

"Then let me speak first." Seeing Wang Qiyi turn his gaze to her, Chu Xiaoran didn't demur. "Actually, there's another relatively reasonable and legal way to move money, which is eating empty rations (ghost employees)..."

Eating empty rations? Wang Qiyi thought he really hadn't considered this layer, habitually thinking this crap only happened in the military and government agencies.

"Some shops have ten or more people on the books than actually employed. Because most shop assistants in Ming don't have monthly salaries, the numbers are impossible to verify..."

This situation was actually reflected in the "Basic Situation Report of Industry and Commerce." In this timeline's catering business, employees—"waiters," "tea servers"—generally weren't paid wages by the boss, relying on tips sharing and other in-store earnings for income. Naturally, the boss wouldn't issue a payroll.

But on the current tax registration forms, these shop assistants and waiters who previously had no wages suddenly all had wages, and not low ones.

"...These people generally receive higher profit shares than those who actually work, and most change names every year. Some shops simply invent a few old masters in there, paying ridiculously high monthly wages, three-festival bonuses, and year-end profit shares. The shop's profit sharing to others is just openly moved through these fake name lists," Xu Zhewei added. Obviously, the shop where he was an accountant was much larger than Chu Xiaoran's family's, and he knew the tricks better.

Wang Qiyi nodded. Nothing new under the sun; 17th-century tricks are played the same way in the 21st century. "Then what's your suggestion?"

"We suggest coordinating with the Police Bureau to verify the number of employees in several larger wine shops and tea houses. The basic data registered during Guangzhou's liberation transferred from the Police Bureau only has aggregate numbers, but looking at the remarks, the Police Bureau has the number of hired workers and family members for each shop. I think this can be used as a draft."
