# Chapter 2032 - Collective Wedding (Part 2)

Fang Fei was the commander-in-chief, so he arrived at the wharf early in the morning. Seeing the sea of people on the wharf, it could be described as "onlookers forming a wall." He hadn't expected the impact of this collective wedding to be so great! Although Zhang Haogu had long said: "Do not underestimate the energy of human beings for 'watching the fun'." But he really hadn't expected so many onlookers to come all at once.

His sedan chair was carried with great difficulty through a passage opened by the National Army to the signal tower beside the wharf. Fang Fei climbed the tower, from where he could overlook the entire Tianzi Wharf. Although the outside of the wharf was packed with people everywhere, inside the security cordon, it appeared orderly.

The *Octopus* and the "Flower-tailed Barge" it towed were dressed up like yachts for a beauty pageant parade, not only clustered with flowers but also using a lot of silk and satin. This was tied together by local craftsmen according to Fang Fei's design drawings. Although the appearance was roughly similar, due to material limitations, there was somewhat of a sense of dissonance—traditional flower farmers mostly grew and sold flowering trees and shrubs, rarely having large quantities of fresh cut flowers like in the old timeline; naturally, there was no large-scale cultivation of garden roses here either. The artistic conception of this flower boat was just that little bit lacking.

What lacked artistic conception wasn't just the specious flower boat; the noisy band could actually vibrate his brain with an unusually sharp frequency against such a noisy background, making his head hurt all over—it was nothing like the folk music in his mind!

Awnings were set up on the wharf, and underneath, the grooms waited anxiously. The grooms all wore formal "Hair clothing," a uniform navy blue "National Suit"—this was also the style most worn by male naturalized employee cadres in peacetime. However, today as "formal wear," the fabric used wasn't soft cotton cloth, but thickened hemp fabric; not only did it look crisp, but it was also cheaper and cooler than wool. It was very suitable for the current weather. To highlight their "groom" identity, everyone also wore a flower on their chest. Compared to the chattering brides looking around on the "Dragon" boats, the grooms under the awning seemed somewhat shy, holding their breath and concentrating one by one, pretending to be calm as they waited for their wives' arrival.

Opposite them, there was another awning. The people inside were in pairs, also wearing today's groom and bride outfits. These dozens of couples were naturalized citizen couples who had married through free love earlier. Because their past weddings were relatively simple or simply not held, they signed up to participate this time, counting as a "supplementary ceremony." They were "old husbands and wives," naturally not as shy as result "newcomers," looking around with uncontrollable joy one by one. From time to time, they pointed at the flower boats docked at the wharf.

The atmosphere was much more enthusiastic than imagined, and the festive mood also infected Fang Fei. However, as the planner of the entire wedding, his nerves were still taut—the larger the scale, the more links there were, and the greater the possibility of problems. This was the experience he had summarized from years of mingling in cultural exhibition companies and hosting countless exhibitions, conferences, large-scale events, and weddings.

"Chief! Those five dragons are coming!" The secretary beside him whispered.

Fang Fei immediately turned to the perspective the secretary pointed to—without binoculars, he could see five lantern-decked "Dragon" sampans approaching. For caution, he still raised his binoculars to confirm, and immediately gave the order: "Music pause," "Firecrackers ready," "Dragon and Lion Dance teams ready"... a series of orders were passed down.

As his instructions were transmitted to the signal platform, several semaphore operators immediately transmitted each command to every position. In just a moment, all places received the orders. As the drum music ceased, the onlookers seemed to realize something was about to happen immediately, and ceased chatting. The originally noisy wharf suddenly quieted down, with only the sound of colorful flags flapping "lie-lie" in the air.

The Dragons gradually approached the shore. Tianzi Wharf had specially cleared the berths, leaving about several hundred meters of berthing space empty so that the five Dragons could dock alongside simultaneously. The sailors used were also carefully selected from Dabo Shipping, guaranteeing docking in one go.

Under the sailors' manipulation, the five Dragons turned in unison, turning their broadsides to approach the shore. With a command from the signal tower, the originally silent wharf suddenly erupted with a sharp suona sound. Following this "starting tune" sufficient to pierce eardrums, all wind and percussion instruments started instantly. Although the melody played was nondescript, the Elders could roughly tell it was "Today is a Good Day."

Immediately following was the crackling explosion of dozens of strings of ten-thousand-character long firecrackers already hung on both sides, mixed with the dull roar of muskets. The firecrackers were all specially purchased "Floor-full-red"—the firecrackers used red paper inside; after exploding, red paper fragments covered the ground, very beautiful and festive, high-grade goods only used by wealthy families for weddings.

The lion and dragon teams on both sides also began to dance with the firecrackers. Dragon and lion dancing was a traditional sports and entertainment project for Guangzhou citizens and suburban folks. The eight teams coming to this wedding all requested to serve voluntarily, stating clearly that all members would only eat meals and not take money. The purpose was nothing more than to "show off their lives" ("Sun Ming") in front of the Australians and all the people of Guangzhou.

Here, gangplanks were set up on the boats. He Xiaoyue was the first to disembark. Today she wasn't a "Big Lapel Sister" (professional bridesmaid), but she acted exactly like one, directing more than ten female employees to support the brides down the gangplanks beside the boat.

The crowd surged like waves, boiling instantly—the new brides are coming! These former low-class prostitutes looked dark and gloomy when they entered the shelter, emaciated by years of bottom-rung life and prostitution, mostly suffering from various diseases. In these few months, their illnesses were cured, and a regular and orderly life had nursed their bodies back to health. At this moment, wearing brand new outfits—fine fabric, tailored to accentuate their graceful figures, with red velvet flowers at their temples—every face was set off in radiant spirits.

"Pretty!" ("Liang!")

"Australians really know how to train women, making every one of them look like fairies!"

"Ya, isn't that girl the one who used to work as a chicken over at the Bamboo Basket..."

"Who doesn't know what they used to do."

"Heh, what they did doesn't matter, the key is the Australians took a fancy to them! Once fancied, even chickens and dogs ascend to heaven."

...

These dissonant notes were quickly drowned out by the sky-shaking drum music. The common people scrambled to see these brides. They really had dog-shit luck; women who were once as dirty and lowly as mud were now held so high by Australians, dressed so purely and beautifully! Just that pleated red silk skirt on them, only daughters of wealthy families could wear when getting married. Jealousy, envy, anger... various emotions spread among the onlookers. Yet what did their perceptions have to do with this scene?

The brides all went ashore, and the grooms were guided out of the awning, each finding their own partner. To be honest, this partner was really somewhat strange. Because from the blind date until now, it was actually only the second time meeting. At this moment, the women had undergone meticulous dressing up, dazzling the grooms' eyes in the myriad of flowers; many almost couldn't find their wives, and could only pair up by relying on the numbers on the flower bouquets on both chests.

Husband and wife held hands, speechless opposite each other. Although they were about to become closest kin and spend the rest of their lives together, appearing to have a bellyful of words, they felt the person before them was so strange, not knowing where to start.

Fortunately, there were naturalized cadres like He Xiaoyue around, shouting to organize the teams from time to time, diluting the awkwardness of this chaotic scene.

"Everyone line up according to numbers, prepare for the photo."

Flower beds and colorful arches were set up on Tianzi Wharf, and potted flowers spelled out the words "Guangzhou City's First Collective Wedding." Wooden steps were placed in front of the flower beds, and naturalized cadres ran back and forth directing, making the grooms and brides stand in position according to numbers. This tossing about took more than ten minutes.

"Everyone look at my hand, get ready, everyone smile..."

With the "One, two, three" from the Elder responsible for photography, the camera clicked (Ka-cha), capturing this photo of the unprecedented first collective wedding.

The photo was taken with a professional-grade digital camera using a wide-angle lens. However, limited to the Council of Elders' chemical industry level, for decades this historically significant photo—whether hung in museums, printed in books, or treasured at home by the newlywed couples of that year—was entirely black and white. It wasn't until many years later that colored photos were printed, and the couples in the photos had mostly entered their eighties.

At this moment, the music on the wharf changed again, switching to an out-of-tune "Everything Goes Well" ("Wan Shi Ru Yi"). Fortunately, no one except the Elders could tell; they just felt it was lively and festive. Here, staff were already throwing candies toward the onlookers, attracting children to scramble for them. For a time, voices seethed; the entire Tianzi Wharf was indescribably joyous and festive.

After the photo was taken, they boarded the *Octopus* and the Flower-tailed Barge behind it sequentially under guidance. With a blast of the *Octopus*'s whistle, a pair of paddle wheels turned, water splashing, slowly weighing anchor and sailing toward White Swan Pool (Ba'e Tan).

The route of the flower boat cruise wasn't long, roughly strictly sailing west from Tianzi Wharf along the Pearl River to White Swan Pool, cruising a circle around White Swan Pool, then returning the original way, arriving at the Great World Wharf.

The *Octopus* towed the heavy Flower-tailed Barge, driving slowly west at a speed of less than three kilometers per hour. They didn't sail alone; more than ten painted pleasure boats followed alongside—these boats were provided by the Ziming Building Company, originally confiscated from Guangzhou brothels. At this time, they were also redecorated, full of staff and "sponsors" and their families—all having paid money to "rejoice along," naturally wanting to share some "joyous energy."

Outside these vessels, more than ten steam "Da-Fa" and "Zhong-Fa" patrol boats escorted for protection. Although black smoke rolled, they were majestic. For this grand cruise, the Coast Guard implemented traffic control on the Pearl River waters from White Swan Pool to the Great World Wharf, prohibiting outside vessels from entering. However, this couldn't stump the people who loved watching the fun. Many wealthy and leisurely Guangzhou citizens, either driving their own pleasure boats or hiring Tanka small boats, sailed along with the fleet, watching this liveliness rarely met in a thousand years.
