# Chapter 2032 - Collective Wedding (Part 2)

As commander-in-chief, Fang Fei arrived at the wharf in the early morning hours. The sea of humanity before him—onlookers forming a veritable wall—exceeded all expectations. Zhang Haogu had long counseled, "Never underestimate humanity's appetite for spectacle," yet Fang Fei had scarcely anticipated such numbers descending at once.

His sedan chair pressed forward with considerable difficulty through a passage cleared by National Army soldiers to the signal tower beside the wharf. From the tower's elevation, Fang Fei surveyed the entirety of Tianzi Wharf below. Though the exterior teemed with people at every vantage, inside the security cordon order prevailed.

The *Octopus* and the flower-tailed barge it towed resembled vessels prepared for a beauty pageant parade—festooned not only with flowers but draped liberally in silk and satin. Local craftsmen had assembled the decorations according to Fang Fei's designs. Though the overall effect approximated his vision, material limitations created a certain dissonance. Traditional flower farmers cultivated and sold primarily flowering trees and shrubs, rarely maintaining large quantities of fresh-cut flowers as in the old timeline. Naturally, no large-scale cultivation of garden roses existed here either. The flower boat's artistic conception fell somewhat short of the ideal.

What lacked refinement wasn't merely the passable flower boat. The cacophonous band vibrated his skull at an unusually sharp frequency, distinct even against the general tumult, inducing a splitting headache. Nothing like the folk music he'd imagined!

Awnings sheltered the anxiously waiting grooms on the wharf. All wore formal "Hair clothing"—the standard navy blue "National Suit" most commonly donned by male naturalized employee cadres during peacetime. However, today's formal iterations employed not soft cotton but thickened hemp fabric, lending them a crisp appearance while remaining cheaper and cooler than wool—admirably suited to the current weather. To distinguish their status as grooms, each wore a boutonniere. Compared to the chattering brides surveying their surroundings from the "dragon" boats, the grooms beneath the awning appeared somewhat bashful, holding their breath and feigning composure as they awaited their wives' arrival.

Opposite them stood another awning housing couples attired identically in today's wedding garments. These dozens of pairs were naturalized citizen couples who had married earlier through free courtship. Because their previous weddings had been relatively simple or altogether omitted, they'd registered to participate this time as a "supplementary ceremony." As seasoned spouses, they displayed none of the newcomers' shyness, glancing about with barely suppressed delight and periodically gesturing toward the flower boats moored at the wharf.

The atmosphere proved far more enthusiastic than anticipated, and the festive spirit infected Fang Fei as well. Yet as the wedding's chief planner, his nerves remained taut. Greater scale meant more components, and more components multiplied potential failures—an axiom gleaned from years navigating cultural exhibition companies and orchestrating countless exhibitions, conferences, large-scale events, and weddings.

"Chief! The five dragons are coming!" his secretary whispered.

Fang Fei immediately pivoted toward the indicated direction. Even without binoculars, he discerned five lantern-bedecked "dragon" sampans approaching. For verification's sake, he raised his field glasses, then issued swift orders: "Pause the music," "Ready the firecrackers," "Dragon and lion dance teams stand by." A cascade of commands flowed downward.

As his instructions reached the signal platform, semaphore operators transmitted each directive to every position. Within moments, all stations acknowledged receipt. When the drum music ceased, onlookers seemed to sense something momentous approaching and fell silent. The previously tumultuous wharf quieted abruptly, leaving only the sharp flutter of colorful flags snapping in the breeze.

The dragons gradually neared the shore. Tianzi Wharf had specially cleared several hundred meters of berthing space so the five dragons could dock simultaneously alongside. The sailors, carefully selected from Dabo Shipping, guaranteed first-attempt docking.

Under expert manipulation, the five dragons turned in unison, rotating their broadsides shoreward. At a signal from the tower, the silent wharf erupted with piercing suona notes. Following this eardrum-threatening opening, all wind and percussion instruments commenced simultaneously. Though the melody proved somewhat nondescript, the Elders could roughly identify "Today is a Good Day."

Immediately followed the thunderous detonation of dozens of ten-thousand-character firecracker strings suspended on both sides, punctuated by the deeper percussion of muskets. All firecrackers were specially procured "Floor-Full-Red"—varieties using red paper interiors that, upon explosion, carpeted the ground with crimson fragments. Beautiful and festive, these were luxury goods reserved for wealthy families' wedding celebrations.

Lion and dragon teams on both flanks commenced their dances amid the firecracker barrage. Dragon and lion dancing constituted traditional sports and entertainment for Guangzhou's urban and suburban populace. All eight teams present had volunteered their services, explicitly requesting only meals without monetary compensation. Their purpose was transparent: to "display their skill" before the Australians and all Guangzhou.

Gangplanks bridged the boats to shore. He Xiaoyue disembarked first. Though not formally a professional bridesmaid today, she functioned precisely as one, directing a dozen female employees to assist the brides down the gangplanks.

The crowd surged like ocean waves, boiling instantaneously. The new brides approached! These former outcasts had entered the shelter appearing dark and wan, emaciated by years of degradation and disease. These past months had cured their ailments while regular, orderly living restored their health. Now, adorned in brand-new garments—fine fabric tailored to accentuate graceful figures, red velvet flowers at their temples—every face radiated luminous vitality.

"Beautiful!"

"Australians truly understand women's transformation—they've made every one resemble immortals!"

"Isn't that girl the one who used to work at the Bamboo Basket brothel?"

"Everyone knows what they used to do."

"What they did matters not—the key is the Australians favor them! Once favored, even chickens and dogs ascend to heaven."

These discordant notes quickly drowned beneath the thunderous music. The common people scrambled to observe these brides. What extraordinary fortune—women once dirty and lowly as mud now elevated so high by Australians, dressed purely and beautifully! That pleated red silk skirt alone, only wealthy families' daughters wore when marrying. Jealousy, envy, anger—varied emotions spread among onlookers. Yet what bearing did their perceptions have on this scene?

All brides disembarked, and the grooms emerged from beneath their awning, each seeking his partner. In truth, the pairing felt somewhat strange. From blind date to present constituted merely their second encounter. The women's meticulous preparation dazzled the grooms' eyes amid the profusion of beauty; many could scarcely identify their wives, relying instead on matching numbers affixed to the boutonnières on their chests.

Husband and wife clasped hands, wordless before one another. Though about to become closest kin and spend life together, though possessing bellies full of words, the person before them seemed so unfamiliar they knew not where to begin.

Fortunately, naturalized cadres like He Xiaoyue circulated constantly, shouting organizational instructions that diluted the awkwardness of this chaotic moment.

"Everyone line up by number, prepare for photographs."

Flower beds and colorful arches adorned Tianzi Wharf, potted flowers spelling "Guangzhou City's First Collective Wedding." Wooden steps stood before the flower beds as naturalized cadres rushed about directing, positioning grooms and brides numerically. This arrangement consumed over ten minutes.

"Everyone watch my hand, ready now, everyone smile..."

Following the Elder photographer's count of "One, two, three," the camera clicked, capturing this unprecedented first collective wedding on film.

The photograph employed a professional-grade digital camera with wide-angle lens. However, limited by the Council of Elders' chemical industry capabilities, this historically significant image—whether displayed in museums, printed in books, or treasured at home by that year's newlywed couples—remained entirely monochrome for decades. Only many years hence were colored prints produced, by which time the couples depicted had mostly entered their eighties.

The wharf music shifted again, transitioning to a discordant rendition of "Everything Goes Well." Fortunately, none save the Elders could distinguish the tune; they simply felt it lively and festive. Staff commenced throwing candies toward onlookers, attracting scrambling children. Voices surged; Tianzi Wharf achieved indescribable joy and festivity.

After photography concluded, couples boarded the *Octopus* and the flower-tailed barge sequentially under guidance. With a blast from the *Octopus*'s whistle, paired paddle wheels churned, water splashing, slowly weighing anchor and steering toward White Swan Pool.

The flower boat cruise route proved manageable—sailing strictly west from Tianzi Wharf along the Pearl River to White Swan Pool, circling the pool, then returning via the original route to Great World Wharf.

The *Octopus*, towing its heavy flower-tailed barge, proceeded westward at less than three kilometers per hour. They didn't sail alone; over ten painted pleasure boats accompanied them—vessels provided by the Ziming Building Company, originally confiscated from Guangzhou brothels. Freshly redecorated, they brimmed with staff and "sponsors" with families—all having paid to "rejoice along," naturally desiring to share the "joyous energy."

Beyond these vessels, over ten steam patrol boats—"Da-Fa" and "Zhong-Fa" class—provided escort protection. Though billowing black smoke, they cut majestic figures. For this grand cruise, the Coast Guard implemented traffic control on Pearl River waters from White Swan Pool to Great World Wharf, prohibiting outside vessels from entering. Yet this couldn't stump spectacle-loving citizens. Many leisured Guangzhou residents, commanding their own pleasure boats or hiring Tanka craft, sailed alongside the fleet, witnessing this once-in-a-millennium event.
