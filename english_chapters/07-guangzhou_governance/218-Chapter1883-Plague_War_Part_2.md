# Chapter 1883 - Plague War (Part 2)

## Plague War (Part 2)

To satisfy the requirement for comprehensive surveillance of the urban area and adjacent suburbs, at least five to six hundred quarantine personnel would be needed. For the military, this was too heavy a burden.

The garrison in Guangzhou was already very limited. If not for the Pearl River Detachment of the Navy having its base just outside the city, with large numbers of rotating sailors stationed there, Guangzhou would practically feel like an "empty city gambit."

Troops could be used for security duties like martial law and control, but to continuously assign large numbers of personnel for epidemic prevention would be beyond their capacity.

As for recruiting through civil service examinations—though the Cadre Department had given Guangzhou the authority to recruit local civil servants independently, recruiting four or five hundred cadres for the health department at once was absurd.

It was actually Lin Baiguang who had an idea. He proposed using the former Ming soldiers currently undergoing training on Hong Kong Island.

After Guangzhou's liberation, all Ming troops in Guangzhou Prefecture—whether the "operating soldiers" from local military households or the recruited camp soldiers—had all been sent to Hong Kong Island for training. Not just them, but Ming officers and soldiers who had surrendered or been captured throughout the entire Guangdong Liberation Campaign had also been sent to Hong Kong for screening and training.

"These soldier ruffians might not be capable of getting things done, but they're first-rate at tormenting common people..." Lin Motian was already shaking his head.

"No, my suggestion is to use soldiers from local military households," Lin Baiguang said.

These military household soldiers, all being local-born with their families also local, were different from the unattached "guest army" camp soldiers from elsewhere. They didn't dare be too unscrupulous, and their misconduct was comparatively less.

"...They're mostly locals, familiar with local conditions, can speak Cantonese—much more convenient for communication than us. With their families mostly in and around Guangzhou city, they have to do whatever we tell them. They have no choice but to follow the rules!" Lin Baiguang said.

Lin Motian thought this was also a viable approach, and these men had been in Hong Kong since the beginning of the year, so they couldn't possibly have been infected with plague. Using them would be reassuring.

For ease of command and funding, with Liu Xiang's approval and after reporting to Lingao, the Epidemic Prevention Battalion directly under the Guangdong Brigade of the National Army was established using these soldiers as its foundation. To "strengthen leadership," fifty sergeants and soldiers were also transferred from the National Army to serve as squad and section leaders for the various companies and platoons.

Establishing the Epidemic Prevention Battalion took only three days. On the morning of the third day, the newly formed battalion proceeded to the Wanshou Palace Training Center, where Lin Motian personally taught the courses.

Using quarantine inspectors with no medical knowledge background would inevitably affect the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis rates during plague case screening. Therefore, to ensure quarantine quality, he personally ran the relevant training classes. Besides teaching the Epidemic Prevention Battalion, he was also prepared to tirelessly emphasize the necessity of quarantine and isolation to frontline administrative personnel and police. As for their isolation measures, he currently couldn't produce very effective methods—all he could guarantee was that each frontline worker would have a mask to wear. Better than nothing.

Normally, protective measures for plague prevention required full-body isolation suits, plus goggles. They had some of these, but they could only be distributed to frontline workers who needed direct contact with patients and infected corpses and objects.

A maritime quarantine zone was established on Changzhou Island. All ships coming from the north had to undergo ten days of mandatory quarantine isolation at the quarantine berths on Changzhou Island. Only after quarantine could they proceed to Guangzhou to unload cargo and disembark. All fur cargo was prohibited from unloading in Guangzhou and had to be unloaded at quarantine warehouses on Changzhou Island. Anyone caught secretly unloading in Guangzhou would be dealt with as a plague ship—vessel and cargo to be burned on the spot.

After much hesitation, Lin Motian still didn't request a full lockdown. Since pneumonic plague hadn't appeared yet, plague transmission was still at a relatively slow stage. The policies already issued would inevitably affect commodity circulation to some extent, and full lockdown would require more quarantine personnel and troops. With every department short-handed, one health department alone couldn't achieve population movement lockdown even if it wanted to.

Unfavorable rumors about him had already begun circulating among the Elders. It was said that some Elder had said privately: "Making a mountain out of a molehill! When has Guangzhou not had a few infectious diseases each year? It's gotten by just fine. I think he's deliberately using a few patients to make a big fuss, as a stepping stone for his own promotion!"

Lin Motian placed his lockdown request back on his desk:

"I hope this thing won't be needed for a while—no, I hope it will never be needed." He looked out the window at the quarantine inspectors wearing red armbands, silently sighing in his heart.

Lai Xiao stood by the ship's railing, staring at the increasingly gloomy sky and the roiling river water, calculating in his mind.

He had been contemplating escape for a long time, but now the thought of "running away" was growing ever stronger.

At the beginning of being taken in, Lai Xiao had still harbored the idea of taking things as they came. Though being a coolie for the Australians wasn't exactly good fortune, at least there was a bowl of rice to eat—that counted as a way to survive. He could hang around for a while and see how things went before making other plans. But ever since that old man had suddenly collapsed on the dock and was later said to have "died of sudden illness," the situation had suddenly changed.

Their group hadn't been able to leave. They had waited on the dock for an entire day. The ship that had originally berthed had hurriedly weighed anchor and departed. Then another squad of "National Army" arrived, surrounding the dock three layers deep—not a single person allowed in or out.

The dock, originally noisy and busy, had suddenly become eerily quiet. Besides the beggars waiting to board the ship, there were only a few Fake-Born responsible for guarding and escorting them. Though they tried hard to maintain composure, from their hasty donning of those things called face masks and their panicked, uneasy expressions, Lai Xiao knew something major had happened here!

With several years of begging experience, it wasn't hard for Lai Xiao to guess that the old man who had dropped dead must have caught a "seasonal sickness." This wasn't uncommon among beggars. From the humid spring season through the entire summer and autumn, old, weak, sick, and disabled beggars suddenly dying from various "seasonal sicknesses" was commonplace.

But the Baldy Bandits were treating this "seasonal sickness" so seriously—sealing off the dock, equipping the Fake-Born with face masks. He knew about those things—the Baldy Bandits' doctors all wore them, supposedly for "epidemic prevention."

This was an epidemic spreading! Lai Xiao's scalp immediately prickled with terror.

He knew a thing or two about the horrors of epidemics. Lingao had had smallpox outbreaks too. During his begging in Guangzhou, when beggars would "chat" with each other, those who had witnessed epidemics had spoken of the terror—"nine out of ten houses emptied," "a thousand li without a soul." In his years in Guangzhou, he had also witnessed epidemics each year, killing hundreds or thousands at a time. Beggars were often called to work as corpse carriers—this work allowed one to strip valuables and clothing from the dead, and many beggars were willing to do it. Every year, quite a few died from contracting disease while moving corpses.

Had he also been infected? Lai Xiao was on edge with anxiety. When they were finally herded onto the ship, a rumor had already begun circulating among the crowd: everyone at the dock that day—whether beggars like them or the Fake-Born—would be sent to a small island to "wait for death," to prevent them from spreading the plague to others. The evidence was that the Fake-Born who had been supervising them at the dock had also boarded the ship.

"Damn those Baldy Bandits!" Lai Xiao cursed silently. "May they all get the plague and die clean!"

He thought of how he had originally been doing just fine at the Gou family estate, serving as an attendant to the second young master—not worrying about food or clothing. When going out, he was imposing and impressive. Whether flirting with maidservants or the wives and daughters of tenant farmers and laborers, no one dared say a word against him. Even in the county town, he was a swaggering bully—eating a watermelon without paying.

Who could have imagined he would end up like this! Not only could he not even remain a beggar, but he was about to be sent to a deserted island to "wait for death."

He couldn't just sit and wait for doom—he had to run!

The river was wide here, but Lai Xiao prided himself on his excellent swimming skills. He could move freely in the bay, let alone the Pearl River, which was much calmer than the ocean!

As long as he could climb out of the cargo hold and jump into the river, there was no way the Fake-Born could catch him.

Lai Xiao secretly surveyed his surroundings. The vessel transporting them was a so-called "Australian barge." It wasn't very large, with over a hundred beggars crammed into the open cargo hold. The hold's walls were over a man's height, with Fake-Born on guard on the decks at both bow and stern. From their elevated position, they could clearly see every move in the hold. Sneaking up there to jump in the river was impossible—one shot from those Fake-Born would create a transparent hole right through him.

The sky was overcast. From afar came rumbling thunder. The beggars on the ship involuntarily hunched their shoulders. In the distance, lightning flickered faintly at the edges of the dark clouds. The wind on the river began picking up, turning cool and chilly.

A big storm was about to hit. People on the barge began to stir. As the wind strengthened, the vessel began to pitch.

The Fake-Born standing guard on the fore and aft decks gripped their rifles tightly, constantly shouting: "Don't move! Don't move! Everybody squat down!"

A gust of wind passed, and suddenly a drop of water struck Lai Xiao's head. Then he heard a rapid pattering sound. Almost simultaneously with the lightning flashing overhead, thunder seemed to explode right by his ears. At the same moment, straight torrents of rain came pouring down from sky to earth. He couldn't make out individual streams—just sheets, waves of rain crashing onto the river surface. The river was instantly pocked with countless ripples, swallowed immediately by the churning waves.

In mere moments, countless waterfalls cascaded down from the hold's walls, drenching everyone inside from head to toe. Lai Xiao crouched by the wall, tensely watching the sky. By now heaven and earth had merged together, indistinguishable. Rivers poured from above while rivers flowed across the ground—dim and murky, yet sometimes bright and white. A world made entirely of water.

The Fake-Born on the ship were also caught off guard by this downpour. Some rushed to get rain gear, others fumbled with their rain capes that had been blown askew by the wind, tying cords to their conical hats. In that brief moment of chaos when they had no time to worry about the cargo hold, Lai Xiao had already scrambled up the ship's side using both hands and feet, stepping on a beggar who had collapsed in the bottom of the hold. A peal of thunder rolled overhead, and he leaped into the turbid, roiling waters of the Pearl River.
