# Chapter 1732: Take Down

"Fifteen or sixteen hundred?" Liu Xiang was stunned. This modest prefectural yamen harbored over a thousand runners! And that didn't even include the two counties of Nanhai and Panyu. Adding them together, Guangzhou City had at least three thousand clerks and runners.

By modern standards, three thousand officials for a city of several hundred thousand would constitute a streamlined organization—a light burden on the populace. The problem was that in classical China's hierarchy, officials were valued far above clerks. Though everyone "ate imperial grain," actual officials consumed the vast majority, leaving not even dregs for the clerks. Whether it was the seven taels and two mace annually for authorized Six Departments clerks, or the three taels and six mace for establishment runners, or the mere six dou of rice monthly for the lowest ranks—none of it was enough to live on. And the overwhelming majority received nothing at all. So these three thousand-plus souls had to feed themselves by other means.

Since they couldn't serve the public on empty stomachs, and since they embodied government power at the grassroots level, it was only natural they would exploit their positions. The old regime had tacitly permitted this for centuries.

One could easily imagine the devastation these three thousand "public servants" inflicted on the people and the city's economy. Liu Xiang surveyed the black crowd below. Without "gun barrels" in hand and a ready-made cadre team to rely on, any outsider official sent here would be lucky not to be sold by these clerks—sold and left thanking them for the privilege.

He scanned the courtyard slowly for more than a minute. Silence hung heavy, broken only by wind rustling leaves. Finally, he spoke: "Since you have all forsaken darkness for light and pledged loyalty to the Senate, I have words for you. Remember them well."

The crowd chanted in unison: "Please instruct us, Your Excellency!"

"I understand that serving here is not easy," Liu Xiang said. "The wages the Great Ming provides cannot support a family—and most of you don't even receive those meager wages. As for the officials, they regard you as slaves and lowly servants. All the administrative affairs said to be handled by the official lords are actually done by your hands."

The crowd's expressions shifted subtly. Historically, when officials took office, there was always a speech—"strictly prohibiting corruption," expressing determination to "serve the country and people," admonishing clerks to "serve with sincerity" and "not practice fraud." Empty words no one took seriously. But this Lord Liu sang a different tune.

Upon reflection, his words acknowledged their work and understood their difficulties. The clerks muttered to themselves: what was this Lord Liu really after?

Liu Xiang's tone changed. "Naturally, there have never been saints who serve the public on empty stomachs, and neither are you. I have heard of the great profits involved in being clerks. These are things of the past. My Senate is magnanimous and benevolent—'punishing the chief evils, but not investigating the coerced.' As long as there is no great public anger, past matters will not be pursued..."

A stir rippled through the crowd. Though these words were a "reassurance pill," they were also a death warrant. The quick-witted understood immediately: this Australian lord intended to "kill the chicken to scare the monkey," using human heads to deter the clerks while winning public goodwill. Several faces went instantly pale.

Liu Xiang was satisfied with the effect. He already had an arrest list prepared by the City Operation Department—more than a hundred names. Of the top ten, only four had appeared for roll call. Their noses were sharp indeed.

"Meng Gongchang!" he suddenly shouted.

The entire courtyard went silent. Meng Gongchang was a fast-class runner. Though he held "regular" status, he was nobody of consequence.

Meng Gongchang trembled from head to toe. By no measure could he be considered a "chief evil." Could Lord Liu want to use him as the "chicken"? Though terrified, he dared not fail to answer. Supporting his shaking legs, he stepped out and walked to the eaves, crossed his hands in salute, and said: "This lowly one is here."

"Can you read?"

"This lowly one can read."

Liu Xiang threw down a piece of paper. "Read!"

Meng Gongchang picked it up with trembling hands and unfolded it. A list—twenty or thirty names densely written. Some he knew, some were strangers. Among those he recognized were fast-class and soap-class runners, both regulars and unregistered "white members." Unable to guess the pattern, he dared not delay and read aloud:

"Wu Duoduo! Zhao Xian! Ai Fan!"...

Those whose names were called came trembling one by one to stand beneath the eaves and pay respects. Liu Xiang waved his hand. "No need for respects. Stand aside!"

When finished, including Meng Gongchang himself, thirty people lined up under the steps. Their hearts hammered; their bodies shook like sieves. None were important figures—fitting targets for "chicken."

Liu Xiang nodded and addressed Meng Gongchang: "I hereby appoint you Captain of the Detective Brigade of the Guangzhou Special City Police Bureau. These men are your subordinates!"

Meng Gongchang had closed his eyes awaiting death. Now, hearing Lord Liu issue an on-the-spot appointment as "Captain"—regardless of how important the rank was—at least his life was safe. Warmth flooded through him like hot wine on a winter's coldest day. He dropped to his knees with a thump, voice trembling: "Many, many thanks for Your Excellency's favor!" He kowtowed three times with audible force.

The remaining twenty-nine came to their senses, realized they were now "in the Emperor's favor," and knelt to kowtow in unison.

"All right! Our Senate doesn't encourage kowtowing and greeting." Liu Xiang waved his hand. "Since you are now the Captain of the Detective Brigade, catching rebels is your duty! I have a list here—catch people by name! Mister Lü, read!"

"Yes!" Meng Gongchang was now brimming with energy and turned to stand beneath the eaves.

Lü Yizhong hurried forward and took the list. He had already guessed Liu Xiang intended to make arrests in court—killing the chicken to scare the monkey. Using these men required first demonstrating power. He quickly unfolded the list, drew a deep breath to gather himself, eager to make a good impression on Chief Liu.

"Zhen... Zhen... Hao... Ren..." Unexpectedly, Lü Yizhong stammered on the first name. His shock nearly froze him mid-sentence.

The clerks assembled began murmuring.

Zhen Haoren was the clerk of the Household Department of Guangzhou Prefecture. Though merely a small authorized scribe, he was one of the most powerful people in Guangzhou City. As head of the Household Department scribes, the tax guidelines for all of Guangzhou Prefecture rested in his hands. Every magistrate across fifteen counties and one prefecture, down to the lowliest grain runner, watched his every breath. Though the Prefect Lord could assume airs of "Your Excellency" in public, in private he remained polite to Zhen Haoren. Local gentry dared not slight him too openly. A two-finger-wide slip of paper from him carried more weight than a magistrate's order.

Lü Yizhong had never expected the first arrest would target this "Standing Prefect." He had served long enough in officialdom to encounter many obstinate, incorruptible ministers unafraid of power. But truly no one dared confront the clerks directly—especially a Household Scribe controlling financial and grain tax authority. When encountering a clean and capable official, such a man would at most temporarily restrain himself. The official would likewise quit while ahead, never pushing to the end.

Zhen Haoren hadn't come to the yamen to work for a long time, preferring to direct his disciples and grand-disciples from home or teahouses. He was certain even these "hair-shorn thieves" would need him, so he hadn't bothered attending roll call at all.

Meng Gongchang was also startled. In the eyes of these clerks, Grand Master Zhen was a figure in the clouds—the scribes of the Six Departments were "officials," a level above runners like himself. Let alone the head of the most important department!

But Grand Master Zhen was absent. Meng Gongchang quickly reported: "Your Excellency, Zhen Haoren has not arrived! Please grant a warrant and fire token—this lowly one will arrest him now."

"Go quickly!"

Meng Gongchang dared not delay and immediately took several brothers with him. Meanwhile, Lü Yizhong read the second name:

"Bi Wusu!"

Another commotion swept through the crowd. If Zhen Haoren was the "Standing Prefect," Bi Wusu was the "Sitting Tai Sui"—head of the Fast Class of Guangzhou Prefecture. This position didn't even count as a clerk; he was a genuine runner. But his power rivaled Zhen Haoren's.

Beneath him swarmed countless unregistered enforcers. Every petty criminal in the city answered to his greeting, and any "immortal" from outside looking to operate in this one prefecture and two counties couldn't think of opening for business without paying sufficient tribute first. As for ordinary people—they were treated as grass.

Lin Baiguang had collected extensive materials on him—though "materials" hardly described what was common knowledge throughout Guangzhou. He had more than a dozen lives on his hands. Though no one knew the exact size of his fortune, estimates put his annual "customary silver" at several thousand taels. His family property surely exceeded a hundred thousand.

Zhao Xian and Ai Fan were both Fast Class runners or white members. Hearing that Head Bi was to be arrested, they were all shaken. Normally, they didn't even have opportunities to speak with Bi Wusu—he rarely came to the yamen, always working through his disciples and grand-disciples. During festivals and birthdays, everyone would go together to kowtow and present gifts. If Head Bi spoke a few words and showed a smile, it was considered great honor.

Now that the superior official had ordered his arrest, they couldn't disobey. Pulling chains in hand, they approached Bi Wusu.

Zhao Xian bowed with a forced smile. "Master Bi! Only official business—please bear with us..."

Bi Wusu had come in person today for roll call—unlike Zhen Haoren, he had no secret family learning to rely on, so he had been particularly unctuous. Hearing Liu Xiang wanted him arrested for interrogation, panic flashed across his face. But his accumulated prestige remained. With a wave of his hand, Zhao Xian and the others hesitated to use force.

Bi Wusu forced himself calm, cupped his hands toward the dais, and sneered: "What has this lowly one done to offend Your Excellency? Though I am no saint, I have kept peace in Guangzhou all these years—even petty thieves dare not cause trouble. Please reconsider, Your Excellency!"
