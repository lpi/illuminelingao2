# Chapter 1732: Take Down

"Fifteen or sixteen hundred people?" Liu Xiang was startled. This small prefectural yamen actually had over a thousand runners! And this didn't even count the two counties of Nanhai and Panyu. If all were added up, there were at least three thousand clerks and runners in Guangzhou City.

According to modern standards, a city like Guangzhou with a population of several hundred thousand having three thousand "officials" could be called a streamlined organization. The burden on the people shouldn't be heavy. The problem was that in the classical society of China, officials were valued over clerks. Although they all ate "imperial grain," officials ate the vast majority of it, leaving not even "soup" for the clerks. Whether it was the seven taels and two mace per year for the authorized clerks of the Six Departments, or the three taels and six mace for the "establishment" runners, or even the six dou of rice per month for the lesser ones. In fact, it wasn't enough to live on, let alone the vast majority who had no income at all. So these three thousand-plus people, every single one of them, had to find food for themselves.

Since these three thousand-plus people couldn't serve the public on an empty stomach, and they were the embodiment of government power at the grassroots level, it was natural for them to use their power to scrape the ground and extort money. The old-style government actually tacitly allowed this.

One could imagine how severe the harm caused by these three thousand-plus "public servants" was to the people and the city's economy. Liu Xiang looked at the black crowd below. If he didn't hold the "gun barrel" and have a ready-made cadre administrative team to rely on, an outsider official coming here to hold office would be lucky not to be sold by the clerks and still help them count the money.

He slowly scanned the clerks in the courtyard for more than a minute. The courtyard was solemn, with only the sound of wind blowing leaves. After a long while, he said: "Since you all have forsaken darkness for light and pledged loyalty to the Senate, I have some words to say. I hope you will remember them well."

The people below immediately chanted in unison: "Please instruct us, Your Excellency!"

Liu Xiang said: "I know that it is not easy for you to serve: the wage silver given by the Great Ming is so small that it cannot support a family—most people don't even have this little wage silver; as for the officials, they regard you as slaves and lowly servants; the large and small administrative affairs in this yamen are said to be done by the official lords, but in fact, they are all your handiwork."

The expressions on the crowd's faces changed slightly: historically, when officials took office, there would always be a speech, nothing more than "strictly prohibiting malpractice and corruption," expressing the determination to "serve the country and the people," and inevitably "admonishing" the clerks to "serve with sincerity" and "not to practice fraud," etc. In reality, these were all official articles, and no one took them seriously. But when this Lord Liu opened his mouth, he spoke in a different tune.

Upon careful reflection, it was an affirmation of their work and also understanding of their "difficulties." The clerks couldn't help but mutter secretly, what medicine is this Lord Liu selling in his gourd?

Liu Xiang changed the subject: "Naturally, there have never been saints in the world who serve the public on an empty stomach, and neither are you. As clerks, I have heard of the great profits involved. These are all things of the past. My Senate is magnanimous and benevolent, 'punishing the chief evils, but not investigating the coerced.' As long as there is no great public anger, past things will not be pursued..."

The crowd suddenly stirred. Although these words were a "reassurance pill," they were also a "death warrant." Those with quick minds already understood that this Australian lord wanted to "kill the chicken to scare the monkey," using human heads to deter the clerks and buy the goodwill of the people. Several people's faces instantly turned pale.

Liu Xiang was very satisfied with this effect. In fact, he already had an arrest list prepared by the City Operation Department in his hand, with more than a hundred people on it. Of the top ten, only four came to answer the roll call—it seemed their noses were quite sharp!

He suddenly shouted: "Meng Gongchang!"

With this shout, the entire yamen courtyard was instantly silent. Meng Gongchang was a fast-class runner. Although he was a "regular," he was not a famous figure.

Meng Gongchang trembled all over, thinking that he could not be considered a "chief evil" by any means. Could this Lord Liu want to use him as the "chicken" to scare the monkeys? Although afraid, he dared not fail to answer, so he had to step out, barely supporting his trembling legs to walk to the eaves, crossed his hands in salute, and said: "This lowly one is here."

"Can you read?"

"This lowly one can read."

Liu Xiang threw down a piece of paper: "Read!"

Meng Gongchang picked up the paper tremblingly and unfolded it. It was a list with twenty or thirty names densely written on it. Some he knew, some were strangers. Among those he knew, there were fast-class runners and soap-class runners; there were "regulars" and "white members." He couldn't help but be secretly suspicious. He didn't dare to delay and read aloud:

"Wu Duoduo!", "Zhao Xian!", "Ai Fan!"...

Those whose names were called came trembling one by one to stand under the eaves to pay respects. Liu Xiang waved his hand: "No need to pay respects, stand aside!"

When the names were finished, including Meng Gongchang himself, a total of thirty people lined up under the steps. Their hearts were anxious, and their bodies shook like sieves—none of them were important figures among the runners, fitting the standard of being "chickens" very well.

Liu Xiang nodded and said to Meng Gongchang: "I now appoint you as the Captain of the Detective Brigade of the Guangzhou Special City Police Bureau. These people count as your subordinates!"

Meng Gongchang originally had closed his eyes waiting for death. Now suddenly hearing Lord Liu issue an order on the spot appointing him as a "Captain," leaving aside whether the official rank was big or small, at least his life was safe. He felt like he had drunk a cup of hot wine in the coldest days of winter, warm from feet to head. He knelt down with a thump and said tremblingly: "Many, many thanks for Your Excellency's cultivation!" He kowtowed three times loudly.

The remaining twenty-nine people also came to their senses, knowing that they were now "in the Emperor's favor," and knelt down and kowtowed together.

"All right! Our Senate doesn't encourage kowtowing and greeting," Liu Xiang waved his hand and said, "Since you are already the Captain of the Detective Brigade, catching rebels is your duty! I have a list here, catch people by name! Mister Lü, read!"

"Yes!" Meng Gongchang was now full of energy, turning back to stand under the eaves.

Lü Yizhong hurried forward a few steps and took the list—he had already guessed that Liu Xiang wanted to arrest people in court. To kill the chicken to scare the monkey, if he wanted to use these people, it was impossible without "showing power." Lü Yizhong quickly unfolded the list, took a deep breath, gathered his energy, and wanted to leave a good impression on Chief Liu.

"Zhen... Zhen... Hao... Ren..." Unexpectedly, Lü Yizhong stuttered on the first name. He was so surprised he almost couldn't continue reading.

The clerks present were also in a commotion.

Zhen Haoren was the clerk of the Household Department of Guangzhou Prefecture. Although he was only a small authorized scribe, he was one of the most powerful people in Guangzhou City. As the head of the scribes of the Household Department of Guangzhou Prefecture, the tax guidelines of the entire Guangzhou Prefecture were in his hands. From the magistrates of the fifteen counties and one prefecture up to the grain runners down, everyone had to look at his breath. Although the Prefect Lord could put on the official air of "Your Excellency" in public, he was still polite to him in private. The local gentry dared not brush his face too much. A slip of paper two fingers wide from him was actually more effective than the magistrate's order.

Lü Yizhong never expected that the first name to be arrested would be this "Standing Prefect." He had been in officialdom for a long time and had seen many "obstinate ministers," incorruptible and unafraid of powerful people. But really no one dared to get real with the clerks, especially this Household Scribe who controlled the financial and grain tax power. When encountering an official who was incorruptible and capable, at most he would restrain his edge and hibernate temporarily. The superior official would also quit while he was ahead and would never pursue to the end.

Zhen Haoren hadn't come to the yamen to work for a long time, directing his disciples and grand-disciples to handle affairs and play with power at home or in teahouses. He was certain that even if the Hair-shorn thieves sat on the throne, they wouldn't be able to do without him, so he didn't come to the roll call at all this time.

Meng Gongchang was also startled. In the eyes of these clerks, Grand Master Zhen was a figure in the clouds—the scribes of the Six Departments were "officials" (Li), a level higher than their kind of "runners" (Xu), let alone he was the head of the Household Department scribes, the most important of the Six Departments!

However, Grand Master Zhen was not present at all today. He hurriedly reported back: "Reporting to Your Excellency, Zhen Haoren has not arrived! Please grant a warrant and fire token, this lowly one will go and arrest him now."

"Go quickly!"

Meng Gongchang dared not delay and immediately took a few brothers with him. Here Lü Yizhong read out the second name:

"Bi Wusu!"

The crowd was in another commotion. If Zhen Haoren was the "Standing Prefect," Bi Wusu was the "Sitting Tai Sui"—the head of the Fast Class of Guangzhou Prefecture. This position didn't even count as an "official" (Li); he was a genuine "runner" (Xu). But his power was not much less than Zhen Haoren's.

He had the most white member claws under him. Not only did the city foxes and society rats in the city all have to listen to his greeting, but various "immortals" coming from outside to make a fortune in the city also couldn't think of opening business on the territory of this one prefecture and two counties without giving enough tribute. As for ordinary people, they were regarded as grass.

Lin Baiguang had collected a lot of his black materials—in fact, they couldn't count as black materials at all. Many evil deeds were already known to everyone in Guangzhou City. He had more than a dozen human lives on his hands alone. Although no one knew the specific number of wealth accumulated in his family, someone estimated that his annual "customary silver" reached several thousand taels. His family property was at least over a hundred thousand.

Zhao Xian and Ai Fan were both Fast Class runners or white members. Hearing that Head Bi was to be arrested, they were all startled. Usually, they didn't even have the chance to talk to Bi Wusu—he rarely came to the yamen, and it was always his disciples and grand-disciples who gave orders. During festivals or birthdays, everyone went to kowtow and give gifts together. If Head Bi said a few words to them and had a smiling face, it was a great honor.

Now that the superior official called for arrest, they naturally couldn't disobey orders. Immediately pulling the chains in their hands, they walked towards Bi Wusu.

Zhao Xian bowed with a fake smile and said, "Master Bi! Only official business, please bear with us..."

Bi Wusu came to answer the roll call personally today—unlike Zhen Haoren who had family secret learning to rely on, so he was particularly flattering. Hearing Liu Xiang wanted to arrest and interrogate him, he couldn't help but panic. After all, his accumulated prestige was still there. With a wave of his hand, Zhao Xian and others dared not arrest him by force.

Bi Wusu forced himself to be calm, cupped his hands upwards and sneered: "What has this lowly one done to offend Your Excellency that you want to operate on me? Although this lowly one is not a saint, I have kept the peace in Guangzhou for these years, and petty thieves dare not cause trouble. Please think twice, Your Excellency!"
