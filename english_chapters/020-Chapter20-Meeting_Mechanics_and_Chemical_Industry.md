# Chapter 20 - Meeting Mechanics and Chemical Industry

Chapter 20 Meeting - Mechanics and Chemical Industry

The topic turned to the machinery manufacturing industry. This was President Wen's profession. The discussion mainly revolved around what equipment to carry. Zhan Wuya had already contributed a small machinery factory, and he reported the types of these equipments.

"Can these equipments produce various special machines we need? Um, for example, boilers?"

"Theoretically, completely possible. Take my small factory as an example. Not much equipment, but as long as there are suitable materials, general mechanical equipment can be made for you. Of course, my factory mainly processes various parts for others and has never made complex complete sets of machinery. There are also some small parts we generally don't make," Zhan Wuya scratched his head, not quite used to standing on the stage accepting consultation, "For example, various standard parts, oh-" he realized many people didn't know what standard parts were, so he explained, "They are mechanical parts used for fastening connections, such as screws, bolts, washers. It's best to use specialized equipment to manufacture them."

"Of course, it's also possible to manufacture these, just a bit troublesome. We can make some specialized machines to manufacture these standard parts.

"There are also things like various castings, gears, bearings, etc. This is not something a small machinery factory like ours can manufacture. It involves specialized equipment, and some also need heat treatment and electroplating. I don't understand this very well. Generally, we just buy ready-made parts directly, or ask someone to process them."

"But gears and bearings are very useful. Not being able to manufacture them means the equipment manufacturing industry is hopeless."

"Then bring specialized equipment. For gears, hobbing machines can be used. Bearings are more difficult..."

"A complete set of bearing factory equipment, I'm afraid it will cost over ten million."

"Over ten million is a small matter. Where do you find so many skilled workers to do it?"

"Still need to start with indigenous methods. Try to base on existing equipment usage. Investing in all professional equipment is too big."

"Materials need heat treatment furnaces. Bearing cages and installing balls can be manual. Punch presses can be used for fixing."

...

Then entered a relatively complex discussion stage. After a while of muttering, the discussion of the Industrial Group subsided. Probably a consensus was reached on the manufacturing methods and equipment for gears and bearings. Someone began to write a list. Xiao Zishan guessed it might be something like an equipment list.

Wen Desi spoke at this time: "I propose, in order to unify accessories, shearing machines and bending machines don't need to be brought. A few more punch presses can replace them. Bring as many cutting tools and grinding wheels as possible. In addition, the machinery factory doesn't have milling machines and heat treatment furnaces. These need to be brought."

"If we want to be as complete as possible, we also need broaching machines and boring machines. In addition, the number of lathes should be more." Jiang Ye, who had been a lathe worker for eight years, spoke, "After all, lathes are the most basic machining equipment."

"How about preparing 8 lathes?"

"Too few, 12. This thing is very useful."

"What about forging presses? This can't be missing either."

...

While the discussion on mechanics was in full swing, many people began to yawn. But restricted by the rule that they couldn't leave before the topic ended, they began small group discussions within their own groups. For a time, the conference room was full of buzzing sounds.

Wang Luobin suddenly stood up without asking for the host's opinion - these mechanics in the Industrial Group completely ignored the meeting host - "We also need a small foundry. This cannot be forgotten. And later we need to build engines, this is a necessary condition. Speaking of which, single-cylinder diesel engines are simply universal machines: can plow fields and transplant rice seedlings in the fields, can drive boats in the water, can generate electricity on the mountains, can transport people and pull goods on the road."

"Small engines are not a big problem. Ordinary agricultural single-cylinder engines just use cast iron. HT250 is fine: good shock absorption; good casting fluidity for molding. Easy to cut during processing."

"Speaking of casting, I think of the mold opening problem in manufacturing. This is a professional trade. Having equipment doesn't let you make good products, must have molds. The equipment required by the modern mold industry is too defiant: 3D modeling, electrical discharge machining... This matter is not easy to handle."

"Not that exaggerated. You are talking about now. In the past, process designers designed and drew mold drawings, then machined parts, and finally fitters assembled them - the level of fitters is very important."

...

Slowly the discussion on mechanics subsided. The Industrial Group used quite a lot of paper. It seemed they had some confidence. Wen Desi saw Engineer Wang writing furiously there with great interest, and couldn't help worrying whether this purchase list would be too long.

"I am Ji Situi." A man with a full beard stood up. Although having a full beard, his face shape was actually a baby face, "I represent the Chemical Industry Group to express strong protest." He emphasized the tone when saying the three words "Chemical Industry Group", "Chemical industry is a very important industrial category. How can you indiscriminately classify it into the Industrial Group? They are all doing mechanics, completely unrelated to us!"

"Regarding the grouping issue, discuss later. First talk about your views on chemical industry."

"Three acids and two alkalis. Our goal is to solve the production of these things.

"I'll first popularize basic chemical knowledge. The chemical industry we are going to talk about here belongs to heavy chemical industry, which is the foundation of all chemical industries."

This time it was the turn of the personnel in mechanics to yawn, but most people still watched his speech with interest.

"Chemical industry is an industry with the strongest multi-compatibility in all industrial fields. The products of chemical industry themselves are rarely terminal products. These products are mainly utilized by other industrial sectors. For example: sulfuric acid is for fertilizer industry, soda ash is for glass manufacturing, synthetic ammonia is for explosives and fertilizer industry, etc. As long as we can solve the manufacturing of these basic heavy chemical products, we can solve many material manufacturing problems.

"Do you know how much you rely on chemical industry in life? You don't know, so you put chemical industry and mechanics together!" He shook his head, "Tragedy!"

"Don't be so emotional. Talk about chemical industry matter-of-factly."

"Our basic chemical equipment needs a set of synthetic ammonia and combined soda production system and a set of coking chemical system. These two sets of equipment can roughly meet our basic needs, especially synthetic ammonia equipment."

"What is coking equipment?"

"Coke oven?"

"No, simply put, it is a combined manufacturing equipment that uses coal tar to manufacture various chemical products. Can manufacture sulfuric acid, phenol, TNT, dyes, by the way, and sulfonamides."

"Sulfonamides are very useful. This way we have antibiotics."

"Of course this output is not very high, but generally it's enough."

"What about synthetic ammonia, making fertilizer?"

"Extremely useful to us. Simply put, without synthetic ammonia, we can't produce nitric acid.

"Without nitric acid, we can't produce explosives.

"Of course there is also the fertilizer industry, which relies even more on synthetic ammonia."

"Besides complete sets of equipment, we also need to prepare some spare chemical equipment: such as comprehensive towers, absorption towers, decarbonization towers, rectification towers, saturated hot water towers, various reactors, pressure pipes, acid pumps, heaters... I think we must have 500-600 tons of materials to be enough."

"These things, um, can't be self-produced? Our mechanical industry is still relatively complete."

"Material problem." Ji Situi said, "Unless we can quickly produce materials like stainless steel and polyethylene, otherwise I think it is difficult to self-produce chemical equipment within ten years."

"Use glass and ceramics? The Eighth Route Army's military industry made sulfuric acid using water vats as reaction towers. And many indigenous chemical equipment in the Great Leap Forward also used these things." Luo Duo came out to speak again.

"I'm not clear about this. If there are conditions to purchase modern equipment, there is no need to use indigenous equipment. At least production efficiency will be improved a lot. Even the production environment is better than indigenous methods. If any of you likes to go use water vats to make sulfuric acid, you have to consider your teeth problem carefully."

"I want to ask, with these equipments, can we establish an organic chemical industry?"

"This, I'm afraid it's very difficult." Ji Situi thought, you guys really want to reach for Shu after taking Long, is organic chemical industry so easy to do?

"Then we can't produce nylon and synthetic rubber." Someone was lamenting.

"What do you want nylon for, stockings?" Someone ridiculed.

"Black silk, flesh-colored silk... can't miss one."

When the atmosphere started to become a spoof, Xiao Zishan had to dispel everyone's creativity again and pull back to the main topic.

"Rubber takes eleven years to tap, but there are many places where rubber is used."

"We are not making condoms, why must we have rubber."

These words caused a burst of laughter again, and the meeting fell into infinite stream discussion again.

Xiao Zishan managed to calm everyone down with difficulty.

"I think you want organic chemical industry for plastics," Ji Situi faced the person who proposed building organic chemical industry, and the other party nodded, "Although plastic is our most common daily necessity, the organic chemistry involved is very complex, and we are unlikely to make it - this is not just a problem of raw materials. But we can manufacture celluloid and bakelite."

"Bakelite is very useful."

"If we want to build a power system, bakelite is very useful, but rubber is also..."

"Regarding the discussion of rubber, let the Agricultural Group elaborate later."
