# Chapter 1850 - Clipping Wings

But he had no spare money in hand. The sisters selling smiles not only loved beauty but also loved cash. When three or five days passed without him taking out money, their expressions and words became very unpleasant. The madam then chattered endlessly that he didn't report for temporary residence when coming to stay, nor was he willing to take out a few coins to entertain the Pail-Jia; she couldn't shoulder it anymore. Forced, he had to leave.

With no money in hand and nowhere to go, he had to return to Music Workshop Street to resume his old trade. Unexpectedly, he was caught red-handed by the police waiting there for a rabbit to hit the tree stump (lying in wait).

No one expected Wang Dong would die within just a few minutes of being caught and brought to the police station! Due to the particularity of the Mao Family Inn case, his death added another layer of mystery to this case.

"It looks like the enemies already know their tail is exposed—anxious to silence him."

"This shows our reconnaissance direction is still correct." The speaker was Wu Mu. Although his tone was calm, he was actually quite anxious in his heart. From the headless case until now, several cases strung together with many clues and many arrests, yet not a single real manipulator behind the scenes was caught. Not only was the mysterious Stone Old Man nowhere to be heard from until now, but even that Daoist practicing magic hadn't been caught.

Wu Mu's difficulty lay in the fact that the Political Security Bureau's own action department was very small. He bore the title of Guangdong Political Security General Special Commissioner in vain, actually no different from a commander without soldiers—his department was different from others; staff could not be expanded locally.

As a result, much basic reconnaissance work had to be entrusted to the National Police, including the current case, which was actually being investigated by the Guangzhou Police Bureau. Such entrustment firstly increased coordination difficulty, and secondly meant increasing the National Police's say in the political security field. So Zhao Manxiong sending Action Division Chief Zhou Botao here was like timely rain to him.

Zhou Botao patted the cigarette ash off his sleeve and said: "Judging from the comprehensive clues currently, this case has a great relationship with the gentry of Guangzhou. Especially the Liang family. Even if they are not the mastermind, they are at least one of the important backers."

"Pity we don't have any decisive evidence in hand..."

"Evidence is actually not too important for us." Zhou Botao said, "The Senate and the gentry are in a hostile contradiction relationship. This is not a legal issue—mainly we are not stable in Guangdong yet. Shaking the firmly rooted gentry is still difficult. If we rush to mess with the gentry, and they unite to counterattack, with our current military force and cadre numbers, I'm afraid we can't handle it—then government orders really won't leave Guangzhou. My view is we can start with Wenlan Academy and Guan Di Temple."

Several major cases occurred after entering Guangzhou, all pointing clues to these two places. Zhou Botao believed they could start with them first.

Wenlan Academy was the largest academy in Guangzhou. Because of its rich academy property, it had always been fat meat coveted by local gentry in Guangzhou. Highs over academy directors and deacons never ceased. In recent years, Zhong Aijiao relied on the Liang family's power, and Mo Rongxin relied on becoming in-laws with Gao Tianshi (High scholar Gao). The two partnered to control Wenlan Academy, pocketing the annual revenue of several thousand taels of silver.

"Zhong Aijiao, Mo Rongxin, and Gao Tianshi. These three people should all be characters standing in the front stage running for the gentry." Zhou Botao said, "We kept them in the past because our manpower and material resources were insufficient to deal with them. Now the Guangzhou Municipal Government has at least set up the framework. Taking them out is firstly knocking the mountain to shake the tiger, warning the gentry not to speak or move recklessly; secondly, it is also clipping the gentry's wings; thirdly, that is Mayor Liu's benefit: Guan Di Temple group need not be mentioned, that is a malignant tumor; as for Wenlan Academy, all scholars in the city know what's going on inside—complaints are huge. Taking out Wenlan Academy not only allows Mayor Liu to make a windfall but also vents anger for the scholars. By the way, the Education Department might also thank you. Is this abacus good?"

Wu Mu smiled: "Unexpected that you have only been here a few days, yet you figured out Guangzhou's situation so clearly."

"Did you forget my background? Being a private detective is selling intelligence. Although I've only been here a few days, I read the data compilation you sent every day in Lingao." Zhou Botao said, "Guangzhou's situation is very complex. Our little administrative ability is simply a drop of water in the ocean. Your Special Commissioner job is hard to do."

Just talking, someone delivered documents. Zhou Botao took them, flipped through, and said: "No new material. You see how to handle it."

Wu Mu took it over. This was Han Yue's latest interrogation material—no new content. No matter how she was interrogated, she could only confess a Wang Dong. This person was not only the one who seduced her into falling but also played the role of "liaison." The documents she got from the city government and the mischief in Liu Xiang's incense burner were all instructed by Wang Dong. As for whose instructions Wang Dong followed, Han Yue didn't know herself, only hearing Wang Dong say it was a "Court Official"—this equaled saying nothing.

Wu Mu knew that Han Yue's role was a low-end one in the intelligence system. Although providing very important intelligence and bearing the greatest risk, the return obtained and importance in the system were actually the lowest. Once exposed, the ones ruined and losing lives were such people—worthy of being called cannon fodder in the intelligence world.

Such a naturalized cadre with reliable background, tough experience, and great future betraying like this was regrettable no matter what. But Han Yue's motive for falling didn't seem too rare to Wu Mu. Han Yue was already in her early twenties and had just been "exiled" from the Senator's side.

For female naturalized citizens, almost everyone dreamed of being "taken into favor" by a Senator. As a person close to a Senator, although secretary to a female Senator, Han Yue counted as having a great chance. Now expelled from the team of "people close to" Senators, it meant being separated from this dream forever.

Aging, with no reliance for life, and losing hope. No man had ever been good to them. Now a sweet-talking pretty boy appeared, not only satisfying her emotional and physiological needs but also promising her a future—

He thought about the two consecutive "mole" cases handled by the Political Security Bureau in Guangzhou involving women, sighing with emotion in his heart: Old thoughts and old moral concepts really didn't fade away so easily. No wonder Zhao Manxiong didn't agree to him opening a Political Security training class in Guangzhou, insisting on recruiting from naturalized citizens in Lingao.

"Compared to the whole world, Lingao is just an isolated island of modernized industrial society. But this island is an island thoroughly transformed by us. Only people who have undergone full education and baptism on this island can have their loyalty to our system and culture guaranteed." Zhao Manxiong said so.

"Given a completely new life, a completely new living, and a broad future, yet couldn't withstand a man's sentence. Women are truly slaves of emotion." Zhou Botao mocked himself.

"No, I think we didn't do well enough." Wu Mu shook his head, "We impose our own concepts on naturalized citizens, thinking women in this position will only work harder and be more grateful to the Senate. Forgetting that not long ago they were still genuine 17th-century natives. Even Mayor Liu's little secretary—who read books at Fangcaodi (Fragrant Grassland) for a few years since childhood—was confused by some 'seeking son' and 'aphrodisiac' ghost talk, let alone Han Yue who basically hadn't transformed her thinking properly in Lingao. Besides, Han Yue is already a woman in her early twenties. In this spacetime, she is a genuine old maid. If we got her a husband earlier, this Wang Dong probably wouldn't have succeeded so easily—emotionally empty, taken advantage of by a man entering the void..."

Then cheated into bed—sweet words—dead set devoted—ghost obsessed—played and utilized—abandoned... Zhou Botao supplemented secretly. He handled many divorce cases and saw too much of this.

"Unexpectedly you understand women quite well." Zhou Botao joked.

"Where, where," Wu Mu was slightly embarrassed. Hurry changing the topic, "Pity Wang Dong who hooked her up died just after being caught today!"

Could this fleeing mage really have such great ability to kill invisibly from a distance?

"The body has been sent to Forensic Doctor Su. Results will happen soon." Zhou Botao said, "As for us, let's consider how to start on Wenlan Academy and Guan Di Temple first..."

Meanwhile, Su Wan held a magnifying glass, standing beside Wang Dong's already disemboweled corpse under the spotlight, completely ignoring the sawed-open skull and organs filling the table beside her, carefully looking at one of Wang Dong's legs which was already blue and stiff.

There were two very clear small dots on the ankle. Su Wan let out a breath, picked up her vernier caliper, carefully measured the distance between the two points, and recorded it in her notebook. Then she straightened her waist satisfactorily. Shouting: "Pack all this pile of stuff back for me, sew it up."

Her apprentice walked over with a look of disgust to clean up the "battlefield" left by Su Wan—because the workload was too huge, she had called her apprentice left in Lingao over to order about.

This apprentice was also female. Said to be from a butcher's family, so she didn't fear blood. Also used to scenes of disembowelment. Su Wan had no such warmth as male Senators for this apprentice. Not only ordering her about to the fullest but also beating and scolding without mercy. But this way, her skills also improved rapidly.

"Bring me that stomach content bottle first!" Su Wan suddenly remembered something, "Quick!"

The apprentice about to start packing seemed to be whipped hard, hurriedly fetching a large wide-mouthed glass jar. Inside was half a jar of gray-green viscous liquid, seeming to contain many impurities, emitting a sour smell of decay.

Su Wan didn't dislike this disgusting thing at all, just pulled her mask tight, poured the things in the bottle onto a large white porcelain plate, and fiddled with a probe.
