# Chapter 86 - Cement

Wang Luobin had purchased a complete set of small cement equipment produced by the shaft kiln method, but operating this set of equipment required a large amount of coal, and the transmigrators didn't have coal for the time being.

Other raw materials needed for cement, such as clay, lime, and gypsum, had all been found locally. The clay from the borrow pit of this brick kiln had low sand content and reddish soil quality—high iron content, very suitable for burning cement. As for lime, although the calcium carbonate content of lime burned from shells and oysters at Bopu was low, chalk soil ore layers could also be found near the borrow pit. Gypsum had not been found nearby for the time being, but adding gypsum or not was not a big problem.

After considering again and again, Wang Luobin decided not to install the complete set of equipment that had certain requirements for temperature and raw materials for the time being, but to fire a kind of substitute cement simply and crudely to meet current construction needs. This substitute cement is also called "artificial pozzolan cement", which was also fired in rural areas in some places in the past. It does not require complex equipment processes. Simply put, it is crushing and grinding fired bricks, tiles, or pottery, or directly calcining lime and clay in a kiln. The process of this substitute cement is extremely simple. The calcination temperature is 600-800 degrees Celsius, much lower than the 1450 degrees Celsius required for firing Portland cement. The performance is roughly similar to the oldest "pozzolan cement". The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway in Yunnan was built with this kind of cement, and it was widely used for infrastructure construction in the Great Rear of Southwest China during the War of Resistance.

Wang Luobin only knew there was such a thing, but didn't know if it could be used. So he first asked people to take a batch of fired red bricks from the brick field for experiment. Laborers smashed the bricks into small pieces manually one by one. The fine grinding work was originally intended to use manpower or horse power to pull stone rollers—they found quite a few large and small stone rollers in the quarry at Bairen Beach—but after running for an hour, they found the efficiency was terribly low: only 10 kg was ground.

After grinding fine and sieving, Wang Luobin mixed these powders with lime, then added water and mixed well. Under the gaze of everyone in the Architecture Team, this mixture was used to build a wall. Everyone was excited, wanting to see with their own eyes if this legendary substitute cement was really effective.

After drying, it proved that this fired clay substitute cement was completely usable. Of course, it couldn't compare with real Portland cement, but it could be used as a binder for building materials, and even make concrete with low strength requirements.

This discovery excited everyone. Even the mason Zhao Wu, who smashed bricks, had a look of excitement on his face—he had been a mason for more than ten years. Building walls and houses used yellow mud, lime, and water mixed as binder. The most exquisite one was just mortar with sticky rice juice added. This group of people actually made mortar that could firmly bond bricks together by grinding bricks into powder! This was too beyond his imagination. Are they really pirates? This trick must be remembered. Because he learned this trick, he was even a bit happy that he was captured.

Cement was the first modern industrial product in the true sense for the transmigrators, although it was not too qualified. But for the transmigrators' construction, this was a key step. Cement is the basic raw material of modern architecture.

However, the efficiency of grinding was still too low. At this level, the output of 24-hour continuous grinding was only 240 kg, low enough not to be worth mentioning.

After research, the people in the Machinery Team manufactured a simple automatic grinding machine. They used two stone rollers found from the Bairen Beach quarry to make an electric double roller, connected to the vertical shaft with a through-heart shaft. Bearings were installed on the vertical shaft to reduce resistance during rotation. A rocking frame with a throwing wheel drove the bevel gear through an iron chain to make the stone roller run.

But feeding and sieving were still manual operations, which was not only inefficient but also easy to cause pneumoconiosis—this is a very troublesome occupational disease, almost incurable. Although the ones doing these jobs were captured natives, labor force is also a kind of wealth for transmigrators. Zhan Wuya took a few machinery team members to study it and added a wooden wheel on the bevel gear, driving a winnowing machine for sieving grain with a belt. Materials were added from the funnel at the top of the vertical shaft. The ground powder flowed down automatically from the ramp and fell into the winnowing machine. Utilizing wind power to separate coarse and fine particles, coarse particles were sent back to the funnel above the stone roller by the conveying hopper beside the ramp to be ground again. This indigenous device of iron-wood-stone cooperation could crush almost 1 ton of broken brick materials every day.

With cement, refractory bricks were also needed to build the Hoffman kiln. Refractory bricks are one of the cornerstones of modern industry. Without this thing, needless to say Hoffman kilns and cement kilns, even future blast furnaces would be hopeless. Fortunately, Lingao locally produced refractory materials. Transmigrators found aluminum oxide and silicon oxide for firing refractory bricks near the brick kiln, and easily fired refractory bricks.

With refractory bricks and cement, building a Hoffman kiln was a piece of cake in the hands of the Architecture Team. A few days later, the brick-red chimney of the Hoffman kiln spewed thick black smoke into the air for the first time.

"Damn, it's so beautiful." Someone murmured. A look of intoxication appeared in the eyes of the transmigrators. The scene that was detested by everyone in the past, symbolizing backwardness and pollution, was now regarded as the most beautiful thing by the transmigrators. Wang Luobin looked at the smoke and somewhat understood why the Great Leader back then didn't value the ancient city wall of Beijing at all, tearing it down at will, but issued the heroic words "Beijing's chimneys should be as dense as a forest"—the ancient city wall was something familiar to the point of couldn't be more familiar to the Chinese at that time, while the scarce modern industry at that time was the symbol of a country's social progress.

At this moment, the brick-red chimney of this Hoffman kiln stood proudly among the green mountains and waters by the Wenlan River, without any sense of violation for the transmigrators, declaring the official beginning of the transmigrators' industrialization era.

Before the Hoffman kiln started firing, it needed to be warmed up. The Architecture Team set off to Bopu again to build a wood drying kiln for the wood processing factory there. With this drying kiln meeting standards, the Timber Team could continuously provide qualified wood products to the construction site of Bairen City, instead of the temporary substitute wood dried by earth kilns with inconsistent humidity and prone to shrinkage and deformation at any time. Wang Luobin didn't participate in this matter. As for the dimensions and materials of the drying kiln, Luo Duo would find books anyway. He hadn't seen this thing when he lived in Guangxi.

Watching the architectural engineering team climb onto agricultural vehicles and drive towards Bopu, he suddenly remembered something and immediately dialed a call to Mei Wan: "Discuss with the people in the Timber Team, build another wood dry distillation kiln."

"Dry distillation kiln?" Mei Wan didn't know what this was.

"It's a charcoal burning kiln. Tell Luo Duo later, he knows. You guys study it first and see when it can be put into production."

Since there was no coal, only charcoal could be used as a substitute first. Dry distillation of wood can not only obtain charcoal but also obtain wood tar used as chemical raw materials. This is a complex compound from which many useful substances can be extracted. The calorific value of charcoal itself is not inferior to coal.

The Food Office delivered meals to the workers working in the brick and tile factory with a cooking cart. Now, Wu De had taught them to queue with sticks. Queuing is a basic social order, a manifestation that everyone can roughly obtain resources fairly. The reason why Chinese people don't like to queue seems to have nothing to do with personal quality. Perhaps it is largely related to long-term scarcity of social resources. Whoever obeys the order will suffer, so over time everyone doesn't like to queue. If there is a chance, they will rush fiercely and squeeze others to the back. Wu De felt there was some truth in this.

Just like the current meal distribution, although each team had a leader maintaining order, the whole team was still a bit messy. Everyone hoped to queue to the front. Only forced by the deterrence of the transmigrators, the order of the team was barely preserved.

Wu De was still satisfied with the work of his laborers. During the entire project period, he seemed to just walk around casually, observing this team. Most people worked relatively hard. Of course, not because of their high consciousness, but because of the competitive consciousness among the five team leaders. No one wanted their team to perform too poorly in front of Wu De—for common people, it's always "traitors are worse than devils". These five team leaders were indeed very diligent in urging work, but this was not enough. Wu De knew that the captives' diligence was only because of fear. To work hard consciously and voluntarily required stimulation in other aspects.

Wu De decided to start with food. After each captive received a bowl of porridge, Wu De asked people to carry a basket over. This strangely shaped thing woven by the Machinery Team emitted a stinky smell of dried seafood. It was an unsuccessful salted fish work of the Food Office...

"Today Wang Tian's team worked best and most," Wu De announced on the earth pile, "So each person in their team can eat one more salted fish."

This extra reward made many people's eyelids swell. Since being captured, eating two meals of porridge every day—this was bearable for most people—there were plenty of people who lived a half-starved life since birth, but having not even a salted radish or the like, drinking porridge caused much urine, and not eating salt made the body soft after two days.

"Wang Tian commanded effectively, issued two." This reward made Wang Tian's face glow with excitement. The other four people felt a bit sour. Eating an extra salted fish was a small matter; losing face was the big matter. All calculated to punish a few guys who slackened off fiercely at night—kill the chicken to scare the monkey.
