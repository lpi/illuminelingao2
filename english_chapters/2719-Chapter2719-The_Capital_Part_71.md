# Chapter 2719: The Capital (Part 71)

"I'm glad you understand." Cao Sheng said.

With the conversation having come this far and proper gestures made, Min Zhanlian brought out the prepared cover story. He said his people had been entrusted by an out-of-power bigwig to gather "critical information" on a certain powerful court official in the capital.

"...To speak frankly, I've already said too much. I must ask you to keep this confidential."

Cao Sheng's expression turned sour. Any matter involving court bigwigs could easily bring trouble upon oneself. He said, "I naturally won't talk about your affairs. But the weather in the capital has been strange lately—who knows what ill winds might blow. You'd best be careful."

Min Zhanlian thought this was quite similar to what Third Master Qin in the outer city had said. It seemed undercurrents were indeed roiling in the capital.

He wanted to draw more out of the other man, but Cao Sheng was unwilling to say more. He stood up and took his leave.

Watching Cao Sheng leave, Min Zhanlian said in a low voice, "Little Five."

"Boss..."

"Take some people and tail Cao Sheng. See who he meets."

Since Cao Sheng had made a special trip to warn him, he was obviously acting on someone's behalf. So he would certainly relay the response to his superior at the first opportunity. This person might very well be connected to the case of Leng Ningyun's kidnapping.

Little Five had no name or surname; he was an orphan. He had been a pickpocket since childhood. At twelve, he apprenticed to a master and became a "flying thief," with a minor reputation in the *Jianghu*. He was extremely cautious; most of the time he avoided showing his face, and no one knew his real name. The *Jianghu* only knew him as "Little Five."

Ever since the Australians came to Lingao and Lingao became a "rich place," Little Five also came to "make his fortune." He hadn't expected to be caught on his very first trip to Lingao, falling into the hands of the National Police. After many twists and turns, he was transferred from Police Section Ten to the Special Operations Team, specifically utilizing his talents for tailing and surveillance. He had two direct subordinates: one was an elderly man who looked ancient, and the other was a middle-aged woman who looked like a village wife.

Little Five nodded silently. He rarely showed his face and seldom spoke in crowded situations. In short, unless you paid special attention, you could hardly notice his presence.

"Little Qian, tomorrow go to the outer city again and sound out Third Master Qin."

Little Five returned after two days with news: Cao Sheng had dispatched, first thing in the morning, a trusted subordinate who handled important matters for him to Tongzhou. Little Five left the old man to monitor Cao Sheng while he and the woman separately tailed the subordinate to Tongzhou. They saw him wait at a teahouse called "Houyuan."

"Houyuan" was also a teahouse frequented by *Jianghu* people. He didn't wait long before a person who looked like a local ruffian arrived. The two talked secretly at a table for a long time. After they parted, Little Five kept eyes on this person, while the old woman followed Cao Sheng's subordinate back—to see if he contacted anyone else along the way.

Little Five stayed at the teahouse, covertly watching him for about half a *shichen* (roughly an hour) before he left Houyuan. Little Five followed quietly. He found the man's residence and easily learned all the details about him.

The man himself was nothing special—just a local ruffian in Tongzhou. But he had another identity: he was a hanger-on of a Brocade Guard school lieutenant at the local yamen, using the Brocade Guard's sign to throw his weight around outside.

Hearing this, Min Zhanlian's eyes lit up. Didn't this match what Cao Sheng had said!

Little Five also felt this discovery was of major value, so he stayed in Tongzhou to continue surveillance. The next day, he went to Houyuan again to drink tea. During that time, the ruffian met four people.

"Here's the situation on these four. I inquired about each one. The most likely one is this Liu Sha." Little Five said the other three were either Tongzhou businessmen or local idlers, hangers-on, or runner types. Only this Liu Sha had an unusual identity.

"This man served in the Brocade Guard during the Tianqi era. After Wei Zhongxian's downfall, he lost his position. But later, somehow, he connected with some powerful family, doing dirty work for them. His status is special. He frequently travels between the capital, Tongzhou, and Tianjin, and is well-acquainted with all sorts of people."

Min Zhanlian nodded secretly: This was it. This Liu Sha was the most suspicious. For such a person to suddenly take interest in a group of *Jianghu* people coming to the capital "on business" could only mean he was guarding against something.

"Where is this man now?"

"Still in Tongzhou. He has a house there, keeping a woman. Probably a kept mistress." Little Five said he had discreetly inquired through neighbors and learned that this Liu Sha came once or twice a month, staying two or three days each time, irregularly. But recently, he had been in Tongzhou for seven or eight days, and went out wandering every day.

Min Zhanlian had only one part hope before; now, after hearing this, he had two or three parts certainty. This man lingering in Tongzhou was obviously to monitor travelers entering and leaving the capital. The timing matched when Manager Leng was kidnapped. Once Leng Ningyun was kidnapped, Lingao would certainly send people to the capital as soon as possible to take charge. These people could only come through the Tianjin-Tongzhou-Capital corridor.

He didn't know how much money Liu Sha had spent on the "dragon head masters" at the various wharves along the route, but the effect was obvious. As soon as they arrived at Zhangjiawan, Cao Sheng came specially to feel them out.

However, Cao Sheng's probing showed their disguise was quite successful; otherwise, Cao Sheng wouldn't have specifically advised them not to enter the capital. No matter how shrewd Liu Sha was, he couldn't easily question the judgment of an old *Jianghu* hand like Cao Sheng.

"Little Five, send one of your people to watch Liu Sha constantly. Don't alert him."

After Little Five left, Little Qian, returning from the outer city, also brought important news.

On his second trip to the outer city to find Third Master Qin, Little Qian arrived at the teahouse but didn't see him. Asking the waiter, he learned that Third Master Qin's brother-in-law Liu Xiaobian had died, and they were holding the funeral.

"...When I heard, I went to his house, kowtowed, and contributed two taels of silver as condolence money. He appreciated it and asked what I was planning to do in the capital, whether I needed his help."

Little Qian had a ready excuse. He said he'd come to the capital to do a "big job" in the South City, planning to flee through the South City, and wanted Third Master Qin's assistance when the time came. Third Master Qin readily agreed. During their conversation, they mentioned Liu Xiaobian's death.

Third Master Qin had nothing to hide. He told the whole story of how Liu Xiaobian had inexplicably gone to Haidian and been murdered on the roadside.

"He really died there?!" Hearing this, Min Zhanlian's pupils shrank. He asked.

"Exactly!"

"What date was the body discovered?"

"The twenty-third of the twelfth month."

"Excellent!" At this exclamation, everyone present showed joy. Because this was extremely vital information: the intelligence Heliansheng had given them clearly stated that Lady Sanniang's silver cart convoy was attacked the day before.

Without a doubt, Liu Xiaobian was one of the bandits.

According to Little Qian's inquiries, Liu Xiaobian was a loafer and ruffian. Such people lacked both the courage and the arm strength to be highway robbers—especially against a convoy protected by escort masters. He could only have been involved for one reason: he was acting on someone's behalf.

Since Manager Leng's kidnapping, this was the first lead directly connected to the kidnappers.

"So Liu Xiaobian's backer must be the black hand behind the kidnapping..." Zhou Ruolan said thoughtfully. "Pity he's dead!"

"No rush," Min Zhanlian said. "He's dead, but the people around him are all still alive. We'll question them one by one. Worst case, we kidnap Third Master Qin and interrogate him—he certainly knows how many friends his brother-in-law had and their backgrounds."

The tense atmosphere in the room lightened somewhat. Little Qian said, "Speaking of people around him, I also learned another piece of news related to the case."

"What?"

"This Liu Xiaobian has been working in Nanyuan these past few months..."

Liu Xiaobian was normally idle and spent his days gambling and whoring. His home was bare. So Third Master Qin's wife had pressured Third Master Qin to find her brother a job. Though Third Master Qin was the dragon head master of the outer city, making the ground shake with a stomp in the South City, finding a cushy, well-paying job was still somewhat difficult. In the end, he had to use several intermediaries and grease the palms of palace eunuchs to secure a position in Nanyuan, managing the castrated men who had come to the capital seeking palace service but hadn't been formally admitted.

"Managing" actually meant doing roll call and distributing money and rice. Not only was the job idle, there was also room for embezzlement. The eunuchs who went out begging and extorting also had to give these "managers" a cut. This money was supposed to be tributed to the eunuchs overseeing the gardens, but just skimming from the money and rice was already a tidy sum.

"So Liu Xiaobian and those two eunuchs were in cahoots!" Zhou Ruolan said. "Pity the two eunuchs were killed!"

"The eunuchs only knew Liu Xiaobian. Didn't you see the confession clearly stated: the person who brought them was also dead."

"But I don't understand—why send two eunuchs to Martial Yama's gang? Eunuchs are too distinctive..."

"Not necessarily. Unless you pull down the pants of every corpse and every captive to check..."

This drew laughter from everyone. Min Zhanlian also smiled and said, "Let's not overthink it. The enemy might not have thought that far. Besides, who would have expected Old Feng from Heliansheng to pull that trick?"

"That's true," Zhou Ruolan said. "According to Heliansheng's intelligence, those two eunuchs were also capable fighters, holding their own against the escort masters."

"The eunuchs of the Imperial Stables are good fighters and can even command troops," Min Zhanlian said. "Setting other things aside, Nanyuan obviously has something worth our effort to investigate. Tomorrow we'll set out for the capital."

With a lead, everyone felt reassured. They were about to return to their rooms to prepare when Min Zhanlian called Little Qian and Little Five back.

"Tomorrow, you'll split off from us halfway and enter the outer city on your own."

"Understood!"

"Once in the South City, focus your efforts on Third Master Qin and the people around him. Find out all of Liu Xiaobian's connections. Especially who he was close to in Nanyuan and who he associated with frequently."

"Got it."

"Little Five, you go to Tongzhou. Keep eyes on this Liu Sha. Dig into his background. Find out which deity he really is."
