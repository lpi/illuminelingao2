# Chapter 994 Thonburi

Thonburi had many Chinese and Japanese merchants whose businesses were very broad in scope. Ping Qiusheng browsed the Chinese merchant street of Thonburi. The low wooden buildings lining both sides of the street were all various shops. Most were opened by Chinese, selling all kinds of sundry goods—from expensive Chinese silk fabrics, porcelain, and handicrafts, to cheap daily necessities, to fruits, dried fruits, even pickled vegetables and sauces—everything was included. One could say that without the supply of large amounts of Chinese daily necessities, these Southeast Asian "kingdoms" would be living a semi-barbaric life.

Chinese influence was very great in the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The dynasty relied heavily on Chinese industrial and commercial talents. Probably because King U Thong was of Chinese descent, Siam had always treated the Chinese relatively favorably, allowing them to live inside Ayutthaya city. In comparison, the Japanese and Portuguese could only live outside the city.

Because of this relationship, Chinese industry and commerce developed very rapidly locally. Many people made great fortunes. Those dark-skinned people bustling about in short, drab shops might well be conducting trade worth tens or hundreds of thousands of taels of silver.

Ping Qiusheng saw several Lingao-produced products in the merchant street here: straw hats, rum, "Australian" candy, white sugar, paper... Whatever major products the transmigrator group had, almost all were sold here. However, quantities were both small and prices very expensive.

Commodities have their own fluidity—whether superior in quality or low in price, commodities can automatically flow here, indicating that the market for "Australian goods" was even broader than they estimated.

Ping Qiusheng felt very excited—with so many Chinese merchants possessing large amounts of capital and manpower, they were practically natural collaborators and a fifth column! The Ming and Qing dynasties, with such excellent overseas foundations, regarded overseas Chinese as "abandoned people"—not only doing nothing, but even viewing them as enemies. In the end, they handed over this living space south of the mainland that Chinese people should naturally have owned to the monkeys.

However, Feng Shengyue's remarks poured a basin of cold water on Ping Qiusheng.

It turned out there were many factions among the Chinese, hostile to each other. Throughout Southeast Asia, relations among Teochew, Hakka, and Southern Fujian people could be described as fire and water—conflicts erupted from time to time. Besides large regions, there were also small hometown groups. Clan power was also very strong, each forming their own cliques, squeezing out outsiders, even not hesitating to collude with local strongmen to attack dissidents.

This was not surprising in the 17th century when modern nationalism had not yet developed. Ping Qiusheng had little possibility of immediately getting help from local Chinese. Developing trade relations with Chinese merchants and using their commercial channels was perhaps more realistic—key things still had to be done by their own people.

Ping Qiusheng's group received warm hospitality only from Qiongshan-faction merchants here. Although everyone generally didn't consider Australians as Great Ming people, since the Australians stayed in Hainan, they were also considered part of Hainan. Especially since in recent years, Hainan merchants had made considerable fortunes trading Australian goods and Southeast Asian products back and forth.

The Qiongshan faction's influence among local Chinese merchants was not large, without much say. Their businesses weren't big either. The local guild leader hosted Ping Qiusheng and others for drinks and opera at the Qiongshan Guild Hall, learning quite a bit of information during the banquet. The Chinese merchant influence here was not only very large but also penetrated deep into the interior. Chinese merchants included not only large merchants engaged in import-export trade, but also small peddlers dealing in commodities like firewood, rice, oil, and salt. These small peddlers penetrated into the interior, opening shops in villages and towns no one had ever heard of, selling commodities, purchasing local products, establishing quite an extensive commercial network. In Ping Qiusheng's view, these small peddlers were much more valuable to the Senate than the maritime trade merchants sitting in the ports.

The Divine King's envoy, Worawong, soon came to Thonburi and received Ping Qiusheng's party. After several days of negotiations, both sides reached a preliminary trade agreement: In exchange for the Senate selling weapons to Siam, ships of the Southeast Asia Company authorized by the Senate would be permitted to anchor and trade in Thonburi and Pattani. Limited to two large ships each time. Southeast Asia Company ships were exempt from anchorage fees.

Southeast Asia Company merchants could freely trade with any merchants they wished to trade with in both places. However, they were not permitted to enter the Siamese interior without permission.

Southeast Asia Company merchants could bring in various goods without restriction, but each voyage must bring designated quantities of weapons. They also had the right to take away any goods they wished. Import products would pay import duties according to regulations—weapons were exempt.

Because it was the first visit and both sides hadn't yet established sufficient mutual trust, Ping Qiusheng did not request to set up a warehouse or trading post locally—temporarily they didn't have the capacity to establish posts in Siam anyway, and even if he proposed it, the other side might not agree.

Both sides were satisfied with reaching such a preliminary agreement. Worawong was quite ambitious—he was very interested in the "Australians" or, as the Ming people called them, "Hair people." Especially the rumors of their powerful military force.

He developed a strong interest in the two ships the Southeast Asia Company sailed in. Although for safety reasons he didn't propose to inspect the ships, he still managed to observe from nearby on other vessels: From appearance, these two ships weren't much different from those Chinese merchant ships. Except for the deck structure layout and masts being slightly different, the hulls were exactly the same. Even a "landlubber" like Worawong knew these two ships were ordinary Chinese large ships, just modified by the Australians—the modification traces were quite obvious, especially the old and new materials.

Armament was something he was particularly interested in. The rise of the Tai people had much to do with their emphasis on military force. Tai military, Khmer administration, and Chinese industry and commerce were the three pillars of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Ordinary Chinese merchant ships rarely had cannons—only those English, Dutch, and Portuguese ships would be equipped with cannons. But these two ships flying the "Nine-Section Flag" both had cannons installed on deck: black, short, and thick, not very similar to Western cannons he had seen before. Obviously, once these cannons fired, the huge projectiles they launched would cause even more serious damage to the enemy.

Besides that, he was also interested in the "matchlock guns" the sailors were equipped with. Worawong was very familiar with matchlock guns: Burma, the Ayutthaya Kingdom's arch-enemy, widely used matchlock guns, while Siam's matchlock guns basically relied on imports. Since the Australians could universally equip sailors with these weapons, obviously they possessed enough guns.

Through his subordinates' opportunities of delivering water and food to the ships, Worawong obtained more details: for example, these guns had more beautiful appearances, higher surface finish, etc. Also, these guns seemed not to use match-cords: because the sailors carrying matchlock guns never carried match-cords on them—the match-cords wound around matchlock gunners' bodies were originally one of their distinctive features.

Although he very much hoped to actually experience the power of these novel weapons, he never encountered a suitable opportunity. Until during a banquet, he took the opportunity to propose seeing the power of these guns. Ping Qiusheng immediately instructed people to satisfy his request.

When a Special Reconnaissance Team sharpshooter used a J+-marked high-precision Minié rifle to shatter a ceramic jar 150 meters away with one shot, all the natives present were stunned—the range of matchlock guns was at most about 50 paces, and what it could hit was purely up to luck. Hitting the target from such a far distance with one shot was simply unheard of.

Worawong proposed whether he could purchase these weapons, and was naturally refused—however, Ping Qiusheng suggested they purchase cannons: to show he wasn't lying, he ordered his flagship to bombard an islet reef in the bay.

The momentum of 68-pound iron cannonballs landing on the reef was astonishing—reef fragments splashed, smoke rose into the sky. This suggestion was immediately approved by Worawong. He immediately requested that the Southeast Asia Company bring one such cannon and matching ammunition on its next voyage, plus provide gunnery training services.

As for the price, he didn't even ask, only expressing that he would pay with any goods the Australians needed—obviously, arms trade was a profiteering industry.

Two weeks later, the fully loaded fleet began its return voyage. Everything Ping Qiusheng brought this time had sold out completely. All 1,500 Model 1631 machetes were sold to Worawong. Prasat Thong's main force was probably around 4,000 men; after complete re-equipment, there would be a consumption of 1,000 pieces per year, plus considering civilian demand.

At the conversion price, one Model 1631 machete was 1 tael, plus Australian sugar and various sundry goods, totally exchanged for nearly 30,000 *dan* of rice. Part was transported with the fleet; part was left at the local Qiongshan-faction merchants' warehouse, waiting for ships to transfer.

Amid his busy work, Ping Qiusheng occasionally earnestly guided Quark: hinting that this place wasn't peaceful, and the Senate very much needed the rice and minerals here. If he was interested, he could well establish a trading post here too—even if just watching the field for the Australians, it would also serve as a trade window for the English East India Company—though the English East India Company preferred Pattani.

Ping Qiusheng didn't trust Worawong. Quark also had great ambitions, but he was first and foremost a merchant, thinking about making money, and his credibility as a merchant had been recognized by the Senate. Worawong, faced with huge profits, might well do again what he had done to the Japanese merchants back then.

Ping Qiusheng also released information to local Chinese and Japanese merchants: rice, potash salt ore, and timber from here—Lingao would take as much as there was. Local merchants willing to serve the Australians, capable of transporting goods directly to Lingao or Sanya, could all receive generous compensation. He also didn't want Quark to monopolize trade here—after all, once they freed their hands, this place would become territory directly under the transmigrator group. Having grain controlled by anyone wasn't reassuring.
