# Chapter 1888 - Plague War (Part 3)

## Plague War (Part 3)

Lai Xiao's escape didn't cause much of a ripple. To avoid trouble, the escort personnel simply wrote in their report: "One jumped into the river and committed suicide." Thus Lai Xiao was struck from the "contact personnel list" with the notation: "Died of other causes." Over a hundred people had died from various causes during the collection of beggars and vagrants—one more or one less wouldn't attract anyone's attention.

Lin Motian was already swamped and naturally couldn't concern himself with one Lai Xiao's life or death. He was busy training epidemic prevention personnel, holding meetings with baojia heads and police officers, telling them to pay attention to patients, roadside corpses, and deceased persons in their respective jurisdictions. All deceased persons required a death certificate issued by an epidemic prevention inspector on site before funeral arrangements could proceed.

Large quantities of printed posters were plastered everywhere, urging residents to promptly clear garbage, launch a rat extermination campaign, and collect any dead rats in designated baskets to be gathered by specialized personnel. No random disposal was allowed.

"I want each baojia district to submit one dead rat, and I'll do tissue sectioning and cultivation," Lin Motian said. "First let's figure out where this plague originated."

"Isn't it from the rats?" Mu Min by this time was already drafting a document requesting twenty thousand rat traps from Lingao. She was preparing to distribute them to every baojia in the city.

"Guangzhou hasn't had a major plague outbreak before. The likelihood of rats carrying plague bacillus is low. Most likely it was brought in through the fur trade," Lin Motian said. "So I first need to dissect and culture rats from all parts of the city to see if they carry plague bacillus in their bodies. That's how we can determine the source of infection."

"So should I still request these rat traps...?"

"Still request them. Rat extermination is always good for environmental sanitation," Lin Motian said. "Killing rats is one thing, but it can also eliminate fleas."

Because bubonic plague was mainly transmitted by fleas, eliminating fleas was an important means of cutting off plague transmission. Fleas in this time period were virtually everywhere. Human-livestock cohabitation, terrible living conditions, and extremely scarce bathing facilities... all resulted in extremely high flea infection rates. Even urban middle class and even wealthy people had flea infestations.

However, the Elders' Council had neither DDT nor 666 as highly effective flea-killing agents. Due to the enormous population, they also couldn't "purify" people the way they had treated refugees on Hainan Island. The only available supply was a small amount of pyrethrin—nowhere near the scale of the U.S. Army spraying DDT throughout Naples.

"Go with what conditions we have; push forward even without them," Lin Motian said. "When Wu Liande went to Manchuria for epidemic prevention, he started with empty hands just like us—no DDT, no antibiotics. In that Manchurian place, bathing was even harder. Through organization and discipline alone, he used isolation to contain the plague."

Establishing the quarantine zone on Changzhou Island was only the first step. Next, Lin Motian ordered a suspension of all fur trading. Ships carrying furs and warehouses storing furs were all sealed, and all contact personnel were sent to the quarantine zone for isolation and observation.

"Master, the wash water is ready!"

Xiao Si, an apprentice at the Xingfu Mountain Goods Store, stood at the door of the proprietor's room, calling out loudly. But in his heart he was puzzling. The proprietor habitually rose early year-round. By "Australian time" as was fashionable these days, he was always up by five o'clock regardless of summer or winter—just like the shop assistants.

But now the sun was already high in the sky, and not only was the proprietor not up—there wasn't a sound from his room. This was quite strange. It didn't matter if he didn't get up, but Mr. Liu, who had arranged to discuss business, had already arrived. They couldn't just leave him waiting!

After the shop's assistants conferred, they sent Xiao Si, who had just completed his apprenticeship, to "fetch" him. If it angered the proprietor, this little brat would bear the blame.

Xiao Si naturally had no right to say "no." Actually, he wasn't feeling well today himself—sore throat and a feverish feeling—but he didn't dare casually claim to be "sick." Now standing outside the door calling several times with no response from inside, Xiao Si pushed the door—it wasn't latched inside. He poked his head in and saw the proprietor still lying in bed. He called several more times, still no response.

"Is he sick?" Xiao Si thought. He moved closer to take a look, and immediately was so frightened that he scrambled out, falling and crawling toward the door, shouting: "Something's wrong! The proprietor is dead!"

Lin Motian wore a thick Wu Liande-style mask and isolation gown as he examined this corpse just delivered to the "Quarantine Morgue" at the Liuhua Bridge Crematorium: skin with ecchymosis, swollen, suppurating, ulcerated lymph nodes... All indicated this was death from bubonic plague. He carefully collected several tissue and fluid samples from the corpse for cultivation and observation to make a final diagnosis.

If the diagnosis was confirmed, then this plague war would officially begin. Lin Motian only felt a heavy weight pressing on his heart.

"What do we do with the body? Should we do an autopsy?" Su Wan asked.

"No need. Handle it just like that beggar's corpse—take it straight to cremation," Lin Motian said from behind his mask with an exhale. "You'll need to watch them. The corpse itself is a source of infection. Everything used here should be thrown in and burned with it."

Su Wan nodded: "I understand that."

The Xingfu Mountain Goods Store's staff had all been quarantined on site. However, the quarantine inspectors quickly discovered that one young assistant's condition matched Disease No. 1 as described in the manual. Lin Motian received the report and hurried over to take a look. Xiao Si had already fallen into a high fever—the illness was progressing very fast.

Two patients appearing at a single mountain goods store simultaneously was no coincidence. Upon inquiry, Lin Motian learned that this store had indeed been dealing in furs recently. Not long ago, they had brought in a shipment of otter pelts from Liaodong and had been airing them in the courtyard during the hot summer sun a few days ago to prevent mold and moths.

"Where are the furs now?"

"All in the warehouse. Mr. Liu was supposed to come today to discuss this matter." The assistant who had been summoned looked at the "Chief" wearing a thick mask over his face and a white coat, secretly alarmed, thinking: Has some important person of the Great Song passed away? Wearing white is one thing, but to cover even the face—what a strange custom!

"Which Mr. Liu?"

"That would be Mr. Liu Deshan of Dongshan Ju, specializing in long-distance north-south cargo. The furs in our shop were bought from him..."

Lin Motian immediately ordered the Epidemic Prevention Battalion to mobilize and isolate Liu Deshan and everyone he had been in contact with. Not just him—everyone who had visited the Xingfu Mountain Goods Store in the past few days had to be isolated.

"Isolated personnel to be immediately transferred to the quarantine zone. Xingfu Mountain Goods Store to be disinfected, then sealed—absolutely no one allowed in or out. Stored furs to be sealed and transported to Liuhua Bridge for incineration."

He issued a series of orders. The assistant stared in dumbfounded shock, suddenly bewildered, and asked: "Chief! What law have we broken? Our shop never does anything illegal. We even dump our garbage in the proper baskets..."

"Your shop has been infected with an epidemic!" Lin Motian said coldly. "You'd better pray you haven't caught it yourself."

With that, he hurried to find Lin Baiguang, wanting him to immediately arrange people to seal off the Xingfu Mountain Goods Store and Dongshan Ju.

"Liu Deshan?!" Lin Baiguang was alarmed.

"Yes." Lin Motian was surprised—did Lin Baiguang know him?

"He's one of our suppliers," Lin Baiguang said. "He travels north and south year-round, trading goods. I know of him because United Logistics bought a large quantity of furs from him..."

"Where are these furs?" Now Lin Motian was really anxious. Because the furs United Logistics bought—some were shipped to Hong Kong for making military supplies, some went directly back to Lingao for processing into industrial and civilian products. Their uses were extremely wide-ranging.

If the fur shipments contained fleas carrying plague bacillus, and they spread in Hong Kong, Lingao, or among the South China Army, the consequences would be unimaginable!

"The most recent batch was all shipped to Hong Kong, and that's been over a month now..." Lin Baiguang, who coordinated relations among all parties in Guangzhou, knew everything. "According to your nine-day incubation theory, if there were a problem, an outbreak should have already happened at the military supply factory and logistics center in Hong Kong."

"That's good to hear." Lin Motian felt cold sweat all over. "Even so, his properties also need to be sealed and disinfected."

"His business is simple—just a dock warehouse and the Dongshan Ju ship—which was actually built at our Hong Kong shipyard."

From the sealing of Xingfu Mountain Goods Store, Guangzhou's full epidemic prevention isolation measures officially began.

Liu Deshan had just returned home when his house was surrounded by the Epidemic Prevention Battalion. Before he could figure out what was happening, his entire household—old and young, including servants—were all brought out and declared under "quarantine."

He himself was brought before Lin Motian.

"Have you recently transported any furs from Liaodong to sell in Guangzhou?"

"Yes! Yes!" Liu Deshan was puzzling in his mind. His fur trading was on Elder Hong's instructions—there was nothing illegal about it. "The furs I got from Lüshun, plus I also got some from Tianjin."

He had originally wanted to say that he hadn't been in the fur business before—it was all on Elder Hong's instruction. But then he thought: who knew what grudges there might be between these Elders? If he spoke carelessly, he might offend both sides. So he changed his words: "Don't the Chiefs need to buy furs?"

Lin Motian asked again: "The otter pelts at Xingfu came from you?"

Liu Deshan's heart skipped a beat. He remembered the Australians had issued notices, and the Industrial and Commercial Association had mentioned in meetings that furs coming from the north couldn't be sold privately—they all had to be sold to the Australians. The Xingfu had overseas channels and could sell otter and sable pelts from Liaodong to the Red Hairs for over ten times the profit. The shop proprietor knew Liu Deshan traveled north for furs and had repeatedly asked him to smuggle goods. Liu Deshan, tempted by the small profit, had privately sold quite a bit of cargo to him.

This Elder was asking directly—clearly there was no getting out of it. He could only say: "Yes, that was my merchandise."

"The Elders' Council has repeatedly decreed that furs are controlled goods—private trading is forbidden! How dare you!" Lin Motian could no longer contain himself, pounding the table in fury.
