# Chapter 1680 - Entering the Village

Seeing them walk far away, Yun Suji stood up and patted the dirt off his buttocks. The guards behind had caught up.

"Chief, are you okay?"

"I'm fine." Yun Suji said, "Look at this cadre, quite majestic."

The guard said: "Isn't it like this in the countryside? If you don't have some majesty, who listens to you!"

Yun Suji didn't say anything. He had been a Tiandihui agricultural technician for several years, spending more than half of the year in relevant villages, and married a daughter of a small landlord. He knew what the guard said was largely true.

"Let's go, enter the village!"

Standard Villages were all built according to a unified model, neat and uniform. Since Qiongshan belonged to the Yellow Zone and had no military defense needs, the Standard Village did not adopt the fortress earth building (Tulou) style designed by President Wen. However, to facilitate public security management, the village was still enclosed. The outermost circle of houses had walls built between them to connect into a block, leaving only four exits in the east, west, south, and north.

Yun Suji walked into this Standard Village. There was a wooden sentry box at the village head. Several women were sitting outside stitching shoe soles and talking. Hearing their accent was Shandong, he nodded secretly.

Just about to enter the village, a woman asked: "Comrade, which village are you from?"

Yun Suji stopped. Seeing the questioning woman was twenty-five or twenty-six, tall, with a few slight pockmarks on her oval face, wearing a blue cloth small jacket with a carefully rolled red edge, old but tidy and neat. He said: "I am from the county coming here to handle affairs."

"Do you have a road pass?"

"Yes, yes." Yun Suji took out the letter of introduction from his pocket. The woman took it, examining it upside down and downside up. Yun Suji knew she probably couldn't read and was comparing the shape of the official seal.

The county's naturalized cadre said the literacy rate in this village was over eighty percent; it seemed there was a lot of water (exaggeration) in that.

After a long while, the woman handed back the letter of introduction: "The seal is correct. You go in, sir."

Yun Suji praised: "Your security here is quite strict."

Several women looked at him and didn't make a sound. It was the woman who asked for the letter of introduction who spoke: "Village rules: strangers entering and leaving must have a road pass."

Yun Suji originally wanted to say a few more words to them, but they all fell silent, just sitting down to stitch shoes. Seeing he couldn't strike up a conversation, Yun Suji had to ask for the direction of the Village Office.

"Walk east along the road, you'll arrive when you see the big banyan tree." That young woman said.

Yun Suji thanked her and walked into the village.

The roads in the village were clean, without a bit of garbage or debris. The walls weren't snow-white but were clean, with no urine stains, feces, or garbage at the corners. Slogans were painted one by one on the white walls along the street: "Don't plant red flowers (green manure) today, go down the mine pit in Sanya tomorrow"; "One person steals electric wire, whole family goes to labor reform"; "Hygiene not done well, whole family gets malaria"; "Women don't unbind feet, men bind small feet"; "Fight across the strait, liberate all China"... Yun Suji saw many such slogans when going to the countryside usually and didn't mind. But the cleanliness of this village truly exceeded his expectations—it reached the level of the few best model villages in Lingao.

There weren't many people on the street, probably all gone to the fields. A few who saw him quickly hid by the roadside without saying a word.

Yun Suji felt somewhat strange and walked straight to the Village Office. There was a big banyan tree outside the Village Office, probably there for a long time, with a stone mill under the tree. Yun Suji knew such places were where villagers gathered to talk. Now it was the slack season, yet unexpectedly not a single villager was there. Yun Suji felt even more strange.

The Village Offices of Standard Villages were all the same. Outside was a bulletin board posted with various notices. Yun Suji stopped to look; most were the latest policy notifications. Standard notices printed by the County Office Printing House, and some written with brush on rough paper, which were village affairs. Yun Suji took a look and saw the latest one was a notice for each family to provide corvée labor, followed by a detailed list: which family, how many people, names and surnames included, very detailed. There was also a newspaper reading board next to it, pasted with yesterday's *Lingao Times*.

Just looking at this bulletin board, let alone the 17th century, it was rare even in 21st-century Chinese rural areas.

Yun Suji wondered secretly, this grassroots governance level! Still a "relatively advanced village"? What would the most advanced one look like? He stepped in. Inside was also very tidy. A yard in the middle rolled flat and smooth. Three main rooms were office areas, and the left and right were wing rooms hanging with padlocks, probably warehouses.

Inside the Village Office, he met two village cadres playing chess. Because they were arguing over a move, they didn't see Senator Yun enter.

Yun Suji waited for a while. Still no one spoke to him, so he asked amidst their argument: "Which one is the Village Head?"

The two village cadres looked up. Seeing him wearing a bamboo hat, a double-breasted gray cloth cadre suit, dark blue homespun trousers, and straw sandals on his feet, he looked like someone who went to the fields often. Although they didn't recognize him, hearing his accent, it wasn't the southern tone of naturalized cadres but had some northern accent.

Judging from this clothing, the older village cadre thought he was a messenger sent from some village, so he asked lazily: "Which village are you from?"

Yun Suji replied: "From Lingao County."

The village cadre asked again: "What are you doing here?"

The other cadre was about to lose the game and urged from the side: "Move quickly!"

Yun Suji was somewhat impatient and said: "You are very busy! Talk again when you are free later!" Saying so, he threw his backpack onto the steps and sat on it to rest.

The first cadre saw his tone was a bit wrong, so he stopped the chess game and leaned over to talk. "Wondering where the honored guest comes from?"

Yun Suji saw he was a village cadre but deliberately asked again: "Where did the Village Head go?" As the cadre answered with a blushing face, just as Yun Suji was about to give him the letter of introduction, suddenly there was a commotion outside. Someone was heard shouting outside: "Village Head Fan! Village Head Fan!"

Village Head Fan frowned, pushed the chessboard away, and said: "Go see first, what is Yuanhu tossing about again." Ignoring Yun Suji, he lifted his foot and went out.

Yun Suji didn't say anything, quietly got up and stood by the window to look out. He saw seven or eight people in the courtyard, men and women, old and young. The leader was the young cadre who beat Old Meng just now. His chest was open, revealing the white cloth undershirt inside, hands on hips, looking very majestic.

Behind were several young men carrying sticks, crowding around a middle-aged man. This man wore a homespun double-breasted short jacket, tied up solidly with ropes, looking terrified. A woman followed behind, crying and wanting to get close to the man but was pushed by several young men.

At the very back was a girl of eleven or twelve, wiping tears and following bashfully, supported by a woman.

Yun Suji wondered what drama this was.

Just as he was pondering, he heard the young cadre say loudly: "Village Head! Yan Laowu bound his daughter's feet again—let's not talk about his wife's feet; she bound them all her life and isn't used to walking with released feet, so we fellow villagers turned a blind eye. He binding his daughter's feet behind backs like this clearly shows he doesn't take the county and Central instructions seriously!"

Saying so, he waved his hand, and several young men carried things to the steps: a disemboweled rooster, dripping with blood, several broken bowl pieces, a roll of foot-binding cloth—all things used for foot-binding.

Yun Suji thought this young man learned slogans proficiently, just his temper wasn't very good.

Village Head Fan frowned: "Old Yan, regarding foot-binding, the county's preaching team came several times, right? Let's not talk about your wife... You secretly binding your daughter's feet like this is clearly ignoring instructions!"

Hearing "ignoring County and Central instructions," Yan Laowu was so scared his legs went soft. He knew "Australian Chiefs" hated this most. But for a girl not to bind feet, Yan Laowu couldn't simply imagine—in his common sense, only those down-and-out households with uncertain meals or beggars didn't bind daughters' feet. As long as there was a bite to eat and land to farm, no one didn't bind daughters' feet. When he was home, he also heard knowledgeable people say that Southern Barbarian women planting rice didn't bind feet. He thought it was a fairy tale. Unexpectedly arriving at the Southern Barbarians' territory and just learning to plant rice, the Chiefs forbid foot-binding.

Not allowed to bind feet, and those bound must be released. Yan Laowu panicked. In his common sense, a woman going out without bound feet was equal to going out without wearing pants. Moreover, without a small foot to knead during intimacy at night, he couldn't get aroused...

Seeing his daughter was already twelve, and if not bound now, it couldn't be bound later. Although girls here didn't worry about marrying, those without bound feet would weigh lighter in bride price. Yan Laowu and his wife calculated and secretly bound their daughter's feet.

Afraid the village would know, Yan Laowu didn't let his daughter go out or let people come to the house. Unexpectedly, his daughter couldn't bear the pain of foot-binding and cried at night, which was heard. Eventually, it reached the ears of Militia Captain Liu Yuanhu.

Militia Captain Liu Yuanhu was an orphan: lost parents before the mutiny. Before he could work to support himself, he was a beggar wild child in the Dengzhou countryside. He started herding cattle for a landlord at thirteen. He knew all farm work and had good strength. The master liked his ability and strength, saying he would assign a maid to him to keep his heart. Before this pie in the sky could be realized, the master's whole family was killed by disorderly soldiers. He himself was tied up by soldiers and dragged away, almost dying in the chaos.

The Senate saved him from the pit of the dead and let him, an illiterate person, become a cadre and a human being. In Lingao, he opened his eyes, knowing how a real human lived and what the Australian world looked like. The Chiefs wanted to turn this world into the Australian world. In the Ma'niao Agricultural Cadre Training Institute, Du Wen instilled the consciousness of "Serving the Senate and the People" into his mind. Thus, he became a person who feared nothing in heaven or earth and regarded the "Senate's instructions" above everything else.
