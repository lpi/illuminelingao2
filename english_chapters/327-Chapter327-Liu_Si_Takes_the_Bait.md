# Chapter 327 - Liu Si Takes the Bait

"You beast, you're worse than an animal!" Zhao Dachong roared deliberately.

At this moment, seven or eight people, men and women, were already standing in the room. In the chaos, Xin Nachun threw herself into Zhao Dachong's arms, crying desperately, but without tears.

"I don't want to live!" She screamed and started crying again.

Liu Si struggled to climb up, stood stunned for a moment, turned and ran out, but the door was blocked; he couldn't escape.

"Where do you think you're running?" Zhao Dachong grabbed him and slapped him several times. While beating him, he cursed: "You dare to defile my, Zhao Dachong's, intended wife! A yellow flower girl (virgin)! You raped a virgin! You look like a human, but you have the heart of a beast!"

While the commotion was getting out of hand, the people in the room stepped aside one after another. Zhao Haiji arrived.

Zhao Dachong deliberately said: "Eighth Uncle, this is the good guest you invited! He dared to rape your nephew's wife!"

Xin Nachun howled while sobbing: "Eighth Uncle, you've harmed Little Chun miserably. Little Chun has no face to live, *wuwuwu*..."

Zhao Haiji feigned surprise and called out: "Oh!" acting greatly shocked.

After a while of commotion, Zhao Haiji slowly said to Liu Si: "I treated you as a decent person, invited you to a banquet, and asked you to put in a good word for us and plead for mercy. It's fine if you were unwilling, but how could you be such a beast in human clothing, raping a civilian woman? In any dynasty or generation, that's a capital crime! Do you know that?" Speaking of this, he glared sideways and shouted: "Someone come!"

"Here." A half-grown boy walked out.

"Tie him up. We'll send him to the Ancestral Hall and hand him over to the Work Team later. I want to see how their 'Protecting the Territory and Comforting the People' all day long actually comforts the people!" Saying this, Zhao Haiji lifted his foot and entered the inner room. Zhao Dachong also followed in.

Liu Si was tied up by seven or eight hands and pushed into the inner room. As soon as he entered, someone kicked him in the back of the knees, forcing him to kneel.

"You tell me, what should be done about raping a civilian woman?" Zhao Haiji asked deliberately. Zhao Dachong viciously raised a哨棒 (sentry stick/cudgel), waved it in front of Liu Si's eyes, and said gruffly: "What to do? According to reason, attempting to rape a woman means beating to death without liability. For the sake of him being in the Work Team, hang him up and beat him, then send him to the Work Team and let them handle it! If they don't handle it, send him to the county yamen!"

Liu Si was sweating all over with fright and quickly begged for mercy. He said he drank too much for a moment and let lust overflow to the heavens. After begging bitterly for a long time, he managed to avoid suffering physical pain.

Seeing the timing was about right, Zhao Haiji said to Zhao Dachong: "Nephew, you go out first. Eighth Uncle will definitely give you an explanation."

Zhao Dachong humped pretentiously and went out.

After everyone went out, Zhao Haiji called a advisor (Shida) and said: "Go get paper and pen. Write down everything he said himself."

The advisor's paper, pen, ink, and inkstone were all ready-made, and he wrote on the kang table immediately.

"After writing it, read it to him," Zhao Haiji said.

The advisor read: "The lowly one, Liu Si, broke into the home of civilian Zhao Dachong after the banquet, encountered civilian woman Xin Nachun, and carried out coercive rape. The woman was unwilling, and clothes were torn and stripped forcibly. The intent to rape is true."

Liu Si defended himself: "The lowly one didn't mean to..."

"didn't mean to tear a girl's clothes?" Zhao Haiji said. Liu Si was speechless; this wasn't a Hongmen Banquet, but a trap to catch a dog.

Zhao Haiji asked again: "Do you want to settle this privately or publicly?"

"Privately! Privately." Liu Si naturally knew the meaning of these words.

If settled publicly, being pushed to the Ancestral Hall on the spot would not only cause him to lose face completely, but Chiefs Du and Dong would also be disgraced. He would be completely finished in the Transmigration Group in the future.

"At least you know what's good for you! Someone come, untie him!" Zhao Haiji smiled triumphantly. This Miss Xin was indeed quite useful. "To settle privately, press a handprint on this confession."

Helpless, Liu Si had to press a handprint on the paper. Zhao Haiji folded the paper and tucked it into his sleeve. He immediately changed his face: "Fourth Master Liu, you've been startled." He cupped his hands.

Liu Si remained silent. With his wisdom, he clearly understood the other party's scheme.

Zhao Haiji drank tea and said slowly: "We are now people on the same boat." Saying this, he paused, looked at Liu Si's face, and shouted: "Someone come!"

Someone outside had long since brought in a small official box with vermilion lacquer and copper corners, about the size of a woman's dressing box, heavy in hand, with a small lock hanging on it.

Zhao Haiji took out a key from his sleeve and opened the lock: "Fourth Master Liu, this is a little token of my appreciation. Please accept it with a smile; consider it a small apology." Saying this, he opened the box, immediately making the slightly dim small room shine brilliantly.

Inside the box were all kinds of jewelry, either gold or silver: from hairpins worn on the head to anklets on the feet; from bridal headpieces to children's lockets, in various styles, some even inlaid with pearls, jadeite, and gemstones. Floating light and overflowing color, it stunned Liu Si at once.

He had never seen so many good things in his life! Liu Si's hands trembled instantly. He hurriedly declined: "I dare not take this, it's too precious..."

"Don't refuse face when it's given." Zhao Haiji pulled a long face.

Helpless, Liu Si had to accept it.

"You can keep the things with Widow Zhou." Zhao Haiji said with a smile, "Don't worry, the little ones will take good care of her. She has climbed up a high branch."

Seeing Liu Si looking distracted and unable to recover his wits, he added another sentence: "You don't need to be afraid. Since Fourth Master Liu talks loyalty with us, we aren't people without affection and justice."

"Yes, yes." Liu Si finally caught his breath.

Zhao Haiji leaned closer and whispered: "Help us do some things. heard the Work Team has been whispering all the time these days. What are they saying? Tell us everything. Naturally, there will be benefits for you in the future. Words count!"

Liu Si had no choice but to say: "Since you gentlemen take care of me so much, I'll be at your old lordship's disposal from now on!"

Zhao Haiji said: "Good, you go back first. If there's anything in the future, we'll send a message to you at Widow Zhou's house."

After a few days, the implementation of the whole plan seemed very smooth. Although Old Man Mei continued to look listless, he could still speak some things under forced questioning. From Old Man Mei's mouth, Zhao Dachong knew that the two female officials were very dissatisfied with the current situation and often had quarrels. The Red-haired Monk was nothing special, just "preaching reason" all day long and teaching everyone to sing some songs.

Zhao Haiji secretly met Liu Si once at Widow Zhou's house. As expected, he obtained even more crucial news from his mouth.

"The Australians' bandit suppression is expanding," Liu Si threw out an important piece of news to the impatient Zhao Haiji after eating and drinking his fill at Widow Zhou's house. "Men and horses are all being moved towards the Danzhou direction."

Zhao Haiji became interested upon hearing this: "So, this area will soon be quiet?"

"Correct." Liu Si looked outside and lowered his voice, "The higher-ups are dissatisfied with the work of these two women and want to transfer a man here."

"Mm, mm," Zhao Haiji listened very carefully and asked, "What is this man's background?"

"I'm not too clear on that." Liu Si said, "The female official suranmed Du has been losing her temper all day these past few evenings, quarreling with the one surnamed Dong. The two are at odds. Seems it's because of this matter."

This matched the news Old Man Mei told. Zhao Haiji believed firmly.

"...These days, the guards are packing their luggage. The new captain will probably arrive in a few more days. Several people have to be dispatched from here to escort the two broads back. Truly troublesome."

Zhao Haiji's eyelid jumped upon hearing this. *Right, transferring two women back, they definitely won't let them travel alone; they will surely draw people to escort them. This is a good opportunity—the military strength in the Ancestral Hall will be empty.*

"How many people are going?"

"About six or seven." Liu Si saw his eyes lighting up. "What? You are—"

"Nothing, nothing!" Zhao Haiji said hurriedly. *This must be discussed with Zhao Dachong quickly; a great opportunity cannot be missed.*

That night, Zhao Dachong and Zhao Haiji discussed and decided that Zhao Dachong himself would go find Zhao Haixie and Xin Nari to discuss this matter and bring the troops back by the way.

"Indeed a good opportunity! But for this to succeed, we still need Liu Si to exert some effort." Xin Nari nodded after hearing the news brought by Zhao Dachong who rushed over overnight.

"How so?" Zhao Dachong asked.

"The matter of ammunition!" Xin Nari said, "Even if five or six of them leave, there are still a dozen left. If they start shooting, we still can't handle it." Zhao Haixie had been tormented by the Transmigration Army and had a direct understanding of the power of firearms.

"Let Liu Si coordinate from the inside. Just don't know if this kid has the guts!"

"With a handle held in our hands, are we afraid he won't do it?" Zhao Haixie said.

"Useless." Xin Nari shook his head. "Liu Si is just afraid of a confession. If you want him to pass a message, it's fine. If you want him to do something that will cost his head, he won't do it. He'll sell us out the moment he turns around!"

"Then what to do?" Zhao Dachong became anxious.

"Under heavy rewards, there must be brave men!" Xin Nari waved his hand. "How much money and valuables are still available in the village?"

"Still have to give money?" Zhao Dachong almost shouted out. "We already gave him an official box of jewelry last time!" He had his own considerations for refusing to take out money. Zhao Haiqing was Dang Namen's "General Manager"; the bandit gang's money and grain were all handled by him. After the stronghold was broken, the large savings were gone, but many valuables were still hidden in Daolu Village. Although these things were not under Zhao Dachong's control, Zhao Dachong had long known the hiding place and specific amount from his father. He regarded this wealth as his own capital and had been hoarding this secret, unwilling to bring it out easily—although Zhao Dachong was arrogant, he wasn't stupid: Xin Nari now had men and connections in the Greenwood; if he himself wanted to be the boss in the bandit gang, or taking a step back, a big leader, he could only rely on holding this wealth.

How could Xin Nari not know his wishful thinking? But right now, the bandit gang was poor and blank; only Zhao Dachong still controlled some wealth. He had to try hard to persuade him.
