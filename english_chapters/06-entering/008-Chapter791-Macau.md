# Chapter 791 – Macau

After Lin Ming called upon Li Fengjie in Guangzhou, He Chengzong paid him a special visit, exchanging some pleasantries and leaving a bank note for two hundred taels before departing. Although Lin Ming was a hereditary Trial Centurion of the Embroidered Uniform Guard with an ancestral repertoire of tyranny, he wasn't dense. Since his family had lived on Guangdong soil for generations, he still had to show respect to the mandarins. Helping officialdom cover up matters would only benefit him. The Governor's meaning was clear without needing to be spelled out—he absolutely had to distance himself from any responsibility.

The best outcome, of course, would be to find Gao Shunqin directly, making everyone happy. If he couldn't be found, how to report it would be a brain-twisting matter.

Lin Ming knew that since Commander He's defeat, it was fortunate that Wang Zunde had died in a timely manner, giving the private secretaries and advisors ample room to maneuver. In short, Wang Zunde became the chief culprit, Li Fengjie coordinated support from the rear, Commander He fought bravely at the front, and the officers and men gave their lives… Finally, the government troops turned defeat into victory, fighting hard for a month to thwart the "bald bandits'" attempt to seize prefectures and counties… The bald bandits, desperate, raided Guangzhou but were defeated by Coastal Defense Assistant Regional Commander Xu Tingfa. The entire Qiongzhou Prefecture remained pacified, without the loss of a single prefecture or county…

This method of concealing defeat and fabricating merit could also be applied here. He thought it over: if Gao Shunqin had truly died at the hands of the bald bandits or the Folangji, the best solution would be to report him as "missing" and leave it as an unsolved case—of course, this depended on whether Governor Li and the others were sensible. In any case, he, Lin Ming, was just a "guest consultant" in this case.

Lin Ming turned the causes and consequences over in his mind until his eyes gleamed, losing all drowsiness. Outside, the third watch had already sounded. Suddenly, he heard the loud sound of a door opening and closing in the courtyard. He couldn't help but wonder—it was late at night, and apart from the guarding yamen runners, there were no outsiders in the Gao residence. Who was walking around? He hurriedly got up and peered out through a small pane of glass embedded in the window. It turned out to be his sister-in-law. Who knew what medicine this little girl had taken, staring blankly at the sky in the courtyard at this hour.

"What craziness is this again?" Lin Ming had a headache over this sister-in-law who had run away from Nanjing. She adamantly refused to return; someone from Nanjing had come to pick her up once, but she ran away again, only returning after the envoy left. She declared she wouldn't go back unless her father cancelled her engagement. This put Lin Ming in a very awkward position. As her cousin-in-law, he had an obligation to protect and care for her, but she was no oil-conserving lamp, clamoring daily to go out and "handle cases" with him. Lin Ming himself only went to the yamen to go through the motions or to sponge off others; where would he find such "major cases"?

Lin Ming considered ignoring her and letting her be crazy alone in the yard, but he had always been tender toward the women around him. Although Li Yongxun was his sister-in-law and off-limits, she was still a "woman of the house." It wouldn't be good if she caught a cold. So he put on his clothes and pushed the door open to go out.

...

Lin Ming cursed himself inwardly for being a fool who lost his head around women! Last night, heart-to-heart talk with his sister-in-law under the stars, the atmosphere was a mess of good feelings, especially when she said she "didn't want to go back to her room to sleep" and leaned her head on his arm… Somehow, it turned into him promising to take her to Macau to see the world. Looking at the jubilant Li Yongxun, Lin Ming realized he had been thoroughly played by this little girl.

Lin Ming knew Li Yongxun was young, active, and loved new things. Not long after settling in Foshan, she had been pushing through his wife to go to Macau. He had held out and refused. Now that he had muddledly agreed, he felt some regret.

However, a man's word is his bond, especially a promise made to a young girl. Lin Ming knew perfectly well he couldn't eat this piece of fat meat, yet he involuntarily did things to please her. Fortunately, the squad leader sent to trace Gao Shunqin hadn't returned yet, and a trip to Macau would only take two days—it wouldn't delay matters. Although Macau was Folangji territory, it was still under the jurisdiction of the Xiangshan Assistant Magistrate. As a dignified Trial Centurion of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, the Assistant Magistrate would naturally do his best to look after him, so no problems should arise.

"Who are you?!" Gao Shunqin asked in a low voice. "Ideally so bold! Do you know who this official is?!"

A ray of sunlight projected in from a very high window near the roof, brightening the room. He looked around, feeling the appearance of this house was very strange, unlike anything in China.

A high pointed roof, no ceiling, exposing the truss structure. The floor was stone, the walls painted snow-white. There was only one door in the entire room, currently closed. The room was empty; apart from the heavy chair he sat on, there was nothing.

The few people standing before him, though dressed as commoners—one like a small merchant, others in the green clothes and small caps of servants—clearly didn't have the expressions or bearing of Ming commoners who trembled before officials.

The leader nodded slightly:

"You are Lord Gao, the Inspecting Censor of Guangdong."

"Since you know, you still dare to offend an imperial official!" Gao Shunqin sneered.

The leader smiled gently and pulled off his cap—like a magic trick, his head seemed to shed a layer of skin immediately, revealing short stubble.

"You are bald bandits!" He was both shocked and furious.

"This official is the Acting Commissioner of the Guest Council of the Australian Temporary Palace of the Great Song." The young man fluently spat out this sentence. He had practiced countless times in private to say it clearly, to fully display the majesty of the Great Song.

Gao Shunqin was stunned. He hadn't studied Song dynasty history and couldn't react for a moment to Jiang Shan's confusing title. However, he immediately sneered: "Overseas barbarians!" He then thought, since the bald bandits had kidnapped him, this must be their lair, Lingao! Since being kidnapped, he had been half-conscious, his memory very clear. He firmly remembered being put on a boat. In his few remaining impressions, he seemed to have heard seagulls.

His heart sank: given his past anti-barbarian rhetoric, these overseas barbarians claiming to be descendants of the Great Song must hate him to the bone. They must have gone to great lengths to capture him just to torture him in every way before executing him by lingering death, to intimidate the court officials of Guangdong.

Thinking of this, Gao Shunqin felt utterly hopeless. That the bald bandits could spirit him away from his residence in Guangzhou City unbeknownst to anyone proved their methods and skills far exceeded ordinary imagination. Most likely, the officials in Guangzhou didn't even know he had been taken to Lingao, let alone were coming to rescue him.

"This must be Lingao!" He asked nervously, "What do you want?"

"To host Your Lordship for a few days. Please remain calm," Jiang Shan said.

"Hmph, you surely want this official to change course and submit memorials advocating trade for you!" Gao Shunqin shouted. "That is wishful thinking! This official will never comply." He spoke aggressively, but in reality, his heart was pounding, unsure what these bald bandits intended. Judging by the "Great Song official title" the bandit had flashed, they probably wanted him to serve the enemy with his body!

Gao Shunqin naturally wouldn't surrender. These overseas barbarians claiming to be Great Song descendants merely occupied Lingao County. At best, they were local warlords in Qiongzhou Prefecture, monkeys wearing hats. How could he, a dignified Inspecting Censor and jinshi degree holder, demean himself to serve thieves?

"We absolutely do not require Your Lordship to submit memorials," Jiang Shan said calmly.

"Could it be you want to persuade this official to surrender? That is even more wishful thinking!" Gao Shunqin raised his voice. "Since binding my hair and receiving education, I have learned the words 'loyalty' and 'righteousness.' As a court minister, unhappily falling into enemy hands, dying for the country is my duty. I will not spare my life!"

"Your Lordship exaggerates. Our Great Song does not lack for a few officials," Jiang Shan smiled, not angry in the slightest. These words approached insult, and indeed the other party showed an angry expression. He carefully observed the other's reaction, especially body language—this was the first high-ranking Ming official to fall into their hands. Censor Gao was different from the Wu Mingjins, Sun Ruiwus, and Wang Cis they had contacted before—those were all failures in officialdom, low-level civil servants muddling through. But Gao Shunqin was a dignified Inspecting Censor with a bright future, a "red person" in officialdom. Their true thoughts, will, and integrity were matters of great interest to the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

Clearly, this high Ming official was very nervous inside—he wasn't as ready to die as he appeared. But the firmness in his words wasn't entirely bluster either.

This place was not Lingao, nor Hong Kong, but a new "safe house" of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau in Macau. After Xue Ziliang's team succeeded in the "掏被窝" (snatching from the bed) operation in Guangzhou, they followed Lin Baiguang's suggestion and moved toward Foshan and Sanshui. After appropriately "exposing" Gao Shunqin a few times, the team split in two midway between Sanshui and Qingyuan. One group took Gao Shunqin off the boat quietly, circled back to Guangzhou, and arranged by Foreign Intelligence Bureau contacts to take a boat out of the Pearl River estuary to Macau. The other group continued sailing north, leaving traces along the way to attract trackers.

According to the original plan, after kidnapping Gao Shunqin, they intended to imprison him in Hong Kong. But Jiang Shan happened to be in Macau handling the establishment of the Macau Station—with the unfolding of the Hong Kong development plan, setting up a direct outpost in Macau was also on the agenda—and at his suggestion, they temporarily hid Lord Gao in Macau. Macau was very close to Guangzhou, allowing them to react to news from Guangzhou at any time, and it wasn't Australian territory.

"Guard him strictly; don't let him run away," Jiang Shan instructed the elder stationed in Macau. "It would be embarrassing if he ran. If there are any problems, eliminate him directly."

Neither the House of Elders nor the Executive Committee planned on making Lord Gao a future Political Consultative Conference member, so Censor Gao's fate was largely decided. As for when to make him "disappear," that depended on the situation in Guangzhou and the next direction of events.
