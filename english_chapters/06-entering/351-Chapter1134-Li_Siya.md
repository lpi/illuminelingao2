# Chapter 1134 - Li Siya

In Anping Harbor, many ships awaited departure. Most were Guangzhou-style and Fujian-style junks of various sizes, interspersed with a few Western-style sailing vessels. The harbor bristled with masts.

In an inconspicuous corner of the dock, an unremarkable medium-sized Guangzhou junk was moored. Its waterline sat deep, as if fully loaded with cargo, awaiting departure.

Sailors were scattered casually across the deck, looking quite relaxed. But below deck, a secret meeting was underway.

In the dark, foul-smelling cargo hold that had been emptied, two chairs had been placed. On one sat a young woman wrapped in a black cloak, its hood covering her head, her face nearly lost in shadow. Only her voice revealed she was a young woman.

Sitting opposite her was a man also wearing a cloak. From the scant light entering through the hatch, it was clear that despite his grime-covered face, he wasn't old. He similarly seemed afraid of being recognized, covering his face with a corner of his cloak.

"I have a job for you. Listen carefully," the man said.

"I'm all ears," the woman replied.

"A large Fujian junk carrying Taiwan-bound migrants is anchored below Anping Battery. This ship sets sail for Bengang at dawn tomorrow."

"So I must board that ship tonight?"

"Immediately—meaning you depart as soon as you agree. This evening, this ship will unload cargo. Some of it will be transferred to that ship—you'll slip across during the unloading."

"Very well. Now tell me about the mission you're giving me."

"Your mission is simple: make the Dutch and the Australians enemies—bring them to blows."

"The simpler the mission, the harder it is." The woman commented. "How much time do I have?"

"The sooner the better." The man said. "His Lordship hopes within three or four months."

"That's too difficult," the woman said.

"Three thousand taels of silver."

The woman refused outright: "Five thousand taels."

"Three thousand five hundred taels." The man raised the offer.

"Five thousand taels. Not a *qian* less."

"Three thousand eight hundred taels, maximum—plus a year's free use of a pass flag for your ship." This flag was quite valuable; selling it at a discount to any merchant would net at least a thousand taels.

"Four thousand taels, plus the flag. That's the price."

"Deal."

---

"A thousand taels up front," the woman said. "The rest after completion."

"No problem." A smile appeared on the man's face. "My elder brother said you're a jaw-dropping marvel of a woman—you certainly won't disappoint us this time."

"You flatter me." Though her face was invisible, one could sense she was smiling radiantly. "Please convey to His Lordship the General that I'm willing to serve him wholeheartedly."

"Then I await good news." The man gave a restrained laugh.

The ship rocked slightly. Light from the hatch swept across her cheek—it was Li Siya.

She looked somewhat fuller than before, with fine wrinkles at the corners of her eyes. Years of maneuvering among great powers at sea had worn away at a woman's beauty.

Li Siya didn't lack money, nor did she have ambitions requiring large investments. Adventure and intrigue were her entertainment—she reveled in them.

She didn't particularly hate or resent the Australians, though she felt a vague irritation toward them—because she hadn't received their attention: whether admiration, appreciation, or hatred. Li Siya always felt that, having played so many tricks on the Australians, incited various powers against them, and even kidnapped one of their leaders, they should hate her to the bone. But so far, the Australians showed no sign of viewing her with any special enmity.

Of course, her interest in the Australians went far beyond this. Since connecting her younger sister with the Australians, she'd obtained much firsthand material. But the question that interested her most—what exactly was the "Proof of the Seven Seas' Hegemon"—had yielded not a single clue.

Even the Committee members who had the most contact with Li Huamei, in naval and trade matters, had never let slip a word. Li Huamei didn't dare speak this phrase before them, fearing it might alert them. Though she needn't be so careful with ordinary sailors and soldiers, these people knew nothing about it.

Regardless, what was called the "Proof of the Seven Seas' Hegemon" sounded related to the navy, and the Australians' naval power was well known. Through her milk-sister, Li Siya could obtain information about many strange new devices the Australians equipped. She speculated these might be proof of some kind of recognition, or some kind of authority.

The Australians had very likely already obtained the "Proof of the Seven Seas' Hegemon"! She thought this, and once personally sailed south into the Southern Sea, pressing toward even more southern waters to explore, trying to find traces of the Australians' northward journey.

But this expedition brought her no new intelligence. Apart from many barren green islands and naked natives, there was nothing. The Dutch navigator she'd hired told her clearly that even sailing all the way south past the Tropic, she wouldn't find any Australia—only some barren large islands.

After this unsuccessful expedition, Li Siya turned her attention back to Lingao. She realized that, given the Australians' power over the South China Sea, their strength couldn't be contained in any foreseeable future. To truly probe the Australians' depths and the "Proof of the Seven Seas' Hegemon," she'd have to infiltrate people among them. For this purpose, after returning from her overseas voyage, she'd begun preparations.

In the expansion following their victories, it would be easy to infiltrate the Australians' ranks as merchants or defectors to gather intelligence. She wanted to know:

The secret of the Australians' powerful devices and the "Proof of the Seven Seas' Hegemon," and if possible, how to obtain this power and proof. The Australians' origins and intentions: why they'd abandoned the homeland that had given them such power to come here, and what goals they sought to achieve. The Australians hadn't explicitly stated they wanted to conquer the mainland, but many people were watching them. Li Siya hoped to use this to judge their next moves and exploit them.

Her milk-sister had already connected with them as a merchant, but merchants weren't highly valued. Especially given Li Huamei's background, which made them perpetually wary of her. For her to gain further trust, she'd have to make greater contributions to the Australians—or have greater utility.

But this couldn't happen overnight, and they were very shrewd. Such opportunities wouldn't come easily. So she'd thought of another approach.

She'd learned from her milk-sister that the Australians were searching for women meeting certain criteria as their servants—their so-called servants were really concubines. Though the Australians' aesthetic tastes differed greatly from Ming gentlemen's, from the various criteria they'd specified, these servants' purposes were obvious.

Therefore, finding women who precisely met their criteria and sending them to Lingao was the best method. She could control these women by holding their families hostage.

Men were most relaxed and least guarded in bed. With beloved women, they might say anything to show off. Even if they didn't, casual remarks overheard on ordinary days would yield far more intelligence than Li Huamei obtained.

Besides servants, the Australians' massive recruitment of refugees and sailors was also an excellent entry point. Ordinary refugees were useless, but they were very interested in orphan teenagers around ten years old. Reportedly, after extensive absorption and education, many positions were staffed by youths. These children would inevitably become the Australians' trusted personnel, able to obtain considerable intelligence.

Before all this, creating some chaos for the Australians would please her greatly—as the saying goes, murky waters yield more fish. If the Australians clashed with the Dutch and lost some personnel, perhaps they'd become less selective in recruitment. Moreover, in this scheme orchestrated by the Zheng family, she had her own plan. If successful, she'd be one step closer to the Australians' secrets.

Zheng Zhilong was currently no match for the Australians—this was Li Siya's judgment. Their eagerness to incite conflict between the Dutch and Australians reflected their lack of confidence in their own strength. Of course, Liu Laoxiang's existence also prevented them from acting freely.
