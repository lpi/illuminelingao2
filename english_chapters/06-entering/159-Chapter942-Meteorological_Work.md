# Chapter 942 – Meteorological Work

"The Forestry Department needs manpower but has none; needs equipment but has none. Given current production scale and future production needs, the wood products factory really can't operate without three to five thousand people. I've already reported this to Director Zhan. He agrees to strengthen production support for the Forestry Department going forward, with priority allocation of all materials."

"That's more like it. The wood processing plants where I used to work all had over a thousand people, and that was with electrified production. Now look at us: steam power, this few people, and half the workers only started in the past few days." Hai Lin was getting a bit dizzy from drinking and didn't dare drink more. He had an early meeting tomorrow, so he called his life secretary to bring him a bowl of rice.

Wu Kuangming also stopped drinking and asked for some rice. While eating mapo tofu without the minced pork, he glanced at Hai Lin's life secretary and said: "You lucky dog, your secretary is pretty and cooks well." Wu Kuangming simply hadn't bought a life secretary this time. His lottery number was too far back, and he looked down on B or C-grade maids. He was still eating at the cafeteria.

"Hehe, you should buy one too. Even if you don't sleep together, it's nice to have someone cook for you." Hai Lin suggested.

"Hmm, I'll go look at the maid school tomorrow and pick one who cooks well. Since Big Mama Cao stopped doing the cooking, the cafeteria food has gotten worse and worse. Only those animals on the Executive Committee can tolerate it." Wu Kuangming patted the dining table as he spoke, then exclaimed in surprise: "Holy crap, even your dining table is huanghuali wood?"

Hai Lin nodded and said casually: "Only this table is huanghuali. Everything else isn't. Many transmigrators recognize this wood—using it for furniture is too conspicuous. The other furniture is all made of 'polei' wood."

Wu Kuangming smiled and said: "You're too cautious. In the old timeline huanghuali was valuable, but here on Hainan there's plenty. How many departments are using rosewood and huanghuali furniture now? Never mind Southeast Asian hardwood resources, even domestic ones haven't reached exhaustion yet. You could build yourself a villa and it'd be fine."

"That's not the right way to think about it." Hai Lin shook his head. "No matter what, hardwood is premium goods in this timeline."

After dinner, his life secretary brought them farm coffee, Limu Mountain oolong tea, and farm-produced cigars. Under Wu Nanhai's tireless promotion, quite a few smoking transmigrators had taken up cigars—after all, cigars were at least healthier than cigarettes. The two puffed on cigars and chatted. They no longer discussed work topics but moved on to women. They started with Liu San and Wuyun Hua's divorce case, then moved on to Wuyun Hua's looks and figure, and from there onto other female transmigrators. There was a small argument over who was the acknowledged flower among female transmigrators. Wu Kuangming thought it was Liu Zheng's wife, Liu Shuixin. Hai Lin insisted that Cheng Xinxin, Wu Di's wife's younger sister from the finance department, was the prettiest. Then they moved on to recent rumors about a certain female transmigrator and a certain male transmigrator—strictly speaking, not really rumors since both were single. But romance between transmigrators was still happening for the first time.

After a bunch of meaningless chatter, Wu Kuangming said goodbye and left. He walked home swaying, thinking about tomorrow's Manufacturing Supervision meeting. He needed to follow up on the arrival of piping for the steam drying kiln—the fire kilns had too high a rejection rate now.

Lost in thought, suddenly the pager at his waist beeped—a text message. He opened it and saw it was a typhoon warning from the Lingao Weather Station: Typhoon No. 1 of the year had passed through the Dongsha (Pratas) Islands area and was moving toward northern Qiong and southwestern Guangdong, possibly making landfall near Qiongshan, Chengmai, Lingao, Danzhou, or the Leizhou Peninsula tomorrow evening...

Wu Kuangming was startled. Half his drunkenness vanished instantly, and he hurried toward the Forestry Department office.

After seeing Wu Kuangming off, Hai Lin took a bath with his life secretary's assistance and lay naked on the bed. He thought about tomorrow's work and jotted it down in a notebook. By then, his life secretary had also bathed and was wearing a silk robe. She slowly climbed into bed.

"Why so many clothes? Strip!" Hai Lin ordered, tossing the notebook onto the nightstand and switching off his pager to avoid interruptions.

The maid quickly took off her sleepwear. She had just lain on her back when she received Hai Lin's new order:

"Get on all fours." Hai Lin commanded while turning off the lamp. The life secretary's body glowed faintly pale in the dim light. He grunted and immediately transformed into a wolf. While vigorously thrusting, he was still thinking: "After this batch of people comes from Shandong, I'll have to go look at the maid school again. If there's a slim-waisted, long-legged tall girl, I'll definitely buy another one. What's the point of transmigrating if I don't build a powerful harem?"

While the *Haitian* sailed north to Shandong, the 1631 typhoon season arrived on schedule. In early June, the first typhoon struck Dongsha Island. The engineering team mining guano there suffered significant losses: one steam launch sank; two empty hundred-ton-class Fujianese junks waiting to load guano capsized on reefs. The dock crane collapsed, a section of pier was damaged, and over ten people died or went missing.

The typhoon passing Dongsha Island gave Hainan several hours of warning. The weather station stationed on Dongsha immediately sent a telegram after the typhoon passed. Within less than three hours, via wireless and wired telegraph, all Senate institutions on the entire island of Hainan had entered typhoon alert status. Shortly after, the weather radar on the *Fengcheng* also issued warnings that the typhoon was approaching.

June marked the beginning of peak typhoon season for the entire Chinese coast. In this timeline during this period, ocean-going vessels basically didn't put to sea. Foreign trade essentially came to a complete halt. But for the transmigrators, who depended heavily on shipping, halting shipping meant their economy and industrial system would be in trouble.

Since D-Day, even during the most typhoon-plagued months of July and August, Senate ships had kept sailing. Fortunately, at that time their ships didn't need to make long voyages. The farthest north they went was the Pearl River estuary; most shipping was in the Gulf of Tonkin and around Hainan, so if they encountered bad weather, they could dock and shelter in time.

Of course, they were quite lucky—the Little Ice Age had greatly reduced the number and scale of typhoons, and their most vulnerable year, 1629, had seen an unusually small number of typhoons hit Lingao. This saved them from nature's ravages when they were weakest.

When they had chosen Lingao as their first base, it was precisely because northern Hainan was the part of the island least affected by typhoons. But now, with the Senate's flag flying over all of Hainan and the Pearl River estuary, the Senate had to face the troubles typhoons brought.

The Senate had established a main weather station at Gaoshan Ridge, with seven or eight substations around Lingao, connected by wired telegraph. Several observers had been trained. A preliminary meteorological observation network covering all of Lingao County had been established.

From the main station at Gaoshan Ridge to substations throughout the county, various meteorological equipment and instruments had been installed—both brought from the old timeline and manufactured locally in Lingao: from simple barometers, thermometers, anemometers, and hygrometers to handheld electronic weather instruments.

Ships brought from the old timeline also had basic meteorological observation equipment. By combining these for daily observations, even with only basic barometric pressure, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, dew point, and cloud cover readings, they could roughly draw basic weather maps and perform data analysis. The daily weather forecasts now issued by the Gaoshan Ridge Weather Station for transmigrators only were produced this way—though accuracy was quite low, with precipitation forecast accuracy below 30%.

But in the view of transmigrators with some meteorological knowledge, the Gaoshan Ridge Weather Station's value was limited; its main function was training meteorological personnel. At best, the station was equivalent to an old-timeline basic observation station, primarily accumulating observation experience, training personnel, and improving instruments.

This wasn't because the Senate was stingy about investing in weather forecasting—the meteorological satellites, weather radar, and supercomputers needed for modern weather forecasting were far beyond their economic and industrial capabilities. Even purely consumable items like radiosondes couldn't be used the way they were in the old timeline.

Gaoshan Ridge Weather Station had no satellite imagery, no weather radar, no radiosondes, and certainly no large computers for meteorological calculations. The only way to achieve long-term weather forecasting was the traditional method: establish a meteorological observation network over a vast area, setting up large numbers of observation stations and base stations. Especially in extreme climate source regions: Siberia, the Arctic, and the Pacific Ocean.

Via radio, they would transmit local weather conditions to the main station. Weather maps would be hand-drawn. The main station would then process data collected from observation stations on paper. Before satellite imagery, this was the only effective method of weather forecasting.

However, nationwide deployment for data collection and forecasting was impossible—at least not achievable within ten years. Therefore, the Executive Committee's orders for the weather station were: ensure safe maritime navigation, provide typhoon forecasts, support agricultural production, and forecast northern cold snaps.

The weather radar on the *Fengcheng* could make fairly accurate forecasts for typhoons making landfall in northern Hainan, but to forecast typhoons affecting the Chinese coast, observation stations had to be placed at typhoon breeding grounds and along major paths. Going to Guam to set up an observation station was currently beyond their capabilities. The Science and Technology Department planned to set up observation stations at Dongsha, Xisha (Paracels), the NSQD (Nansha/Spratly) Islands, and other locations. Additionally, the consulate in Batavia would do weather data collection work, trying to forecast typhoons affecting the Chinese coast.

As for the latter—forecasting cold snaps required observation stations along cold snap paths on the mainland. The Science and Technology Department planned to set up several stations in Beijing, Hangzhou, Guangdong, and other places where they already had personnel stationed, and was also planning to set up stations on Jeju Island and in Manchuria after Operation Engine concluded. This would provide some warning of cold snap approaches.
