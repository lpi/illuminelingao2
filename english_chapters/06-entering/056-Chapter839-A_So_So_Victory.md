# Chapter 839: A So-So Victory

"Bastards! Bastards! Cowardly rats!" Shen Hu cursed furiously. From his position on the small hill, he could see clearly that only a few dozen men had attacked from the flank at the seaside. Just one spit from each man could have drowned them. The thousand-plus men he had painstakingly organized were actually being chased away by these few dozen people!

But cursing was useless now. There were only twenty confidants left around him. If he didn't run to gather his men now, his whole setup would probably be completely scattered. He had to run down from the mound, fleeing with his confidants.

Shen Hu's men were plunged into a state of utter panic. The marine platoon pursued relentlessly. The marines were killing with gusto; when someone was in front of them, it was a bayonet thrust—they didn't even bother reloading. The laborers pushed the mountain howitzer in pursuit, stopping from time to time to fire a shot, intensifying the chaos of the fleeing bandits.

Looking out from the watchtower, the scene outside Hongji was quite a spectacle. A large black mass of ant-like people fled in panic ahead. In the rolling dust and smoke, a barely visible small cluster of blue-clad soldiers was chasing furiously behind.

"Damn, they really can't take a beating." Beikai said in surprise. Back in the defense of Bopu, the pirates had at least attacked several times. In some places, they had even fought hand-to-hand with the marines. This time, they simply collapsed before even forming up.

The marines were chasing with gusto. Beikai was afraid they might suffer losses due to their small numbers. He ordered a company of naturalized citizen laborers to leave the fort to reinforce them and capture prisoners along the way. They chased for five or six li before the main body of bandits had completely scattered and they withdrew.

Many of the bandits had been walking since early morning. After half a day without a grain of rice, they were already dizzy with hunger and couldn't even run. They simply lay on the ground waiting to die—either gasping heavily or lying on the ground begging for mercy. Some had curled up on the ground with their heads in their hands, and had even soiled themselves.

Around Hongji Fort, the bandits' various rags, people lying on the ground, and corpses were everywhere. The laborer company, spears in hand, drove all those who could still move together. They were gathered for counting. A total of over six hundred were captured. Actually, bandit casualties weren't large—fewer than three hundred corpses were left behind.

Although the marines were panting heavily, they were in high spirits. Such a thoroughly satisfying battle was simply a pleasure. Beikai was complacent—so it turned out he was a military genius. As he thought about how to write the telegram to Lingao, he couldn't help but let out a triumphant laugh, leaving those around him puzzled.

Bai Guoshi was envious, jealous, and resentful. Needless to say, the credit for this great victory went to Beikai. He had neither commanded any forces nor put effort into fighting, nor strategized from behind the scenes. He was purely a spectator. If merits were to be assessed, he could only be at the bottom, tied with Zhao Xue. Of course, Zhao Xue certainly wouldn't mind this, but when it came time to divide the spoils of victory in the future, the one complaining that he was a "useless person" would certainly also be her.

Dugu Qiuhun came out of the laborer camp with his blade raised—during the entire battle, he hadn't fired a single shot. The bandits had never even reached the earthen walls. This left Dugu Qiuhun, who had been prepared for a passionate battle, very disappointed. Seeing the bandits lying all over the ground, each in rags and with detestable faces, on a whim, he raised the GLOCK 17 in his hand and shot the unlucky wretch nearest to him. His head was immediately blown open by the 9mm bullet. The bandits lying on the ground were all scared out of their wits, and several immediately soiled themselves.

The prisoners were being counted and the spoils collected. Just as the entire Hongji Fort was immersed in a joyful and relaxed atmosphere, Fan Hai Bao's fleet arrived.

Fan Hai Bao was a local pirate gang. By the standards of the South China Sea coast, they were an extremely small gang, at most on the level of Gu Dachun's gang from the past. Fan Hai Bao also wisely never operated in deep waters, basically operating along the Vietnamese coast, occasionally raiding the Hainan Island and Guangxi coast. When there was no business, they even went fishing. In short, in the Yalong Bay area, Fan Hai Bao was also considered one of the minor overlords at sea. When Shen Hu invited him to attack Hongji Fort together, they hit it off immediately. Fan Hai Bao felt very confident. After seizing those ships, he would send men ashore to attack the fort together; they would split everything fifty-fifty on meeting.

When Fan Hai Bao's fleet appeared on the coast, the battle on land had already ended, and the battlefield was being cleaned up. Fan Hai Bao didn't know the situation on land. He had originally wanted to wait for Shen Hu's people to make contact, but after waiting for a long time, no small boat came. While puzzled, he saw the large ship moored at the shore had already raised its sails, obviously preparing to set sail. He immediately decided that regardless of what was happening on land, he would first seize the ships at the shore.

"Everyone be careful!" Zhang Dabala had been watching the good show on land for a long time and had never gotten a chance to take action himself. Seeing pirates coming from the sea, his heart blossomed with joy. He hurriedly called out to his men: "Quick! Battle alert!"

The battle between Fan Hai Bao's fleet and the *Zhennan* didn't last very long. Because the *Zhennan* was just a single large ship, if it got entangled in a melee, it would easily be approached by the enemy for boarding combat. This would be very disadvantageous for the *Zhennan*. The *Zhennan* had no engine installed and had no advantage in mobility; it only excelled in firepower and the organization and discipline of its sailors compared to the pirates. So from the start, Zhang Dabala kept the *Zhennan* on the outer line of the enemy formation, never allowing the enemy ships to form an encircling posture. This way, he could use the range advantage of his artillery to continuously bombard the enemy from a distance without letting them get close.

This tactic relied on very strong ship-handling ability. Zhang Dabala was obviously an expert in this—he had the sailors put out four large sculls to provide additional propulsion to support his steering.

This cat-and-mouse battle continued for over an hour. The *Zhennan*, using its superior firepower, hit Fan Hai Bao's ships multiple times, quickly sinking two smaller vessels and forcing one ship that caught fire after being hit to run aground on the shore—the pirates who came ashore were quickly eliminated by marines and militia on land.

Fan Hai Bao lost confidence in continuing the fight. He simply led the fleet straight for the Hongji Fort pier, preparing to go all out to seize the pier and let the pirates on the ships go ashore to grab some loot before leaving—after all, the enemy only had one large ship and surely wouldn't dare to come ashore to compete in numbers with him. But as soon as his ships approached the pier, they were bombarded by artillery from Hongji Fort's corner bastions. The shells fired from the corner bastions caused great panic among the pirates. In the chaos, the pirates abandoned another grounded ship, and the other ships quickly turned and withdrew from the battlefield.

The naval battle put a less-than-perfect end to the campaign. Of course, given its unremarkable performance, having the solitary *Zhennan* completely annihilate Fan Hai Bao's fleet was somewhat unrealistic. Although the naval battle results were limited, both the land and sea engagements were essentially routs, so the results were still acceptable. After all, the only forces that could be called regular armed forces in the Hongji defense were merely 30 marines.

The prisoners were herded into hastily built pens, and the bodies were thrown into the sea. Not many spoils were captured in the battle. The bandits were dirt poor; even though the things they had looted and dropped everywhere were regarded with disdain by the Senators—it was simply a pile of rubbish.

The most valuable spoils of war left by the bandits were themselves. More than five hundred prisoners could serve as labor. Additionally, over a hundred local women captured by the bandits were taken in. Beikai instructed the translators selected from among the local laborers to go to nearby villages to proclaim and reassure the populace, and for each village to come to Hongji to retrieve their women and property—to build a good reputation among the locals and attract more people to come to Hongji to work and trade goods.

Dugu Qiuhun suggested that Beikai should kill a batch of prisoners outside Hongji Fort as a warning. "Fully let the monkeys know how powerful we are, so they won't dare to covet Hongji again!" he said passionately, continuing to wave the tachi in his hand.

Beikai hesitated and expressed opposition: "That doesn't seem right, killing prisoners for no reason." As an administrative leader, he instinctively regarded all living people as labor. Five hundred prisoners would be very useful whether in the mine pits or for road construction. Killing them would be too wasteful.

"How can the monkeys know how powerful we are if we don't kill? Not only must we kill, but we must kill artistically!"

"I object! We can't slaughter the innocent!" Zhao Xue feared death the most. During the battle, she hid in the house and didn't dare come out. Now hearing about executing prisoners, her sympathy was greatly triggered, and she firmly opposed it.

"Nonsense! What innocent? They're bandits." Dugu Qiuhun spat as he spoke. "If they had won today, wouldn't all our heads have been chopped off..."

Bai Guoshi felt there was no point in executing prisoners for no reason and also opposed it. Dugu Qiuhun's proposed mass execution in front of Hongji Fort was not agreed upon, and the bandits in the prisoner camp barely escaped disaster.

The day after the first Hongji defense battle ended, a reinforcement fleet arrived from Lingao. Six Type I patrol boats escorted Dabo Shipping's coal ship to Hongji. The ship brought two reinforcement marine platoons, more grenades, and 50 Minié rifles. After receiving Skaed's report, the Executive Committee immediately held an emergency meeting. After discussion, they finally decided that the Navy would establish a patrol base in Hongji, with patrol boats permanently deployed at the base. Besides protecting Hongji and escorting fishing fleets, they would eventually form a grid patrol system over the Gulf of Tonkin with patrolboats deployed at various ports on Hainan Island.

The role of naturalized citizen laborer companies in emergencies was validated and taken seriously. In emergencies, the organized naturalized citizen laborer militia played a very important role. Therefore, it was decided to formally establish the Hongji Militia General Command at Hongji, appointing Bai Guoshi as Deputy Militia Commander and Beikai as Commander.

The person who brought these orders was none other than Skaed himself. He came to Hongji to conduct research—of course, the main purpose was to avoid questioning by the Senate Standing Committee, in what was called "lying low."
