# Chapter 1074 - Exoneration

How to write this memorial took him quite a bit of effort.

He was absolutely the primary person responsible for Kong Youde's rebellion; this could not be washed away after losing Dengzhou, so the memorial inevitably had to involve plea for punishment.

God bless! He was rescued by his fellow believer, the Australian, erasing the most dangerous charges of "falling to the enemy" and "colluding with the enemy." Then what remained were nothing more than issues like "employing people unclearly," "failure of oversight," and "indulgence." No matter how it was put, these were not extremely serious crimes—not matters of principle.

However, things were far from that simple. Losing the military stronghold of Dengzhou was also a quite severe charge. There were civil and military officials who were held accountable by the Imperial Court for losing armies and territory, ultimately losing their heads. How to avoid this fate required careful consideration.

Fortunately, Kong Youde's mutiny did not happen in his defense zone, not even in Shandong—they had already entered the territory of Zhili. Secondly, when Kong Youde mutinied, he had already been transferred to Jiliao (Ji and Liao) and was not under Sun's command.

Although this was somewhat suspect of forced logic, at least there was room for exoneration. Essays could be written on this aspect.

There was another matter on which he had to communicate his stance with others as soon as possible, and that was the Wang family.

On Qimu Island, Lu Yang and Lu Wenyuan had explained the entire process of Kong Youde's mutiny to him one by one. This gave Sun Yuanhua a comprehensive and reliable understanding of the entire event process for the first time—originally, he only had some scattered and contradictory news. With reliable intelligence, there was the possibility of weighing relationships in the Court and adopting different attitudes.

Sun Yuanhua thought to himself, although the fuse of the matter was stealing chickens, in the final analysis, it had a direct relationship with the "closing doors and striking markets" in Wuqiao County.

And the reason for closing doors and striking markets was very clear to him: besides the soldiers' poor discipline and repeated harassment of the locality, the leadership of Wuqiao Magistrate Bi Ziyin was definitely the main reason. This Magistrate Bi and he had "always been unhappy"—the reason related to Liaodong affairs.

Bi Ziyin had a deep hatred for Liaodong people. When his brother Bi Zisu served as Governor of Liaodong, he was tied up and tortured by Liaodong soldiers demanding pay during the Ningyuan Mutiny in the first year of Chongzhen, leading to Bi Zisu committing suicide in shame afterwards.

Sun heavily used Liaodong people in Dengzhou and Laizhou, spoke for Liaodong people many times, and acted like a spokesperson for Liaodong interests. The Bi brothers had been dissatisfied with him for a long time.

Now that such a big event had occurred, if seriously investigated, Bi Ziyin could not escape the charges of "inciting chaos" and "provoking conflict."

Similarly, there was the Wang family of Xincheng. Sun Yuanhua certainly knew why Kong Youde executed soldiers who stole a chicken: First, the Wang family was extremely successful in imperial examinations, famous at that time.

The Wang family produced fourteen *Jinshi* in three consecutive generations of Guang, Zhi, and Xiang characters. Among them, there were ten in the Xiang generation alone. Wang Xiangchun rose to the position of Director of the Bureau of Evaluations in the Ministry of Personnel in Nanjing. His cousin Wang Xiangqian had served as Minister of War twice; in the first year of Chongzhen, he supervised the armies of Xuanfu and Datong with the titles of Junior Preceptor, Grand Preceptor of the Crown Prince, Minister of War, and Censor-in-Chief of the Right. He only retired and returned home in the second year of Chongzhen. Among Wang Xiangchun's brothers of the same father, many also served as civil and military officials.

Secondly, and most importantly, when Sun Yuanhua passed the provincial examination in the fortieth year of Wanli, his Examiner (*Zuoshi*) was exactly Wang Xiangchun. Xu Guangqi and Wang Xiangjin were graduates of the same year (*Tongnian*), and fellow religious senior Yang Tingyun was a *Tongnian* of Wang Xiangjie.

From this perspective, although Wang Xiangchun was of the Donglin Party and not of the same faction as Sun Yuanhua and Xu Guangqi, the relationship between the two sides was quite close. Especially relationships like "Examiner" and "Tongnian."

Kong Youde knew the special relationship between the Wang family and Sun, which was why he punished his subordinates so heavily to satisfy the Wang family—on this point, Sun Yuanhua was still relatively satisfied with Kong Youde, thinking he "knew the big picture." At the beginning of Kong Youde's mutiny, he repeatedly sent people to deliver letters explaining his "difficulties."

The Wang family was also deeply involved in this matter. Sun Yuanhua thought to himself that the Wang family could similarly be pinned with a charge of "inciting change." Currently, the power of the Donglin Party in the Court was becoming unstable, and there would definitely be many people using this as ammunition.

Moreover, the Wang family and the Bi family had generations of intermarriage relationships. Reasonably and emotionally, the Wang family had to clear themselves of the charge of "inciting change."

The Wang family might use him as a scapegoat and push the blame onto him. But thinking carefully, the possibility wasn't high. First, doing so would only push the bureaucrats of Xu Guangqi's faction to the opposite side—this would be of no benefit to the Donglin Party itself. Secondly, regarding whether it was "inciting change," he as the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou obviously had the most say. If he firmly insisted the Wang family had significant responsibility, the Wang family couldn't wash themselves clean either.

As long as he explained the pros and cons clearly, even if the Wang family didn't help when the time came, they wouldn't hit a person who was down.

Of course, this matter still required the big shots in the Court to try their best to exonerate him—it would require a large amount of spending on bribes.

Money, he certainly had. Sun Yuanhua was not a "clean official" in the traditional Chinese sense. He had the ability to handle affairs, but he himself was not incorruptible. He entered officialdom through recommendation as an advisor and rose to an important post like Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou in less than ten years. Besides his own ability, it was firstly due to the protection of his teacher and relative Xu Guangqi in the Court, and secondly due to the spending and bribery on Zhou Yanru.

Sun Yuanhua had done plenty of things like soliciting office and buying office. Moreover, in the environment where "government comes from bribery" had already formed in the Court at that time, anyone's political views and insights needed large amounts of spending to be recognized and implemented by the Court. This money, of course, did not come from his own private purse—he couldn't afford it either.

Although the position of Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou made his purse ample, most of the wealth was lost in the city after Dengzhou fell. Now, as soon as his memorial was handed in, he would have to spend a large sum of activity funds. Fortunately, before this, he had asked the Shanxi House to remit a sum of silver to the Capital. Added to the saved silver in the Capital and at home, it should be about enough. Even if not enough, the rest could only be raised by teachers and friends in the Capital on his behalf.

The memorial was written, but not officially dispatched. Instead, it was sent as a private letter by special messenger riding fast horse to Xu Guangqi's residence in the Capital, asking him to deliberate and revise it before sending it out—he knew nothing about the situation in the Court right now, fearing that saying something inappropriate in the memorial would cause trouble for himself instead.

While Sun Yuanhua was engaging in tense activities, the Shandong Forward Command simultaneously sent a telegram. Upon receiving the telegram, Xu Ke immediately issued instructions to intelligence agencies in the Capital, Hangzhou, and Nanjing. The intelligence agencies set up the previous year began to operate. The Engine Forward Command's order to the Foreign Intelligence Bureau was: Try to keep Sun Yuanhua's official position, striving for specific retention in office despite dismissal; if not possible, strive for Sun Yuanhua to serve in the army to atone for his crimes after dismissal. In short, try to keep Sun Yuanhua in Shandong.

When Leng Ningyun received the telegram, he was settling accounts with a calculator in the study of his money house, wrapped in a thick fur robe.

His current appearance and style, except for lacking a pigtail, were very much like the Jin Merchants in TV dramas. Including the heated kang under his buttocks—winter in 17th-century Beijing was really no joke. A teapot left in the room at night would be frozen solid by morning.

Fortunately, the thick hair bun acted as a hat, offsetting a lot of chill. Thinking that group of "Manchu Warriors" with gold-coin rat-tails in the Great Qing survived in places of even higher latitude, Leng Ningyun had to admire their cold resistance.

"Damn it," he shivered as he picked up the telegram, thinking he definitely had to do some infrastructure construction this spring, getting some heating and sanitary bath or something. he had enough of the dry toilet in the courtyard and bathing in a wooden bucket.

He had been in the Capital for half a year, opening shops, finding connections, various social engagements... He spent a lot of money from beginning to end. These moneys were public funds and had to be properly cleaned up and reported.

The confidential clerk brought him the telegram, and he looked at it carefully. This task had actually been assigned months ago. Leng Ningyun's task was to try to go through Eunuch Yang's relationship and take the eunuch route. Wang Dehua, Gao Qiqian, and these "Inner Ministers" were now red-hot figures. If they could come out and say a few words for Sun Yuanhua and help secretly, Sun Yuanhua would not only not die an unnatural death but might possibly remain in office in Dengzhou and Laizhou.

The closer to the end of a dynasty, the easier it was to manipulate the inversion of black and white. Leng Ningyun had no doubt about this—what troubled him was how to effectively connect with Wang Dehua's line—this was a quite difficult thing.

Although Eunuch Yang was in charge of the Directorate of Imperial Music (Bell and Drum Office), he was not a direct subordinate of Wang Dehua and others, nor was he a "Dragon-following Eunuch" from the Prince of Xin's residence. Although he was re-employed by fawning on Wang Dehua, he was actually still outside the core power of the palace.

His request, in terms of motive, was not surprising—the shopkeepers of large commercial firms in the Capital were almost all "request agents," and high-ranking officials also often regarded large commercial firms as "firewalls" and "introducers" for taking bribes. The key lay in the fact that Eunuch Yang might play the trick of "taking money without doing work."

Leng Ningyun knew: Even if Eunuch Yang couldn't help at all with this matter, he would still put on an unfathomable expression and swallow the silver without shame, then sigh compassionately "what a pity" after Sun Yuanhua's head fell.

"Eunuchs are unreliable!" This was the experience Leng Ningyun summarized after coming to the Capital to run a money house. Similar ones included "Officials are equally unreliable."

His first task was to confirm whether Eunuch Yang had the ability to help with this matter.

Leng Ningyun pondered for a moment, called Wu Kaidi over, and discussed the matter to be handled with him.

"Go ask around. Can Eunuch Yang speak to Wang Dehua? Can we ask him for help?"

"I understand." Wu Kaidi nodded. "Eunuch Wang has been very popular recently. Eunuch Yang should be very diligent."

"Asking him to do things is not as simple as just fawning well."

"The Chief is right," Wu Kaidi said. "However, asking for favors is nothing more than the word 'money.' As long as the money is spent, there is no worry about not getting it done."

"This matter is not as simple as spending money—after all, we are going through a middleman." Leng Ningyun explained his worries to Wu Kaidi.
