# Chapter 897 - Worse than Beasts

Yuan Ziguang knew the recent propaganda theme was related to "Operation Engine." The literature and propaganda department was preparing public opinion. His gaze fell on the propaganda posters and slogans pasted on the classroom walls—all recently replaced. posters and slogans were printed using woodblock printing. The theme of the posters was the "Refugee Illustration" series: "Natural and Man-made Disasters," "Displaced and Destitute," "Selling Children," and "Starved Corpses on the Road." The characters' expressions and movements were rich—though only line drawings printed in monochrome, they were extremely vivid. He didn't know which art-student Elder's hand they came from, or more likely from some comic book in the Grand Library.

Finally, a slogan: "Do not forget the millions of suffering people of the Great Ming!"

Yuan Ziguang felt Ding Ding would definitely be satisfied with this layout. He coughed once and began his lecture methodically.

Before D-Day, Yuan Ziguang was a genuine junior high math teacher, graduated from a regular normal university. Both parents alive. Family well-off: father was an Air Force pilot, mother a primary school teacher. Except for temporarily lacking a sister/girlfriend, he didn't look like someone who could make up his mind to transmigrate.

However, Yuan Ziguang had a reason he had to transmigrate: he pushed down his own student, and it was a forced push. Although the matter hadn't been exposed, Yuan Ziguang knew he wouldn't have a good end once it was. Thus he resolutely chose to leave the old world and start over in a brand new world.

Of course, he never revealed this past to the "Organization." He was very clear that although half of this bunch of Elders claimed to be lolicons, if this kind of thing became known, he would definitely be thoroughly despised. He would have a handle against him, and naturally could forget about being "put in an important position."

Because he had a teacher's certificate, Yuan Ziguang received favor from Hu Qingbai, head of the education department—there were many who wanted to be teachers, especially Elders wanting to be teachers in simple normal classes, but most weren't teachers by background, let alone having teaching experience. It was rare to have a few certified teachers, so as soon as he arrived at Fangcaodi, he was appointed Head of the National School Math Teaching Group. Because Fangcaodi National School was in the founding stage, teachers weren't clearly divided into junior primary, senior primary, and middle school sections. Scheduling was done across the whole school system by subject. So a math teacher might teach multiplication tables to the junior primary section in the first two periods of the morning, then explain plane geometry to the senior primary section in the third and fourth periods. There were no middle school students yet.

Besides teaching, Yuan Ziguang also personally participated in compiling various textbooks. Since he was a teacher of Elder background, he was also responsible for the daily education of Elder children.

Compared to China in the 21st century, students at Fangcaodi had it much harder: they not only had to be responsible for general affairs like cleaning, cooking, and washing within the school according to the "Self-governance," "Self-support," and "Self-study" principles of the Education People's Committee, but also had to carve out part of their spare time to take turns working in the school's vegetable garden, breeding farm, and planting sheds. The curriculum arrangement was a high intensity of 8 periods a day. School rules and regulations, even etiquette, were standardized very strictly. Although the National School essentially promoted universal education among naturalized citizens, in operation, it had the style of an elite school. Paying attention to norms in every move.

"The knowledge and thoughts they learn destine them to become elites of future society. We don't need to be secretive about this. We just want students to form a sense of superiority; only then can we form a trend where the public wants to enter new-style schools." Hu Qingbai answered this way in a teaching affairs meeting regarding questions raised by certain Elder teachers about excessive etiquette rules in the National School.

"Students, please turn your textbooks to page eighty..." Yuan Ziguang looked at the students and said unhurriedly.

For Fangcaodi students, math might be the most boring course: no experiments, no extracurricular practice, no fun teaching aids, except for recognizing clocks and coins in math class during the first semester. Fortunately, the teacher's teaching level was high, and students could still follow. Of course, it was inevitable some students would zone out, but Yuan Ziguang's chalk-throwing technique, superior to other teachers, would timely remind distracted students.

The 40-minute class finished quickly. Yuan Ziguang assigned today's homework and review points. There was another applied mathematics class this afternoon teaching practical math: simple geometry for measuring fields and canal dimensions, commercial calculations for doing business, abacus... This course focused on practicality and was somewhat more interesting compared to the pure theoretical math class in the morning.

The loud music of "Athletes' March" began to ring from the loudspeakers outside. This was the signal for break time calisthenics. Like soldiers hearing the bugle, all students stood up immediately. The class monitor stepped out, trotted to the podium, faced everyone and shouted: "First Group, fall out!"

Yuan Ziguang tucked his lecture notes under his arm and walked out of the classroom. At this moment, the whole teaching building was full of rising and falling shouts of "Group X fall out." Some classes were already queuing in the corridor "marking time." Yuan Ziguang knew that once the "Athletes' March" finished playing the second time and switched to "Fubo Army March," classes would queue out of the teaching building to gather on the playground according to pre-arranged order.

Yuan Ziguang walked back to his office taking three steps in two—the Fangcaodi National School office was located in a Baroque-style three-story building overlooking the entire playground. Red exposed brick walls stood on high stone foundations; triangular roofs were covered with flat tiles. A light rain a few days ago had washed the tiles clean, shining under the sun. The center of the building was a clock tower: originally intended to install a large clock—one of the many large clocks promised by Doctor Zhong. Of course, the current status was still "under R&D." Temporarily hanging there was an iron bell scavenged from some ruined temple site: at Fangcaodi, teachers and students worked and rested according to the striking of this big bell.

The naturalized teachers' offices on the first and second floors were very lively. In the large office occupying almost the entire floor, neat office desks were arranged in rows, looking just like a classroom, and there was also a podium and blackboard at the end. To make up for the lack of knowledge of naturalized teachers, Hu Qingbai specially spent one day a week inviting Elders to give classes to naturalized teachers, conducting "in-service training." It could also be used to hold staff meetings.

The so-called naturalized teachers were mostly female students from the first Simple Normal Class who graduated only a few months ago. Most were girls aged fifteen or sixteen, with a few eighteen or nineteen. The Senate held deep distrust toward traditional "scholars," so very few child scholars (Tongsheng) or cultivated talents (Xiucai) among naturalized citizens entered the education system.

Some of them had received a bit of traditional education before and knew some characters. But most were illiterate. After about a year and a half of targeted intensive education, most first-grade Junior Primary courses at Fangcaodi had been handed over to them. They also undertook literacy education in night schools.

Young naturalized teachers were gathering and chatting; some were drinking water, others browsing *Lingao Times* and *Gewu Pictorial*—a lithographic pictorial focusing on popular science recently published by the Literature and Propaganda Department, issued monthly.

For naturalized teachers with heavy teaching tasks who also had to continue their own advanced studies, break time exercise was a rare leisure time in their day.

Seeing the Elder Teaching Group Head pass by, the young girls shut their mouths one by one, looking at Yuan Ziguang. From everyone's eyes flowed worship, adoration, envy, fear, reserve... various emotions projected onto Yuan Ziguang simultaneously. While feeling smug, he couldn't help his face heating up a bit.

These teachers were his students not long ago. Legally speaking, they were still slaves of the Senate; every Elder enjoyed absolute power over them. Although Yuan Ziguang came because of an "inappropriate push-down," after arriving in the new time-space, possessing ample resources and power to do whatever he wanted, he had consistently been "worse than beasts"—no matter how burning the girls' gazes, how adoring, this group of rough dark-skinned, flat-chested and flat-bottomed girls really couldn't arouse much interest in him.

He walked to the third floor—this was the Elders' office. The third floor was usually empty at this time. There weren't many full-time Elder teachers in the National School. Part-time Elders generally came only when they had classes.

Because most Elder teachers were part-time, they didn't have separate offices at Fangcaodi, only a large open-plan office. North and south sides were rows of glass windows with ample lighting. Standing before the south windows offered a view of the main playground below.

Now, at the best viewing position, three Elders were leaning on the window gazing out. Behind them stood several figures like female secretaries.

Although Elders dressed almost exactly the same, Yuan Ziguang immediately recognized from their backs and heights that one was Hu Qingbai, and another was Wu De who rarely came to Fangcaodi. As President of the Planning Commission, Wu De spent most time consumed in paperwork and meetings; even heavily for "on-site work," he rarely came to the education system—the Executive Committee member who came to the education system most was Xiao Zishan. The last one wore a Fubo Army Army uniform; he didn't recognize him.

He walked up a few steps intending to greet them, but Hu Qingbai signaled him not to speak. The three were watching the playground below with rapt attention.

Although facilities were crude, the playground dimensions were built according to old time-space standard stadiums, with a vast area. In front of the building was a flag terrace, towering with a ten-meter high wooden flagpole.

When "Athletes' March" switched to "Fubo Army March," students marching in double columns appeared from every teaching building entrance. One class was one column, like long dragons, rolling toward the center of the playground.
