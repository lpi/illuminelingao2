# Chapter 887 - Simple Rations

Food is the first necessity of the people. To recruit refugees, one must have enough grain. Supplying meals for the long-distance travel of two hundred thousand people was an even heavier burden—even sailing from Shanghai or Zhapu to Lingao, the sea route was 900 nautical miles long. Sailing ships would take 10 days.

Even for healthy people, finishing this sea voyage on crowded, tossing sailing ships wasn't an easy task, let alone for a group of starving, historically malnourished refugees. If rations with certain nutritional content and sufficient calories weren't supplied, they would hardly live to see the end of the journey.

Based on their experience in accepting refugees over the years, supplying thin gruel with added vegetables was a food beneficial to refugees' weak stomachs. After their stomachs gradually adapted, protein foods—mainly seafood—would be added to the gruel to strengthen their physical constitution.

In quarantine camps, simply using unpolished rice and sweet potatoes to make gruel or other foods was easy. But ordinary grain not only failed to meet Lingao's management and nutritional requirements, but was also quite inconvenient in transport and usage. Cooking gruel for hundreds of people in a tiny ship galley was extremely difficult. Simple, easy-to-eat food must be supplied.

Hong Huangnan's supply plan referenced the past "Operation Pillar" landing in Sanya—supplying each ship with enough Grassland Instant Rations. This series of instant rations had developed very maturely: there were already three major series with twelve varieties. Including different flavors and ingredients, the sub-varieties were even more numerous. This series not only completely met standards in nutrition and calories but also had greatly improved taste.

But this plan was vetoed by Wu De: distributing Grassland Rations in large quantities was too expensive. Moreover, stocks of Grassland Rations were insufficient, including the portion stored in army warehouses. There were only 1.5 campaign stocks. The nutritional structure was also unreasonable. Grassland Rations were high-calorie rations used to replenish physical energy consumed in intense combat marches, so the ingredients contained relatively high protein and fat.

Rich protein and fat were hard for refugees' weak stomachs to bear. Furthermore, human digestion and metabolism of protein required extra consumption of large amounts of fresh water, easily causing thirst. This added water supply pressure to refugee ships crowded with people and having limited water storage.

Wu De then handed this matter to the Agricultural Committee and the Food Factory, asking them to develop a relief ration specifically for relieving vagrants and refugees.

The biggest difference between relief rations and the Grassland series rations was cost—compared to the varied and comprehensive Grassland series, relief rations considered mass, low-cost production under the condition of guaranteeing energy and basic nutrition.

This matter fell on勋 Suji's head—as the director of the Food Factory, he was naturally duty-bound. Xun Suji was married with a family; at home, both big and small wives served him attentively. More importantly, no "family fighting" drama occurred between Liu Meilan and Kim Hee-sun. The family relationship was relatively harmonious. With a harmonious family, everything prospers; Factory Director Xun not only enjoyed the blessing of two wives but was also full of energy in his work.

After receiving the task, he immediately gathered the group who had originally developed the Grassland Rations to discuss how to manufacture relief rations.

The Relief Ration Conference was held at the Lotus Pavilion in Nanhai Farm. Unlike the cafe, this place was deliberately created "rural scenery." compared to the past, the environment around the Lotus Pavilion had been deliberately renovated. Beside the pond full of lotus leaves, the large gazebo originally made of bamboo and straw had been rebuilt into a three-room waterside pavilion with a wooden terrace, surrounded by fruit trees and willows. The bamboo fence was covered with green pumpkin vines.

Being there felt very much like certain heavily manicured "agritainment" resorts in the old time-space.

Besides the original developers from the Agricultural Committee and "enthusiastic individuals," Bai Duolu also stepped in. His enthusiasm for relief rations was entirely due to the needs of missionary work in the Li minority areas. Agricultural production in Li areas was more backward than in Han areas, especially among the Raw Li, who practiced slash-and-burn cultivation; food shortages in villages were a common phenomenon. The church often used distributing relief grain as a means of preaching. Thus, the Lingao Monastery urgently needed a cheap relief ration.

Those who developed the Grassland Rations back then were basically a bunch of "military ration enthusiasts." There were plenty of elders who sat at home in pajamas eating military instant rations bought at high prices, familiar with everything from MREs, British 24-hour rations, French heating rations, to Type 06 individual self-heating food.

Now, developing a relief ration was like hitting everyone's G-spot. Many people came to the Lotus Pavilion; some who weren't on the attendee list took time out of their busy schedules to come.

According to the refugee supply standards set by Chen Sigen: the food supply standard for a refugee during "transport by vehicle/vessel" was 1790 kcal per day. This roughly corresponded to the supply standard in German POW camps during WWII, guaranteeing no starvation death. Of course, refugees being transported neither drilled nor did any work. Children, pregnant/nursing women, and the sick had separate supply standards.

Wu Nanhai suggested: Prioritize sweet potato flour as raw material—not sweet potato starch. Sweet potato starch is pure starch, while sweet potato flour is ground directly after slicing and drying sweet potatoes, containing a large amount of fiber.

Lingao's reserves of dried sweet potatoes and sweet potato flour were huge. The Heaven and Earth Society had promoted improved sweet potato planting on a large scale in Lingao. Both state farms and ordinary farmers produced massive amounts of sweet potatoes. It could be said raw material supply was very sufficient. It had become an important raw material for Lingao's food industry.

Besides sweet potato flour, there was a small amount of protein. Wu Nanhai suggested adding a small amount of bean flour or bean dregs. Leguminous crops were widely planted in Lingao's new crop rotation system as nitrogen-fixing crops. Except for soybeans used for pressing oil and making tofu which were in tight supply, reserves of broad beans, peas, black beans, chickpeas, etc., in the grain depots were still quite considerable.

"...Add sugar and salt, mix in some dried vegetables. If bean dregs aren't enough, mix in fish powder, and finally dry into blocks," Wu Nanhai said.

Ye Yuming said: "Why make bricks? Wasting labor. I think it's unnecessary. Purely considering low cost, dried sweet potatoes are fine—we have huge reserves of this stuff, and it doesn't spoil easily. Load a few hundred gunny sacks on each ship, distribute some to refugees every meal. Guaranteed 500 grams of dried sweet potatoes a day ensures no starvation death. But we must provide some soup: refugees can't go without salt."

He proposed: manufacturing concentrated dehydrated seasoning bricks: a 3-in-1 concentrated soup block of miso, kelp, and dried vegetables.

Miso soup made from this soup block was a common dish in both Japan and Korea, nutritious, though the taste wasn't great.

"If willing, we can add some dehydrated vegetables or dried fish to the miso soup to supplement nutrition. Sweet potatoes have high fiber content, so there's no need to supplement cellulose anymore."

Hong Huangnan continued to advocate his potato flour plan. He had a special fondness for potatoes and always advocated for the army and laborers to eat more potatoes.

"Still the plan I mentioned before: dehydrated potato flour, animal fat, spices mixed. Add water and boil into mashed potatoes when eating. Potatoes are nutritious and can completely replace rice and grain. If we calculate replacing supply for 5000 soldiers, each person consumes half a kg of rice grain daily. Eating mashed potatoes for one day a week saves 2500 kg of rice weekly, 10,000 kg monthly. This figure is very impressive. Refugees certainly can eat it too. I think protein is unnecessary for sea-transported refugees; digesting protein requires water. It's better to add fat."

"I want the fat myself." General Staff representative Dongmen Chuiyu said, "Fat is something even elders don't get enough of, and you want to give it to refugees? Besides, we haven't planted potatoes on a large scale at all."

"Potatoes have a short planting period and high yield; they can be vegetables or staple food. Surplus potatoes can be dehydrated into flour for long-term storage! I never understood why the agricultural department doesn't like promoting potatoes?"

"Lingao's climate isn't suitable for planting potatoes; better to promote them when we reach the north," Wu Nanhai said. The experimental fields in Nanhai Farm had potato plantings—purely to maintain seed stock, with no intention of promotion. Based on small-scale planting, yields weren't as high as in the north, offering no advantage compared to the sweet potatoes planted.

Potato yield is high, but potatoes have high water content. The actual grain-equivalent ratio is heavily discounted. According to old time-space standards, five jin of potatoes equals one jin of rice.

After discussion, the finally decided relief ration plan was named the "Simple Rations" series. Simple Ration No. 1 was a sweet potato flour "biscuit." In a half-jin standard brick containing two biscuit blocks, there was a mix of salty, sweet, and plain flavors. Simultaneously finalized for production was "No. 1 Instant Soup Block," aka the "miso soup" Ye Yuming bragged about. Manufacturing miso required beans or rice/wheat; raw materials were limited, so it could only be produced in small quantities. One No. 1 Instant Soup Block could boil miso soup for ten people.

The Simple Rations series later developed into comprehensive supply rations like the Grassland series. However, its varieties were fewer, simply classified by usage. Uses were divided into "On-site Relief," "Camp Relief," "Vehicle/Vessel Transport Relief," and "Hiking Relief." Each variety was further divided into Winter Type and Ordinary Type. Each ration had different calories and nutritional content.

However, the content of relief rations produced in each batch varied greatly. Depending on the season of production, the expansion of territory controlled by the Elder Council, and the improvement of agricultural production levels, ration content constantly changed. There were luxury versions with unpolished rice flour and whole wheat flour mixed with minced dried meat, and simplified versions during tight periods with just sweet potato flour plus some sweet potato leaves and fish powder. Overall, the weight, dimensions, calories, and nutritional content of each batch of relief rations didn't differ significantly.
