# Chapter 1007 Project 2300

Due to extremely urgent demand for explosives from all quarters, the explosives factory went into trial production under the slogan "construct while producing."

Limited by the chemical industry's own technical level and production capacity, from the formal manufacturing of the first batch of black powder in 1629 to early 1631, the Senate's explosive types had only increased by three: brown powder, nitroglycerin, and mercury fulminate. Brown powder had only recently begun production, used as propellant for the increasingly numerous coastal batteries and naval large-caliber cannons—brown powder burned slowly, reducing the risk of bore explosions when used as propellant for heavy artillery.

Generally speaking, the Senate's explosives industry had a complete product range: gun propellants, primers, and high explosives were all available. Although the technical level wasn't high, it could roughly meet current needs.

The biggest problem was a significant shortfall in high explosives needed by the military and for civilian use. Currently the only high explosive they could mass-produce was nitroglycerin desensitized with diatomaceous earth absorption—dynamite.

Because nitroglycerin itself required a sufficient-scale glycerin industry, and the glycerin industry in turn required a sufficient-scale fats and oils industry for support. Moreover, glycerin quality needed to be quite pure—the Industrial Committee's chemical industry obtained glycerin mainly through saponification, which had too many impurities, limiting capacity. So to date, dynamite was only used in small quantities for civilian engineering projects; for military purposes, black powder was still widely used to fill artillery shells and grenades.

Although some believed there was no problem using dynamite to fill grenades—in the old dimension, using dynamite to fill landmines was very common—the problem was that dynamite couldn't be used to fill artillery shells. The G-force when shells were fired reached several thousand; dynamite would inevitably cause bore explosions.

Black powder's detonation velocity was too low, left much residue, and was too sensitive. As propellant for Minié rifles it was passable, but as military explosive it was truly inadequate. The Industrial Committee's engineers had long wanted to find a suitable substitute to replace black powder's monopoly position.

Requirements were: manufacturing process as simple as possible, sufficient raw material supply, adequate power, certain safety level, usable for filling artillery shells.

In response to these requirements, personnel from the Chemical Department and Military-Industrial Department proposed two plans: one was to manufacture picric acid using the byproduct phenol from the coal coking complex; the other was a black powder power-doubling process.

Picric acid's process was relatively simple. In old dimension history, Britain had synthesized it in 1771. Phenol was sulfonated with concentrated sulfuric acid or sodium sulfite, finally nitrated with concentrated nitric acid. The difficult point was phenol extraction. Without a coal coking industry, oil cracking or wood tar refining would be needed. They now had an established coal tar industry that could quite stably provide phenol, so manufacturing picric acid was relatively easy.

The picric acid extraction work was codenamed Project 0017—because the extraction process proposed by Xu Yingjie had a final yield of 17%.

The other project besides picric acid was the Black Powder Power-Doubling Plan, proposed by Lin Shenhe. Simply put, it was to improve processing methods to double black powder's power, enabling it to temporarily substitute for some high explosives.

Now Lin Shenhe's workplace was inside a stone-and-earth enclosure in the explosives factory. The enclosure was only about one meter high, with a circle of willow hedges planted on top. Seven or eight labor reform prisoners were filling stones in the middle. Around the enclosure were artificial and natural forests planted by the Forestry Department, extremely concealed. From outside it looked like just a forest. An inconspicuous dirt path wound its way to the enclosure. Beside the path was a water ditch; at every turn there was an earth mound to block shrapnel and shock waves during personnel evacuation. This path was only for walking; transport used another simple railway under construction—temporarily only hand-cranked railcars and ox-drawn railcars could be used. This enclosure's official name was Special Chemicals Complex Research Center No. 1, and Lin Shenhe's project was codenamed Project 2300.

At this moment he wore a dark cotton work uniform, nervously watching several workers unload an unassuming machine from the railcar.

The machine wasn't large, simply wrapped in waterproof canvas. Workers carried it toward the laboratory. Jiang Ye, responsible for installing and debugging machinery, jumped down from the car.

The two exchanged brief greetings, then entered the research center's dedicated laboratory together.

The laboratory was surrounded by thick concrete walls, with sandbags inside and outside the walls. The roof was a light wooden structure, essentially a pressure relief panel. Outside the room were two deep explosion-proof ditches—if laboratory personnel could escape in time, they could jump in for refuge.

The laboratory interior was empty. Besides the concrete base for installing the machine, there were only several vats of varying sizes. Lighting used natural light from skylights in the roof—to reduce temperature from sunlight, the glass was covered with a layer of black shade netting. On the walls and under the floor were rows of copper "heating pipes," but the cold was biting—the makeshift alcohol thermometer showed the room temperature was only 12°C. What flowed in the heating pipes wasn't steam but water cooled with ice-salt mixtures. Because fire was strictly prohibited, their most reliable refrigeration equipment—gas air conditioning—couldn't be used, and ground-source air conditioning's cooling effect probably wouldn't be satisfactory. So this forced cooling method was adopted.

"Cold enough—" Jiang Ye was sweating profusely and wearing a short-sleeved undershirt; entering, he immediately shivered.

Lin Shenhe gave him a jacket: "Put it on. This place must maintain low temperature for safe production."

The canvas was unwrapped, revealing an unremarkable machine inside. Anyone with slight knowledge of mechanical equipment would recognize at a glance that this was a hydraulic screw press.

"Manufactured according to your requirements." Jiang Ye directed workers installing while introducing. "It's hydraulic screw type, simple structure, stable stroke. Can be manually turned for stable pressure. Completely meets your technical requirements. The dies, pressing heads, and other parts that might generate friction are made of brass, to prevent sparks."

Lin Shenhe circled the machine several times: "You must guarantee it completely meets technical requirements, otherwise tomorrow when work starts I'll be reduced to ashes..."

Jiang Ye knew working with explosives meant risking one's head—there was absolutely no exaggeration.

"Don't worry, completely made according to the technical materials you provided. From component manufacturing to assembly, the machine was made entirely by Senators' own hands—didn't dare let naturalized citizens do it."

Lin Shenhe nodded. He still wasn't completely at ease. His process wasn't difficult, but had high environmental requirements: humidity couldn't be below 60%, temperature couldn't exceed 20 degrees. Otherwise explosions would occur—even with black powder's relatively low power, exploding in such a room could kill or injure many people.

Temperature he had roughly solved with water air conditioning. Humidity—Lingao's summer humidity was quite high, sometimes reaching over 90%. Even so, he had ordered an air humidifier from the machinery factory for use when necessary. He had also specially prepared a naturalized citizen to monitor the thermometer and hygrometer.

Jiang Ye was curious: "You're being so mysterious—what magic are you actually going to perform? 'Black powder power-doubling'—are you planning to mix in nitroglycerin?"

"Black powder mixed with nitroglycerin is for suicide." Lin Shenhe said. "What I'll use is just black powder—nothing else added."

"Then what method?" Jiang Ye's curiosity grew even greater.

"You should know that the greater an explosive's density in a space, the greater its power when detonating." Lin Shenhe said. "Black powder power-doubling uses this principle—maximizing black powder's density."

Project 2300's specific name was Black Powder High-Energy Charge Technology. Lin Shenhe had previously kept this technology secret—he originally hadn't been very confident about it. After D-Day, as head of the military-industrial department, he privately conducted several small-charge experiments using laboratory equipment and materials, then used the pacification operations in Danzhou for live-fire testing. After confirming no problems, he formally proposed this plan.

Simply put, Black Powder High-Energy Charge Technology was using low-temperature wet-pressing to press quality powdered black powder into black powder charge columns, creating high-density black powder columns. Due to extremely high density, these columns couldn't be detonated by traditional ignition methods and required specialized detonators—greatly improving safety.

In terms of power, using low-temperature wet-pressing to press black powder columns could increase charge density to over 2.3g/cm³. Such high-density columns required detonators to detonate, achieving detonation velocities over 2600m/s. Traditional filling methods had black powder charge density not exceeding 1.7g/cm³, with detonation velocity not exceeding 800m/s—actually black powder deflagrated rather than detonated. In terms of power, this was not just doubling—this column pressing method could increase equal-weight black powder explosive power by over 60%. By detonation velocity, it was equivalent to 39% of TNT, 36% of picric acid's effectiveness.

What this effectiveness meant, Lin Shenhe was very clear about: it meant they didn't need to expend massive resources developing new technology points on the tech tree, but could directly "upgrade" black powder to double its power. Economically far superior to Project 0017. This was extremely attractive to the Planning Bureau and Executive Committee.

To manufacture picric acid meant needing large quantities of phenol, building entirely new production workshops, plus additional sulfuric and nitric acid. But black powder power-doubling only required simply adding some machines—the originally stockpiled black powder could exert greater power.
