# Chapter 1005 Future Artists

After a sumptuous dinner, Trini escorted Van de Lantron to a private guest room to rest—the full bathroom facilities would surely satisfy him. Pleasing visitors from "the center" was an inertia of "local" posts; 17th-century Dutchmen were no exception to this custom.

Mr. Leibu Trini returned to his own studio. This was a room that was very large by any dimension's standards, with an extremely luxurious large glass window even by European standards. This provided ample light for Mr. Trini's daily work.

The studio, like all artists' studios, was somewhat disorderly. The huge worktable was piled with paper rolls, with brushes and paints everywhere—many were European goods shipped from Batavia.

Along the shelves against the walls were displayed many plaster heads and statuettes. Easels and stools were arranged in a semicircle in the middle of the room—equipment for Trini's drawing class.

In one corner of the room was his sculpture workbench, where a half-finished stone sculpture stood—this was an Australian order. They wanted to erect a small victory monument outside Chengmai City. From design to carving, Leibu Trini was fully responsible. His orders went far beyond just this.

In art history, the Italian Leibu Trini was an unknown nobody, but in terms of both fine arts and applied arts, he was a "master" figure in Lingao.

The studio had small coke furnaces, crucibles of various sizes for melting glass and metal. On the table were various tools for making glass and metal decorative objects. He manufactured colored stained glass and various metal decorations here—from the wrought iron decorative pieces inlaid on the Senate's door lintels with "S.S.A.E" in ornate Latin letters, to various medals and coats of arms issued by the Senate...

The Australians' demand for artworks was astonishingly great, to the point that Trini found his main time wasn't spent on consular or intelligence work, but rather busying himself completing Australian orders.

He sat down in his rattan chair, lit a cigar, and slowly smoked, savoring its aroma. Cigars manufactured by the Australians were a local luxury, reportedly only "Senators" could enjoy them. But for Trini, Australian cigars were merely a processed tobacco product from the Americas—just like those cheaper paper cigarettes.

Luxuries in this dimension generally had two characteristics: distant origin and rarity. The two were complementary—distant naturally meant rare. Just like Chinese silk and porcelain: in China, although not everywhere, they weren't priceless treasures. Once they crossed oceans and were transported thousands of miles to Europe and America, their value would increase tenfold or twentyfold. One ship's safe arrival could bring back immense wealth. Seeking strange rarities from distant places and then long-distance trading for high profits was this world's most common trade pattern.

But the Australians always transformed things, using certain secret methods unknown to others to increase their value. Whether the "Princess of Great Tang" wine they previously sold in Guangzhou, or the cigarettes and cigars they now sold.

Strictly speaking, the Australians had nothing that Europeans and Chinese didn't have—one could even say that apart from their weapons, no true "Australian goods" existed. All so-called Australian goods were without exception manufactured locally in Lingao using Chinese and imported raw materials.

After finishing the cigar, the room had completely fallen into darkness. The perpetually stern-faced Dutch servant walked in, holding a candle. He carefully lit the gas lamp with explosion-proof shade in the corner. The entire room was soon brightly illuminated.

After lighting the gas lamp, he withdrew. Trini's spirits began to lift—his apprentices would soon come for their nightly studies.

For some reason, the Australians were enthusiastic about working at night—of course, they had the conditions for it. The bright gas lamp allowed him to still clearly see a large-scale oil painting set on an easel while sitting in his rattan chair. This was ordered by the Lingao Abbey, soon to be used to decorate Bairen Cathedral. The Senate had half-coerced, half-enticed Trini to take fifteen students to learn art. Among them, several children who displayed sufficient talent had already been taken as his disciples: a 12-year-old girl made Trini fantasize night after night.

Trini liked the Australians' attitude toward women. They carelessly let females appear in public, entering all occasions, letting them work as craftsmen, as farmers, engaged in all trades, freely interacting with men. They even let girls attend school and serve as officials. This made the entire social landscape more colorful—especially since the Australians made all female students wear scandalously short skirts, even exposing their knees! Reportedly in certain special occasions, there were even women wearing skirts that revealed their thighs. Mr. Trini wasn't someone who'd never seen a naked woman; like all Italian painters, he had painted many female nudes. But female students in short-sleeved blouses and short skirts could arouse his desires more than a naked woman.

The Australians were enthusiastic about naked women in paintings, but Religious Affairs Officer He Ying clearly instructed him that when painting naked women, it was limited to religious subjects—mostly they had to have wings, and could only appear in a limited few specific contexts: before martyrs, in the sky behind Senators, in church icons approved by the Religious Office. But among the saints in front, there always had to be one or two bearing certain Senators' faces—for example, the one offering frankincense to the Holy Son was Dean Wu Shimang, the one striking down the six-winged beauty with a flaming sword was the winged Chairman Wen...

Of course, these annoyances couldn't shake Trini's love for Lingao. The Australians provided Trini with quality paper, canvas, dip pens, quality ink, and previously unheard-of fountain pens and pencils.

Trini quite liked Lingao-produced art supplies, especially drawing pencils: various grades of drawing pencils in different light and dark shades greatly reduced the artist's workload when drawing sketches. As for plaster heads, he admitted this was a marvelous method—many people learning to paint couldn't afford marble reproductions. Using molds and plite plaster powder casting allowed easy mass reproduction of the most beautiful sculptural works for copying and appreciation.

His four best students walked in—three boys and one girl—bowing in greeting. Following them was a young man in uniform. He stood up and smiled at the visitors: he still couldn't speak Chinese and could only teach through translation. This serious-looking translator was reportedly a Senator. He came here every day to serve as a bridge between students and him, rain or shine, never missing a class. And the students he served were all from humble origins, the most ordinary Chinese children. This made Trini deeply respectful of the Australian Senators.

Trini's teaching method for these four students was the traditional master-apprentice approach. Apprentices performed simple auxiliary work within their abilities, observed his actions, and he gave some guidance. This was also the traditional teaching method of Italian artists during the Renaissance.

"What class will we have today?" the translator asked.

"Oil painting class, starting from the most basic painting preparations." Trini said.

In 17th-century oil painting, the painter first had to be a craftsman. Going to an art supply store in the old dimension to purchase complete painting supplies and start painting was impossible in this dimension. Whether canvas, pigments, oils, or even brushes, all required painters to prepare by hand.

In one corner of the room were many small drawers filled with pigments shipped from thousands of miles away in Europe. The pigments weren't in tubes but various solid fragments—mostly minerals, also products from plants and animals. Most peculiar were Venetian-produced blue glass shards—used to mix a more common blue. On the table were mortars and dishes of various sizes.

Trini taught them hands-on how to select pigment fragments, how to crush them to appropriate sizes, then grind them. Grinding was done in stages: first crushed in larger mortars, then ground fine in smaller mortars, until becoming powder of varying coarseness suitable for mixing.

The students gradually developed interest in the work. First curious, they then adopted earnest, serious expressions. They helped their master prepare a poisonous solution: dissolving arsenic disulfide and mercuric chloride in alcohol, then pouring it on wooden boards—to prevent woodworm. Then they applied the first layer of material, filling all joints and cracks with a mixture of alabaster, resin, and frankincense, then using a smooth grinding iron to level uneven spots.

Work in the master's hands was always easy and quick, as if it were entertainment. Trini worked while teaching various techniques for preparing oil painting tools: teaching students how to bind brushes—from the coarsest, stiffest hog bristle brushes encased in lead ferrules, to the finest, softest squirrel hair brushes inserted in goose quill tubes. He had experimentally used Chinese brushes, but always felt they weren't quite right.

The students were eager to try—although watching the master work seemed simple and easy, doing it themselves proved clumsy. Then Trini slowly heated a pure oil on the stove: extracted from hemp seeds. Because of its mildly hallucinogenic effect, the Senate required them to wear masks when heating it.

Following his instructions, students rubbed the painting board with small pieces of sheepskin dipped in hot hemp oil, letting the board fully absorb the oil.

"Rub while it's hot; once cold it won't absorb." Trini continuously instructed the students.

The young Senator stood by with interest, occasionally translating Trini's instructions and students' questions, watching their every move with fascination. He noticed this Italian frequently cast his gaze toward the female student and was more focused when instructing her—he smiled knowingly.
