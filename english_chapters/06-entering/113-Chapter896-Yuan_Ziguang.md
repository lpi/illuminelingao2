# Chapter 896 - Yuan Ziguang

To let refugees survive the winter on Jeju Island and allow the Fubo Army to operate freely on the Shandong Peninsula, the Joint Logistics Headquarters had to solve the issue of winter clothing.

The cheapest and most convenient solution was naturally making cotton-padded jackets and greatcoats. Low cost, good insulation. Under conditions of material abundance, this would be the primary solution.

The Planning Commission had enough cotton cloth, but not much cotton wadding for filling. Hainan Island's cotton planting was mainly handled by the Li people; they planted cotton widely, but yields were limited, and they didn't have the habit of making cotton-padded clothes or quilts. So there was no cotton wadding available locally.

If they insisted on making padded clothes, they could only use kapok for filling. Kapok isn't very suitable for spinning, but its fibers are hollow and very buoyant. Elders used it to make life jackets. Dealing with it to serve as wadding for padded jackets was probably acceptable—it should be sufficient in terms of insulation. Kapok reserves were considered adequate to make some padded jackets.

The Planning Commission also had reserves of down—selected high-quality feathers from slaughtered ducks and geese, cleaned and stored for making down jackets in the future. However, the attempt by Zheng Shangjie and other female elders' fashion club to make down jackets had failed. Down jackets looked like padded jackets filled with down, but the actual technical content wasn't low, especially the fabric, which had to ensure down didn't "leak out." In the old time-space, this was achieved relying on special synthetic fiber fabrics. Using pure natural textiles in Lingao—whether cotton, linen, kudzu, woolen cloth, or rare banana fiber cloth—none could meet the requirement. Zheng Shangjie, Ai Beibei, and others tried every material they could find, even considering lining it with a layer of oil paper, but all failed in the end—recreating down jackets was out of the question for the next few years.

Finally, there was woolen cloth. The Planning Commission had bought some of this wool fabric in Macau in the past and seized some from Gou Family Village spoils. After signing the trade agreement with the Dutch East India Company, the Dutch shipped another portion of woolen cloth to Lingao. The total was about five or six thousand bolts, mostly in cyan, black, and red. The purpose of buying it back then was to make autumn/winter clothing for the Fubo Army and dispatched personnel going to northern regions.

Excluding the high-grade fine woolens that were too thin, the remaining coarse woolens were good material for military greatcoats and blankets. Hong Huangnan knew that compared to cotton-padded jackets which easily absorbed moisture, woolen greatcoats had considerable water resistance. Operating in high-humidity coastal areas, woolen clothing was much more suitable than cotton-padded jackets. The Navy always wore short woolen heavy coats (pea coats), not just for "looking western/stylish."

Hong Huangnan organized the Joint Logistics Forward Command team to write a memorandum to the Planning Commission, requesting allocation of sufficient materials to make winter clothing needed for Operation Engine.

Use woolen cloth to make military greatcoats and winter uniforms for the Fubo Army Navy and Army. At least 4500 sets of woolen winter uniforms had to be prepared before the winter of 1631. Additionally, warm military boots—preferably with some waterproof function—had to be prepared for the Fubo Army.

Considering reducing costs and saving materials, both Navy and Army woolen greatcoats would be made in the short coat style. Matching supplies included woolen or cotton military caps, plus warm gloves and socks.

According to old time-space standards, soldiers' warming gear and socks were generally made of wool for its lightness, warmth, and water resistance. But Lingao had no wool, and certainly no knitting wool. Hong Huangnan settled for the next best thing: using labor protection cotton yarn gloves currently widely used in Lingao factories as substitutes. As for warm socks, a similar method was adopted: knitting thread socks from coarse cotton yarn.

Such equipment was no problem on Jeju Island, but Hong Huangnan didn't know how cold Shandong would get during the Little Ice Age. These hand and foot warming measures could make do above zero degrees, but if the temperature dropped to minus five or six degrees, they might clear be insufficient.

Cotton-padded jackets were for supplying refugees. Hong Huangnan wrote in the memorandum: Dimensions might as well be larger—not only for wearing but also to serve as quilts. Padded jackets must be as durable as possible—especially the outer fabric. This way, after transporting refugees south, the swapped-out jackets could be disassembled, washed, and used for the next batch of people. The Joint Logistics Forward Command estimated that 10,000 sets of padded jackets needed to be prepared before the end of 1631. Warm shoes needed by refugees were hard to solve, so Hong Huangnan decided to ignore them—destitute farmers usually couldn't afford shoes in winter anyway; as long as they could endure until Jeju Island, they wouldn't freeze their feet off.

Because clothing was too crude and quantity shortages would definitely occur, there had to be sufficient buildings capable of sheltering from wind and rain on Jeju Island and in Shandong to protect them from wind, rain, and cold, while providing minimum safety guarantees. The camp areas also needed transport facilities for transferring personnel and supplies.

In this time-space, there was no port facility construction to speak of; piers allowing Fubo Army Navy large ships to dock directly didn't exist. The Forward Command planned to build one 1000-ton class simple pier each at transfer points in Dengzhou and Jiangnan/Zhejiang, and one 3000-ton class pier each in Jeju Island and Taiwan's Kaohsiung area.

Shandong needed to establish a temporary camp for 20,000-30,000 people; Jiangnan/Zhejiang needed one for 10,000-20,000 people. According to the Ministry of Colonization and Trade's suggestion: Jeju and Kaohsiung areas needed to establish reception/quarantine camps capable of holding 50,000 people. Construction materials for these camps would be partly procured locally and partly shipped from Hong Kong. About 3000 tons of building materials and equipment needed to be transported.

Additionally, the Ministry of Health assessed that medical supplies and water purification agents needed by refugees per month would be about 10 tons. Simultaneously, a water purification plant processing 20,000 liters daily would be set up in Shandong, and plants processing 50,000 liters of drinking water daily would be set up in Kaohsiung and Jeju Island each.

To guarantee steam power equipment needs and civilian fuel needs in Jeju Island and Kaohsiung areas, each place needed 1000 tons of steam coal monthly.

A ship supply station would be set up in both Kaohsiung and Jeju Island, also performing simple repairs on ships. Currently, the shipbuilding industry didn't have the capacity to set up widespread points, nor sufficient workers and large machinery. Hong Huangnan intended to build only a small amount of simple facilities locally—such as sand slipways, simple winches, and booms. And store some ship materials. Additionally, refit three repair ships. Equipped with professional workers, equipment, and tools, they would take turns on duty in Kaohsiung and Jeju ports to maintain and repair ships.

Hong Huangnan finished reading the draft supply plan just compiled by the Forward Command and was slightly startled. The scale of Operation Engine was truly not small. Compared to Operation Giant, although the variety of transported materials decreased, in quantity and transport mileage, it far exceeded Operation Giant. The organizational complexity was no less than in the old time-space.

"Just have to take it one step at a time," Hong Huangnan thought. "Solving food, clothing, shelter, and transport counts as half the success."

The dawn light shone on the land of Lingao.

Melodious bells rang out "Ding-Dong"—in Lingao where serving the country with industry and all metal belonging to the Senate was the rule, metal bells were extremely rare items.

With the ringing of the bell, many voice commands rang out from a large area of red brick and wooden buildings by the Wenlan River:

"Stand up!"

"Salute!"

"Sit down!"

This was Fangcaodi National School. The hub of the Senate's education system—the cradle of the Empire's future elites and backbone.

Accompanying the command of each class monitor, students began today's first class.

The crude unpainted wooden classroom door opened, and a youth in his twenties, wearing a blue local cloth "cadre suit," walked in hurriedly. He possessed all characteristics of an otaku: glasses, obesity, messy hair... roughly looking like Kohta Hirano from *Highschool of the Dead* or Itaru Hashida from *Steins;Gate*. However, he was indeed one of the few qualified teachers among the Elders.

"Stand up!"

Since Fangcaodi National School was established over two years ago, daily classroom etiquette had become fixed by habit. This transmigrator named Yuan Ziguang was long accustomed to such life. He returned a 45-degree bow to the second-year Senior Primary students who stood up and bowed 60 degrees to him. Then he scanned the whole classroom with his eyes.

The class of thirty people was silent—Fangcaodi National School implemented a co-ed system. Although in the old time-space, split classes or even split schools for boys and girls was gradually becoming a retro trend for the petit bourgeoisie and the rich. But in this time-space, breaking social barriers between men and women and promoting modern gender relations was an important task of the Elders in "changing customs and habits." Except for a few specialized classes being single-gender, all were half male and half female.

Classrooms at Fangcaodi National School looked extremely like the rural primary schools in underdeveloped areas Yuan Ziguang had once visited for "exchange." Crude white lime walls, wooden windows, unpainted plain wooden desks and chairs. Even the crude wooden board with peeling black paint at the back of the classroom specially used for blackboard newspapers was so strikingly similar.

He noticed the latest propaganda board on the blackboard newspaper—"Grasping student ideological trends and theoretical indoctrination is one of the primary tasks of Elder teachers." This sentence was printed on a document recently transmitted to the Education People's Committee and Fangcaodi, making professional Elder teachers led by Hu Qingbai unable to adapt, because the document mentioned several "one of the primary tasks," causing divergence among everyone on what exactly was the "primary task."

According to the latest issue of *Public Opinion Guidance* from the Propaganda Department, the topic Hu Qingbai set for the blackboard newspaper was "Natural and Man-made Disasters of the Ming Dynasty"—classes even had to be evaluated. The content included materials students found in the library under teacher guidance, as well as students' own personal experiences. Densely packed white chalk characters almost filled the blackboard. The masthead drawing was very clumsy: Yuan Ziguang could barely make out a broken basket and a skull drawn on it.
