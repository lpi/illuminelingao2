# Chapter 1032: Forcing Kong to Rebel against the Ming

Dongjiang Town, isolated in Liaodong, was also unstable at this time. Huang Long was unable to suppress the old subordinates of Mao Wenlong, and the internal strife in Dongjiang Town, which began with the killing of Chen Jisheng, was intensifying.

Under the combined effect of internal and external factors, it was only a matter of time before the old Dongjiang men launched a large-scale riot. All three transmigrators held this deduction.

The difficulty was that their one-way transparency no longer existed, and Kong Youde's next move had become confusing.

The urgent task was to speculate on Kong's next move and make corresponding preparations.

Zhu Mingxia leaned over the map, the colored pencil in his hand constantly moving across the glass plate. Lu Wenyuan and Chen Sigen looked at him nervously; as the military commander, he had the responsibility to deduce the enemy's next specific move.

"In my opinion, Kong Youde's movements won't deviate much." Zhu Mingxia said after studying the map for a long time.

He pointed to the large-scale map on the table and cleared his throat:

"First of all, we all agree: Kong Youde's rebellion is a product of the collision between harsh weather and irreconcilable contradictions—this is an inevitability, at most differing in time and place.

"Secondly, we need to know why Kong Youde attacked Dengzhou. This is very important and directly affects our next move. Kong understands Sun Yuanhua very well and knows he is different from other Ming bureaucrats. Sun Yuanhua is the most friendly towards the old Dongjiang men. Whether Kong wants to lull the opponent and quickly expand his gains, or genuinely holds hope for amnesty, Sun Yuanhua is the best choice. If he leads his team to Dengzhou, there is a glimmer of hope for amnesty; this is the first point. Second, his colleagues and old subordinates are in Dengzhou, along with a large number of Liaodong soldiers. These Liaodong soldiers face the same problems and harbor the same dissatisfaction as Kong Youde's unit. If he wants to rebel, only in Dengzhou can he find enough reliable and battle-hardened allies. Third, as a general with long-term combat experience, once he raises the flag of rebellion, he inevitably needs a stronghold with sufficient food and weapons where he can advance or retreat freely. Looking at the surrounding cities, Dengzhou is the most suitable: Dengzhou is the main gathering place for Kong Youde and other old Dongjiang men, and the islands scattered across the Bohai Bay are mostly occupied by former Dongjiang units, making it easy to coordinate with each other. Although the rebellion was not planned by him single-handedly, once the mutiny occurs, Kong Youde has no choice but to return to his own people as soon as possible and use the original old Dongjiang units to rapidly expand his strength—if he is content with running around aimlessly, his strength will be exhausted if he stays active in Shandong for too long.

"Finally, his diehard followers like Geng Zhongming are inside Dengzhou City. As long as they coordinate from inside and outside, Dengzhou is the easiest city to take. Precisely because of these three points, as long as Kong raises the flag of rebellion, Dengzhou is his best choice—and also the inevitable choice."

"You have a point. So Kong Youde will return to Dengzhou sooner or later."

"As long as Kong Youde's unit doesn't stray too far from Shandong, that will be his best choice after the mutiny." Zhu Mingxia was very confident. "Based on this prediction, our countermeasure is simple."

Zhu Mingxia suggested immediately sending out all reconnaissance cavalry and spies composed of local natives to scout Kong's movements. In addition to long-range tracking and searching by cavalry, the original route to Liaodong to reinforce Dalinghe could not be neglected, in case he truly went to the front line.

Kong's unit was composed entirely of cavalry with distinctive appearances, making it hard to hide their tracks for long, and they weren't afraid of being mistaken by scouts. For the local natives, send people immediately to spread the facts of his village slaughtering near Dengzhou. Within a few days, these stories would be embellished by the natives and reach the ears of the Liaodong soldiers, as well as Governor Sun's residence.

The speed of word of mouth is generally slow; normally, news from Wuqiao in Hebei would take a considerable time to reach Dengzhou. Now, they would accelerate this diffusion themselves.

"Finally, if Kong Youde really runs to the Dalinghe front line or cannot go to Dengzhou due to other factors, we'll have to incite the Liaodong soldiers in Dengzhou ourselves. That's another topic."

"Hehe, Xiao Zhu, you summarized well!" Chen Sigen interjected: "You'll write the report to the Senate!"

"According to organizational principles, all matters must be discussed and decided by the three of us together. Besides, now is not the time to write reports," Zhu Mingxia said.

Chen Sigen considered for a moment and said, "What you said makes sense. But I want to remind you of one point: you just mentioned attaching importance to this uncertainty. Currently, we still cannot accurately predict Kong Youde's actions. If we merely passively monitor him and spread some rumors, it won't work. We must actively intervene and make him act according to our will—only then will there be the necessary certainty."

Zhu Mingxia said, "We go directly to incite his subordinates?"

"We don't have the capability to incite them right now." Chen Sigen chuckled: "Did you forget what Lu Wenyuan said earlier: 'Openly leading troops to intercept the canal, that would be rebellion.' We aren't sure if he can pull off a job, but I'm certain we can pull off a job for him! Make him suffer the consequences so he has to rebel even if he doesn't want to!"

"Can this work?"

"Ha, why wouldn't it work! For our Special Reconnaissance Detachment to do such murdering and robbing is completely using a ox-cleaver to kill a chicken. My boys have been idle and bored these days, fearing the lack of chaos. At most, you send some more men to coordinate, and it will be absolutely foolproof," Chen Sigen said.

"Those soldiers under Kong Youde all have Liaodong accents..." Lu Wenyuan still had some doubts.

"Haha, that doesn't matter. Our Mandarin is already quite similar to the Liaodong military dialect. Even if it isn't, at worst we don't open our mouths. When the killing really starts, no one will notice any flaws. Besides, even if there are flaws, apart from Kong Youde taking the blame, is there any other way?" Chen Sigen said.

"Old Chen is right. However, we still need to select who goes. Wenyuan, didn't you get some military uniform vests before? Find them all. We'll give him irrefutable evidence. But as for exactly how to do it, we still have to discuss it further."

"I did indeed get some Ming army vests, but not many." Lu Wenyuan, considering the potential need during operations, managed to get some Ming army vests from Dengzhou through Huang Ande's connection. They were from various battalions, and some were old. However, Chen Sigen felt this was better—it looked authentic.

"When operating, tear off the battalion markers on the vests; that's more realistic," Lu Wenyuan said. "When we start fighting, wear some tattered robes over them, and the appearance will be even more alike."

Everyone had no objections to Zhu Mingxia's judgment and immediately split up to act. Apart from sending out all the standby cavalry, they also selected some meticulous individuals from the refugees they had taken in to inquire about news on the roads.

Lu Wenyuan called Huang Ande and asked him to take a few soldiers of Shandong origin to rush to Dengzhou immediately and spread various news about Kong Youde to their friends and old acquaintances in Dengzhou City.

Also sent along was an intelligence agent under Lu Wenyuan who specialized in contacting local churches in the three eastern prefectures, spreading the news through church connections.

Kong Youde led his troops out of Wuqiao County, heading north along the direction of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway—which didn't exist in this timeline—and entered Dongguang County. Dongguang was right by the South Canal. Nourished by the canal, commerce was quite prosperous.

Kong Youde chose to go to Dongguang with the idea of making a grab here—Dongguang was not a necessary place for him to go north to reinforce Dalinghe. With the rapid mobility of his men, making a detour here to get some benefits for himself and his subordinates was not a problem time-wise.

Before arriving at Wuqiao, the morale of his men had dropped to a freezing point. Complaints were heard all along the way, and an undercurrent was already surging among the soldiers and officers. Kong Youde was a veteran general. That night, if he hadn't decisively slaughtered a village in Wuqiao and obtained a lot of food and wealth to settle his subordinates' hearts, the best result would have been his men scattering along the way, with less than half remaining by the time they reached Shanhai Pass; the worst would be these brothers who had gone through life and death simply starting a reckless rampage in Wuqiao County.

Kong Youde was unwilling to rebel and cause chaos: he had joined the army as a youth, crawled out from piles of dead bodies, and finally struggled his way to the rank of Assistant Regional Commander, a third-rank position. He didn't want to casually discard the future he had risked his life to earn. But in these years, whether in Dongjiang or Dengzhou, his prospects grew increasingly bleak—although Sun Yuanhua valued him, the entire Ming Dynasty looked terminally ill—he couldn't see any hope.

Speaking of Dongjiang itself, ever since Commander Mao was suddenly beheaded, to Deputy Commander Chen being killed in internal strife, followed by Huang Long landing on the island, and various units rioting for pay and mutinying, Dongjiang had fallen into full-scale fratricide, and the situation worsened day by day.

Back when they were under Mao Wenlong, they could at least go out to the Tartars' territory for armed demonstrations and hit the Tartars by surprise. Now, the will to fight was getting lower and lower. As soon as the order to go to Dalinghe to reinforce Zhang Chun was issued, an emotion of fearing the enemy like a tiger permeated from officers to soldiers.

From top to bottom in Kong Youde's unit, probably no one didn't know what result awaited Zhang Chun at Dalinghe. He knew Zhang Chun the person; he would definitely die for his country, but many, many soldiers and generals would die violent deaths—and he was extremely likely to be one of them.

Thinking of this, he found it hard to let go.

After leading his troops to Dongguang, Kong Youde temporarily settled quietly in a village not far from the canal. There were quite a few villages near the South Canal that "lived off the river" and had some wealthy households making money in secret. He sent out his men to slaughter another village and plundered a large amount of money and grain. The generals and officers made a small fortune, and the soldiers ate and drank their fill, gaining some silver coins, so morale was higher than before.

However, a more troublesome matter arose. having tasted the sweetness, the officers and soldiers were somewhat reluctant to leave. Some even secretly encouraged the officers to simply become bandits and make a big scoop in this rich land.

Kong Youde scoffed at this: once an army degenerates into bandits, its combat effectiveness will soon completely disintegrate. Then he would just be a good-for-nothing bandit king, destined to be destroyed by government troops and local militia sooner or later.
