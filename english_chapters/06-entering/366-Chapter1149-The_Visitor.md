# Chapter 1149 - The Visitor

Li Siya arrived in Kaohsiung again, this time disguised as a wealthy merchant's female relative visiting relatives.

She stayed in a high-end inn in the commercial district. From the window, she could see the busy street scene below.

"The recovery speed is astonishing," she noted to herself. "These Australians operate like precise machines."

She noticed the newly built Customs Clock Tower and the huge clock face on it. She heard the bell chime on the hour.

"Standard time..." Li Siya muttered. She realized this wasn't just a timing tool, but a symbol of rule and order.

Her contact in Kaohsiung, a lurking spy, came to report.

"The control here is getting tighter," the spy complained. "Residence permits, travel passes, health certificates... layers of checks. It's hard to move."

"What about the Dutch guests?" Li Siya asked.

"They live in the Customs Building now. Very close to that Committee member Zhong."

"Is there a chance to contact them?"

"Difficult. There are sentries everywhere around the Customs Building. And foreign guests are accompanied when they go out."

Li Siya pondered. She needed to pass a message to Huygens.

"Did you find the person I asked you to look for?"

"Found him. A cook in the trading house kitchen. He's greedy for money."

"Good." Li Siya took out a letter. "Find a way to get this letter to Mr. Huygens' servant. Let him pass it to his master."

"Understood."

The letter contained intelligence about Zheng Zhilong's attitude and some suggestions on how the Dutch could cooperate with the Zheng family to contain the Australians. She believed Huygens, as a diplomat, would understand its value.

...

Huygens received the letter the next day tucked in his folded napkin during breakfast. He read it quietly, expression unchanged, then put it into his pocket.

Later, in his room, he re-read the letter carefully.

"Interesting," he murmured. "Someone wants to play a game of balance."

He didn't know who "Li Siya" was (the letter was unsigned), but the content was very insightful about the geopolitical situation.

He decided not to act rashly. He was a guest of the Australians now, and any improper move could endanger his mission and the children. But this information was useful for future reference.

This afternoon, Dr. Zhong invited Huygens to visit the newly completed lighthouse project site.

"This lighthouse will use the Fresnel lens we developed," Zhong Lishi introduced enthusiastically. "Its light can reach over 20 nautical miles away."

Huygens listened attentively. "Fresnel lens? A novel optical design."

"Yes. It greatly reduces the thickness of the lens while maintaining focus," Zhong Lishi explained.

They stood on the cape, looking at the vast ocean.

"Dr. Zhong, your technology is amazing," Huygens said. "But have you considered that technology alone cannot solve all problems?"

---

Zhong Lishi looked at him. "What do you mean, Mr. Huygens?"

"Politics, diplomacy, human hearts..." Huygens said meaningfully. "These are often more complicated than clockwork."

Zhong Lishi smiled. "We have people specializing in those complications. I'm just a technician."

"A very outstanding technician," Huygens laughed.

On the way back, they encountered Xu Ke. Xu Ke was patrolling near the construction site.

"Dr. Zhong," Xu Ke greeted. He glanced at the Dutchman beside him.

"This is Lieutenant Xu from the Navy," Zhong Lishi introduced.

Huygens tipped his hat politely. Xu Ke returned a salute, his eyes sharp. He sensed something unusual about this Dutchman—too calm, too observant.

"Everything okay, Lieutenant?" Zhong Lishi asked.

"Routine patrol," Xu Ke said. "Please stay safe. The area isn't fully cleared yet."

After they left, Xu Ke called a subordinate. "That Dutchman, Huygens. Increase surveillance on him. He feels... deep."

"Yes, Chief."

That night, Li Siya received news that the letter was delivered. But there was no response from Huygens.

"He's cautious," Li Siya judged. "But the seed is planted."

Her mission in Kaohsiung wasn't just this. She also began spreading rumors in teahouses and markets: "The Australians are going to capture men for hard labor," "There's plague in the refugee camps"...

These small panic-inducing rumors wouldn't cause immediate chaos, but they would erode trust in the Committee over time.

"Water dripping wears away the stone," Li Siya thought viciously.

However, she underestimated the Committee's control over public opinion. The police and "Life Committee" aunts in the streets soon detected the source of strange talk.

"Someone is talking nonsense in the teahouse?" The police chief frowned. "Arrest the agitators!"

Li Siya sensed danger and withdrew quickly before the net closed. She disappeared into the darkness of the harbor, boarding a smuggling boat leaving port.

"I will be back," she vowed silently.

Wei Bachi looked at the security report the next morning. "Rumors? Spies?" He sneered. "Clowns jumping around. As long as our iron fist is hard enough, these tricks are useless."

He turned his attention back to the blueprint on the table. "Expansion of the steel plant... this is the real business."
