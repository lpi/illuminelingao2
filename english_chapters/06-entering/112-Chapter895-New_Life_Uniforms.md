# Chapter 895 - New Life Uniforms

Thinking of this, Minister Hong couldn't help feeling some regret. The Lieutenant Colonel shoulder straps had just been put on—officers wearing Lieutenant Colonel straps were few among elder officers; most elder officers were Majors. Besides him, only Dongmen Chuiyu, Permanent Secretary of the General Staff, and Wei Aiwen, Director of the General Staff Political Department. One must know this Joint Logistics Department, in terms of status, was one of the Four General Headquarters; being in the first batch promoted to Major General in the future was a sure thing.

If he didn't serve in the army and transferred to ministry organs, his specialty would just get him sent to the Planning Commission, facing a pile of "operation charts" and reports every day, guiding a bunch of naturalized citizens to make tables. Not mentioning being busy and tired, the sense of presence among elders was too poor.

He calculated for a long time, thinking how to urge Thorpe to quickly set up the Hong Kong Forward Command—he knew Thorpe: young, full of theories, wrote a book, many ideas, always sighting the US military, a typical scholar. But theories alone were useless. He thought somewhat resentment; at least he brought a box of various pamphlets and notes from the old man running logistics back then, all core content of PLA logistics actual operation. Only by looking at notes did he know theory and reality were not the same thing at all.

Hong Huangnan was secretly worrying when suddenly a steam whistle sound came from over the harbor—not a steamship whistle, but the Central Pier whistle notifying a ship was entering port.

Recently ships arrived at Hong Kong Island almost daily. Frequent ship traffic to Hong Kong Island once aroused the alertness of Guangdong officials; the Nantou Water Fortress even specially sent a Squad Leader with some wine, pigs, and sheep to Hong Kong Island a few days ago to visit Le Lin, reiterating "traditional friendship." Le Lin also fully expressed to them that frequent ship traffic had nothing to do with them.

Ships brought construction materials as well as various supplies and personnel. The prelude to Operation Engine had already begun to play.

Wonder what this ship brought again—Hong Huangnan had little hope regarding sending personnel to form the Forward Command; he planned to return personally to Lingao tomorrow, specifically going to the Military Affairs Directorate to settle the matter.

He slowly walked to the office next to the bedroom, organized his thoughts, and began drafting the Operation Engine logistics memorandum.

Although many logistics facilities had started construction on Hong Kong Island now, most were still the most basic things: dedicated wharves. Warehouses—these were needed, but not enough. He also wanted logistics factories: a military food factory was temporarily hopeless—the Planning Commission couldn't give him such huge infrastructure investment right now, but a purified water plant was mandatory: supplying safe clean drinking water to ships plying waters in this area. Of course, when demand was low, surplus capacity could be used to produce Kvass, soda, and similar soft drinks. Finally, a clothing factory. Supply clothing from Lingao in the long term was unfavorable for Fubo Army operations on the mainland relying on long-distance transfer and requiring massive storage space. Setting up a clothing factory on Hong Kong Island could utilize Guangzhou's port advantage nearby to purchase cloth and utilize Pearl River Delta female labor resources.

If water resources could be solved, a military food factory should be built on Hong Kong Island; fresh fruits and vegetables were necessities on seagoing ships...

While organizing his thoughts, a knock sounded on the door, followed by a "Report!"

"Come in." He shouted without lifting his head.

Appearing at the door was his Life Secretary—wearing a uniform, sporting the rank of Fubo Army Corporal.

To care for the daily life of elders in the army, according to Xi Yazhou's proposal: the Military Affairs Directorate and General Office jointly issued a document stating all Life Secretaries of elders serving in the army were incorporated into active service, granted Logistics Corporal rank, promoted according to Fubo Army rank system, maxing at Captain. Elder officers' Life Secretaries didn't occupy formal army establishment and weren't granted actual posts in the army. Once the subordination relationship between the elder officer and Life Secretary was dissolved, she couldn't continue serving in the army and must retire from active service to local placement—to avoid affecting army morale. During service, the Life Secretary's pay, food allowance, clothing fee, and serviceman insurance enjoyed treatment of same-rank personnel, but this expenditure wasn't listed in military budget, deducted instead from the elder's personal account. After the elder retired from active service, the Life Secretary must also retire.

"Minister, Second Lieutenant Xie Peng of the Joint Logistics Headquarters is here." The secretary stood at attention and reported.

This time the ship brought not construction materials but the staff personnel and equipment Hong Huangnan had been longing for day and night to form the Forward Command team—several large crates were full of various dedicated logistics charts/boards.

Besides the naturalized staff team, a batch of temporarily seconded elders from Planning Commission and Finance also came, temporarily under his command. Xie Peng brought the written order from the Military Affairs Directorate appointing him to form and command the Operation Engine Logistics Forward Command.

Seconded elders were mostly from backgrounds in coordination, accounting, and logistics industries, counting as professional matches. This made Hong Huangnan relatively relieved—naturalized citizens had limited basic ability; executing orders by following examples was fine, but only elders themselves could handle things requiring strong professional skills.

The Forward Command occupied several large rooms in the base fortress. It was formally set up. The Planning Commission had already done basic supply for grain issues; ships also basically had a prospect. He just had to compile specific grain supply plans and ship operation charts—the latter relied mainly on the Navy to do, so he could spend less mind on it.

After issues of eating and moving came clothing. Starting from the first vagrant they took in, clothes on vagrants were all recycled for paper pulp after disinfection, supplying new clothing instead. Doing this was partly for hygiene; on the other hand, what vagrants wore could hardly be called clothes. With few exceptions, most vagrants wore just some rags. If not supplied basic clothing, refugee camps would turn into nudist camps.

Providing clothing to refugees in quarantine camps initially involved the Garment Factory seriously imitating Type 87 cotton training uniforms—commonly known as migrant worker uniforms. As refugee numbers increased, production of training uniforms increasingly couldn't keep up with supply speed. After Mo Xiaoan took office as People's Commissar of Light Industry, to increase supply quantity, he improved the quarantine camp uniform—codenamed "New Life Uniform."

Although Mo Xiaoan wasn't a tailor and hadn't learned fashion design, he knew the basic supply principles of refugee clothing: simplification, applicability. Since Lingao's climate hardly froze people to death, clothing material didn't need to be very thick. Refugees in quarantine generally didn't engage in heavy physical labor, so fabric didn't need to be tough and wear-resistant. Of course dyeing and such were totally unnecessary.

Lingao's textiles, besides cotton, kudzu, and linen cloth woven by Li people themselves, came mainly from off-island imports, including Songjiang cloth and Indian cloth. Indian cotton cloth was the bulk. Mo Xiaoan chose the thinnest and cheapest type of cotton yarn from them.

The style of New Life Uniforms was drastically simplified—things like buttons and pockets were all omitted. Finally even the belt as a fastener was cancelled. The final style of "New Life Uniform" became a pullover "pocket shirt." The neckline had a thin strap to adjust collar size. New Life Uniforms didn't distinguish gender or seasonal styles. Uniformly long-sleeved pullover for upper body. Trousers for lower body. Sizes were divided into Large, Medium, Small, and Children. Various clothes manufactured in Lingao generally didn't come with hats except for military/police uniforms, but New Life Uniforms were uniformly equipped with a straw sun hat—refugees had their heads shaved bald during purification, so certain protection must be given to the smooth scalp.

The New Life Uniform series was issued with standard underpants—commonly known as "Type 30 Boxers" because they were universally issued starting in 1630. Similarly only distinguished by size, not gender. Type 30 Boxers were not only issued to refugees in purification but also to the army and naturalized citizens. Even elders in the military system wore these Type 30 Boxers.

Issuing underpants was specifically requested by Ryan of the health department responsible for epidemic prevention; not wearing underwear easily caused skin diseases and parasite spread. Additionally, supplying underwear reduced the quantity of outer coats supplied—in quarantine camps, the rule was issuing two sets of underwear and one set of outer wear per person.

Now transporting 200,000 people, requiring two sets of basic clothing per person, calculated at 3 meters of cloth per set, 200,000 people needed 1.2 million meters, equivalent to about 100,000 bolts of Songjiang cloth.

Increasing import quota by 100,000 bolts over more than a year wasn't difficult for the Senate, whether importing from India or the mainland—especially since they now had strongholds in Zhejiang and Shanghai, right next to Songjiang cloth production areas; supply was ample and price low. Zhao Yingong could acquire enough cloth quite cheaply.

But the clothing they supplied this time had to be worn in places further north—Kaohsiung was okay, average temperature 25°C, supplying clothing by Lingao standards was no problem. But refugees collected in Shandong were sent to Jeju Island for winter. Minimum winter temperature there could reach 1~2°C; issuing only two sets of unlined clothes would obviously freeze people to death. Even hiding in camps, refugees couldn't survive with no bedding and wearing only a single layer of clothes—unless roasting people by the fire constantly like barbecue meat. Additionally, after arriving in Shandong and Jeju Island, not only refugees needed cold-weather clothing, troops and administrative personnel sent to execute Operation Engine also had to have cold-weather clothing.

Currently, Lingao army and administrative cadres came almost entirely from Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, etc. Even in the Little Ice Age, temperatures in these places were still much warmer than Shandong and Jeju Island. Sending these people to Shandong and Jeju Island would definitely cause widespread frostbite. Hong Huangnan came from a PLA logistics family and knew these situations quite well; new recruits from the south assigned to the north almost invariably got frostbite, and many would fester—this was even in an environment with sufficient clothing support.

Current Fubo Army winter gear was merely lined jackets made of thicker cotton cloth; let alone cotton-padded jackets or overcoats, they didn't even have a single wool sweater.
