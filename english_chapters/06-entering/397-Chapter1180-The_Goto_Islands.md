# Chapter 1180 - The Gotō Islands

None of the Chinese on the ship took his claim to be a descendant of General Taira seriously—Chinese were neither familiar with Japanese history nor unfamiliar with this sort of attaching oneself to prestigious ancestors, so they just listened politely. By contrast, the Japanese sailors, who took great interest in family names and bloodline descent, found this quite fascinating.

As Fukue Island gradually rose from the sea ahead, Ping Qiusheng, who had been standing at the railing trying to create a "historic moment," began softly singing a Japanese song:

*Tōrimase tōrimase (Pass through, pass through)*
*Yukaba izuko ga hosomichi nareba (If you go, where does the narrow path lead)*
*Tenjin moto e to itaru hosomichi (The narrow path that leads to Tenjin)*
*Go-iken goyōe tōrenu totemo (Without opinion, impossible to pass)*
*Kono ko no tō no oiwai ni (For this child's tenth celebration)*
*Ryō no ofuda o osame ni madzu (First offering the twin charms)*
*Yuki wa yoi nagi kaeri wa kowaki (Going is pleasant breeze, returning is dread)*
*Waga naka kowaki no tōshi kana (My heart fears—can I pass through)*

Murakawa and the other naturalized cadres accompanying him to the Gotō Islands listened respectfully to Chief Ping's off-key singing. The Japanese naturalized citizens showed no discomfort, while the Cantonese and Fujianese naturalized citizens all listened with strange expressions of endurance.

Since this was a commercial collaboration, the accompanying personnel were few. Besides his own personal secretary, two guards borrowed from the Special Reconnaissance Team, and several commercial staff, there was also an Elder named Qiao Tianzhi.

This Elder Qiao was quite young. In the old timeline, he had been an unsuccessful programmer and successful otaku. Elder Qiao had gotten bored with programming and dabbled in hacking. The consequence of being an unsuccessful hacker was having to flee to another timeline to avoid getting his door kicked in. Like all programmer Elders, Qiao had spent his time after D-Day at the Great Library doing archival work. He also wrote program code for the Executive Committee and various departments. The Planning Commission in particular had great demand for secondary development of databases.

Elder Qiao had quietly slogged away at the library for three years. During that time, he had also purchased a maid, but he quickly grew bored with her—this maid was far too different from his imagination. Boring work plus a dull maid had finally caused Qiao Tianzhi's inner universe to explode—he decided he wanted adventure and signed up for Japan operations. Fortunately, he had special skill points: English and Japanese. Especially the latter; though Elder Qiao had never taken a single day of formal Japanese classes, years of immersion in otaku culture had somehow allowed him to self-study to the point of watching anime and Japanese dramas without subtitles.

Their equipment consisted only of simple medicines, weapons, and a radio set. Ping Qiusheng himself had a medical background and later worked in construction. Besides Japanese, he also knew some Korean. He certainly had the ability to set up an intelligence station in Japan. This trip was the perfect opportunity to make connections with the Zhou family by hitching a ride on their ship.

The Gotō Islands were currently under the rule of Fukue Domain. The domain lord was the Gotō family. The Gotōs had been pirates—or rather, naval warriors—in Kyushu for centuries. The Gotō navy had been active in these waters since the Genpei War, a typical example of Japanese coastal strongmen. Their presence could also be seen among the "Wakō" pirates that had gradually risen since the Yuan Dynasty.

The Gotō family had lived this half-pirate, half-fisherman existence for twenty-one generations. The twenty-first head, Gotō Haruaki, had led the Gotō navy in Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Korean campaign. After Hideyoshi's death, he remained neutral in the Battle of Sekigahara. As a result, in the eighth year of Keichō (1603), Gotō Haruaki received a vermillion seal certificate from Tokugawa Ieyasu, officially becoming the first lord of Fukue Domain with a rating of 15,000 koku as an outside daimyō.

Ping Qiusheng recalled that the current lord of Fukue Domain was the second generation, Gotō Moritoshi. This adopted son of the Gotō family had eliminated his rival—the biological son of first-generation lord Haruaki, Ōhama Shusui—in a political struggle eighteen years ago. It had taken Moritoshi twenty years to consolidate power and reorganize the domain's retainers, and he was now reaching the end of that process.

Ping Qiusheng had prepared a fine gift for him: a Lingao-produced decorative steel sword, a pair of oval vanity mirrors, and a glass Buddha statue. For an outside daimyō of merely 15,000 koku, Lord Moritoshi would surely appreciate the weight of such gifts.

Ping Qiusheng set aside his thoughts. The ship had arrived at Fukue Island's pier. After some bustle, they finally went ashore. A young man was already waiting at the dock—an interpreter had been sent ahead on a small fast boat before the main ship departed, and this was him.

"Master Ping, my master has already prepared a palanquin." After the interpreter made the introductions, a two-person sedan chair emerged from a nearby shed. Actually, it was a Japanese-style kago. Judging by the build and manner of the bearers, they were undoubtedly Japanese. Although one should follow local customs, Ping Qiusheng looked at his own belly and ultimately politely declined the offer, deciding to walk instead. First, he'd heard the Zhou family's trading post wasn't far; second, this was his first visit to Japan in this timeline, and he wanted to see the local markets along the way. The interpreter knew Australian temperaments and didn't press, simply following along.

Fukue Island was where the Fukue Domain lord's castle was located, so the population was relatively dense and commerce more prosperous. The roads were level, clearly well-maintained. Along the way were occasional thatched stalls displaying scattered fish and vegetables—no meat was to be seen. Since the Nanbokuchō period, Japan's upper nobility had stopped eating meat under Buddhist influence, and this had gradually spread to become a nationwide practice. Though the vendors along the road weren't starving to the point of skin and bones, they were clearly malnourished—dark, gaunt, and thin. Most men were under 1.6 meters tall, women even shorter, many just over 1.4 meters.

Still, since Toyotomi Hideyoshi's time, Japan had enjoyed decades without nationwide warfare. The benefits of social stability were obvious—unlike the Great Ming, which showed decay everywhere. Though the common people's living standards weren't high, they lacked the terrified, anxious expressions of people fearing for their lives from one day to the next. This made Ping Qiusheng sigh—"Better a dog in peaceful times than a human in troubled times." How true indeed.

Behind the stalls were some larger Japanese-style houses, all single-story, looking like trading posts by their style. But they lacked Lingao's bustling atmosphere, or even the typical bustle of East Asian ports at this time. About 500 meters ahead, Ping Qiusheng noticed a row of long houses on his right, which appeared to have an additional courtyard within.

"Is this the local magistrate's office?"

"This is where the samurai lords live," the interpreter answered.

"Why does it look uninhabited? Aren't the lords usually here?"

"That's not it. After the lord's castle at Egawa was burned in the nineteenth year of Keichō, Lord Hyōbu built a fortified residence at Ishida and had all the retainers move to the new Ishida compound. So naturally no one's here anymore." The interpreter wasn't surprised by Ping Qiusheng's questions. "My master's trading post is just ahead."

Indeed, less than fifty meters ahead was a compound. It was quite conspicuous: the traditional Chinese-style architecture clashed with the surrounding buildings—quite jarring.

The interpreter led their party to the gate. The courtyard door opened and a young servant came out, speaking in somewhat awkward Nanjing-accented Mandarin: "The master has been waiting for some time. Please let the gentleman from Australia rest briefly in the reception hall."

Entering the compound, the scene was quite distinctive. This timeline's Chinese architectural style combined with a Japanese-style garden and plants made the time-travelers privately admire its elegance. The reception hall was in the first courtyard. Though the building was Chinese-style, it followed a Japanese garden layout. Sitting in the inner room, one couldn't see outside the front gate thanks to plantings that created a visual barrier. Two Special Recon Team members stood behind him. Ping Qiusheng collected his thoughts. Servants dutifully served tea. Before long, two young servant-looking men escorted an elderly man out. The old man appeared to be in his sixties with graying temples. Though his dress and grooming were clearly refined, his manner carried the air of one who had weathered many storms. This must be Zhou Xingru.

After they were seated, without excessive formalities, Zhou Xingru listened as the returning interpreter described these Australians. They claimed to be maritime merchants, but their conduct was quite unlike maritime merchants—over these past days, the ship's crew at Jeju Island had witnessed the Australians building cities, paving roads, digging canals, and clearing land. The interpreter had reported all this to his master. This Master Zhou had seen much of the world and knew these maritime merchants had no small ambitions—just their audacity in directly occupying Jeju Island showed boldness exceeding even the legendary Wang Zhi.

The Yi Dynasty of course was no formidable force, but for Australian merchants to make such a decision and undertake such an enterprise was beyond ordinary men's capabilities.

With this understanding, Master Zhou naturally spoke cautiously, often observing reactions, occasionally also asking about Australian affairs and Ping Qiusheng's ancestry.

Master Zhou hailed from South Zhili and naturally had broader knowledge than Fujian maritime merchants. He knew well that his own foundation was shallow, and as an outsider among maritime merchants, he couldn't withstand the rising Fujian and Guangdong traders. So he had early on cultivated the shogunate's favor and obtained a vermillion seal certificate, allowing him to appear at any time as a Japanese merchant vessel. This advantage of being able to change identities was beyond other maritime merchants' reach. This was how he had maintained his share amid the ever-shifting, chaotic tangle of merchant and pirate groups in China's East Sea.

But Zheng Zhilong's gradually emerging attitude of monopolizing Japan trade was putting great pressure on Zhou Xingru. His relationship with the shogunate was certainly good, but Zheng Zhilong's relationship with the shogunate was equally solid. Moreover, Zheng Zhilong's strength—whether in wealth, military power, or number of ships—far exceeded his own.

If Old Zheng wanted to monopolize the trade, there was really nothing he could do.

Now these Australian merchants had suddenly appeared from nowhere, and they had set up camp on Jeju Island with no intention of leaving. Master Zhou knew very well that neither Jeju Island nor the Yi Dynasty of Korea had anything worth such investment. These people's grand investment could only be aimed at one thing: the fat prize of Sino-Japanese trade.
