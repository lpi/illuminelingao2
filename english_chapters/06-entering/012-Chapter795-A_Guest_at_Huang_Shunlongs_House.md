# Chapter 795 – A Guest at Huang Shunlong's House

Water sources in Hong Kong were mainly concentrated in the mountainous areas, while surface water congregated around Wong Nai Chung Gap. There were several mountain basins suitable for building earth dams and constructing so-called "reservoirs." In Hong Kong of the old time-space, besides building reservoirs in the mountains, water supply also relied on establishing protected parks and planting trees in mountainous areas to increase water retention.

"We adopt similar measures: consolidate small settlements, reduce the impact of human activities on the mountains, and afforest where necessary. A base population of thirty thousand is actually conservative," Mei Lin seemed confident.

"Is a guaranteed volume for only thirty thousand people enough for industry?"

"Of course industrial demand is considered," Mei Lin said. "In 1634, we start another large reservoir on Lantau Island."

Lantau Island had a Shek Pik Reservoir, with a capacity of 24.55 million cubic meters, the largest among Hong Kong's mountain reservoirs. The main dam was 718 meters long, 354 meters wide, and 54 meters high. The earthwork was 4,764 cubic meters—even by Lingao engineering standards, the workload wasn't huge.

"With this reservoir, large-scale purification camps and agriculture on Lantau will be no problem—farming might not work, but vegetables and animal husbandry are doable."

"The figure of thirty thousand is actually conservative," Hong Shuiyin said. "The Planning Academy calculated based on modern per capita water usage of 80 liters. People in this time-space don't use that much. Especially since most of our residents here live intensively with centralized cooking. Toilets are flushed with seawater or use septic tanks for fertilizer. Water consumption won't be as high as in the old time-space."

Hong Shuiyin had "water" in his name but knew nothing about water affairs; this data was cram-learned before departure. He held great enthusiasm for Hong Kong's commercial development and felt significant dissatisfaction with the Executive Committee's preference for Guangzhou over Hong Kong—as the Hong Kong Commercial Representative, the importance of Hong Kong was closely tied to his own.

"You want to protect water and soil, but what about my building materials?" Shi Dafu expressed concern. His biggest difficulty in Hong Kong infrastructure construction was the lack of building materials. Hong Kong produced no limestone, so local cement projects couldn't proceed; lacking coal, he couldn't fire kilns for bricks and tiles. Currently, he relied mainly on quarrying granite from the mountains with explosives. Now hearing about soil conservation, quarrying—a very environmentally destructive activity—would inevitably have to stop.

"Granite quarrying can continue. The survey team will designate parts of the mountains to minimize overall destruction. As for timber and bricks, that's up to Guo Yi—what can't he buy once he's back in Guangzhou?"

"Cement, and coal for boilers."

"Cement continues to ship from Lingao. As for coal, Guangdong can supply it. Chaozhou has a large coal mine—I hear the Guangzhou Station will extend tentacles everywhere to suck the juice out of Guangdong Province this time..." Shi Jiantao said. "Our shipyard must ramp up quickly."

Shi Jiantao was ambitious about the shipyard, planning to mass-produce Lingao versions of "Liberty ships" to completely replace all large Ming coastal and ocean-going vessels. The ultimate fate of these ships was to serve the House of Elders' conquest of Greater East Asia.

"Lingao's Liberty ships will be launched in Hong Kong like dumplings into a pot!" This was the bold claim he made when hosting a banquet for shipyard elders before departure—naturally receiving cold looks from Zhou Ke and others.

Shi Dafu was enthusiastic: "Our people can finally return to Guangzhou? We must go back majestically under naval escort, with the fleet firing a 100-gun salute at White Goose Pool..."

Mei Lin laughed: "Proprietor Guo is so impressive—I'm jealous, envious, and hateful."

"The shipyard is building him a paddle-wheel yacht," Shi Jiantao said, drinking kvass. "Preparing to thoroughly engage in the decadent capitalist lifestyle. Don't know if it'll be finished in time for this return."

The Guangzhou Trading Post would reopen soon. According to the plan: once the Guangzhou Station was restored, most construction materials and living supplies needed for the Hong Kong base could be procured nearby in Guangzhou and shipped over. This not only saved time but also spared the Transmigrator Group's own transport capacity.

In the near future, supplies needed not only by Hong Kong but also by Lingao and other future coastal island bases would be procured by various trading posts, shipped to Hong Kong, and then transshipped centrally. Hong Kong would become the Transmigrator Group's largest logistics center on the South China coast. In the series of plans to be launched by the Australian Song regime—military actions against the Zheng and Liu families, the Taiwan strategy, the mainland coastal strategy, etc.—Hong Kong would also become a major military logistics depot.

The Planning Academy would establish a South China Materials Procurement Center in Hong Kong, relying on the Delong Hong Kong Branch for clearing and payment. Supporting customs, commodity inspection, classification society, and shipping insurance companies would also be gradually established.

The sun hung dazzlingly in the sky—yet the sunlight brought little warmth. In Little Ice Age Macau, wealthy people on the streets even wore fur robes. The poor wore bulky, patch-covered cotton jackets.

Sunlight shone on the clusters of pointed roofs and fish-scale tiles within Macau. Some roof tiles were pink, but most had turned reddish-brown or grey-white after years of wind, rain, and sun baking, glimmering faintly in the light.

Windows were inlaid with dense wooden lattices, some with intricate patterns. Even without curtains, one couldn't see inside from up close. Walls whitewashed with lime had yellowed from rain and reflected a grey-white light; wooden windowsills cracked in the sun, paint peeling. Deep in these cobblestone alleys, one could occasionally smell the mixed stench of urine, feces, and garbage.

In this alley full of exotic flavor, Lin Ming looked with helpless eyes at the spirited Li Yongxun walking ahead, who was looking around with great interest.

This "expedition" had lasted most of the day, and Lin Ming felt incredibly bored: Macau City itself wasn't big, with few sightseeing spots. The Folangji forts and barracks looked orderly and unique but forbade Chinese entry. As for those Folangji residences, though petite and chic, with lazy zither music and women's low singing occasionally drifting from closed windows, sparking imagination—they were private homes after all.

If this were Foshan or even Guangzhou, he could go wherever he pleased by flashing his Embroidered Uniform Guard badge, provided it wasn't the home of a powerful gentry family with official connections. If someone had a nice garden, he only had to send a message, and which host would dare say he wasn't welcome?

Here, however, the Folangji controlled everything. Although there were many Ming people on the streets, they clearly followed exotic social norms. Lin Ming felt very unaccustomed to this—not only because he disliked the Folangji, but because he realized he couldn't tyrannize people here as elsewhere. "Embroidered Uniform Guard" wasn't a terrifying term here. Although the Xiangshan Assistant Magistrate treated him respectfully and specially assigned an interpreter as his guide, he clearly didn't want him causing trouble.

"What is this place?" An impatient Lin Ming asked the interpreter beside him.

"This is the Folangji residential area, Fifth Lane." The interpreter was a moustached Ming merchant who specialized in selling fruits and vegetables to the Portuguese in Macau. Frequent travel between Xiangshan and Macau made him familiar to both public and private parties. He also spoke passable Portuguese. The Xiangshan Assistant Magistrate took him along for every negotiation.

"What a boring place; doors and windows are closed everywhere!"

"These are mostly the back doors of Folangji merchant residences," the interpreter said.

Lin Ming was about to scold the interpreter for bringing them here, but remembering his precious sister-in-law had requested to enter, he swallowed his words.

"Master, don't be impatient," the interpreter knew his thoughts and said carefully, "At the end of this lane is the pier, where you can see the Folangji great clip-board ships (galleons). There are plenty of barbarian sailors too—occasionally you can even see barbarian women!"

"Really? I've long wanted to see the great clip-board ships. They say the hulls are several stories high, and the masts are scary tall." The fleet-footed youth ahead turned back. "How much farther?"

"Not far, not far. Just out of this lane," the interpreter said. He knew the youth ahead was actually a young woman: the overly delicate face, high-pitched voice, slender frame, and swaying hips when walking made her true gender obvious. However, he had no desire to know what Embroidered Uniform Guard people were doing in Macau.

Just then, she stumbled and fell, twisting her ankle on the cobblestones and shoes. She cried out and sat down on the stone pavement. Lin Ming immediately ran to her.

"How is it? Did the fall hurt?" He bent over her, frowning with concern. Li Yongxun grabbed one ankle and gave a pained cry.

"Seems like a sprain." She couldn't help groaning.

Lin Ming looked around; all wooden doors here were locked, with protective iron bars outside. Not a pedestrian in the alley.

"This lowly one will go call a sedan chair," the interpreter was very sensible, adding, "I suggest Master takes your sister to the Huang house first. Once settled, call a doctor immediately."

The residence arranged for him in Macau by the Xiangshan Assistant Magistrate was in the home of a major merchant named Huang Shunlong—this Proprietor Huang was a very amiable and extremely wealthy man, with a luxuriously built mansion. Lin Ming knew from colleagues: Huang Shunlong was a "fence" who colluded with various heroes of the sea, not only buying stolen goods but also selling contraband to pirate chiefs. A man with connections to heaven.
