# Chapter 853 - Land Acquisition

Zhang Yikun said: "New Guangzhou and such are still far off. I think the first step should be setting up a Guangzhou Industrial Park. The location should be relatively far from the city. The first phase would naturally be building materials factories—to supply the Grand World and the Zizi brand enterprises first. Later we can add some light industrial enterprises. I recall the Light Industry Department has also mentioned wanting to make full use of Guangdong's abundant agricultural products. Wouldn't food processing plants and textile mills be very suitable projects?"

In the near term, these enterprises would provide products for the Grand World and wholesale operations. In the long term, the industrialized production of these factories would deal a devastating blow to Guangdong's handicraft industries. This devastating productive capacity would ultimately have an enormous impact on Guangdong's entire economy and society, eventually promoting the collapse of traditional society.

Hong Shuiyin said: "As for the location, I suggest we still choose somewhere not too far from the Grand World. That way, in case of armed conflict, they can support and coordinate with each other. And it definitely needs to be built along the Pearl River, with a water transport dock, to facilitate the shipping of raw materials and finished goods."

From a planning perspective, the construction site should be downstream and downwind of the Grand World, to prevent smoke and wastewater from affecting it. The two should be 3 to 4 kilometers apart, connected by a good road. In the long term, a small railway could be built to link them.

Then everyone discussed specific details regarding water supply and drainage, lighting and cooling, and other matters, forming an overall plan.

"Let's get this organized and send someone back to Lingao for approval right away?" Zhang Yikun said excitedly.

"Send it to Guo Yi first," Mei Lin reminded him. "He is the head of the Guangzhou Station after all."

"Oh, oh, right. I almost forgot." Zhang Yikun shook his head. "That would be going over his head. I've been self-employed too long and not used to thinking about these things."

The plan quickly received Guo Yi's approval, then the approval of the Planning Commission. Zhang Yikun personally made the trip back to Lingao to "shepherd" the proposal—technically, he only needed to hand the plan to the couriers who regularly traveled between Lingao and Guangzhou. But at Guo Yi's suggestion, he went back himself.

The Guangzhou Grand World was an unplanned project. Although it had received approval from the Elder Council and the Executive Committee, in Guo Yi's experience, if the person in charge didn't personally follow up, such projects would be intentionally or unintentionally delayed during implementation—production departments had extremely tight schedules, and every demanding unit was watching closely. For the Guangzhou Grand World to break ground soon, Zhang Yikun would have to personally "work the ministries."

Thanks to Zhang Yikun's efforts, the project finally received approval item by item. Wu De agreed with his suggestion to first establish several factories to complete the groundwork—from his perspective, this would reduce pressure on Lingao's existing material supplies. Additionally, it meant the entire Grand World construction would be delayed.

From the factories' land acquisition and groundbreaking to formal production, it would take at least half a year to establish stable production capacity. Only then could the Guangzhou Grand World formally enter its construction phase. The material demand pressure it would create would thus be delayed until the second half of 1631.

The overall plan was: beginning in March, land acquisition and infrastructure preparation—leveling, water, electricity, and road access. Besides the core Lingao Construction Engineering Team, all construction workers would be locally recruited laborers. After the project concluded, these people could become factory workers on the spot. The machinery and equipment needed by the enterprises would be produced off-plan as arranged by the Planning Commission. The first batch of building materials would be procured locally in Guangdong, with special materials shipped from Lingao, coordinated and allocated by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission would also convene a coordination meeting to transfer technical staff from the brick works, timber processing plant, and woodworks factory to Guangzhou for equipment installation and technical guidance. Some native workers would also be transferred to serve as the backbone labor force for the new enterprises.

Cheng Dong also allocated the funding and foreign exchange quota for the Grand World project. Of course, this allocation was far from sufficient—it could only be considered seed funding.

The Guangzhou Grand World project was reported to Li Fengjie through Li Xijue's channels. Li Xijue recounted Guo Yi's plan in full. When Li Fengjie received this news, he was reading a book. Hearing the report, he remained silent, his eyebrows not even twitching. Li Xijue knew these senior officials all cultivated "depth of composure" and had mastered the art of controlling their expressions. So he simply stood respectfully, saying nothing.

After turning three or four pages, the Governor finally spoke:

"What do you make of this matter?"

"It would certainly be best not to permit them..." Although Li Xijue had been forced by Guo Yi to accept this project at their meeting, he felt this issue required clarity. He had a vague sense that behind this Grand World project lay an extremely deep plot by the Australians—probably not as simple as just building another big establishment like "Ziming Tower." Most likely they wanted to build an Australian concession outside Guangzhou. He hurriedly added:

"This is a case of 'borrowing land to dry waterlogged goods'—we have a precedent to warn us, please consider this, Master."

Li Fengjie stroked his beard in silence. Li Xijue knew what he was thinking. Guangdong officialdom, from top to bottom, had been cowed by the transmigrators. Last year, the transmigrators raided the Guangzhou area, occupied Humen, bombarded Guangzhou, threw the surrounding counties into chaos, killed many gentry, and plundered vast amounts of property. This matter had already attracted the court's attention. Fortunately, heaven was high and the emperor far away; His Majesty was occupied day and night with the roving bandits and the Eastern Tartars and couldn't spare attention for affairs here. Even He Rubin's disaster in Qiongzhou still had no official court ruling. According to letters from Li Fengjie's secretaries, fellow examination candidates, and friends in the capital, there was a good chance the matter would simply be glossed over—the government forces had lost troops and officers, sustaining "army losses," but they had not actually "lost territory." In the court's eyes, this was still better than the provinces plagued by roving bandits. However, responsibility would eventually be assigned: General He would likely become a "washed-up officer."

With the mess in Qiongzhou as a precedent, the attacks around Guangzhou had been described as "sea bandits using their victory to raid." After all, this kind of thing had happened before—once, a few hundred Japanese pirates had rampaged through Southern Zhili, fighting all the way to the walls of Nanjing. The court hadn't considered the sky falling then either.

Li Fengjie wasn't concerned about He Rubin's future. What concerned him most was how to maintain stability in Guangdong, especially around Guangzhou. Last time, conclusion had only been reached through secret "territorial concessions and reparations." If this time he offended the transmigrators over this matter, who knew what new tricks they might pull. He would have no way to answer to the court.

But these were words he would never say to Li Xijue. After a long while, he finally put on an air of indifference:

"Why bring such a trivial matter to me? Let them go see Prefect Yu."

Prefect Yu was Yu Baocun, the Prefect of Guangzhou. Li Fengjie had made up his mind: whether land acquisition or building some sort of "World," it was all a local Guangzhou matter—it should be Yu Baocun's responsibility.

Thus the matter landed on Yu Baocun's desk. Li Xijue naturally couldn't escape either. He had to meet face-to-face with Prefect Yu to convey instructions, while also doing his best to correctly interpret the leader's intentions: obviously, His Excellency the Governor had no intention of opposing the transmigrators on this matter.

"The land parcels are right here and here." Lü Yizhong, who had been ordered to discuss the details with Yu Baocun, showed complete indifference to the Prefect's surprise. He produced the map he had brought along: a simplified map of Guangzhou and its suburbs that specifically annotated all terrain features and settlements outside the city walls.

Yu Baocun had already received word from Li Fengjie. He silently cursed the Governor for passing another hot potato to him, but this was indeed his responsibility, and he had no reason to refuse—besides, he still needed to count on Governor Li not to slip any poison pills his way regarding the Commissioner's "departure." For this matter, he had already gifted the Governor's favorite concubine quite a few valuable Australian goods.

He observed where Lü Yizhong was pointing. Both parcels were outside the Great East Gate, right along the river. Yu Baocun had never seen a modern map, but he had at least seen geographic charts. He studied it; the two parcels the Australians wanted were across the river from each other, several *li* apart.

Yu Baocun was an official with local government experience. Although he couldn't read the scale, based on the surrounding terrain he could roughly estimate the area of land the Australians wanted—roughly a thousand *mu* altogether. Most of it was official land, which wouldn't be too troublesome to handle. Yu Baocun finally breathed a sigh of relief.

"Master Guo's meaning is: he is willing to pay for all these parcels. He simply asks the Prefect to help facilitate matters," said Lü Yizhong.

"Of course, of course." Yu Baocun nodded repeatedly, privately cursing Lü Yizhong as utterly shameless for immediately defecting to the transmigrators. But this man had been untouchable before, and was even more untouchable now. He could only smile and agree to everything.

Several people gathered to discuss how to make this matter both legitimate and satisfactory. The Australians' land purchase couldn't be made public—there had to be an official pretext. After consideration, Yu Baocun suggested using the name of establishing a commercial port. The reasoning would be: Guangdong had recently suffered military disaster, natural disasters had been frequent in recent years, and the common people were displaced; the court was also constantly raising large armies, straining finances. Now the only option was to open up new revenue sources, collect more commercial taxes to serve the court. Therefore, they had decided to designate a commercial port along the Pearl River and invite merchants to build there and conduct trade.

This reasoning was righteous and reasonable, and easy to implement. Yu Baocun ordered the county magistrates and secretaries of Panyu and Nanhai to be summoned for joint consultation. After conferring, they decided to allocate as much official land for sale as possible, to avoid disputes during land acquisition that might cause problems—everyone knew this land was actually being bought by the Australians, so caution was best.

With local officials' full support, the land acquisition proceeded smoothly. Guo Yi understood well that in the Ming Dynasty, even if you had foreign guns and cannons, without proper lubrication, affairs would progress slowly. After all, he couldn't just drag people out and shoot them. Thus, through Lü Yizhong, he hinted to the major local officials that the Guangzhou Grand World project would be open for public share offerings. If they were interested, they could enjoy the privilege of purchasing "subscription certificates" in advance.
