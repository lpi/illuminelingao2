# Chapter 1146 - The Situation in Fujian

"Sit." Ming Qiu pointed to a chair opposite him.

"Yes, thank you, Commissar." Xu Ke sat down straight.

"Need some water?" Ming Qiu pushed a cold water bottle over—the office wasn't air-conditioned, but an electric fan was whirring away.

"No thanks, I'm not thirsty."

"How is the intelligence work going?" Ming Qiu asked pleasantly.

"Very chaotic. Too much information, hard to verify..." Xu Ke reported honestly. "But there's no major sign of Zheng Zhilong mobilizing troops."

"It's about the recent situation in Fujian..." Ming Qiu paused. "You know, the General Staff is very concerned about Zheng Zhilong's movements. They suspect he might take advantage of our current main force being tied up in Operation Engine to make a move."

"According to our intelligence, Zheng Zhilong is currently busy consolidating his power in Fujian. He's suppressing pirates who haven't submitted to him and expanding his trade network. He doesn't seem to have the intention or capacity to provoke us right now."

"That's good. But we can't let our guard down. The Dutch have been very active recently too." Ming Qiu stood up and walked to the large map on the wall. "Huygens' visit, Li Siya's activities... these are all signals. We must be prepared for worst-case scenarios."

Ming Qiu pointed to the Taiwan Strait on the map. "If a conflict breaks out, our First Fleet will bear the brunt. We need precise intelligence on enemy ship numbers, cannon configurations, and base defenses. Can you guarantee this?"

"We are doing our best to collect it. But penetrating their core circle is difficult," Xu Ke admitted. "Zheng Zhilong is very suspicious of outsiders."

"I understand. But you have to find a way." Ming Qiu turned back, his gaze sharp. "This is war, Lieutenant. Information asymmetry can be fatal."

"Yes, Commissar!"

"Also, regarding Li Siya..." Ming Qiu lowered his voice. "We have reason to believe she is planning something. Keep a close eye on her movements. If necessary..." He made a cutting gesture.

Xu Ke's heart skipped a beat. "Understood."

"Go back and write a detailed analysis report focusing on the potential threat of a Zheng-Dutch alliance. I need it tomorrow morning."

"Yes!" Xu Ke stood up and saluted, then turned to leave.

Walking out of the headquarters, Xu Ke felt a heavy weight on his shoulders. The tropical sun was scorching, but he felt a chill. The shadow of war was looming, and he was the scout standing at the forefront.

Returning to the office, Xu Ke immediately convened a meeting of key intelligence personnel to re-analyze recent intelligence reports, looking for any overlooked clues.

"Chief, look at this..." An analyst handed over a report. "Recently, raw silk shipments from Zhangzhou to Tayouan have suddenly increased."

"Raw silk?" Xu Ke frowned. "The Dutch trade with Japan requires large amounts of raw silk. But why the sudden increase?"

"Could they be stockpiling goods in preparation for war?"

"Possible. Or maybe..." Xu Ke's eyes lit up. "They are preparing a heavy gift for the Shogunate to facilitate the negotiations mentioned by Wei Bachi!"

"If negotiations succeed, the Dutch will be free to deal with us."

"Exactly." Xu Ke nodded. "This is a critical piece of intelligence. We must verify the final destination of this batch of raw silk."

Meanwhile, in Anping, Li Siya was meeting with Zheng Zhifeng.

"The Dutch are willing to talk?" Zheng Zhifeng asked, playing with a jade thumb ring.

"Yes. But they want to see our sincerity first," Li Siya said. "They want us to help them restrain the Australian expansion in Taiwan."

"Restrain? How?"

"They hope we can use our influence among Fujian immigrants to create some trouble for the Australians. Strikes, riots, rumors... anything to slow down their construction."

Zheng Zhifeng sneered. "The Redhairs are good at calculating. Wanting us to be the bird shot by the gun?"

"But this is also in our interest, isn't it?" Li Siya persuaded. "Australian expansion is too fast. If they gain a firm foothold in Taiwan, your brother's dominance at sea will be threatened."

Zheng Zhifeng went silent. He knew Li Siya was right. The Australian "giant ships and cannons" had left a deep impression on them.

"I will report this to my brother," Zheng Zhifeng finally said. "But don't expect too much. Brother is currently focusing on officialdom; he doesn't want to provoke the Australians easily."

"I understand. But please remind Lord Zheng that the Australians won't be content with just Taiwan. Their goal is the entire East Asian sea."

Leaving the Zheng residence, Li Siya let out a long breath. She knew convincing Zheng Zhilong wouldn't be easy. This pirate-turned-official was now more concerned with preserving his wealth and position. But she had other cards to play.

Back in Kaohsiung, construction continued in full swing. The arrival of the Dutch guests didn't slow down the pace; instead, it seemed to show off Australian efficiency, accelerating progress.

Westerly and Cleadia worked happily at the clock tower every day. They had completely integrated into this strange collective. Westerly even learned to use simple Chinese to ask specifically for tools: "Hammer," "Saw," "File"...

Zhong Lishi liked this eager-to-learn boy very much. He sometimes even personally explained mechanical principles to him. Although language barriers existed, the language of science was universal. Through drawings and gestures, they communicated surprisingly smoothly.

"Dr. Zhong, your design is truly genius!" Westerly exclaimed while pointing at the escapement mechanism drawing.

"This is the crystallization of predecessors' wisdom," Zhong Lishi said modestly—though "predecessors" referred to scientists hundreds of years later.

Huygens was also frequenting Dr. Zhong. They discussed everything from astronomy to geography, from mathematics to philosophy. Huygens was deeply shocked by Dr. Zhong's erudition. He realized these Australians possessed knowledge far surpassing contemporary Europe.

"If possible, I really wish to invite you to lecture in Europe," Huygens said sincerely.

"Perhaps there will be a chance in the future," Dr. Zhong smiled. "But for now, we have more important work to do."

Indeed, a huge storm was brewing—both metaphorically and literally.
