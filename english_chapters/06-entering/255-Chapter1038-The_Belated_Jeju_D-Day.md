# Chapter 1038: The Belated Jeju D-Day

"If we transport refugees at this speed, it won't be many days before we have a biohazard crisis here." Lu Wenyuan stood on the farm's watchtower, looking worriedly at the refugee camp spread all over the hillside below.

The transport fleet had come twice, taking away a total of four thousand people, but the population flooding into the refugee camp only increased. especially after Kong Youde's troops reached the gates of Dengzhou City, the people near Dengzhou fled in all directions to avoid the clamor of soldiers, and many hid on Qimu Island.

Lu Wenyuan could no longer grasp the precise number of refugees down to single digits at this moment—people came in almost every hour. Plus the daily death toll, he could only estimate the approximate number in the refugee camp through the nightly distribution figures of refugee rations: the total number had exceeded 4,800.

Qimu Island was a small island. Although food was not a problem and accommodation could be barely managed, the consumption of drinking water could not keep up. Just supplying 1.5 liters of basic drinking water to each refugee daily meant consumption of over ten thousand liters. The water sources on the island simply couldn't supply that much water—it all relied on the rainwater stored in the cisterns Lu Wenyuan had dug in the previous stage.

At this rate, even if the population remained below six thousand daily, the island's reserve water sources would be exhausted in less than half a month. If there was no heavy snow to replenish surface water, water-fetching teams would have to be sent over ten *li* away to fetch water.

What was more deadly was excrement. Although the food supply level was very low and there were biogas digesters to process it, the daily amount of excrement was considerable. Lu Wenyuan had been forced to stop the use of several public toilets.

"You mismatched bunch of miserly Planning Commission bastards..." He gritted his teeth and said: if not for the Planning Commission's insistence back then, he would have built the sewage culverts of the toilets directly into the sea long ago, discharging everything into the ocean, which would be convenient and clean; why would he need to consider these problems now?

He didn't know when the next shift of ships would arrive—the fleet had to unload, evaluate the gains and losses in transport, and revise the transport plan. This was originally in the plan, only no one expected the speed of gathering refugees to be so fast. He was currently in a state of "cargo backlog."

From the watchtower, the lights on the pier and scattered mast lights could be seen. Besides a few fishing boats he collected himself, a special service squadron from Kaohsiung had been sent to protect the sea surface around the island. The cannons on these four special service boats were covered with canvas and fishing nets, and the flags were hidden.

However, the cold wind that grew colder day by day and the occasional snowflakes reminded him that severe winter was approaching.

The water pools on the island and surface runoff outside the island had already started to freeze. Under the blowing of the biting northwest wind, the sea surface would soon freeze too—Lu Wenyuan had confirmed this from the mouths of local fishermen.

Once Longkou Bay froze, the special service boats would have to withdraw from here. However, there were nearly 1000 Army soldiers equipped with cannons and typewriters (machine guns) on the island now, so even if Kong Youde attacked with his whole army, it wouldn't be a problem. The only thing worrying him was the impact on ships docking after the ice freeze.

Coming down from the watchtower and returning to the warm conference room with a fire burning, Special Commissioner Xie Yao, sent by the Ministry of Health to preside over the health and epidemic prevention work of the Qimu Island refugee camp, was waiting for him.

Xie Yao was a semi-old man in his fifties. Originally a scholar without a degree and a bankrupt small landlord, he knew a bit of medicine. He received training in modern Chinese and Western medicine in the Ministry of Health's training class. Being from Shaanxi, he was considered "freeze-resistant" and was sent to Shandong to preside over refugee health work. Under him were dozens of medics dispatched from Lingao.

He wore a semi-old uniform commonly worn by naturalized citizens, sitting by the stove warming himself. Seeing Lu Wenyuan come in, he tried to stand up.

Lu Wenyuan waved his hand impatiently: "Don't get up, just tell me. What's the situation today?"

"Disinfectant has been sprayed in all barracks; the killing rate of fleas and bedbugs is ninety percent." Xie Yao spoke slowly. "As of 17:00 this afternoon, thirty-one people have died, and the bodies have been transported out. There are one hundred and nine new patients. Adding those not yet recovered and deducting those recovered and died, the current number of patients is three hundred and seventy-five..."

Lu Wenyuan smiled bitterly: "Doctor Xie, how do you think the situation will be tomorrow?"

"The weather gets colder day by day; I'm afraid the women, children, and elderly can hardly withstand it. a small cold or chill turns into pneumonia instantly. There isn't enough medicine—if only we could give them more bedding and cotton clothes," Xie Yao said. If not for the Chiefs' secret "sulfa tablets" and some other "Australian medicines," relying only on decocted herbal soup, more people would have died.

It was precisely out of curiosity for "Australian medicine" that Xie Yao signed up for the Ministry of Health's training class at his advanced age.

"However, cold weather also has advantages. With so many people crowded on a small island, if it weren't freezing cold, I'm afraid there would have been an epidemic long ago."

There was a huge gap in winter clothing and bedding prepared for the refugees—it was indeed difficult for the Senate to prepare winter clothes for over a hundred thousand people. Therefore, the Forward Command's idea was to let the refugees build fires and roast slowly: compared to cotton, the supply of fuel was easier.

"Fix up the houses for the refugees more, and build more *huodilong* (underfloor heating). At least two flues for every barrack," Lu Wenyuan instructed.

After seeing off Xie Yao, Lu Wenyuan paced back and forth in the conference room a few times and ordered the orderly to finding Wang Ruixiang to discuss: Chen Sigen had gone out with the Special Reconnaissance Detachment; he had to continue monitoring the combat operations of Kong Youde and the government army. Ever since Kong Youde's trajectory changed, Chen Sigen became very uneasy about the historical process and monitored both sides increasingly closely. The Special Reconnaissance Detachment, reconnaissance cavalry, and plainclothes spies monitored the government soldiers and Kong Youde's unit almost 24 hours a day. For this kind of mission, Chen Sigen would serve for days once he went out.

On the big map behind him, the latest status of all parties was densely marked with small colored flags. Since Kong Youde reached the gates of Dengzhou City on November 22, there had been small-scale armed conflicts between the two sides, but the combat situation was not intense. Overall, it was still in a temporary stalemate.

Of course, this stalemate would soon be broken. To execute the Senate's resolve: that is, to let Kong Youde disrupt Shandong and capture a large amount of supplies, while ensuring Sun Yuanhua could "preside over the pacification," both the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and Lu Wenyuan were conducting active strategic activities. Messengers and intelligence agents traveling to Dengzhou, Laizhou, and various places in Shandong flowed endlessly.

Although Lu Wenyuan did not go to Sun Yuanhua personally, he wrote several letters to Sun Yuanhua as a fellow believer, making several speculations about Kong Youde's movements and giving subtle reminders about the issue of the original Dongjiang old units in Dengzhou. In particular, he pointed out that Kong Youde's mutiny this time was "ignited from accumulated firewood, not extinguishable by a ladle of water"—the Dongjiang old units in Dengzhou were all unreliable.

Lu Wenyuan didn't expect Sun Yuanhua to follow his advice completely; he just wanted to leave an impression first to prepare for approaching and manipulating Sun Yuanhua in the next step.

At this critical juncture, Lu Wenyuan didn't want any epidemic or such things to break out in his base camp. Moreover, too many people gathering was also too conspicuous.

Wang Ruixiang was formulating "grand plans" in his bedroom, precisely speaking, a plan for going to Liaodong—as a major advocate of the Liaodong plan, he had always attempted to establish relations with the Manchus, so he was very keen on Operation Generator. Once a foothold was established on the Shandong Peninsula and a base established on Jeju Island, the maritime communication line with the Manchus would be established.

In Wang Ruixiang's view: although the Manchus were barbaric and backward, they had plenty of resources. The industrial-agricultural scissors gap could be used greatly to shear their wool. If that really didn't work, rescuing more captured Han population to Lingao to enrich the labor force would also be good.

Hearing Lu Wenyuan's worry, he grinned: "Fuck, what's there to worry about? Shouldn't we be going to Jeju Island?"

From Qimu Island to Jeju was only one-third the distance from Qimu Island to Kaohsiung. No large ships were needed; ordinary vessels could transport too. Ships could make a round trip in less than four or five days, much faster than transporting directly to Kaohsiung.

"But so far, the Jeju Island landing operation hasn't started yet." Lu Wenyuan frowned. By right, the Jeju Island landing should have started a month ago.

Now the time had reached the end of 1631, yet there was still no telegraph signal from the direction of Jeju Island. Where on earth did the Second Fleet go?

"This is indeed a bit strange!" Wang Ruixiang scratched his head. "I think we have to send a telegram to ask!"

While the radio waves of the telegram joint-signed by Wang Ruixiang and Lu Wenyuan cut through the sky, the Second Fleet, having set sail from Kaohsiung, had already arrived in the waters of Jeju Island.

The Second Fleet launched the landing operation nearly a month later than expected. The consequences of the Navy's rapid expansion began to reveal themselves one by one at this time. The Second Fleet's flagship *Zhenyang* suffered a major steam engine failure halfway from Hong Kong to Kaohsiung; one boiler failed, forcing a return to Hong Kong for repairs. After other ships arrived in Kaohsiung and began comprehensive inspection and troubleshooting, *Nongchao* and *Daishuang* were found to have problems of varying degrees: mainly in the power system: boilers, steam engines, crankshafts... individual ships also had leakage problems. The only one in normal condition was the *Fubo*.

After some emergency repairs by the repair ship docked in Kaohsiung, the Second Fleet finally barely completed the preparation work. They launched the strategy against Jeju Island just before New Year's Day of 1632.

The four warships *Zhenyang*, *Nongchao*, *Daishuang*, and *Fubo* sailed through the waves in a wheel formation on the sea surface. They all hoisted sails, sailing at a speed of 6 knots per hour, with faint black smoke rising from their chimneys—the boilers were not using full power—to look after the H800s and special service boats in the formation. They followed closely behind with full sails.

This was almost the entire combat fleet and two-thirds of the transport ships of the Second Fleet. The ships were fully loaded with soldiers, supplies, and construction materials.

The sun rose slowly, shining on the deck. In the distance, a verdant large island had emerged on the sea surface—it was Jeju Island.
