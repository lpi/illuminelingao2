# Chapter 1098 - Court Struggle

The various rooms in the inner study courtyard had different access permissions, so the further inside one went, the fewer people were around Leng Ningyun. When he stepped into the inner study's warm pavilion, only Wu Kaidi remained by his side.

The table was already laid out with *Dichao* transcripts and various documents organized and translated by the advisors: there were dedicated people to collect and organize these every day. Currently, due to the busy work regarding Sun Yuanhua, the intelligence gathering in this area was becoming increasingly intense.

Wu Kaidi was an indispensable assistant to Leng Ningyun and often had to handle some relatively sensitive matters for him, so some simple intelligence gathering work was reassigned to local servants.

In the winter, a large number of refugees from North Zhili, Shandong, Henan, and other places poured into the capital. These refugees slept on the streets, barely surviving on the porridge provided by the Shuntian Prefecture, and many froze or starved to death daily. Leng Ningyun took in dozens of orphans from among them. After screening, he kept seven or eight clever and reliable ones specifically responsible for running errands daily to buy *Dichao* and inquire about news in teahouses. The other children he deemed "unsuitable" were transferred back to Lingao.

These children could all recognize a few characters more or less. They would go out early in the morning with a few biscuits and return around three in the afternoon. Upon returning, they would tell what they saw and heard to the advisors, who would then compile it into drafts. Every week, the Beijing Intelligence Station would send a "Beijing Weekly News Summary" to Lingao via Qipwei Escort Agency. After this intelligence arrived in Lingao, besides being used by the Intelligence Analysis Division, it was also important reference material for the Historical Data Group of the Great Library.

Leng Ningyun changed his clothes with the help of his life secretary and took a few sips of tea. He browsed through today's compilation of materials. He was naturally most concerned with materials regarding the situation in Dengzhou.

Judging from the materials in the *Dichao*, the dispute between "pacification" and "suppression" had gradually begun to fade, and both the court and the public began to lean towards suppression. This was not only due to the running around and appealing of Shandong officials but more because the attitudes of the original pro-pacification faction: Xiong Mingyu, Xu Guangqi, and Zhou Yanru, had shifted.

Clearly, Sun Yuanhua's letters had reached the capital, so these pro-pacification faction members began to change direction. However, in order not to make the shift too fast and abrupt, these former pro-pacification faction members proposed "slow suppression." Sun Yuanhua's memorial had also arrived in the capital a few days ago. Leng Ningyun had already seen the full text. Apart from his escape experience and current military and administrative handling, Leng Ningyun noticed that he earnestly critiqued his previous pacification policy and proposed "mainly suppression, supplemented by pacification." This coordinated perfectly with the current attitude shift of Zhou Yanru, Xiong Mingyu, and others—obviously, both sides had fully communicated in private.

This caused the originally fierce dispute over suppression versus pacification in the court to calm down. The parties only argued over "urgent suppression" or "slow suppression," and the focus of contradiction in the court returned to the issue of dealing with Sun Yuanhua and his group.

Yu Dacheng had completely fallen from power. His downfall was not only due to his ineffective handling of the Dengzhou rebellion but also due to some old problems from the past: particularly his inaction in suppressing the White Lotus Society uprising, blindly advocating pacification, sending requests to the court to grant official titles to the uprising leaders, and there were even rumors that he had become sworn brothers with their leaders. So it was not surprising that he was collapsed by concentrated fire this time.

Because Sun Yuanhua had the protection of Zhou Yanru and others, plus he escaped in time, he did not suffer the attacks accusing him of "defecting" as in the old spacetime. However, the court's public opinion was still very unfavorable to him.

Leng Ningyun had attended lectures when studying at the "Farm" and knew that the people attacking Sun Yuanhua actually had ulterior motives. Rather than pursuing Sun Yuanhua's responsibility, it was better to say they were using this opportunity to attack Zhou Yanru.

Whenever a major event occurred, various factions in the court would use it to attack dissidents and purge political opponents, launching major inquisitions to exclude and strike at political rivals. After the Yuan Chonghuan case, the former members of the Eunuch Faction, who had been suppressed after the Donglin Party took charge, used this event to sentence Grand Secretary Qian Longxi, one of the main generals of the Donglin Party, to death. Although his life was eventually spared through the strenuous rescue efforts of Donglin members like Wen Zhenmeng and Huang Daozhou, he was still exiled to Dinghai Guard until the fall of the Great Ming, and was only pardoned by the Southern Ming regime.

Although Zhou Yanru was not a member of the Eunuch Faction, he also used this event to operate privately, driving away Senior Grand Secretary Cheng Jiming and becoming the Senior Grand Secretary himself.

The major event of the Dengzhou Rebellion naturally became a great opportunity for various political forces in the court to seize the chance to stir up trouble. Striking Sun Yuanhua was striking Zhou Yanru.

Zhou Yanru had many enemies, but the biggest one was Wen Tiren, who was also a Grand Secretary. Although Wen Tiren was introduced into the Grand Secretariat by Zhou Yanru aid, after driving away the Senior Grand Secretary, the two went from conspiring together to jostling against each other.

Starting from the spring of the fourth year of Chongzhen, Zhou Yanru and Wen Tiren began to fight both openly and secretly. Under Wen Tiren's instigation and incitement, speech officials constantly submitted memorials to impeach him. After Zhou Yanru held great power, he acted unscrupulously. Even his domestic slave became a Regional Commander. There were many in the court and public who were dissatisfied with him. By November of this year, the impeachment of Zhou Yanru had reached a climax. Attacking Sun Yuanhua, the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou whom he had promoted, was also an important means to strike at Zhou Yanru.

The Dengzhou Mutiny provided enough ammunition for the anti-Zhou faction, so the attacks against Sun Yuanhua became increasingly fierce. Looking at the content of the impeachments, they ranged from wasting military pay to corruption, to smuggling Liaodong goods, and so on. There was a trend to brand Sun Yuanhua as a "sinner against the state."

This matter, rather than saying it was protecting Sun Yuanhua, was better described as protecting Zhou Yanru. Leng Ningyun thought, Sun Yuanhua was actually not the key; the key was Zhou Yanru.

From the perspective of the Senate itself, it didn't matter whether Zhou Yanru or Wen Tiren was in power. But for him, executing the mission on the front line, to keep Sun's position, he had to start from the political struggle between Zhou and Wen.

The History Research Group of the Great Library had also made similar speculations. Although Leng Ningyun didn't know what the External Intelligence Bureau planned to do next, judging from various signs, the External Intelligence Bureau had obviously already started to work.

The biggest indication was that starting from the middle of the fourth year of Chongzhen, a large number of placards exposing Wen Tiren and his associate Xue Guoguan appeared. Although the text, largely accusing them of being "remnants of the Eunuch Faction," seemed to be the work of the Donglin Party, Leng Ningyun knew very well that these placards were nine out of ten the handiwork of the "Truth Office."

Ruining Wen Tiren's reputation on a large scale—of course, his reputation wasn't good to begin with—was undoubtedly to manufacture enough ammunition for the Donglin Party. The Donglin Party would not let go of this opportunity to deal with Wen Tiren.

Here, it involved operations within the larger picture. Leng Ningyun thought, would direct assassination of Wen Tiren be a simpler choice? With the current operational capabilities of the External Intelligence Bureau and the Special Reconnaissance Team, removing Wen Tiren without a trace was no longer a difficult task—it was just a question of whether doing so was necessary. This all needed to be weighed.

"Forget it, let Jiang Shan, Li Yan, and the others wrack their brains over this." Leng Ningyun decided not to think about it anymore. He would follow the instructions of the External Intelligence Bureau and first do a good job of winning over the major eunuchs—a few words from a eunuch at a critical moment could outweigh long-winded arguments from outside ministers. As for the deeper political struggle work, let others do it.

Leng Ningyun's report was transmitted via radio to the Lingao Central Telecommunications Station. The naturalized citizen operator receiving the telegram found it was a coded telegram, and based on the call sign at the beginning, she knew it was a telegram from "Department 13." According to regulations, she immediately registered the telegram number and then filed it into Department 13's confidential folder.

That evening, the messenger on the middle shift collected the folder from the Central Telecommunications Station. The telegram was then handed to the Confidential Section to be decoded. Based on the code in the header, the female confidential clerk knew this was important intelligence sent from an overseas station. The text was put into a locked red folder and immediately delivered to the desk of Li Yan, Chief of the First Division: the Domestic Division or the Great Ming Division.

Li Yan read the report and immediately went to find Jiang Shan. Subsequently, Jiang Shan held a working meeting in the conference room of the External Intelligence Bureau with Li Yan, Wang Ding, and the invited General Researcher of the Great Library Historical Research Room, Yu E'shui, and Director of the Truth Office, Zhang Haogu.

The meeting concluded that Leng Ningyun's analysis was largely accurate. Although the latest "Beijing Weekly News Summary" had not yet arrived, judging from various intelligence obtained previously, to save Sun Yuanhua's political life, it was still necessary to start from the big picture and clear away the anti-Zhou Yanru forces.

Assassinating Wen Tiren had no technical difficulty, but after discussion, everyone believed that assassinating Wen Tiren had little significance. Wen Tiren's death would only result in Zhou Yanru's sole dominance, and the Donglin Party would definitely turn the spearhead of struggle towards Zhou Yanru. Zhou Yanru was not an ally of the Donglin Party either; in the struggle to bring down Qian Longxi and drive away Qian Qianyi back then, Wen Tiren and Zhou Yanru could be said to have conspired together. Donglin might not necessarily refrain from using this opportunity of striking down Sun Yuanhua to drive Zhou Yanru away.

Only by keeping Wen Tiren could the Donglin Party possibly choose to cooperate with Zhou Yanru. Although Zhou Yanru had attacked the Donglin Party, there was still some incense karma connection between him and the Donglin Party. In the metropolitan examination of the fourth year of Chongzhen, it was precisely under Zhou Yanru's secret operation as the chief examiner that a large number of Fushe scholars, including Fushe leader Zhang Pu, passed the examination. It was hard to say whether there was a secret deal between the two.

"Fushe and Donglin are actually one and the same," Yu E'shui said. "Zhang Pu's power actually already seems to be above the old Donglin big shots. When Zhou Yanru disregarded old rules and squeezed out Wen Tiren to become the chief examiner, besides taking care of his good friend's son to become the *Huiyuan*, he also planned to recruit famous scholars as his disciples to expand his power in the court. From this point of view, although Fushe and Zhou Yanru are not people of the same path, there is a foundation for cooperation between the two sides. After all, Zhou Yanru's second reinstatement into the Grand Secretariat later had a great deal to do with the secret operational support of the Fushe. They are not like him and Wen Tiren, who are incompatible like fire and water."
