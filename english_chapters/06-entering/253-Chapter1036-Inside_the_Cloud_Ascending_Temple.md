# Chapter 1036: Inside the Cloud Ascending Temple

Daoist Zhang stood in the "Grand Hall" of the "Cloud Ascending Temple"—calling it a "Grand Hall," it was actually just a three-bay tiled house. However, in this rural area of southern Shandong, it counted as a very neat and regular building—looking down at the sentient beings in the courtyard who were gazing at him piously. A hint of a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

Only the statues of the Three Pure Ones were set up in the Grand Hall. According to the concept of New Daoism, "no idols are set up," but Zhang Yingchen considered that it was inappropriate to be too maverick and shocking at present, attracting the attention of local gentry and officials, so it was better to appear in the traditional image of the Way of the Celestial Masters.

The Cloud Ascending Temple itself was very small, but it had been expanded considerably with the full support of the Zhuang family. Apart from some land "donated" by the Zhuang family, most was bought by Zhang Yingchen himself. Although buying land in a famine year was easy, the Zhuang family also put in a lot of effort during the process—Zhang Yingchen deeply felt that the support of local gentry was too important for operating in the Ming Dynasty.

Because the area was not peaceful, several masters of the Zhuang family suggested to Zhang Yingchen that he should quickly turn the Daoist temple into a "fortified stockade." Natural disasters were frequent in southern Shandong, and refugees and bandits were everywhere. Slightly larger villages and stockades were rushing to build stockade walls and train local militia. The Cloud Ascending Temple, although only four or five *li* away from Dadian Village, was isolated in the wild after all. Originally a broken courtyard no one wanted, it now gathered hundreds of refugee households and became the hall of the New Daoism, making it an attractive target.

Zhang Yingchen felt the masters of the Zhuang family made sense. Anyway, he had plenty of manpower on hand—besides a large number of believers he could use, he had enough grain to recruit many refugees willing to work for food—so he immediately started building earthen ramparts.

Money was not lacking either. Although he declined the Zhuang family's donation and exempted the believers from "incense money," after the South Infinite Sect disintegrated locally, most of its real estate fell into the Daoist's hands, except for some movable property and real estate seized by Ma Weisan. He sold part of the real estate to the Zhuang family, obtaining several hundred taels of silver and several hundred *dan* of grain.

He didn't even have to worry about building materials: in a famine year, there were plenty of abandoned villages. Zhang Yingchen mobilized refugees to dismantle houses and transport bricks, stones, timber, and even adobe bricks back without leaving anything behind. Soon, a wall with a circumference of five hundred meters was built around the Cloud Ascending Temple, and a moat was dug outside the wall. Corner towers were built at the four corners, making it look like an earthen fortress.

To firmly grasp the signboard of "charity," the "Ciji Hall" charity organized by the Zhuang family was also set up in the Daoist temple. This was ensuring a close relationship with the Zhuang family, and also intended to dilute its own color as a secret society.

The Ciji Hall was now located in the left and right wing rooms of the main hall. Zhang Yingchen did not interfere with the organization and personnel of the charity hall at all: after all, the Zhuang family provided the money, grain, and connections; he was only interested in the refugees.

The refugees lived outside the Cloud Ascending Temple but inside the earthen ramparts. According to Zhang Yingchen's blueprints, the Zhuang family built rows of refugee-camp-style longhouses using adobe bricks and rice straw, specifically to shelter refugees. Those responsible for guarding and caring for the refugees were all believers under Zhang Yingchen.

Zhang Yingchen controlled the believers extremely strictly, forbidding them to preach to the refugees. He only propagated to the believers the doctrine that visiting the poor and asking about their suffering was "great merit" and "the immortals of the sea saving people," to avoid arousing suspicion from both the Ming Dynasty and the Senate.

Of course, many of his believers themselves had become refugees, with insufficient food and clothing. Zhang Yingchen also helped them survive the winter by distributing relief rations and bedding through group leaders, but did not shelter them or send them away. He dared not guarantee the reliability of this batch of former Infinite Sect believers yet. If they were transported to Jeju or Taiwan and caused trouble, it would be seriously detrimental to him and his New Daoism.

Zhang Yingchen walked slowly down the steps—the morning consultation was over—he now continued to see patients at the Cloud Ascending Temple for half a day every day. Because the medicine was miraculously effective and he took no money from the poor, his reputation grew even greater. The refugees, believers, and staff gathered in the courtyard made way for him one after another. Zhang Yingchen wore a compassionate smile, nodding or bowing in return from time to time, sometimes stopping to say a few words to people.

When some believers saw him coming, they knelt one after another; some shouted his name wildly, and some rushed forward attempting to touch his clothes. The scene was somewhat chaotic for a time. Zhang Yingchen knew that some believers even tried to bribe the Daoist boys serving him closely, attempting to get some of his face-washing water or old clothes as medicinal primers. He had to severely criticize this practice at the doctrine study meetings of group leaders, denouncing it as "demonic."

Surrounded by Ming Qing and other trusted aides, he finally left the main courtyard and walked towards the rear courtyard: the rear courtyard had three distinct sections, serving as the office of the New Daoism and his residence and office. It was also the nerve center of the Senate in the southern Shandong region.

Daoist Daoquanzi accomplished several things here that he had always wanted to do but hadn't achieved. One of them was finally gathering enough people to open a Daoist student training class. The Daoist, who used to be constantly squeezed out and despised for fighting for a few Daoist student quotas, finally held his head high this time: with sufficient fame and a huge refugee population, he finally selected fifty handsome young men and women as Daoist students according to his own aesthetic taste and selection criteria.

Rows of houses were built along the wall in the rear courtyard: those were the dormitories and classrooms for the Daoist students. It was noon now, and since the canteen hadn't been built yet, the Daoist students were scattered in the courtyard in twos and threes, squatting or standing with bowls to eat.

The food was simple, even harsh: gruel made of relief rations and dried vegetables, but for the Daoist students, it was supreme delicacy, and every one of them slurped it down with relish. Every Daoist student wore a short Daoist robe made of locally purchased homespun cloth by female relatives of believers, many modified from dismantled and washed old clothes—without showing too many Lingao characteristics.

Zhang Yingchen did not approach the Daoist students, fearing to cause a "crowd watching" by them. Recently, he found that the color of "personality cult" around him was getting thicker, about which he felt deeply worried.

For this batch of Daoist students, he used his first batch of disciples like Ming Qing as teachers to first teach them basic reading, writing, and calculation skills, and then teach doctrine—the so-called teaching of doctrine was reciting the pamphlets he compiled personally: *Introduction to the Daoist Canon*, *Questions and Answers on the Daoist Canon*, and *Compilation of Essential Scriptures*. His time was limited, so he adopted a method mainly based on memorization, using one class period every day for explanation and indoctrination. Only the most crucial music course had no one to teach: although Daoquanzi had done much research on Daoist music, unfortunately, he was hopeless at both instruments and singing.

"This batch of fine unpolished jades cannot stay here; the environment is too dangerous. It would be a pity if they were ruined." He watched the Daoist students active in the courtyard for a long time, unaware that he was entranced.

"Daoist Master..." Ming Qing reminded softly.

"Hm?! Oh." Zhang Yingchen came back to his senses, coughed, and continued walking along the paved path towards his residence courtyard.

Several new tiled houses were built in the courtyard, exclusively for the residence and daily life of him and a few trusted disciples. Usually, Zhang Yingchen also compounded medicine here. But as Qiwèi's freight routes gradually became familiar and more patent Chinese medicines were shipped from Hong Kong, the pressure for him to make medicine personally decreased a lot.

He returned to his residence, and Luo Chun served a bowl of clear tea; he drank half a bowl in one breath. The room was tidy and quiet. It looked carefully cleaned at a glance. He felt quite satisfied: having a woman and not having a woman was indeed different.

Luo Saichun—Zhang Yingchen thought her name was too "jianghu" (common/vulgar), so he removed the "Sai" character, and now she was called Luo Chun—stood silently by his side. Since being subdued by his "magical power" at the "Dharma Assembly," Luo Chun had been completely devoted to the Daoist. Zhang Yingchen understood the psychology of such women very well: once the psychological pillar in their hearts was destroyed, their worldview, outlook on life, and moral values would be completely torn down and rebuilt, making it easy to reshape their personality. And he, Zhang Yingchen, had at least read quite a few books on psychology and practice in this regard. After a period of careful training, the results were remarkable. Although Zhang Yingchen was not yet 100% assured of her, he had at least 80% trust.

When things came to a close, he would send her back to Lingao for a round of "purification" plus "re-education," the Daoist pondered; she would be a qualified professional religious person of the New Daoism in the future.

Luo Chun stood beside the "Perfected One" with bated breath, ready to listen to his instructions at any time. Now that she had changed her allegiance, she held added awe, bordering on worship, for this "Perfected One" with boundless magical power. Usually, she only dared to consider herself a servant, serving the "Perfected One's" daily life with care. All to beg the Perfected One to show mercy and perform rituals and chant scriptures for Hu Qi'er, to deliver her soul to the "Immortal Mountains and Divine Realms on the other side of the sea." Although Hu Qi'er had no blood relationship with her, she had no other relatives in the world, and her only disciple was her closest kin.

Zhang Yingchen used both grace and authority on Luo Chun, trying his best to win her over: Luo Chun had served as the Saintess of the Inner Dharma Hall of the South Infinite Sect for a long time and knew the affairs within the sect very well. He wanted to launch larger-scale actions in southern Shandong to seize territory from local sects, and Luo Chun was his guide.

He did not trust Ma Weisan—although Ma Weisan responded to every plea, his attitude of controlling a large amount of sect property while keeping him at arm's length made him very unhappy. When convening meetings of group leaders, Ma Weisan either made excuses not to come or sent a deputy group leader to fill the number, obviously full of wariness towards him.

"Anyway, getting rid of you is as easy as lifting a hand!" Zhang Yingchen thought secretly. He just had to say a word to Xiao Ye, and there wouldn't be a person named Ma Weisan tomorrow night. However, he still couldn't make up his mind: although this high-level figure was very unpopular, most group leaders and deputy group leaders had worked with Ma Weisan for a long time. Rashly killing him might inevitably make them feel like the fox mourning the death of the hare.

"Luo Chun, what do you think of Group Leader Ma?" Zhang Yingchen put down the tea bowl and asked slowly.

"Reporting to the Perfected One: Ma Weisan is not firm in faith, having talent but no virtue."

Although she came from a background of performing street acrobatics, she had mixed in the high levels of the sect for many years after all, so her speech was not vulgar.
