# Chapter 1087 - Bombardment

Next, several soldiers began to load gunpowder—the Dengzhou Army gunners used fixed charge bags for loading, each bag weighing one *jin*. They loaded according to the range needed. Then someone used a ramrod to ram it tight. There was a lot of learning in this: if rammed too tight, the gunpowder would smolder, causing failure to fire, and a loading spade had to be used to loosen it; but when loosening, the gunpowder might suddenly burn rapidly.

These gunners were all trained by Portuguese, so their gestures and actions were very standardized. A soldier filled a wad into the bore, then a large ball wrapped in wooden red cloth was sent into the belly. Subsequently, a bag of twelve small shots was sent in. Then the patrol leader measured with a gun ruler again, adjusting the elevation angle of the cannon according to the range.

This set of methods was high-tech in the late Ming—the Dengzhou Army was trained single-handedly by the Portuguese. Ordinary Ming Army gunners had no idea there were so many essentials to firing a cannon.

Ma Linxi was moving cannonballs. A twelve-pound cannonball was not considered heavy, but for him, a person who had only eaten some swill water and pot scrapings for so many days, it was still too heavy. Just as he was holding his breath to move the cannonball, suddenly someone kicked him hard on the butt. He instantly fell flat on his face, a "dog chewing mud." The cannonball also rolled away too far. A burst of wild laughter immediately rang out around him.

Ma Linxi hurriedly climbed up, not even daring to lift his head, and ran straight for the cannonball. This big cannonball was very precious. According to the gunner master, one cost several *mace* of silver.

With great difficulty, he moved the cannonball back—the rebel gunners did not allow coolies to roll cannonballs on the ground, allegedly for fear of scratching the surface of the cannonball or mixing in mud and sand, which were all taboo things—Ma Linxi's face was covered in cold sweat, panting from weakness.

A small boss monitoring the coolies aside sneered and said lazily: "Eating is fast enough, moving things has no strength, truly waste!" Saying this, he drew out his waist saber with a "swish."

Ma Linxi was so scared that he knelt on the ground begging for mercy repeatedly. several coolies around were also so scared that they knelt down to beg for mercy.

Fortunately, that boss was just scaring the coolies. Seeing them shivering with fright one by one, he laughed loudly a few times. Seeing this, the coolies hurriedly got up one by one and continued to move cannonballs and gunpowder.

Ma Linxi had been doing this job for more than ten days. He used to be a carpenter, moving around the countryside of Huang County with tools on his back to work: repairing farm tools for people, building furniture, and helping out when houses were built. Although he slept in the wind and dew and earned some hard money, at least one person ate full and the whole family was not hungry.

After the rebels came, the whole village was razed to the ground, so Ma Linxi had to "join the gang" with the refugees. Because of this craft, he was allocated to the artillery team—the artillery team always had times when repairs were needed. In the eyes of others, this Ma Linxi already had a huge advantage: First was being able to eat on time. Whether refugees assigned to the infantry units had food to eat depended entirely on luck and fists: rebel soldiers only gave each team of refugees a few baskets of black steamed buns made of unknown things every day, so that every mealtime caused fights, killing a few people.

Although in the artillery team he worked more than an ox and ate less than a dog—the rebel soldiers in the artillery team used them as slaves and livestock, not only whipping and bullying them constantly but also dragging them out to chop off heads with one saber cut if slightly careless. A few days ago, on the way dragging cannons to Huang County, because a cannon got stuck in mud and oxen couldn't exert force, in order to urge the coolies to exert force, the Thousand-man Commander of the artillery team chopped off several people's heads in one breath, scaring Ma Linxi into having nightmares every night.

Ma Linxi had nothing in his brain now. Besides working mechanically according to orders, he tried every way to survive. As long as he could live, he would do whatever he was asked to do.

Seeing that the gun positions were all set up, Ma Linxi and other coolies of the artillery team could catch their breath for a moment. They either lay down or sat, heavy panting filling the air, but no one dared to speak—speaking could also lead to death; this was one of the experiences and lessons they had gained these days.

The Thousand-man Commander of the artillery team had no mood to play with them anymore. He ordered the gunners to pierce the powder bags and heat the slow match and firing probe red, just waiting for the order to fire.

Here on the seaside, the first wave of refugees had barely lined up under the driving of rebel soldiers. Each team of refugees had fifty people, matched with three or four guards. The guards were all bandit soldiers and desperadoes recruited by the rebels locally. Most people had no armor, all holding sabers and shields, guarding behind each team of refugees, specially used for driving and supervising battle.

The guards and leaders of each team constantly cheered up the refugees:

"Break the stockade, the whole army will be rewarded with wine and meat..."

"Kill an enemy soldier, reward one white steamed bun and one tael of silver..."

"Those who dare to retreat, beheaded on the spot!"

Ma Linxi knew that for people charging in the first wave, it would be good if three or four out of a hundred survived—he had seen too much these days. Rebel soldiers just treated commoners' lives as consumables for the defenders' ammunition and arrows, using corpses to fill the trenches.

Fortunately, he had this craft and could save his little life.

While he was letting his imagination run wild, suddenly the sound of a cannon came through the air. Everyone was stunned. Ma Linxi looked up and saw a plume of smoke rising on the sea surface, and a beautiful arc came straight towards the direction of the sandbar.

He stared with his mouth wide open for less than a second, then suddenly, as if understanding something, threw himself to the ground and crawled behind a mound using both hands and feet.

Almost at the same time, a cannonball fell from the sky and landed on the ice surface beside the artillery team. It exploded with a loud bang.

Shrapnel from the exploded cannonball and ice splinters splashed in all directions. Rebel soldiers and refugees nearby who didn't have time to dodge screamed and fell to the ground covered in blood.

Then, more cannon sounds came from the sea surface and the direction of the fortress on the island. Under the clear blue sky, cannonballs dragging white smoke trails cut through the air, making whistling sounds and falling continuously towards the sandbar.

Cannonballs fell continuously around the six Red Barbarian Cannons. Explosion sounds were deafening and rose one after another. Thick smoke and fierce fire enveloped the entire artillery team's position.

The Thousand-man Commander, who was usually majestic, decisive in killing, and chopped people like killing chickens, had been blown into a dozen pieces of minced meat in the first bombardment. One of his arms landed on Ma Linxi's head, almost scaring him to death.

Good Heavens! These village braves' cannons are so powerful! Just as Ma Linxi's thought turned, a hissing 68-pound spherical explosive shell emitting sparks fell directly onto a wheelbarrow loaded with ammunition. With a flash of fire, several gun carriages fully loaded with gunpowder were detonated simultaneously. A huge blast wave lifted Ma Linxi directly from the ground.

For a moment, Ma Linxi thought he was dead. He completely couldn't breathe, his vision turning black. It took a long while to recover. He felt the world spinning, ears buzzing, hearing nothing, only seeing black and red before his eyes, burning hot. After calming down, he saw the coolie Qian Erleng, who was with him, lying motionless under a blown-off wheel, covered in blood. Qian Erleng had given him half a bowl of noodle soup before; the two were considered friends in adversity. He hurriedly crawled over and pushed Qian Erleng, only to see Qian Erleng turn over and roll down the sandbar with a "gulu" sound, leaving a trail of blood and scattered internal organs all over the ground—only the half body above the chest remained, as if cut in half by a big hay cutter.

Ma Linxi didn't know if he screamed. He couldn't hear anything. He only saw vehicles, cannons, and human corpses in front of him mixed with soil being constantly lifted up, torn apart, and falling down. He let out a silent scream and drilled his head hard towards the earth.

On the bridge of the *Daishuang*, Lu Yang searched the situation on the sandbar with a telescope in vain—thick black smoke rolled in the distance. Cannonballs fired from warships on the sea surface and the bastions of the Willow Palisade had completely enveloped the target area. He couldn't see the effect of the bombardment at all at such a long distance.

However, in terms of this firepower coverage, the rebel artillery team completely exposed on the ground should no longer exist. He observed at least three powder mass explosions in the telescope.

A "cease fire" signal rocket was fired from Qimu Island.

"Stop firing, all ships!" He ordered, walking quickly to the radio. Sure enough, Chen Sigen was calling him.

"The artillery position has been eliminated. Shift fire to area 2976 in five minutes. Use shrapnel!"

"Shift fire to area 2976 in five minutes, fire shrapnel!" Lu Yang repeated his instruction. The gunnery officer and several sergeants leaned over the work table, working tensely with slide rules and dividers.

To save calculation time and also to adapt to artillery command personnel with low levels, they adopted a numbered grid firing mode. The surroundings of Qimu Island were all numbered with grids, and each grid had a specific range table. This ensured centralized firing on each sector within the shortest time.

The 130mm cannons on Gunboat 901 emitted wisps of white smoke. Gunners were scrubbing the bores with the fastest speed, quickly clearing the residue after continuous firing to let the gun barrels cool down as soon as possible.

Cone-shaped shrapnel shells and cylindrical silk powder bags had been lifted to the deck by pulleys, waiting to be loaded.

Chen Sigen put down the telescope: the sea breeze had blown away the distant smoke. Although the burning gun carriages were still emitting rolling thick smoke, not a single complete cannon or living person could be seen in the telescope. The power of explosive shell covering fire was indeed amazing. Since the biggest threat had been removed, the rest was just a rabble. He observed from the platform down to the gun emplacement; two naval 68-pound carronades had returned to horizontal positions, and gunners were quickly scrubbing the bores. The direct fire range of this kind of gun was very short: only a short fifty meters. But the fired shells were extremely powerful, and the damage effect on wooden ships was extremely strong. Chen Sigen had no warship targets available, so this time he used them in the role of mortars.

When firing in a high arc, the trajectory of a carronade was similar to a mortar, and the range was naturally much farther. The 68-pound explosive shells fired continuously just now exerted extremely considerable power—the power of high-density loaded black powder was far better than Chen Sigen's most ideal estimate.

A few more rounds of shrapnel, and he wasn't afraid the enemy wouldn't rout.

"Load shrapnel for all cannons!" He issued the command. The cannons on the Willow Palisade bastion, including 2 68-pound carronades and 4 24-pound smoothbore chase guns, all began loading this terrible shell.
