# Chapter 892 - Grain Supply

The bulk of supplies was grain. Jeju Island and Kaohsiung would take 6 months to achieve grain self-sufficiency; the Taiwan Kaohsiung-Pingtung region would take at least 4 months. That meant from the start of Operation Engine, grain needs for 200,000 refugees had to be maintained for 5 months, along with guaranteeing food for about 10,000 naturalized personnel.

Calculated by caloric value, each refugee needed 350 grams of brown rice daily—although relatively low, most refugees weren't assigned labor and focused on recuperation. Thus 70 tons of brown rice were needed daily, 2100 tons monthly, totaling 10,500 tons for 5 months. Participating personnel were supplied 750 grams daily on average. Grain consumed monthly was 225 tons of rice. Requirement was 1200 tons. Additionally, the Ministry of Health suggested adding 10% vegetables and protein from a nutritional perspective to guarantee refugees' health. So a certain amount of vegetables and seafood also needed to be provided. Most of this portion of supplies could be solved by organizing refugees to produce on-site locally—the Heaven and Earth Society would provide technical guidance, seeds, and tools.

This grain didn't include ration needs for indigenous people on Jeju Island. Although there were certainly some grain reserves on the island, Jeju Island itself wasn't a grain-producing area; even in the 21st century, the main agricultural product on Jeju Island was citrus. Most land on the island was used to raise horses. Clearly, the island's grain originally needed external input.

"According to intelligence data we consulted, the Joseon Dynasty has a very large-scale Superindency (Gamyeong) on Jeju Island," Thorpe said. "Official slaves number at least ten thousand. To support these official slaves, the Superindency must have one or two months of grain reserves. The small number of commoners on the island should also have some grain, so we don't need to supply them temporarily. But later supply must be taken into account."

Jeju Island wasn't far from either the Korean Peninsula or the Japanese archipelago; supplementing some grain from these two places on a small scale was achievable. Japan had started restricting silver exports then, but there was no news of restricting rice exports.

The difficult part was the transit base in Taiwan. There were no grain purchasing channels locally. Taiwan's indigenous agriculture was very primitive, with absolutely no spare capacity to supply grain. The Dutch were interested in trade, not land reclamation and farming. Although the Beigang area had Fujian immigrants reclaiming land since the Yan Siqi era, and Zheng Zhilong constantly sent immigrants there, Taiwan's grain production had always been less than ideal, relying on external input even into the Qing Dynasty. The possibility of getting grain supply from Zheng Zhilong was minimal. Buying grain from the mainland was also less likely—Fujian was originally a grain-deficient province.

The bulk of grain supply could only rely on self-transport. The logistics department needed to prepare large amounts of grain. The Planning Commission had made contingencies for grain supply—people snatched from Shandong and Zhejiang had to be fed and clothed; all this had to be planned centrally.

Now the Lingao regime controlled not just Lingao County. After the Summer Awakening Campaign, local regimes across Qiongzhou had been completely controlled by the Senate following the "Ming Skin, Australian Heart" model. The grain supply situation had improved—but improvement was limited.

Counties in Southern Qiongzhou had scarce fields and contributed little to expanding grain reserves—one only had to look at grain tax figures from Southern Qiongzhou counties to know local agricultural productivity; only Yazhou's grain tax was three thousand shi, while counties like Gan'en and Huichang were just over a thousand shi or even a few hundred. Relatively speaking, agricultural conditions in Northern Qiongzhou counties were better, especially Qiongshan and Wenchang where agriculture was most developed, being Qiongzhou Prefecture's main grain production areas. Work teams of the Civil Affairs People's Committee had begun carrying out "cleaning up land tax" work in Northern Qiongzhou counties one by one starting from the second half of 1630.

The total land tax and surcharges of the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture was 85,459 shi. Part was collected in grain, part in silver. Since Qiongzhou Prefecture's commodity economy was weak and silver circulation very low, most was still valued in grain.

Of this standard quota, more than half had to be shipped to the Capital, Departments, and Lianzhou. That is, forty to fifty thousand shi had to be shipped out of Qiongzhou Prefecture annually. About forty-something thousand shi remained in the prefecture, used for military pay, administrative expenses, and reserve grain. This remaining part was naturally the Planning Commission's disposable grain.

Of course, the actual grain paid by commoners was far more than eighty-five thousand shi, according to the experience of the Civil Affairs People's Committee and Tax General Bureau's "land tax cleanup" work in Lingao. The prefecture's actual grain payment should be at least one hundred forty thousand shi. The surplus grain was actually embezzled layer by layer.

In other words, the Senate could collect one hundred forty thousand shi from Qiongzhou Prefecture while maintaining existing burden levels. After paying the forty-something thousand shi of rated tax to the Ming Dynasty, the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture could contribute about one hundred thousand shi of brown rice to the Senate.

Besides this land tax, the Planning Commission intended to acquire another ten or twenty thousand shi of grain from farmers and landlords through purchasing. However, to complete the purchasing task, they had to stimulate their demand for acquiring currency. Currently, when Senate enterprises still lacked sufficient industrial products to market to rural areas, the goal could only be achieved through taxation means. This required coordination with tax system reform. Folks at Wudaokou believed: long-term, monetized taxation was the general direction.

Of course, collection, processing, and storage were long-term works, not instantaneous. Fortunately, collecting and transporting refugees was also a long-term process, not suddenly adding 200,000 people at once. The Planning Commission still had ample time to collect and prepare grain.

Besides the Senate's own grain reserves, the Summer Awakening Campaign also brought extra reserves to the Planning Commission. That was the five large official warehouses on Hainan Island: Qiongshan's Guangfeng Warehouse, storing 16,000 shi of rice annually; Danzhou's Dafeng Warehouse, 3,000 shi; Changhua's Guangchu Warehouse, 5,600 shi; Wanzhou's Guangji Warehouse, 4,000 shi; and Junchu and Qinglan Warehouses, storing 13,000 shi annually.

These official warehouses were supposed to store tens of thousands of shi of grain annually, mainly for "guarding against the Li." Once a large-scale "Li Rebellion" occurred, the great army crossing the sea to suppress it could take grain locally.

However, like all systems in this world, good systems weren't necessarily maintained well. According to official documents, accumulated grain in these main official warehouses should be hundreds of thousands of shi. But actually, deficits were extremely severe. The Planning Commission's Special Search Team went deep into warehouses of every prefecture and county with troops and work teams, becoming completely used to embezzlement phenomena. But the magnitude of the deficit in these five great warehouses still left the leading elder dumbfounded.

Actual inventory of the five warehouses showed that after removing aged grain purely making up numbers that could at most serve as fodder, usable grain was less than one-tenth of the book inventory.

The Special Search Team subsequently conducted concentrated torture and interrogation to recover stolen goods from clerks, managers, and warehouse workers, recovering large amounts of property and grain, and confiscating large amounts of land thereby. It counted as a minor harvest.

"In the previous phase, taking over various local official warehouses yielded ten thousand shi of brown rice and miscellaneous grains, totaling about 9000 tons. This grain is enough as startup grain," Wu De said. "Currently our relief rations draw on our own dried sweet potato reserves. We still have quite a lot of dried sweet potatoes. This can roughly sustain refugee consumption."

"This makes us a bit tight; it's like taking out our entire foundation. I originally thought grain reserves were loosening up a bit." He Ming was somewhat worried—grain was the army's lifeline. Thinking of transporting away so much grain made him feel very uneasy.

Zhan Wuya also felt it was risky: "Excluding the army, we have large numbers of non-production population in Lingao—administrative personnel, students, workers. Grain supply for this group can't go wrong, otherwise it's easy to shake the foundation of the state."

Wu De had already calculated this issue: "Grain security is guaranteed. First, this grain for Operation Engine was obtained extra. We obtained this grain without increasing the population we support. Using it on refugees doesn't reduce our existing reserves, nor increase our originally planned grain expenditure. Second, after gaining political power over the whole island, it equals gaining power to collect the whole island's land tax for 1631. Revenue increase in this aspect is significant. And it's stable revenue increase. unlike spoils which are one-time."

Furthermore, the Planning Commission prepared to expand grain imports as an important measure to guarantee grain security. The focus was importing Siamese rice. Sourcing rice from Vietnam started to decrease in supply and increase in price with the intensification of the Northern and Southern Dynasties War. Cheap and plentiful Siamese rice became the next target for the Planning Commission to increase grain reserves. Only this would occupy shipping tonnage. But overall, grain pressure wasn't as big as everyone thought.

Wu De explained: Refugee transport is a long-term plan. From transporting the first batch to final conclusion, it takes four or five months at minimum to one or two years at most. As long as the first batch of refugees is organized in time to clear land and plant diverse early-maturing crops at transit camps, harvest can actually be achieved after three or four months. Harvested grain can replace part of the supply locally. So not all refugee rations need to be calculated in.

Early-maturing sweet potato varieties possessed by the Agricultural Committee could be harvested in about 80~90 days; potatoes and buckwheat also had suitable varieties. The Kaohsiung/Pingtung area had an average annual temperature as high as 25°C and abundant rain; planting could be done year-round. Adopting rolling planting and echelon harvesting. By the time large-scale immigration from Zhejiang ended, Kaohsiung agriculture might not provide grain for Jeju Island, but self-sufficiency for a considerable portion was achievable.

"...If a supply shortage really happens, we can also utilize the Hong Kong base. Directly purchase grain in Guangdong then ship to Kaohsiung. The distance between the two places is only 350 nautical miles. A round trip takes only a week." He concluded.
