# Chapter 1009 Explosive Shell Test

Regarding manufacturing quality, fuzes made by naturalized citizen workers weren't worse than those made by Senators; the difference in firing rate was negligible. It appeared Lin Shenhe's efforts to simplify fuze structure ensured that naturalized citizen workers with lower technical levels could produce qualified products.

As for safety, testing confirmed that dropping from 12 meters height to impact the ground without pulling the safety pin guaranteed no accidental firing.

However, the Ordnance Group wasn't simply satisfied with this—any industrial product, besides meeting functional requirements, also had material cost control and mass production organization needs. Fuzes as consumables had to be as cheap and easy to produce as possible. Although phosphor bronze springs could be self-produced, in Lingao's industrial system they were "high-grade precision components," belonging to the Planning Bureau's "Level 2 controlled materials."

Currently, phosphor bronze springs were mainly used in relatively precise industrial equipment, such as the timekeepers and instruments Dr. Zhong had been wholeheartedly developing—their production cost was very high.

Ideally, they could be substituted with more inferior, easily obtainable materials. After much consideration, Lin Shenhe found Zhan Wuya and asked if he could heat-treat wrought iron wire.

"Of course, but what do you want heat-treated wrought iron wire for?" Zhan Wuya was puzzled.

"To make springs—for artillery shell fuzes."

Zhan Wuya looked at him incredulously: springs for artillery shell fuzes were an oft-discussed stumbling block, and now Lin Shenhe was telling him he wanted to use heat-treated wrought iron wire!

The Industrial Committee produced different gauge wrought iron wire according to old dimension standards; higher grades were even galvanized—wrought iron wire had broad uses in the Senate's industrial and agricultural production; Lingao Telecom's telegraphs were also laid using wrought iron wire.

Lin Shenhe produced a fuze structural model—a proportional cross-section model he had commissioned from the machinery factory—and explained the specific working conditions and principles in detail. Zhan Wuya studied it for a long time, finally agreeing to try with iron wire.

They selected 20-gauge galvanized wrought iron wire. Using a specialized spring-coiling machine, they wound the wrought iron wire into springs, then heat-treated them.

Subsequently, Lin Shenhe conducted comparative tests between wrought iron wire springs and phosphor bronze springs using testing equipment. He himself knew perfectly well: these two types of springs having completely identical performance was impossible. The results naturally didn't surprise him.

"It seems they can't substitute." Zhan Wuya said.

"Let's try firing them from artillery." Lin Shenhe wasn't giving up.

Fuze shells fitted with wrought iron wire springs succeeded when fired with strong charges from mortars, with safety and firing rate no worse than phosphor bronze springs. But firing from the 70mm cannon had poor results, with multiple spring failures—high-bore-pressure rifled cannons like the cannon were far more demanding on fuzes.

Lin Shenhe expressed satisfaction with all test results and decided to proceed with formal live-fire testing with actual charges.

The black powder charge columns sent for drying had all naturally dried. The final process was coating charge column surfaces with shellac varnish in alcohol at specified concentration. This was both moisture-proof and prevented cracking and deformation.

Shellac was imported from India and Vietnam, being lac insect secretions. It had broad uses in industrial fields; for an industrial system like Lingao's lacking chemical products, lac's importance as natural resin was even more significant.

The Machinery Department's weapons enthusiasts began filling artillery shells. High-compressed black powder charge columns could no longer be simply detonated with fuses; ignition devices—blasting caps—had to be used.

Manufacturing blasting caps was quite dangerous. Technically there was no difficulty. The process was rolling kraft paper into tubes, then filling primer with a press, finally sealing. Previously, to reduce danger, the military-industrial department rarely manufactured blasting caps. Explosive weapons based on black powder generally didn't need blasting caps; only when using dynamite and ammonium nitrate explosives were small quantities of blasting caps manufactured.

The Special Chemicals Complex Research Center No. 1's warehouse stored small quantities of blasting cap shells and safety caps. Blasting cap shells were rolled from kraft paper, coated inside and out with shellac varnish in alcohol at specified concentration for moisture-proofing. Lin Shenhe personally selected twenty for use as experimental shell blasting caps.

Common blasting caps were divided into single and compound types. Single type contained only mercury fulminate; compound type had mercury fulminate on top and booster charge below—usually TNT or RDX.

Because the Chemical Department couldn't produce TNT, all blasting caps previously manufactured by the military-industrial department were single-type—this time, to ensure effective detonation, Bai Yu suggested manufacturing compound blasting caps. But Lin Shenhe opposed—no matter how capable they were, they couldn't conjure TNT.

"We could use stockpiled ammonium nitrate explosives, and don't we still have the explosives Landu brought?"

"This is meaningless—we currently can't mass-produce either one. We should test according to industrial mass production conditions."

Finally, they decided to continue manufacturing single blasting caps. In the blasting cap workshop, Lin Shenhe carefully loaded mercury fulminate into tube shells in several batches, then lightly pressed down with a press—to ensure safety, he operated standing behind thick steel plate, wearing an explosion-proof helmet. Mercury fulminate was extremely sensitive; explosions during pressing were very easy.

After mercury fulminate powder was pressed, he picked up a safety cap made from galvanized sheet iron—containing a thin silk piece inside—fitted it onto the tube shell, and turned the press handle.

According to technical requirements, the press pressed the safety cap into the tube shell with specified force per square centimeter. Lin Shenhe checked if the join was complete, then used a brush to carefully sweep away powder scattered on the tube shell, collecting scattered mercury fulminate into waste containers. Finally, shellac varnish in alcohol was applied to the tube shell bottom, completing one blasting cap.

Then, at the test site, another blasting cap trial detonation was conducted. Shells with new blasting caps were fitted with fuzes and underwent striking tests according to combat requirements, ensuring the fuze striker could effectively strike the blasting cap.

The first striking failed—the striker position was inaccurate. Jiang Ye adjusted on-site; the second immediately succeeded. After several consecutive tests, every blasting cap was accurately struck.

Lin Shenhe nodded: "Now we can assemble." He signed the assembly task order, formally ordering assembly of explosive shells with new fuzes.

The new fuzes finally had their formal debut. The 70mm rifled cannon borrowed last time was still at the range. Lin Shenhe also borrowed a 24-pounder smoothbore howitzer—without mortars, and the mortar not quite suitable, temporarily using it as substitute.

"Can conical shells also be fired from smoothbore cannons?" Zhan Wuya asked.

"Of course." Lin Shenhe said. "Mortars don't fire spherical shells either."

Simple rails had been laid at the range. Railcars transported 40 newly produced shells for both cannons: half with phosphor bronze springs and half with 20-gauge wrought iron wire springs.

"24-pounder howitzer, Shell A, load one!" Lin Shenhe commanded from the bunker with a large tin megaphone. An artillery crew from the Army Instruction Corps responsible for cannon firing quickly opened the wicker shell crate, took out a shell, and attached the fuze. One gunner loaded the silk propellant bag through the muzzle into the bore; the loader then loaded the shell through the muzzle.

The gunner inserted the firing tube at the rear firing port and attached the lanyard—for safety, the lanyard was very long, extending all the way to a bunker 20 meters away.

With a whistle, all gunners ran together to jump into the bunker. Then, warning sirens for live-fire testing echoed overhead.

"Fire!" Lin Shenhe yelled, then quickly ducked back into the bunker, pressing his eyes to the binocular periscope newly made by the Optical Workshop.

The gunner gave a hard pull on the lanyard. The 24-pounder howitzer roared, the heavy gun body recoiling backward, ejecting thick white smoke. Through the periscope, the shell's trajectory arcing through the air was visible—under the smoothbore and brown powder combination, muzzle velocity was still somewhat low.

The shell accurately landed in the designated impact area; a flash of light—it exploded!

The explosion's power, even visually, was obviously much stronger than primitive spherical black powder explosive shells—those shells' explosions after landing only raised a cloud of black smoke, kicking up relatively little dirt.

"Let's go see." Lin Shenhe hurriedly climbed out of the bunker and, together with Jiang Ye, Wang Ruixiang, and several military-industrial department apprentices, climbed onto the farm vehicle, bumping along the dirt road toward the impact area.

The 24-pounder explosive shell left a crater half a person deep in the impact area, still wisping smoke. The air was filled with black powder's pungent smell. Lin Shenhe squatted down, poking at the soil by the crater's edge. Several students interning at Research Center No. 1 quickly spread out, searching the surroundings for shell fragments, marking them on the map.

"Look, with greater charge power, the shell fragmentation is also stronger than before." He said, pointing at collected fragments.

Not only did fragments fly farther than before, but fragmentation was also greater than spherical shells. Previous spherical explosive shells, after exploding, produced only twenty-odd large fragments—some even only burst into seven or eight pieces—unable to form dense fragment kills. Even the largest-caliber mortar shells with the most charge couldn't produce more fragments.

But now, simple searching within five meters of the crater found over seventy fragments of various sizes. Lin Shenhe pointed out that if shell body materials could be further improved and pre-formed fragmentation measures adopted, post-explosion fragment effects would be much better.

Firing Shell A with phosphor bronze springs from both cannons: all twenty firings succeeded. Testing Shell B fuzes: complete success on the 24-pounder smoothbore. But on the third firing from the 70mm rifled cannon, everyone in the bunker only felt a flash of light; a huge muffled boom transmitted from the ground, and the earth slightly trembled—the shell had exploded in the bore.
