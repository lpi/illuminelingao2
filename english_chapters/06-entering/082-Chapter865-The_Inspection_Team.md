# Chapter 865 - The Inspection Team

The External Intelligence Bureau's Xu Ke had conducted extensive research on the issue of coastal navigation safety. After all, he was the Navy's specialized naval intelligence officer assigned to the External Intelligence Bureau.

Through consulting historical materials and conversations with large numbers of native and naturalized sailors and merchants, Xu Ke concluded that Dabo Shipping's small number of transport vessels could freely pass through Fujian waters, but ships needed to be adequately armed to handle possible small-scale pirate attacks. However, he also pointed out: if large numbers of ships passed through, Zheng Zhilong's attitude might change—any substantial shipping operation could attract the attention of these maritime powers.

"Additionally, we should consider one thing: traditional Chinese navigation generally didn't stray from the coast. Landmarks along the shore were often used as reference points for navigation. Even routes to Southeast Asia tried to follow island chains as much as possible. But the senior officers we've trained can rely on sextants and nautical charts to navigate the open ocean, away from coastlines, thereby avoiding coastal routes that are easily monitored and blockaded."

After thorough discussion and preparation, the second inspection team boarded a Dabo Shipping medium-sized *fuchuan* and set sail for Hangzhou. This *fuchuan* was a vessel that Dabo Company had specially modified for transporting important persons and cargo.

The ship was equipped with smoothbore cannons for self-defense. Also aboard were plainclothes personnel from the escort bureau and the Special Reconnaissance Unit to ensure travel safety. The Special Reconnaissance Unit carried not only SKS rifles and grenades but also machine guns and disposable rocket launchers—guaranteeing the inspection team's absolute security at sea.

The inspection team's destination port was Shanghai County. Qiwei Escort Bureau had established a water route branch office in Shanghai County, specifically responsible for transshipment of people and goods through the Shanghai docks.

Hangzhou had used Yanpu as its seaport during the Yuan Dynasty, but by the late Ming, silting had made it difficult for oceangoing ships to enter and exit. Hangzhou's seaport shifted to Zhapu and Ningbo. Naval and Dabo Shipping personnel discussed this and concluded that rather than going to Zhapu or Ningbo, they should go directly to Shanghai to first survey the local hydrographic and geographic conditions. After landing in Shanghai, an advance team would conduct a field survey of the overland and waterway conditions between Shanghai and Hangzhou, preparing for future refugee transfers from Zhejiang to Shanghai.

The inspection team's journey proceeded very smoothly. The *fuchuan* took an "outer sea" route—"outer sea" being merely a coastal route by old time-space standards, but at that time, sailing out of sight of land beyond the "inner waters" was uncommon. The ship encountered no dangers whatsoever and arrived safely at Shanghai port in late April.

Shanghai County had a long history, with records dating back to the Tang Dynasty, but it had no city walls until the mid-Ming. The county seat was walled in the 32nd year of Jiajing, "for defense against Japanese pirates." The wall circumference was nine *li*, height two *zhang* four *chi*, with six major and minor gates—four at the cardinal directions named Chaozong, Kuahai, Yifeng, and Yanhai, plus two smaller gates called Baodai and Chaoyang, commonly known as Little East Gate and Little South Gate.

The dock along the Wusong River was just outside Little East Gate. Since the "Longqing Opening of the Seas," this place had gradually become a port city. Shanghai County was in Songjiang Prefecture, famous for cotton cloth and called "clothing the realm"—even in Hainan Island, birthplace of China's cotton weaving industry, Songjiang cloth could be found. As a cotton cloth export port, Shanghai's streets showed some prosperity. However, compared to the thriving foreign trade of Fujian and Guangdong at the time, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces lagged behind in this regard. Historically prominent foreign trade ports like Taicang Liuhe and Ningbo could now no longer compare to Zhangzhou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou.

As soon as the ship arrived, people were standing at the dock waiting. Seeing the *fuchuan* flying the Dabo flag approach the shore, they immediately waved in greeting. Standing at the bow was Xu Ke from the External Intelligence Bureau. This trip, he not only had the task of escorting the inspection team but also of personally observing the hydrographic conditions along the route. He immediately responded with hand signals. The gangplank wasn't even fully secured when the leader of the reception party scrambled aboard, nimble as could be, clearly someone accustomed to life on the water.

The man approached and bowed: "Would this be Master Xu?"

News of Xu Ke and others' impending arrival had been sent by coded scroll message from Qiwei Escort Bureau's Guangzhou headquarters a month ago, transmitted through the bureau's chain of branch offices via human messengers and pigeons, station by station, until it reached Shanghai. The scroll detailed how many people were coming, how many rooms and warehouses were needed, and how many porters to prepare.

Though not as fast as telegraph, this system wasn't slower than the court's postal relay system. Transmission from Guangzhou to Shanghai took less than ten days—actually faster than the special couriers carrying important court documents. This was partly because Qiwei, under the guidance of Agricultural Committee horse and pigeon breeding expert Nik, had established an effective carrier pigeon communication network. They had also recruited a number of professional personnel—the court's reduction of postal station staff had released large numbers of experienced relay workers, from whom Qiwei had recruited many capable specialists.

After receiving Xu Ke's confirmation, the man gave a crisp salute: "Greetings to Master Xu. This humble one is Mao Sansheng, at your service!"

The visitor was the manager of Qiwei's Shanghai branch office. He was a distant relative of Sun Kecheng's mother. He had formerly worked as a log-raft driver on the Gan River. Raft workers on long-distance water routes typically knew some fighting skills for self-defense. Later, finding himself unemployed, Mao Sansheng came to join Qiwei in Guangzhou, becoming one of the many "old cousins" who sought out Sun Kecheng. Mao Sansheng's martial skills weren't sufficient for escort work, so Sun Kecheng first assigned him to run errands, later putting him as a clerk at a branch office. Although Mao Sansheng came from a log-rafting background, he had quite a knack for dealing with people. The Political Security General Administration had secretly evaluated him, rating his reliability as B-level, and sent him to Shanghai as branch manager.

"Everything is prepared," Mao Sansheng bowed. "The masters will be lodging at Pan Garden. Cargo will be stored temporarily at our branch warehouse. Once the boats are ready, everything will be shipped together. Sedan chairs are waiting at the dock."

"Good. Go attend to things at the dock."

As soon as Mao Sansheng left, Xu Ke returned to the cabin. He instructed everyone to pack up and prepare to disembark—particularly to make sure fake hair queues were properly worn to avoid exposure. The others were easy; Jin Lige posed a slight problem, given his prominent nose and deep-set eyes that attracted attention. Some disguise was necessary.

Because Qiwei's Shanghai branch was still in its startup phase with insufficient housing, Mao Sansheng feared he couldn't properly accommodate the elders and had borrowed Pan Garden from a local gentry family, the Pans, as lodging for the elders.

This location was just behind the City God Temple in Shanghai County—precisely the predecessor of what would become Shanghai's first famous garden, Yuyuan, in the old time-space. In this time-space, Yuyuan was the property of Pan Yunduan, who had served as Provincial Administration Commissioner of Sichuan during the Jiajing era. It was currently still in the hands of Pan family descendants. Though located in the city's bustling district, it was quiet amid the noise, elegant and serene. Food and access were very convenient.

The group stayed at Pan Garden for several days while Mao Sansheng ran about arranging boats. From Hangzhou to Shanghai, there was of course an official road, but for comfortable and safe travel, going by boat was better. Besides, they had considerable heavy cargo that would be even more inconvenient to transport overland.

"To think we'd be staying in Yuyuan. It's almost like a dream."

Lanterns lit, several elders sat together in a flower hall in Pan Garden. Xu Ke couldn't help remarking.

All the elders felt somewhat as if they were dreaming. In another time-space, they had all been to Shanghai, had visited the famous City God Temple, toured Yuyuan, and some had even drunk tea in the teahouse by the Nine-Turns Bridge and eaten the famous *xiaolongbao*. Now they were actually staying in Yuyuan—though of course Pan Garden was only Yuyuan's predecessor.

Zhou Dongtian picked up a piece of hawthorn jelly from the table—the four plates of pastries had been "respectfully presented" by the Pan family master. The group's board and lodging at Pan Garden was entirely supplied by the Pan family, with Pan family servants attending them. The Pans were after all gentry, and their food and enjoyments were extremely refined. This hawthorn jelly wasn't the old time-space kind made mostly of sugar and substitutes, basically a gelatinous blob. This was genuine peeled hawthorn with tribute sugar, simmered until it was sweet-tart, soft yet firm.

Of course, this hospitality wasn't entirely free. After they left, Mao Sansheng would duly present a substantial "gift of thanks."

"Your horizons are too small," Zhou Dongtian said, eating his hawthorn jelly. "What's a little Yuyuan? Someday I'm going to the Forbidden City, to sleep a few nights in His Imperial Majesty's bedchamber..."

"That building actually isn't comfortable at all," said Mei Lin, who had toured the Palace Museum. "I really can't imagine the emperor living in such a place. The inner palace isn't impressive when you think about it—just ordinary brick and tile buildings. Not to mention water and heating systems. Hot in summer, cold in winter—now I understand why Manchu emperors all built travel palaces outside Beijing."

"I think throwing a grand banquet in the Hall of Supreme Harmony would be quite nice," said Lü Zhonghang, who had come from the Transportation Department. "Set up five hundred tables, each person at a large round table, and behind each person a row of princesses, county princesses, titled ladies, young misses of all types, of all complexions. Orchestras on the terrace, one Chinese and one European. When Director Wen raises his glass to toast, the orchestras play..."

"Bullshit. Why would Director Wen be giving toasts?" Zhou Dongtian expressed disdain. "It's not like he's chairman for life."

"Fine, whichever elder then—what do you think of this great feast?"

"Stop with the fantasies," Xu Ke said. "Mao Sansheng says we'll have to stay here for a few days. During this time, does anyone want to tour Shanghai and observe the actual market conditions?"

"Yes, of course we do. Otherwise, why did we come here?" Zhou Dongtian said without hesitation. "We came to Jiangnan to understand local social conditions. Staying cooped up in a garden, we won't see anything."

Although Shanghai County wasn't a famous city in this time-space, it was after all a county in Songjiang Prefecture, renowned for cotton spinning. Shanghai itself was alluvial land, mostly sandy soil, very suitable for growing cotton. So local cotton weaving and cotton cultivation were quite substantial, worth investigating.

The next day, led by Qiwei personnel, they toured Shanghai County. Shanghai County already had over 100,000 households at the time, with over 30,000 households living within the city walls. Among the more than one thousand county seats in the realm, it could be considered a fairly large county. When passing bridges and road junctions, Zhou Dongtian noticed many people in tattered clothes gathered at bridge heads and teahouses. Every one of them had a sallow, hungry look, yet they clearly weren't beggars or refugees. He asked Mao Sansheng about them.

"Master, those are all weavers, some dyers and calenderers too." Mao Sansheng said the county had over two thousand craftsmen "eating cloth for a living," mostly day laborers paid by the piece.

"Recently the cloth market has been bad. The workshop owners can barely keep their own pots boiling—who's going to hire craftsmen?"

"Cloth isn't selling well?"

"Since last year, cloth prices have been very poor. Cloth can't be sold at a decent price," Mao Sansheng said. "It's not just workshop owners and weavers suffering—even the villagers who grow cotton in the countryside are having a hard time. If cloth won't sell, cotton sells for even less."

Zhou Dongtian and the others were speechless. They had assumed that since Songjiang cloth was "clothing the realm," there would be no shortage of buyers. They hadn't expected the local cotton weaving industry to have declined to such an extent. The Ming economy not only had problems—it had serious problems.

They walked all the way to a grand mansion in Taiqing Ward in the county seat—a place commonly called the "Nine-Room Building." Mao Sansheng said quietly that this was Xu Guangqi's old residence.

"The house currently has no Xu family members living in it. Only a few servants are watching over it."

As one of the relatively few people in China at the time who "had their eyes open to the world," Xu Guangqi was already seventy years old. But he was not currently in his Shanghai County residence. He had been made Minister of Rites and Hanlin Academy Scholar the previous year, and was Associate Manager of the Heir Apparent's Household. His family was mostly in Beijing.

Xu Guangqi's son Xu Ji was related by marriage to Sun Yuanhua—the two were in-laws. Because of the connection to the Dengzhou Rebellion, the External Intelligence Bureau had paid close attention to the Xu Guangqi network. One mission of the intelligence team dispatched to the capital was to use Jesuit connections to establish contact with Xu Guangqi. On the Shanghai side, for now there would be no action—only orders to Qiwei to monitor the Shanghai Xu family's activities.

Mao Sansheng told Zhou Dongtian that outside Kuahai Gate—the South Gate—in Kangqu Lane, the Xu family had "Double Garden," ancestral property serving as the Xu family's vegetable garden and mulberry orchard. Sweet potatoes had been brought from Fujian and Guangdong to Jiangnan by Xu Guangqi, who was the first to successfully cultivate them there. Outside the North Gate was a peach orchard with many peach trees that yielded quite well. In Fahua Town, there was another farmstead villa called "Houle Hall," which was also where the Xu family cemetery was located.

"That's Xujiahui!" Zhou Dongtian blurted out. He knew the origin of the name Xujiahui. Xujiahui was the location of this Xu family property; Xu Guangqi's descendants had once gathered here, which was how it got its name.

Mao Sansheng looked at him in bewilderment, not understanding where "Xujiahui" had come from. Zhou Dongtian just smiled and didn't explain.

Besides the city residence, the Xu family's properties in Shanghai were almost entirely agricultural. Although Xu Guangqi's grandfather had risen through commerce, the Xu family didn't have much involvement in business. But Xu Guangqi wasn't the farming-and-reading type either. Though he didn't have much land, he cultivated every plot carefully, studying agricultural techniques, irrigation, and field management in depth, so his land yields were quite good. Although later generations would know Xu Guangqi as a scientist who spread Western learning, he could actually also be considered a successful agricultural capitalist—such people were already appearing in considerable numbers at the time.

Evidently Qiwei's efficiency in the area was quite good; they quickly gathered detailed information about the Xu family. Though Zhou Dongtian thought it wasn't particularly significant.

The group also visited several land and water docks inside and outside Shanghai county to observe transportation conditions. Lü Zhonghang in the inspection team had been sent by the Transportation Department to survey Jiangnan's road and transportation conditions. He held dual degrees in electrical engineering and bridge engineering, and had previously specialized in road and bridge quality inspection.

Surveying transportation wasn't just for future military planning; more importantly, it prepared for developing Jiangnan commerce in the future. Transportation was always a precondition for a region's economic development.

The next day, Mao Sansheng had the boats ready. These were two short-distance passenger boats common in Jiangnan for wealthy travelers, commonly called "Wuxi Fast Boats." The boats weren't large, but were fully equipped—with cabins for rest, parlors for dining and leisure, and a galley at the stern for convenient meal preparation. Wuxi Fast Boats were quite famous for travel comfort. For caution's sake, Mao Sansheng had replaced all the boat's crew with Qiwei personnel. This of course meant they would miss the famously attentive service of the Wuxi boat ladies. Besides the passenger boats, two freight boats accompanied them carrying luggage. Other cargo would be separately shipped in multiple batches by Qiwei.

After Zhou Dongtian's party boarded, they enjoyed the Jiangnan spring scenery along the way. When tired, they chatted in the cabins. Lü Zhonghang had more to do: he periodically measured water depths and observed the channel, accumulating firsthand data for future channel development and dredging.

Bored in the cabin, the group discussed transportation planning from Hangzhou to Shanghai. At the time, the most convenient route north from Hangzhou was obviously the Grand Canal. Going from Hangzhou along the canal directly to Suzhou was quick and convenient by water. But if the transfer dock was to be in Shanghai, Suzhou was still eighty or ninety kilometers from Shanghai.

"I've asked around. Mao Sansheng says there's a way from Shanghai County directly to Hangzhou without using the Grand Canal. But the channels along the route aren't as wide and deep as the Grand Canal. Probably won't accommodate heavily loaded large boats."

Jiangnan was known as a land of lakes and marshes, with not only lakes and ponds everywhere but rivers crisscrossing, plus vast areas of paddies. Except for prefectural and county seats, most villages weren't connected by land routes and could only be reached by water. Even between prefectural and county seats, though official roads connected them, water routes were more convenient. Inland water transport was highly developed. But most channels hadn't been dredged or maintained; many were too shallow or too narrow, accommodating only small boats. The largest were just so-called "channel boats." By Lü Zhonghang's estimate, these channel boats had a carrying capacity of only about twenty tons.
