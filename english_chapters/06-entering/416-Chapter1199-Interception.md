# Chapter 1199 - Interception

"We sailed east in the South China Sea. The *Feiyun* sailed in front as the navigator, followed by the flagship *Nongchao*, the collier *Haifeng* in the middle, and finally the [Daishuang] commanded by me. The ships formed a single column. The gunboat I commanded was the rear ship. Shortly after exiting the port and turning east, the flagship ordered tacking against the wind to save fuel. This greatly reduced speed, but to reserve fuel for the search and combat phases—this was pre-planned, and time was sufficient. On the way, every morning at 0800 hours, the 4 ships communicated with each other via radio and also reported to the Lingao main station. En route we conducted several coaling operations at sea—perilous situations abounded. Before reaching the Balintang Channel, we made sudden course changes several times; presumably *Feiyun*'s radar detected passing ships. But we didn't see any ships directly. Just at the Balintang Channel, we saw several small islands of the Babuyan group. We passed the Balintang Channel, rounding Luzon from the north, and the dark blue Philippine Sea unfolded before our eyes." — *Memoirs of Lü Yang (Internal Distribution) Volume I*

Guided by *Feiyun*'s radar, the formation maintained a distance of about 20 nautical miles from Luzon Island and began turning south. Along the way, winds were predominantly southeasterly below force 4, making sailing quite strenuous. Fortunately, ample time had been reserved. On July 3rd, the formation rounded Catanduanes Island from the east. Far on the horizon, the "world's most perfect cone," Mayon Volcano on Luzon, stood in the west; faint traces of volcanic ash seemed present among the few cirrus clouds in the blue sky. Continuing south, they reached the predetermined interception point the next day.

"San Bernardino Strait reached. But the coast here is full of coral reefs; better for us to stay safer far from shore."

"Let's deploy search formation tomorrow morning. Today we'll land and survey Samar Island briefly."

The formation anchored not far from Samar Island—Lin Chuanqing, being cautious, ordered the formation to standby in a bay of a small island on the other side. Although *Feiyun*'s weather radar showed all quiet, typhoons generated and developed extremely fast; for steamships, evasion was difficult once encountered.

Small boats were lowered from the big ships. The special ops team went ashore for a day of investigation, finding no Spanish strongholds, only seeing some local fishing villages from afar. But mosquitoes were numerous and terrifying. Before sunset, the special ops team withdrew to the ships. Legazpi City under Mayon Volcano wouldn't be built for a few years, and the transmigrators were temporarily too lazy to survey it.

Sailors caught some fresh seafood by the shore, so the Elders held a simple BBQ gathering on *Feiyun*.

"This is where the kill-stealing King *Nowaki* was beaten into parts, right? Coward Kurita and Bull Halsey—how great it would be to have a BB gun duel here."

"How about we support a few countries here later, specifically for an ironclad arms race? Steam, iron armor plus heavy guns, lining up here to blast each other—magnificent!"

"We'll just watch from airships in the sky? Quite a bit like Celestial Dragons. Probably won't happen until the day we die."

The Elders chatted and laughed on *Feiyun*'s deck while drinking Qian Shuiting's private stash of California wine.

"Battleship tech level is high; don't know if we can reach that level..."

"Personally I like that pile of weird ironclads from the late 19th century—bloated hulls, short thick guns, strange masts... so industrially beautiful. In comparison, post-Dreadnoughts were all cut from one mold, inevitably boring."

On the morning of July 15th, the formation deployed into search formation sailing east. The Type 854 modification was at the northernmost end, barely visible from Luzon, while *Feiyun* was at the southernmost end. Ships were spaced 5 nautical miles apart, spreading into a 15-nautical-mile-long Northwest-Southeast search line. The radio sent a simple message to Lingao: "Formation has deployed search at predetermined interception point."

Upon receiving the report, Chen Haiyang said to Fu Sansi: "The voyage was so smooth, better than expected. It's not bad for the first open ocean voyage to be this smooth."

"Not encountering others along the way wasn't easy. If only completing the mission could be this smooth too."

The interception point was indeed not a busy shipping lane; no merchant ships passed for several days. Even if signals appeared on radar, they were just small local fishing boats. Although some suggested "kill one every five steps, leave no trace for a thousand miles," the leaders thought it too troublesome and meaningless.

"What can these Malay paupers have? Not even worth the coal and bullets we consume." Lin Chuanqing stroked his beard.

At dawn on July 18th, *Feiyun*'s radar detected a signal 25 nautical miles to the east, moving slowly west. *Feiyun* immediately sent a telegram summoning the entire formation. The distance was still far; when combat started, walkie-talkies would be more real-time.

All ships increased boiler power to maximum, converging first. Half an hour later, as ships approached walkie-talkie range, Zhou Weisen impatiently grabbed the walkie-talkie requesting *Nongchao* to lower a boat to pick him up. *Feiyun* was too unique in this timeline, with low freeboard unsuitable for combat. It could only perform surveillance from afar.

After convergence, *Nongchao* took the lead, *Daishuang* in rear, heading toward the silver ship in a single column. Only *Feiyun*—with Zhou Weisen leaving a few people behind—and *Haifeng* remained in place, maintaining radar monitoring of positions. Simultaneously, *Feiyun* telegraphed Lingao: "Suspicious target discovered, fleet closing to engage. Wind Southeast, light breeze, wave height one meter."

Over an hour later, the target finally appeared in the telescopes of anxious commanders on *Nongchao*'s bridge. As if rising from underwater, three masts gradually grew tall from the horizon, followed by the spanker mast, bowsprit, and the tall forecastle and poop of a Spanish galleon. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief—ran all this way, finally caught you!

This guy's size was truly not small. Lin Chuanqing estimated displacement over 1000 tons—only such a large ship could undertake the heavy responsibility of crossing the Pacific to transport Royal funds from New Spain to Manila. Judging from its draft, it was fully loaded.

He noticed the Castilian royal standard flying from the mast. Correct, this was a Royal galleon. The Manila Galleon they had sought so bitterly.

"Raise flags! Prepare for battle!" Lin Chuanqing excitedly issued the order. His command was immediately transmitted to *Daishuang* via walkie-talkie. Both ships simultaneously hoisted the "Prepare for Battle" signal flag.

"Fleet attention, pivot on flagship, turn right in sequence!"

"All fleet attention, turn left simultaneously!"

After completing orders, the two ships deployed into line abreast, closing head-on toward the Spanish galleon.

"Even if this ship originally had 80 durability, now it has at most 60 left, saving us a round of HE shells," Lü Yang muttered to himself. In his telescope, the ship's condition was a bit miserable; rigging was damaged in many places—seemed to have encountered a storm. This also explained why it sailed alone instead of in formation with another galleon. It clearly had also discovered the oncoming fleet and sensed danger. It was attempting to turn left into the wind; obviously, it knew it couldn't escape even downwind, but the turning speed was very slow and labored.

"Looks like its rudder is broken. You can't run; wait to have your 'T' crossed."

Next, the fleet turned right again into column formation proceeding east, continuing to cut toward the galleon's bow. When the distance closed to estimated 2000 meters, Lin Chuanqing ordered: "Distance 2000 meters, load HE, each gun fire one round."

The 130mm guns mounted on the deck terrace fired almost simultaneously, but the shells all fell short, with scatter all over the place. Everyone on the bridge shook their heads.

"This fire control equipment is simply trash; it'll anger Papa Fei to death," Zhou Weisen cursed.

"Not hitting is also good," Lin Chuanqing shook his head. "If by luck we score a direct hit on the magazine, we came for nothing."

Thinking of this, Zhou Weisen broke into a cold sweat. This felt just like hitting a rat in a china shop.

"Close further!" Lin Chuanqing issued the next order. At this time they could only learn from Nelson; fortunately, the Spaniards' range would only be shorter and less accurate.

"1000 meters, load HE! Fleet volley!" This time accuracy was much better; the galleon was instantly shrouded in water columns. Because of its slow turn and long distance, Spanish broadside guns couldn't fire at all, becoming a sitting duck.

"Fire for effect! Load HE, careful not to hit the waterline!" Lin Chuanqing realized some trajectories were low and hurriedly added. The formation continued east, crossing the galleon's bow. Water columns rose frequently near the galleon, but hits weren't clear. Even in telescopes, commanders just muttered "some smoke, one hit?" However, one lucky shot showed obvious effect to everyone: the main topmast suddenly trembled, then fell backward with rigging, smashing onto the deck, then drooping over the starboard side.

"Damn, that's miserable. The ship is paralyzed, but probably ruined." Zhou Weisen couldn't help cursing softly. "Which gunner aimed so true, sniping the mast."

After crossing the bow, the formation turned left, sailing parallel but opposite to the galleon, continuing shelling. Broadsides faced each other; the opponent's gun deck also started taking hits, while its return fire posed no threat at all. After one shot, suddenly a ball of fire erupted from a gun position, turning into thick smoke.

"Bad, looks like Spanish gunpowder caught fire."
