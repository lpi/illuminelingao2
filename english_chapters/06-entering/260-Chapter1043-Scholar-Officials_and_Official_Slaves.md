# Chapter 1043: Scholar-Officials and Official Slaves

An archery competition was underway at the archery field of the Jeju Government Office. The Jeju Magistrate, Lord Yi, had high interest in the competition and personally summoned the main officials on the island to participate.

The ruling class of the Joseon Dynasty had a strong interest in archery; from the King down to the *Yangban* nobles, all took it as a pastime. Archery competitions were frequently held in the palace and government offices, with rewards given to the winners. Under such an atmosphere, even the archery skills of civil officials were quite impressive.

An arrow left the string, flying swiftly against the wind with a whizzing sound. The sharp arrow pierced a spot a finger's width away from the bullseye, quivered for a moment, and then stood still.

The archer was none other than Jeju Magistrate Yi Jin-gyeong. Seeing this scene, his face immediately darkened. Without waiting to hide his disappointed expression, he hurriedly looked at the soldiers and his subordinates arrayed beside the drill ground. They all put on respectful expressions, but they couldn't conceal the surprise on their faces.

Although Yi Jin-gyeong was a civil official, his archery skills were not inferior to the Judge, Yi Dae-ha; the two could be said to be equally matched in archery.

Today was a day with gentle breezes and bright sunshine, and the wind was much lighter, exactly the conditions for archers to display their maximum skill. Unexpectedly, Lord Yi's first arrow missed the bullseye.

The surrounding atmosphere was a bit stagnant, and everyone looked somewhat uneasy. After all, this Observer (Governor) had always prided himself on his archery skills; needless to say, such a scene would put him in a foul mood.

When the superior is in a bad mood, the subordinates' days naturally won't be easy. Everyone's gaze fell on Yi Dae-ha, who was to shoot next.

If this Judge Yi could also miss a bit—whether truly missing or intentionally—it would at least lighten the atmosphere. But this was hard to say.

Yi Dae-ha was the Jeju Judge—the highest military official on the entire island, and practically the second-in-command of Jeju. Many times, specific affairs were handled by this Judge—thus the relationship between the Judge and the Magistrate was quite subtle. Because of its *Yangban* noble relations, the Joseon Dynasty didn't have a strong tradition of valuing civil over military. What's more, the Judge's immediate superior, the Jeolla Province Military Commander Shin Gyeong-yu, was a major supporter who had backed the King to overthrow the previous Gwanghaegun eight years ago. With such a powerful new noble of the current dynasty backing him, Judge Yi might not necessarily be willing to play along.

Yi Dae-ha was in full martial attire, with a calfskin quiver inserted at his waist containing thirteen eagle-feather arrows, and holding a vermilion-lacquered, rattan-bound bow in his hand. As soon as he appeared, he attracted everyone's attention.

He took a deep breath and drew the bow calmly. When the bowstring was fully drawn, he stood motionless, as steady as a mountain. Everyone stared at him unblinkingly.

However, his arrow also missed. Yi Dae-ha shook his head slightly. A wave of unease swept across everyone's hearts. Suddenly, a soldier ran over hurriedly to report: The beacon fire at the beacon tower was lit—there was a large-scale invasion by Wokou (Japanese pirates)!

Everyone was shocked. After the Tokugawa Seclusion, Wokou harassment of Jeju had dropped significantly. Since 1605, when Joseon and the Tokugawa Shogunate re-established diplomatic relations, this area of Jeju had maintained peace for almost thirty years. Although small groups of Wokou landed and harassed every year, there had never been a large-scale invasion.

The message from the beacon tower was extremely simple; it could only be seen that a large group of Wokou had invaded the main island from the direction of Seongsan. As for the specific situation, they had to wait for local soldiers and subordinate officials to report.

"Wokou broke in?"

The Judge was shocked. Although caught off guard, he had response plans: Yi Dae-ha immediately ordered to light the beacons, blow the horns, and summon garrison soldiers from all towns.

Since the Goryeo Dynasty, the Jeju Island region had been constantly invaded by Wokou. Killing, arson, and robbery were commonplace. To resist Wokou invasions, in the 19th year of King Sejong, defense facilities such as three cities, nine garrisons, ten naval battle stations, twenty-five beacon towers, and thirty-eight smoke towers were established. Han Seung-sun, the Pacification Commissioner at the time, established the beacon fire system, forming a complete alert and protection system. Beacon fires were constructed along the coastline, and also deployed on mountain peaks. In case of emergency, they could notify Jeju City and other towns and defense posts in time.

According to the combat plan, once Wokou landed, beacon fires would be lit everywhere, and garrisons and city stations would transmit information to each other by blowing horns and lighting beacon fires. The garrison soldiers would guard the stockades tightly and control the ports to prevent Wokou from using the island's ports for reinforcement. The garrison troops of each city would dispatch their main forces according to the Wokou landing area, coordinating with warship from the naval battle stations to attack the Wokou from both land and water and annihilate them.

The problem was that this seemingly good plan relied on an army maintaining basic combat effectiveness. At the same time, the number of landing Wokou could not be too large. Because the total number of troops on the island was only one thousand five hundred, deducting necessary defense troops everywhere, the number that could be dispatched from Jeju Island at one time was only three or four hundred, which was okay for dealing with dozens or a hundred Wokou, but would be powerless against more.

Of course, they could also rely on "Righteous Armies" formed by island villagers—equivalent to the local militia of the Ming Dynasty. Compared to the regular army, the Righteous Army fighting to protect the country and home had quite impressive combat effectiveness. During the Three Ports Wokou Disturbance, the "Righteous Army" on Jeju Island played a significant role and put up fierce resistance against the Wokou. But in recent decades, Jeju Island had frequently suffered disasters, and the main island lacked sufficient grain, causing a large outflow of population to the peninsula. Jeju Island's population had been in a state of constant decline. Naturally, usable "Righteous Armies" became fewer.

Hearing that Wokou landed near Seongsan, Jeongui Magistrate Choi In-geon's face instantly turned pale—this was his jurisdiction. As an official guarding the land, he was duty-bound to be responsible for resisting the Wokou.

"Please, Your Excellency, dispatch hundreds of elite soldiers; this humble official will return to the county immediately to resist the Wokou!"

Although afraid, the responsibility of guarding the land could not be escaped. Choi In-geon plucked up his courage and said.

Rather than being forced back to the county, it was better to be proactive and bring more troops back for reinforcement. Whether victory could be achieved was unknown, but at least he could ensure his own safety. This kind of Wokou was nothing more than looting; naturally, they would retreat after looting their fill.

"The Wokou situation is unclear. Rashly dispatching troops, I fear it will be difficult to win. The army on this island is only somewhat usable in the Jeju Division. If something goes wrong, the soldiers and civilians on the island will be doomed eternally," Yi Dae-ha said.

Although these words sounded dignified, the inner meaning was that he did not intend to send troops for reinforcement. Lord Yi had his own calculations: the Wokou would retreat sooner or later. Even if the county seat fell temporarily, recovering it after the Wokou retreated was inevitable, but losing soldiers and generals would be the Judge's responsibility.

As the Judge, he knew better than anyone the state of the three Divisions of troops on the island. The only usable ones were a very small number of Special Patrols (*Byeol-cho*) and Tooth Soldiers (*A-byeong* / personal guards), at most one or two hundred men. They might not necessarily be a match for the Wokou.

Just as Choi In-geon was thinking of a reason to refute Yi Dae-ha, Yi Jin-gyeong spoke. As befitting a rank-3 civil official, he indeed had the ability to "remain calm in chaos," his expression quite composed. Coughing once, he stroked his beard and said slowly:

"Even if the Wokou force is large, we must remain calm, calm."

He said "calm" twice. As expected, the officials stopped whispering and turned their eyes to him, looking to see what good strategy the Magistrate had to retreat the enemy.

However, Yi Jin-gyeong had no "clever plan in a silk bag." Apart from instructing Yi Dae-ha to "devise a strategy to retreat the enemy immediately" and ordering Choi In-geon to "return to the county quickly to oversee the defense," there was no new content. Everyone could only boom their assent.

In a tense atmosphere, the two Magistrates, Choi In-geon and Yi Gu, under the protection of retinue and guards, rode fast horses back to their respective county seats. Horns immediately blew in Jeju City, summoning garrisons outside the city, closing city gates, and entering a state of pre-battle readiness.

Yi Dae-ha returned to his office and immediately sent Special Patrols to reconnoiter the enemy situation. Then he hand-wrote a letter to his immediate superior: Jeolla Province Military Commander Shin Gyeong-yu, informing him that a large group of Wokou had landed and that he was deploying to prepare to retreat the enemy, etc.

This letter was not a formal request for help, but a private letter. Whether to declare an emergency and request reinforcements depended on the report after the Special Patrols returned from reconnaissance.

He called a servant and instructed him to immediately select a capable servant to deliver the letter. Then he ordered:

"Please ask Middle Army (*Jung-gun*) Park to come."

The archery competition ended hastily, and the entourages surrounding the officials dispersed in a hubbub. Only a few minor clerks of the Jeju Government Office were left directing dozens of official slaves to clean up the mess.

An awning was set up by the archery field, originally prepared for the banquet after the archery. The tables were already set, displaying cups, saucers, bowls, chopsticks, and four kinds of fruits and four kinds of dried fruits to accompany wine. The official courtesans (*Gisaeng*), prepared for banquet entertainment, were heavily made up and dressed in magnificent clothes, looking bewilderedly at the suddenly empty field, unsure if they should leave immediately or wait for further orders.

Seventeen-year-old official slave Park Deok-hwan glanced at the official courtesans in the awning and swallowed a mouthful of saliva. He began to clean up the objects scattered on the archery field when his back was suddenly punched heavily. Turning around, it was exactly his brother, Park Deok-maeng.

"Big Brother, what are you still working here for? Go get the delicious food quickly!" Park Deok-maeng still had traces of soybean paste at the corner of his mouth. "If you go late, you won't get anything!"

Hearing his brother say this, Park Deok-hwan immediately dropped the miscellaneous items in his hands and followed his brother towards the temporary kitchen. Official slaves ate barley and buckwheat all year round, with only inferior soybean paste and seaweed to go with the rice. They couldn't even eat slightly higher-grade radish kimchi.

In the temporarily built kitchen, official slaves and minor clerks were pushing and shoving for food. This food, carefully cooked by the government office's official slaves, naturally had no one to enjoy it—benefiting the minor clerks and official slaves who usually only had salted vegetables and soybean paste to fill their bellies. their loyalty and patriotism were not as strong as the scholar-officials'; as long as the knife wasn't on their heads, their appetites remained good.

The official slaves couldn't get the best roast meat and fish soup, but ordinary food like fish sauce, fish porridge, and kimchi was quite plentiful. The two Park brothers quickly got two big bowls of fish porridge, poured a lot of soybean paste and crab paste on top messily, and hid aside to eat voraciously.
