# Chapter 1183 - Hamada Shinzō

The islanders were almost all fishermen, each skilled at sailing boats. The Ming people living on the island even exaggerated, saying the islanders' light boats flew like arrows.

The common folk here, like those of the Gotō Islands, were all descendants of the once-rampant Wakō pirates—less than a hundred years ago, their forebears had followed Chinese pirate-merchants' ships every year to raid the Great Ming's coast, always serving as the vanguard in battle.

Besides this, they were also skilled at diving to harvest abalone and sea cucumbers, catching sharks, and making shark fin—all skills learned because of Chinese merchants' needs. Every year, large quantities of dried seafood were shipped from here to the Great Ming, exchanged for "treasures" brought on Chinese ships.

The island's ruling daimyō family, the Matsuura clan, had continued since before the Warring States period and counted among the most ancient lineages among Japan's daimyō.

The domain lord here used Matsushima as his surname. Like the Gotō clan of Fukue Domain, they had adopted the local place name as their family name.

The Matsuura clan was said to have originally been surnamed Minamoto, claiming descent from the Saga Genji. But previously they had also claimed to be Taira or Fujiwara. Such pretensions of attaching oneself to prestigious lineages were common among daimyō.

Legend held that the Matsuura ancestors were valiant, hardy warriors from the eastern provinces, whom the Yamato court had relocated as garrison soldiers to the Tsukushi coast to defend against barbarians—these wild people, covered in pigskin and smeared with lard, were ancestors of the Jurchen. They sailed crude rafts of bound logs, following the currents to plunder and kill along the Japanese archipelago's coast.

During the Heian period, this system became nominal, and the central government forgot their existence. Abandoned in the wilderness, the garrison soldiers formed factions, seizing weapons and land for themselves. By around the Kamakura period, they had formed several warrior bands called "tō" that fought among themselves, establishing many independent "strongholds" and becoming "naval forces" that harassed the coast. The Matsuura family's ancestors gradually grew during this ancient and chaotic era, eventually becoming the overlords of the upper and lower Matsuura regions.

During Toyotomi Hideyoshi's era, the Matsuura also participated in the invasion of Korea. After the Battle of Sekigahara, because they had maintained neutrality, they survived as daimyō with a domain rated at 63,200 koku. This was much larger than Fukue Domain's mere 15,000 koku, showing the importance of foreign trade at Hirado to the Matsuura family.

Hirado Island's terrain was rugged, with almost all roads being slopes. Only a small flat area called Miyamae had been built up with stone walls, raised with rammed earth, and paved with stone slabs—this was called the "Portuguese Wharf Market" trading plaza. There also docked Fujian ships with bamboo-leaf sails, Zhejiang ships with grass-mat sails, and red-haired Southern Barbarian ships with cotton sails.

The Zhou family's ship dropped anchor here. After docking, the Zhou family sailors busied themselves unloading cargo while the Elders were led directly by Ping Kefu to a trading post, presenting Zhou Xingru's calling card.

That evening, a banquet was held at the post to welcome the "Australian maritime merchants" who had come from afar. Receiving them was a young man with a topknot shaved in the chonmage style, his hair gathered from the back to the top of his head—a very neat appearance, clearly no older than thirty. This was supposed to be a trading post, yet the visitor dressed partly like a warrior. Ping Qiusheng thought this wasn't strange—Kyushu had always been the lair of Japanese pirate-merchants. The various so-called naval forces were mostly like this—the Gotō family had also risen this way. Most of these naval forces had only become officially recognized warriors during Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Kyushu campaign—leaving behind the status of "provincial strongmen" and "wild samurai" to become proper samurai at last.

Though the visitor dressed like a warrior, he was very warm in manner, with shrewd eyes and a merchant's air. Hirado had risen thanks to foreign merchants, so for local warriors, foreign merchants were money trees. Great Ming merchant ships were even called "treasure ships" in Hirado.

After host and guests were seated, Ping Kefu introduced the young man as Hamada Shinzō, the "post master" here. His father was none other than the famous Hamada Yahyōe.

Hamada Yahyōe—originally an obscure Japanese—had become a famous figure in East Asian foreign relations history by provoking a conflict with the Dutch East India Company, resulting in the "Hamada Yahyōe Incident."

Though this incident ended with the Dutch side's submission, looking at the entire affair, the greed of the Dutch, the brutishness of the Japanese, the power of Zheng Zhilong, and the law of the jungle on East Asian seas were all fully displayed.

The "Hamada Yahyōe Incident" was ultimately closely related to Zheng Zhilong's monopoly position on the Fujian coast. And Hirado was also where Zheng Zhilong had started—calling it his base in Japan wouldn't be an exaggeration.

If they could strangle his trade here and break his monopoly, replacing it with the Senate's monopoly, the Zheng Zhilong group would be gravely wounded from losing a major source of income—they might even collapse without a fight. This was why the Executive Committee had approved launching Japan trade at this time.

During summer, Great Ming merchant ships didn't sail to Japan—Chinese ships heading to Japan only set out in winter. This gap period was enough for them to do many things. If Zhao Yingong could be a bit more effective, rewriting the history of Sino-Japanese trade wasn't impossible.

By the time Zheng Zhilong's Anhai ships came to Japan again... Elder Ping couldn't help feeling smug.

The banquet was fairly sumptuous, at least better than Ping Qiusheng had expected. He had read a few books and seen that even the "imperial cuisine" offered to the Emperor was quite meager—just some extra dried seafood. This was an island, so at most there would be more seafood—which he was already tired of eating. But what was now served included meat strips roasted with sauce, their aroma filling the air. He tasted a piece—it was like chicken.

"Is this Satsuma chicken?"

"Master Ping is well-informed." Hamada spoke Chinese, though with a strong Nanjing Mandarin accent—the meaning was clear enough.

Ping Qiusheng then praised the chicken's tenderness and flavor. Actually, before coming to Japan, the Agricultural Committee's cadres stationed at Jeju Island had asked him to procure some Satsuma chickens to bring back. Satsuma chickens had rich fat and grew well, and could adapt to Jeju Island's environment. In the short term, they could greatly help solve the island's meat and oil supply issues. In the old timeline, Satsuma chicken was called one of Japan's three great native chickens. Though this timeline's Satsuma chicken hadn't yet been systematically improved, just now after tasting it, the texture was indeed excellent. If combined with Lingao's Heavenly Chef series of seasonings, it would surely taste even better. He made a mental note to have Ping Kefu arrange procurement.

Besides this chicken, there were also grilled fish and various shellfish and squid shiokara. There was rice and mochi as well, and of course the miso soup that Japanese drank year-round, day after day without tiring. 

The glass-bottled rum that Ping Qiusheng brought also amazed the young post master. He drank two bottles before stopping, slightly tipsy. In Tokugawa-era Japan, only wealthy merchants had both the means and freedom from the various etiquette constraints of warrior and noble classes to pay attention to their food. But Japan's material conditions remained limited, and they were quite backward in matters of food and drink. Japanese alcohol in particular—despite sake's great fame in the old timeline, even developing an oenology-like system internationally—at this time Japan's brewing industry was still quite primitive. The market mainly had grain-fermented alcohol; distilled liquor was rare, let alone high-grade spirits like "Peerless Champion."

Finally, servants brought out two dessert courses: one was pickled plum, the other persimmon yōkan. Ping Qiusheng had done some research on traditional Japanese snacks. Never mind whether this pickled plum was Nankō plum—the persimmon yōkan was an authentic Mino specialty not available locally in Kyushu. The Hamada family's lifestyle was quite refined.

Hamada repeatedly apologized, saying his father was busy with affairs at the main post in Nagasaki. Though Master Zhou had notified them earlier that Australian guests would be arriving, the short notice had left them unprepared. From their conversation, he learned that the Hamada family were actually agents for Nagasaki's great merchant Noto Jirō. Their main business was importing raw silk from Quanzhou—the biggest deal in Sino-Japanese trade, and very profitable.

When the topic turned to his father, it inevitably touched on the "Hamada Yahyōe Incident." Hamada Shinzō couldn't help looking pleased—the East India Company's envoy had already arrived in Japan, conceding complete defeat. One of the principals, the Governor of Formosa, would also be turned over to the shogunate for punishment. In return, the shogunate would agree to allow Dutch ships back into Japanese ports.

No matter how you looked at it, the Japanese had won a complete victory. But Hamada Shinzō showed no excessive joy, because the root cause—Zheng Zhilong's monopoly—remained unsolved.

Under Ping Qiusheng's gentle coaxing, Hamada Shinzō drank a few more cups and couldn't help spilling many things.

In recent years, the entire Fujian coast had been controlled by the Zheng family. The Zheng fleet had almost monopolized raw silk trade between the Great Ming and Japan. Japanese wanting to buy raw silk in Quanzhou and ship it back to Japan would absolutely not receive a sailing permit from the Zhengs, and fleets without Zheng family permits could hardly transport goods safely back to Japan. This had practically strangled the throats of Japanese merchants holding vermillion seal certificates.

Either Japanese merchants obediently paid 2,100 taels of silver for a permit, or they risked having their ships intercepted by Zheng Zhilong—losing crew, vessel, and cargo alike.

Hirado in particular, ever since Wang Zhi's era, had been a major gathering place for Chinese pirate-merchants. Both Zheng Zhilong and his former father-in-law Yan Siqi had posts here. Their influence among local Japanese was considerable, with many eyes and ears about.

"I heard his wife and son went to China."

"His father-in-law's Tagawa family is still in Hirado," Hamada Shinzō said, his face flushed from drink. "Many people work for him here. The domain lord also regards him with special favor."

Since Yan Siqi's era, Chinese pirate-merchants had enjoyed privileges in Hirado nearly equivalent to extraterritoriality—treatment almost like that of foreign "Western gentlemen" in the old timeline.
