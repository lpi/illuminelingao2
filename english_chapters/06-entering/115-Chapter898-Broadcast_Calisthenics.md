# Chapter 898 - Broadcast Calisthenics

Columns of each class were led by class monitors, marching toward the playground squad by squad in quick time. All students marched to the rhythm of the march. Steps in sync, formations orderly. Looking full of high morale.

The leading student of one class held high a red triangular pennant—this was the championship flag for the weekly formation drill competition. The winning class could get improved meals once this week.

Each class marched along a definite route. Marching class columns entered the playground from three directions. Before entering the playground, columns merged into wide columns up to 16 rows wide; after entering, they transformed through complex maneuvers back into small columns of 2-person frontage before reaching positions. Not only were multiple columns moving simultaneously on the playground, but they marched in multiple directions, with various columns crossing paths on the playground and roads. It looked intricate and complex, but each formation marched without interfering with others; the timing of column crossing was extremely precise. As the last person of a column on a route passed, another column would cross that route. Dozens of class columns marching simultaneously—if any team was slightly off in speed or rhythm, teams would collide.

This was no longer a general formation performance, but precision drill taken a step higher—for modern armies, precision drill training only served to cultivate military temperament and as military performance. But for armies of the line infantry era, precision drill had extremely important significance for formation changes during combat.

"Marching not bad," the Fubo Army officer who had been watching with hands behind his back said. "Just this formation level, it's on par with the recruit camp I led." He continued to comment, "Several orders of magnitude better than the Black Uncles who came for advanced study observation. Just don't know how they compare to the Old Guards or Lobsterbacks Lin Shenhe and Wendy hang on their lips all day?"

Hu Qingbai was embarrassed to blow his own trumpet, only smiling without speaking.

Wu De shook his head laughing: "Old Fu, don't blow your own trumpet. I stayed in the recruit camp too; can raw recruits at the end of three months training have this level? I think it reaches half the level of the Dalian Surface Vessel Academy."

The Elder called Old Fu shook his head repeatedly: "You're blowing your Navy Superiority Theory again..." He just finished speaking when suddenly his expression changed, muttering to himself, "Damn, how come the students are marching Navy steps? This isn't scientific."

Fubo Army Army and Navy steps were completely different. The Army walked the traditional PLA version, which belonged to the German system in drill schools; the Navy walked British drill from the beginning. Now the posture of National School students on the playground—small steps, high arm swings—was obviously Navy British drill.

"How is it unscientific? I think it's very scientific." Wu De waved his hand. "Look, the students' spirit and energy are quite good."

"Military mettle is there a bit," the Elder officer didn't know what words to use to refute, just showing a face full of unconvinced feeling, feeling a bit like he'd been sandbagged. "...This isn't scientific..."

The National School implemented paramilitary management; every month had a certain time for military training. main content was drill training. Usually, senior corporals or sergeants sent by the Army took turns as training instructors. But since the Summer Awakening Campaign started last year, the long Northern and Southern Qiongzhou security wars exhausted Army human resources. Almost all Army units were drawn away, leaving only one garrison battalion and the 5th Infantry Battalion (Strategic Reserve) in Lingao. The result was the Army could no longer send NCOs responsible for training, so Fangcaodi's military training instructors were all taken over by the Navy.

While they were talking, queues on the playground were all in position. Following commands from the loudspeaker, students in queues quickly trotted to open up distance, forming spacing for broadcast calisthenics.

"Flag raising ceremony begins now! Present flag!"

With the command from the loudspeaker, flag bearers and guards selected from students walked out of the office building main entrance in goose step, walking toward the flag podium. What the flag bearer held was precisely the National Flag recently designated by the Senate.

National flag and national anthem were once quite sensitive issues. So Elders were relatively vague about this initially. With victory in the Counter-Encirclement and control of the whole island, the past practice of hiding capabilities and deliberately blurring their political attributes was no longer appropriate. Continuing to maintain this politically vague state internally would only make subject indigenous people and naturalized citizens at a loss regarding their own positioning. If this continued, public sentiment couldn't stabilize.

Although the Senate still retained Ming local officials and yamens across Qiongzhou Island, this was purely out of consideration for temporarily not wanting a total break with the Great Ming. In actual operation, not only were these bureaucratic organs completely hollowed out, but new regime organs appeared increasingly frequently in social life, and the Ming government's presence became weaker and weaker.

In the past, the Senate didn't formally establish a national flag. The Star and Fist Red Flag served not only as the Fubo Army flag but also as a proxy national flag. But this flag pattern was slightly too complex, not very suitable from a flag design perspective.

After Senate discussion, it was finally decided the national flag would be the "Morning Star Flag," creatively plagiarizing the NATO flag. The pattern is the Polaris shining in a deep blue night sky. The pattern is concise and clear, easy to identify. In meaning, ancients respected Polaris highly, believing it fixed and immovable with stars revolving around it, being a constant star in brightness and position visible in the night sky. Since Polaris is closest to true North, people on Earth have navigated by its starlight for thousands of years, so it has meanings of guidance, leadership, and eternal guardianship. Symbolizing the Elders' status and role. As a national flag, it fit the Senate's idea of establishing a New Empire very well.

As for the national anthem, "Singing the Motherland" was originally used as a proxy. But some Elders thought this song's "imperialist" style wasn't enough, strongly demanding use of old time-space superpower anthems like "Unbreakable Union" or "The Star-Spangled Banner." After some discussion, it was finally decided to select the old imperialist country's "Rule, Britannia," re-lyricized as "Rule, Senate."

"Singing the Motherland" served as the second national anthem for general occasions. Additionally, "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "Unbreakable Union" were also re-lyricized, becoming "The Morning Star Flag Forever Waves" and "Empire as Solid as a Rock" respectively. As patriotic songs, under the shroud of the Senate's bad taste, more and more songs suffered plagiarism. "La Marseillaise" had long become "Bopu Song"; then "The Sacred War," "Soviet March" (Red Alert 3), "Deutschland über alles," "Imperial March" (Star Wars), etc. also fell victim one by one, re-lyricized. Except for "The Sacred War" keeping its original name, they became "Senate March," "Empire Above All," and "Empire March" respectively.

"Our collection of patriotic songs will probably become the longest in history." Ding Ding commented after the meeting. "Of course, the military song collection will definitely become very thick and heavy too."

Fang Fei was even more worried, because these songs all had to be taught and learned; this was no light work. Moreover, most of these songs were foreign language songs; changing lyrics was easy, but making them singable wasn't so easy. Also some lyrics might be very fitting in ten or twenty years, but using them now was inevitably a bit laughable, like "From the Pacific to the Ural Mountains"—the Senate's ruled area was currently only one Hainan Island after all.

"Raise national flag, sing national anthem. Salute!"

Majestic music rang from broadcast speakers. National School students began singing in unison the recently finalized national anthem "Rule, Senate."

*When the Senate, at Heaven's command*
*Arose from the azure main*
*Arose, arose, arose from the azure main*
*This was the charter of the land*
*And guardian angels sang this strain:*

*Rule, Empire!*
*Empire rule the waves, lands and skies*
*Imperial people shall be masters of the World.*

*The Senate more holy than nations, kings and princes of the earth*
*Must surrender*
*Surrender, surrender, surrender*
*Kings and princes of the earth*
*While thou shalt flourish great and free*
*While thou shalt flourish great and free*
*The dread and envy of them all.*

*Rule, Senate!*
*Empire rule the waves and earth*
*Imperial people shall be masters of the World.*

Thousands of students stood solemnly singing simultaneously; the singing voice rushed straight into the clouds. The Morning Star Flag rose slowly up the flagpole with the singing. Elders on the third floor also stood solemnly motionless, paying respect and saluting the flag.

The flag rose. The high-pitched speaker began playing the MP3 of "Third Set of Broadcast Calisthenics." Hu Qingbai then introduced the Fubo Army officer to Yuan Ziguang:

"This is Major Fu Sansi, currently Head of General Staff Training Department, soon to be Inspector General of Training, hahaha..."

"Don't say it before formal appointment."

Fu Sansi said, saluting, then shaking hands with Yuan Ziguang. He was a robust middle-aged man. Like He Ming, he came from a PLA infantry company commander background, but was junior to He Ming in seniority and hadn't fought wars. He joined the transmigration cause much later than others. So he had been an ordinary Elder officer until promoted to infantry battalion commander a few months before the Chengmai Campaign.

After the Northern Qiongzhou security war basically ended, Fu Sansi proposed to the Army Ministry not to serve as infantry battalion commander anymore—he had sustained injuries during combat readiness training while serving in the PLA. Serving as an infantry officer was physically too demanding, so he applied to serve exclusively as a military training instructor.

The Executive Committee's military system design originally considered establishing the post of Inspector General of Military Training, but lacking suitable candidates at the time, the post remained vacant. Now that Fu Sansi volunteered to be a dedicated military instructor, he was a suitable candidate in both qualifications and actual skills. He Ming then transferred him first to be Head of General Staff Training Department.
