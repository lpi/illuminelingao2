# Chapter 834: Hongji Station

During this period, Beikai established a complete set of rules and regulations. Miners recruited locally from Beiqi received work points based on the amount of coal dug; cart workers received work points based on the number of carts. During injury or illness, they were also given enough grain allowance to not starve to death. After work every day, the workers went to the Delong agency point of the Cooperative to exchange their work points for circulation vouchers. Workers used circulation vouchers to buy grain, alcohol, clothing, and other goods sold by the Cooperative. Besides alcohol, cigarettes and candy were the most popular goods. The tools used by miners also had to be purchased, but for now they were given on credit. Based on the price of the tools, Beikai deducted 10% of each miner's daily wage to offset the cost of the tools until the debt was paid off.

If it were a more vicious and greedy capitalist, using "loans to buy tools" could completely play simple economic tricks to make miners heavily indebted, never able to pay off the price of their tools—after all, tools wear out. But the Senators had always believed that exploitation must be moderate. In the long run, moderate exploitation helped with long-term extraction of workers' surplus value rather than treating workers as disposable items. Under the Lingao system, labor was precious.

In terms of compensation, Beikai, according to instructions, offered slightly better rates—at least the commoners should feel that working for the coal mine was slightly better than farming. For Hongji Station to recruit enough local workers as miners, reputation was important.

Li Mei's design for the commercial area of the mine was that workers could get all consumption without leaving the mine—in most places in this time-space, commerce was a blank slate. Now there was a community of over 600 people with certain spending power. Not doing some commerce would be a real pity. Commerce was first and foremost to build momentum for circulation vouchers and prepare the groundwork for the next step of promoting circulation vouchers.

The circulation vouchers issued to the workers were quickly spent in Hongji town. Circulation vouchers were issued at the beginning of the month; by the end of the month, most were collected back. Heavy physical labor made workers need a lot of food; working outdoors and in the mine caused a lot of wear on clothes. However, the Cooperative purchased worn-out clothes at a discount: repurchased by the catty. The worn clothes were cleaned and disinfected and then sent back to Lingao for papermaking.

The consumption of single men without families was even greater. They would go to the small restaurants every few days to eat something better and have a drink. Some learned to smoke—because some of the naturalized citizen laborers among the upper echelons of workers smoked, the local Beiqi laborers also regarded this habit as "fashionable" and started smoking.

At the beginning of the second month, dozens of local Beiqi workers left. Although Beikai was somewhat disappointed, he still instructed the Cooperative: exchange the circulation vouchers held by the departing workers for rice or copper coins and give them to the workers. What he didn't expect was that after the workers returned home, they quickly brought their families and fellow villagers back to work at the mine. When Beikai was inspecting the mine pit one time and discovered that many local women wearing conical hats were also carrying coal in the pit, it really shocked him. Although in Lingao he had seen how women among the naturalized citizens worked in quarries breaking stones, in fields, and even on construction sites—women from Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian were famously able to do heavy work—it was the first time he had seen women going down into the mine pit to carry coal.

"This is too wasteful," Beikai's gaze fell on the women carrying coal. Because carrying coal wore out clothes a lot, the miners were almost all raggedly dressed—and the women were no exception. Although they looked dark-faced and short, the skin exposed through the tattered clothes still gave Beikai some fantasies. Especially a few women who had petite and curvy figures.

With his authority here—his power was the same as Tang Menglong's at Jiazi Coal Mine—he had the power of life and death over everyone at Hongji Station. If he really had lustful thoughts and played with a few local women, it wouldn't be a big deal. But Beikai still controlled his impulse to act recklessly. However, letting women dig and carry coal was too wasteful of resources!

Beikai sent a telegram to the Department of Colonization and Trade, asking them to send agricultural technicians and rice seeds. Although the soil quality here was poor, the Baitang River was close at hand, making it very convenient to divert water and plant rice.

"Just put to use all the stuff the miners pull out. Our slogan is: No Waste!" Beikai said to Dugu Qiuhun, the Tiandianhui Inspector from the Agricultural Department who came to inspect.

Dugu Qiuhun tugged at the East German People's Army spring-autumn uniform on his body and hmm'd a few times. Although he had been in the agricultural department for a long time, he was still not very interested in agricultural matters. After spending a few months in the agricultural department, Dugu Qiuhun was officially appointed as an "Inspector" by the Organization Department. Wu Nanhai and Ye Yuming both knew that Qiuhun wasn't cut out for agriculture, so it was better to let him go around and check on basic farmland construction. Now most agricultural technicians were of naturalized citizen origin. Having a Senator frequently visit to supervise and encourage would make them work harder.

This time, when sending rice seeds and agricultural technicians, Dugu Qiuhun came along with the ship to Hongji—there were quite a few legends among the Senators about Vietnamese girls, and Dugu Qiuhun was also very curious about this.

But the Vietnamese girls in front of him, selected and prepared to do agricultural work and plant rice, greatly disappointed him—the quality of these girls was really quite ordinary. To be honest, they weren't even as good as the better-looking naturalized citizens. Moreover, their skin was dark and their bodies thin and small. It really didn't arouse any interest.

"The difference is just too big." Dugu Qiuhun secretly regretted his request to come to Hongji on this business trip. The Vietnamese girls in the plan obviously didn't look like this.

"It's okay. Local Beiqi farmers are constantly arriving. There are bound to be a few good ones. I'll save them for you..." Beikai said.

Dugu Qiuhun sighed: "Forget it. If the Senate knew about this, they'd all pounce on us and bite... Besides, there's the hygiene issue—I heard the antibiotic stockpile is almost gone."

Besides "escorting" rice seeds, farm tools, and agricultural technicians, Dugu Qiuhun had another task: to write a fishery report—although the Agricultural Department hadn't been able to fully reclaim fishing rights, the Navy refused to hand over fishing rights on the grounds that fisheries were a supplement to maritime power. After negotiations between the two sides, an agreement was finally reached: the Navy continued to control the fishing fleets originally under the Navy, implementing fishery supervision and collecting "fishing 5-1 tax" on their behalf. The Agricultural Department was responsible for organizing indigenous fishermen into fishery cooperatives.

After determining the scope of authority for both sides, Wu Nanhai and Li Di of the Navy held a joint fishery work meeting to have an in-depth discussion on how to implement the Navy-Agricultural Department Fishery Management Agreement. Both sides agreed that the potential for collecting seafood tax was great, but unfortunately, the production scale of indigenous fishermen here was too small.

According to Navy figures, the fishery tax collected by Maritime Forces for all of 1630 was 4,500 dan, totaling 500 tons. The total catch of fishermen paying taxes and fishing in the waters near Lingao for the whole year did not exceed 2,500 tons—most of which was sold to the Lingao regime. In the old time-space during the peak period of Lingao's traditional fisheries from 1934 to 1936, Lingao's total annual catch was as much as 20,000 tons. Obviously, even without modern fishing boats and equipment, using traditional fishing methods, the production potential in the Lingao area was still great.

Extending this to the entire Qiongzhou Strait, the waters around Hainan Island, and even the Gulf of Tonkin, the fishery potential that could be tapped was astonishingly large. Compared to the aquaculture industry that required a strong agricultural foundation, ocean fishing was the only source that could quickly, cheaply, and abundantly provide protein and fat. The population under Lingao control was constantly increasing, and the demand for protein and fat supplies was getting larger and larger.

To expand production, one was to expand the production scale—in short, increase fishing boats and fishing gear; two was to fish in deeper waters—the Gulf of Tonkin area not far from Lingao was a natural large fishing ground. In 1956, Lingao fishing boats went in groups to fish in the Gulf of Tonkin, with a fishing season catch totaling as much as 32,000 tons; three was to adopt new fishing gear and catching techniques, improve nets, and increase catching depth by a few meters. The increase in production would be considerable.

In these numbers, Wu De, the Director of the Planning Institute who came from a fisherman family, saw an opportunity. He proposed: carry out "fishery cooperative" activities for indigenous fishermen.

Integrating indigenous fishermen from the Lingao-controlled area under one banner, promoting new fishing boats and gear, implementing multi-boat cooperative fishing, and then deep-sea fishing operations—these were benefits for people's livelihood. The indirect benefit was that the Navy could integrate and control the originally scattered fishing boats at sea, essentially gaining a maritime reserve force. Fishing boats could not only serve as reconnaissance, transport, and patrol vessels but could also serve as warships when necessary.

Wu De believed that fishermen originally had a tradition of pooling funds to buy boats and fish. Compared to farmers, they had a stronger business sense. He himself came from a fishing village and understood the fishermen's way of thinking quite well. Having the Transmigrator Group lead fishery cooperatives and conduct joint-stock operations was possible. It might even be smoother than the Tiandihui's agricultural promotion.

The matter of setting up fishery cooperatives became another project of the Tiandihui. But this project did not progress as smoothly as imagined. Fishermen in this time-space were an independent and closed group, with a completely different way of life and code of conduct. Forcing them to pay taxes for fishing was easy—the rules were clear at a glance. Persuading them to join an organization and do joint-stock cooperation was not easy. Therefore, the entire fishery cooperative was progressing with difficulty. Initially, only fishermen near Bopu and Maniao were integrated. In 1630, the second counter-encirclement battle occurred, and the fishery cooperative work was temporarily stalled. It wasn't until after this fishery work meeting that it resumed.

Riding the momentum of the great victory in the second counter-encirclement, plus the demonstrative effect of the Navy's direct fishing fleet's modern fishing gear, the work of promoting fishery cooperatives went much more smoothly. By the end of 1630, the fishery cooperative under the Tiandihui's management had already controlled more than 80% of the fishermen in Lingao. They pooled funds to purchase several new and larger fishing boats.
