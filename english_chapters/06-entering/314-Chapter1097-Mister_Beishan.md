# Chapter 1097 - Mister Beishan

Despite this, Wang Daochun remained a hidden danger. Therefore, Senator Lü had another mission: to remove anyone who might be detrimental to Sun Yuanhua and the Northward Detachment.

In fierce urban defensive battles, it was perfectly normal for high-ranking officials visiting the front lines to be killed in action. In the Defense of Laizhou, Xu Congzhi was killed by cannon fire. Among the Special Reconnaissance Team members in the Laizhou Detachment, there were snipers charged with this secret mission, ready to carry out necessary "targeted eliminations" as the situation dictated.

The red debris of firecrackers was scattered all over the ground, and trampled by people and horses, it quickly became part of the black mud on the roadside. Although the harvest had been poor in recent years, with natural disasters, military chaos, banditry, and the Eastern Barbarians' invasions... bad news came from all sides, but it was still the New Year atmosphere. Beijing was the capital and the finest place, so the market was still very lively. These days were the Lantern Festival, and the streets were bustling with crowds, prosperous with scholars and ladies like clouds. It was just that the refugees and beggars filling the ground painted a gloomy color on this Lantern Festival scene.

Leng Ningyun sat in a sedan chair, returning to the business house outside Qianmen. These days, he had been busy visiting guests, both business partners and running around for his mission—his financial expansion plan had come to a temporary halt.

Ensuring Sun Yuanhua's survival was no longer very difficult—Sun Yuanhua had escaped in time, clearing himself of the suspicion of rebelling with the thieves. But judging from the current state, retaining his official position still posed considerable difficulty.

After Sun Yuanhua became Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou, according to the conventions of the late Ming official circles, whenever an official reached a certain level or became a high-ranking regional official, his reputation would plummet. From the Supervising Secretaries and Censors of various sections to other motley members of the *Qingliu* (Clean Stream), there would always be constant impeachment memorials revealing this person to be a pardonless villain; any small matter would be infinitely magnified to the extreme. Freedom of speech reached an unprecedented height; from the Grand Secretaries of the Grand Secretariat to the dispatched regional high officials, not one was spared from being scolded bloody by the speech officials. The Chongzhen reign saw fifty-one Grand Secretaries; while this certainly had to do with his own personality flaws, the constant noise from the outside also seriously affected his judgment.

To remain unwavering in one's view of someone amidst a cacophony of scolding, perhaps only Yang Sichang could achieve that. Hong Chengchou could also be counted as one, but his final hasty dispatch of troops to aid Jinzhou cannot be said to be without the element of fearing the "public opinion" of the court and *Qingliu* influencing the Emperor.

In the end, it could be said that in the Chongzhen reign, almost all ministers who had some ability and dared to take responsibility were destroyed in this bizarre atmosphere of "freedom of speech."

When Leng Ningyun was undergoing training at the "Farm," it was repeatedly emphasized to pay attention to the "public opinion" of the speech officials—it could not only sway the Emperor's judgment but also form a powerful atmosphere of partisan attacks in the court, making dissenters dare not open their mouths.

The most terrifying thing was that this public opinion was often "politically correct," occupying the moral high ground, so even the Emperor found it hard to refute. The public opinion of the *Qingliu* even controlled the court administration to a certain extent, causing the ultimate tragedy of the Great Ming.

In the end, the Chongzhen Emperor would rather sit and wait for death in Beijing than move the capital to Nanjing—he didn't even dare to secretly send the Crown Prince away, losing the last chance for a backup. It has to be said that this was caused by the "politically correct" public opinion of the *Qingliu*.

"They open their mouths all for the country and the people, full of awe-inspiring righteousness, but in reality, they turn out to be male thieves and female whores!" Leng Ningyun was someone who knew the subsequent historical trend and knew that many of these civil officials with surprisingly "correct" values in the late Ming failed to maintain their integrity in their later years. Quite a few even became slaves of three surnames. Looking at their current faces, he felt they were extremely contemptible.

Leng Ningyun had just visited an important figure—this figure's status was not high, and could even be called very low: a domestic slave. But in the capital, he was a resounding figure. Many officials in the court had to respectfully address him as "Mister Beishan" when they saw him.

However, this domestic slave was no ordinary person. Even Eunuch Yang, whom Leng Ningyun always felt was very impressive, was polite when seeing him, even overly courteous.

This person was none other than the domestic slave of Zhang Yixian, the current Director of the Directorate of Ceremonial in the palace.

Starting from the fourth year of Chongzhen, the practice of dispatching inner palace eunuchs to the army as supervisors, which had been abolished, was restored, and the power of palace eunuchs began to rise again. And among them, Zhang Yixian, who controlled the Directorate of Ceremonial, was the most favored. Because he was proficient in calculation and had economic talent, the Emperor ordered him to audit the income and expenditure of the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Works, and even specially established an official office called "Superintendent of Revenue and Works" for him. His authority was like that of a Governor-General among external officials. People in the capital said this was simply like Tu Wenfu when the Nine Thousand Years (Wei Zhongxian) was in power. For this reason, it had aroused great controversy in the court since the end of last year. Especially the officials of the original Ministries of Revenue and Works, they were all ashamed to be subordinates of a eunuch, so they submitted memorials one after another, arguing strongly that this should not be done.

However, Leng Ningyun knew that the civil officials could not change the Emperor's wish on this matter, so he unhesitatingly accepted Wu Kaidi's suggestion to go through Eunuch Yang to access Zhang Yixian.

Zhang Yixian was a favorite in the palace and now served as the Superintendent of Revenue and Works; not only was his status high, but his affairs were also very busy. Let alone Leng Ningyun, a merchant, even a eunuch like Eunuch Yang who was on the edge of the core of court power could not easily see him.

Fortunately, power is meant for rent-seeking; it has been so since ancient times. Since the principal had no time or energy, naturally there was a group of confidants to handle these matters on his behalf. "Mister Beishan" was a domestic slave under Zhang Yixian specifically for handling such matters.

It wasn't that Leng Ningyun hadn't considered going directly to Xu Guangqi, Zhou Yanru, and others, but his own status was awkward. Moreover, among the Grand Secretaries, Zhou Yanru and Xu Guangqi were both strong supporters of Sun Yuanhua. Xu Guangqi's son and Sun Yuanhua were related by marriage, and Zhou Yanru was the person who personally supported Sun Yuanhua to become governor, and had received a large amount of sable furs, gold, and pearls gifted by Sun Yuanhua. Sun Yuanhua himself had long sent people to seek connections and find ways through them. Instead of spending too much effort himself, it was better to exert force secretly to help out.

In comparison, it was much more convenient for him to go through the eunuch channel. After hearing his request, although Eunuch Yang looked surprised, he did not refuse. After seeing the precious gifts presented, he pondered for a moment and sent a young eunuch to take him to see Young Eunuch Yang.

Young Eunuch Yang then took him to this "Mister Beishan's" residence. This Mister Beishan's residence was quite imposing in scale—not inferior to Eunuch Yang's residence at all. The gatehouse was full of all kinds of people waiting to be seen, including many officials. Leng Ningyun sat on a cold bench for almost two hours before getting an audience. Judging from the envious looks of others, being able to see the person in two hours was definitely thanks to the two Eunuch Yangs.

Leng Ningyun continued his main work in Beijing: kowtowing and giving money. After presenting a batch of rare "Australian treasures," "Mister Beishan" listened to his request, then very politely served tea to see him off.

Although he had seen the person and spent the money, Leng Ningyun had no idea whether it would be effective. Although the gifted "Australian treasures" were not rare in Lingao, in the Great Ming, these treasures were worth almost three thousand taels of silver. This was a huge sum in the Great Ming! When Zhou Yanru was reinstated and re-entered the Grand Secretariat, his activity funds in the court were only ten thousand taels of silver.

Using "treasures" worth three thousand taels of silver to help Sun Yuanhua keep his official hat was truly not a small investment. If it couldn't be done, although he was acting under orders, he would ultimately leave an impression of "ineffective handling of affairs."

"What do you think of this matter?" Although Leng Ningyun was bent on reducing his reliance on Wu Kaidi, he couldn't help but ask him as he stood serving inside the sedan chair.

Wu Kaidi was silent for a moment and said, "It's about fifty-fifty."

"That low?" Leng Ningyun always felt that things with less than eighty percent certainty were basically impossible to accomplish.

"Master wants to protect Sun Huodong," Wu Kaidi whispered. "Just entrusting inner minister Zhang is not enough; the court also needs to be taken care of."

"I know that. I'm asking, will inner minister Zhang help with this favor?"

"Master, rest assured. Since Mister Beishan accepted your card and the gift list, it shows that inner minister Zhang has no taboo about this matter—otherwise, you probably wouldn't even have seen Mister Beishan."

"So, inner minister Zhang has agreed?"

"Whether he agrees or not, he also has to look at the next turn of the situation," Wu Kaidi whispered.

This meant nothing was settled yet, Leng Ningyun thought. But he also knew that going through Zhang Yixian's channel could only achieve this much. Next was to find other ways.

Leng Ningyun's sedan chair returned to the Beijing Branch of Delong Bank outside Qianmen. This place was originally a pawnshop, and after being converted into a bank, it largely maintained its original layout. Only the screen wall with the large character "Pawn" written on it in front of the door had been removed, and a gold-lettered plaque hung above the main entrance, reading "Delong Bank." Below was a three-bay frontage, with only the central bay open as the main gate. Inside, stone counters and iron bars could be seen. If one walked closer, the indistinct sound of abacuses and talking could be heard. Glass skylights were installed on the roof, so the entire bank was brightly lit, but there were bars everywhere: even the ceiling was made of iron bars. The security work was very much in place.

Seven or eight clerks were busy behind the counter. This was the storefront of Delong's Beijing Branch. The business at the storefront was very simple: deposits and withdrawals, remittances between branches, and small loans. The business volume wasn't large, but the profit was relatively stable, enough to cover all the bank's expenses. Next to the storefront counter, there was a small courtyard specifically for receiving wealthier and higher-status guests.

Usually, when returning from outside, Leng Ningyun would first go around the storefront to see if there were any problems. But today he had no mind for this and ordered the sedan bearers to carry the sedan directly in through the side door by the bank's main gate, all the way to the moon gate of the inner residence. He took his confidants and immediately entered the inner study courtyard dedicated to handling confidential matters.
