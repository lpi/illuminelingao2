# Chapter 872 - Printing Workshop

"I noticed your establishment's fine decor and came in specifically to have a look." Zhou Dongtian spoke in his oddly-accented Guangdong Mandarin. Fortunately, Mandarin in this time-space wasn't too different from Nanjing dialect, and as long as the shopkeeper spoke slowly, Zhou Dongtian could understand.

The environment here was indeed pleasant. This Pan Jianyuan Bookshop had a small courtyard between the storefront and the back courtyard door. Pebble-paved paths wound past several clumps of bamboo, with various potted flowers placed on the ground. In the spring sunlight, it was a riot of colors.

On bare sections of wall hung swords with blue-green patina. Below was a small purple sandalwood table with a qin brick, on which rested an ancient *guqin*. In a Wanli-era imitation Xuande censer, wisps of blue smoke rose, and a rich, fragrant aroma wafted faintly through the air.

"You flatter me, Master," the shopkeeper said with a smile. "By your appearance, surely you must hold an examination degree?"

Of course he didn't have one—Zhou Dongtian wasn't an external intelligence agent and didn't need to specifically obtain credentials. But ancient times had no nationwide networked degree verification system, and Guangdong was a thousand *li* away. Fabricating a false identity and education wasn't difficult. Zhou Dongtian didn't dare boast that he was a *juren* [provincial graduate]—the number of *juren* in each province was still limited, and Nanjing being an auxiliary capital, people from all provinces were present. Bragging carelessly might get him exposed, and then it wouldn't just be losing face.

So he claimed to be a *xiucai* [county graduate]—there were many more *xiucai* than *juren*, and there was considerable variety among them too.

"Oh, oh! From Master's radiant expression, you'll surely pass the provincial examination with flying colors. Congratulations in advance!"

"Thank you. 'Don't discuss essays in the examination hall'—it all depends on luck."

"Since Master Zhou has come to Jinling [Nanjing] for study, might you be selecting some new examination essays?" the shopkeeper ventured. "This humble one has several personally-annotated compilations of examination essays by Master Qishan. They're all splendid writings, like clusters of flowers..."

Master Qishan was Zhang Zilie. Few in the old time-space knew of him. But Zhou Dongtian did: when working at the printing office, he had printed some books using modern printing equipment, including the *Kangxi Dictionary*. And one of the *Kangxi Dictionary*'s precursors, the *Zhengzi Tong* [Correct Character Compendium], was this Master Qishan's work.

Zhou Dongtian knew that Zhang Zilie was currently a National University student in Nanjing and had never passed the *jinshi* [metropolitan examination]. From the shopkeeper's tone, it seemed this Master Qishan was highly accomplished in eight-legged essay writing, to the point that the examination essay compilations he edited had become a major selling point.

He waved his hand: "No need. Do you have any novel and interesting good books here?"

"How could we not?" The shopkeeper, looking at Zhou Dongtian and Mei Lin, figured they were wealthy young merchants from Guangdong with examination degrees—probably having already greased the right palms in the examination system. Such people looked for novelty first. He thought for a moment, then took a new book from the shelf. "I wonder if Master Zhou has seen this book? It's a Western work."

Zhou Dongtian looked—it was Xu Guangqi's translation of *Elements of Geometry*. This book should have been published in 1607. The fact that it was still available for purchase in Nanjing indicated its sales probably weren't good—ancient Chinese mathematics was very advanced in algebra, but relatively backward in geometry. A book full of entirely new concepts and terminology would probably interest only a very small number of people. Few would bother with it.

"This book is truly extraordinary. It was compiled by Minister of Rites Xu of Shanghai. I'm told it's a Western original, personally translated by Minister Xu. But few can understand it."

Zhou Dongtian opened it and looked. The printing was very fine, and some chapters even had illustrations. Seeing references to "right angle," "obtuse angle," "similar triangles"... Zhou Dongtian felt transported back to middle school. So these terms already existed back then!

He didn't know that these geometric terms, including the word "geometry" itself, were all coined by Xu Guangqi's translation.

Seeing his interest, the shopkeeper hurriedly fetched several other books, piling them one by one on the desk. Zhou Dongtian looked them over. Most were Xu Guangqi's works or translations of missionaries' works: *A Treatise on Sweet Potatoes*, *Miscellaneous Notes on Agriculture*, *Draft Agricultural Manual*, *Western Hydraulic Methods*, *Illustrations of the Celestial and Terrestrial Spheres*, and quite a few others. The variety was quite diverse, including agricultural books—such as several of Xu Guangqi's works; mathematical books: *Guide to Calculation in the Common Script* and *Methods of Measurement*; astronomical and hydraulic works; and finally even Matteo Ricci's *On Friendship*, a collection of aphorisms.

Zhou Dongtian flipped through them one by one. He actually wasn't interested in the content—these books wouldn't be more advanced than those in the Grand Library. What he was looking at was the binding and printing.

A characteristic of ancient books was very large characters. The font size in these books, by modern standards, was at least equivalent to size-one type. Zhou Dongtian had always pondered this—why did ancient printed books use such large characters? Some said it was a printing technology issue; others said it was because ancient lighting was poor, requiring larger characters for readability.

Zhou Dongtian had no time to examine the content carefully, so he instructed Cai Yibang to buy everything and bring it all back. When paying, he discovered that book prices were quite expensive. Given the price levels of the time, ordinary people could hardly afford them. Even buying a complete set of the Four Books and Five Classics wasn't easy for the poor. No wonder scholars in this time-space enjoyed all sorts of privileges—the money and time required to obtain examination credentials ensured that knowledge would be monopolized.

The bookshop owner had made a nice sale and was beaming with joy. Zhou Dongtian seized the opportunity to propose seeing the woodblock printing workshop.

"The workshop is all black ink. I'm afraid it might stain the two young masters' clothes..." The shopkeeper was somewhat surprised by this request. Many scholars came to buy books from him, with all kinds of personalities, but never had anyone shown interest in the printing workshop.

"No matter. These two gentlemen are book lovers and very curious about how books are printed. Please be so kind as to accommodate them." Cai Yibang also spoke in support.

The shopkeeper considered for a moment. There was nothing in the workshop that couldn't be shown. Besides, woodblock book printing had no "secret techniques" worth protecting. Just find a few carving, printing, and binding craftsmen and you'd learn everything. These two masters were curious and wanted to see—no big deal.

"Very well, this humble one shall lead the way." The shopkeeper stood up, gave some instructions to his clerk, and promptly led them toward the back courtyard.

The group passed through the back courtyard door, walked down a corridor, and faced a wind-fire wall worn by years of weather, with an impressive gate tower with upturned eaves. This was the printing workshop. The buildings were mainly of gray brick, white walls, and black tiles.

Pushing open the door, they entered a large courtyard paved with flagstones. The layout formed a character-shaped plan, symmetrical about the central axis, with the main hall as the center. Upper, middle, and lower halls connected together, with one to three rows of wing rooms on each side of the halls—serving as workers' dormitories and workrooms. In the courtyard was a pond for collecting rainwater, and drying platforms set up on rows of racks.

Zhou Dongtian noticed that the halls here had very high ceilings, and between courtyards were very tall wind-fire walls. Printing books required storing large quantities of wood, paper, and books—all highly flammable materials. The water reservoir in the courtyard and the wind-fire walls separating the courtyards served fire prevention purposes.

People were busy in the halls and wing rooms, and workers periodically crossed the courtyard carrying materials. In one room, people were transcribing manuscript copies based on selected source texts. Selecting a good source text was the first step in carving a good book. Source texts, besides commissioned manuscripts from authors, were selected from past good editions—ancient times had no concept of copyright, and whether works by contemporary or ancient authors, as long as the bookshop owner found them suitable, they could be carved and printed.

Because good source texts were crucial, bookshop owners were often themselves textual scholars with discerning eyes, skilled at unearthing useful source texts from old bookshops and piles of old paper. Some bookshop owners befriended famous book collectors to obtain their privately held rare editions and unusual books. In Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, there were also so-called "book-carving experts" who combined the roles of literati and book collectors. They were mostly learned scholars who were also wealthy and influential gentry—such as Hu Yinglong, the Nanjing book collector who had carved and published the *Compendium of Materia Medica*.

The Pan Jianyuan Bookshop had about a dozen transcribers. Contrary to Zhou Dongtian's expectations, they were all true "copyists"—though literate and able to write beautiful regular script (and even mirror-reverse characters), they had little education. Their work was entirely mechanical. Therefore, in ordinary books, wrong characters, missing characters, variant characters, and even garbled text were common. So bookshop owners also had to hire—though "invite" was the usual term—several literati to serve as editors and proofreaders. Less particular bookshops would skip this expense.

In the main hall, carving workers were bent over their work. Stacks of blank printing blocks, cut to size, were piled under the corridor eaves awaiting use. Carved blocks were stacked on the other side. Various printing blocks were piled up like mountains under the eaves. The shopkeeper explained that better carving materials were mostly pear wood or jujube wood. These fruit tree woods were hard with fine grain and not expensive—ideal materials for carving printing blocks. The idiom "bringing calamity to pear and jujube" came precisely from this.

The carving workers pasted the "writing samples" prepared by the transcribers onto the blocks. Then, using various types of carving knives, they carved the mirror-reversed ink characters into raised relief while gouging out the remaining blank areas to create indentations. The characters had to protrude one to two millimeters above the block surface.

The finished blocks were taken to the courtyard, where casual laborers carried buckets of hot water to wash the carved blocks, removing wood shavings and ink marks. The carving process was then complete.

One page was one block. A book of three hundred pages required three hundred blocks. The labor and material costs were incalculable. Therefore, manuscripts with uncertain market prospects would rarely get published unless the author privately funded the carving. The scarcity and expense of books were not surprising.
