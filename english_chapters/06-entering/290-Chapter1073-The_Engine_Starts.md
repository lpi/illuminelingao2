# Chapter 1073 - The Engine Starts

This was the second question he needed to clarify: what exactly was the Australians' objective?

Pies don't fall from the sky. The Australians showed such great enthusiasm for the Dengzhou-Laizhou rebellion; obviously, they had their own purposes.

Asking others for help was, in the end, an exchange of interests. If he couldn't produce interests to exchange momentarily right now, it depended on how much interest he could exchange in the future.

What were the Australians attempting? Sun Yuanhua was very puzzled.

Puzzled or not, both sides had reached a tacit understanding on this matter. That evening, Lu Yang and Lu Wenyuan hosted a banquet for Sun Yuanhua in the inner hall.

The wine and food were very simple, and everyone's mind wasn't on eating and drinking. Seeing the wine had gone around three times, Lu Wenyuan sent everyone around them out, and the two sides immediately had an earnest talk about "deep cooperation."

Sun Yuanhua put forward the request of "Borrowing Troops to Help Suppress," specifically requesting them to dispatch a navy to blockade Dengzhou to prevent the Dengzhou side from colluding with Dongjiang.

As for his plan, it was also very simple. He intended to head straight for Laizhou early the next morning, gather the remnants locally, and simultaneously ask Yu Dacheng for reinforcements, holding fast to Laizhou and Qingzhou with the support of reinforcements.

Historically, it was precisely the steadfast defense of Laizhou by the succeeding Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou, Xie Lian, and the Governor of Shandong, Xu Congzhi, that confined the rebel army's scope of activity to the Dengzhou-Laizhou area, thereby giving the Imperial Court the opportunity to mobilize reinforcements for suppression.

Lu Wenyuan also agreed with this point very much. If Sun Yuanhua didn't enter Laizhou, he couldn't submit memorials, nor could he explain his whereabouts clearly. In terms of occupying the initiative, the sooner he arrived in Laizhou, the better.

"It's just that I only have three followers by my side now. I have to ask Master Lu to send people to escort me part of the way."

"Easy to say, easy to say." Lu Wenyuan nodded. "I will send a fast boat to take Sir to Laizhou tomorrow. As for Sir," he thought for a moment, "having only three followers is probably not enough, not even a person to help manage documents..."

Sun Yuanhua thought about it and agreed: all his aides and servants were trapped in the city; he didn't even have a person to handle paperwork.

Although Laizhou was within his jurisdiction, his Governor position and the local Magistrate and Prefect were not in a direct subordinate relationship. After he lost Dengzhou, how these officials would treat him was still an unknown. Without bringing his own team, he feared no one would even pour him a cup of water when the time came.

Lu Wenyuan immediately said he had prepared a team of followers, including a private advisor (*Shigong*), servants, family retainers, and maids, everything needed, to accompany him to Laizhou.

"They are all Catholics, and mostly local people from Shandong." To weaken Sun Yuanhua's wariness, he said specifically.

This group of people were indeed mostly local Shandong commoners. After all, Sun Yuanhua going to Laizhou was entering a dangerous place, so there was no need to send too many naturalized citizens. For people like family retainers and servants, recruiting some from the local refugees would suffice. Only a few were naturalized citizens. Among them, the one helping with documents was a naturalized citizen from Zhejiang. This person was originally a *Xiucai* (scholar who passed the imperial examination at the county level). Because he failed in "studying to become an advisor," he was instead thrown out by his master to take the blame, stripped of his *Xiucai* title, and exiled to Leizhou.

This person was thrown into prison in Leizhou because he had no money to bribe his way out, and was almost tortured to death. At that time, in order to specifically recruit naturalized citizens with "great bitterness and deep hatred," the Leizhou Station specifically searched the prisons at both the prefecture and county levels in Leizhou and rescued this dying unlucky fellow. This time he was specially sent to Shandong and arranged to be by Sun Yuanhua's side.

As for blockading Dengzhou, Lu Wenyuan agreed readily—firstly, this was not a problem; secondly, whether to blockade or not depended on the need—they wouldn't blockade Dengzhou before fattening up Kong Youde. Historically, tens of thousands of Dongjiang soldiers and civilians fled to join Kong's subordinates in Dengzhou; Chen Youshi's unit alone brought seven or eight thousand people.

As for the return, Lu Wenyuan laid out the Senate's conditions:

1.  Sun Yuanhua tacitly allows them to act at their discretion in the Dengzhou-Laizhou area: including buying land under false registry, hiring workers, and taking in refugees, allowing them to freely transport populations out of Shandong. And provide all convenience.
2.  Australian ships can freely enter and exit all ports in the Dengzhou-Laizhou area.
3.  Permit Australians to freely organize and train village braves in the Dengzhou-Laizhou-Qingzhou area, and grant them nominal status.
4.  Sun Yuanhua may not arbitrarily transfer troops subordinate to the Australians; he can only communicate with Lu Wenyuan through the liaison officer by his side.
5.  Sun Yuanhua is to subsidize some grain and pay for the village braves organized by the Australians.

Regarding the last item, Lu Wenyuan very magnanimously expressed that considering his current situation, no specific figure would be stipulated, as long as supplies were given as appropriate.

At the same time, Lu Wenyuan also stated: All Australian village braves and naval forces would not fly the Australian flag, but use the name of local village braves.

Sun Yuanhua considered again and again and thought these five conditions were not excessive. He agreed to all of them on the spot.

The two sides reached an agreement, and immediately drank and chatted happily. Lu Wenyuan reminded:

"Before Sir goes to Laizhou, please write a letter each to Grand Secretary Xu and Grand Secretary Zhou—the student will arrange a ship to go to Tianjin Wei immediately."

"Yes, yes, I am confused!" Sun Yuanhua said repeatedly. He secretly blamed himself for being excited for a moment and forgetting this major event.

Xu Guangqi was his mentor and relative by marriage, and Zhou Yanru was the person he fed full with money, his biggest backer in the Court. He had to inform them of the situation as soon as possible so that they could speak for him in the Imperial Court.

The matter of his capture, of course, could not be mentioned, nor could the private discussion with the Australians. But his next whereabouts and plans could be explained in detail.

Sun Yuanhua deliberated for a while, wrote letters respectively to Xu Guangqi, Zhou Yanru, Minister of War Xiong Mingyu, and ten other officials in the Court with whom he had connections and could cite as backers, sealed them, and handed them to Lu Wenyuan.

"I will arrange for special personnel to deliver the letters to their residences immediately," Lu Wenyuan said. "If there are reply letters, they will also be brought back together."

"I'm afraid the reply won't be that fast..."

"It doesn't matter. Sir just needs to add a sentence on the envelope: ask them to hand the reply to the Qipwei Escort Agency in the Capital for delivery. It will surely be delivered within three to five days."

"Good." Sun Yuanhua nodded repeatedly. The Australians indeed handled things meticulously!

Lu Wenyuan instructed people to pack Sun Yuanhua's luggage and prepare a fast ship to send him to Laizhou early the next morning. He also called over the advisor assigned to him, pointed at him and said:

"Hereafter, if the Lord has any matters, you can instruct this gentleman to relay them. If the student has any news to inform, it will also be reported to the Lord through him."

Knowing that Sun Yuanhua couldn't fully trust this advisor, it was better to simply give him the identity of a "liaison," so that Sun wouldn't dare to look down on him.

At this time, Cheng Lingsu came over holding a package and presented it. Sun Yuanhua looked at it suspiciously.

"Please open it for a look, My Lord." Lu Wenyuan said with a grin.

Opening it, it turned out to be his Seal of the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou. Sun Yuanhua couldn't help but be greatly shocked. His Governor's seal was lost after the fall, probably taken by the rebels. He didn't expect to see it here again—where did they get it?

However, looking closely again, this seal was not the original one. Although the entire seal was made vividly, even the serial number from the Ministry of Works casting was exactly the same—even the gaps near the number and the wear on the strokes were there, he could still sense that this was a fake seal.

"This..."

He looked at Lu Wenyuan—although losing the Great Seal brought many inconveniences and was one of the "crimes," rashly using a fake seal would be counterproductive once exposed.

Lu Wenyuan instructed someone to bring Xuan paper and stamped the Great Seal on it. Seeing the cinnabar red stamp on the snow-white Xuan paper, Sun Yuanhua was shocked once again—no matter how brilliant a carver was, they couldn't make the weight of strokes and wear of a fake seal exactly the same. However, the handwriting printed by this seal was almost exactly the same as his original one.

Considering that it was unlikely to find his Governor's seal at the same time Sun Yuanhua was rescued, intelligence personnel inside Dengzhou City had begun collecting Sun Yuanhua's various notices and documents months ago and sending them to Qimu Island. The seals on the documents were scanned with high precision, saved as digital files, sent to Lingao by fast ship, processed by computer in Zhou Dongtian's printing factory, and then carved using a combined processing center. As for the Great Seal itself, the form was found from historical materials. As for the various details on the seal, Huang Ande had managed to photograph them with a digital camera once. Therefore, after being made, all details were complete. Finally, it was aged based on the photos.

Lu Wenyuan just smiled slightly; he believed Sun Yuanhua would not raise objections to this. Now that he was out of trouble and had the Seal of the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou in hand, it was like adding wings to a tiger.

Sun Yuanhua finally just cupped his hands to express thanks—with the seal in hand, everything would be much more convenient.

On the fifth day of the first lunar month, escorted by Qimu Island village braves, Sun Yuanhua arrived in Laizhou by ship. The Prefect of Laizhou was originally in a panic; there were many rumors outside, some saying Sun Yuanhua was dead, others saying Sun Yuanhua was taken prisoner. He sent people to report the emergency to Yu Dacheng, but unexpectedly, after receiving the news of Dengzhou's fall, Yu Dacheng was helpless and hid in the Governor's yamen chanting scriptures. Servants and officials secretly called him "White Lotus Censor." The people sent by the Prefect of Laizhou received no instructions, let alone reinforcements.

Just as he was helpless, Sun Yuanhua suddenly arrived. The Prefect of Laizhou was both surprised and happy. Happy that he finally had a pillar of support, surprised that he didn't know where this Sun Yuanhua had popped out from—fortunately, he had seen Sun Yuanhua many times, and Sun Yuanhua had dozens of followers with him, so he immediately opened the city to let Sun Yuanhua enter Laizhou, and immediately ordered people to arrange for the cleaning of the Prefecture School to serve as Sun Yuanhua's temporary Governor's headquarters.

As soon as Sun Yuanhua settled down, he immediately wrote a letter to Yu Dacheng and sent Sun Yuan to deliver it immediately. He knew very well that once this rebellion started, he and Yu Dacheng shared a "common fate." They had to maintain a coordinated stance on how to respond.

Yu Dacheng had at most indirect responsibility for Kong Youde's rebellion. As long as he responded well, there was a high possibility he would get a disciplinary punishment but remain in office. With him in Shandong, Sun Yuanhua would have more room to maneuver in his future responses.

Subsequently, he immediately began writing a memorial to the throne.
