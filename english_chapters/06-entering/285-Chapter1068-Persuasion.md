# Chapter 1068 - Persuasion

Lu Yang didn't return to the pier; instead, he stayed in the central hall with high spirits, drinking tea and chatting with Lu Wenyuan. Lu Wenyuan was only a few years older than Lu Yang, and their conversation was very congenial. Gradually, the topic shifted to content that men love to hear and see. Chen Sigen couldn't help but ask: "You came here just for combat readiness duty?"

Lu Yang replied: "Because I love reading and have a broad range of knowledge, and look like an elegant, handsome, and refined youth, the Engine Command felt I was more suitable to assist you in receiving Sun Yuanhua. Moreover, my *Daishuang* is a Type 901 gunboat after all, equipped with a 130mm gun. Its firepower is stronger than the *Fubo*, and it can perform shore bombardment missions when necessary. There are also Lin Shenhe's new gadgets on the ship... Besides, I'm a foodie, and my orderly specializes in cooking. I brought a lot of good stuff on the ship, which will be good for calming Lord Sun's nerves."

The amount of information in these words was a bit large, and Chen Sigen and Lu Wenyuan couldn't digest it for a while.

Chen Sigen quickly asked: "New gadgets? Is it the Type 92 Infantry Gun?"

Lin Shenhe's new gadget couldn't be anything else—Chen Sigen had learned from Senators who participated in the joint amphibious landing exercise before the Engine Operation that during this exercise, the Marines had experimentally used a brand new artillery piece for accompanying attacks—not the M1857 or the 12-pounder mountain howitzer, which were smoothbore guns.

Lu Yang replied, "How could it be that fast? It's still a carriage-recoil gun. But it's a breech-loading rifled gun, and the loading speed is much faster than the previous Naval 70mm gun."

"Probably the 'Miss 75' that Lin Shenhe brags about all day long." Lu Wenyuan wasn't very interested in artillery, but the development of new artillery and weapons was a monthly topic on the internal BBS. Lin Shenhe would occasionally mysteriously reveal some so-called insider information, sometimes posting a few blurry digital photos, then suddenly deleting them, accompanied by phrases like: "Black tea doesn't taste good."

Sun Yuanhua was half-asleep and half-awake in bed. Feeling thirsty, he habitually called for a servant to pour tea. However, the person who pushed the door open and entered was a strange maid, which startled him: He remembered that his two young servants had been serving him these past few days.

He quickly sat up, only to find that he was not in the main room of the Circuit Supervisor's Yamen where he had fallen asleep yesterday, but in a strange room.

The room was not very tall or grand, even somewhat humble and small. But the furnishings inside were clean and very simple. Apart from the bed beneath him, there was only a table and two chairs. On the stark white wall hung a crucifix of the Suffering Jesus. The window seemed to be open; he could see the withered branches in the courtyard, and the bright sunlight was already streaming in, yet there was not a bit of cold wind in the room.

Sun Yuanhua realized: The window was fitted with glass!

Installing glass on windows was extremely luxurious—that kind of transparent, colorless flat glass was shipped all the way from Guangdong, and the price was so high that even a high official like him dared not easily inquire about it.

In the entire city of Dengzhou, he dared to say not a single household had such windows, let alone the cross on this wall.

Where is this? He couldn't help but wonder secretly.

There was no stove lit in the room, yet it was warm as spring. The bedding was light, soft, and warm. The mattress beneath him was firm yet yielding, very comfortable.

At this moment, the maid asked, "Does the master have any other instructions?" while serving half a cup of weak tea and a small spittoon for rinsing the mouth.

Seeing her complete etiquette and skillful service, Sun Yuanhua felt slightly relieved: No matter where this was, since the other party was so meticulous, they would not have malicious intent for the time being.

He rinsed his mouth first, and only then did the maid replace it with fresh tea—it was also weak tea, but it was excellent tea. Sun Yuanhua was from Jiading and was very particular about tea tasting. As soon as the tea entered his mouth, he knew it was new autumn tea from Zhejiang.

Although he was a Governor in Dengzhou, he was on the front lines after all, dealing with a group of martial men all day long. Such refined enjoyment was rare.

After drinking the tea and steadying his nerves, he asked, "Where am I?"

The maid smiled: "Sir, please be patient. My master said: Sir has suffered a shock a few days ago, please rest a while longer. If Sir does not wish to sleep anymore, this servant will fetch a washcloth to serve Sir in washing..."

"Who is your master?" Sun Yuanhua was even more puzzled—listening to the maid's tone, she was obviously not part of the rebel party. But he was clearly captured by Kong Youde and Li Jiucheng a few days ago and detained in the Circuit Supervisor's Yamen.

Before falling asleep last night, he was still hesitating about whether to commit suicide to show loyalty.

But thinking of what the priests said: Suicide violates the "Ten Commandments" and leads to eternal damnation in hell, he hesitated.

He fell asleep in such a state of mind. Since his capture, Sun Yuanhua hadn't had a peaceful sleep—chaos and dreams turned upside down as soon as he closed his eyes. But last night he slept particularly soundly, a night without dreams.

Could it be that God heard his prayers and guided him to a new path? Amidst his surprise, Sun Yuanhua felt a hint of expectation in his heart.

He immediately instructed: "Serve me to wash and change clothes first."

The maid went out for a moment and brought a box containing toiletries. She removed Sun Yuanhua's head wrap and hair net, undid his bun, combed it, and then tied it again. Then she brought a basin of warm water and green salt and willow twigs for rinsing his mouth, serving him to wash. Using a towel that was thick and soft to wipe the water droplets from his face, a refreshing feeling instantly penetrated his heart and spleen.

The maid went out again and brought him several sets of clean underwear and a new cotton robe, saying to him:

"Please change clothes, Sir. This is a rural place, there are only some coarse clothes, but they are all newly made and extremely clean."

After Sun Yuanhua was captured, although Kong Youde treated him very well, recruiting his lost old servants to serve him and retrieving his personal manuscripts and luggage as much as possible, he was a prisoner after all. The so-called good treatment was merely not mistreating him and ensuring he had food and clothing. How could there be such meticulous service and enjoyment?

"What is your name?"

"This servant is named Cheng Lingsu."

"Good name."

The maid smiled: "Given by the master of the house. Whether it is good or not, this servant does not understand." She added, "The master said, if Sir has finished washing, please have breakfast first, then meet in the flower hall."

"Good." Sun Yuanhua also felt hungry.

The maid soon brought a tray with white porridge and salted vegetables, all in the Jiangnan style, which aroused his nostalgia for his hometown.

After breakfast, guided by the maid, he walked out of the bedroom. Before him was a very small but meticulously cleaned and arranged courtyard. Following the maid through the alley by the courtyard, turning a few corners, and entering a large hall, he saw a young man standing in the hall, looking at him with a smile.

He recognized this person; it was exactly Lu Wenyuan. The fellow believer who came from Zhejiang to Shandong to reclaim wasteland—the Jesuit priests had asked him to look after him.

Lu Wenyuan stepped forward and bowed deeply: "Sir has been startled!"

"I dare not! I dare not!" Sun Yuanhua quickly returned the bow, his heart filled with mixed flavors and a myriad of feelings for a moment. After Kong Youde rebelled, this Master Lu had specially sent a messenger to remind him to pay attention to the movements of the Liaodong people in the city, to guard against the intensification of conflicts between locals and immigrants, and specifically mentioned that Geng Zhongming might not be reliable due to his feud with Huang Long, urging him to be wary.

Later events almost completely verified Lu Wenyuan's warnings. He hadn't expected that this young outsider could have such incisive views on the situation in Dengzhou.

"Ashamed, ashamed." Sun Yuanhua said as he sat down as guest and host with Lu Wenyuan. The maid served tea.

"Where is this place?" This was the issue Sun Yuanhua was most concerned about at the moment.

"This is Qimu Island in Huang County—the student's stockade—Sir is safe now."

Sun Yuanhua remained silent. He knew of Qimu Island. Initially, when this Master Lu wanted to buy land to reclaim wasteland in Shandong, the land on Qimu Island was bought under his facilitation. Since he was on Qimu Island, he was obviously rescued by the Master Lu before him—this was of course a great thing, but to be taken away unknowingly overnight from the heavily guarded Dengzhou City, amidst thousands of troops, was akin to the strange tales of sword-heroes like "Red Wire Stealing the Box," which couldn't help but arouse his suspicion.

Could it be that they reached some deal with Kong Youde and Li Jiucheng to exchange him out? Sun Yuanhua felt: This possibility was the greatest—although he still didn't know what the other party's purpose was up to now.

However, Lu Wenyuan was after all a fellow believer introduced by Father Gilbert de Pantoja/Guo Jujing, whom he respected extremely, so at least he didn't need to doubt this person's motives.

Seeming to guess Sun Yuanhua's thoughts, Lu Wenyuan smiled and said: "We also rescued Sir's two young servants together; they will continue to serve Sir tomorrow."

Having these two personal confidants who witnessed the rescue process present would be more convincing than him speaking empty words like this.

"Many thanks, Sir." Sun Yuanhua cupped his hands. "I just don't know what Sir's intention is in taking such a huge risk to rescue Sun from a desperate situation?"

Lu Wenyuan thought: *Here it comes. This is expected.* He had long fully exchanged views with the Grand Library and done a lot of homework on how to conduct the "Sun Yuanhua work." At this moment, he had a well-thought-out plan.

"First, it is for the people of Shandong. The people of the three eastern prefectures were originally suffering from hunger and cold, and now they are suffering from the disaster of war. As believers in the Lord of Heaven, how can we sit by and watch so many lambs die in original sin?"

"Yes." This was the righteousness of the Church. Even if Sun Yuanhua didn't quite believe it, he couldn't refute it.

"Second, it is for Sir." Lu Wenyuan spoke with assurance. "Sir fell into the hands of thieves. Life and death hung on a single thought of owls like Kong Youde and Li Jiucheng. If not for the great grace Sir showed them in the past, I fear Sir would have already lost his life at their hands!"

When Lu Wenyuan said this, a look of dejection appeared on Sun Yuanhua's face—he had strongly advocated employing Liaodong people and generals in Dengzhou and tried his best to treat the original Dongjiang troops well. He hadn't expected that he and the entire Dengzhou would ultimately be destroyed by these very people.

Dengzhou had fallen, and the firearms, weapons, horses, grain, fodder, and military pay accumulated in the city for many years were all lost. The army he had personally organized and hired Portuguese people to train had also vanished in ashes and smoke. Years of painstaking effort were destroyed in a day.
