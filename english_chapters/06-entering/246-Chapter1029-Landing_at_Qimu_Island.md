# Chapter 1029 Landing at Qimu Island

To achieve such goals, appropriate "guidance" was needed. The Senate had no silver-tongued middlemen who could manipulate Kong Youde, Li Jiucheng, and others' actions with eloquent speech. The only approach was armed intervention.

Block or accelerate rebel movement at certain nodes. Guide the rebels to operate according to Command's requirements. Besides deploying special operations forces, this was also the Northern Expedition Detachment's main mission.

In the overall operational deployment, Command made a decision to ensure Sun Yuanhua wouldn't "fall into rebel hands." As long as Sun Yuanhua wasn't captured by the rebels, not only would his culpability greatly decrease, but in the next phase of suppression operations, he would be in a more proactive and advantageous position. Authority over suppression would likely fall to him. Plus with Xu Guangqi at court, the Restoration Society they were actively cultivating, and Eunuch Yang's power in the palace, there would be internal and external coordination. With active maneuvering, he might well be "cleared of charges" or even "earn merit"—thereby keeping Sun Yuanhua's position as Dengzhou-Laizhou Governor.

Keeping Sun Yuanhua as Dengzhou-Laizhou Governor would greatly facilitate the Senate's next steps in Shandong. The eastern three prefectures in particular were geographically self-contained within Shandong, with many excellent coastal ports—having potential for armed separatism. According to normal history, it wouldn't be long before the Manchus' second invasion entered Shandong, devastating the region. Ming court rule in Shandong would be severely damaged. At that time, using the eastern three prefectures as a base, they could extensively infiltrate the entire Shandong region.

Taking a step back, even if Sun Yuanhua's governorship couldn't be saved, Sun Yuanhua still had room for reinstatement. Using this to cultivate Sun Yuanhua and Xu Guangqi's more progressive and pragmatic bureaucratic faction at court would also positively impact the next phase of political and economic infiltration of the Great Ming. Moreover, such "cultivation" was more solid than relationships obtained purely through silver bribes.

A main mission of the special operations team was ensuring Sun Yuanhua wouldn't "fall into rebel hands." If necessary, the special operations team would mount a rescue.

Command couldn't make accurate estimates of how much Sun Yuanhua could be used and controlled, but this person championed Western learning and valued practical affairs. He was a relatively flexible pragmatic official. Plus, with the Jesuits as their banner, cooperation should be achievable to some degree.

Through Huang Ande and Sun's household retainer Sun Yuan, along with other former comrades-in-arms, Lu Wenyuan could roughly track Sun Yuanhua's general activities in the Dengzhou-Laizhou region—he had placed an operative in Dengzhou, with a group of couriers bringing that day's confirmed intelligence daily.

Wang Qisuo wore a thick cotton jacket, standing guard at the newly completed gun emplacement near the jetty—Master Lu didn't call it a "gun emplacement" but a "blockhouse." The name was quite apt, because it was a three-story brick and stone building where garrisoned soldiers could live inside. Atop was mounted a strange cannon: square-shaped, with densely packed iron tubes inside, mounted on a circular disc-shaped frame.

He stood beside this delicate cannon—polished and oiled daily, wrapped in a gun cover—gazing out to sea. The sea wind howled. It was really unbearable. But Wang Qisuo didn't dare slack off: this was a task personally assigned by militia leader Huang Ande: "Watch the sea constantly. Report immediately if any ships belching black or white smoke!" He had repeatedly reminded Wang Qisuo several times.

Wang Qisuo was puzzled. Ships belching white smoke was understandable—maybe someone cooking on deck. But black smoke meant the ship was on fire, right?

Puzzled or not, he still executed the task meticulously. Since being saved by Master Lu, he had somewhat understood these people's work rules: No unnecessary talk, absolute obedience to superiors' orders, do things by the rules.

"These Shorn-Haired Criminals really have their tricks." Wang Qisuo said to himself. Although he didn't know why he was watching the sea, he still kept alert, scanning the cold, desolate ocean.

Neither on the open sea nor in the bay were many ships visible. Only some small fishing boats were active in nearby waters, including several boats belonging to the island's fisher-tenants. These boats brought fresh fish and shrimp daily for the militia to feast on.

In the bay, under refugee labor, Qimu Island's jetties had grown from one to three. The longest was nearly half a *li*—no one knew what use so many long jetties served. Besides Master Lu's tenants' fishing boats, only cargo ships carrying coal, grain, and timber docked here.

Suddenly, several columns of black smoke rose on the distant sea—very striking against the clear winter sky. He hurried forward several steps, almost leaning out past the blockhouse top's battlements.

No mistake—definitely black smoke! Four columns total. As time passed, the smoke trails grew thicker, rising straight to the sky.

Wang Qisuo's spirits rose: "They're here!" He hurriedly struck the bell hung by his sentry post.

The Second Fleet's main force had arrived: flagship *Zhenyang*, plus *Nongchao*, *Daishuang*, and *Fubo* forming the escort convoy, accompanying eight H800 transport ships carrying the Northern Expedition Detachment's main force.

The Second Fleet's main force had deployed almost completely. This was considering that Longkou was very close to the Ming forces' Penglai Naval Base—large-scale maritime transport would certainly attract Ming attention and needed sufficient protection. Second, after escorting the main force's landing, the Second Fleet would proceed to cruise Jeju Island waters, conducting preventive strikes against Great Ming and Joseon naval forces active there, seizing sea control, and clearing obstacles for the next phase's Jeju Island landing.

Wang Qisuo stared wide-eyed, watching the fleet approach Qimu Island with rolling waves—so many large ships! Momentarily he involuntarily held his breath. The Shorn-Haired Criminals' fleet was truly formidable, living up to its reputation!

Not long after reporting the fleet's arrival, Wang Qisuo saw a group of people in blue clothing surge from the buildings on shore, boarding several small boats moored by the shore and rowing quickly toward the bay's outer areas. These were the naval pilot personnel who had arrived earlier, immediately deploying navigation buoys outside the bay.

Second Fleet's ships were too many and too large. Even three jetties couldn't meet docking needs. So all small boats on the island were deployed for ferrying personnel and cargo. The bay was bustling with crisscrossing boats.

Wang Qisuo watched dumbstruck as soldiers he had never seen before poured endlessly from those dozen-plus large ships. They wore uniform dark gray long coats—hems reaching to above the knees—with white belts at the waist, thick furry hats with ear flaps to protect the cheeks, and gleaming star insignia on the hat fronts. They wore cross-body bags and canteens on their chests, short swords at their waists, tight boots on their feet, and large backpacks with thin wool blankets strapped atop. Each carried a long musket on their back.

"So this is the Shorn-Haired Criminals' army!" Wang Qisuo thought—somewhat different from rumors. But he had to admit that although the criminals' soldiers dressed strangely, their clothing and equipment were clean and sharp. Each had extraordinary bearing—clearly an elite tiger-and-wolf force at a glance.

Under corporals' commands, soldiers landed by squad. The moment they stepped onto the jetty, corporals' orders rang out continuously:

"Fall in!"

"Count off!"

"Check equipment!"

"Forward march!"

"*Senate-Approved Military Songbook*, Number Seventeen! *The Great Army Fears No Long March*! Sing!"

As deep male chorus voices rose, squad after squad began moving from the jetty—endlessly disembarking from ships, making onlookers feel the troops were inexhaustible.

At the temporary barracks on the dock, the Fourth Infantry Battalion's banner flew. Northern Expedition Detachment Commander Zhu Mingxia stood under the flag, extending his hand to the quickly approaching Lu Wenyuan.

"Finally you've arrived." Lu Wenyuan almost had tears of joy—no more worrying now! "Now we can relax!"

"You have Old Chen holding down the fort. What's there to fear? I don't even have a machine gun." Zhu Mingxia joked.

Chen Sigen chuckled: "Little Lu trusts your Minié rifles more than machine guns."

Lu Wenyuan couldn't be bothered to counter. He waved: "Come, let's talk inside the command post."

The command post was the farmstead's conference room, already heated with floor heating—warm and cozy. Zhu Mingxia immediately took off his officer's short coat upon entering.

"It's really warm here." He looked around, stretching. "Much more comfortable on land. Too tiring on ships."

He took off his hat and sat down heavily. This time the Northern Expedition Detachment had been delayed a full half month in Taiwan. Although soldiers hadn't been idle, Zhu Mingxia had been very anxious—worried that too much delay would reduce the troops' time to adapt to local conditions. This battalion was visiting the cold north for the first time. Although many northern soldiers had been transferred in, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi-origin soldiers still made up over two-thirds of the Northern Expedition Detachment.

"Where's the troop camp set up?" he asked. This was his most pressing concern right now.

Lu Wenyuan had already made arrangements. He opened the Qimu Island topographical map on the table and indicated a location.

"Barracks are in a mountain valley between the east and west hills—wind-sheltered, sun-facing, with water sources nearby. I've had laborers build drainage ditches and public latrines there, plus a batch of semi-underground dugouts and wooden barracks. But the quantity might be insufficient..."

"That's fine. Soldiers can build more themselves." Zhu Mingxia said. "How's the food supply?"

"One week's rations for 5,000 people."

Zhu Mingxia said: "That's plenty. Including the advance company, landing forces total only about 1,000."

The Northern Expedition Detachment main force landing at Qimu Island included 6 infantry companies, 1 engineer company, 1 artillery company, and 2 supply companies. The remaining troops would deploy to Jeju Island.
