# Chapter 831: The Department of Colonization and Trade

Accompanying the report, Plate No. 19 is Mr. Leibtrini's drawing of the entire port battery and stone pier. This is the best angle we could see from the ship. Plates No. 20-67 are Mr. Leibtrini's drawings of various aspects of the port and the ships anchored within, of which Plate No. 25 is the Australian "Holy Ship." The pamphlet provided by Your Excellency states that there is a great cannon on the foredeck of this ship, but we cannot confirm this from our vantage point. Plates No. 26-28 are European-style ships owned by the Australians. Plates No. 29-33 are other ships owned by the Australians.

I will send the second report after the Australians restore our freedom of movement.

Your Masters' faithful servant,
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

Junior Merchant Van der Lanthroon
February 9, 1631, aboard the *Magdeburg* in Bopu Port, Lingao

After putting down the quill, Van der Lanthroon spread the letter out and took a cardboard from his briefcase. The cardboard had many irregular holes punched through it. He placed the cardboard over the letter, compared it, and began copying onto another sheet of paper.

Gonzalez watched the young Merchant work so diligently and couldn't help but secretly laugh—they weren't even allowed off the ship now; who was he going to send back to Batavia to deliver the letter? There was neither a Company trading post nor any other ships from Batavia here. The Australians never went to Batavia either.

Leibtrini was holding a cup, drinking—anchored here with nothing to do while waiting to go ashore, the sailors and soldiers all took drinking as a pastime to pass time. The purser had bought over a dozen barrels of rum and fifty cases of Kvass. Everyone on the ship, except the sentries who were explicitly forbidden to drink, was drunk all the time. On the deck, in the hold, beside the cannons, everywhere lay "scum" who had gotten drunk and were snoring away. A tragic incident had occurred the night before: a sailor got drunk and slept on the deck, and in the middle of the night rolled overboard into the water. By the time the duty sailor noticed and fished him out, he was already dead. For this, the Merchant had to pay eight Reals for "body disposal fees," and the Port Authority disposed of the body by throwing it into the open sea.

Because there was nothing to do, Leibtrini spent his time either drinking or drawing. On the deck, using projection methods and simple instruments, he roughly sketched the topography of the port. Then he sketched everything that could be seen from the deck of the *Magdeburg*. He was especially meticulous in depicting the "Holy Ship." This huge ship was on the other side of the bay. The dark silhouette of the ship radiated a captivating beauty against the azure sea and sky, whether in lines or light and color. Leibtrini was a cartographer; in an era when technology and art had not yet completely separated in Europe, he was also half an artist, with an innate sensitivity to beautiful things.

Every day, blue-green smoke puffed intermittently from the Holy Ship, and sometimes a burst of black smoke would suddenly erupt. Leibtrini kept trying to figure out what was happening on the ship and what the Australians were doing—his interest in the "Holy Ship" grew day by day.

Now watching the Merchant wrap his sketchbook and letter together, carefully wrapping layer after layer of oilcloth, sealing with wax, and finally putting them into a deerskin bag, he felt somewhat at a loss. Although these drawings were just sketches, was it safe to send them with the letter just like this? The voyage from here to Batavia was several dozen days; any accident could cause the letter to be lost at the bottom of the sea forever.

"How do you plan to send the letter out?" Gonzalez finally couldn't help but ask.

"I just saw a junk nearby that unloaded Formosan deerskins—these Chinese merchants obviously came from Tayouan. I'm planning to entrust them to take it." The Merchant was confident. "Give them some money. They'll do it very properly."

Although sending the letter to Tayouan and then back to Batavia would take a long time, according to the time ships stayed in port back then, the *Magdeburg* would not start its return voyage for at least one or two months. That was enough time for the letter to arrive in Batavia.

Even if the letter arrived in Batavia later than they did, it would still have value—at least it served as a backup. In this era, not every ship that set sail was guaranteed to reach port.

In the building of the Department of Colonization and Trade, Skaed sat in his office, complacent and ambitious. At the third plenary session of the Senate after the annual meeting, a by-election was held to fill the vacant Executive Committee positions. Because Skaed had been in charge of the daily work of the Department of Colonization and Trade for a long time, and often advocated statements like "The Pacific is China's Pacific," he was successfully elected as the Minister of Colonization and Trade, an Executive Committee position, in the by-election.

The first thing Skaed did after being elected was to move—in his view, the original Department of Colonization and Trade was too small to satisfy his ambition and the constantly expanding workload. Fortunately, since the Senators' "Residential Building" began construction, there was quite a bit of vacant land in Bairencheng. So he re-appropriated a piece of land and built the Department of Colonization and Trade building.

The so-called building was actually repurposed from former prefab dormitories. Now that most Senators had moved into apartments, there were many surplus prefab components. The colored steel sandwich panels with foam layers didn't have great insulation efficiency. So it was decided to use them only as walls, with a wooden frame wall added inside the exterior walls, filled with diatomaceous earth, a natural insulation material.

Because the prefab sandwich panels could be installed quickly, his construction plan was not rejected by the Planning Institute. The construction company finished the building in a week.

From the outside, the new Department of Colonization and Trade building looked very strange. It was a peculiar structure composed of two three-story buildings with an arched roof between them. The ground floor of the small buildings was brick, while the upper two floors had colored steel panel construction. An arched wooden roof supported by wrought iron trusses was added between the rooftops of the two buildings. Glass skylights were installed. The front and rear of the arched roof were sealed with brick walls, creating a building with offices on both sides and a high-ceilinged atrium in the middle. The entire building was full of a makeshift air.

Skaed really liked the full-height arched hall of the Lingao General Construction Company—combined with the sand table model on the planning exhibition platform below, it was so magnificent! So he wanted to do the same. This way, standing on the balcony of the Minister's office on the third floor, he could look down at the sand table and the busy staff around him, fully satisfying his desire to overlook the world.

Beneath this arched roof were various sand tables. Skaed believed that the work of the Department of Colonization and Trade was much like a staff department, only an economic staff department. And the basic skill of staff work was to operate on maps and sand tables.

Therefore, the hall was filled with various sand tables. The largest one was a sand table of the entire East Asian maritime region. All merchant ships owned by the Transmigrators or contracted with them, and all public commercial outlets, were placed in this large sand table in the form of small flags and models.

On the walls hung huge maps and charts. One of the charts was an operational diagram of trade cargo flows; various commercial data were filled in cards of different colors and hung on the operational diagram on the wall, making the wall look like a colorful chessboard. Once a day, the Department of Colonization and Trade, the Naval Shipping Division, the Port Authority, the Directorate of Manufacturing, and all overseas stations with radio would exchange intelligence. Female clerks holding long forked poles changed the positions of the cards according to the information received. Below the operational diagram, a group of people called "calculators" sat in small office cubicles, constantly calculating the data handed to them with slide rules and dip pens.

They were selected from naturalized citizens who had obtained Type-C diplomas and were taught a certain mathematical calculation method by rote. Each person was only responsible for memorizing one type of calculation formula. What they did was fill the data into the formula and then figure out the result by hand calculation and slide rule. The purpose and principle of the calculation were completely unimportant; as long as they could correctly calculate the result, they were qualified calculators. Because of repetitive mechanical practice, their calculation speed was very fast.

Every few months, they would learn another formula to ensure they could replace each other.

Through meticulous management methods, it was possible to know at any time which ships had left port, which were anchored loading and unloading cargo, which ships were currently empty, what cargo each ship was carrying, and the types and quantities of this month's import and export demands. The Senate and all departments could always get a forecast of when a certain type of material in a certain direction would arrive—barring accidents.

The Department of Colonization and Trade had no ships of its own—this was something Skaed had always resented. When the Dabo Steamship Company was being formed, he strongly demanded that the company be under his department's control, but it ultimately fell into the hands of the Transportation Department and the Navy. This made him bear a grudge—a Department of Colonization and Trade without ships was truly a huge joke!

Of course, he had no ability to resist the Navy's attempt to monopolize shipping. He had to swallow his anger for now and plan to discuss a directly-controlled shipping company after the Hong Kong shipyard began mass-producing ships. Now, the focus of all tasks must revolve around the Department of Colonization and Trade's operations in Hongji! If they could once and for all solve the coal supply problem plaguing the Senate, his voice at Executive Committee and Senate meetings would be much louder. The requests he made would also be more "reasonable."

"Whether a request is 'reasonable' depends on how important you are within the group." Skaed often said this.

He looked down from the large glass window beside his desk: in the hall, several Senators from the Colonial Department and naturalized citizen staff were busy around a newly made sand table. This sand table represented the situation around Hongji in Vietnam. It was made by enlarging old-time-space maps and modifying them with survey data reported from the front.
