# Chapter 818 - Dabo Shipping Company

The ships of the Leizhou Station's shipping firm were small in tonnage, diverse in type, and in poor condition. The personnel were a mixed bag: many were small-time pirates left unemployed after the Lingao Navy seized control of the strait, or deserters from the government naval forces. There were also water braves previously hired by Zhu An. Although the Leizhou Station provided better pay and the Navy's trade escort system prevented trouble, they remained a latent threat.

As for the Navy itself, it naturally had concerns about a fleet operating completely outside its command structure. In relevant meetings, the proposal to "strengthen unified management of maritime vessels" was constantly raised.

However, unifying the Guangzhou and Leizhou fleets under the Navy's banner and putting them under complete naval control would create an overly complex command structure. Departments in Lingao didn't feel it: calling a ship just meant phoning the Ministry of the Navy and having the Transport Division schedule it. But for external stations, it was very inconvenient.

The Guangzhou Station had originally decided to form the Gaoguang Shipping Firm because the procedures for requisitioning ships were cumbersome. At that time, using a ship required telegraphing Lingao, going through the naval command structure to issue transfer paperwork. Not only were there many steps wasting time, but the operation was rigid—sailors on the ships weren't under the Guangzhou Station's direct command; any slight change required re-telegraphing Lingao to amend orders, making it completely unsuitable for commercial trade. Finally, they had to authorize external stations to organize their own transport fleets.

Combined, these factors ultimately prompted the Executive Committee to decide to reform the existing maritime shipping system and formally establish a shipping company. This shipping company was to be a joint-stock corporation, with the Council of Elders holding 51% and the remainder open to subscription by locals and naturalized citizens. Qivei was naturally the first shareholder; they originally held shares in the Gaoguang Shipping Firm.

The newly established shipping company would undertake all the Transmigration Group's shipping business in Guangdong waters, as well as trade shipping to Vietnam. The company headquarters would be in Hong Kong, with shipping offices in Lingao, Xuwen, Qiongshan, Guangzhou, and Sanya. In the long term, shipping agencies would be set up in every county of Hainan Island and along the Guangdong coast. It would integrate the fleets originally belonging to the Guangzhou and Leizhou stations. At the same time, the Navy would transfer some vessels unsuitable for combat service to the shipping company, including the five-masted great ship bought from the Hai family.

The shipping company would operate independently in transport business but fall under the dual leadership of the Postal and Transport Commission and the Navy in terms of organization—similar to the British Merchant Navy Reserve system. All shipping company personnel would be enlisted in the Navy Reserve, with senior seamen granted Navy Reserve officer ranks. Every year, time would be set aside for military training and exercises.

After the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign ended, utilizing the window before the peace treaty was signed, the Executive Committee commissioned the Navy, the Political Security Bureau, and the Postal and Transport Commission to conduct a three-month large-scale reorganization and training of the Leizhou and Gaoguang shipping firms. All indigenous personnel underwent political vetting and study. Unreliable elements were purged: some transferred to land jobs, a few notorious ones with blood debts sent to labor camps. The remaining personnel underwent a major shake-up: some young, able-bodied pirates and water braves were replenished into the Navy, while older sailors or those with injuries/illness or low plasticity eliminated by the Navy were transferred to the shipping company. The shipping company's vessels also underwent some cleanup and overhaul, phasing out excessively small boats—from an efficiency standpoint, large ships were more economical in manpower than small ones.

The new shipping company was formally named "Dabo Shipping Company." And Zhang Dabala returned to Leizhou after finishing several months of study camp life in Lingao. This old sea dog who had originally just been looking for a meal ticket had, after receiving comprehensive "re-education," thoroughly solidified his resolve to become a "founding merit subject." He attended a ceremony in Lingao and accepted the rank of Navy Reserve Ensign. He resumed his position as captain—he would sail mainly on the Vietnam trade route, which was also the route he knew best.

Zhang Dabala walked into a former sugar merchant's residence on Hai'an Street. This had been converted into the Vietnam Trade Company's base and Dabo Shipping Company's Xuwen Office. Craftsmen were going in and out of the courtyard; banging and hammering sounds were everywhere, and construction materials littered the ground. It was undergoing remodeling.

The person he was looking for was Yan Maoda—currently, Yan Maoda concurrently served as Director of the Dabo Shipping Xuwen Representative Office. Yan Maoda assigned him a task: set sail tomorrow to take several Elders and a ship of cargo to Vietnam.

"Besides myself, there are several other Elders."

Preparing to go to Vietnam, in addition to Yan Maoda going for scouting and layout, and Bei Kai preparing to be stationed permanently, were several Elders from the military, construction company, and long-range exploration team. They were the advance party for constructing the Hongji Armed Trading Post.

"Understood, this lowly one—I will definitely deliver the Chiefs safely." Zhang Dabala was confident. "Never mind that we've switched to a new ship now; even in a fishing boat, I'd keep the Chiefs safe and sound."

"Mm, I know you have the skill." Yan Maoda smiled. "Take us to Haiyang first, then from Haiyang to Hongji. Any difficulties on the way?"

"None." Zhang Dabala appeared very assured. "Projected trip duration? So I can arrange water, rice, and vegetables for the ship."

"Bring as much as possible. Bring plenty. We'll be gone a long time this time." Yan Maoda said, "This voyage to Vietnam isn't like past trips for peddling goods; it's an important mission concerning the Great Cause. You must focus 120 percent; preparations must be foolproof."

"Yes!" Hearing this voyage had great significance, Zhang Dabala's enthusiasm immediately surged. Since he wanted to follow the dragon, he had to earn merit; he couldn't end up with only hard work to his name. For a moment he didn't know how to express his determination, finally blurting out, "Please watch Old Zhang perform, Chiefs!"

Zhang Dabala's ship was a three-masted Guangzhou-style ship, originally about 350 tons displacement. After modification by the shipyard specifically to serve as an armed merchant vessel for Southeast Asia and the mainland coast, displacement increased to nearly 400 tons. The ship was newly equipped with six 48-pounder carronades and one typewriter [machine gun]. Enough to deter ordinary small bands of pirates. A low poop deck had been added at the stern for steering, command, and accommodation for senior seamen and VIP passengers. Yan Maoda and Bei Kai would stay there. Ship name: *Zhennan* [Suppressing the South].

Zhang Dabala arranged personnel overnight to load the ship: not only loading enough food and water for 30 days but also a large amount of trade goods—this voyage also had the purpose of delivering goods to local agents.

Besides sailors, 20 marines were dispatched to the ship for armed security, plus several escorts from the Qivei Escort Bureau's Leizhou branch as personal bodyguards.

The *Zhennan* set sail. The journey across the Gulf of Tonkin wasn't very smooth. Due to wind direction, the course had to be quite circuitous, taking nearly four days to reach Haiyang Port in Vietnam.

The Leizhou Station's Vietnam trade was quite vibrant. However, because it involved foreign policy issues, they hadn't expanded fully, only opening a trade warehouse in Haiyang Port under the name of their Leizhou shareholding enterprise, Dachang Rice Shop. They sold sugar and sundry goods to local merchants and bought rice, high-quality timber, and coal—there were small coal pits in the area. Their biggest trading partner in Haiyang was still Vu Ngoc Giap. This North Vietnamese landlord seemed to have endless rice, continuously selling them rice. Later, because Lingao's demand was too huge, Vu Ngoc Giap's stewards said they couldn't husk rice fast enough, so now they exported unhusked paddy directly.

Near the Haiyang wharf was a Chinese Merchant Street, gathering many merchants from the Ming dynasty, peddling various sundry goods from China and Southeast Asia. The Dachang Warehouse was located on this street.

From the street scenes and pedestrians, this place looked very similar to small coastal counties in the Ming. Even the sounds were various Ming dialects, predominantly Cantonese, Hokkien, and Hakka. On the road, Yan Maoda and Bei Kai even saw several small regional guild halls. It showed how deeply Chinese people had penetrated this place.

Yan Maoda thought this was a force that could be utilized. Once the comprehensive conquest of Vietnam began, these Ming merchants and craftsmen who had settled in Vietnam for years and knew the local customs would be an effective auxiliary force for maintaining stability. But right now these Chinese were temporarily unreliable—not only unreliable but potentially dangerous. Dachang Warehouse hadn't complained to him infrequently—local Chinese merchants had very strong regional cliques; in their minds, there were only fellow villagers, not fellow countrymen. Not only did they suppress commercial rivals openly and covertly, but they would also occasionally invite wolves into the house, colluding with local officials and bandits to harm their compatriots.

As a brand-new outsider, Dachang naturally suffered its share of overt and covert attacks. Fortunately, they were powerful; ordinary commercial tricks couldn't topple them. And the cooperative relationship with Vu Ngoc Giap, the local landlord-tyrant, meant others didn't dare act rashly.

The group arrived at the warehouse. It had high walls and deep courtyards, heavily guarded—the officials of the Le Dynasty only cared about collecting money and never asked about local security; merchants had to protect themselves. Dachang Warehouse stored and sold bulk sugar and rice; the slightest carelessness could lead to arson risks.

The local manager was named Zhu Fuyuan, a clan brother of Dachang Rice Shop owner Zhu Fusheng. His family was very poor; he originally made a living running errands for Ming merchants in Haiyang. He could speak excellent Vietnamese and several dialects. Yan Maoda's investigation revealed he had a family in Xuwen—wife and children—and was a decent person. His whole family depended on the dozen taels of silver he earned annually from Vietnam; life was difficult. Yan Maoda recruited him as warehouse manager, offering not only generous pay but also frequent small favors to win over his family. Soon, this man was devoted to the Transmigration Group.
