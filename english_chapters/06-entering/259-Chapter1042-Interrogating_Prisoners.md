# Chapter 1042: Interrogating Prisoners

The Haenyeo (sea women) saw that these people before them were extraordinary in appearance, probably high-ranking officials of the "bald-haired pirates." Although they had little knowledge, they understood that under authority, only submission could minimize suffering and save their lives. They all knelt on the ground with submissive expressions.

The two sides exchanged a few words. The Korean of the 21st century and the Jeju dialect of the 17th century were obviously very different. Feng Zongze and Nangong Wudi's Korean proficiency was only at an elementary level, making communication somewhat difficult. Gesturing while speaking, fortunately, Korean, like Japanese, is a linguistic island with strong isolation, and changes over hundreds of years were not significant. After a round of body language, expressions, and "Smida," Feng Zongze finally managed to communicate smoothly with the Haenyeo.

From the Haenyeo, they learned that these sea women indeed came from a nearby fishing village. There were few men in the fishing village; most were women. Because men often encountered storms and died at sea when fishing, over time, Haenyeo villages dominated by women were formed. Women mainly made a living as Haenyeo, harvesting various seafood to make dried goods, then selling them to merchants.

Life was naturally extremely arduous. The money from selling dried abalone, sea cucumber, and other seafood, exchanged for a little grain plus the fish catch, was barely enough to survive. Unlike what the Senators imagined, Jeju Island was not self-sufficient in grain and relied on imports from the Korean Peninsula. Although the Haenyeo couldn't talk much about the big picture, the older Haenyeo all said that the population had been decreasing in the last ten years or so—many people had moved to the peninsula.

In the past few years, Jeju Island had suffered continuous natural disasters. The court's grain relief was both meager and slow, and many people died of starvation or fled. Many nearby villages were abandoned.

As for the specific situation on the island, the Haenyeo didn't know much—they rarely went out. Merchants buying seafood and selling grain came to the village every month. Some people in the village had been to Jeju City. Because Jeongui County was close, quite a few people had been there.

Feng Zongze sat up straight and asked: "What is the population of Jeongui County? How many soldiers? How large is the city?"

"My Lord, we slave maids are ignorant and lowly common women. We don't understand clearly what the Lords are asking. If we answer poorly, please forgive us..." The Haenyeo who answered was about twenty-five or twenty-six years old, looking relatively clever. Whenever Feng Zongze asked, she answered. She lowered her head and said respectfully, "This slave maid does not know the population of Jeongui County, only that there are few households inside the city, and two villages outside the city. The total is just two or three thousand people."

As for soldiers, there were about two hundred. The Haenyeo had no concept of dimensions regarding the city's size and couldn't explain clearly. However, she said there was a large government granary in the city storing a lot of grain.

This was important news. Feng Zongze and Nangong Wudi's eyes lit up—grain was the top priority. Especially hearing about Jeju Island's...

"I heard there are many cattle and horses here; where are they?"

"The cattle and horses are all in the mountains over by Hallasan, all over the mountains and plains. Just not many here—" the Haenyeo answered. The reason there weren't many was the lack of sufficient water sources by the seaside. Cattle and horses needed large amounts of drinking water, and this area only had springs.

Feng Zongze nodded with satisfaction and asked again: "What is your name?"

The Haenyeo hesitated and said: "Reporting to my Lord: This lowly maid is of the Pan clan."

This wasn't really a name—but even until the 1930s in China, many women in remote rural areas were just "Clan X" for their whole lives. Haenyeo were commoners (baekjeong/lowborn), only slightly better than public and private slaves (nobi). Not having a name was normal.

"Are you an Upper Army (*Sang-gun*)?" he suddenly asked.

The Haenyeo widened her eyes at him, then hurriedly lowered her head again:

"This lowly maid is young, only a Middle Army (*Jung-gun*)."

The so-called Upper Army and Middle Army were ranks within the Haenyeo community of Jeju Island. Starting from "Child Upper Army," passing through Lower Army, Middle Army, Upper Army, finally reaching Great Upper Army.

But these titles only circulated among Jeju Island's Haenyeo; even the officials and scholar-bureaucrats of the Joseon Dynasty might not know them. That a foreign pirate actually knew surprised the Haenyeo quite a bit.

Nangong Wudi and Xue Ziliang asked some more about the local situation. The Haenyeo knew some things and didn't know others; obviously, there was little value in further questioning.

Feng Zongze instructed to take them down: "Give each person a relief biscuit and a bowl of hot soup. Let them retrieve their clothes and fishing tools."

"What, still keeping them?" Nangong Wudi's enthusiasm for the Haenyeo had dropped considerably—although the Haenyeo's figures were not bad, and two were quite young, their looks didn't appeal to him much.

"Keep them temporarily; we'll decide what to do with them together after interrogating the soldiers," Feng Zongze said. He didn't have any romantic thoughts about the Haenyeo but intended to use them for civil affairs work. According to the article "How to Use Class Theory in Civil Affairs Work" written by Du Wen: the oppressed class are natural rebels plus collaborators. Haenyeo had low status and lived hard lives, possessing the desire and motivation to turn over a new leaf.

Next, the soldiers were interrogated. According to the Special Reconnaissance Detachment's report, there were only five garrison soldiers on the beacon tower. When the Special Reconnaissance Detachment appeared suddenly, they didn't even attempt to resist, only trying to flee. It seemed they had absolutely no will to fight.

Looking at the soldiers' appearance, one knew their will to fight wouldn't be high. The soldiers looked emaciated, obviously having been underfed for a long time. The battle jackets they wore were tattered and faded. They had no armor, wearing only bamboo hats, and their weapons were extremely crude. The Senators had seen Ming army weapons captured in the Battle of Chengmai and various miscellaneous equipment discarded by pirates. But the standard of weapons and equipment of the Joseon army before them couldn't even compare to large groups of pirates. There were no firearms already common in the Ming army; the shafts of the long spears equipped were extremely short, at most 1.70 meters. Apart from serving as ceremonial guards, they were basically useless. The swords were also crude. Their bows and arrows were slightly better, looking well-made.

The Joseon Dynasty under the rule of the Yi family was known as "Little China." In its disregard for the military, it not only looked up to the Ming Dynasty but went even further—the Ming Dynasty at least had a small number of elite household troops (*jiading*) as the core of the army.

Nangong Wudi looked at these soldiers and weapons and thought: if I were Kinoshita Tokichiro (Toyotomi Hideyoshi), I'd come to hit Joseon too—what difference is there between this army and scarecrows?

The soldiers quickly confessed everything they knew. As soldiers, they were frequently transferred around the island. Moreover, the head of the beacon soldiers had been a soldier here for more than twenty years and had stayed in almost all defense posts across the island. He knew much more than the Haenyeo.

From the soldiers' mouths, Nangong Wudi learned that there were a total of three Divisions (*Sa*) of soldiers on the island, each Division having five hundred men. That is to say, the regular army of the whole island was one thousand five hundred men, lower than the figure of two thousand they originally grasped.

The Moksa (Magistrate) of the island had been requesting the court to expand the garrison in Jeju to five Divisions to make up a full battalion. However, with constant natural and man-made disasters in recent years, the court was overwhelmed and had neither the heart nor the power to strengthen Jeju Island's defense. Fortunately, since the Tokugawa Seclusion, the scourge of Japanese pirates was much less than before, so they barely managed.

Because the enemy threat to Jeju Island came mainly from the sea, these three Divisions of soldiers were deployed dispersedly across the island. Jeju had five hundred men, and Daejeong and Jeongui counties each had more than two hundred. In addition, there were nine garrison points—"Po" (ports), similar to the Ming Dynasty's Wei-Suo. Each Po had thirty to fifty garrison soldiers. These garrison points were set up at the bays entering and leaving Jeju Island, lined up along the coastline, fully reflecting the coastal defense thinking of guarding ports. Additionally, there were eighteen beacon towers, each with five beacon soldiers.

The Joseon army was equipped with artillery; various garrisons and cities had small amounts of artillery, but no heavy equipment like the Ming army's Red Barbarian Cannons.

In this view, the largest heavy troop group was merely the five hundred men in Jeju. One infantry company could easily annihilate them.

As for the navy, the Joseon Dynasty basically had no navy on the island. Only a small number of small boats patrolled along the coast.

"Who are the officials on the island? Confess them one by one!" Feng Zongze shouted.

"Yes. The Jeju Observer (Governor) is Lord Yi Jin-gyeong, the Judge is Lord Yi Dae-ha, the Daejeong Magistrate is Lord Yi Gu, and the Jeongui Magistrate is Lord Choi In-geon."

The Jeju Observer was the highest official of the Joseon Dynasty on the island, a rank-3 civil official, while the Judge was the highest military official on the island.

"How many official slaves (*gwan-nobi*) are on the island, and where are they?"

Official slaves were what the Senators were most interested in—they were excellent candidates for collaborators. Taking a step back, even if the official slaves didn't have high awareness, they were the most convenient labor force to use.

"The government offices of the three cities of Jeju, Daejeong, and Jeongui all have official slaves. This lowly one doesn't know the total number, but there must be tens of thousands. In the famine a few years ago, many starved to death or fled..."

The Forward Command was quite satisfied with the soldiers' confession, having grasped a lot of detailed intelligence.

After ordering the prisoners taken down, the Forward Command held a brief meeting and decided that delay would be trouble. Troops must be dispatched immediately to control the three cities of Jeju, seizing all grain stored in each city. Disarm the various garrison points. At the same time, control the main ports entering and leaving Jeju Island.

Nangong Wudi proposed sending a special task force mixed with infantry and artillery. The infantry would march on foot along the official roads on the island, while artillery and supplies would use the large motorized boats and rowboats brought by the fleet to maneuver along the coastline. Among the three counties of Jeju, except for Jeongui County, both Jeju and Daejeong were by the sea. Ships could be used very conveniently for supply support.

Out of caution, it was decided to first capture Jeongui County, which was closest to the Seongsan base, to get an intuitive understanding of the combat effectiveness and city defense system of the Joseon army, and then launch the next step of operations depending on the situation.

Jeongui County is the Seongeup Folk Village of South Korea in the old timeline. When South Korea developed tourism, the old site of the county was restored and built into a folk village. Although not by the sea, it is actually very close to Seongsan. There is also a passable road. Both Xue Ziliang and Nangong Wudi had been to this folk village. However, the folk village was built in later generations after all; although there was restoration and so-called historical research, no one could guarantee how big the difference was from reality.
