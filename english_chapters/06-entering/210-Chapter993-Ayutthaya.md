# Chapter 993 - Ayutthaya

Divine King Prasat Thong rose as usual, opened his bedchamber window, and looked outside. The entire city of Ayutthaya was still bathed in sunlight. Ayutthaya, which the Chinese habitually called "the Great City," was situated on a river island 100 kilometers northeast of modern Bangkok. Ayutthaya meant "City of Eternal Victory." This was the ruling center of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which dominated Thai history for 600 years.

Though the Siamese Kingdom was not yet unified, Ayutthaya city was already magnificent. The urban area had expanded to 15 square kilometers. According to the English, the population was roughly comparable to London's—meaning at least 200,000 people.

Even by the standards of the heavily populated Great Ming, a city of 200,000 was already very large-scale. At its peak era, it supposedly had one million inhabitants.

Within the city, the royal palace was resplendent, Buddhist pagodas stood like forests, and commercial prosperity was second to none in Southeast Asia. Because Ayutthaya was built on a large island at the confluence of three rivers, water transport was highly developed. Aquatic products from the south and agricultural products from the north gathered here for trading. Products from as far as China were also continuously shipped in by sea.

But the Divine King had no heart to admire his capital's magnificent scenery. Early that morning, he had heard a palace servant's report that five days ago, a fleet had arrived outside the mouth of the Chao Phraya River—quite large in scale. The key point was they flew a flag never seen before. They were currently anchored on the Thonburi shore of the Chao Phraya River.

Prasat Thong had been very cautious about outsiders lately. Last year, Ayutthaya's great merchant Yamada Nagamasa had died from infection after being wounded while accompanying the Siamese army in suppressing a rebellion in Nakhon Si Thammarat. Though he had repeatedly assured Yamada's Japanese subordinates that he hadn't poisoned Yamada, he still couldn't gain their trust. Meanwhile, his ministers had long been jealous of the Japanese business in Ayutthaya, and had instructed the army to burn down the Japanese town at the south gate. The conflict escalated further, and the Japanese volunteer corps and merchants fled in droves to Cambodia. Before this mess was even cleaned up, just one month ago, a messenger had brought news from Edo: Shogun Iemitsu was furious about the treatment of merchants with Shogunate connections in Siam and had formally terminated trade with Siam. This made the young king's life even harder—the Burmese to the west were growing stronger, having successively captured Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai.

Though Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai belonged to the Lanna Kingdom—one of the "Three Tais"—and not Ayutthaya territory, they were Ayutthaya's vassal states. The two sides had a close alliance relationship. The principle of "when lips perish, teeth grow cold" wasn't difficult for the rulers of Ayutthaya, descendants of Chinese, to understand.

Though local Siamese were brave, they lacked quality weapons. Southeast Asian metallurgy and handicrafts had always been backward. In the past, swords had all been imported from Japan, while the silver earned from exports was used to purchase gunpowder, arquebuses, and cannons from the Portuguese and Dutch. Once Japan trade was cut off, all this became problematic.

He knew Thonburi—there were only some small fishing villages there, plus a small number of Ming Chinese merchants. Compared to great ports like Pattani where merchants gathered, Thonburi was relatively quiet. This was because the exports here were mainly rice and timber, while foreign merchants were more interested in spices from the Southern Seas.

He began questioning the messenger about this group's information.

From the messenger, he learned that this group differed from Ming Chinese merchants. Though they had the same faces and also used Chinese characters, their speech and physique weren't like Ming people—not to mention that short hair, which was rather similar to some Siamese generals' hairstyles.

"They say they came here to purchase our rice. If we're willing, they're prepared to trade with us using silver and weapons." Having finished speaking, the messenger presented to the Divine King the sample the Australians had given: a standard machete. His Majesty carefully examined the blade. This knife wasn't much better than Japanese swords.

This blade was Lingao's mass-produced 1631 standard machete, replacing the 1629 model. It was widely issued to armies and militia, especially in the Navy and Marine Corps—and was also used in agricultural production. It was a dual-use military and civilian product. Except for minor handle details, the blades were completely identical.

Because it was a mass-produced practical tool, the materials and processes were quite simple. The blade was directly stamped from blank steel, then heat-treated and blued, finally shaped, sharpened, and fitted with a handle. Then wrapped in oilpaper and packed in wooden crates.

Such a knife, in terms of cost and process complexity, was far inferior to the Japanese swords shipped to East and Southeast Asia for sale. But thanks to batch-manufactured quality steel, heat treatment technology, and chemical treatment, the quality was no worse than three-tael lower-grade Japanese swords.

Prasat Thong ordered his military officers to take the knife out and "test" it, comparing it to various imported Japanese swords. After a while, the officer reported that this knife's quality was no worse than Japanese swords. It was also much lighter.

This moved Prasat Thong's heart, and he asked about the price.

"They say every hundred costs one hundred Chinese taels of silver."

Everyone present was somewhat astonished. One should know Japanese swords were truly not cheap. Lower-grade Japanese swords were three hundred taels per hundred. Even the lowest grade—"common folk's everyday self-defense implements, not weapons of war"—the worst Japanese swords still sold for one tael apiece.

By comparison, Ping Qiusheng's quoted price was very conscientious: one hundred knives for one hundred taels. Equivalent to the price of the worst Japanese swords. The value-for-money was so high that Divine King Prasat Thong asked about the price twice.

"The Australians said, this kind of knife, as well as spears of similar quality, they have as many as we need. As long as we give them sufficient rice plus the privilege to build a trading post in Thonburi and conduct trade." Having received benefits from the Australians, the messenger quickly explained when he saw the king deep in thought.

"Then have Worawong handle this matter." Even if the quality wasn't as high as Japanese swords, as long as supply was sufficient, this was what the kingdom most needed. Besides, there was plenty of rice here. If the Burmese to the west continued their attacks, it would only benefit them for nothing.

Thonburi was on the west bank of what is now Bangkok. In this timeline, due to Pattani's resources and geographic conditions, it hadn't developed. Its rise came only after the fall of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Currently, apart from the core Ayutthaya region, the southwestern regions could only be considered a federation or confederation unified under the Siamese banner.

In the 16th century, Thailand had three kingdoms: Sukhothai, Lanna, and Phayao. Following Chinese convention, they could be called the Three Thai. The Three Thai had an alliance relationship. Later, the Ayutthaya (Great City) Kingdom established by Uthong—a descendant of Chinese merchants—replaced Sukhothai, defeated the Khmer, and made Sukhothai an Ayutthaya vassal. As for Lanna, it survived as an Ayutthaya dependency until the 19th century.

The Bangkok region of later eras was still dense jungle at this time. Bangkok itself didn't exist. The only usable port was Thonburi on the Chao Phraya's west bank. But this was the Chao Phraya's outlet—a very important geographic location, convenient for absorbing the large quantities of rice from the Chao Phraya basin.

Thailand's northeast was plateau terrain. Due to mountain barriers creating a rain-shadow climate, summers were dry while rainy season water was excessive—not suitable for cultivation. Thailand's ranking among the top three global rice exporters in the original timeline was entirely thanks to the Chao Phraya riverside. As long as they controlled the Chao Phraya's outlet, they could continuously absorb Siam's rice. After Operation Engine was completed and the Southeast Asia strategy began, the transmigrator group's grain problem in South China could basically be permanently solved. According to data Ping Qiusheng had found in the Grand Library, during the mid-Qing period, the Siamese region exported 11 million *shi* of rice annually to Guangdong—equivalent to half of all Japan's *kokudaka*! Even if only one-third or one-quarter of such resources were controlled by the transmigrator group in this era, it would be enough to feed Hainan's entire population for a year with surplus. The remaining issue was just transport capacity.

During the few days waiting for the messenger to depart, the fleet wasn't idle. Besides measuring hydrographics and surrounding terrain, the survey team also sent out investigation teams to survey other local resources. Within two days, the dispatched team brought Ping Qiusheng a pleasant surprise.

"Old Ping, look what this is!" Investigation team member Liu Zheng exclaimed with surprise in his voice. In his hand was an irregularly crystallized yellow substance.

"Amber? Where did you get this?"

"This is potash ore—specifically, carnallite. There's a large quantity of this nearby. No wonder the land here is so fertile." Liu Zheng had spent a long time with the survey team and was now very familiar with ores—no longer the pure outdoor enthusiast he once was.

"This is good stuff." he said. Because of surveying, Liu Zheng dealt frequently with industrial and agricultural departments. What agricultural Elders often mentioned was the fertilizer problem.

Fertilizer wasn't just nitrogen fertilizer—potassium and phosphorus fertilizers were also needed. Compared to phosphorus fertilizer, which had guano and phosphate rock supplies, potassium fertilizer supply had always been short. This shortage couldn't be solved simply by upgrading industry—not just Lingao or Hainan, but all of East Asia lacked sufficient potash ore. Lingao's potassium fertilizer source came from the refined salt industry at Ma'ao. But production was very low—roughly every hundred tons of refined salt produced only yielded two tons of potassium salts. A drop in the bucket.

If they could obtain stable potash ore from Siam, it would be enormously helpful for the entire agricultural production. If bulk mining could begin and the potash processed into potassium fertilizer all went to Qiongshan's cooperatives, the more sensational the cooperatives' immediate effects, the more successful the series of agricultural reforms in Qiongshan would be.

At Liu Zheng's suggestion, potash ore was added to this trade's list.

Thailand's potash ore was mainly on the Khorat Plateau, with scattered deposits elsewhere. However, potash ore was generally buried quite deep, mostly around 300 meters underground. But due to the karst topography, some veins did surface, and mining conditions were still acceptable.
