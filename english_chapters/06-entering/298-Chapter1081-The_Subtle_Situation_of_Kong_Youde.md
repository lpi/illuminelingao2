# Chapter 1081 - The Subtle Situation of Kong Youde

Zhu Mingxia placed the baggage train and the old, weak, sick, and disabled in the middle. Huang Xiong led a company to bring up the rear, while he himself led a team in the front. The cavalry squad patrolled back and forth at the front and rear. He also asked people to take out the large flags he had prepared beforehand and raise them. With dozens of large flags fluttering, coupled with the neat ranks, from a distance it looked like an army of thousands marching. Unless one came close to look, it was quite imposing. This was Zhu Mingxia's strategy of "scattering beans to become soldiers." He wanted to pretend to be a paper tiger to scare the rebels in Huang County from acting recklessly. If the rebels really came to attack, the refugees whose movements were restricted wouldn't easily get in the way. He could either drive them to be cannon fodder or throw them aside and ignore them. In short, it wouldn't lead to a rout caused by the refugees panicking.

"Pay attention to recovering stragglers!" Zhu Mingxia issued a new order. The entire column began to crawl slowly on the icy and snowy ground.

The first leg of the operation was to return to the relay point before nightfall and rely on the village stockade to spend the night.

Zhu Mingxia got on a captured warhorse—when he was in Lingao, he went to the Cavalry Training Unit in the Gaoshanling area every week to receive riding training. Although he might not be able to wield a saber on horseback immediately, commanding a battle on horseback was no problem.

The wind was strong, blowing his face until it hurt. But seeing the rolling flow of people and horses beside him, he couldn't help but feel a little proud in his heart. Although most of them were haggard refugees, in a few years, they would all become an army of tigers and wolves.

The crowd moved slowly. Although the speed was very slow, they could still walk three or four kilometers per hour. Zhu Mingxia felt that returning to the relay station before nightfall was not a big problem.

Along the way, they still encountered scattered refugees and rebel roving cavalry—there were many rebel roving cavalry, and they were widely distributed. Obviously, Kong Youde attached great importance to Huang County and sent a large number of scout cavalry to operate.

Zhu Mingxia knew that southwest of Huang County was Laizhou. If the rebels wanted to expand their range of activities, they had to attack Laizhou first to fully stretch their limbs; otherwise, they would be trapped to death between the mountains and the sea in Dengzhou. Judging from history and the reality of this spacetime, the rebels sending troops to attack Huang County in the first lunar month confirmed that no matter which spacetime, the enemy's behavior pattern would not change too much.

Since the fall of Dengzhou, after the initial chaos, Dengzhou City had restored order. Rebel troops gathered in clouds, guarding more strictly than in the past. The traces after the massacre of the natives had been cleaned up, leaving only blackened bloodstains on the streets and by the walls.

After Li Jiucheng, Kong Youde, and others checked the warehouses and reorganized the routed troops and surrendered soldiers, they had tightly guarded the entire city. Each city gate was guarded by a Thousand-man Commander (*Qianzong*) personally leading many soldiers, strictly checking entry and exit—all using Liaodong men from Dongjiang origins. Outside the city, all strategic places, such as Mishen Mountain, were stationed full of infantry and cavalry. Not only was every household occupied by the army, but tents were also lined up in the four suburbs, with herds of warhorses. Once night fell, drums and horns sounded mutually, and horses neighed constantly. No one knew exactly how many rebels there were. Pedestrians going from south to north had to pass through layers of interrogation.

Because the killing was too heavy when the city was broken, Li, Kong, and others feared that the surrendered troops and people in the city who were not old Dongjiang men would have resentment and become insider support for the government troops. Therefore, control within Dengzhou City was extremely strict. Locals and Southerners were not allowed to walk on the main roads in the city; anyone discovered would be beheaded on the spot.

Recently, the defense within the city was strengthened again. Not only were sentries added everywhere during the night curfew, but even during the day, people were not allowed to walk without cause, and entry and exit required road passes. On the city wall, alertness was strengthened even more, with arrows passed day and night for warning. Anyone found not responding to the arrow passing would be executed without asking for the reason. The entire Dengzhou City was heavily guarded.

A few days ago, the rebels had privately cast the "Grand Marshal" seal, electing Li Jiucheng as "Grand Marshal," Kong Youde as "Vice Grand Marshal," and Geng Zhongming as Commander-in-Chief (*Dudu*).

The rebel "Marshal's Mansion," which was also the operational center of the entire army, was located in the former Dengzhou Governor's Yamen of Sun Yuanhua.

Most of the rebel generals were people who had experienced military affairs for a long time. Li Jiucheng was also a person who had served as the Vice Regional Commander of Dongjiang. He had his own set of rules for managing the army and preparing for war, handling various affairs in an orderly manner.

At this time, Kong Youde was standing with his hands behind his back in a hall of the "Marshal's Mansion," looking at two big trees in the courtyard—he was not old, only thirty, coming from a miner background and having been in the army for a long time, he had developed a robust and strong body.

Judging from his face alone, his expression was very calm, showing no tension or worry. However, deep in his heart, he was still thinking about himself and the future of Dongjiang at all times.

Rising up in rebellion was not Kong Youde's original intention; it was more of Li Jiucheng's idea. But once the rebellion flag was truly raised, he had made up his mind to go all the way to the dark.

Neither Kong Youde nor Li Jiucheng had plans to become Emperor themselves—although the Great Ming Dynasty had shown various signs of being terminally ill, it was still a behemoth after all. Rebellion had only a thirty percent chance of success but a ninety percent chance of death. Although they had planned to pull Sun Yuanhua into the gang, this was just to expand their momentum. As for what extent the rebellion should go to, the rebel high command did not have a unified understanding.

The door to appeasement was not closed. Whether Li, Kong, or Geng, they all knew very well that the court was now in a terrible fix. For any mutiny or civil unrest, as long as it reached a certain scale, appeasement was almost the thing the court was most willing to do. Not to mention far away, just the several mutinies at the end of Tianqi and the beginning of Chongzhen, almost none ended without "appeasement." Huang Long was beaten by rioting soldiers on Pi Island, even having his leg broken, and it finally ended with "appeasement" too.

So generally speaking, they still intended to use rebellion to get the best "appeasement" conditions. Therefore, from the beginning, they constantly expressed their willingness to accept appeasement by all means. Initially, this was a delaying tactic, used to delay the arrival of government troop suppression, expand territory as much as possible, and increase strength.

As long as they had strong power, they could propose sufficient conditions to the court. And this condition was what many generals from Dongjiang had always attempted.

That was to turn the Dongjiang Town into a third force that nominally belonged to the Great Ming but actually could maneuver between the Great Ming and the Later Jin.

Such a sign had already faintly appeared in the Guanning Town at that time—the military families commanding troops were transforming into warlords. Not only did they sit and receive large sums of military pay, but the court also began to gradually fail in commanding them.

Compared to Guanning Town, Dongjiang Town sat on the Liao Sea. Advancing, it could contain the Later Jin attempting to enter the pass; retreating, it could threaten the capital of Great Ming and Shandong. In order to deal with the Later Jin and ensure the safety of the flank, the court could only continuously transport military pay and grain, allowing them to form a military group that was factually a separatist regime. This was the old trick of "Allying with Manchus and Hijacking Korea" that Dongjiang soldiers had always plotted, establishing a third force in the crack between the two strong powers of Ming and Qing.

The Liu Xingzuo brothers, who once influenced Dongjiang Town after Mao Wenlong's death, had such a plan. But the Liu brothers were not Dongjiang veterans who followed Mao Wenlong to raise an army; their appeal was limited, so they ultimately couldn't succeed.

In comparison, people like Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde were almost all old subordinates who followed Mao Wenlong to raise the army and created Dongjiang single-handedly back then. Li Jiucheng had also served as the Vice Regional Commander of Dongjiang and had high prestige among the Dongjiang veterans.

As long as the court was willing to appease, and Li Jiucheng was appointed as the Regional Commander of Dongjiang, the Dongjiang old subordinates could get rid of Huang Long, this "outsider," and act freely with their hands and feet untied.

The calculation was indeed good, but Kong Youde knew well that things wouldn't be that simple—especially since a few days ago, Sun Yuanhua unexpectedly and bizarrely disappeared from the Surveillance Commissioner's Yamen where he was under house arrest, disappearing without a trace!

The guards watching him either died or knew nothing. Although the stationed guards in the Surveillance Commissioner's Yamen were all Liaodong men, after the incident, the guards were tortured, but came up empty. They were either asleep or heard and saw nothing.

Losing Sun Yuanhua meant losing the biggest bargaining chip in their hands. Compared to other officials captured together, Sun Yuanhua had the highest official rank, the widest connections in the court, and was the highest chief of the Dengzhou-Laizhou region. His every word and deed could have a great influence. Originally, Li Jiucheng and others planned to use him to come forward and contact the court for appeasement matters.

Sun Yuanhua's bizarre disappearance also brought a more terrible potential threat: Who on earth could take him away unknowingly from inside Dengzhou City under heavy guard?

Although on the next day, it was discovered on a watchtower that all the platform guards were killed, and it was very likely that the other party entered over the wall, regardless of Li or Kong, almost no one believed that someone had such ability—even if there were strange people like Hongxian (*Red Thread*) in the world, what she stole was just a box, while Sun Yuanhua was a big living person.

Missing were not only Sun Yuanhua, but also two servant boys and a family guard serving Sun Yuanhua. No one dared to say they believed these four big living persons could be taken out of Dengzhou City from the city wall in a grand manner in the dark night.

Orders forbidding the spread of any news were issued that very day. Other guards in the Surveillance Commissioner's Yamen that day, as long as they were alive, were all silenced from top to bottom. But this matter caused suspicion among the rebel high command—many people believed that this was done by a certain high-ranking general in the city, who likely hid Sun Yuanhua to use as capital for his future "defection to the bright side" (*Fan Zheng*).

And Kong Youde was the person under the deepest suspicion—almost everyone believed: If anyone would do this, then Kong Youde was the most likely person.

First, he had received great kindness from Sun Yuanhua—not stopping at this, the relationship between Sun Yuanhua and Kong Youde was not as simple as kindness. Many people had heard rumors that Sun Yuanhua's becoming the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou was related to Kong Youde secretly bribing big shots in the court. And after Sun Yuanhua became the Governor of Dengzhou, he indeed treated Kong Youde not thinly.

Secondly, Kong Youde's authority and appeal in the rebel high command were second only to Li Jiucheng. If he wanted to defect, he was in the most favorable position—as long as he got rid of Li Jiucheng, the "chief evil," he would not only be guiltless but might even gain merit.

These factors added together made Kong Youde's situation very unfavorable.
