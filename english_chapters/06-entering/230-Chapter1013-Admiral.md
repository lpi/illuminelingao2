# Chapter 1013 Admiral

Looking out from the observation deck atop the red-tiled roof of the Navy Department Building: the autumn sky was high with wispy clouds, the sea sparkling with waves—the new Navy Department Building was built in Bopu Port, bidding farewell to the previous "building" constructed from colored steel panels. The three-and-a-half-story red brick building with red-tiled pitched roof, cast iron railing observation deck, and continuous arched windows all exuded a Victorian decorative style—fully expressing certain people's tastes within the Navy.

The Navy Department Building's observation deck was a small platform on the roof, with a hanging brass ship's bell—not taken from any historically significant vessel, just old salvage bought from Macau, purely decorative.

The platform had several rattan chairs and a rattan table. This was where senior Senator naval officers drank tea during leisure time. However, according to the Navy's "balcony privilege," only Naval Command Chief Chen Haiyang and Naval People's Commissar Ming Qiu came regularly. Others consciously waited until invited before coming here.

Ming Qiu came here every day to gaze out, allowing both mind and body sufficient rest.

As a man already past sixty, by this dimension's standards he was already quite elderly. But thanks to the old dimension's good sanitary and nutritional conditions and many years of military life, Ming Qiu's body still appeared healthy and vigorous.

However, many years of naval service had still left him with various ailments. Although not too serious, the new dimension's healthcare level had greatly regressed. Health Department Head Shi recommended he "rest more, exercise more, worry less." Actually, even if he had the enthusiasm, most Senators' daily high-intensity work was already beyond his capacity.

Ming Qiu was well aware: The experience and prestige he had accumulated in the PLAN had no decisive significance in this navy with entirely different technical level, political foundation, and even values. So regarding naval construction, he mainly focused on naval professional business fields, never expressing opinions on content involving values and ideology.

So as Naval People's Commissar, he rarely appeared at Senate hearings and such, more often playing an "advisor" role, providing opinions and suggestions for the Senate's new navy, including participating in building naval regulations, drill manuals, and training systems.

He sat in a rattan chair under the white canvas awning, wearing the Senate Navy's formal summer uniform—a short-sleeved small suit-collar pure cotton white shirt, with rear admiral epaulettes on his shoulders—one of the Navy's only two rear admirals. His feelings toward this new navy were complex. Although he hadn't voluntarily come to this dimension to build a "new world order," merely going along with circumstances, this new navy had given him and his whole family unprecedented high position and power. As long as he was willing, he could achieve maximum fulfillment...

"Chief, your tea."

A female naval orderly solicitously brought him black tea—watching a young girl in white pullover sailor uniform, blue pleated skirt, wearing a brimless round soft cap with Morning Star insignia, bringing black tea brewed in "Senator-exclusive" bone china tea set produced by Lingao Porcelain Factory, a strong sense of incongruity surged in his heart, once again reminding him: He was no longer a member of the PLAN—he was "serving the Senate and the People."

The Navy Department Building before him, the female orderly's uniform, even this balcony, all fully expressed this "new navy's" aesthetic tastes. Honestly, Ming Qiu really wasn't used to it. Even in the PLAN, jokingly called the "Army Naval Corps," the navy was a "foreign-style" service branch. But this Senate Navy's "foreign style" was unique—like the "mixed candy" he'd eaten as a child, with all kinds of flavors.

"Chief, would you like sugar?" the female orderly trained at the maid school asked in a voice both low and clear enough for him to hear.

"No." Ming Qiu didn't have the habit of adding sugar to tea—or rather, he never drank black tea at all. Drinking black tea was another new custom created by this "Senate Navy." Although Ming Qiu found this unremarkable, even sneered at it, he at least understood the worldly wisdom of "going with the flow."

He took a sip of black tea. Its rich aroma, completely unlike green tea, filled his mouth—this dimension had no Ceylon tea, Assam tea, or Lapsang Souchong: these teas hadn't appeared yet. He was drinking "South Sea Black Tea" that Wu Nanhai had fermented at the farm from tea leaves shipped from Fujian.

The female orderly then brought a cigar box, with a patterned seal reading "Navy Special Supply" on the box—he took one. For health reasons, Li Mei had repeatedly suggested he give up cigarettes and switch to healthier cigars. Ming Qiu had followed this fashion.

He smoked his cigar, gazing at the forest of masts in the distant harbor and the black smoke occasionally erupting—newly built and converted ships were gathering in port. Operation Engine was imminent.

Chen Haiyang and Wen Desi, who had summoned him on behalf of the Executive Committee, had already spoken with him separately: The Senate's first blue-water fleet was about to be formed; no one but Ming Qiu could command this fleet. After all, Ming Qiu was not only Naval People's Commissar but also the only person in the entire transmigrator group with experience commanding a fast attack craft squadron.

However, he was after all over sixty. Although overall still healthy, whether he could sustain commanding a naval formation for long-term sea patrols and combat readiness was something many doubted. Chen Haiyang also said he "need not force himself."

Ming Qiu readily agreed. He was already an old man, of course not fighting for money, position, or fame anymore. Moreover, commanding steam-sail era naval combat wasn't his specialty. The reason he accepted this task was mainly to satisfy past regrets.

He knew that because of occupational diseases from his many years in the navy, Li Mei had privately chatted with Executive Committee leaders several times. But he felt his greatest regret in life was never achieving the slightest real combat merit at sea. He'd never even truly participated in actual combat—this bit of illness shouldn't prevent him from going to sea. Ming Qiu didn't think his body had any problems.

His thoughts drifted with the cigar smoke, dispersing in the air. Suddenly he heard a "Attention!" command. The door to the observation deck opened, and Naval Command Chief Chen Haiyang walked up.

Chen Haiyang had served as gunnery officer on a submarine chaser and deputy captain of a frigate. However, his seniority in the PLAN was far below Ming Qiu's. So although both currently held the same rank, and there was no subordinate relationship between Naval People's Commissar and Naval Command Chief, given the military's tendency to rank by seniority, Chen Haiyang was still very respectful toward him.

"Commissar Ming, quite the leisurely mood!" Chen Haiyang said, striding over quickly and plopping down in the rattan chair across from him. Here, naval etiquette could be temporarily set aside.

Ming Qiu nodded. They often discussed naval construction work on the observation deck. He and Chen Haiyang weren't close friends, but he quite appreciated this straightforward person.

The female orderly brought him black tea. Chen Haiyang casually waved: "Just leave it."

"Yes, Chief." The orderly realized the two chiefs needed to talk and, following protocol, withdrew from the observation deck.

"Old Ming—" Privately, Chen Haiyang always addressed Ming Qiu the way ordinary Senators did. "Are you prepared to accept the First Fleet Commander position?"

According to the General Staff's plan: the 854-Modified cruiser *Lichun*, and the already launched 901-type first-class gunboats—*Chedian*, *Yufeng*, *Chenglang*, *Yangbo*—four ships would form Naval First Fleet, heading to Hong Kong for training and standby.

The First Fleet Commander was planned to be concurrently held by Ming Qiu, with Li Di concurrently as fleet chief of staff. Except for *Chedian* with Senator Mengde as captain and *Yufeng* with Le Lin as captain, all other ship captains were naturalized citizens.

Ming Qiu nodded: "That's right. I'm planning to be like Feng Fu. One last battle." He said with deep emotion: "If I don't fight now, I'm afraid there won't be another chance in the future."

Chen Haiyang nodded: "Can your body handle it?"

"No major problems. *Lichun* is much larger than the 037 submarine chasers I had in the fast attack craft squadron—at least a ship of over a thousand tons."

The 037 submarine chaser's full load displacement was only 392 tons, with cramped and inconvenient living conditions. Chen Haiyang had served as gunnery officer on a 037 submarine chaser, so he had deep understanding of this.

"But this Operation Engine will be very long—from start to finish possibly lasting until next spring, with continuous sailing for most of a year. Kaohsiung and Jeju don't have good support bases. Please take care of your health."

"That's not a major issue." Ming Qiu frowned slightly. "I have other concerns." He sat up straight. "I really have no confidence in these steam ships. I've read some materials. The 854 and 901 probably can't support long-term ocean cruising, right? Back then, even our most modern destroyers had low operational availability—you remember those old 051s from the South Sea Fleet? Accumulating forty to fifty days underway per year was considered good."

Chen Haiyang thought the 051 was still considered a modern destroyer—he belonged to the younger generation of PLAN officers and had complaints about the obsolete and backward naval equipment of the 1990s.

However, what the sailing and endurance performance of this "Senate Navy's trump card"—steam-sail warships—actually was, Chen Haiyang himself had no idea either. He was an officer who had risen from the grassroots—besides the gunnery department, he had also worked in the power department. Even modern ship diesel engine power systems required considerable maintenance effort. The crude, coal-smoke-spewing steam engines looked unreliable at first glance.

"Setting up a temporary base in Kaohsiung is already in the plan." Chen Haiyang said. "The shipyard hasn't provided detailed data yet, but I estimate these ships' engine hours will be short. Before long, they'll need to enter port for maintenance."
