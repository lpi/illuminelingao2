# Chapter 1033: The Incident at the River Gate

His nearly one thousand men took off their marked vests, furled their war flags, and dispersed among several villages by the canal. As soon as the soldiers entered a village, they took control of it, allowing entry but no exit. Every night, squad leaders and company commanders led teams out in batches to pillage. Kong Youde did not allow them to go out sporadically, fearing they would be counterattacked and captured alive by local militia. Only after scouts were sent out daily to spy and identify wealthy households did they go out at night with blackened faces.

He didn't stay long in any place, inevitably moving every two or three days. Since his subordinates were all cavalry, their route choices were very free. Sometimes he would suddenly move the whole army dozens of *li* away from the canal, then turn back in another direction, making it impossible for people to figure out his movement patterns and camping locations.

Part of the looted wealth was handed over to the "supply depot," and part was distributed to the officers and soldiers according to rank. Within a few days in Dongguang, everyone's bags were full; the soldiers ate their fill and had some silver in their hands, so their courage grew. Some began to ignore Kong Youde's orders and went out in groups of three or five to rob and rape.

We can't stay here any longer, Kong Youde thought. If we stay too long, the soldiers will slack off, and besides, secrecy can't be maintained—it's impossible for there to be such large-scale "horse bandits" in Hebei. Staying longer would be impossible to cover up; the local officials are just pretending not to know, not truly ignorant.

If he really let his officers and soldiers continue making trouble, sooner or later the local officials wouldn't be able to cover it up. When trouble really broke out, let alone himself, even Sun Yuanhua might not have the ability to handle it.

Now they should almost immediately return to the main road and continue towards Shanhai Pass.

The night before, Kong Youde ordered the central army to invite all officers above the rank of squad leader to his quarters to announce the specific itinerary for the next step.

Unexpectedly, in the meeting, his order for the whole army to reinforce Shanhai Pass via the main road met with opposition from many subordinates: during these ten or so days of looting, the officers had made quite a fortune. This was extremely stimulating for the lower and middle-ranking officers who had long been stuck in Dengzhou with no extra income besides embezzled military pay.

They had suffered enough from the Shandong soldiers and Southern soldiers in Dengzhou and were already full of complaints. Now, having just gotten some benefits, they were to go to Liaodong again—many were unwilling to give up the chance to "continue getting rich," and even less willing to go to Liaodong to "die."

Kong Youde was very isolated in the meeting. Apart from a few of his confidants, most officers expressed unwillingness to go to Liaodong. Li Jiucheng, who had arrived not long ago, not only didn't help persuade them but frequently moved privately among the soldiers and lower-ranking officers, inciting them to "return to Dengzhou."

This caught Kong Youde off guard—he had originally hoped Li Jiucheng would help suppress the troops, but he hadn't expected him to undermine him secretly!

Because the generals reacted strongly, Kong Youde dared not order departure immediately. He had to stay another day locally—in a small village by the canal—preparing to convince everyone again at night.

This day, Kong Youde had just finished washing up and was thinking of having a good talk with Li Jiucheng and the others. Suddenly someone reported: a group of suspicious cavalry was active more than ten *li* away from here.

Because the work he was doing couldn't see the light of day, he sent out 24 patrolling cavalry scouts day and night, capable of detecting abnormal movements about 20 *li* away. Recent news indicated that unidentified reconnaissance cavalry were tailing his men. His scouts tried several times to capture them, but the other side tried their best to avoid conflict and could always spot his cavalry's movements first and evade. The appearance of these scouts was also one of the factors making him anxious to leave this place.

"How many people?"

"Just over twenty, all in plain clothes. With swords." The scout hesitated, "But they're riding good horses!"

"Are they martial artist types?"

"Doesn't look like it. The formation is strict and lines are orderly."

"You go rest first." Kong Youde was secretly worried. After dismissing the scout, he ordered people to notify the generals at various campsites to come to his place for a meeting at night, preparing to try convincing everyone one more time.

Chen Sigen, leading his squad, had now arrived at a place less than twenty *li* from Kong's unit. Upon hearing the news that Kong's scouts had discovered his tracks, he ordered the whole squad to turn back and quickly break away from the scout's detection range.

In a small grove, he posted sentries and then sent out reconnaissance cavalry to confirm the specific location and situation of several candidate targets.

More than twenty young team members were wearing cotton jackets and raw sheepskin coats commonly worn by local peddlers and farmers. Although the outdoor temperature was already down to zero degrees, they were all in high spirits.

"How is it, didn't freeze your balls off, did you?" Chen Sigen cracked a joke, and the team members all grinned, white mist spraying from their mouths and noses.

"Alright, we rest here for a while, and move out to do the job tonight!" Chen Sigen said, picking up a branch and drawing a simple diagram on the ground. "Our attack target tonight is a sluice gate by the South Canal. It's about twenty-five *li* from Dongguang County City."

He used branches and stones to mark, quickly explaining the topographic orientation. This location was carefully selected from over a dozen backup locations reported by the scouts. This attack location first had to be a place where boats on the canal moored overnight, usually a relatively prosperous riverside market or village. This was to ensure there were enough witnesses. Secondly, the location had to be not far from the village where Kong Youde's subordinates were staying overnight.

Although Kong Youde was careful to hide his tracks along the way, Chen Sigen knew from the scout reports that the local people already knew a group of soldiers was looting locally, only the people didn't know their origin yet—the county magistrate had already mobilized the local militia, and villages fortified their defenses.

However, this sluice gate had no defensive measures. Although it wasn't a tax collection station with stationed tax officials, it was still a small branch agency under the Water Transport Office.

The South Canal was in the north. To maintain the canal's water volume and cross watersheds, many sluice gates were built along the way to regulate the water volume.

These sluice gates were guarded and maintained by lock-keepers who opened the gates daily to release water and boats, so it was also an official institution—ordinary bandits and mutinous soldiers wouldn't dare strike here easily; after all, this was territory covered by officialdom.

Taking out this place would implicate not just Dongguang County, but the entire Water Transport Office. The severity was far greater than slaughtering a few villages. At that point, Kong Youde, who was nearby, would have no choice but to rebel.

Originally, Chen Sigen considered whether to blow up the sluice gate—he brought some C4 explosives. Blowing up the gate would obviously help intensify the chaos of the whole event, but Zhu Mingxia and Lu Wenyuan thought this was too far beyond Kong Youde's capabilities. Moreover, the motive would be hard to explain. Therefore, the attack was limited to economically valuable targets near the sluice gate.

The most valuable targets were the residences of several local lock-keepers: living off the water on the canal, the opening and closing of the gate concerned the time and convenience of boatmen's navigation. Since the officials managing the gate had power, they naturally sought rent, so every one of them was filthy rich. Chen Sigen prepared to start with them.

"The target, is everyone clear? First, the residences of several lock-keepers, second, the grain boats at the dock." He pointed out directions on the makeshift sand table. "You must remember, we are soldiers. Although we are doing dirty work underneath the table, we aren't bandits. In the operation, no killing innocents indiscriminately, no raping women, no arson at will, all loot goes to the public!"

"Understood!" The team members answered crisply.

Night fell. Kong Youde and his generals were in a meeting discussing the next move: most generals still insisted on returning to Dengzhou. Kong Youde failed to persuade everyone all along, and gradually the meeting tended to get out of control. Several generals even revealed an intention of "must do it," looking like they would fight Kong Youde right there if he didn't agree. Li Jiucheng constantly appeared as a mediator in the middle but was actually forcing him to make a decision.

Just when everyone was arguing until their mouths were dry and the atmosphere was becoming tense, suddenly a personal guard came to report: there was black smoke and firelight by the canal bank seven or eight *li* away, and faint sounds of killing could be heard. The soldiers and horses in the camp were becoming unsettled.

"What?" Kong Youde was startled and got up to look out the window—sure enough, there was firelight in the distance, reddening the horizon. He turned his head sharply to scan the generals: all his subordinate generals were present, so it shouldn't be his men.

However, only those above the rank of squad leader were present; it was hard to say if any team leaders or small bosses had taken men out privately to cause trouble.

The generals also found it baffling and looked at each other.

Kong Youde immediately ordered scouts to go see. In less time than it takes to eat a meal, the scouts galloped back, bringing terrible news: more than a hundred cavalrymen were burning, killing, and looting over by the sluice gate.

"Whose troops are they?" Kong Youde was extremely anxious. The sluice gate was official ground; making trouble there was a big deal. He turned his head and glared fiercely at Li Jiucheng, guessing in his heart that nine out of ten this was done under Li Jiucheng's instructions—this was forcing him to have to do it with them!

"Ruitu!" Li Jiucheng saw his unkind gaze and knew what he was thinking, afraid of causing a misunderstanding—after all, this troop was brought up by Kong Youde single-handedly; if they really fell out, he wouldn't benefit either. He immediately declared: "Everyone just wants to go back to Dengzhou, not go to Liaodong to die in vain, absolutely no other intentions! And definitely didn't do anything to let you down! We didn't do this! If I, Old Li, dare to speak half a word of lie, may heaven strike me with five thunderbolts immediately!"

"Reporting to the Assistant Regional Commander, we couldn't tell whose troops they were," said the scout. He only vaguely saw that they were all riding excellent Mongolian warhorses, wearing robes and sheepskin coats on the outside, but... it looked like they were wearing military vests underneath.

Most importantly, the weapons of this group of cavalry were very uniform, unlike the disorganized weapons of ordinary bandits, so they were definitely officers and soldiers from some battalion.
