# Chapter 1182 - The Journey to Hirado

Ping Qiusheng pressed on without pause, deciding to immediately visit Hirado and Nagasaki. First, to get a sense of Takeya's situation; second, to quickly find Japanese export goods; and if possible, to make a trip to Okayama to secure channels for the copper that Lingao urgently needed—Japan's copper-producing areas were mainly concentrated in this region. Otherwise, when Lingao's bulk goods arrived with nothing to trade for, it would be embarrassing. After receiving his telegram, Zhao Yingong had already replied: the Hangzhou Station was organizing cargo and ships on a large scale, preparing to ride the summer southeast monsoon to sail directly from Shanghai to Nagasaki.

Qiao Tianzhi would handle things at Fukue—though Elder Qiao's skill points were a bit lacking, with Master Zhou keeping things in order here, nothing major should go wrong. Ping Qiusheng's assignment for him was to lead the naturalized cadres and locally recruited laborers in continuing to repair the trading post and port, while also using his status as representative to make contact through Zhou Xingru with lower-level local officials and figures in the domain for socializing and negotiations.

Ping Qiusheng also specifically instructed Qiao Tianzhi that for now, he could have Master Zhou help purchase camellia oil throughout the Gotō Islands. Camellia oil—known as tsubaki oil—was a very common oil crop here in the Gotō Islands, with fairly abundant production. China also had this, but it was still an exportable oil—and Lingao's demand for oils was extremely strong, especially for industrial uses.

"There's another matter. Walk around among the Gotō Islands and inquire about whaling," Ping Qiusheng said. "The Gotō Islands were an important whaling port during the Edo period. You need to investigate roughly how many whales are caught each year, the fishermen's whaling methods, and their processing techniques."

The Gotō Islands' whaling industry had once flourished, and Fukue Domain had prospered for centuries thanks to this industry.

Whales—these not particularly tasty marine mammals—had extremely important roles in the early stages of industrialization. Their oil was a chemical industry raw material and machinery lubricant; their baleen was a natural elastic material. Elders had long been eyeing whales, but China's coast wasn't a whale habitat, so there had been no conditions for large-scale industrial whaling.

"Whale meat stew is really hard to eat," Qiao Tianzhi smacked his lips. "Whale meat is too oily..."

"Who's asking you to eat it? This is what Industry and Energy wants!" Ping Qiusheng said helplessly. "Camellia oil too, and whales too! Do some proper research. Oh, and make the fisheries survey as comprehensive as possible. The seafood here is also quite abundant. We can consider building a seafood processing plant later."

Lingao of course wasn't lacking in seafood, but for Japan's pitifully few export product categories, this counted as something better than nothing—at minimum it could supply the Senate's future operations on the mainland, and processed dried seafood could be exported to the Great Ming.

Five people were going to Hirado: Ping Qiusheng and his personal secretary Ping Ayako, two specialized security personnel from the newly established Elder Protection Squad of the Special Recon Team—Li Biao and Zhou Shiqun—plus an interpreter.

These two had both come through the connections of Zhou Shizhai, a Qiwei escort company armed escort. One was his disciple, the other his cousin. Zhou Shizhai had long provided close protection for Elders. Though he had never formally "naturalized," his reliability was very high. His temperament was quite stubborn—he didn't object to naturalization, but strongly resisted the requirement that all naturalized citizens shave their heads. Thus he remained an "externally hired" guest retainer to this day.

But he didn't hold his disciples and cousins to such high standards. Though escorts were quite insistent on traditional morality, they weren't inflexible old fogeys who couldn't read the times. When the Chiefs proposed recruiting some personnel for security work, he immediately recommended these two young men for the security training program.

As the governed territory expanded and more Elders were dispatched and traveled on business, personal security for Elders had been put on the agenda. Previously, Elders active in Lingao and Hainan's counties were covered by the Police Headquarters for those in Lingao, while those elsewhere had crack personnel drawn from local regular military units. This was rather scattered and unsystematic.

Moreover, Elders like Zhao Yingong who operated in Yellow and Red Zones had to rely on covert close protection. Previously, they had mostly depended on escort guards hired from Qiwei. While these people's professional ethics were fine and they had passed sufficient tests, they were after all external hires, lacking adequate modern security system training and political education. Using them had significant limitations.

So under Ran Yao's leadership, an Elder Protection Squad was added to the Special Recon Team Command, training protective personnel according to VIP security requirements. The specific training was handled by professional personnel from the Special Recon Team and Police Headquarters. Senior escorts from Qiwei were also brought in as instructors—traditional escort guards had rich social experience and coping skills that were very useful for Elders dispatched to enemy-occupied areas.

Li Biao and Zhou Shiqun were both quiet young men. For work requirements, neither had shaved their heads. The interpreter was recruited locally on Fukue Island through the Zhou family, also mixed Chinese-Japanese. This person was semi-literate, could speak good Nanjing Mandarin and Japanese, and often accompanied Great Ming ships visiting Hirado, Nagasaki, and other places. But he hadn't done very well for himself. Ping Qiusheng gave him a new name: Ping Kefu.

Ping Qiusheng and the bodyguards all carried pistols and daggers for self-defense. Chinese merchants were quite welcomed in Japan at the time. Under Tokugawa shogunate rule, things were generally peaceful, and traveling along main roads posed no danger. For safety's sake, they also carried authorization letters issued by Lingao. If anything really went wrong, they could try to escape via the Dutch trading post in Hirado—though they didn't think the Dutch were very reliable, nor did they expect this trip to be very dangerous.

The party traveled on a small boat—one of the many small vessels plying between Kyushu and the outlying islands in this timeline. Even fully loaded, its displacement was only seventy or eighty tons. The ship was packed with trade goods and also carried some commoners heading to Kyushu. This was a regular trading ship that the Zhou family ran between here and various places in Nagasaki, carrying mixed cargo and passengers. According to plan, after arrival the time-travelers would act freely. If things went smoothly, they would return to the Gotō Islands aboard the same ship; if they still needed to go to Okayama, they would have to find their own ship or wait for other trading ships from the Gotō Islands.

They set out before five in the morning. Though the weather was good, the wind-powered small boat would still take most of the day to reach Hirado.

The boat sailed north along the western coast of Fukue Island—this was Ping Qiusheng's deliberate arrangement. He wanted to observe Nakadōri Island's situation along the way. Nakadōri Island was at the northern end of the Gotō Islands, the second largest island after Fukue, and far from the Fukue Domain's center of power. In the old timeline, Nakadōri Island's Aogata Port had been the Gotō Islands' main port. Ping Qiusheng's real thinking was that the current Nintendo was only meant to serve as the time-travelers' commercial agency point here. They still needed a truly stable transit station that could guarantee the transshipment of bulk goods. After all, their shipping capacity was also very tight. Having a suitable cargo storage location right under Fukue Domain's nose was clearly not a wise or prudent approach. More importantly, once the upcoming Shimabara Rebellion broke out, if they wanted to absorb refugees or station troops, operating directly on Fukue Island would also be very difficult.

Around noon, the boat entered a stretch of water enclosed by several small islands.

"That over there is Aogata Harbor." Ping Qiusheng looked at the chart while pointing to a trumpet-shaped strait entrance about two li off the starboard side.

Li Biao and Zhou Shiqun were both Special Recon Team members; geography and terrain courses were mandatory content for them.

Zhou Shiqun said: "If the Chief wants to set up a port here, it'll require considerable construction work."

"I don't think it'll be a problem. This port has good natural conditions, and our initial requirements aren't high. The project can be completed in phases, and we won't need to accommodate very large ships in the short term." Li Biao was quite confident. He had "joined the dragon" very early, and compared to Zhou Shiqun felt much more natural around Elders.

"The name is quite nice. Let's make it a logistics base in the future." Elder Ping thought the island's name was wonderful.

"On the inner side of that peninsula ahead there's another fishing port, surrounded by excellent fishing grounds. I just don't know how developed it is now." Ping Kefu didn't know what was so "nice" about Nakadōri Island, but these past few days he had gotten a general sense of the Australians' preferences—they were very interested in natural resources. He eagerly introduced: "Would you like to stop by for a look, sir?"

"That won't be necessary. The terrain will be the same even now. We're on a schedule. A detour would take too long, and we'd have to turn back. We'll just cut east through the strait, and there's still a stretch to go. Let's try to reach Hirado before evening."

After turning through the strait, the boat's speed picked up considerably. Ping Qiusheng knew that less than thirty nautical miles to the front right was Nagasaki from the old timeline. He checked his watch—today was July 12th. On August 9th, 1945, an atomic bomb had fallen there. He was now so close to Nagasaki that he couldn't help sighing. He sighed not just because Nagasaki had earned the title of being one of only two cities in the world to be atomic-bombed, but also because of the technology from the old timeline. If Lingao's technological power in this timeline could still be understood by some people of this era, then many things from the old timeline wouldn't merely be shocking here—they would far exceed the comprehension and understanding of people at the time.

The setting sun with its afterglow and seabirds swooping low over the whitecaps—Hirado had arrived. Hirado was one of the larger islands among the Matsuura Islands, very close to Nagasaki. In the old timeline, it was part of Nagasaki City. But now it was ruled by a daimyō and was an East Asian international port whose foreign trade was no less impressive than Nagasaki's.

The island had many small bays, with foreign ships carrying cargo coming and going in these inlets. But the island itself was rugged and uneven. Several small rivers separated the hills; rice paddies were planted along the riverbanks, but harvests were pitifully small. The goods brought by ships entering port here made merchants rich while also keeping the islanders fed.
