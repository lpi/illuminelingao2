# Chapter 1024 The Dutch of Taiwan

"These wretched yellow-skinned monkeys—they only understand cannons and matchlocks! Only a good thrashing will teach them how to deal with people!" While thinking this, Putmans looked with some disgust at the workers expanding the new Fort Zeelandia—most were local Han immigrants. Labor shortage was always a headache for Taiwan's governor. Company personnel transported to the island, even including slaves and hired East Indies natives, never exceeded one thousand. And they were constantly attriting: some hospitalized, some dying. He had to hire Chinese to complete most civil engineering and cultivation work, at quite high labor costs, making Taiwan's already deficit finances even worse.

But on defense matters, he didn't dare be careless at all. The Company's trading post in Taiwan held hundreds of thousands of guilders in cash and goods. If anything went wrong, the Company would absolutely not forgive him—the directors in the Seven United Provinces were merciless toward those who harmed their profits. Pieter Nuyts's fate was a living example.

However, recently, things had improved somewhat in China trade. Zheng Zhilong—Liu Xiang's rise had once again softened his attitude—at least regarding trade cooperation, he wasn't as rigid as before. Last month, Zheng Zhilong's envoy had even brought him a letter, probing the possibility of Dutch support.

Putmans had received news that the Council had agreed to provide Liu Xiang covert support. Two old two-masted ships had been sold to Liu Xiang. The greater the pressure on Zheng Zhilong, the more cordial his attitude toward the Dutch would be. Of course, Putmans thought, if Liu Xiang became too powerful, it would also be quite disadvantageous to Taiwan. Pirates were always difficult to control.

However, now he had another troublesome matter. From natives coming to sell deerskins at Zeelandia, they learned that a fleet of "countless giant ships" had arrived at Dagou and was unloading cargo onto the shore, preparing to build houses.

Putmans was somewhat skeptical of this news: First, natives had poor numerical concepts—when quantities grew large, they couldn't count and could only use concepts like "many" or "countless." But for natives to say "countless," at least ten or twenty ships had arrived at Dagou, and all were "giant ships." Although natives weren't very civilized, they often saw small boats of a few dozen tons—they would never consider small Chinese coastal fishing boats as "giant ships."

To be called "giant ships," they had to be at least 200 tons. The ones who could mobilize so many ships at once in East Asian waters, besides Zheng Zhilong, were Liu Xiang, the Spanish, and the Australians.

Regardless of who the visitors were, their landing less than ten Dutch *mijlen* from Taiwan meant ill intentions. Putmans had already dispatched a reconnaissance ship to Dagou to investigate the detailed situation.

Actually, Putmans had some predictions about who the visitors were: Likely the Australians. A few months ago, an Australian two-masted fast ship had visited Dagou and killed several dozen Tagarayan people at the time. This was likely reconnaissance for this landing.

Australians, why have you become interested in this place? Don't you already have Hong Kong Island? Putmans thought secretly. If the Company could occupy such a fine large island at the Pearl River mouth, they would have been satisfied long ago, conducting large-scale trade at the Pearl River mouth. Why come to this barren island full of savages? Not to mention, the diseases here alone killed dozens of soldiers and sailors every year.

As a 17th-century merchant and soldier, Putmans couldn't understand Taiwan Island's important position in the new industrial system the Senate was establishing.

He gazed worriedly at the busy construction site—hopefully, the visitors weren't enemies harboring ill will toward Taiwan. His gaze shifted from the expanding Fort Zeelandia to the other side of the harbor, east of Taijiang. Currently there was only a crude fort. Although also rebuilt with brick and stone, it was very small—only accommodating fifty soldiers and a few cannons. If that fort could be rebuilt into a solid bastion fortress, the two fortifications could form a mutually supporting pattern. Adding the fortress on Beixianwei Island, Taiwan's entire security could be fully guaranteed.

Unfortunately, his current resources only sufficed for Fort Zeelandia's expansion. He could only be satisfied with slightly repairing other fortifications.

"Sir, the dispatch vessel *Bornstein* has returned." A servant came to report.

"Have the captain come to me immediately!"

The news brought by dispatch vessel *Bornstein* confirmed his speculation: The visitors were indeed Australians.

"The Australians have twenty-seven ships anchored at Dagou. All are two-masted ships." The captain reported. "The smallest ship is at least 150 lasts."

This included the black-smoke-belching fast ships reported by the Lingao consul. One ship's size left a deep impression on the captain. It was a large ship comparable in size to the largest Spanish galleons, but the hull was much more slender and beautiful. It had two masts and also belched black smoke. The captain believed this ship might be the Australian fleet's flagship, because it flew multiple different flags.

According to the captain's report, the Australians had already built a wooden jetty at Dagou Harbor and erected a three-story circular fortress beside the jetty. At the same time, approximately twelve wooden-structure buildings had already been erected on shore.

"Are you sure?" Putmans's eyes widened in surprise—from when he received news of the Australian landing until now was barely ten days, and the Australians had already built so many structures? Just building a wooden jetty was a major project. In Taiwan's early days, all personnel and cargo were transported ashore using small boats.

"Yes, sir. This is indeed what I saw with my own eyes."

"Very well. Did the Australians react to your arrival?"

"They only sent a small boat to inquire about my purpose," the captain reported. "I said I was on a voyage to carry trade goods to Lamey Island. They let me leave." He added, "The small boat they used had no sail or long oars, was very fast, and also constantly belched black smoke."

"You answered well." Putmans nodded. "Rest a while, then load some trade goods and go to Dagou again. I now appoint you as junior merchant aboard *Bornstein*. Your mission is to enter Dagou under the pretense of trade, make contact with the Australian fleet's highest officer, and try to ascertain their true intentions locally. Do you understand?"

"Yes, sir. I'll make arrangements immediately." The captain said, bowing and stepping back to leave. Putmans stopped him.

"Captain, do you believe in witchcraft?"

The captain's face instantly paled. Whether in Catholic or Protestant countries, believing in witchcraft was a fatal offense.

"I do not, sir. I only worship Almighty God."

"Good. What do you think those Australian black-smoke-belching, sail-less and oar-less boats are about?"

"I don't know, sir." The captain said. "Whether that's witchcraft or not, if necessary, I'll unhesitatingly fire upon them."

"Very good."

After the captain left, Putmans considered for a while, then summoned garrison commander Captain Heinrich Weidenfelder. This German veteran commanded approximately 400 VOC troops serving in Taiwan—a mixed force of Europeans, Acehnese from the East Indies, Blacks, and Japanese.

"I must now inform you that a battle may very likely break out here soon..." Putmans said. "How confident are you in defending Taiwan?"

"Sir, that depends on who the enemy is..." Captain Weidenfelder said properly. "If it's Chinese, whether Liu Xiang, Iquan, or the Great Ming's army, I'm confident I can handle them—one of my soldiers can fight twenty-five Chinese."

"I'm glad you're so confident. However, the opponent may be an enemy more formidable than the Spanish..."

"Then I need to strengthen defensive works and recruit everyone able to use weapons."

"Start gathering personnel on a small scale first—recruiting sailors will await my orders. I authorize you to immediately strengthen existing defenses. I know the fortifications are all being expanded and repaired. First use available materials to reinforce defenses at all positions. Double the night watch! I don't want to be caught off guard when the time comes."

"Yes, sir."

Watching the captain exit, Putmans thought of the inventory and cash in the warehouse and ships. He was somewhat worried about his 25,000 livres of goods. The Dutch East India Company treated its employees quite harshly. Even as a Council member and Formosa's governor, salary and benefits were very low. Without conducting some smuggling on the side to earn money, one could barely save anything.

The Dutch immediately became busy in Taiwan. Captain Weidenfelder ordered landmines buried on the beach while raising walls at Beixianwei Island and other simple fortifications with bamboo poles. Some cannons stored in warehouses were taken out to reinforce various batteries.

Soldiers dispatched to protect missionaries and merchants were recalled. Volunteers were recruited from the Japanese village near Taiwan. Some Sinkan natives were also assembled. A mixed squad of natives and Dutch set out overland toward Dagou, collecting intelligence along the way to see if there was possibility of the Australians attacking by land.

Under Putmans's orders, all ships anchored in the harbor made combat preparations. Three large ships moved to the south channel entrance, ready to intercept any enemy ships attempting to break into the harbor at any time. As for the north channel, the water was extremely shallow. Since Australian ships were large, they couldn't pass through. Plus there was already a fortress on Beixianwei Island with artillery sufficient to block the north channel.
