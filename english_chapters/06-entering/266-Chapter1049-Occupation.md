# Chapter 1049: Occupation

"Are official slaves not allowed to marry?" Feng Zongze asked deliberately.

"Marriage is allowed, but there are many difficulties. Most can't decide for themselves." Park Deok-hwan, seeing that this "Short-haired (*Kun*)" high official spoke gently and was concerned about him, felt warmth in his heart: they were lowly people, usually ordered around, and even official courtesans (*Gisaeng*) who were slightly favored by officials treated them like servants. He couldn't help but recount the history of his marriage preparation one by one, which unconsciously turned into his complaint: he told the past events of being exiled to the island alone with his younger brother in their youth and suffering all the hardships of the human world, shedding tears as he spoke. Suddenly he realized he had lost his composure—he hurriedly wiped his face with his sleeve.

"This lowly one has made My Lord laugh."

"So there were so many tortures. It's really not easy for you to live here alone with your younger brother." Feng Zongze nodded secretly; indeed, the human will to survive is very strong. A son of officials used to fine clothes and food, once falling into trouble, enduring humiliation to survive, biting his teeth and suffering all the way, surviving on this Jeju Island, and even raising his young brother to adulthood, could be considered a rare inspirational story. He praised a few words and then asked deliberately:

"Do you and your brother both know characters and can read books?"

"Yes, this lowly one and my younger brother both started learning in childhood, only my younger brother lost the chance to study at a young age and didn't have time to start writing properly. He only recognizes some characters. Since there are neither books nor brush and ink on this island, it's not easy to teach him."

"Oh, so you have studied in the past. You were either *Yangban* or Middle People (*Jungin*). Definitely not lowly Commoners (*Baekjeong*)."

Speaking of his past identity, Park Deok-hwan shed tears again: "This lowly one disgraced his ancestors; this lowly one was originally a son of Middle People." Speaking of this, it touched the sore spot in his heart. He couldn't bear it anymore and couldn't help lying on the ground wailing loudly.

Feng Zongze thought: this is exactly the effect needed. Such people originally sealed up their past due to despair. Now that he opened the seal, the pain gushing out was heart-wrenching.

Following that would inevitably be extreme hatred.

For revenge, they would even not hesitate to burn themselves.

Feng Zongze didn't speak, letting him cry bitter tears and vent to his heart's content.

That night, Feng Zongze had people give the brothers a bath, perform a full purification process, issue brand-new naturalized citizen uniforms, and take them to eat.

Subsequently, Feng Zongze instructed to detain them separately, giving them ample time to digest what he said.

He believed that once the flame of revenge was lit in their hearts, it would not be easily extinguished.

Early the next morning, as dawn broke. When the staff brought the Park brothers, whose heads had been shaved completely bald, to the Seongsan base and led them into Feng Zongze's big tent in the base, Feng Zongze already knew they had made up their minds to become collaborators.

"Very good." He nodded appreciatively: "Sit."

How *dared* the Park brothers sit? Feng Zongze said: "Since you are purified, you are our comrades. Comrade (*Tongzhi*), people with the same aspirations."

"Willing to be at My Lord's disposal!" Park Deok-hwan said loudly.

Subsequently, following the content in the "1631 New Edition Mass Propaganda Manual Korea Work Volume (Consultation Draft)" compiled by the Propaganda Department, he preached some basic concepts about the Transmigration Group to them. Then he inquired about the situation of Jeju City.

"About Jeju City, we've said everything we know." Park Deok-hwan was a bit embarrassed. Although he was very eager to work for the new master immediately to prove his sincerity, he was an official slave after all. He knew things on the surface, but mostly didn't know things too deep.

"It doesn't matter. Jeju is just something in our bag; we only need guides." Feng Zongze's eyes fixed on Park Deok-hwan.

Park Deok-hwan didn't hesitate: "This lowly one is willing to lead the way."

Park Deok-maeng was a bit uneasy; "Big Brother!"

"It doesn't matter." Park Deok-hwan comforted his brother, "We brothers are both willing to lead the way for My Lord! Through water and fire, we will absolutely not frown."

"Good." Feng Zongze slapped the table, "Follow me!"

He strode over and opened the tent door facing the sea.

Feng Zongze's tent was right by the seaside of Seongsan. At this time, the sky was already bright and the sun shone everywhere. On the sparkling sea surface at the foot of Seongsan, masts of over a dozen warships and H800s stood like a forest, gun muzzles gleaming.

The flapping Morning Star Flag, Navy Ensign, and Iron Fist Flag flew in the morning breeze. Dozens of medium and small motorized boats were ready to go, black smoke rolling. Every boat was filled with soldiers carrying live ammunition. Snow-bright bayonets flashed with dazzling light under the sun.

The Park brothers were stunned instantly, feeling dizzy and unable to help their legs going soft, kneeling on the ground. Park Deok-hwan trembled for a long while before saying: "This lowly one deserves death, having eyes but no pupils! Actually..." He suddenly realized he had spoken his inner thoughts, scared into silence.

"Actually thought we were Wokou, pirates, right?" Feng Zongze laughed loudly, pretending to be forthright. He was very proud in his heart: what is the aura of kingly dominance (*Wangba* / Rule by Might)? This is the aura of kingly dominance!

When American battleships and ships covered the sea surface of Okinawa, everyone who saw it had to admit that Americans were qualified to establish a "New World Order."

Strength is the best kingly dominance.

"Yes, this lowly one is dull..." Park Deok-hwan bowed his waist even lower.

"Let's go, we go to Jeju together."

"Yes, My Lord—Chief."

It took less than an hour to storm into Jeju City: fifty minutes of preparation, ten minutes of assault. The Public Security Army Japanese Company took the lead again, being the first to ascend the city and seize the gate under rifle fire support.

When Shikawa Shuji led his Battotai rushing into the city wall again with wild shouts, chopping down generals and breaking locks to open the city gate, all resistance inside Jeju City collapsed. Hundreds of Joseon soldiers were routed under the sweep of *tachi* and Southeast Asia Pattern rifles.

Judge Yi Dae-ha originally thought the enemy were Wokou and was still waiting for the Jeolla Province Navy to come for reinforcement. Moreover, there was news that the enemy was still lingering around Seongsan, not expecting the enemy to attack suddenly. He originally thought holding Jeju was no problem, but the "Wokou's" firearms were extremely fierce, routing the defenders on the wall in a few shots. After receiving the news that the city gate was seized and the enemy entered the city, he hurriedly led more than a hundred elite Tooth Soldiers (*A-byeong*) to support, preparing to charge the enemy out.

Yi Dae-ha's estimate was quite accurate: the enemy was not numerous, winning by bravery and sharp firearms. Now the opponent's charge scattered the ordinary soldiers with little combat power. As long as he could stabilize the formation in time and check the enemy's momentum, the routed soldiers could regroup, and the winner was yet unknown.

Wearing armor and carrying a bow, he didn't ride a horse, directly carrying a Ming army standard border army long saber (*Changdao*), leading the Tooth Soldiers straight to the city gate. Just turning the street corner, he saw head-on Shikawa brandishing a *tachi* rushing in front shouting "Banzai." He immediately drew his bow and nocked an arrow, shooting one out. The dozen Tooth Soldiers behind him also shot a round of arrows simultaneously.

Shikawa, rushing in front, screamed and fell to the ground. Screams and groans also erupted from the "Battotai" crowd around him; immediately three or four people were hit by arrows.

"Fire!"

Dense white smoke spewed from the Southeast Asia rifles in the crowd, and a dozen or so of Yi Dae-ha's Tooth Soldiers were also knocked down. The two sides then lunged together, engaging in a mêlée with sabers, *tachi*, and bayonets.

The hand-to-hand combat lasted less than five minutes before Yi Dae-ha's Tooth Soldiers couldn't hold out—hand-to-hand combat tested discipline and training very much. Joseon's Tooth Soldiers were obviously inferior to the Public Security Army in both, not to mention the disparity in equipment and physical strength between the two sides.

Yi Dae-ha was wounded in the mêlée, protected by Tooth Soldiers fighting and retreating. Because the Public Security Army lost a few men, they charged and killed like red-eyed demons. Before long, the Tooth Soldier team disbanded. All Tooth Soldiers around Yi Dae-ha died in battle, and he himself was shot dead by rifle bullets.

The death of Jeju's highest military commander declared the disintegration of the entire resistance. Soldiers dropped weapons and fled in all directions, fleeing towards various city gates in groups, attempting to escape the city. But ambushes were set up outside all city gates, especially snipers of the Special Reconnaissance Detachment, using sniping to intimidate fleeing soldiers and stop them from escaping.

Jeju Magistrate Yi Jin-gyeong, amid the panic, was protected by his Tooth Soldiers and servants to mount a horse, attempting to open the South Gate and flee. As a result, as soon as he exited the city gate, he was continuously picked off by snipers ambushing outside the city. The guards shielded him with their bodies attempting to rush out. Then a "typewriter" (machine gun) let out a ferocious roar, and Yi Jin-gyeong and all fifteen of his subordinates were killed.

Although battles and small-scale chaos occurred inside Jeju City, they didn't last too long. The Public Security Army and Army soldiers soon controlled the entire city.

On January 12, 1632, Jeju City was declared fallen. Since then, all three cities of Jeju had fallen into the hands of the Jeju Island Special Task Force.

The commoners of Jeju City hid in their respective small huts with fear, trembling and waiting for disaster to strike: many of them had witnessed or heard from elders about the ferocity of Wokou. Now seeing a group of bald-headed Wokou brandishing big swords charging in and routing the government troops, everyone could only resign themselves to fate.

Rounding up routed soldiers, confiscating weapons, taking over warehouses and government offices, clearing corpses, treating the wounded... Entry work proceeded methodically under the management of naturalized citizen cadres who were trained and acted strictly according to the "City Entry Manual."

Feng Zongze and Xue Ziliang entered the Jeju Government Office together—this had already been selected as the headquarters of the Jeju Forward Command. In the Government Office compound, a temporary flagpole had been erected, and the Morning Star Flag rose slowly. The two stood at attention and saluted together.

"Jeju Island is ours," Feng Zongze said.

Although up to this day, they only controlled three cities and the Seongsan base, because the administrative centers on the island had been uprooted, the Joseon Dynasty's rule on the island had been declared over.

As for the several "Garrisons" not yet uprooted, because they lost command and supply bases, they had actually lost their original function and were ripe fruits that could be picked at any time.
