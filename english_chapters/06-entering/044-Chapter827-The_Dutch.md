# Chapter 827: The Dutch

The envoy was stunned, probably not expecting the Governor to suddenly ask about the Australians.

"They are a group of people from overseas! They claim to be descendants of the Great Song," the envoy said, probably realizing that saying "Great Song" to a foreign devil was like playing the lute to a cow, and corrected himself, "That is to say, they claim to be descendants of Chinese people."

This point was no different from Li Siya's report. The Governor nodded secretly and asked a few other things about the Australians. The envoy seemed very willing to answer his questions and said a lot about the Australians—of course, mostly rumors. Although Old Liu Xiang had fought a battle with the Australians, he had never had formal contact with this opponent. Most of the news was hearsay; some came from people who were captured during the attack on Bopu and later released, and another part came from reports by his spies.

Although Old Liu Xiang had withdrawn from the Pearl River Estuary due to pressure from Zheng Zhilong before the second counter-encirclement campaign, avoiding direct conflict with the Transmigration Group, he had planted many spies in the area. He knew all the news about the Transmigration Group defeating He Rubin, shelling the Bogue forts, and pressing directly on Guangzhou city. Although the Australians hiding in the remote backwaters had strong ships and sharp cannons in the past, their sudden eruption of such combat power was something he had not anticipated.

Fortunately, the Australians did not seem to intend to be his enemy. Their seizure of the Pearl River Estuary certainly annoyed him, but now he dared not fight on two fronts under any circumstances. He had to deal with Zheng Zhilong first.

The Governor listened very seriously and carefully to the envoy's chatter without interrupting him. Only when the other party stopped did he ask a few questions. Gathering intelligence on the Australians was his main interest now. The fact that Liu Xiang had conflicted with the Australians was something he had not expected. And the fact that the Chinese government had actually dispatched a large army to punish Lingao but was defeated by the Australians interested him even more.

Although the Dutch had a very low opinion of the Ming army's combat level, every military operation on the Chinese coast had been defeated by the deterrence of the Ming army's seemingly endless manpower and resources. As fellow outsiders, the fact that the Australians occupying a corner of the Ming Empire could withstand the tide-like army that had once terrified the Company and successfully partitioned a piece of Chinese land made De Carpentier feel a strong interest in this.

The news revealed by a war was more than all intelligence reports combined. De Carpentier had heard many rumors about the Australians' amazing level of firearms, and the two victories the Australians had won seemed to explain a lot of problems.

Clearly, the Australians were a potent force. He rang a bell and summoned the attendant outside.

"Take this gentleman down to rest," he said.

That night, at the dinner for the Governor and the senior merchants of Batavia, a discussion was held on how to treat the Australians, whether to aid Old Liu Xiang, and how to deal with Zheng Zhilong.

The East India Company's military strength in Batavia was very weak. When the expedition against China was launched a few years ago, only seven ships were sent. When going to conquer Macau, there were only fourteen ships. The total number of army troops was considerable, but these companies were scattered among dozens of trade posts throughout Java, spanning thousands of kilometers for the East India Company. Soldiers recruited from Europe thousands of miles away died constantly like flies in the hot and humid climate and unhygienic environment. Now, replenishing the vacancies in the companies at various strongholds seemed difficult to the Governor; he lacked the strength to launch another large-scale expedition.

As for the auxiliary troops composed of a small number of local natives, no one held much hope for their combat effectiveness. It was even hard to say whether these natives were trustworthy.

Participating in military conflicts in the South China Sea with limited military power was beyond the Dutch's ability, not to mention that Zheng Zhilong still held the lifeline of the East India Company's trade with China. Therefore, the merchants believed that the Governor's decision to refuse to send ships to participate directly in the battle was correct. As for whether to aid Liu Xiang with ships and cannons, there was some debate among the senior merchants. Some believed that cannons were manageable, after all, European-style cannons had spread quite widely throughout East Asia. But pirates using European-style ships were still a tiny minority. Suddenly adding two European ships to Old Liu Xiang's fleet would seriously provoke Zheng Zhilong and might cause adverse effects for the Company.

Several other senior merchants supported selling the ships to Old Liu Xiang to check Zheng Zhilong's power. The Governor was inclined towards this side.

"Gentlemen, the issue of ships is not a problem," the Governor said, tapping lightly on the table. "In the entire East Asian region, we are not the only ones who can provide ships. The Xibanks, whether in Manila or the Xibanks in Macau, have the ability to strengthen Old Liu Xiang with ships. Do not forget, in the several conflicts between Liu and Zheng in the previous stage, a Spanish galleon participated directly in the battle. Even if Iquan suspects, the biggest suspects are the Xibanks. We can completely deny all this. Besides, do you think Zheng Zhilong would fall out with us before deciding the victor with Old Liu Xiang?"

Furthermore, selling two waste ships that would likely only be scrapped for firewood and ship timber was profitable for the Company. After all, Old Liu Xiang was willing to pay cash. As for the sailor problem, he could recruit them himself—whether in Batavia, Manila, or Macau, one could recruit scum of various nationalities willing to sail and fight for money.

Everyone finally agreed to the proposal to sell the *Alert* and the *Ardent* to Old Liu Xiang. Including all weapons and navigation equipment on the two ships. The *Ardent* for 10,000 Spanish Reals, and the *Alert* for 7,000 Spanish Reals. In addition, they would sell 10 bronze 12-pounder naval guns and 24 iron 6-pounder and 12-pounder naval guns to Old Liu Xiang. And 400 matchlocks.

"Your Excellency, do you think it is possible for Old Liu Xiang to defeat Iquan?" a merchant asked.

"It's hard to say." De Carpentier shook his head. "It is said that the strength of both sides is about the same. But Iquan is obviously more dominant—he has the support of the Chinese court. And Iquan has already defeated all opponents on the Fujian seas, including those who were once very powerful."

In the Governor's view: if Old Liu Xiang could not win continuously or kill Zheng Zhilong himself in a certain battle, eventually Old Liu Xiang would fail.

A sigh of regret rang around the dining table. Old Liu Xiang could not be called an ally, but with him around, Zheng Zhilong's attitude could be somewhat looser. Once Old Liu Xiang fell, there would be no force capable of containing Zheng Zhilong.

"Gentlemen, even without Old Liu Xiang, there are others in this world." De Carpentier spoke his thoughts. "Have you ever heard of the Australians?"

The Governor sat in an armchair. From the long window next to his desk, he could see the city of Batavia. This city had been under construction since 1619, constantly expanding and strengthening over more than a decade, and now began to take shape. De Carpentier had no doubt that the Governor sitting in this position in the future would see a more prosperous and great Batavia.

A knock sounded outside.

"Come in."

His secretary appeared at the door.

"Your Excellency, the Junior Merchant Van der Lanthroon you summoned has arrived."

"Show him in."

Van der Lanthroon walked in carefully from the main door. He was probably in his early thirties, with a reserved face. This man was a nobleman from Zeeland, had served in the navy, and fought in wars. Now he was a Junior Merchant in the East India Company. However, even a Junior Merchant was ranked above other general company employees. On East India Company ships, only the Merchant had the highest command authority. In many trading posts, the Merchant possessed all power.

But as a Junior Merchant, Van der Lanthroon's authority had never exceeded a single merchant ship. He desperately hoped to become a Merchant for a fleet or a certain trading post. The Dutch East India Company was a company that treated its employees very harshly; although the dividends given to shareholders by the East India Company every year could reach thousands of guilders per share, the remuneration given to employees was meager. A Junior Merchant only had a monthly salary of twenty guilders and a food allowance equivalent to a quarter of the salary. Serving the Dutch East India Company law-abidingly was no way to get rich. Climbing to a high position as much as possible and using the power in hand to smuggle was their only chance to get rich in the Far East.

Van der Lanthroon took off his hat and bowed deeply to the Governor.

"Mr. Van der Lanthroon," De Carpentier said briefly, "I now appoint you as the Merchant on the *Magdeburg*."

The *Magdeburg* was a "yacht"—in fact, this type of ship was neither "fast" nor a "yacht." It was a flat-bottomed ship often used by the Dutch in the East Indies, with a load of 400-600 tons, a rounded stern, and a towering poop deck. The ship sailed very slowly and was mainly used as a merchant ship and transport vessel. But because the construction period was short, it carried a lot of cargo, and required few sailors, it met the needs of the "Sea Coachmen."

Although Van der Lanthroon was not promoted to a senior position, the *Magdeburg* was a large ship, much more important than the two-masted small boat he was currently on. So this order still made him very happy.

"Thank you, Your Excellency!"

"No need to thank me, thank our masters." The Governor said, "Prepare immediately after you get on the ship. I want you to prepare to go to Lingao immediately to trade with the Australians."

"Lingao?" Van der Lanthroon had never heard of this place. He knew of the Australians.

"Yes. I will send someone to navigate for you. Your mission is to trade with the Australians in Lingao and ask for as much news about them as possible. If possible, find out if they are willing to reach a trade agreement with us."

"at your orders, Your Excellency."

"I will send you a few assistants. Keep them by your side after arriving in Lingao and provide them with all conveniences."

One of those sent to the *Magdeburg* was Gonzalez himself. The Governor hoped that he would see Lingao's military strength and the fortification status of the wharf with his own eyes as an officer. The other was Leibtrini, an Italian, a professional cartographer. His task was to try to map Lingao's port and terrain. At the same time, he was to draw what he saw into an album. In the era without cameras, this was the only way for people far away to get a visual impression.
