# Chapter 825: Li Siya's Report

Governor de Carpentier could hardly believe that such a large ship existed in this world, let alone one made of iron—not to mention where one could manufacture so much steel, the more important rumor was that this ship required no sails and could navigate on its own. In his view, if such a thing truly existed, it was either a miracle of God or, more likely, a trick of the Devil.

Although rumors were spreading everywhere, the Governor remained skeptical. If the Australians truly possessed such overwhelming maritime superiority, why would they stay on a desolate island on the coast of South China? They could simply sail their great iron ship to settle in other, more prosperous and resource-rich places.

But he was more interested in the so-called "Australian goods"—did they come from "Australia" or were they manufactured in Lingao? The Dutch East India Company's library contained no records of "Australia." As for "Lingao," they only knew it as a commercially worthless small city—there were hundreds, if not thousands, of such small cities in China. The Governor could not imagine that such a small city could suddenly manufacture so many novel and high-quality goods.

The Australians of Lingao presented too many unsolved mysteries, which was the main reason he had eagerly spent a large sum of money to hire Li Siya to gather intelligence. The "shopkeepers" never spent money recklessly. Four thousand guilders might be a lot, but it was nothing compared to understanding the future trend of the maritime situation in Southeast Asia and the entire East Asia.

Only by mastering enough intelligence could the Batavia authorities formulate an appropriate policy towards Australia. Should they be a trading partner, or should they launch a ruthless attack to completely destroy this new force? Or should they adopt some other means to utilize or contain the Australians' presence in the South China Sea?

The Dutch East India Company was the world's first "true capitalist enterprise." Its capitalism was thorough and ruthless, built on the most naked commercial monopolies and excess profits. The Company was equally ruthless to its partners, friends, employees, and enemies. It was a thorough supremacist of interest. Even among the Company's senior employees, the Dutch East India Company was the power that most successfully applied the law of the jungle in the East Indies.

For the Governor, the Australians were neither enemies nor friends. The role the Australians would play depended on their strength and their position in the entire East Asian trade system.

If the Australians were weak and unable to shake the Company's monopoly, then they could serve as a suitable trading partner, providing Far Eastern goods just like the Ming Empire; if they were strong and posed a threat to the East India Company's monopoly, containing the Australians would become a primary task. Just as they spared no effort to contain and squeeze out the English in the East Indies, strike at the Portuguese in Japan, and suppress Zheng Zhilong on the coast of China—the East India Company did not like competition.

"You may go and rest now." The Governor took a check from his drawer. "Go to the treasurer to collect your money. You can have a good rest for a few days."

"Thank you, Your Excellency." Gonzalez bowed, took the check, and withdrew.

The next day, the Governor carefully read the German version of Li Siya's answers to the 125 questions. She had answered all the questions raised by the Council; even for those she answered "unknown," she provided some speculations, rumors, and her personal evaluation. The Governor felt that Li Siya's performance was worthy of the remuneration she demanded.

First, Li Siya clearly answered the question of who the Australians were.

The Australians were Chinese—this could be confirmed from their language, script, and national identity. However, although they considered themselves "Chinese," they were vastly different from the Chinese—possessing completely different culture, institutions, and etiquette. Li Siya stated in the report: *Their differences from the Chinese are as great as the differences between Europeans and Chinese—perhaps even greater.* In addition, there were people of European descent among the Australians. At least two or three. According to intelligence, these Europeans also enjoyed the status of so-called "Senators."

The "Senators" in Lingao numbered between five and six hundred. Among the Senators, a European-style "Council" system was practiced. Nine supreme councilors held all the power. But formally, all Senators enjoyed equal political power, forming an institution called the "Senate." Theoretically, all major policies had to be decided by a majority of the Senate.

Li Siya stated in the report: *They seem to practice a joint-stock partnership relationship, because Senators often utter words like 'shares' and 'dividends' in their conversations. Disputes over the so-called powers of the Senators also occur from time to time.*

"Is this the Australian East India Company?" Seeing this, the Governor could not help but remark.

Most of the goods used by the Australians for trade were manufactured in Lingao. Li Siya used exaggerated length to detail the powerful manufacturing industry the Australians possessed in Lingao—in fact, neither Li Huamei's nor Randou's reports gave much description of Lingao's productivity. Li Huamei generally could not enter Lingao's core areas, and the report Randou gave her had been specially modified by the External Intelligence Bureau; the Bureau did not want outsiders to truly understand Lingao's productivity levels. But Li Siya, bent on inciting a Dutch war against Lingao, added exaggerated embellishments based on these two reports. She described Lingao as a place of extreme material abundance and rendered the productivity of the Australian workshops with flamboyance. Finally, she spent four full pages describing the luxurious lives of the Australian Senators in Lingao: from facts to rumors, described vividly. The main highlights were their luxurious toilets and bathrooms.

She believed that this rich booty was enough to incite the powerful greed of the Dutch, thereby triggering the Dutch to move against the Australians. Of course, the Dutch were by no means a match for the Australians. A war that consumed both sides would be of great benefit to her.

Sure enough, this long passage of flowery text made the Governor's eyes shine. His ring-adorned fingers drummed on the armrest. But after a while, the Governor calmed down; after all, he was a rational Dutchman. He would not be easily moved by bombastic Latin-style rhetoric. In his view, this was just like when the Spaniards touted that America was full of gold and silver: there was truth to it, but they omitted the hardships required to obtain that gold and silver.

The Australians in Lingao were certainly very wealthy, but the fact that they could occupy a city under the rule of the Ming Dynasty, which had a very rigid attitude towards foreign relations, showed that the Australians' strength was no small matter. The East India Company had launched expeditions against China several times in the past, but none had achieved the desired results.

Regarding the Australians' strength, the report stated that besides the Senators, there were local Chinese gathered by the Australians in Guangdong as well as indigenous people in Lingao who engaged themselves to them. The total population was unclear, estimated between fifty and one hundred thousand. These people served as servants, soldiers, serfs, and craftsmen for the Australians.

The exact number of troops the Australians possessed was unknown, but there were at least three to four companies of well-trained infantry—composed entirely of indigenous Chinese except for a few officers. The infantry underwent European-style training and were well-equipped; their firearms were lighter than those used by European armies and possessed immense power—surpassing all European light firearms. Li Siya specifically described the Minié rifle and the Derringer pistol. The Australians also had artillery, which was equally excellent, but small in quantity. Li Siya gave a detailed description of the coastal heavy artillery at Bopu—and even drew the specific locations, terrain, and fields of fire of the coastal batteries. This greatly surprised the Governor: Li Siya was indeed an extraordinary woman! He began to value her even more.

In terms of maritime power, which the Governor was most concerned about, they had about one hundred ships, all of which were "junks" gathered locally in Guangdong. Except for a few, their tonnage was not large. They also possessed several European-style ships. Additionally, there were four iron fast ships brought from Australia.

Li Siya laid an ambush here. She knew very well the power of the "iron fast ships" possessed by the Australians from Li Huamei and Randou, but she was vague in her description—only stating their existence, not how powerful they actually were. She did not want the Dutch to feel that the Australians were very strong at sea—once the Dutch feared Lingao's maritime power, they would not easily launch a military attack on the Australians.

Finishing the report took the Governor the entire morning. Through this report, he gained a sufficient understanding of the Australians. Clearly, the Australians were a potent force, only they did not yet have the ability to meddle in long-distance maritime trade routes. This was a great opportunity for the Company. It seemed necessary to open a trade route between Tayouan and Lingao as soon as possible.

He opened the map on the table and carefully examined Lingao, which had just been marked out not long ago, measuring it with a ruler. He found that Lingao's location was not remote in terms of Southeast Asian trade routes. It should be a decent trade port.

De Carpentier was pondering when a knock sounded at the door.

"Come in!" He looked up as his attendant entered.

"What is it?"

"The representative of Liu Xiang from Guangdong is here. Will you see him?"

"Of course." De Carpentier nodded. "Show him in."

Liu Xiang had a certain level of cooperation with the Dutch—of course, this cooperation was brought about by Liu Xiang's strength. After the Liu Xiang Gang suddenly rose on the coast of Guangdong at the end of the Tianqi era, they quickly controlled the waters near the Pearl River Estuary and were once the overlords of the Guangdong seas. In their expansion towards the Fujian seas, they gradually came into conflict with Zheng Zhilong; and the Dutch also needed a force that could contain the constantly growing power of Zheng Iquan. The two sides hit it off immediately.
