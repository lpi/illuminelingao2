# Chapter 844: The Role of Hong Kong

Gonzalez looked at Van der Lanthroon, lying on the bed, dead drunk and snoring loudly. He couldn't help but frown. The room reeked strongly of alcohol fumes, making it impossible to sleep.

"No tolerance for alcohol but still insists on drinking too much." Gonzalez stroked his little mustache. He had also drunk quite a bit. In that godforsaken place of Batavia, alcohol was scarce, poor quality, and expensive. The most popular beverage was the beer the Dutch frequently drank. This stuff was completely unappealing to Southern Europeans accustomed to wine, who called it "piss."

At the reception, rum was served, along with fruit wines brewed at the demonstration farm by Xue Ziliang and several other alcohol enthusiasts. Although Lingao couldn't grow grapes specifically for winemaking, the farms and communes promoted "ten-edge" planting and courtyard economy, so quite a lot of fruit was grown. Besides supplying the army, students, and workers, the excess was mostly used for wine-making. When Xue Ziliang was in America, home brewing was a hobby, and he even had specialized small fermentation equipment at home, so he was very familiar with the process.

The fruit wines produced by these small-scale brewing workshops were varied in type but small in quantity, basically used by Senators and at banquets. A few were sold at shops as special provisions to the upper echelons among the naturalized citizens.

Gonzalez of course didn't give up this rare opportunity to drink heartily—Spanish soldiers were second to none when it came to drinking. He successively finished off several bottles of apple wine, jackfruit wine, and wild fruit wine, then drank a lot of rum in one go, still looking unchanged as he went to chat up Miss Mendoza, who served as interpreter—he hadn't seen a "woman from the homeland" for a long time. Although this charming woman spoke Spanish with many words he didn't understand and had an accent, Gonzalez guessed she must be a Creole from the American colonies. He immediately became very warm and courted her enthusiastically. Although he could tell she was also quite fond of him, whenever he got too close, she would avoid him. This puzzled Gonzalez greatly.

Although Miss Mendoza felt close to seeing a European who also spoke Spanish, the smell emanating from this Spanish soldier was nauseating. Actually, Gonzalez's hygiene habits were better than most of his contemporaries—serving in a place like Batavia, one couldn't survive without frequent bathing. After arriving in Lingao and checking into the sailors' lodge, he had also been forced to bathe.

After the reception ended, he and Leibtrini returned to their lodging room—although the trading house could provide single rooms, Van der Lanthroon, fearing he would spend too much of the Company's funds, insisted on staying in a triple room. By 17th-century inn standards, this triple room could be considered luxurious and comfortable. But with this drunkard in the room, the place became somewhat unbearable. The Italian was also having trouble tolerating the smell emanating from this Dutchman.

"How about we go outside for another drink?" Gonzalez asked in Italian. As a soldier of the King of Spain, he had served in Italy, and many of his comrades-in-arms were also Italians.

"Of course. I'd be very happy to." Leibtrini's task was to draw; going around and seeing things was part of his mission. He thought for a moment. "But we don't have an interpreter."

"We don't need an interpreter." Gonzalez took out a Real coin. "This is the interpreter."

"What if we get lost?"

"They'll find us and bring us back." Gonzalez said carelessly. "Don't you want to find a woman?"

"The Dutch seem even happier about the results of this negotiation than we are." After the reception ended, a group from the Department of Colonization and Trade gathered in the conference room of the office building. Hong Shuiyin, the Commercial Representative stationed in Hong Kong who had been temporarily recalled for the negotiations, spoke. He had been recalled because Xu Tianqi, who had the best German among the Senators, had already gone to the mainland, and he was the only one left who could communicate fluently in German.

"Of course. The Dutch have been played miserably by Zheng Zhilong. Now that they've finally met honest people like us, how could they not be happy?" Skaed was very pleased. The trade agreement signed with the Dutch East India Company a few days ago had been approved by the Senate after three readings. Although everyone didn't particularly like the Dutch, this agreement was really too advantageous for the Lingao regime.

"I still propose listing Hong Kong as an entrepôt port." Hong Shuiyin made his proposal again.

The large quantities of Ming commodities the Dutch needed were currently mainly traded through Zhangzhou Bay, meaning goods were mainly shipped from Fujian. This trade channel was currently controlled by Zheng Zhilong. It wasn't that the Dutch didn't want to trade in Guangdong; Guangdong trade was mainly monopolized by the Portuguese. Actually, in terms of convenience of supply, Guangdong as a source of export products was better than Fujian.

The mainland commodities sold to the Dutch, including raw silk, silk goods, sundries, medicinal materials, etc., could actually all be traded directly with the Dutch at the Hong Kong station, eliminating an intermediate transshipment and storage step. This could free up the transport capacity between the mainland and Lingao that was originally used to load mainland commodities for Dutch trade. And the spices the Dutch were desperately trying to sell could also be traded in Hong Kong—the Hong Kong station could buy them and sell locally or hand them to the Guangzhou station to sell, earning the price difference.

Through trade with the Dutch, Hong Kong could become an entrepôt port just like in the old time-space, expanding Hong Kong's influence as a trading port on the mainland and building momentum for the Empire to control the Chinese merchant trade route to Batavia.

"Additionally, we can also use the Dutch's empty cargo space. We currently specify half the freight capacity. Suppose the Dutch ships carry half rice and half spices. After their ships unload rice at Lingao, they still have to go to Hong Kong to unload spices. We can completely use the half of the hold that's already empty, entrusting the Dutch ships to transport goods we need to transship to Hong Kong and Guangzhou."

This proposal very much appealed to Skaed—after all, the biggest headache for the Department of Colonization and Trade right now was the problem of insufficient transport capacity. Now they could not only save transport capacity but also use the Dutch's transport capacity. Hong Shuiyin's suggestion was attractive enough.

Skaed nodded repeatedly: "Mm, this idea is very good."

"Actually, there's no rush to open Sanya." Hong Shuiyin said. "Except for slaves, most of the goods the Dutch bring there can't be absorbed locally and have to be shipped back to Lingao or Hong Kong by ourselves. And the goods sold to the Dutch from the Sanya side are also mainly transported from Lingao. It's like adding an extra step for nothing."

Skaed was moved by his words. Building Sanya into an international trading port was in the Senate's plan. Now that international merchants had come, rejecting it seemed inappropriate. He thought about it and decided that since Sanya's planning was "long-term" anyway, focusing energy on Hong Kong now wasn't a big problem.

"But Hong Kong is still under construction right now. If we really open it, can you handle it there?"

"The Dutch won't send ships right away. I think it'll be at least the second half of the year before they send the first batch of ships. By the second half of the year, our basic construction will be mostly done, and the Guangzhou station's work will have resumed. At most, the Dutch will send 2-3 ships. We can handle it."

Skaed nodded. He thought about it—if so, he would need to discuss with Ji An, the Customs Director, about establishing a new customs office in Hong Kong and doing clearance directly there to simplify procedures.

"This way you can really spread your wings." He said.

"Yes, otherwise what am I, the Commercial Representative, doing in Hong Kong?" Hong Shuiyin said without disguise. "Hong Kong's development potential is still a bit limited. But it's not bad as Guangzhou's outer port."

Therefore, in the final trade agreement draft, Hong Kong was added to the list of open trading ports.

However, among the open ports, stationing a consul was limited to Lingao only. And who to send to Batavia as consul became a new problem.

Hong Shuiyin firmly refused this opportunity—despite being the Senator with the best German. But he didn't want to go, so he claimed that people who knew Spanish or other languages could also go to Batavia for this work. Hadn't they seen that the Dutch entourage included Spaniards and Italians?

The Senate was hesitant about sending a Senator to serve as consul in Dutch territory. Because there were few Senators, and each Senator's knowledge and skills were precious, it was unclear what returns there would be from placing a Senator thousands of kilometers away in potential enemy territory. The Senator sent couldn't be of low caliber either; he had to know a foreign language that could communicate with the Dutch, have considerable negotiating ability, and be in good physical health. If anything went wrong, the Senate would be completely unable to help.

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau was most interested in sending a consul—this was an opportunity to openly dispatch intelligence personnel. But the risks were even greater than dispatching to the Ming, and Batavia was currently not a main strategic target, so the Intelligence Bureau also didn't show too much enthusiasm.

But not sending a consul seemed like a loss. After all, the other party could station a consul in Lingao, and sending a consul could also spread Australian influence among the Chinese in Batavia. After some discussion, Wang Yan from the Foreign Intelligence Bureau proposed a compromise: send a consul to Taiwan's Tayouan.

Compared to Batavia, the Taiwan strategy was a matter of the next few years. An intelligence officer in Tayouan would be much more useful than in Batavia, and if anything happened, the distance from Hainan to Taiwan was much closer.

"But this doesn't make sense." At the meeting, Skaed raised an objection. "Our trade agreement was signed with the Batavia authorities. Unless they transfer the jurisdiction over trade with us to the Tayouan Council, it would be hard for us to propose stationing a consul permanently at an unrelated port."
