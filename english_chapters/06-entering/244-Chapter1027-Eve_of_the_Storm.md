# Chapter 1027 Eve of the Storm

Lin Baiguang had read the entire wargame simulation and artillery destructive power test reports. Like someone holding a great hand of cards, he didn't mind the opponent's few minutes of stalling.

The Zheng family's delay was merely trying to win back some points and gain more advantages in the upcoming salt negotiations.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help humming contentedly: "...I was originally a carefree person on Wolong Ridge..."

In another dimension, a county leader where Lin Baiguang worked loved Peking opera, so Lin Baiguang had learned a few passages to accompany the leader—he sang reasonably well.

After three or four days, Lin Baiguang was finally invited to "talk specifics."

Commercial cooperation progressed smoothly once both parties had intent. The two sides conducted a series of negotiations on price, payment method, and ship sailing safety.

On supply price, Lin Baiguang was relatively flexible—the Senate's salt costs were very low, so quoting slightly lower was no big deal. But on payment, he refused the method of year-round supply with settlement at the three festivals.

"This won't do." Lin Baiguang shook his head. "Setting aside other things—Zheng family's Anhai ships go to Japan, but do they collect payment the following year? Japanese local merchants pay on the spot."

You collect cash from the Japanese; naturally I must also collect cash from you. Lin Baiguang wouldn't yield an inch on this.

The Japanese were willing to pay cash because goods carried by Chinese merchants were all sought-after. And the contraband salt he controlled was also sought-after in Fujian.

However, he did make a small concession: The Zheng family could pay half the salt price with Fujian local products—indigo, medicinal herbs, timber, porcelain, and tea. These goods could either be used for foreign trade or directly by the Senate, and were quite useful commodities comparable to silver.

Both sides quickly reached an agreement. Senate ships flying Great Wave Shipping flags and Morning Star flags could enter Weizhou Bay, limited to three ships per visit and fifteen ships maximum per month. Ship size didn't matter. As for cargo brought, besides each ship requiring half the hold space for salt, other cargo was unrestricted. Zheng Hongkui indicated they also had great demand for grain. If the Senate was willing to transport and sell it, they would offer good prices—Fujian at the time was also a grain-deficient province. Lin Baiguang immediately said he would "consider it."

Senate ships entering Weizhou Bay had to follow rules: block cannon touch-holes, centralize and seal powder magazines and weapons, fly Zheng family pennants, and so on—these were conventions of the time, not humiliating, and Lin Baiguang agreed to all.

As long as ships could continuously enter Weizhou Bay, they could conveniently survey the entire bay's defenses and hydrographic tidal conditions, collecting sufficient data for the "final solution."

Lu Wenyuan wore a cloak and rode a not-particularly-impressive Mongolian horse, patrolling along the "Willow Palisade." Around him was a group of foot retainers carrying clubs, knives, and spears.

November in Shandong was already bitingly cold. Wind made the willow fence rustle loudly. Last night's frost still hadn't completely thawed.

The planted willows had taken root, but now the leaves had all fallen, leaving only bare branches.

"Willow Palisade" was his name for the willow fence set up on Qimu Island—his retainers, tenants, and servants didn't understand why but followed the term.

Daily inspection of the Willow Palisade had become his fixed schedule. Wherever there was damage, people had to immediately repair it. Half of the able-bodied men among recruited tenants, whether militia or not, patrolled, repaired, and reinforced the Willow Palisade daily. The Palisade had grown from a single fence wall to a double fence wall. Starting a month ago, they also added chevaux-de-frise and wooden obstacles between the two fence walls.

His subordinates thought this was just Master Lu being extra careful—after all, soldiers, bandits, and refugees were rampant in Shandong. Any wealthy household either lived in cities or built fortified compounds for self-protection. But they thought his Willow Palisade was unnecessary—because Master Lu had already built a very solid brick and stone fortress on Qimu Island. Ordinary bandits and rogue soldiers couldn't crack it, and wouldn't come to this deserted coastal island anyway.

Only Huang Ande knew they would soon be facing a highly mobile rebel army with Liaodong cavalry as its main force—not weak in combat—requiring considerable defensive measures.

The patrol group walked through the biting sea wind to the Willow Palisade gate. This was a simple wooden structure gate, much more complex than the crude palisade. The solid gate had a gatehouse above with firing ports, covered, and watched day and night by militia.

Lu Wenyuan personally climbed the gatehouse and inspected the blankets and charcoal for militia to keep warm at night, whether torch illumination was adequately stocked, and whether the signal rockets for alarms were kept dry and usable—meticulous. Only if he took it seriously enough would his subordinates take it seriously.

Although Lu Wenyuan was stationed on Qimu Island, busy with construction projects and agricultural development every day, through wireless radio he knew every step of the entire operation clearly. A month ago, the Ocean Fleet had officially landed in Taiwan, opening the curtain on Operation Engine.

Three weeks later, he received a telegram: Taiwan's purification camps had reached the standard of processing 2,000 people. He was to prepare to receive refugees from the southern Shandong region—Daoist Zhang was working on gathering refugees, and the first batch would soon be transferred to Qimu Island.

On Qimu Island, necessary facilities were largely complete. Finished temporary barracks on the island could accommodate 3,000 people. Grain, medicine, and necessary cold-weather supplies had also been stored in considerable quantities.

Due to limited conditions, Qimu Island was only a transit station, not doing complex "purification"—just giving refugees basic food and warmth, then quickly transferring them out. The current main transfer destination was Taiwan—transfer to Jeju would wait until next spring. Partly because the schedule wouldn't allow it, and partly to avoid Jeju's winter. Transporting to Taiwan could at least save large quantities of cotton clothing, bedding, and fuel.

Gazing out from the gatehouse, Shandong's land stretched bleak and desolate—this year was a famine year. The already barren and mountainous eastern three prefectures looked even more desolate. Although it was almost noon, there wasn't a wisp of cooking smoke visible anywhere in sight. Longkou Bay also had barely any ships visible.

In the distance came the sound of mule bells. That was the "people-gathering team" Lu Wenyuan had organized returning—actually a refugee collection patrol. Each team consisted of several two-wheeled mule carts and a squad of militia, going to nearby villages and main roads to collect refugees. Each trip collected quite a few people. Women, children, and elderly rode the carts along with those too weak from hunger to walk. Those who could walk did so. Batch by batch, they were collected to the island's temporary refugee camp.

In less than half a month, they had collected over five hundred people here. Many were already dying of starvation when picked up. Among them were many infants and toddlers abandoned by roadsides and in empty buildings. Due to lack of food, clothing, and care, even if picked up, many couldn't survive.

Every day, quite a few corpses were carried out through the Willow Palisade gate to be buried in distant wastelands.

"Too tragic." Lu Wenyuan murmured. Since being posted away, he had seen many, many scenes that shook his nerves. Even so, he still often felt uncomfortable with all this. Especially every morning when militia carried out the bodies of refugees who had died overnight from the barracks area—he always avoided looking, afraid he couldn't bear it.

Death, famine, and destruction—for those who hadn't experienced them personally, they were forever just topics and statistics. Only when truly facing them did one feel the horror.

The militia hurried to open the gate, letting the cart train and stream of people in. People walked in scattered and sparse, finally all entering with difficulty. The militia had to call and herd them while distributing a piece of millet pancake to each refugee to help them regain strength—they dared not give more, fearing they'd eat themselves to death.

Lu Wenyuan descended from the gatehouse and asked Wang Qisuo, who had led the team out: "How many people collected?"

"Reporting to Master," Wang Qisuo, despite wearing a thick cotton jacket and hat, was still frozen red-faced with clear snot running, "There aren't many people nearby anymore. Today we collected over forty total, mostly children and women, plus some old men and women. Several are nearly starved to death—don't know if they'll make it through tonight."

"You've worked hard. After delivering them to camp, you and the brothers rest."

"Thank you, Master!"

Lu Wenyuan then returned to the farmstead. On the leveled ground in front of the farmstead, women were rubbing sea asparagus on reed mats. The tender leaves of sea asparagus harvested from coastal mudflats and grasslands were sun-dried, then bundled and vigorously rubbed to remove bitter juice, then dried another afternoon and rubbed again—becoming supple and resilient. Strand by strand like tea leaves, dried another day, the moisture completely evaporated, and sea asparagus jerky was ready—stored in bags for eating anytime.

After Lu Wenyuan introduced this species to the mudflats, this extremely hardy coastal weed immediately flourished—sea asparagus had extremely strong vitality and was highly salt-tolerant. Where salinity was low, it grew tender green; where salinity was high, it grew red. The higher the salinity, the deeper the red, but it didn't affect growth.

He ordered tenant families' women to harvest it, then taught them hands-on how to process it. No one knew why the master was processing so many wild vegetables until the first batch of refugees was collected—then this dried sea asparagus jerky came into use.

Dried sea asparagus didn't have the unusual bitter taste common to wild vegetables and had a light flavor. Nutrition was also quite rich. During the Three Years of Natural Disasters, it had saved many lives. In the old dimension, some people mixed it with pork crackling for buns or ate it cold-dressed. Lu Wenyuan wasn't so particular here—he used dried sea asparagus as filler, mixing it with relief rations and cooking it into porridge for refugees.

As for cooking fuel, they used sea asparagus stalks.
