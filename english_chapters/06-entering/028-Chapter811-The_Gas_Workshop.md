# Chapter 811 - The Gas Workshop

Beneath the high-roofed factory building of the gas plant, over a dozen cylindrical gas generators stood on their poured reinforced-concrete bases. The generators used water-jacket seals. The overhead gas-transfer piping had been installed on the iron supports of the elevated framework. The pipes were cast iron, with joints sealed using a mixture of water glass and crusite powder—currently their best corrosion-resistant sealing material. Lingao's enormous demand for crushed porcelain had spawned a new industry in Guangdong and Fujian: the collection of broken porcelain. Kilns that had previously discarded damaged or defective wares during firing now had merchants collecting them for shipment to Lingao, where the Industrial Sector ground the shards into fine powder with ball mills.

The valves and flow meters were Lingao-made, and their quality wasn't particularly reliable. Thus the entire workshop was completely open on all sides to maximize ventilation and prevent leaks from causing casualties.

"What's the problem?" Jiang Ye jumped off the vehicle and first glanced at the birdcage hanging by the workshop entrance—lacking special chemicals to add a warning odor to the gas, they had to resort to the simplest test: caged birds. All facilities with gas had them stationed nearby. The little bird inside looked lively, showing no unusual behavior.

"The No. 4 generator's outlet temperature is rising too fast!" The shift foreman reported nervously, handing over the work log. He had once been a kiln-tender with a special skill—he could tell the temperature inside a furnace just by looking at the color of the fire. But since coming to Lingao, that technique had been replaced by industrial thermometers. Though his secret art was now worthless, his work experience remained useful, so he'd been trained as a foreman.

Jiang Ye glanced at the work log, then looked through the observation window at the conditions inside the furnace—truth be told, he wasn't that familiar with gas generators either; he'd just crash-studied the technical materials.

"It should be running off-center," Jiang Ye said. Off-center operation meant the ash layer inside the furnace was high on one side and low on the other, with the fire layer slanted accordingly—the high side ran hot, the low side ran cold. "Test the gas quality!"

Part of the gas produced in the furnace was diverted to a test burner on a branch pipe—lacking instruments to analyze gas composition, they had to resort to the simplest method: burning and observing by eye to roughly check the main components.

"Report! Carbon monoxide content has dropped! Carbon dioxide content has increased!" shouted an apprentice who was interning at the site.

"Get the furnace rods. Let's go up top and clear the ash!" Jiang Ye called out. Someone immediately brought the specialized rod. "You lot—use hooks from the ash pan to rake out the slag!"

Jiang Ye first broke up the accumulated high ash layer to lower it, then coordinated with the raking below to clear out a considerable amount of slag. Even a visual inspection showed the ash had high carbon content—confirming his diagnosis was basically correct. After raking out the ash, he had workers use iron rods to tamp down the fuel layer where combustion was fiercest, and added some fresh fuel to keep the layer uniform.

After a while, both the outlet temperature and gas quality returned to normal. The fault had been cleared. Jiang Ye knew this was the simplest kind of gas-generator malfunction—but also the most common. The transmigration enterprise operated gas generators on a considerable scale, but the shortage of experienced operators remained an unsolved problem. Even critical projects like the steelworks couldn't get enough skilled hands.

He looked over the crew. Aside from the foreman, not a single person had experience operating a gas generator—training still had a long way to go. When problems arose, even the foreman was at a loss.

Jiang Ye briefly analyzed the cause of the fault, the handling method, and why it was done that way. These were all simple things—with one experienced master to guide them, a batch of skilled workers could be trained up quickly. But currently, the "master" himself wasn't very reliable.

Clearing the fault was one thing; finding the root cause was another. From the technical manual, Jiang Ye knew that off-center operation had few causes—apart from internal slag buildup, it was usually a problem with the fuel. From the handling just now, the internal slag had been dealt with in time.

Jiang Ye grabbed a handful of coal granules from the basket—the gasification furnace could burn various fuels; here they used slurry coal from the coal-washing plant, the coal dust and fines that settled out of the wash water. After collection, drying, and grinding, it was ready for use.

The coal dust felt damp in his hand—too much moisture. Jiang Ye made his first diagnosis.

"Look, this coal is too wet." Jiang Ye opened his clenched fist. The coal dust fell in small clumps. "High moisture means uneven loading, which causes an uneven fuel bed. So with raw material like this, you have to level it out right after loading." His gaze swept across the crew. "Who loaded the furnace today?"

"I—I did," a worker said hesitantly, raising his hand.

"Why didn't you follow the procedure in the operations manual?" Jiang Ye said sternly. "Cutting corners causes accidents! You didn't level the fuel today, and we got a fault. At best, it affects production. At worst, if not handled in time, it could burn through the furnace body and cause a major accident! You'd die for nothing, and take your coworkers with you!"

The unfortunate worker trembled with fear, unable to say a word—"die for nothing" was a devastating phrase. If not for the "new society" in Lingao, he'd already be on his knees begging for mercy.

"Dock his work points per regulations!" Jiang Ye told the foreman. "Hold a squad meeting after the shift and give him some 'help.'"

Besides commune members, all naturalized workers and employees were now under the work-point system. However, this form of labor compensation was far more complex than the labor points commune members earned from assigned work. The HR specialists among the Elders were developing a comprehensive compensation system that included fixed wages, bonus calculations, fringe benefits, and mandatory work-injury and labor insurance. This entire system was built on the foundation of "work points."

"Yes, yes." The foreman nodded repeatedly.

The foreman was also docked points for failing to supervise properly. The leadership responsibility system was being rolled out: since leaders received more pay and perks than ordinary workers and staff, they had to bear greater responsibility as well.

On his way back to the command post, Jiang Ye found a moment amid his busy schedule to record the entire fault-handling process in his work notebook. Then he noted that he needed to send a memo to the fuel management department: coal particles smaller than 10mm shouldn't be used as gasification feedstock—better to make coal briquettes instead. And there was the moisture issue—slurry coal naturally had high moisture content; it needed at least a few more days of drying.

From the gas workshop, the elevated gas pipeline extended toward the open-hearth workshop. Most of the supports were brick pillars with wrought-iron columns inside for added strength. Watching workers carry mortar buckets and lay bricks one by one, Jiang Ye sighed: if only they had enough steel, welded steel supports would be faster and stronger. When would these "make-do" days of industrialization ever end? Steel was the skeleton of industry. Without enough steel, Lingao's so-called modern industrial system was like a patient with rickets—unable to exert its full strength.

He recalled the recent technical discussion at the steel combine about the iron mixer. At the time, some Elders from the Machinery and Metallurgical sectors had argued that the iron mixer was an important piece of process equipment for open-hearth steelmaking and should be added to the manufacturing program. An iron mixer was equipment used to regulate and balance the supply of molten iron between the blast furnace and converter, ensuring an uninterrupted supply for the converter. Storing and mixing the iron in the mixer evened out composition and temperature—very beneficial for converter steelmaking. With a mixer, molten pig iron from the blast furnace could go directly into the open-hearth furnace, skipping the process of first casting it into ingots and then remelting in a cupola furnace—saving a great deal of fuel and fully leveraging the advantages of continuous production.

But when it came to actual manufacturing, the Machinery Sector discovered that making a 50-ton iron mixer that could also move and tilt presented a series of problems with critical moving parts. In the end, they decided to use the less economical but simpler process of smelting pig-iron ingots—they'd add the mixer later when materials improved.

This problem fully exposed the shortcomings caused by material scarcity. Jiang Ye thought: if only the Metallurgical Department could reliably supply steel of the required grades, manufacturing these parts wouldn't be entirely impossible. Fortunately, the iron mixer was only an ancillary improvement device, not a decisive piece of production equipment.

Lingao Steel Company's new steelmaking workshop no longer used the old converter method—the so-called Bessemer process—but had switched to the more efficient Siemens-Martin method: the open-hearth process. Open-hearth furnaces were used not only in steelmaking but also in the glass industry and other smelting fields. It was a highly efficient process.

In open-hearth steelmaking, coal gas served as fuel. Under direct flame heating, pig iron, scrap steel, high-grade iron ore, and other raw materials were melted and refined into molten steel on a large scale. In the old timeline, this remained the dominant steelmaking method until the 1960s, with production efficiency and steel quality far exceeding the traditional Bessemer converter. The open-hearth furnace's basic principle was heat recovery—it didn't need a separate regenerator because it incorporated one internally.

In converter steelmaking, the heat required for smelting came from the smelting process itself—the chemical reactions of the furnace charge. The open-hearth process required heat from an external source: specifically, an efficient, controllable, and relatively clean gaseous fuel—coal gas.
