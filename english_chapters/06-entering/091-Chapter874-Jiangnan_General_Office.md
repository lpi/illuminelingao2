# Chapter 874 - Jiangnan General Office

As Zhao Yingong's work in Hangzhou gradually got underway, the External Intelligence Bureau's network in Jiangnan began to take shape. The land and sea route enterprises also gradually established themselves in various locations. This work progressed relatively slowly—opening branches in unfamiliar territory was no easy matter, let alone conducting business.

Of all the trading houses, the External Intelligence Bureau placed the greatest importance on Qiwei's positioning. As the transportation and logistics enterprise among the land and sea routes, Qiwei Escort Bureau would play a crucial role in future refugee transshipment. Preparations had to be made well in advance.

Because Qiwei's expansion in Guangdong had been so aggressive, even though Sun Kecheng had recruited every usable fellow villager and relative from his Jiangxi hometown, they still couldn't staff every branch with enough clerks and escort guards. Not to mention undertaking escorting operations—training a qualified escort guard took many years, and only people who had practiced martial arts from childhood could do this work. There weren't many such people to begin with. Under the direction of Zhang Xin, who effectively controlled Qiwei's business operations, Qiwei had no choice but to open wide its doors for recruiting escort guards.

Most escort bureaus in Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta had been barely surviving under Qiwei's pressure. If Sun Kecheng hadn't insisted on some "jianghu righteousness" and refused to push his competitors to drink the northwest wind, leaving some escort business for them, they would all have gone bankrupt long ago. Now, under Zhang Xin's command, this benevolence changed its nature: Qiwei extended an "alliance" olive branch to its competitors.

This so-called "alliance" was annexation—merely dressing up this merger in nicer clothing. Starting from the second half of 1630, riding the prestige from the great victory at Chengmai, Qiwei embarked on the path of swallowing its competitors.

After three or four months of integration, Qiwei had absorbed all the escort bureaus in the Pearl River Delta. Although the other bureaus' business names were all retained, without exception they had become "alliance branches." For Zhang Xin, the greatest acquisition wasn't the network of bureau branches extending throughout Guangdong and reaching Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi—it was the escort bureaus' most valuable asset: the escort guards.

Escort guards embodied the most concentrated conservative social ethics of ancient Chinese society. They were a quite reliable and loyal group. And their involvement in commerce meant they weren't as conservative and pedantic as hidebound scholars.

Such people, with just a little cultivation of loyalty, would become a reliable force at one's command. And these were exactly the personnel most urgently needed by elders posted abroad. The elders needed such people—skilled in martial arts, versed in worldly wisdom, knowledgeable about social conditions, and trustworthy—to serve as attendants and field operatives for the Intelligence Bureau.

Zhang Xin first massively deployed Jiangxi-origin personnel from Qiwei's Guangdong branches to Jiangnan and the capital as advance scouts, further creating a personnel shortage. He then used the opportunity of depleted Guangdong branches to rapidly fill in these new "alliance" forces, thoroughly dismantling the dominance of Jiangxi-origin personnel in Qiwei. Subsequently, he transferred in a batch of naturalized citizens who had previously engaged in commerce from Lingao, placing them in managerial and operational positions at the various branches.

After this thorough restructuring, Qiwei had completely fallen into the Elder Council's hands. Although Sun Kecheng still held half the shares in terms of equity, he no longer had control over overall operations or personnel. The Political Security General Administration had previously been pulling "promising young people" from Qiwei to Lingao for "training," and now this training was completely open. Zhao Manxiong had formulated a rotating training schedule for Qiwei personnel, planning to complete registration, political vetting, and "training" of all Qiwei Escort Bureau personnel by the end of 1632—ultimately bringing Qiwei completely under Elder Council control.

At the same time, Qiwei, as an important piece on the land and sea routes chessboard, continued its expansion. Because escort guards were no longer sufficient, newly opened branches and outlets mostly appeared in the guise of inns, warehouses, and carriage and boat companies. Escort guards served only as security forces protecting their own facilities and transportation vehicles—the External Intelligence Bureau had positioned Qiwei as a transportation and logistics enterprise. Escorting was just one of its business lines.

To prepare for the next phase of work, Jiang Shan and Li Yan of the External Intelligence Bureau, Zhang Xin of the Guangzhou Station, and elders from the Commerce Department and Planning Commission together made further adjustments to Qiwei's layout, equity structure, and organization.

The restructured Qiwei would still use the "Escort Bureau" name, reorganizing Qiwei Escort Bureau into Qiwei Escort Bureau United Limited Company. Besides the Elder Council and original Qiwei personnel shares, additional shares were carved out for the absorbed "alliance" bureaus. After intensive maneuvering, a new share allocation was formed.

The new Qiwei Escort Bureau United Limited Company's shares were: Elder Council 51%, original Qiwei Escort Bureau personnel 40%, "alliance" personnel 9%. Of each year's net profits, fourteen shares would be distributed as dividends: Elder Council six and a half shares, development fund one share, charitable accumulation fund one share, all bureau personnel five and a half shares.

All personnel listed in the register would follow Lingao's salary system. Naturalized citizen workers operating in areas outside the Green and Blue Zones, and simultaneously outside the circulation certificate currency zone, would be paid in silver and copper coins. All personnel would be compensated according to the *Provisional Occupational Classification and Salary Guidance Standard 1630 Edition* and *Provisional Vocational Technical Rating Standard 1631 Edition* promulgated by the Civil Affairs People's Committee. Escort guard wasn't originally listed as an occupation in these documents, so the Civil Affairs People's Committee's Labor Management Bureau specially formulated professional categories and technical grades for escort guards.

After implementing the new system, everyone in the bureau would receive a salary slip on the tenth of each month, detailing the components of their compensation: monthly salary, night shift allowance, travel allowance, seniority allowance, and finally skill allowance. Liu Muzhou had assembled a few people to create a *Martial Arts Rating Table*—the higher the level, the higher the skill allowance.

Besides payments, there were also deductions, mainly in the welfare area. The financial sector had officially rolled out a social insurance system among naturalized citizens. Currently, two items were deducted monthly from compensation: pension and work injury insurance. Since the Elder Council wasn't yet ready to establish an insurance company, insurance business was handled by Delong Bank.

Organizationally, Qiwei Escort Bureau United Limited Company established a Board of Directors and General Management Bureau in Guangzhou. Three general offices were set up under it: Guangzhou General Office, Shanghai General Office, and Capital General Office. Each general office had one General Manager, with General Managers appointed from naturalized citizens dispatched by Lingao.

Each general office reported directly to the General Management Bureau and Board of Directors, conducting local business under General Management Bureau direction. In terms of specific jurisdiction, the Qiwei Escort Bureau General Management Bureau was under the Colonization and Trade Department; the Guangzhou General Office was directed by the Guangzhou Station; the Shanghai General Office was managed by the Hangzhou Station; the Capital General Office was managed by the Beijing Station.

Under the new management system, the Guangzhou General Office was demoted to just one of three general offices, effectively becoming a branch. It had completely lost its original influence.

For management convenience, the General Management Bureau Director and Board Chairman was Zhang Xin of the Guangzhou Station. Sun Kecheng held the title of Chief Escort and Vice Chairman, but effectively had no control over specific affairs.

Zhang Xin had done substantial work to transform Qiwei Escort Bureau into a large-scale transportation and logistics enterprise. Based on the social conditions of Guangdong in this time-space, he had formulated a quite comprehensive management system for Qiwei's transportation and logistics operations. This system had proven very successful in practice. The transportation and logistics network that Qiwei Escort Bureau had established in Guangdong, particularly in the Pearl River Delta, was continuously improved through operation. In just three or four years, Qiwei had extended its reach throughout Guangdong province and into the adjacent, conveniently accessible regions of Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi.

In the Pearl River Delta, Qiwei Escort Bureau had nearly achieved monopoly over the transportation and logistics market—of course, this was with strong support from the External Intelligence Bureau and Commerce Department.

Now, as the person in charge of the Shanghai General Office, Zhao Yingong was preparing to replicate this model in Jiangnan. This wasn't just preparation for the next phase of refugee transport; it also aimed to control local economic circulation. Zhao Yingong knew the Elder Council would next "digest" Guangdong, thoroughly incorporating it into Lingao's new economic order, while simultaneously beginning to develop Jiangnan. Building the foundation beforehand was also one of his important tasks.

The Jiangsu-Zhejiang region was relatively stable in the late Ming, making it possible to establish large-scale logistics and transportation enterprises. So even before Zhao Yingong arrived in Jiangnan, the first batch of Qiwei personnel had already set out for Jiangnan and the capital to develop the situation, laying groundwork for subsequently dispatched elder intelligence agents.

To ensure Zhao Yingong's work could proceed smoothly, Zhang Xin not only dispatched several of Qiwei's business backbones to establish operations in Jiangnan, but also requested the Elder Council to select some willing-to-travel elders to go to Shanghai and personally oversee this work.

To ensure smooth progress, he also requested that several Special Reconnaissance Unit squads be dispatched to Shanghai to await deployment.

The first expansion action of Qiwei Escort Bureau in Shanghai was to establish a long-distance passenger transport company centered on Shanghai.

In this time-space, long-distance travel already had certain requirements, especially in densely populated regions like the Pearl River Delta where population movement was very frequent. Wealthy people naturally had their own carriages, horses, and sedans. Ordinary people either relied on their own feet or hired boats or sedans.

Sedan chairs and boats already had specialized sedan companies and boat companies in Jiangnan of this time-space. But sedan and boat companies were all small-scale, with low service levels. The sedans and boats they used were old and worn, with poor sanitation. Most of the owners in this industry didn't care much about operations, focusing only on exploiting customers and sedan/boat workers. Sedan and boat workers received meager compensation and could only seek extra income by extorting travelers en route. Inns and porters along the way similarly viewed travelers as meat on the chopping block. So ordinary common people all dreaded long journeys.
