# Chapter 888 - Simple Rations Continued

To facilitate preservation, relief rations were thoroughly dehydrated, making their texture excessively hard. Generally, consumers had to smash them with a hammer and wash them down with water; swallowing was almost impossible without water. More often, consumers would adding some vegetables and boil them directly in a pot into a gruel.

Relief rations were essentially a simplified individual ration, unable to compare with ordinary military MREs in taste and nutrition. Especially due to their hard, rough texture and weird taste, almost no one praised them except starving refugees. Once, due to a logistics department error during a business trip, Scardal had to gnaw on relief rations for a week. He commented very acidly: "A person can live for half a year on the Grassland series, can live seven days without eating, but can only live three days eating only relief rations." During the Mainland Campaign, relief rations earned the nickname "Teeth-Grinding Bricks."

Some efforts were made regarding the taste of relief rations. Within a few months after development, the R&D team patterned after modern instant noodles, adding various spices and seasonings to develop cumin, spicy, numbing spicy, seafood, and scallion flavors. Of course, changes in flavor didn't increase appetite much—except for starving people, ordinary soldiers and laborers still gave them poor reviews. As Dongmen Chuiyu, who had eaten every instant food produced or unproduced during R&D, said: "For starving people, varied flavors can't fill an empty stomach; for people who can eat their fill normally, complex seasoning can't make relief rations delicious."

From the beginning of "Operation Engine" transporting refugees until the end of the Mainland Campaign, tens of millions of relief rations were produced, saving millions of refugees from starvation. These rations were wrapped in oil paper and neatly stacked in standard 20-liter wooden crates made of nailed planks—this crate was exactly the same as ammunition crates, so they were generally painted in red and yellow alternating colors for distinction. Later, the Imperial Army on expeditions sometimes carried some to stabilize public sentiment or pay commission to migrant workers. In this period, striking bold characters were printed on relief rations: "A Gift from the Senate and the Imperial People."

The shelf life of relief rations was set at three years. Actually, in relatively low-temperature and dry environments, some batches produced later under better processing conditions were still safe to eat after twenty years of storage. Of course, such rations became incredibly hard, almost unchewable. They had to be boiled into paste with large amounts of water to be eaten. Due to their storability, in some remote Imperial border outposts with long logistics lines, or trading posts and expedition stations deep in wild lands, relief rations were once tightly sealed and used as internal non-load-bearing walls in certain rooms, serving as a final emergency reserve. This measure saved the lives of quite a few soldiers and exploration personnel on duty in remote locations, allowing them to hold out under barbarian siege until rescue troops arrived.

"Because relief rations are very sturdy and troublesome to eat, expired relief rations often appear in military and Planning Commission warehouses everywhere due to lack of consumption. The general disposal method is handing them to the agricultural department to grind up for raising earthworms. However, some with better appearance are picked out. Some soldiers in their spare time carve relief rations with bayonets into various crafts or small daily items. For example, this pipe you see was carved personally by Elder Shi Zhiqi, Admiral of the Marines, using a relief ration. Additionally, Elder Pan Da, General of the Engineers, collected relief ration pipes from every year since their introduction. Please look, these are private collections donated to our museum by Elder Pan. They carry different scents, such as the seafood flavor of St. Year 5, cumin and numbing spicy of St. Year 6, coconut scent of St. Year 7. As for the St. Year 8 vintage, due to the bumper harvest of potatoes and sweet potatoes brought by expanded fertilizer plant capacity the previous year, which in turn drove animal husbandry, granules of corned beef were added—this was unprecedented at the time. Now we can still see whole corned beef granules on the pipe's surface. Therefore, pipes made from St. Year 8 relief rations are also called Bumper Harvest Pipes..."

—Commentary on Relief Ration Pipes by the guide at the Imperial Military Museum

Whether naturalized citizens or indigenous people, everyone in Lingao knew: The Australians were about to undertake a large-scale operation.

This wasn't baseless wind—anyone with slight understanding of the "Australians'" or "Short-haired Thieves'" way of doing things knew: the busy scene in the Ministry of Light Industry's food factory revealed this unsettling omen.

In the new workshop of the food factory by the Wenlan River, relief rations were entering large-scale production, and Grassland dry ration production also increased threefold over normal. Starting from March, the food factory's task was to produce 100,000 portions of No. 1 Relief Rations and 20,000 portions of Grassland series dry rations every month. The task issued by the Planning Commission was: Complete 400,000 portions of No. 1 Relief Rations and 50,000 portions of No. 1 Instant Soup Blocks by the end of June 1631. Complete total annual orders of 1.2 million portions by year-end. Additionally, orders for other instant foods were issued, including fish sauce, salted fish, pickles, kimchi, biscuits, candy, etc.

All food enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry and the Agricultural People's Committee—Grain Processing Plant, Seafood Processing Plant, Food Factory—expanded their scale and increased personnel. 850 naturalized employees were divided into two shifts, cancelling all leave. Production proceeded 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Roads from Bopu to various food factories were renovated, all changed to high-grade cinder hardened roads. Heavy ox carts and light Purple Lightning handcarts ran on the roads, wheels rolling. Except for vehicles entering and exiting the factory gates from morning to night, the factories looked no different from those in other industrial zones. However, when producing instant foods with large amounts of added spices, people nearby could smell strong aromas.

Many vehicles entered and exited the food factory daily to move goods. Some even delivered in vehicle-mounted refrigerated cabinets: 150kg baskets of vegetables; 50kg bags of unpolished rice, rice flour, beans; 100kg packs of dried sweet potato and flour; 50kg baskets of fruit; 50kg packs of cane sugar and salt; 5kg packs of spices; 50kg crates of salted and fresh fish; 5-liter packs of fish sauce... Finally, the rarest food: fats/oils. Packaged in 5-liter wooden barrels or ceramic jars. The contents varied: besides common soybean oil and lard, there was fishy-smelling fish oil and various edible vegetable oils.

The floors and walls of newly built workshops were completely tiled. Lighting used rows of glass windows; ventilation windows were installed with multi-layer screens, from coarse mesh to fine mesh capable of making clothes, blocking even the tiniest flying insects. Workers entering and exiting workshops had to wade through lime water pools, change clothes, and wash hands carefully. Workers wore white work clothes, head covers, and masks, wearing oilcloth overshoes to process raw materials. Most raw materials were ground into powder; vegetables and fruits were processed into paste or dried products. Then various ingredients were constantly poured into large pots according to formulas for processing. Then water was added in mixing pots for stirring—mixing pots were driven by steam engine power transmitted via overhead drive shafts. A newly installed large mixing pot could stir 250kg of raw materials at once.

The industrial sector couldn't produce stainless steel temporarily, and couldn't manufacture aluminum due to cost and energy issues. Thus most processing equipment in the food factory used tin-plated iron sheet; a few small-sized equipment used copper, some used glass or ceramics.

The evenly stirred paste was steam-heated to 100°C, ensuring the food was completely cooked. Then the paste was poured into molds. Molds installed on rotating chain plates were towed into gas-heated continuous kilns for drying. Biscuits shrinking during drying automatically fell from molds onto large tinplate trays when the chain plate turned around.

Lacking latex gloves, besides disinfecting hands with disinfectant before entering workshops, workers were not allowed to touch food and wrapping paper with hands during packaging. All operations were done with tongs.

Packaged relief rations were put into sterilization rooms, heated to 120°C with superheated dry steam from specialized boilers, then cooled to 40°C. After sterilization, rations were packed into standard 20-liter wooden crates. Crates were lined with oil paper coated with persimmon oil, ensuring water impermeability. A packet of lime was put into the crate as desiccant. The lime packet was printed with striking black characters: "Recyclable Material, Note for Recovery!"—Not just lime packets, paper boxes and wooden crates had similar warnings.

Besides supplying relief rations for individual immediate consumption, the food factory also produced relief rations for multiple people. The composition was exactly the same, but made into 2.5kg blocks. When used, they were smashed and boiled with water into paste. Called "No. 1 On-site Relief Ration." This ration was used when recruiting refugees at refugee relief stations set up in disaster areas.

To guarantee vitamin supply and prevent beriberi and scurvy from monotonous diet lacking vitamins, besides producing instant soup blocks, the food factory would also manufacture 15,000 kg of dehydrated vegetables and dried fruits. Additionally, the Grain Processing Plant had to prepare 50,000 kg of brown rice—for preparing meals at transit camps. Brown rice was also processed: first cooked into rice, then thoroughly dried. This way, it could be boiled into porridge without much fuel. In emergencies, it could also be eaten directly.
