# Chapter 1000 Military Dogs

Lingao's water resources were insufficient in the long run, not suitable as a major future industrial and agricultural base. Changhua had little arable land, but its freshwater, timber, and industrial mineral resources were much richer than Lingao. The Changhua River's runoff alone was 900 million cubic meters, while all of Lingao County had only 700 million. Developable hydropower resources were 40,000 kilowatts—30 times more than Lingao. Not to mention the local iron and copper mines. Even just the cement rock resources had great industrial potential.

"What? Going to build irrigation?" Fang Jinghan greeted Yan Quezhi.

"It's you guys," Yan Quezhi seemed very busy. "Right now we don't have the capacity to develop Changhua—resources all have to be diverted to Taiwan. Industry still needs population. Having just resources and technology simply isn't enough."

"Then why did the Planning Bureau rush to send you here?" Fang Jinghan asked curiously.

"First, to train students," Yan Quezhi pointed at several young students next to him operating Lingao-produced equipment and instruments. "Second, to see if we can utilize the Changhua River's water transport capacity—ship transport is impossible, but floating rafts and the like should work. Timber resources here are very abundant. Then there's also future ore transport to consider."

Although the Changhua River had low navigation value, its water volume and hydropower were both much greater than Lingao's Wenlan River. According to 20th-century data: In water resources alone, the Changhua River's annual runoff was 900 million cubic meters, while all of Lingao County's runoff was only 700 million. Developable hydropower resources were 40,000 kilowatts—30 times more than Lingao. From the perspective of hydropower development, it was very superior. Unfortunately, there was no capacity for development in the short term.

"That said, but water resources are also very important to us. Changhua's mineral resources are very abundant; it can completely become an industrial and mining base in the future, all requiring large amounts of water resources."

Yan Quezhi's team's task was to figure out how much water resources and hydropower Changhua actually had available in the 17th century, and what kind of help the Changhua River could provide for Hainan's industrialization.

Changhua's agricultural potential was limited. The whole county had only 340,000 *mu* of arable land, and soil fertility was even worse. Except for having certain advantages in water and heat resources, it was inferior to northern Qiong counties like Lingao in all respects.

"In a few days, could you send someone to take us to Shilu?" Yan Quezhi suddenly asked.

"I can take you." Fang Jinghan said, "But what are you going to Shilu for? The geological survey last time should have been very thorough."

"Still for surveying terrain."

Yan Quezhi's other task was to lead students to Shilu to survey the terrain between Shilu and Changhua Fort, to see if it was possible to build a simple road or railway.

The purpose wasn't to mine the local iron ore—with their current industrial capacity and steel production level, it was simply impossible to support such a large-scale project. The reason the Planning Bureau was eager to understand transport conditions and try to build a road was because of Shilu's dolomite mine.

Dolomite served as a flux in modern pig iron smelting, able to improve pig iron quality and reduce coal consumption. In modern steel production processes, producing one ton of pig iron required consuming several dozen kilograms of dolomite. After the Maniao Steel Complex went into production, it would need about several hundred tons of dolomite per year.

In the old dimension, 1 kilometer south of Shilu Town, there was a dolomite mine with reserves of 1.25 billion tons at 19-21% grade. Full-scale development was impossible, but small-scale mining to supply the Maniao Steel Complex for production was still feasible. The Planning Bureau and industrial departments' assessment believed that according to data, Shilu's dolomite mine was not deeply buried. It could be mined relying on manual labor and simple machinery. If demand was not large, intermittent mining was completely feasible.

After mining dolomite, there would be the issue of outward transport. So Wu De was considering building a simple road locally. Even setting aside laying the foundation for future Shilu iron ore development, there was also demand for mining small amounts of associated copper, gold, and other non-ferrous metal ores at Shilu. Building roads would also help extend governance tentacles into Changhua's interior and develop and radiate to surrounding areas.

The Planning Bureau also required Kong Lingyang to establish a permanent outpost at Shilu if possible: "The Morning Star flag must fly over Yayuling every day!"—to ensure the presence of government authority locally.

According to intelligence provided by Li people, almost every year some outsider Han people hired Li people as guides and porters to venture into Li areas, penetrating to Shilu, attempting to mine local copper ore—or with better luck, find gold. Although few of them succeeded—very few could correctly find the ore veins—the indiscriminate digging everywhere and small kiln smelting seriously damaged local resources, especially disrupting the survey team's exploration. This was intolerable to the Planning Bureau. Since Li Haiping's time, people had been caught going to Yayuling to illegally mine copper: an endless stream every year. So cracking down on illegal mining was also one of Kong Lingyang's tasks.

With roads and stationed outposts, and patrol teams on the roads, control over the areas along the route would be established.

"You don't need to go yourself. Just send a few Li people as guides. Haven't you recruited quite a few Li soldiers?" Yan Quezhi said, "A round trip takes several days. You all have work; it's not good to delay that."

"If only Zhen Huan and his group hadn't just enlisted, we could send them directly to Shilu—they're locals. Experts at climbing mountains and drilling through forests. No one could evade them." Mu Min said.

"Even if he had served for ten years, no way," Fang Jinghan shook his head. "Locals not serving locally—that's a basic principle of army organization."

The Senate was unwilling to have even local security forces like the National Army entirely composed of local people, let alone combat units that Zhen Huan had joined.

The matter of recruiting Zhen Huan to enlist met with Wei Aiwen's pushback that afternoon: it wasn't that he thought these few new recruits had poor quality. In his view, this was a serious infringement on his authority as General Political Department Director—he often forgot his department was the General Staff Political Office.

Mu Min countered that as a member of the recruitment team, she equally had the right to decide who to recruit and who not to recruit. The mission document didn't specify which department or which Senator was specifically in charge. In theory, Mu Min didn't need to consult Wei Aiwen to decide certain matters.

The argument between the two continued until Kong Lingyang appeared again, beaming as he invited the Senators to the kennel to take a look and "guide the dog-raising work."

Mu Min had no interest in dogs, but Wei Aiwen was very interested—when the *Haitian*'s reconnaissance team encountered native ambushes in Taiwan, dogs had played an important role. And now more and more internal security tasks also required dogs to replace some sentries.

Previously, Kong Lingyang had cooperated with the military during his university days and knew that the patrol range of one trained military dog was basically equivalent to 5 soldiers. Well-trained military dogs were excellent helpers for mainland combat suppression patrols, chasing routed soldiers, guarding equipment, and deterring mobs.

The newly built kennel was set up in an enclosure outside Changhua Fort, raising breeding dogs transferred from Lingao.

Kong Lingyang knew little about dog training. This aspect of the work had always been Yang Baogui's responsibility. But the rapid expansion of the dog population at South Sea Farm meant military dog breeding and raising had to find a new location—it couldn't stay in Lingao where land resources were becoming tight. So Lingao's dog farm was split into two parts: working dog training stayed in Lingao, while dog breeding moved to Changhua. Yang Baogui planned to move the training base to Changhua too once he trained his first batch of naturalized citizen students.

Breeding dogs mainly came from Yang Baogui's Olympic family. Back then, Yang Baogui had selectively brought them to serve as breeding stock for working dogs. Later, dogs brought by several other Senators were added, including the Qian brothers' Labrador from Sanya, which was also caught to serve as breeding stock.

To rapidly expand the population, Yang Baogui and Kong Lingyang adopted the method of separating puppies from adults immediately after weaning, switching to artificial feeding to get the adults to produce another litter as soon as possible. Thus the population expanded very quickly.

From native dogs of this dimension, Yang Baogui also selected some with better genes for crossbreeding. Through continuous breeding and gradual culling, a considerable dog population was finally formed. Although only a dozen or so could serve as foundation breeding stock, there were already more than a hundred dogs of suitable age meeting working dog conditions.

Although the first few batches of dogs were of average quality, they were at the golden age for training. Once older, they wouldn't be very suitable for training and could only be sent to the Senate to make hot pot. And Yang Baogui alone couldn't keep up. He adopted a simplified training model, subdividing work, reducing each dog's training items, and lowering workload. Training a batch and sending them out, rapidly distributing working dogs to various departments.

Some dogs, after Yang Baogui's simplified training, had already been allocated to the military, police, and internal affairs departments. Soldiers and police "leading large dogs" on patrol had become a sight in various counties. And at the Sanya mines, military dogs watched over thousands of slave laborers in the mining area.

But although dogs had gained favor from violence departments, they equally encountered systemic issues. Dogs and horses were different from pigs, chickens, and ducks—meat animals fattened up and slaughtered—being used long-term instead. Once assigned to the military or some agency, there were issues of their supply and specialized handlers—this was still relatively easy. Horse and dog supply issues could be resolved by departments themselves, but personnel establishment wasn't easy to resolve.

Yang Baogui's establishment was in the Agricultural Committee. Dog training wasn't the Agricultural Committee's main business; he couldn't extract some workers from those allocated to the Agricultural Committee to learn his dog training skills. These establishments had to be assigned to the military.

Kong Lingyang invited Wei Aiwen to visit specifically to persuade Director Wei and these military heads to quickly organize a military dog unit establishment, allocating some people specifically to learn dog raising and training. Especially finding a few apprentices for Yang Baogui to inherit his dog training mantle—this was something he had repeatedly urged Kong Lingyang to help resolve.
