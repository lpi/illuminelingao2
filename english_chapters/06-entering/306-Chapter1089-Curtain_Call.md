# Chapter 1089 - Curtain Call

The volley of rifles shook the entire ice surface. The front rank of the five hundred "dragoons" seemed to crash into an invisible wall, falling down with men and horses overturned.

The fallen horses and knights instantly became obstacles for the following troops, and immediately more men and horses fell to the ground.

After Chen Guangfu's troops suffered a second volley, fifty or sixty riders had instantly fallen.

The infantry calmly loaded and fired methodically according to the sergeants' commands. Although there was only a double-line formation, the fire density far exceeded the "three-rank formation" of matchlocks of the same era.

"Charge quickly!" Chen Guangfu pressed his body very low, almost lying completely on the horse's back—but except for some of his personal soldiers and house guards who could ride, his subordinates' riding skills were only passable. Under the dense rain of bullets, the soldiers dared not urge their horses to gallop, nor could they control horses to make evasive movements, becoming targets on the bare ice surface.

Rows of gunshots rang out. More and more people fell on the ice surface. In the chaos, some people reined in their horses attempting to flee, and others were carried spinning on the ice surface by frightened horses, at a loss. The scene was unusually chaotic.

Chen Guangfu knew that detour assault from the ice was no longer possible—the enemy was prepared long ago, and there were obviously a large number of well-trained village braves on the island. Even if he rushed up with men and horses, he wouldn't gain any advantage.

Immediately giving a whistle, the remaining men turned their horse heads and fled towards the shore in panic. Some with poor horsemanship couldn't control their startled horses and simply abandoned them to flee on foot.

"Fire at will!"

Rifles chased the fleeing rebel soldiers with shots. People fell on the ice surface from time to time.

"Boring—" Zhu Mingxia said a sentence. Suddenly fierce artillery fire sounded in his ears again. He looked back and saw artillery fire filling the sky on the sandbar, thick smoke obscuring the sun. The large group of rebels gathered on the sandbar was like an avalanche, rushing down from the sandbar rolling and crawling regardless of life or death, running wildly on the ice surface.

The artillery fire this time was rapid fire, lasting less than three minutes. All cannons bombarded azimuth 4471 with full force at their maximum rate of fire.

This place was instantly swallowed by artillery fire. In the black and red explosion flames, only fragments of armor, weapons, banners, and vehicles were seen thrown up, while flesh and blood fragments of men and horses could no longer be seen clearly.

The large group of rebels gathered on the sandbar, whether combat soldiers, auxiliary soldiers, or coerced refugees, all fell into desperate panic at this instant. Seeing the central army banner swallowed by artillery fire, although not a single arrow or bullet was fired from the frontal Willow Palisade, the entire formation still collapsed.

The crowd on the sandbar was like a pot exploding. Because shells were still falling continuously behind them, many people simply slid down from the sandbar, attempting to detour on the ice surface to flee to land. But the ice surface in this section was not frozen very solidly and there were ice crevices. It was also hit by many shells in the bombardment just now, already in a disintegrated state. How could it withstand the trampling of thousands of people? With a few "kacha" sounds, the ice surface shattered instantly. People going down to the ice surface were caught off guard, and many slid into ice crevices instantly. Before they could struggle and call for help, they were submerged by drifting floating ice. For a time, screams and cries for help resounded through the skies. Drifting bodies were everywhere on the floating ice and in ice crevices.

Ma Linxi also went down to the ice surface in the chaos. In the turmoil, he was pushed by someone and fell into an ice hole. Fortunately, he was extremely cautious and specially grabbed a carrying pole before going onto the ice. Although falling into the ice hole was piercingly cold all over and his body was frozen numb, he desperately propped against the floating ice with the carrying pole, avoiding the disaster of drowning. He took a deep breath, exerted all his strength, and finally climbed out, lying on the ice surface panting heavily.

Although the refugees were weak, at least they didn't wear armor. Those falling into ice holes and crevices had some chance to crawl out. Most rebel soldiers wore armor, and combat soldiers wore full iron armor. Once they fell, they were dragged straight down by the iron armor. A few who reacted fast hurriedly abandoned their armor, finally escaping with a life.

"Cease fire, prepare to sortie!" Chen Sigen put down the telescope. The enemy had collapsed. Continuing to shoot was just killing more people. Seeing the shattered ice surface filled with floating corpses, continuing to shoot would just be a meaningless massacre.

Chen Sigen immediately ordered a line infantry company and a village brave company to open the gate of the Willow Palisade to begin pursuit. Zhu Mingxia's three companies also swept across from the ice surface to launch an impact on the flank of the routed troops—he intended to try to intercept most of the routed troops on the sandbar and catch them all in one haul.

The stirring melody of the charge bugle sounded. More than ten buglers blew simultaneously. Various companies were like tigers descending the mountain, rushing straight at the routed crowd with rifles fixed with bayonets, shouting the slogan "Spare those who surrender!" resounding through the skies.

The counter-shock accelerated the disintegration and rout process of the rebel soldiers. Thousands of people threw away weapons and sticks in their hands, used all their strength, howling and running desperately. Like desperate howls emitted by animals before dying. People fell constantly in the pushing and fleeing, and were then trampled to death alive by people behind. Someone even used sabers and spears to hack and stab people in front to open a path.

This madness of survival made Chen Sigen dumbfounded—he had never seen such a cruel battlefield. Although he had once defeated the government troops completely in Chengmai, the battlefield was vast, not like nearly ten thousand people crowded on this sandbar fleeing for their lives.

"All run!" Zhu Mingxia waved the saber in his hand, commanding three companies to run wildly all the way. He was anxious to close the entrance of the sandbar before the routed troops escaped—although this sandbar nearly ten kilometers long was barely passable with ice surfaces on both sides now, as long as the entrance was intercepted, most of the rebel troops this time could be caught.

Killing how many people was not the goal; obtaining how big a benefit was the main thing. Zhu Mingxia knew the Senate's character very well. Fighting and killing, in the final analysis, must have returns. Merely being satisfied with battle merits like "beheading XX heads" was far from enough.

Zhu Mingxia finally arrived at the junction of the sandbar and the mainland with the fastest Light Infantry Company. Because they ran really too fast, the typewriters strengthening the infantry were all left behind.

However, he was still a step late. Before this, a part of the cavalry and troops left at the tail of the column ran out, running wildly all the way to the Huang County seat.

Zhu Mingxia couldn't care about chasing. He ordered the troops to occupy the camp immediately—Mao Chenglu was not mediocre either. Knowing the vital point here, he set up a camp here before the whole army launched the offensive, leaving five hundred combat soldiers, five hundred auxiliary soldiers, and many firearms to guard it, in case the retreat route was lost.

However, at this moment, under the state of central army destruction and whole army collapse, the rebel soldiers guarding the stronghold were already in a state of panic. Some people had already jumped off the stronghold wall to flee. The mobile corps commander guarding the stronghold was Mao Chenglu's trusted aide. Knowing this place was of great importance, he still desperately suppressed the troops.

The Light Infantry Company deployed a skirmish line while marching, first fired a volley, then pounced towards the stronghold with one drum beat of courage. A cannon suddenly rang out on the stronghold wall, and hundreds of various firearms installed on the wall opened fire simultaneously. For a time, smoke filled the air, but it didn't kill or wound many Fubo Army soldiers. Zhu Mingxia sneered disdainfully: It seemed this problem of firing randomly before reaching range couldn't be changed.

Although the rebel soldiers on the stronghold wall fired once, seeing this group of people rushing up fiercely with bird guns fixed with bayonets regardless, and with screams and cries on the sandbar, the already panicked military heart could no longer be maintained. The remaining hundreds of people instantly routed with a boom.

Zhu Mingxia commanded the whole army to break into the stronghold, clearing routed soldiers on one hand, and asking people to switch to the Star and Fist Red Flag on the other. In a twinkling, the main group of routed troops had arrived. Hundreds of people with fast legs had already escaped past the road in front of the stronghold.

"Block the intersection with firepower, bring the amplifier." Zhu Mingxia planted his command saber on the ground excitedly, picked up the microphone of the electro-acoustic amplifier amidst the suddenly erupting volley sound, and roared: "Those who surrender will be spared from death!"

The Qimu Island defensive battle came to a close just like this. Cleaning the battlefield and capturing prisoners continued until night. Except for most of Chen Guangfu's troops fleeing, the rest either died or surrendered. Fewer than two thousand escaped. More than six thousand rebels surrendered. Countless辎重 (*baggage/materiel*) and firearms were captured. The biggest harvest was capturing a large number of horses, donkeys, mules, and cattle.

More than ten generals including Mao Chenglu were killed—all were Thousand-man Commanders and above. Zhu Mingxia ordered the captured rebel soldiers to identify corpses one by one, chopping off all identifiable rebel generals' heads and preserving them with lime. These were prepared as gifts for Sun Yuanhua. Old Sun needed things to show himself to the court very much now.

Rebel prisoners were stripped of armor and tied together with ropes, temporarily detained in the stronghold for open-air guarding—there was no housing, and the island really couldn't stuff so many people.

Regarding the disposal of rebel soldiers, the three had different ideas. Coerced refugees naturally would be transported to Jeju Island, but there was controversy on how to deal with these veteran army ruffians. The simplest was to ship them to Sanya to do coolie work in mines, or slightly better, incorporate them into road construction teams to work and atone for crimes like the prisoners of He Rubin's unit back then.

However, Zhu Mingxia believed that prisoners could be released to avoid reducing rebel combat power excessively, letting the chaos in Dengzhou last longer. Conveniently, they could make contact with Kong Youde, and both sides could have a non-aggression agreement—they could even ask rebel soldiers to gather refugees on their behalf. Anyway, they were very skilled at this hand—and the Australians didn't have to dirty their own hands.

Lu Wenyuan expressed opposition: Rebel coercion of refugees was their basic strategy. Handing refugees to Qimu Island would be equivalent to spitting out part of the benefits, inevitably involving interest exchange issues.

"What do you plan to exchange for refugees?" Lu Wenyuan asked, "Why should they hand over refugees they looted from attacking cities and strongholds to us?"

Using grain, firearms, and gunpowder were all things rebels needed, but Lu Wenyuan felt unwilling. They were also in short supply of these things themselves.

"Exchange?" Zhu Mingxia sneered, "Exchange is guaranteeing the safety of rebel communication lines within Huang County!"
