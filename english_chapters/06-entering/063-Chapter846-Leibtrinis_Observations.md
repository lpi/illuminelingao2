# Chapter 846: Leibtrini's Observations

If I could get such an abundant supply of candy in Italy, opening a shop specializing in serving nobles and dignitaries might well make me rich. But here, candy prices were very cheap. Out of curiosity, Mr. Gonzalez spent one Real and bought a whole large bag of assorted candies. The candies were packaged in small waxed paper bags, very exquisite. The shop gave us a straw-woven bag to carry the candy. This bag alone could be called a work of art.

The most peculiar pastime was their tobacco—you surely know that this plant produced in the New World is currently very popular around the world. People have invented various different ways of using it. But in Lingao, there was a new way of enjoying tobacco. They make tobacco into long paper rolls for sale. White paper is rolled into delicate paper tubes, about as thick as a pen, evenly filled with shredded tobacco inside. They call them "cigarettes." People who smoke mostly use a hollow bamboo, wood, or hard paper tube attached to the cigarette to smoke, to avoid burning their lips when the cigarette is about to burn out.

Cigarettes are sold in packs or boxes of ten or twenty, in various colors and patterns. Although each cigarette looks pretty much the same to us, the prices vary greatly depending on the color and pattern of the packaging. The most expensive pack could buy ten packs of the cheapest cigarettes. Neither Mr. Gonzalez nor I could give a reasonable explanation for this. To us, apart from the packaging, the two seemed to have no obvious difference.

A kind of paper money called "circulation vouchers" is used here. Marco Polo once said that the Tatars used paper money in China. I had always been very skeptical of this—because there is no one in this world who loves silver more than the Chinese—except for very few goods, the Chinese always hope the Company will pay in silver. But in Lingao, they do indeed use paper money. The paper money is beautifully printed, with complex and fine patterns. Especially on the background of the pattern, very delicate line-drawn fine background patterns are traced. Even as a painter, I felt such delicate rendering was beyond my ability. As for what method they use to print the patterns in layers onto the paper, that is an even greater mystery. Obviously, they have very skilled copperplate engravers.

All the shops here accept paper money. Of course, the shopkeepers are also happy to accept our Reals, but when giving change, they can only give paper money. For this reason, we had to buy one Real's worth of things each time to avoid getting a pile of paper money worthless outside of this place. This shopping method ultimately had us returning loaded with goods.

We lingered in every shop. Each one was eye-opening. I can well understand why the Company was so anxious to send a merchant here. Lingao is also a treasure trove of trade; there are many many novel goods here that we have never seen or even heard of.

There are even shops here that sell ready-made clothes—this is truly surprising. Without a tailor measuring and cutting, how could they make clothes that fit? Although Australian clothing by our standards is very crude and shabby. Their clothes don't use woolen cloth, silk, or leather, only cheap Indian or Chinese cotton and linen. The style of clothes is so simple that they are only slightly better than the natives of Batavia. At the reception celebrating the trade agreement, the Australian Senators in attendance almost all wore these crude and shabby clothes—such a custom is truly hard to understand.

The clothes sold at the ready-made clothes shop have no style to speak of. It is said this is the standard clothing of the Australians and their subjects. Except for certain details, they are almost completely identical, and even the colors are limited to just a few: black, gray, blue, and brown.

Regarding the Australians and their subjects, based on my observations, this is the situation:

The Australians have clear requirements for their subjects—the same attire as themselves: including men shaving their hair very short and women keeping short hair. Regardless of gender, all wear "Australian-style" clothing, which is the simple clothing that Australians of all ranks wear, as I described earlier. They call them "uniforms."

Whether it's the native army the Australians recruited and trained locally, their hired workers, farmers who work for them, commercial personnel, or others, all without distinction wear clothing of the same style. Some groups, such as the military, have slightly special clothing. Others are distinguished by various ornaments, markings, and special equipment—similar to our heraldry.

Just as we saw on the night streets, there were special police officers on duty. Their clothes were exactly the same as those sold in the ready-made clothes shop. The conical hat, white leggings, small cloth patch at the collar, and cloth badge on the chest distinguished him from others. Of course, he also had a short wooden club as a weapon.

Using this method, I think the only advantage is that it facilitates mass production. Obviously, the Australians feel they have an obligation to provide clothing for all their subjects. To provide clothing for tens of thousands of people, the style of clothing must be simplified as much as possible to facilitate production.

As for why they provide uniform clothing for their subjects, I haven't figured this out. We initially guessed that perhaps it was to allow the Australians to distinguish their subjects from the local Chinese at a glance—after all, they all have Chinese faces. But this was rejected after Mr. Gonzalez had no difficulty buying a set of the same style of clothing at a clothes store. Obviously, anyone can buy this ugly and simple clothing. And many of the common people we saw on the East Gate Market streets still wore traditional Chinese clothing with topknots.

Aside from reasons we cannot understand, the obvious reason should be that the Australians like uniformity. This can be seen from how they regulate their subjects' attire. Not only that, the various buildings we saw in East Gate Market also revealed a sense of uniformity. Although from the outside, these closely packed buildings were varied and of different heights, from the details, all buildings were constructed following almost identical patterns. In my view, all buildings in East Gate Market were built from the same structures and dimensions in different configurations.

The Australians use completely identical building materials on a large scale. Fired bricks are their most commonly used building material. The main material of all buildings is fired bricks. Most are red, though some are blue. The texture is solid and fine, obviously the result of high-temperature firing. I carefully observed several buildings along the street. They generally use three different sizes of bricks. Each size of brick is used in different parts, but follows the same usage principle on every building. The windows, doors, steps, and railings they use on buildings, based on my observation, can all be attributed to several completely identical types. Obviously, these building accessories are mass-produced at some workshop according to a few fixed sizes and geometric shapes, rather than made on-site by craftsmen. Using this method should speed up the construction of houses. It should be through using such methods that the Australians were able to build a prosperous city here in just a few years.

Unlike the Chinese or European buildings I've seen, East Gate Market houses have almost no decoration at all. Whether on the roofs, eaves, or walls, you can't see a trace of carving, sculpture, or murals. Walls are simply painted white or black, or sometimes bare brick walls are left exposed. In Batavia and along the Chinese coast, I saw that the Chinese love to carve various detailed bas-reliefs or apply various colorful paintings on the beams and columns of their houses. But here, wooden structures are merely coated with the simplest layer of paint.

There is a peculiar sense of uniformity here. After discovering the characteristics of the buildings, I suddenly found that many things in East Gate Market were the same: streetlights, garbage baskets, street signs... even the people walking on the streets were very similar. This is a feeling I cannot describe.

Our walk was very pleasant. No one disturbed us on the main streets, and the shop owners were very friendly. We discovered a holy church in East Gate Market—this truly overjoyed us. You know, in Batavia, the fanatical Puritans don't allow us to pray and force us to hold their prayers. Now, under Australian rule in Lingao, there was actually a church of the Holy Church.

This church, from its appearance, was both simple and elegant. More importantly, it was relatively "non-standard." Its appearance reminded me of the little churches in the small towns of my homeland. The church door was open, and bright light shone from the windows—this was the sacred glow that made us feel warm. We immediately went in.

...

Wu Shimang yawned continuously but still had to put on a serious face. Because he was supervising John Dermot, an apprentice friar from Ireland, painting murals on the wall. The East Gate Market church had recently been renovated—Daoquanzi the Taoist Master had recently renovated an already abandoned old temple in Lingao County town, held a consecration ceremony, making it the official base of the New Taoism. This made him feel competitive, so he cracked down hard on hardware and software construction. The East Gate Market church hadn't been built very long, of course it couldn't be demolished and rebuilt, but Pastor Wu felt the interior of the church was still too simple and lacked impact. The arrival of Jin Lige and others gave him free renovation workers. Painting murals, installing stained glass, and using tiles for interior decoration were all put on the agenda. Shortly after Jin Lige and his apprentice arrived in Lingao, they were put to work on mural painting and interior decoration of the entire monastery.

These two priests worked from dawn to dusk painting murals, sculpting plaster statues, and even reluctantly participated in creating stained glass windows—of course, this wasn't just for religious service. The Propaganda and Architecture departments also needed new art forms for their respective services.
