# Chapter 851 - Reunion

Lü Yizhong's quarters were in a separate courtyard of the Huifu Street compound. This courtyard had originally been prepared for distinguished guests from afar. Besides the main building, there were east and west wings. Lü Yizhong occupied the western wing. The rooms were comfortably arranged, and servants attended to him—but he could not leave. He was effectively under house arrest in this small domain. Looking out from the main room's windows, he could see only a small courtyard planted with flowers and trees.

His mood was rather gloomy. For Lü Yizhong, who had already despaired of ever returning to the mainland, the chance to return to Guangzhou had been tremendous news. Most of the strategists captured during the Chengmai campaign had been ransomed after the peace agreement was reached—except for a few poor scholars from other provinces who had no local relatives or friends in Guangdong. The prisoner camp had become practically empty. Yet Lü Yizhong never dared to write home asking his family to send the ransom money. It was only when his wife, seeing others return one after another while there was no word of her husband, dispatched a house-born servant with silver to Hainan to search for him that she finally received news of him.

Lü Yizhong did not dare return. During his interrogation, he had told his captors everything he knew about Guangdong's officialdom and military. This in itself was not particularly damning—virtually every captive had confessed everything they knew. But out of cowardice and a desire to curry favor with the transmigrators, he had not only written letters to the Governor-General recommending peace negotiations, but had also said things during interrogation that should never have been said. If he returned, the slightest leak of this information would ruin him. Even if the court didn't punish him, he would become a pariah in literati circles—a "traitor" reviled by all.

The Governor-General was gone, and with him Lü Yizhong's greatest patron in official circles. As for the disaster in Qiongzhou, if the court decided to punish anyone, Lü Yizhong would make a perfect scapegoat—the charges were ready-made. Without his patron, those officers who had fled could fabricate whatever accusations they wished against him.

Moreover, the transmigrators had shown no intention of releasing him. Although they permitted his family to send him silver and goods, they never mentioned letting him go home. Even the household servants his wife had sent to attend him were turned away.

This time, an Elder of the Australians had "spoken" with him, ordering him to accompany Guo Yi back to Guangzhou and serve the Australians from now on. Lü Yizhong dared not refuse. He knew perfectly well what the Australians held in their hands. If those materials were released, even if the court didn't investigate, his reputation would be instantly destroyed. For a man who relied on his status and credentials as a literatus to make his living, ruination was terrifying—especially for someone who had attained the *tongshi* degree and served as a prefect twice! At best he would be called "shameless"; at worst, "traitor to imperial favor."

So he had obediently followed Guo Yi and quietly returned to Guangzhou, prepared to serve as Guo Yi's strategist. More precisely, he was to serve as liaison between the Guangzhou Station and the government authorities. Before departure, the Australians had made clear that the Guangdong government would not pursue his case. As long as he faithfully served as go-between, neither the Australians nor the authorities would trouble him.

"...But if you get any strange ideas, not only will we not tolerate it—even His Excellency the Governor-General would probably not be pleased to see you." The transmigrator who spoke with him made this naked threat.

"Yes, yes, this humble one understands!" Lü Yizhong nodded repeatedly. "This humble one is absolutely loyal! Heaven and Earth bear witness!"

The Australians provided him with clothing and luggage, and returned all the silver and goods his wife had sent. However, all his attendants were assigned by the Australians. In fear and melancholy, Lü Yizhong set out on his journey back to Guangzhou.

On the boat to Guangzhou, Guo Yi was reasonably courteous. He would occasionally send over some fruit. Sometimes he even invited Lü Yizhong to dine or take tea together. Looking at this young man from overseas—who just last year had been deferential and nervous in his presence, currying favor with flattering smiles and generous gifts just to obtain a few words or a casually scrawled note from him—now becoming his "master" while Lü Yizhong had to wear a sycophant's smile... the feeling was quite depressing. However, with his many years of experience in officialdom, this sense of loss was easily self-repaired. What worried him most was still his own future.

His official career was finished. Originally, serving a few years as a strategist under Governor Wang, then being recommended for a position—perhaps some provincial office—had been possible. At the very least, he could have obtained a prefectural appointment in the prosperous regions of Guangdong and Guangxi. Serving a few terms, he could have secured adequate provisions for his old age and his descendants. But now that was utterly impossible.

As for finding another position as a strategist elsewhere, with his current reputation, that too would be difficult. Rumors were already circulating that the mastermind behind Governor Wang's reckless military expedition that resulted in the Qiongzhou disaster was his coterie of strategists, who had urged the Governor-General to mobilize troops for their own glory—this narrative wasn't even fabricated by the intelligence department. In Guangdong, plenty of officials were eager to shift blame. With the Governor-General gone, his now-powerless strategists made perfect scapegoats.

So the original cohort of strategists from the Governor-General's staff had all slunk away in disgrace. A few were taken in by other officials; most scattered and left Guangdong. Lü Yizhong, as one of the Governor-General's confidants who had also "fallen into enemy hands," would certainly not be sought out for advice.

"The saying goes, 'Starvation is a small thing, but losing one's integrity is a great matter'—how true!" Lü Yizhong spoke these words with profound bitterness. Having already lost his integrity, his only options were suicide or, if he didn't choose death but still wished to live well, to "sell out." Thinking thus, as if burning his boats, he finally felt slightly more at ease.

"Even if one day the transmigrators can no longer hold Guangzhou, they can certainly still hold onto the island of Qiongzhou. At worst, I'll move my entire family south and spend my remaining years on the island!"

Lü Yizhong had witnessed Lingao's current standard of living and prosperity. If he absolutely had to spend his remaining years there, it wouldn't be a terrible choice.

Upon arriving in Guangzhou, Guo Yi didn't assign him any tasks. He merely told him to write a letter home to reassure his family that he was safe, and to rest at the Huifu Street compound. After that, for several days, there was no summons. In his boredom, despite having already resolved to sell his loyalty, he became paranoid again, fearing the Australians had no intention of using him after all. This made his mood quite low.

Just as boredom was setting in, a call came from the doorway:

"Master!"

The visitor was the manservant the Australians had assigned to attend him. Lü Yizhong knew the man was probably a spy placed at his side. He asked: "What is it?"

"Master Guo instructed this servant to deliver these. He said: please review them over the next two days. Also, he wishes to invite the Master to go out and pay calls together tomorrow. Please make preparations."

What the servant brought were: the newly published *Directory of Officials* from the bookshops, copied *dibao* [official court gazette] from the prefectural offices, and copies of various memorials collected from different sources. He leafed through them. Memorials from the major officials of Guangdong and Guangxi had almost all been copied out, dated within the past few months.

Lü Yizhong understood this was so he could grasp the basic situation of Guangdong and the court, to serve as Guo Yi's consultant. It seemed the Australians might yet make use of him. Thinking this, his formerly gloomy mood improved somewhat.

The next day, Guo Yi and Lü Yizhong changed into two inconspicuous small sedan chairs and proceeded to Lotus Retreat on Henan Island. This was the place where Gao Ju had previously negotiated peace with the naval Pearl River Detachment on behalf of Li Fengjie. Guo Yi was here to meet with Li Xijue to discuss post-war matters.

Li Xijue had originally been part of the Governor-General's staff. Though quite capable, he had been recommended to the Governor-General's staff to participate in important affairs but was not fully trusted. When Li Fengjie assigned him to handle "Australian affairs," it was essentially passing him a hot potato. Throughout Guangdong officialdom, one could find people capable of handling affairs with the Red-Haired and Portuguese foreigners, but not a single person who could handle "Australian affairs."

Li Xijue was the official point of contact with the Australians. The first order of business was "compensation and reparations." Although he wasn't an official himself, he was still Li Fengjie's strategist. Despite everyone being well aware of his role, too much open contact with the Guangzhou Station was inadvisable.

Li Xijue didn't fully understand what agreement his master had reached with the Australians, but even the little he knew would be enough to get someone labeled a "traitor." He had to be especially careful. For safety's sake, both parties had agreed to meet at Lotus Retreat on Henan Island—close to the city yet relatively secluded.

It was at this place that Li Xijue and Lü Yizhong were reunited. Both felt somewhat awkward. In the past, they had worked together in the Governor-General's staff, participating in confidential matters, plotting how to deal with the Australians. Now, both were working with the Australians, smoothing the way for them—there was certainly a sense of fate's irony.

Awkwardness aside, proper business had to be conducted. During their meeting, both parties formally agreed that Lü Yizhong would serve as the liaison for the Australians, while Li Xijue would serve as the liaison for the government side. All negotiations and arrangements would be handled by these two men.

For now, Lotus Retreat would serve as the meeting place for both parties. If a more suitable location was found later, they would change venues.

The Guangdong government guaranteed the personal safety and property of Lü Yizhong and his family.

After these procedural agreements, they turned to the matter of land acquisition—securing land for the "Guangzhou Grand World" project. In terms of the old time-space, this meant obtaining approval for a piece of land for commercial real estate development.

Even in the Ming Dynasty, purchasing land on such a large scale for commercial development was a sensitive matter—especially just outside Guangzhou City! This wasn't merely a question of money. Without the overt or covert support of local authorities, large-scale real estate development would be extremely difficult.

Moreover, while Ming officials were greedy, they weren't stupid. What the Grand World outside Guangzhou was really about—they could figure that out with their toes.

"This matter will be difficult to handle..." Li Xijue drew a sharp breath. "Although you're permitted to purchase land freely in Guangdong, acquiring so much land right outside Guangzhou City, I'm afraid, I'm afraid..." He couldn't think of any specific objection, so finally he just said again, "This will be difficult indeed."
