# Chapter 1028 Prologue

Sea asparagus seeds could also be pressed for oil. Although this year's harvest of sea asparagus seeds was limited, it still provided some precious fats. Lu Wenyuan's three daily meals were cooked with this oil.

The farmstead's lunch was eaten by Lu Wenyuan alone. Though called "special supply," the standard was actually pitiful. The best dish on the table was diced Tianchu Factory cured meat stir-fried with eggs, plus a few vegetable dishes—the so-called vegetables were actually dried vegetables and pickles shipped from Lingao. In November Shandong, there wasn't even a green color to be seen, let alone fresh vegetables. The only thing that could be called fresh vegetables was cellared local napa cabbage. Lu Wenyuan's personal secretary had made a cabbage and dried shrimp soup.

After lunch at the farmstead and a brief rest, Lu Wenyuan immediately went to inspect the refugee camp. The refugee camp was set up in a wind-sheltered, sunny spot on the island—even so, it was still bone-chillingly cold. Because they were temporary buildings, all hastily erected wooden barracks with poor insulation, and what little cotton clothing he had couldn't meet demand—they relied entirely on brick stoves with chimneys in each longhouse for heating. Daily fuel consumption was enormous.

In the desperate lean season, collecting enough firewood was very difficult—there was almost no crop stubble in the fields, and the eastern three prefectures' forest coverage was also low.

Fortunately, there were quite a few coal-producing areas in Shandong, with small coal mines and reasonable prices. Using his connections in the Shandong church, he could conveniently purchase coal and ship it to Longkou by boat.

Upon lifting the thick door curtain of a longhouse, a smell mixing sweat odor, body odor, and coal odor rushed to his nostrils. Lu Wenyuan couldn't help frowning.

He looked up at the long ventilation windows near the roof—fortunately all open, or there really would be deaths. The chimney showed no sign of backdraft either.

The roof was sloped, fitted with several glass skylights—surprising many refugees, who felt this kind Master Lu was extraordinarily extravagant. Actually, it was just to use more sunlight and less fuel.

The walkway was rammed earth. On both sides, floors were raised with dry-stacked mud bricks—below were flues using the stove's excess heat—covered with thick wheat straw and dried seaweed. Refugees huddled together in groups of three to five to maintain warmth.

The room temperature was roughly maintained at around 10 degrees—basically ensuring no one froze to death.

Lu Wenyuan inspected everything. The building held only old people, women, and children. All able-bodied men had been drafted for work. They were currently building an earthwork rampart and ditch protected by a bastion around the refugee camp. The farmstead couldn't do agricultural production in winter, only construction.

After seeing all the buildings, he went to the kitchen to inspect hygiene and ration distribution. They used special relief rations shipped from Hong Kong. Local grain prices were very high and quality poor. Lu Wenyuan had already given up hope of resupplying grain locally.

Besides relief rations, at his request, "milk substitute powder" had also been shipped from Lingao—rice powder with a little sugar, to save as many children as possible.

Lu Wenyuan inspected the kitchen very carefully. He had a clear account in mind: The Cheka had tables quantifying every type of relief food consumption down to the gram, requiring each kitchen to strictly follow them.

Accounts and inventory showed no problems. Finally, he particularly noted whether the naturalized citizen cooks had any signs of gaining weight, wondering whether to weigh them—like all Senators, Lu Wenyuan didn't believe in the power of morality. Leaving the kitchen, he asked his entourage for the hundredth time: "Any new news?"

"Reporting Chief, nothing yet."

"Mm." A gust of cold wind blew. Lu Wenyuan couldn't help shrinking his neck and tightening his cloak—Little Ice Age winters were no joke! He discovered he'd developed chilblains: his feet were painful and itchy. Health Department's chilblain cream had no noticeable effect.

More worrying than the severe cold was, based on his experience, if temperatures had already dropped this low in early November, by the coldest period, Longkou Bay's surface might freeze.

If it was just thin ice, that wouldn't be too bad. Lu Wenyuan was afraid the sea surface would eventually freeze solid enough for people to walk on. Shallow, relatively enclosed bays easily froze thick. The Bohai Bay still froze extensively in winters even into the 21st century. If that happened, the Willow Palisade he'd set up on the sand dike would lose its ability to delay enemies, and the farmstead and refugee camp would be directly exposed to enemy attack. The fortifications he was rushing to build were precisely for this concern.

His gaze turned to the beach. Besides women working on the sand—harvesting kelp, drying seaweed—a team of strong men was running along the beach in sleeveless undershirts in the cold wind, shouting cadences. A stocky man with a bowl cut, also wearing an undershirt, ran alongside, occasionally shouting loudly.

This was Chen Sigen's Special Reconnaissance Team squad, which had arrived not long ago and was intensively conducting cold-resistance training. Their presence reassured Lu Wenyuan somewhat—the machine guns they were equipped with were truly fearsome weapons.

Due to weather effects, the originally planned Northern Expedition Detachment's Shandong Contingent, supposed to arrive a week ago, hadn't crossed on schedule. Currently the main force was still stuck in Taiwan. Only an advance company carrying four 48-pounder naval guns had landed on the scheduled date and was now urgently constructing gun emplacements.

He checked his watch. Today was already November 1, 1631. According to the normal historical track, yesterday—October 31, 1631—Kong Youde, sent by Sun Yuanhua to reinforce Ming forces in Liaodong, was on his return march through Wuqiao when, due to supply shortages, his soldiers "requisitioned locally" and clashed with local gentry. The whole army became restless, Kong Youde was seized, and the mutiny erupted. A rebellion lasting nearly two years—the Dengzhou Rebellion—officially began.

Although Qimu Island was quite remote, it belonged to Huangxian County, precisely where rebels and government troops would repeatedly struggle. Given the rebels' high mobility with their mainly cavalry force, no one could guarantee the war wouldn't reach here. Lu Wenyuan needed sufficient means of self-protection—especially now with the Northern Expedition Detachment not yet in position.

He gazed out to sea, hoping to see fleet black smoke and sails on the horizon, but there was nothing—the sea was empty.

Lu Wenyuan sighed and walked back. On the bastion, soldiers were enthusiastically doing artillery drill training. Some had simply taken off their thick wool coats and trained in just undershirts. But this atmosphere didn't infect him. He returned gloomily to the farmstead's conference room and once again asked his secretary "if there was any new news from Taiwan."

"No new news." The secretary replied, but added a new development: Ten minutes ago, a telegram had come from Yizhou.

The telegram asked about Qimu Island refugee camp's reception capacity. If possible, he planned to transfer some refugees to Qimu Island.

Daoist Zhang had achieved brilliant results in the Yizhou direction. Using the power of the Zhuang clan of Dadianzhang, he had not only established a firm foothold but was also successfully conducting refugee collection in the name of charity. Not long ago, he had experimentally sent a batch of refugees to Qimu Island to verify whether his planned refugee transport route was feasible.

"Reply to Yizhou: Temporarily don't send more refugees. The current Shandong situation is unclear, and roads may be difficult to keep open..."

He was dictating the reply when Chen Sigen walked in—this fitness trainer-turned-muscular man had a well-proportioned build and rosy face. While wiping sweat with a towel, he smiled and said: "Want to join me for daily sauna then fitness training? Guaranteed to warm you up, not afraid of cold all winter."

"Thanks, but I don't plan to steam myself then freeze." Lu Wenyuan said weakly, taking out a stamp from his inner pocket and pressing it on the telegram. "Send it immediately."

After Chen Sigen arrived on Qimu Island, he had immediately had a sauna room built for himself, taking soldiers for saunas daily, then leading them running in the wilderness wearing undershirts—according to him, this was the best way to boost human cold resistance: Finns and Russians both loved saunas.

Lu Wenyuan sent the secretary away, then said to Chen Sigen: "Old Chen, if the rebels attack now, do you think we can hold?"

Chen Sigen started, then immediately laughed: "It's not whether we can hold—it's how we can fight more beautifully..."

"That's a bit of big talk—Kong Youde has at least 2,000-plus elite Liaodong cavalry after all."

"Has cavalry ever heard machine guns?" Chen Sigen said. "Never mind machine guns. My squad is all automatic weapons. Basically after one round of concentrated fire, the enemy will definitely scatter. Fighting a battle of annihilation would be hard, but fighting a rout is no problem." He slapped Lu Wenyuan's shoulder—so hard he almost fell over. "Besides, there's also the advance company and those few cannons. That alone is enough to give Kong Youde a handful."

Although Chen Sigen said this, Lu Wenyuan was still somewhat worried. He had already dispatched scouts to watch the main road to Huangxian daily, to detect the rebels' approach in time.

Chen Sigen, however, wasn't interested in Kong Youde—Kong Youde's fate had been decided when the Senate decided to intervene. He was leading the Special Reconnaissance Team to participate in Operation Engine not only to provide special operations support for the entire operation, but also with another mission.

The Operation Engine Command's basic attitude toward the Dengzhou Rebellion was "orderly chaos"—meaning the upheaval should be expanded throughout the entire eastern three prefectures, creating as many refugees as possible, then collecting them. However, their troop projection and personnel transport capacity was ultimately limited. Each period could only evacuate limited numbers. To avoid losing too many people and social wealth, the chaotic situation also had to be controlled and "rhythmic"—ensuring places that should be chaotic were completely chaotic, while places that shouldn't be chaotic absolutely weren't.
