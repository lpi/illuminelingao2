# Chapter 837: Each with Their Own Thoughts

Beikai stood on the watchtower of the corner bastion. Without binoculars, he could see the bandits marching slowly in the distance, clustered in twos and threes like scattered goat droppings.

He had known yesterday that the bandits' target was Hongji—a large group of people had gathered openly with weapons not more than twenty li from here; their intentions were obvious. Moreover, a letter had been sent from Haiyang a few days ago, warning him to be on alert in Hongji: bandit gangs were recruiting on a large scale, preparing to "pull off a big job."

"Alert, alert—am I supposed to defend Hongji with thirty men?" Beikai muttered, complaining. Of course, he also had Zhang Dabala and the sailors from the *Zhennan* and several small boats under his command. Although Dabo Shipping was "civilian shipping," the sailors on board were all paramilitary personnel trained by the Navy. Many were even experienced old pirates, quite capable in combat.

The three hundred-plus naturalized citizen laborers had received some military training and had the necessary weapons and equipment. When fighting started, they could all serve as militia. Combined with Hongji Fort's own cannons and the *Zhennan*'s support from the sea, the possibility of Hongji Fort being breached was extremely low. But Hongji was not just a single fort; it was an urban area consisting of one fort, two camps, and a commercial street. Concentrating the naturalized citizen laborers to hold Hongji Fort would certainly be foolproof, but the two local laborer camps and the commercial street would suffer devastation. Unlike the naturalized citizens, although the local laborers felt working here was good, they had served the Lingao regime for a very short time and lacked sufficient identification with it. They hadn't undergone rigorous military training either, and their organization, discipline, and determination to resist were all low. Once the bandits arrived, they would scatter and flee.

The local workers were now the main force for mining coal. If they all ran away, Hongji's production would drop by at least two-thirds. The commercial street and laborer camps, which had taken shape, would be destroyed by the bandits and would take time to recover. There were also the small railway tracks laid to the mine pits, the makeshift derricks and manual hoists installed at the pit edges for lifting. These things were all easily destroyed by bandits. Once the facilities were damaged, the entire coal mine's production efficiency would plummet.

The most dangerous thing was that the scattered workers would spread the news of Hongji being attacked. If the bandits also massacred many local workers in revenge, it would be very difficult to recruit local laborers in the future. After all, nobody wanted to live constantly under the blade.

Beikai felt it was a dilemma. He immediately gathered Dugu Qiuhun, Bai Guoshi, and Zhao Xue who were in Hongji, and held a Senators' meeting to respond. Zhang Dabala and the marine platoon leader also attended this meeting.

The meeting decided to immediately move all laborers from the quarantine camp into the laborer camp, abandoning the quarantine camp to reduce the area to be defended. All naturalized citizen laborers would be armed; some would remain to guard Hongji Fort, and some would guard the laborer camp. The straight-line distance from the laborer camp to Hongji Fort was only 250 meters. Hongji Fort's artillery could effectively assist in defending the laborer camp.

Additional protective trenches would be dug around the laborer camp and outside Hongji Fort and filled with seawater. A large number of standardized bamboo stakes that had been shipped in would also be planted. The goods and equipment in the shops and cafeteria would naturally be evacuated and hidden. Beikai originally wanted the sailors and cannons from the *Zhennan* and other ships to go ashore to strengthen the defense, but Zhang Dabala dissuaded him.

Zhang Dabala believed the enemy was very likely to attack by both land and sea. Removing the sailors and cannons was tantamount to self-crippling. Once the sea was blockaded by the enemy, they would have nowhere to escape. Second, the ships could maneuver along the coast and use artillery to strike enemies attempting to outflank to the side of Hongji Fort. This would limit the directions from which they could attack the fortress, essentially reducing the defensive pressure on Hongji Fort itself.

As for the marines, Zhang Dabala believed there was no need to keep them in Hongji Fort. The marines could board the small boats, maneuver at sea, and wait for opportunities. Once they found an opening, the marines could rapidly land and launch a fierce attack from the bandits' weak point.

This proposal was quite unexpected to Beikai. In his view, concentrating all forces inside the fortress to resist was the best approach—after all, reinforcements from Lingao would arrive in a day and a night at most. Sending troops out for "rear attacks" and "mobile warfare" made him hesitate.

Zhang Dabala's thinking was different: Zhang Dabala certainly also knew Hongji couldn't be breached, but he was a recently defected dragon-following personnel. His eagerness to "perform meritorious deeds" was much greater than a Senator like Beikai. Killing as many enemies as possible was the way to demonstrate Hongji's capabilities. How could they just cry for help and wait for reinforcements?

The marine platoon leader also agreed with Zhang Dabala's idea, and his proposal went even further. They would bring the 12-pounder mountain howitzer along, plus a few laborers to push the cannon. Whether on the ship or after landing, the mountain howitzer that two or three people could push while running could provide tremendous fire support.

"Besides the gunners, add ten laborers to move with us, each carrying 2 portions of ammunition. Bring some more on the ship. 10 canisters, 4 shells, and 6 solid shots." The marine ensign gestured.

Bai Guoshi strongly supported Zhang Dabala's idea. He was young and spirited, and training with the Long-Range Exploration Team had given him both muscles and courage. He was no longer the pitiful university deadbeat of the past. He wanted very much to show off some military prowess for everyone to see—and incidentally for Zhao Xue to see. Courage and violence had always been the peacock's tail for men.

Zhao Xue wasn't interested in fighting and opposed going out to fight. But Dugu Qiuhun was extremely interested in going out to fight and resolutely demanded to go out to "fight to the death." Of course, his purpose was to obtain political capital for his "comeback." To return to a violence agency, "military merit" was the most persuasive.

Four Senators, two votes to two, couldn't make a decision under the system of collective Senator decision-making for major events. However, Bai Guoshi, Zhao Xue, and Dugu Qiuhun were strictly speaking all temporarily dispatched. The only Senator at Hongji Station was Beikai; he had the authority to make the final decision.

In the end, Beikai decided to adopt Zhang Dabala's suggestion. The marine platoon and Dabo Shipping's ships would be responsible for outer-line maneuvering, waiting for opportunities to launch flank and rear attacks. The Senators would hold the camps. Dugu Qiuhun volunteered to lead a team to guard the laborer camp alone, and Beikai agreed—he didn't want to invite Zhao Xue's tears by sending Bai Guoshi.

The entire Hongji Mine was rapidly mobilized. The naturalized citizen laborers all had arms and organization and were immediately armed and deployed by company. The main force was placed in Hongji Fort; one company was placed in the laborer camp. Dugu Qiuhun dressed for battle: wearing an 80-style steel helmet, donning the Senator-exclusive steel plate chest armor, with a Wenzhou-made Japanese tachi in his right hand and a GLOCK 17 pistol with an extended magazine in his left. He majestically ascended the walls of the laborer camp. Below, a dense crowd of local laborers had already gathered, with a dozen translators who understood Chinese and the local language scattered around.

The local laborers were gathered together and informed that a large band of bandits was about to arrive in Hongji. The laborers became agitated. But after being intimidated with words like "The bandits are only seven or eight li away. If you run out on your own, you're delivering yourselves to death," no one dared to run—after all, hiding in the stockade when bandits came was the safest thing. Some laborers had brought their families; women, children, and elderly would hardly escape from the bandits' clutches.

"Don't worry about the bandits coming. I'll lead everyone to beat them back!" Dugu Qiuhun struck a confident pose, waving the tachi in his hand. "Everyone work together, defend the stockade, and you'll protect the mine and yourselves! Anyone who doesn't put effort into defending the stockade and killing enemies knows what the consequences will be if the bandits break through!"

Then Dugu Qiuhun ordered equipment to be distributed to the able-bodied—all hastily assembled. Each able-bodied man got a rattan safety helmet, originally work hats for naturalized citizen laborers. With battle imminent, the naturalized citizen laborers had all switched to "combat helmets" with cross-shaped reinforcing steel on top. The swapped-out ones were given to local laborers. Hastily processed wooden boards or rattan mats were hung on their bodies as makeshift armor. Small wooden boards were also strapped to their arms as shields. There weren't enough standard spears for the local laborers, so a batch of sharpened and fire-hardened bamboo and wooden spears were hastily made. Some laborers were equipped with various mining tools, which could be used for close combat if necessary.

Then the local laborers were partly arranged at the stockade entrance and partly deployed on the outer slope of the earthen walls. On the outer slope, protective barriers were erected using woven rattan and wooden boards. On top of the earthen walls was the naturalized citizen laborer company—they served as reserves and supervisory troops.

"If you don't want to die! Use the tools in your hands to poke the enemies out!" Dugu Qiuhun roared murderously, waving his tachi. "Otherwise once the bandits break in, your whole family dies! Don't be afraid! If one dies, Hongji Mining Bureau will support his wife and children for life! If you're wounded, we'll treat you! Beat back the bandits, and one month's wages are doubled! Anyone who goes soft, becomes a traitor, or creates chaos in the ranks—don't blame us for being ruthless; we'll shove a spear up his backside first!"

A dozen translators shouted the translation together. The local laborers, seeing the naturalized citizens all equipped and murderous, knew these Chinese were going to use them as cannon fodder, but didn't dare resist. Resisting meant death too. Better to beat back the bandits and have a chance to live.

Beikai ordered all the grenades that had been shipped in to be distributed. A total of five hundred grenades were equipped to the militia among the naturalized citizen laborers—they had received at least one live-fire throwing training. To strengthen Hongji Fort's firepower, the typewriter from the *Zhennan* was also dismounted and installed on Hongji Fort's watchtower.

Hongji Station's small flotilla consisted of the *Zhennan* and four other small boats. The ships were already fully equipped every day. The marine platoon and the mountain howitzer boarded one longboat. Three other longboats provided cover. The *Zhennan* directly covered Hongji Station's coastline, stopping all sea-based attacks.
