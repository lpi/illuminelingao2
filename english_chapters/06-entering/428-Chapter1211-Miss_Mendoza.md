# Chapter 1211 - Miss Mendoza

Doña Marina de Arellano waited for what seemed like an eternity, so long that her whole body began to ache before a young woman finally appeared.

Marina studied this young "lady" or "miss"—it was hard to say what her true status might be. If this was a pirate den, the newcomer was surely a woman of low birth. Yet her clothing and appearance suggested noble origins—perhaps a lady or noblewoman?

Behind her followed two young Asian women wearing the pirates' short, simple cotton clothes belted at the waist. Each had a tan, nearly triangular rigid leather pouch at her hip—identical to those many of the male pirates wore.

Marina based her assessment on the woman's attire. To her, Miss Mendoza's clothes were designed in a most peculiar, even frivolous manner, yet exquisitely made. The special fabric was dazzling—neither cotton nor silk. Indeed, not even the finest Italian, French, or Chinese silks possessed the unique texture and luster of her garments.

The lady was strikingly beautiful—even by aristocratic standards, her looks were rare. A beautiful mane of thick, slightly curling brown hair; large almond-colored eyes... Though her dark pupils and slightly olive complexion suggested she was probably a *criolla*—perhaps in her mid-twenties.

Yet of the *criollos* Marina knew—even second and third generation ones whose bloodlines had mixed no further with indigenous blood since the original mixing—none could compare to the woman before her. She seemed to combine all the best features of the white and yellow races.

She was taller than Marina, taller even than many men. She stood very straight, her gait light yet dignified. Her whole being radiated health and vitality. Every gesture brimmed with confidence. Her posture, her bearing, even the way she held her head—all silently proclaimed to the world: *I am a person of consequence. Noble blood flows through my veins.*

Yet why was she here? A *criolla* noblewoman trapped in this pirate lair—Miss Marina couldn't help but feel a twinge of pity for her.

Miss Mendoza had served as translator when the prisoners were first captured and when they arrived at Lingao, so Marina was somewhat familiar with her. Since her Spanish was fluent—her native tongue—she had been given a mission by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau: take Marina through purification, accompany her, and try to extract as much information as possible.

"I don't expect you'll get much useful intelligence from her. Just try to find out her background and purpose in going to Manila."

"If you think the information I obtain isn't sufficient, will you interrogate her?" Miss Mendoza asked nervously.

"Every prisoner gets interrogated." Li Yan said with a reassuring smile.

"What I mean is..." Miss Mendoza hesitated. "Will you... um... use torture on her?"

"Diana!" Zhou Weisen, who had accompanied her to the Intelligence Bureau, called out anxiously.

"It's fine." Li Yan continued smiling. "No, we won't. We don't approve of such primitive methods—there are many ways to make someone talk." He continued: "Of course, the better your work, and the more cooperative she is, the less need there'll be for certain interrogation techniques. Rest assured—that's not a euphemism."

And so Mendoza had come here with mixed feelings to "serve the Senate."

The *criolla* noblewoman made a gesture and said in Spanish: "Please come with me."

Marina rose hesitantly—after sitting so long, she was indeed curious to see what the other woman had in mind.

The Widow Tolosa hastily stood up, apparently intent on continuing her duties. Miss Mendoza made a polite gesture of refusal: "Please wait here."

"This is my duty," the Widow Tolosa said nervously.

"Here, you'd better follow our arrangements." Miss Mendoza's linguistics background served her well—her Spanish was elegant, polite, yet authoritative. "You are our prisoner."

The Widow Tolosa seemed suddenly jolted awake. She stopped in her tracks, standing there dumbstruck, watching helplessly as her charge was led away.

Miss Mendoza led her down a corridor with doors on both sides. After several turns, she opened one of them. When they emerged, they were in a courtyard with walls whitewashed like those of Spain. In the center stood a simple-looking two-story red brick building with a roof of some unknown material—round pipes covered the entire roof, shining brightly like metal, though with a softer luster. *Could it be glass?*

From the unusual design and materials, she could immediately tell this building was newly constructed. The sheet-metal pipes jutting from the building and extending into the sky still gleamed, not yet weathered by time or elements.

The *criolla* noblewoman opened the door—which surprised Marina greatly, since the two pirate maids clearly standing beside her made no move to open it first. This prompted a mixture of pity and contempt for Mendoza.

"Please come in." Mendoza was unaware of her complex feelings—years of noble education in the convent had taught the aristocratic girl well how to conceal her emotions. Her face was calm as still water.

"May I ask your name?"



"I am Diana Mendoza."

No "Doña," no "De"—though the Mendoza surname was quite prominent in the Americas. So she was a commoner. Marina thought this and couldn't help but show a hint of haughtiness.

Entering, they were in another corridor lined with doors. The floor was laid with fired clay tiles; moisture seemed to seep through the gaps. Brilliant sunlight streamed through glass windows.

Mendoza checked the metal tag on one door, then unlocked it with a key and ushered her inside.

Behind the door was a strange room—very strange. Marina had seen nothing like it in either the New World or Spain. The room was not large, but the walls and floor were covered with a material more crystalline and beautiful than the finest marble. Beautiful patterns and designs adorned it, somewhat reminiscent of the Moorish mansions she'd visited with her father in Spain. Yet compared to the Moors' mosaics and colored tiles, this material was even more captivating. Suddenly she remembered—*porcelain!*

The officials and notables of Spain and New Spain always collected Chinese porcelain to flaunt their wealth and artistic taste.

She suddenly understood—she was standing in a room lined entirely with porcelain.

At the realization, she nearly fainted. *Could this really be some pirate island from the stories of Ali Baba?*

"Please bathe here," Miss Mendoza said. "If you need to relieve yourself, the door on the left leads to the... toilet." Mendoza hesitated, not using the polite modern term "washroom."

*Bathe?* How ridiculous. She was a refined and noble lady who washed her face and hands daily, her feet at night, and changed her undergarments every fortnight even when shipboard laundering was inconvenient.

Bathing was a habit only Jews had. And doctors and priests alike said frequent bathing made one susceptible to the Black Death.

"Please don't trouble yourself," Marina said graciously. "I washed my hands and face every day aboard ship."

Miss Mendoza shook her head regretfully. She said nothing. But suddenly the door opened, and four Asian women entered. They were each short but sturdy and powerful, sleeves rolled up, carrying small wicker baskets and wooden buckets.

Marina sensed danger. She stepped back fearfully and said loudly: "Please don't do this!"

"I don't wish to either," Miss Mendoza replied politely.

Marina suddenly realized she had fallen into the hands of Arab slave traders! She had heard stories from people ransomed from North Africa about the harems of Arabs and Turks—every Islamic grandee's harem supposedly had great bathhouses where slave girls bathed daily, were perfumed and massaged, awaiting their master's favor...

She screamed and turned to flee. But the door behind her was locked tight—no amount of effort could open it.

*And even if I could open it*, she thought, *what then? Two more pirate women surely stand guard outside.*

She turned to face Mendoza—this Spanish-speaking woman of noble bearing had suddenly become her only hope. She reached out both hands, pleading:

"For God's sake, save me!"

Mendoza stopped the eager female workers from proceeding with "purification." She took Marina's hands.

"Don't be afraid... we won't harm you. But you must follow my instructions. Otherwise..."

"Yes, yes, yes," Marina said in terror. At the thought of becoming a slave in an infidel harem, she could barely control herself and stammered incoherently: "Please tell your master—I am the daughter of Spanish nobility. My father has ample gold to pay ransom. Please don't sell me to the Arabs... give me time—I'll write a letter to Manila, to New Spain..."

"Please calm yourself," Mendoza said. "You are now the Senate's prisoner. Your fate must be decided by the Senate. Until then, you must obey me completely. Do you understand?"
