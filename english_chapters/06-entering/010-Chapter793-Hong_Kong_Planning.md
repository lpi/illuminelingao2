# Chapter 793 – Hong Kong Planning

Through the Agricultural People's Committee's active efforts, combined with Ye Yuming's vigorous lobbying in the Ministry of Colonial Trade, the concept of implementing an agricultural reclamation system on Hong Kong Island finally won the Planning Academy's approval. However, the proposal to set up an Agricultural Reclamation Division within the Agricultural Committee was rejected by the Organization Department. Ming Lang required the Agricultural Committee to first submit a series of materials detailing the reasons for the Division's specific organizational structure, staffing quotas, operational procedures, and personnel allocation plans. Only after these materials were complete could the approval process begin.

Ming Lang gave Wu Nanhai a pile of "standard materials," telling him to fill them out following the format. Wu Nanhai naturally pushed this pile of paperwork onto Ye Yuming—who asked him to be so enthusiastic about the reclamation project?

Though the organization wasn't formally established, the team was set up first. Ye Yuming originally wanted to create something like the Production and Construction Corps, using names like "17th Regiment of the 3rd Agricultural Division," but the military expressed differing opinions. Dongmen Chuiyu stated that while the Agricultural Reclamation system could use military organizational principles and the Training Inspectorate could provide necessary assistance, its structure and nomenclature must be distinguished from the Army.

The final decision for the formal designation of the reclamation system in Hong Kong was "1st Regiment, 1st South China Agricultural Reclamation Division," publicly known as the Hong Kong Reclamation Regiment.

"In terms of rank, by past standards, it would be county-regiment level, I suppose," Ye Yuming said.

Wu Nanhai said, "Rank doesn't matter. The first regimental commander should be an elder anyway. I just have one worry: where will the immigrants come from?"

Lingao itself was still absorbing massive numbers of immigrants. With control over Hainan Island established and development deepening, the demand for outside immigrants would only grow. Where would they find immigrants to fill the blank spot of Hong Kong?

Ye Yuming said, " recruit locally from Guangdong. Hong Kong's population carrying capacity isn't high; its development potential is very limited. The original inhabitants plus a small number of immigrants will satisfy Hong Kong's own needs."

Originally, the Planning Academy, Ministry of Colonial Trade, Ministry of Light Industry, and Ministry of Agriculture all had high hopes for Hong Kong, wanting to build it into a model city like a new-era "Pearl of the Orient." But Wu De retrieved several 1:200,000 maps of Hong Kong from the old time-space via the Grand Library: urban transport maps, geological maps, topographic maps. The latest maps drawn by the survey team in this time-space were also brought for comparison. A group of analysts reviewed all data on Hong Kong's population, minerals, industry, and agriculture in the Grand Library. The result: Hong Kong Island's development potential was pitifully small.

The island lacked open space; flat land was basically concentrated along Victoria Harbor. The narrow, strip-like terrain made it difficult to supply enough land for industry and agriculture beyond building wharves.

The most fatal problem was water shortage. The island relied mainly on several reservoirs built in the mountains. The 20th-century Hong Kong government vigorously protected mountain vegetation to increase water retention and built multiple reservoirs. Even so, the island's water supply could barely support port operations. In the 1960s, a severe water shortage occurred, forcing rationing. Modern Hong Kong's water supply relied entirely on pipelines from the mainland.

Consequently, parties who had ambitiously wanted to launch heavy industry, especially shipbuilding, in Hong Kong were deflated. Industry was a water-guzzler; without sufficient fresh water, production couldn't run. The industrial sector had planned to build shipyards on the island to utilize Guangdong's abundant labor and timber for mass shipbuilding, rapidly expanding Lingao's transport fleet. Now they found this plan very difficult to implement.

According to Planning Academy estimates, if shipyards were to be built in Hong Kong, they could only be on the north shore of Victoria Harbor, the Kowloon Tong area. But Kowloon Tong wasn't much better than the island itself; local water sources were equally insufficient for industry, and flat land was very limited.

Whether for industry or agriculture, Hong Kong was not a suitable location. Lack of water, energy, land—specifically flat land... Before 1949, Hong Kong's economic level not only lagged behind Shanghai but also fell short of Guangzhou. Hong Kong's rise to an international metropolis and "Pearl of the Orient" in the late 20th century relied on the immense benefits of being the sole window for East-West interaction after 1949, as well as the mainland's supply of energy, fresh water, and food to maintain that "window."

Of course, if one invested heavily, developing Hong Kong into an commercial-industrial base was possible. But the Planning Academy's research concluded such investment had little value—by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the Transmigrator Group's situation would inevitably expand to Guangzhou. Any investment or construction in Guangzhou would be far more convenient than in Hong Kong.

After several consecutive work meetings, Wu De determined: Hong Kong's role was a trade window, military base, and logistics hub.

Geographically, Hong Kong sat at the Pearl River estuary. A fleet based there could screen the Pearl River, preventing hostile forces from raiding the riverbanks. With government troops defeated by the elders and village self-defense systems destroyed, if pirates seized the chance to enter, the economy and livelihood along the Pearl River would be severely damaged.

As a deterrent to Guangdong: should any disturbance occur in Guangzhou, an intervention fleet from Hong Kong could reach the city walls in a day and night—a vastly faster reaction time than departing from Lingao after receiving news.

Hong Kong lay midway on the Xiamen-Hainan route. If the Zheng fleet wanted to attack the transmigrators, it would be hard to evade the Hong Kong fleet's surveillance, giving the transmigrators early warning. And if the transmigrators wanted to attack the Zheng family, Hong Kong was an excellent forward base; massive supplies could be sourced locally without shipping from Hainan, halving the supply line.

With this tone set, Hong Kong's development plan was scaled back. For industry, after the Ministry of Colonial Trade's strenuous efforts, a shipyard project was retained. Using nearby timber and manpower to mass-produce transport ships remained attractive to the Planning Academy, and the shipyard could service passing vessels.

The Ministry of Light Industry had planned a food processing plant, but due to water shortages, it was temporarily cancelled, pending the survey team's investigation of fresh water resources. The Agricultural Committee's reclamation plan was kept. Reclamation was more political than economic; the settlements themselves bore garrison duties.

Based on Hong Kong's terrain and Lingao's current economic scale and capacity, the Planning Academy decided development would concentrate north and south of Victoria Harbor—specifically the small alluvial plain on the island's north side and the gentle slopes of Kowloon Tong.

The naval patrol fleet already stationing there was reorganized into the Hong Kong Flotilla, establishing the Hong Kong Base Force. They were stationed at Kennedy Town (Xihuan) on the south shore of Victoria Harbor. For land defense, besides outposts already established by the Pearl River Detachment at Lei Yue Mun, Kap Shui Mun, and Fan Kwai Tong, permanent fortresses would be built at North Point and Lung Fu Shan in Kennedy Town, forming initial east and west strongpoints. A simple road would connect them for troop mobility. Several outposts along this road would make it a defense line protecting the Victoria Harbor development zone.

The original Base 852 in Central would be expanded into a major trade base, with customs, warehouses, civilian passenger/cargo wharves, fishing wharves, markets, the shipyard, and aquatic processing plants.

The Lung Fu Shan military base in Kennedy Town would house the Army and Navy Garrison Command, radio station, military depots, and naval wharf.

Grain, vegetable, and poultry supplies for the island would come mainly from reclamation in Kowloon Tong. The Reclamation Regiment would be distributed across Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the outlying islands: Kowloon Tong, Tseung Kwan O, Kwai Chung, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Tung Chung, etc., building fortified walled villages for concentrated living, engaging mainly in fishing, vegetable farming, and animal husbandry. Each walled village would serve as a Battalion HQ, with companies or platoons below. Each company would build a village centered on a blockhouse. The reclamation teams would adopt a soldier-citizen system with core militia. Not only immigrants but local villages would also be "reclamation-ized." Smaller villages would be abolished and merged according to the "concentration of villages" principle.

In the Tung Chung area of Lantau Island, a large purification camp would be established. Immigrants from Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian would first undergo purification here before distribution. The Taiwan development plan would soon be on the agenda; a purification camp on Lantau would shorten the sea voyage for immigrants.

The garrison force would consist of one Army battalion (three infantry companies and one artillery company), one Navy Base Force, and one Navy Flotilla. The Base Force would include a marine company for rapid response.

"These forces are enough for the initial stage," Dongmen Chuiyu said while explaining the garrison plan. "Reclamation points have militia to mobilize. Even if they can't serve as combat troops, they're sufficient for labor and logistics."

Si Kaide proposed: given the current troop shortage, besides arming farm workers, they could recruit 5-6 companies of Li and Miao mercenaries to station at mountain passes in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island as mountain guard units, blocking invasion routes for Ming troops or large pirate bands. Arms could be simplified: bows, crossbows, machetes, and a few grenades.

"Five or six hundred Li and Miao people in a separate unit? I think that's inappropriate," Wu Nanhai objected immediately. "Even if we recruit them, they should serve dispersed within the Army."

"We'll discuss that later," Dongmen Chuiyu said. "Utilizing the Li and Miao population probably isn't that simple."
