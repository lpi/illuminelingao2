# Chapter 1141 - The Dutch Guests

"Espionage is certain. Never mind this era; even centuries later, diplomats still have the duty to gather intelligence," Wei Bachi said dismissively. "Anyway, show them some muscle. Maybe in the future, we can just tell the Dutch to get the hell out of Tayouan without us having to use force."

What everyone was most interested in was the "little foreign mare"—the Committee members had been puzzled why the Dutch would bring children all the way to East Asia. Hearing Dr. Zhong explain it was for vaccination, they were relieved. After all, in this era where everyone from emperors and nobles to commoners turned pale at the mention of "blossoms" [smallpox], a medical technique preventing infection was reason enough to take such risks.

Moreover, given their status, while the sea voyage was arduous, they weren't wretched sailors or petty merchants. They didn't have to risk riding broken ships that needed constant pumping to stay afloat, nor would they die from long-term consumption of poor food or overwork. Their safety was still somewhat guaranteed.

"speaking of which, what exactly are their identities?" Wei Bachi asked.

"According to the messenger from Tayouan, Huygens' father comes representing the Prince—meaning he represents the government of the Seven Provinces, not the East India Company. As for Mr. Bontekoe, he's a Senior Merchant of the East India Company, at least the same rank as Hans Putmans here."

"I still don't understand why the Dutch would send a diplomat and a Senior Merchant to Taiwan? And specifically send a ship? Just to send their children for cowpox vaccination and incidentally look at our construction achievements? The Dutch aren't crazy, are they?" Liu Zheng still felt it was strange.

"I think their purpose is to negotiate with the Shogunate to resolve the Hamada Yahei incident." Wei Bachi had considered this issue many times. He said, "From 1626 to now, Japanese-Dutch trade has been suspended. According to historical trends, it was indeed settled this year with a final Dutch compromise."

Put this way, everyone felt more relieved. Trade with Japan was indeed the Dutch East India Company's most important commercial activity in East Asia; one could imagine their urgency to resolve this issue.

"The only thing I find strange is this Dutch government representative—Mr. Constantijn Huygens isn't an East India Company employee, and the United Government of the Seven Provinces generally doesn't interfere in the Company's Asian activities."

Li Di said, "Huygens should be aiming more at us—after all, we're already a major power in East Asia now."

"That's also possible." Wei Bachi nodded. "Let's entertain them and see what tricks they can play."

Then he said to Zhong Lishi, "I'll leave this matter to you. I see you're very interested in Papa Huygens..."

Zhong Lishi hurriedly defended himself: "I'm interested in his son..." Suddenly realizing this sounded improper, he quickly changed tack: "They are guests; naturally, we must fulfill our duties as hosts." Then he looked at the other Committee members and said earnestly, "They are guests. We absolutely must not do anything to scare them—be dignified."

On the spot, all Committee members declared they were "delighted to have friends coming from afar" and absolutely harbored no "zombie" thoughts, claiming to be "gentlemen" of the Committee, and so on. Then they unanimously agreed to hold a grand reception to entertain the distinguished Dutch guests. Wei Bachi was particularly enthusiastic about this:

"We must entertain our foreign... no, guests well." He waved his cigar wildly. "Let them fully experience the Committee's hospitality and deep friendship toward the Dutch people."

At dusk, Zhong Lishi and several chefs were in the Customs House kitchen preparing dishes for the reception.

Besides being learned, Dr. Zhong was a bona fide "foodie." He not only loved to eat but loved figuring out how to cook. In Lingao, he had started cooking for himself very early on. After Taibai Observatory was completed, Science Department colleagues would gather at the observatory for Dr. Zhong to cook a meal whenever they got good ingredients or found a suitable excuse. Some joked that Taibai Observatory had as much kitchenware as instruments.

For this business trip to Taiwan, he had also made ample preparations for his palate. Various kitchen utensils and condiments filled a whole crate. The kitchen in the Customs House, which had been empty, was now his to use.

---

The kitchen was buzzing with activity. Zhong Lishi instructed Zhong Xiaoying to watch the pot of simmering tomato bisque while he took a mallet to pound meat paste for *yanpi* [dumpling wrappers made of meat and starch]. After preparing the *yanpi*, he turned to tell Xiaoying to bring the seasoned meat filling, only to find the person helping behind him was Huygens.

Zhong Lishi was startled. "Mr. Huygens? How did you..."

Huygens smiled slightly and said to Zhong Lishi, "I'm also very interested in cooking. I heard your daughter say you excel at cooking, especially that your roast duck is delicious. I wanted to see how your roast duck differs from our roast goose..."

"Welcome! Welcome! Just don't mind the messy kitchen..." Zhong Lishi greeted Huygens while secretly wondering: When did Zhong Xiaoying learn German? As for these Dutchmen, sticking together a few out-of-tune Cantonese phrases would be rare enough.

Zhong Lishi looked back and saw Zhong Xiaoying deftly pumping air into a duck while laughing and talking with the blonde girl. Though he couldn't hear what they were saying, it was clear they were communicating.

"Xiaoying!?" Zhong Lishi was greatly surprised.

Huygens probably noticed his surprise and couldn't help smiling slightly. "You needn't be surprised. Your daughter doesn't speak German, but Cleadia learned quite a bit of Chinese from Chinese sailors and merchants on the ship and in Batavia..."

"It's Cantonese, right?" Zhong Lishi said.

Huygens was puzzled. "Isn't that Chinese?"

Zhong Lishi didn't know whether to laugh or cry. This traditional misunderstanding, where even in 20th-century Hollywood movies every Chinese spoke Cantonese, indeed had a long history. He could only say, "You see, you speak Low German, while Mr. Bontekoe and I speak High German... You can't say they are the same thing."

"Oh, I understand your meaning." Huygens looked thoughtful. "But the German you speak is very strange..."

Dr. Zhong was about to explain further when he suddenly heard laughter from the two girls beside him. Seeing Zhong Lishi notice her, Zhong Xiaoying smiled mischievously at him. She spoke loudly to him in Mandarin: "Honorable Father, I don't understand her Cantonese very well either..."

Dr. Zhong admonished, "Be careful with your work, watch out for burns!"

Zhong Xiaoying said to Zhong Lishi, "Cleadia says she wants to teach me how to cook fish the Dutch way..."

"Really? That's excellent." Zhong Lishi thought this was a good way to promote friendship. Of course, what specific use this friendship had was hard to say...

Suddenly he realized his thinking had become too "Committee-ized." Everything had to have meaning and utility.

Zhong Lishi hung the air-pumped ducks in the oven—he roasted six in total. Not to mention the Committee members, the Dutchmen were probably big eaters too; six ducks were the minimum. He checked the fire, poked it with an iron hook, and closed the door only when the heat was right, then went to observe Cleadia's Dutch-style roast fish.

"Remove bones, tail, head, leaving only meat... then add olive oil, bay leaves, onions, milk..."

It was evident Cleadia had good skills; her movements were deft. Dr. Zhong couldn't help praising her a few times. He felt this girl should be a lady of good family, yet surprisingly she could work in the kitchen.

"I used to help Mama cook," Cleadia said. "Later God took Mama away, so only I cooked..."

Dr. Zhong knew average life expectancy was short in this era, but from her words, he could tell the Bontekoe family hadn't been wealthy in earlier years; otherwise, in this era of cheap labor, wife and daughter wouldn't need to cook. No wonder she and Zhong Xiaoying found common language—both came from working backgrounds.

"Miss Bontekoe is a very capable young lady. She took care of our daily lives all along the journey," Huygens said with a smile. He was a Dutch noble and diplomat, but Dutch social atmosphere differed from general European countries; aristocrats and the wealthy lived simply and valued labor. So their attitude toward labor was relatively positive.

Dr. Zhong took the opportunity to ask, "Mr. Huygens, is your young son Christiaan well?"
