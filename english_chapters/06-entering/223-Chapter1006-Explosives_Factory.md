# Chapter 1006 Explosives Factory

The Dutch East India Company trading post's wiretapping records were top-priority materials; translated and transcribed the next morning, they would be delivered to Zhao Manxiong's desk. According to agreements reached at the weekly security joint conference, this material was also copied to the Police Headquarters and Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

Every day upon entering his office, Zhao Manxiong would personally study these highest-level materials—the Executive Committee didn't want Operation Engine to be disturbed by any external forces.

Among external forces, the Portuguese and English were weak, the Spanish were distant and inert. Only the Dutch had a certain strength and were directly connected to their vital interests.

Tayouan was very important to the East India Company. It was hard to say what reaction the Senate's development of Kaohsiung would provoke from them.

"We must make the Dutch fully realize the terror of opposing us." At the planning meeting before Operation Engine began, the countermeasure adopted against possible Dutch reactions was using intimidation to force them not to act rashly.

From the wiretapping report, the work on Trini had obviously achieved good results—whether intentionally or not, this Italian was desperately boasting about the Senate's military power. Zhao Manxiong was well aware that a person in a comfortable, pleasant environment would have little interest in launching a war.

Living comfortably, doing beloved work, receiving generous compensation, with lolis and shotas for company—unless mentally unstable, Trini wouldn't hope for a war to end his current situation.

The conversation between the two hadn't exceeded most of his projections: including the East India Company's thinking and attitude. Sending a large ship to Lingao during non-trading season, the purpose obviously wasn't just to make money. The *Magdeburg*'s mission was clearly to gather intelligence.

Then he read the surveillance report on the East India Company trading post, especially the report on the activities of servants within the trading post. Wufo believed at least one servant was undertaking some secret work.

From the report, this servant was quite active, frequently operating in Lingao, with footprints covering everywhere foreigners were allowed. He went to Bopu Harbor almost once daily—the public excuse being purchasing fish catch.

Finally was the report from the mail inspector stationed by the Political Security Bureau at the Postal Administration. The Postal Administration had taken over the Ming government's relay station system, opening postal routes from Lingao to each county in Hainan, with postal sub-offices established in every county. However, these sub-offices currently only handled transmission of official documents and correspondence for departments, enterprises, and military units under the Senate; private letters were limited to naturalized citizens and a few natives who had dealings with the transmigrator group.

The postal inspection method opened and inspected all letters for some individuals and departments; others were spot-checked. Zhao Manxiong skipped past other sections, directly finding the postal inspection report on the East India trading post.

Dutch trading post letters were routinely sent by trading post servants to Bopu, delivered to East India Company merchant ships returning to Batavia or heading to Tayouan. When there were no East India Company ships, they were given to Chinese merchant ships heading to those two places. Regardless of which delivery method was used, the Political Security Bureau could always obtain a copy before departing the port.

Letters were encrypted, but for the Political Security Bureau, any 17th-century encryption was child's play. Each letter was decrypted, translated, then transcribed into several copies for "relevant departments"—because the Dutch were a focus of attention, postal inspection reports concerning them all came with original letter manuscripts attached.

Zhao Manxiong carefully read the reports and recent letters. Overall he was satisfied: completely matching the effects their "demonstrating power" activities were supposed to achieve.

However, this was only regarding current trading post personnel. Whether it would have the same effect on the newly arrived Van de Lantron was hard to say. Whether there was need to launch new "military demonstrations" targeting Van de Lantron was something Zhao Manxiong needed to consider.

To "demonstrate military power," there was plenty of ready material: whether the Project 901 in the harbor or the new artillery the army was recently testing, or even the not-so-new typewriter—all were enough to give this Dutchman sufficient shock.

The problem was that excessive flaunting of military power sometimes would instead be interpreted as "covering up weaknesses." Zhao Manxiong was worried there might be some clever people in Batavia who would judge it so.

"Just need to make this cheese-eater understand clearly." he said, thinking of the Project 2300 currently being intensively developed—if successfully completed, it would be a very astonishing military advancement. Unfortunately, Van de Lantron might not accurately comprehend its power.

Better to let Van de Lantron see the Senate's steam fleet—as a seafaring people, Van de Lantron wouldn't fail to understand the tremendous power of steam warships.

Project 2300's location was the Lingao Special Chemicals Complex. Although this complex belonged to the Chemical Department, it was far away from the Chemical Department's subsidiary chemical enterprises. Many workers in other chemical plants had never even heard of this enterprise.

Lingao's Special Chemicals Complex was designed after a certain explosives factory from the 156 Projects of old. Its main task was producing gunpowder and explosives.

Explosives were key projects for the transmigrators to maintain their advantage. With continuous expansion of military scale and demands for civilian projects, early workshop-style production scales and laboratory-style production processes had become far from meeting needs.

Especially the lack of sufficient quantities of relatively safe high explosives greatly limited both military and civilian applications. So much that military stockpiled explosives could only be kept at relatively low reserve levels. The army's ammunition reserves, besides ensuring routine training, had only one campaign's worth. Naval ammunition reserves on various ships also generally fell short of basic allotments.

The Planning Bureau was well aware of the current predicament, so from over a year ago had formally begun planning construction of the explosives enterprise—the Lingao Special Chemicals Complex.

The Lingao Special Chemicals Complex occupied vast land—displaying an Old Russian vast territory aesthetic. The factory zone occupied several thousand *mu*. Even so, it was only scaled down over a dozen times from the old dimension. The factory site was selected at the edge of the Gaoshan Ridge hilly area—a sloped area where bedrock began emerging. The soil layer was very thin, with rocks and gullies everywhere, making construction very difficult. The advantage was it was remote and desolate, with almost no households or farmland nearby. Elevated terrain meant it wouldn't flood from typhoon strikes.

Because in an explosives factory, various explosives and precursors were concentrated together. Once a chain reaction occurred, half of Lingao's existing industrial zone might be written off. Continuing to stay in the industrial zone was already very unsafe.

Regarding explosives, finished products were actually quite safe. What was unsafe were intermediate precursors—many in unstable states, only temporarily stable through strict process specifications. However, workers in this dimension had almost no concept of process discipline. Even in the previous explosives factory under strict military management, with extremely severe punishments including death penalty and collective punishment, various small accidents hadn't been completely eliminated.

The explosives factory's casualty accident rate was classified, never reported in internal bulletins. Naturalized citizens, unless working there, simply didn't know such a place existed. Selected workers were preferably single men.

Even through various means reducing accident impacts to minimum levels, small accidents that couldn't be promptly handled would become major accidents. Moving to this desolate area would at least minimize losses when accidents occurred—even for primarily produced black powder, an explosion of sufficient quantity would produce very powerful effects. The great Wanggongchang explosion back then was terrifying enough.

The Special Chemicals Complex's planning still seriously violated old dimension safety standards. Because this factory not only produced pyrotechnics but also manufactured various finished ammunition and undertook research tasks.

"At least our production conditions are much better than Huangyadong..." Xu Yingjie said with a forced smile after seeing the planning diagram. His exposed arm already had another scar—left by glass shards when manufacturing mercury fulminate half a year ago.

"Also safer than current conditions. Otherwise, we few brothers in the Chemical Department will sooner or later become one-eyed or one-legged. Arriving at Cuigang early is inevitable." said Ji Tuisi, head of the Chemical Department. Never mind explosives—even production in chemical plants often made his heart pound with fear.

The Chemical Department did have a few fearless explosives enthusiasts, but courage couldn't bring safety—everyone still wanted to see the day of revolutionary victory—and of course, in one piece.

"Regarding safety requirements, everyone try to propose as much as possible. Don't fear trouble or resource consumption. Whatever can be satisfied, the Planning Bureau will definitely fully satisfy." Wu De said at the meeting. "Safety first."

After over a year of major construction, the factory zone still wasn't completed—or rather, no one knew when it would be completed. According to planning: large quantities of artificial barriers to block shock waves had to be built between various facilities, usually 20-30 meter high earth embankments to direct shock waves and burning materials skyward—to avoid flying rocks during explosions, stone couldn't be used.

After basic civil construction was completed, embankment work was only less than 10% done. Many embankments had to make do with stones inside and thick earth layers patted on outside. The factory went into production anyway. Traditional safety ditch methods continued in use. Embankments still had to continue construction. For safety reasons, smoke-spewing steam-powered construction equipment couldn't be used anymore—only manpower: the Fubo Army and labor reform teams, with modern machinery used when necessary.
