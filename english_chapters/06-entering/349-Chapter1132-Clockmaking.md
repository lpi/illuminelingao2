# Chapter 1132 - Clockmaking

This simple wooden prototype marked the beginning of Lingao's clockmaking industry. It employed a pendulum regulator invented in 1656 and a free escapement mechanism invented in 1765. Gazing at the successfully operating Number 3 test mechanism, Zhong Lishi thought of Galileo, who had discovered the laws of pendulum motion, and tears flowed unbidden. At this very moment, the venerable Galileo must be suffering persecution from the Roman Curia, in dire straits. When Zhong Lishi emerged from the sweltering test tower, so drenched it was as if he'd just come out of water, no one noticed he'd been crying. Only Zhong Xiaoying, when bringing her Honorable Father his dinner, noticed his low spirits and melancholy.

"Honorable Father..." Zhong Xiaoying placed her hand on Dr. Zhong's shoulder. "You seem unhappy..."

"Mm... I was thinking of a person..."

"A venerable predecessor... a master..." Dr. Zhong said, unconsciously grasping his adopted daughter's hand—soft and warm. It soothed his mood.

Building on the Number 3 test device, Zhong Lishi added a gear train to establish the minute and hour hand relationship, redesigned the pendulum length, and calibrated its period. He also added more sandbags and a weight-winding mechanism with a ratchet. Thus, a usable Number 4 test device was born.

Based on the Number 4 test device, Zhong Lishi designed and prototyped a complete clock tower mechanism. The mechanism used bronze materials to ensure performance. Some elastic components were made of phosphor bronze. Since this was a prototype, all parts were individually machined by Science Department Committee members, with some taken to the Mechanical Processing Factory for professional Committee members to make. Of course, there was no concept of tolerance control—for a considerable period, each clock tower mechanism was unique, and each had its own slight improvements.

While manufacturing the clock mechanism, the Lingao Construction Company built an experimental clock tower with excellent shelter and ventilation using a brick-arch structure. The tower was located west of Taibai Observatory, which later became the clock workshop location.

Zhong Lishi personally supervised the installation. This mechanism was designated the YZB-1 clock mechanism, also called "Weight-Pendulum Type 1." The Weight-Pendulum Type 1 had only timekeeping function, with only minute and hour hands. To improve operational stability, both hands had counterweights at their tails to ensure the rotation axis was at the center of gravity. This way, when the hands rotated on the clock tower's side face, the mechanism wouldn't be affected by eccentricity.

Three Weight-Pendulum Type 1 mechanisms were built in succession, each with some modifications. Large clock mechanisms differed from watch conditions, so Zhong Lishi made some attempts different from watch design. For the power section, he installed the driving wheel at different positions in the gear train, comparing the advantages and disadvantages of these arrangements. For the pallet fork, the jewels and escapement wheel experienced the most frequent friction. In watches, pallet jewels were made of ruby, more wear-resistant than the wheel, because replacing the wheel was more convenient than replacing the jewels. But for large mechanisms, the jewels were large and easy to replace, while large escapement wheels were expensive to manufacture. Therefore, Zhong Lishi experimented on the clock tower mechanism with replaceable jewels made of slightly softer material than the bronze wheel to protect the more expensive wheel.

The Weight-Pendulum Type 1 was powered by four sets of weights, each wound through four chain-driven winding wheels. Multiple weights were used to alleviate changes in mechanism torque during winding, reducing the impact on timekeeping accuracy. The winding wheels had twice the diameter of the weight drive wheels—designed to reduce effort when winding. The drive wheels had ratchets similar to bicycle rear wheels, allowing only counterclockwise single-direction winding (the weight wheels' working rotation direction was clockwise). Large clock mechanisms had considerable power. When servicing the mechanism, all weights had to be released to ensure maintenance personnel safety. To prevent weights from accidentally falling, no one could stand beneath them—the same principle as "no standing under crane arms."

After a month of testing, the three Weight-Pendulum Type 1 mechanisms were officially put into use. Originally, Dr. Zhong hadn't intended for these prototypes to enter practical service—he'd only planned to keep the one installed in the experimental clock tower for teaching demonstrations. But the Planning Committee felt that since they'd already been built, discarding them was too wasteful: producing these three mechanisms alone had consumed enormous amounts of skilled Committee technicians' work time. So two were officially installed in vacant clock towers. The Weight-Pendulum Type 1 had only one clock face and no lighting. Later, after modification, a nighttime illumination system was added.

Experience proved the bronze mechanisms had long lifespans. Though they had minor issues, they operated normally under proper maintenance. After thirty consecutive years of operation, these three Weight-Pendulum Type 1 mechanisms were finally replaced. As the ancestors of Aussong clockmaking, they became the crowning treasures of museums.

On the fourth mechanism, Zhong Lishi made major modifications: he designed two synchronized clock faces and created a simple hourly striking mechanism to ring a bronze bell on the hour. This simple timekeeping device could only produce a single chime. This barely-adequate timekeeping mechanism was called "Weight-Pendulum Type 2."

The Weight-Pendulum Type 2 had just been installed on the experimental clock tower and was being tested. However, Dr. Zhong wasn't satisfied with this model—it was merely to verify whether his approach was feasible.

"Does the bell ring every hour?" Zhong Lishi glanced at a clock in the workshop. This clock had a very contemporary style for this timeline: a porcelain-fired clock face, wooden case, brass hands. It had indeed been assembled by the Science Department's clock workshop. But inside was a quartz movement from another timeline.

Behind the clock, wires protruded conspicuously, connected to a wooden box. Inside the box was the "Zhong Number 1" battery invented by Dr. Zhong. Lingao had no dry batteries; the only option was to use external batteries to power quartz clocks.

Quartz clocks in the old timeline were synonymous with cheap goods—ordinary finished clocks retailed for only a few dozen yuan. But in timekeeping accuracy, they completely outperformed all mechanical watches. Before D-Day, the Committee had purchased large quantities of timing equipment. Besides finished clocks and watches, there were many loose components. A large portion of these were quartz movements and quartz oscillators. The cases were manufactured in this timeline to fully economize ship space.

These locally-assembled quartz clocks were distributed to important workshops requiring precise timekeeping. As controlled materials, each quartz clock was numbered. Apart from Committee members and authorized Science Department staff, no one else was permitted to touch them.

The reason Zhong Lishi valued quartz clocks so highly was that they were the most accurate timekeeping devices they possessed. A timekeeping system needed precise reference calibrators as standards. When he'd originally suggested purchasing large quantities of quartz oscillators, he'd intended to use them to manufacture standard calibrators for this timeline, using the semiconductor components they'd brought as amplifiers until the electronic components failed.

Dr. Zhong's plan was to use the quartz calibrator as the master standard, then manufacture a batch of high-precision mechanical calibrators. Locally-made timepieces would be calibrated using these mechanical calibrators. This tiered calibration system was crucial for maintaining timekeeping accuracy. In the old timeline, radio time signals broadcast by radio stations were the main calibration method. Lingao couldn't yet popularize this system; they had to use calibrators.

"Yes, your daughter listened every hour, and it chimed every time." Zhong Xiaoying spoke respectfully, presenting a clipboard with records of the precise time of each chime.

Zhong Lishi looked at it. Each chime lagged slightly behind the quartz clock's displayed time—some even by one or two seconds. This wasn't just a matter of sound wave velocity. He'd tested after installing the mechanism, and the timekeeping error wasn't this large. Obviously, the striking mechanical transmission still had issues.

"The transmission still has problems," Dr. Zhong murmured, setting down the clipboard. He looked at the rain outside—it showed no sign of lessening. It seemed inspecting the mechanism would have to wait until tomorrow.

He wrote on his notepad: "Install a covered corridor between the workshop and experimental clock tower."

It was now eleven o'clock. Zhong Lishi planned to calibrate the time at Taibai Observatory at midnight. There was still some time. Looking at the pile of parts and drawings on his desk, Dr. Zhong decided to continue prototyping the mechanical calibrator.
