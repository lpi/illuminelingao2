# Chapter 1085 - Mao Chenglu

After adopting this method, the channel leading to the Qimu Island trestle bridge could barely be maintained for use. The icebreaker breaking ice once every day and night basically kept the route unimpeded, ensuring the continuous transport of refugees.

But such a practice could only guarantee the smooth flow of the trestle bridge channel. It was of little help to a more serious problem: the safety of the island.

After Longkou Bay froze, Qimu Island was no longer connected to the mainland only by a sandbar; instead, it became part of the coast of Longkou Bay. Under the snow cover, it was almost impossible to see that this was an island.

Small islands near the shore of Bohai Bay, once frozen in winter, became flat land with no danger to defend. Similar lessons were countless in the Liaodong wars of the late Ming. Because the Later Jin army had no navy, they often utilized the large-area freezing of the Bohai Sea to dispatch troops to attack islands garrisoned by Ming troops, often achieving complete victory.

 The Dongjiang army had suffered this loss often enough. Now that they were the attackers, they would definitely make full use of this advantage.

Although the freezing thickness of Longkou Bay was not great, and there were certain gaps between sea ice, there was no difficulty for people and horses to walk on it. This caused Qimu Island, which originally relied on special service boats to ensure maritime safety on three sides facing water, to have great worries.

"Under freezing conditions, our ships lose mobility." Lu Yang, who hurried from the *Daishuang* after hearing the alarm, said, "Warships in the channel can only serve as fixed batteries..."

"The power of your five ships firing together is enough." Zhu Mingxia said, "The disadvantage is the lack of mobility. Only fire support can be carried out within the channel, and the accuracy is a bit worse."

Since the surroundings of the island were covered by ice, the enemy might not necessarily choose the sandbar as the only attack route. They were very likely to detour from the ice surface to launch an attack on Qimu Island.

In this way, all facilities on Qimu Island might face direct enemy attacks.

"I'm not too worried about the enemy breaking in. Our biggest weakness is the refugee camp—its defense is the weakest, and now nearly ten thousand people are backlogged inside. Once fighting starts, it will be very difficult to handle if the refugee camp explodes into chaos." Lu Wenyuan frowned.

The refugee camp also had walls, towers, and artillery, but too many refugees were backlogged inside. Once encountering a fierce siege, it was difficult to make their "emotions stable." Moreover, the refugee camp's own fortification was the weakest. Many places were just earthen embankments plus wooden fences. Instead of defensive measures against the outside, they were more for imprisonment and control.

Several people's gaze projected onto Zhu Mingxia together. As the chief officer of the Northbound Detachment, defensive operations were naturally his responsibility.

Zhu Mingxia said: "It doesn't matter. The enemy may not be able to land on the island under our firepower. Even if they can land, we can defeat them before they launch a siege battle."

He paused and said: "Not to mention we have quite a few pots and pans on the island. It would be troublesome if they really rushed onto the island and broke some."

Zhu Mingxia believed that his side's troop strength was quite sufficient, and there was enough firepower, so there was no need to stay trapped in defensive works. His plan was for village braves and a small number of troops to stick to various fortresses. He would lead four infantry companies to deploy mobile defense on the island in formation. Coordinating with the artillery on the fortresses and warships, they would intercept whichever side the enemy attacked from, directly driving them off the island.

"The enemy coming from the ice surface is bound to move slowly. We will constantly bombard their marching columns with cannons. I'm afraid they won't be able to hold on before waiting to get to the island edge." Zhu Mingxia said, "Don't worry, the enemy will undoubtedly be defeated. It's just that capturing more prisoners is a bit hard..."

"If we capture more prisoners, my place will become a hell on earth..." Lu Wenyuan shook his head repeatedly, "Just drive them away."

Chen Sigen said: "Capturing prisoners or not doesn't matter much. The key is to hurt the rebels; otherwise, they won't know what's good for them."

Immediately, they divided the labor. Lu Wenyuan sat in the Qimu Island stockade to presume over the overall work. Chen Sigen was responsible for guarding the Willow Palisade. Zhu Mingxia led three companies to conduct mobile defense. Lu Yang returned to the fleet.

The Northbound Detachment and the Peace Preservation Corps of the Shandong Advance Column all slept with their clothes on, weapons never leaving their hands. Double sentries were added to all guard posts. Zhu Mingxia pulled out all the cannons on the island and installed them in gun positions—in the past, to prevent "shocking the public," some artillery pieces only had positions set up without cannons installed.

Immediately, he instructed various kitchens to cook, boil water in large quantities, and make dry pancakes—the battle might last for a day. relying solely on dry rations wouldn't work. Moreover, once the enemy landed, it would be inconvenient to cook and boil water in various camps, so reserves had to be made in advance.

Zhu Mingxia instructed Lu Yang to dismantle several more typewriters from the warships to strengthen the Willow Palisade. He also installed several naval short cannons from inventory on the bastion of the Willow Palisade.

"Is my bastion armed too excessively?" Chen Sigen couldn't help raising an objection, "Now the roads to land on the island extend in all directions. The enemy doesn't have to attack from the Willow Palisade..."

"Your Willow Palisade will definitely have the greatest pressure." Zhu Mingxia said to Chen Sigen, "The sandbar is the most convenient channel into the island, and the road condition is also the best. The enemy will definitely drive a large number of refugees to directly impact the Willow Palisade through the sandbar. At that time, I'm just afraid you will get soft-hearted from killing people..."

Chen Sigen expressed doubt: "You are so sure?"

"Of course I'm sure. Let's make an assumption first. If you were a rebel general, how would you plan to attack Qimu Island?"

"Since I have numerical superiority, of course, I would attack from multiple routes, forcing the defenders to divide forces."

"Correct. After the sea freezes, breach points can be chosen very conveniently. Detouring from the sea ice to our weak flank is the best method. But marching on a detour on sea ice is not an easy thing. If most of my subordinates are refugees coerced to come, driving them to do such complex tactical actions cannot be done." Zhu Mingxia pointed to the sand table, "If I were Mao Chenglu, I would drive a large number of refugees to impact the Willow Palisade directly from the front, attracting our attention and firepower. Then choose elite troops to attack by detouring on foot from the sea surface."

Chen Sigen nodded: "But isn't strengthening the Willow Palisade like this engaging exactly with their wishes?"

"If I were an army of the same level as them, Mao Chenglu's plan would threaten us greatly." Zhu Mingxia said, "But our army has a generation gap with them—the Dongjiang Army was not the opponent of Tartars in Liaodong, and they are even less the opponent of the Fubo Army on Qimu Island. Instead, the Willow Palisade has to withstand the tidal wave attack of thousands of refugees. Preparing more firearms to disperse the cannon fodder as soon as possible is also good to kill fewer people."

"I understand—"

"There is one thing I have to remind you," Zhu Mingxia said, "Intelligence indicates that the rebels coerced a large number of able-bodied men. There are also many common folks from Huang County—they will very likely adopt the tactic of driving common folks as vanguard cannon fodder to fill trenches and consume ammunition to attack the Willow Palisade. You have to be steady at that time..."

Chen Sigen's face turned a bit pale. He clenched his fist: "I know what you mean. You rest assured."

Zhu Mingxia arranged the defense, then nonstop instructed personnel of the Engineer Training Unit to take the Peace Preservation Corps to the shore of Qimu Island to bury simple versions of directional mines, add barbed wire, and bury landmines beside all fortresses.

He ordered double ammunition issued to the four infantry companies executing mobile defense, including bullets and grenades.

After arranging everything properly, Zhu Mingxia sent out all the Special Reconnaissance Team and scout cavalry in hand to grasp Mao Chenglu's movements at all times.

Mao Chenglu's army didn't set off from Huang County until the twenty-first day of the first month of the fifth year of Chongzhen, a *Renshen* year. The whole army was nearly ten thousand people—more than half of whom were coerced Huang County common folks. Some were issued weapons; many were driven to fight without even a wooden stick.

The road was snowy and difficult to travel. Although the rebels obtained a large number of livestock like cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules due to looting, the march speed was not fast as the main army carried six heavy cannons and many firearms of different sizes. They didn't arrive in the Longkou Bay area until that night.

Mao Chenglu didn't even know where "Manor Lord Lu's" stockade was at first, only knowing it was roughly in the Longkou Bay area. On the way, he sent several waves of night scouts (*Ye Bu Shou*) before finding out clearly that the manor was on Qimu Island.

Along the way, they caught some common folks again and roughly knew that there was a stockade on Qimu Island. A stockade wall was erected on the sandbar, with village braves inspecting entry and exit, guarding very strictly.

Mao Chenglu had been to this place, Qimu Island, and knew the approximate terrain. After camping ten *li* outside Qimu Island that night, he immediately sent several waves of night scouts to probing the surrounding reality—especially the ice condition of Longkou Bay.

That night, the Special Reconnaissance Team and the night scouts had continuous night battles around Qimu Island. Gunshots and screams sounded from time to time in the thick black night. The night scouts were almost completely wiped out. Of the dozens sent out, only less than seven or eight returned to the main camp.

Early the next morning, surrounded by subordinate minor generals, Mao Chenglu climbed up the Longkou Beacon Mound on one side of Longkou Bay—from here, he could clearly overlook Qimu Island.

Mao Chenglu took out a telescope—this was specially bought from Europe by Sun Yuanhua entrusted to missionaries back then—observing the terrain around Qimu Island.

It could be seen that the only channel entering the island, the sandbar, was defended very strictly. Besides this, there were three isolated stockades on the island. All had stockade walls and towers.

Looking at this appearance, Qimu Island was not a fruit easy to nibble. Mao Chenglu sucked in a breath of cold air: He discovered that these stockades were all "Western-style Beacon Towers," which were the Red Barbarian cities that Governor Sun had always advocated constructing in the past. As a general, he had also communicated with the Western Labor (*Xi Lao*) of the Franks (*Portuguese*) in Dengzhou and roughly knew the tactics and methods of the Franks.

"My goodness (*Guai Guai*), this stockade is not easy to handle." He muttered, handing the telescope to Commander Chen Guangfu beside him—he was ordered to lead three thousand men to reinforce Mao Chenglu and was now a "Regional Assistant Commander."
