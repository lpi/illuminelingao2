# Chapter 1084 - Alarm

The stockade crowded with refugees was like a hell on earth. In the turmoil of war, no one was in the mood to listen to songs; even selling their bodies had no patrons. A group of people barely lived a life of sleeping in the wind and dew, enduring hunger and starvation, relying on a little savings. They hoped the military chaos would end soon so they could go on the road back to Nanjing. Unexpectedly, the stockade was not safe either—not long after the news of the fall of Dengzhou came, they heard that the rebels had conquered Huang County and broken stockades everywhere. The various stockades were in chaos, cleaning out outsiders without guarantors one after another. A wandering music troupe like theirs naturally had no one willing to guarantee for them, so they were driven out into the ice and snow.

Fortunately, the stockade was not far from Baimatang. Their small troupe was taken in not long after fleeing. Otherwise, they probably wouldn't have been able to walk for a day or two before dying of exhaustion and starvation on the road.

"Does the General want Ruhua (*Flowery*) to serve?" Liu, who had cultivated the ability to observe expressions and colors for half her life, said softly to Zhu Mingxia.

"Ruhua?" This name shocked Zhu Mingxia half to death. He instantly remembered that awesome person picking her nose with heavy makeup. His face didn't change much, but his stomach rolled fiercely a few times.

"It's the woman who guided the General just now."

"Oh."

"How can that kind of clumsy woman with big hands and feet serve the General? She is old too, and has a Broom Star fate (*bad luck*). My daughter Siyu (*Jade-like*) was trained by me since childhood. She plays a good Pipa. She is only 13 this year, a virgin. If the General doesn't despise..." Liu felt that Zhu Mingxia was not interested in Ruhua and immediately changed her tune to promote another one. Of course, this couldn't be her biological daughter. In order to cling to the big tree of the Australians, for survival, it was necessary to put gold on her face.

Zhu Mingxia interrupted her promotion and asked her to bring Ruhua. As an atheist, he really wanted to know why Ruhua was called a Broom Star, so he wanted to ask personally.

He was pondering whether to purify Ruhua first and change her name to something that wouldn't cause associations before having a heart-to-heart talk when suddenly a naturalized cadre hurriedly walked to his side and whispered to him:

"Chief, Chief Lu asks you to go over quickly—it's extremely urgent."

"Hmm! Oh?" Although Zhu Mingxia had shown early symptoms of sperm getting to his brain, he could still hold it together for the time being. Hearing there was an "extremely urgent" matter, he dared not neglect and immediately ordered:

"Separate the people of this troupe and detain them separately."

"Yes!"

Liu, a woman of the wind and dust for many years, had analyzed men's behavior and speech extremely thoroughly. Knowing that Zhu Mingxia already had a strong interest in Ruhua, and hearing that the troupe was separated, she knew she had climbed a high branch. At least for the recent few months, food, drink, and shelter were not worries. Her little life could probably be saved too—if lucky, maybe she could get a few taels of silver. She immediately bowed (*Wanfu*) joyfully: "Many thanks for Master's grace!"

When Zhu Mingxia returned to the stockade, Chen Sigen and Lu Wenyuan were already standing in front of the sand table in the war room with serious faces.

"What is it?" Zhu Mingxia had roughly guessed a few points. Could it be that the rebels were coming towards Qimu Island?

"Wang Qisuo just came back." Chen Sigen said.

Wang Qisuo performed excellently in the Battle of Baimatang. Although the overall battle appeared one-sided under the firepower advantage of the Minié rifles and typewriters of the two infantry companies, and the fighting was not intense, he performed very bravely. He not only actively undertook field reconnaissance outside Baimatang but also killed and captured several rebels in the pursuit battle.

Chen Sigen was very satisfied with his combat performance, believing that this person's comprehensive quality could be selected into the Special Reconnaissance Team. However, he had not yet undergone the appraisal and specialized political training of the General Bureau of Political Security, so for the time being, he only conducted some reconnaissance business training for him and let him serve as a scout in the Advance Column.

A few days ago, he dispatched Wang Qisuo and some other scouts of the Advance Column born locally to operate near Huang County, cooperating with the Special Reconnaissance Team to grasp the movements of the Huang County rebels.

The sentry brought Wang Qisuo in. He was wearing a tattered cotton padded jacket, draped with a white snow camouflage cloak, his face and hands filthy.

"Say what you saw again." Chen Sigen ordered.

"Report to Chief, a large group of enemy troops came from Dengzhou at noon today," Wang Qisuo said. "There are fully two or three thousand people, all combat soldiers!"

An army of tens of thousands coming was not fearful—Huang County was now gathering "more than ten thousand" troops, but most of them were commoners coerced recently—the number of fully equipped combat soldiers was the key.

He reported that the troops coming all wore cotton armor and were fully equipped. They also brought many firearms. Particularly important was that the rebels used oxen to tow six "giant cannons" to Huang County.

According to historical materials, the rebels historically brought artillery to participate in battles against government troops many times, including the siege of Laizhou and several field battles with government troops. The rebels basically carried culverins (*Banshe Chong*). The barrel weight alone was two or three thousand *jin*. Added with the heavy gun carriage, it was very difficult to maneuver under primitive road conditions.

The fact that the opponent actually brought heavy firearms to attack showed that the Battle of Baimatang had left a deep impression regarding their firearms on them.

"The main general in Huang County, Mao Chenglu, is burying pots to make food (*preparing meals*), preparing to attack Qimu Island tomorrow." Then he told some fragmented news.

"Good, you go down." Zhu Mingxia nodded. This matter was not too out of his expectations. Although the location of Qimu Island was remote by the seaside, it was after all within the territory of Huang County, and Huang County was the passage for rebels to go to Laizhou.

If the "village braves" on Qimu Island didn't operate, then the rebels would indeed be unlikely to come specifically to deal with this seaside stockade. But right now they were gathering refugees on a large scale within Huang County, appearing to have become a big force within Huang County.

If Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde wanted to ensure the safety of the road to Laizhou, they would not tolerate such a force existing on their flank—not to mention that they had just beaten the rebels soundly a few days ago, letting them see their combat effectiveness.

Chen Sigen said: "I have withdrawn all the spies of the Advance Column—they lack professional skills, and continuing to stay outside is just dying in vain. Temporarily only let cavalry be responsible for reconnaissance on the periphery."

He pointed at the sand table: "If Mao Chenglu's troops set off today, they will arrive at Qimu Island tomorrow noon at the earliest."

Huang County originally had about two thousand rebels. Now adding three thousand people. It was unlikely they would turn out in full strength—after all, someone had to stay behind to guard the county seat. So at most four thousand would come. Of course, the rebels would definitely coerce a large number of able-bodied men to follow the army to act as porters and cannon fodder. It was possible for the total number to exceed ten thousand.

This ten thousand people, plus artillery and ammunition, saying arriving tomorrow noon was the fastest speed. After arriving, they had to set up camp and arrange gun positions. If they could launch an attack, it would be the morning of the day after tomorrow at least—Chen Sigen didn't think the rebels had the ability to launch a night attack.

The three people gazed at the defense system of Qimu Island. Qimu Island's defense was very solid. On the long causeway leading to the mainland, there was a painstakingly constructed Willow Palisade: not only were trenches added, dense abatis added, but coils of barbed wire and a large number of standard bamboo spikes shipped from Lingao were also laid. The simple stockade gate on the long causeway was also rebuilt into a bastion of earth and wood structure, equipped with artillery of different calibers—rebels wanting to pig-rush into the island from the causeway would pay extremely heavy casualties.

In addition to the frontal Willow Palisade defense line, the refugee camp, the pier, and the mountain stockade on the island also formed a defense system that was self-contained yet echoed each other. Crossfire could be carried out with artillery and rifles between the three.

"The main defense problem we face is the freezing of Longkou Bay." Zhu Mingxia said, "This greatly increases the difficulty of our defense."

 regarding the ice condition of Longkou Bay, they only had hydrological data from the 20th century. January to February every year was the peak ice period of Longkou Bay, lasting about 20-40 days. The average ice volume was level 2.2, density level 5-7, having no impact on ship navigation. When the ice condition was maximum perennially, the floating ice in Longkou Port was 10-15 cm thick at most. When ships berthed on the south side, high-horsepower tugboats were used to break ice; berthing on the north side was basically unaffected. There was crushed ice in the channel, and ship navigation was basically unaffected.

According to 20th-century hydrological data, being ice-free and silt-free all year round was the biggest characteristic of Longkou Port. Choosing Qimu Island as a transfer base initially also had this consideration.

Of course, this place was not completely ice-free. Serious freezing would occur in some years. Even using icebreakers, the port could not be used.

But now it was the Little Ice Age. The freezing situation appearing in Longkou Bay might be much more serious than the situation they grasped of the 20th and 21st centuries. Therefore, Thorpe strongly advocated equipping the Northbound Detachment with an icebreaker at the logistics meeting—after all, Lingao in this spacetime still snowed in winter. Therefore, a Type 621 tugboat was urgently modified as an icebreaking tugboat at the Bopu Shipyard.

Because the Type 621 was a tugboat, its overall structure was solid and the hull was strong, suitable for icebreaking modification. The modification project reinforced the outside of the bow with steel plates, then used steel beams to support the inside of the bow, and then used steel beams to significantly reinforce the hull to ensure it wouldn't fall apart when breaking ice.

After the tugboat modification was completed, it was already late December. It was immediately sent to Shandong, and then the modification project of the second ship began.

Floating ice began to appear on a large scale in the bay of Qimu Island from January. By now, a large area of ice had formed, extending from the shore for nearly three kilometers, completely connecting with the coast. By mid-January, the trestle bridge could no longer be used at all. The special service boat squadron moored at the Qimu Island pier was forced to retreat to the sea surface three kilometers away from the trestle bridge. Refugees boarding ships changed to use floating piers: refugees departed from the island and boarded ships via the ice surface.

The arrival of the icebreaker greatly improved this situation. Fuel consumption for burning fires on the island was large, resulting in a large amount of plant ash and coal ash. Lu Wenyuan ordered refugees to pave a channel with ash and slag on the ice surface every day, then use the icebreaking tugboat to break open the channel.
