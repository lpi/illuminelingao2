# Chapter 792 – The Ranch Couple

Wu Nanhai stood before a kapok sapling—one he had planted just over ten days ago. The sapling came from the Farm plantation's nursery, its trunk already fist-thick. It had wilted slightly upon transplanting but the leaves were greening up again. Good fertilizer had been buried beneath the roots; this tree would surely grow into a towering giant, witnessing his and Chuqing's happy life.

A breeze blew, rustling the clustered leaves. A trace of a smug smile appeared at the corner of Wu Nanhai's mouth.

"Master—" Chuqing called from behind him. "The weather is still cool in the mornings and evenings; you should add a layer." She draped a civilian-version M65 jacket over his shoulders.

"Even at its coldest, it's seventeen or eighteen degrees. Nothing to fear." Wu Nanhai took Chuqing's small hand—the skin was rough and calloused. As the Farm's earliest employee, she had always been his capable assistant, not only participating in management but also doing much physical labor herself. The Farm Café's growth from nothing to the elders' favorite unofficial hangout was largely due to her efforts.

Chuqing had to rack her brains managing the Farm's tertiary operations and the logistical needs of the staff; she also took care of the daily lives of the Biolab crowd who ate, drank, shat, and slept at the Farm as if it were a hotel; finally, she attended to the "Master"—Wu Nanhai's every trivial need, from fetching face-washing water in the morning to sleeping with him at night to satisfy all his demands and desires.

Wu Nanhai felt that if Chuqing did so much without receiving a proper title, he couldn't face his own conscience. So he decided to marry her formally. Although some elders questioned whether her background was too lowly for an elder's legal wife, Wu Nanhai insisted: "Status in this time-space has nothing to do with us!" This decision stemmed from gratitude and love for Chuqing, but also practical considerations: marrying a maid with no ties, who didn't even know her own surname, as his primary wife exempted him from all obligations to a wife's natal family. If a wife's background were too good and her natal family too powerful, they might become a ticking time bomb for the House of Elders in the future.

"Master—" Chuqing lowered her head shyly but didn't withdraw her hand. A few days ago, she and Wu Nanhai had formally become husband and wife in the newly completed small chapel. The wedding was officiated by He Ying. Attendees included Xiao Zishan, the Wan brothers from Agriculture, Ye Yuming, Dugu Qiuhun, and the Biolab crowd led by Huang Dashan who lived at the farm long-term. There were also fellow Christians, including Ryan, and key naturalized staff led by Wang Tian… Finally, Bai Duolu attended on behalf of the Catholic Church, gifting a leather-bound hardcover Bible printed with Jesuit sponsorship and signed by Wu Shimang.

The ceremony was simple. At Wu Nanhai's request, the couple placed their left hands on the Bible and right hands on the Transmigrators' *Common Program*, then read their vows together. Wu Nanhai had drafted the vows himself:

"In the presence of God and the witnesses here today, I, Wu Nanhai/Chuqing, take you to be my wife/husband. From this time forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, in joy and in sorrow, to love and to cherish, and to be faithful to you, for all eternity. Amen."

The couple signed the vows to conclude the ceremony. Then Xiao Zishan presented "Elder Marriage Certificate No. 002," signed by Vice Civil Affairs Commissioner Liu Muzhou. After the ceremony, a simple banquet was held at the Farm Café for the guests. The next day, Wu Nanhai personally distributed wedding candy to all elders in Lingao and to all naturalized employees in the Agriculture sector. Everyone was delighted.

"Don't call me Master; call me Nanhai," Wu Nanhai whispered. "We are husband and wife now, not master and maid."

"Mm." Though Chuqing was not new to his favor, this time she had a proper title, and the nourishment of his favor felt different from before. Her face was like peach blossoms, her eyes like spring water—indescribably gentle and charming. She called softly, "Nanhai."

"That's right." Wu Nanhai embraced his bride's shoulders. Though he knew the body in his arms intimately, the feeling now was different from the past.

Behind them stood the newly built Protestant chapel. Wu Nanhai had paid for it himself. Since there were several Protestant elders, he intended from the start for the Farm chapel to host interdenominational services, not just for his own sect.

Wu Nanhai knew about the strong anti-religious sentiment in the House of Elders—"monotheism is all evil cults" was a catchphrase for many. If not for the Jesuits bringing tangible benefits to Lingao, and the need to prepare a religion for the Li and Miao people in Hainan's interior, such cooperation would have been intolerable.

Thus, Wu Nanhai kept a very low profile regarding his chapel. He paid for it out of pocket, settling the deal with Mei Wan over dinner. Hearing it was a small project paid for by Wu Nanhai personally, Mei Wan agreed on the spot—as long as it didn't involve controlled materials or tools, the Lingao General Construction Company had the right to undertake general local construction projects.

The chapel was a colonial-style wooden structure, single-story with a small bell tower—designed by Zhang Xingpei, a bona fide Chinese-American architect. It was tiny, barely holding fifty people for service. The stained glass was bought from Mo Xiao'an, and Wu Nanhai had a carpenter make the cross. There were no other decorations—fortunately, most Protestant denominations aside from Anglicans didn't care much for ornamentation, so simplicity sufficed.

Nailed outside the chapel door was a "Religious Venue License" plaque, uniformly produced and issued by the Religious Affairs Office. All religious venues had to register with He Ying's office. After paying registration fees, data collection fees, and license fees, signing a guarantee to pay religious tax, venue usage tax, and believer poll tax (the "Three Taxes"), and signing a declaration accepting the "Senate Religious Affairs Officer" as the church's "Protector" and paying an annual "management fee," only then was the registration legal.

Wu Nanhai spent a day running errands to bring this "006" plaque back to the Farm, giving the little chapel official status. The night before the wedding, attended by a few fellow believers, Wu Nanhai performed a Protestant baptism for Chuqing in the chapel. Of course, he reported this to He Ying beforehand—believers had to be reported individually as the basis for the poll tax.

"Dean Wu is very unhappy," He Ying had laughed after completing the filing.

"That hypocrite," Wu Nanhai sniffed. "I couldn't care less if he's happy. He just wants a State Church. If he actually became the Pope of Lingao, he'd broaden me and Ryan and the others at the stake."

He Ying laughed it off. But it reminded Wu Nanhai: making a splash would do him no good. Better to keep a low profile.

"Chief, Chief Ye is here, waiting for you to start the meeting," a maid appeared from beside the chapel and reported respectfully.

"Alright, tell him to wait a moment; I'll be right there." Wu Nanhai replied, releasing Chuqing.

Ye Yuming sat in the Nanhai Farm's small conference room. Wu Nanhai didn't distinguish between farm and headquarters; it was less accurate to say the Farm belonged to the Ministry of Agriculture than that the Ministry was located in the Farm. This small conference room was where the core meetings of the Transmigrator Group's agricultural sector were held.

As head of the Tiandihui (Heaven and Earth Society), Ye Yuming had an independent office in East Gate City, but the Society's roots were at the Farm, and he mainly worked here.

"Old Wu, happy events really lift the spirit," Ye Yuming joked, noticing the joy on Wu Nanhai's face.

"Don't tease me. Let's talk business." Wu Nanhai sat down heavily, realizing only the two of them were there. "What? Just the two of us?"

"Dugu and the Wan brothers will arrive soon. I wanted to brief you first," Ye Yuming said. "The Hong Kong development project passed the Executive Committee work meeting. It's decided that the Ministry of Colonial Trade will lead development for now. The Planning Academy is drafting the master plan."

"Isn't that Old Si's business?" Wu Nanhai didn't recall any modern agriculture in Hong Kong. "I've been to Hong Kong many times; it lacks water and isn't suitable for large-scale farming."

"Not suitable, but still necessary. Si Kaide wants some agricultural settlements—appropriate agricultural development to raise Hong Kong's self-sufficiency rate."

Wu Nanhai nodded. "Sunshine in Hong Kong is sufficient, and there is some arable land. The key is building reservoirs. That's not just the Agriculture Ministry's job. I think we should start with non-staple food production: growing vegetables and raising chickens."

"Why not pigs..."

"You call yourself head of the Tiandihui? Pig farming consumes huge amounts of water—we can't afford it without sufficient water sources initially," Wu Nanhai said. "But Hong Kong has an advantage: it backs onto the Pearl River Delta, an agriculturally developed area in this time-space. Acquiring feed is very convenient. We can start large-scale farming there. Start with poultry like chickens and ducks. I think quail is good too—easy to raise. We can promote intensive farming in Hong Kong."

"Let's skip the specific agriculture for now," Ye Yuming saw the topic shifting to technical details and feared they'd digress. "I want to set up an Agricultural Reclamation system."

Wu Nanhai perked up but remained impassive on the surface. "Oh, Agricultural Reclamation?"

Ye Yuming nodded excitedly. "Isn't Ag-Reclamation perfect for developing a place like Hong Kong?"
