# Chapter 885 - National Stock Number

"My plan is to first establish the standardization of Harmony Wheel parts, then implement this standardization system through ordering," Shi Jiantao said. "The indigenous people of Guangdong certainly won't meet our requirements at first, but they have a desire for profit. As long as we propose a quantifiable standard and simultaneously help them achieve it, after a period of time they will be able to produce according to our requirements."

Chinese enterprises before the 1980s also did poorly in controlling tolerances. In the relatively precise aviation industry, they still couldn't achieve complete interchangeability of parts for the same model of aircraft. If 20th-century China, with thirty years of industrialization, couldn't do it, let alone the Ming shipbuilding industry which was entirely in a state of handicraft production.

Wu De expressed great doubt about this. In their experience, handicraft workshops in this time-space, unless directly under elders' management and operation, were far from meeting industrial requirements in both product quality and production efficiency.

"Honestly, I'm not very optimistic about your idea. This process is too long; I'm afraid it won't happen overnight," Wu De said. "To raise the technological level of indigenous shipyards, there's too much training and retooling work to be done."

Most shipwrights were illiterate; parts dimensions and shapes relied entirely on memory. Skills were passed down orally. To establish parts standards for such a group of artisans and make them produce according to certain specifications—Wu De thought the investment was too great.

Rather than painstakingly cultivating them like this, it would be better to simply annex the indigenous shipbuilding workshops, merge all their manpower, and retrain the craftsmen according to the new model.

"To be honest, I'm not very optimistic about your idea," Wu De said. "I've seen plenty of indigenous craftsmen. Their hands are skillful and their brains smart, but making them understand weights and measures, understand the significance of modern metrology—instead of using their hands or crude measuring tools—is very hard for them. Just this retraining will consume a lot of manpower and time. Do you think we can wait? Naturalized citizen craftsmen are under our direct management; we can supervise and correct them at any moment. Now you want to issue orders to independent workshops one by one, making them follow a system they don't understand at all—I'm very worried about the actual operational results."

"You're right." Shi Jiantao knew Wu De made a lot of sense, and he found it hard to refute. "But I think we can try. Even a one percent success rate would greatly alleviate our production pressure. Try outsourcing some small parts to them for manufacture; even if it fails, it won't have a huge impact."

Wu De considered it repeatedly and agreed to his plan—but limited him to trying only within a smaller scope.

Through Shi Jiantao's hard efforts, the Planning Commission finally issued an order to the Hong Kong Shipyard to build 24 H-800s, all standard models. According to requirements, Shi Jiantao had to complete at least two-thirds of the order before the end of 1631.

Wu De issued the approval documents for material requisition and the usage permit for shipbuilding funds.

In the fiscal budget for the year 1631 at the beginning of the year, the Planning Commission obtained a sum for buying or building ships, specifically to acquire a transport fleet. Part of this money was successively allocated to Lingao Shipyard to build Type 901 tugs and several coastal barges. The remaining funds hadn't been touched yet because the shipyard's capacity was limited.

Originally Wu De intended to convert part of the funds into foreign exchange to buy ready-made large-tonnage Guang ships or Fu ships from Guangdong, but because the Elder Council's current "foreign exchange"—silver reserves—was tight, it hadn't been done yet.

The funds were counted in circulation notes, but Shi Jiantao was located in Hong Kong, and according to his plan many raw materials had to be procured from Guangdong—circulation notes had a very small circulation range in Guangdong, basically not going beyond Guangzhou city. Circulation notes could circulate in a small scope in Guangzhou largely due to the Purple House's prestige and financial power.

Once outside the city gates, circulation notes had no purchasing power. So Wu De reminded Shi Jiantao to apply to Delong Bank for a certain amount of "foreign exchange" to pay for raw materials imported from Guangdong.

"Now that foreign trade exchange has increased, using grain circulation notes is really somewhat inconvenient," Wu De said. "I don't know how the finance and financial folks plan to carry on. They just think of ways to save silver, but there are many things where silver simply must be spent."

"I'll make revolution through thrift."

"I've given the order to you; you must complete it on time," Wu De said. "You know, I originally planned to buy some large Guang ships and Fu ships directly from Guangdong to participate in the Dengzhou and Zhejiang operations. If you mess this up, things will become very hard to clean up, understand?"

"Yes, I understand. I guarantee mission completion," Shi Jiantao said loudly.

"Guarantees mean nothing to me. Deliver the ships on time." Wu De waved his hand. "If you can't do it, I'll have to petition the Executive Committee to carry out wartime mobilization of all our subordinate vessels, which will seriously affect imports, exports, and supplies for foreign stations."

Shi Jiantao wanted to do outsourced production. This brought the issue of industrial standardization compilation and management—which executive committee members and elders had emphasized countless times since the beginning of Lingao's industrial construction—to the forefront as a problem urgently needing solution.

Industrial standardization compilation and management wasn't needed only by the shipbuilding industry or industrial enterprises. When the Planning Commission and General Staff drafted the plans for the Dengzhou and Zhejiang operations, they had already encountered massive difficulties in material mobilization, transport, storage, and distribution.

During the operation to develop Sanya, the Planning Commission and the military had already encountered all sorts of inconveniences in transport and supply. Although Lingao's industrial and agricultural system could produce product types and specifications that, by old time-space standards, were inferior to a hypermarket, the complexity of organizing supply far exceeded the elders' expectations.

If they hadn't had Hong Huangnan, who at least had a considerable theoretical foundation in logistics work, responsible for compiling supply tables and formulating supply procedures, the Sanya development supply work would have turned into a disaster.

Even with professionals in command, various errors frequently occurred during supply: urgently needed materials weren't shipped, while materials with large stocks in Sanya were shipped batch after batch; goods meant for Sanya were shipped to Leizhou, and goods for Hong Kong were sent to Sanya. There were even mix-ups where bills of lading didn't match the goods upon opening crates. There were also incidents of goods "drifting away" [being lost/embezzled]. In Planning Commission inventory checks, certain goods were found to be "whereabouts unknown." And months later, these goods declared "not in planned location" would mysteriously appear in inventory checks at locations no one had thought of.

In the Dengzhou and Zhejiang operations, logistical supply would be even more burdensome. Not only did they have to supply rations for over a hundred thousand refugees, but they also had to provide clothes, medicine, shelter materials, cups for drinking water, bowls and chopsticks for eating; organizing ships for long-distance round-trip transport also required setting up rest stops and supply points along the way. These stations needed construction materials and supplies for staff and garrison troops; ships needed refitting and replenishment of ship materials during shipping operations...

Not only was the quantity of supplied materials large and the variety diverse, but supply had to reach multiple nodes: according to the plan, multiple rest stops would be opened along the route from Dengzhou to Lingao for turnover. These rest stops all had to supply various materials based on the daily number of refugees detained, arriving, and departing.

To ensure orderly and accurate material supply, a joint meeting of various departments was convened in the Executive Committee compound conference room. The meeting topic was establishing a standardized code system.

The meeting was led by the Planning Commission, but the suggestion to use standardized codes was proposed by scardal and Hong Huangnan.

Hong Huangnan's idea was simple: to supply materials for the ever-expanding army and foreign stations, a standard code system was urgently needed to support logistics. Otherwise, he and his pitifully few dozen logistics staff couldn't handle large-scale logistics work. A sentence Hong Huangnan often said was: Among Lingao's various military departments, the Logistics Command is an invisible organ. It not only lacks a commander but doesn't even have a single guard.

Scardal's idea was much more complex. He suggested implementing this system comprehensively across all fields. In the "standardization construction" promoted by the Elder Council, this was an important link.

At the meeting, scardal took out a pile of materials to distribute to everyone: this was a US military code system standard that looked completely unrelated.

"This is our important reference object. US Military Standard Code: NSN—National Stock Number. When the US military decides to adopt any item, it gives it a stock code. In the future, any warehouse and unit of the US military and NATO worldwide will use this code as the ID number for this item..." scardal said.

"An item refers to, for example—" Facing the suspicious elders, scardal continued, "For example... this M65 khaki cloth of mine, size L, is one type. Whether made in Taiwan or Mexico, as long as it passes certification, it's the same item. But if it's a size M, or desert camouflage color, that's another item, because Americans don't want to send desert camouflage uniforms to troops in Alaska.

"Now for every part in the shipyard, we can give it a code. This code follows a file, underneath which includes all blueprints, performance data, quality standards, failure and supply records, lists of qualified suppliers and blacklists of unqualified suppliers. Whether it's a screw or a mast, when someone wants to use the same thing in the future, they can find it by retrieving the file."
