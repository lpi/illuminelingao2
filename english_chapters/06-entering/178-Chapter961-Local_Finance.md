# Chapter 961 - Local Finance

Chen Ce reflected that Qiongshan's commerce and industry was the most developed in Hainan by this timeline's standards—and had developed entirely naturally, which was fundamentally different from Lingao's commerce, which had only developed through Australian support.

"Only been county chief for a few days, and the tail of localism is already showing," Chen Ce thought to himself. It seemed there would be plenty of trouble to come on tax issues. Currently Lingao had no specific revenue-sharing system—how to allocate collected taxes looked like it would be another headache.

Though Chen Ce was based at Delong Bank's main office and busy every day planning branch establishments in various locations and setting up rudimentary tax institutions, the contradictions within the financial system were gradually surfacing as the Spring Awakening and pacification campaigns concluded.

As county-level governments were successively established in each area, local finance and taxation became unavoidable topics.

Though Lingao County had Xiong Buyou as the most senior county office director, Lingao hadn't actually established any separate administrative institutions. All construction and investment came directly from the Executive Committee and had nothing to do with local finance or taxation.

As for the Greater Sanya District, it couldn't really be considered a local government either—it was merely a dispatch organ. Because the area had originally had neither population nor commerce or agriculture, Sanya was a colony built entirely by the Senate from scratch. The vast majority of its output—minerals, agricultural products, forestry products, and fishery products—was all shipped to Lingao. Meanwhile, everything the area needed—clothing, grain, tools, even fuel—was all shipped from Lingao. All investment came from Lingao allocations, and operations depended on materials and cash allocated from Lingao. The Greater Sanya District was completely dependent on the Lingao mother body—economically, it was a thorough vassal.

But the various prefectures and counties they now controlled—though each county's economic condition differed—were each independent economic entities. Each had a town, several villages, and varying populations. They had farmland and varying scales of commerce and industry. The old "Lingao equals Senate" model could no longer continue. Each county now had an Elder as county chief, with an entire administrative apparatus.

With administrative apparatus came local finance problems. The fiscal policy of the Great Ming in the Zhu Yuanzhang era was basically to take everything to the center, leaving almost nothing for localities. From a centralization perspective, this was certainly effective, but for local administration it was a disaster. With insufficient local funding, county magistrates could do almost nothing. Even maintaining basic administration was difficult. Naturally, without some creative thinking—obtaining off-budget working capital—one simply couldn't remain an official.

The Elders all clearly saw the drawbacks of this system. But how to improve it touched on an enormous topic—not just taxation and fiscal systems, but the critical issue of power allocation between central and local governments. The Executive Committee had recently been holding expanded meetings on this issue, often not adjourning until midnight.

Until a definite plan was formulated, the temporary solution was full allocation of administrative expenses. When each county office director took up their post, the Finance Supervisory Department would issue a one-time allocation of Circulation Vouchers. Currently, Circulation Vouchers still used grain as reserves. Based on the allocation amount, the Planning Commission would allocate an equivalent quantity of grain as reserves. Of course, the grain itself didn't need to be transported long distances. After the pacification campaign ended, the Planning Commission controlled considerable grain stocks in each county—primarily grain from the former county granaries and grain confiscated or seized during the pacification campaign and land surveys. Some of this was transported to Lingao, but the remainder stayed stored in each county's granaries—it just needed to pass through the books.

The funds distributed to each county didn't go directly to the county office directors but were deposited in a fiscal dedicated account at the local Delong branch, with the county office director making specific disbursements. Because local administrative expenditures covered myriad matters, the Finance Supervisory Department had specifically compiled a list of recurring expenditure items. This provided a rough idea of how much needed to be allocated each month. These expenditures were designated funds for designated purposes—county office directors couldn't use them for other purposes. This prevented situations where a leader would overspend on a whim and then be unable to pay wages at month's end.

Compiling the recurring expenditure table was not easy. No one knew how much administrative expenditure a seventeenth-century county needed each month. And Lingao's fiscal expenditures had no reference value whatsoever—they had always been lump-sum accounting. Particularly regarding personnel supported by the fiscal budget, how to arrange each county's institutions, how many personnel to establish, what ranks and salaries they would have—none of this had been completely decided yet. Management could only be relatively rough. Cheng Dong required that temporarily budgeted amounts should err on the side of tightness rather than looseness, to prevent future difficulties in tightening a loosely begun policy.

Expenditures beyond recurring expenses were temporarily left for county office directors to spend within their monthly allocation, with the requirement that they could only save, never overspend.

As for county revenues—including taxes, fines, seizures, and so on—all were to be remitted to the Planning Commission and Finance Supervisory Department.

This unified collection and expenditure fiscal policy was of course quite inappropriate, particularly in completely eliminating counties' fiscal autonomy. In essence, it wasn't much different from the Great Ming's local fiscal system—it might even be more rigid. But for now, this was the only option. The Executive Committee's requirement for local governments was "stability"—while maintaining local public order, they were to first collect local resources to support the Senate's operations. Economic development was not the county office directors' primary task.

This system had been officially implemented since the end of last year—over a year now—and every county on Hainan Island had roughly established a fiscal system according to it. Operations were reasonably normal.

But for Chen Ce, during his fiscal business trip around Hainan Island, he had already sensed some pushback. The county office directors of various counties—especially those in counties with historically higher agricultural levels and relatively better economic conditions, such as Qiongshan, Chengmai, Wenchang, and Ding'an—were quite dissatisfied with the unified collection and expenditure fiscal system and strongly hoped for reform.

Chen Ce mostly understood their thinking. Becoming a county office director meant being the lord of a hundred *li*. Most people had a certain career ambition. Even ruling a poor small county town with only tens of thousands of people, they still wanted to make something of it. The eternal popularity of management simulation games demonstrated most people's mentality. Moreover, each of Hainan Island's counties was rich in resources, with far too many projects that could be developed. Chen Ce had visited Changhua Fort—this small fortress garrisoned by only a dozen people. Though surrounded by poor beach sand with no real resources to speak of, before the Spring Awakening campaign, merely raising goats on the sandy beaches had achieved great success—in the autumn of 1630, Changhua Fort had provided Lingao with three hundred sheep.

Investment and construction couldn't rely solely on direct investment from the Planning Commission—the Planning Commission had too many projects to invest in. With the Lingao regime's limited manpower and materials, just managing "central enterprises" was overwhelming, let alone developing local industry. And the overly stretched manpower gap also made the Planning Commission uninterested in local industry.

Chen Ce knew that last month the Executive Committee had used the disaster to pull a large batch of laborers from Qiongshan, which had caused Liu Xiang's dissatisfaction. On Hainan Island, doing anything at all required people. Though he had ultimately made an effort to complete the task, the contradictions between central and local had already begun to show.

Hopefully the contradictions would ease after the Shandong population arrived, Chen Ce thought. With population, given the Elders' abilities, each showing their talents to develop some local industry shouldn't be too difficult—of course, the fiscal system would also need reform.

Chen Ce smiled and said: "Once the Shandong refugees arrive, you'll find it easier to raise your fish. Didn't Lingao also bring in large amounts of population from Guangdong before it prospered?"

"Waiting for Shandong refugees—that'll be at least the end of the year, won't it?" Liu Xiang didn't know his thinking and was just speaking enthusiastically. "I already have some ideas—they don't need much investment, just people to do the work." He then told Chen Ce about the small county industries he and Tang Menglong had conceived using coal from Jiazi Mine.

Chen Ce deflected with vague pleasantries without answering directly. Then he steered the conversation back to summer tax collection.

The moment Qiongshan County's summer tax proclamation was posted, it caused an uproar. Because this was the first year the Australians were in charge of tax collection, everyone—poor and rich, commoners and scholars alike—paid close attention.

At the teahouses and informal gatherings under trees throughout Qiongshan, most people assumed the Australians would most likely "follow precedent" and continue collecting taxes according to the Great Ming's methods. For hundreds of years, imperial grain and national taxes had been collected this way. Besides, last year in Lingao the Australians had also collected grain levies according to the old Ming system—they had merely improved the collection methods and surveyed the land, making it much fairer than before. Everyone figured that since land had been surveyed in Qiongshan too, they would naturally follow Lingao's methods. For powerless commoners, being able to pay taxes according to regulations without mysteriously incurring additional burdens would be the best possible outcome.

However, when the summer tax proclamation appeared, everyone was shocked. Just "apportioning corvée into land" alone was astounding enough, and the strange progressive system created an even greater uproar.

For a while, in streets and alleys, in front of and behind houses, in reception halls and residences, everywhere was filled with whispered discussions. Among the common people, though most couldn't read, they had others read the proclamation to them and listened to the propaganda team's on-site explanations. One by one, smiles appeared on their faces, though some wore expressions of disbelief.

"So doesn't this mean we don't have to pay taxes?" Several farmer-looking men gathered before the proclamation discussing. "My family only has six *mu*—whether it's 'standard' or not, it's definitely first tier."

"Then I don't qualify either."

"We can finally catch our breath. After the disaster, we were just busy replanting sweet potatoes. If we had to pay taxes on top of that, we'd be stretched thin..."
