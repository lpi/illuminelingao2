# Chapter 1143 - Friendship and Railway

The distance from the trading house to the church wasn't far, but walking took over twenty minutes. The two walked slowly along the road, breathing fresh air carrying the sea breeze, while admiring the bustling construction scenes along the way. Westerly was interested in everything on the construction site: steam cranes, manual tipcarts, mixers... these clumsy, black, rough construction machines and vehicles from Lingao aroused endless interest in this boy.

"Pity I didn't bring a sketchbook..." the boy said with excitement and regret. "I must get my sketchbook when we return from church!"

"Alright, alright," Cleadia said with a smile.

They walked a distance and discovered a new road appearing parallel to the road ahead—no, calling it a road wasn't accurate; it was two iron rails lying across wooden timbers, extending into the distance.

"Sister, this must be a railway," Westerly said. "I heard sailors say Australian docks all have these rails for moving heavy carts—similar to what the English use in quarries."

Rail laying had temporarily halted because rails hadn't arrived in time; only roadbed materials and some equipment were piled up. Westerly couldn't suppress his curiosity; he stepped off the road and climbed onto the roadbed.

Westerly squatted down, beginning to study the rails and sleepers, then carefully examining the spike connections. Cleadia knew her brother's hobby and waited aside for him.

"No climbing on the roadbed!"

Westerly had taken a few steps when he heard someone shouting—he didn't understand Chinese, so he just stared blankly toward the source of the sound.

He saw a manual handcar flying toward them on the rails. Westerly looked at the vehicle curiously and said to Cleadia, "I think if we could ride that thing to church, it would be faster..."

While they were speaking, they saw a young woman pumping the handcar alone. Upon closer look, it was Zhong Xiaoying. These days Zhong Xiaoying came to the trading house daily to chat with Cleadia and teach her Mandarin. They had become good friends.

Zhong Xiaoying wiped sweat from her forehead. "Eh? It's you two? Why aren't you resting in the trading house? What are you doing climbing on the railway?"

"Our vaccination scars have healed," Cleadia said first. "There's a church over there; we decided to go look."

Westerly stepped forward and greeted her in stammering Cantonese: "Miss! Can I catch a ride?"

Zhong Xiaoying smiled and shook her head, gesturing: "This car isn't safe..."

Westerly shrugged helplessly. Suddenly struck by an idea, he pulled a pretty little cloth bag from his pocket and waved it at the girl: "Not riding for free; I have a gift..."

Zhong Xiaoying still shook her head. Cleadia had a way; she went up and whispered, gestured, and talked with Zhong Xiaoying. Finally, Zhong Xiaoying smiled at them: "In that case, get on..."

Overjoyed, Westerly jumped onto the car, looking curiously at this handcar, seeming to want to ask about everything. Zhong Xiaoying knew what he meant and waved her hands repeatedly: "I only know how to use it; don't ask me how it works—you'd better ask my Honorable Father."

"Dr. Zhong? I'll definitely go ask for instruction." Westerly was full of curiosity about Zhong Lishi. "Where is he now?"

---

"He's at Customs. Specifically: on the Customs Clock Tower—installing the big clock." Zhong Xiaoying said. "Hold that handle there, push down. Right, we have to put effort in together..."

Zhong Xiaoying and Westerly pumped the handcar together, advancing toward St. Anthony's Church. On the way, Westerly kept asking: "Can I go see the big clock Dr. Zhong is installing? I'm very interested in these mechanisms—" Seeming worried his request might not be accepted, "I learned metalworking and carpentry skills from an artist; I can help."

This speech was a bit difficult for Cleadia, whose Cantonese was at a very rudimentary level. She had to use all her skills to basically convey her brother's meaning.

"Of course." Zhong Xiaoying smiled. "Honorable Father's carpentry skills aren't good; he'll be very happy to have a free worker."

Cleadia asked, "There are so many people here; are they all immigrants you moved from China?"

"Yes. Taiwan originally had no civilized people. Only headhunting natives."

"You are truly amazing," Cleadia said sincerely. Although Tayouan had existed for many years, it remained a desolate trading post. If not for Fort Zeelandia under construction, Tayouan wouldn't even count as a town.

"The Committee is amazing." Zhong Xiaoying's face showed an expression of infinite adoration.

The church established by the Lingao Church in Kaohsiung was small, a wooden structure. This church and the New Daoism temple were neighbors: separated only by a road. Both sides were peaceful enough, their goals the same: continuing the battle of "eradicating heresy" started on Qimu Island. He Ying's instructions to both major churches explicitly required them to "save souls" with the strictest posture.

Missionaries sent from Macau were bent on surpassing New Daoism in the battle of "saving souls," so fanatical in the "eradicating heresy" battle in refugee camps that a priest carelessly caught an infectious disease and was summoned by the Lord. Since Macau had no one to send immediately, the Lingao Church sent John Dermot. This red-headed Irishman was happy to escape the endless work of painting stained glass and frescoes, taking up the post happily.

However, when Zhong Xiaoying accompanied the siblings into the church, John Dermot was still squatting gloomily by the wall painting frescoes. This prefabricated small church manufactured by Lingao Construction Corporation had no decoration; he had to do it all himself.

And things didn't end there. Since that Committee member Zhong with the receding hairline arrived in Kaohsiung, he'd been coercing and bribing him to make iron hands and numerals for the big clock—and specifically demanded Gothic script.

John Dermot felt it hard to balance church beautification, soul saving, and serving the Committee. Especially the first two were supremely important to him. But thinking of the Bishop's teachings before departure, he dared not refuse Committee Member Zhong's request.

Today Committee Member Zhong appeared again. Just as he was helpless, the appearance of Zhong Xiaoying's group temporarily rescued him from his predicament—Dr. Zhong was entangled by Westerly: this boy was full of curiosity about the big clock he was building, constantly asking this and that.

"Mr. Zhong, may I look at the mechanism inside that big clock?" Westerly finally asked.

"Of course. Won't you rest a few more days?"

"This child can't wait..." Cleadia smiled. "Dr. Zhong, rest assured, my brother knows metalworking and carpentry. You can find a use for him."

"Alright. You can come find me directly at the Customs Clock Tower tomorrow." Zhong Lishi nodded. "Xiaoying and I are living at Customs these days."

"Then can Sister and I also move into Customs? That way we can ask for your instruction day and night," Westerly said.

Zhong Lishi thought for a moment. "Yes. But you need to apply to the trading house and fulfill necessary procedures."

The next day, the Westerly siblings moved into the Customs Building with their luggage—although Kaohsiung Customs was operational, actual business volume was tiny, and there were many empty rooms above the second floor. After finding a room, Westerly couldn't wait to join the clock construction team.

There were several craftsmen on the clock tower, mostly carpenters, led by Ma Linxi, a refugee taken in from Shandong.

After retrieving his life from the icy sea, Ma Linxi was sent to Jeju Island. He stayed there forty days. As a skilled man, he was viewed differently in the refugee camp and quickly incorporated into a direct-subordinate labor team to participate in Jeju Island construction. Naturally, the food quality he received was better than average refugees.

In a few months, he passed a Class C diploma exam. Then he was shipped to Taiwan preparing for transshipment back to Lingao to enrich Lingao Construction Corporation's skilled worker team. However, Ma Linxi's skills had gained him some fame, so Hong Laojun intercepted him and incorporated him into the direct-subordinate engineering team. Shi Dafu felt he had potential and taught him some simple blueprint reading and drawing techniques.
