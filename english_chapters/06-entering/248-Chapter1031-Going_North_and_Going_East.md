# Chapter 1031: Going North and Going East

This reaction was soon reflected at Qimu Island. However, the reports from the various scouts dispatched by Lu Wenyuan remained consistently "no situation found." This made Lu Wenyuan, Chen Sigen, and Zhu Mingxia—the transmigrators who had been brimming with confidence and waiting for the operation to commence—anxious.

According to the timeline, on October 31st, Kong Youde should have raised the flag of rebellion, and by November 22nd, he should have led his army to the gates of Dengzhou City, a mere 22 days later. Now, several days had passed. The scouts inquiring about news along the Huangxian official road should have at least obtained some vague information—such as "someone has revolted"—given that Kong Youde's unit consisted of over a thousand men with excellent equipment, a force not easily ignored.

However, none of the merchants traveling from the Dezhou direction brought such news.

The date soon reached November 10th, yet there was still silence on the roads. The group could no longer sit still. After urgent consultation, Zhu Mingxia decided to send out disguised reconnaissance cavalry—Lu Wenyuan had purchased over a dozen Mongolian horses from the Dengzhou army through his relationship with Sun Yuanhua to serve as mounts for the scouts. The Fubo Army had always lacked rapid maneuverability for battlefield reconnaissance.

Serving as reconnaissance cavalry were not the scouts from the Special Reconnaissance Detachment, but personnel from the Cavalry Training Squadron attached to the Northbound Detachment. Considering that the Dengzhou operation might yield many captured horses, a company from the Army Training Command's Cavalry Training Squadron had been incorporated into the Northbound Detachment for on-the-spot utilization, and one platoon had already been transported to Qimu Island.

The Fubo Army's doctrine for cavalry employment was similar to the light cavalry tactics of the Napoleonic era, primarily used for reconnaissance, harassment, and pursuit, and generally not for cavalry combat or breakthroughs. Therefore, the cavalrymen in the training squadron had all undergone reconnaissance training.

Lu Wenyuan looked at the dozen or so disguised reconnaissance cavalrymen before him: they really looked like losers. They were dressed as single small-time traveling merchants, accompanied by a partner leading a donkey. When they opened their mouths, they spoke an unintelligible Shandong dialect. Lu Wenyuan asked and found they weren't all Shandong locals—they were specially trained, each fluent and glib in the dialect.

"They've been training for over a year. This counts as their first real combat," Zhu Mingxia said. "I originally intended to deploy them later, but I didn't expect their use would be required so soon."

Each reconnaissance cavalryman was equipped with a monocular telescope, a revolver, and two grenades. The cavalrymen looked out for each other, with two teams separated by no more than a hilltop or visual range. According to the arrangement, seven or eight teams were scattered towards the Dezhou direction, searching forward in three to five layers.

The reconnaissance cavalry searched forward along the main road towards Wuqiao, gathering news along the way. However, there was no useful information until a group of cavalry arrived at Sanyuan Town in Wuqiao County, where they finally obtained useful news from local peddlers.

Kong Youde's unit had already passed through this place heading north ten days ago. The chicken-stealing incident did happen, but the matter was later settled—the soldier who stole the chicken and killed someone was beheaded, and the master of the Wang family pursued it no further. Kong Youde had already led his troops away.

But what happened subsequently terrified the local populace, because news came a few days later that a large village dozens of *li* away had been wiped out—although the government claimed it was the work of bandits, everyone said it was likely done by the Liaodong soldiers. Several large households in the slaughtered village had some wealthy and noble relatives, so the matter couldn't be covered up. The local gentry jointly petitioned the county magistrate and sent people to lobby in the prefecture, intending to accuse this group of lawless "soldier-bandits."

"Is there any use in going to the government for this?" The reconnaissance cavalryman deliberately put on an ignorant look. "Back in my hometown, if soldiers kill a few people, the masters in the county won't care at all. They'll insist it was done by bandits. Even going to the masters in the province might not work."

"You, sir, are a traveling merchant with wide horizons; what haven't you seen? For us small folk, if a soldier lord cuts us down, we're cut down. But several large households died in the village, related to several gentry families in this county. One family even has distant relations with Master Wang's family. Master Wang can't pretend not to see—neighbors and relatives, he couldn't explain it away."

The reconnaissance cavalry dared not delay and immediately sent men back to report the news to the transmigrators on Qimu Island.

This aroused the anxiety of the "Qimu Island Trio": the news brought by the reconnaissance cavalry indicated that Kong Youde did not raise the flag of rebellion in Wuqiao as in original history, but had smoothed things over through other means. In this way, he would lead his army further north, eventually either suffering a defeat at Dalinghe, dying or surrendering, or perhaps, due to moving further north with wavering morale, defecting directly to the Manchus.

Once such a situation occurred, the plan to use Kong Youde to disrupt Shandong would completely fail. Consequently, many subsequent plans would need modification. In particular, whether the occupation of Jeju Island was still necessary became a major question.

"If Kong Youde doesn't rebel, we must force him to rebel!" Zhu Mingxia slammed the table. "Otherwise, we'll have to go into battle bare-chested ourselves."

Chen Sigen said, "Can we use Sun Yuanhua to pressure him? With him slaughtering villages and wiping out households like this, Sun Yuanhua would find it hard to shield him, right?"

"I'm afraid not. Sun Yuanhua's skill in managing the army is limited, and his ability to restrain his subordinates is weak. Moreover, the old Dongjiang men are seen by him as capital," Lu Wenyuan shook his head repeatedly. "Besides, this kind of thing isn't rare in the late Ming. Sun Yuanhua wouldn't make things difficult for a valiant general like Kong Youde with strong soldiers over such a matter."

"I think we can only count on the local gentry in Wuqiao. For example, the Wang family." Lu Wenyuan was field personnel who had received considerable professional training in history and had mixed in Shandong with Zhao Yingong for several months, making him relatively familiar with the social conditions of the Ming Dynasty. After consideration, he proposed a new plan.

Lu Wenyuan continued, "The Wang family is a famous gentry family in Wuqiao and very powerful. The head of this family, Wang Xiangchun, was a hardcore member of the Donglin Party. In the past, he was listed in the 'Donglin Water Margin,' nicknamed 'Heavenly Damage Star White Stripe in the Waves'."

"Good heavens, 'White Stripe in the Waves'! The Eunuch Party was quite talented." Chen Sigen laughed.

"And Wang Xiangchun has a cousin named Wang Xiangjin, who is the Administration Commissioner of Zhejiang—not a low rank either. Leaving aside these brothers, Wang Xiangchun alone could make Kong Youde suffer prepared consequences."

The question was whether the Wang family was willing to take the lead. Lu Wenyuan believed the possibility was high.

Since the master of the Wang family was willing to stand up for a servant's chicken, then with a local village slaughtered involving distant relatives, regardless of public or private reasons, their family had to speak up.

"The problem is, even if they speak up, it will be months later. It won't catch up."

Lu Wenyuan scratched his head—since keeping a hair bun, he couldn't wash his hair often and frequently felt his scalp itching. "That is true."

"The urgent task is to find Kong Youde's unit and ascertain his next movements before we can take action," Zhu Mingxia said. Originally, their grasp of historical materials gave them a feeling of "one-way transparency" regarding the battlefield situation. Now, Kong Youde's abnormal actions caused the "fog of war" to descend once again.

"Where are they now?"

According to the reconnaissance cavalry's report, after Kong Youde led his troops out of Wuqiao County City, he traveled north for about twenty *li*, wiped out a large village, and then news was lost.

"...There are still several teams searching along the way; the latest news hasn't arrived yet."

Zhu Mingxia opened the map and marked Kong Youde's last trace. Looking at the map, if he wanted to continue north to Shanhai Pass to execute the mission of reinforcing Dalinghe, he should go east, not suddenly north. To the north were Dongguang County and Nanpi County, far from the route north to Shanhai Pass.

"What is he doing running to Dongguang and Nanpi?" Chen Sigen was somewhat puzzled. "Could it be..." He noticed that both county seats on the map were by the Grand Canal. "He isn't thinking of robbing boats on the canal, is he?"

The Grand Canal was a vital north-south communication line. With hundreds or thousands of boats sailing on the river daily, it was obviously a very lucrative target.

"No, he wouldn't dare." Lu Wenyuan shook his head. "Openly leading troops to intercept canal boats, that would be rebellion..."

"Isn't he rebelling anyway?"

"That's true too."

Zhu Mingxia said, "I estimate: Kong Youde going north to Dongguang and Nanpi is either intending to pull off a big job by the canal, or it's purely a feint."

He believed the latter possibility was greater.

If Kong Youde had the heart to rebel, he could have started in Wuqiao; there was no need to rush to Nanpi or Dongguang. Wuqiao County City alone was enough for him to rob. His avoidance of Wuqiao County City and movement north obviously had an element of clearing his name. If the court wanted to investigate later, he could deny it—his route wasn't originally going north.

"...Kong Youde's men are cavalry, with fast maneuver speed. He could completely go all the way north, wipe out several villages along the way, make a big scoop, then suddenly turn east, returning to the original route to continue towards Shanhai Pass. With sufficient provisions, it's no problem for a cavalry unit to travel 40 kilometers a day."

"But in that case, wouldn't he not rebel in Shandong?"

"There is indeed such a possibility," Lu Wenyuan said. "However, in history, Kong Youde didn't have the intention to rebel initially. The Wuqiao Mutiny had an element of him being forced to participate. It was mainly the lower-level officers and soldiers who decided to launch the mutiny."

This indicated that rebellious sentiments always existed among the old Dongjiang troops in Shandong. Once Kong Youde mutinied in Wuqiao and arrived in Dengzhou, he received responses from Geng Zhongming and other original Dongjiang men. throughout the Dengzhou Rebellion, the rebel army continuously received support and responses from the original Dongjiang old units, growing rapidly.

"On a deeper level, the mutiny of the original Dongjiang old units was an inevitability. Just looking at the situation in Shandong shows."

Lu Wenyuan had stayed in Shandong for several months and dealt quite a bit with the church, government, army, and commoners. In his view, the rebellion of the Liaodong army was inevitable. Conflicts between guest and host armies in Shandong were constant, and the land was barren and the people poor. The gentry and local strongmen held heavy power. The long-sidelined and discriminated Liaodong army had accumulated enough resentment; they only lacked a fuse.
