# Chapter 838: A Rabble

Of course, a telegram for reinforcements also had to be sent. Although Beikai was more than ninety percent confident he could repel the bandit attack, concealing the news of bandits attacking was always a dereliction of duty. He had his life secretary send a telegram informing them that bandits were about to attack Hongji, numbering around two thousand. Hongji had made battle preparations.

In the telegram, he did not explicitly ask whether reinforcements were needed—given Hongji Station's current importance, reinforcements were inevitable. Of course, Beikai very much hoped this incident would leave the Senate with an impression of him as "fearless in the face of danger."

Finally, since the marine platoon had already boarded the ships, he armed the clerks and administrative personnel around him—the most reliable naturalized citizens—Hongji Fort had more than thirty spare Minié rifles in addition to the marines' Minié rifles. He issued these rifles to them and gave each a grenade as Hongji Fort's general reserve.

When the bandits approached Hongji Station and saw the stockade well-fortified, knowing those inside were already prepared, Shen Hu ordered the main force to halt, rest, and cook. This wasn't out of sympathy for his men, but because the bandit column was strung out over more than ten li. Seven or eight hundred men were still behind. Might as well eat and rest first, and wait for everyone to gather. Besides, he had an ally at sea—"Fan Hai Bao." After he arrived, they would advance by both land and sea, with greater chances of success. He heard the mine had a large ship and three small boats by the sea, but Fan Hai Bao had fourteen ships of various sizes. Shen Hu didn't think those few lonely boats could do anything.

Shen Hu's forces were a more "regular" bunch among the bandits. At least wherever they went, someone took care of food and drink. Immediately, some set up pots at the foot of the hill, ordering the dozens of local women captured along the way to boil water and cook.

Shen Hu looked at the fortress opposite Hongji. It was the first time he had seen such a fortress, and he thought it was very crude. That earthen enclosure was at most two persons tall. Although the slope was a bit steep, people could climb up without ladders. The only difficulty was that the ditch outside the earthen enclosure would take some effort to fill.

Other than that, this enclosure didn't look hard to capture at all. Although You Long and You Hai told him there were cannons at the protruding corner sections of the earthen enclosure, Shen Hu didn't care much about this: he had seen plenty of cannons. It took a good while between firing one shot and firing the next. That time was enough for his men to swarm onto the earthen walls.

"What about that earthen enclosure over there? Does it also have cannons?"

"That's where the miners live. No cannons." You Long gestured. "Inside are all coal miners and their families. Not much valuables."

"Good, ignore them for now." Shen Hu laughed lecherously. "After we breach the main fort, we'll take that miners' stockade too and find some women for the brothers to enjoy."

His confidants all laughed together. Shen Hu generously patted You Long and You Hai on the shoulders: "I'll give you two one each!"

"Thank you, Great Chief!" The two were overwhelmed with honor and immediately knelt to pay respects.

"Mm, mm, I think..."

Before he could finish saying what he "thought," he saw a small group of about a hundred or eighty men running toward the street between the two stockades—there were some nice-looking buildings on the street, presumably with valuables inside. The bandits couldn't wait for his order and wanted to start looting immediately.

"Fools!" Shen Hu cursed. These bandits weren't his men; he couldn't control everyone. Besides, he already knew from his scouts that everything on this street had been cleared out. There was nothing but empty buildings.

He watched this group of bandits run chaotically to the street between the two stockades. At that moment, a row of white smoke rose from a corner bastion of the main fort, and the running bandits suddenly fell one after another. The remaining ones screamed and quickly fled back.

"Those bird guns are terrifying!" Shen Hu exclaimed in shock—he had seen matchlock rifles before, but the bandits were at least forty or fifty zhang from the firing stockade. At such a distance, firing was just for show. Let alone killing people, the bullets couldn't even fly that far.

That group of bandits just now had left more than a dozen corpses on the ground. The mine's bird guns not only shot far but were also very accurate.

He hurriedly called You Long and You Hai over and asked them exactly how many bird guns were inside the fortress.

"At most three to five dozen!" You Long said. "We rarely saw anyone with bird guns. The militiamen at the mine all use spears and machetes..."

"Really?!"

"I dare not lie! There definitely aren't more."

But even three to five dozen, such fierce firearms weren't an easy bone to gnaw. Shen Hu hadn't expected the mine's firearms to be so formidable and immediately hesitated.

While he was hesitating, the rear bandits kept arriving. Shen Hu told his confidants to summon all the faction leaders for a meeting to discuss how to attack the stockade. Worried that the news of the enemy's fierce firearms would shake morale, he didn't mention it at the meeting at all. But Hu Lanyan said the enemy was the Australians known for their firearms. Both their cannons and bird guns were extremely formidable, shooting both accurately and far. He proposed using fire attacks and smoke tactics for this assault.

"Send up thick smoke, advance section by section. Advance a section, then send up more smoke." Hu Lanyan gestured. "Our men follow the smoke. No matter how powerful their firearms are, they can't see through smoke, and can only fire blindly. Once we get close, we all rush up together..."

Hu Lanyan spoke enthusiastically, but everyone was skeptical. Many didn't believe firearms could be as powerful as Hu Lanyan claimed. While everyone was talking at once, the large bandit mob gathered outside fell into disorder. In the ancient era lacking communication means, organizing nearly two thousand temporarily assembled rabble was extremely difficult. Everyone had followed Shen Hu to make a fortune. Seeing the stockade right ahead but with the attack delayed, many who had walked all morning were exhausted and thirsty, eager to break through the stockade and indulge in eating, drinking, and rape. Now, with a large crowd gathered under the sun, without food or drink, not knowing what the next step was, some gradually began cursing, some instigated action, and others discussed loudly. The scene gradually descended into chaos. The minor chiefs of various factions struggled to maintain order, but the gathered bandits came from diverse sources, and there were many scattered bandits in groups of three to five who had come to profit—they didn't give a damn about the chiefs.

Suddenly, the unruly crowd, as if receiving a command, surged en masse toward the laborers' stockade. The chiefs couldn't stop them with shouts or commands; they were instead swept along in the chaotic rush toward the laborer camp.

By the time the news reached Shen Hu, the situation outside had spiraled out of control. Except for Shen Hu's own several hundred confidant troops, the rest of the rabble had completely lost order, all surging toward the laborer camp.

From the direction of Hongji Fort, the thunderous sound of cannon fire immediately rang out. In this space of 250 meters, there were now targets everywhere. The gunners on the fortress took advantage of this perfect killing opportunity, furiously firing the two 24-pounder cannons at the surging mass of bandits between the stockades. The militia armed with Minié rifles also fired their rifle bullets at their fastest rate. Then the typewriter opened fire too.

Solid shots with lowered firing angles continuously carved bloody lanes through the crowd at a plunging angle—the shells had enough force that even after penetrating the crowd, they still smashed hard against the wall of the laborer camp, raising dust. The local laborers standing on the earthen walls immediately became agitated, crowding and wanting to retreat—no one wanted this terrifying thing to hit their face.

"No retreat allowed!" Dugu Qiuhun noticed signs of wavering and immediately jumped out, waving his tachi and howling. "Anyone who retreats will be killed without mercy!"

Although the local laborers didn't understand his words, they understood his twisted, ferocious face and the gleaming blade in his hand. Plus, the shining spear tips of the naturalized citizen laborers behind them were almost pressed against their backs. The crowd settled down again after some agitation.

Canister from the cannons and lead bullets from the typewriter rained down on the crowd like a torrential downpour, harvesting lives. Bandits fell one after another. Some bandits' heads suddenly exploded and flew backward; limbs became fragments. The bandits were first stunned by such carnage, then began screaming, letting out inhuman cries, and turned to flee. In less than five minutes, the large mass of bandits rushing toward the laborer camp collapsed under Hongji Fort's artillery fire and scattered in all directions. No matter how Shen Hu's subordinates tried to intercept them, many simply fled the scene directly. The battle hadn't even officially started, and the bandits had already lost a third of their men. Shen Hu was so angry he stamped his feet.

"Chiefs—" Before he could finish, many chiefs were already frantically leaving their seats. Everyone was rushing to gather their own forces. Without forces, there was no capital; what was there to talk about "getting rich together"? Shen Hu, this temporary "alliance leader," meant nothing to them now.

Shen Hu was too angry to speak. He hurriedly ordered his subordinates to gather his own troops to hold the line and see if they could somehow rally the bandit main force. He planned to wait until Fan Hai Bao's forces arrived before making further plans.

At this moment, the marine platoon that had been standing by at sea launched an attack on Beikai's orders. They landed on a beach on the bandits' unguarded flank and rear, launching a surprise attack from the flank and rear of the chaotic mass of bandits.

The sudden artillery fire from the mountain howitzer and the fierce strike from the marine platoon's flank plunged the already panicked bandits into complete chaos. Many were still in shock, and now they completely lost their nerve, caring only about fleeing. Those slightly calmer bandits tried to resist, but the volley fire and a row of grenades had them crying for their mothers. You Long watched his nephew You Hai get blown to the ground, covered in blood. He charged toward the marines without regard for life or death. A marine dodged his broadsword and thrust a bayonet into his chest.
