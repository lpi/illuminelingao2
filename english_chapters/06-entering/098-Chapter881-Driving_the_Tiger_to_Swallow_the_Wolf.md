# Chapter 881 - Driving the Tiger to Swallow the Wolf

Besides a vast collection of electronic Daoist scriptures, Zhang Yingchen's hard drive and optical discs contained the richest collection of BL (Boys' Love) erotica in the entire Elder Council. Even the Great Library's collection couldn't compare.

"I remember Hong Kong published a manga version of *Jin Ping Mei* too. The art style was quite realistic," Lu Zhongxing remarked. "I read it before. The style is different from the Japanese ones; maybe it'll be more popular with the locals. It's just that the plot was adapted into such a tragedy."

Zhao Yingong ate a piece of fried bean curd roll. "That's not the problem. The problem is, how do we reproduce the electronic manga onto stone or wood blocks? We can't print them all out, can we? Just let the workers carve while looking at the screen?"

"Printing them out isn't impossible, or tracing them from the screen. After all, electronic versions will eventually degrade. Hard copies on paper are essential for preservation," Zhou Dongtian said. "When I go back this time, I'll see if I can do photolithography—that depends on whether the chemical engineering folks can deliver. Photo-lithographic plates are much more convenient than stone lithography. Even if that doesn't work, I'll print a few sample copies using stone lithography in Lingao first, then bring them over as masters for you to use: woodblock or lithography, your choice."

As they ate and talked, the conversation turned to how to secure support from the Hangzhou Church. Although Zhao Yingong had successfully established a connection with them, he hadn't yet reached the point where he could freely ask the church for favors. Zhao Yingong visited the church occasionally to build relationships with key figures, primarily aiming to connect with Xu Guangqi's family as soon as possible.

But progress wasn't very smooth. After a few visits, Zhao Yingong sensed that the church leaders were far more interested in converting him than in helping him reach Xu Guangqi. And to prevent getting too deeply involved with the Catholic Church, which might antagonize certain non-Christian gentry, he couldn't visit too often.

Zhang Yingchen, however, seemed confident. "I have a way."

"What way?" Zhao Yingong asked curiously.

"The method is simple." Zhang Yingchen smiled mysteriously.

"Do you know about the Hangzhou Religious Case of the eighth year of Chongzhen?" he asked.

"As for religious cases, I only know about Auguste Chapdelaine and the Tianjin Massacre—the one where Old Zeng got totally humiliated."

"There were several religious cases in the late Ming too. The most famous was the Nanjing Religious Case—"

"Get to the point."

"This can be considered the second major setback for the Catholic Church's mission in China," Zhang Yingchen said with gusto, slowly chewing on a piece of spring bamboo shoot.

This great debate originated from a debate between Giulio Aleni and the Confucian scholar Huang Zhen in Zhangzhou, Fujian. Huang Zhen subsequently traveled from Fujian to Zhejiang, inviting Confucian scholars and Chan masters everywhere to critique Jesuit doctrines. These critical essays were eventually compiled into the *Collection for Destroying Vicious Doctrines* (*Poxie Ji*).

The religious debate in Hangzhou began in the third month of the eighth year of Chongzhen (1635). Huang Zhen visited Chan Master Miyun Yuanwu at Tiantong Temple in Ningbo. Yuanwu then wrote *First Discussion on Discerning Heaven* (*Biantian Chushuo*) and gave it to his only lay disciple, Purun, to post publicly in Hangzhou. The Catholic Church did not respond to this action.

In the eighth month, Zhang Tian (religious name Guangtian), a disciple of the late eminent monk Yunqi (Lianchi), took the *First Discussion* to the Catholic church at Guanxiang in Hangzhou and handed it to the Jesuit Alfonso Vagnone.

However, according to the records in *Second Discussion on Discerning Heaven*, the Jesuits did not respond to this challenge. Consequently, in the ninth month, Yuanwu wrote *Second Discussion on Discerning Heaven* and continued to post it publicly in Hangzhou. The church continued to avoid battle, with only some Confucian converts declining the debate on the grounds that Lianchi's *Explanation of Heaven* (*Tianshuo*), written during his lifetime to debate Matteo Ricci, had already failed.

Subsequently, Monk Yuanwu wrote *Third Discussion on Discerning Heaven*. Meanwhile, based on the church's missionary document *Posthumous Letters on Discerning Learning* (*Bianxue Yidu*), Zhang Tian determined that the author of the previous *Four Points in Response to Grand Master Lianchi's Bamboo Window Explanation of Heaven* was not Matteo Ricci. Furthermore, the Fujian woodblock edition of *Posthumous Letters on Discerning Learning* contained a preface by "Michael" (the baptismal name of Censor Yang Tingyun). In this preface, Yang Tingyun fabricated a story about Monk Yunqi repenting to God on his deathbed.

Thus, Zhang Tian wrote *Discussion Proving Falsehoods* (*Zhengwang Shuo*), attacking the Catholic Church once again.

Throughout this siege, Catholicism remained in a position of avoiding conflict, adopting a policy of withdrawing and not participating in debates. Although some Confucian converts within the church attempted to counterattack, the church leadership consistently adhered to a non-response, non-debate approach—likely having learned lessons from the Nanjing Religious Case. They adopted a posture of "the innocent have no need to vindicate themselves."

Facts proved this strategy effective, for soon ordinary non-Buddhist scholars stepped forward to criticize the Buddhists: "Master Yunqi's virtue in benefiting the world is as bright as the sun in the sky; who can obscure it? Those slanderers only slander themselves; how can they damage his light? Have you not heard the ancient worthy say: 'Of all rights and wrongs, debate none'? Why then chatter on like this?"

Clearly, the Catholic Church's retreat policy successfully portrayed them as victims, saving the weak Hangzhou Church from further attacks and allowing them to weather the crisis safely.

"But right now it's only the fourth year of Chongzhen," Zhao Yingong reminded him. "By the eighth year, the situation might have changed completely."

"Hear me out." Zhang Yingchen continued, drawing out the suspense. "Late Ming scholars mostly had a penchant for 'escaping into Chan Buddhism' to avoid social reality. So the Chan sect is very powerful. The Ningbo, Hangzhou, and Jiaxing region is a major center of activity for the Linji school of Chan. Spreading our New Daoism here will be extremely difficult. You know these Buddhists don't have a great attitude toward Daoism either. If I squeeze in to preach now, it probably won't be any easier than for the Catholics. You know how hard it is to steal customers in a mature market?"

Everyone nodded. New Daoism's success in Qiongzhou was simply exploiting the gap in the Li minority areas where no mature religion existed. On the mainland, it wouldn't be so easy.

In the Two Zhejiang region where Buddhist influence was deep-rooted, it was impossible for New Daoism to snatch food from the tiger's mouth in one go. But by provoking a debate between Buddhists and Jesuit missionaries in China ahead of schedule, they could first weaken Catholicism's influence—though small, they had a group of enthusiastic priests and believers willing to sacrifice everything, possessing great potential. Secondly, using this religious case to blow the reputation of Buddhism. After all, throughout the case, Buddhists consistently displayed an aggressive posture. This would inevitably incur disgust from some neutrals.

"If I want to get a piece of the pie here, the only way is to drive the tiger to swallow the wolf, ruining the influence of both religions." Zhang Yingchen raised his wine glass and took a sip. "I intend to trigger this debate early, profiting from the struggle between the two tigers."

"You want to trigger the religious case early to muddy the waters; I get that." Zhao Yingong raised question. "But how does that help in winning the church's assistance?"

"Old Zhao, you're smart all your life but confused for a moment." Zhang Yingchen smiled. "Right now, the Hangzhou Church is stable and the world is at peace. You're just icing on the cake. If I stir things up, it'll be like dumping a heavy blizzard on them. Then if you bring over a single piece of charcoal, they'll be shedding tears of gratitude!"

Zhao Yingong wouldn't even need to exert much effort, let alone publicly debate for the church. He just needed to suggest to the church leadership the strategy historically adopted by the church—meeting all changes with constancy—to let the church weather the crisis safely and win their goodwill.

"Daoist, you really are black-hearted," Mei Lin complimented him, though privately disagreeing. Many events require accumulation of conditions to occur. Rashly triggering it early might just be wishful thinking on this Daoist Zhang's part. For one thing, in this vast sea of people, where would they find the instigator Huang Zhen? History books only said he was a scholar from Zhangzhou, Fujian. No details on his residence or profession. Furthermore, a person's thoughts are always developing and changing; this person might not even have thought of debating Catholicism yet.

"Not black-hearted. But if this succeeds, it benefits everyone's mission completion." Zhang Yingchen looked smug. "And I'm not speaking out of thin air. Huang Zhen arrived in Hangzhou a few days ago."

"How do you know?" Mei Lin was astonished.

"Yesterday, someone came to ask me to treat a patient in an inn. This person is named Huang Zhen, also from Zhangzhou, Fujian. Who else could it be?" Zhang Yingchen said. "I'm currently putting him off, saying I have too many patients and will visit him in a few days. I wanted to discuss it with you first."

"How could he come to Hangzhou?" Zhao Yingong was greatly surprised. "According to the history you cited, he should still be in Fujian right now."

"The butterfly's flapping wings may have already caused some deviations in history's trajectory." Zhang Yingchen said. "His sudden appearance in Hangzhou is truly an opportunity delivered to our door. If we don't utilize it, we'd simply be letting down the butterfly."

Several people fell into contemplation. Zhang Yingchen's plan to drive the tiger to swallow the wolf, provoking conflict to fish in troubled waters, was indeed creative. Creative deduction suggested a high chance of success, but no one knew if consequences would spawn other issues. After all, events might not proceed entirely according to their wishes.

Zhang Yingchen looked at Zhao Yingong. Everyone was a senator, and Zhang Yingchen had the power to "act as circumstances dictate," but he belonged to the Hangzhou Station after all. This matter wasn't minor; without the station chief's nod, he shouldn't act unauthorized.

"To achieve great things, one doesn't stick to trifles." Zhao Yingong nodded. "This is feasible."

"However, this means it's inconvenient for me to come here often." Zhang Yingchen said. "Although I won't personally step forward, if someone investigates carefully, they might see some clues. If I associate with you too much, the church group might get suspicious of you too."

Zhao Yingong said: "I understand this. We'll communicate by letter in the future. If we need to talk in detail, I'll go to Qingyun Temple to offer incense. Though, we don't need to absolutely avoid meeting—that would look too deliberate."
