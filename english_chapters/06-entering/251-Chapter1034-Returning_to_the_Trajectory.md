# Chapter 1034: Returning to the Trajectory

"Whether you did it or not, we'll talk about it later." Kong Youde said in a low voice. "Everyone gear up, assemble your men and horses immediately, no unauthorized action. Send people to recall all the brothers from the various battalions who have gone out!"

"Yes!" The generals knew something fishy was going on and feared a great change was imminent, so they dared not quibble and answered in unison.

Kong Youde stood up, instructed his personal guards to help him put on his armor, and ordered his personal general to gather his personal guards and household servants, preparing to set out.

"No flags, no talking on the way!"

After the personal general left, Kong Youde called back Li Yingyuan who was about to leave:

"You come with me."

Li Yingyuan's face instantly went pale, not knowing what idea Kong Youde had.

Kong Youde speculated that Li Jiucheng and his son must be involved in this strange event. He feared this was Li Jiucheng's strategy of luring the tiger out of the mountain, planning to coerce the entire army into mutiny as soon as he left. Therefore, he preemptively detained his son to accompany the army's movement.

In less than the time it takes to eat a meal, Kong Youde had set out with fifty cavalrymen. He went in person primarily to figure out who exactly was doing this—ever since he arrived in Dongguang, the reconnaissance cavalry that had been tailing the main force endlessly gave him a premonition of imminent danger.

"Which group is messing things up inside!" Thinking of this, he involuntarily tightened the reins.

Kong Youde and his cavalry team soon arrived near the river gate. He didn't lead his men straight into the fire scene, fearing misunderstanding. Instead, he ordered the whole army to stop two *li* away from the fire. He himself led a dozen household servants and carefully rode over.

The attackers seemed to have already retreated; there were no sounds of killing or hoofbeats. Many grain boats moored by the riverbank had caught fire, the flames raging and the heat unbearable. The boatsmen were scattering in panic. Some saw this patrol and, thinking they were cohorts of the attackers, all fled to avoid them.

On the riverbank, quite a few corpses lay scattered. by the firelight, one could see they were mostly boatmen from the grain transport boats—Kong Youde drew a sharp breath; this was robbing government boats. Don't look at how rotten the boats were or how beggar-like the boatmen were; they were thoroughly "government boats" and "government soldiers." Attacking grain boats would be a huge crime if escalated.

A personal guard used his spear to pick up an arrow from a corpse and presented it to Kong Youde. He took it and looked carefully, recognizing at a glance that it was a "government arrow," and one from Dengzhou at that.

Kong Youde gripped the arrow shaft in his palm, feeling cold sweat on his back. Could this group be from Dengzhou? To dare act so recklessly!

The grain boats were a mess, with various goods and transport grain scattered on the deck. Kong Youde saw his household servants' eyes lighting up, each eager to try, and hurriedly shouted to stop them.

The street was empty, every house closed and locked, a deathly silence. Only several large mansions near the sluice gate had their doors wide open, with various valuables scattered on the street.

Suddenly there was a thud under his horse's hoof; looking closely, it was a human head.

Looking more carefully, seven or eight headless corpses lay discarded on the street. Their clothes weren't luxurious but were the attire of well-off families. A household servant next to him who had recently served as a scout and been here whispered that these were the residences of the gate officials and gatekeepers.

Seeing the silk and cloth scattered on the ground and the loose coins with broken strings, one knew how rich these families were. Kong Youde couldn't help but curse secretly: "Damn it!"

He pulled the reins, having no heart to look further: although the comers were in a hurry, they were undoubtedly government soldiers.

As for which group they were, he didn't know and didn't want to know—although internally he was already convinced this was the work of Li Jiucheng and the others.

"You are forcing me to be Lu Junyi!" Kong Youde hated secretly.

However, things having come to this pass, saying more was useless. Kong Youde knew very well that regardless of whether Li Jiucheng sent people to do this, he would have to take the fall—or rather, the original Dongjiang troops would have to take the fall.

"Fine, you get what you asked for. It's inconvenient for me to block your good deed for my own future anymore!" Kong Youde thought hatefully and shouted the order, "Return!"

At this moment, he had made up his mind to raise the flag of rebellion. Not only because he currently had no way to explain himself, but also because he realized his control over his subordinates was so poor: Li Jiucheng had pulled most generals and soldiers over without showing off, doing such a big thing behind his back!

If he continued to refuse blindly, he would either be killed by the mutineering soldiers and generals or force to abandon the troops and flee. Of course, given Sun Yuanhua's attitude toward him, he might not be blamed and might even be protected. But thereafter, he would become a commander with only a few dozen personal guards and servants, a general in name only.

Without soldiers, a military general in this increasingly chaotic era lost his capital. Whether being an official, getting rich, or even settling down and establishing a life, one needed soldiers in hand.

To regain control of the men and horses, he had to participate in the rebellion and seize power back in the turmoil. This troop was brought out by Kong personally; they were bewitched by Li Jiucheng and others now only because the future was bleak. He believed that as long as he went with the flow and used his skills well, he would soon regain control of the troops.

Although Kong Youde was unwilling to rebel, once a decision was made, he would walk the path to the end. He suddenly reined in his warhorse and ordered his subordinates:

"Transmit the order to all battalions immediately, pull out and come here!"

Since the action had started, regardless of who did this job, it was already counted on his head.

In that case, if he was going to do it, he would do it thoroughly!

The market here was prosperous, and many ships were moored. Although the fattest sheep had been slaughtered, the remaining wealth was still substantial. Being able to easily obtain a large amount of grain, wealth, and livestock yielded much more than sneaking around robbing houses and taking out a few villages before.

With this large capital in hand, the army's heart could be stabilized. With grain and pay in hand, the soldiers would be willing to sell their lives for you. With soldiers, one wouldn't need to fear whatever the next step was.

Even the imperial court, as long as you had strength, would count on you to sell your life with a sword and gun. They would absolutely not fuss over how many commoners you killed or how much wealth you robbed.

Thinking of this, he turned his horse's head and raised his whip toward the direction of the market: "Enter the town!"

Chen Sigen stood on a small hill at the edge of the woods a few *li* away, observing the town with infrared binoculars. When he saw groups of cavalry starting to flood into the market and beginning to burn, kill, and loot on the riverbank and streets, his heart still sank. Although their goal of forcing Kong Youde to rebel had been achieved, the innocent commoners of this market had become victims of the Senate's "strategic goals" for nothing.

The initiator, will he have no posterity?

Thinking of this phrase, he couldn't help feeling a heartfelt unease.

"Squad leader." The Special Reconnaissance Detachment sergeant called him softly.

"Hm, what is it?" Chen Sigen turned around.

"The government army's scouts are starting to come over."

Chen Sigen secretly praised Kong Youde for being a veteran general; even while unleashing soldiers to loot, he didn't forget to guard the perimeter. It seemed that being able to mix into the position of the Three Feudatory Kings among the forest of surrendering generals in the late Ming was crucially due to outstanding ability, in addition to surrendering early.

"We withdraw!" He ordered, "All units return to base camp."

Since Kong Youde had started unleashing soldiers to loot the market, it meant he had determined to rebel. The following matters could be left to the reconnaissance cavalry to stick close to him and watch his movements at all times.

With the Special Reconnaissance Detachment's surprise attack as the trigger, a large army that had long harbored discontent finally raised the flag of rebellion. The anger and resentment suppressed in the hearts of the Dongjiang army for a long time instantly turned into a highly destructive torrent.

After Kong Youde's unit rose in rebellion, they immediately returned to Wuqiao and launched a surprise attack on it. Because the local magistrate had been alerted—he had heard about the "horse bandit" activities in neighboring Dongguang County—he closed the city gates in time. The county seat was saved for the time being. Seeing he couldn't succeed immediately, Kong Youde didn't entangle himself under the city walls. After wanton burning, killing, and looting in the local area, he immediately waved his troops back to Shandong.

They obtained a large number of livestock, grain, and wealth in Dongguang and Wuqiao. They loaded the wealth and grain onto the looted horses, mules, and donkeys, driving them along with the main force towards Shandong. The dust from men and horses rolled, visible from more than ten *li* away.

"Rebellion started!"

The terrible news spread on the main road. Urgent documents from Dongguang and Wuqiao counties began to be passed through the relay stations. However, throughout the vast land of Shandong, apart from the transmigrators in Longkou who were rubbing their fists and waiting in full battle array, no one yet anticipated how the situation would develop. While the scholars and people of Shandong slept, Kong Youde's Liaodong iron cavalry was already rolling in.

The Qimu Island Trio watched Kong Youde's movements nervously: they had successfully pulled Kong back onto the historical trajectory needed by the Senate. Now, it depended on whether his next direction would be consistent with original history.

The news from the reconnaissance cavalry relieved them: after sweeping through Wuqiao, Kong Youde advanced rapidly southeast along the route of the modern National Highway 104. The local governments were caught off guard and had no troops to use. Those who reacted quickly could emergency close the city gates and escape disaster. Those who reacted slowly fell one after another. The rebel army successively captured Ling County and Linyi. After capturing a large amount of grain, wealth, and livestock, they followed the route of Provincial Highway 316, capturing Shanghe, then went east from Shanghe, successively crossing the Tuhai River and the Yellow River, capturing Qidong (now called Gaoqing). Afterward, they attacked southeast, capturing Xincheng (should be present-day Huantai).

Because his subordinates were almost all cavalry and they had looted a large number of livestock to carry supplies, and didn't get entangled in any single place or city on the way, supplementing the team by looting supplies and livestock as they went, the marching speed was very fast.

In less than a month, on November 22, 1631, the spearhead had arrived under Dengzhou City.

The rebel army merely swept past Huangxian. Kong Youde did not attempt to attack the county seat—returning to Dengzhou as soon as possible to get the response of the old Dongjiang units and grow his strength was what he cared about most.
