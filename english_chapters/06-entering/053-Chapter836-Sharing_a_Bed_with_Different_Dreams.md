# Chapter 836: Sharing a Bed with Different Dreams

What was most cruel was that in the second half of 1630, the Special Reconnaissance Command believed they should give their various special reconnaissance squads opportunities for combat training. Multiple special reconnaissance squads were deployed to the various prefectures and counties in northern Qiong to conduct extensive "hunting." The special reconnaissance squads operated in small groups, infiltrating core locations in the mountains to conduct harassment and ambush operations. This kind of combat, where a gunshot suddenly rang out, one person was killed, yet the enemy was nowhere to be seen, was hard for even the most stubborn bandits to bear. During their movements, an invisible grim reaper constantly followed the ranks. Besides the occasional gunshot harvesting lives, any bandit who strayed from the main group's sight would sometimes completely disappear.

Hu Lanyan's gang couldn't maintain a foothold. Between deaths and desertions, they were left with only twenty or thirty men in the end. They didn't dare disband the gang and go down the mountain to live honest lives—after all, they had killed the work team back then. Now the Australians had put a bounty of three thousand circulation vouchers on his head. Those who provided useful information could get one hundred to five hundred circulation vouchers. Any bandit who captured or killed Hu Lanyan and Gou Er and turned them in would be pardoned, and the Australians would even resettle them. After the news came out, Hu Lanyan looked at his subordinates one by one, all with green eyes glinting, looking exactly like hungry wolves.

Hu Lanyan complained every other day that Gou Er had come up with the idea to "eliminate the work team," creating an eternal blood feud with the Australians—now there wasn't even the possibility of surrendering.

Gou Er was at the end of his rope and had to keep drifting. While drifting, he happened to see a notice: it was about the trial of "war criminals." The notice was old and half-damaged. But the content was roughly legible. Basically, the Australians had sentenced some government soldiers captured when coming to "suppress bandits" to "war crimes." Some got "hard labor" and some got "death sentences." The Australians trying government soldiers wasn't particularly shocking to him, but Gou Er saw Lai Da's name at the end of the long list of death sentences.

The news of Lai Da's death shook Gou Er greatly—Lai Da wasn't an important person, just one of the useful lackeys under his command. Even now that he was at the end of his rope, Lai Da wasn't an important person to him. But Lai Da's death seemed to announce something to him.

Living in constant fear, Hu Lanyan finally couldn't hold on in Danzhou. He gathered the remaining twenty-odd men and announced that they couldn't stay in Danzhou anymore and planned to flee to Changhua. Those who wanted to follow could continue to follow; those who didn't could disband here.

Most of the Hu Lanyan gang were locals from Danzhou, and no one wanted to go to Changhua—besides, how would they survive in Changhua? Nobody had any idea. Many had long been thinking of disbanding and going home. When Hu Lanyan mentioned disbanding, except for a few diehards, everyone ran off.

"Are we really going to Changhua?" Gou Er knew something about this place. It was all "savages" there. Venturing slightly inland meant entering Li people's territory. Their small band of outside bandits were strangers to the place from head to toe, didn't speak the language, and couldn't operate at all. Not to mention there were only seven or eight of them left now.

"Of course not." Hu Lanyan had already made plans. "Let's cross the sea! Go to the Champa Kingdom! I have a few old brothers there, sailing a few ships for business at sea. Let's seek shelter with them first!"

Although Gou Er didn't want to leave his homeland, he was currently at his wit's end. He couldn't stay on Hainan Island anymore. It was better to take shelter overseas first—he roughly knew that Champa wasn't far from here, just a day or two by boat. If things improved, coming back would be easy.

So Hu Lanyan, Gou Xunli, and four or five confidants together quietly found a fisherman family on the beach, paid a few taels of silver, and went to Jiangping. Jiangping was a "no man's land" on the Sino-Vietnamese border, inhabited mostly by "fishermen" who were half-fishers, half-pirates, as well as many desperados from both China and Vietnam. Once the group arrived in Jiangping, they finally settled down and got a peaceful night's sleep. Next was to resume their old profession, continuing the no-capital trade.

When Shen Hu wanted to pull off a big job and sent people to recruit in Jiangping, these two came along. Now Gou Xunli and Hu Lanyan, leading their dozen-odd brothers, had gathered with the main force in a valley dozens of li from Hongji. Variously dressed and oddly shaped bandits from all factions sat or stood around fires. Some were cooking food, some had taken off their rags and were picking lice, and others were drinking and gambling. From time to time, bursts of laughter and strange cries could be heard. They carried various weapons: rusty broadswords, sharpened bamboo spears, and some even had European sabers and Japanese tachi and uchigatana. Some simply held farming tools and harpoons. A portion who looked more "professional" carried bows and arrows and matchlocks. There were even a few small iron cannons.

Gou Er lay on the ground pretending to sleep—it was warmer here than in Qiongzhou. Hu Lanyan was drinking with relish. This was sent by Shen Hu. Each faction's leaders received some share of wine and meat.

"Brother!" Hu Lanyan kicked Gou Xunli. "Don't sleep! Get up and drink together!"

Gou Xunli slowly got up and took the clay cup. The wine was local rice wine, unfiltered, with floating dregs. A fermented, sour, rotten smell immediately rushed into his nose. In the past, he wouldn't even have looked at it. Even the lowest servants and thugs in his mansion wouldn't drink such inferior wine. Then thinking of the Gou family members killed by the Australians and his son whose whereabouts were unknown, he held the cup in a daze and forgot to drink.

"Brother, what's wrong? Live for today while you can." Hu Lanyan smiled meaningfully, raised his cup and took a big gulp.

"Nothing." Gou Xunli took a sip. "Tomorrow we're going to fight the Australians..."

Hu Lanyan looked around and said in a low voice: "Brother, what do you think we should do tomorrow?"

Shen Hu was leading such a motley crew. The sea forces were beyond Shen Hu's control; the pirate chiefs would naturally be responsible for the sea attack. But for the thousand-plus men on land, there had to be an order for battle. Who goes first and who goes second.

"I'm afraid Shen Hu will force us brothers to lead the charge, help him wear down the Australians, and then come in at the end to reap the benefits." Hu Lanyan said.

"We only have a dozen or so people. Shen Hu won't bother with us. Even if he wants cannon fodder, it won't be our turn." Gou Xunli thought about it. "He probably thinks that place is a piece of fat meat. I think Shen Hu will launch a two-pronged attack."

"What do you mean?"

"Think about it. Shen Hu has several hundred men himself. But he recruited so many others to do this together. He must feel that he's not confident doing it alone. But he's also afraid others will take too much of the good stuff. So he definitely can't let outsiders take the lead. Besides, nobody's stupid. Without benefits, who wants to charge first and sacrifice their own people for nothing? So it must be that he leads one route himself, and the other small groups attack together on another route. Once the stockade is breached, whoever grabs what keeps it. As long as the stockade is breached, his people are more numerous and can definitely take the biggest share."

"Well said!" Hu Lanyan admired sincerely. "I also felt there was some scheme of Shen Hu's, but I couldn't figure it out." He poured himself another cup of wine. "What do you think we brothers should do? We're few in number. Tomorrow we'll be swept along in the charge, and even if the stockade is breached, we won't grab anything good..."

"Big Brother, do you think we can breach the stockade tomorrow?" Gou Xunli smiled bitterly. "Shen Hu should be grateful if he escapes with his life tomorrow. They don't know, but don't we brothers know the Australians' capabilities?"

Hu Lanyan shook his head: "It can't be that bad, can it? I heard from Shen Hu's scouts that there are only a few dozen people with Australian bird guns inside, and the rest have spears..."

Gou Xunli kept shaking his head. Hu Lanyan thought of their gang's experience in Danzhou and immediately deflated.

"What do you think we should do? Just sneak away? But we came all this way for nothing?"

Of course, this trip wasn't entirely fruitless. It was agreed in Jiangping that upon arriving at Hongji, they'd be given some money and grain first. Hu Lanyan's group also received some silver and rice.

"Hmph, I think we should talk to Shen Hu about that smoke-screen-then-charge thing. Let the Australians suffer a bit at least!" Gou Xunli said viciously—although he knew it was insignificant to the Australians, he still hoped to kill a few more bald bandits to vent his anger. "And then—" He rolled his eyes and whispered.

Shen Hu stood on the mound with dozens of confidants behind him, looking smugly at his "forces" heading toward Hongji. Although these forces looked barely better than beggars. And because they were looting and raping along the way, the column was strung out and moving extremely slowly. Shen Hu watched one guy wrapped in what were probably some stolen rags, and another who had probably just raped a woman in a village they passed through and simply hadn't put his pants back on, swaggering along the road. Fortunately, the weather was warm here; being stark naked wouldn't freeze anything.

Shen Hu didn't care much about the behavior of these people. Anyway, in another half an hour, the main force composed of Shen Hu's stronghold and several other smaller bandit gangs would all arrive at Hongji. The mere thirty soldiers guarding the mining area were certainly no match. According to intelligence, the mining area had only about seven or eight hundred adult men, most of whom certainly wouldn't take up arms to resist—most would scatter and flee for their lives. The remaining resistance would be just those militiamen. A few cannons might cause some trouble, but he estimated at most they would delay the fall of the stockade by a few hours. And the fortifications of the mining area didn't look solid at all—the walls, though very thick, were quite low. With a little effort, one could climb up.

Breaking the stockade would definitely yield lots of good stuff. The three stockades on the Hongji side now housed over a thousand people. Food and provisions alone were stored in great quantities. Rumor had it that many fine Chinese goods had also been shipped in, as well as ships moored in the harbor—though those were the prey of Fan Hai Bao from Jiangping. Fan Hai Bao had long been coveting the boats with new fishing gear at Hongji that could catch lots of fish in one haul, so this time they hit it off immediately.
