# Chapter 963 - Over-Fulfillment

The Grain Levy Bureau established branches in the county seat and major market towns to facilitate tax payment. The collection unit was Circulation Vouchers. Taxpayers could also pay in grain, gold, silver, copper cash, or other goods, which would be converted to Circulation Vouchers at the grain reference price. The Finance Supervisory Department had originally wanted to completely ban silver and copper cash circulation in the outer counties as well, but at this stage Circulation Vouchers' status in the outer counties was still not sufficiently established—for now they could only accept multiple payment methods simultaneously.

To encourage major landowners to pay more grain while also supporting Circulation Vouchers, Cheng Dong had already instructed the Delong Grain Shop to raise grain procurement prices somewhat. This way, converting the same quantity of grain to Circulation Vouchers yielded a slightly better exchange rate, giving grain-paying households a modest advantage.

Under Liu Xiang's "guidance," collection work in Qiongshan proceeded rapidly. Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, and Chengmai were the four "priority counties" for summer tax collection—not only did they receive extra professional personnel, but they were also given maximum support in terms of force backing. Each county was guaranteed at least three infantry companies, plus a local county security company. Officers were all instructed to fully obey the Elders in each county and do everything possible to assist with collection.

Qiongshan County was the priority for summer tax collection, and Liu Xiang hoped to fully demonstrate his "governing capability" through this collection effort. He therefore kept especially tight control over collection work. All county office work that wasn't essential was temporarily suspended, with personnel dispatched in different directions to assist with collection. Civilian laborers were recruited to repair granaries and level roads. Two hand-cranked straw-weaving machines were shipped from Lingao to weave the straw sacks used for storing grain. The Delong Qiongshan branch also added more floor scales and personnel at its business department entrance to ensure all grain-paying households could sell grain and complete taxes with maximum speed.

The weather grew hotter by the day. Propaganda team members were all highly enthusiastic, performing in streets and alleys daily, posting slogans, dancing lion dances, and publicizing the new tax law. Drums and gongs sounded constantly around the county seat—the noise was tremendous.

This atmosphere artificially created a sense of urgency and enthusiasm, pressing everyone to hurry and pay their taxes.

No matter how unwilling the major landowners were in their hearts, everyone recognized that the Australian summer tax had to be paid. When Hai Shuzu returned and told everyone that "Director Liu" was also planning to settle accounts on decades of tax arrears, they all decided it was better to obediently pay the Australian summer tax and stop bringing up Ming dynasty history. If those old muddled accounts were truly reckoned, even bankrupting their households wouldn't clear the debt.

A portion of people were deeply resentful about apportioning corvée into land and abolishing the corvée exemptions for gentry and scholars. Combined with the recent land survey campaign, which had seriously harmed the interests of the few with scholarly degrees, they all realized that under outlander rule, the good old days of lording over the countryside were gone forever. Each harbored bitter resentment. For now, with gleaming bayonets everywhere on the streets, and Qiongshan being too remote to form any effective coalition, these people could only lie low with suppressed hatred, putting on an appearance of obedient, law-abiding citizens. Besides paying taxes according to regulations, some even proactively sent their children to study in Lingao to demonstrate their "sincerity."

Some also coordinated privately, exchanging bitter remarks. There were also those who actually had little land but held a *xiucai* degree and moved in wealthy households' circles—pedants whose "exemptions" were canceled under the new regulations even though they would have owed no tax anyway. Still, thinking about their "corvée exemption" privilege being revoked, they felt deeply humiliated. After all, the first benefit of a *xiucai* degree was grain and corvée exemption—besides the economic benefit, it was a privilege. Now without that privilege, they felt diminished. They too joined the gentry's grumbling. A few even went to offer sacrifice at Wanshou Temple on the first and fifteenth of each month, paying respects to the Great Ming's imperial ancestors to show they hadn't forgotten the Ming. Nursery rhymes like "Short-hairs don't live long; iron ships will never float" also began circulating in the streets.

Lu Cheng reported such information to the Security Bureau while also briefing Liu Xiang, who wasn't concerned. What he cared about was grain. Besides, government institutions were gradually being established, local security was not a problem, and the army and security companies provided backing. What great waves could these people stir up?

"Don't worry—just keep watching them closely. Once I've squeezed them dry, we'll see what tricks they can play." Liu Xiang was full of confidence. "Besides, isn't there the county security company? Flash some bayonets and let's see who dares talk or move out of line."

"The county security company is mostly former military households except for officers and NCOs—they may not be reliable." Lu Cheng followed the Political Security Bureau's "suspect everything" thinking model.

"We'll see. Army ideological education is Wei Aiwen's job—I can't interfere." Though Liu Xiang had some fondness for Lu Cheng, he very much disliked her working style. He had too much to do and no time for "catching class struggle" all day.

"Just keep watching them." He said. "Have you started on the assignment I gave you to monitor the tax personnel?"

"It's already in progress," Lu Cheng reported. She hesitated. "Chief, we're short-handed. Watching the gentry and watching the tax personnel—we're a bit overwhelmed..."

Qiongshan County's political security surveillance network was the largest outside of Lingao. The "informants" taken over from the Foreign Intelligence Bureau alone numbered over twenty, but facing seventy or eighty regular and temporary collection personnel, these numbers were inadequate.

"Leave fewer on the gentry side—the main force should focus on this tax collection work. Too many new people—if we don't watch closely, problems can easily arise."

"But shouldn't the Cheka be handling this..."

"The Cheka handles account auditing—that doesn't conflict with your work." Liu Xiang waved his hand. "That's settled."

Summer tax collection in Qiongshan County proceeded very smoothly. Under the progressive system, households with less land, though hit by the disaster, had relatively lighter burdens and wouldn't face extreme hardship. Households with more land faced heavier burdens, but had more savings from previous years. Those with genuinely special circumstances preventing tax payment, after verification, also received certain exemptions. The saying "taxation is an important lever for regulating the economy"—Liu Xiang now had a personal understanding of it.

Under Liu Xiang's full-effort collection campaign, with only half the collection period elapsed, Qiongshan County had already achieved the equivalent of eighteen thousand taels of treasury silver, with final totals expected to reach around thirty thousand taels. This revenue made Wu De "greatly pleased." When Liu Xiang came to report, he kept vigorously patting his shoulder, nearly bruising it.

"It's nothing—just doing what I should. Serving the Senate, you know." Liu Xiang endured the pain in his shoulder, thinking this old fisherman and navy man really had too strong a grip. He struggled to maintain his smile and put on a modest expression.

"You're being modest. Of the four priority counties in northern Hainan, Qiongshan was the first to complete targets ahead of schedule—and exceeded them." Wu De gestured for him to sit on the rattan sofa chair. "At the last meeting, I told Old Ma: whether the leadership team is tough or not is very important!"

Liu Xiang laughed dryly. It sounded like the Executive Committee was dissatisfied with the county office directors in the other counties. But this was a sensitive matter—best not to comment. He simply kept quiet.

Wu De seemed to have guessed his thoughts and smiled: "We're in a difficult situation right now—I'm sure you know."

"Yes. I see from the newspapers and documents that the center isn't having an easy time—too many places needing money."

Wu De was momentarily taken aback at being referred to as "the center"—no one had ever called the Executive Committee that before. But he didn't correct it:

"Everywhere is demanding money, grain, and people—too many projects in motion." He smiled bitterly, patting the documents piled on his desk. "Just the construction and development on Hainan Island is no small expense, and we still have to expand off the island: Taiwan, Shandong—all bottomless pits!"

When Liu Xiang heard this, he asked: "The Shandong operation has already begun?"

"It's fine to tell you—you're an Elder." Wu De said. "Zhao Yingong has already connected with Sun Yuanhua's side and is preparing to first establish an estate there as a base. Though the scale isn't large, there's still infrastructure investment required—and he's also planning some agriculture there—that also requires investment. Taiwan, even more so. And then there's Jeju Island." At this he shook his head. "Our territory, frankly speaking, is just one Hainan Island, and more than half is still undeveloped—few people, little land. Trying to squeeze oil from stones while worrying about popular revolt."

Liu Xiang hastily said: "Squeezing oil from stones is impossible—the common people couldn't stand it. In Qiongshan I'm still following the Lingao experience: the so-called 'Reasonable Burden'—the wealthy bear more, the poor bear less. As long as things are done fairly, the common people can accept it."

"And the gentry and scholars?"

"They certainly have objections, but don't dare act on them. The previous bandit suppression and land survey already scared them witless."

"Hmm, you need to be careful. Though they don't dare act openly, these people have great influence and significant sway over the common people. You must guard against them scheming in the shadows." Wu De reminded him. "Qiongzhou is our base—it cannot fall into chaos."

"I understand." Liu Xiang put on a devout expression of "accepting instruction." Seeing that Wu De had nothing more to say, he quickly said: "I have a few matters I'd like to report."

Wu De smiled: "Go ahead—you've come to ask for things, haven't you?"

"Director Wu, you truly see through to a thousand *li*..." Liu Xiang's face had grown considerably thicker. His purpose in personally coming to Lingao to report on collection work was to obtain the resources he wanted—if he didn't apply during this opportune moment, who knew when he'd be able to get these things.

"Alright, we're all Elder comrades. Let's speak directly. What do you want?"

Liu Xiang produced his planning document from his fake BOSS briefcase and explained the several small county industries he and Tang Menglong had conceived.
