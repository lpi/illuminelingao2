# Chapter 1192 - Buying "Goods"

The threshing ground outside the stockade was now the market. Rudimentary sunshades were set up chaotically. Rebel soldiers, chests bared, swaggered back and forth in groups, some drunk. Groups of refugees were driven onto the open ground like merchandise. Those sent to the market were mostly women and children—rebel officers and soldiers had plenty of women and young boys to vent their lusts on, but some wanted sons to continue their family lines after years without them, or wives if they had none. Kong Youde, though a general for years, had been wifeless until only getting a wife after the Dengzhou Mutiny.

Young women with some looks received better treatment; fearing sunburn would lower their price, they at least had a shed over their heads. Ordinary coarse-handed farm women could only kneel by the walls awaiting selection. Each was disheveled and filthy, sallow and emaciated.

Here there were both "public goods" and "private goods." The latter were mostly young women, usually looted by soldiers and officers, played with until they were bored, then brought out for resale.

Besides the human market, there were piles of junk markets occupying even more space. Stalls were spread out filled with objects: everything was for sale here. From tattered clothes stripped off piles of corpses to gold and silver toys, jade ornaments... farmers' tools, merchants' abacuses, actors' wardrobe chests and instruments, even coffins prepared by wealthy families were here. Anything found in homes, yamens, shops, or even temples was looted and sold. Some items even bore mottled earth stains—burial goods dug up by bandits raiding wealthy graves amidst the chaos of war.

Those coming to buy included not only rebel soldiers but also all sorts of daredevils in these chaotic times—rascals who would snatch money from a boiling pot—gathering like flies smelling a corpse to scrape up advantages. Recently a batch of human traffickers had risked coming by sea from South Zhili, currently buying up young women.

Buyers and sellers alike held clubs and swords—there was no order here. Disputes over price leading to knives being drawn were frequent. As for theft and robbery, they were commonplace. Just a few steps to the market's edge, one could see bloated corpses covered in flies. Rows of blackened heads hung inevitably on wooden poles.

Huang Ande frowned. Like Cao Qing and Zhu Si, he wore a Lingao-made pig-snout mask as instructed by the medic. Even so, the stench of corpses constantly drilled into his nose. Their strange appearance occasionally drew onlookers, but no one dared make noise—the rebels were a rabble, and even Li Jiucheng couldn't completely control every stray soldier effectively, but the consensus was that people under the "Qimu" brand were not to be messed with. The rebel commander guarding the market knew if he provoked Master Lu, this place would be slaughtered from top to bottom, so he strictly ordered his subordinates: anyone showing disrespect to Qimu Island visitors would be dragged out and beheaded immediately.

"It's Master Huang!" Huang Ande was strolling when a sturdy man wearing a ragged military vest, chest exposed, came up and clasped his fists. He was the head guarding the market, originally a servant by Kong Youde's side, who had also taken the surname Kong. Now that Kong Youde was Vice Marshal, he naturally rose with the tide to scrounge a "Guerrilla" rank, specifically leading a squad to run the market here.

After exchanging greetings, the Squad Leader asked: "How about it? Master Huang, the usual rules or...?"

"The usual rules, of course," Huang Ande said. "Three hundred able-bodied men. You count them first—last time you cheated us, stuffing in so many old, weak, and sick. Over forty died before we even arrived, not even worth the grain they ate on the way! If something like that happens again, Master Lu won't give a single grain." Saying this, he took out a blue stamp and handed it over.

"Look at you." Although Kong Guerrilla was servant-born, he seemed self-taught in business, smiling profusely as he made excuses. "That last batch was definitely not me deceiving you—how would I dare? They were all genuine able-bodied men. It's mainly that they stayed in the human pen too long, didn't eat enough, and the weather's hot—walking all that way, how could a few not die? If you ask me, if I hadn't picked especially strong ones for you, at least half would have died reaching the island. Never mind them—when the Marshal marched a few days ago, men dying of heatstroke were dropped all along the road! This sun is poisonous."

"Let's not talk about that. This time you have to pick them properly—if too many die on the road, next time maybe we'll ask you to deliver the goods," Huang Ande said.

"Good, good, I'll go prepare the goods right now. Will you inspect the women and children yourself as usual, sir?"

"Yes. Everything according to the usual rules."

Kong Guerrilla immediately called a personal attendant, instructing him to lead "Master Huang" to the human market to select people.

This wasn't Huang Ande's first time on this errand. Born a refugee himself, he knew the importance Elders attached to population. And he knew the Chiefs were different from other powers, valuing women and children especially—often prioritizing the evacuation of women and children. The first batch evacuated from Qimu Island had been women and children. He had also vaguely heard that the Chiefs were particularly interested in Shandong girls—especially those tall women with broad shoulders and long legs suited them best. So when selecting, he couldn't help sizing them up carefully.

He walked along choosing; those he fancied he pointed at, and Zhu Si and Cao Qing would stamp their arms with the carved blue stamp. Nearby rebel soldiers would bring the person out and corral them separately.

For those stamped—whether women personally selected by Huang Ande or men casually swept up by Kong Guerrilla—once stamped, it meant having a life. As long as they survived to the transit station. If they had children or family, one stamp saved the whole family. By rule, the whole family could follow. Thus people frequently begged those stamped to falsely recognize them as family. If a single man was stamped, immediately women would be willing to be his wife.

In the past they used hanging wooden tags, but somehow everyone learned that following them meant eating full meals, so often as soon as a tag was hung, someone would snatch or steal it, causing fights and cries of injustice, even resulting in deaths. Finally, they switched to stamping.

Master Lu's instructions to him were simple: prioritize natural feet, height over 1.5 meters, healthy women under forty. Whether they had children didn't matter. As for children, as long as they weren't disabled, all were wanted.

The natural feet condition was harder to satisfy—Shandong's foot-binding custom differed from Jiangnan's. In Jiangnan, rural women worked the fields, so rural women generally didn't bind feet. But in Shandong, foot-binding was widespread; even farm girls rarely had unbound feet. So the natural feet prerequisite wasn't mandatory. Other conditions were relatively easier to meet.

Huang Ande walked and selected. In the human market, women and children stared at them with wide eyes. Though rebel soldiers prevented rushing, whenever Huang Ande's gaze turned their way, they involuntarily wanted to stand and lunge forward—until forced back by rebel swords and spears. This terrifying, expectant gaze of begging for life sometimes made Huang Ande afraid to look.

Especially seeing the orphans in the market—it was miserable and pitiful. They were unclad, lying or sitting, extremely weak. Small and frail, with no one to care for them, they were at the very bottom of the human pen's food chain. Huang Ande sighed while trying to take every child who looked reasonably healthy.

Every person he took from here was one more life saved. But reception capacity in Zhaoyuan and the island was currently limited. The special service boats could only carry a few hundred people each time, so Lu Wenyuan gave him a quota of maximum one thousand people per trip.

Finally, he went to the "small sheds." Sold in these small sheds were generally women of better appearance or from middle-class families and above. Although buying such women couldn't be done at the "bulk price" and required paying silver cash, inside they often found women fitting the Chiefs' aesthetic tastes. Chief Zhu allocated him twenty taels of silver each time specifically to purchase such women. The guide price given to him was three taels per person.

Special guards watched outside the shed. Only those showing silver to demonstrate sincerity could enter to "inspect goods." Huang Ande had been a few times; the guards knew his background and didn't question him. Zhu Si, however, was entering for the first time and couldn't help looking around curiously. Suddenly his whole body shivered, and he tugged Huang Ande's clothes.

Huang Ande turned his face and saw Zhu Si blushing red, head lowered, afraid to look. Huang Ande knew he was likely still a virgin boy, unable to handle the spring scenery in this shed.

The shed wasn't big but packed with people. Under the sunlight, the smell of sweat was overpowering. In the center was an empty space cordoned off by rope, prohibiting close approach. The women for sale were stripped naked one by one and pushed inside for buyers to inspect. Looking was allowed from outside the rope, but touching strictly forbidden. Otherwise, swords and spears would serve.

Huang Ande knew some buyers from out of town were extremely picky, rejecting even those with slight scars on their skin. A young woman with excellent figure, looks, and skin sold for at most five taels—not only a tenth of the purchase price in Jiangnan, but in Jiangnan buying a girl would never allow such inspection. No wonder traffickers from South Zhili risked their necks to come here to "buy goods."

If it were ordinary times, Huang Ande would tease the lad, but the current "spring scenery" was a scene of boundless misery. The women had first lost homes and families, then suffered repeated rape and abuse by rebel soldiers. Tortured into stupor, looking dull-witted. Doing whatever told, acting completely shameless even under the gaze of a crowd of men, letting people critique them—even someone experienced like him couldn't muster interest for jokes.
