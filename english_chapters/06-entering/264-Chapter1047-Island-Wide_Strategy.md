# Chapter 1047: Island-Wide Strategy

The news of the occupation of Jeongui was delivered to Feng Zongze, who was presiding over the Seongsan beachhead position, along with Nangong Wudi's report. Although fully occupying Jeju Island would inevitably mean shouldering the burden of supplying food for forty to fifty thousand local commoners, Feng Zongze believed it was worthwhile.

Because exiles and official slaves were mostly settled in concentrated areas, the population distribution on Jeju Island was highly intensive, with sixty to seventy percent of the population distributed in the three cities and the nine coastal garrisons. It was easy to achieve the goal of occupation-control-utilization. The three cities and nine garrisons all had plenty of official buildings available—don't look at Jeongui as just a large walled village in terms of appearance and economic level, but the various official buildings inside the city were all there: Government Office, drill ground, barracks, County School, government granary... Although the standards were not high, they were all vacant houses that could be utilized. It could save a lot of raw materials and labor for building houses.

Refugees from Shandong couldn't handle heavy physical labor initially, and there was also the problem of acclimatization to overcome. Feng Zongze believed that at least in the initial stage of Operation Generator, local labor and facilities should be used extensively.

From this point of view alone, feeding these tens of thousands of commoners was not a losing business. Currently, what the Senate lacked was population, and Koreans were also objects that could be fully utilized.

Since the Senate was even prepared to assimilate and utilize the commoners of Tonkin, a "Little China" like Korea was an even more suitable object. Furthermore, if there really was a situation where the population of Jeju was too large and the food supply couldn't keep up, they could use the empty tonnage of the fleet returning from transporting refugees and supplies to transport some people to Kaohsiung to participate in development—their condition would always be much better than the refugees from Shandong.

At the same time, it would change the population structure on the island—solving the problem once and for all. When he thought of this, a smug smile couldn't help but appear on his face.

Feng Zongze stared at the map in the tent, marking and drawing on the glass plate with colored pencils. Currently, the military cleanup work was going very smoothly. The special task force had already occupied Jeongui County Seat and the two garrisons of Suji and Seogwi near Seongsan. Hundreds of Joseon soldiers were captured. The southern line of Jeju Island, except for Daejeong which was temporarily unoccupied, had basically been cleared of Joseon forces.

Summarizing reports from various detachments, the military strength of the Joseon Dynasty on the island was extremely weak. Not only did they have no ability to resist this invasion, but they couldn't even harass. When attacking the two garrisons of Suji and Seogwi, conflicts that could be called battles did not occur. Basically, after the troops fired and shot down a few soldiers, the whole army disbanded.

Judging from the situation of clearing the two garrisons of Suji and Seogwi, the armed status of the "Nine Garrisons"—garrison posts set up by the Joseon Dynasty on the island—was very poor, with many vacancies in soldiers. According to the confession of captured Joseon soldiers, the difference between the quota soldiers and actual soldiers in the garrison posts was more than half.

Each "Garrison" had hundreds of official slaves used to cultivate the official land allocated by the Joseon government to the garrison post. The original intention was to support the soldiers with this, but in reality, like the Wei-Suo system of the Ming Dynasty, it had long been decayed. The produce from the land basically fell into the pockets of local garrison commanders and local officials.

Jeju Island was not a fertile land, and agricultural production was backward. For garrison commanders and officials, naturally, the fewer people sharing the produce from the land, the better. So they didn't care about filling the vacancies of soldiers.

In this way, weight was added to Feng Zongze's determination to take Jeju as soon as possible.

Having said that, the troops on hand were stretched thin. With a total landing population of only over a thousand, stationing them in three places would inevitably disperse the forces too much: Of course, based on intelligence provided by the Great Library and Foreign Intelligence Bureau and estimates made by the General Staff, neither the Joseon Dynasty nor the Ming Dynasty would launch an attack on the main island. So external threats could be said to be basically non-existent, but maintaining internal security on the island still required considerable military strength.

The government and army of the Joseon Dynasty had always been ineffective during every foreign invasion. Instead, the "Righteous Army" mobilized by middle and lower-class scholar-officials and commoners showed stronger combat effectiveness. Therefore, at the Jeju Island Special Task Force's Front Committee meeting, the three Senators unanimously agreed that military operations on Jeju Island should take "public security" as the primary goal.

Quickly seizing the ruling centers of the government on the main island and controlling the officials, scholar-officials, and landlords on the island—if any—should be able to play the role of eliminating the core of future resistance in the bud.

Secondly, quickly organizing a local "puppet army"—no, this title wasn't good. Feng Zongze thought this demeaned himself, actually acknowledging the legitimacy of Joseon's rule over the local area.

A more suitable title should be thought of. He considered it and thought, why not just call it "Public Security Army" (*Zhi'an-jun*). Originally, the Public Security Army was an irregular force composed of mercenaries. Since Japanese could be hired as the Public Security Army, hiring Koreans was the same thing.

Servant armies composed of locals played an important role in strengthening rule. After the Manchus entered the Shanhai Pass, they regarded forming the Green Standard Army as the primary task after occupying each place, "forming a battalion immediately upon occupying a place." If not for the Green Standard Army continuously serving as occupation troops and cannon fodder, the Eight Banners could never have completed the conquest of occupying all of China. Even in the 20th century, with high nationalist consciousness, the various puppet armies formed by the Japanese army played a certain role in strangling base areas and obstructing guerrilla actions.

As the highest administrative official sent by the Senate to Jeju Island, Feng Zongze received full authorization from the Senate and the Executive Committee: he had the right to form "local public security forces" that "do not use firearms."

Besides the "Public Security Army," there had to be "collaborators." Feng Zongze knew this wasn't hard—any society would have a large number of frustrated figures from all classes who harbored grudges against society and the government for various reasons. As long as they were given a chance and the possibility of regime change, this group of people would jump out themselves.

Feng Zongze had no doubt: once they took Jeju City and controlled the whole island, such people would appear immediately.

Since Jeju Island was an island concentrated with official slaves and exiles, the number of dissatisfied elements must be more than the entire Eight Provinces of Joseon combined. Finding "collaborators" among them should be excessively easy. Not to mention the oppressed potential "proletarian collaborators."

Feng Zongze and other Senators also pinned another hope: that was to utilize the Chinese exiles on the island: including Han people and Mongols. According to background materials provided by the Great Library: starting from the Yuan Dynasty, prisoners were exiled to Tamna Island—that is, Jeju Island. Although Tamna had been annexed by Goryeo since the Goryeo Dynasty, it was actually under Mongol control during the Yuan Dynasty. Besides exiling prisoners to the island, the Yuan Dynasty also transported pastoral slaves to the island to raise horses—Jeju Island becoming an important horse breeding ground was actually caused by the Mongols, and the horse breeds on the island also came from Mongol horses imported by the Mongols.

The power of the Mongols on Jeju Island was so great that when the Yuan Dynasty was at a dead end, it once considered moving the court to Jeju Island and even prepared to build palaces on the island. After the Yuan Dynasty fell, the Joseon Dynasty spent great effort to subdue the Mongol pastoral slaves on the island and completely annex Jeju Island.

Although the Ming Dynasty did not occupy Jeju Island, many Mongol nobles of the Yuan Dynasty and Han bureaucrats loyal to the Yuan Dynasty were exiled to Jeju. The Yuan Dynasty Prince of Liang in Yunnan and many of his subordinates were exiled here by Zhu Yuanzhang. Many surnames like Won (Yuan), Yang (Liang), An, and Kang (Jiang) on the Korean Peninsula in the old timeline were their descendants.

These people were not Koreans; although they had spent hundreds of years on Jeju Island, there should still be differences from ordinary commoners on the island—differences could be utilized.

Feng Zongze was considering the work after occupying Jeju when his secretary suddenly came in from outside.

"Reporting to the Chief."

"What is it?"

"One of the Haenyeo is very sick." The secretary hesitated and said, "You instructed me to pay attention to the condition of the Haenyeo and report any situation immediately..."

The fishing village near Seongsan was already under their direct control. The fishermen who had fled hadn't returned yet, so the captured Haenyeo were still in the camp.

"Understood. You did right." Feng Zongze nodded, "Send a medic to take a look at them."

Healing the wounded and rescuing the dying was the easiest way to move people's hearts. Because Jeju Island was to be used as a refugee camp, the first fleet brought a large amount of medicine and disinfectant. Medics were also fully staffed. Giving locals a bit of medical grace was no problem.

He suddenly stopped the secretary who was about to leave:

"Wait, I'll go see her personally."

"Chief—" The secretary was surprised. She knew her master understood medicine, but she didn't expect a Senator would go to treat a lowly prisoner personally.

Feng Zongze stood up; he had made up his mind: since he wanted to buy hearts, he might as well do it thoroughly. Starting with these few prisoners around him.

Although the Haenyeo had humble status and certainly no influence, once the news that he personally treated them spread, it would receive good effects. To be a ruler, besides powerful military force, propagating "benevolence and righteousness" was also an effective means.

Haenyeo dived in the deep sea all year round, holding their breath for underwater work. High water pressure combined with hypoxia made them prone to chronic headaches, hardness of hearing, tinnitus, gastrointestinal diseases, neuralgia, arthritis, etc. In addition, due to strong winds and high humidity, coughing and asthma were also very common.

What the Haenyeo had was an abscess. For people on Jeju Island, this was the most common disease. Especially among Haenyeo, there were particularly many people with this disease; it seemed to become an occupational disease.

Every shrine on Jeju Island enshrined the Haenyeo Goddess and Dragon King God, a kind of god specifically protecting people from skin diseases. In the shrine enshrining the Haenyeo Goddess, there was a custom of offering sacrificial rice and placing a boiled egg on the rice. This was people's beautiful wish, hoping their skin could be as white and smooth as a peeled boiled egg.

The Haenyeo with the severe illness was exactly Pan. Feng Zongze didn't need a thermometer; just looking at her red face and cracked lips knew she was running a fever.

This indicated the inflammation was already quite serious. He put on gloves and pressed with his fingers: this was a typical abscess. It must be cured by surgical incision and drainage.
