# Chapter 1002 The Dutchman's Heart

Lingao was a beehive. This was many people's assessment of the place. Everyone who came here for the first time would feel the busy, tense, and lively atmosphere the moment they set foot on the harbor dock. When they ventured deeper, especially into the industrial and agricultural zones and residential areas along both banks of the Wenlan River, this impression deepened even further.

On the streets, busy crowds and vehicles flowed endlessly all day. "Meteor" locomotive heads pulled open carriages either piled high with goods or packed with people. Although safety regulations had been issued prohibiting "hanging on" situations, and police and National Army soldiers maintaining order had been added at stations, each train still had overloaded people hanging all around. To the point that every day people fell off the trains—fortunately, the Meteor's speed wasn't much faster than walking, keeping the casualty rate at a level the Planning Bureau could tolerate.

Around noon that day, the rumbling of cannon fire came from the direction of Bopu Wharf—this was the salute for foreign vessels entering port. This was rare in Lingao: apart from occasional Portuguese ships, only Chinese merchant ships came here. Now it was summer; even Chinese merchant ships rarely came.

Van de Lantron stood on the sterncastle, watching with interest the Australian sampan being tied with tow ropes. The 400-ton *Magdeburg* would be pulled into port by this small boat. Dutch "yachts" were quite clumsy, and steering mechanisms weren't developed yet at the time. Steering in fjord-like harbors was very difficult. Without riding the tide in and out of port, relying solely on the captain's piloting skills made it impossible to accurately sail into anchorage.

Every time the *Magdeburg* entered or exited port, it had to lower ship boats to tow the large vessel. However, in Australian ports, this work was handled by Australian boats, with fees included in pilotage costs.

The small boat the Australians used to tow vessels had a smokestack, spouting thick black smoke, with no oarsmen, yet was very powerful, easily pulling heavily laden large ships. Last time when the *Magdeburg* transported spices to Hong Kong, they had already witnessed their power.

The Dutch generally didn't sail to the Chinese mainland coast in summer—wind direction was unfavorable, and there was danger of encountering typhoons. But this time the *Magdeburg*'s risky voyage was not just for trade but carried an important mission.

Van de Lantron was visiting Bopu for the second time. According to urgent instructions from the Australians' Colonial Trade Department: the *Magdeburg* had brought large quantities of woolen cloth, cotton fabric, and sheepskin—most of the woolens were English-made. Given the intensity of commercial competition between the Dutch and English, purchasing woolens from a commercial rival was hard to understand—especially since Holland itself was also known for weaving quality woolens. But for the Dutch East India Company, company and major shareholders' interests were paramount. Since English woolens were cheap enough to give the East India Company sufficient profit, they wouldn't pass up the opportunity.

Needless to say, the English were merely commercial rivals—nominally still Holland's ally. In the future, the East India Company would unhesitatingly sell and transport food and weapons to the enemies of their warring homeland. Because profit had no motherland.

Half an hour later, the *Magdeburg* was moored at Berth No. 5. Van de Lantron greatly admired the Australians' port. Their ports all had wharves available, eliminating the need for small boats to ferry cargo and personnel. Cargo was crane-lifted off ships; personnel went directly up and down gangplanks, saving enormous time and manpower. In Lingao, Sanya, and Hong Kong, ship turnaround was calculated in hours and days rather than "weeks" and "months."

Van de Lantron soon met an old friend—Mr. Leibu Trini, stationed in Lingao as the Dutch East India Company's consul. The Italian had already completed all port formalities. Van de Lantron checked the customs declaration and various required documents one last time; after confirming no errors, he handed the documents to customs officials. The subsequent unloading, inspection, and taxation matters he wouldn't need to worry about—the Australians' customs and port services would handle everything.

"Mr. Trini, long time no see. You look well."

Trini had once harbored resentment about being stationed in Lingao as consul, though this position was somewhat higher than his former position in Batavia, with salary and income increased by several guilders. Moreover, the company allowed him to sell certain company goods in Lingao, including some spices popular among the Chinese: ambergris, myrrh, sandalwood, etc., from which he could obtain considerable income.

However, Trini understood very well that this lucrative post was given to him because he was a painter and cartographer—to spy in Lingao. And because he was an Italian, a Catholic of extremely suspect faith, keen on science and mysticism, even if the Australians beheaded him, the Dutch would neither feel sorry nor be implicated.

But his days in Lingao had already made Trini view his work here as third only to family and life—something no one else should interfere with.

"A day in Lingao surpasses a year of my travels in this world." Trini wrote in his letters to friends.

"It's very sanitary here, and life is colorful. Food supply isn't bad either," Trini said. "Just rarely any meat."

Van de Lantron's mouth curved into a mocking smile: "I thought you'd complain about not having enough olive oil?"

By European standards that judged food quality by amount of meat consumed, even into the first half of the 20th century, Italian meals remained very poor. Most Italian commoners could only be satisfied with simple bread slices plus a few drops of olive oil and maybe a bit of cheese.

Trini naturally understood the mockery in this wooden-shoe-wearer's words—he had experienced such things far too often. Even though Dutch meals were also known for being simple and crude, at least the Dutch ate far more meat than Italians.

"The Australians are also very interested in olive oil—perhaps before long they'll consider importing from Europe. Of course, the prerequisite is the company can invent a method for long-term preservation of oils..."

"It's said they really like oils and fats?"

"Yes, they purchase large quantities of dried coconut precisely for this purpose." Trini said.

As the two talked and left the customs house, the empty bell tower above caught Van de Lantron's attention. From his last visit to now, this bell tower had remained empty. He found it strange: why didn't the Australians ever fit this bell tower with a set of resonant bronze bells, letting it sit empty like this? He knew from Trini's letters that the Australians wanted to equip these vacant bell towers with an unprecedented timekeeping device but had been unable to realize it.

"Mr. Trini, your last sketchbook caused a sensation in Batavia. There's even someone who wants to collect your sketchbook at a high price—who'd have thought that since coming here, your artistic creation would be so inspired."

Trini sent one of his sketchbooks back to Batavia by ship every month—as long as ships were sailing. The sketchbooks weren't just artistic creation but also intelligence reports. Nothing was more accurate at conveying intelligence than direct visuals.

"Thank you for your concern. There are many new things here, beyond my past thinking and experience. This has greatly stimulated my inspiration." Trini smiled and took out a wooden cigarette case. "Including Australian enjoyments."

Van de Lantron took a cigar—he wasn't unfamiliar with cigars. Some Spaniards often smoked tobacco this way. Personally he still preferred pipes. But he didn't mind changing tastes occasionally.

"Australian friends hope I can help them purchase some works by famous Italian painters: Da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo..." He named over a dozen notable Renaissance-era painters in one breath, some already famous at the time, others less renowned. "Also Stradivari and Guarneri violins."

For Trini's friends and family in Italy to acquire these artworks was unimaginable—they didn't have such financial power. Only the East India Company, with wealth rivaling nations, had such capability.

"Their standards are truly high. Setting aside the others, Da Vinci's works I think will be very difficult. Most of his paintings are in the French King's hands. As for others, it depends on whether your Italian compatriots are willing to part with them." Van de Lantron said. "This time I brought two Guarneris and some instruments you specifically requested, plus the musicians you mentioned in your letter. I think the Australians may be Chinese, but prefer Western art."

"Hard to say. I can only understand a tiny bit of their artistic taste. They also really like some strange line drawings—very exaggerated, very stylized, very narrative..."

After the two discussed Australian art for a while, they reached the edge of the customs square.

"Sir, this time I'd like you to take a ride on this." The Italian pointed at a wooden-structured shed diagonally across from Bopu Customs. Beneath the shed was a brick platform elevated above ground level.

The platform was already packed with people, all seeming to be eagerly waiting for something.

"What are they waiting for..."

"Whoo... clack-clack, clack-clack, clack-clack..."

"Is this a new Australian transportation vehicle?" Since his rear was already seated in a moving carriage, Van de Lantron already knew they had been waiting for some kind of transportation.

"Yes, my dear sir. The Australians call this a train. It runs on two iron rails. The speed is like riding a fast horse. But you see, my sir, this train has 5 carriages, can seat over 200 people..."

Van de Lantron found it very interesting. But from his past understanding of this Italian, he could tell Trini wanted to say more than just this.
