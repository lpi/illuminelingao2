# Chapter 1150 - After the Storm

The month-long visit finally came to an end.

Huygens and the Bontekoe siblings were ready to leave.

On the pier, Zhong Lishi, Zhong Xiaoying, and Wei Bachi came to see them off.

"Thank you for your hospitality," Huygens said sincerely. "This has been an unforgettable journey. I have seen the future."

"We hope peace and friendship can persist," Wei Bachi said diplomatically.

Westerly held Dr. Zhong's hand tightly. "Dr. Zhong, I will study hard. I want to be a scientist like you."

"I believe you will," Zhong Lishi encouraged. "Remember, question everything, verify everything."

Cleadia and Zhong Xiaoying hugged each other, tears in their eyes.

"Don't forget to write," Cleadia choked out.

"I won't. Take care," Zhong Xiaoying said.

The Dutch ship slowly left the pier. The siblings waved from the deck until figures on shore became small dots.

"They are gone," Zhong Xiaoying said softly, feeling a sense of loss.

"There will be chances to meet again," Zhong Lishi comforted her. "The world is becoming smaller."

After sending off the guests, Wei Bachi immediately returned to his busy work.

"Mayor, the draft of the 'Kaohsiung Five-Year Plan' needs your review," the secretary reported.

"Coming." Wei Bachi adjusted his hat. Sentimental moments were over; reality called.

Xu Ke was also busy. Li Siya's appearance and the rumors alerted him. He launched a "cleaning operation" in the city to root out latent enemy agents.

"We must purify our rear," Xu Ke emphasized at the internal meeting. "Before the real war comes."

Deep in the Customs House, the huge clock continued to run precisely. *Tick-tock, tick-tock...* It recorded the passage of time, also witnessing the history being created here.

Life in Kaohsiung returned to its rhythm. Workers went to work, soldiers trained, refugees reclaimed land. The huge machine of the Committee rumbled on, crushing all obstacles in its path.

Zhong Lishi returned to his laboratory. He prepared to organize his notes from this period and write a report on "Science Education for European Youth." He felt that influencing the next generation of Europeans might be a long-term strategic investment.

"Father, I want to learn more languages," Zhong Xiaoying suddenly said while helping him organize papers. "Not just Mandarin, but also Dutch, Latin..."

Zhong Lishi looked at her surprised and pleased. "Why?"

"Because I want to understand their world better," Zhong Xiaoying's eyes shone with a new light. "Like you do."

Zhong Lishi smiled. He saw growth in his daughter. "Okay. I will teach you."

The sun set in the west, casting golden afterglow on the sea. The golden age of the Committee had just begun.
