# Chapter 864 - Finding a New Path

The second batch of technical support team heading for Jiangnan was formally assembled. The machinery factory manufactured 4 Albion-type printing presses and 2 lithographic presses, along with 1 small water wheel. Water wheels could be made to contemporary craftsman standards, but their efficiency was far inferior to the machinery factory's machine-built versions. Lingao-manufactured water wheels had better transmission and gearing systems that hand-made water wheels couldn't match.

All equipment was disassembled and packed into crates. Also shipped were assembly tools needed for installation, some easily damaged spare parts, and the lithographic printing supplies: stone plates, engraving pens, etching agents, and protective coatings. Originally, Mo Xiao'an had proposed establishing a paper mill in Hangzhou. Paper mills required simple equipment and uncomplicated processes. The Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou plain had abundant rice straw, and the mountain counties had bamboo and wood resources that could provide sufficient raw materials for papermaking.

Paper-making could not only supply the printing office but also be sold locally—Hangzhou at that time was already an important paper distribution center, and high-quality paper would have no shortage of customers. Paper-making was also not an excessively profitable industry, with few wealthy gentry involved. According to Zhao Yingong's observations, most paper workshops were small family handicraft operations, mostly distributed in the mountainous counties around Hangzhou such as Yuhang, Lin'an, and Liuxia. The paper produced was then transported to Hangzhou for sale by merchants. This group wouldn't pose a threat to Zhao Yingong's enterprises.

However, modern paper-making required large quantities of acids and alkalis. Lingao couldn't supply chemicals over such a distance, so Mo Xiao'an's proposal was temporarily shelved.

The Jiangnan inspection team consisted of four elders, including Zhou Dongtian. Upon hearing there was an opportunity to go to Jiangnan, many people were eager—this kind of low-risk business trip wasn't it a perfect opportunity to enjoy oneself in Jiangnan? The Ming Dynasty's Jiangnan was said to be a "dreamland." Many had heard of the Eight Beauties of Qinhuai; those who had read even a little classical literature also knew of the Yangzhou lean horses. Everyone was chomping at the bit. When Mei Lin heard about the Jiangnan inspection team, he immediately sought out Mei Wan, pleading tearfully to go along. His reasoning was actually solid—since Zhao Yingong was planning to build an estate, how could the construction company not get involved? If buildings were constructed according to local craftsman methods, it would definitely waste land area, building space, and construction materials.

"My back is good, my back is good," Mei Lin said. "If I go, I'll definitely turn Phoenix Villa into an impregnable fortress..."

Mei Wan, pestered beyond endurance, could only say: "I should warn you—this time we're definitely going to Hangzhou. Whether we'll go to Nanjing isn't certain."

Mei Lin's yearning for the Eight Beauties of Qinhuai was well known throughout the Elder Council—he hadn't even bought a life secretary because of those eight beauties. He was regarded as quite eccentric. His current enthusiasm for going to Jiangnan had obvious ulterior motives.

"No problem, no problem. Hangzhou is fine too. Suzhou and Hangzhou produce... um, good craftsmen... the Xiangshan artisans..."

"If you're that eager, go ahead." Mei Lin was one of his "generals," usually quite enthusiastic about work. He couldn't refuse to show some consideration. Besides, blocking someone over women was the kind of thing that bred resentment. Mei Wan thought the reason of helping build houses was reasonable enough and immediately agreed to try to get him recommended for the inspection team.

"One more thing—do you know how I can exchange my circulating certificates for silver?" Mei Lin asked seriously. "Or gold would work too."

"What for?" Mei Wan was puzzled. In theory, elders weren't supposed to hold precious metals; using silver or gold required approval. "Travel expenses will be allocated—you don't need to worry about that."

Mei Lin mumbled: "No, I was thinking if I might need ransom money... I don't know how much silver would be enough..."

Mei Wan was stunned: "Surely not—you're actually serious about this?!"

The last person heading to Hangzhou was a missionary currently preaching in Lingao—Father Trigault, or Father Jin Lige. This time he would go to Hangzhou to liaise with the local church. Trigault was very excited about this: in Europe, he had been intensely interested in this "heavenly city" described by Marco Polo. Now he actually had a chance to personally visit Hangzhou and meet the lambs of the holy church that Father Nicolas Trigault had originally established there.

The External Intelligence Bureau was going to the trouble of bringing him along to utilize Jesuit influence. Hangzhou's Catholic Church included a number of locally influential gentry—although two of the "Three Pillars," Yang Tingyun and Li Zhizao, had passed away in 1627 and 1630 respectively, both were Hangzhou natives: Yang Tingyun from Qiantang County, Li Zhizao from Renhe County. Many of their relatives and friends were Catholics, and the Jesuits had considerable power in Hangzhou. So much so that during the Nanjing Persecution, Shanghai and Hangzhou were the two safest locations for foreign missionaries.

Zhao Yingong was currently an outsider in Hangzhou, lacking sufficient influence and protection. The network the Jesuits had built locally could certainly be put to use. Furthermore, this connection could be used to establish ties with Xu Guangqi.

Xu Guangqi was closely connected to Sun Yuanhua, who would play an important role in the coming Dengzhou Rebellion. Both men were Catholics. Establishing this connection would be very beneficial for future operations.

"Wouldn't this require Zhao Yingong to become a Catholic? That doesn't seem quite appropriate. Also, getting too deeply involved with the Catholic Church wouldn't look good locally," He Ying said when reviewing the External Intelligence Bureau's application.

"Zhao Yingong doesn't need to become a Catholic, and he doesn't need to get deeply involved. He just needs to show friendliness toward the Church and a certain 'interest.' The Jesuits are pragmatic. They'll urge Hangzhou's Catholic gentry to serve as protectors—they understand very well that to make progress in China now, they mainly rely on our military power." Li Yan explained. "According to the Political Security General Administration's *Compilation of Jesuit Missionary and Macau Mail Inspections*, they now pin their greatest hopes for spreading Catholicism in China on us. They'll do their utmost to satisfy any request we make. As long as Zhao Yingong has Jesuit introductions, he can receive care from this group of Hangzhou Catholic gentry, which will be beneficial for his activities in Hangzhou."

"But Zhao Yingong is planning to claim to be a descendant of the Song imperial house..." He Ying's implication was that for a proper Song imperial descendant to get entangled with a foreign religion was quite improper and would have flaws in terms of "political correctness."

"Regarding this Song imperial house identity he's invented, I think having a few flaws is better for everyone," Li Yan said. "Besides, as I've said, he doesn't need to be baptized. He just needs the Jesuits to make introductions and establish a friendly relationship. In the long run, it's also inadvisable to let Zhao Yingong get too entangled with Hangzhou's church. My suggestion is: arrange for a naturalized Catholic to be among his staff, to serve as a channel for building relationships with Hangzhou's church."

"This person is reliable?"

"Of course—it's someone our Bureau has trained."

Father Trigault, completely unaware of the elders' schemes, went off excitedly to prepare his luggage. Of course, he had first received a warning from He Ying: he must not reveal that Zhao Yingong was going from Lingao. He could only follow the External Intelligence Bureau's standard script.

"You understand, our current situation on the mainland is very delicate. If an elder's identity were leaked, it would not only have adverse effects on our enterprise, but would also produce unpredictable and serious consequences for the missionary enterprise." He Ying said. "I hope you understand my meaning."

Father Trigault could completely grasp this diplomatic language—the Jesuits hadn't been so naive as to think the Australians were devout believers with intentions to serve as a "Catholic Elder Council." The cooperation between both sides was ultimately a mutually beneficial relationship. So he very clearly indicated that all his words and actions would follow the inspection team "leadership's" intentions.

Besides the Jesuit channel, they also needed to quickly build a reputation through the bookshop. So they had to make Zhao Yingong's library-bookshop sufficiently distinctive from ordinary ones—just as the Purple brand shops had rapidly risen in Guangzhou. Therefore, this shipment would also include various "Australian building materials" and luxury goods: cement, ceramic tiles, plumbing hardware, glass, and so on. Of course, some of this was for the Hangzhou Station's own use.

Although some elders questioned whether heavy use of Australian goods creating a strong "Australian" association might invite trouble, Li Yan believed it wasn't a major concern. The reputation of "Australian goods" was not only famous in Guangdong; even in Jiangnan and the capital, it was already well-known. Zhao Yingong's identity was that of a wealthy young master from Sanshui County, Guangdong—having lots of "Australian enjoyments" wasn't unusual at all; it was entirely reasonable.

Because this shipment included many goods and personnel, particularly some heavy cargo, overland travel would be too slow. The Jiangnan inspection team decided to take a Dabo Shipping oceangoing vessel.

"What if we encounter Zheng Zhilong?" This was a concern everyone shared. Zheng Zhilong now completely controlled the waters off Fujian, effectively strangling the maritime route north.

How to deal with Zheng Zhilong had always been a hotly debated topic between the Elder Council and the Navy. Not only was there demand for transporting goods to Jiangnan this time, but future involvement in the Dengzhou Rebellion and population trade with the Manchu Qing might all involve Zheng Zhilong's specific stance. Some believed they could temporarily pay passage fees in exchange for temporary peaceful transport. Others thought they could begin attacking Zheng Zhilong now and completely clear away this obstacle.

"Zheng Zhilong's main concern is monopolizing ocean-going trade, especially the routes to Japan and the Philippines. Historical records don't indicate he ever monopolized coastal shipping routes. Furthermore, with Zheng Zhilong's strength, he might not be able to effectively blockade the route anyway. The information we've gathered from merchants in Guangdong and elsewhere also indicates no evidence that Zheng Zhilong collected transit taxes on coastal routes. What we should actually worry about is scattered pirate attacks along the coastal route—Zheng Zhilong's maritime hegemony..."
