# Chapter 848 Return to Guangzhou

Wu De was very opposed to the Guangzhou Great World project in the Executive Committee. Besides him, Cheng Dong also opposed it. The reasons for both opposing were the same: the 1631 budget and material allocation plan had already been completed. Suddenly adding a large project meant all projects would have to be redone from scratch. Cheng Dong held a fierce opposing attitude toward this. 1631 was the first time the Fiscal Comptroller's Office had prepared a formal annual budget. The Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign in 1630 had caused economic turbulence—a series of problems including sharp decline in imports and exports and currency over-issuance. The Fiscal Comptroller's Office's fiscal measures for 1631 were "moderately tight."

"We may have multiple unexpected events requiring additional budget in 1631." Cheng Dong pointed out that in analysis reports submitted by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, Military General Administration, and Planning Bureau, it was believed that the Senate would likely face several major military operations in 1631. Highly likely ones included southwestern border military operations, war against Liu Xiang, and war against Zheng Zhilong. On Hainan Island proper, the northern Qiong pacification war had already entered its final stage; the next step was for the military to enter southern Qiong to begin military operations, and this expense was also quite considerable. The war funds currently in the budget were certainly insufficient.

"We haven't specifically planned for a deficit, but it's completely imaginable that this year's fiscal budget will certainly have a deficit." Cheng Dong warned, "This has a great impact on stabilizing the value of Circulation Coupons."

Currently, the inflation of Circulation Coupons was temporarily masked—the transmigrators' military victory had greatly expanded the ruled territory. Circulation Coupons were promoted at bayonet point to all counties of northern Qiong. The social wealth of northern Qiong counties absorbed the purchasing power inflated by Circulation Coupons, effectively supporting the stability of Circulation Coupons, preventing them from revealing any flaws. One must know that the tensest time was at the end of 1630, when two-thirds of Lingao's silver reserves were all transferred to Leizhou to purchase sugar goods. At that time, the Fiscal Comptroller's Office was in an extremely tense state.

Si Kaide strongly supported this project: "But once this project is launched, the returns are quite objective. Most importantly, we will break away from our current extreme dependence on Lingao industry—processing raw materials locally in Guangdong, hiring labor locally, selling locally."

"Since we originally intended to establish light industrial production enterprises in Hong Kong and Guangdong, using Guangdong's manpower and material resources in the vicinity, building a base for large-scale commodity sales can't be considered waste." Zhan Wuya also expressed approval from an industrial perspective.

"As for the financial and material resources needed for construction, I think we can figure something out from Guangzhou locally. Don't just take the full appropriation path." Li Mei once again brought out her shareholding approach.

She proposed that Guangzhou Great World absorb private capital like Great Wave Shipping. Li Mei proposed: State capital would occupy 51%, leaving 49% for stock募集. Specifically, one was to absorb funds directly from local gentry and large households in Guangzhou; two was to absorb private funds through the institutional investor of De Long Guangzhou Branch. Whether to issue stocks or corporate bonds could be discussed separately.

Before the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign, De Long Guangzhou Branch had absorbed large amounts of deposits through Purple Enterprises and itself. A large part of these deposits was used as trade working capital for the Guangzhou Station and to support the development of Leizhou sugar industry. In the several years of De Long's operation in Guangzhou, considerable credibility had been established. With the current capital situation, investing in Guangzhou Great World was completely doable.

As for the large amounts of materials needed for construction, they could be purchased nearby from Guangdong, including timber, bricks, tiles, and stones. One could even consider building a building materials factory in Guangzhou or Hong Kong, using Lingao's advanced technology to process and manufacture building materials, so even cement could be solved locally in Guangzhou.

Cement was originally an industrial enterprise requiring large amounts of raw materials. Lingao's cement industry relied on externally transported coal, which was not very advantageous from an economic standpoint. Although Guangzhou had no coal mines, at that time many small and medium coal pits were developed in Guangdong, so obtaining cheap coal nearby was not difficult. As for limestone, clay, and other materials, they were not difficult to obtain near the Pearl River Delta—much better than Lingao's cement factory, which often relied on burning oyster shells for lime.

Eventually this proposal was also passed in the Executive Committee. It was decided to add Guangzhou Great World project to the Planning Bureau's 1631 Material Production and Allocation Schedule and fiscal budget as an additional project. Of course, a considerable portion of funds needed to be self-raised by the project team.

"Master, we've arrived at Tianzi Wharf in Guangzhou." A respectful voice from an attendant came from outside the door.

Guo Yi nodded. The life secretary standing beside him—Yi Liu—responded loudly: "Master knows." His two maids had all undergone political vetting and "re-education" after returning to Lingao and were now on the Guangzhou Station's roster. Yi Liu was a secretary; Zhi Tao was a classified document clerk.

He stood up, and Yi Liu hurriedly lifted the silk mirror cover from a large mirror on the cabin wall to let him see his appearance. The man in the mirror was dignified and impressive; every gesture was full of the noble bearing of someone rich and powerful. This feeling made him dazed for a moment: *Is this still me?* Recalling his appearance when working in the Security Department back then, Guo Yi felt that was simply another person altogether.

"How is Mr. Lü?" He asked. Everyone else was fine—either Senators or naturalized citizens—but Lü Yizhong had to be kept a close eye on. Although this person had fully exposed his utterly spineless characteristics in the POW camp, and left a series of "stains" like writing peace-advocacy documents to the Viceroy, he could now only work wholeheartedly with the Senators. The Guangzhou Station planned to have him serve as the figure running communications with Guangdong officialdom. But the Senators weren't very confident about this person's reliability.

"Mr. Lü already changed clothes just now and is waiting in his cabin to go ashore. Nothing unusual."

"Mm." Guo Yi nodded.

Zhi Tao helped him smooth the wrinkles in his clothes. He stood majestically still, waiting for the women to make final touches. Then Yi Liu lifted the door curtain for him.

Guo Yi came onto the deck. The wind from the river made him shiver slightly. Looking out, a crowd had already gathered on Tianzi Wharf, with drums and music arrayed. Tianzi Wharf had been cleared in advance; irrelevant personnel and boats had all been driven to one side.

The moment he emerged from the cabin, drums and music immediately struck up grandly on the wharf. Firecrackers and high-rise fireworks crackled and popped. Guo Yi smiled, waving slightly towards the wharf, before descending the gangplank.

Among the crowd welcoming him on the wharf were quite a few local gentry. Guo Yi immediately spotted Liang Cunhou, face full of smiles; then he saw Gao Ju, whose plump face was full of joy at reuniting after a long separation; a group of young masters who frequently visited Purple Brightness Tower gathered together fanning themselves and chatting... But the one leading this group was Li Xijue. Although he hadn't put on any official pomp, everyone knew this person represented Guangdong Governor Li Fengjie to welcome "Master Guo."

As if fearing a single private secretary of the Guangdong Governor wasn't dignified enough, Guangzhou Prefecture, Nanhai County, and Panyu County had all sent yamen runners to maintain order on the scene. The pomp was almost on par with a departing high court official.

Three large blue-cloth four-bearer sedan chairs and more than a dozen two-bearer small sedan chairs were already lined up on the wharf. The large chairs were prepared for Guo Yi, Pei Lixiu, and Zheng Shangjie. The small chairs were prepared for their maids.

One of them was the luxurious sedan chair Guo Yi had originally used. After the Guangzhou Station withdrew, this sedan was taken by Tian Da, intending to bring it back to the capital as tribute to his master. After Tian Da was "seventy-yarded," the sedan was abandoned and became dilapidated. This time Li Xijue specially found it and sought skilled craftsmen to renovate it completely. Except that the glass on the sedan windows had been pried off and couldn't be replaced—substituted with strings of fine pearls made into bead curtains instead—everything else was restored.

Li Xijue approached with a smiling face to exchange greetings. Subsequently, all the gentry present to welcome him also came forward to exchange courtesies. Most of the gentry present were people who had commercial dealings with the Guangzhou Station or were regulars at Purple Brightness Tower—originally "pro-Hair" people. When the government launched the punitive expedition, they had suffered somewhat. Especially young masters like Dong Jizhong and Wu Zhixiang, who received quite a bit of scolding from their fathers and older brothers at home for associating too much with "Hair Bandits." Now they could finally hold their heads high, each one in high spirits.

Gao Ju was beaming, cupping his hands: "The clouds part and the sun appears! Has Master been well?"

"Many thanks to Lord Gao for your kind assistance!" Guo Yi knew that after the Guangzhou Station left, Gao Ju had protected and looked after the Guangzhou Station's interests in many ways. He was a tested and proven partner.

"You're too kind, too kind. With Master's return to Guangzhou this time, it's like a dragon escaping the shallows, ready to spread great soaring ambitions." Gao Ju's mouth was full of flattery. Only then did he say in an extremely low voice, "May I know when I might visit your residence?"

"I wouldn't dare. Just give me three days, and this humble one shall call to pay respects."

"Very well, very well." Gao Ju nodded smiling, stepping aside.

After the gentry exchanged courtesies, there was another flurry of chaos. Everyone boarded the sedan chairs. Luggage and goods would be transported to the Huifu Street residence by the Qiwei Escort Agency personnel accompanying the ship—according to Li Xijue's orders, the residence had already been unsealed and cleaned after being swept.

The procession of sedan chairs, led by "top horses" (mounted escorts), headed towards Huifu Street with crowds before and behind. The procession not only had yamen runners from Guangzhou Prefecture and Nanhai and Panyu, the two counties, clearing the way and maintaining order, but multiple yamens in the prefectural city also sent personnel to assist. This attracted citizens along the streets to come watch the excitement.

"That's Guo Yi!" Someone said, "Look at this scale and style—really grand!"

"Didn't they say Hair Bandits were rebels..."

"Shh! 'Rebel' is something you can say? He's properly Master Guo!"

"The government changes face faster than flipping a book..."

"That's called 'times change.' Besides, whether Hair Bandits or Master, it doesn't have much to do with us common folk. But now that he's back, all the Purple-brand stores can open, and there'll be a place to buy Australian goods again."

Sitting in his sedan, Guo Yi thought of the panic when the Guangzhou Station fled in disarray more than half a year ago. It felt like a different lifetime. Guangzhou—was still a world where he could accomplish great things.
