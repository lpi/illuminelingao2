# Chapter 799 – Outcome

"Thanks." Li Yongxun threw down a string of copper coins and quickly got up to follow. There were many goods on the pier, making it easy to conceal herself. Stopping and going, she slowly approached the trestle.

The sedan chair was carried all the way onto the trestle, stopping right next to the ship from Lingao. Li Yongxun hurriedly shrank behind a pile of goods, peeking cautiously.

She saw the gangplank lowered from the Lingao ship, guarded by several big men. Someone helped a master-like figure out of the sedan chair. He wore a "free-and-easy scarf" (scholar's cap) and a wide robe, with a rare pair of smoky quartz spectacles on his face. The master's movements were clumsy; he fumbled and relied on two people half-supporting him to barely get up the gangplank. Li Yongxun wondered secretly—why was this person acting so strangely? Maybe he was sick?

She watched them with interest. Suddenly, a thought surfaced—could this be Inspecting Censor Lord Gao?! Li Yongxun immediately tensed up: Right! Her brother-in-law had said the biggest beneficiaries of Censor Gao's disappearance were two parties: the Folangji and the bald bandits. It made sense for either party to kidnap Gao Shunqin.

She stared wide-eyed at the group. The more she looked, the stranger it seemed: the escorting servants surrounded the master tightly, seemingly intentionally blocking others' view. Their behavior was extremely suspicious.

Li Yongxun instantly became excited—although apart from their behavior, there was no noteworthy reason to prove they were taking Censor Gao. However, she was immediately bewildered by the thought of gaining merit, and the more she looked, the more she felt this person was Lord Gao.

Lord Gao was indeed kidnapped by the bald bandits! Now they were about to take him to Lingao. Thinking of this, her heart pounded—just getting this news was a huge merit! She had to go back and report to her brother-in-law quickly!

Visions of being rewarded for her merit already floated in Li Yongxun's mind. Her brother-in-law would definitely be pale with anger yet helpless. Not to mention her family—the Li family held hereditary posts in the Embroidered Uniform Guard, but when had they ever had such glorious merit? This great merit might even earn her a Zongqi or Xiaoqi position; she heard that in the early Ming years, there were women in the Embroidered Uniform Guard specializing in detection and arrest.

Before her splendid fantasy ended, she was struck heavily on the back of her head. Without even a groan, she flopped to the ground.

The *Dengyingzhou* was a 200-ton three-masted Guangdong ship, the second vessel to bear this name. The first *Dengyingzhou*, a converted fishing boat, had too small a tonnage and limited cargo capacity. After removing modern equipment like the installed diesel engine, it was reconverted to a fishing boat, re-registered in the Ling-Yu sequence, and assigned back to the Fishery Corps.

The new *Dengyingzhou* used to be a pirate ship under Zhu Cailao. After defecting to Lingao, it was repaired and modified specifically for cargo missions on the Lingao-Macau route. Because it was fully armed, it also served as an escort.

In a secret cabin below deck, someone said, "It's a woman!"

"Do you need to say that?" another person by the bunk said. "Just look at her butt—do men have butts this big?"

Li Yongxun lay on a fixed bunk in the cabin, hands and feet shackled to the bed frame. After taking a rubber baton hit and being quietly brought onto the *Dengyingzhou*, she was given a sedative to prevent her from making noise upon waking. Several men surrounded her with interest while a young girl searched her body carefully, occasionally placing found items into a cardboard box beside her.

Li Yongxun didn't have much on her: a handkerchief, a little loose silver, a compact mirror... most notable were the small embroidered spring sword and a dagger she carried.

Li Yan pulled out the sword, looked at it, and checked the scabbard: apart from the characters "Li" and "Qian," there were no other markings, especially no unit or serial number—this wasn't an official issue sword.

"This woman is probably named Li Qian," he said.

"Why was she tailing us, carrying a sword like this?"

"Because she's this." Jiang Shan, who had been watching Political Security Bureau officer Ke Yun search the body, frowned and took a wooden tablet still warm from body heat out of the box. "This is an Embroidered Uniform Guard badge."

"Embroidered Uniform Guard?!" someone muttered. "Does the Great Ming have women in the Embroidered Uniform Guard?"

"Hard to say." Jiang Shan turned it over and over. "The badge says 'Guard' of the Foshan Battalion..."

"Just ask when she wakes up."

"The Embroidered Uniform Guard is really efficient, tracking us to Macau right away. Our smoke screen didn't work."

"This woman seems to be one of the two Embroidered Uniform Guards who came to Huang Shunlong's house yesterday." Jiang Shan rubbed his chin noncommittally. Pity he didn't have the files at hand; he'd have to return to Lingao to check for relevant data. Huang Shunlong's attitude toward the transmigrators had become positive in the last six months. He had begun providing intelligence he was previously unwilling to share.

However, Li Yongxun's identity was clarified without returning to Lingao. Huang Tianyu was also on this ship back to Lingao. Hearing a female Embroidered Uniform Guard was caught, he immediately ran over to see the fun.

"Isn't this the runaway girl from the Embroidered Uniform Guard!" Huang Tianyu immediately recognized the girl who had drugged him—this chick had cost him a bottle of ketchup and a bottle of chili sauce for nothing.

"You know her?" Jiang Shan asked curiously.

"Of course. This chick is full of tricks." Huang Tianyu then recounted meeting Li Yongxun halfway while going to Foshan with Liu San and the others.

"Liu San and I even wrote a detailed report after returning."

"I must read it when I get back," Jiang Shan said, then instructed Ke Yun, "Watch her!"

"Yes, Chief!"

Jiang Shan returned to the conference room in the poop deck with the others. He said:

"Although this chick isn't an Embroidered Uniform Guard, she's closely related to them. Since her brother-in-law is a genuine Trial Centurion of the Foshan Battalion and is now in Macau, it means the Embroidered Uniform Guard has definitely sniffed something."

"So transferring Old Gao in time was the right move," said Jiang Qiuyan, the only psychiatrist from the Ministry of Health accompanying them. "The Great Ming still has law enforcement power in Macau—though the reaction is much slower." His task was to participate in the interrogation as a psychoanalyst.

Originally, the Executive Committee intended to eliminate Gao Shunqin on the spot, but the intelligence department believed that as an important official who had served in both central and local governments, Gao Shunqin had a clear understanding of high-level operations of the regime and knew much about officialdom and current affairs—this was completely different from the level of Wu Mingjin and others they currently controlled. He could serve as a useful intelligence source to enrich the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's database. Furthermore, the mainland strategy had just begun; there was no urgent need to physically eliminate officials. Therefore, with Executive Committee approval, Gao Shunqin was moved to Lingao.

Li Yan asked, "What do we do with this chick?"

"Throw her directly into the sea, clean and neat."

"No, this chick is of no use to us, but we should interrogate her to clarify things first," Jiang Shan said. "Besides, what Lingao lacks now is women. Don't waste resources."

"Need to supplement nutrition," Huang Tianyu blurted out nonsensically. Several men laughed maliciously: Li Yongxun wasn't bad-looking and had unbound feet. It was just that her figure and face were both lolita-like.

Li Yongxun's bizarre disappearance put a confusing full stop to the entire Gao Shunqin case. After two days of fruitless running around, Lin Ming had to seek help from the Xiangshan Assistant Magistrate—he had to lie that he found clues of Gao Shunqin in Macau—the Assistant Magistrate wouldn't negotiate with the Folangji to find his sister-in-law.

Hearing Censor Gao's whereabouts were found, the Xiangshan Assistant Magistrate and Xiangshan Magistrate dared not delay, arriving in Macau successively to negotiate with the Folangji. The Macau Senate dared not disobey the Great Ming government's demands and immediately ordered a city-wide search.

But neither Gao Shunqin nor Li Yongxun could be found. Only from the tea stall mistress on the pier did Lin Ming learn that Li Yongxun had appeared there and asked about Lingao people. And she left the stall after seeing a group of Australians pass by. This greatly increased suspicion of the bald bandits. At his request, the Portuguese searched the Lingao warehouse in Fifth Lane and arrested several people—immediate interrogation revealed they were all Macau locals hired to guard the goods.

Just as he wanted to further investigate Australian properties and visiting ships in Macau, a message came from Guangzhou: Li Fengjie wanted him not to harass the Australians too much—he feared provoking another incident like shelling the Bogue forts or burning the Wuyang Relay Station. With this message, the wind changed: the Xiangshan Assistant Magistrate stated that without evidence Gao Shunqin had been to Macau, continuing the search was inappropriate. The Portuguese also gradually ceased cooperation.

Lin Ming had taken bribes and was isolated in Macau. He had never thought Gao Shunqin was in Macau and found no clues in days. Continuing to search for Li Yongxun under the pretext of searching for Censor Gao became unsustainable.

Lin Ming's face was iron-blue: his sister-in-law had most likely fallen into the hands of the bald bandits—though he didn't know why they took her. She might have already been sent to Lingao. The matter became very tricky. Leaving aside that Lingao was now the bald bandits' territory, even in the past, Qiongzhou was a miasmic land officials avoided.

After all, she was his relative. When Qianqian's family came to take her back unsuccessfully, he had patted his chest guaranteeing her safety in Guangdong. Now she was abducted by bald bandits—and their reputation for lechery was no joke! If something happened, he would have a hard time facing his wife.

"Dammit, you bunch of street-dropping bald bandits!" Lin Ming gritted his teeth. "I will definitely wipe you out!"
