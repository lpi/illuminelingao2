# Chapter 212 - The Church

Xiao Zishan felt he had been handed a hot potato. He was thinking about how to set up this school. Since no one was interested in becoming a children's teacher, the principal position would temporarily be held by him. Of course, he would need to find an executive vice principal, somebody he would have to search for slowly. But one thing was confirmed at the meeting: transmigrators with "dependent personnel" could receive a dependency allowance as a subsidy—a demonstration of humane policy.

The meeting also discussed cooperation with the Church. Church cooperation was quite thorny: beyond using it to acquire European personnel, technology, and materials, the transmigrators also hoped to use a new religion to create spiritual sustenance and moral principles for future citizens. But they didn't want the Church to hold too much influence or authority in social life—let alone authority originating from abroad.

"The Jesuits are determined to spread Catholicism into China. Rather than let them do the preaching, we should do it ourselves," Wen Desi said.

"We do the preaching?"

"Yes, rather than passively blocking and defending, we should channel the flow." Wen Desi explained his "we take the lead" approach to missionary work. "We take the lead" meant: the Church, I'll allow you to establish one; faith, I'll let you spread it—but control of the local church must rest with us. The Church could only exist as an appendage and tool of the transmigrator regime.

"Will the Jesuits agree to such conditions?" Ma Qianzhu had no love for the Jesuits either.

"They will," Yu Eshui said with great confidence. "The Jesuits have always been famous in Church history for being adept at 'roundabout salvation.' They're far more flexible than those fanatics who only know how to make human barbecue."

"I have no objection to that. But how exactly do we 'take the lead'?"

Wen Desi chuckled: "Do you know what's called a fait accompli—"

Bai Duoluo had just gotten off work at the printing plant when he was summoned to Wen Desi's office.

"Little Bai, are you willing to contribute your strength to the organization?" Wen Desi said solemnly from behind his desk.

Bai Duoluo's scalp tingled and his legs trembled. According to Chinese experience, when a leader asked you this kind of question, nothing good ever came of it.

"Might I ask what this is about—" Bai Duoluo asked cautiously.

"Well, it's a good thing. After discussion, the Executive Committee has decided to have you serve as the head of the Linggao Catholic Church—say, um, bishop."

"What?!" Bai Duoluo nearly jumped. He was just an ordinary lay believer, not even a monk, and they wanted him to be a bishop! This was absurd.

"Father Lu Ruohua of the Jesuits has arrived in Linggao. The Executive Committee is about to begin negotiations with him regarding Church affairs." Wen Desi glanced at the door. The Internal Affairs personnel standing guard outside immediately closed it, and the room suddenly darkened.

"Reaching a missionary agreement is probably unavoidable—" Wen Desi said. "Even if we refuse, they'll send priests to infiltrate and establish an underground church. You know about underground churches—"

Bai Duoluo's scalp tingled—of course he knew what underground churches were. He nodded.

"The Jesuits already have a foothold in Ding'an County on Hainan at the very least. The Wang Honghui family's influence shouldn't be underestimated. Wang himself is a jinshi degree-holder and Minister of Rites, with connections to Matteo Ricci in Beijing. His son Paul is very enthusiastic about missionary work. If we aren't proactive, the Jesuits will focus their efforts primarily on Ding'an. Once they've established themselves there, after we unify Hainan, we'll face a Hainan church system that answers to the Macau Jesuits." Wen Desi polished his glasses. "This cannot be allowed to happen."

"True."

"So our thinking is this: establish our own church with a transmigrator as its head. That way, the Macau Jesuits would only have a cooperative relationship with us. No matter who comes, they'd just be guest advisers. With you as the Bishop of Linggao, the Jesuits would have no way to seize ecclesiastical authority. Understand?"

Bai Duoluo understood what Wen Desi meant. He said: "Bishops require consecration by the Holy See. If we establish a so-called Linggao Catholic Church here without Papal consecration, it would be self-consecration—the Jesuits and the Holy See alike won't recognize it."

As a Catholic, Bai Duoluo naturally knew that the Church had always been very particular about the authority to ordain bishops.

"But our Australian Church is a 'lost church,'" Wen Desi had already thought this through. "A lost church expressing loyalty to the Holy See—the Curia would be so overjoyed they wouldn't quibble over consecration. Nine times out of ten they'll retroactively recognize the result. So we'll arrange for you to serve as bishop of the Australian Church, currently presiding over Linggao's ecclesiastical affairs. The Jesuits will probably agree to these conditions for the sake of a missionary breakthrough."

Wen Desi was quite confident in this reasoning: What era was this? An era when Catholic power had been steadily declining since the Reformation. Catholic Spain had been defeated twice by Protestant England and was now a spent force. Protestant England and the Netherlands were on the rise. Germany was struggling in the blood-soaked Thirty Years' War. The Catholic Church faced attacks and challenges everywhere. The appearance of an Australian Catholic Church right now would be an excellent stimulant for the Church. Wen Desi didn't think Lu Ruohua, the Jesuits, and the Holy See couldn't see through the Executive Committee's intentions, but the benefits the transmigrators were offering in exchange were enough to tempt them.

Bai Duoluo himself was a Catholic with sufficient knowledge of religious texts and Church affairs. He was the perfect candidate for the position of "Bishop of Linggao" of this fictitious Australian Church.

---

To Wen Desi's surprise, after some consideration, Bai Duoluo still refused:

"Director Wen, I don't think I can do this."

"Why not?"

Bai Duoluo steeled himself and said: "Director Wen, becoming a bishop requires taking vows—once you vow, you must keep a vow of chastity for life. I still want to get married."

Wen Desi thought this was indeed troublesome. Being a bishop wasn't a one- or two-day affair, and the man hadn't crossed through time to become a Western monk.

"No problem, you can return to lay life later."

"No, that won't work." Bai Duoluo shook his head repeatedly. "If I become the Bishop of Linggao, according to your estimate, Director Wen, the Holy See will probably consecrate me. At that point my religious faith won't allow me to return to lay life—but I don't want to be a monk."

It seemed religious faith really was stubborn. Wen Desi cursed inwardly. He continued trying to persuade him:

"We could reform the Church system, allow clergy to marry, that sort of thing."

Bai Duoluo stubbornly shook his head: "You could call that the Chinese Catholic Church or some other Chinese Jesus Church, but it wouldn't be Catholicism anymore. Though my faith isn't very strong, I'm not willing to take false vows."

It seemed this Catholic was of no use after all. This disappointed Wen Desi. Seeing his expression darken, Bai Duoluo knew things were going badly and quickly added: "But I'm willing to assist the Executive Committee with all Church work, as long as you don't make me impersonate a clergyman or become a monk."

Wen Desi had no choice, seeing his firm attitude. However, if Bai Duoluo was willing to cooperate within limits, the matter was still workable. Compared to Bai Duoluo, Miss Mendoza was even less reliable.

Since Bai Duoluo wouldn't do it, finding a fake bishop on short notice would be very difficult. Actually, having Bai Duoluo impersonate a bishop would have been a stretch anyway—he was no theologian, and most people here had never even read the Bible.

"Then you'll serve as a priest. It seems that doesn't require vows."

"Alright." Bai Duoluo yielded.

"We'll also need a church—" Wen Desi mused, hand on his chin. But then again, this church should appropriately be funded by the Macau Jesuits. Wen Desi had another idea and immediately called Dingding.

After hanging up, he considered the question of staffing. Bai Duoluo's attitude made one thing clear—this person wasn't reliable on religious matters. So more reliable people would have to be assigned to work with him—preferably French speakers. They would also need to prepare a few locals as an audience, to make Lu Ruohua feel the atmosphere was favorable.

Lu Ruohua was taken to the quarantine camp at Linggao Corner the moment he disembarked. The camp now had people every day—the Guangzhou station sent about 100 children and adolescents from Guangzhou almost every week. These individuals were "purified" here while waiting out the quarantine period and learning some basic cultural skills. Lu Ruohua received the full "purification" treatment—stripped naked, head shaved, hosed down with cold water and scrubbed with brushes. He endured all this with the profound patience of a martyr—until he was forcibly held down and had his buttocks spread open for inspection. Only then did he feel panicked. He thought these pagans were going to commit the wicked sin of Sodom upon him. But they just looked and that was it. Someone later said this examination was for his health. Lu Ruohua had also studied medicine—this behavior seemed to be checking for hemorrhoids. But he didn't understand: hemorrhoids weren't contagious. Why were the Australians so concerned about this? Did they have severe hemorrhoids?

The quarantine camp staff treated him quite courteously. They arranged a private room for him with a bed furnished with clean grass mats and felt padding. His luggage and clothes were delivered—the clothes had obviously been washed.

Lu Ruohua was told he could do whatever he wanted in his room, but wasn't permitted to leave except to use the toilet. A guard was specially posted at his door. Three meals a day consisted of rice porridge with fish and meat. Apart from the restriction on movement, everything was rather pleasant.

This captive life wasn't lonely. Every day, a refined person came to chat with him in the language of his homeland: French.

Lu Ruohua noticed the transmigrators had a very clear concept of France, unlike other Chinese who considered themselves well-informed about the world if they knew there was a "Europe." This slightly surprised the missionary—because in France and indeed all of Europe, no one had heard of any place called "Australia." Yet Australia knew about France.

What surprised him even more was that this was the first local person he'd met since coming to the East who thoroughly understood French history—not just ancient history, but even Cardinal Richelieu and his siege of the La Rochelle fortress beginning in 1627 were known in detail. The news had taken nearly a month to reach Vienna! Yet someone in the distant East, ten thousand miles away, knew about it.
