# Chapter 309 - Sweet Port Crisis: Sugar Industry Guild

"We're missing someone who can speak up and has some influence to take the lead," Wen Tong summarized.

Zhu An had prestige and was the leader of the Haiyi Guild. If he could be persuaded to cooperate, the effort would be halved.

"However, if this storm doesn't end with a human head, it can't be considered a conclusion," Chen Tianxiong said. Ambiguous victories carried great danger.

"Besides, even if he cooperates, there will be the future trouble of him fighting for leadership in the joint-stock company."

A man who had held power for so long, even if he submitted temporarily, would never be content. Any disturbance would spark dissent, causing endless trouble.

Feng Guangfeng was a decent man but looked down upon due to his status, so his influence was limited. They didn't know the others in the sugar guild well.

"I think we don't need to dig around for someone," Chang Shide thought for a while. "Since they sent Feng Guangfeng as a liaison, it shows they trust him. Let's just befriend him and use him as an agent. He doesn't need to issue a rallying cry, just convey our meaning accurately."

They sent Liao Daxing to the Dachang Rice Shop to contact Boss Zhu.

The next evening, Feng Guangfeng arrived as promised.

"Huanan will not change the acquisition price," Wen Tong said straight away. On the issue of conceding to the Haiyi Guild on price, everyone agreed not to budge, letting them know clearly who the overlord of Leizhou sugar was now.

Feng Guangfeng's face turned grim.

"Please, managers, reconsid—"

"Say no more," Wen Tong interrupted. "Ever since opening scales in Xuwen, Huanan has held at 2.5 taels. Huanan cannot destroy its own credit."

Merchants valued trust above all. Crushed by this principle, Feng Guangfeng had nothing to say.

"However, Huanan knows your difficulties," Wen Tong said. "You were incited by Zhu An and had a misunderstanding with my firm. My employer is magnanimous. As long as everyone makes a clean break with Zhu An, my employer will naturally take care of you!"

Feng Guangfeng knew the condition was set: they had to abandon Zhu An. But he still didn't see the benefit. Even if the colleagues agreed to raise the price to match Huanan's 2.5 taels, given the Haiyi Guild's ruined reputation, they wouldn't collect much—Huanan's name for benevolence had spread throughout Leizhou. Unless they paid even more, which the merchants were unwilling to do.

"My employer's intention is: Huanan can acquire sugar on behalf of the firms. The price remains 2.5 taels—farmers have it hard too; 'with the skin gone, to what can the hair attach'? Everyone needs a way to survive, right?"

The words were pretty. Feng Guangfeng could only repeatedly say "yes." He himself felt the Haiyi Guild's price suppression harmed farmers too much and wasn't kind.

"Each firm just hands over the silver. Huanan will collect as much sugar as there is silver. Huanan won't take a cut; consider it free service."

Feng Guangfeng's mind worked fast. This was a method. But would Huanan really serve for free? He turned his thought and immediately said:

"Then the 2% discount per *shi* of sugar shall be offered by the colleagues as Huanan's labor fee!"

This was a very graceful gesture. With over a hundred thousand *shi* of sugar, the 2% discount was a huge profit.

"That is for later—" Wen Tong nodded. "However, this proxy acquisition has a condition."

The condition was that firms must buy sugar goods from Huanan with cash; no credit.

"That is easy," Feng Guangfeng nodded repeatedly. "Acquisitions are usually done in cash anyway."

"Good." Wen Tong said: After payment, Huanan would issue warehouse warrants to each firm recording the amount of sugar calculated at 2.5 taels per *shi*.

However, after payment, the sugar firms could not withdraw the goods themselves. All sugar would be transported and sold out of Leizhou by Huanan. After the sale, accounts would be settled according to the figures on the warrants.

"The current market price in Guangzhou is 3.8 taels per *shi*. It may rise or fall," Wen Tong said. "Regardless of fluctuation, Huanan will settle accounts with each firm based on this rate. Whatever the warrant says, that's the silver you get." He added.

Feng Guangfeng was shocked. This was clearly Huanan wanting to monopolize the sales rights of Leizhou sugar. The Haiyi Guild had never touched this area. Huanan was indeed ambitious.

But he couldn't say "no." Not that he didn't want to, but he dared not. Since the other party opened their mouth so wide, they clearly had nothing to fear. Thinking of the rumored eleven heads, Feng Guangfeng felt a chill on the back of his neck.

However, thinking deeper, the firms wouldn't lose out: selling in Guangzhou themselves yielded similar margins. Though the market might rise, it might also fall—uncertainty. transporting it themselves meant bearing freight and travel costs, which weren't small. Encountering storms or pirates meant heavy losses or total ruin.

Especially for small firms, this condition was even favorable. Small firms lacked the capacity to transport and sell themselves; they consigned through big firms. Not only did they pay commissions, but they also suffered losses during transport—either big firms pushed wastage onto small firms or invented various fees.

If they could close the deal locally in Leizhou at 3.8 taels, everyone would likely accept it gladly.

In contrast, Huanan's risk was much greater. Even if the Guangzhou price held, Huanan had to cover freight and expenses. If it dropped, they would lose big.

Since they offered such terms, they obviously predicted a sugar price surge. But price fluctuations depended greatly on "Foreign Factory" demand, which was hard to predict.

Feng Guangfeng thought for a moment before saying cautiously, "Doing this naturally benefits the colleagues greatly, but sugar prices fluctuate wildly. If the market is unfavorable, your employer will suffer great loss. How can we allow this?"

"You don't need to worry about that." Wen Tong began to flatter him. "Among the twenty-one firms of the Haiyi Guild, it is rare to find someone as reasonable as Boss Feng: caring for self and others!"

"I dare not, I dare not." Though he knew it was flattery, Feng Guangfeng, usually looked down upon in the guild, was happy to be appreciated. "Manager Wen praises me too much."

"When Zhu An wanted everyone to suppress prices, only Boss Feng spoke up for the farmers. This was not easy." Seeing it worked, Wen Tong continued the flattery as planned. "'With the skin gone, to what can the hair attach'? The people of the Haiyi Guild lacked even this insight; truly a waste of Boss Feng's good intentions."

Hearing this, Feng Guangfeng felt emotional. He had repeatedly suggested in the guild not to harm farmers while fighting Huanan—it was detrimental to Leizhou sugar in the long run. He had suffered cold looks and insults for these words. Unexpectedly, Huanan appreciated his views so much. Mixed feelings left him speechless. He felt he had found a kindred spirit.

"Huanan does this for a reason too." Seeing his expression change, Wen Tong knew the speech had worked. He said earnestly:

"My employer's intention is simply this: since the sea ban was lifted, more ships are trading overseas. Besides goods being shipped out, foreigners are coming to trade. Some maritime merchants, to make a quick buck, deliberately cut prices. If one lowers the price, it's hard for others to raise it. Foreigners are shrewd; seeing this, if you ask a high price, they find someone else—there's always someone willing to sell. Killing our own, bloodying each other—is it not a pity?"

Feng Guangfeng had been to Guangzhou. Though he hadn't done "Foreign Factory" trade directly, he knew Wen Tong spoke the truth.

"So, Huanan wants to unite the Leizhou sugar colleagues to advance and retreat together." Wen Tong said. "That is the original intention."

Feng Guangfeng nodded. "If we advance and retreat together, we should share profits and losses. With the current method, Huanan's risk is too high."

"True. But Huanan is new to this precious land and unfortunately had a conflict with the colleagues. Although it was Zhu An's doing, grudges remain and need slow dissolving. If hearts aren't united, even good intentions can be misunderstood. So this time, Huanan takes on more risk."

"Rare indeed for Manager Wen to be so candid!" Feng Guangfeng's impression of Huanan improved greatly. "I will do my best to persuade the Haiyi Guild. But—" He asked carefully, "Do firms only need to hand over acquisition funds? Are there other costs?"

"None, except the 2% discount fee." Wen Tong said. "I know this benefit belongs to the sugar firms. But Huanan hasn't collected it for months, so we ask the firms to concede."

"I can make the decision on this." Feng Guangfeng nodded. "But Huanan monopolizing all sales will involve many people and surely face some twists."

Wen Tong proposed inviting the heads of all firms to a meeting to discuss the charter and answer doubts on the spot. Feng Guangfeng thought it good but worried about incomplete attendance—some were timid, and Huanan's "prestige" was intimidating.

"It doesn't matter. The meeting won't be at Huanan Sugar," Wen Tong had planned it. "Two days later, how about 'drinking flower wine' at Sister Ai's place?"

"Good!" Feng Guangfeng agreed enthusiastically. This "private brothel" was connected to the county yamen; no one dared cause trouble there. It was like the yamen guaranteeing everyone's safety. He admired Huanan's thoughtfulness. Compared to the Haiyi Guild members—either pedantic traditionalists, ignorant hedonists, or frogs in a well—even Master Zhu couldn't escape greed. The difference was like clouds and mud. He sighed and took his leave.

For the next two days, Feng Guangfeng ran around persuading hesitant colleagues to attend. Not everyone accepted; the timid refused, saying, "You go discuss; I'll follow whatever is decided."

A few others, formerly close to Master Zhu, felt it inappropriate to defect publicly and declined politely.

None refused openly.

Of the twenty firms invited, eighteen responded—Riyicheng had no place in the future Leizhou sugar blueprint. These firms were the first shareholders of the future Leizhou Sugar Industry Co., Ltd.

The de facto first general meeting of shareholders took place three nights later in Sister Ai's flower hall. Huanan spent lavishly, booking the whole courtyard and all the girls.

After feasting and drinking, Chang Shide spoke, explaining all the benefits of Huanan's proposal. They could enjoy high profits without risk, only advancing silver to Huanan.

Of course, handing over hard cash needed guarantees. Chang Shide proposed that the participating firms organize a "Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild," register with the county yamen's "Revenue Office," and write Huanan's conditions into a contract. Each paying family would get a copy as evidence.

"Does this mean however much silver I pay, Huanan gives me that many *shi* of sugar in warrants?"

"Huanan is acting as an agent." Chang Shide explained. Theoretically, silver exchanged for sugar, but with half the season gone, it depended on how much the farmers had left.

According to estimates, farmers held about 130-140 thousand *shi*. The Transmigration Group couldn't buy it all—besides Guangzhou Station's funds, they relied on spot sales to recycle cash. Only a two-pronged approach satisfied the acquisition cash flow.

To monopolize Leizhou sugar sales, local capital had to be mobilized. This was the main reason for rushing to form the guild and offering agent services.

The attendees were unaware of the transmigrators' calculations—Huanan's performance in crises gave these merchants an illusion of omnipotence.

"Fine. I'll pay fifty thousand taels first. I want warrants for twenty thousand *shi* tomorrow!" The speaker was Liu Yulin, owner of Risheng Firm, a big player.

"Agreed." Chang Shide nodded. He turned to Liao Daxing: "Record it. Risheng Firm, twenty thousand *shi*."

Liu Yulin's stance surprised the merchants. Although twenty thousand was half his usual volume, handing fifty thousand taels to Huanan showed great boldness. The crowd buzzed with discussion.
