# Chapter 331 - Traditional Chinese Medicine

Liu San met Dong Weiwei and handed the medicine to her. What he made were the simplest medicaments: ready-made prescriptions, created using herbs that could be collected and processed locally. To facilitate use, they were all made into powders and pills.

"These are the simple herbal medicines I made." Liu San handed many paper packets and wooden boxes from his basket to Dong Weiwei. "You know a little TCM, right?"

"A tiny bit." Dong Weiwei was a bit embarrassed. "Actually, I only learned a little acupuncture, cupping, and *Tui Na* massage. Because I needed it for bodybuilding."

"Can you feel the pulse?"

"Only a little."

Liu San said: "In that case, you'd better read this *Barefoot Doctor's Manual* first. It has diagnostic and treatment methods for many simple diseases. Looking, listening, questioning, and feeling the pulse—one doesn't necessarily have to rely on feeling the pulse to make a decision—common diseases are still more frequent in rural areas. This is *Diagnosis and Treatment of Common Diseases in Hainan* compiled by Minister Shi; you should study it too."

"Good, mastering some medical skills is too useful for carrying out work."

"This is the medical alcohol, absorbent cotton, and cotton swabs you applied for..." Liu San took out a list, "These are the lists of medicines I compounded and the applicable symptoms." He said, "Here are pest elimination and prevention drugs, diaphoretics, dampness-dispelling drugs, purgatives, fire-clearing drugs, sedatives... But the Chinese herbal medicines here are really incomplete; some can't be compounded. For some prescriptions where the herbs are easy to find, I just gave you the prescription."

Liu San finally took out a small wooden box: "This is a gift from the Ministry of Health to you—a medical kit." He winked, "There are also some trial products inside."

Dong Weiwei opened it curiously. Besides common items, there were also self-made gauze masks that looked quite rough—this was a new product. inside there was also a box containing a set of brand-new simple surgical instruments.

"This stuff is too crucial. Isn't it a waste to give it to a layman like me..." Dong Weiwei naturally knew surgical instruments were valuable.

"It doesn't matter; this is Lingao-made!" Liu San was satisfied seeing her reaction. "Take it out and look carefully."

"Is this copper?" Dong Weiwei asked in surprise.

"Correct, it's bronze," Liu San said. "To be honest, I didn't expect the pharmaceutical equipment factory could make this stuff. I heard it was made by Jiang Ye from the machinery factory together with several jewelers recruited from Guangzhou."

"That's too strong!" Dong Weiwei's eyes lit up. Looking at the table full of things, "The Ministry of Health is amazing! This is a huge help."

"I'll be conducting disease control research in this area these days, so I can teach you simple medical skills by the way." Liu San studied pharmacy, but he had been crash-trained in simple surgery in the hospital.

So Liu San started practicing medicine in the Thirteen Villages area. Not only practicing medicine in the church but also constantly making house calls together with Dong Weiwei when she went down to villages for inspection work. This caused their popularity rating in the area to skyrocket. Liu San was very careful during his rounds, recording every observation daily—he was also responsible for basic hygiene survey work here.

During his rounds seeing patients, Liu San deeply realized what "shortage of doctors and medicine" meant. People here knew there was a profession called "doctor" in the world that cured diseases for others, but few could enjoy a doctor's diagnosis and treatment. Even wandering bell-ringing doctors carrying medicine chests were rarely seen. Once sick, they waited for self-healing; sometimes they would use some folk remedies of unknown efficacy. Various infectious diseases, chronic diseases, and parasitic diseases were rampant; infant and maternal mortality rates were high, and gynecological diseases were very common. Being a woman, Dong Weiwei was especially sympathetic to this. She suggested several times whether to send a few professional nurses here.

Liu San didn't care much about this aspect. His own medical staff in Bairen were not enough, and there was a shortage of medicine; how could he send people? Besides, practicing medicine wasn't his main business. He paid more attention to collecting various folk remedies during his rounds. Useful or not, whenever he encountered a folk remedy, he would carefully transcribe it, and then verify what the drugs in the remedy actually were one by one. Even the most absurd remedies, he didn't let go. He did manage to collect quite a few prescriptions successively.

That day he was sitting in the ancestral hall seeing patients and had seen quite a few. For those he had medicine to give, he gave a few doses; for those he didn't, he had to give some licorice root—purely a placebo. Fortunately, it was good enough for the common folks to have a doctor to see, not to mention he didn't take a penny, so they didn't fuss much. Having been busy all morning, just as he took out a rice ball to eat, someone suddenly shouted outside: "Make way, make way, is the doctor in?"

Hearing the voice, Liu San knew a critical patient must have arrived. He hurriedly shouted: "Here, come in quickly!"

Several men came in from outside, carrying a patient.

"Put him on the board, let me take a look." He ordered and walked over.

The patient was a boy of eleven or twelve. His facial muscles were twitching constantly, his jaw was locked tight, looking like a "bitter smile" (risus sardonicus), with laryngospasm and difficult, rapid breathing. Liu San was shocked when he saw it—this was a typical symptom of tetanus.

"Where is the external wound?"

The person who carried him in hurriedly pointed to his foot, wrapped in a dirty rag. Liu San tore it off; before his eyes was a very deep wound. Asking the accompanying people again, he learned it was stabbed by rake tines. This made it even more certain.

"This is tetanus!" Liu San looked grave. Judging by the patient's appearance, the toxins had already begun to take effect. Once tetanus set in, it was quite dangerous even in a modern hospital. Let alone he was empty-handed, without even hydrogen peroxide to clean the wound, let alone tetanus antitoxin.

"Doctor, please look at my child." The middle-aged man who carried him in begged bitterly. Then several old and young women knelt before him—probably his family—all crying.

"Don't rush," Liu San steadied his mind, TCM treatment prescriptions flashing through his brain. He immediately wrote a prescription, "Go fill this prescription immediately! There might still be time!"

The person receiving the prescription looked helpless. Liu San had been here for a long time and knew the people here were extremely poor; filling a prescription was simply a fantasy for many. He quickly took out his private seal and stamped it on the prescription.

"Go to the raw medicine shop in the county right now and give the prescription to them!" Because the shopkeeper of that medicine shop dealt with Liu San often, they were very familiar. Asking them to credit a few doses of medicine was no problem.

The middle-aged man wanted to kneel and kowtow. Liu San ordered: "Go quickly! It'll be too late if you delay!" Then he shouted to the people crowded aside: "Out, out, what are you all crowding for?" Tetanus patients needed quiet to avoid stimulation. He thought for a moment; right now it was best to disinfect his wound. Without hydrogen peroxide, he had to use potassium permanganate—this stuff was quite precious now, and there wasn't much in the medical kit. Just thinking, Dong Weiwei came in.

"Doctor Liu, go eat. I made fried rice noodles today—" She was startled seeing the constantly twitching child lying on the door board.

"Tetanus!" Liu San explained, "You have to help me."

"Okay, okay." Dong Weiwei hurriedly put on the blue cloth gown hanging on the wall. She didn't have a white coat, but ever since Liu San came, following his suggestion, she wore a gown, mask, and hat whenever seeing patients or treating.

"Move him to a quiet place first. The patient cannot be stimulated." Here, for the convenience of seeing patients, all doors and windows were open, and the light was very bright.

"Move him to the east wing of the church. No one lives there." Dong Weiwei immediately found two soldiers to help carry the person to the east wing. Liu San asked people to paste paper on the windows again, making the room as dim as possible.

"Prepare a 1:1000 potassium permanganate solution! Quick!" Liu San observed the wound; many dirty things adhered to it. Iron tools, rakes, farm fields—with these three elements combined, it would be strange not to get tetanus.

Dong Weiwei hurriedly took out the bottle containing potassium permanganate from the medical kit, then found an enamel basin and clear water. Suddenly she asked: "Drat! No measuring cup, no scale!"

"Put one crystal in first, then dilute with water slowly. Watch the color of the solution!" Liu San said, "Light red is about right; purple is too concentrated."

After preparing the solution, he first debrided the wound, then flushed it continuously with potassium permanganate solution. The child twitched from time to time on the door board. Dong Weiwei quickly came up to help hold him down.

"It's okay. Look at his tongue coating. Is it yellow and rough?"

Dong Weiwei used a tongue depressor and finally pried open his tightly closed teeth with great difficulty.

"No!"

"How is the body temperature? Is there a fever?"

"Fever." Dong Weiwei touched his forehead, "Do we need a thermometer?"

"How is the sweating situation?"

"Sweating, but not profuse sweating."

Liu San looked at his complexion again. No terrible bluish-purple color appeared, which meant the condition hadn't entered the second stage yet—TCM called it "Wind toxin entering the interior." The probability of success using TCM therapy was relatively high. His mood relaxed slightly.

"No need," he said. "The child's current stage is called 'Wind toxin in the exterior' in TCM, still in the initial phase. Feel his pulse. What is the pulse?"

Dong Weiwei knew he was taking this opportunity to teach her TCM diagnosis. She felt with her fingers for a while and hesitated: "I'm not very good at this, but it feels like a wiry and rapid pulse."

"This indicates his illness is still very serious." It depended on the speed of getting the medicine. Liu San said, "Hurrying, a round trip takes about half a day. This child can likely survive."

Dong Weiwei looked at this child, thin and small, dressed in rags. Suddenly compassion arose: "Actually, doesn't Bairen General Hospital have serum? Wouldn't it be fine to fetch a dose and give him a shot?"

"Hehe," Liu San laughed strangely, "There is only so much tetanus antitoxin in total, and quite a bit has been used since D-Day. We have to save it for our own people."

"It doesn't matter for one dose, right?" Dong Weiwei naturally knew the value of serum.

"One dose of serum can also save a life. Whose life do you say we save?"

Dong Weiwei was speechless. This question was too cruel and too realistic.

"So I have to seize every opportunity now to attempt TCM therapies." After flushing the wound, Liu San didn't cover or suture it, leaving it open. "Serum will run out one day. By then, we'll rely entirely on herbal medicine."

Then, under his guidance, Dong Weiwei performed acupuncture on the patient to curb the spasm reaction.

Late at night, the medicine was finally brought back. Liu San personally ground the medicine into fine powder, sifted it, mixed it, and fed it to the patient with hot wine, then applied the medicinal powder to the wound.

"This is improved based on a traditional patent prescription called *Yuzhen* (Jade True) Powder." Liu San handed the prescription to Dong Weiwei. "You can study it. Tetanus is a frequently encountered disease here. Mastering these makes it easy to handle."

Like this, taking medicine and applying medicine daily, Liu San also instructed to give him saline water regularly. After a few days, the condition improved greatly, and the phenomena of spasms and rigidity disappeared. Liu San was greatly encouraged—in the past, he only knew tetanus could also be treated with TCM, but he had never seen an actual case. The case before his eyes doubled his confidence. At least a disease threatening the future health of the Transmigration Group had a corresponding treatment method. He hurriedly organized the entire treatment process, including pulse records, prescriptions, medication, and various treatment methods and measures used. This way, it could be used as a standard medical case model to teach future doctors.

Seeing this child getting better day by day, because it was a life he saved himself, Liu San's feeling towards him was quite different. He often went to the ward to see him and talk. To facilitate moving around the county to collect herbs and treat diseases, Liu San learned some Lingao dialect, so communication wasn't difficult.

Chatting, he learned this child was surnamed Fu—Liu San knew "Fu" was a big surname in Lingao; regardless of rich or poor, high or low, many people had this surname. As for the name, there simply wasn't one, not even names like Dog Leftover or Stone. He ranked fourth, so he was called Fu Sinan (Fu Fourth Male).

Although Fu Sinan claimed to rank fourth, he was actually the second in the family. He was eleven or twelve this year. Two of the three elder brothers before him had already died before fifteen. He had three living siblings now. Fu Sinan's family circumstances were like most people here, poor as church mice, living in a house with bamboo strip walls and thatched roofs, eating sweet potatoes and taro for half the year—and often not having enough to eat. In summary, a standard specimen of a peasant in the evil old society.

After talking with him for a few days, Liu San realized this child had great attainments in gardening—he was responsible for tending his family's vegetable garden. Moreover, he had a personality willing to communicate with others, which was rare here. In Liu San's experience, common folks in this timeline were generally silent gourds; basically, they either answered one question at a time or simply rolled their eyes and didn't speak.

Having such an expressive and communicative child made Liu San feel in a very good mood. Thinking of the Executive Committee's call for everyone to "take apprentices," and that he was good at gardening and planting which would be very helpful for his own herb growing, Liu San asked:

"Can you read?"

"No." Fu Sinan shook his head.

"Want to learn to read?"

"No money to learn..."

"Mm, how about being an apprentice with me? You can be a doctor in the future too."
