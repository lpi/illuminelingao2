"—The above is my financial report." Xiao Zishan finished presenting to the stern-faced group. Finally, he superfluously added: "I guarantee not one cent was embezzled!"

"Whether finances are problematic—we'll know after Financial-Department audit. Stop guaranteeing." Ma Qianzhu didn't trust self-proclaimed oaths. If nobody was currently embezzling, it was only because embezzlement was currently unnecessary.

"Now I'll discuss various departments' progress, requests, and problems." Ma Qianzhu retrieved his notebook.

**As of today, November 10, 1628—D+71—Travelers' work-progress:**

**Communications:** Basically completed Bairren-Fortress-centered wireless-network, 35–40 km coverage. Established long-range radio-station in Guangzhou; 15W station at Salt-Field Village.

*Next plan:* Complete Bopu Port–Bairren Fortress, Damei Village–Bairren Fortress, Salt-Field Village–Bairren Fortress wired-telephone installation. Establish telephone-exchange at Bairren Fortress.

*Problems:* Insufficient wire and insulation-materials.

Industrial and Communications departments jointly concluded: telephone-wire could be self-produced—premise: obtaining raw-materials (iron or copper wire). Insulation could use glass.

**Energy:** Completed 630 kW generation capacity—hydro: 200 kW; thermal: 420 kW (Bopu and Bairren each have one 213 kW camel-type-boiler generator). Other sources: 10 kW. Completed Bopu–Bairren power-distribution network. Installed wind-power at Salt-Field Village.

*Next plan:* Bairren Waterfall Hydroelectric Phase-Two—add one 200 kW unit.

*Problems:* Construction-materials and labor shortage.

**Construction:** One 16-chamber rotary-kiln; one lime-kiln; two combined brick-tile machines; one crude electric-grinder. Maximum annual brick-tile capacity: 30 million pieces. Additionally: 1 ton/day pozzolanic-cement. One vertical cement-kiln, 85% complete—upon completion: 55 tons/day Portland-cement.

*Problems:* Lacking coal and iron-ore for cement. Cement and steel shortages prevent concrete-construction.

**Transportation:** Completed Bopu–Bairren–Lingao County-seat simple-road.

*Next plan:* Construct Bairren Bridge; open Salt-Field Village–Bairren simple-road; dredge Wenlan River's Bopu–Bairren section for navigation.

Current vehicles: 12 four-wheel-drive farm-trucks; 2 Beijing-212 jeeps; 4 750cc sidecar-motorcycles; 10 125cc motorcycles; 200 bicycles. Industrial-Department also reconditioned 17 captured handcarts; self-manufactured 10 two-wheeled horse-carts. Plus 2 boats offloaded from *Fengcheng*—for Wenlan River transport. However, river-depth was limited (1m at low-water)—lacking suitable shallow-draft vessels, water-transport remained minimal.

Large construction-machinery showing severe wear—especially hydraulics. These parts couldn't be repaired at current industrial-levels. At present work-intensity, wear-parts would be exhausted within 18 months. Cars and motorcycles in good condition—but fuel-supply outlook concerning. Diesel reserves plentiful; gasoline, being volatile, was nearly depleted—alternative-energy urgently needed. Lubricants well-stocked. Agricultural-Department developing alternatives—target: castor-oil. Four-wheeled-cart manufacturing stalled—lacking metal for steering and suspension leaf-springs.

**Manufacturing:** Completed machine-shop infrastructure and equipment-installation—built on Zhan Wuya's existing shop plus additional equipment. But currently severely under-utilized—waiting for materials.

Wood/bamboo/rattan processing thriving. Safety-helmets achieved batch-production. Bopu's timber-processing and woodworking reached stable-scale: one drying-kiln; one dry-distillation kiln. Producing various-sized planks, furniture, wooden-components—plus wood-tar, tannin, charcoal. Despite lacking jute, local flax/hemp successfully made sturdy rope.

**Chemical Industry:** Controlled Lingao's main saltworks: Ma'ao Saltworks. Using traditional methods—1 ton/day salt. Near-term goal: improve and expand to 5 tons/day crude-salt, 1 ton/day food-salt.

One 800-ton synthetic-ammonia/combined-soda-process system and one coal-coking-chemical system being installed. These large, complex multi-component systems with extensive piping—installation very complicated, progress slow. Fortunately, transmigrators couldn't yet supply coal at-scale anyway. Chemical-Department planned a crude electrolytic-salt plant at Bopu—producing salt, caustic-soda, bleaching-powder. Requested Bopu generator-expansion.

With synthetic-ammonia not yet operational, Chemical-Group could only utilize existing materials—successfully making ammonium-sawdust explosives from stored ammonium-nitrate. Currently concentrating on granulating captured Gou Manor gunpowder. Also trial-producing nitrocellulose and mercury-fulminate from brought finished-nitric-acid. Due to danger—requesting safer separate explosives-factory location.

**Mining/Metallurgy:** Controlled one construction-quarry. Abundantly available minerals: clay, limestone, quartz-sand, lignite.

Four small converters and supporting forging/rolling/cold-drawing equipment installed. With sufficient pig-iron supply—could produce 10–15 tons/day crude-steel. Currently only intermittently operating one 1-ton converter—raw-materials: captured iron-cannons, weapons, iron-shot, plus damaged steel-tools. Fuel: charcoal—high consumption—only producing urgently-needed hardware and tools. Blast-furnace construction required massive iron-ore, coke, limestone—and once lit, couldn't easily halt. With unstable raw-material supply—construction postponed.

**Civilian:** One crude paper-mill operational—using rags, waste-cotton, straw—producing rough daily-use paper. Plan: recruit mainland paper-masters for improvement. After acid-alkali products enter batch-production—build modern paper-mill. Meeting not just transmigrators' office/daily-paper needs, but mass-exporting to mainland and overseas.

Operational or soon-operational: textile-mill, garment-factory, food-factory, ceramics-factory.

Temporarily non-operational due to material-issues: glass-factory, sugar-refinery, cigarette-factory. Material-issues being resolved.

...

"Overall, our industrialization is mainly blocked by three key problems: electricity, coal, iron." Ma Qianzhu summarized. Building industrial-systems—even targeting 19th-century levels—remained extremely difficult.

Pig-iron issue: if Guangdong procurement-channels opened, stable long-term supply was achievable. Coal: Committee decided to quickly send people to Vietnam for coal. He suggested using barges for a one-time 1,000-ton purchase. Coal as primary chemical-feedstock justified some diesel-consumption.

"With sufficient coal and steel—Industrial-Department can replicate steam-engines. With adequate prime-movers, industrial-capacity immediately rises a level." Ma Qianzhu explained. Steam-engines weren't efficient—but simple, easy-to-manufacture—suited transmigrators' current situation. Besides driving generators, they could directly power machinery. Committee also planned using them as future ship-propulsion.

Beyond steam-engines, Industrial-Department needed to mass-produce hardware and tools—demand was enormous during construction-boom—supply couldn't meet demand.

Next, Wu De reported as labor-department head: "Labor remains tight. As of midnight today—directly-controlled human-resources:

Travelers: 478

Bairren Production Team One: 141

Bairren Production Team Two: 605 (from former Gou Manor)

Prisoners: 153 (Gou family servants, guards, relatives)

Slaves: 176 (purchased in Guangzhou; 98 transported back)

Indirectly-controlled human-resources:

Salt-Field Village: 200 households, ~800 people

Damei Village: 50 households, ~250 people

Population-structure: native-labor had many prime-aged adults, but gender-ratios were skewed. Especially in production-teams—Team-One: male:female ratio 9:1; Team-Two: 5:1. Villages similar—only Salt-Field Village had normal ratios; Damei Village had same problem.

Reason: Lingao had large floating-populations. It was a major migrant-destination. Single men came for reclamation and short-term labor—mostly from Guangdong/Fujian, but investigation revealed some from as far as Jiangxi, Huguang, even Beizhili and Shandong.

Such population-structure was beneficial short-term—male prime-adults were construction-mainstay. But long-term, places lacking women meant men wouldn't settle and establish families. Future immigration must prioritize gender-balance.
