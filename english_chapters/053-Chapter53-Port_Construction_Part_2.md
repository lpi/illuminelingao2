# Chapter 53: Port Construction (Part 2)

"U.C. 0079, U.C. 0083, U.C. 0093, A.C. 0197 personnel—assemble at Green Beach to prepare for vehicle unloading."

At the walkie-talkie call, several specialty groups who'd just come down the pier groggily rose from the sand—Red Beach was the landing zone from Pier 1, Yellow Beach was the small-boat zone, Green Beach was the barge and landing-craft zone. After a day on the ship, their first steps on solid ground felt unsteady. They'd dropped their big packs at the rest point and were sitting on rocks catching their breath. "Rest point" was a stretch—just a folding table with a computer and ledger, plus a board reading "PERSONNEL REST POINT" in big characters. On the sand studded with pebbles of all sizes, signs stood here and there: "TOILET," "FOOD/WATER STATION"—indicating future facilities.

These four groups: the U.C. codes meant large-vehicle licenses; A.C. meant construction-machinery licenses. North American Branch's Qian Shuixie had repeatedly expressed his desire to join the Military Group and defend the crossing regime with a gun, but his declared skill—driving large container trucks—landed him in U.C. 0079. Working with strangers was a bit dull, but he soon found someone more dejected: Bai Yu, a military talent who'd graduated in armored-vehicle command and weapons/engineering design—now assigned to drive a crawler tractor.

To begin construction quickly after landing, Meng De and the Committee had pre-sorted materials before loading. Supplies needed immediately were concentrated on the 1,500-ton self-propelled barge: vehicles, construction machinery, and basic-infrastructure materials.

The flat-deck barge's fully loaded draft was only 1.83 meters. Though it couldn't beach like a landing craft, it got much closer than a large cargo ship. Of course, vehicles still couldn't drive directly into water this deep—so a floating dock was installed here too, designated Pier 2.

Self-propelled barges had no vehicle ramps and no derricks. Fortunately, the Engineering Group had prepared: Pier 2 was equipped with vehicle loading/unloading ramps.

"Getting ready to unload vehicles! Everyone stay safe—wear life jackets. If there's any risk of falling in, get out of the vehicle immediately. Don't worry—haven't you all taken car ferries? Same thing..." As temporary leader of these four groups, Bai Yu gave safety briefings while boosting morale.

The dozens of people looked at each other skeptically. *Same thing?* Starting a vehicle on this swaying deck, driving up a narrow ramp, then down onto an equally swaying floating dock—this was way too hard!

Seeing everyone hesitate, Bai Yu knew someone had to lead by example. He'd driven tanks in the military, after all. Steeling himself, he called out "Watch me!" and was first to climb onto the Dongfanghong 1202 universal crawler tractor.

The roar of the engine starting somewhat reassured Bai Yu. The cab had excellent visibility; the 24V battery started fast and stable. In the military, he'd driven tanks, APCs, and various engineering vehicles; boarding pontoons or ferry barges was routine. But this floating dock and vehicle ramp were pure handmade knockoffs—their actual strength and load capacity only God knew.

He hesitated, watching the ramp swaying on the blue water and the heaving dock below, then engaged the engine. The ship noticeably shifted. No time to worry—eyes fixed on Qian Shuixie waving the signal flag. The tracks spun on the steel plate with teeth-grinding friction, inching onto the ramp. The moment the tracks touched the ramp, the floating dock below began drifting and the ramp shifted. Everyone froze. Zhuo Tianmin from the Engineering Group spotted this and sprinted over:

"What are you all staring at?! Pull the cables!"

Engineering had pre-installed four steel cables on the barge precisely for this—to be pulled taut manually during unloading, minimizing ship and dock drift.

"Pull! Pull!" Under his constant shouting, everyone grabbed the cables and heaved backward with all their might. With great difficulty, the tractor finally made it onto the floating dock.

With the first success, everything became easier. Two hours later, all the transmigrators' construction machinery was ashore, neatly lined up on the beach:

- 2× Dongfanghong 1202 universal crawler tractors with excavator buckets and dozer blades
- 4× Dongfanghong 404Z1W front-loader/backhoe tractors (medium wheel tractors)
- 4× Dongfanghong 170V wheel tractors (small wheel tractors)
- 10× Changchai single-cylinder diesel dump trucks
- 1× Dongfanghong 18-ton wheel roller
- 1× 25-ton truck crane
- 2× towed concrete mixers
- 4× air compressors

Most construction machinery was Dongfanghong series from Luoyang First Tractor Factory to reduce maintenance complexity.

With this much equipment, forget a small temporary base—you could build a new city.

But Mei Wan and Bing Feng, in charge of infrastructure, still felt somewhat at a loss. Machinery, fuel, electricity—all available. The problem was lack of building materials.

The barge had loaded plenty of rebar and cement, but Engineering had neither sand nor gravel—couldn't use the most common and convenient modern material: concrete. Traditional bricks were an option, but where would you find bricks on this desolate beach? Ming-era Lingao County surely had brick kilns, but their locations required reconnaissance.

Of course, some infrastructure needed no raw materials—improvise with what you had. Bing Feng's task: build a cargo staging yard at Red Beach. Just temporary—no need for surface hardening. Simple raised and compacted ground with drainage would suffice. From Bing Feng's construction-company experience, this scale of work—a crew of 10–20 with shovels, pickaxes, and wheelbarrows—could be done in a morning. With full mechanization, they should do even better.

So the Transport Group became the construction crew. Red Beach roared with machinery; vehicles bounced back and forth; dust rose sky-high. Everyone knew the Red Beach staging yard was under construction. The intense atmosphere attracted the ever-present Ding Ding couple. The foreign woman was bold—with beach temperatures only 27–28°C, she wore a tight tank top and cutoff jeans, climbing everywhere taking photos. Her long, pale bare legs flashed before everyone; occasionally she'd stick out her round bottom for a better shot. Old and young on the work site felt their blood surge with obvious physiological reactions. After several near-accidents with dump trucks almost hitting people and excavators digging in the wrong direction, Bing Feng reluctantly had to chase the couple away.

The staging-yard ground sloped slightly from south to north. After surveying, the gradient was under 1:10—normally, such slopes didn't require stripping topsoil; just clearing large rocks and brush sufficed before compaction. But soil samples showed the surface was almost entirely loose sand and fine gravel with weak cohesion. They ended up using dozers to completely strip the sandy topsoil and gravel.

Since the yard was on a slope, the foundation used a cut-and-fill approach. First, excavators dug a catchment ditch at the slope's highest point to collect rainwater, then drainage ditches on east and west sides to discharge into the bay. Excavated soil became fill material.

Beneath the stripped surface, the soil sample was sandy—good permeability, stable when compacted. Bing Feng used all this soil as foundation fill. Dump trucks brought fill to pour on the foundation. Every 20cm of fill was compacted with 3 roller passes, then more fill, more compaction. Two rounds and it was essentially complete. Bing Feng had originally planned to top the entire site with crushed stone, but they had no rock crusher. Beach stones varied in size and shape—not easily usable—so they skipped that step. The finished staging yard sat slightly elevated, rectangular from above, with sloped sides and drainage ditches below. The side facing the bay had a simple road built to temporary-road standards connecting to the dock.

"With enough steel beams, we could put a roof over this yard," Bing Feng said regretfully. "For now we can only cover it with tarps."

"We don't have corrugated metal for roofing anyway," Mei Wan said.

"That's fine—wooden planks would work. Temporary structures don't need perfection. I'm mainly worried about the cement from the barge. If rain gets to it, we might as well use it as foundation fill. Without cement, many things become impossible."

"Wooden planks? Speaking of which—where's the lumber? We need it for the camp tower and latrines."

"We're organizing people to unload the cargo tarps from the ship," said Dai Xie, the Planning Committee's Red Beach manager. "Trying to get them ashore ASAP to cover the vulnerable cargo. Lumber—still no stats on that..."

Wood was humanity's earliest and most widely used natural material. The transmigrators naturally wouldn't abandon this easily obtained, easily processed resource. From the start, Personnel had assigned considerable labor to logging.

Many imagined tropical/subtropical Hainan as an island of swaying coconut palms and dense forests—some even assumed it was all rainforest. Actually, due to varying terrain, climate differences, and long-term human exploitation, Hainan's vegetation was quite complex. By the 1950s, Hainan's forest coverage was only 12.8%, mostly concentrated in the central Diaoluo Mountains, Jianfengling, and Bawangling. Though 21st-century Hainan had reached 51.8% forest coverage, it was mostly artificial and secondary growth.

Lingao had a classic tropical monsoon climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. Natural vegetation was mainly tropical savanna—never vast forests. Moreover, due to long settlement, any sizable natural woodlands had long been logged; secondary growth was poor quality. When the transmigrators sought timber from 17th-century Lingao, this was the barren environment they faced.
