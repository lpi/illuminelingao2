# Chapter 2757: The Capital (Part 109)

Xu Ke was increasingly surprised in his heart. What is the background of this "Mr. Le"? To actally be so familiar with the Senate!

"This Mr. Le is widely knowledgeable."

"His capabilities are very great." Liu Sha smiled bitterly. "It is a pity..."

He only said half of "it is a pity" and did not continue. The things he wanted to say now were waiting for a good price to sell; how could he say them easily?

Xu Ke naturally understood his mind and did not question further, waiting quietly for him to make demands.

Everyone has a soft spot, and Liu Sha was naturally no exception.

"I have a daughter." He whispered, "She is an ill-fated connection I unintentionally made while wandering in dissipation outside. The mother and daughter are now in Yingtian Prefecture..."

"Nanjing?!" Xu Ke wondered, "You are a local; why arrange for them to go to Nanjing?"

"The scenery of Jiangnan nurtures people. Besides, the child's mother is from Nanjing. Naturally, there are people to look after them locally." Liu Sha said feebly, "I do a business of licking blood from the blade tip; I dare not keep the child by my side."

Xu Ke was quite puzzled because the Foreign Intelligence Bureau had no news at all about him having a child. Probably even the people around him didn't know. Why did he say it himself? Could it be that the Senate's reputation was good enough to be trusted even by enemies?

Although with the Senate's size and status, it would decidedly not make things difficult for a child. There were also judicial principles of "no implication of family" and "crime does not extend to wife and children," but doing one thing while saying another has happened in all dynasties. Who could guarantee that there were no Senators intending to "cut the weeds and remove the roots"?

As Liu Sha, rationally and emotionally, the wisest choice would be to keep his mouth shut about this matter.

Holding such doubts, he continued to listen.

Liu Sha smiled bitterly: "I am not entrusting an orphan! You and I are enemy states; it was originally you die or I live. But in this matter, now that things have come to a head, I can only entrust you."

"Just speak."

"This woman was originally a girl from a brothel by the Qinhuai River. Since she had my flesh and blood, I bought a house in Yingtian to settle the mother and daughter. Unexpectedly, a guest from when she was doing business, a villainous young master from the Wei Duke's clan, actually kidnapped both mother and daughter."

Xu Ke was startled. The Wei Duke was the descendant of Xu Da. In the early Ming Dynasty, Xu Da was posthumously titled King of Zhongshan, and the Prince's mansion was set up in Nanjing City. The mansion was inside the Jubao Gate at Dagongfang. Later generations inherited the title of Duke of Wei (Wei Guogong). They were a prominently famous noble family in Nanjing City.

One can imagine the power of such a family with generations of official tassels in the local area. Let alone the Prefect of Yingtian, even the Governor of Yingtian had to give the Xu family some face. Even if it was not the direct main branch, wanting to demand people back was very difficult.

"It's just a villainous young master from the clan, not the young master of the Duke's own family. You work for Master Wang and formerly served in the Jinyiwei. You also have people in Nanjing. Couldn't you pull some strings?"

"If it were a legitimate young master of the Duke's family committing a crime, it would be easier to handle." Liu Sha sighed, "Generations of nobles still want some face. These distant relatives and close branches are the most scoundrelly. Moreover, he is a fox friend and dog friend (bad influence) of the Second Young Master of the Duke's family, receiving his protection. Usually, he acts lawlessly in Yingtian Prefecture, and no one dares to question him. Even if I have some connections, I have no way to start."

After the incident, he went to ask Master Wang for advice. However, Master Wang was unwilling to offend the nobles and only gave him a sum of silver, letting him "solve it secretly." Liu Sha knew the Master was unwilling to stick his head out, so he had to find another way.

"...Speaking of serving in the Jinyiwei in the past, the duties of the Southern Township Guard (*Nan Zhenfu*) and the Northern Township Guard were originally poles apart. They are called Township Guard Offices (*Zhenfu Si*), but in reality, they don't count as colleagues, so there is no friendship or connection. Furthermore," he sighed long, "I don't serve in the Northern Township Guard Office now either."

After the Jinyiwei Southern Township Guard Office moved north to the Capital, only duties like managing military artisan registries and weapon manufacturing remained. It was not a popular yamen in Yingtian Prefecture.

Liu Sha's activity energy was very great, but the black and gray forces of Yingtian Prefecture were unwilling to offend the Wei Duke's family for him. "A bare stick (bachelor/loner) does not fight power"; this is the iron law of mixing in society through the ages.

"...Originally, I planned to get this large sum of silver, then head straight south to Yingtian Prefecture. Recruit a few desperadoes and settle this matter directly. Take the mother and daughter to fly far away. Unexpectedly, the silver did not come to hand..."

"I see, you want us to save them?"

"Exactly." Liu Sha said, "You are foreign powerhouses, with no cares or ties. You even kill the Emperor's old man, let alone a mere villainous young master of the Wei Duke's mansion."

Xu Ke laughed loudly: "What you say is true. A trivial matter." After speaking, he restrained his smile and said, "There is no need to report this matter; I can decide it myself. I give you three promises: First, I will immediately telegraph headquarters to send people to Nanjing to do this. As long as the mother and daughter are still in Nanjing, they will definitely be rescued. Second, after rescue, they will be settled in a place of your choice, whether Nanjing or elsewhere, and sent there by personnel, with an additional sum of settlement silver given. Third, if you like, this person's head will be offered with both hands."

"Straightforward!" Liu Sha nodded, "I know Australians have always kept their word the most. Presumably, Sir is no exception."

"I will also tell you a truth. I am a dignified Senator of the Great Song; how could I break my word?" Xu Ke chuckled, "Not to mention a villainous young master from the Wei Duke's clan, even for the Wei Duke himself, taking his head is as easy as turning over a hand."

"Good. With these words from Sir, I am at ease."

Xu Ke immediately asked for the names of the mother and daughter, the original residence, the name of the villainous young master, and a series of details. He had someone register them in a book and let Liu Sha look over it to ensure no errors, then sent it back to "Center" for processing.

"Now, let's talk about Mr. Le." Xu Ke was most concerned about this person.

"He is not surnamed Le, but Zhou." Liu Sha revealed important information in the first sentence.

"Surnamed Zhou? What is the full name?"

"Hehe, it's strange to say." Liu Sha said, "Called Zhou Lezhi."

"Good name." Xu Ke said, "What's strange about it?"

"Originally he wasn't called Zhou Lezhi, only after a certain day did he become Zhou Lezhi."

Xu Ke didn't understand for a moment and asked: "What does this mean?"

"The current Zhou Lezhi is not Zhou Lezhi, but Zhou Lezhi's apprentice. Later, Zhou Lezhi disappeared, and he became Zhou Lezhi."

"Damn, isn't this inheriting a name? We don't have this tradition either!" Xu Ke thought, then asked, "So what?"

"The current Zhou Lezhi inherited his master's mantle." Liu Sha said with a shiver, "These two, master and apprentice, didn't look alike at all to speak of, but in recent years, one increasingly feels the two are indistinguishable..."

"Speak more clearly." Xu Ke said, "What is the background of this old Zhou Lezhi, and how did the new one come out?"

Liu Sha smiled bitterly: "What I know is also limited. I came later than them. Their matters were mostly heard from others' mouths."

At that moment, he roughly recounted how the master and apprentice Zhou Lezhi came to the Wang mansion. He heard most of these things from Liu Zhao, Jin Wenchi, and others.

Xu Ke was more surprised the more he listened. From his description, this "Old Zhou Lezhi" was very likely an accidental transmigrator like Black (*Heier*). But the description concerning him had a lot of supernatural plot points, like "flying heads in the sky" and such—that could be let pass, but the key was that "New Zhou Lezhi" was originally just a young lad who had studied for a few years in the countryside of Guangzhou. Under the master's teaching, his learning advanced by leaps and bounds. The most crucial thing was that Leng Ningyun said with certainty that "Mr. Le's" thinking was not like a scholar of this spacetime.

Could it be that there really is "body seizing" or "soul travel" in this world? Thinking again, didn't we ourselves transmigrate from another spacetime...

His materialistic view began to waver, but finally, pure rationality gained the upper hand. These were all just what Liu Zhao heard; it might not be impossible that Wang Yehao fabricated them to fool people. But one thing was certain: this Zhou Lezhi, whether new or old, definitely could not be separated from the old spacetime.

"This Zhou Lezhi is indeed a strange man!" Xu Ke said, "I originally thought he was just an ordinary strategist, expectedly he has such hills and valleys in his chest!"

"Yes, everyone around Stone Elder admires him tightly." Liu Sha said, "Master Wang says he knows the thoughts of the Australians like the palm of his hand."

Xu Ke nodded slightly, calculating in his heart. This confession was too valuable, even more valuable than the Stone Elder group! This Liu Sha is a rare commodity to hoard!

"Could this Mr. Zhou be the Daoist Furnace Stone in the correspondence?"

"Yes, it is precisely him." Liu Sha said, "People around Stone Elder all use 'Daoist [Something]-Stone' as a code name."

"You are Daoist Wood-Stone, he is Daoist Furnace Stone. Who else?"

"The private assistant around the Master who specializes in handling matters under Stone Elder's name, named Jin Wenchi; he is Daoist Gold Stone. There may be others, but I am not clear either."

"Do these people all live inside the Wang mansion?"

"Naturally not. Except for Daoist Gold Stone, each has a lodging. They absolutely do not leverage unless there is something. Someone mediates contact, meeting at designated places to discuss matters. If there is no urgent matter, they won't go to the Wang mansion either."

Xu Ke nodded secretly. This set of practices had quite the concept of modern clandestine work. Wang's side used single-line contacts. There was no lateral contact between them. In this way, even if a heavyweight figure was netted, they couldn't provide too much intelligence.

The key is that this is still in the Ming Dynasty's ruled area! The caution of the Stone Elder group can be seen.

"Who was that person killed by you?"

"He was one of Master Wang's trusted aides, named Wang Liang."

"He knew your lodging in Tongzhou?"

"Yes. Usually, he was the one contacting me."

"You killed this person; was it because he knew your intention?"

"Exactly. I originally wanted to buy him off with silver, but unexpectedly he refused both soft and hard tactics. I could only finish him off." Liu Sha said resentfully, "Unexpectedly, he was already on guard!"

Xu Ke had already mastered these situations. Asking again this time was to check for loop holes against the previous confession.

"Did this Wang Liang know Zhou Lezhi?"

"He knew him. He was an old servant by Master Wang's side."

"Do you know Zhou Lezhi's whereabouts?"
