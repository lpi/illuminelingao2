# Chapter 2542: Chen Qing's Secret

Immediately, he recounted one by one how he visited the textile park and how he participated in Wu Yijun's cotton textile project.

Then Chen Lin spoke out the general plan: intending to rebuild a cotton textile factory on that piece of sandy land along the river in the south, producing with Australian secret techniques.

"...Now what the Australians lack most is various colored cotton cloths. As long as we weave them, we won't worry about selling..." Chen Lin blew the market prospects up to the sky with flowers falling. "Now the silk workshop is in depression, and the days of clan members are also difficult. If we have this cotton textile factory, everyone will have a livelihood, and the lives of clan relatives can also be slightly more relaxed."

Although the Chen Clan of Nansha had a prominent reputation and considerable power locally, its foundation was still shallow. Because the clan had never had a major breakthrough in the Civil Service Examination path all these years. Benefiting from collective support under the clan system, some scholars were produced, but not even a single *Juren* was passed. The highest degree was just a *Bagong*, and he never held a substantive office.

Although the Nansha Chen Clan claimed to be a family of farming and studying, the gold content in this "studying" was obviously not much. Without the degrees of *Juren* and *Jinshi*, they couldn't mix into the ranks of the gentry. The power in the local area was very limited, relying entirely on living together as a clan and having many people to become a force in the county.

Because of this, apart from a few clan members engaged in industry and commerce, the Chen clan members still had to rely on farming and working for a living. Working in the silk workshop was a major source of income for Chen clan members in the past.

Now although the silk workshop had recovered, because Chen Xuan's "position was improper," he quoted [hired] a large number of foreign-surname workers, and Chen clan members were excluded instead—although the reason on the surface was insufficient start of work, Chen clan members understood what was going on and had many complaints.

The Chen family was looted by rogue soldiers not long ago, and everyone from top to bottom was destitute. Once Chen Lin's "Grand Plan of Building a Factory" was thrown out, it immediately gained the support of the young people.

"After everyone goes back, blow more wind to parents and elders, talk about the benefits of this cotton textile factory." Seeing the heat was about right, Chen Lin immediately ordered people to distribute the "gifts" he brought to everyone.

"These are some small objects I purchased in Lingao. Not valuable things, but they are all practical items for home. You take them back to your family members."

These things were actually just: candles, matches, candies, mosquito repellent water, common household medicines... Although not valuable, they were practical and effective items.

Chen Lin said some encouraging words to everyone again, asking everyone to await the news of the start of the cotton textile factory construction at any time. When hiring workers, clan members would definitely be considered first.

After everyone dispersed, Chen Lin walked into the courtyard with excitement, looking at the stars filling the sky, feeling that there were infinite possibilities before his eyes. He glanced at the east and west wing rooms where the internship group lived. The lights were still on: what were they busy with? Probably still for the new textile factory. Although it was the Wu Yijun family's property, their clan also had a share here. The key was, once this project could be done well, he would be considered to have entered the Australian's method eye [favor], and would have a great chance to board the big ship of the Australians in the future.

He was just planning to go to the internship group's wing room to "discuss matters," but suddenly saw Chen Qing nestling with someone in the corner saying something, looking very intimate. He was secretly surprised: hadn't heard Chen Qing had any sweetheart in the village; didn't expect this kid to be quite capable...

Quietly walking over to look, he was instantly struck as if by five thunders: the one nestling in Chen Qing's arms was his cousin/sister Chen Yue!

Speaking of it, Chen Lin was not some old pedant, old fogey, or old feudal type of character—he himself was a young man. Nor was it that he looked down on Chen Qing's family being poor. But the sister's behavior was inevitably too unbridled: a big girl nestling in a man's arms in the dark of night, what kind of matter was this? The most fatal thing was, from the clan law perspective, Chen Yue was Chen Qing's Clan Aunt!

Although Chen Qing's family lineage was far from Chen Lin's grandfather's family, they were passed down from one founding ancestor after all. Such a thing was simply a great shame and humiliation for the clan. The man and woman would both be immersed in a pig cage and executed!

If this matter was exposed, Second Uncle could grasp the handle and accuse him of lax discipline! Directly expelling him from the village. Clan members wouldn't have a second word. Leaving aside taking back clan power and promoting industry and commerce, even whether he could establish a footing in the village in the future would be a huge question mark!

Thinking of this, he broke out in a cold sweat. Afraid of alerting others, he didn't shout to stop immediately. He only emerged from the dark after Chen Yue handed Ah Qing something and left hurriedly.

"Ah Qing!"

"Ninth Uncle!" Ah Qing was awakened from his daze by this voice at once, unconsciously pressing his chest.

"Hand it over!" Chen Lin stretched out his hand with a sunken face.

"What..."

"Don't play dumb!" Chen Lin lowered his voice. "You have such bold guts! Are you not afraid of death?!"

Chen Qing stammered, taking the thing out from his bosom with a heart full of reluctance.

Chen Lin took it and looked; it was a handkerchief. He carefully put away the handkerchief and reprimanded in a low voice: "What death are you courting! You and Chen Yue have the nominal status of aunt and nephew! You dare to do such rebellious things against human relations! If the clan knows, neither you nor she can save your lives!"

Since ancient times, same surnames did not marry, let alone they were clan members passed down from one founding ancestor.

Chen Qing's face was full of loss and he was extremely afraid, begging in a small voice: "Uncle Lin, Chen Yue and I share mutual affection. Don't tell the clan..."

"It's good you know the weight!" Chen Lin said. "Besides you two, who else knows this matter?! Do your parents know?"

Chen Qing shook his head hurriedly and said, "No one knows!"

"No one knows, then how did I know? Don't assume your deeds are secret and no one knows. Others probably just didn't want to meddle!" Chen Lin breathed a heavy sigh. "Consider it Heaven's grace that let me see it."

After speaking, he asked again: " besides this handkerchief, what other tokens of affection have you and Ah Yue exchanged? Take them all out early! Save getting caught by others and treated as ironclad evidence!"

"Gone... Gone..." Chen Qing said trembling.

Chen Lin said nothing more and kicked him, reprimanding in a low voice: "If you want to seek death, go to the river outside the village early; don't implicate others! I ask you one more time, are there anymore?"

Seeing Ninth Uncle who was usually always pleasant becoming so ferocious tonight, Chen Qing was afraid in his heart and had to admit "there are still more."

"Go, to your room, take all the things out!" Chen Lin "escorted" his nephew to the sleeping room. Forcing him to take out all the objects Chen Yue gave him. Besides the handkerchief, there were also shoes and socks she made by hand. Finally, unexpectedly, there was a close-fitting *Dudou* [bellyband]...

This angered Chen Lin badly; this was simply injuring morals and corrupting customs! He slapped Chen Qing twice and asked: "You shameless low-class seed! Honestly say: where did this come from?!"

"No, no," Chen Qing covered his face, scared bad by Ninth Uncle, defending, "This was given to me by Yue'er."

This made Chen Lin so angry his skull cap almost flew up. He didn't expect his sister, who was always well-behaved and obedient, to actually do such a "shameless" thing!

He really wished he could kick this nephew to death. But he calmed down immediately. Chen Qing was his capable helper, and Chen Yue was his sister. He had to protect them from harm.

He took a breath and calmed his mood: asked in a low voice: "Are all the things here? Don't lie to me. If something happens, both of you can't escape death!"

"All here, all here..."

Chen Qing wrapped up all the objects and took him to the kitchen. Seeing no one around, he stuffed them directly into the stove head.

There were still embers in the stove head, and it burned up at once. Chen Lin was still worried, poking it with a firewood stick again, going back only after confirming everything was burned.

"Honestly tell me: did you and Chen Yue have... have..." Chen Lin felt it uncomfortable to mention.

Chen Qing hurriedly said: "No! Definitely no!"

"That's good!" Chen Lin asked again: "Did you send her any tokens?"

"Only a pair of silver earrings, bought by myself."

"Any special marks?"

"No, just the chop name of the silversmith shop."

"What's the chop name?"

"Maoyu. Just in the county seat..."

"Doesn't have your name?"

"No, no." Chen Qing shook his head repeatedly in fright.

Chen Lin breathed a slight sigh of relief. A pair of silver earrings couldn't count as proof. He warned in a low voice: "I'll treat this matter as never happened. You restrain yourself and cut off this improper thought early. Otherwise, neither you nor Yue'er will have a good end! In the future, I will naturally find a good wife for you; you don't need to be anxious for this moment." After speaking, he turned and left, leaving Ah Qing with a face full of loss.

After disciplining the nephew, Chen Lin called his sister over again and reprimanded her in a low voice.

"...You, a perfectly good girl, how could you do such a shameless thing! Actually... actually..." Chen Lin couldn't bring himself to mention seeing his sister's bellyband for a moment, so he took a turn, "Ah Qing is your nephew! Do you want your life! If the clan knows, you will be drowned in a pig cage!"

Chen Yue was so scared she knelt on the ground, repeatedly admitting mistakes, begging her brother not to report it.

"...Don't be afraid. I am your Big Brother, and also Qing'er's Uncle! Even if you did such an ugly thing, I have to cover for you. I already ordered him to burn all the objects you gave. The earrings he sent don't matter; just keep them—and don't wear them out. If anyone asks where they came from, say I bought them for you—understand?"

"Yes, Brother." Chen Yue was already scared out of her wits at this moment; whatever her brother said went.

Chen Lin breathed a heavy sigh and whispered: "Now danger lurks on every side. Don't go down the wrong path. One step wrong, every step wrong. At that time, not only will your lives not be saved, but I will also find it difficult to exist in the clan! You should see Qing'er less, and don't live alone anymore." He thought for a while, "Last time Big Girl Li told me she wanted to bring an apprentice textile worker to help. You move into her room and learn from her!"
