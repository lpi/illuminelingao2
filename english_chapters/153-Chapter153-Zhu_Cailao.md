# Chapter 153: Zhu Cailao

Captured pirates—after Security Group interrogation—quickly confessed everything. Unexpectedly, they weren't the famous Liu Xiang's men—but Zhu Cailao's. Zhu Cailao operated in Guangdong waters. This group wasn't as famous as Zheng family, Liu Xiang, Li Kuiqi, or Zhong Lingxiu among contemporary maritime powers—but started much earlier than Zheng Zhilong. In Wanli 48th year—while Zheng Zhilong was still under Yan Siqi—Zhu Cailao already had northern and southern fleets. That year's February, April, and July saw three attacks on Jieyang; September attacked Chenghai. Tianqi 1st year, another Jieyang attack. Very active maritime group during Tianqi era.

From prisoners, transmigrators learned organizational structure of these merchant-pirate maritime groups. Though having unified organization and leaders, operations were by "shares." As mid-level units between leadership and individual ships, "share bosses" played crucial command roles: appointing ship captains, transmitting chieftain orders, taking responsibility for subordinates' actions. Share sizes varied: small shares had 2–3 ships; large shares might have 40. Depending on loyalty-proximity to chieftain, relationships varied—non-core shares operated freely but followed internal rules and paid percentage earnings (from plunder or trade) to chieftain. When chieftain marshaled forces, all shares unconditionally participated. (Note: Limited resources prevented querying Ming-era maritime group structures; this 19th-century Guangdong pirate organization pattern was used.)

These three ships belonged to one of Zhu Cailao's "share bosses"—a core member. Their mission to Lingao related deeply to the Gou family.

The Gou family—whom transmigrators had "butchered"—was Zhu Cailao's major fence. Much loot was stored at Lingao, then sold through Gou family's Qiongshan connections into Guangdong.

Gou family's destruction took half a month to reach Zhu Cailao. Lingao county's Gou Second vanished from county seat the day after Gou Manor fell—not even notifying Zhu Cailao. Clear-thinking Gou Second calculated: this great sea pirate wouldn't accept losses. Reporting meant massive compensation—possibly bankruptcy. Worse: Zhu Cailao would retaliate against short-hairs. As Lingao native, he'd be conscripted as vanguard. Neither side was provokable—so hide completely. As for avenging his brother: Zhu Cailao would naturally handle short-hairs. Letting the sea pirate act was safer than his weakened local power.

Thus Zhu Cailao was completely blindsided—until recently when liaisons found Gou Manor in ruins. New fortress built atop. Only then learned Gou family was finished. Seeking Gou Second in county seat—vanished completely. Subsequent investigation revealed the story.

Fence destroyed, loot lost—devastating news for Zhu Cailao. Newly recruited Zheng Zhilong was preparing to attack him. Exactly when he needed ships and troops for defense, this crushing blow hit. Years of accumulated resources destroyed. Beyond financial loss: seriously shaking subordinates' confidence. Pirate groups were profit alliances. When chieftains' resources were destroyed—unable to guarantee members' interests—affiliates naturally became restless. Rivals circled, poaching his share bosses. Suddenly, dozens of shares with 100+ ships departed without notice or refused summons.

Transmigrators hadn't anticipated: "improving their meals" by destroying Gou family triggered southeastern coastal chain reactions. Biggest beneficiary turned out to be their greatest anticipated enemy: Zheng family group. Furious Zhu Cailao immediately dispatched multiple shares to Lingao for intelligence—who dared disturb the tiger?

Soon, short-hair information reached him. He'd heard of them earlier—that strange giant iron ship was recent months' fishing gossip. Gou eldest mentioned these odd short-hairs—self-proclaimed "Australian merchants." He knew their firearms were formidable—local militia completely defeated.

Zhu Cailao had worried about these "Australian pirates"—this era's sea merchants and pirates were identical—appearing in his territory. But after landing, they'd stayed put—neither trading nor raiding. At Lingao, they maintained ambiguous "don't provoke me, I won't provoke you" coexistence. With Zheng family threats, he'd tacitly tolerated short-hairs' presence.

Now Zhu Cailao had two choices. One: immediately muster forces to punish short-hairs, recover wealth, restore reputation. Previously, he'd have unhesitatingly done so. But now with Zheng Zhilong threatening and short-hairs being formidable—mutual destruction would benefit Zheng. Two: ignore it, concentrate on anti-Zheng preparations. Problem: without Gou family's stored resources, he couldn't quickly acquire equivalent supplies.

While deliberating, scouts reported: short-hairs had incredibly fast ships. These ships matched large Guangzhou ships in size. Unmatched speed—faster than any vessel they'd seen, including European sailships. Without sails—couldn't be fire-attacked. Possessing such ships would tremendously advantage his fleet.

Thus Zhu Cailao resolved to attack short-hairs. He dispatched numerous scouts investigating Lingao, also learning from fishermen about transmigrators' fishing hegemony—"fast ships" patrolling daily for poaching. From scouts, he learned:

1. Short-hairs' muskets were extremely accurate—long range, highly lethal, rapid fire.

2. Despite formidable muskets—short-hairs lacked cannons. Even fast ships only mounted strange oversized crossbows.

3. Four fast ships total. Usually only one patrolled fishing grounds; others stayed in harbor—apparently precious. The enormous iron ship remained anchored motionless.

4. Short-hairs numbered roughly 1,000. Real and fake "baldies" existed—indistinguishable quantities. Divided between Bairren Beach and Bopu Harbor. Both were fortified—Bopu was weaker, fewer personnel. Also: former Gou Manor and a "salt village" were their territories.

Zhu Cailao never read military texts or understood strategy and tactics—but possessed sufficient wisdom to judge maximum benefit approaches. Fundamentally a merchant—he understood cost-benefit.

Comprehensive assessment: Zhu Cailao made a wise decision. Don't wage full war against short-hairs. Combat scope limited to capturing "fast ships" to strengthen fleet. If possible, also capture some muskets.

Short-hairs had formidable muskets—but lacked manpower and cannons. These two factors—Zhu Cailao had abundantly. After consulting key subordinates, he dispatched capable lieutenants for ship capture.

Strategy was clever. Under long-term fisherman spy observation, they'd discovered transmigrators' patterns and methods—adopting countermeasures. Use illegal fishing to lure "fast ships" close for inspection. Then use cannons and boarding to clear short-hairs. To avoid damaging fast ships, all cannons loaded grapeshot. Ships even prepared two rope types: thick for towing fast ships; thin for binding captured short-hairs—per orders, treat prisoners well. Fast ships and muskets only worked if captives taught usage.

Everything planned meticulously. Against any ordinary ship, this plan would've succeeded. Fortunately, fishing boats' era-transcending technology and transmigrators' months of combat awareness defeated this perfect plan. The responsible share boss died in battle.

Victory deserved celebration—but danger remained. Nobody knew if Zhu Cailao had follow-up plans. If so, what scale of attack? However Security Group tortured prisoners—they knew nothing more. Captured leaders swore and vowed they only knew ship-capture plans—nothing else.

"Now everyone's busy again." He Ming thoughtfully produced cigarettes—about to light, then stopped. "Sorry—this is ordnance factory. I'm confused." He tapped his forehead.

"No problem—smoke if you want. We're not an explosive plant. Those cannons are just iron lumps—nothing happens."

"Better not break rules." He Ming said. "Tomorrow Committee holds response meeting. All department heads must attend. Bring several Artillery Group people. Current priority is Bopu fortification and naval armament."

"Cannons are no problem—raw material supply is tight." Zhan Wuya said. "Coal is scarce."
