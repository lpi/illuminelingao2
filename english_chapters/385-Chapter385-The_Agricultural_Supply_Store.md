# Chapter 385 - The Agricultural Supply Store

Finally they agreed on using in-kind micro-loans, more convenient to operate and easier for farmers to understand.

Poultry chicks would be provided on credit to farmers—minimum 5, maximum 10. Farmers would sign exclusive purchase agreements for eggs, repaying principal and interest with eggs.

"I propose 20 eggs total per chick for principal and interest—" Ye Yuming said.

"That's practically giving them away! Too few." Wu Nanhai felt shortchanged. "We're not giving farmers newly-hatched chicks—these are 18-week-old mature pullets, raised with considerable labor and resources. And all the laying breeds we brought, whether light-type white-shell layers or medium-type brown-shell layers, average 220-280 eggs annually. Each hen lays for 2-3 years. Even 50 eggs as chick cost feels like a loss."

Ye Yuming said: "At the start of promotion, let's take a loss. Keep it at 20 eggs."

Lingao's so-called middle peasants, rich peasants, and minor landlords all had limited economic capacity. Farmers' frugal, suspicious mentality meant initial promotion must show sufficient profit incentive without conditions too good—farmers wouldn't believe it either.

Wan Lihui agreed with Ye Yuming, saying 50 eggs was actually too many. That annual egg yield was achieved through intensive commercial poultry farming with ample compound feed. Under traditional farming conditions—farmers providing limited, monotonous feed, poultry spending more time foraging—egg yield wouldn't be so high, plus loss and death rates were considerable.

"I think several of those 5-10 chickens dying from various causes is very likely. You may have studied agriculture, but you don't know farmers' hardships." Wan Lihui said. "Rural poultry farming—one mishap and you lose everything. A few chickens mean nothing to modern people, but for farmers here they're probably substantial property."

After extensive discussion, they accepted Ye Yuming's proposal: 20 eggs per chicken as principal and interest for laying hens provided. Repayment due within six months from start of farming.

After principal and interest were repaid, the Heaven and Earth Society would exclusively purchase all eggs and eventually buy back non-laying hens. Everyone agreed that with proper care and no unexpected losses, benefits from this plan were obvious.

"This is also a good opportunity to promote Circulation Voucher use among county farmers." Yan Ming said. After over half a year of issuance, vouchers had established creditworthiness among county merchants, but farmer acceptance of paper currency remained low.

Paying farmers in paper currency for purchases, combined with policies stimulating voucher use at East Gate Market: all transmigrator-operated stores offered 5% discounts for voucher purchases.

Precisely because farmers instinctively distrusted vouchers, once they had vouchers they'd spend them at market—further stimulating circulation and avoiding the hoarding that occurred with metal currency payments, truly letting money circulate.

"We're not promoting—we're practically subsidizing," someone remarked.

"Most countries in the world subsidize agriculture. Otherwise no one would farm anymore." Ye Yuming said. "Consider this our version of agricultural subsidy policy."

"Short-term, we'll take some losses, but building trust with the people first is essential for promotion." Ye Yuming concluded. "With trust as foundation, future Heaven and Earth Society promotions will be easier."

Poultry provided to farmers would initially be only laying hens. Wan Lihui suggested White Leghorns—this light-type white-shell layer breed was already unfashionable in the 21st century, but had characteristics suited for farmer free-range: tolerating rough feed, high conversion efficiency, adept at foraging.

"One more thing: we need to provide feed and technical farming services." Wu Nanhai said. "Not just hand over chickens to farmers—we must follow up!"

Feed issues were especially critical. Free-range methods could greatly reduce chances of chicken plague, but farmers in this time-space obviously wouldn't provide as much feed as 21st-century commercial farmers.

Laying hens required particularly precise compound feed. According to modern animal husbandry, raising layers involved 39 different nutritional indicators. Beyond adequate protein, sufficient fiber and calcium were needed.

"Looking at local farmers, they barely have enough grain for themselves. Can they even afford to raise chickens? Won't the chickens starve?"

Raising chickens required grain. Though farm households traditionally raised chickens to supplement income, scale was universally small.

Wu Nanhai said: "Even if farmers have enough grain, we must provide formula feed—especially protein and calcium. This greatly affects egg production. Otherwise our promotion would be meaningless."

"How do we provide it?"

"Feed loans—also repaid with eggs."

"All these consecutive loans—farmers will be shackled with endless debt..."

"As long as our feed increases production, they should be willing." Wu Nanhai seemed confident. "Farmers used to spend money in town buying manure and household waste, buying soybean cake and peanut cake from workshops... They have investment awareness—they know high inputs bring good harvests. We won't interfere with ordinary feed. We'll specifically provide formula feed—primarily supplementing protein and calcium, plus various nutrients easily deficient in free-range farming."

No one objected. Details would be handled by Agricultural Committee. Lending would be managed by Delong. Internal settlement between Heaven and Earth Society and Delong. The Finance Committee hoped to quickly implement monetary settlement between departments for better financial accounting—rather than hard-to-value in-kind accounts.

As a supporting project, Delong Grain Store would also launch "Farmer-Aid Loans"—small cash loans specifically for farmers to purchase formula feed, folk veterinary medicines, disinfectants, and other agricultural supplies. This would support farmer production while expanding Grain Circulation Voucher circulation.

"I have an idea," Ye Yuming proposed before adjournment. "Lingao is desperately short of iron farm tools—not only poor quality but very expensive, seriously affecting productivity. The Metallurgy Department can't yet fully supply county demand. Can we give Heaven and Earth Society member farmers special discounts? Like promoting new tools at cheaper prices?"

"I think that should be possible." Wu Nanhai nodded, turning to Planning Committee representative Dai Xie. This person had directed materials distribution on D-Day. As institutions matured, he'd kept a lower profile, focusing on Planning Committee administration—mainly project approval and review—frequently appearing at construction sites.

"Approximately how many?"

"Agricultural Committee needs to expand farm workers and replace some worn tools, plus this Heaven and Earth Society promotion..." Wu Nanhai pulled out a notebook from his pocket. "...At least fifty pieces monthly." Apparently fearing outright refusal: "I'll still return damaged tools to the Planning Committee for remelting."

Dai Xie said: "Not a major problem. Current metallurgy daily steel production can support this volume. But tools given to outside farmers will be hard to recover. Factor that loss in..."

"Trade-in program. Have farmers return old ones, pay small price difference, we sell them new ones."

"That should work." Dai Xie agreed.

"Why don't we just open an agricultural supply store?" Wan Lihui had a sudden inspiration, recalling rural agricultural supply dealers got quite wealthy. "New farm tools, formula feed, folk pesticides, crude fertilizers, seeds... So many good products—no shortage of buyers."

Everyone liked the idea. They decided the Heaven and Earth Society would open an agricultural supply store at East Gate Market selling "Heaven and Earth Society" brand agricultural products. Initially, these products would only be available to landlords and small farmers participating in the promotion program—no external sales.

"Besides iron tools and seedlings which can't be widely promoted yet, formula feed, folk pesticides, crude fertilizers... should soon be freely available." Wu Nanhai said.

After the meeting, Yan Ming enthusiastically discussed agricultural supply pricing with Ye Yuming, Dai Xie, and others. The "Farmer-Aid Loans" issued would mainly purchase these products. While they debated pricing, Wu Nanhai headed back to the farm with Wan Lihui.

Wan Lihui asked Wu Nanhai what this "formula feed" would be made from. Wan Lihui knew the farm's grain reserves were rather thin—not much grain for feed-making. They'd have to rely on seafood processing plant scraps: fish bones and scales.

Wu Nanhai entered a special warehouse and emerged with a wooden box: "This is the main component of my formula feed."

"What is this?!"

"Earthworms." Wu Nanhai smiled. "Ever raised them in the countryside?"

"No—" Wan Lihui suddenly understood. "But someone did—mainly supplying commercial chicken farms!"

"Right. Besides earthworms, I'm also planning maggot farming—I haven't done that myself, and we lack enough substrate. Let's start simple with earthworms."

"You're planning to use earthworms as raw material for formula feed."

"Plus some plant-based ingredients, fish-offal powder, and shell powder—all needed by laying hens."

Wu Nanhai's planned main feed formula was: dried earthworm powder, fish-offal powder, shell powder. Without corn—the most common feed grain—he could only produce supplementary formula feed.
