# Chapter 1273: Wu Nanhai's Daily Routine

"good morning, Commissar Wu," the two greeted respectfully.

"Good morning to you too." A particularly gentle smile appeared on Wu Nanhai's face. As he walked inside, he asked, "Old Zhang, I heard your wife is expecting?"

"Yes, yes, thank you for your concern, Chief!" Zhang Xingjiao felt a warmth in his heart. he hadn't expected the Chief to remember his personal matters amidst his busy schedule!

Zhang Xingjiao had only taken a wife last year and bought an apartment from the Agricultural Committee. This poor scholar, whose family had once been broken and decimated, had finally re-established a family and career.

They walked through the corridor in front of Wu's Office. One side of the corridor was entirely glass, allowing a clear view of the scene inside "Wu's Office": an open-plan office where neatly arranged unpainted white wood desks numbered more than twenty, and filing cabinets lined the walls densely.

Many people were already hard at work at their desks in the office. The walls were inlaid with huge blackboards, densely covered with various summaries and notices.

"Send her to the General Hospital for a check-up early. When the baby is born, you must treat me to red eggs..." Wu Nanhai said as he arrived at the door of his office.

"Yes, yes, definitely." Zhang Xingjiao agreed while quickening his steps to open the office door for Wu Nanhai.

Wu Nanhai's office wasn't large, but it had a separate lounge and restroom, with complete facilities. Large windows faced south, providing bright and transparent lighting. There was a staircase at the end of the inner corridor of the office leading directly down to his private side door on the first floor. It also led up to the roof terrace, which was equipped with tables, chairs, and an awning for resting.

Entering the office and taking a seat, he briefly glanced at the non-urgent documents and telephone notifications received by the night duty staff. Confirming there was nothing urgent to handle, Wu Nanhai leaned back in his rattan chair, took out a daily planner from the drawer, and picked up a pencil.

Wang Tian first reported on the farm's production status yesterday. October was the busy season for autumn harvest and planting. The farm managed a lot of land, and Wang Tian had to travel between various fields every day to direct a series of tasks such as autumn, threshing, and storage, keeping him incredibly busy.

He reported on the progress of the autumn harvest and discussed current problems. This harvest used a large number of horse-drawn harvesters, doubling harvesting efficiency. As a result, the storage and transportation bottleneck was immediately exposed. The horse-drawn transport team couldn't transport the rice to the threshing floor in time for processing, so they had to continue organizing transport by shoulder poles, occupying a large amount of manpower.

Improving efficiency in one link would inevitably expose shortcomings in other areas. Wu Nanhai jotted down a few urgent matters in his notebook, made on-site arrangements for things that could be resolved immediately, and then turned his face to Zhang Xingjiao.

Zhang Xingjiao hurriedly opened his file folder and began to report one by one:

"Chief, over at Chief Xun's side—"

"Old Zhang, when reporting work, refer to the department, don't mention names directly," Wu Nanhai reminded.

"Yes, yes, I was negligent," Zhang Xingjiao quickly corrected himself. "The Meat Processing Plant reports that the frozen chicken stock in the cold storage will be exhausted in the next few days. If live chickens are not improved allocation soon, their chicken processing workshop will have to stop production. Chief Xun called to ask if supply can be provided in time? According to the current production speed, the production line can only last until 6 a.m. tomorrow."

Three days ago, an outbreak of chicken plague occurred at the farm's chicken farm. Two thousand chickens originally intended for the Meat Processing Plant had been culled. They were now thrown into a dedicated biogas digester for handling diseased and dead livestock and poultry for fermentation and harmless treatment. Consequently, the supply plan for the Meat Processing Plant was disjointed.

This chicken plague gave Wu Nanhai a headache. Not only did the outbreak occur at the farm's chicken farm, but the mortality rate of chicks at the breeding poultry farm was also slightly high. He couldn't help but suspect signs of large-scale spread. He had already sent someone specifically to investigate this matter.

"Reply to the Meat Processing Plant that it will be difficult to restore supply tomorrow and ask them to readjust their production plan." Wu Nanhai had already received a report from the Agricultural Committee's Livestock and Poultry Production Division. There were very few live chickens available for slaughter in the past few days, making it impossible to maintain normal supply. He looked at his notebook, "It is estimated that half of the original planned daily supply volume can be restored by October 25th. Normal supply will resume in early November."

"Chief, this is the construction plan for the Breeding Poultry Farm of the Agricultural Committee's directly managed farm in Qiongzhou. If there are no further issues, please sign it."

"Has the Biochemical Laboratory done the epidemic prevention measure assessment?"

"It's been done, it's in Appendix 4."

He looked at the assessment; it was written by Huang Dashan. Then he took a dedicated dip pen from the inkwell stand and signed his name neatly properly.

"This is the sample of the agricultural persuasion New Year painting sent by the Printing House. Please review it." Zhang Xingjiao took out several samples of New Year paintings.

Agricultural persuasion New Year paintings were now the Printing House's flagship product. Not only was the external sales volume huge, but domestic demand was also very large. In ancient times when information dissemination was not developed, the promotional effect of a New Year painting was the most penetrating among all publicity for ordinary people. After all, very few people could read, but many could understand pictures. Therefore, using New Year paintings to promote the "Australian lifestyle" and new production technologies became a very effective method.

Unlike export New Year paintings which mainly promoted various "Australian lifestyles" and "Australian goods," domestic New Year paintings, besides political propaganda, had two other focuses: popular science and the promotion of agricultural technology. Printing new technologies and new concepts on New Year paintings for promotion had proven to be one of the most effective methods in recent years. So the Agricultural Committee also had to be responsible for providing and reviewing the content of agricultural persuasion New Year paintings.

The New Year paintings were drawn by Senators in the fine arts field. Some were original, while others were redrawn using materials from the Great Library.

Wu Nanhai took the sample album of New Year paintings and roughly looked at the content. A total of twenty themes were prepared for the new agricultural persuasion New Year paintings expected to be published and distributed in 1633, all printed with woodblock color printing: "Promote Pest and Disease Control, Win High Agricultural Yields," "Scientific Manure Collection," "Planting Green Manure is Good," "Courtyard Economy Brings Great Profits," "Rice Field Aquaculture," "Don't Waste an Inch of Land, Promote Ten-Edge Planting," "Planting Castor Beans to Contribute to National Industrialization"...

Compared to this year's New Year paintings, this batch had improved significantly in both color and composition. Wu Nanhai nodded: "No problem. Tell the Propaganda Department we want 3,000 copies of the first batch, all sent to Tiandihui."

"This is the Jeju Horse Farm report sent by Chief Nick. He requests that another team of veterinarians and livestock major students be sent to Jeju Island as soon as possible, numbering no less than twenty, along with a list of required medicines and equipment."

Frowning, Wu Nanhai took Nick's report—whenever Nick made a report, it was always to ask for goods and people voraciously. But horse administration was extremely critical—moreover, the Agricultural Committee now relied heavily on the horse supply from Jeju Island: the Agricultural Committee had used the transported horses to form horse-plowing teams. Large agricultural machinery, which was originally limited by the number of horses and couldn't be widely used, had also been promoted. After all, horse-plowing teams were much safer and easier to use than the First Agricultural Reclamation Mobile Regiment under Bai Yu, which was slow and prone to boiler explosions sending shrapnel and rivets flying.

He commented as he read: "Twenty people? Easier said than done. There are only twenty students in this veterinary class in total. If I send them all there, what about other places? This list..." It listed dozens of medicines and medical instruments, some of which were controlled materials.

Wu Nanhai deliberated for a long time, scratching out some rare medicines with his pen and halving the numbers for others. Then he annotated after the list of veterinary medicines that could be produced in-house: Please try to satisfy the quantity. He check to satisfy quantity. took out the department stamp from the drawer. After stamping and signing, he handed it to Zhang Xingjiao: "Immediately tell the Copying Room to make 3 copies. One for the Archives for record, one sent to the Ministry of Health so they can prepare as much as possible according to the list first. You personally deliver the original to the Planning Commission and ask Chief Wu to sign it for you."

With various problems and reports, the morning passed unconsciously. Since the ruled area expanded to the whole of Hainan Island, various administrative tasks occupied most of Wu Nanhai's time. When Chuqing entered the office carrying a lunch box, Wu Nanhai was on the phone with Wu De discussing the labor force number for water conservancy projects.

"...I know the Wenlan River regulation project is the big picture, I'm not asking for special treatment. But our demonstration farm's water conservancy project is also very crucial, especially for typhoon prevention... Yes, I know there are few typhoons after October, but we must complete the water conservancy renovation before the rainy season arrives next year. You experienced last year's typhoon too. Now all the land on both banks of the Wenlan River belongs to us. If seawater pours back in or floods submerge the fields again, the loss will be our own. Once grain production decreases, the consequences are something we cannot accept right now.

"300 people is too few. At the current rate, it won't be finished until the end of next year. I need a workload of at least 500 people per day. I want to strive to finish it by the end of June next year."

"Labor reform teams are fine too, this isn't some high-tech work. Give me another 50 soldiers.

"You have to send supervisors to me, otherwise who will catch them if they run away. 10 soldiers will do—as long as they have guns.

"Mm, mm, okay, that's settled. I'll send someone to handle the procedures this afternoon."

"Eat first, it won't taste good when it gets cold." Chuqing said as she opened the three-tier stainless steel lunch box—a Wenzhou product from another spacetime. She took out today's lunch: fried rice noodles with seafood miso soup. High-quality thin dried sweet potato noodles, stir-fried with lard, dried shrimp, broad beans, and shiitake mushrooms. The miso soup contained shrimp meat, tofu, and kelp. Simple and delicious. Very suitable for a working lunch.

"There's the opening ceremony of the First Fertilizer Plant this afternoon, are you still going?" Chuqing still kept the habit from when she was his life secretary, using honorifics in her language.

"Going, of course I'm going." Wu Nanhai took a sip of miso soup, "It wasn't easy to secure this project. If I don't go, it would be too disrespectful to the Planning Commission and the Administration Council. I have to at least show my face."
