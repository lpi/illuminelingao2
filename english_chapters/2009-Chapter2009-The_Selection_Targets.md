# Chapter 2009 - The Selection Targets

She turned around and addressed Lu Weijia: "Send a messenger to the Municipal Political Security Bureau. Tell them there's a reactionary element here engaging in inciting propaganda!"

Mao Xiuyu, being a retained employee, didn't quite understand what this meant. But Lu Weijia and the observing Du Yibin knew this woman was preparing to play hardball.

Lu Weijia had half a mind to say something—once at the Political Security Bureau, a mere caning wouldn't settle things. Even if the investigation ultimately found "no evidence," she'd still be skinned alive. But Lu Cheng was the Director of the Municipal Women's Federation, only "stationed" at the Jiliang Institute. Her administrative rank was far higher than his.

Besides, he'd experienced Bian Cuibao's brazenness firsthand on ordinary days. He thought giving this woman a lesson might be good. So he said nothing.

Mao Xiuyu was a retained employee who kept his tail between his legs. Naturally, all he could do was agree with everything—he certainly didn't dare voice objections.

Two police officers from the institute came over. Each grabbed one of Bian Cuibao's arms and twisted them behind her back, making her cry out in pain. Both officers were retained personnel from the old fast squad—binding people was a family trade. In three moves, they had Bian Cuibao trussed up like a rice dumpling and hauled away. The workshop instantly fell silent, not even a cough to be heard.

Du Yibin frowned, feeling this had gone too far. Bian Cuibao's behavior certainly deserved severe punishment, but using such trumped-up serious charges to deal with her wasn't appropriate either.

He was inclined to intervene, but on second thought, right now he had to stand with Lu Cheng and properly intimidate these female students whose thinking hadn't yet transformed. If he stopped it, these former prostitutes would become even more unbridled. Setting aside whether they were even qualified to marry naturalized citizens, even if they did—disabled or not—wouldn't they be bullied to death? Then the naturalized citizens would certainly blame the Elders and the Council. That was a blame he absolutely couldn't accept.

After leaving the workshop, Du Yibin finally said: "You did well, but let's not bother the Political Security Bureau with this matter."

Lu Cheng had originally planned to use this to build a case, labeling Bian Cuibao a "reactionary element" to thoroughly crush the unhealthy atmosphere at the Jiliang Institute. However, since the Elder had spoken, she naturally couldn't argue. She went along with it: "I was just trying to scare them—troubling the investigators over something this small wouldn't be right."

"You're correct," Du Yibin said. "Our main principle should be treating and saving people. No matter how shameless she is, she hasn't actually done anything harmful to society. Besides, keeping her around might be useful. You can put her in solitary, but you can't keep her tied up for ten days. Half a day would be about right—any longer and problems could occur..."

"They all know this," Lu Cheng found this Elder Du quite long-winded. "The few police officers at the institute are all old hands. They'll tie her up for a while and let her suffer a bit, so she doesn't think our humanitarian approach means we're pushovers."

Du Yibin felt the Jiliang Institute's atmosphere was quite poor, making him somewhat hesitant about the next steps. But it was patently obvious that the "students" here were currently the most usable marriage resource. If he gave up now, everything that followed would be impossible.

"What do you think—are there many of Bian Cuibao's type... um..."

"Female toughs." Mao Xiuyu, seeing him struggling for a descriptor, quickly supplied one.

"Right, female toughs. Are there many students of this type?"

"Actually, not many." Lu Cheng said. "But their influence among the students is considerable. We've also promoted some fast-progressing role models, but their influence doesn't match that of people like Bian Cuibao! These female toughs have quite a bit of prestige in here!"

Du Yibin then asked: "What about the ordinary majority?"

"Most students are mainly worried about their future." Lu Cheng said. "They're truly a pitiful bunch. Almost all were sold here. Their parents and families are either dead or whereabouts unknown. After years in the brothels, beaten and humiliated with barely any savings. So what worries them most is 'what happens next.' Unfortunately, this matter..." Lu Cheng had actually had issues with the arrangement of prostitutes' futures. Because up to now, Civil Affairs had only issued vague instructions to the Jiliang Institute: "Reform body and mind, cultivate appropriate labor skills. Prepare for returning to normal society." Not a word about specific resettlement.

This put Lu Cheng and the other cadres working at the Jiliang Institute in a very passive position. The prostitute "students" were different from the "widows." The "widows" had always lived in Qingjie Hall, working to support themselves. As long as Qingjie Hall didn't close its doors, they'd always have food to eat. They didn't need to think about "future prospects." But the students were no longer prostitutes and had no family to rely on. They'd have to support themselves going forward, yet Civil Affairs hadn't even indicated a direction for their futures. They couldn't even paint rosy pictures. This was also one reason for the consistently poor atmosphere at the Jiliang Institute.

Lu Cheng explained her thoughts to Du Yibin, then added: "...Currently we just tell them to work, but don't let them move about freely. It's almost like being prisoners. These students have no home to go to, don't know what we're going to do with them—they're all quite anxious. Rumors fly everywhere. Some say we're going to sell them to foreigners for money. Others say we're going to send them all to uninhabited overseas islands to clear land and farm... Actually, even if we told them they'd be sent to Lingao and assigned as wives to workers and soldiers, that would be something. At least give them something to hope for..."

"Wait, you say they'd be willing to be soldiers' wives?" Du Yibin suddenly perked up.

"Yes," Lu Cheng was somewhat puzzled. "Actually it's not just soldiers, but also police, our cadres and workers... They all think those men are quite good—well-dressed, neat and clean. And they earn money. They all say it would be nice to marry such a man."

"That's right," Mao Xiuyu chimed in. "Take our Council of Elders' people—every one of them is impressive and can earn money to support a family. Never mind a few prosti—students, even the 'widows' have gotten ideas!"

Du Yibin had heard that the prostitute students were "lazy and work-shy," which had worried him. He'd thought these people had high standards and wouldn't be willing to marry naturalized citizens. He hadn't expected their requirements to actually be quite modest. He remembered what Wang Jun had said about "marrying a man means food and clothes," and couldn't help a wry smile—he'd again substituted twenty-first-century standards in his thinking.

"Actually, I also came today to solve this problem." Du Yibin felt much better now. "Let's go. We'll talk in the office."

In the office, Du Yibin gave a general explanation of the "Naturalized Citizens' Marriage Proposal." Only then did the three understand why this Elder Du had ignored everything else upon arriving at the shelter, only looking at the women. So there was such a story behind it!

Lu Cheng and the others were naturally pleased. Mao Xiuyu in particular felt warmed: these Australians were truly good people! They even cared about widows and the disabled! He hurried to say: "Elder, this is wonderful news. Never mind these students—even the single women will be endlessly grateful..."

"I've explained the matter, but there are still some issues here." Du Yibin said. "Because this proposal's main purpose is to solve the marriage problems of disabled naturalized soldiers and workers, the selection must be handled carefully. They're all people who've sacrificed for the Council of Elders, and their bodies are inconvenient. The Council can't let them down. So we must find them women who are careful, kind, and capable."

"Yes, we'll select carefully." Lu Cheng immediately promised.

"First select a group of people from the former students and widows. Make a list for me. I'll give you three days. Specific requirements: under forty, healthy, hardworking. Only such people are qualified to marry naturalized citizens," Du Yibin said. "As for people like Bian Cuibao, let them undergo more reform. As for other fence-sitters, you can decide in your own meetings whether to include them or not. The main thing is they must be politically sound."

"We understand. We'll definitely complete the task!"

After Du Yibin gave his instructions and left, Lu Cheng and the others found themselves shouldering a burden. Each felt somewhat worried. Selecting wives for naturalized citizens was certainly excellent. But if they chose wrong and problems arose after marriage, they—the ones responsible for making the list—would be held accountable.

The three brought out all the files. They also had the reward and punishment records, work logs brought over. Students plus single women totaled close to eight hundred people. Nobody had a good enough memory to remember each person's specific situation.

"I think we shouldn't select wives for disabled naturalized citizens from the students... They should all come from the widows." Mao Xiuyu, breaking his usual habit of not speaking unless asked at meetings, proactively made a suggestion.

"Why?"

"Didn't the Elder just say? Disabled naturalized citizens suffered for the Council of Elders, and the Council can't let them down. Those words carry weight—we can't afford any mistakes in our selection." Mao Xiuyu said unhurriedly. "The students are all from low-class brothels—you probably don't know, but anyone who's survived in such places is no ordinary person..."

Lu Cheng and Lu Weijia both deeply agreed.

"...Though these past months you two Directors have worked hard to educate them on 'self-reliance and starting fresh,' habits formed over so many years in such places can't be changed that easily. Ordinary men might be able to control them, but disabled men would be at their mercy. Besides, who willingly marries a disabled man? When regret sets in and they start causing trouble, things could get ugly. They might even cause deaths!"

"You're right." Lu Weijia was a military man and knew that among disabled veterans, many had missing limbs and could only barely manage daily life. "Women like that won't do!"

"Furthermore, disabled naturalized citizens are people who've rendered service to the Elders. Though their bodies are damaged, they can't be given wives who were prostitutes. Even if such a wife is virtuous, it doesn't sound good and invites gossip—it would harm the Council of Elders' benevolent reputation."
