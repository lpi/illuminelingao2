# Chapter 301 - Sweet Port Crisis: The Beginning of the Rout

"It's nothing. I make a little money each day writing letters for people at the county yamen. If things get truly desperate, I still have my cousin—" At this, his cheeks flushed slightly. "—we're engaged. My uncle and aunt aren't mercenary people. They can always spare a few meals."

Chen Tianxiong smiled faintly and thought he might as well give the young man a small mirror as a token of gratitude.

Returning to Huanan Sugar, Chen Tianxiong made further arrangements, particularly sending someone into the city to keep an eye on Lin Zhuang—to see whether he was dissolute enough to completely abandon all restraint. If Lin Zhuang simply took the silver and continued his drunken debauchery at a brothel, the plan would need adjustment. Word came back quickly: Lin Zhuang had left the county seat and returned to Monk Zou's Temple.

"Old Chen, why do you insist on winning over Lin Zhuang?" Wen Tong asked.

"He's the head of the sugar refinery workers. He has at least some influence," Chen Tianxiong said. "If only our people go to persuade them, it will have some effect, but his word carries more weight."

"And if he keeps stalling? Refuses to help?"

"Then he gives us no choice." Chen Tianxiong was prepared for this. "He handed over his ledger for us to copy—that's the same as giving us the rope to hang him with. With this—" He waved the copied list. "He can't deny anything even if he wants to."

"Clever indeed," Wen Tong said with genuine admiration. "How did you get him to take the bait?"

"It's all thanks to the twenty percent cut on the settlement fees. Money blinds men's eyes." Chen Tianxiong said. "The moment I dangled the settlement allowance in front of him, he lost all restraint."

"Even the settlement money has a kickback scheme? This world is truly dark," Wen Tong sighed. "By the way, Chang Shide is back."

"I didn't see him?"

"He's in Lingao, preparing to execute the mission." Wen Tong explained the specific plan the Executive Committee and Huanan had developed to deal with the pirates. "The Navy wants us to gather more intelligence on these pirates—root them out entirely to avoid future troubles."

"I understand." In truth, Chen Tianxiong had no leads on this matter, but where there was a will, there was a way. Intelligence work depended on legwork. "But right now we need to focus on the 'pacification' effort. What did Wu De say about our request?"

Such large-scale matters involving the absorption of local natives were now under the jurisdiction of the Civil Affairs Committee—essentially, Wu De's domain.

"Wu De approved it, but he wants us to submit a report on how to arrange this labor force," Wen Tong said. "Should they be settled locally, or transferred to Lingao?"

"What's your view?" On this question, Chen Tianxiong had his own opinions, but Wen Tong was managing the Leizhou situation and naturally understood the local labor needs better.

"Local settlement, of course." Wen Tong had grand plans. The distillery would soon be operational and needed workers. The comprehensive processing of sugar industry waste would also require many hands. Absorbing this labor would pose no problem.

"That's my thinking as well. Most of them are locals from Leizhou and Xuwen. Forcing them to relocate to Lingao might breed resentment."

"There's also the question of their families."

"The factory can't accommodate everyone immediately, but their wages should be enough to support their dependents." Wen Tong said. "I plan to pay half in coin and half in rice—rice prices are high here, so using the Vietnamese rice that Chang Shide ships in is more economical. Once the enterprise expands, we can gradually employ family members as well."

This was indeed a good approach. After Chang Shide established the maritime rice-sugar trade route between Xuwen and Vietnam, Huanan effectively had access to a vast granary.

Even so, once the "pacification" was complete, feeding nearly a thousand people would become Huanan's responsibility. Before, no one had cared for them, but once they had a master, any mishap could spark unrest.

"Food is easy to solve—Chang Shide has brought rice; there's enough for any amount." Chen Tianxiong said. "If there's a delay, we can have Dachang Rice Shop advance some."

"They'll need settlement fees too," Wen Tong said. "One foreign silver dollar per worker at minimum."

"Naturally. It's a show of our sincerity."

"But we can't let Lin Zhuang distribute the money. He's too greedy—he'd pocket at least half. We can't be taken for fools."

"Of course. Winning hearts is our prerogative." Chen Tianxiong smiled coldly. "I'm more afraid he'll abscond with everything."

They calculated the approximate amounts of silver and grain needed, how to arrange the workers, and documented every detail.

"So when will you carry out the 'pacification'?"

"That depends on Lin Zhuang's awareness. But if he truly lacks awareness, we'll simply force the issue." Chen Tianxiong said. "For now, it seems Xiao Zhanfeng was right that the incense ceremony won't lead to trouble. But we still need to guard against his betrayal."

After Chen Tianxiong left, Lin Zhuang found his courage bolstered by the silver in his pocket. He had originally planned to linger another day at Madam Ai's establishment, but thinking of the complex situation—both Huanan and the Haiyi Guild were watching him—his value had indeed increased, with the advantage of playing both sides. But how could he maintain this "one foot in each boat" arrangement? That would require considerable scheming. Though reluctant, he hurried away from Madam Ai's and headed back.

On the way, he first stopped at the rice shop and used the few taels of loose silver to buy old rice, instructing them to deliver it to Monk Zou's Temple. He was a regular customer here, so the shop naturally complied.

Then he visited a money shop and deposited the intact silver ingots that Chen Tianxiong had given him. He hurried back to Monk Zou's Temple. He had a room there—arranged by Master Zhu at the temple's expense. A bachelor and a down-on-his-luck drifter, money slipped through his fingers the moment he touched it. Usually, he hung around the sugar refineries; he had no proper furnishings, just a bamboo bed and a few ragged clothes—nothing worth stealing. Returning to the temple, he ignored everyone, went straight to his room, closed the door, lay on his bed, and began to deliberate.

Straddling two boats and playing both sides was well and good, but it couldn't last forever. Sooner or later, he would have to choose: the Haiyi Guild or Huanan.

On this point, Lin Zhuang felt no inner conflict. In his view, Huanan was ultimately an outsider. No matter how capable they were, they couldn't defeat the deeply entrenched Haiyi Guild—at best, the two sides would eventually negotiate a truce. Siding with the Haiyi Guild was the safe bet.

But Huanan was far more generous than Master Zhu. That Manager Chen he had met today—fifty taels on the spot! Master Zhu had never shown such munificence. Lin Zhuang couldn't help but sigh. If only their positions could be swapped, he would devote himself heart and soul to Manager Chen.

What made his mouth water most was the five hundred "Double Column" silver dollars. Such a large sum—Lin Zhuang had never seen anything like it. He schemed about how to get his hands on that money—or at least a portion.

The incense-burning oath couldn't be delayed any further. He had already decided on this. Any more delay would leave him with nothing to tell Master Zhu. Master Zhu expected him to use the ceremony to incite unrest; failing to incite unrest was already a concession, but if he couldn't even go through the motions, he would have no future prospects.

The problem was that once he took the oath, he would be violating his promise to Huanan. If they flew into a rage, crushing him would be effortless. He couldn't afford not to guard against this.

He was still calculating whether there was some way to placate both sides when someone knocked on the door: "Brother Lin!"

He recognized the voice—Ma Sanqiang, one of the leaders among the unemployed workers, a man from Qinzhou with considerable influence among the Qinzhou-native workers. Lin Zhuang felt he had to show him some courtesy.

He quickly rose and opened the door, inviting Ma Sanqiang inside.

"Brother Lin!" Ma Sanqiang came straight to the point. "Someone just delivered rice, but it's aged rice again. How are we supposed to eat this?"

"Since when can't you eat aged rice?" Lin Zhuang knew he was here to complain about this again and was greatly displeased—one of his main reasons for staying at the brothel was to avoid these people. Even destitute enough to sleep in a temple, they still picked at everything.

Seeing his indifferent attitude, Ma Sanqiang trembled with anger. "Can we eat it? You try eating it!" He opened a cloth bundle, revealing rice that was broken beyond recognition, much of it discolored, blackened, and yellowed, full of chaff and sand. It hardly qualified as rice—more like sweepings from the warehouse floor.

Lin Zhuang felt a twinge of guilt. The silver he had spent on rice was only a little over three taels, and he had told the shop to "buy as much as possible, the more the better"—naturally, they had sold him the cheapest rice available. The final price was three *qian* per *shi*, but he hadn't expected the quality to be this abysmal! This was barely fit for pigs.

"It's still rice," he said stubbornly. "It fills the stomach. We can't be picky now."

"This isn't about being picky! This stuff is worse than eating chaff." Ma Sanqiang had noticed that Lin Zhuang never ate at the temple, and though he dressed in rags, he hadn't lost weight—in fact, he had gained some. This had long irked him.

Lin Zhuang instead steadied himself, spreading his hands: "What can I do? Master Zhu only gives this much money. I'm no rich man—I can't conjure silver from thin air. Fine rice is two taels per *shi*. How can we feed this many people?"

This argument was hard to refute. Although Ma Sanqiang strongly suspected Lin Zhuang was skimming for himself, he had no proof and couldn't speak too forcefully.

"I don't believe Master Zhu would only give this little? Is this how you do a good deed?"

"Master Zhu was never doing this to be charitable—" Lin Zhuang started to say, then realized how bad this would sound if it reached Master Zhu's ears. He quickly amended: "What I mean is, Master Zhu's aid to everyone is already a great kindness. There should be some repayment! When I asked you all to strike at Huanan, everyone hemmed and hawed—" Feeling his argument was now justified, his voice rose three notches. "How am I supposed to explain myself to Master Zhu?!"

"I won't do anything illegal," Ma Sanqiang's stance hardened as well. "Let me tell you straight—someone's already offered me work at Huanan. I remembered that we all banded together to file our petition, so I didn't want to undermine the group for the sake of a full belly, and I refused. Now I see it was pointless." He cupped his fists in salute. "Brother Lin, take care of yourself!" With that, he strode out.

Lin Zhuang was thunderstruck. "Someone offered him work at Huanan"—the words echoed in his mind. Manager Chen had clearly said he wanted Lin Zhuang's help with the "pacification"—so why had Huanan already extended its reach here? He rushed out after him. In the courtyard, Ma Sanqiang and the group of fellow villagers who usually gathered around him were all packing their belongings.

"Sanqiang, let's talk this over!" He grabbed Ma Sanqiang's hand. "Come back, let's discuss this. Don't undermine everyone!" He lowered his voice. "Help me keep things together, and I'll make it worth your while!"

A look of disgust crossed Ma Sanqiang's face. He said loudly: "I don't want it. Keep your money for yourself! I, Ma Sanqiang, earn my living honestly through hard work. I don't touch money of dubious origin!" He waved his hand. "Let's go!"

More than a dozen Qinzhou workers followed him out. Lin Zhuang stamped his feet in frustration, but he knew there was no stopping them. Seeing the other workers and their families whispering among themselves, their spirits unsettled, Lin Zhuang cursed silently—Manager Chen, you're too ruthless! Huanan must have had people working among the laborers all along!

"Master Lin," a sugar-boiling craftsman sidled up to him quietly, "lately some people who used to work at the refineries have been coming around, probably Huanan's people…"

"Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

"You're never around. Where was I supposed to find you?" The man was displeased, complaining. "You don't care about what happens here at all!"

Lin Zhuang had no response. He realized Chen Tianxiong had checkmated him; if he cooperated with the "pacification," fine—but if he tried any tricks, Chen had already prepared to undercut him completely. In one stroke, his dream of playing both sides was shattered.

He gritted his teeth: Manager Chen, you started this; don't blame me for what comes next. He resolved to proceed with the incense-burning ceremony as planned—it was only a day away. That evening, he summoned the more influential sugar refinery workers for a meeting. But to his surprise, their attitudes had changed dramatically.

Among the unemployed workers, those most eager to riot and smash Huanan were the sugar-boiling masters. Yet these men were unwilling to act themselves—while they bore the greatest resentment toward Huanan, their past wages had been higher, leaving them with some savings. They weren't as desperate as the other workers and didn't want trouble for themselves.

As for the ordinary laborers who had nothing, they had previously been the angriest, unanimous in their opposition to Huanan, ready at any moment to go on a rampage. But now things had changed—word had spread that Huanan was willing to hire them as workers. With a glimmer of hope, naturally no one was willing to commit such illegal acts. No matter how Lin Zhuang agitated, they cited concerns about breaking the law and the consequences; others lamented that their families had long been starving, and if they were thrown in jail, their families would surely perish. Some even proposed outright that everyone go work for Huanan.
