# Chapter 20: The Conference — Machinery and Chemical Industry

The discussion turned to machinery manufacturing—Director Wen's specialty. This topic centered on what equipment to bring. Zhan Wuya had contributed a small machine shop; he reported on available equipment.

"Can this equipment produce the specialized machinery we need? For instance, boilers?"

"In theory, absolutely. My little factory doesn't have much equipment, but with the right materials, we can fabricate most general mechanical equipment. Of course, we mainly process parts for clients; we haven't done complex complete systems. Some small parts we don't make—" Zhan Wuya scratched his head; he wasn't used to fielding questions from the podium. "Standard components, for example—things like screws, bolts, washers. Best made with dedicated equipment.

"Of course, we can make those too—just more trouble. We could build specialized machines for standard parts.

"Then there are castings, gears, and bearings—not things a small shop can make. They require specialized equipment; some need heat treatment, electroplating. I don't know much about that—we usually buy ready-made parts or outsource."

"But gears and bearings are extremely useful. If we can't make them, equipment manufacturing is a dead end."

"Then bring specialized equipment. For gears, a hobbing machine. Bearings are more difficult..."

"A complete bearing-factory setup would probably cost over ten million."

"Ten million is one thing—where do you find enough skilled workers to operate it?"

"We'll have to improvise. Maximize existing equipment; full-scale specialized equipment is too big an investment."

"Heat-treatment furnaces are needed for materials. Bearing cages and ball installation can be done by hand; fixing with a punch press."

...

The discussion grew complex. After much murmuring, the Industry Group's deliberations subsided. Apparently, they had reached consensus on gear and bearing manufacturing. Someone began writing a list—Xiao Zishan guessed it was an equipment checklist.

Wen Desi spoke: "I propose that, for parts standardization, we skip shearing and bending machines—extra punch presses can substitute. Let's bring as many cutting tools and grinding wheels as possible. Also, the machine shop lacks a milling machine and heat-treatment furnace—we need those."

"For completeness, we also need a broaching machine and a boring machine. And more lathes." Jiang Ye, who had worked eight years as a lathe operator, spoke up. "After all, the lathe is the most basic machining equipment."

"How about eight lathes?"

"Too few. Make it twelve. They're extremely useful."

"What about forging presses? Can't do without those."

...

While the machinery discussion raged, many people began yawning. But bound by the rule against leaving before an item concluded, they started their own discussions, and the room filled with buzz.

Wang Luobin suddenly stood up—without asking permission. The machinists had completely ignored the moderator. "We also need a small foundry—don't forget that. If we're going to make engines, it's essential. A single-cylinder diesel engine is practically universal: it can plow and transplant rice, power boats, generate electricity in the mountains, and haul people and cargo on roads."

"Small engines aren't a problem. A typical single-cylinder agricultural engine can use cast iron. HT250 will do: good vibration absorption, good casting flow, easy to machine."

"Speaking of casting—mold-making is an issue. That's a specialized trade. Having equipment doesn't mean you can make good products; you need molds. Modern mold-making equipment is insane: 3D modeling, electrical discharge machining... This is a problem."

"Not that exaggerated. You're talking about now. In the past, process designers would design and draw blueprints, machine the parts, and fitters would assemble—fitter skill was crucial."

...

Gradually, the machinery discussion subsided. The Industry Group had used a lot of paper; they seemed fairly confident. Wen Desi saw Engineer Wang scribbling enthusiastically and worried the procurement list might be too long.

"I'm Ji Situi." A man with a full beard stood up. Despite the facial hair, his face was baby-like. "I represent the Chemical Group in lodging a strong protest." He emphasized "Chemical Group" with weight. "Chemical industry is extremely important—how can it be lumped indiscriminately into Industry? They're all machinists. We have nothing in common!"

"The grouping issue can be discussed later. First, your views on chemical industry."

"Three acids, two alkalis. That's our goal—solving production of these substances.

"Let me give some basic knowledge. The chemical industry we're discussing is heavy chemical industry—the foundation of all chemical industry."

Now it was the machinery people's turn to yawn, though most still watched with interest.

"Chemical industry is the most versatile sector. Chemical products are rarely end products; they're mainly utilized by other industries. Sulfuric acid for fertilizer, soda ash for glass manufacturing, synthetic ammonia for explosives and fertilizer. If we can solve these basic heavy-chemical products, we solve many manufacturing problems.

"Do you know how much your daily life depends on chemical industry? You don't—that's why you lumped chemistry with machinery!" He shook his head. "Tragic!"

"Skip the lamentations. Stick to the facts."

"Our fundamental chemical equipment needs include a synthetic-ammonia-cum-combined-soda-process system and a coal-tar chemical system. These two sets will roughly meet our basic needs—especially the synthetic-ammonia unit."

"What's coal-tar chemical equipment?"

"A coking furnace?"

"No. Simply put, integrated equipment for manufacturing various chemical products from coal tar. It can produce sulfuric acid, phenol, aniline, dyes—and sulfonamide."

"Sulfonamide is very useful—that gives us antibiotics."

"Output won't be high, but should suffice for general use."

"Synthetic ammonia—for fertilizer?"

"Extremely useful. In short: without synthetic ammonia, we can't produce nitric acid.

"Without nitric acid, we can't produce explosives.

"And the fertilizer industry's dependence on synthetic ammonia is even greater."

"Besides complete systems, we should prepare backup chemical equipment: synthesis towers, absorption towers, carbon-removal towers, distillation towers, saturated-hot-water towers, various reaction kettles, pressure-resistant piping, acid pumps, heaters... I'd estimate 500–600 tons of materials."

"Can't we produce these ourselves? Our machinery industry is fairly complete."

"Materials issue," said Ji Situi. "Unless we can quickly produce stainless steel, polyethylene, and such materials, producing chemical equipment domestically within ten years will be very difficult."

"What about glass and ceramics? The Eighth Route Army made sulfuric acid using water urns as reaction towers. And many Great Leap Forward improvised equipment used these materials." Luo Duo spoke up again.

"I'm not sure about that. If we can procure modern equipment, there's no need for improvised methods. Production efficiency would be much higher. And the working environment is better. If any of you want to make sulfuric acid using water urns, think about your teeth."

"I'd like to ask: once we have this equipment, can we establish an organic-chemical industry?"

"That... will be very difficult." Ji Situi thought: *You people are really reaching for the stars.* Organic chemistry wasn't that easy.

"So no nylon and no synthetic rubber." Someone lamented.

"What do you need nylon for—stockings?" Someone teased.

"Sheer black, sheer nude... can't live without either."

When trolling took over, Xiao Zishan had to quash their creativity and bring them back on topic.

"Rubber trees take eleven years before you can tap them, but there are many uses for rubber."

"We're not making condoms—why must we have rubber?"

This drew another round of laughter, and the meeting again descended into free-flowing discussion.

Xiao Zishan finally managed to restore order.

"I assume you want organic chemistry for plastics," Ji Situi addressed the questioner, who nodded. "Plastics are our most common household material, but they involve complex organic chemistry. We probably can't produce them—it's not just raw materials. However, we can make celluloid and Bakelite."

"Bakelite is very useful."

"If we're building an electrical system, Bakelite is very useful—though rubber would be too..."

"Let's have Agriculture address rubber later."
