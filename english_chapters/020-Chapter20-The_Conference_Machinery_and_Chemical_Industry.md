# Chapter 20: The Conference — Machinery and Chemical Industry

The discussion turned to machinery manufacturing—Director Wen's specialty. This topic centered on what equipment to bring. Zhan Wuya had already contributed a small machine shop; he reported on the types of equipment available.

"Can this equipment produce the specialized machinery we need? For instance, boilers?"

"In theory, absolutely. Take my little factory—we don't have much equipment, but with the right materials, we can fabricate most general mechanical equipment. Of course, my shop mainly processes various parts for clients; we haven't done complex complete systems. Some small parts we don't make at all—" Zhan Wuya scratched his head; he wasn't used to standing at the podium fielding questions. "For example, standard components—oh—" He realized many didn't know what standard components were, so he explained: "These are fastening parts like screws, bolts, and washers. Best made with dedicated equipment.

"Of course, we can make those too—just more trouble. We could build specialized machines to manufacture these standard parts.

"Then there are things like castings, gears, and bearings—not things a small shop like ours can make. They require specialized equipment; some need heat treatment, electroplating. I don't know much about that—we usually just buy ready-made parts or outsource."

"But gears and bearings are extremely useful. If we can't make them, equipment manufacturing is a dead end."

"Then bring specialized equipment. For gears, we could use a hobbing machine. Bearings are more difficult..."

"A complete bearing-factory setup would probably cost over ten million."

"Ten million is one thing—where do you find enough skilled workers to operate it?"

"We'll have to improvise. We should maximize use of existing equipment; full-scale specialized equipment is too big an investment."

"Heat-treatment furnaces are needed for materials. Bearing cages and ball installation can be done by hand; fixing can be done with a punch press."

...

The discussion grew complex. After much murmuring, the Industry Group's deliberations subsided. Apparently, they had reached consensus on gear and bearing manufacturing methods and equipment. Someone began writing a list—Xiao Zishan guessed it was an equipment checklist.

At this point, Wen Desi spoke: "I propose that, for parts standardization, we skip shearing and bending machines—a few extra punch presses can substitute. Let's bring as many cutting tools and grinding wheels as possible. Also, the machine shop lacks a milling machine and heat-treatment furnace—we need those."

"For completeness, we also need a broaching machine and a boring machine. And we should have more lathes." Jiang Ye, who had worked eight years as a lathe operator, spoke up. "After all, the lathe is the most basic machining equipment."

"How about eight lathes?"

"Too few. Make it twelve. They're extremely useful."

"What about forging presses? Can't do without those."

...

While the machinery discussion raged, many people began yawning. But bound by the rule against leaving before an agenda item concluded, they started their own group discussions, and the conference room filled with a buzz.

Wang Luobin suddenly stood up—without asking the moderator's permission. The machinists of the Industry Group had completely ignored the moderator. "We also need a small foundry—don't forget that. And if we're going to make engines, it's essential. A single-cylinder diesel engine is practically a universal machine: it can plow and transplant rice in the fields, power boats on the water, generate electricity in the mountains, and haul people and cargo on the roads."

"Small engines aren't a problem. A typical single-cylinder agricultural engine can use cast iron. HT250 will do: good vibration absorption, good casting flow for shaping, easy to machine."

"Speaking of casting—I'm reminded of the mold-making issue. That's a specialized trade. Having equipment doesn't mean you can make good products; you need molds. Modern mold-making equipment is insane: 3D modeling, electrical discharge machining... This is a problem."

"Not that exaggerated. You're talking about now. In the past, process designers would design and draw the mold blueprints, then machine the parts, and finally have fitters assemble them—fitter skill was crucial."

...

Gradually, the machinery discussion subsided. The Industry Group had used a lot of paper; they seemed fairly confident. Wen Desi saw Engineer Wang scribbling enthusiastically and worried the procurement list might be getting too long.

"I'm Ji Situi." A man with a full beard stood up. Despite the facial hair, his face was actually baby-like. "I represent the Chemical Group in lodging a strong protest." He emphasized "Chemical Group" with particular weight. "Chemical industry is an extremely important manufacturing sector—how can it be lumped indiscriminately into the Industry Group? They're all machinists. We have nothing in common!"

"The grouping issue can be discussed later. First, tell us your views on chemical industry."

"Three acids, two alkalis. That's our goal—solving the production of these substances.

"Let me give you some basic chemical-industry knowledge. The chemical industry we're discussing is heavy chemical industry—the foundation of all chemical industry."

Now it was the machinery people's turn to yawn, though most still watched his presentation with interest.

"Chemical industry is the most versatile of all industrial sectors. Chemical products are rarely end products themselves; they're mainly utilized by other industries. For example: sulfuric acid for fertilizer industry, soda ash for glass manufacturing, synthetic ammonia for explosives and fertilizer, et cetera. If we can solve the production of these basic heavy-chemical products, we'll solve many manufacturing problems.

"Do you know how much your daily life depends on chemical industry? You don't—that's why you lumped chemistry with machinery!" He shook his head. "Tragic!"

"Skip the lamentations. Stick to the facts about chemical industry."

"Our fundamental chemical equipment needs include a synthetic-ammonia-cum-combined-soda-process system and a coal-tar chemical system. These two sets will roughly meet our basic needs—especially the synthetic-ammonia unit."

"What's coal-tar chemical equipment?"

"A coking furnace?"

"No. Simply put, it's integrated equipment for manufacturing various chemical products from coal tar. It can produce sulfuric acid, phenol, aniline, dyes—and sulfonamide."

"Sulfonamide is very useful—that gives us antibiotics."

"The output won't be high, but should be sufficient for general use."

"Synthetic ammonia—for fertilizer?"

"Extremely useful for us. In short: without synthetic ammonia, we can't produce nitric acid.

"Without nitric acid, we can't produce explosives.

"And the fertilizer industry's dependence on synthetic ammonia is even greater."

"Besides complete systems, we should prepare some backup chemical equipment: synthesis towers, absorption towers, carbon-removal towers, distillation towers, saturated-hot-water towers, various reaction kettles, pressure-resistant piping, acid pumps, heaters... I'd estimate we need 500–600 tons of materials."

"Can't we produce these ourselves? Our machinery industry is fairly complete."

"Materials issue," said Ji Situi. "Unless we can quickly produce stainless steel, polyethylene, and such materials, producing chemical equipment domestically within ten years will be very difficult."

"What about glass and ceramics? The Eighth Route Army made sulfuric acid using water urns as reaction towers. And many Great Leap Forward improvised chemical equipment used these materials." Luo Duo spoke up again.

"I'm not sure about that. If we can procure modern equipment, there's no need for improvised methods. At least production efficiency would be much higher. And the working environment is better than improvised setups. If any of you want to make sulfuric acid using water urns, you'd better think about your teeth."

"I'd like to ask: once we have this equipment, can we establish an organic-chemical industry?"

"That... will be very difficult." Ji Situi thought: *You people are really reaching for the stars.* Organic chemistry wasn't that easy.

"So no nylon and no synthetic rubber." Someone lamented.

"What do you need nylon for—stockings?" Someone teased.

"Sheer black, sheer nude... can't live without either."

When the atmosphere turned to trolling, Xiao Zishan had to quash their creativity and bring them back on topic.

"Rubber trees take eleven years before you can tap them, but there are many uses for rubber."

"We're not making condoms—why must we have rubber?"

This drew another round of laughter, and the meeting again descended into free-flowing discussion.

Xiao Zishan finally managed to restore order.

"I assume you want organic chemistry for plastics," Ji Situi addressed the person who had raised the question. The man nodded. "Plastics are our most common household material, but they involve complex organic chemistry. We probably can't produce them—it's not just a raw-materials issue. However, we can make celluloid and Bakelite."

"Bakelite is very useful."

"If we're building an electrical system, Bakelite is very useful—though rubber would be too..."

"Let's have the Agriculture Group address rubber later."
