# Chapter 1264 - Dutch Congratulations

After completing the occupation of Xiamen and Gulangyu, Ming Qiu ordered the Forward Command to move to Xiamen Island. Although the pacification war wasn't completely over, there were no longer any Zheng fortresses or organized troops on the island. Only some stragglers were hiding in the forests. Shi Zhiqi mobilized the Peace preservation Corps to carry out search missions. Each team of the Peace Preservation Corps was assigned a few prisoners, with the promise of a silver dollar for every former comrade they caught. Consequently, the prisoners eagerly led the Peace Preservation Corps over mountains and ridges to catch people. In this way, the security operations on Xiamen Island, Gulangyu, and Kinmen Island made rapid progress.

Now two-thirds of his mission was complete. The rest was mainly to prevent enemy counterattacks and verify the civil purge work in Anping, Xiamen, and Kinmen—a euphemism in official documents for large-scale looting and arrests.

The entire civil purge plan would take one to two weeks to finish. Before that, he had to ensure these occupied areas remained in the Senate's hands so the Planning Agency and Intelligence Bureau could carry out their tasks calmly.

The direction of Anping was the most likely location for a counterattack. The Zheng family had vast lands and manors in Nan'an and Jinjiang, with numerous private soldiers and local militia. Compared to the Ming official troops who remained immovable when friendly forces were in trouble, these people could unleash considerable combat power if someone commanded them and provided enough silver. For this reason, Ming Qiu placed the defensive focus on the Anping direction. The main Army forces of the follow-up troops were deployed near Anping, monitoring the movements of the two counties at all times.

The raids on Anping and other places killed and captured a large number of upper-level and core members of the Zheng group. However, there were always some who slipped through the net. Especially in Kinmen and Xiamen, some quick-witted individuals crossed the strait and fled to the mainland before the Navy could enforce a blockade.

Exactly how many members of the "Eighteen Chi" escaped remained uncertain. According to preliminary prisoner interrogations, key figures of the Eighteen Chi such as Zheng Zhifeng, Zheng Zhibao, Zheng Lian, and Zheng Cai had escaped. These individuals all held significant prestige and power within the Zheng group and could totally organize a large-scale counterattack.

As for the leader of the Zheng group, Zheng Zhilong, the Wasp Team reported a "suspected" kill. Although there was no hard evidence, the Intelligence Bureau analyzed the photos taken by Qian Shuixie and the collected evidence, concluding that the headless corpse was very likely Zheng Zhilong himself. The confessions of several Japanese and black guard captives captured on Xiamen Island also corroborated Zheng Zhilong's escape route. However, the two groups attempting to slip through the blockade had been wiped out, leaving no one to provide strong oral testimony. For this, Ming Qiu had sent people to exhume the body and sent a telegram to Kaohsiung requesting relevant professionals to come for an autopsy.

In the Operation Overlord Forward Command inside the Zhongzuo Garrison office, Ming Qiu, who hadn't rested for days, was receiving a special guest.

This guest had blue eyes and blond hair and a tall stature. He was none other than Traudenius, the Senior Merchant of the Dutch East India Company stationed in Zhangzhou Bay—that is, stationed with the Zheng group. He was appointed by Hans Putmans, the Governor of the East India Company in Tayouan, specifically to handle trade with the Zheng group.

On D-Day of Operation Overlord, Traudenius's ship was anchored at Gulangyu, and he was resting on board. When he heard someone was attacking Zhangzhou Bay, Traudenius was shocked and ordered the anchor weighed immediately to flee to the open sea. However, as it was not yet dawn, he didn't dare to act rashly. Plus, the Zheng group's power in Zhangzhou Bay was extremely strong; external enemies might not necessarily be able to break into the Xiamen Island area.

After daybreak, Traudenius realized the situation was much more severe. Thick black smoke rolled within the bay; the Zheng fleet seemed to be in a bad spot. But by then, he had received definite news that the fleet raiding Zhangzhou Bay belonged to the Australians.

Upon receiving this news, Traudenius decided not to risk fleeing—fleeing during an exchange of fire could easily be seen as hostile by the Australians and invite attack. He had been to Kaohsiung and seen Australian ships, so he understood the Australian naval superiority. If the Australians attacked his yacht, both the ship and people would certainly be destroyed.

The Australians had always valued promises and kept their word, and never killed indiscriminately. The Company had a trade agreement with them, and so far neither side had engaged in hostile acts. The Australian fleet likely wouldn't attack his ship. He immediately ordered the sailors to seal all cannon touchholes and hoist the East India Company flag and the Prince's Flag (Prinsenvlag). He also hung these two flags on both sides of the hull to indicate his identity.

His measures worked. The Australian fleet sailing from Kinmen didn't fire a single shell at his ship. Traudenius stood on the poop deck and observed a grand naval battle performance he had never seen before.

Yes, a naval battle performance. Traudenius could only use this term to describe it: the Zheng group's fleet was less an opponent and more a supporting actor dancing with the protagonist on stage. The Australian fleet, with perfect formation and artillery fire, firmly branded terror into the heart of this Dutch merchant.

"Zheng Zhilong is finished. Liu Xiang is finished too," he thought secretly. "God bless the East India Company!"

Traudenius took off his plumed hat and bowed. "My respects to you! Admiral."

Ming Qiu nodded in acknowledgment. Traudenius then added, "My masters and I offer our sincerest congratulations on your achieving such a brilliant victory." Saying this, he doffed his hat and bowed again.

"Thank you for your congratulations." Ming Qiu was a bit tired. He was over sixty after all, and days and nights of work had left his energy and physical strength dwindling. Now a Dutchman popped up—couldn't he just stay honestly on his ship? Why come to see him? But he was the supreme commander of the formation and had an obligation to handle diplomatic work.

"I believe your victory in Zhangzhou Bay will not affect our cooperation..."

"Alright, what do you want to say?" Ming Qiu said somewhat impatiently.

"It is like this..." Traudenius explained his request. It turned out he had just reached a trade agreement with Zheng Zhilong to purchase a large batch of sugar and silk from the Zheng group. His ship had come to Xiamen to load this cargo.

Part of this cargo was already on board, but the rest was still in the Dutch warehouse in Xiamen—luckily not burned down. Now Traudenius requested Ming Qiu's permission to continue loading and transporting the cargo stored in the warehouse. He had warehouse receipts to prove that this cargo had been paid for.

Ming Qiu pondered for a moment. This question was too sudden and a bit tricky for him. He wasn't trained in law and couldn't think of how similar cases should be handled. Logically speaking, the ownership of the goods belonged to the Dutch, and since the Dutchman had ample evidence, his request to transport them seemed reasonable. But this issue was sensitive, and he didn't know the relevant laws formulated by the Tribunal. It wasn't appropriate for him to make a decision on his own.

"I cannot promise you anything right now," Ming Qiu said after some consideration. "However, since you can provide evidence, I can order my subordinates to temporarily seal this batch of goods and not register them as war booty for the time being. You can send someone to the Maritime Court in Lingao to file a relevant lawsuit."

Although Traudenius expressed disappointment, this solution still left room for maneuver, so he accepted it immediately. He then tentatively asked about the Senate's next plans in Zhangzhou Bay, whether they intended to replace Zheng Zhilong and monopolize Fujian's foreign trade—specifically, did the Australians plan to occupy Anping and Xiamen hereon.

Ming Qiu had to use "no comment" to brush off the questions. After chatting irrelevantly for a while and sending Traudenius away, Ming Qiu thought: *The Dutch are indeed first-class merchants of the time. No wonder a small country with a population of a few million could become the Sea Coachman.*

The morning sun rose as usual. Great Kinmen Island, which originally had only some fishing villages besides the Zheng group's camps and docks, was now a scene of clamor. This was the material transfer station for Operation Overlord. Supplies transshipped from Taiwan were unloaded and transferred here, while loot and prisoners scavenged from Xiamen and Anping were concentrated on the island for registration before being shipped back.

Various goods, gold, silver, and weapons piled up like mountains. Planning Agency staff counted items and called out numbers, which were registered by designated personnel before being categorized and packed. These staff members worked in three-hour shifts with one hour of rest to avoid errors caused by fatigue from long working hours. Everyone knew that the Senate had "struck it rich" again this time.

Ning Liujin wore a "New Life Suit" (prison uniform) with a small wooden plaque hanging around his neck, pushing a wheelbarrow back and forth to move "war booty." He was captured on Kinmen Island. After running ashore, he hid in the woods, hungry and thirsty, and was soon forced to come out and surrender under the search of the Peace Preservation Corps with their big wolfhounds. Everyone said that although the Vagabond bandits killed like flies, they never killed indiscriminately and were kind to prisoners. For Ning Liujin, no matter how bad it got, he wouldn't be beheaded.

Sure enough, soon after surrendering, he was assigned to the labor team to work. The Vagabond captain in charge saw his clothes were tattered and even found him a new set of clothes to wear—though the clothes were admittedly weird.

In the evening, he ate a full meal: a thick gruel cooked in a big pot, salty and with the taste of meat! There seemed to be things like dried vegetable leaves inside. He didn't know what it was made of, but it was indeed grain, and you could eat as much as you wanted. For Ning Liujin, who stuffed his belly with sweet potatoes year-round, this was nothing short of a feast: sweet potatoes didn't stave off hunger.

Working for the Vagabond bandits seemed nice, at least better than that damned "distant relative" of his. He was full, and no one was interested in his ass. He thought this as he drank his sixth bowl of hot gruel.
