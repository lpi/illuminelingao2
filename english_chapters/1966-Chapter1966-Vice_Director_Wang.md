# Chapter 1966 - Vice Director Wang

"They're finally here!" Ai Zhixin gulped down his meal in three mouthfuls, threw aside his lunchbox, and walked out of the Harbor Treasury's temporary office to look out over the dock.

Finally, after looking forward to it as if waiting for the stars and moon, the H800 carrying the Finance and Tax Bureau team docked at the Da Shijie wharf.

Under Ai Zhixin's ceaseless urging and Cheng Dong's enthusiastic "concern," Wang Qiyi had finally arrived in Guangzhou with the cadres who had completed rotation training in Qiongshan and Chengmai, as well as some students from the Lingao Vocational School's finance and tax class.

"I've been looking forward to your arrival." Ai Zhixin stood on the dock, beaming with joy, firmly shaking Wang Qiyi's hands. "How was the journey? Our ships aren't exactly known for stability."

"It was okay, it was okay." Wang Qiyi, a landlubber, was a bit wilted from seasickness. "Here, 47 people. 25 from the rotation training class, 22 students from the finance and tax class. We've really emptied our pockets for this—the finance and tax class at Fangshaodi has lost half its students."

"Our finance and economics department really should have its own school. Always squeezing in with Fangshaodi isn't a long-term solution; we're at too much of a disadvantage."

Wang Qiyi knew that splitting up wouldn't help right now—even the Army and Navy Academies, the Political Security School, and the Central Police Academy's preparatory classes, which had formally separated, remained at Fangshaodi. There was no other reason than being able to borrow Fangshaodi's classrooms, teachers, and related equipment.

Ai Zhixin watched the group next to them preparing to disembark from the naturalized citizen channel, squeezing together with bags big and small. Each person had a standard rattan suitcase and a canvas backpack, with a rattan helmet-style hat on their head. Most looked weary, and some had faces even worse than Wang Qiyi's. Fortunately, a glance showed they were all young people around eighteen or twenty, the age of stamina and capability; a good sleep would bring them around. Suddenly, he noticed a problem.

"Why are there so few women? Didn't Director Cheng say before I left that he would specifically ask Hu Qingbai for female students?"

"My wife hasn't finished her training yet. You were pushing so hard, so the ones coming with me now are all students who have just completed one year since enrollment last year." Wang Qiyi thought to himself, *What are you plotting? Treating the Finance and Tax Bureau as your harem or something?*

"Good, good, good..." Hearing there were reinforcements coming, Ai Zhixin was in excellent spirits. "Old Wang, so you're taking up your post as a bachelor this time too? No one to take care of you?"

"No one!" Wang Qiyi thought this guy really knew how to rub salt in wounds. *If you hadn't pushed so hard, would I have needed to come separately from my wife?*

"Haha, perfect, perfect, don't worry about it. Let's go, brother will treat you to a meal first. Take a look at this Guangzhou Da Shijie—then we'll go to the Purple Light Pavilion for a bath."

Hearing this, Wang Qiyi hurriedly refused: "I can wash up at the Da Shijie guesthouse. I've never been into that 'grand health care' style..."

Ai Zhixin laughed upon hearing this: "Not at all, not at all. I know you're a married man, how would I dare cause family conflicts for you? It's just a bath and massage, nothing else—just enjoy a good relaxation. We have plenty to be busy with coming up. Let's go, let's go, eat first!"

The transmigrator restaurant was located on the top floor of Da Shijie. Pushing open the windows offered a panoramic view of the entire Da Shijie. Since it was afternoon, there weren't many people in the restaurant. Ai Zhixin asked for a private room and ordered some light, palatable dishes—partly to eat, and partly to discuss work while they were at it.

He was anxious to know Wudaokou's attitude toward his tax policies, because several of his friends had mentioned in personal letters that his tax policies had caused significant controversy in the Executive Committee. In particular, the tax farming system had been excoriated, and some had even proposed a thorough investigation into his "ideological route."

Putting that aside, Ai Zhixin was most concerned about how Wudaokou commented on it. After all, the views of experts were more important than those of laymen.

Dishes prepared for transmigrators were naturally the most exquisite. Considering Transmigrator Wang had just gotten off the ship and had a poor appetite, the chef prepared only a few refreshing, delicate side dishes accompanied by a bowl of porridge made from japonica rice.

However, Wang Qiyi's mind wasn't on eating or drinking either. From the day he boarded the ship, he had been considering the specific arrangements to discuss with Ai Zhixin.

Ai Zhixin had already completed the top-level design of the Finance and Tax Bureau and tax system in Guangzhou. Tax categories, rates, scope, and even the general collection methods had been determined. Relying on the naturalized citizen cadres he brought and the retained old clerks he absorbed, the Finance and Tax Bureau's organization could barely be said to exist—of course, this system hadn't actually started operating yet. So his, Wang Qiyi's, job was to solidify these things and make the machine of the Finance and Tax Bureau truly run.

Additionally, he had opinions on Ai Zhixin's current position. This opinion wasn't about who ranked higher or lower, but about issues in the current organizational structure of the Finance and Tax Bureau.

The blame for this problem naturally couldn't be placed on Ai Zhixin—it was all caused by "institutional streamlining" under personnel shortages. One could say there were "unavoidable" aspects, but Wang Qiyi felt such "expedient measures" should be minimized. Otherwise, it would be hard to explain clearly in the future when facing scrutiny. As a colleague, he felt obligated to remind Ai Zhixin.

After eating and drinking their fill, Ai Zhixin and Wang Qiyi didn't immediately return to Guangzhou city but went directly to the small lounge next door to talk work.

"Now that you're here, I can truly rest easy." Ai Zhixin lit a cigar for himself. "You don't know, these past few months being here alone, honestly, was damn nerve-wracking. Want one?"

"No thanks." Wang Qiyi didn't stand on ceremony with Ai Zhixin and opened his portable notebook. "Shall I start directly?"

"Sure."

"Director Ai, I've read all the plans and reports you sent to Lingao. I agree with the tax structure you've determined, centered on property tax, turnover tax, and stamp duty. This effectively captures major tax sources and fits the current professional level of our ordinary cadres. As for the poll tax, to be honest, I don't quite agree. This tax is not easy to collect. Although I know your purpose is to cultivate tax-paying consciousness, if collected strictly, it inevitably requires sufficient manpower and material resources, and the input-output ratio is too low; if collected loosely, it loses its original intent—moreover, once loopholes appear in this kind of direct tax, it immediately causes a counter-effect in social psychology. The simplistic personal income tax in the old timeline had similar problems: those making big money had ten thousand ways to avoid tax, while those paying were ordinary wage earners—because their income was clearest and collection easiest. As a result, the so-called wealth adjustment of 'income tax' became empty talk and instead became a target of criticism."

Ai Zhixin's expression didn't look too good—because this "Head Tax" was his "original creation," and now Wang Qiyi had criticized it as soon as he arrived. However, Ai Zhixin knew that since Wang Qiyi said this, it likely represented the opinion of Wudaokou or even the State Council. Besides, Wang Qiyi's comments were well-founded.

He thought for a moment and said, "The matter of the poll tax can be discussed further—it was just a draft anyway, intended for everyone to brainstorm."

Wang Qiyi nodded and continued, "Regarding tax items and rates, before coming here, Zhang Xiaoqi and I discussed them. The vast majority are very appropriate. There are a few individual areas we think need further consideration. This is too detailed, so I won't talk about it now; I'll report to you separately when needed. As for the collection method you set, including the plan of 'collect first, refund later,' Zhang Xiaoqi feels that since our enterprise income tax worked this way in the old timeline, we might as well try it now. She supports the thinking."

The Wang couple actually had quite a few ideas of their own about Ai Zhixin's plan. His wife had even said some things that were inconvenient to say publicly. However, Wang Qiyi wasn't willing to talk too much about this—after all, the State Council was anxious to push forward Guangzhou's financial and tax work and see results. There was no need to get too serious about inconsequential details. After all, Ai Zhixin's plan had no principled errors, and unity in the leadership team often determined the success or failure of the entire work. "Then below I'll talk about the opinions our couple discussed regarding concrete implementation..."

The Wang couple's plan didn't contain anything that surprised Ai Zhixin. It was nothing more than being task-oriented, leaving traces at every step, ensuring everything was auditable, and having checks and balances between posts. It was basically following the tax procedures of the old timeline, just merging or simplifying some parts. Although it was easy to say, if Ai Zhixin had to go through the entire process himself, he could barely manage by flipping through books. But to explain clearly the twists and turns of these dozen or twenty posts and over a hundred links, and to identify which could be simplified or merged based on the current level of naturalized citizens, was truly beyond his capability.

Because it involved specific work, Wang Qiyi had only covered a little more than half by dinner time. Ai Zhixin stated that health is the capital of revolution and proposed returning to the Finance and Tax Bureau to settle down, eat, and rest first. They would continue talking at the bureau tomorrow.

In the evening, Wang Qiyi took a sedan chair to the Finance and Tax Bureau—like many newly arrived transmigrators, he had originally insisted on "walking into the city" to demonstrate an "approachable" image. But upon seeing the mess everywhere at the Great East Gate enclosure, the piles of rubble, and the sludge dug out emitting foul odors... he compromised.

Carried all the way back to the Finance and Tax Bureau, Wang Qiyi was quite satisfied seeing the dormitory arrangement—this was much more comfortable than the transmigrator-exclusive tube-shaped apartment building in Lingao. Comrade Ai Zhixin had been very thoughtful; for instance, the bedroom was specially prepared with a double bed, and even the pillows were a pair. Considering the Wang couple's daughters might also come sightseeing, two guest rooms in the small courtyard had been specially renovated.

"What about the cadres who came together?"

"All arranged," Ai Zhixin said. "The dormitories are all newly renovated, sanitary, safe, and healthy."

"This cityscape of Guangzhou is really something to behold..."

"That's why our Mayor Liu is digging everywhere—the cost inside this is enormous..." Ai Zhixin shook his head. "Fortunately, our non-tax fiscal revenue for the first few months was quite good. The State Council allocated a large sum to Liu Xiang for urban construction fees."
