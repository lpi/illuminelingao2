# Chapter 458 - Autumn Levy (Part 9)

"It's already afternoon—are you inviting Young Master Huang for dinner?"

"No," Liu Dalin considered. If it was for dinner, the discussion would extend into the evening. He prided himself on being open and aboveboard; conducting business at night might invite criticism of furtive behavior. "Tell him to come tomorrow morning."

The next day, before dawn had fully broken, Huang Binkun arrived at the gate to pay his call—this young man's head had already been turned by thoughts of accomplishing great deeds.

Last time, the two of them hadn't discussed anything concrete. This sudden summons from Liu Dalin probably meant the "land survey" storm had blown his way too.

If Liu Dalin was willing to take the lead in drafting a petition, the matter would be more than half accomplished! In truth, even with Huang Binkun's understanding, he knew that even if the province dispatched troops, driving out the Australians wouldn't be easy. But his hostility toward the Baldies prevented him from facing reality.

"...I too am at my wits' end." Liu Dalin smiled bitterly. "My own family's land—even if they demanded I pay full taxes on all of it, I would accept. After all, it's only a few *mu*. But the land my relatives and friends have registered under my name is another matter. Since they've come to me for help, I can't fail to give them an answer."

"Uncle, as this humble nephew sees it, this land survey business is a case of the sword dance at Hongmen—pretending one thing while meaning another. Clearing hidden fields and false registrations is the pretense; targeting the county's gentry and major households is the real intent," Huang Binkun said.

Liu Dalin listened attentively and asked, "I've heard similar things from my household. However, clearing land registers is proper government business. Whether the Australians are involved or not, schemes like hiding land and false registration have always harmed the court's revenues. The Australians are using this as justification and borrowing the county yamen's authority—it's hard to argue against them. What solution does young sir propose?"

"In this humble nephew's view, the root of all this lies with the Baldy-bandits," Huang Binkun said quietly. "Chen Minggang and his ilk are merely jumping clowns using this to enrich themselves. But the Baldies' actions conceal sinister intent. If we continue to maneuver with them, we may harm ourselves first."

"What do you mean?" Liu Dalin was startled. He didn't know what this young man was planning. Seeing Huang Binkun's decisive expression, this was clearly a major matter. He became cautious.

"Rally all the county's gentry, grain households, and scholars. Draft a joint petition and send someone to deliver it to the provincial capital," Huang Binkun said. "This matter requires Uncle's strong support to succeed."

In the Ming and Qing dynasties, officials placed great importance on examination cohort connections and regional ties. Whenever local gentry wanted to accomplish something, they needed support from officials both at court and locally. Lingao had produced only one *jinshi* in its entire history—Liu Dalin himself—so regional connections at court were out of the question. But Liu Dalin had gained examination cohort connections when he passed the provincial and metropolitan examinations, and quite a few of his fellow graduates now held official positions. This was one avenue. In Huang Binkun's thinking, if Liu Dalin was willing to write several letters of introduction and the gentry and major households pooled together five or six thousand taels to send someone to the provincial capital for lobbying, there was still hope.

"Draft a petition?" Hearing his proposal, Liu Dalin was somewhat taken aback. He quickly glanced toward the doorway. The servant attending the study was a house-born domestic of many years, quite reliable.

"Exactly, Uncle!" Huang Binkun said. "A petition from gentry and commoners is no small matter..."

But Liu Dalin didn't see it that way. If the Baldies wanted to plunder from the major households, they could simply unleash their soldiers to pillage—never mind gentry and major households, they could swallow even the common people down to the bones. Why bother with a land survey? Though he disliked the Australians, he was nonetheless a well-read man who understood reason. In Lingao, the Australians not only deserved the phrase "not a strand of silk taken," but could even be called a "righteous army." Moreover, this grain levy—the greater portion was being collected for the Great Ming, wasn't it?

He shook his head. "It's not that I'm making excuses. Lingao has few distinguished names. Never mind at court—even within the province, you'd be hard-pressed to find more than a handful of Lingao-born officials. The highest-ranking are just education inspectors, county magistrates at best. How much effect would a petition really have..."

"As for my examination cohort connections," Liu Dalin sighed, "after passing the examinations, I fell ill and returned home. I never held an actual post for a single day. The bonds from those days are quite limited, alas!"

"I only ask Uncle to write several letters of introduction. We will naturally send capable people to the provincial capital to lobby. It's merely a matter of spending some silver."

"And what happens after the province receives the petition?" Liu Dalin asked. "Will they dispatch troops for a punitive campaign?"

"Naturally. Are we to just let them run amok?"

"Mm." Liu Dalin fell silent. His heart was deeply conflicted. Emotionally, he hoped Lingao would return to the way it was before the Australians arrived, so he could continue his peaceful scholarly life: reading and writing poetry daily, guiding young students in their studies. In summer, he could retreat to the countryside to escape the heat. When the mood struck, he and his friends could visit the county's scenic spots for an excursion and a few cups of wine. If the county had matters to attend to, he could offer what modest advice he could.

But after these Australians arrived, they had done many good things for the locality. Having lived here his whole life, Liu Dalin was most aware of Lingao's changes: over the past year, all sectors of the county—scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants—had benefited from the Australians. The previously moribund, desolate little county on the southern frontier now showed signs of prosperity. Especially recently, they had rebuilt the county school and supported the Jasmine Pavilion Academy, even subsidizing poor scholars of the county. All of this was exactly what Liu Dalin had wanted to do but never accomplished. His favorable impression of the transmigrators had risen considerably. Though he personally kept his distance, in his heart he had already removed the "rebel bandit" label from them.

Now Huang Binkun wanted him to take the lead in organizing a petition. Liu Dalin truly couldn't bring himself to make that decision. He wasn't afraid of consequences if the matter were exposed. But if the province really did dispatch troops for a campaign, this rare and unprecedented prosperous situation would immediately crumble to ashes.

---

Before passing the *jinshi* examination, Liu Dalin had traveled extensively on the mainland for his studies. He knew very well what government troops were like. Never mind whether they could actually defeat the Australians—regardless of victory or defeat, Lingao being ravaged by them was unavoidable.

"Young sir!" Liu Dalin said solemnly. "This matter requires caution! You and your father have spent years suppressing bandits and pacifying Li uprisings in this county. You must know that inviting government troops is easier than sending them away. If they actually come, and this county has always been poor in both public and private coffers, what would we use to accommodate these soldiers? Military mutinies have been heard of frequently these past few years!"

Huang Binkun was struck speechless. Liu Dalin was right. Never mind whether a mere petition could actually summon government troops—even if they did come, before the Baldies could be driven away, the county would probably be stripped bare by those soldiers first. Back when the Tinan Village and horse-dung Li uprisings occurred, his father Huang Shoutong had personally witnessed the government troops' outrages and had told him about them many times. If Huang Family Village hadn't already been well-fortified at the time, they probably would have been plundered clean as well. For this reason, Huang Shoutong had warned his sons repeatedly: when fighting alongside government troops, always be wary of them—not just for their tendency to suddenly flee, but also for their habit of robbing their own allies of heads, property, and provisions.

Thinking of this, more than half his enthusiasm for "heavenly reinforcements" evaporated. If government troops really did come for a campaign, never mind anything else, just the requisitions and supplies alone would pain the major households for years. By then, they'd probably all blame him for being meddlesome.

Huang Binkun's spirits deflated, but he wasn't willing to accept such defeat. He continued, "The Baldies have temporarily retracted their claws here in Lingao. But once their wings are fully grown, who knows what treasonous acts they might commit? By then, our Lingao would be dragged down into eternal damnation! Better to make preparations early."

"That is certainly a concern," Liu Dalin said. "As the saying goes, 'Those who repeatedly commit injustice will bring about their own destruction.' If the Australians truly dare to commit great treason, the gentry and scholars of this county will never tolerate them!"

These words were as good as saying nothing. Huang Binkun was silent.

"The only solution is to send someone to negotiate with them," Liu Dalin said. "We must find a suitable person to serve as intermediary and convey the grain households' collective sentiment. The Australians are not an unreasonable lot..."

Huang Binkun's eyes lit up. "If that's the case, why not rally the county's grain households to submit a petition to the Baldies?"

"Submit a petition to the Australians." Liu Dalin mused.

"Exactly—concerning this year's grain levy matter." Huang Binkun suggested asking Secretary Wang or Zhang Youfu to serve as intermediary, with both sides negotiating an appropriate solution. The key point: Chen Minggang must not be involved.

"That seems feasible," Liu Dalin said. "However, this matter..."

He didn't finish his thought. Naturally, this couldn't be entrusted to just any Zhang Three or Li Four. For the Australians to take it seriously, the person going forward had to carry some weight.

The person the Australians would consider most significant in the county was obviously not Wu Mingjin—it was Liu Dalin himself.

Liu Dalin struggled inwardly for a long time. He didn't want to step forward for this kind of thing, especially when the other party was the Australians of unknown provenance.

In the end, he nodded. "Very well. This matter would be best handled with me taking the lead."

"Uncle, your health—" Huang Binkun said with genuine concern. "Let my father take the lead instead."

"That won't do." Liu Dalin had made up his mind. If he didn't step forward personally, probably no one else in Lingao could. Looking at the Australians, they did seem inclined toward "civilization." If he reasoned with them, perhaps some effect could be achieved. At least it would give the county's gentry and grain households some explanation and spare them from being extorted by Chen Minggang's gang.

Huang Binkun was secretly overjoyed. With Liu Dalin willing to come forward, the grain households who had been wavering and taking a wait-and-see attitude would now be willing to join this petition. It would also make the Baldies squirm, whatever their plans might be.

Whether the Australians would yield, Huang Binkun wasn't entirely certain. But that this would give the transmigrators a headache was something he was sure of. If they were ordinary pirates or bandits, they naturally wouldn't humor your *jinshi* Liu or *juren* Huang. But the Australians were constantly performing their "love for the people" act—they couldn't possibly alienate him openly. To deal with Liu Dalin, they would probably have to make some gestures.

"You constantly preach 'peace and security for the realm'—well, now all the grain households are in an uproar. Let's see how you 'secure the realm'!"

Huang Binkun was secretly pleased. Though he couldn't go to the provincial capital to file complaints, using this opportunity to unite all the major households was already a significant achievement.
