# Chapter 1326 - A Visit to Fangcao Di (Part 3)

"Sir—Sir—" Huang Bingkun saw his dazed expression and, fearing he would lose his composure, hastily called out.

"Oh, oh..." Director Wang finally came to his senses. He looked around in a fluster, and his face couldn't help but redden.

"Temptress! Employing such fox-spirit bewitching arts—her heart deserves to be pierced!" Huang Bingkun said, managing to provide some cover for Director Wang and dilute the awkward atmosphere a bit.

The party thus settled in at Fangcao Di Educational Park. Dong Yizhi assigned several male and female academic affairs staff to serve as campus guides, instructing them that as long as it didn't interfere with normal teaching order, all areas were open to the visitors—except the laboratories. Not that there were any secrets to guard, but the contents were simply too dangerous for inexperienced natives, and some equipment was too expensive.

Liu Dalin led Wang Ci, Huang Bingkun, and the rest of the party on a thorough "investigation" of Fangcao Di Educational Park. Although the Australians' manner of receiving the delegation was somewhat hard to accept at first—no welcoming banquet, no formal reception, no major officials accompanying them—apart from a few male and female "minor clerks" from academic affairs serving as guides, there was nothing else whatsoever. It was a clear attitude of not taking them seriously.

Fortunately, the main purpose of the group was to investigate the school, so they didn't place much importance on ceremonial treatment. Huang Bingkun in particular had come mentally prepared to "endure humiliation for a greater purpose," so none of them had too many complaints.

Though the ceremonial treatment was ordinary, being able to move freely within Fangcao Di still satisfied some of the "interested parties": they could attend whatever class they wished to hear. At first, Huang Bingkun was somewhat nervous, fearing that one night the pirates might come silently in darkness to settle accounts. But gradually he relaxed and began wandering around campus, hoping to discover some of the pirates' secrets.

Over these past days, they had attended all manner of classes—from the natural science and arithmetic relating to "investigating things and extending knowledge" that they most wanted to hear, to the language courses taught using those "popular readers" that Wang Ci had once scorned. These classes included both small classes of dozens of students and large classes with hundreds packed into a tiered lecture hall. Once, when Huang Bingkun entered such a tiered classroom, he was almost overwhelmed by the scene inside: hundreds of people were crammed full into the classroom, one and all staring wide-eyed at the four enormous blackboards at the lowest level. Transmigrator Yuan was writing with chalk while lecturing under the gaze of several hundred people. A single class period was enough to fill half the blackboard.

Each student had a slate and a small box of chalk sticks. When exercises were needed, they would write on the slates, then wipe them clean with a rag. This paper-and-ink-saving method earned unanimous approval from the delegation. The only point of contention was that the children's posture when writing with chalk was incorrect—they pinched the chalk instead of holding it like a brush. However, compared to the dominance of simplified characters among the Australians, this was hardly a startling discovery.

"Teaching so many people at once—how can the explanation be clear?" Wang Ci admired this display of "teaching without discrimination," but couldn't help worrying about the teaching quality of such large-scale instruction.

The academic affairs guide smiled without answering. Wang Ci reconsidered and realized he was being obtuse—what could a bunch of fake-pirates know? Better to wait and ask when encountering real Australian pirates.

Unfortunately, the real pirates were generally very busy. Although they could frequently be seen giving lessons to students on campus, Fangcao Di's transmigrator teachers rarely taught ordinary Junior Elementary students anymore. Their students were the advanced-track Senior Elementary students, the normal school students, and the middle school students. Currently, several classes of promising students with Senior Elementary academic ability had been selected for secondary education cultivation.

After taking office, Zhang Zhixiang had conducted investigations and, together with Hu Qingbai, restructured the educational system. The goal was to implement universal education for naturalized citizens in the shortest possible time.

First, literacy education was separated from the Fangcao Di school system. A dedicated Literacy Department was established specifically for initial literacy work. Literacy Department teachers were partly normal school students from Fangcao Di on rotation, and partly native intellectuals who had undergone simple retraining—including student scholars, licentiates, merchants, and others with reading and writing ability from both locals and refugees. After being separated out and given simple training, these people served as literacy teachers within the Purification Camps. The main textbooks were traditional primers like the *Three Character Classic* and *Hundred Family Surnames*—although traditional materials, they were printed in simplified characters using new typesetting methods. This way, upon leaving the Purification Camp, students could already recognize two hundred Chinese characters, achieving preliminary literacy standards—though of course they could only read basically, not write. This category was classified as "Category C Credentials." This was a mandatory certificate for becoming a naturalized citizen.

Students were then streamed based on their performance in literacy education. Young children or those with strong learning ability entered Fangcao Di; those aged thirteen or older whose learning performance was poor were sent to labor allocation departments and then distributed to various industrial and agricultural apprenticeship teams.

Apprenticeship team students could attend evening school training to continue their education while working. They could take the credential examinations held twice yearly, open to all naturalized citizens and natives. Those who passed could obtain Category B and Category A credentials equivalent to Junior Elementary and Senior Elementary academic ability respectively.

After entering Fangcao Di, students first entered Junior Elementary studies. They spent one year mastering two thousand characters and gaining basic reading and writing ability; in mathematics, they mastered the four arithmetic operations and simple plane geometry. Those who passed entered the advanced track in preparation for advancing to Senior Elementary. Those who couldn't pass entered the slow track for another year, after which they received Junior Elementary credentials upon graduation and were allocated to various primary vocational education classes. After receiving several months of vocational training based on specialty and personal ability, they were assigned to various departments.

The highest-performing Junior Elementary graduates entered the Elementary Normal School to become Junior Elementary teachers—being a Junior Elementary teacher at Fangcao Di wasn't truly a profession; they themselves were Elementary Normal students, studying while teaching. Elementary Normal students actually had to complete Senior Elementary before graduating.

Junior Elementary was compulsory education in the Council's educational system. All children of appropriate age, whether naturalized citizens or local natives, could enroll—enrollment was mandatory for naturalized citizen children, and even more so for the orphans they took in.

Students entering Senior Elementary were similarly divided into advanced and slow tracks after one year of study. The advanced track prepared students academically for entering middle school; the slow track, after graduation, would participate in secondary vocational education classes or enter the Secondary Normal School.

Only one type of person was unaffected by the streaming destinations: "self-funded students." Self-funded students paid tuition to attend Fangcao Di. They roughly came from two sources: one was those with transmigrator "patrons"—generally the transmigrators' adopted children or students and apprentices, or children of ordinary naturalized citizens or natives whom some transmigrator had "taken a liking to" and was willing to cover tuition and living expenses for; the other type was like Huang Ping and the Li family's young master—children of local wealthy families who proactively enrolled to build connections with the Australians. Whether they could study Senior Elementary and Junior Middle School depended solely on their academic level and whether they could pay tuition. Some naturalized citizens' children, even if their grades weren't good enough for the advanced track, could enter higher-level schools as long as their Junior Elementary graduation scores were up to standard and their parents were willing to pay tuition and living expenses.

Under such an educational system, the demand for teachers was enormous. Besides fully utilizing native intellectuals as initial literacy teachers and training large numbers of normal school students, there was also refinement of the transmigrator educational rotation system that had already begun: transmigrators from non-educational departments had to complete a certain number of class hours for Fangcao Di each year. Industrial and agricultural sector transmigrators could offset their quotas with hours supervising students' industrial and agricultural practice; otherwise, all transmigrators had to contribute class hours. However, the temporary transmigrator teachers' students were mainly Senior Elementary and Middle School students. Politically speaking, this also reduced concerns about a small transmigrator oligarchy controlling naturalized elites through education and threatening other idle transmigrators—after all, the future naturalized elites would be taught by all the transmigrators, not just students of a few specific transmigrators.

The Fangcao Di Educational Delegation naturally couldn't understand these complex systems. For them, Fangcao Di had too many incredible aspects—it was truly eye-opening.

Throughout this period, Huang Bingkun had been unable to contact his former study companion Huang Ping. He even rarely had chances to see him—each time nothing more than a fleeting greeting in the hallway. However, in their nighttime discussions, Huang Bingkun had to admit to Liu Dalin and Wang Ci that the Australians' approach to education was truly extraordinary: every day, students at the school underwent high-intensity study and labor. Even every evening, the classrooms were brightly lit with students conducting their daily evening self-study. This self-study continued until deep into the night. And at six in the morning, the entire school's faculty and students were up again for morning running. Wang Ci even exclaimed that if these students were willing to apply themselves to the proper path, while making the golden list might be too much to say, passing as a Recommended Man would pose no problem.

Liu the Successful Candidate, however, was not impressed by this: although Fangcao Di's student management was strict and the students certainly worked hard, it didn't exceed some famous academies on the mainland. But the breadth of teaching content here, the variety of subjects—that was unheard of. Students not only had to study but also engage in all manner of work both on and off campus: from sweeping and cleaning to growing vegetables, raising chickens, cultivating mushrooms, to doing all kinds of handicrafts—everything was included. It rather had the air of the Mohist school.

As for the transmigrator teachers' work content—from the first class after morning study ended to the last class ending in the afternoon, any transmigrator teacher in the educational sector taught at least six classes per day. Never mind attending classes; just hearing about such high-intensity teaching made Liu Dalin and the others feel exhausted. Moreover, after daytime classes ended, they had only the time before dinner to rest briefly. After dinner ended, each transmigrator teacher had to take turns conducting normal school training, providing continuing education in knowledge to normal school student-teachers—and this didn't even count the time spent grading homework and examinations daily.
