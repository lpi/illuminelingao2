# Chapter 1652 - The Tender

"What kind of efficiency is this!" Staff Officer Hong grumbled. "They send me a few line drawings to look at but don't tell me how many vessels are actually available. Am I supposed to just use my imagination?"

He glanced at his watch—it was already close to one in the morning. He needed to get some rest. There would be even more work waiting for him tomorrow. He would eat the fish maw and snow clam stew from the *wugeng ji*, then go to sleep. As for his personal secretary, freshly bathed and fragrant and now wearing a gauze nightgown—she could cool her heels for tonight. He simply didn't have the energy...

Early the next morning, he appeared punctually in the "negotiation room" at the Great World. Sitting inside was a man dressed as a small merchant. Though it was already autumn and he wore a lined silk robe, sweat still dripped continuously down his face.

The visitor was Liu Deshan. He had dealt with the Australians before, so the sweating was not from fear—it was excitement. Unprecedented excitement: an Australian Chief wanted to discuss business with him!

Every merchant in Guangdong knew that simply being able to "establish a trade relationship" directly with the Australians was akin to inviting the God of Wealth into one's home. The Australians had excellent appetites and enormous demand for all manner of goods. Most crucially, their credit was impeccable—whether paying cash on delivery or settling accounts at the three annual festivals, there was never any delay or petty haggling. Everyone clamored for the opportunity.

Liu Deshan had done business with the Australians before, but only through their subsidiary trading companies. Now, to actually discuss business face-to-face with a Chief—and any deal requiring a Chief's personal involvement was surely a "major transaction"!

It was all thanks to Master Qin's generosity! Liu Deshan felt deeply that the saying "when traveling, rely on friends" was true. This deal had been introduced by Qin Haicheng. Otherwise, how could a small merchant like himself have secured such a grand business opportunity?

Thinking of this, he felt once again that his decision to give his daughter as a concubine to Master Qin's eldest son had been the right one. How else would a preeminent figure among maritime merchants like Master Qin have taken special notice of him? His cousin Chen Huamin had vehemently opposed the match at the time, calling it "undignified." But Liu Deshan didn't much care—daughters were money-losing commodities anyway. Besides, what dignity did merchants have to worry about? He wondered whether the Australian Chiefs took concubines. He still had several unmarried daughters back in the old family home...

While he was lost in idle speculation, Hong Huangnan had already stepped into the negotiation room. Liu Deshan sprang to his feet and greeted him with utmost respect: "Chief..."

Hong Huangnan waved his hand casually. "Liu Deshan, yes? Sit, sit, sit. No need for formalities."

"Yes, yes, yes." Liu Deshan sat down cautiously.

Hong Huangnan sized up the small merchant before him. He looked like a sturdy northerner, yet when he opened his mouth, it was in authentic Guangzhou Cantonese. According to Qin Haicheng, this Liu Deshan was actually a Dongguan native.

"You were introduced by Master Qin. He says you specialize in the north-south trade route and are an expert at dealing in goods from both regions."

"Yes, yes, you flatter me. I wouldn't call myself an expert. But your humble servant has spent years traveling the southern and northern seas and knows a thing or two about the north-south trade." Though he said "a thing or two," his expression betrayed a touch of pride.

"On the northern sea route, how far north have you traveled?"

"For proper commercial ports, that would be Tianjin Garrison. Further north, to Liaodong, isn't difficult either. But the court closed the Liaodong trade route when I was young. The farthest north I've been was Shanhai Garrison."

"Tianjin aside, Shanhai Garrison is not a commercial port. What kind of business could you do there?"

"The business at Shanhai Garrison is trade with the garrison soldiers and their officers," Liu Deshan explained. "You can buy Mongol goods there."

"Ah! So that's why Master Qin said you can obtain Mongol hides. Now I understand!"

"Indeed!" Liu Deshan nodded. "Mongol goods can also be purchased in Tianjin Garrison, but that trade is controlled by the Shanxi merchants—outsiders can't get a foot in, and they charge whatever they like. If you want to make real money, you have to buy from the Guan-Ning garrison officers—nearly every one of them deals in Mongol goods. Of course, it involves a bit of risk."

"We want to buy cowhide," Hong Huangnan said, getting straight to the point.

"Cowhide is not a major Mongol commodity," Liu Deshan said, taken aback. From Hong Chief's earlier remarks, he had thought he was interested in Mongol goods—but then he suddenly mentioned cowhide. "For cowhide, there's actually more supply in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan."

"I never said I wanted Mongol goods specifically," Hong Huangnan replied. "To be precise, I want cowhide, horsehide, donkey hide, mule hide..." He listed only the hides of large livestock. "However much you can get, I'll take."

"These are all rough hides, not precious goods. The shipping costs are worth more than the hides themselves." Liu Deshan was somewhat puzzled by their demand. Hides from large livestock, being coarse and stiff, had limited uses. They were less valuable than sheepskin—and even sheepskin wasn't particularly expensive. Poor northerners often wore sheepskin for warmth. "Horse, mule, and donkey hides are plentiful in the north. But for cowhide, you'd have to go to the southwest..."

"That's your concern, then. Whether you send people to the southwest to buy or go searching in the north—I want as much of these hides as you can get."

"No problem!" Liu Deshan trembled with excitement. These large-animal hides were cheap, slow-moving goods that cost little to procure. If the Australians were buying in unlimited quantities, the total volume would yield considerable profit.

"Go back and think it over, then submit your price quotation," Hong Huangnan said. "Here's the tender document. Fill in everything as detailed as possible. I need the first shipment delivered in two months. Can you manage that?"

This was rather tight. Since he and Chen Huamin had pooled funds to purchase the *Dongshanji*, their shipping speed had increased severalfold. But rough hides were a slow-moving commodity that few merchants stocked in large quantities—it would take considerable time to collect and consolidate shipments from various locations.

Yet thinking of the rolling wealth that would come once the deal was concluded, Liu Deshan gritted his teeth. "Yes! I can't promise exactly how much I'll deliver, but I will definitely deliver something!"

"Good! Shopkeeper Liu, you're certainly a man of few words and swift action!" Hong Huangnan nodded. "Then I look forward to your performance."

"I'll set about acquiring the goods immediately. I absolutely won't disappoint the Chief's expectations!" Liu Deshan rose and made to take his leave.

Hong Huangnan thought this showed him to be a decisive person, not like some merchants who loved to "sit and pontificate." The rough-hide business should be safe in his hands.

His reason for procuring rough hides on a large scale was primarily to make shoes for the soldiers. Wearing straw sandals for long periods damaged one's feet, while cloth shoes wore out too quickly. Taking advantage of the Guangdong Campaign, he had decided to completely reequip the soldiers with new footwear. Even if they couldn't wear full leather shoes, at least the soles should be leather.

"Send in the next one," Hong Huangnan instructed his secretary after drinking a few sips of tea.

Next to enter was Zhu Fusheng, manager of the Dachang Rice Shop's Guangzhou Main Branch. This Shopkeeper Zhu had originally operated a shop in Leizhou. After connecting with the Leizhou Sugar Mill, he had gradually prospered, expanding from a small rice store into a major rice trading company with branches throughout the province and even in Vietnam and Thailand. The main branch had also relocated to Guangzhou, squeezing out the Chaoshan merchants who had previously dominated this trade. Shopkeeper Zhu was now one of the prominent merchants in Guangzhou Prefecture with "Australian backing." In reality, he was already a non-shaven naturalized citizen—and of the thirteen total shares in the Dachang Rice Shop, the Zhu family now held only half a share.

This did not affect Zhu Fusheng's mood, however. Though he now effectively served as a "manager" for the Australians, his wealth and status had risen far beyond what the small rice shop owner in Xuwen County could have ever imagined. And it was not just him personally—his entire Zhu family clan had risen with him under the Australians. Even the least successful among them held at least a "cadre" position.

"Chief..." Zhu Fusheng was well acquainted with this Chief Hong. As the transmigrator in charge of Joint Logistics operations, he frequently dealt with the Dachang Rice Shop.

"Old Zhu, sit down," Hong Huangnan said. Since Zhu Fusheng was a naturalized citizen who regularly "served the Council of Elders and the People," there was no need for excessive courtesy. "How are the grain procurement arrangements I discussed with you last time coming along?"

Hong Huangnan's supply policy prioritized "local procurement," which meant purchasing sufficient rice and grain in advance. He had decided not only to buy in advance but also to pre-position these provisions in the various counties where the troops would be stationed.

"For those dozen or so counties you specified, I've arranged warehouses and guards in all of them," Zhu Fusheng reported. "But currently there isn't enough grain on the market—the autumn harvest hasn't come in yet, so prices are a bit high. I plan to start buying once the autumn grain hits the market."

By the Ming dynasty, Guangdong had become a province that could not achieve grain self-sufficiency. Though the Pearl River Delta had fertile land with excellent hydrological and thermal conditions, the extensive planting of cash crops had displaced food production. Grain had to be imported from neighboring provinces to meet demand.

"You need to move quickly on this. Each of those dozen counties needs to store thirty thousand kilograms of grain—whether rice or miscellaneous grains." This was his calculation based on one thousand soldiers' rations for thirty days. "If it's unhusked rice, prepare milling equipment in advance."

In addition to grain, each of these counties would also need to pre-position five hundred kilograms of salt and ten thousand kilograms of pickled vegetables. By the time the troops arrived, they could draw from these stores immediately.

"Chief, grain is no problem. Once the autumn harvest comes in, we can easily store even more. But with so much grain distributed across various locations, if something goes wrong, that would be a disaster..."

"You can rest easy about that. The counties where you're storing grain will all have security guarantees. Just make sure your people watch out for fire and theft." Hong Huangnan continued, "How are the preparations for the autumn grain procurement going?"

"Warehouses, baskets, hemp sacks, and personnel are all ready. The only issue is that the procurement targets Director put forward this time are too ambitious. Our operating capital is nowhere near sufficient, and Delong's allocation hasn't come through yet..."

"I'll coordinate with Delong. You just focus on getting everything ready," Hong Huangnan said. "Have your clerks at the various branches pay close attention to the local grain situation—any official granaries, charity granaries, ever-normal granaries, or anywhere else with large grain stores. Compile thorough intelligence on all of them."
