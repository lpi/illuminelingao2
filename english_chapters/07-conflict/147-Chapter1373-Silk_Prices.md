# Chapter 1373 - Silk Prices

Baskets upon baskets of white cocoons piled up in the warehouse. Wang Siniang and Lizheng were Jiangnan women and had both seen silkworm harvests, but they had never seen silkworms raised so well and so smoothly this time.

The dead and sick silkworms discarded were minimal, almost negligible. Wang Siniang had raised silkworms all her life. According to her experience, at least ten or twenty percent would be lost in every silkworm season. She didn't expect the method Miss Li taught them to be so effective! Not to mention that the quality of the harvested cocoons was surprisingly good. According to general parlance, the silkworm harvest this time was at least one hundred and twenty percent—in previous years, seventy or eighty percent was considered a very good year.

The master's silkworm seeds were good! The method Miss Li taught was also good! Now they finally had something to report! Both Wang Siniang and Lizheng breathed a sigh of relief. They both knew the impact of their independent performance this time on their future status in the mountain villa. Especially Lizheng, who was one of the six students personally taught by Zhao Yingong from the beginning, and later with the addition of He Ning, became the "Divine Seven." They were the master's personal students, and their status in the mountain villa was different from ordinary servants. Everyone knew that they would inevitably be the master's trusted aides in the future. Therefore, on top of their sense of superiority, they also had a strong sense of insecurity. The sense of competition was particularly strong.

With the spring silkworms harvested, Wang Siniang gave the silkworm raising women a break. Those from this village could go home, and the servants rested for a few days to prepare for the upcoming raising of the second crop of silkworms.

Actually, silkworms could be raised multiple times a year. In places with superior water and heat conditions and sufficient mulberry leaf supply, one could even raise eight crops a year. Given the climate conditions in Jiangnan at that time, four or five crops a year were not a problem. In Huzhou, there were also farmers who raised five crops of silkworms.

However, in actual silkworm raising, farmers rarely raised multiple crops of silkworms, mostly only raising one crop. After the raw silk came onto the market in June, the silkworm raising work ended. On one hand, the scale of the small peasant economy was limited, and farmers had to attend to planting and other sidelines, while raising silkworms occupied a lot of manpower. Small farmers could not support the occupation of labor by long-term continuous silkworm raising. On the other hand, and the most important problem, was that local methods of raising silkworms had no clear concept of disinfection. Although there were measures such as cleaning the silkworm room and brushing lime water, the causes of silkworm diseases were not clear. Disinfection of silkworm tools and rooms was insufficient. As the temperature rose, viruses and bacteria became more active, and the probability of silkworm diseases increased significantly.

In addition, it also involved the temperature and humidity control required for raising silkworms. Spring was neither cold nor hot, with moderate dryness and humidity. In summer and autumn, this natural advantage no longer existed, and human intervention was needed. There were quite high requirements for silkworm raising technology and capital investment. This was difficult to achieve for sericulture households, most of whom were small farmers.

In Li Yao'er's view, the fact that Jiangnan farmers generally only raised one crop of silkworms was simply a waste of mulberry tree resources. Given the water and heat conditions in Jiangnan, raising three crops of silkworms was a safer practice.

When the Shen Da family began to collect cocoons, the silkworms in Shen Kaibao's family had not yet "gone up the mountain." The whole family was enduring. Seeing the bodies of the silkworm babies becoming transparent and gradually stopping eating, the hearts of the whole family hung in their throats. The success or failure of this year depended entirely on this move. If the silkworm harvest was bad, the land mortgaged would have to take the surname Cao, not to mention the debt owed to Master Zhao! What would they use to pay people back? Every time Shen Kaibao thought of this, he was so anxious that he couldn't sleep.

The fire basins were taken down from under the "mountain sheds." The mature silkworms originally on the silkworm trays were all transferred to the "mountain sheds." Fire was used underneath to urge them. When the silkworms felt the heat on the mountain shed, they crawled towards the clusters bundled with straw. In the room, there was a rustling sound.

This was the first procedure when silkworms were about to make cocoons. Those that couldn't go up to the clusters were not healthy silkworms and couldn't make cocoons—even if they went up, sometimes they would just crawl around randomly and refuse to spin cocoons. At this time, apart from praying silently in their hearts, they could only leave everything to luck.

The humidity in the silkworm room was very heavy—silkworm babies had to excrete silkworm urine before going up the mountain, so the air had a wet, strange smell, but this was also a signal that the silkworms were mature and about to mount to spin cocoons, so everyone was very happy. Looking forward to a good year this year.

Three days after "going up the mountain," the fire was extinguished as usual. Shen Kaibao opened the corner of the reed curtain with trembling hands and took a look, his heart pounding. The whole family gathered behind him, holding their breath, not even daring to breathe loudly.

It was good! The rice straw clusters were a patch of snow white. At a rough glance, there was eighty percent, maybe ninety percent. This was a rare good year in recent years! Shen Kaibao's whole family immediately filled with laughter. Now their hearts settled down. The whole family's month of enduring hunger, sleeplessness, debt, and bearing interest was not in vain.

Similar laughter rose everywhere in the village. The silkworm harvest was excellent this year, and most families could harvest seventy or eighty percent. A few, like Shen Kaibao's family, could harvest ninety percent.

The farmers who had been breathless from famine and debt all breathed a sigh of relief. They could finally get by this year. The riverside and the rice drying ground were now full of women and children again. These people were much thinner than a month ago, with sunken eye sockets and raspy voices. However, the relieved sense of relaxation made their spirits very high.

Everyone was thinking about their plans after harvesting the silkworm cocoons. Part of the silkworm cocoons naturally had to be used to repay the rice and mulberry leaves borrowed from Master Zhao first—luckily there was Master Zhao this year, otherwise it was really hard to say how much of these silkworm cocoons would be left as their own.

The next step naturally was the women's main show—reeling silk. Reeling out white silk, selling it to silk guests, and exchanging it for silver and copper coins: owed debts had to be paid, and the lined clothes and summer clothes in the pawnshop had to be redeemed... The housewives and men of each family were calculating the essential expenses, seeing which ones had to be spent and which ones could be delayed.

Duoduo's mother also returned from the Shen Da family. Her face was radiant—although she had worked hard this past month, the one tael of silver wages she had just settled weighed heavily in her bosom. She also brought back four kinds of thank-you gifts from Wang Siniang, all "good food"—making several children in the family happy like monkeys unlocked. In addition, there was a bolt of Songjiang cotton cloth.

Duoduo's mother's silkworm harvest was also not bad, with a full eighty percent harvested. Plus Duoduo's mother had eaten at someone else's place this month and brought back one tael of silver, immediately becoming the object of envy of the neighbors. Raising silkworms oneself, the outcome depended on God's will; it was safer to earn money by helping others raise silkworms.

Every household took out their silk reels at this moment. Women started making silk, and the sound of reeling machines and the steam of boiling water pots were everywhere in the village. A scene of bustling happiness.

However, everyone's joy did not last long. The first batch of "silk and cocoon guests" who arrived along the pond road brought bad news.

The first silk and cocoon guest to arrive was "Huang The Little Pigtail." He was sickly when he was young, and his family was afraid they couldn't raise him, so they left a small pigtail on the back of his head, which wasn't cut off until after he "married," but this nickname remained.

He didn't have a silk hong (guild/firm) himself. Every year, he came to the vicinity to purchase cocoons and raw silk for several silk hongs in Hangzhou city, living on the commission. He was very familiar with the people in the village. He was a decent person. Although he inevitably cheated people, he didn't go too far. If anyone had difficulties and really couldn't get by, he would be willing to lend some money at one or one and a half percent interest without collateral for emergency use.

The family "Huang The Little Pigtail" knew best in the village was Shen Kaibao's family. In the past, when he came down to the village to collect cocoon silk, he stayed at his house. This time, he brought four kinds of water gifts as usual.

"Kaibao, are you selling cocoons or making silk yourself this year?" Huang The Little Pigtail pulled Shen Kaibao to sit under a willow tree by the vegetable plot behind the Shen house and asked quietly.

"Selling silk, naturally. How much money can silkworm cocoons sell for?" Shen Kaibao said disapprovingly. Selling silkworm cocoons was something only families with insufficient manpower would do.

"The market this year is not good." Huang The Little Pigtail patted his thigh and sighed, lowering his voice. "You probably don't know yet. The yamen in the city issued a notice this year saying that this year's silk cocoons—"

"I know this. But how is the market exactly?" Shen Kaibao was already startled in his heart. He had always harbored a bad premonition about this year's raw silk market. The toil of the silkworm season and the joy of harvest had once diluted this worry. Now Huang The Little Pigtail's words made his whole body tense up again.

Huang The Little Pigtail sighed again: "Very bad! So bad that everyone will have no way to live!"

He was literate and often ran around the city, so his news was much more detailed than Shen Kaibao's. This year, in the name of relief, the sales of raw silk and silkworm cocoons in the whole prefecture were contracted to the Famine Relief Bureau. Therefore, all silk and cocoon hongs had to get a written approval from the Famine Relief Bureau to purchase.

"...Think about it, brother. On one hand, the silver for famine relief has to come from this. On the other hand, from the Prefect up top to the committee members of the Famine Relief Bureau down below, who doesn't need to wet their hands? Think about it, can the market be good this year?"

Therefore, the peers discussed together this year and set a public price. All big and small peers, including the "silk guests" going down to the countryside, had to purchase at this public price. They could only lower it, not raise it.

Shen Kaibao felt his philtrum tighten. He asked anxiously: "Don't keep me in suspense. What's the price this year?"

"Twenty-five taels of silver for a picul of silk."

"What?!" Shen Kaibao almost jumped up. This market price dropped by more than half compared to last year. His heart sank to the bottom instantly, and his head felt dizzy. "This is asking us silkworm farmers to hang ourselves!"

"Brother! Don't be anxious!" Huang The Little Pigtail hurried said, "There is no other way..."

Shen Kaibao didn't know how he got home. A heavy sense of unease subsequently shrouded the sky over the originally joyous small village. After Huang The Little Pigtail, several more silk guests came. What they said was largely identical to Huang The Little Pigtail. Only this price, they refused to add a single coin. No matter if you begged or cursed, these people all insisted on the original price without change. They also spoke "toughly": If we add one or two taels for you, what do we eat? The silk business is hard to do this year!
