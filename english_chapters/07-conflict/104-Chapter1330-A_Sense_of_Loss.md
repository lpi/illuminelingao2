# Chapter 1330 - A Visit to Fangcao Di: A Sense of Loss

Though Huang Ping performed actively, the Red Team was overall somewhat inferior. The match concluded with a Blue Team victory. When the final whistle blew, Dong Yizhi came down from the field to greet the delegation.

Liu Dalin looked at this Australian gentleman with eyes full of curiosity: dark complexion, robust physique, and having just refereed a match while running back and forth with the students—fine beads of sweat on his large forehead after the exercise.

"Master Dong, your group truly has the ability to turn stone into gold," Liu Dalin said tactfully. "I hear most of these children are destitute orphans collected from the mainland? Who would have thought that after your instruction, each and every one now shines with brilliance, no longer resembling children of poor and humble families."

"Not at all," Dong Yizhi said modestly. "Didn't the venerable Master Kong also say: 'In teaching, there should be no distinction of classes.' Chen Sheng and Wu Guang also said: 'Are kings and nobles born to their status?' Though wealth and poverty cannot be equalized throughout the realm, as long as everyone has access to education, children of poor and humble families can also truly get ahead."

China's ancient imperial examination system was indeed a relatively fair system—at least institutionally, it guaranteed the possibility for children of humble families to change their fate through study and examination. However, in reality, those who achieved this transformation were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Studying in ancient society required considerable economic foundation; truly impoverished commoners, unless by some fortuitous coincidence, simply couldn't afford to support their children in schooling.

Liu Dalin understood this very well—he himself came from an official's family. Whether his fellow examinees from the provincial examination or his fellow *jinshi* candidates, very few truly came from impoverished common families. At the very least, their families had a few *mu* of thin farmland or had clan support.

Though the Australians' schools didn't teach the learning of the sages, they could genuinely be called "teaching without discrimination." Though he wasn't a merchant and his livelihood was managed by family members, he understood that a school of this size, with the daily expenses for thousands of children in food and supplies, amounted to an enormous sum. Not to mention all the construction and maintenance expenses for the school itself. Liu Dalin estimated that even if old Lingao County had devoted its entire tax revenue, it still couldn't have sustained this school.

"Ha ha, this skill of 'taking a hundred years to nurture people'—I could never match it." Liu Dalin spoke from the heart. "But there's one thing I've never understood. You gentlemen already bestride the four seas. If you wished, you could collect all the wealth of the realm. Why do you still put yourselves through such exhausting labor? Haven't you heard that life is short? The talents you cultivate at such great expense won't be ready for use for another ten or twenty years." As he spoke, his small but sharp eyes fixed intently on Dong Yizhi.

Dong Yizhi was momentarily at a loss for words. He thought to himself: how could I tell you about our dark secrets of building harems and human species museums? I couldn't explain those to you anyway. Watching Transmigrator Dong's face redden as he seemed to struggle in thought, Liu Dalin waited. Finally Transmigrator Dong came up with something and declared with raised head:

"We who establish schools do so neither for wealth, nor for power, nor for fame. We do it so that one day: all the land under heaven will be the soil of Huaxia, and all the people on earth will be subjects of Huaxia!"

For a moment, all the scholars around heard this. One and all they stood dumbstruck. These words were arrogant in the extreme, far exceeding anything as mundane as "rebelling to become emperor."

Huang Bingkun thought to himself: "The height of wild insolence!"

He observed Liu Dalin's expression—and saw it was very complex. Silently he cursed: "You people also dare claim Huaxia!" These people were mad demagogues bent on transforming the civilized into barbarians, yet they kept hanging the word "Huaxia" on their lips as a banner. Truly shameless beyond measure.

Huang Bingkun had originally planned to use this opportunity to have a good talk with Huang Ping—particularly to sternly point out that embracing female students was "injurious to public morals," and that any girl who would embrace him so must be "flighty and lascivious." He wanted Huang Ping to properly examine himself and not sink further into depravity. Who would have thought that his former servant, upon seeing him, showed no consciousness of the distinction between master and servant? Before he could even begin his lecture, Huang Ping casually said he had to go shower immediately and had evening self-study later, then simply took his leave.

"There's a physics test tomorrow. I need to go back and review properly." Huang Ping said. "The teacher says, master mathematics, physics, and chemistry and you can dominate the world. I need to put in some real effort."

This left Huang Bingkun feeling very lost indeed: Huang Ping had served him since childhood, with a bond far deeper than ordinary master and servant. Now that he had come here to study, he seemed to have grown distant. What was so special about the Australians' learning that it could bewitch people's hearts so?

Had his decision to send Huang Ping to study here been the right move? Should he simply call Huang Ping back and end his schooling? If so, the channel he had painstakingly arranged to understand the Australians would be severed. But if he didn't call him back, at this rate, Huang Ping was bound to turn into a "fake-pirate."

Carrying this conflicted state of mind until dinnertime, Dong Yizhi saw him looking somewhat abstracted in the cafeteria and asked if his appetite was poor.

Huang Bingkun shook his head. He suddenly asked: "Just now I heard a Fangcao Di student say, 'Master tree-li-wa and dominate the entire world.' Is that true?"

Dong Yizhi was puzzled for a long moment before understanding. He burst out laughing: "It's 'Master mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and go anywhere under heaven.'"

Huang Bingkun said: "Is this 'tree-li-wa' really that formidable?"

Dong Yizhi said: "Of course. Shipbuilding and construction, road-building and bridge-erecting, marching and fighting—how could any of that do without mathematics, physics, and chemistry?"

Huang Bingkun thought that this "tree-li-wa" must be the Australians' secret arts. He listened as Transmigrator Dong continued: "But even if you're good at math, physics, and chemistry, your three views must also be correct." Seeing Huang Bingkun looking blank, Transmigrator Dong explained: "The three views are worldview, outlook on life, and values." Only then did Huang Bingkun's expression show comprehension.

Actually, what Huang Bingkun was thinking was: apparently the pirates' secret arts followed the Way. These "ten-commandments-view," "ginseng-view," and "appreciation-view" must be three extremely important Taoist temples in Australia. If there was ever an opportunity, he must visit and investigate them.

Huang Bingkun asked again: "I've also heard that students must practice the 'tree-li-wa' talismans daily, not only memorizing them but copying them repeatedly."

Transmigrator Dong laughed: "Those aren't talismans, they're formulas. Formulas have universal applicability; they can solve all sorts of problems in the world. They're very important."

Huang Bingkun's heart leaped with joy. These "formula talismans" must be the key to the pirates' secret arts. So he humbly asked for instruction: "Might the Transmigrator grant me... ah, teach me some formulas?"

Dong Yizhi thought, what do you want these for? Have you really seen the light after this visit? So he pulled out a notebook and casually wrote down several mathematical and physics formulas for him. Huang Bingkun took the paper and examined it over and over, then asked: "Which is the most powerful?"

Dong Yizhi casually pointed to one and said: "This one. This one is most important."

Huang Bingkun treasured the formula paper and carefully stored it away, intending to take it home and study it thoroughly.

That evening, Huang Bingkun sat at the desk in his dormitory practicing Australian talismans. After copying more than a dozen pages, he still felt something was wrong. Slapping his forehead, he sighed: "Alas! I forgot that the pirates draw their talismans using Australian pens and must write horizontally from left to right."

So he immediately found the school's convenience store and bought Australian charcoal pencils. He also adopted the "Australian calligraphy" style for copying formulas. But years of habit writing from right to left and top to bottom made him very uncomfortable. He couldn't help but grumble while writing: "The *Analects* says 'unkempt hair and left-lapelled robes.' These pirates with their short hair and left-to-right writing—being abroad so long truly turned them into barbarians."

But though the talismans were copied well, he still couldn't make head or tail of what "tree-li-wa" actually meant—he would just have to wait for Huang Ping to come back and ask.

The delegation's visit had reached its final day. Though they had only stayed two nights, most delegation members were already anxious to leave.

During their time at this Australian school, the overwhelming impression was that "I'm an uneducated person." Even the content studied by the very lowest-level Junior Elementary students—much of it was completely incomprehensible to them. This made the scholars feel quite wounded. Worries about future prospects made them unable to spare any thought for critical spirit.

Chinese scholars had always taken "excel at studies and become an official" as their ultimate life goal. When they discovered that their "bellies full of learning" weren't part of what the Australians were looking for in selecting "scholars," one and all they panicked.

Though what they had learned met the Great Ming's standards for selecting officials, these scholars were well aware in their hearts that, given this county's literary tradition, they might not even produce one *jinshi* in another hundred years. Producing a few *juren* would already be noteworthy enough to record in the county gazetteer.

Now there appeared this Australian nouveau riche—whether they intended to seize the realm and ascend the dragon throne, or merely carve out Hainan, for frustrated scholars this represented a brand-new opportunity. If they could attach themselves early, securing a minor post in the new dynasty would surely be no problem. Quite a few in the delegation were people hoping to climb into positions; this visit to Fangcao Di was partly to probe the Australians' selection standards.

Now it turned out that Australian learning was completely different from theirs. Their only advantage over these students was knowing more characters and being able to compose a bit of poetry.

Given this, several of them pressed Transmigrator Dong—who frequently appeared to receive them—to build connections, hoping to find some chance to study "Australian learning."

Transmigrator Dong smiled and thanked them for their interest. However, he explained that Fangcao Di currently only offered classes for children. There were no classes for adults. The only classes currently open to adults were literacy teacher training classes. If the gentlemen were interested, they could apply to become literacy teachers at Purification Camps, and then they would have opportunities to participate in specialized training.

These words deflated them considerably—it wasn't as if no scholars had gone to Purification Camps to become literacy teachers, but those were all student scholars who couldn't even pass the initial examination, clerks who had lost their positions, or at most impoverished licentiates. For them—people who were after all men of some face and standing in the scholarly world—to associate with such company was really beneath their dignity.
