# Chapter 1447 - The Second Report

Mu Min waited for a moment at the counter. The morgue duty officer, a somewhat seedy-looking semi-old man with a wrinkled black uniform jacket and open collar, reluctantly put down the book in his hand and slowly checked her ID according to regulations.

Obviously, Mu Min's sudden visit disturbed his leisure time.

When he realized the visitor was a senior officer of the National Police and an Elder, he hurriedly buttoned his collar and performed a nondescript attention stance with heels together.

"Chief..."

"Let's get to business." Mu Min realized that although she was in uniform, the other party obviously turned a blind eye to her rank insignia. Of course, it was unrealistic to demand too much from a coroner's "helper" who had muddled through half his life in the county yamen.

The duty officer wrote down the visitor's name in the register.

"Which corpse do you want to inspect?"

"The student from the Maid School sent in the morning of September 1."

The duty officer's expression froze for a moment; this momentary change did not escape Mu Min's eyes.

"Is there a problem?"

"Chief. There is a small problem." The duty officer was a little nervous. Although he had worked for the "Australians" for a few years, he still wasn't quite used to it: work in the Ming county yamen was much simpler, without so many complicated rules and regulations of the Australians. As long as you coaxed the superiors well, it didn't matter what you did. In the Australians' yamen, a dangerous and tense atmosphere always permeated.

"What is it?"

"Chief Su has given instructions that no one can inspect No. 1633090107001 without her permission..." A light flashed in the duty officer's mind, "Please allow me to make a phone call to ask for instructions."

A few minutes later he put down the phone with a fearful expression:

"I'll lead the way for you right now. Please be understanding..."

"Skip the polite words." Mu Min said seriously, "Lead the way."

The duty officer picked a bunch form a large pile of keys, then led the way in front.

Opening the last iron gate revealed a monotonous corridor. The duty officer turned on the electric light, illuminating the brick spiral staircase at the end of the corridor that looked pitch-black as if leading to hell. Beside the spiral staircase was a square elevator shaft enclosed by four iron pillars and iron mesh plates. A pitch-black iron plate hung in the air by iron chains—this was the manual elevator to the basement—specially used to transport corpses.

Mu Min followed the duty officer down the spiral staircase illuminated by weak electric light. The staircase was very high. Walking to the front hall, the duty officer turned on the light. The cold white light of the fluorescent lamp instantly illuminated the cold room covered with white tiles.

There were three tightly closed iron-clad doors in the front hall, all with large padlocks. Arabic numeral numbers were painted on the doors with black paint.

The duty officer lit a cigarette in his hand. This was not to cover the smell of corpse decomposition—the temperature in the morgue was very low, and corpses would not emit odors—but to mask the pungent smell of preservatives.

"Is it No. 1633090107001, the student from the Maid School?"

"Yes."

"In Morgue No. 1."

The duty officer opened the padlock of a large door and pulled open the heavy door. Cold air hit their faces. Mu Min couldn't help shivering. The duty officer turned on the light switch, and the two walked into the morgue that was like an ice storage. The pale fluorescent lights on the ceiling made the room look even colder. The floor paved with white tiles sloped slightly towards the center of the room, where the cover plate of the drainage ditch was located. The sound of melting ice water flowing in the drainage ditch could be heard. To control humidity, the special racks on both sides of the walls were hung with replaceable rough paper packages containing furnace ash acting as dehumidifiers. On the other two walls were large wooden drawers covered with galvanized iron sheets. The corpses were all placed inside. The duty officer took down a loose-leaf binder from the wall and flipped through it.

"This one." He tucked the binder under his arm, walked to a large drawer, and pulled it open. Mu Min walked over and lifted the white cloth sheet covering the corpse.

The frozen stiff corpse looked very different from when she went to investigate the scene on the day of the incident. It could be seen that the deceased had already been dissected. Mu Min breathed on her frozen cold palms, reached into the inner pocket of her coat, took out a pair of disposable cotton gloves coated with tung oil, serving as a simple substitute for latex gloves.

She put on the gloves, picked up the arm of the deceased, and carefully looked at the hands and arms of the corpse. Only after a long time did she let out a breath and said to the duty officer:

"That's enough."

Mu Min returned to the ground for quite a while before she felt the cold air enveloping her whole body retreat a little. Just as she was about to leave the Forensic Center, she saw a pale, tall figure waiting for her in the lobby.

"Can I talk to you?"

"Of course." Mu Min seemed to have anticipated this meeting.

The conversation took place in Su Wan's office. Because it wasn't official business, she lit a gas lamp and ordered the night secretary to pour two cups of tea. Then she closed the door and asked:

"Are you in charge of this case?"

"Yes."

"Does the Executive Committee have any instructions on this case?"

"No instructions." Mu Min laughed weirdly. "Why do you think the Executive Committee would have any instructions on this case?"

"A student of the Maid School, not staying properly in her dormitory, died inexplicably in the Elder residential area, and the case is handled by you personally—I would find it strange if the Executive Committee *didn't* have instructions."

"You are quite sensitive. But apart from Xiao Zishan calling to ask, no Executive Committee member has inquired about this matter yet." Mu Min said, "What do you want to tell me?"

"What did Director Xiao say?"

"Find out the truth and report as soon as possible."

Su Wan seemed to breathe a sigh of relief: "Have you seen my autopsy report?"

"Seen it." Mu Min nodded. "This report is very incomplete. There isn't even a conclusion on whether it was suicide."

Su Wan's report was typical of reserving judgment, only stating the examined injury status and cause of death, with no conclusion on whether it was homicide. Mu Min had done criminal investigation work for five years and handled over ten cases of falling from buildings. In her experience, this was a typical homicide case.

According to the report, the deceased was obviously beaten with heavy objects and violence, then pushed off the high building to her death.

Generally speaking, jumping off a building would not cause multiple spinal fractures and massive hemorrhage in both the chest and abdomen. Massive hemorrhage in the head was possible, but not without accompanying skull fractures.

Landing on the front would cause sternum and rib fractures and frontal hemorrhage, but would not cause multiple spinal fractures; landing on the back would cause multiple spinal fractures but not frontal fractures. The deceased had fractures on both front and back, which was unlikely from the height of a three-story building in the dormitory area.

"This is a homicide case," Su Wan said with a relaxed face. "Because Mu Min urged urgently, I only submitted the first forensic report."

"I understand you wanted to wait for the Executive Committee's attitude. But for us, finding out the truth is the most important thing; who possesses the truth is not our business."

"I have a second inspection report."

"Just tell me the content of your second report first." Mu Min said, "My time is tight."

"Simply put, generally accidental falls land head up feet down, usually with severe leg fractures, but the head may not be injured. Frontal landing is common in spontaneous falls, usually with frontal fractures and head hemorrhage, but the spine rarely has severe fractures and the abdomen won't bleed. Frontal landing with abdominal hemorrhage is basically the abdomen hitting stones or similar things on the ground."

Mu Min listened very carefully, jotting down key points in her notebook.

"Although I haven't been to the scene, my students brought me a complete site survey report and photos. There were no stones or similar things on the ground at the fall site."

"So?"

"So Lin Xiaoya actually fell landing on her back, and she was beaten before falling—the abdominal hemorrhage was internal injury left by the beating."

Falling landing on the back is usually homicide, meaning facing the murderer and being pushed or falling due to other factors. Because of the back landing, it would be accompanied by severe spinal fractures.

Mu Min nodded: "So it's confirmed to be homicide."

"Correct, you went to see the corpse just now; you must have noticed the defensive wounds on her arms."

"Yes, I saw them."

"Although I'm not a trace expert, I can roughly tell it was caused by a fairly sturdy stick—nine out of ten it was hardwood. If there is an on-site physical evidence report, you will probably find this weapon. Of course, the level of naturalized forensic personnel is too low; it's also very possible they missed it."

"I will personally inspect the scene." Mu Min scribbled a few strokes in the notebook. "Did you do a sexual assault test?"

"Of course, I am a licensed forensic doctor." Su Wan thrust out her flat chest. "Very strange, negative."

"Why say 'very strange'?"

"The Elder residential area is full of otakus with all kinds of strange and weird ideas in this time-space, and our maids are absolute slaves with no right to life or person—you should understand why I have such imaginative associations."

"Fine, continue." Mu Min said helplessly.

"Because the Elders' hobbies vary, although I had already determined that Lin Xiaoya's hymen was intact, I still did various sexual assault tests I could think of. The results of all tests showed that Lin Xiaoya had not been sexually assaulted before death. In addition, there were no traces of binding, whipping, mild burns, or other similar scars on her body. I didn't detect any semen traces on her clothes or skin."

Su Wan's tone revealed obvious disappointment, making Mu Min couldn't help but shiver again.

"However, there were still findings in the examination of stomach contents." Su Wan took a page of paper from the drawer. "I don't know what they feed them in the Maid School, but it seems they ate a little too well."
