# Chapter 1593 - Double Tap on the Water

"It doesn't matter. Leave it to me." Qian Duoduo didn't care at all and added, "We are rehearsing today too. The ACE of the idol group 'Four Seasons Theater Company' is making an appearance, there has to be some sensational effect. If you enter and exit through the staff door like everyone else, there's no drama at all. Getting off a small boat is so stylish! I told Auntie Panpan that the newspaper office would take pictures of you at the gymnasium pier."

"This... this isn't very good." Zhang Yunmi was a bit shy. "It's a bit too much."

"Not at all, not too much at all. You are preparing to be a big star, okay? Have some self-awareness, will you?" Qian Duoduo simply gave up observing the wind direction and turned her head to explain her "plan" for the five hundredth time:

"...On the day of the performance, you take the *Xiaocang* to the pier of the gymnasium, then get off the boat and walk along the route to the entrance of the gymnasium. The other girls from the Four Seasons Theater Company will welcome you at the bottom of the steps. There will be a large number of people watching on both sides of the street, and reporters taking pictures..."

"Doesn't this become walking the red carpet?" Lin Ziqi interrupted.

"Yes, that's the feeling we want." Qian Duoduo said, "We don't have a red carpet, so let's make do with this first. Anyway, the atmosphere must be grand and enthusiastic..."

While they were talking, Sonia suddenly said, "Someone is waving at us ahead."

Qian Duoduo walked back to the bow and saw a girl lying soaking wet on a wooden platform by the river bank. A female student from Fangcaodi stood by the pier, waving incessantly at the *Xiaocang*.

"What's going on?" Lin Ziqi asked.

"It seems someone fell into the water and is calling for help." Qian Duoduo picked up the binoculars and looked. "They look like naturalized citizens, probably preparing to go to the gymnasium to watch the rehearsal."

"What should we do? Should we pull over?" Zhong Xiaoying was steering the helm.

Qian Duoduo didn't answer. She cupped her hands and shouted loudly, "Hey—what's going on?"

"Drowning—" the female student shouted back, "It's—my—friend. Save us..."

"Okay, wait there, we're coming."

"Pull over," Qian Duoduo said. "We can't leave them to die. My mom taught me first aid for drowning—besides, we are in the middle of nowhere here. Take them and we'll be at East Gate Market in a few kilometers. Hand them over to the police at the water checkpoint then—they have police cars on standby—it kills two birds with one stone and won't delay things. Xiaoying, turn the rudder. Sonia, lower the sail!"

"Alright." Zhong Xiaoying turned the rudder lightly. The *Xiaocang* turned its side and sailed toward the platform.

The *Xiaocang* moved fast. In a moment, it was close to the platform. Seeing that it was about to dock, the "drowning person" who was originally lying on the ground jumped up. Several naturalized men and women holding knives and swords also darted out from the bushes beside the pier and leaped toward the *Xiaocang*.

Qian Duoduo screamed: "Xiaoying, turn the rudder fast!" As she spoke, she pulled out a .357 caliber revolver from the quick-draw holster under her armpit and fired two shots.

*Bang bang.* With two gunshots, two blood flowers blossomed on the assassin's chest. His body went limp, and he fell onto the platform. Qian Duoduo took a step back to open the distance from the assassin. Just then, *thwack thwack thwack*, three flying darts instantly nailed into the deck and mast.

"Get down!" Qian Duoduo shouted while turning the muzzle slightly. Another Double Tap. Another assassin screamed, his body twisting as he fell into the river. Blood instantly floated on the water surface.

Zhong Xiaoying reacted fairly quickly. With a reverse turn of the rudder, the bow of the *Xiaocang* tilted, and the hull immediately veered toward the center of the river. Before the distance could be opened, the last assassin jumped onto the deck, shouting loudly: "Die, Thief!"

Before the word "Die" could fade, Qian Duoduo fired two more consecutive shots. The assassin stumbled and fell into the Wenlan River.

"Quick, drop the sail!" Qian Duoduo shouted again and rolled back into the cabin. These moves were as fast as a rabbit rising and a falcon dropping. Before Lin Ziqi and the others could react, the *Xiaocang* had drifted away, heading for the center of the river.

"Xiaoying, hold the rudder tight!" Qian Duoduo panted, her hands trembling violently. The cylinder she managed to take out of her pocket fell onto the deck with a clatter.

Zhong Xiaoying lay on the helm station, her face pale, but her hands still held the wheel. Hearing Qian Duoduo's command, she responded quickly and straightened the wheel. Sonia and Lin Ziqi also reacted and hurriedly scrambled to raise the sail.

Qian Duoduo changed the cylinder, stood up, and fired several shots at the "female student" and "drowning person" who had already fled. The "female student" stumbled and fell to the ground. The "drowning person" took the opportunity to escape.

"Quick, call Uncle Dongmen." Qian Duoduo put the pistol back into the holster. "There are enemies!"

***

In the Countermeasures Headquarters, Mu Min, who received the latest situation report call, was sweating profusely. The situation was critical. Enemies had attacked a Senator's boat! Although she didn't figure out why Qian Duoduo and the others insisted on taking a boat to the gymnasium without guards for no reason. But the enemy had launched an attack, and according to Qian Duoduo, some assassins were wearing National School uniforms! This coincided with the latest enemy intelligence report just notified more than an hour ago.

The problem was that this intelligence report came too late! Although people from the Political Security Bureau and the Police Bureau were ordered to keep an eye on every "suspect," tracking such things was not 100% certain, and no one expected the other party to disguise themselves as female students.

Female student uniforms were unobtainable on the market: The National Police had once severely cracked down on merchants counterfeiting student and military/police uniforms, basically eliminating such counterfeits.

How did they get them?

The report said that the enemy had obtained a total of three sets of female student uniforms. Since Qian Duoduo had already shot one down, there were two more at large. Perhaps they were already mixed into the student ranks at the gymnasium. If they waited for an opportunity to launch an attack, the scene would definitely be in chaos. Even if the authorities had increased the personal security of the Senators, whether the enemy escaped in chaos or caused mass student casualties, the consequences were unbearable.

There was no time to lose; the net must be closed as soon as possible. Ten minutes ago, Wu Mu notified her that the action team of the Political Security Bureau had moved into the control positions and was ready to arrest suspicious elements.

She picked up the phone: "Connect to the Detective Team! Old Zhou! Get your men moving immediately. Yes, leave no one behind. Everyone enters the duty area. Arrest people according to the list!"

She put down the phone and cranked it a few times forcefully. "Connect to the Fangcaodi Duty Office! Yes, urgent, I need a Senator on the phone!"

It was Yuan Ziguang who answered the phone. Hearing Mu Min say that the faculty of Fangcaodi and the Arts and Science College should go to the scene immediately to screen the students, Yuan Ziguang was flustered instantly. But soon the problem arose: This day happened to be a rest day. Many students did not enter the venue organized by the school. It was obviously not easy to organize students from different schools and classes in a sea of people.

"Then what other way do you have to quickly identify the students?" Mu Min's voice in the phone became hoarse due to tension.

On the other end of the phone, a group of Senators in the education sector were also wiping off sweat. Both Fangcaodi and the Arts and Science College had uniforms, but at this time, photo IDs were limited to powerful departments like the military, police, and political security, and had not been popularized to ordinary students. Relying on student IDs to distinguish true from false students was not very reliable either. Besides, since the enemy had already arrived at the scene, they could launch an attack at any time.

Bai Yu, the head of the Physical Education Teaching and Research Group, spoke slowly: "For this matter, I think we can only test the effect of our disciplinary training on students on weekdays."

***

Zhou Zhongjun and Nan Wan'er, along with several other female disciples, mixed into the square in front of the gymnasium separately. She and Nan Wan'er, wearing student uniforms, tried to get close to the special passage where the Senators would enter, according to Sima Qiudao's instructions.

On both sides of the passage, cordons had been pulled up with ropes, forbidding the masses to cross. There were also many police and Public Security Army soldiers standing guard. However, they did not prohibit naturalized citizens from approaching the passage. Many Fake Aussie students wearing student uniforms gathered on both sides of the passage, chatting excitedly.

There were many people in the square. Although it was not yet a sea of people, some places appeared a bit crowded. Police began to set up barricades at several entrances and exits to restrict and guide the flow of people.

Most of the people in the square were naturalized citizens, and there were also many indigenous commoners watching the excitement. Accents from the south and north mixed together. A few of them mixed in, both excited and afraid. Zhou Zhongjun was especially excited. When Seventh Master sent someone to deliver the student uniforms, she picked the most fitting one for herself first. Combined with her tall figure and dashing posture, she had a unique charm. Zhou Zhongjun intentionally wanted to embarrass Nan Wan'er. She insisted that Nan Wan'er had high martial arts skills and made her dress as a female student, deliberately throwing the shortest set of clothes to her.

Poor Nan Wan'er at this moment: her chest was tight, and the hem of her skirt was above her knees. A slight movement would reveal a large section of her white thighs. She dared not pull the skirt down; the top of the female student uniform was very short and could only roughly cover her waist. If she pulled the skirt down a little, her waist and hips would be exposed, making her appear even more improper and ugly. She had to hunch her body and walk slowly step by step. Nan Wan'er felt like dying—she refused to go out at first, but she held back her tears and went onto the street only after being scolded indiscriminately by Zhou Zhongjun. Seeing Nan Wan'er's embarrassed look, Zhou Zhongjun felt indescribably refreshed in her heart: *Don't you love seducing men? I'll let you seduce enough!*

But walking outside, Nan Wan'er was in the limelight for a while, completely overshadowing herself—almost all men stared at Nan Wan'er straight in the eyes as if they had hysteria. A few handsome guys even got nosebleeds on the spot. the more Zhou Zhongjun walked, the angrier she got. She thought to herself, *This dead slut is so good at seducing men. When we start the uprising later, I must push her to the front to block guns, only then can I relieve the hatred in my heart!*

Just then, a burst of soft music suddenly sounded in the sky, spreading instantly throughout the square. several people were startled, wondering where a band of musicians was hiding and why the music was so loud.
