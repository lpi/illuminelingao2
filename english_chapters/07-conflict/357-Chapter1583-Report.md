# Chapter 1583 - Report

From a high vantage point, Dongfang Ke's gaze was firmly locked on the small group of one man and two women. The fingers of his right hand pinched incessantly, muttering: "Interesting, really interesting."

Zhuo Yifan took out his fan, waved it with feigned chicness, and took the opportunity to look around. Seeing no suspicious circumstances, he felt slightly relieved. Looking at Lian Nishang again, her gaze was focused on the "True Bandit" standing on the high platform, her expression mesmerized. He felt secretly unhappy. Rather than saying he regretted her "obstinacy", it was better to say he faintly felt jealousy.

Lian Nishang was completely different from the women he had contact with—among daughters of the Jianghu, there were those with forthright temperaments, but few were like her, knowledgeable, with her own ideas, able to give a reason for everything.

Although most of the time Zhuo Yifan did not quite agree with her views, deep down he still cherished her "talent" and was even more attracted by her independent and uninhibited character. He often felt that it was truly a casting of pearls before swine for such a woman to become a "Fake Bandit", a pure waste.

It was a pity that he bore a heavy responsibility, the state and society of Great Ming, the safety of millions of common people. He couldn't care about the love between sons and daughters, and could only watch her fall helplessly. Thinking of this, he couldn't help sighing secretly.

While he was sighing, suddenly Zuo Yami, who was sitting on his other side, stood up and waved vigorously. Zhuo Yifan was startled and looked intently. It turned out that another group of students came to the entrance. At a glance, they were all female students, laughing and talking as they walked, their voices crisp and pleasant like orioles and swallows.

Even though Zhuo Yifan was already accustomed to strange things, his mind couldn't help swaying, and he almost dared not look over.

The students who came this time had attire different from the so-called "Fangcaodi" students: all wearing light white short-sleeved tops with dark blue vest-style dresses over them. There was generosity revealed in the elegance, and the temperament was different from the female students of Fangcaodi.

Among the crowd of onlookers, naturalized citizens, and indigenous people, it caused another small commotion. The female students studying in the Women's College of Arts and Sciences now, many had a foundation from the Maid Training Class, so whether in appearance or figure, they were a level higher than the female students of Fangcaodi.

Zhuo Yifan asked: "Where are these students from?"

"They are from the Women's College of Arts and Sciences." Zuo Yami said with some pride, "They are all my junior sisters..."

"Women's Arts and Sciences?" Zhuo Yifan didn't know what "Arts and Sciences" meant, but he still understood "Women" and "College". He couldn't help but be surprised: A school opened specifically for women! What kind of "learning" was this?

At that time, there were so-called "Boudoir Teachers" in Jiangnan and other places, but these were only small-scale "private schools", very few in number. Apart from poetry and books, they taught nothing more than some learning like poetry, lyrics, calligraphy, and painting, so-called "boudoir sentiments", just for style. Apart from becoming topics for scholars and gentry after tea and meals, there was no practical significance. A school like this where fifty or sixty students appeared at once was simply unheard of.

The Bandits not only allowed women to enter school but also specifically set up "Female Schools" and appointed women as officials. What was the intention? Zhuo Yifan couldn't understand. In his opinion, scholars studied hard for ten years, many failed in the imperial examinations all their lives, barely teaching young children or being a copyist to maintain a livelihood reluctantly. What was the use of asking so many women to study? Could it be that the Bandits had been overseas for a long time and learned some witchcraft, wanting to "reverse Qian and Kun" and disturb the Feng Shui of Huaxia?

Thinking of this, Zhuo Yifan couldn't help but have his hair stand on end: If it were really so, the Bandits were not only plotting against the state of Great Ming but also wanting to seize the thousand-year tradition of Huaxia...

In an instant, Zhuo Yifan even had the idea of sacrificing himself to perish together with the Bandits.

Just as he was letting his imagination run wild, he suddenly heard Lian Nishang sigh again, seeming extremely envious: "You have such a good life..."

There seemed to be some resentment in her words. Zhuo Yifan thought to himself, could it be that this Arts and Sciences College is superior to Fangcaodi? Before he could recover, Zuo Yami had already blurted out:

"What good life? In the end, didn't they get screened out just the same?" She pointed to the girls below, "They are the ones with good lives. Seriously studying, don't have to think all day about when to be with a Chief..."

Lian Nishang winked, and Zuo Yami seemed to feel that it was very inappropriate to say these words in front of an "outsider" like Zhuo Yifan, so she abruptly stopped and stuffed a piece of dried squid into her mouth.

Zhuo Yifan's interest rose greatly. He knew that the conversation just now vaguely revealed the secrets of the Bandits. He intended to ask questions to extract information but was afraid of arousing Lian Nishang's alertness.

At this time, he suddenly saw that among the students who came in, seven or eight girls had a black box hanging on their chests, suspended from their necks by a thin leather strap. As soon as they entered the venue, they scattered like little birds: some went straight to the stage, some climbed up to the seats, going straight to the high places, and some wandered in the field. From time to time, these girls would lift the wooden box on their chests to their eyes and shine it at something.

Zhuo Yifan just felt baffled, not knowing what it meant. At this time, he saw a girl with bright eyes and white teeth, tall and slender, waving to Zuo Yami from under the stands. Zuo Yami also waved her hand, then tilted her head towards Zhuo Yifan, and then raised her hand in a scissors shape. While Zhuo Yifan was wondering, he saw the girl below raise the wooden box and "shine" it towards his side.

"Yami, don't forget the rehearsal time!" The girl below put down the box and shouted loudly to Zuo Yami.

"I know, Aili!"

"This is?"

"This is Lin Aili, my junior sister. Is she pretty?" Zuo Yami said with a smile.

According to Zhuo Yifan's view, this female student named Lin Aili certainly had bright eyes, white teeth, and jet-black hair, but her eyes were too big, her nose was a bit high, her legs were too long, and her chest was a bit big. She looked too healthy and too lively... In short, she didn't look like any woman he had seen in the past at all, as if she were a person from another world.

Not only this Lin Aili, but even Lian Nishang, Zuo Yami, and even those ordinary naturalized women on the street, more or less gave him a similar impression.

"Changing Xia with Yi!" This phrase drilled into his mind at once. Suddenly his face changed, but he quickly suppressed his emotions and said perfunctorily: "Indeed a beauty." He asked again: "What is that wooden box of Miss Lin?"

"It's a camera." Zuo Yami said, "Used for taking pictures. It can fix people and scenery on a picture in an instant, looking just like real..."

Zhuo Yifan was instantly horrified—this was simply witchcraft! For a moment he even doubted if his soul had been captured, but secretly circulating his internal energy, his limbs and bones were normal, and his mind was not chaotic, so he felt slightly relieved. He heard Zuo Yami still saying, "...When the photos are developed and printed, I'll ask Aili to print a few more copies, giving you each one."

These words aroused Zhuo Yifan's curiosity again. What exactly did this so-called "picture looking just like real" look like? Although slightly frightened, he was a young man after all and had a strong interest in new things. He closed his fan and smiled:

"Then I'll trouble you."

At noon, the sun shone brightly in Lingao, and pedestrians on the street were sparse.

A tall and thin figure paced to the front of the Political Security Bureau building and took out his ID to show the sentry. After a while, a staff member walked out of the building and led him into the building.

As soon as he walked into the building, a wave of coolness spread throughout his body, and the summer heat dissipated instantly.

"Please come this way, Chief." It was a young Political Security Bureau staff member who came to greet him. The black uniform with blue collar badges was ironed very flat.

Dongfang Ke couldn't figure out their strange rank system: "Mn, thanks."

They walked along the stone-paved corridor. The dull footsteps echoed in the empty corridor. The light and shadow projected from the skylight through the sunshade painted everything with a layer of pale and bright color. The doors in the corridor were tightly closed, with no text except for the numbers on them. At every turn and every staircase entrance, a fully armed guard stood, carrying two revolvers in a cross-draw fashion, looking expressionlessly at everyone passing by.

Dongfang Ke followed the staff member to the third floor. At the end of a corridor was a leather-wrapped door. Walking through the door, inside was a secretary's office. A female secretary in a black uniform stood up immediately.

"This Chief wants to see the Regional Director!" The staff member said concisely.

The female secretary immediately opened the door and walked in. In less than a minute, she walked out again and opened the door to the inner room sideways.

"Please come in!"

"Thanks."

Dongfang Ke walked in, secretly criticizing the pomp of the Political Security Bureau. He was still wearing a linen shirt and washed-out old jeans, the hair rope replaced with a gray one, rarely not wearing headphones.

The room was large, but the decoration was very ordinary, completely in the Spartan style preferred by the Senators. Except for that unusually large desk, there was nothing special.

"Hello, what a rare guest!" Wu Mu behind the desk stood up to greet him. His uniform was exactly the same as the staff member's, even much older. Dongfang Ke still couldn't figure out how to address the rank he wore, but Wu Mu was the number two figure in the Political Security Bureau, one of the most powerful figures in the Senate, this he understood completely.

At this moment, although he was smiling all over his face, more doubt was written on it: obviously, he didn't know why a usually reclusive soy-saucer Senator who had now switched to arts would think of coming to the office to interview him.

"You are too polite."

Dongfang sat down in the chair nonchalantly, then looked straight at the female secretary. The latter stopped asking if tea was needed, immediately turned around, left, and closed the door.

"Director Wu, you'd better prepare a shorthand notebook or recording equipment. I have a situation to report to you."

"What situation?" Wu Mu was a little puzzled: does this mean reporting a Senator planning a coup? "Please speak, I'm listening."
