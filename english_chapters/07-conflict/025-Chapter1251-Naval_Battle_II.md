# Chapter 1251 - Naval Battle (II)

The tension multiplied geometrically. Aboard the *Chèdiàn*, Meng De had already locked the fire control director onto the leading European-style vessel, awaiting only the order to fire from the bridge.

The range closed to 2,500 meters. Meng De heard a deep roar from ahead and looked up—the *Lichun* had already fired the first shot. The flag signal for right-side engagement went up. He bellowed, "High-explosive fire!"

The shells, already primed and waiting, thundered from the barrels. The trailing warships opened fire in sequence. Black smoke clouds and multicolored water columns erupted amidst Zheng Lian's fleet. The battle had begun.

The Zheng family warships immediately returned fire. Every Red Barbarian Cannon aboard belched flame without regard for effective range. Red cannonballs trailing black smoke tumbled through the air toward the First Squadron. Most fell into the sea before coming anywhere close, and the few that reached the fleet's vicinity were still so far off that the splash didn't even wet the First Squadron's decks.

"Not even close," Le Lin muttered, standing on the *Yùfēng's* bridge. He held American naval binoculars to his chest and wore a high-quality replica US Navy summer whites, observing the distant enemy shells. He shook his head with quiet satisfaction, remembering those early days patrolling on fishing boats. His heart swelled with emotion.

Aboard the *Lichun*, Gunnery Chief Ruan Xiaowu was intently hunched over the angle dial sight at the bow, targeting the water column thrown up by the first shell's landing. One hand gripped the massive Zhong-style stopwatch hanging at his chest—as large as an alarm clock—to calculate range. After three months of training, he had just been promoted to this position. Though he was no longer a ship captain, being a department head on such a great black steamship was far superior to commanding a patrol craft. Everyone in the Navy knew that officers and petty officers selected to serve aboard the steam-powered black ships—even ordinary sailors—had bright futures ahead.

Since optical rangefinders were quite high-tech and usable products couldn't be produced for some time, the warships were equipped with artillery rangefinders using a direction-dial system: angle dials with sighting devices were installed at both bow and stern. Using the sighting devices to aim at the target, the difference between the displayed angles at bow and stern was used to calculate the distance between the ship and the target.

The gunnery officer would add a certain distance to this reading and fire the first shot, then fire the second according to the reading, and finally fire the third after subtracting a certain distance from the reading. The range intervals of the three shots were equal and fired in quick succession, allowing rapid ballistic correction based on the points of impact.

Though this ranging method was primitive and the data error-prone, compared to the general standard of this timeline—where range estimation was basically guesswork—it was already alien technology.

"2,350 meters!" he shouted. The fire control room then began calculating the firing solution and adjusting the guns' elevation. Simultaneously, the firing parameters were transmitted to each ship via light signals.

The four gunboats following the *Lichun* opened fire in sequence, their shells converging almost entirely on the European-style ship leading Zheng Lian's fleet. This 700-ton three-masted vessel was almost immediately engulfed in water columns. Suddenly, amid the spray, a flash of fire—a 130mm high-explosive shell struck the hull, tearing through the sturdy planking like paper. Hull fragments flew in all directions, shearing off the heads and arms of seven or eight sailors on deck. Fire immediately broke out.

What followed was increasingly accurate fire from the First Squadron. Within four minutes after that first hit, the ship took two more 130mm shells. Her masts and rigging were destroyed, the entire vessel engulfed in flames, drifting paralyzed on the sea as a massive torch.

In that instant, Zheng Lian knew he had absolutely no chance of winning an artillery duel. He bellowed an order for the fire ships to ignite and charge. But then the next devastating blow arrived—a 130mm high-explosive shell detonated against the flagship's outer hull, several inches thick of oak, tearing open a gaping hole. A massive section of hull plating was hurled into the air, then crashed down onto the deck, killing several sailors instantly. The exposed powder charges on the gun deck ignited in a sympathetic detonation, killing nearly eighty sailors who had been loading and firing in an instant. Flames roared up through the deck gratings.

"Hard to port!" Zheng Lian shouted from the sterncastle. That single shell had shocked him fully awake: forget victory—survival was what mattered now!

But escaping under the First Squadron's fire was no easy matter. Though the 130mm guns had a slow rate of fire and limited hits, the 75mm shells struck hull and deck one after another. Shrapnel flew everywhere, flames roared. The helmsman desperately spun the wheel, the ship lurching 180 degrees to port. The wind, now blowing across the broadside deck, brought more air to feed the white-hot flames spreading everywhere. The opened powder kegs on deck began exploding one after another.

Seeing the magazine detonation inevitable, Zheng Lian abandoned the towering sterncastle and leaped into the sea. In the instant of his jump, flames roared into the magazine. Bright red fire erupted from the deck, followed by a deep explosion. Charred debris spiraled through the air. Then the entire ship exploded violently—the deck tore upward, masts twisted and collapsed inward, canvas was instantly devoured by serpents of fire. Towering smoke and flames engulfed the thousand-ton vessel, black smoke lingering long afterward.



The flagship's fiery explosion shattered the fighting spirit of the other warships. Three-masted gun ships and other *Fuchuan* and *Guang* vessels hastily came about, attempting to flee. But they had arrived with wind and current at their backs; changing direction now was extremely difficult. Compared to the First Squadron, running entirely on steam power, they were dancing naked before the enemy. Each ship seized the opportunity to close distance while pouring fire.

Engines roared frantically, boilers emitted terrifying rumbles, white spray at the bows was immediately sliced apart and crushed by the hulls. The blue-and-white Morning Star flags stood rigid on the masts. Every gun on every warship fired at maximum rate, exploiting this brief advantageous position to pour maximum ammunition on the enemy. Shells trailing red streaks rained down on Zheng Lian's fleet, periodically raising black-red fireballs as scorching fragments whirled through the air.

The 130mm and 75mm high-explosive shells demonstrated terrible power against wooden ships. Hulls several inches thick of hardwood that could withstand solid shot were shredded under explosive attack, torn and burned like paper. Though many shells failed to detonate due to fuze problems, the high initial velocity of the conical projectiles fired from rifled guns easily penetrated bow and hull, causing considerable damage.

Dense smoke from gun discharges periodically shrouded the decks; sea breezes swept the smoke away in waves. Lookouts continuously reported hit status to the bridge.

The battle had effectively become a one-sided shooting demonstration. After five main combatants were successively crippled or sunk, the Zheng fleet had lost combat effectiveness—the remaining vessels were merely trying to escape. But their tactically suicidal turns before the enemy made them perfect targets. Gunners exerted every effort to demonstrate their gunnery skills, hitting, setting ablaze, and sinking one ship after another.

The observation noted that over fourteen vessels had been hit, ten of which were ablaze, with another five having vanished from the sea—either sunk or withdrawn from battle.

More than twenty fire ships that had entered the battlefield lit their fires and began their assault together. The fire ships had wind and current in their favor—highly advantageous—but they were positioned farthest from the First Squadron. When they launched their hasty attack, they were still nearly 3,000 meters away. Even moving at six knots, they were easily evaded by the First Squadron.

"Damn it all!" A headman watched the barbarian ships somehow racing fast against the wind, unable to believe his eyes. What kind of fight was this? Their own ships couldn't even turn, let alone give chase—ramming was out of the question.

Once evaded, pursuing the First Squadron's steam warships moving against wind and current was an impossible task for fire ships relying on wind power for their ramming speed.

Under the strong sea wind, not only could the sailors barely control their ships' turns, but the already-ignited fires were blown ever larger. The scorching air made survival impossible, forcing the crews to abandon ship one after another. The unmanned fire ships drifted aimlessly, blazing fiercely, pushed along by the wind.

At 10:40, Ming Qiu ordered the First Squadron to cease fire and begin turning. Some of Zheng family fleet's ships were drifting ablaze on the water, others had sunk beneath the waves. Except for a few *Fuchuan* and *Guang* vessels at the rear that saw the situation early and turned to flee, Zheng Lian's fleet had been reduced to a tenth of its strength.

The trailing fire ships, unaware of the battle's outcome ahead, entered the battlefield in succession only to see smoke billowing skyward, burning wreckage scattered across the water, and dense gunpowder smoke from cannon fire darkening the entire sea. The fire ship crews were utterly bewildered—they had received prior orders to attack according to flag signals from the flagship, but now the flagship was nowhere to be found, and the enemy's position was unclear.

While they hesitated, a sea breeze swept away some of the smoke blanketing the water. The fire ship crews suddenly witnessed a terrifying sight: the Zheng family's largest warships were burning on the sea, Zheng Lian's flagship already burned down to the waterline. In the distance, five black ships belching black smoke were executing a great turn, waves churning as if sea monsters coiling to spring, preparing to rush in for the kill.

No hesitation was needed. The moment a 130mm shell screamed overhead and fell into the water, every ship came about and scattered in flight. The sailors had come aboard fire ships to fight for wages and pay, for generous bounties—not to throw away their lives for nothing.
