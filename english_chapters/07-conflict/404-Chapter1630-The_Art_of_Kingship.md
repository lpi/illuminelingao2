# Chapter 1630 - The Art of Kingship

"Port wine? There shouldn't be this stuff yet! I recall this thing became famous even later than Cognac!" Liu Xiang asked doubtfully.

Qian Shuixie leaned close to Liu Xiang's ear and whispered, "Manor Owner Lu's vineyard produced wine for the first time this year! Semi-fermented grape juice mixed directly with brandy shipped from Europe. Who knows if this Port counts as locally produced or imported, hehe."

Liu Xiang also knew something about wine. After hearing this, he immediately gave a thumbs up and praised: "ruthless! Willing to put in the effort and capital! But I remember that later Port, Sherry, and so on were all mixed directly with alcohol."

Qian Shuixie said with a look of disdain: "Forget about that kind of black-hearted wine; I wouldn't drink it even if you gave it to me! Besides, 'Brandy shipped from Europe' is a big gimmick. The special supply store is counting on this to recover currency. Minister Hong is jumping up and down, ready to roll up his sleeves and make a big profit."

"You mean his No. 82..."

"Exactly, it has already been approved." Qian Shuixie nodded. "Of course, currently it's still positioned as an industry under the General Office."

Hearing that it was that Minister Hong's private venture, Liu Xiang nodded and didn't elaborate on this matter. He just joked, "Why not 'invent' glass bottles and corks too, and export the wine back! In the future, Port wine won't have anything to do with Oporto!"

This sentence didn't need to be hidden, so his voice was louder. Sonia, who was sipping the fine wine in her cup, caught a snippet and heard the familiar place name "Oporto." She stared blankly at the two Senators for a long time, then shook her head very disappointedly and said, "Oporto (Porto) and the entire Douro River basin produce good wine, but they don't have this kind of taste either. Besides, I really can't imagine transporting wine across half the globe to the Far East... From the wine producing area closest to the New World in the outer sea, the port of Madeira, to Pernambuco, it takes about 60 days for a ship with a tailwind. Guaranteeing that half of the wine barrels don't turn into sour and smelly waste would be considered God's grace..."

Liu Xiang smiled faintly and said, "That is because you neither understand the reason why wine becomes sour and rotten, nor do you master more advanced navigation technology."

As Liu Xiang spoke, he fished out a lamb chop from the plate. As a foodie who couldn't enjoy a meal without meat, how could he not eat meat with the first chopstick?

"We indeed master a method that can transport wine over long distances, and it's not strong liquor like brandy, but freshly brewed sweet wine. However, this is a major commercial secret. You can imagine the interests represented behind this. Let alone the Far East and colonies around the world, just shipping it to England or Northern Europe, the profits would be enough to create countless tycoons." Liu Xiang bragged wantonly while gnawing on the meat chunk. "As for navigation technology, the Two Teeth, oh, no, it's the entire Iberian Peninsula, has begun to fall behind comprehensively. Just over ten years ago, a medium-sized ship transported some Puritans who refused to acknowledge the Church of England from Plymouth to the pioneer lands in the north of the New World, taking only 66 days! While you are still using heavy galleons as slow as turtles to crawl across the Atlantic..."

For some reason, Liu Xiang's desire to perform was particularly strong today. Soon the topic shifted from the clumsy shape of the galleon to the disastrous defeat of the Spanish Armada in the "last century," then traced back from the development of ship types in the Britain-Northern Europe region to the Nordic trade in the Hanseatic period. Then he mocked the bizarre European policy of collecting taxes based on deck area, subsequently praised the Fluyt invented by the Dutch at the "end of the last century" specifically to deal with such policies, and finally talked at length about the advanced nature of deep-V section design and watertight compartments...

Qian Shuixie wondered secretly, *Why is Liu Xiang trying so hard to show off these things? Does he have any ideas about Sonia?* Seeing the naturalist's face full of adoration and reverence, he couldn't help but worry secretly: *Old Lin might strike him with lightning directly.*

When Liu Xiang mentioned that he brought a "design" model of a high-speed ship that "takes only 90 days from Lingao to London" this time, Qian Duoduo finished the food in her bowl in three bites, then strongly demanded to see the small model of the 66-centimeter "Cutty Sark" ("Short Shirt") that Liu Xiang bragged about just now. Sonia also expressed that she must see it... In short, by the second half of the meal, only Liu Xiang, Qian Shuixie, Little Zhang, and Little Lin were left at the table.

Once the bragging finished and the topic stopped, there seemed to be a bit of silence. What was even weirder was that Zhong Xiaoying was sent away by Zhang Yunmi at the end. What was this for?

The scene was quiet for a while, about the time it takes to eat two lamb chops, before Zhang Yunmi organized her language.

"Teacher... Liu, I remember you lectured about economics when you taught us before, right!"

Liu Xiang's face twitched when he heard this—at that time he "lectured about economics," and because of this issue, he was criticized several times in *Morning Star*, accused of "poisoning the next generation of Senators."

"Why is this girl bringing this up now?" Liu Xiang wondered in his heart.

"Last week... Supervisor Ma... Uncle gave us a weekend special class on political economy, and finally left several economics articles for us to write our own reflections after studying them..." Zhang Yunmi became more and more embarrassed as she spoke. After all, this belonged to asking someone to do her homework.

"Yeah, yeah, what was given to Little Zhang was even the original text in Bird Language [English], too pitiful..." Little Lin chimed in from the side.

"Weekend special class?" Liu Xiang looked at Qian Shuixie doubtfully. Qian Shuixie explained briefly. This special class was indeed on the "weekend," actually a class opened separately for the Junior Senators every Saturday. One should know that naturalized citizens rested two days a month. The only ones who could spend Saturday as a weekend holiday were the children from the original timeline. This day was mainly for teaching some content not suitable for large class instruction, such as all political, economic, and technological content involving the "historical events that have not yet happened" in this spacetime. It wasn't expected that these Junior Senators would become proficient in these, but just to cultivate them so that they would be closer to other "older uncles" in ideology rather than becoming more and more like local naturalized citizens. This could also be considered "aristocratic education" in another sense, or "The Art of Kingship"?

*Supervisor Ma attaches great importance to the ideological education of the Junior Senators!*

"What aspect? You didn't understand it or you don't have a train of thought?" Liu Xiang responded.

Not understanding it was a problem of knowledge structure, or at least a problem of professional vocabulary—if it was literature in Bird Language, it was basically hard to understand for non-professionals. And lacking a train of thought was easier to handle. Having spent time on several high-level forums in the original timeline, he knew a thing or two about economics as a hot topic. At least he could ask "Did you pay tax" after someone smugly finished telling the story of economists eating shit.

"My few English articles are about Neoliberalism in South America." Just as Zhang Yunmi finished answering, Little Lin rushed to say: "Mine are all about South Africa."

Hearing Lin Ziqi's description, Liu Xiang and Qian Shuixie looked at each other and found a burst of confusion in each other's eyes.

"Duoduo has to write too?" Qian Shuixie followed up with a question.

"Yeah, it seems to be a very obscure topic, Walloon something?" Little Lin responded.

Qian Shuixie rang the silver bell on the dining table, and Qian Xuanhuang came in. Not long after receiving instructions, Qian Duoduo returned to the dining room alone with thousands of reluctance.

"The topic sent to me is the industrial decline of the Walloon region and the separatist tendencies of the Flemish people."

Qian Shuixie was completely confused hearing this: "This difficulty is a bit too high."

"Do you know anyone else's?" Liu Xiang didn't answer Qian Shuixie directly but asked another question.

"Zhuo Xiao... Shou... er... Min's is about something called the 'Prussian Path'." Little Lin accidentally slipped her tongue.

Zhang Yunmi nodded and said: "The ones in the hands of other classmates are about the Homestead Act, something about Northern Italy... Oh right, Uncle Ma also told us that if we can't figure it out, we should go to the Grand Library to look up materials more often, or ask other uncles who 'understand economics and history'."

Zhang Yunmi added special emphasis to the tone when saying the second half of the sentence.

"The Supervisor is indeed bullying people a bit!" Liu Xiang called out the nickname carelessly. "The logic is a bit convoluted. Yunmi, you have to write this article in reverse. Don't write about the medicine of 'Neoliberalism,' but write about the disease this medicine is meant to cure." Liu Xiang then explained the concept of "Developmentalism" originally implemented in Latin America to Zhang Yunmi in detail.

"...The fundamental goal is industrialization, breaking the unequal 'Center-Periphery' international economic structure dominated by developed countries. Industrialization relies on three major means: large-scale investment, implementation of protectionist policies and strict foreign exchange controls, and adjustment of policies on taxation, wages, profits, and employment to encourage the development of domestic enterprises. In the process of industrialization, 'Import Substitution' must be carried out to get rid of dependence on the international market, especially on products from developed countries, form one's own production capacity, and achieve economic independence. Here it needs to be explained that when Latin America began to engage in import substitution successively from the 1930s, due to historical reasons, foreign capital occupied a dominant position, unlike China where they all ran away once the revolution happened. So China started learning manufacturing from scratch without foreign capital's business, while Latin America was substitution, targeting foreign capital."

However, putting it into this spacetime, the only "foreign capital" that could export industry seemed to be this one and no other! The Senate in this spacetime was not in the position of Latin American countries, but in the position of a developed country!

*The Supervisor's thinking has changed?!*

For some reason, a bizarre image suddenly appeared in Liu Xiang's mind: Queen Du glaring with angry eyes, raising a fist the size of a clay pot, and the fist blooming with billions of rays of light.

Actually, Liu Xiang knew from the beginning that no matter how much everyone approved of land reform on the surface, when it came down to it, since they were willing to time-travel, Liu Xiang absolutely didn't believe that they didn't have thoughts of "private ownership of land." Don't look at how everyone said Dafa of Land Reform is good; most people treated land reform as a "technique," a "technique" used to establish the "Human Empire" of the Senate.
