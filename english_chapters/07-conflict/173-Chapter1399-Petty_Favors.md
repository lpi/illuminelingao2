# Chapter 1399 - Petty Favors

"Yes! Attacking Phoenix Mountain Villa this time, inevitably there will be deaths and injuries. Leaving aside healing and compensation, presumably Master certainly has arrangements. But killing people in the villa, we cannot but give an explanation to the government above. This money for buying lives cannot be spared."

If people to take the blame for lives were not arranged well, this group of Fighting Society people wouldn't be willing to exert deadly effort either. A life for a life, they still understood this most basic principle.

"This is easy to say. How much money needed?"

"Forty taels for one person. At least prepare ten lives."

Elder Shi seemed to think it expensive: "This requires four hundred taels of silver!"

Four hundred taels of silver was absolutely not a small number. A soldier dying in battle, compensation was only ten taels, family members could get even less.

"Thirty taels of silver for one life, ten taels is fee for bribing." Cao Guangjiu explained carefully. Taking the blame and dying for others, not only needed to buy the person's life, but from magistrate to jailers in prison, clerks in criminal room... every layer needed money to bribe. Otherwise if making things difficult slightly then, a big case would burst out immediately. So this bribing fee was indispensable.

"Good, follow you."

July 15th hadn't arrived, yet undercurrents were already surging in whole Hangzhou City. City foxes and society rats seemed to have smelled some flavor. Some rubbing fists and wiping palms, preparing to fish in troubled waters, looting a big one; some stayed out of matter, unwilling to wade through this muddy water.

In Phoenix Mountain Villa, outside loose inside tight. Not only Infantry Squad drilled every day, double sentries day and night, but lookout tower was also set up on mountain top, monitoring surrounding movements constantly.

Zhao Yingong and Zhao Tong both knew clearly enemy's attack action would happen very soon. But exactly which day, how many people, how to attack, were all unknown numbers. Relying on Xihua to find out.

However this Jia Le since contacting Xihua two or three times, had no more movement. Although sending people to monitor secretly day and night, didn't find any move of contacting outside.

From situation of two people's talk reported by Xihua, Jia Le was obviously striving to persuade Xihua to defect and be insider. But in talk never touched upon "benefit" of being insider.

According to general rules, asking people to be insider, firstly must have huge benefit, secondly must have future way out. But Jia Le never mentioned these two things.

From Xihua's report, Jia Le instead constantly "explained righteousness," emphasizing Zhao Yingong was a "people-harming" "autocrat enemy of people." This inevitably made people somewhat cry and laugh.

However, this instigation method made Zhao Yingong unable to figure out: What route was this opponent exactly? What use sending a little girl to say these empty boring words?

Xihua was indeed a girl with strong sense of justice, but Zhao Yingong also deeply believed she wouldn't be moved by parrot-learning words heard from nowhere by a little girl.

Zhao Tong sent to inquire about Charity School's teacher finally found a little clue through bribing and kidnapping threat: That teaching gentleman opening Charity School was named Hao Yuan, lived in Nanxiawa for almost a year, had high popularity in Nanxiawa. He lived next door to Jia Le's home. Usually interacted with Jia family frequently, but also limited to this.

This Hao Yuan suddenly left Nanxiawa ten or so days ago, whereabouts unknown. Zhao Tong sent several people sneaking into house he left behind at midnight to search, result gained nothing. Zhao Tong calculated, time Hao Yuan left Nanxiawa was exactly day Jia Le entered Villa. Obviously, Jia Le was just a message carrier role. Message carried, she became an abandoned piece.

Even if arresting her to torture, wouldn't gain anything. What she knew was same as what Zhao Tong knew. Zhao Tong then proposed secretly executing Jia Le or transferring to Taiwan for "labor reform."

"Still, temporarily still keep her." Zhao Yingong shook head, "Since she came, inevitably has other uses, absolutely won't just be a message carrier. We'll just see how big ability this Hao Yuan has. Send people continue staring at her—and Xihua!"

"Chief, next this whatever Hao Yuan will certainly try to meet Xihua. Want to catch him then?"

"Of course not catch. Hao Yuan is still a pawn, running and organizing under instruction only. Behind him definitely still has big figure. Catching him is of no big use, only alarming snake by beating grass. You stare at him, take him as line, dig out all black hands behind, catch all in one net, leaving not inch of grass!" Zhao Yingong said viciously, expression somewhat manic. These days he was tortured by invisible pressure to sleep and eat uneasily, cheeks thin, eyes surrounded by a black circle.

He already telegraphed Executive Committee, requesting to mobilize Special Reconnaissance Team detachment in Kaohsiung, preparing to conduct a thorough "targeted elimination" action in Hangzhou.

"Tell Xihua, these days definitely someone will meet her still. Let her be reserved. Don't agree too quickly. I see enemy is very not simple."

This day, Xihua was calculating accounts in Charity School of Cihui Hall—she was not only principal of Orphanage, but also teacher, nanny, simultaneously managing logistics and finance.

"Miss Xihua, a Manager Niu from Maoxing Firm came, saying coming to check accounts with you."

"Invite him in." Xihua didn't mind. July 15th coming soon, another month would be Mid-Autumn, one of "Three Festivals." Every shop needed to settle accounts, debts needed to be cleared.

Maoxing Firm was a local grocery firm, specially supplying Phoenix Mountain Villa. Orphanage of Cihui Hall had a special account book in this mulberry firm.

Children were always manpower resource Council of Elders valued most. No matter where, there was always policy inclination towards "Council of Elders' children." Whether living treatment, health care or cultural education, enjoying best tier among naturalized citizens. Therefore interaction with Maoxing Firm was much.

Although Hangzhou didn't have this condition, orphans in Orphanage were still "upper class people" among refugees. Expenses also biggest.

"Miss Xihua well." Walking in was a young man, dressed neatly, behaving elegantly, very much like a "senior partner" of a big shop.

"Well, Manager He well?" Xihua felt comer very strange, not usual assistant of Maoxing Firm, couldn't help being somewhat strange, "Sit."

"He old man well. Thanks for seat." Young man posture unrestrained, lightly lifted robe hem sitting down.

Xihua was waiting for him to check accounts, yet saw this person taking out account book putting on tea table then didn't come to check. While wondering, suddenly heard him open mouth saying: "Is child Jia Le still usable?"

Xihua instantly felt heart tighten, took a deep breath, slowly said: "Still usable talent, just sometimes inevitably self-smart."

"She is after all a child, has a little petty cleverness, inevitably gets carried away. Thanks to Miss for tolerating." Young man smiled slightly, "Long heard Miss Xihua's name, seeing today, truly fortunate for three lives."

"Save flattery words. What matter coming here?"

"At humble service Hao Yuan. Exactly Jia Le's teacher." Hao Yuan said very calmly, "Presumably Miss also knows why I come here."

"Matter you want to do, I definitely won't do." Xihua expressionless, "I advise you better leave here quickly. I know you are a man with benevolence righteousness and responsibility, unwilling you trapped in it. You go quickly."

"Miss indeed has benevolence righteousness and character bone!" Hao Yuan praised, "Person like Miss, doing things for Zhao Yingong, that is helping tyrant do evil."

"Master has grace and righteousness to me."

"This is petty grace and petty righteousness." Hao Yuan said seriously.

"Petty grace and petty righteousness? Could it be you have great grace and great righteousness to people?" Xihua sneered, pointing out window, "Tens of thousands refugees outside, which one not relying on Master Zhao's grace righteousness to live in world barely. These many children originally all dying of cold and hunger, now worry-free about food and clothing here, still have books to read. Could it be your grace righteousness?"

Hao Yuan wasn't angry at all: "At humble service naturally doesn't have Master Zhao's such financial power. If discussing doing good, Master Zhao also counts as first person in Hangzhou, no, perhaps whole Jiangnan."

"Since you know, why want me to do thing disadvantageous to employer?" Xihua said, "This Villa is where food and clothing of how many people lie. Once Villa destroyed, where do these people rely on? Could it be all responsible by you?"

"At humble service is only a small teacher. Such heavy responsibility, naturally can't bear."

"Then what else do you have to say?"

"Food and clothing of these tens of thousands people certainly important. Good deeds done by Master Zhao also can be called magnificent feat. Only has Miss thought, where do these gold mountains silver mountains, rice mountains cloth mountains come from?" Hao Yuan unhurriedly opened fan, shaking gently, "Master Zhao neither turns stone to gold, nor has a cornucopia at home. This money always can't be falling from sky right."

"What strange about this. Master good at operation and growing wealth."

"Operation growing wealth, using principal seeking profit. These are all proper meaning. Only Master Zhao's operation growing wealth, is earning black-hearted money against conscience. Earning not silver, but people's fat and blood!" Hao Yuan changed smiling calm look, said seriously. He subsequently lowered voice, "What Zhao Yingong did in Hangzhou, everyone can see. Could it be only Miss can't see?" His hand pointed out window, "You only see how many refugees he took in, how many starved corpses he saved. Don't look at how many common people he personally caused to become starved corpses!"

"Full of nonsense!" Xihua pulled face scolding, "You such big guts! Dare run here to talk nonsense! I just greet one sound now, there will be no such person as you in world!"

"Planning for poor people under heaven, what fear does Hao have?" Hao Yuan showed no expression, "Just a naked body coming and going without worry. If Miss wants to take, Hao also has no complaint—die in proper place."

Hao Yuan cupped hands: "Miss Xihua calm down. Zhao Yingong has grace to you is true. To you to everyone in this Phoenix Mountain Villa can be called grace heavy as mountain. But have you thought, these tens of thousands people in Phoenix Mountain Villa eating full wearing warm, is how many outside poor people's fat and cream?!" He face serious, "Clothes you wear, rice you eat, books read to children, paper ink used... Do you know how many common people sold land went bankrupt for this?"
