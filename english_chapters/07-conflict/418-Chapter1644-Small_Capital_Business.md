# Chapter 1644 - Small Capital Business

In the afternoon, Zhang Yu walked home, his steps getting lazier with each step. Just as he reached the tea house at the street corner, he heard someone calling him: "Young Master! Here, here." Looking quickly, it turned out to be the storyteller in the tea house.

Sitting down at the table, the storyteller ingratiatingly pushed over a steamer of char siu bao: "Young Master, eat buns, eat buns."

Zhang Yu always saved money by not eating breakfast, so he ate heartily. Waiting until he was full and satisfied with tea, the storyteller then handed over a copy of *Story Assembly* with a face full of smiles. This storyteller was semi-illiterate, so he always asked Zhang Yu to read these marketplace readings as sources for his storytelling.

Zhang Yu flipped to the serialized *Entertainment Tycoon* and read in a low voice: "Last time we said that Young Master Guanxi sent the book chest for repair, but actually lost the several hundred erotic portrait pictures in the secret compartment. It caused a sensation for a time, and Miss Jiaojiao was so ashamed and resentful she almost wanted to commit suicide..."

After reading, it took a long time for the storyteller to wake up and wipe his drool: "These Australians indeed have many tricks. Are there any more explosive ones?"

Zhang Yu flipped through: "How about this marketplace strange news: *Sea and Heaven Feast Crowd of Warblers Gathering, Xin'an County Cellar Hiding Slaves Case*."

After reading the book, the storyteller stuffed ten *wen* of copper coins to Zhang Yu. Added to what he saved from not eating breakfast these days, it was enough for the next issue of *War History Research*. Zhang Yu's steps became lighter too.

Seeing her son return, his mother, who was sulking in the shop, couldn't help showing a smile. She followed behind asking endlessly about his studies, and even brought a pot of hot tea and a plate of freshly baked walnut cookies. Zhang Yu wanted to go downstairs to help his father crack walnuts and knead dough, but his mother wouldn't let him: "Young man just concentrate on studying." Then she chattered on about how business was hard to do, how runners swindled another few hundred *wen*, so today was equivalent to working for free. "Look at the young master of the tailor shop in the east, he passed the *xiucai* exam, and runners and beggars dare not come anymore. Our family's hope is all on you."

"Must pass the *xiucai* exam!" Mother left. Zhang Yu opened *Selected Essays of the Times* with a face full of solemnity. The thirteenth topic was a "truncated connection" topic, and an inexplicably "heartless connection" at that: "The gentleman's wife Yang Huo desires". Reading the baffling topic breaking, the rambling topic receiving, and the empty initial lecture, Zhang Yu felt waves of stuffiness and boredom in his heart. He really couldn't read on, so he pushed the book away casually.

Although the vow to pass the *xiucai* exam was still echoing in his ears, Zhang Yu couldn't help taking a copy of *War History Research* from his book chest. Although he had read it through several times, reading it again was still so fresh and exciting. Flipping to the new book advertisement on the back cover: *Australian Song Science Fiction Masterpiece Shines on Stage! A Work of Vomiting Blood by a Sci-Fi Master! A Masterpiece You Must Read This Year! A Wonderful Adventure Shocking the Soul! Australian Song Publishing House's Dedicated Presentation!* Stroking the book title *From the Earth to the Moon*, looking at the advertisement picture of a shuttle in front of a giant ball full of pits, Zhang Yu was full of curiosity. He had read fantasy novels; *War History Research* was currently serializing a political fantasy novel *Diary of a Conquered People*, telling the story of the Sun Moon Dynasty being invaded and conquered by the barbarian Shuiqing Kingdom. Discerning people knew at a glance this was talking about Great Ming. However, officials didn't act if people didn't sue. No one meddled to report to officials. Those who meddled also sniffed at it: "How could Great Ming perish at the hands of the Jurchen? And the Divine Land sinking for three hundred years? Absurd, absurd." But Zhang Yu had never read science fiction novels. His heart was really itching unbearably. Only the price of this book made him waver. Although since the Australians came, they beat the old bookstores to pieces and book prices fell by several tenths, he could only rely on a little pocket money from his parents. These Australians kept bringing out new things, showing new Australian films one moment, picture books the next. Just relying on saved breakfast money and the few copper coins earned from reading storybooks to the storyteller was simply not enough to spend.

Thinking of Shixin's words, his heart was also filled with confusion. Actually, how many in the community school could pass the *xiucai* exam? Most parents sent their sons to school just wanting them to learn a few characters and be able to read account books. Even if he didn't continue studying, thinking of inheriting this small shop and managing it for a lifetime made him feel lost. Since the hair-people came, he learned that besides the Four Books and Five Classics, there was such a vast universe. In his mother's words, his heart had gone wild. The only golden bright road he originally thought of now seemed narrow and closed. "Otherwise call Shixin and run to Lingao?" A thought appeared in Zhang Yu's heart.

Zhang Yu was quickly startled by his own thought. Run to the hair-bandits! He knew well he couldn't do such a bold thing. Those who ran to the bandits, earlier on, were all families with no food or clothing, with no way out, treating going to Lingao to join bandits and shave heads as the last choice to save their lives; later, some bitter craftsmen and peddlers coveted that jobs were easy to find and business easy to do there, so they went to Lingao; right now, a third kind of people was added, all down-and-out scholars like Mr. Wu who failed in studies, couldn't bear outsiders' sneers and poverty, went down in anger leaving brave words like "If no place keeps the lord, the lord goes to be a hair-bandit," and ran to Lingao to seek a minor official position.

Although the Zhang family's days weren't considered affluent, at least they didn't worry about food and clothing. Guarding this ancestral old shop, even if he didn't pass the *xiucai* exam, probably he would just continue managing the shop like his Old Dad, marry a wife and have children—just like Grandfather and Old Dad. This walnut cookie old shop, his father was already the fourth generation. Mother said every time, to keep a shop open until it became a century-old shop was truly harder than passing the *jinshi* exam.

However, thinking of his future life, Zhang Yu felt it was devoid of interest: having to get up at the first crow of the rooster every day to do business. When business paused at noon, still had to go out to purchase ingredients, deliver goods and collect bills from various tea houses and big households. The trivial and difficult matters therein were numerous. After the evening market was done, had to prepare ingredients for tomorrow. Couldn't sleep until the second watch was struck. Working from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve, day after day, year after year.

As Zhang Yu grew older, he gradually knew the difficulty of livelihood. Especially after going to bed at night, hearing parents' conversation next door before sleep: always about business being difficult, prices of everything outside soaring, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies being numerous; talking about family expenses, again sighing and groaning. In Mother's words: "In recent years, gradually even the lining has come up."

Thinking that his life, though not affluent but at least carefree, had the possibility of becoming unlivable, it was like snakes and insects biting his heart. In these years, among schoolmates in the community school and neighbors in the block, quite a few shops went bankrupt: hanging themselves, jumping into rivers, selling sons and daughters, reduced to beggars and prostitutes... He had seen them all. Several schoolmates in the community school disappeared after their families declined. Some barely still came to school, in tattered clothes, shrinking in the corner daring not speak. Because they had no money to gift teachers or socialize with classmates, even teachers, senior students, and schoolmates despised them. This was considered good. Some were said to be sold to gigolo houses to receive guests. Someone saw him wearing women's clothes, head full of pearls and emeralds...

Every time Zhang Yu thought of this, he broke out in cold sweat... He also knew a thing or two about the passion of the cut sleeve. There was also such a trend in school, mostly older students with some money in the family being friendly with younger and pretty junior students. Even teachers didn't mind. Schoolmates occasionally cracked jokes, not considered a big deal. But this was completely different from wearing women's clothes, dressing up as a woman to accompany drinking and receive guests...

While he was letting his imagination run wild, he heard Mother shouting angrily downstairs again, followed by crackling sounds and the apprentice's screams begging for mercy. When business was good before, the shop used two or three hired hands. Now they only used apprentices who ate but didn't take money. Even so, Mother still nagged about the apprentice "eating too much," "stealing food," and never gave a good face.

Zhang Yu felt upset and confused, simply stopped reading, went downstairs and saw Mother's anger hadn't dissipated yet, and the little apprentice had already scurried away holding his head. He comforted: "Mother, don't be anxious. Hurting your own body. Just punish him not to eat."

Only then did Mother's face clear up a bit. Stroking her son's head she said: "Doesn't matter. Does hitting him a few times hurt my hand?" She looked indignant: "True-truly no law anymore. His old mother actually told me to give some money for shaving head and bathing. I haven't charged for the rice he ate here these years! Asking me for money for shaving head and bathing?!"

Zhang Yu hurriedly advised: "Mother, isn't it our word whether to give or not. If she wants to say it, let her say it."

Mother sighed: "Silly child, would Mother get angry over this little thing? Look at the good deed he did!" She became indignant again, "Told him to peel walnut skins, and he didn't pick them clean. Making them into walnut cookies will have a bitter taste. Old customers will know as soon as they eat. How can our business continue?"

Making walnut cookies required walnuts. Guangdong didn't produce walnuts; they had to be imported from North-South goods firms. Originally their family used fresh goods of the current year. Now business was much worse than before, and walnut prices rose again. So they started using cheap stale goods.

Stale walnuts tasted inferior to fresh goods, so the shop mixed the two to use, having fragrance while ensuring enough quantity. Only the inner skin of these stale walnuts must be picked clean, otherwise the taste would easily turn bitter. After peeling off the inner skin, residues in the indented places had to be picked out bit by bit with a sewing needle. This was routinely the apprentice's work at night. However, the Zhang family shop only had this one apprentice in total. Working on miscellaneous chores all day, and having to peel walnut skins under the lamp at night—naturally couldn't do it thoroughly.

"This is a major matter concerning our shop's reputation. Mother, you are right to teach him a lesson." Zhang Yu nodded repeatedly, "If indulged for a moment, the consequences would be unimaginable."

"Yu'er, you are really much more sensible." Mother couldn't help sighing, "Just don't know if your father has the ability to pass the shop to you..."

"Why?" These words were simply a bolt from the blue for Zhang Yu. For a moment, the experiences of several schoolmates flooded into his mind.

"Yu'er, you are also grown up. You should know a thing or two about family matters." Mother sighed and told him to sit down, "You surely know the Australian's Great World outside the city."

"Yes, child knows." Zhang Yu nodded, "Looks like it will be finished soon."

"Now the Great World is inviting merchants. It is said many shops will be opened. Eating, drinking, playing, everything." Mother was worried, "Heard that Australians themselves will also open shops inside—among them is a tea food shop."
