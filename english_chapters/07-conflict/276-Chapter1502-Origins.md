# Chapter 1502 - Origins

Lin Ming's perilous journey could be called an exercise in "enduring humiliation for the greater good." Though in Foshan he was merely a probationary centurion of a minor Hundred Household office—barely qualifying as an "official" at the very bottom of the Ming military hierarchy, scarcely worth mentioning if he were an ordinary military household—fortunately, the title "Brocade Guard" still carried considerable weight in the late Ming. Everyone showed him three measures of deference.

This time, he had posed as a hand aboard ship, and rather than sail directly to Lingao, he had taken this roundabout route precisely to ensure a safer infiltration. He had truly immersed himself in the role—not only scrambling to do all the hard labor but also sparing no effort in flattery. His face had darkened from the sun, his skin roughened; gradually, he had worn away the "official air" and "young master's manner" that clung to him.

After several months shuttling across the seas on various ships, Lin Ming felt the time was ripe. He told the captain he wanted to go to Lingao to seek his fortune with the Australians—this was no longer unusual in Guangdong and Fujian. A considerable wave of active migration to Lingao had already emerged, with people crossing the sea every day to "submit to the Cropped-Hairs." After settling his wages, he disembarked in Kaohsiung.

Disembarking at Kaohsiung was something he had calculated carefully—he had visited here more than once and was quite familiar with the situation, having gained a general understanding of the Cropped-Hairs' ways. Moreover, many ships traveled between here and Lingao, and Dayuan was also close by. Both places had many Ming merchant vessels, and they usually recruited additional crew before departure, making it easy to slip aboard.

Now, below deck on *Dongshan Residence*, his eyes gleamed as he considered his next move.

"Young fellow, what are you thinking about?" Manager Liu returned with the evening meal.

"Nothing—nothing at all." Lin Ming dissembled, and seeing that Manager Liu had already brought dinner, hurried to stand. "Manager Liu, I should have fetched that..."

"You've just arrived and don't know your way around the ship. What if I sent you and you dropped it in the sea?" Manager Liu squinted and smiled. "I know you're a lettered man, so you must play chess—after dinner, keep this old fellow company for a few games."

"I'm hardly a lettered man..." Lin Ming hastened to deny it.

"Young fellow, you can't fool me. Not only are you a lettered man, but your family background probably wasn't bad either." Manager Liu opened a cupboard and took out a wine pot and cups.

"One's not supposed to drink aboard ship, but this old fellow's getting on in years and needs a few sips to warm the blood—call it an old man's privilege. I won't offer you any."

"Manager Liu, please go ahead. I understand the ship's rules." Lin Ming quickly changed the subject.

Fortunately, after Manager Liu poured his wine, he did not pursue the matter of family background. Only then did Lin Ming breathe easy. He looked at the food in the dish—unexpectedly excellent! Even more surprising, Manager Liu and he were eating the same fare. The provisions aboard *Dongshan Residence*, even for the owners and the captain, differed little from those of ordinary sailors and hands. In his months on ships, he had eaten only enough to fill his belly. At first, the coarse fare was nearly indigestible, and it took a long time to accustom himself.

But the provisions on *Dongshan Residence* were remarkably good. Not only were the vegetables fresh—understandable, since they had just left port—there were even fish and shrimp. In all these months, despite spending nearly every day aboard ships, Lin Ming had rarely eaten proper fish or shrimp, only salty, foul-smelling dried fish and pickled shrimp, portioned out so stingily he could not imagine where the captains had procured them.

"How is it? The food on our ship is good, isn't it? Our master is a generous man." Manager Liu could not resist boasting on his employer's behalf. "Where else do you see a captain feeding his crew this well?"

In fact, Chen Huamin and Liu Deshan had absorbed some Australian ideas and provided their subordinates with somewhat better provisions and wages than other maritime merchants. Shortly after implementing this policy, they discovered that "better treatment for fewer hands" proved more cost-effective than "low pay for a large crowd." *Dongshan Residence* employed only half the crew of a comparable Ming merchant vessel, yet the labor costs per voyage had actually decreased by a third.

"Manager Liu speaks truly. It's all thanks to the two masters' benevolence." Lin Ming had by now cultivated the habit of agreeing with whatever anyone said.

Having eaten no decent meal in months, Lin Ming devoured this "feast" like wind sweeping through fallen leaves, leaving nothing behind, even mixing the last drops of sauce with rice and eating that too. After finishing, he poured a bowl of water and rinsed his mouth.

Manager Liu took a sip of wine and laughed, "And you say you're not a lettered man! What ordinary hand eats like that? The sauce—that would be licked clean with the tongue, never mind rinsing one's mouth afterward. Even our Master Liu doesn't have such habits."

Lin Ming silently groaned. He had not expected that months of hardship would fail to erase the traces of his former life. If this old fellow could see through him, could the Cropped-Hairs not? He began to feel somewhat discouraged.

His dejection showed on his face, and Manager Liu, thinking he had touched some sore spot, offered consolation. "Young fellow, don't be downcast. You're still young and have strength in your arms. Now that the seas are peaceful, if you work hard, riches may be hard to come by, but making a modest living should still be possible."

Lin Ming suddenly had a flash of insight. He realized that no matter how he tried, the traces of his past life could never be completely erased. Lingao was not like this ship; sailors and hands came and went freely, a motley gathering where nobody meddled in others' affairs. The Cropped-Hairs, he had heard, loved to dig into backgrounds. Every clue would surely be noticed.

Manager Liu's words, though seemingly just an old man's rambling kindheartedness, also carried the intent of "sounding him out."

If he could not give a satisfactory answer, he would not earn their trust. This ship was built in an Australian shipyard; the captain's relationship with the Cropped-Hairs was surely deep. If, upon reaching Lingao, word were whispered to the Cropped-Hairs, he would die without a burial place! It seemed that this evasive pose of a pauper would not do—he needed to fabricate a plausible background to deflect suspicion.

Thinking thus, his mind was made up. His brain worked through several turns, and he already had a script ready. Deliberately sighing, he said, "Manager Liu, your eyes are sharp indeed! I won't hide it from you—my family did once have a modest property. Though not wealthy, we wanted for nothing. But my parents passed away early..." At once, tears streaming, he fabricated a classic tale of a dissolute young master who had squandered the family fortune and now drifted at sea to earn a living.

Though the tale was hackneyed, it was not uncommon in those days, and easy to tell convincingly. Lin Ming had another advantage: having been a "local dragon" in Foshan, he was intimately familiar with local circumstances and could easily find families with similar stories. The family he chose as his model had a young master who, after falling into ruin, had died in Guangzhou—something others did not know, but Lin Ming did.

He promptly adapted this family's history, fitting it to himself, and at the touching parts even pretended to wipe away tears as though weeping bitterly. Thus even a worldly fox like Manager Liu was taken in. Seeing his distress, the old man offered a few words of comfort.

"Originally, seeing that you can write and reckon, I thought to keep you aboard as a clerk. But since you want to go to Lingao and submit to the Cropped-Hairs, I won't mention it." Manager Liu said, "I hear the Australians have many opportunities there. Many who had no means of survival went there to seek a living and are now doing quite well. You're young and literate—as long as you're willing to work, you'll surely be valued in the future."

"Many thanks for Manager Liu's kind comfort. How could I dare to dream of such things now? I've heard the Australians in Lingao employ a great many workers, and as long as you're willing to put in effort, there's food to be had. That's why I wanted to go. All I want is to reach Lingao in peace, get a job, have a place to stay, and earn an honest bowl of rice. This work aboard ship—I really can't manage it."

Before modern times, ocean voyages lacked weather forecasts, radar, or barometers; nautical charts were incomplete, and pirates lurked about—there was virtually no safety in sailing. Going to sea was a gamble with one's life. No ordinary common folk, unless they were truly desperate, would seek their living aboard ships. Lin Ming's earnest declaration fit perfectly with his persona as a ruined young master.

"You're being too modest," Manager Liu said, having drunk a few cups and showing a slight flush. "You probably don't know yet, but people like you—literate and numerate—if you shave your head and submit to the Cropped-Hairs when you reach Lingao, you can become a 'cadre.' That's something like what the Australians call a 'clerk,' I suppose. A modest income, perhaps, but you'll eat the emperor's rice, so to speak. Tell me, does the Ming offer any such opportunity?"

Lin Ming started. He truly had not expected the Cropped-Hairs to be so "eager for talent." Still, this brought his plan one step closer to success. He quickly demurred with a smile, "To damage one's body and hair—a gift from one's parents—is too grave a matter. Even if I do not shave my head, it should be easy enough to earn a living..."

Manager Liu nodded. "Your filial piety is commendable, young fellow. This old man will say no more. Go to Lingao and live well. If I were ten or twenty years younger, I too would seek my fortune under the Australians." With that, he drained his cup.

After dinner, Lin Ming cleared the dishes, then returned to the cabin. Manager Liu had already set out the chessboard, and the two battled back and forth for several games. In his idle time at the Hundred Household office, Lin Ming had mastered all manner of games for amusement; his chess skill was considerable. Knowing that this ship had deep ties to the Cropped-Hairs and that Manager Liu and the others had visited Lingao many times, he saw an excellent channel for learning about the Cropped-Hairs' inner workings. He deliberately restrained his skill, and the two fought to a closely matched finish—much to the delight of Manager Liu, who had swept all challengers aboard. They chatted as they played, and Lin Ming took the opportunity to learn much about Lingao.
