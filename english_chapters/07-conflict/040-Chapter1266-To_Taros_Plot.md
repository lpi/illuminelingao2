# Chapter 1266 - Tō Tarō's Plot

"This lowly one dares not!" Ning Liujin nodded repeatedly.

"Here is twenty-five dollars for you to hold onto first," the man said. "After the matter is done, I'll give you another hundred dollars!" With that, he dropped a money pouch, led his men away, leaving Ning Liujin standing alone in the reef daze.

The leader of this group was none other than Tō Tarō. After narrowly escaping the ambush, he found a secluded spot to bury Zheng Zhilong's head and marked it. He then discarded his tattered clothes, changing into garments stripped from a corpse on the road. Hiding his weapons, he quietly returned near the Zhongzuo Garrison, where he happened to run into the White Horse Unit conducting public security operations. Having lived in China for many years, he spoke decent Minnan dialect and had long since worn his hair in a bun. During the interrogation of captives, he lied about being a scattered Zheng soldier and was sent to Prisoner Camp Beta—a camp specifically for ordinary Zheng group members.

He had always been by Zheng Zhilong's side, so many middle and high-ranking figures and Zheng Zhilong's close associates knew him. However, few low-level soldiers and sailors recognized him. Plus, he used to wear European military uniforms and carry himself as a spirited Japanese samurai; now dressed in rags, with disheveled hair and a haggard face, he managed to bluff his way through.

In the camp, he discovered several former Japanese Unit captives who had also concealed their identities and made contact with them. Tō Tarō was very disciplined in managing his subordinates, and since they were of the same clan and race, their internal unity was much tighter than that of ordinary people. Tō Tarō quickly took control of these men and began operating in secret.

Gathering these people wasn't just for escaping—shortly after being captured, he learned from other prisoners that Zheng Zhilong's eldest son, Zheng Sen, had also been caught by the Vagabonds. These important prisoners were detained in Camp Alpha, two *li* away.

Since Prisoner Camp Beta held the "shrimp soldiers and crab generals"—low-level personnel—they were often sent out in teams to do various odd jobs. As long as the prisoners performed well, were willing to work, and showed a posture of "actively moving closer to the Senate," they could gradually get a small wooden plaque to hang around their necks, move to the labor camp, and gain greater freedom of movement.

Tō Tarō's group worked hard and soon obtained the small wooden plaques, moving to the labor camp. Once they had freedom of movement, they began secretly inquiring about news. Once, while working, they met an acquaintance—a young page boy from Zheng Zhilong's residence. He told Tō Tarō that he saw Fusong being caught by the Vagabonds and sent to the prisoner camp specifically for "VIPs." Recently, they had even found a few servants who used to serve him to go into the camp to attend to him.

Upon receiving this important news, Tō Tarō was both surprised and delighted. To keep his secret, he quietly tricked the page boy to the seaside, killed him, and threw the body into the sea. Tō Tarō then used the opportunity of going out to work to dig up his hidden wakizashi and some valuables from various places to facilitate his activities. He was very familiar with Xiamen Island and knew that this seaside reef cave was very secluded, so he used it as his base of operations.

Although they knew Fusong was in Camp Alpha, they couldn't enter. Rescuing him by force was a pipe dream. Since they couldn't "fight their way in," they had to find a way to "pull him out." Thus, he set his sights on the few laborers who could enter and exit Camp Alpha. Ning Liujin was young, and Tō Tarō believed he would be easier to "persuade," plus a young person wouldn't easily arouse the Vagabonds' vigilance.

The "persuasion" of Ning Liujin went smoothly. Tō Tarō thought it unlikely that Ning Liujin would inform on them, but for caution's sake, he still sent a subordinate to watch him.

Sure enough, after returning to the labor camp, Ning Liujin continued working. Although he looked somewhat distraught, the person tailing him indeed found no signs of him informing.

By evening, Ning Liujin went to the administration office to collect military ration tickets. As their top prisoner, Zheng Sen, along with Zheng Zhilong's wife Lady Dong and other most important captives, enjoyed special supplies. They didn't have to eat relief rations or fish gruel; they were supplied with rice, fresh vegetables, and fish and shrimp, plus a daily quota of tea leaves—treatment almost on par with high-ranking officers of the Voight-Kampff Army (*Fubo Jun*).

Ning Liujin collected rice, tea, salt, and other items at the supply depot and loaded them onto a "Purple Lightning" handcart. Halfway there, a short man appeared beside him—it was one of the men under that leader.

"My name is Wang Dachui," he introduced himself simply. "I'm going with you."

Ning Liujin didn't dare to disobey, so he had to instruct him a few words, asking him to pull the cart in front while he pushed from behind.

The two pushed and pulled the cart to the gate of Camp Alpha. The sentry already recognized Ning Liujin but still checked his wooden plaque according to regulations. Then he jutted his chin out and asked, "Who is this?"

"Helping push the cart together. Today the cart is heavy; one person can't push it," Ning Liujin said carefully. "He has a plaque." Saying this, he hurriedly called out, "Wang Dachui! Show your plaque to the soldier..."

This man called Wang Dachui hurriedly piled on a face full of smiles, took off the plaque from his neck for the sentry to inspect, bowing and scraping. Although only Ning Liujin had an entry permit, the sentry apparently thought there was nothing improper about this laborer helping to pull the cart in. He didn't say anything more, only carefully checking the goods on the cart—to ensure the goods weren't stolen, swapped, or poisoned en route, such goods were transported in special transport boxes sealed with wax.

"Go in." The sentry waved them through.

Ning Liujin's heart had been in his throat. Seeing the sentry didn't question the extra person, he hurriedly expressed his thanks and pushed the cart inside.

Wang Dachui was a Japanese mercenary under Tō Tarō who spoke excellent Minnan dialect and was sharp-witted. Entering Camp Alpha, he quietly observed his surroundings. Outside the camp were barbed wire, watchtowers, and sentries, looking very heavily guarded. Inside, however, it was quite relaxed. Tents and straw sheds lined both sides of the road. The captured family members lived by households; although everyone looked worried, their complexions were normal, not haggard. Their clothes were also clean and tidy; clearly, the Vagabonds treated them quite well. Most reassuringly, there were no Vagabond soldiers patrolling inside the camp.

The two pushed the cart to the main kitchen, delivered the goods, and received a receipt. Ning Liujin wished to leave as soon as possible and started to push the cart out with Wang Dachui, but Wang Dachui shook his head slightly:

"Take me to Fusong!"

Ning Liujin's calves cramped. "M... Master... this, this... is too risky..."

"Are you going or not? If not, I'll turn myself in and say you plotted with me to kidnap Fusong," Wang Dachui grinned. "I'm not afraid of death, but what about you?"

Ning Liujin was scared out of his wits, knowing he was on a pirate ship he couldn't get off. He secretly regretted not reporting them earlier; now that he had brought the man in, he could no longer clear himself. If exposed now, the Vagabonds definitely wouldn't spare him. He had no choice but to agree helplessly.

Fusong's tent was set up separately in a corner of the camp. Although young, his status was different, so he occupied a separate tent, living with the servants and page boys attending him.

Ning Liujin brought Wang Dachui to Fusong's tent. He didn't dare go in, standing guard outside. He vaguely heard Wang Dachui speaking to Fusong in a language he didn't understand. He was terrified, feeling the conversation inside would never end. Every time a sound rang out on the road, he thought the Australian sentries were coming to arrest him, cold sweat streaming down his forehead.

After waiting in fear and trepidation, Wang Dachui finally came out. Ning Liujin breathed a sigh of relief and hurriedly led him out of the labor camp.

Wang Dachui quietly returned to the labor camp—although entry and exit were free during the day, roll call was held at the first watch, after which the camp gates were closed. Anyone missing at roll call was considered an escapee, and the punishment was severe. There were also surprise roll calls at night, so Tō Tarō's group dared not stay out overnight.

However, once the camp gates closed, it was basically the laborers' own world. The sentries and managers didn't interfere with the laborers' specific lives. There were small stalls opened by camp follower merchants in the labor camp, selling daily necessities, cigarettes, and wine. The wine was very weak fruit wine, and snacks were also supplied—clams and razor clams gathered from the sea boiled in salt water, paired with some boiled edamame and the like. If one was willing to spend a little more money, one could buy freshly grilled fish, shrimp, and oysters, sprinkled with something unknown but smelling incredibly fragrant.

Although the laborers in the camp were essentially forced labor, the Vagabonds issued a bit of paper money called circulation coupons every day. Those who performed well and worked hard could get more. Thus, the small stalls did quite good business.

Tō Tarō and his men rarely went to the small stalls to drink—the stall owners and staff were under the Vagabonds—but drinking was a great excuse for meetings. Therefore, he had people buy wine and snacks, sitting on the ground outside their straw shed, gathering to talk under the guise of drinking.

"Did you see Fusong?"

"I saw him," Wang Dachui said. His surname was Honda, but apart from that, he refused to reveal his full name. The Chinese called him Old Ben. The Japanese mercenaries roughly knew he used to be a retainer of a domain. Such people ended up overseas nine out of ten times because of their Catholic faith, but Honda never prayed nor wore a cross; he was not a believer at all.

"Young Master Fusong is in good health," Honda said. "I told him about our plan to rescue him."

"What did he say?"

"He only said he awaits good news."

"Mm!" Tō Tarō nodded vigorously. "Worthy of being the Young Lord." He took a sip of wine and asked again, "What kind of man do you think the Young Lord is?"

"What kind of man..." Honda thought for a moment and said, "Very decisive, and of a stubborn disposition."
