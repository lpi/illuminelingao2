# Chapter 1637 - A Peaceful and Prosperous Age

He was not a student of this school, and his unfamiliar face easily attracted attention. Before long, someone came over to chat with him.

The local scholars initially just showed the reserve and politeness of educated men, cupping their hands as a greeting. Then a fat scholar asked lazily: "Where is the gentleman's hometown?"

"Oh, this student is from Lingao County, Qiongzhou Prefecture." Huang Binkun answered cautiously. Although his voice was low, it instantly aroused the interest of the whole room. Immediately, Huang Binkun was surrounded so tightly that not a drop of water could leak through. His two hands were held by three people respectively, others had their arms around his shoulders, and faces with eyes shining bright swayed before his eyes.

"Brother Huang, are the Australian ships really made of iron?"

"Hey, Brother Huang, is it true that Australians can command the power of ghosts and gods to make carts and ships move by themselves?"

"Master Huang, how can one traffic Australian goods?"

"Mr. Huang, my family also sells foreign goods. Can you see if you can put in a word with the Chiefs?"

...

Huang Binkun was flustered by this sudden enthusiasm. As soon as these scholars came up, they made him realize how deep the hair-bandits' influence was. He immediately understood that in front of them, he not only couldn't show much aversion to the hair-bandits but also had to appear to have connections with the Australians everywhere.

As for who among the scholars still had scholar's integrity, Second Master Huang would have to take his time to find out. At that moment, he put a smile on his face and bowed in return to all sides.

Although he was a *xiucai* from a small county, he was still a local tycoon in the county. He had seen all kinds of situations with his father since childhood and didn't feel timid in social scenes. Amidst a chaotic chorus of "Brother" and "Younger Brother," he immediately blended in with the surroundings.

Just as it was noisy all around. "*Ahem!*" A cough suddenly came from behind the onlookers.

"What a noisy mess, what kind of decorum is this? It's an insult to refinement, an insult to refinement!" Upon hearing the voice, everyone scattered to open a path. Huang Binkun saw a scholar in his thirties. His attire was no different from ordinary scholars, but his face looked more dignified, with a faint arrogance between his brows. At a glance, he was a disciple of a wealthy family.

"This is Young Master Liang Cunhou of the County School. He is a descendent of officials and runs several businesses. His family is the most well-off." The fat-faced scholar whispered in Huang Binkun's ear. *It seems this is the leader among the scholars,* Huang Binkun thought secretly.

"Brother is from Lingao?"

"Exactly."

"Good, good, good." This Young Master Liang said "good" three times in a row. "Truly, hearing a hundred times is not as good as seeing once!"

Huang Binkun wondered secretly. He wasn't some famous person, so where did this come from?

He saw this Young Master Liang say: "Brothers, please look. Does this Second Master Huang look like an Australian?"

Voices of agreement immediately rose around: "Brother Liang has eyes like torches," "Absolutely resembles," "Except he hasn't shaved his head"...

Huang Binkun panicked and said: "I am not a hair... Australian... an authentic Lingao native."

Seeing his panic, Young Master Liang couldn't help smiling: "Second Master Huang, don't panic. It's just that Second Master Huang's appearance and demeanor are truly identical to the True Hair-Bandits!"

Huang Binkun couldn't figure out how he suddenly became identical to "True Hair-Bandits."

"Although Brother cannot be considered tall, you are strong and healthy," Young Master Liang said slowly. "Although your demeanor and speech show at a glance that you come from a gentry family, your skin is dark and your hands are rough. Observing Brother's expression, neither humble nor arrogant, and there is a heroic spirit floating between your brows, vaguely with a kind of self-satisfied arrogance..."

"Brother Liang describes it wonderfully..."

"Indeed feel exactly so!"

"Brother Huang must be profound in 'Hair-Bandit Studies'..."

Huang Binkun didn't know what to say for a moment, feeling somewhat between laughter and tears. Where did he resemble the hair-bandits? Could it be that after staying under their rule for five years, even his spirit and energy had changed?

Looking at Young Master Liang's meaning, he was quite "appreciative" of the hair-bandits. Naturally, he couldn't spoil their fun. He had to murmur assent and make a few modest remarks, saying his "knowledge is shallow" and he only knew "a thing or two" about "Australians."

"Even knowing a thing or two is better than us who look at flowers in the fog and profess love for dragons like Lord Ye." Someone lamented.

"Yeah, speaking of Australians, we only know the Purple Treasure Studio..."

"This is viewing a leopard through a tube. The Purple Treasure Studio is just the Australians' entertainment of sensual pleasures. How much do we know of their skillful engineering and financial management techniques?"

...

At this time, a young scholar suddenly squeezed over. Judging by his clothes, he was quite wealthy. He said: "Gentleman has lived in Lingao for a long time. The Australians' conduct must be as clear to Gentleman as viewing palm prints. Nowadays, the world is in turmoil, and everyone wants to find a new path for governing the country and pacifying the state. Hope Gentleman will not be stingy with your advice. Gentleman must be tired from the long journey, please rest for a day first. How about this? Tomorrow at noon, I will host a banquet at my family's restaurant, Yuyuan Tower, to wash away the dust for Mr. Huang along with all the brothers." After speaking, he bowed.

Hearing there was a free feast to enjoy, everyone boisterously agreed.

The fat *xiucai* introduced again that this was Young Master Lin Zunxiu. His family opened several restaurants in Guangzhou City and owned extensive real estate. He was naturally generous and had a wide circle of friends.

While it was noisy and cheerful here, someone outside was shouting something about "hair-bandits" and "killing so many people that fields are filled." It couldn't be heard clearly. That fat-faced scholar just dismissed it, saying those were just some scholars dissatisfied with Australians, not worth a laugh.

Huang Binkun had the intention to get to know these "loyal and righteous men," but seeing that pro-hair-bandit scholars were the majority here, plus there was this Young Master Liang whom he absolutely couldn't afford to offend, he had to hold his temper and see the situation first.

The next day, Huang Binkun arrived at the appointment on time. The location of the banquet was a restaurant by the Pearl River: Zhanxiang Tower. Not only was the architecture magnificent, but a part of it protruded over the water, shaped like a water pavilion. In summer, drinking wine while facing the wind with river water flowing under the floorboards was like being an immortal.

From this restaurant, one could see the Haizhu Stone, so there were constant banquets every day. Huang Binkun had also thought of coming here to look for opportunities. Although he hadn't been turned away by the staff, getting close to the private rooms of those high officials and nobles was absolutely impossible.

Unexpectedly, after just one trip to the County School, things had become so smooth!

The staff led Huang Binkun to the hall, where a group of scholars was already waiting. To his slight disappointment, Young Master Liang wasn't among them. On second thought, given his status, he would probably be "arriving shortly."

"Young Master Huang graces us with your presence. It truly brings light to our humble abode. Come come come, please come inside, please come inside." Young Master Lin came from a merchant family and was adept at social occasions. Huang Binkun cupped his hands in return. After a chaotic exchange of courtesies, everyone happily held hands and entered the door. Facing them was a large glass piece acting as a screen wall. Looking at the windows, they were actually all fitted with glass. In Guangzhou, this could be considered a big spender's move, but to Huang Binkun, it really wasn't anything shocking: not to mention Lingao streets were full of glass windows, even his own home had all windows replaced with glass for over a year now.

The staff led them through a moon gate. There were small rooms on both sides of the corridor, each with names like "Inviting Immortals," "Joyous Travel"... and so on. Lin Zunxiu pulled Huang Binkun and led everyone to the outermost room, the Chrysanthemum Viewing Hall. This was the most famous "Water Pavilion" of the restaurant. Now all three sides of windows were open, with Xiangfei bamboo curtains hanging to block the sun. Only the river breeze blew gently, refreshing everyone.

Two large tables had already been set up in the hall, and cold dishes and fruit platters were ready. Young Master Lin greeted everyone. The scholars were probably used to eating off the wealthy Young Master Lin and weren't very polite, calling each other brothers and taking their seats.

Lin Zunxiu invited Huang Binkun to sit in the seat of honor, then introduced the scholars present to him. It turned out these scholars were mostly from small wealthy families in Guangzhou City, either with their own family businesses or with fathers and brothers serving as minor officials. For example, the most enthusiastic fat *xiucai* yesterday was surnamed Shi. His family made and sold bamboo and rattan furniture, so everyone called him Chair Shi.

Just after the first round of wine was offered, Lin Zunxiu stood up, pointed at the layers of masts and sculls on the water, turned his head and asked Huang Binkun: "Young Master Huang, is the scenery here worth viewing?"

"Great port of the Southern Kingdom, its reputation is well-deserved." Huang Binkun answered properly.

"How does it compare to Lingao?"

This put Huang Binkun in a bit of a difficult spot. In terms of city scale and population, Lingao County occupied by the Australians was far inferior to the Great Ming's Guangzhou Prefecture. But when it came to "civilization"—a word constantly on the hair-bandits' lips—Guangzhou Prefecture was far behind.

"Each has its strengths." Huang Binkun said, "Hard to distinguish high and low."

Scholar Shi laughed loudly: "Brother Huang's words are a bit too slippery..."

Huang Binkun was somewhat embarrassed: "Younger Brother is also speaking the truth. The prosperity of Lingao is different from this Guangzhou Prefecture..."

"How is it different?" Young Master Lin asked hurriedly.

*How is it different?* Huang Binkun thought. The biggest difference was that in Lingao, the whole environment made people feel comfortable. The ground was clean, streets were orderly, and the common people also appeared neat and spirited—there were no beggars all over the ground or filthy coolies.

"Is Lingao extraordinarily wealthy?" Someone asked hurriedly.

"That is not necessarily true." Huang Binkun organized his thoughts. "To speak of Lingao's prosperity, it is far inferior to Guangzhou. However, the four words 'live and work in peace and contentment' are fully deserved."

Everyone was somewhat disappointed because, in their view, Guangzhou City also deserved "live and work in peace and contentment."

"How so 'live and work in peace and contentment'?" A voice came from outside the door. It was Young Master Liang arriving.

He was the backbone of this group of scholars, so there was inevitably another round of pleasantries. Once seated, Liang Cunhou asked again how Lingao achieved "live and work in peace and contentment."

Huang Binkun organized his thoughts and said: "As the saying goes, the old are cared for, the young are educated, the poor have something to rely on, those in difficulty have help, and widowers, widows, orphans, the childless, and the disabled are all supported."

These sentences were all from the *Book of Rites*. Who present hadn't read them to shreds? Although they were words of ancient sages, no one took them seriously.

"Isn't that the sages' governance of the world?" Someone suspected, "Presumably there is also no one picking up lost items on the road and no need to close doors at night."

"That is not the case. But the difference is negligible." Huang Binkun said.

This drew even more whispering sounds of suspicion. Young Master Liang didn't mind and just asked: "Is it truly so?"
