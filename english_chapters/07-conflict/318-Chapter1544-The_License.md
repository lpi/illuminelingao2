# Chapter 1544 - The License

And so "Huang's Medicine Shop" opened with great fanfare. With the thousand yuan operating fund Xin Nachun had brought, Huang Zhen was well-funded. He immediately hired people to renovate the storefront and ordered necessary equipment.

The Mount Hua Sect was located on Mount Hua, the Western Peak. Countless pilgrims visited every year. As a major landlord in the area, the sect owned many shops on and off the mountain. So business wasn't unfamiliar to Huang Zhen.

However, at Mount Hua they were local tyrants; officials had to give them some face and wouldn't deliberately make trouble. Here, it was unfamiliar territory; he had to build relationships first.

Huang Zhen considered and decided to visit the "Director" of the Nanbao Cooperative first. When renting the house, this director had been very enthusiastic, saying he could contact her directly if he wanted to open a shop.

Huang Zhen had originally thought this "Director" was just the "shopkeeper" of the "Cooperative." Though female shopkeepers were rare, they weren't unheard of in the Ming. But what he learned later shocked him:

This female director was actually a "cadre"—he knew what cadres were; they were the Cropped-Hairs' officials. It was one thing for Cropped-Hairs to let women be officials—Wu Zetian had been Emperor, after all—but a shopkeeper counting as an "official"!

There were plenty of "Imperial Shops" in the capital, but he'd never heard of their shopkeepers being "officials"—not even "clerks." The Cropped-Hairs gave official titles to branch managers of a cooperative—abusing titles like this was definitely not the righteous path. This prosperous market scene was just an illusion. Having looted Guangdong and destroyed several great pirate bands, the Cropped-Hairs had amassed massive wealth, all piled onto this tiny Lingao—how could it not be rich? And look at those flashy-but-useless streetlights, drains, and paved roads—pure extravagance! Spending money just to look good to outsiders, like Emperor Yang of Sui wrapping trees in silk in Luoyang.

With this thought of having "seen through the truth," Huang Zhen prepared four kinds of gifts and a substantial red packet—not circulation vouchers, but a gold ring weighing half a tael. He believed everyone understood and loved the value of gold. Even if it couldn't be used directly in the market, it would be kept.

The female director was middle-aged. Originally the inner manager of a grocery store in Guangdong, she couldn't maintain the shop after her husband died. Hearing life was easy in Lingao, she brought her children and meager assets here. To survive, she joined the Cooperative as a clerk.

As a former inner manager, she was familiar with business. Being literate and numerate, and smooth in dealing with customers, she became a key employee in less than a year and was promoted to Branch Director after three years.

Hearing he wanted to formally open a shop, she was overjoyed. Li Mei had recently issued new Cooperative evaluation metrics. The Nanbao Branch looked good on everything else, but performed poorly in real estate rental; too many shophouses were vacant. Though still better than the Chengguan Town Branch, Chengguan was a special case—a future administrative and cultural district, not positioned for commerce.

Furthermore, though the Cooperative was a commercial unit, it also bore the responsibility of "promoting development." The Branch Director concurrently served as the local head of the "Commercial Ministry Trade Promotion and Development Office," facing pressure on investment attraction and tax growth targets.

Hearing Shopkeeper Huang wanted to open not just a shop but a medicine shop—which Nanbao needed—she was thrilled. Runshetang had a branch here co-run with the Ministry of Health; lines formed daily, and medicine often sold out. Not because Nanbao had so many people, but because Li people from the area flocked here for treatment.

Now, another medicine shop could divert some patients. A double victory for commerce and civil affairs. The Director grew even more enthusiastic, introducing commercial policies.

"Shopkeeper Huang is opening a medicine shop. First, you need to get a few certificates." The Director took out a blank sheet of paper and scribbled with a pencil.

Huang Zhen nodded. He had already experienced the Cropped-Hairs' obsession with issuing certificates.

First was naturally the Business License. Under the Yuan Elder Court, there was no Bureau of Industry and Commerce, but opening a shop or stall still required a license. Only the issuing authority was the Police Department—specifically, the Civil Division of the National Police.

Management by police rather than a commerce bureau was a lesson learned from the future. Administrative departments like the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, lacking violent enforcement power, had very low efficiency in China—unable to control the big ones, overwhelmed by the small ones. Loopholes everywhere. Thus, following the old Japanese police system, this authority was given to the National Police.

Hearing this required disturbing the police, Huang Zhen felt uneasy. But having come this far, there was no turning back.

Next was the Tax Registration Certificate, obtained from the General Tax Bureau. Huang Zhen understood tax collection, but Ming commercial taxes were few and collection crude. Usually, state taxes were pitifully low, but yamen fees and "donations" were countless, with frequent ad hoc levies. Huang Zhen managed Mount Hua Sect assets and knew the rule was "low tax, heavy fees": the former went to the public, so no one cared—paying a bit to cope was fine, and the powerful often paid nothing. The latter was kept by the yamen, so it wasn't easy to dodge.

In Lingao, it was the opposite. No "fees and donations," but tax categories were numerous. Taxes on shops, taxes on employees. Business tax, income tax, stamp duty... A multitude of items, with complex calculations that made his head spin.

Seeing his difficulty, the Director stopped and smiled. "Can't explain this in a moment. Go get the Tax Registration Certificate; someone will explain it clearly then."

"Yes, yes, thank you, Director."

"Normally that would be it. But since you're opening a medicine shop, there are a few more things to do."

"Please enlighten me, Director."

Since it involved medical health, he needed a "Pharmaceutical and Health Operation Permit"—also issued by the National Police, specifically the Health Police Division. Anything involving public health management was their responsibility. The reason was the same as the Business License being under the Civil Division.

Huang Zhen nodded helplessly, thinking *I'm getting that whatnot Business License anyway, I'll do them together.* Unexpectedly, the Director added:

"But to apply for this Pharmaceutical and Health Operation Permit, you first need two licenses fully prepared: since there's 'medicine' [practice], you need a 'Chinese Medicine Practitioner License'; since there's 'pharmacy' [drugs], you need a 'Chinese Pharmacist License'..."

Before she finished, Huang Zhen asked hastily, "For this, do I need a 'Shopkeeper License' to be a shopkeeper?"

The Director smiled. "That's not needed. But if you like, taking a test for an Industrial and Commercial Management Qualification Certificate wouldn't hurt. It's useful if you ever work for our state-owned commercial enterprises."

Huang Zhen nearly fainted.

The Director said some more about "medicine concerns people's health and lives, must be cautious," to which Huang Zhen only nodded assent.

As for these practitioner licenses, he had to go to Lingao General Hospital in East Gate Market to take the exam. Actually, issuing practitioner licenses for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) was controversial within the Yuan Elder Court and the health system. A significant number of Yuanlao suggested "abolishing the practice, keeping the medicine." But the health sector couldn't produce enough medically trained staff, so maintaining the status quo was the decision. As Chief Deng of the General Hospital Medical Section and Secretary of the Health Ministry Office said: "Placebo therapy treats illness too."

"Don't worry, Shopkeeper Huang. Our Yuan Elder Court never makes things difficult for the people. As long as conditions are met, we never intentionally obstruct. If there's anything you don't understand, just come to me; I'll do my best." She threw him a flirtatious look.

Huang Zhen pretended not to see, rose, and bowed.

"Thank you for your guidance, Director. I'll go do it." He offered the four gifts.

"Oh my, how can I accept your gifts," the Director smiled like a flower. "We don't do that here; don't make me commit a mistake..." Her hand "accidentally" brushed Huang Zhen's arm. "You've come a long way, and doing business isn't easy—don't spend money. If you really want to thank me, come chat often. Let's exchange needs—it's all serving the Yuan Elder Court and the people."

Huang Zhen got goosebumps. He had planned to give the gold ring; giving it now seemed like asking for trouble. He smiled apologetically. "Just mere local products, a token of appreciation. Please look after me in the future..."

He hurried to leave. The Director refused the gifts, pushing back and forth until they were returned. Huang Zhen was surprised: *These Cropped-Hairs really don't take bribes! But that female False Cropped-Hair seems interested in me...* He shuddered all over. Unbearable, unbearable.

Back at the shop, he explained the exams. Jiao Gongli and Song Shengying, heroes of their regions, were at a loss hearing they had to take an exam to open for business. They'd experienced much, but exams were a first. But since they were in Lingao, retreating wasn't an option. They followed the Director's advice, went to a bookstore, and bought the *1634 TCM Practitioner and Pharmacist Exam Syllabus and Guide* to study. Seeing the bookstore full of similar books, like scholars' collections of "eight-legged essays," Huang Zhen felt unsure, so he picked two related books, *Past Years' Real Questions Collection* and *Review Compendium*, for the two to use. Registration was simple; the bookstore handled it—fees, forms, fingerprints, admit cards.
