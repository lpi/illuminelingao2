# Chapter 1393 - Zhou Yu Beats Huang Gai

Wu Zhixiang felt somewhat awkward—what a clever person he was, seeing immediately that this girl was probably favored in front of Master Zhao usually, inevitably somewhat spoiled by favor. Making unauthorized decisions, acting somewhat rashly, no wonder this usually gentle and refined Master Zhao would be so angry: so-called deep love, severe responsibility.

Seeing servants standing still, Zhao Yingong became more angry: "Still standing dazed for what? Drag out!"

This time, the Inner Direct Squad family soldiers who originally followed behind them for security task dared not neglect anymore, lifting the teary-eyed Xihua and leaving.

Seeing she didn't even say a word of begging for mercy, yet eyes full of attachment and reluctance towards Zhao Yingong, Wu Zhixiang, also a sentimental seed having been entangled with several maids at home, felt soft in heart, smiled: "Brother Zhao, why need to be so angry. This girl is ignorant, just teach her a few boards, why go to such lengths."

Everyone was originally frightened and trembling with fear—this Xihua was not like ordinary people. She was one of the few children Master personally selected to teach by his side. Nominally Master's servant boy, maid, actually equivalent to Master's student. Usually a role able to take charge alone. Today suddenly encountering thunderous anger, everyone was confused.

Some with quick minds already guessed this was Master making an example of Xihua. The foreman servant woman reacted fastest, walking to Zhao Yingong and kneeling down with a thump, kowtowed heavily:

"Master appease anger! This time cannot blame Miss Xihua. It was this servant who talked too much saying it was terribly hot in workshop, everyone couldn't bear it... Thousands of mistakes, all this servant's one person's mistake. Beg Master to spare Miss Xihua, heavily punish this servant—"

Zhao Yingong's face slightly startled, asking: "What is your name?"

"This servant Huang Xiang—"

Huang Xiang seeing Master Zhao's face unkind, felt somewhat afraid in heart, not knowing if her bet was right. But matter came to this, besides bracing herself to go up there was no other way. So she kowtowed heavily again:

"Beg Master to show great mercy! Spare Miss Xihua!"

"Less selling good here. I have many things recently, didn't attend to managing things in Villa. You behave more and more presumptuously! How can this continue—Since you come out to accept crime, still considered having loyal heart. Today temporarily spare your flesh pain—Fenghua! Tell Steward Office, dock her one month's monthly money!"

At this time torture already started outside. Sound of bamboo board beating and groaning sobbing came in. Female workers and slaves were silent as cicadas in winter, daring not speak anymore. Wu Zhixiang hearing sound couldn't bear it, came to persuade again:

"Even if she has thousands of faults, she is after all a weak female. Brother Zhao running Cihui Hall, silk factory are meant to be accumulating kindness and accumulating virtue. If really beaten to something bad, after all hurting dignity, violating way of benevolence, afraid hindering public discussion."

Seeming to realize "beating to death" was indeed too much—really beating a slave maid to death was also a troublesome matter, Zhao Yingong panted heavily, said:

"Since brother pleads for her, spare her this time. Pass down: beat sixty boards, beat diligently!" He waved hand, "Tell everyone one by one to be careful. Whoever dares to discuss Villa matters wildly again, leaking news, absolutely won't forgive lightly!" Finishing saying stood up and left.

Similar to Zhao Yingong's estimation. The next evening, Hao Yuan lurking in Nanxiawa already knew this matter: Gou Chengxuan rushed to Nanxiawa immediately after getting news, telling Hao Yuan.

"This Xihua is not ordinary person, but one of few most favored maids beside Zhao Yingong," Gou Chengxuan was very excited, "Usually taking charge alone aside, can also enter and exit Zhao Yingong's inner study. If can take this opportunity to pull her over, of great benefit to our action."

Although their plan made a few days ago already started, currently considered smooth, in some most critical places data was still insufficient. Phoenix Mountain Villa after several managements had become a large estate. From riverside to mountain, there were dozens of houses in Phoenix Mountain Villa. Which places were Villa's vital parts, where Zhao Yingong usually rested, worked, where documents, gold and silver in Villa were stored, were all unsolved mysteries to them.

They had quite a few inside lines in Villa, but these people were all ordinary slaves or refugee workers, couldn't access core, could only see and hear some superficial things.

Whether Gou Chengxuan, Hao Yuan, or Gou Chengxuan's master, all adhered to idea of hitting snake at seven inches. This time of painstaking management, if unable to give Zhao Yingong's gang a fatal blow, making them unable to recover, then with their strength, sooner or later they would make a comeback.

According to reports from inside lines currently in Villa, they already knew there was not small scale family soldier team in Villa. Then figuring out where family soldiers patrolled, deployed usually became necessary intelligence for this action. If rushing people to storm Villa rashly, rushing randomly without knowing details, possibility of being directly beaten out by Villa family soldiers was relatively large.

Hao Yuan's attitude was much calmer, asking: "Could it be bitter meat trick?"

Gou Chengxuan seemed to have expected his question: "I asked inside line in detail. This matter has cause and effect, absolutely not sudden event arising in a moment."

Speaking he told Hao Yuan one by one news obtained from inside line: Xihua usually focused on teaching, unwilling to let students do miscellaneous work; environment inside filature was harsh, originally there were various discussions inside Villa.

"This little lady Xihua was originally daughter of Xiucai, literate, said to be able to write poems. Appearance also fits Zhao Baldy's liking. Very favored. Spoiled by favor not one or two days. Vaguely has meaning of first person beside Zhao Baldy. Zhao Baldy didn't let her be personal maid, instead chose Fenghua who is black and ugly, originally also intended to suppress her."

Hao Yuan still maintained silence, continuing to listen to Gou Chengxuan's rambling.

Gou Chengxuan became more enthusiastic:

"...If attacking her without cause, let alone brother, even little brother would feel strange. But linking up like this, this matter is at least seventy or eighty percent true."

Hao Yuan nodded: "Brother Gou speaks reasonably."

Only saying "reasonably," not "correct," what a clever person Gou Chengxuan was, knowing he had reservations. Wanted to continue speaking. Hao Yuan suddenly asked: "Just said, Xihua angered Zhao Yingong because pleading for female workers in silk factory?"

"Correct!" Gou Chengxuan nodded repeatedly, "According to inside line, this silk factory is truly like hell on earth. Ordinary people going in to work have to come out to pant and rest in less than one shichen. If weak, will faint inside in a quarter. Previous days still okay, these days weather hot, several people faint every day, carried out to be saved with medicine. Have to work six shichen daily, no rest even on 1st and 15th. Female workers all say can't bear it, only gritting teeth doing inside seeing high wages."

"How does Zhao Yingong treat slaves and female workers usually?"

"This has nothing to say, better than ordinary aristocratic families and big households. But control is also strict!" Gou Chengxuan said, "Inside line says: Villa gives much money and grain to slaves, boards also beaten ruthlessly. Everything has rules in Villa, violating rules absolutely not forgiven lightly."

"Leaving aside craftsmen and coolies, do ordinary slaves have much work?"

"Much!" Gou Chengxuan said without hesitation, "Inside lines all say no idle people in Zhao family. Working from morning to night. But money much food good, everyone is willing to do more."

"So that's how it is." Hao Yuan nodded thoughtfully, asking again: "You just said, this Xihua also specifically took students to boil water and wash towels for female workers?"

"Yes, if not for this, how would she anger Zhao Baldy?" Gou Chengxuan said, "Speaking of which, this girl really has some chivalrous heart."

"Is she usually a chivalrous woman too?"

This question immediately stumped Gou Chengxuan. When talking with inside line, Gou Chengxuan only cared about inquiring details of this matter itself, didn't ask to such detailed level about derived matters.

"This didn't ask in detail..."

A trace of smile appeared at corner of Hao Yuan's mouth: "Brother Gou, I see possibility of this matter being bitter meat trick is extremely large." He stood up, stood at door looking outside, tucked straw curtain tight, then turned back, "He Zhao Yingong didn't beat earlier, didn't beat later, suddenly made example of her at this juncture, isn't it a bit meaning of Zhou Yu beating Huang Gai?"

"But, this matter makes sense..."

"Emotionally and reasonably this matter makes sense. It's just this timing has problem." Hao Yuan said, "We have inside lines in Villa, this Master Zhao has plenty of ears and eyes in Hangzhou, in Jiangnan too. News of someone wanting to deal with him probably already reached his ears."

Gou Chengxuan was startled: Hao Yuan was right. How did he forget this stub! After receiving news yesterday, not only did he interrogate inside line in detail about cause and effect of this matter, but also discussed repeatedly with Cao Guangjiu for more than one shichen, stroking whole matter back and forth several times. Both felt possibility of using this to pull Xihua as inside response was very large.

However they all forgot that they were dealing with Zhao Yingong in secret, Zhao Yingong wasn't completely ignorant.

Since not completely ignorant, there would be counter-hand. Right now they were in dark, Zhao Yingong in light. Wanting to switch attack and defense, only sending people undercover was most effective.

Hao Yuan saying so, Gou Chengxuan felt quite a bit like waking from dream. This gang of bandits was indeed incomparable cunning! He gnashed teeth saying: "Thanks to Brother Hao's reminder! Almost fell for Zhao Baldy's trick!"

Hao Yuan said faintly: "No matter. Zhao Yingong is blinded by a leaf. Thinking himself clever, we'll beat him at his own game." He opened ink box, picked up brush, quickly wrote a few lines on a piece of paper, "Trouble Brother Gou to summon inside lines in Villa again, ask about matters on paper one by one. The more detailed the better."

"Good!" Hearing this Hao Yuan still had "beating him at his own game," Gou Chengxuan was overjoyed, hurriedly took paper, blew on it, stuffed into bosom, "Little brother goes to do it right away!"
