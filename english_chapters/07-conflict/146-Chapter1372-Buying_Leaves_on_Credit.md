# Chapter 1372 - Buying Leaves on Credit

The news that the Shen Da family allowed buying leaves on credit immediately spread throughout the village. It was said that this was the intention of Shen Da's master, Master Zhao. Regardless of the amount, buying leaves on credit was flatly one mace of silver per picul, with a monthly interest of one percent. Just like borrowing rice, it could be repaid with silkworm cocoons at market price after the cocoons were harvested.

"This is simply doing charity!" Duoduo's mother's husband beamed with joy, as if he had taken advantage of a huge bargain. "Now the leaf market price is skyrocketing! Wait until the morning market today, the leaf guild in town opened at four mace of silver per picul! heard directly from the shopkeeper, it's going to rise to five mace in a few days!"

Hearing this, Shen Kaibao was anxious as anything in his heart. Five mace of silver per picul! This would cost him his old life. Even three mace per picul a few days ago felt unbearable to him.

The Shen Da family's conditions could indeed be considered charity. Even if Master Cao was willing to lend now, it would be at two and a half or three percent interest. Calculating based on this market price to buy leaves—he calculated again and again, his silkworm season would be equivalent to raising them for someone else.

The Shen Da family only wanted one mace of silver per picul, and the monthly interest was only one percent. It really counted as doing charity.

At this moment, he finally put down the grudges in his heart and repeatedly urged Daqing and Sanqing to prepare the boat and go to the Shen Da family to buy leaves on credit.

A long queue had already formed in front of the Shen Da family—although it was called buying leaves on credit, the leaves were actually not at the Shen Da family's door. Mulberry leaves were a commodity with a very short shelf life. Leaves picked in the morning were hard to preserve until the next day for sale, so transactions at the leaf guild were all same-day business. There was absolutely no stockpiling in advance.

Those who bought leaves on credit usually traded at the leaf guild, and then the buyers would go to the mulberry orchard to pick up the goods themselves. Zhao Yingong's credit sale of leaves this time was handled in the same way. The Shen Da family was only the place to sign the paperwork. After signing the paperwork, a tally was issued, and one would go to the mulberry orchard to pick up the leaves with the tally.

In the ancient society, road conditions were poor and people's range of activities was limited. Therefore, Zhao Yingong's leaf credit operation had to estimate the approximate yield of the mulberry orchard and the range of various villages it could radiate quite accurately. The former was not a big problem; the mulberry orchard owner generally knew how many commercial leaves his orchard could pick during the entire spring silkworm period. The latter required quite precise estimation. In the water towns of Jiangnan, farmers relied on boats to transport agricultural products, go to town, and enter the city. Spring was the busy farming season, and strong laborers couldn't spend too much time boating. So the distance of the supply location from the end user had to be limited to within a day's round trip by boat.

He didn't plan to operate on too large a scale this year, treating it only as a test of the waters. On one hand, he knew little about the specific situation of credit leaf sales, and on the other hand, he didn't know how much resistance he would encounter in actual operation. Therefore, whether it was asking Shen Da and Wang Siniang to return to the village to start a cooperative or selling leaves on credit, he only operated within a very small range.

Including Jixian Village where Shen Da lived, he had only launched the work of the "Hezhong Cooperative" in three "center villages" in total. These three villages could roughly cover fourteen or fifteen surrounding villages that mainly focused on sericulture. A total of more than six hundred households. The number was not large, and the quantity of cocoons obtained through small loans would also be very limited, but this was just a "model." He had full confidence that as long as this year's implementation plan went smoothly, the surrounding sericulture households would see it and enthusiastically come to participate in the "cooperation" matters the following year. At that time, it would naturally flow where water channels are formed.

The sericulture households didn't know Master Zhao's thoughts. Their only thought right now was to get mulberry leaves as soon as possible—the silkworm babies that had already passed the fourth moult had reached the critical moment of spinning silk and forming cocoons. If mulberry leaves couldn't be supplied at this time, the hard work and expenses of more than a month would all come to naught.

After Shen Kaibao signed the paperwork, he took the tally and immediately set off with Daqing to pick up the mulberry leaves. That night, they rowed the boat back, with forty piculs of leaves piled on the boat.

Before the boat even entered the village entrance, Daqing's son was already looking out at the village entrance. Seeing his grandfather and father returning, he ran towards home, shouting "They're back!" as he ran.

It turned out that Shen Kaibao's silkworms had been out of leaves for more than half an hour. This was a matter of life and death. Seeing his grandson run away, Shen Kaibao on the boat knew the situation was urgent. Ignoring that he was already hungry enough for his chest to stick to his back, he quickly stood up to help Daqing row the boat desperately. The boat rocked so much it almost grazed the water surface.

The boat shot through the river channel like an arrow, almost hitting several docked boats, and rushed all the way to their own river pier. Seeing the family members standing at the river pier looking out, Shen Kaibao became even more impatient and urged repeatedly: "Row faster!"

The father and son went out in the morning and rowed all day, only eating one meal. Their legs were sore and their hands were soft, and their bodies felt terribly weak. But they knew that the silkworm babies must have missed a meal by now. If they couldn't spread the leaves in time, all previous efforts would be wasted, and everything would be finished.

As the boat reached the river pier, before it even stopped steadily, Sanqing had already jumped onto the boat, shouldered a basket of mulberry leaves, and sent it ashore. As soon as his foot stepped on the stone steps, several pairs of hands came to receive it and carried it towards the house together. Seeing his own son among them, Daqing rushed up to help. The person was small and the basket heavy, and he immediately tumbled and rolled far away. He felt a pang of heartache. He quickly shouldered a basket of mulberry leaves and went ashore.

Shen Kaibao urged anxiously: "Quick! Quick!" Ignoring his old age and declining strength, he also helped move the mulberry leaves.

Those white and fat "silkworm babies" had been hungry for quite a while. They all pointed their small mouths and swayed left and right. Shen Kaibao felt sour in his heart watching them. As soon as the leaves were spread, the silkworm room was immediately filled with a rustling sound, and people couldn't hear each other speaking very clearly. In a short while, those "round flat trays" all showed white again. So a thick layer of leaves was spread on top again.

Just "placing leaves" made people too busy to breathe. But this was the final difficulty. With sufficient mulberry leaves, as long as they survived another two days, the spring silkworms could mount. People squeezed out their remaining energy and worked desperately.

Duoduo's mother didn't know how busy her family was now, but when her husband came to buy leaves on credit a few days ago, he said the silkworm harvest was very good, totaling about seventy or eighty percent. This made her breathe a sigh of relief slightly. She came out to do "monthly labor" for more than a month and could get more than one tael of silver. If the silkworm harvest was good, the whole family would have hope this year.

Between the fourth and fifth moults was the hardest time for raising silkworms. The silkworm raising work at the Shen Da family was also tense to the extreme. The Shen Da family had many silkworm trays, and the workload of placing leaves and cleaning silkworm droppings every day was huge. The silkworm raising women worked day and night, only sleeping for one or two hours a day, taking a nap against the wall in the nearby servant's room, and getting up after a while to place leaves and patrol.

Wang Siniang and Lizheng took turns patrolling day and night. Especially Wang Siniang, she roused up one hundred and twenty percent of her spirit. Because she knew that the master sending her to the village to raise silkworms this time was an "important matter." If she handled it well, needless to say, she would be a "manager" in the mountain villa in the future. If she messed it up, she would only be a "foreman."

Seeing that the silkworms had entered the fifth instar and the food intake began to decrease, Wang Siniang and Lizheng knew that they were about to start spinning cocoons. traditional mounting methods mostly used increasing temperature to make the silkworms mount and spin cocoons. However, due to the different timing of silkworm maturation, inducing mounting together would often cause some silkworms to be over-mature while others were not yet mature. those mounted too early would result in many non-cocooning silkworms, low silk quantity, and unclean cocoon color; if mounted too late, they would crawl around randomly on the mounting cluster, losing silk quantity, and spinning cocoons hastily after mounting, resulting in too many defective cocoons.

Therefore, the method adopted here was the batch mounting method, which involved a larger workload but a higher cocoon harvesting rate. Lizheng first educated the silkworm raising women on how to distinguish between maturing silkworms and properly mature silkworms. They patrolled regularly every day, transferring properly mature silkworms from the large silkworm trays to small silkworm trays, and then moving them into a special mounting room, mounting them at a density of 500 heads per square meter.

Duoduo's mother saw this kind of mounting method for the first time. No mountain sheds were used, nor straw clusters. Instead, square grids made of thick paper were used, hung one by one directly above the mature silkworms. This utilized the habit of mature silkworms crawling upwards, allowing them to automatically crawl onto the mounting tool to spin cocoons.

In the mounting room, there were still earth dragon fires and water basins, and strange glass tubes and glass bulbs were also indispensable. Bamboo blinds hung on the windows here, making the incoming light soft and dim—strong light was most taboo when spinning cocoons.

In the early stage of mounting, mature silkworms had to excrete feces and urine before spinning silk and forming cocoons, so the humidity in the cluster room was very high. Humidity was monitored, and once it exceeded 75%, doors and windows had to be opened for ventilation and dehumidification. The room temperature was best at 25°C. If it was lower than 22°C, heating was required. excessive or insufficient temperature and humidity would affect the cocooning rate and cocoon quality, so very precise control was needed.

Duoduo's mother followed the method taught by Lizheng, picking out mature silkworms and sending them to mount every day with other silkworm raising women. The silkworm trays mounted every day were marked. At the same time, they had to remove dead silkworms from the clusters and catch wandering silkworms that had not spun cocoons to mount separately.

It was not until five or six days after mounting that Lizheng gave instructions to start harvesting cocoons. If harvested too early, the unpupated silkworms were easily injured, polluting the cocoons; if harvested too late, the pupae turning into moths would also affect the cocoon quality. When harvesting cocoons, they were collected in batches according to the order of mounting dates. The harvested cocoons were spread thinly on silkworm trays without squeezing each other. Upper cocoons and lower cocoons were put separately. Generally, those with solid, white cocoon shells and uniform cocoon shapes were upper cocoons; dead cocoons, yellow spotted ones, thin-skinned ones, deformed ones, and those with fly maggots were lower cocoons. Double cocoons were put separately.

This practice of mounting every day and harvesting every day made it difficult for Duoduo's mother to estimate the quality of the Shen Da family's silkworm harvest. But every time she went to harvest cocoons, the white cocoons in the square grid clusters were mostly excellent cocoons, and dead silkworms that didn't spin cocoons were rarely seen. This Guangdong breed not only had larger cocoons than the local breed but also had a thick silk layer and solid cocoon body. The silk filaments were also very clear. Wang Siniang had raised silkworms for decades and had never seen such good cocoons! Even the best Huzhou silk cocoons she had seen couldn't compare.

When taking down the snow-white and solid silkworm cocoons from the square grid clusters one by one, Duoduo's mother would always feel an inexplicable joy in her heart—although these cocoons were not hers, the results of caring for them carefully for more than a month still made her feel the joy of harvest and made her feel happy from the bottom of her heart.
