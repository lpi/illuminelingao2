# Chapter 1292 Siege of Dengzhou Broken

All these things constituted an unsolved mystery. It also made the rebels always wary of the Qimu Island force.

Kong Youde slowly stuffed this stack of papers into his bosom and asked: "Why does the Manor Lord want to inform me of the location of the government army's grain depot?"

Chen Sigen smiled slightly: "If you think it's useful, take it and use it. If you think it's useless, burn it in a fire."

Kong Youde still didn't give up: "To be honest, I still have some doubts about this... Could it be inviting the gentleman into the urn (a trap)?" He intended to goad the other party to solicit some information.

Chen Sigen still smiled slightly: "Inviting the gentleman into the urn, is there a need for this?" His face changed, and he sneered, "If so, your heads would have been spread throughout the Nine Frontiers a few months ago, do we still need to wait until today?!"

These words were extremely rude and arrogant in the extreme. Kong Youde was attacked by a burst of anger, but he knew that the other party was not boasting. suppress the anger in his heart, he cupped his hands and said: "Then thank you very much, Manor Lord Lu. Kong will take his leave." After speaking, he stood up and left.

After obtaining this intelligence, Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde discussed that continuing to defend desperately in the city probably wouldn't last long—among the incoming government troops, there were the elite Guan-Ning Army—including two thousand barbarian soldiers known as the best at fighting, who were all Mongol and Later Jin soldiers who rebelled and surrendered to the Ming Dynasty. In field battles, their own side was absolutely no match. The battle of Beima Town had fully explained that their cavalry infantry temporarily improvised by looting livestock were no match for field cavalry.

In this way, raiding the grain depot to force the government troops to retreat became their only possible choice besides fleeing by sea.

However, the rebel's area of activity had now been compressed to Dengzhou. To go to Qingzhou to rob grain, they would inevitably have to cross the Laizhou boundary. This was a very risky thing. Inside Laizhou City, there were now thousands of government soldiers led by Sun Yuanhua and Zhang Tao—all Shandong soldiers and Southern soldiers who were red-eyed from fighting with them. If they blocked and intercepted from the waist, whether going or returning, it would cause severe losses, and maybe the sneak attack force would be wiped out.

The two calculated repeatedly and finally decided that delay would bring trouble. Taking advantage of the opportunity that the government troops had just arrived under the city these days and had not yet formed an encirclement, plus it was snowing heavily and there were very few people active in the wild, they would dispatch cavalry to launch a surprise attack on Qingzhou to burn the government troops' grain depot in one fell swoop.

Once the plan was decided, with Kong Youde's family retainers and personal soldiers as the core, and secretly transferring the family retainers and personal soldiers of various original Dongjiang generals, a total of six hundred elite cavalry were gathered. Each person had a full meal and was issued winter clothing. Silver was awarded. Each person was equipped with one horse and one mule. Carrying six days of dry food and horse fodder, taking advantage of the heavy snow falling from the sky, they quietly opened the city gate and secretly marched along the coastline.

Heavy snow fell all the way, and goose-feather-like heavy snow quickly covered the traces of people and horses passing. In the freezing weather, the government army's post horses no longer went to distant places for scouting. Kong Youde's six hundred men and horses went smoothly all the way and entered Qingzhou territory without suffering any major losses.

Although Qingzhou was one of the Three Prefectures of Eastern Shandong, because of the success of the defense of Laizhou City, the damage suffered in the Dengzhou-Laizhou Rebellion was much smaller than that of Dengzhou and Laizhou. Except for being swept by the rebel troops returning to Dengzhou at the beginning, it was relatively stable afterwards, not looking like a barren land for a thousand li with few human traces. Naturally, the alert state of the government troops was also much worse.

Kong Youde led the cavalry to suddenly appear in Qingzhou, broke through a series of grain storage locations such as Zhuqiao and Huangshanguan, and burned tens of thousands of shi of grain and fodder transshipped by the government troops. Qingzhou Intendant Yang Jin led the army to meet the enemy hastily and was defeated and killed in battle. For a time, the Shandong Field Headquarters, which had originally planned to "collect full merit", was suddenly thrown into chaos.

This winter was originally very cold. Entering the eleventh lunar month, heavy snow was already fluttering. In addition, the sea breeze by the seaside was piercingly cold. The soldiers braved the snow and frost, their skin cracked, suffering greatly from the cold winter. The suppression government troops were not fully prepared even for winter clothes. Zhu Dadian and Xie Sanbin sent people everywhere to collect cotton-padded clothes and fur coats, and also collected reed mats and shochu everywhere to reward the soldiers. They also distributed reward silver multiple times, trying hard to stabilize the army's heart.

However, rumors that the grain had been burned suddenly appeared. Before they could find out the source of the rumors, the emergency messenger from Qingzhou had already arrived in the main camp.

This was no less than a bolt from the blue for Zhu Dadian and others—in the freezing weather, tens of thousands of troops were stationed under a fortified city, and their grain supply was cut off. Suddenly, they fell into a desperate situation of total annihilation!

After receiving this emergency document, Zhu Dadian immediately summoned the civil officials and military generals in the main camp to discuss countermeasures. The generals' opinions were unanimous: Taking advantage of the fact that there was still four days of grain storage in the camp, pull up camp and retreat to Laizhou, Qingzhou and other places, so as to obtain grain nearby. Wait until the grain route is restored before marching again.

Zhu Dadian was still hesitating—he had practically vomited his heart's blood for this siege of Dengzhou. Seeing that the rebels had become fish at the bottom of a chaotic pot, suddenly something about the grain route being cut off popped up. According to the urgent report from Qingzhou, the rebel side seemed to have sent a roving cavalry to sneak attack various grain depots in Qingzhou.

Since the enemy was only sneak attacking and had no rear support, they certainly could not last long. There was still four days of grain storage in the camp. If emergency preparations could be made, the situation of besieging Dengzhou could still be maintained. At this time he thought of Manor Lord Lu. He had already promised to send one thousand shi of grain. Presumably, asking him to send a few thousand shi more would also be doable. He heard that he recruited tens of thousands of refugees in the Zhaoyuan area, and must have a large amount of stored grain. Huang County was not far from here...

Therefore, he did not immediately order a retreat, but asked the generals to return to their camps temporarily, strictly guard the camps, and wait for orders.

After the generals left, Zhu Dadian immediately sent people to ride fast to Laizhou, asking Sun Yuanhua to send troops to first raise a batch of grain in Laizhou City and transport it to the main camp to stabilize the army's heart. He continued to discuss with several important advisors, estimating various difficult situations that might be encountered, and thinking of some coping methods. While discussing, suddenly loud cannon fire was heard in Dengzhou City, and bursts of cheers came.

Zhu Dadian frowned and asked:

"Why such clamor?!"

In a moment, the noise in the city seemed to spread to the camp. People shouted and horses neighed, a scene of chaos. Commander of Suppression in Dengzhou, General of Liaodong Soldiers, Vice Commander-in-Chief Jin Guoqi suddenly entered the tent and said hurriedly:

"Please, my lords, mount your horses quickly, the situation is not good!"

"What is the matter to be so panicked? Speak quickly!"

"I don't know why, when the camps learned that the grain route was cut off, the soldiers all made an uproar wanting to leave. The generals couldn't suppress them and are being coerced by the mutinous soldiers to flee. Now the camps are terrified and the situation is like tiles disintegrating. The situation is extremely critical, please mount quickly, my lord, to prepare for contingencies."

Zhu Dadian forced himself to be calm: "You go quickly to pass down a strict order, troops of all camps are not allowed to panic and move randomly, must maintain calm with force, and stick to the camps. Those who dare to abandon the stockade and flee will be beheaded immediately without pardon!"

"Yes, complying with the order!" Jin Guoqi turned and left.

While Zhu Dadian was anxious, Zu Dashou rode over with a group of personal soldiers, dismounted in front of Zhu Dadian's tent, hurriedly cupped his hands in salute, and said loudly:

"Please move camp immediately, my lord! The rebels have already charged out from the city, please leave quickly, my lord!"

"The rebels have become fish in a chaotic pot, no need to worry." Before his voice fell, rumbling cannon sounds were heard from the city—the rebels in the city had rarely fired cannons these days, but at this time they suddenly opened fire densely. Cannonballs whistled and flew towards the main camp, increasing the chaos in the camp.

Zhu Dadian was about to speak when suddenly war drums, horns, and conch sounds rang out from the enemy camp. Then, there was the sound of thousands of troops galloping and shouting for killing. Everyone heard it: The rebels in Dengzhou City had turned out in full force to charge towards the camp. Zu Dashou urged: "Please move camp quickly, my lord, and make plans later."

The day after Kong Youde succeeded in the sneak attack, Li Jiucheng received the oral message of the successful sneak attack sent by the secret envoy sent by Manor Lord Lu in the city. He was originally skeptical and had no move. However, he ordered the generals under him to feed the horses and sharpen weapons, ready to go out of the city to fight at any time.

This day, suddenly receiving a report that people were shouting and horses were neighing in the government army camp, and it was chaotic, he knew that there must have been an accident in the main camp—mostly likely the news that the grain route was cut off had reached the camp. Li Jiucheng himself was an old general of Liaodong and knew the style of conduct of Guan-Ning very well. He knew that this must be the Guan-Ning generals running away in a crisis. He grilled a laugh: "It's really Heaven helping me!" He immediately ordered the whole city to beat drums and fire cannons, and sent many personal soldiers to shout all over the city: "The government army's grain route is cut off!"

Subsequently, fully armored, he personally led a part of the elite as the vanguard, leading thirty thousand infantry and cavalry to attack the main camp, hoping to defeat the main force of the Shandong Field Headquarters in one fell swoop while it was chaotic.

At this time, the Guan-Ning camps, which had the strongest combat power in the Field Headquarters, had already begun to flee, and the remaining troops of Sichuan, Hebei, and Shandong towns also fled. For a time, the camps were in chaos, scrambling to flee. Zhu Dadian, Xie Sanbin and others were held hostage and helped onto horsebacks, whipping their horses and fleeing together.

It was after snow, freezing cold. The Guan-Ning armies were mostly cavalry and had already fled one step ahead. The other towns were mostly infantry, almost unable to move an inch on foot in the accumulated snow. Being caught up by the rebels, they immediately scattered like startled birds and beasts, without any resistance. The rout and pursuit continued into the night. Many government soldiers were killed or captured, and countless more scattered in the chaos.

Zhu Dadian and others were almost caught up by the rebels in their escape, and thoughts of suicide arose several times. The most critical time, all the personal soldiers around him were scattered. Fortunately, at this time, a cavalry unit flying the flag of Qimu Island suddenly appeared, fired a row of muskets, repelled the rebels, and received them.

Zhu Dadian was still in shock. Seeing that the other party was only more than a hundred people, and the leader was just a young officer, wearing a thick felt wide-brimmed rain hat, a cotton long robe, and cloth belts bound around his chest and waist. The hundred cavalry around him were all dressed the same as him, carrying bird guns (muskets) diagonally and wearing war sabers at their waist. Although they did not wear armor, they looked vigorous and very brave.

"This lowly person is Huang Ande, paying respects to Your Excellency!" Hearing that the one being rescued was the Governor of Shandong, the comer immediately rolled off his saddle and dismounted, coming to Zhu Dadian's horse to kneel and salute, "My lords have been startled!"

"It doesn't matter." Hearing that the other party had a Shandong accent, Zhu Dadian immediately felt at ease and forced himself to be calm, "Thanks to the strong man for help!"

"Please be at ease, My Lord. Lord Sun has already personally led General Zhang to meet in front. We will escort Lord Zhu to go there!"
