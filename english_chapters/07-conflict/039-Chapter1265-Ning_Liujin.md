# Chapter 1265 - Ning Liujin

He worked hard and came from a lower-class background, belonging to the category of "objects that can be won over and relied upon." Soon, he caught the eye of the Vagabond manager and was sent to clean the latrines and swill at Prisoner Camp Alpha. This job was much easier than being a porter on the dock, and he could eat at the kitchen of Prisoner Camp Alpha: the food there was also better than that of the prisoner labor teams on the dock.

Prisoner Camp Alpha held the identified core members of the Zheng group and their families, mostly captured from Anping. There were men, women, old, and young, living in makeshift straw sheds and tents. Usually used to a life of luxury, they were now inevitably in a sorry state. However, the Vagabonds treated them relatively well, not forcing them to do labor, providing better food than ordinary prisoners, and giving timely medical treatment to the sick. Each person was even issued some replacement clothes.

Ning Liujin worked in Prisoner Camp Alpha for a few days and got familiar with the people inside—he was a local, and the Zheng group was mainly composed of people from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Southern Fujian. Originally, their status difference was vast; to the people in Camp Alpha, someone like Ning Liujin was less than an ant or grass—not even worth calling a "person." But now that he could move freely and the Vagabonds seemed to trust him, Ning Liujin suddenly became a person of some status in the prisoner camp. Many people called him "Officer Liu"—in the past, anyone willing to call him "Liujin" would have been very polite and highly regarding him.

Ning Liujin went in and out of the prisoner camp every day and slept in the labor camp outside at night. This camp was full of local people and prisoners who had recently defected to the "Vagabond bandits." They provided various services for the Australians, ranging from coolies to Minnan dialect translators and guides. Because of his good performance, Ning Liujin gradually stopped doing dirty and heavy work and switched to better jobs, such as transporting items for the kitchen and laundry. He worked happily, ate his fill, wasn't beaten or scolded, and felt that this life was truly not bad.

Because the Guide Labor Camp had just been established and the system was incomplete, various departments constantly transferred personnel from it for tasks. Consequently, security here wasn't tight, and entry and exit were very casual; anyone with a small wooden plaque around their neck could pass freely. The personnel sent to guard the Guide Camp were from the White Horse Unit; they didn't speak the language and only maintained basic order in the camp. Distinguishing faces gave clever people a lot of freedom of action.

That day, after delivering ingredients to Camp Alpha, he took his carrying pole and walked towards the seaside, wanting to take advantage of the low tide to go beachcombing and get some seafood to satisfy his cravings. There were several large reefs by the beach where many shellfish would be left when the tide receded, and sometimes with luck, stranded fish and shrimp could be found.

As he wandered among the reefs, he vaguely felt a sharp pain in the back of his head, and then lost consciousness.

After an unknown amount of time, Ning Liujin woke up.

It was dark all around, full of stones. There was fuzzy light, but he couldn't see clearly. He struggled to prop himself up and sit.

It looked like a stone cave. The surroundings were dark, rugged, large rocks, wet and dripping. A little light filtered in from the top.

He reached out and felt around; the ground beneath him was sand. He calmed down to listen and seemed to hear the faint sound of ocean waves.

Ah, this was a cave in the seaside reefs!

Ning Liujin grew up by the sea and was familiar with this kind of cave. He slowly stood up. With the help of the faint light and groping with his hands and feet, he quickly figured out that the cave wasn't big. He soon felt the entrance, but it was tightly blocked by stones.

"Why knock me out and lock me in a cave?" He couldn't figure it out.

He couldn't recall holding a grudge against anyone. In the Zheng group, he wasn't even small fry, just a dust-like character. If it were the Australians, killing or imprisoning someone was a matter of a single sentence for them; why be so mysterious?

As if answering his doubts, a beam of white light suddenly projected onto the dark sandy ground. The stones at the entrance were moved away.

Only then did he realize the entrance was over a person's height. Three or four men burst in from the entrance. They were all naked, wearing only shorts. Everyone had their face wrapped in a towel. The light was dim; he couldn't see their faces clearly, nor did he have time to look closely.

"What is your name?" the leader asked him in Minnan dialect.

"Ning... Liujin."

"Who did you serve under originally?"

Ning Liujin said the name of his distant relative, but the other party obviously didn't know him. Ning Liujin had to say he didn't know either, only knowing that the ship owner always addressed his superior with the surname Zheng.

There were many people named Zheng in the Zheng group; this was as good as saying nothing.

"Dishonest fellow! Beat him!" The men shouted all at once, lunging at Ning Liujin.

"Don't hit this lowly one! This lowly one is telling the truth!" Ning Liujin shouted while following his years of experience in getting beaten, hugging his head with both hands and curling up on the ground.

"Forget it, don't hit him," the leader said. "He's probably a ship hand; even the ship owner himself is an ant-like figure."

He continued asking, "Kid, I'm asking you questions. Answer honestly. Otherwise, I'll leave you in this cave—the tide will rise in another half hour!"

In a seaside reef cave like this, being submerged by the tide meant drowning alive if trapped inside.

"This lowly one will tell everything! Tell everything," Ning Liujin answered.

"You serve the Vagabond bandits in Prisoner Camp Alpha?"

"Yes... yes..." Ning Liujin felt a wave of fear. Judging by the tone, they seemed to be Zheng family people. He had been working hard for the Australians these days; were they going to kill him as a warning to others? Fear surged in his heart, and he immediately plopped down on his knees, kowtowing repeatedly for mercy:

"Master have mercy! Master have mercy! This lowly one working for the Vagabond bandits was also out of necessity. Not working meant losing my head. This lowly one was afraid of death and coveted a few full meals, wrongly working for the Vagabond bandits—but this lowly one has never done anything against the Zheng family..."

"Working for the Vagabond bandits is already a heinous crime!" the leader said viciously. "It would be fitting to tie a stone to you and sink you into the sea..."

"Master spare my life! Master spare my life!" Ning Liujin was so scared he almost wet his pants, kowtowing repeatedly.

Just as he was scared out of his wits, thinking he was about to die, with a clatter, a pile of things was thrown before his eyes. Ning Liujin looked closely; they were more than twenty silver dollars.

He had seen silver dollars before. The ship owner sometimes used these shiny silver discs to pay the sailors—of course, he only got to look. But even a second-tier boss on the ship only got eight of these silver dollars a month. Now there were twenty-something right in front of him!

He looked up at the leader in confusion.

"Here is twenty-five dollars," he said. "As long as you honestly do a few small things for me, not only will your crimes be offset by merit, but these silver dollars will be yours."

"This lowly one dare not..." Although scared, Ning Liujin understood in his heart that what the Zheng family people wanted him to do was definitely not a small thing; it was mostly likely something that would get his head chopped off. But the situation didn't allow him to bargain, so he hurriedly said, "This lowly one awaits Master's orders!"

"In Camp Alpha, have you seen a boy, about eight or nine years old?"

"There are many family members of the masters in Camp Alpha. There are many boys aged eight or nine. I don't know which one Master is referring to?"

"His nickname is Fusong. Some also call him Zheng Sen."

"Oh, oh, you mean Young Master Fusong!" Ning Liujin nodded repeatedly. "Yes, yes, there is a maid serving him."

"How do the Vagabond bandits treat him?"

"Very well..." Ning Liujin felt this didn't sound right, paused, and added, "The Vagabond bandits arranged a separate tent for him and the maid. The food every day is also not bad; the kitchen cooks for them separately..."

"Did anyone tell you who he is?"

"No, this lowly one didn't dare ask too much..."

"You will take one of our men into Camp Alpha later to find Fusong..."

Ning Liujin's legs went soft upon hearing this, and he stammered an excuse: "This, this, Camp Alpha is heavily guarded. People without a badge can't get in at all. I'm afraid it will implicate you gentlemen. I think..."

With a "shing," someone drew a shiny short knife. Ning Liujin swallowed the rest of his sentence.

"Don't worry," the leader grinned ferociously. "We know everything about Camp Alpha and the Labor Camp clearly. We also know exactly what you do running in and out for the Vagabond bandits. Be clear about what you are. Don't think hanging a small wooden plaque on your neck means you are an official for the Vagabonds—if you die, the Vagabonds will only treat it like the death of an ant or bug. There are five to ten thousand ants like you on Kinmen Island. We killed several blind fools these past few days; do you think the Vagabonds remembered any of them? A stone around the neck and into the sea, and you go serve the Dragon King..."

"Yes, yes, this lowly one is just a bug, an ant..." Ning Liujin sweated profusely, kowtowing repeatedly. "This lowly one will think of a way immediately!"

Several men put a straw sack over his head and upper body, then shoved him along. He felt the sea breeze on his body, heard the cries of seagulls, and felt the soft ground under his feet; he was probably out on the beach.

Driven like this for a long distance, the sack was finally removed. He blinked; this was exactly the place where he came beachcombing.

"When will you go to Camp Alpha?" the leader asked.

Ning Liujin had to say, "Tonight, to deliver rice."

"Good. Go do what you need to do now. Come here before you go to deliver rice." He said fiercely, "Don't try anything funny. We know everything."
