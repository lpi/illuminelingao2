# Chapter 1496 - New Business Principles

Liu Deshan thought for a moment and said: "Because sea lords each have their own territory?!"

"Correct! However, the bigger problem is the government!" Chen Huamin said unceremoniously.

Qin Haicheng and Liu Deshan nodded in unison. Indeed, as long as one bought their command flags, great sea lords certainly wouldn't trouble merchant ships on the sea. On the contrary, various yamens, local brokers, government naval forces, and such monsters and demons wearing official skins were the characters demanding both money and life. Safety on water and land couldn't be guaranteed, yet merchants and travelers were exploited; ordinary merchants dared not travel long distances.

"Long-distance trafficking requires bribing too many powers; sometimes there's simply no way to bribe. Upon reaching the destination, encountering wicked local brokers means suppression for years and months, or even losing both goods and money. Now the road isn't peaceful either; mountain bandits and water thieves are as numerous as ox hairs. Small merchants like us without guards or power meeting them means truly not even keeping our lives. Unless the destination is 'familiar territory' with local power looking after us, we really dare not traffic long distances." Liu Deshan specialized in domestic trade and felt deepest about this.

"You, brother, at least can run to many places; count as traveling far."

"Isn't it thanks to connections accumulated by my father in early years? Otherwise how would I dare run around like this..." Liu Deshan gave a long sigh, "Nowadays I'm also careful; places not connected by major waterways I absolutely don't go. Land routes are too hard to walk. How many opportunities to make big money can only be looked at and thought about, daring not touch."

Speaking of this topic, he was enthusiastic: "Ideally, traveling merchants transport goods needed by the other party to sell, then buy goods needed by our side to bring back; going back and forth won't be in vain—especially now that we have our own ship, wasting empty cargo space is irreversible. But the actual situation is, rarely do bulk goods of cities need each other."

"For example, sugar produced in Guangdong can sell for a good price in Jiangnan, but Jiangnan porcelain and silk are also produced locally in Guangdong; these porcelain and other daily necessities transported to Taiwan across the sea are commodities in high demand, but deerskin produced in Taiwan has little demand here—Taiwan deerskin is mainly sold to Japan, while copper and silver exchanged back cannot be digested by Taiwan itself, and have to be transported to the Ming mainland."

"So when these goods are trafficked by small merchants, costs of empty return voyage must be added. Plus surviving a hand change almost every port passed; expenses and commissions generated in between make prices remain high when goods are trafficked long distances."

Chen Huamin nodded: "That is exactly my meaning. Now after Australians defeated the Zheng family, their power covers from Japan, Korea all the way to Hainan, Annam. Enabling us to allocate goods and plan destination ports ourselves, conducting long-distance trafficking. As long as we plan carefully and arrange reasonably, trying our best not to let the ship sail empty, we can earn greater profit with less cost."

He spoke excitedly, picking up a sheet of white paper and scribbling on it:

"Please look, both of you. Australians have a trade port on Jeju Island, where Japanese and Korean business can be done. From Jeju Island south, one can go all the way to Longkou to trade Shandong goods—incidentally doing bulk trade of Henan and Beizhili. From Longkou south again, one can go to Shanghai, then trade in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Then go directly to Hong Kong. Along this route Australians have great power; not only are shipping lanes safe, but various trade ports have complete facilities, many types of goods, and the key is no countless corrupt customs. Doing business can be called comfortable plus satisfying."

"Pity we can't go to Tianjin Wei—that is the big wharf of the North..."

"Tianjin Wei isn't under Australian control yet; somewhat imperfect. As long as it can have the level of that Shanghai wharf, Tianjin Wei isn't impossible to go to."

"If only Australians could take Shanghai in one go; now we still have to haggle with the government somewhat..."

Chen Huamin's sentence was actually extremely bold and arrogant, practically suspected of advocating rebellion. However, Liu Deshan and Qin Haicheng had both witnessed Australian abilities and weren't surprised at all.

Chen Huamin made up his mind, saying: "No time to lose. While news of Liu Xiang surrendering to Kun hasn't spread yet, we'll personally run a trip with the ship, treading out this new trade route. Just this time will be too hard; just returned and haven't caught breath before going to sea again!"

Liu Deshan smiled calmly: "No problem; effort not reached means no wealth! Only for this trip you plan, what to carry, where to go?"

"I have a plan. Look—" Saying this Chen Huamin took out a large sheet of paper from his sleeve. This was a folio tabloid newly started for sale in Guangzhou recently, called *Hong Kong Price Current*. Published every seven days. Peddled by children on streets. This newspaper was equivalent to commodity information. Published mainly were types, quantities, and transaction prices of goods transported to Hong Kong for trade from various places. It also published ship information, including schedules, cargo, and cargo space status of trade ships on shipping lanes. Additionally, supply and demand information of various places. Although this newspaper was mainly sold in Guangzhou, it was actually edited and published by the Ministry of Colonization and Trade's commercial representative office in Hong Kong.

Originally, although merchants in Guangzhou city were relatively familiar with Australian goods or Lingao goods, mostly it was by word of mouth from others; few people comprehensively and systematically understood details of goods. This *Price Current* exactly met the demand of large and medium merchants for commercial information—information flow in ancient society was very slow; commodity supply and demand information basically relied on years of information accumulation. Timely, explosive commodity supply and demand information couldn't be grasped; only a few big merchants could utilize government post horse systems to carry a little information.

Lingao had the convenience of wireless telegraphy; commodity and supply/demand information from Japan to Manila could be transmitted instantly to various ports under Lingao control. This had immense convenience for commodity circulation.

Promoting commodity circulation, encouraging merchants to transport and sell goods—this was the consistent aim of the Senate. Only when goods circulated could value be created. Otherwise, relying solely on the Senate's own ships and imperial merchants to do it could imply meeting increasingly large logistics demands. Moreover, the more frequent such commodity circulation, the greater various revenues the Senate obtained from it.

Chen Huamin opened the newspaper; it was already daubed with circles and lines by ink brush. His finger slid quickly on it, then stopped.

"Look, now a large batch of Leizhou white sugar arrived in Hong Kong; price has dropped. White sugar prices in Zhejiang and Nan Zhili are very high. If we transport white sugar to Shanghai, we can earn a sum! Load grain in Shanghai again, transport to Shandong and earn another ticket!"

"Good!" Liu Deshan nodded, "We set off right now."

"Since it's like this, I'll also take a share." Qin Haicheng took out a note from a drawer, "This is a one thousand tael note from Delong, cashable on sight, can be used directly as silver. Take it for turnover; count me a share if money is earned."

Liu Deshan and Chen Huamin were overjoyed. After all, they were small operations; especially after buying the ship, working capital was very tight. Now that big boss Qin Haicheng was willing to invest, this business could be done bigger. More importantly, with this extra fund, they could receive the new *Dongshanju* ahead of time—after all, equipping the new ship and hiring sailors also cost a large sum.

The two thanked him and immediately went out to arrange ship and goods.

"I'll go arrange receiving the ship right now. Huamin, you go notify the deputy captain first, immediately gather crew to prepare food and water, go to Huangpu to prepare boarding—this time we use the new ship. Notify deputy manager to let clerks unload ship cargo immediately overnight, then change full cargo load to Leizhou white sugar; then go to Delong to convert all silver we stored there into notes to bring along."

"Good! I'll do it immediately!" Chen Huamin cupped hands, bidding farewell hurriedly. Liu Deshan exchanged a few more pleasantries with Qin Haicheng. Qin Haicheng was very interested in their newly ordered ship, asking him to pay more attention to usage conditions—he also wanted to buy one for use in the Western Ocean.

After sending him out, standing on stone steps at the gate looking at Shamian by the White Goose Pool. A small steam launch with paddle wheels on outer sides spewed black smoke, towing a long string of barges past. Countless masts and sail shadows on the river moved or stopped; ships were loading and leaving, or stopping to unload—a bustling scene.

"Australians, ah, Australians..."

Guangzhou Huangpu Port had a clear sky for miles; gentle autumn breeze blew white clouds into wisps, slowly pushing from north to south. It was exactly crisp autumn air, a good day suitable for going out.

By the pier, a brand-new three-masted seagoing ship was moored at the berth. This ship was completely different from surrounding ships. Although retaining some shadows of Guangzhou ships, it looked more like a European-style seagoing ship: the hull showed typical Western shipbuilding techniques—keel and rib structure, nailed with strip planks, then covered with pitch. The bow was a sharp prow and sharp bottom more exaggerated than all Eastern and Western ships, plus a long bowsprit; hull lines were smooth and beautiful. At this moment, from the deeply pressed waterline, one could see the ship was fully loaded with cargo, remaining motionless no matter how tide beat it, only occasionally rising and falling with waves. Red and blue ribbons hung all over the ship, contrasting with the large three ink characters "Dong Shan Ju" on the bow. On the foredeck above the ink writing, an altar table with roast pig, fruit, wine, and water offerings was set up, showing the ship was holding a worship ceremony, ready to hoist sails and depart.

"Big Master..." Manager Liu called softly to Chen Huamin who was looking at the sea in front of the altar table. Chen Huamin woke up, waving his hand to Manager Liu: "Don't call me Big Master, making us look like bandits. In future just follow the custom of that group of Australians, call me Boss!"

"Yes, Big... Boss. Goods and money on the ship heavily registered; Second Mas... Second Boss has finished counting and verifying."

"Good, I know." Chen Huamin responded faintly, then turned back, continuing to face the sea.
