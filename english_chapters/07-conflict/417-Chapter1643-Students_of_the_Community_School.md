# Chapter 1643 - Students of the Community School

However, when he turned into Yongqing Street, Zhang Yu couldn't help stopping to linger. There was a vacant lot here where hawkers set up stalls, selling everything to eat and play—especially hawkers showing Australian films. Recently, Australian films had been produced particularly fast. Originally, after a new film was released, it would take at least half a year for another. Recently, there was actually a new film every month. It was almost the end of the month again, and he couldn't help checking if there were any new films.

Looking closer, they were still showing *The Burning of Zhongzuo Station*, *The Test*, *Lingao Scenery Such-and-Such Month Issue*, *Eunuch Sanbao Voyages to the Western Ocean*, and the like. No new films—so he felt disinterested. Beside him, hawkers selling rice noodles, oil cakes, and such shouted enthusiastically, making Zhang Yu's stomach grumble. However, he touched the few copper coins in his sleeve, swallowed hard, lowered his head, and hurried towards the community school.

Because he lingered for quite some time on the way, he was late arriving at the community school. The teacher of his grade indeed hadn't arrived yet—only "Senior Student" Wu Ming was leading everyone in reciting books. This Senior Student Wu was easiest to talk to, and since both liked Banditology on ordinary days, they had much common language.

As for the teacher, he was currently obsessed with the newly released Mark Six Lottery. This lottery had only suddenly appeared in the last few months but instantly swept through Guangzhou. When it came to gambling methods, Guangzhou Prefecture had five hundred if not a thousand. Among them were all kinds of tricks, but none were as simple and easy as this Mark Six Lottery. One bet didn't cost much money, and the lottery opened twice every ten days. It soon attracted a large number of citizens to participate.

The teacher was merely one of thousands of addicts. Once in class, a group of students was reading: "The Master said: 'At fifteen I set my heart on learning; at thirty I stood firm; at forty I had no doubts; at fifty I knew the mandate of heaven; at sixty my ear was obedient...'" when suddenly the teacher shouted high: "I have got it!"—scaring Zhang Yu, who was daydreaming. Then the teacher hurriedly rushed out of the room, leaving a class of students staring blankly at each other.

Later he heard from the senior student that the teacher found numbers in the book and even won a third prize of five taels of silver. Since then, the teacher's passion for gambling rose even higher. Last month, Zhang Yu actually saw the teacher at the entrance of a Mark Six Lottery shop, discussing hot numbers with a group of short-shirted laborers with flying spittle, completely lacking his lofty classroom appearance. Recently when he came to the community school, it was even more like a dragonfly touching water—completely going through the motions.

After reciting a few paragraphs absent-mindedly, the senior student announced: "The teacher wants everyone to carefully study the thirteenth essay in *Selected Essays of the Times*."

Good students honestly took out books to study. Li Ziyu beside Zhang Yu winked and made faces for a while. With tacit understanding, he nudged his good friends Zeng Juan and Chen Shixin in front and back. The four packed up their schoolbags and strutted out to play truant. Anyway, the senior student never cared.

Running out of the study room, the group of good friends talked and laughed, fully enjoying the fun of truancy. The owner of a book rental stall by the street saw them and waved: "Young Masters, the latest *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* comic book has arrived."

Several people stopped immediately, rushed forward to take one comic book each, found a bench in the crowd, and buried their heads to read. Shixin couldn't bear to spend money, so he just leaned his head behind to read.

Although the books printed by Australians used simplified characters, there was no problem after getting used to them. Moreover, the artwork was exquisite. Even a few old ladies read with relish—though of course they were reading drama stories, wiping a few tears when seeing tragic parts.

After a long time, the group reluctantly put the comic books back on the shelf, searched up and down again, and seeing no new books, paid money and squeezed out. They didn't forget to shout loudly: "Remember to notify us when new Three Kingdoms arrive!"

"Lord Guan is still formidable," the friends immersed in the book twittered in discussion.

"Next episode they should attack Xuchang."

"Fart! Didn't you see the preview for the next episode is Fleeing to Mai Castle?"

"It's scaring Cao Cao to death first before fleeing to Mai Castle—my grandma told me."

"Don't argue, don't argue. The next episode will be out in ten days."

"This comic book only comes out one episode every ten days. Really can't wait."

Talking and laughing, the group walked to the Pearl River side. Before them was a boat-shaped stone—exactly the Haizhu Stone, then one of the Eight Sights of Yangcheng, called "Pearl Sea Clear Waves." There was Wenxi Shrine built on the stone. Inside the shrine, heads were surging. They didn't go to join that liveliness, but turned to their "Secret Base" by the river: under a big banyan tree by the embankment.

Just as they sat down, Shixin couldn't wait to pull out an Australian charcoal pencil from his schoolbag and start copying the comic book he just watched. The other three were used to it. Zeng Juan proposed: "Let's play *Legends of the Three Kingdoms*."

Li Ziyu said while digging into his schoolbag: "Don't rush. Yesterday my family bought a new game from the hair-people."

Zhang Yu looked. "*Assistants of Great Ming*? Is it the hair-people's *Promotion Map*?"

"Much more fun than *Promotion Map*. Heard it was created by Prince Ma the Eight-Character Royal Exemption of the Bandit Song. Hair-people love to worship this worthy predecessor most—can protect family safety."

Everyone studied the instructions while listening to Li Ziyu's explanation and quickly got the hang of it. The more they played cards, the more engrossed they became.

"You collude with the Eunuch Party!"

"I want to submit a memorial to defend myself."

"The Senior Grand Secretary's royal favor is almost gone—hurry and impeach!"

After playing cards for an hour, Li Ziyu successfully reached the peak of rank and power. While the three packed up joking with each other, the topic quickly led to the Liaodong affairs. Thanks to the hair-people's military magazines, these few no longer treated generals' duels as the content of war. Articles read in magazines turned into their own thoughts, rushing out of their mouths:

"Must form a spear phalanx."

"Right—as long as we thrust to the right, the Tartars will be helpless."

"Shaking long spears can break arrow rain, oh."

"Only javelins can break the enemy!"

Zeng Juan felt deeply touched, shaking his head: "Even if the Tartars are good at fighting and one can match ten, those able to fight are no more than two hundred thousand. My Great Ming has a large population. Selecting one from a hundred—selecting two million elite spearmen—exterminating bandits and slaughtering Tartars is certain! Hateful that court officials are all wine sacks and rice bags. Kill all the lords in the court, and Liao affairs and Bandit affairs are not worth worrying about."

Zhang Yu sniffed at it. "Two million? Where to get so much money to recruit soldiers?"

The concept that fighting wars cost money also came only after reading Australians' military magazines.

"Liaodong has thousands of miles of fertile fields. Liao people were slaughtered empty. Can grant elite soldiers Warrior Land Grant Certificates. Recovering Liao means getting land. Would the generals and soldiers dare not use their lives?"

Before Zhang Yu could open his mouth, a steam whistle came from the river surface. A hair-people steamship pushed waves and drums, going upstream. Several sailors in short hair and short clothes were busy on the deck. Although long used to it, a wave of powerlessness still surged in everyone's heart.

Shixin also put down the charcoal pencil, muttering: "Hair-people's firearms are fierce. What to do? What to do?"

Li Ziyu sneered. "Although hair-bandit firearms are fierce, my Great Ming also has great killing weapons yet to come out."

Zhang Yu knew Li Ziyu's eldest uncle was a battalion commander in the Guangzhou Front Guard, so he often bragged about seeing the Great Ming's *Wubei Zhi*. He immediately asked: "Is it the Fire Dragon Out of Water you mentioned last time?"

"No, no." Li Ziyu shook his finger and learned to be bookish. "This object is called Flying Sky Sand Tube. Take two rockets tied upside down together. Hitting the enemy ship's awning can spray poison sand, specifically injuring hair-bandits' eyes."

"That's nothing extraordinary either."

"The most amazing thing is that after finishing spraying poison sand, the other rocket can ignite backwards to launch, flying back to our camp. Although hair-bandits have sharp firearms, they surely haven't seen this. They will be inexplicably terrified in their hearts. Our official troops attack taking advantage of the momentum—breaking bandits will be as easy as turning a hand!"

Everyone couldn't help praising and acclaiming. Zeng Juan was even more excited: "My Great Ming abounds in talents. Although hair-bandits are fierce for a time, they surely can't match my Great Ming's depth."

Zhang Yu thought carefully: *How many people can this divine weapon scare? How many times can it bluff? Wouldn't it be better to cancel the flying-back rocket and load more poison sand and gunpowder?* But Li Ziyu's family had military officers for generations and could see books they couldn't see. He was considered the leader of their small circle—so it was better not to question publicly.

Here Zeng Juan became indignant: "My Great Ming has such divine weapons but cannot use them, precisely because these corrupt officials collude with hair-bandits. Heard that the other day Purple Treasure Studio summoned Guangzhou gentry to hold some Sea and Heaven Feast Crowd of Warblers Gathering—lewd sounds and obscene language spread outside the building."

"To destroy a country, first corrupt its scholar spirit. How venomous are the hair-bandits' intentions!"

"Hair-bandits have no ruler or father, are licentious by nature, and are most used to colluding with shameless villains!"

They cursed vigorously. Shixin, who had been silent, said hesitantly: "Actually I feel hair-people are also not bad. They don't disturb people, keep promises in doing things. Even merchants like doing business with them."

Li Ziyu ridiculed: "You speak such good words for hair-bandits—why don't you go shave your head?"

Zhang Yu suddenly realized: "Could it be Shixin, you went to see hair-people?"

At this everyone cheered up, forcing Shixin to spit out the truth together. Shixin had to admit he was really curious a few days ago and ran to the Great World construction site by the river to play.

"That Great World is indeed magnificent." Shixin swallowed saliva. "Although not finished yet, there are iron frames inlaid with glass everywhere. Not painting dragons or phoenixes—having a different kind of shock. And those steel machines—really make people both respectful and fearful..." He watched excitedly, and couldn't help taking out drawing paper and charcoal pencil to start drawing.

Just as he was drawing vigorously, a voice sounded beside him: "The perspective here is wrong."

Awakened, Shixin looked back to see a smiling hair-person—tall and straight, obviously a True Hair-bandit. Shixin had seen True Hair-bandits from afar, but this was the first time being so close. He was somewhat afraid yet somewhat unwilling to submit. He was copying charcoal drawings because he saw unheard-of illustrations in hair-people's books. Although without a teacher, relying on his own talent, he always achieved seventy or eighty percent likeness. Viewers all praised it as wonderful. Now he was criticized as wrong?

That True Hair-bandit simply sat down beside him, talked to him for fully half an hour about perspective principles and painting techniques, and even took out a hair-person picture album. Those lifelike oil paintings and sketches opened Shixin's eyes wide. Finally, he even invited him to Lingao, saying there was a place specializing in learning painting there. After learning painting, there were plenty of jobs.

"You don't really want to go to Lingao, do you?" Li Ziyu said sternly. "That is following thieves! Besides, you have no academic degree. Painting well just makes you a painter artisan—how much money can you earn?"

"I don't know." Shixin's eyes were full of confusion. "Actually I really don't want to study. Don't want to take the *xiucai* exam—probably won't pass even if I take it. I just want to paint. Thinking of being able to paint such paintings... it's worth it even if I die."

Thinking of their own futures, everyone couldn't mock anymore and fell into silence.
