# Chapter 1240 - The Specter of the Lichun

His gaze hadn't escaped the cunning Paul's notice. He thought: *Good, good.*

"When can I take delivery of the goods I ordered?"

"Depends on how urgent your need is," the Kirishitan said slyly.

"You really are a devil consumed by greed," Zheng Zhifeng laughed heartily. "I'll add fifty percent as a rush fee. By the Spanish calendar: November first, I want all my orders delivered, including the ammunition."

"If you double the payment, I can guarantee on-time delivery." Paul smiled like the best salesman, a beguiling grin.

"Deal." Zheng Zhifeng nodded. "But only if your goods satisfy me will I pay—just like today."

The Kirishitan laughed coldly: "My word is good anytime." He raised a wine glass already prepared by the fire pit. "To our business."

The two drained their glasses. Zheng Zhifeng set his down and said: "You're very bold."

"I never do business with fools," Paul said. "Thank you for the wine—excellent flavor. Genuine rum."

"It's Australian," Zheng Zhifeng said. "Though one mountain can't hold two tigers, I don't dislike them at all. A capable and clever bunch."

"If you'll pardon my asking—are you planning to attack Takao this November and go to war with the Australians?"

Zheng Zhifeng was silent for a moment: "You really want to know?"

"I don't care at all whom you fight. But as thanks for your patronage, let me give you a small piece of advice—as long as that *Lichun* exists, no matter what you plan, you're doomed to defeat."

"Even using the cannons you provide?"

"That's right. Even equipped with my cannons—in open waters, that ship can seize any position at will. No matter how many ships you have, it won't matter. Do you have any ship that can sail freely against wind and current?"

Zheng Zhifeng's face went pale. These words were absolutely true. The Zheng family had been planning to attack Kaohsiung for a long time, but they'd never found a good way to deal with that black giant ship. After much deliberation, the only feasible plan was a surprise attack—catching the *Lichun* while anchored in port, deploying masses of ships to block the harbor, then attacking with fire ships.

"I'd guess your plan is definitely to use human-wave tactics—blockade the harbor, then fire attack. Just like you did to the Dutch in Zhangzhou Bay."

"It sounds like you have a better method?" Zheng Zhifeng countered.

"All right, let's discuss another deal." Mr. Paul began selling like the best salesman. "Do you know how many smoke-belching black ships the Australians have that can sail without wind?"

"There are four or five at Takao. Besides the *Lichun*, the others are smaller."

"Well, frankly your spies should be hanged—let me tell you, besides *Lichun*, there are at least eight more."

Zheng Zhifeng's hand trembled slightly. Nine black ships! This was truly shocking. But he didn't doubt the other's words: the Kirishitan before him was a formidable, extraordinarily capable figure. Among the Spanish in Manila, he'd heard many rumors about him. Perhaps some were exaggerated, but Paul's ability to gather and assess intelligence was universally acknowledged.

If the Australians really had nine black ships, even if they could burn the *Lichun* and several others with fire ships, the Australians could quickly launch retaliation.

Once they retaliated, the Zheng fleet couldn't possibly hold.

"Tell me about your deal." Zheng Zhifeng immediately sensed this man had something to sell.

"All right. Suppose—and I'm only saying suppose—the *Lichun* were yours..."

Zheng Zhifeng said nothing, but for an instant his face flashed with disbelief—clearly he found the idea absurd.

But, thinking of what possessing such an overwhelmingly powerful giant ship would mean, greed flickered in his expression.

"...If the *Lichun* were yours, with its size and firepower, it could at least counter those surviving smaller black ships. Then you'd have a chance to win. Wouldn't you?"

Zheng Zhifeng shook his head: "They say the Australians control the arts of water and fire—that's why these smoke-belching black ships can move freely at sea. But that's their secret. Even if we captured it, we couldn't use it. We'd still need sails—so what's the point?"

"There's plenty of point. First, the Australians would lose their navy's main force. Second, even with sails, how many ships at sea could stand against its size and firepower?"

Zheng Zhifeng was noncommittal, but seemed moved.



"Third, your concern over the water-fire arts is entirely unnecessary." A mysterious smile appeared on Paul's face.

"You know this technique?!" he asked in astonishment.

The cunning Kirishitan evaded: "They aren't the only ones who can use the water-fire arts."

"If you have a way to capture it and can teach us how to operate it, I'd be glad to discuss this deal."

"Good—then let's discuss the specific terms." The Kirishitan began laying out his demands and conditions. Obviously, some conditions exceeded Zheng Zhifeng's authority. Finally he said:

"I can't decide some of these. My eldest brother will have to decide."

"Of course, of course. Your eldest brother is the boss." The Kirishitan smiled and used a word Zheng Zhifeng didn't understand. "I believe with his vision he'll understand the terms I'm offering are very fair. Of course, you'll also need to honor the conditions you previously promised."

"A Zheng's word is as good as gold."

"Of that I have no doubt." Paul stood up. "Please contact me as soon as you have news. You know how to reach me. May God bless you."

The meeting ended quickly. Everyone inside left without a trace. All evidence was erased—only an empty, lifeless native village remained.

Li Huamei stood on deck, looking at Takao—Kaohsiung. The scene was one of bustling activity. Ships from Lingao, Hong Kong, and Jeju Island crowded the harbor. Countless goods and people were being loaded and unloaded. She didn't know and couldn't understand what the Australians were doing, but she was very uncomfortable with her first voyage as a "Naval Reserve Ensign."

The voyage had been in formation—all ships following the flagship. All captains had to constantly act according to the flagship's flag signals—for this purpose a signalman from the Navy had been assigned to her ship.

When the fleet was at sail, the sight of twenty ships of various sizes racing with full canvas was magnificent—truly awe-inspiring.

The voyage had been uneventful. They'd arrived safely at Kaohsiung. However, to this point, she and her crew hadn't received permission to go ashore. Everyone had to stay aboard awaiting notice.

From *Hangzhou* she could see vessels of all sizes in the harbor—Kaohsiung's port area was limited and the water not deep enough. Some larger ships could only anchor in the outer roadstead. From deck, she had a clear view of *Lichun*—that legendary black giant ship.

*If this warship were under my command, I could die happy.* Li Huamei sighed. Thinking that her first task was to somehow obtain detailed intelligence on *Lichun*, she couldn't help feeling dispirited. From the look of things, who knew how long it would take to gain the Australians' trust? She'd just arrived at Lingao only to be sent off to Taiwan. Both her undercover work and the search for her sister were indefinitely postponed. She didn't even know when she could return to Lingao... Thinking of this, she couldn't help thinking of Elder Qi—his gentle fingers and his silly smile...

Her face flushed hot. She instinctively pressed her hand to her cheeks.

In the midst of her wandering thoughts, a sailor called out:

"Captain! A messenger's come from the dock."

The messenger brought written orders from Ming Qiu: all crew to immediately disembark and undergo "purification."

Since *Hangzhou* hadn't undergone systematic reorganization in Lingao and still had many Europeans Li Huamei had recruited, after arriving at Kaohsiung there'd be catch-up: the entire crew went into the quarantine camp. *Hangzhou* would also undergo necessary "inspection."

Li Huamei at least was spared "purification," but being taken to the infirmary for a physical and the naval base women's bathhouse to bathe was unavoidable. She didn't object to bathing, but being watched by another woman while bathing still felt deeply humiliating.

However humiliating, she could only endure. Li Huamei viewed this as the Australians testing her. After the bath, her long hair that had once hung to her waist was cut short to shoulder length.

"You look much more spirited this way," said the female soldier who brought her new uniform.

"Really?" Li Huamei looked uncertainly at herself in the full-length mirror. She'd changed into a brand-new cotton-linen blend Year 32 blue naval officer's uniform. Compared to the naturalized citizen uniform she'd put together herself, this uniform was both crisp and well-fitting—wearing it made her look tall and slender. As a female military uniform, it came with a detachable long skirt, white naval web belt, and handsome naval short sword. Of course, she could hang personal weapons as well.

Only the brimless soft cap they issued felt superfluous—it couldn't shade the sun, and unlike a headscarf couldn't protect against dust and seawater. Probably one of the Australians' many quirks.

She curiously examined and fingered the uniform's little details: collar tabs, soft shoulder boards, arm patches, the Southeast Asia Company insignia... She knew the patterns and stripes on her shoulder boards indicated her rank in the Australian military: Reserve Ensign—in Ming terms, roughly a *bazong*?

"You're a Reserve Ensign now. In half a year, you might be a Lieutenant. There are many missions now—promotions come easily," the female soldier said as she adjusted her uniform, occasionally snipping off a loose thread.

"Oh, no need for all this fuss—I have a servant. Call Li Ying over to do this," Li Huamei said casually.

"You mean that black foreign devil? She'll be in the quarantine camp for a month," the soldier said. "I'm your orderly."
