# Chapter 1586 - Relying on Oneself

Accompanied by the *William Tell Overture*, they began to gorge themselves.

"This set of tableware of yours is really nice, and these knives and forks." Nan Gonghao was a literary man with quite a taste for life. Of course, he could see the value of the items before him.

"They were all got during the war booty auction. This set of knives and forks is Italian goods. The tableware is high-grade Kraak porcelain." Dongfang Ke smiled slightly, "It's a pity there is no real dry red wine. For such small lamb chops, even pairing with a one or two Euro table wine would be excellent enjoyment..."

Grapes couldn't be grown in such a place as Hainan Island. Whether it was Xue Ziliang or the Agricultural Committee, they had made futile efforts in this regard—even the attempt to make cider as a second best failed. The Senators had to be content with fruit wines brewed from various local fruits. Although they possessed a full set of brewing technology and process equipment better than the wineries of this spacetime, the pretentiousness of wine was obviously much higher than that of jackfruit wine.

"Is imported wine not okay?" Okamoto's mouth was stuffed with lamb.

"From Europe to here, it takes about a year or more. It's fine wine when setting off, but it becomes excellent wine vinegar when arriving at the port." Dongfang Ke said with some regret, "I asked Minister Hong to order a barrel of excellent Port wine in Macau, now I have to use it for dressing salads—it's a pity that olive oil can't be transported over long distances either. And olive trees can't be grown on Hainan Island..."

"The Minister Hong you mentioned, is it that Hong Huangnan from the Joint Logistics Headquarters?" Okamoto asked.

"That's right, it's him."

"No wonder there are good goods." Okamoto said, "Using public office for private gain."

"You are wrongly accusing him." Dongfang Ke raised the carved glass cup, gazing at the amber brandy liquid inside, "This is a new project he recently engaged in, affiliated under the General Office, recently undergoing renovation for trial operation. He happened to have some matters asking me, so I entrusted him to help me get some rare goods."

The four servings of roasted lamb chops were almost wiped out. Okamoto was already flushed faced, still continuing to exchange toasts with Nan Gonghao. He drank completely in the Chinese style, disliking adding ice, and liking to drink it all in one gulp.

Dongfang Ke got up and brought new dishes from the kitchen.

"Braised Lamb Liver." He uncovered the thermal cover on top.

A charming aroma permeated the air. The portion of lamb liver in everyone's plate was not much, decorated with herbs and poured with thick sauce.

"The taste is not bad, your skills are good enough to open a western restaurant!" Okamoto complimented.

Nan Gonghao didn't speak, but nodded to show agreement with Okamoto's view.

A trace of a mysterious smile appeared on Dongfang's face: "I bet you definitely don't know where this lamb liver came from..."

In an instant, both Okamoto and Nan Gonghao's faces turned white.

Loving music, good cooking skills, living in solitude, elegant taste... These characteristics were rapidly magnified countless times. Looking at the dark red sauce remaining in the plate, strong discomfort rose rapidly from the stomach. Okamoto saw Nan Gonghao's face turn frighteningly white all of a sudden.

Probably feeling that this reaction was a bit beyond expectation, Dongfang Ke hurriedly raised his hand: "Joking, joking. This is from Nanhai Farm, the best Changhua Goat..."

"Damn, don't play this when eating." Okamoto's complexion recovered slightly, "It's too atmosphere-spoiling."

"Sorry, sorry, I was just having fun for a moment." Dongfang Ke apologized repeatedly.

Removing the plates, Dongfang Ke served dessert again: cookies and hot coffee.

At this time, Dongfang Ke put on a serious face: "There are only the three of us here, safer than any restaurant and reception place. So, next, you two stop eating first and listen to me."

"Don't, are you going to trick us again?" Okamoto almost spat out the cookie in his mouth.

With a clatter, Dongfang tapped the soup bowl with a silver spoon.

"If you two don't want to become the protagonists of the Tomb Sweeping Day memorial activity at Cuigang Cemetery next year, you'd better listen to me continue."

Okamoto was stunned, looking straight at Dongfang. Nan Gong also stopped eating.

"The pistols issued to you before, do you remember to maintain them regularly these years?"

The two shook their heads blankly. After the Battle of Chengmai, most civilian Senators in the Senate had relaxed military training. Except for the pistol target shooting training organized by the General Office twice a year, many Senators had already thrown the matter of pistols to the nine heavens. Some people simply locked up the pistols and bullets together.

Dongfang's expression was not surprised, and he continued: "Then, do you have anti-stab vests?"

"Yes, one was issued to each person at the beginning." Nan Gonghao thought for a while, "Probably put together with my steel helmet."

"Mine should be there too, don't know where it was put, should be in some cabinet."

"Ask your maid to find it out when you go back tonight, and clean it up." Dongfang Ke said, "As for the pistol, take it out and disassemble it properly to wipe some oil. It's best to find text time to test fire it once."

"Wait, what do you mean?" Okamoto asked, confused.

"I don't know how to start, but during the Cultural Festival performance, Lingao may not be peaceful. You'd better all wear anti-stab vests and carry weapons to perform."

"What? You said there will be an incident at the art performance? Then demanding me to wear an anti-stab vest to go on the conductor's podium? Isn't it too ridiculous!" Nan Gonghao's face also changed, and the drunkenness dissipated instantly.

"Mn... wearing it inside the long shirt for performance will make you appear stronger. It's not too ridiculous, just will be a little hot, you endure it... Originally I also prepared to invite Liu Shuixin over and ask her to submit a report requesting to strengthen the Art Troupe's security—I think the Executive Committee won't refuse her request..." Dongfang started chattering uncharacteristically.

"You really don't understand the Executive Committee too well." Okamoto shook his head, "Those animals in the Executive Committee are most afraid of others saying they flounder on female Senators. Everyone pretends to be ascetics—haven't you noticed that their attitude towards female Senators is cold and polite? Moreover, this matter also doesn't conform to the procedure."

"Is that so..." Dongfang Ke hesitated. Obviously, the political situation of the Senate was much more complicated than he imagined. No wonder he went today...

"What do you know? Don't scare us, this joke is not funny!" Okamoto seemed to completely not recognize his partner. Why did this person in front of him suddenly become so cautious?

"I don't know anything, just guessing. But being prepared is always better than not being prepared. We have all been to the performance venue. Such a big place, relying on those few Garrison Battalion big-headed soldiers without long guns, can't be watched over..."

"What do you mean by this? will there be any major incident at the Cultural Festival?" The curiosity of the two was hooked, insisting he explain clearly.

Helpless, Dongfang Ke had to tell his observations and guesses: "I suspect that it is very likely that spies have already entered Lingao and are preparing to do a big job at the Cultural Festival! They probably already have insiders in the police department."

"Damn, with such major intelligence, why didn't you go report to the Political Security Bureau?!" Okamoto shouted out.

Nan Gonghao nodded: "I also think we should report to them."

"I have already reported." Dongfang Ke said, "Not only went to find Wu Mu, but also went to find the Battalion Commander of the Garrison Battalion." He was indignant, "They all gave me a standard 'official answer'."

"What is an 'official answer'?" Okamoto asked.

Nan Gonghao picked up: "Roughly it is 'We already know the situation you reported, we will handle it properly, thank you for your help to our work, blah blah'." Saying that, he recounted the matter of him going to find Wu Mu and Li Yayang.

"Grass, isn't this ignoring our Senator's power!" Okamoto got excited, "This bunch of animals in the Executive Committee! Don't treat Senators as a thing at all, is this the rhythm of wanting to be emperors themselves!"

Nan Gonghao shook his head: "It was problematic for you to find Li Yayang in the first place. What power does he have to arm Wang Qisuo? As for increasing troops, I'm not very clear about how our personnel are dispatched, presumably similar to the TG: without the order of the Executive Committee, does he, Li Yayang, dare to mobilize troops casually?"

"That is true, but Wu Mu, this spy chief, also gave such an irrelevant sentence, isn't it too ignoring Senators? Could it be he really treats himself as Himmler!" Okamoto yelled.

"Mn, I look at this Political Security Bureau as a bit unreliable." Dongfang Ke drank coffee, "The airs are put on quite sufficiently, seems haven't seen them do any serious business either."

"So, can't count on them?" Okamoto said.

"At least can't count on them completely. We have to have means of self-protection ourselves." Dongfang Ke stood up and walked into the inner room as he spoke. Okamoto and Nan Gong heard the sound of opening and closing cabinets. When he came out, he was holding a bundle in his hand.

"Since you all have anti-stab vests, I won't take out the cotton vests I asked people to prepare. But this—" He fished out a leather holster like magic again, "Quick draw holster, genuine American goods. Inside can hold a snub-nosed Smith & Wesson. Revolvers are relatively reliable—Liu Shuixin should have this gun, female Senators are all issued this kind. Okamoto, go borrow it from Liu Shuixin. You don't go on stage, just hang this under the armpit. No need for me to teach you how to use it, right?"

Okamoto curled his lips and took the holster.

"Okay, that's about it. If you haven't drunk enough, continue to drink. Want some more soup?"

The two art workers who seemed quite shocked expressed that they had eaten and drunk enough and should go back to rest.

"Mn, then~ take care, won't see you out, be careful on the road." Dongfang turned off the stereo and started cleaning up cups and plates.

"Okay, see you at the performance, thanks for the hospitality..." When Okamoto got up, he already staggered a bit, and Nan Gong hurriedly supported him.

Dongfang Ke stood at the window, watching the figures of the two colleagues walking towards the gate of the Bairen Dormitory Area. Suddenly, he pulled out his right hand from behind his waist, a Karambit knife appeared in his palm. He waved it a few times at the air, then turned around and sat in front of the piano, falling into contemplation.
