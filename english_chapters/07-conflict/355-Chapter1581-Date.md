# Chapter 1581 - Date

Even in another spacetime, singing on TV was usually subject to secondary mixing—idol stars or crossover celebrities often sounded terrible if they sang live... Those who dared to sing at live concerts had solid singing skills.

The result of the discussion among the several Managers was to go into the recording studio first, record the songs after post-production mixing, and then use lip-syncing without turning on the microphone during the performance. This could roughly guarantee the performance effect.

Then came the problem: there were many people in the Checkered Skirt Club who were proficient in IDOL and Japanese entertainment, but none who understood music. Recording records involved a series of professional techniques such as arrangement, mixing, and post-production, and Liu Shuixin, the only art consultant, did not understand these either. So the rehearsals these days were practiced with backing tracks, and they hadn't lip-synced even once.

Seeing the official performance approaching day by day and the recording still up in the air, several Managers began to get anxious. After an emergency meeting, they sent Zhang Berlin to condescend to ask Nan Gonghao for advice.

Zhang Berlin, a "Iron-Blooded Officer" of the Young Officers' Club who was criticized as a "Germanophile and Yellow Nazi", blowing the trumpet for big cannons all day long and occasionally popping up with some "politically incorrect" remarks from the old spacetime, was actually a senior idol otaku. These two attributes appearing in one person were a bit incongruous.

Seeing that the rehearsal of the folk orchestra over there was almost over, but Zhang Berlin was nowhere to be seen, Wu Ciren began to get anxious. He had sneaked away for half a day to come to the scene today to cheer up the girls—if those Senators in the National Police knew about it, they would definitely criticize him for not attending to his proper duties: recently, the National Police and Lingao Telecom were jointly carrying out an action to crack down on the theft of telecommunication lines. It was already very inappropriate for him not to direct the scene personally, let alone a pile of documents on his desk waiting for his review.

Just as he was getting anxious, he saw Zhang Berlin coming back slowly, beaming with satisfaction, obviously the negotiation went very smoothly.

"What? He agreed?"

"Yes." Zhang Berlin said with a feigned tragic expression, "He promised to start tonight—I paid a huge price, sigh."

"You make it sound like you sacrificed your body." Wu Ciren was in a good mood and couldn't help joking, "I'll figure out a way to get you a few bottles of lotion..."

"Don't sell rot (BL innuendo), I'm not a *fujoshi*." Zhang Berlin said, "Student Nan Gong is still very nice. He agreed as soon as I mentioned it—not hesitant at all. I thought he would have prejudices against us like Okamoto and Dongfang..."

"Think about it, AKB was also regarded as heresy back in the day. It doesn't matter if they despise our idol group: this way we can sell a sob story later." Wu Ciren said, "Having a sob story to sell is also the wealth of an idol group. If it weren't for the different national conditions, I would have asked them to go to the streets to hand out flyers long ago."

"Zhang Yunmi should be the one handing out flyers. We have to find bad weather with few people on the road, then we film some video footage, and then we can use it when filming the documentary: the first generation ACE handing out flyers in the cold wind of a rainy night..." As a senior idol otaku, Zhang Berlin's imagination ran wild.

"Don't talk about this nonsense first." Dongmen Chuiyu, who rushed over, interrupted the two's infinite brain supplementation, "I think let them sing a few times with the recording first, otherwise they won't even know the tune when they enter the recording studio."

"The three songs we chose are all in Japanese, how to sing along?"

"Ask Liu Shuixin to record it once first." Dongmen Chuiyu said, "Let's split up and act as soon as possible. The General Staff still has a pile of things waiting for me."

Outside the gate of Lingao Gymnasium, the Art Troupe was unloading and organizing, with musical instruments and equipment of all sizes piled on the ground. The rising morning sun cast red light on the faces of Okamoto and Nan Gonghao, but the expressions of the two artist Senators were not so bright.

"This Dongfang! What's going on? Why hasn't he appeared in time for such a major event like the on-site rehearsal!" Okamoto complained helplessly. He had long been helpless against this lazy deputy head, but watching the soldiers of the Garrison Battalion helping to move the equipment about to line up and leave, he couldn't help but get anxious.

"Probably slept in. Doesn't he like to sleep in?" Nan Gonghao was a little calmer. "I like it too." Saying that, he yawned hugely. He had spent all night last night doing post-production for the girl idols.

"Head, Nan Gong, the orchestra members have assembled. Let's go in first. It takes time to set up the equipment on stage anyway." Liu Shuixin, who hadn't shown her face for a long time, walked over and said.

This "Flower of the Senate" was wearing a light linen floor-length dress today, made of starched silk-linen blend fabric. The style was simple and elegant. At first glance, one might think it was a product of the old spacetime, but it was obviously newly made. The bright silver brooch seemed to reveal a little information: the Gothic flower font "Liu" was supported by two treble clefs "g" in a V shape, gorgeous with a trace of artistic atmosphere.

This was clearly not a product of the General Office's special supply store. Dongfang knew clearly: the clothing styles sold there were very simple, close to uniforms or work clothes, and there was absolutely no such object that looked very stylish at first glance.

*have to find out where she got it.* The thought flashed through his mind instantly.

"Okay, let's go in first. Also, we can use the telephone inside to call the Bairen dormitory area to see if Dongfang has gotten up." Okamoto said.

Lian Nishang walked hurriedly, the morning breeze blowing the skirt corners of her white sportswear. There were not many pedestrians on the road by the Wenlan River at this moment, and the direction leading to the gymnasium was even more empty. She had already seen the square in front of the Lingao Gymnasium.

Suddenly, she stopped because Zhuo Yifan appeared beside the lamppost in front of her at some point, smiling at her, as if he had something in his hand.

"Ah? Why did you arrive so early? I thought it would take you a while to find it yourself!"

The straight-talking female police officer showed her habitual "Naturalized Citizen Superiority" again, as if Young Hero Zhuo would get lost without her guidance.

Zhuo Yifan smiled without saying a word, thinking to himself that with such a magnificent building and such a wide road, if I got lost, I would lose all the face of my sect. He whispered: "I woke up early and had nothing to do, so I strolled around. I have heard of the Lingao Pancakes in the morning market for a long time. I happened to run into them, so I bought some." Saying that, he raised the paper bag in his hand, "Have you had breakfast? If not, you might as well taste it."

The paper bag contained multi-grain pancakes: with fried dough sticks, paired with rich spicy sauce and sweet soybean paste. although they were expensive due to the scarcity of eggs, so generally no eggs were added, and the taste was not as good as the original version, they were still welcomed by naturalized citizens and indigenous people after being launched. The comment was: filling and satisfying. It would be even more delicious if paired with a bowl of tofu pudding or soy milk.

As a pampered young master, he shouldn't be doing miscellaneous chores like buying breakfast personally, but helplessly, female police officer Lian Nishang was one of the few reliable sources of information for this "Dragon Crossing the River" locally. His peers all believed that she should not be slighted. When the eldest disciple of the Huashan Sect used such means of winning over and roping in, it looked quite decent.

Lian Nishang was stunned for a moment, lowered her head and said: "Thank you for your trouble, Young Master. I have eaten. You keep it first. Ah, Zuo Yami should have arrived already, let's go in quickly." After speaking, she quickened her pace again, and Zhuo Yifan followed happily.

Gymnasium Office.

"What? Confirmed that Senator Dongfang just left the dormitory area? Good, good, that's good! Thanks!"

Okamoto put down the telephone receiver, looked up and exhaled, and said to Nan Gong: "Okay, this brat really has this pissy nature! Fortunately, he has already gone out. We won't wait, let's do a sound check first."

The gymnasium was not cleared. First, the Art Troupe rehearsal only needed to occupy the space of the central basketball court. Second, the Senate's propaganda department hoped that the core naturalized citizens would receive more edification from the "mainstream culture". Minister Ding Ding specially sent reporters to track and report, and the *Lingao Times* also frequently published articles introducing "Australian Arts" recently. All units also publicized and encouraged naturalized citizens to observe the Cultural Festival rehearsals. Indigenous people were not stopped from entering, only they were not allowed to approach the Senators.

Zuo Yami arrived at the gymnasium early. Although the rehearsal of the Checkered Skirt Club was later, after the instrumental ensemble of the Art Troupe, today she was invited by her good friend Lian Nishang to practice fighting.

Of course, if it weren't for the deep impression of Eldest Young Master Zhuo's face from the last hasty glance, I'm afraid the young female police officer wouldn't have given up her morning sleep so easily.

She sat on the bench, took out a pack of Lingao-produced purple sweet potato strips and chewed on them, humming the accompaniment of the club's program, while watching with interest the "music band" commanded by the Chiefs carrying dazzling "Australian musical instruments" onto the temporary stage.

At this time, a burst of chattering noise came from the door. A teacher led a team wearing Fangcaodi school uniforms into the venue. This was the "Outstanding Student Art Observation Group" selected by the Education Department from the Fangcaodi Drama Club and the selection group members, specially came to receive the edification of Aus-Song advanced culture.

Fangcaodi had changed into summer uniforms. Boys wore white short-sleeved shirts and navy blue trousers; girls wore white sailor collar pullovers, red scarves, and blue pleated skirts, constituting a scene that looked pleasing to the eyes of the Senators.

Needless to say about the indigenous people, even among the naturalized citizens, this team caused a burst of admiring tsk-tsk sounds. Some young girls almost had fire spewing out of their eyes.

Even Zhuo Yifan, who was not very interested in "Australian customs", was attracted by the team: this kind of neat beauty containing youth was something he had never seen before.

Zhuo Yifan and Lian Nishang happened to be blocked by this team at the end of the passage. The Huashan Hero was very curious about the "juvenile Fake Australians" in front of him, not only their strange Australian clothing colors, but more eye-catchingly, these boys and girls appeared extraordinarily lively, glowing with health, and their stature also appeared much taller than their peers in Great Ming.
