# Chapter 1247 - Beneath Anping City

Two hours before the First Fleet broke into Liaoluo Bay, Xue Ziliang and his detachment were quietly traveling on the Shijing River.

It was 4:00 AM, usually the darkest time before dawn. But Xue Ziliang dared not be careless at all—the moon in the sky was too bright. If not for the heavy cloud cover today, he really wouldn't dare to travel so blatantly on the river surface.

The motorboat's engine vibrated slightly under the muffler—this motorboat was originally a lifeboat on the *Fengcheng*, capable of holding up to twenty-four people plus necessary rations and water.

Due to limited gasoline, these lifeboats had been used for a while during the initial landing period and then mothballed. This time they were specifically unsealed for use—the Machinery Department had specially manufactured matching mufflers.

The previous night, they had driven this motorboat into Liaoluo Bay. Relying on gasoline supplies in goat-skin bladders towed behind the speedboat, they arrived at Baisha Village at the mouth of the Shijing River that night and hid locally.

Baisha Village was only six kilometers from Anping. Even traveling at economical speed, it wouldn't take an hour to arrive. The propeller churned the river water, sending out a low sound of spraying water. Perhaps because they were at a considerable distance from land, the shore seemed quiet, without a sound.

He glanced at his luminous watch; it was just past quarter past four. They would arrive at Anping soon. From now on, everything had to be as careful as possible—because around this time, some people started to get up and move about.

Of course, even if someone discovered their strange small boat now, it wouldn't necessarily pose a threat. Common carriers would at most treat it as a "strange tale" or interesting gossip on the spot; they wouldn't necessarily run enthusiastically to Anping to report it immediately. Even if they went to report, the motorboat's speed was much faster than theirs.

The moon in the sky dimmed and brightened, making Xue Ziliang feel habitually very nervous—he would rather execute combat missions on pitch-black cloudy nights. A silhouette suddenly exposed under moonlight often invited fatal bullets. Fortunately, in this spacetime, besides them, no one could fire threatening bullets from three hundred meters away, nor would they encounter sudden strafing from machine guns or automatic rifles.

Sitting in the small boat were the team members for this operation. Twelve members, armed to the teeth. Except for their locally-made uniforms and BDUs being a bit rustic, they were no different from the Force Recon team he had commanded back then. Their faces were also blackened with camouflage paint.

They were equipped with the FAL automatic rifle short-barrel, folding-stock carbine version, plus one machine gun and two shotguns. On the deck in the middle of the small boat, something was wrapped in canvas and rope.

On this wide and unobstructed great river surface, the team members were silent, only looking around anxiously from time to time, listening intently. Silence reigned over the wide river surface; not a single ship was active. Only occasionally could a few lonely fishing lights be seen. The river water lapped against the boat's hull, making soft sounds.

When the luminous watch on Xue Ziliang's wrist pointed to 4:30, the motorboat's engine sound disappeared. The hull slid slowly, finally stopping. Xue Ziliang carefully observed the pre-arranged rendezvous point on the river surface. He signaled the shore with a tactical flashlight. Once, twice... After the third time, a responding light signal lit up from the darkness on the shore—these were the two foot-mobile pathfinders he had sent out last night, responsible for guiding their landing.

Xue Ziliang gave a soft whistle, cutting through the dark night sky, telling the team members the landing point was reached. The members sitting on both gunwales picked up paddles together and rowed carefully. Xue Ziliang held the engine handle with his right hand to adjust speed, his left hand holding the compass as level as possible before his eyes to maintain an accurate angle with the navigation beacon on shore.

10 minutes later, Xue Ziliang heard the member he placed at the bow for lookout whisper "We're here." He quickly looked up: they were very close to land, less than 50 meters. At this moment clouds obscured the moon; he could vaguely make out a black earthen embankment directly ahead, with many trees on it. There was a stench of rotting water weeds in the air.

Driven by inertia, the motorboat drifted toward the beachhead. Before long, a slight friction sound was heard between the boat bottom and the river beach; the motorboat ran aground on the sand.

A black figure appeared before them. His chest and back had phosphorescent recognition strips; it was the team member coming to meet them. He gestured, guiding the landing spot. Xue Ziliang tiptoed around the piled weapons and equipment, walking to the bow. He extended a leg over the gunwale to probe the river beach, holding onto a cable to prevent his foot from sinking into mud. According to prior reconnaissance, the river beach in this area was of the sand-gravel mix type, but he still had to be extremely careful.

In the ensuing 5 minutes, Xue Ziliang observed the direction of Anping with infrared binoculars. This city was 500 meters away, separated from them by low sand dunes and bushes. But at this moment it was silent there; their arrival hadn't aroused any alertness.

A road extended from Anping, passing about one hundred meters from the sand dunes.

The team members carefully unloaded the equipment from the boat one by one, then dragged the empty motorboat behind the sand dunes to hide it, fixing it with sharp iron stakes and cables to prevent it from drifting away with the tide.

Xue Ziliang climbed up the sand dune and observed Anping City with infrared binoculars. This originally small coastal town, after being rebuilt by Zheng Zhilong, was grand in scale. Surrounded by sturdy bluestone walls, a towering water gate stood on the river surface. A stone slab bridge 2.5 kilometers long spanned the river surface connecting Jinjiang and Nan'an counties—the famous Anping Bridge.

Around Anping Bridge, many ships of various sizes were anchored. Among them, several were the three-masted gunships highlighted by the Intelligence Bureau.

But their target wasn't these ships—that was the Navy's task. Their primary mission was to "decapitate" the Zheng family leadership, trying to kill several key figures.

With just these few people, storming Anping was obviously impossible. But Anping had only a few exits. As long as they controlled a few access roads, they could effectively snipe enemies when they fled. Even if they couldn't catch them all, they could at least inflict heavy casualties.

He checked his watch. According to the plan, the detachments controlling the other two roads should have arrived. But so far they hadn't sent the prescribed radio signal, which made him somewhat anxious.

He turned and ran back down the sand dune, whispering orders for them to prepare weapons. The object wrapped in canvas was untied. Inside was a small disassembled cannon. The disassembled metal parts had been wrapped in gunny sacks beforehand to prevent noise in case of collision.

Under his command, the cannon parts were moved up the sand dune, followed by ammo boxes. Ying Yu opened the toolbox and began assembly. He worked quickly and quietly.

The position of this sand dune was chosen based on the results of multiple on-site reconnaissances. First, it could effectively control the road from Anping to Nan'an. Second, the distance from here to the center of Zheng Zhilong's residence inside Anping Town was only 704 meters. The idea of directly shelling the enemy's nerve center was very tempting. Although the Navy fleet's arrival would bring a fiercer baptism of artillery fire to Anping, they couldn't strike the enemy's vitals so accurately.

"It's up to you now."

"Don't worry. You should worry about the craftsmanship of Lin Shenhe and the Machinery Factory bunch," Ying Yu said.

He measured the bearing with the compass in his hand, then set the artillery position accurately on the compass point Xue Ziliang pointed out to him, the muzzle pointing straight at Zheng Zhilong's residence. Then, he carefully rotated the elevation screw of the gun, striving to hit the center of Zheng Zhilong's residence with the first shot.

As long as a few shells fell into the center of the residence, the shock effect caused would be enough to make the opponent lose the will to fight—after all, storming Anping Town's reinforced walls would take some effort; getting the enemy to flee without fighting would be best.

Used this time was the so-called "Trial Year 32 Battalion Gun" designed by Lin Shenhe. The design intention of this gun was to provide lightweight artillery support for battalion-level units, replacing the 12-pounder mountain howitzers currently performing this task. Therefore, weight had to be minimized for mobility, low logistical dependence, capable of high-angle fire, while ensuring certain shooting accuracy and lethality.

The "Trial Year 32 Battalion Gun" was a multi-purpose field gun designed based on these requirements.

This gun used 70mm caliber, rifled breech-loading. Although not a recoil-operated gun, it used a friction-type recoil absorption device. Because the gun body was light, recoil absorption efficiency was relatively high. Rate of fire was greatly improved.

To reduce weight, the 70mm rapid-fire gun appropriately shortened the barrel length. The ammunition used was mainly low-chamber-pressure high-explosive shells and shrapnel. Shells used separate-loading metal cartridge cases to match the vertical sliding wedge breech block used by the gun. The vertical sliding wedge breech block facilitated rapid loading at high elevation angles, and balanced productivity under current industrial levels with weapon performance—wedge breech blocks were simpler in structure than screw breech blocks, simpler and faster to operate, and safer.

Because of the rifled structure, the decrease in accuracy and muzzle velocity brought by shortening the barrel could be compensated. But considering that pointed cylindrical shells fired by rifled guns couldn't ricochet, solid shot was no longer issued.

While reducing the gun weight, the shooting elevation of the 70mm rapid-fire gun increased significantly—up to 80 degrees, possessing certain curved-fire capabilities.

Roughly speaking, this was a knockoff of the Japanese Type 92 Battalion Gun. However, limited by materials and craftsmanship, the gun's dimensions and weight were larger than the Type 92 Battalion Gun.
