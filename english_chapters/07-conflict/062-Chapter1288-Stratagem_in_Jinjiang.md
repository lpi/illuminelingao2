# Chapter 1288 Stratagem in Jinjiang

"Where is the General's body now?" Qian Taichong was very concerned about this question.

"I preserved the General's head with lime when I escaped ashore and hid it in a secret place at the mouth of the Jiulong River. But I don't know if the body left on Xiamen Island was looted by the *Kun* thieves."

After "recovering the lost territory", the generals indeed looked for Zheng Zhilong's body. However, the Japanese mercenaries who accompanied Zheng Zhilong on his final journey either died in battle or were captured. Those who escaped followed Tong Tailang to Jinjiang—since no one cared about Zheng Sen, naturally no one came to ask Tong Tailang. The generals found nothing. As time passed, this matter was forgotten. After all, the realistic struggle for power and profit was more urgent.

"This makes it easy to handle." Qian Taichong thought. It was indeed a pity that the body was missing, but it would be fine as long as the head was there.

"Stupid fellow, bumpkin!"

Qian Taichong thought: The generals of the Zheng family only knew how to fight for power and profit, and still hadn't shed the merchant's short-sightedness of only chasing immediate interests. They didn't consider the political significance of burying Zheng Zhilong at all. Zheng Zhilong was not a grassroots commoner, but a dignified regular military officer of the Imperial Court. Hosting a funeral for him was equivalent to announcing to the world that he was Zheng Zhilong's heir. The funeral procession itself had immeasurable significance.

"Send a meticulous person to quietly retrieve the General's remains from the mouth of the Jiulong River first." Qian Taichong instructed, "Everything must be done in secret."

"I know this."

"I will go to Fuzhou tomorrow to seek an audience with the Lord Governor. You must protect the young master well here." Qian Taichong said, "Don't go out, try to have as little contact with people as possible, and don't mention the whereabouts of the Lord Governor and me."

Tong Tailang nodded solemnly.

Qian Taichong's trip to Fuzhou was very smooth. When Zou Weilian heard that someone had brought news of Zheng Zhilong's legitimate son, he immediately gave instructions to meet him in person. When he heard that Zheng Sen had escaped from the *Kun* thieves and was currently living in the Jinjiang County School, he couldn't help but be overjoyed. He praised Qian Taichong, Tong Tailang and others as "commendable for their loyalty and courage", expressed deep condolences for Zheng Zhilong's death, and then asked when Zheng Zhilong's funeral arrangements would be handled so that he could go to offer condolences in person.

"After the General was killed, his remains were ravaged by the *Kun* thieves. Only the head was desperately brought out by his subordinate General Tong. It is now enshrined in a temple, preparing to choose a date for offering sacrifices and opening the mourning hall..."

"This matter should not be delayed." Zou Weilian said with a frown, "Since the General has died for the country, he should still be buried for peace. Now that a month has passed and the mourning hall has not yet been opened, speaking of it, the rumors in the government and the public are not good."

Filial piety comes first in all virtues. Zheng Zhilong had been dead for almost a month, and the Zheng family generals had "recovered" all places in Zhangzhou Bay, but up to now there was not even a rumor of holding a funeral. Isn't it too absurd? If it were an ordinary official family, the censors would definitely impeach them if they heard of it.

Regarding this matter, Qian Taichong had a plan in mind long ago. At that moment, he wiped his tears, pretended to be heartbroken, and roughly described Zheng Sen's current situation.

"...Young Master Sen is now living under someone else's roof. Even a meal and tea depend on others' pleasure, let alone hosting a funeral and opening a mourning hall?" Qian Taichong burst into tears when he spoke emotionally, half true sentiment and half affectation. Suddenly he stood up from the chair, lifted his robe and knelt down to perform a grand salute, "I beg Your Excellency to make the decision for Young Master Sen!"

The attendants hurriedly helped Qian Taichong up, and Zou Weilian immediately stated that he would definitely "make the decision" for Zheng Sen.

Zou Weilian's followers were greatly surprised that day. The Lord not only personally met with this scholar with a shabby look, but also "had a very happy conversation". In the end, he even sent the servants out, and the two talked secretly in the warm pavilion until lighting time.

Qian Taichong returned to Jinjiang County seat with ambition: Just as he estimated, Zou Weilian was extremely interested in supporting Zheng Sen to restrain the Zheng family generals. He not only had a happy conversation with him and gave him enough oral promises, but also took out practical things.

First, expedite the implementation of Zheng Sen's succession to the post. Qian Taichong had already drafted Zheng Zhilong's "last memorial" and asked the Lord Governor to submit it on his behalf. As for the specific procedures for succession, they would be handled by Zou Weilian's advisors and could be implemented very quickly.

Secondly, Zou Weilian promised that once Zheng Zhilong's funeral was held, he would personally lead the provincial high officials to be present to offer sacrifices, so as to fully demonstrate the Fujian officialdom's support for Zheng Sen. At the same time, he would secretly send hand-written letters to the Prefect of Zhangzhou and the mistytrates of subordinate counties, asking them to give Qian Taichong full convenience in his actions.

Finally, he also promised to give Qian Taichong support financially and even militarily to ensure that the legitimate son of the Zheng family could smoothly inherit the position of the family head.

"This is General Cao." Zou Weilian ordered a Squad Leader from the Governor's Standard to be summoned, "Don't look at his youth, he is a loyal and righteous man..."

Qian Taichong looked at this young assistant general. He was very burly and sturdy, with a few sparse whiskers on his round face and pointed chin, upturned nostrils and small eyes. He looked quite capable and vigorous. He seemed a little familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere.

"Squad Leader Cao once accompanied General He on a campaign against the *Kun* thieves. Under the city of Chengmai, our army was unfavorable. Fortunately relying on General Cao to fight to the death as the rear guard, Commander-in-chief He was able to escape from the *Kun* thieves' heavy siege." Zou Weilian laughed.

Only then did Qian Taichong suddenly realize that this young general, like himself, was also a survivor of the defeat at Chengmai back then.

"This humble general is incompetent!"

"Don't mention things in the past anymore." Zou Weilian waved his hand, "This is Mr. Qian. You should work together in the future to defend our Fujian sea frontier together."

The two chanted agreement in unison.

"I will issue an order tomorrow to transfer Squad Leader Cao to lead one hundred soldiers to move to Jinjiang to secretly help you." Zou Weilian laughed, "You must work together with one heart afterwards."

"Yes, thank you, Your Excellency!"

Although there was an additional "supervisor" by his side, Qian Taichong thought it was not a big problem: They were currently weak and indeed needed manpower. Moreover, Cao Xiangjiao was the Governor's man, so it was good to use him to boost the facade.

On the contrary, Tong Tailang had a grudge. Like most people in the Zheng Group, he instinctively had great vigilance against the government. But Qian Taichong expressed that to make the Lord Governor exert effort, this little price was necessary. Besides, with someone from the Governor's side in Jinjiang City, other factions would have to be wary if they really harbored any "intentions detrimental to the child".

"We are very weak. To rely on the Governor's power, we can only compromise out of consideration for the general interest." Qian Taichong explained patiently. He knew deeply that Tong Tailang was a rare person with both loyalty and righteousness who could risk life and death at any time for the "great righteousness". In the future, he would inevitably be a rare trusted general by Zheng Sen's side. To assist Zheng Sen in regrouping, he must do a good job of winning him over, "As the saying goes, lack of forbearance in small matters upsets great plans. We must endure."

After Qian Taichong met with Zou Weilian, the originally wait-and-see attitude of the Jinjiang Magistrate suddenly became enthusiastic. Not only did he send people to deliver rice and firewood to inquire every two or three days, but he also indicated that they could live in the county school as long as they wanted, and no longer urged them to move out to make room. The situation of this group of people improved greatly.

In this way, not only was Tong Tailang and his group greatly convinced by Qian Taichong, but the stragglers who originally thought they had nowhere to go and were hiding in the county school also gained confidence in Qian Taichong and his group, and one after another "actively moved closer to the organization".

Qian Taichong was satisfied with this, thinking that the Jinjiang County seat had never been the Zheng family's territory. Being here could only be considered a temporary stay, and it could not be used as a base for regrouping. It was necessary to seize a territory of their own in Zhangzhou Bay!

"We want to retake Anping." Qian Taichong said.

The reason for setting the target as Anping was because Anping was the center of the Zheng family. It was not only the location of Zheng Zhilong's mansion, but also the location of the Zheng clan's ancestral graves and ancestral hall. As the young master of the Zheng family, Zheng Sen's re-entry into Anping had self-evident symbolic significance. It had a great appeal to the Zheng clan members and generals who were currently scattered in various places, had no ability to participate in the hegemony of Zhangzhou Bay, and were watching.

Once Anping was occupied, the young master would secure the "orthodoxy" of the Zheng Group. With Zou Weilian's "endorsement" on the official side, he would occupy half of the country in terms of morality and legal tradition.

Economically speaking, Anping was an important trading port for trade with Japan. Many Anhai ships bound for Japan departed from here. Seizing Anping was equivalent to grasping a considerable portion of the trade share with Japan. Some Anhai ships that did not return when attacked would choose to defect to the young master. Maritime power and economic strength would then both be available.

Tong Tailang had no objection to choosing Anping, only a little worry, saying:

"Our troops are insufficient. We need to win by surprise to win."

He had long been coveting Anping, which was close at hand, so he had been sending people to investigate quietly. Zheng Zhiguan had several hundred family soldiers and personal guards, as well as more than a thousand armed tenants—in order to guard against invasion by other generals, he was on guard day and night. It would still be difficult to capture Anping solely relying on the three hundred stragglers from various sources gathered under Tong Tailang. Of course, if planned well, it was not completely without opportunity. Mercenaries from Japanese samurai backgrounds like Tong Tailang were best at small-scale fighting and sneak attacks, and were daring recklessly.

"We cannot use force—Zheng Zhiguan and the young master are uncle and nephew after all. We must absolutely not leave this handle for gossip." Qian Taichong seemed to have a confident plan, "We want to retake Anping peacefully."

"Although Anping is now in ruins, Zheng Zhiguan even made excuses for a farm in Jinjiang County, let alone Anping City?"

"It will be the Winter Clothing Festival on the first day of the tenth lunar month (Nov 12, 1632) very soon." Qian Taichong said, "The Zheng family ancestral hall has always offered sacrifices to ancestors and burned winter clothes. The young master is the legitimate son of the Zheng family and has inherited the hereditary position. According to custom, he should return to the ancestral hall to preside over the sacrificial ceremony—even if he is young and cannot attend to affairs, he must be present. We will return to Anping in the name of ancestor worship!"

"What if Zheng Zhiguan obstructs?"

"He dares not do so. Otherwise he will put himself in a position of 'disloyalty and unfilial piety'. Even if he goes to sea to be a pirate in the future, I'm afraid he won't be able to muddle along. At that time, we will list his ten major crimes. It will be the virtuous attacking the wicked, open and aboveboard, with proper title and smooth words!"
