# Chapter 1621 - Giving Gifts

It was nearly eight o'clock in the morning. Lu Xuan had been waiting in the reception room of the Arbitration Tribunal office building for over an hour.

He wasn't waiting to be summoned; as a Senator, he could request to see another Senator at any time during office hours, unlike naturalized cadres who needed a formal summons. The reason he had arrived so early and holed up here was to wait for a time when few people would be around.

Lu Xuan had chosen his spot well. From where he sat, he had a clear view of the second floor of the office building. The easternmost room on that floor belonged to Ma Jia—current Executive Committee member, Director of the Arbitration Tribunal, and Director of the Political Security Bureau. Through a row of large glass windows facing the street, Lu Xuan knew that Ma Jia had arrived at his office promptly at eight o'clock. Shortly after Ma Jia took his seat, An Xi, the Director of the Arbitration Tribunal's General Office, and several naturalized cadres entered Ma Jia's office, apparently for their daily morning meeting. An Xi had only just left a minute ago. Waiting until An Xi sat down at his own desk, Lu Xuan rose briskly, walked out of the reception room, and headed straight for the office building.

Relying on his status as a Senator, Lu Xuan arrived at Ma Jia's office door without obstruction. An Xi's office was right next door; as Lu Xuan passed by, the door stood open, but An Xi, buried in his work, didn't notice him hurry past.

Although the man was a stranger, Ma Jia's secretary could tell from Lu Xuan's appearance and bearing that this unfamiliar visitor was a Senator. After checking the ID Lu Xuan handed over, she prepared to salute and greet him, but Lu Xuan quickly stopped her with a hushing gesture and whispered, "Please announce me. I want to see Committee Member Ma."

No naturalized secretary was allowed to block any Senator's request for an audience—this was an unwritten rule for all Executive Committee members. The secretary indeed did not stop him, but neither did she usher him into Ma Jia's office.

"Please wait a moment." She went inside, and a moment later, An Xi walked out.

"You are..." An Xi didn't recognize him at first. Although they had spent some time together in the "Basic Labor Team" years ago, they hadn't seen each other in quite a while.

This Senator stood tall and imposing outside Ma Jia's office, holding a file in his hand.

However, An Xi's position as Office Director wasn't for show; in less than a minute, he retrieved the relevant data from his memory.

"Old Lu? What brings you here?" There was obviously no scheduled meeting with Lu Xuan on Ma Jia's itinerary today. An Xi recognized the suddenly appearing Lu Xuan. He knew that Lu Xuan had been a civil servant from the system back in the old world, and also a law major. Moreover, like An Xi himself, Lu Xuan held a distance-learning degree—something the Law Society didn't think much of.

At the beginning of the landing, people with legal backgrounds were generally treated as basic labor. In that institution, which was practically a concentration camp for temporary workers, An Xi and Lu Xuan had stayed together for about a year, doing countless miscellaneous jobs. In An Xi's memory, Lu Xuan's performance at the time had been similar to his own: he never picked and chose tasks, and he could endure any hardship. Apart from burying his head in work, he rarely bragged or chatted with other Senators.

Because there was little else to do at the time, people in the legal field often gathered to discuss future legal issues on paper. But Senator Lu never participated in such discussions; he didn't even seem interested in listening.

Over time, An Xi even suspected that apart from being able to write the word "Law," Lu Xuan had nothing in his belly that touched upon legal studies, so he stopped paying attention to him. Later, when recruiting members for the Law Society, Senator Lu, who had no interaction with the legal-circle Senators, was naturally forgotten. In fact, even if someone had mentioned him, Ma Jia and the others might not have agreed to approve his admission: in their view, his certificate didn't even count as a diploma, let alone qualify him for legal studies.

Lu Xuan's sudden appearance here now seemed very strange to An Xi.

Facing this old acquaintance who wasn't particularly nostalgic, Lu Xuan appeared relaxed. He took the initiative to step forward and shake An Xi's hand, smiling. "Director An, long time no see. You're looking better than ever."

"Not at all, not at all—it's all in service of the Senate and the people. You're a rare guest here. I heard you went to the Grand Library afterward, but I haven't seen you around much..." The professional instincts of an Office Director kicked in quickly.

"I'm doing policy research and data compilation at the Grand Library. I'm here to see Committee Member Ma today." Seeing he couldn't bypass this director, Lu Xuan simply told the truth. "How about it? Does Committee Member Ma have time?"

"What are you saying? We're all Senators here. Unless he's in a meeting or on a business trip today, there's no reason he wouldn't have time." An Xi was very enthusiastic. "Come, come, come—I'll take you in." With that, he took Lu Xuan by the arm and led him into Ma Jia's office.

Ma Jia was somewhat puzzled by the tall Senator who appeared before him. According to his schedule, the person he was expecting should have been Ji Xin.

"Executive Ma, this is Senator Lu Xuan. We both served in the Basic Labor Team originally... uh... speaking of which, he counts as part of our legal system too..."

"Legal system?" Hearing An Xi say this, Ma Jia ran through the members of the Law Society in his mind and found no impression of Lu Xuan at all. Listening to An Xi's halting introduction, he got a rough idea of Lu Xuan's situation.

What business would someone from the Grand Library have with him?

Although puzzled, he took the initiative to speak: "Hello, please sit." He stood up from behind his desk and shook hands with Lu Xuan—polite and dignified. Years of experience as an Executive Committee member had erased any trace of the petty clerk he used to be.

As Lu Xuan sat down before him, Ma Jia carefully observed this Grand Library Office Director of whom he had almost no impression. The man was roughly his own age—early thirties—with a slightly bronzed complexion that seemed ill-suited to the position of an office director. His hair was short, his eyes spirited. He wore a locally produced cotton shirt with no decorations, clean and tidy, no different from what Ma Jia himself was wearing. But his well-proportioned build, proper posture, and restrained smile exuded a certain capability.

"Executive Ma, hello. I am Lu Xuan from the Grand Library Office." Through this re-introduction, Lu Xuan repositioned himself before the Executive Committee member who was similar in age to himself.

Ma Jia nodded. "One doesn't visit a temple without a cause. We're all comrades in the same Senate, so please speak."

"A while back, based on some issues that surfaced after the terrorist attack, our Grand Library conducted a research project on clarifying departmental responsibilities and promoting the unification of power and responsibility. As I am currently the only Senator in the Grand Library with a legal background, I undertook this project. Although I majored in law, my first degree was from a secondary technical school, and my later associate and bachelor degrees were obtained through in-service education. In terms of professional legal expertise, I'm at best at the level of vocational training. Undertaking this task has been quite strenuous. Moreover, according to our Grand Library's plan, this project is to be published as an issue of *Policy Research* and submitted to the Executive Committee. To ensure the rigor and feasibility of the subject, and with the approval of the Curator, I've taken the liberty of disturbing Executive Ma today with the first draft of this research report. My purpose is to ask Executive Ma to coordinate and invite a few experts from the Law Society to review it. This report not only involves many professional legal issues, but according to our vision, its final implementation will also rely on the experts of the Law Society." After finishing, Lu Xuan presented the file he had brought to Ma Jia with both hands.

An Xi listened to Lu Xuan's eloquent speech from the side. When he heard that the Grand Library wanted to make a proposal in the direction of law, he appeared somewhat surprised—proposals involving legal matters had always been the monopoly of the Law Society. What surprised him even more was Lu Xuan's performance: his neither humble nor arrogant attitude, and his simple, clear, and concise report—it all looked very professional. An Xi had muddled through the system for a few years before crossing over; he had seen this kind of temperament in the secretaries of leaders from large agencies. But this completely failed to match the Lu Xuan in his memory.

Ma Jia nodded slightly, not revealing the surprise Lu Xuan had expected. He opened the file and saw a handwritten report. The handwriting was well-spaced and written in a single flow; there was not a single correction in the entire text, nor a single character he couldn't recognize. Setting aside the current spacetime, even before crossing over, Ma Jia had rarely seen such neat handwritten articles.

It was obvious that this had been meticulously written and then recopied.

"You really put some heart into this," Ma Jia said. "It must have taken a lot of effort."

"Reporting face-to-face to Executive Ma for the first time, I dared not be careless." Facing Ma Jia's praise, Lu Xuan still maintained a restrained politeness—perhaps even somewhat sycophantic.

"Hahaha," Ma Jia laughed. "You're too polite. We're all comrades here—let's not stand on such ceremony."

Ten minutes later, Ma Jia had roughly read through the report of over ten pages. The content didn't contain anything that surprised him.

This was a very standard research report. It was divided into several parts: the current status of departmental functions and responsibilities, existing problems, reasons for those problems, and suggestions for rectification. The examples cited covered all administrative departments currently established by the Senate except for military organs, and were objective and comprehensive. The problems pointed out were based on facts—truthful and fair. In the section on causes, a large amount of space was devoted to discussing how such problems are ubiquitous in all nascent regimes and represent an inevitability on any regime's path to maturity.

In Ma Jia's view, this report wasn't particularly professional, let alone stunning. Not only was the data lacking significantly, but there were also many errors in the application of legal principles. However, Lu Xuan's line of thinking was completely correct: the Senate's administrative institutions were chaotic, with unclear authority, and urgently needed adjustment.
