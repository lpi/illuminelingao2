# Chapter 1649 - Walnut Cookies Exclusively for the Great World

Zhang Yu didn't know if this news counted as joy or worry, staring blankly in a daze. Hong Huangnan's heart moved, suddenly remembering something, asked: "Are your family's walnut cookies delicious?"

Chen Shixin interjected: "Chief, although their shop is small, it is an authentic century-old shop. Walnut cookies are known as unique in Panyu... How many tea houses use goods from their shop."

"Unique in Panyu" was of course boasting, but Chen Shixin smelled the scent of benefit for Zhang Yu's family from the Chief's question, so he hurried to introduce.

Zhang Yu also nodded along: "My family's walnut cookies, everyone who has eaten them says they are good." When saying this, he blushed a little. Because of mixing in stale walnuts, some old customers already had complaints.

Hong Huangnan nodded: "Like this, Shixin, buy a few pieces for me to taste tomorrow."

Zhang Yu hurriedly said: "I have them on me right now. If Chief doesn't disdain, please taste and see." Saying this, he took out a grease-spotted paper package from his sleeve—this was what his mother gave him as a snack in the morning.

Hong Huangnan opened the paper package. The walnut cookies had already broken into several pieces. A layer of fine crumbs accumulated under the greaseproof paper. The shortening was done well. As an author who frequently wrote articles for food columns in magazines and newspapers in Guangzhou City, he had a natural keen perception for food.

He picked up a piece, sniffed at his nose tip first, asked: "This was baked yesterday, right."

Zhang Yu hurriedly said: "Yes. Leftover from yesterday's sales, this lowly one brought on body to eat as a snack."

Hong Huangnan placed the walnut cookie on the tip of his tongue, closed his eyes and chewed slowly. His first mumbled sentence was: "Too sweet."

Sweet, extremely sweet. Chinese traditional pastries often were heavy in oil and sugar, but the sweetness of the 21st century was still much lighter compared to the 17th century—the sweetness of this walnut cookie was comparable to Middle Eastern pastries.

"The lard used for shortening is not stale." Hong Huangnan frowned slightly, "It's fresh lard, right."

"This, this lowly one doesn't know..."

Lard used for shortening in making traditional pastries stressed being aged. It was said the older the better. Shortening pastries made this way were not only fragrant and crisp but also durable for storage. Could be kept for half a year without spoiling.

Suddenly Hong Huangnan's eyes opened: "Walnuts are stale!" He continued chewing a few times, "Half new half old, using new walnuts' fragrance to cover up. Brains moved quite well. Pity inner skins weren't picked clean, leaving some slight bitterness. Furthermore, walnuts have much oil. Old goods from last year will change taste. Even if bitter skins are all picked clean, this faint rancid taste cannot be removed."

Zhang Yu's face instantly turned bright red. Saying yes wasn't right, saying no wasn't right either. These walnuts counted as his family shop's biggest secret. To cover up the taste of stale walnuts, his father and mother racked their brains. But still couldn't hide from some old diners skilled in tasting.

"Truly this lowly one's family has small capital and small profit. Walnut prices are too high nowadays, business on the market is hard to do..." He defended reluctantly. Actually, a part of his family's goods used good ingredients, that was orders from big households. Although patrons were picky, the price was high and quantity small, so stuff was absolutely not sloppy.

Hong Huangnan didn't care about his defense. Although the youth before his eyes and his family's small walnut cookie shop were not worth mentioning, he became interested in this. The Senate often mentioned wanting to "transform society," and he was also very interested in displaying might in commerce—now a natural test subject cum white glove delivered itself to the door.

He swallowed the walnut cookie, picked up tea to rinse his mouth. Spoke slowly: "Stuff is made passably. Has true skill."

"Yes, yes, many thanks for Chief's praise." Zhang Yu didn't know why, feeling particularly nervous.

"Your family only knows how to make this?"

"Yes, oh, no," Zhang Yu stammered, "General tea foods, small shop can all make. Only walnut cookies have the best reputation, everyone also recognizes this to buy..."

"How about this, go tell your father and mother. We also want to open a tea food shop in the Great World. The walnut cookies in the shop will be supplied by your family. If sales are good, can make other varieties in the future," Hong Huangnan said slowly, "Stuff, doesn't need to be too good. Just about today's level is enough. Have to control the price..."

Zhang Yu's mouth opened wide, unable to react for a moment. Still Chen Shixin was clever, hurriedly pushed him once: "Still not thanking Chief!"

Only heard a *putong* sound, Zhang Yu had already fallen to his knees, *dong dong dong* kowtowed three loud heads to Hong Huangnan in succession. Inside and outside Guangzhou, who didn't know as long as one hooked up with Australians' busines, it meant rapid advancement. At the very least, whole family would have no worry about food and clothing. His family's walnut cookies counted as prospering this time! Truly ancestors had spirits!

He was so excited words couldn't come out. With great difficulty held out a sentence: "Many thanks for Chief's grace! Small small small... this life and this world have no way to repay, next life surely will tie grass and hold ring..."

At this moment he was full of gratitude towards this Chief Hong, not knowing what words to use to express it properly. For a moment actually thought even if Chief Hong wanted him to wear women's clothes to serve him, he was willing...

"Don't mention things of next life. You just do it well." Hong Huangnan waved his hand, instructing the Fake Hair-bandit standing by the side all along, "You care about this matter. Remind me tonight to issue a letter to Old Zhang, implement the matter."

"Yes, Chief."

"You go."

Zhang Yu kowtowed another head, then followed the Fake Hair-bandit out dizzily. When he came back to his senses, he had already arrived at the business recruitment place outside.

After filling out a special supplier information form, the Fake Hair-bandit gave him a "Supply Agreement," telling him to take it back for the shop owner to sign and bring back, then could "wait for order notification."

Coming out of the main gate, saw Wu Ming and Huang Binkun waiting anxiously. Seeing them come out, Wu Ming hurriedly greeted them, asking repeatedly: "How was it?"

Zhang Yu was still somewhat dizzy, face pale, hands and feet ice cold, unable to say a word. Wu Ming was just wondering, but Chen Shixin laughed: "Worthy Brother Zhang had great fortune this time!"

Immediately told the matter of them meeting Hong Huangnan: "Now Worthy Brother Zhang's family hooked up with Australians' business, prosperity is just around the corner."

Wu Ming also said repeatedly: "Little Zhang got lucky this time" and similar words. Huang Binkun smiled bitterly in secret: *Truly nothing works better than silver and copper coins. Yesterday still viewed Hair-bandits as tigers, at this moment simply closer than own father.*

"Go, let's hurry back, let your father and mother also be happy." Chen Shixin was simply happier than for his own affairs, "This is not comparable to shops recruited in. Your family is personally selected by Chief, this status is not ordinary! Tomorrow ask Chief Hong to say a word, also deliver goods to Purple Treasure Studio to sell..."

"Purple Treasure Studio sells all Australian pastries, what use is your walnut cookie?" Wu Ming laughed, "Human heart is insufficient like a snake swallowing an elephant. I think Worthy Brother Zhang better do the Great World's business well first. Great future ahead."

Zhang Yu nodded repeatedly. He seemed to have never been this happy in his life till now, full of longing. The life path originally felt boring and even somewhat dim suddenly became radiant. Even the picture of himself passing the *xiucai* exam one day originally thought of secretly many times felt somewhat colorless.

Zhang Yu returned home with such dizzy feelings—didn't even know how he came back, vaguely remembering Chen Shixin and others sent him back.

Arriving home, Mother saw his face was scary white, jumped in fright, thinking he got some palpitation disease. But was congratulated by Chen Shixin and Wu Ming, praising him as "capable," having "noble person assisting."

"Auntie, you are blessed. This time your family really is going to have a turn of fortune." Wu Ming said smilingly, "Unexpectedly Worthy Brother Zhang actually has such ability."

After puzzling for half a day, knowing today actually hooked up a line with Australians, now the Zhang couple beamed with joy. Australians were famous for turning stone into gold. Doing business with them, let alone whether getting rich, anyway absolutely couldn't suffer loss. Moreover, once the signboard of "Great World Walnut Cookie Exclusive Supply" was hung out, the light they could share was not just a tiny bit.

The Zhang couple were originally racking their brains for the small shop's operation, just barely maintaining the situation. Now hearing there was such a turning point, how could they not be happy? Especially seeing that "Receipt" Zhang Yu brought back, knowing this matter was absolutely true, immediately even hands were trembling. Except saying good repeatedly, couldn't say other words anymore.

Immediately took out many tea foods to entertain everyone. Huang Binkun originally thought it was just walnut cookies, didn't expect varieties were quite a few—all ordered piecemeal by big households.

Wu Ming joked: "Old Daddy Zhang! I think this Chief Hong probably thinks highly of your son."

Zhang Yu's father said with trembling hands: "If really so, it is also his fortune. Being able to serve Australians, counts as him having blessings..."

Huang Binkun secretly cursed this was simply shameless!

Chen Shixin hurriedly said no such thing. Chief Hong had no such hobby, solely because he ate walnut cookies and felt they were good that he was willing to give them this opportunity.

"...Such things shouldn't be thought about much, better curry favor on goods properly." Chen Shixin said. Zhang Yu got this lucky prize, he was also secretly happy. At any rate this was his credit for pulling strings. Chief Hong giving him this good business probably also had the aspect of looking at his face. Thinking of this, he felt somewhat floating.

"This time is also thanks to Shixin's help." Wu Ming patted his shoulder, "Thanks to him knowing Australians and being able to speak up, otherwise where would be such opportunity!"

The Zhang couple couldn't help thanking a thousand times. Even Huang Binkun who did nothing at all received many grateful words. Especially after Wu Ming said this Young Master Huang came from Lingao and was a Master of Banditology, the Zhang couple showed even more reverent eyes, involuntarily ingratiating themselves to him desperately, asking him to speak more good words in front of "Australian Chiefs."

Huang Binkun didn't know whether to laugh or cry. How come after arriving in Guangzhou everyone treated him as Australians' incarnation? But at this moment it wasn't convenient to spoil their fun, so he responded vaguely.
