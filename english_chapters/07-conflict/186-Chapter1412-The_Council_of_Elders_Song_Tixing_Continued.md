# Chapter 1412 - The Council of Elders' Song Tixing (Continued)

By the time she woke, it was already past noon. Su Wan's stomach rumbled, and she was delighted to discover that her long-lost appetite had returned.

"I'm going to have a big meal!" Su Wan stretched lazily, threw off the covers, and sat up, standing stark naked with bare feet on the floor.

From lying flat to standing upright, gravity caused her already-full bladder to feel a surge of pressure. Su Wan ignored the wooden-and-leather T-strap sandals placed in the compartment of her bedside table and strode barefoot toward the small door on one side of the room.

Relaxing her sphincter on the flush toilet and enjoying the pleasure of relieving herself, Su Wan couldn't help letting out a satisfied moan. After initially addressing the physiological pressure, she sat on the toilet and surveyed the bathroom. Whether in terms of décor or sanitary fixtures, it was no worse than the apartment she had purchased in Lingao. Moreover, it had been arranged with great care: the louvered window, protected by wire mesh, was open, letting in the cool breeze of nature; a potted green plant sat in the corner.

"So corrupt! Corrupt!" Su Wan declared indignantly, sitting naked on the toilet.

After showering in the bathroom and wringing out her wet hair with a towel as she returned to the bedroom, the polished natural-wood floor felt very comfortable beneath her feet. She looked at the clothes strewn all over the floor and only then remembered that she had not yet opened her luggage.

The naturalized-civilian cadre from the Hospitality Office had said the luggage would be left at her door. Without a care, Su Wan pulled open the bedroom door—and a cry of alarm sounded outside. A female naturalized civilian in a police uniform with blue collar tabs jumped up from the bench in the corridor, clapping her hand over her mouth in shock.

"What are you yelling about? I'm not a tiger! Attention!" Su Wan commanded, one hand on her hip, striking a T-stance, chest thrust out, while timely covering the "fried eggs" on her chest.

"Re... re... port..." The other woman was scared out of her wits by this tall, large, and naked "Chief." But she had been trained to have a conditioned reflex to commands; almost instantly she stood at attention with a salute. "Reporting to Comrade Regional Commander! Kaohsiung Police Bureau... Political Security Section, Political Security Trainee Associate Commissioner Yao Yulan, reporting for duty!"

"At ease. Bring my trunk inside."

"Yes, yes." Yao Yulan, still shaken, did not dare to look at the female Chief's dazzlingly white body. Head bowed, she carried the two cases from the corridor into the room.

"Get out! I'm changing my clothes!" Su Wan ordered harshly.

Yao Yulan scurried out. Only then did Su Wan slowly open the trunk and get dressed.

Inside the trunk was a National Police summer uniform—the so-called summer uniform was nothing more than a cotton-linen blend short-sleeved open-collar blazer shirt, paired with a loose cotton skirt. She methodically fastened her cross-body leather utility belt: genuine cowhide, with a brass buckle, creaking as she walked. Hanging a command saber from it would be very impressive; the only drawback was that in humid weather it would give off a smell. But for Su Wan, this was hardly a drawback.

However, Su Wan felt that this cotton uniform really lacked violent aesthetics: first, it wasn't very crisp; second, almost all uniform decorations had been omitted. If not for the shoulder boards, collar tabs, and utility belt, one could hardly tell it was a uniform. Nor did she have impressive riding boots to wear—of course, in Lingao most of the time, wearing riding boots was a form of self-abuse.

"This cap—the hobby of bumpkins." Su Wan sighed as she picked up the women's service cap—a black, brimless, disk-shaped soft cap with white piping. The enamel cap badge, custom-ordered by the General Affairs Office from Zizhen Studio, at least gleamed brightly. "Even if we can't make peaked caps at this stage, at least make garrison caps or something..." she muttered as she put on the cap.

In the Council of Elders' apparatus of state violence, police and Political Security Bureau personnel wore the same style of black uniform. This was not for looking cool or deliberately imitating anyone, but was dictated by the need to simplify supply and the low level of the textile industry's dyeing capabilities. The distinction was that police wore lapel pins while Political Security Bureau personnel wore blue collar tabs.

Finally, she took out a holster from the trunk and hung it at her waist. The finely crafted leather holster was stuffed with toilet paper—Su Wan found it too heavy to keep a pistol hanging at her waist all the time, and besides, her daily work had no need for a pistol. She had simply settled for bringing just the holster.

"Wouldn't it be nice to have a saber instead of this junk!" Su Wan patted the holster with some regret.

Her self-designed image was: black turndown-collar police uniform, garrison cap, utility belt, riding boots, a black-sheathed saber hanging at her waist, and a long-handled riding crop in hand—readily calling to mind those cruel female Nazi concentration camp guards or the female special agents of Dregs Cave in movies and TV dramas.

When she emerged from the door properly dressed, Yao Yulan gave her another look and then saluted: "Reporting to Comrade Regional Commander, I have been ordered to take you to the Kaohsiung Infirmary. Several Chiefs are waiting for you there."

"How do you intend to get me there?" Su Wan gave a mirthless snort—she had truly had enough of the damned carriage. If she rode one more time, she would probably vomit up everything from her cardia to above her appendix.

"Horses have been prepared outside. If you wish to leave, we can go now."

Although she had been transmigrated for quite some time, Su Wan had never learned to ride—this made her something of an oddity among the Elders, especially among Elders who worked in the organs of state violence. She preferred riding in cars and airplanes—unfortunately, one of these forms of transportation simply did not exist, and the other basically never operated.

"Never mind. I don't know how to ride. Let's walk. I can take a look at the situation in Kaohsiung along the way." Su Wan tugged at her utility belt, completely unconcerned that her bare feet in rattan sandals clashed badly with her uniform.

Seeing this tall Chief with waist-length hair, barefoot in sandals, choosing to walk like an ordinary soldier rather than ride a horse, Yao Yulan was somewhat surprised. Horses were not exactly abundant in Kaohsiung, but even naturalized-civilian cadres of slightly higher rank could call for a horse when going out.

Before Yao Yulan could figure out the reason, Su Wan had already strode out the door: "What are you standing there for? Let's go." Yao Yulan did not dare delay and hurried to keep up.

Although it was the Little Ice Age, Su Wan did not feel any hint of "ice age" at all. Kaohsiung's summer was no less oppressive than Lingao's. The scorching sun still baked the ground until it was hot to the touch, and mixed with the salty, fishy smell brought by the sea breeze, she felt another wave of dizziness. But thanks to the textile technology of the old time-space, her clothes did not cause her to collapse from being both non-breathable and stiff.

Kaohsiung City's construction had progressed even further since Dr. Zhong's visit, especially the Army and Navy's Fengshan Fortress and Qijin Base, which were now taking initial shape. Barracks and training grounds had been expanded. A dry dock capable of maintaining and repairing large vessels was under intensive construction. Besides the troops permanently stationed here, there were Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and security forces from as far away as Hainan, Jeju Island, and Shandong, sent to participate in "rotation training." Soldiers in various uniforms, fully armed, hurried along the roads. Sabers flashed. Gunfire, shouts, drums and bugles, cannon fire, and military songs blended together, playing a symphony of war from the steam age.

The main roads of Kaohsiung city had all been paved. Su Wan walked along, enjoying this "symphony" while asking Yao Yulan about Kaohsiung. She was tall with a long stride, and Yao Yulan had to almost jog to keep up.

After walking for more than twenty minutes along Council of Elders Avenue, Yao Yulan led her to a prefabricated wooden-frame building hidden by trees, about a dozen meters off the main road.

"This is it?"

"Reporting, Chief. This is the Kaohsiung Infirmary. Several Chiefs are waiting for you here."

Su Wan noticed that the infirmary was quite substantial. Moreover, the foundation, raised a meter above ground, was built of stone blocks, with a row of dark arched ventilation openings—there must be quite a large basement below.

Yao Yulan did not take her through the main entrance but led her in through a side door. Passing through a corridor, they came to the entrance to the basement. Yao Yulan showed her credentials to the two police officers at the door; one officer opened the door leading to the basement. The two descended via a ramp.

At the end of the passage, opening a door revealed a large vaulted brick cellar. Electric lights were on inside. It was quite cold, mingled with a pungent smell of disinfectant. Su Wan's nose twitched: what a familiar smell!

In the center of the cellar was an autopsy table covered with tiles. Along the walls, the shelves and cabinets for storing sundries held glass jars of various sizes containing specimens.

Two men sat at a table. One of them she recognized—Lei En from the Ministry of Health, originally in epidemic prevention. Su Wan had seen him a few times at joint meetings with the Ministry of Health. But she had not seen him in Lingao for quite some time—Su Wan had never paid much attention to personnel transfers; so he had come to Kaohsiung!

The other she did not recognize: a young man of about twenty-five or twenty-six, who, like most male Elders, wore his hair cropped extremely short. At a glance, he looked like a background extra. His face wore the expressionless look typical of Elders. From his uniform and blue collar tabs, she could tell he was a Political Security Bureau Elder.

"Ah, Forensic Examiner Su is here." Lei En saw her enter and rose to greet her.

"Dr. Lei, so you've been transferred here." Su Wan also greeted him politely.

"I've been here quite a while. Let me introduce you. This is Comrade Chen Baibin of the Political Security Bureau," Lei En said. "And this is Su Wan, forensic examiner."

"How do you do. Pleased to meet you." The young man named Chen Baibin extended his hand. Su Wan nodded at the young man with a smile but did not shake hands; she merely said: "What's the important matter that required summoning me specially to Kaohsiung?"

Chen Baibin seemed not good with words. Lei En hastened to say: "This is a task assigned by the Political Security General Administration. There is a special corpse that requires your professional expertise to examine."
