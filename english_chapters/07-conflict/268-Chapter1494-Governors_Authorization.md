# Chapter 1494 - Governor's Authorization

Governor Juan Salamanca didn't expect such an answer. He couldn't help being startled, like a soldier feeling a heavy blow on his armor. At least one point in Weiss's words was fact: vultures and crows large and small were now flying around Sanabria's millions in family wealth. Almost every imperial subject from Macau to Manila was busy suing him; no matter how absurd and laughable the charges seemed, they were grandly written into dossiers presented before the Royal Prosecutor. Everyone wanted to tear a piece of meat from the corpse of the former colony's number one wealthy merchant, dripping with fat; the Governor was no exception.

"Accusations against Sanabria must undergo trial by the Royal Court to determine guilt." Seeing the purpose of beating down the opponent mostly failing, the Governor wanted to gloss over this topic as quickly as possible.

"He is guilty, and he has already been convicted. You have already exercised the power of justice on behalf of His Majesty the King, confiscating his ill-gotten gains."

"From where did you hear such nonsense? The government is merely detaining the suspect's property awaiting court trial."

"Who would send temporarily detained property, such as Sanabria's merchant ships and yachts, into the Royal Dockyard for repair, just so victims can receive brand-new compensation? This is what I witnessed with my own eyes." Weiss answered: "Your Excellency, you only lack a perfect trial in absentia now; dead men won't argue."

"Merely temporary requisition; the colony has a very urgent need for ships capable of combat." The Governor finally decided to abandon this topic. He pulled the bell rope to summon a servant, "Go get something to drink. No, not wine, bring Australian water."

A Governor's Palace servant in white uniform brought in a wooden tray holding two glass bottles sealed with wire and corks, and two silver cups. The glass bottles were covered with water droplets large and small, probably just taken from well water.

"You don't mind this little luxury, right? I personally don't approve of drinking alcohol during business time." The Governor's tone became kind and gentle, "In such a hot place, such cool enjoyment is so rare. Perhaps in your view, it counts for nothing."

Weiss smiled noncommittally. He indeed disdained "luxury Australian water"—that was just salt soda water common in Lingao, stuff even slightly better-off naturalized workers could buy to relieve summer heat and thirst during breaks. "Stupid miser, ignorant Spanish pig," he criticized inwardly.

"Even this little enjoyment must be controlled because we have compelling difficulties. Colonial finances have always been scarce, yet currently, we have to increase expenditure on military engineering. We cannot indulge in pleasure," the Governor tried to switch to a topic to counterattack: "So some of your behaviors here are untimely. Now Manila's rich take imitating you as a trend, from fashionable clothes to ornate carriages. Those are fine, but your way of decorating washrooms is too inappropriate, using expensive porcelain as chamber pots, even building special water pumps to flush filth. If noblemen of the entire colony emulate this, how much money will the colony lose? Simply unimaginable."

"Not just money; now even filth flushed away by your water pump is valuable. We have to collect it to make saltpeter like Englishmen treat pigeon dung. True, Sanabria is guilty, but we can't find an agent to replace him who can purchase Indian saltpeter for the government at fair prices. Now we either figure out a way to solve the problem ourselves or endure high-price exploitation by Indians. Perhaps you have a way to help His Majesty's colonial government escape the predicament. We are all obligated to serve God and His Majesty; isn't this what you said to Mr. Osvaldo?"

"Of course I can," Weiss narrowed his eyes; the smile hanging on his face finally turned into mockery, "I'm afraid even more than you imagine."

"I don't understand your meaning." The Governor said in astonishment.

"Please think, why does a coarse porcelain bowl used by a Chinese village farmer squatting in mud to drink tea get sent to the King's table after crossing oceans to Europe? In Madrid, no clothing material more expensive than Chinese silk can be found. Yet I have seen those Australians entrenched on the Chinese coast use silk of the same texture to wrap gunpowder for cannon charges. Every shot they fire can make a merchant from Acapulco or Seville ache to death. Demand brings value, and distance multiplies value. By the same logic, price of Bilbao iron and Mexican copper transported to the Philippines rivals gold and silver. Indeed, compared to that, the distance to transport iron and mercury from China and saltpeter from India is much shorter, but as you witnessed, these pagans have no conscience, exploiting honest and kind Christians to a heinous degree."

"In fact, this colony you govern relies too heavily on trade with Chinese. To date, the Philippines has no industry sufficient for self-sufficiency, merely playing a negligible role as a transporter in the long journey of Chinese goods to the Americas and the Imperial homeland. Undoubtedly, this is beneficial neither to your achievements nor to increasing the well-being of colonial people. You intend to force people to scrimp and save, saving every peso to strengthen defense works. If it causes them to voice complaints everywhere, thinking the colony cannot bring them happiness and peace, what meaning can adding cannons and warships have? Enemies don't always come from outside."

"You speak very correctly," the Governor nodded in acknowledgment; Weiss pointed out a potentially existing danger. Every Philippine Governor had to undergo a special court investigation presided over by his successor when leaving office; offending too many people wasn't a good thing. "But is there any other way? Now even transporting subsidies from the Americas has become a dangerous task."

"To maintain a colony and make it flourish, the best way is to establish self-sufficient industries. Haven't you already done so? You permitted Chinese to leave the Parian to engage in agriculture and horticulture, and open factories outside Manila." Seeing the Governor wanted to say something, Weiss raised his hand to stop him, "Good factories are geese that lay golden eggs. This is the Australians' magic weapon for getting rich; they open factories, assembling Chinese porcelain and water pumps into chamber pots; Chinese are willing to pay over ten times the price to buy. Of course, building factories and manufacturing machines require large amounts of metal, but did God bestow the Philippines to His Majesty as a barren desert? You already found gold in Baguio, discovered mercury in Palawan; could it be that this fertile land doesn't contain copper, iron, lead, tin, or all materials we need? For instance, the saltpeter you repeatedly mentioned."

"You have confidence in this?"

"The source of my wealth isn't a secret; excavating gold mines in Kelantan, discovering diamond mines on islands near China. Among my subordinates are some Chinese who are the best miner technicians. Their families made a living by mining for generations; no one is better at finding mines and excavating shafts than them. Their technology in using special machines to prevent mine shafts from being flooded is unique. As long as you approve, I will immediately order them to start work."

Juan Salamanca tapped his armchair armrest lightly with fingers. Weiss saw his rhetoric had taken effect, so he stopped to moisten his throat with salt soda water, waiting quietly for the other party to speak.

"Mr. Vananois, your proposal is undoubtedly very precious," the Governor pondered for a moment, "I just want to point out some situations to you. You haven't lived in the Philippines long; you may not know inland mountain areas of this colony are still untraversed by humans, places where untamed savages run rampant. Although the Philippine archipelago all belongs to His Majesty's colony, south of the Visayas, fierce Malay pirates and Moro pagans who kill without blinking are scattered everywhere. The army must first defend Manila and other important cities; the government cannot withdraw already stretched troops to provide protection for your mining engineers."

"This isn't a problem. I engage in profitable commerce, and am also a soldier. I have some Christian soldiers, few in number but elite and loyal enough to protect the mining enterprise. You also don't need to provide ships, because I can let my *Esmeralda* transport mining personnel and machines. What I request is, firstly, my men must enjoy freedom of legal movement throughout the colony when surveying terrain and searching for veins, whether coastal or inland. They are working for the well-being of the colony and shouldn't receive rude treatment like that from Mr. Brambilla. My personnel have the right to hold necessary weapons to resist attacks by savages and pagans; this saves the government the necessity of using force. Finally, under mining engineering needs, if the government can approve me hiring coolies locally or directly capturing those savages and pagans as slaves, that would be best."

"Very well, do you have any other requests?"

"Regarding proceeds of private investment in mining, and legal clauses—"

"According to laws current in New Spain and Peru Viceroyships, private mine owners should pay the Fifth tax to His Majesty's government." The Governor picked up a few thin volumes to flip through for a while, "However, the Philippine colony currently has no precedent for private investment in mining. If you indeed excavate minerals needed by the government, as a reward, I have the power to exempt your mining tax. As long as you agree to sell all excavated ore to the colonial government."

"At a price acceptable to both of us," Weiss said. "Oral pricing or written contract are both fine; I accept both."

"You truly helped us greatly. I will immediately instruct the secretary to write official documents; you will get the pass very soon."

The two exchanged a few more pleasantries. When Weiss rose to bid farewell, he heard the Governor say: "Thank you very much for your gift, Count."

"Your Excellency, now you are clear. What I can provide is much more than you imagine."
