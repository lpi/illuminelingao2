# Chapter 1438 - Arson

The victims were quickly stripped naked. The two perpetrators deftly handled the uniforms and weapons, then carried the bodies into the dry dock, dragging them all the way to the side of the submerged vessel *Nautilus*. The refurbishment of the submersible had just begun, and the area was piled high with ship timber, planks, and copper and iron parts. Wooden barrels full of tar and pitch were lined up on the stone steps inside the dock wall. One Chinese man climbed onto the deck, opened the hatch cover, and drilled inside, his agility enough to amaze Captain Fernando. After a quick inspection, including turning the crank two revolutions to observe how the propeller worked and noting various key points, he opened every hatch and opening on the hull that could be opened. His partner immediately handed up prepared wooden buckets, pouring the pungent wood tar into the cabin. The two were busy for a while, piling all sorts of flammable planks and felt, along with abaca twine used for caulking, under the submersible. They carefully left air channels when piling the fuel. Whole barrels of pitch and tar were poured down from the deck, flowing over the hull and soaking the piled-up flammable materials. Finally, the two saboteurs found a stack of strange black strips among the sundries, emitting a foul smell. They didn't know these were deerskins soaked in wood tar, intended for waterproof sealing on the hatches, but they took the stuff anyway to wrap the soldiers' corpses and threw them into the pyre specially prepared for the *Nautilus*.

One saboteur climbed back into the cabin. He opened a paper bag, revealing two small tin tubes. In the moonlight, one could see that one was painted white, the other red; they were of the same thickness but the red one was longer, with threads cut at the end like a fountain pen, and the other end sealed with a celluloid waterproof cap. He took out several copper alloy disks from the paper bag, observed them for a moment, picked one of suitable thickness, and carefully placed it flat inside the iron tube to install it properly. Finally, he screwed the two tin tubes tightly together. A pair of special small pliers clamped down hard on a certain spot on the white tube. As the tin dented, the sound of a glass ampoule breaking and liquid flowing came from inside. This iron tube was left in the tar-filled cabin. His companion did the same, placing another iron tube in the firewood pile under the *Nautilus*. In the wood piles and ship material yard where they had worked, they also left several similarly treated iron tubes. After completing all the work methodically, the two saboteurs took off their tar-stained trousers and cloth shoes and threw them into the dry dock, completely removing their disguises. They jumped into the sea and swam eastward, bypassing the headland, where a small boat was anchored by a desolate rocky beach, waiting to pick them up.

Unnoticed chemical reactions continued inside the tin tubes. The slight hissing sound of the copper alloy disks being corroded by acid was completely covered by the noise of the tide hitting the shore. After nearly four hours, the copper disk was finally eaten through. Concentrated sulfuric acid seeped into the red half of the iron tube, where the mixture of sugar and potassium chlorate erupted into a violent spontaneous combustion reaction. flames instantly burned through the celluloid cap, spraying onto the wood planks already soaked in tar. Within minutes, the *Nautilus* became a gigantic torch. Sparks burst everywhere, fierce tongues of fire curled upward, and soon the wooden shed over the dry dock also caught fire. The entire shipyard was shrouded in a trembling red glow, with black shadows darting across the ground. The workers, awakened by the fire, either sat on the ground howling hoarsely or ran around wildly, gasping desperately, shaking so much they couldn't say a word.

Geronimo Paño was scared pale. As if to celebrate his hurried arrival, with a boom, the roof of the dry dock collapsed into the fire. Red flames soared, the tips rising fully two pesos high. He shouted for his subordinates to fight the fire, but no one paid any attention to his orders. Everyone just ran around, pushing each other, falling, in total chaos.

The chaotic situation was only brought under control after an officer from Fort San Felipe arrived at the shipyard with a squad of soldiers. Geronimo divided his manpower into two groups: one went to save the burning lumber yard; the other went straight to the dry dock where the submersible was. A strange scene presented itself there: although the inside of the dry dock had burned into a huge brazier, there was accumulated seawater in a low-lying passage at the head of the dock. The flames could not cross over, and the water gate at the dock head was not reached by the fire and remained intact. But when Geronimo ordered the gate opened to let in seawater to extinguish the fire, it was discovered that the ingenious machine Paulo Takayama had built to open the heavy gate seemed to have been deliberately sabotaged. No matter how they pulled and cranked, the gate remained immovable. They hurriedly found several water pumps, carried them over, only to find the hoses had been cut beforehand. And so, by the time the fire was extinguished, the only remaining parts of the "Demon Ship of Manila," the *Nautilus*, were a deformed propeller and a few twisted, charred copper skeletal frames.

Several charred human bones were cleared from the ash heap in the dock, and a Chinese cloth shoe was found in the accumulated water at the dock head. Undoubtedly, these things were the last remains of the two poor Chinese craftsmen in the human world. As for the two missing Pampangan soldiers, it was initially thought they had deserted. A few days later, their spears and matchlocks were fished out of the sea near the dock, along with a bundled uniform, the bloodstains on it having already changed color. Although the bodies were never found, it could be concluded that they had been murdered by the arsonists. Geronimo Paño was summoned by the Manila Audiencia. Although the interrogation ultimately concluded he was not responsible and he was released, his spirit had collapsed since the blow. Apart from muttering prayers to the Virgin Mary to himself, he could no longer speak any other words.

The vacant position of shipyard director was sold according to custom. The Governor set a price of one thousand pesos. After several lively rounds of competition, Mr. Geronimo Paño's nephew, who was also his assistant at the shipyard, Carucio Paño, bought the position for one thousand five hundred pesos. Everyone rumored that Carucio Paño was only able to come up with such a large sum with Takayama's financial assistance. Carucio was a close friend of Takayama and frequented his estate and factory.

Attention to the new head of the shipyard didn't last long because a new homicide captured people's interest. on the night of the second day after the shipyard fire, Captain Fernando, the most fanatical cockfighting gambler among the whites in Manila who had recently been very flush with cash, was assassinated in the Parian district. The night watchmen reported: they found the captain lying in a gutter by the roadside, the smell of alcohol on him even overpowering the smell of blood. What took the captain's life was a strangely shaped kris dagger inserted in his chest—a weapon loved by Malays. It was obvious that the drunken captain had fought with the killer; his right hand was clenched into a fist, tightly gripping a small piece of cloth torn from the enemy's clothes: a fragment of Dutch linen.

The search of the captain's residence was disappointing. This drunkard and gambler captain had nothing left in his inn room, not even a small coin. The priests all said this was a sin created by gambling.

Rumors that Dutch scoundrels had hired Malay assassins to infiltrate Manila for sabotage caused a sensation throughout the city for a time. But apart from the Governor and a few others who were worried about it, these rumors merely added some excitement to the overly leisurely and lazy lives of most Spaniards. For most self-proclaimed Iberian nobles in the Oriental archipelago, how could such trivial matters as a ship burning in the shipyard or a murdered gambler lying in a gutter in front of a tavern compare to tonight's banquet and ball?

However, work at the shipyard did not stop because of this sabotage. Since the *Nautilus* was destroyed, it actually allowed the shipyard to concentrate manpower and resources on the construction of the patrol boats. Lando noticed that the Spaniards showed unprecedented high efficiency. The newly appointed director supervised the workers personally and transferred many native soldiers to "urge" the Tagalog coolies to work. Within a week after the dry dock burned down, the coolies drained the water from the dock, repaired the gate, cleared all the debris, and then brought in new ship timber. According to reports from Jimide and others, the shipyard did not seem to restart the construction of the submarine, putting all energy into those patrol sloops.

Even someone like Lando, who knew nothing about shipbuilding or sailing ships, could see that these sailing ships gradually taking shape were very similar to the twin-masted patrol sloops mass-equipped by the Lingao Navy. Even the reserved gun positions were exactly the same as the original. Lando quickly realized that the patrol sloop seized from the Navy back then was not in Zheng Zhilong's hands; nine out of ten it had been taken by Hale and brought to Manila.

What use is it for him to build submarines and these patrol boats? Pointless. Lando thought. Although this could indeed strengthen Spanish rule in the Philippines, against the Council of Elders, it was just a mantis trying to stop a chariot.

While he was considering how to write his new report, there was a rhythmic knock on the study door. It was Mimi.

"Come in!"

"Chief, Jimide just came back from the dock; he has a situation to report." Mimi reported in a whisper.

"Call him in."

Jimide reported that seven or eight foreign devils had disembarked from a ship, carrying a lot of luggage.

Foreigners coming to Manila was not rare, but it was very special for the Governor's servants to go specifically to welcome them.

"What color hair? And eyes?"

"Black, yellow, and red! Didn't notice the eyes; there were blue and green, seemed to be black too..." the lad said.

"What did these people look like they do?"

"They didn't look like rich people, but they looked quite sturdy, not poor people either." Jimide gestured, "I took a look; some had very thick fingers and wrists, looked like craftsmen!"

"Craftsmen? Then they must be artisans." Lando thought. It was not surprising for European artisans to come to Manila; the issue was that the Governor's Palace sent people to welcome them, indicating they attached great importance to these artisans.
