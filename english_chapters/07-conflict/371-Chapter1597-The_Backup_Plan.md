# Chapter 1597 - The Backup Plan

Zhuo Yifan mingled with the crowd and walked on foot, heading toward the riverside gymnasium. He was wearing old clothes procured by Sima Qiudao, with a fake mustache glued on, dressed like a down-and-out scholar. He didn't carry any long weapons in his hand, only hiding darts in his sleeves and a short dagger at his waist. Three male disciples also dressed as peddlers and porters followed him from a distance, their bodies stuffed with various hidden weapons.

When Zhou Zhongjun was exposed, he was less than twenty *zhang* away from her. When the police moved to arrest them, he had already turned and walked out of the square.

The plan to act in the square had failed! So even though the disciple responsible for signaling desperately fired the "Rising Promotion Cannon," he did not make a move, but quickly followed the flow of people out of the square.

He knew from the beginning that the chances of successfully attacking the Hair Thieves near the gymnasium were not great. However, the Hair Thieves' internal and external defenses were extremely tight, and there were very few opportunities available, so he had to take a risk.

However, he and Sima Qiudao had estimated the chances of this move again and again, and picked only fifty-fifty odds. Even if Zhou Zhongjun and the others could use the Hair Thieves' clothing to bluff for a while and get close to the True Kuns to act, relying on the martial arts of those few female warriors, they might not be able to succeed in one blow.

Therefore, based on the intelligence passed on by Seventh Master, he prepared a second strategy.

Seventh Master provided the route of the Hair Thieves' "Musicians," and hinted that there would be several True Kun leaders among them. The intelligence was detailed, including not only the specific route, but also the size of the convoy, roughly how many guards there would be, and how many "Fake Kun Musicians" there were on the public carriages.

Compared to the square, the guard force on the movement route would not be very large, and the chances of a successful surprise attack by their side were high.

Once the assassination in the square failed, various places would mobilize, and the Alert forces of the Hair Thieves nearby would be attracted over. Coupled with the diversion at East Gate Market and the inn, the attention of the various Hair Thief government offices would be dispersed. With his side plotting against their unpreparedness, there should be a sixty to seventy percent chance of hitting the target in one blow.

Now that Zhou Zhongjun and the others had been discovered and captured by the Hair Thieves, he immediately broke away from the gymnasium quickly with a few core disciples. Walking along the way, gunshots came from the distance. He saw that the number of Hair Thief police and soldiers on the road had increased greatly. Black-clothed police riding two-wheeled vehicles rampaged through the streets, and black and white carriages headed towards the gymnasium and Qiongan Inn one after another. Roadblocks began to be set up at major intersections to check pedestrians, and the barrier gates of branch roads and alleys were also closed. Along the way, rumors caused panic, and every step was startling. The group mixed in the crowd and finally escaped the area near the gymnasium before martial law was imposed.

At this time, there were very few people on the street. Pedestrians were all in a hurry, shops were closing one after another, and the street was very deserted. The gunshots everywhere had also stopped. Zhuo Yifan led several junior brothers to speed up their pace. Although he tried his best to hide it, tears had already fallen from his eyes.

Although he had regarded Zhou Zhongjun and others as pawns that could be sacrificed, the thought of them being trapped in the heavy siege of the Hair Thieves meant they were likely doomed. Although most of them were not familiar with him, the thought that they might have died or were being escorted to the Hair Thieves' prison to suffer torture worse than death filled his chest with grief and indignation.

Even if he had to risk his life this time, he had to kill a few True Kuns!

However, as soon as the pedestrians thinned out, they immediately realized that there was a "tail" behind them. This immediately made Zhuo Yifan nervous: *Have the Hair Thieves targeted them?*

He was secretly nervous and looked back quietly, only to see more than ten plainclothes personnel following closely behind. He immediately turned around and made a gesture to the junior brothers behind him. Immediately, the four walked quickly off the main road, went up the Wenlan River embankment, jumped, and leaped into the rolling waves.

Although the opportunity to ambush the Hair Thieves convoy was rare, the enemy had obviously discovered them. At this moment, escaping was the most important thing! Therefore, he made a prompt decision to "leave is the best strategy."

Fifty meters behind them, a naturalized citizen plainclothes policeman was dumbfounded for a while before pulling out his whistle and blowing it desperately.

The police officers who had been tracking this group of "disguised saboteurs" quickly assembled, but they had no boats and could only send one person running back to report, while the rest searched along the river.

"The thieves may swim across the river to escape. Quickly find a boat to cross the river!" A naturalized citizen police officer shouted loudly, "Quick, go notify the Water Police!"

Zhuo Yifan held a reed tube in his mouth and submerged in the water. After entering the water, the few of them did not cross the river, but turned around and drifted downstream with the current.

The "Scenic Belt" along the Wenlan River was built along the river embankment. On one side was a thoroughfare, and on the other side flowers and trees were planted. The scenery was charming. At this moment, the Art Troupe convoy was driving close to the river embankment, the wheels crushing the flowers and plants on the roadside from time to time, looking quite landscape-spoiling. However, the Senators accompanying the convoy had no mood to consider these things.

After the convoy turned around, the dense gunshots from the rear and the smoke in the sky in the direction of the square told them an unmistakable fact: the enemy had launched an attack right in the heart of the Senate's rule: Lingao.

This somewhat reminded them that their lives were too comfortable.

"Treating a foreign land as one's hometown." This sentence suddenly burst into Dongfang Ke's mind.

Here, it was still the dangerous space-time of the 17th century. Enemies glared like tigers, surrounding them on all sides, ready to tear them to pieces at any moment.

Dongfang Ke involuntarily tightened his grip on the pistol. He squatted on the seat next to the car door. Okamoto and Nan Gonghao sat on the other side. Since these two had basically no pistol shooting experience, two pistols were placed there as insurance.

Liu Shuixin, the only woman in the car, sat on the floor in the middle of the carriage, silent.

The guard soldiers traveling on foot spread out in a "Right Echelon" formation on the road, focusing on guarding the road and protecting the Senators' carriages under the roadbed on the side near the river; to make up for the gap in the direction of the river embankment, he ordered the accompanying guards to get back on the carriages, pointing their guns toward the river embankment. At the end of the team was the guard captain keeping watch. He had just fired warning shots several times to disperse the flow of people. Now the team had left the hotspot area and slightly increased its speed.

Sitting on the public carriages were naturalized citizen musicians gathered from old opera troupes. Unlike the situation that Head Okamoto worried about, they were not those frail "art workers" from the old timeline. These Ming Dynasty musicians who had traveled the Jianghu for years seemed to have a natural adaptability to danger and chaos. They sat peacefully in their seats. Although their expressions were frightened, no one lost control and ran around or moved randomly.

Four heads drilled out of the water one after another, climbing up the lower edge of the river embankment from the river beach. It was Zhuo Yifan and his group. Although they didn't understand what exactly went wrong, their prompt escape temporarily saved their lives. The four were still in shock when they suddenly heard regular gunshots coming from upstream, followed by the faint appearance of carriages, horses, and figures. Several people were about to jump back into the water, but were stopped by Zhuo Yifan.

"Don't panic. This place is already very far from the gymnasium. There is no one around. Let's hide and rest for a while, and wait for the people and horses ahead to pass before making a plan."

Immediately, several people scattered and lay down in the bushes. Zhuo Yifan stared intently at the situation on the road and suddenly discovered something.

"Two four-wheeled public carriages, one four-wheeled small carriage, one four-wheeled carriage carrying goods, soldiers guarding the sides... Isn't this the convoy mentioned in the intelligence report!" Zhuo Yifan whispered excitedly, thinking that this group of Hair Thieves must have turned back from the direction of the gymnasium, presumably startled by the chaos and anxious to return to Bairen City to hide, only to run into them here.

"Coming early isn't as good as coming at the right time! Today we will exterminate you Hair Thieves who use barbarians to change China!" He immediately crawled to his companions' side and told them what he had found.

However, after a brief exchange, the four discovered difficulties. The convoy was gradually approaching, and the figures of the accompanying soldiers on the road were becoming clearer. At a glance, there were at least ten of them. The enemy outnumbered them, and the Australian firearms were incredibly sharp. To fight head-on obviously had little chance of winning.

Originally, he had prepared to make some preparations on the road, but now the whole plan was in disarray, so he could only act hastily!

"Right now, we can only take a risky move," Zhuo Yifan said slowly. "This group of Hair Thieves is all in carriages. Horses are most easily startled. Junior Brother Zhao, are your Rising Promotion Cannons still usable?"

"The cannons are still here," Junior Brother Zhao took out a bamboo tube from under his clothes. "The wax seal is still good, should be usable!"

"I have one here too." Another disciple also took one out.

"Good. This is the Three-Sound Thunderclap Cannon specially made by the Lei family. It is the most powerful. Since we can't use it to signal, we'll use it to spook the horses!" Zhuo Yifan said, "The Hair Thieves have a total of four carriages. The first and second are large carriages, carrying the Hair Thieves' musicians. The last one carries the Hair Thieves' musical instruments and luggage. The True Kuns are all in the third carriage."

He first explained the situation one by one, and then assigned tasks: "Junior Brother Zhao, you are on the river embankment. Use this Thunderclap Cannon to shoot the first carriage first, then the fourth carriage. Both of these are heavy-laden carriages. Once the horses are startled, the carriages will overturn immediately, and the Hair Thieves' carriage will be blocked in the middle. Junior Brother Lu, your hidden weapon skills are the best. As soon as the Rising Promotion Cannon sounds, you rush over and shoot the horses of the True Kuns' carriage. Junior Brother Wu, follow me to sneak attack the carriage."

At this time, Junior Brother Zhao raised an objection:

"Senior Brother, the Hair Thieves' team has been firing guns several times along the way. Their horses are probably all warhorses or the like, trained not to fear the sound of firearms..."

"This Rising Promotion Cannon has a lot of powder charge. Even if you miss the horse, falling near the horse is enough to startle it." He pointed to the nearby terrain: "Look, the Hair Thief soldiers are all on the main road. The side of the river bank is blocked by the carriages, making it difficult for their firearms to hit. We have a sixty to seventy percent chance of success. Whether we succeed or not, retreat immediately after one strike, roll directly down the river embankment and enter the water." Zhuo Yifan came up with a set of plans in desperation, ignoring the many rash points in it.

The people he brought with him were all close disciples of his sect. They were all from good families. Although they were young, their martial arts and knowledge were all commendable. What was more rare was their sincere hearts, valuing righteousness over life. At this moment, they just accepted the orders and promised.
