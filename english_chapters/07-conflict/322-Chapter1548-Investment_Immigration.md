# Chapter 1548 - Investment Immigration

Even Zhou Zhongjun expressed interest in testing for an acupuncturist license. The atmosphere relaxed; everyone felt they could finally settle down in Lingao.

"We men can finally gain a foothold in Nanbao." Huang Zhen sighed, taking off his Six-Harmony Unity Hat to dust it off before placing it on the table. "I've traveled north and south for decades, but I never expected the Cropped-Hairs' territory to be this difficult—the toughest place of all!"

The others didn't know of his "adventure" today. Song Shengying thought he was disheartened by days of running around, so he offered words of comfort like "a great man can bend and stretch."

Because Zhou Zhongjun went out often and spent money lavishly, Huang Zhen, fearing trouble, reminded everyone again not to go out without reason and to notify him beforehand if they did. He glared at Zhou Zhongjun—having suffered a small loss and knowing she was in the wrong, she had to listen.

After settling this, Huang Zhen found the construction funds running low—renovation was "all-inclusive," settled weekly. After paying this week's bill, Shopkeeper Huang found little left of the thousand circulation vouchers. The new funds hadn't arrived. This plunged the team into a new crisis.

Without money, one couldn't move an inch anywhere. Huang Zhen had seven or eight people and a half-finished stall. Sima Qiudao had gone like a crane into the clouds, with no news—Sima was his liaison with "Seventh Master." Without Seventh Master's covert support, he had no confidence.

After waiting anxiously for several days, Sima Qiudao finally appeared. It turned out he had been "job hunting" and now worked for the Native Products Company under the Ministry of Commerce—specifically as a "Purchaser" responsible for acquiring local specialties. This allowed him to travel openly within Lingao County.

Since Sima Qiudao refused to shave his head for purification, he was only a "temporary worker." Having secured the job, he returned to Nanbao.

Sima Qiudao brought operating funds forwarded by Seventh Master and new news: Zhuo Yifan and others had landed in Qionshan County and were heading for Lingao.

What specifically they would do in Lingao, only Zhuo Yifan knew. But given the initial instruction to infiltrate, the operation surely had considerable difficulty and required time to await the right moment.

However, this group had over twenty people, putting Huang Zhen in a bind. He groaned inwardly; opening this shop for seven or eight people already felt crowded. Now over twenty more were coming at once—how to house them? Housing wasn't easy to arrange. Nanbao was okay, but to settle in East Gate Market or Bopu, rent alone was a significant figure—assuming one could even rent a place. Lingao's housing shortage was severe.

Housing aside, what identity would so many people use? Lingao's household registration management was extremely tight. How could a mixed group of men and women, old and young, register for residence permits?

Sima Qiudao said, "It doesn't matter. Seventh Master said they have their own way. We don't need to interfere."

"The Cropped-Hairs have nets everywhere here..."

"It doesn't matter," Sima Qiudao said confidently. "Seventh Master thought of a way for them. Since there are many people, it's better to enter openly and aboveboard. That way strictly causes no issues."

"Is that so?" Huang Zhen was confused. But since the elders decided, it wasn't his place to say more.

East Gate Market, South Fifth Lane. On the main road of this urban-rural fringe full of wasteland and construction sites, a mighty convoy arrived that day.

The convoy was quite large. Leading was a two-wheeled Dongfeng carriage, followed by four four-wheeled Hongqi carriages, then three four-wheeled freight wagons piled high and covered tightly with oilcloth, and finally another two-wheeled carriage.

Such a convoy would have attracted onlookers a year or two ago, but in the last six months, such convoys were often seen on the streets. Their destination was usually the suburban area outside East Gate Market's Fifth Lane.

It was late spring in Lingao, and the weather was getting hot. The saplings along the new road offered no shade. But various flowering trees were in full bloom, making the journey a riot of color, like a painting.

The convoy's wheels crunched over the cinder road and stopped in front of a large compound on South Fifth Lane.

In Lingao, full of buildings, this traditional-style structure looked very abrupt. From its brand-new tile ends and snow-white walls, one knew it was recently built.

A huge black sign with gold characters hung at the entrance: "Qiongan Inn." This was Lingao's largest traditional-style inn.

In recent years, chaos had plagued the Central Plains. Not only did bandits run rampant, but civil uprisings occurred daily, making roads unsafe. Local powers rich and influential built forts and organized militias for protection. Small and medium landlords could hardly survive in the countryside without seeking shelter under tycoons.

Even moving to the county seat became increasingly unsafe. So many families sold their properties and migrated to the peaceful and prosperous "blessed land" of Jiangnan to "avoid the noise."

Lingao County in Qiongzhou Prefecture, far away in Guangdong, had now become a candidate site for wealthy refugees to "escape the noise." Rumors of Lingao's prosperity, peace, and the people's contentment had spread more or less to the mainland. The wealthy, having opportunities to contact "Australian goods," knew more about Lingao.

Though not many wealthy people knew of and had the courage to run to Lingao, for a remote place like Lingao, it was quite a lot.

The Civil Affairs Department didn't object to their immigration—immigration was always welcomed. Moreover, these wealthy people held large amounts of capital; settling in Lingao could effectively stimulate consumption. Besides, the Yuan Elder Court needed more gold and silver hard currency to balance "international payments."

"Qiongan Inn" was born of this need. Its owner was Li Sunqian, a member of the Lingao Consultative Council and former "Night Soil Tyrant." After voluntarily surrendering ownership of the night soil routes in Lingao county seat, Li Sunqian began investing in industry under the Ministry of Commerce's guidance.

At first, the Li family only invested in some of the Yuan Elder Court's state-owned enterprises. Gradually, seeing the potential of real estate, the Li family began developing properties around East Gate Market.

As mainland households crossed the sea to Lingao, Li Sunqian seized the opportunity, bought much land around South Fifth Lane, and hired the Lingao Construction General Company to design and build "luxury mansions" specifically to sell to these people.

Though called "luxury mansions," they weren't traditional buildings. They merely kept the style of traditional architecture while using modern architectural concepts for the internal structure. Comfort and land utilization were far superior to traditional buildings.

However, Li Sunqian was a local tycoon after all; he understood the residential preferences, family structures, and living habits of his own kind far better than the Senators. So his "luxury mansions" were very popular with these wealthy households; the first batch sold out shortly after completion. While the second batch was under construction, the Li family's young master, Li Xiaopeng, taught himself to "sell off-plan," selling the "mansions" still under construction to the wealthy crossing the sea.

Money collected, houses still building. Families with dragging dependents and countless luggage needed a place to settle first. Li Xiaopeng had a brainwave and conceived "transitional housing": build an "inn" specifically for their clients.

Having received many guests, he knew these wealthy people crossing the sea were mostly apprehensive. To reassure them, he had to provide a living environment similar to their old homes.

Thus the Li family invested in building this "Qiongan Inn." Roughly speaking: Ming architecture, Australian equipment. Ensuring the atmosphere while fully letting guests experience the comfort of the "Australian" lifestyle.

Business boomed upon opening. For the wealthy crossing the sea, the "Australian" lifestyle hadn't influenced them yet. Even the Commercial Hostel, the top "State Guesthouse" in East Gate Market, seemed to them too petty in layout—no courtyards, no separation of upper and lower rooms, no housing for servants. They couldn't settle their slaves.

Qiongan Inn considered all this during construction. Accommodation was comfortable, service impeccably appropriate. So despite the high cost of a night's stay, most investment immigrants chose to stay here.

As the convoy stopped in the square before the spirit screen, clerks waiting at the door greeted them, helping people down and unloading luggage, busy as bees.

The ground was swept clean. Several handcarts waited aside specifically for luggage.

From the last two-wheeled carriage, a traveler jumped down lightly. He wore a fine silk robe, a gauze hairnet, held a brilliantly mottled bronze sword in one hand, patted dust from his clothes with the other, looked up at the sky, and muttered to himself, "The weather here is truly hot! A good rain would be nice!"

A clerk smiled and stepped forward to take the sword, but a pageboy who got off first had already taken it. The pageboy was young, with red lips and white teeth—truly handsome. Exactly the kind of pretty boy wealthy households loved to keep.

The clerks were all smooth old hands. Seeing he couldn't ingratiate himself, and knowing the sword was valuable, he quickly smiled, "Our Lingao is summer all year round; even winter isn't that cold. But spring doesn't like to rain; come summer, it rains endlessly—that's what's unbearable. Guest, please come inside; the shop has prepared plum syrup and fruits to cool off." Saying this, he couldn't help sizing up this guest secretly.

This young scholar was about twenty, in the prime of youth, looking full of vigor and energy. Though dressed as a scholar, his skin was bronzed. Long eyebrows reaching his temples, eyes like bright stars. His tightly closed lips showed he didn't like to speak loosely. A slightly protruding chin indicated a strong character. His features were elegant yet lacked no masculine determination.
