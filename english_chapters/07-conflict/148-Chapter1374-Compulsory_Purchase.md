# Chapter 1374 - Compulsory Purchase

The silk guests came, but the reeled silk couldn't be sold! No one was willing to sell the silk they had worked so hard to make at such a pitiably low price, especially since most families had incurred debts for this silk!

The philtrum of everyone in the village tightened. Except for the children who didn't worry about anything, the smiles were gone from everyone's faces.

The silk guests didn't collect any silk, but they didn't leave either. They all looked very assured. They found familiar lodgings to stay on their own, drinking tea and chatting at the wild teahouse at the village entrance during the day. No matter how old acquaintances pleaded and begged, they just wouldn't relent. They also had a set of rhetoric: just sighing about their bitterness, saying they were "unable to help themselves," and were unwilling to treat the "fellow villagers" so harshly - this was all the intention of the "yamen." In short, they clenched their teeth and wouldn't let go. They clearly put on a face of "you have to sell even if you don't want to." They were veterans in this trade and knew for sure that silk was the only hope for the villagers right now. If it couldn't be converted into cash, where would the expenses for the next steps come from? Besides, silk and cocoons were things that couldn't be kept. Absolutely no family could stockpile them.

Finally, someone came up with an idea. Since the local silk hongs had a public price, the neighboring prefecture shouldn't have this rule, and the price should be about the same as last year - why not go to Huzhou, Jiaxing, or Suzhou to sell silk?

It was just a long way to go from here. A round trip to the nearest one would take five or six days. Travel expenses on the road cost money, and passing checks and locks along the way also cost money. In the past, it wouldn't have been worth it. But looking at the market price now being so low, the loss would be even more severe if they didn't make this trip.

Shen Kaibao calculated properly and decided to go to Huzhou to try his luck - he had been to Wuzhen when he was young and knew a little about the place. There were many silk hongs there, and it was a big trading place. It should be possible to sell raw silk for a good price. Immediately, he instructed Daqing to get a few reed mats, and asked his wife and Daqing's wife to cook rice, wrapped in bamboo leaves as food for the road. He also brought some fried wheat flour, ready to eat mixed with boiling water on the road.

Daqing's mother cooked the rice, packed it in a basket, and instructed him: "Come back early after selling! The rice at home won't last many days!"

Shen Kaibao shouted as if he wanted to quarrel: "No matter how fast, it has to be rowed one oar after another. I've sold silk all my life, and now that I'm old, I have to be exiled!"

Daqing said to his mother: "If we run out of food, you should go to the Shen Da family to borrow rice. Duoduo's mother said Master Zhao is willing to continue lending."

Shen Kaibao interrupted his son's words: "He's willing to lend, but I'm not willing to borrow! Where is this one percent interest coming from?! Paying back with cocoons, at such a low market price, is simply open robbery! Try to endure as much as possible. Wait for me to sell the silk and bring back silver to buy rice!"

Catching the days when the weather cleared up, Shen Kaibao took Daqing and rowed the boat out. Seeing that Shen Kaibao's family had set off, other families also followed suit and rowed their boats out. Those without boats borrowed boats, or asked someone to take them along.

The flame of hope that had become tiny was now burning ragingly again. There were some smiles on the faces of people left at home - Heaven never bars one's way. As long as the head of the household could reach the outer prefecture peacefully, they could sell for a good price, and life could still go on!

On the contrary, the silk guests were still drinking tea at the wild tea shop at the village entrance with assured faces, showing unfathomable smiles. It seemed they had a well-thought-out plan long ago.

Sure enough, within two or three days, the boats that went out came back one after another. Many boats were empty, but the people on the boats all had mourning faces: not only did they suffer and toil in vain, but some people also got beaten on their buttocks and came back limping. It turned out that the water and land checkpoints out of Hangzhou had all received the yamen's warrant. This year, cocoons and silk leaving the border must hold a license from the Famine Relief Bureau. Those without a license were stopped at the checkpoints, and the cocoons and silk were all "harmoniously bought" at a twenty percent discount on the "public price." If there was any disobedience, a beating with bamboo boards was light - those who were put in cangues were even more miserable. They couldn't even come back and had to have their families rush over immediately with money to redeem them, otherwise they would have to be in the cangue for a month before being released.

Shen Kaibao's family didn't suffer losses - he was a bit clever. Although he was the first to set off, he hid behind others when crossing the checkpoint. As soon as he heard the bad news from the front, he quickly turned the boat around and rushed back.

Although the silk was not "harmoniously bought," his family's silk still couldn't be sold, and there were quite a few cocoons stored at home - the silkworm harvest was good this year, and just relying on his wife and Daqing's wife to make silk couldn't keep up at all.

Those less lucky families cried to the heavens. Especially in a few families, the heads of the households were arrested and put in cangues, requiring money to redeem them - which family in the village still had ready cash available now? But if they didn't go to redeem them, being in a cangue in the open air day and night, if no one delivered food, they would really have no bite of rice or water, liable to be starved or thirsted to death alive. Besides, what about the farm work this month? If delayed, the whole family, old and young, would starve to death.

The crying of women and children drifted over in waves from far and near. The atmosphere of despair filled the village: How can common people fight against the yamen? They have thought of everything you can think of. It's not up to you not to sell.

Finally, it was Wang Siniang who came out to help, lending the redemption silver to these families.

The silk and cocoons weren't sold, but the creditors and the bailiffs urging for grain tax came. The creditors didn't want silk and cocoons - their news was very well-informed, knowing that silk and cocoons couldn't sell for a good price this year. They just kept a straight face and ignored it, relentlessly urging for debt repayment. Those who couldn't pay back were told to quickly take out the title deeds for mortgage.

Shen Kaibao's family was considered okay. After all, the agreement with Master Cao was to pay the principal and interest at the Mid-Autumn Festival. The debt problem was not yet burning the eyebrows. What needed to be paid right now was only the debt owed to Shen Da's master, Master Zhao.

After returning home, Duoduo's mother had been helping Wang Siniang urge every household: don't forget to pay Master Zhao's debt after harvesting silkworm cocoons: the debt of borrowed rice, the debt of leaves bought on credit. It didn't feel like much when borrowing, but adding it up now, they realized it was also a considerable figure. Fortunately, the interest was lower.

Repaying Master Zhao's debt was easy. His family wanted neither silver nor raw silk, only silkworm cocoons to offset the debt, which was simplest for the farmers - it saved a lot of trouble. It was just that the cocoon price determined by Master Zhao's family was no different from the offer of the "silk guests." The silkworm farmers felt equally distressed, but at this moment, they couldn't hesitate anymore. The silk guests refused to raise the price. If the cocoons were kept for a long time, they would turn into pupae. If they chewed through, they could only be sold as silk floss.

Dark oily large scales were set up at the Shen Da family's door. Every household carried baskets full of silkworm cocoons to pay debts and interest. Wang Siniang had already let out word: if you borrow and repay, it's not hard to borrow again. Master Zhao is benevolent. As long as the debts are paid off with cocoons on time, he will help if everyone has any difficulties next.

These words greatly accelerated the speed of silkworm farmers using cocoons to offset debts. Some families simply didn't reel silk either and sold all the remaining cocoons to the Shen Da family directly. After calculation, families who made silk themselves lost heavily. The labor and firewood invested in reeling silk, compared with the current raw silk market price, were simply too miserable to look at. On the contrary, a few families with few hands who couldn't afford the time and manpower sold silkworm cocoons directly, spending less and losing less instead.

Shen Kaibao's family had been hesitating, but now they had to take the cocoons at home that hadn't been reeled yet to offset the debt. At the river pier in front of the Shen Da family's door, some boats arrived at some unknown time. The silkworm cocoons used by farmers to offset debts were packed in rattan baskets with covers, filling the boat cabins, covered tightly with reed mats on top, and rowed out boat by boat - it was said that they were all sent to Master Zhao's filature.

The raw silk already reeled had to be sold at the public price. Some were sold to silk guests, and some to Master Zhao. Although some young people said indignantly that they would rather keep it until next year to sell, this was ultimately just angry talk. Not to mention that silk would turn yellow if kept for a long time, even if it didn't turn yellow, there were currently as many places to spend money as hairs on an ox - even if silk sold for one hundred taels next year, they couldn't wait.

In the end, the silk and cocoons obtained with untold hardships flowed away from the fingers of the silkworm farmers who had worked hard for more than a month, exchanged for a pile of broken silver and copper coins, more or less. This remuneration they obtained with huge labor couldn't be kept for long before becoming someone else's. Owed debts, government taxes, the whole family's rations, renting draft cattle for the next farming, buying bean cakes, repairing farm tools... everything was waiting for money - filling all these in was still far from enough.

In their destitution, the villagers had to continue their old path: raising debt to maintain themselves. Fortunately, Shen Da's master, Master Zhao, was willing to lend money even without collateral, and the interest remained at one percent. Thus, the villagers who had just paid off Master Zhao's debt soon shouldered debts again.

Wang Siniang and Lizheng were very happy. The tasks the master gave them were all completed: they bought enough silkworm cocoons, and at the same time, made the villagers shoulder more debts - as long as they shouldered debts, there was no worry that they wouldn't submit.

Under the combined efforts of the government, the gentry, and Zhao Yingong, the sericulture households in Hangzhou Prefecture were solidly bled once. The handling officials, the committee members of the Famine Relief Bureau, the bosses of the silk hongs... everyone up and down made a fortune of varying sizes. Zhao Yingong himself harvested abundantly. Not only did he obtain one thousand piculs of raw silk at a very low price, but he also got his wish to make the more than ten villages carrying out cooperative activities shoulder the debts of the cooperative.

And the sericulture households in the entire Hangzhou Prefecture also fell to the brink of bankruptcy. Shanhai Wulu sent him a lot of news in this regard.

"This bunch of black-hearted people really eat people without spitting out bones," thought Zhao Yingong.

He knew they were black, but didn't know they could be this black. The guiding purchase price Zhao Yingong gave to the Famine Relief Bureau this time was fifty taels of silver per picul - roughly the purchase price of the silk hongs last year. He originally estimated that with the Famine Relief Bureau peeling off a layer, the handling silk hongs peeling off a layer, and the handling personnel up and down sharing some profit, the actual purchase price from the silkworm farmers would be around thirty taels.

He didn't expect this gang to really "cut the price in half." Their strikes were so ruthless. This made Zhao Yingong wary of his "collaborators." It seemed he had to organize some strong security forces to guarantee the safety of himself and his industries.
